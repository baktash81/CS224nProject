1
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:33,505
A disgrace. Absolutely disgusting.

2
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:38,508
I'd like to cut that.

3
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:52,979
That was great, girls.
But rock 'n' roll is not my cup of poison.

4
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:56,856
I remember when I was a young man...

5
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:05,279
- I just don't understand those kids.
- If you had to listen to their music...

6
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:09,325
Did you see those chaperones?
They were built like Khrushchev.

7
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:14,661
- They weren't as bad as those D.O.M.'s.
- I got the money.

8
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,499
- 300 bucks.
- One more high-school hop and I split.

9
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:22,085
Hey, don't bogart the joint, friends.

10
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:25,754
Cool it, man. I need it more than you.

11
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:37,055
I don't know,
maybe all you need is love.

12
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:44,020
Casey, let's split. The principal's gonna
hit me with a few caps of acid.

13
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:47,605
- You coming?
- Yeah.

14
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,902
Do you believe those kids,
making it all the time?

15
00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:00,241
Don't get so upset, Casey.
You know how Kelly is.

16
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:12,084
- Are you trying to make love to me?
- Hell no.

17
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:15,168
- Then what are you trying to do?
- I'm trying not to.

18
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:19,673
Well, if you wanna make love,
then let's make love.

19
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,882
Here?

20
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,802
No, in L.A.

21
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,426
- L.A.?
- Where is that?

22
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,303
- We'd get crushed.
- Not us.

23
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,848
- Smog. Can 't see.
- Climb a tall tree.

24
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,558
- Lousy traffic.
- Love to walk.

25
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,184
- No culture.
- Grooves.

26
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,309
- Cold and cruel.
- Swimming pools.

27
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:37,395
- Phony city.
- It's so pretty.

28
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:39,522
- Religious nuts.
- Takes all kinds.

29
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,816
- Noisy. Noisy.
- Soul-beat brother.

30
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:43,526
- Tinsel town.
- Solid city.

31
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:45,901
- Gaudy. Ugly.
- Gassy. Classy.

32
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,945
- Cheap anyhow.
- Yeah, like wow.

33
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:49,738
- Very dirty.
- Simon-pure.

34
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:51,949
- Dull scene.
- My dream.

35
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,659
- Square, hey.
- No way.

36
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:55,409
- Sick and low.
- Living show.

37
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:57,786
- It's got no class.
- Nothing but.

38
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:00,539
- Empty. No heart.
- Full, sweetheart.

39
00:07:00,747 --> 00:07:02,291
- No-talent town.
- Don 't put it down.

40
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,126
- Junkie heaven.
- Not for me.

41
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:06,084
- Dishonest clowns.
- Sincere.

42
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:09,129
- Perverts. Fruits.
- Swingers. Kooks.

43
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:11,798
- Obvious. Stinks.
- Full-length minks.

44
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,842
- All strangers.
- Not all.

45
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,467
- Like who?
- My aunt.

46
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,427
- Since when?
- Since Aunt Susan.

47
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:19,387
- Oh, yeah?
- Rich Aunt Susan.

48
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,014
- Bitch Aunt Susan.
- Got my share.

49
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:22,557
- Of what?
- The bread.

50
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:24,100
- Cool head.
- So we go?

51
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,517
So go!

52
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,211
So all we need now
is your long-lost Aunt...

53
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:54,256
- What's her name?
- Her name is Susan Lake.

54
00:08:54,463 --> 00:08:57,715
This batch has more snap.
Run the rest at the same ASA.

55
00:08:57,924 --> 00:09:00,593
- Long distance, Miss Lake.
- Hello? Who?

56
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,846
Q-U-A-N-T. In London.

57
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:09,892
Yeah, that's correct.
As quickly as possible.

58
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:14,021
Susan, we must have a chat.
The bodice is so wrong.

59
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,066
- Doesn't she look like a cow?
- The fact is, Cynthia is not a boy.

60
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:23,279
Take off your bra, dear.
That will flatten you some.

61
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:27,114
Have her put it back on.
Betty, tell him it's impossible.

62
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:31,577
Gordon, she looks exactly the same
with or without the bra.

63
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:40,876
- Porter, explain this contract to me.
- We can't get three years, Susan.

64
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:45,086
They'll go two and a half.
The editor tells me that is final.

65
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:47,630
- People!
- I need some time with you.

66
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:53,136
Can we discuss it at dinner?
That'll give you time to talk to Vogue.

67
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,601
- Anything we can do for you?
- That's okay...

68
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,436
...I can come back.
- Out with it. We're not that frantic.

69
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:08,773
- I'm your niece.
- You're Catherine's daughter?

70
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,984
My name's Kelly Mac Namara.

71
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:16,987
Susan! Susan!
I am simply in a rage!

72
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:19,281
How did your mother learn
about Aunt Claire?

73
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,118
The Worcester paper is where she heard
about Aunt Claire's death and about...

74
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:26,161
...you and Baxter Wolfe
and the inheritance.

75
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:31,249
- What inheritance was that?
- Mine. I was last in line after my sister.

76
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:36,795
Your mother disappeared. We were never
really close. I was 14 years younger.

77
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:41,925
But now that you've come along, Kelly,
I think that part of it should be yours.

78
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:45,343
Susan, you know there was
no provision in the will.

79
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,346
- Thousand Island?
- No, thank you.

80
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:51,599
You're a lawyer. You should
know that wills are just paper.

81
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:56,727
I'm a lawyer, yes. And any changes
Aunt Claire would or might have made...

82
00:10:56,894 --> 00:11:00,106
...have no validity in law.
- Porter, of course I know that.

83
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:05,025
Kelly, there was nearly a million dollars.
I know this isn't the time or place...

84
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:08,946
...but since Porter's made such a
point of it, I can't see why...

85
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:12,699
...say, a third of it shouldn't be yours.

86
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:17,327
- A third of a million dollars?
- The two of us are the only survivors.

87
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:20,580
I don't see why you should have to pay
for the sins of your mother?

88
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:25,041
Sins that seem to me that were really
committed by the rest of the family.

89
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:29,963
- That's a big idea to get used to.
- I'll have Porter draw up the papers.

90
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,507
I have a marvelous idea.
Ronnie Barzell's throwing a party tonight.

91
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:37,176
Ronnie Barzell?
You mean Z-Man Barzell?

92
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,637
The one, the only, the original.

93
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:41,931
Susan, I've got friends in a rock group.

94
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:45,266
It would mean so much for them to
meet Z-Man. Can I invite them?

95
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:46,642
Don't tell me you're a groupie.

96
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,561
The other way around. It's my group.

97
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:53,232
Now, let me be sure I fully understand
this. You are a rock 'n' roll singer?

98
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,233
- Why? Is that a no-no?
- My dear young lady...

99
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,070
Porter, you have an unending capacity
for counterfeit astonishment.

100
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:03,657
Of course you can invite your friends.
There's a phone in the living room.

101
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,658
I think that Ronnie's address is in
my book under the B's.

102
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:08,952
Great!
I'm not dressed for a party, though.

103
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,913
We're about the same size,
and I got loads of things in my closet.

104
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,248
Call your friends
and slip into anything you like. Okay?

105
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:17,167
Oh, groovy! Thanks.

106
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,711
Susan, have you taken
leave of your senses?

107
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:24,215
Some anonymous rock 'n' roll singer
drops in here out of the clear blue sky...

108
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:25,965
...and you fall for a lie.

109
00:12:26,174 --> 00:12:29,218
You won't believe this, but we've been
invited to a party at Z-Man Barzell's.

110
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:32,055
- Is this for real?
- Get Casey and Pet, and meet me there.

111
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:36,015
This creature marches in without a cent
to her name and a dubious pedigree...

112
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:38,142
...and without a moment's thought...

113
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,187
...you recklessly dispose
of a third of your money.

114
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:44,980
- Porter, let me handle this.
- The party starts when you get there.

115
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:47,316
- Susan, please.
- We're late already.

116
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:56,364
- They banned my last film in Cincinnati.
- Groovy town.

117
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,700
When I'm with you, pussycat,
who needs grass?

118
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:02,996
You'd have to see it to believe it.
Of course, I nearly choked.

119
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,916
- And then this bitch took a drink...
- He's bothered every woman at the bar.

120
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:11,753
Do you know what happened
after he drank a Fresca?

121
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:17,048
- He snowed in his pants.
- You know what he uses for deodorant?

122
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,842
- Raid.
- Cool, man.

123
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:25,471
My old man really blew his mind. He said
he'd kill me if he found anymore grass.

124
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,224
- Escape, man.
- All right!

125
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,685
- And you're a moonchild.
- And you're a bitch.

126
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,562
- I think it's better after the change.
- I'm with you.

127
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:40,109
I was ready to roll over and fall asleep.

128
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:46,196
Then Tony said, "Come over to my pad.
I've got a wading pool of mayonnaise!"

129
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:50,742
I found the European women
far more receptive and less hung-up.

130
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:55,328
- She went after me like a barracuda.
- I warned you, you old fruit.

131
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:57,664
- Classics Benjamin.
- Bad trip.

132
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:02,711
- It wasn't long, but four inches thick.
- Ever been whipped with a wand...

133
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:08,339
...until the blood came?
- Cool it! You'll rupture your tongue.

134
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:15,010
Feel it, my pretty?
The night is filled with magic.

135
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:20,558
- Mark my words, dove, tonight is special.
- I was so anxious, I stepped on her face.

136
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,810
Susan, Porter, how are you?

137
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:26,979
Ronnie, see who's here.

138
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,153
- I'll say it. Haven't I seen you before?
- You saw her at my studio this afternoon.

139
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:38,447
- Ronnie, this is my niece, Kelly.
- Every inch as ugly as you are, Susan.

140
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:39,990
Must run in the family.

141
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:42,826
I'd like you to meet Vanessa,
my escort and bodyguard.

142
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:46,036
- Pleasure.
- Come on, babe, I'll show you the dump.

143
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:51,041
Come with me. I want to show you
the most divine clairvoyant.

144
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:00,631
- What can I get you, juice or grass?
- Just a vodka and tonic, please.

145
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:04,385
Look there.
The infamous Ashley St. Ives...

146
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,929
...famous for her portrayals
in prettily, pornographic pictures.

147
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:14,143
See how she gives her body
to the ritual? Delicious.

148
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:19,355
Observe in yon quiet corner, an island
of tranquility in this sea of revelry.

149
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:23,901
The languid Roxanne finds beauty,
that delicate pinch of feminine spice...

150
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:27,027
...with which she so often flavors
her interludes.

151
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:31,865
Look there. Lance Rocke,
Greek god and part-time actor.

152
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,949
See how well he performs?
His is a special talent.

153
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:39,454
The golden hair, the bedroom eyes,
the firm young body.

154
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:45,458
These are the tools with which he plies
his trade. All are available for a price.

155
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:50,797
Beware, fair maiden, of Emerson Thorne.
Behind that friendly mask...

156
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:55,091
...lies fermenting the unholy seed
of a lawyer.

157
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:59,679
See there, behind the bar, the man
with the benign Germanic countenance?

158
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:03,391
Could that be
another face of Martin Bormann?

159
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:07,726
I've been to parties where they danced
to records by Strawberry Alarm Clock.

160
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:13,065
But this is the first time The Strawberry
Alarm Clock's ever been to the party.

161
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:16,483
What are you shelling out?
I hear the minimum is four thou.

162
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,695
- I get them for free. They're mine.
- Wow. Really?

163
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:22,155
Here, have some grass.
Aunt Susan won't see you.

164
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:28,952
No, thanks, man. In a scene like this,
you get a contact high!

165
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,790
This is my happening
and it freaks me out!

166
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:35,623
It's a stone gas, man.

167
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,584
Pray, we must make haste.
My time is not my own.

168
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:42,380
Before the clock strikes 12,
I must be back at Forest Lawn.

169
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:44,630
Come. I know of a cozy,
little dungeon...

170
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:48,592
...where just the two of us can curl up
with the chains and a spider.

171
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:55,389
Delighted to see my hostages
in such happy dalliance.

172
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,892
Pray, let them joust in peace.

173
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,439
You're not helping the situation any,
I must say.

174
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:10,610
Out. Out. Count Dracula relishes
an audience, only one at a time.

175
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:15,739
- Have fun.
- What is this, a studio tour?

176
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,704
- This looks like the...
- Master's bedroom.

177
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:29,167
Can you dig it?
Follow me, my dear.

178
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:32,128
Let me show you
one of my preoccupations.

179
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:35,129
And this is the master's bath.

180
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,007
Come on.

181
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:42,011
- Sorry to disturb you.
- It's cool, baby.

182
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:48,223
Hey, I've heard about trees growing
in Brooklyn, but ferns in the biffy?

183
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,643
- Class.
- The idea came to me in a vision.

184
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,229
- Every morning, I luxuriate in my bath.
- I dig, man. You're on an ego trip.

185
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:59,524
But what about the ferns?

186
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:05,070
Let's call them tropical varieties.
They thrive on the humidity...

187
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:09,324
...and they never let me forget
that all Los Angeles is a jungle.

188
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,469
Hello. You must be Kelly's friends.
I'm Vanessa.

189
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:40,432
- Susan, Kelly's friends have arrived.
- We've heard so much about you.

190
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:45,519
- I'm Susan Lake, Kelly's aunt.
- Hi, Miss Lake. This is Pet...

191
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:48,438
...and Casey. And I'm Harris.

192
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:51,984
- Has anyone here seen Kelly?
- I saw her a minute ago with Ronnie.

193
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,235
- May I lead an expedition to the bar?
- No, thanks. I'll take a rain check.

194
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:58,738
How about you two?

195
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,002
Excuse me.

196
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:24,218
- You don't drink?
- Later.

197
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:28,387
Yeah, later.

198
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:30,639
- Vodka gimlets.
- Thank you.

199
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:33,684
I guess liquor's considered
kind of square these days.

200
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:37,227
Same as grass.
It depends on how you use it.

201
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:40,355
Would you like to meet
some of the more interesting specimens?

202
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:41,982
Why not?

203
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:47,360
- Casey?
- I'll stay here. Go on.

204
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,073
- Quite a blast.
- Quite.

205
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,075
I make it a point never to miss one
of Ronnie's parties. Better than the zoo.

206
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:58,494
Putting people down
for having a good time?

207
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:04,083
On the contrary, my dear. But this is
hardly my idea of a civilized good time.

208
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:09,837
Casey Anderson, huh?
No relation to Senator Casey Anderson?

209
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:11,297
He's my father.

210
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:14,466
I'll bet he's highly amused
that his daughter's a hippie?

211
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:19,178
- I'm in a rock group.
- And that's your uniform?

212
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:20,387
And that's yours?

213
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:24,058
At least it's not a uniform
worn by freaks.

214
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:29,561
So the senator's daughter
is a rock 'n' roll singer, huh?

215
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:36,358
Say, do you and your friends shack up
in a minibus, or aren't things that cozy?

216
00:20:56,874 --> 00:21:00,586
I couldn't help but notice
your little run-in with Porter Hall.

217
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:03,756
- Men.
- Ninety-nine percent.

218
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:07,758
Casey, I'd like to design something
for you.

219
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:10,094
Why don't you
stop by my studio sometime?

220
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,139
It's a trip to design for a good figure
once in a while.

221
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:20,936
Anyway, you could imagine
how this woman feels...

222
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:24,480
...when she finds out
that her 17-year-old son...

223
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:27,565
...is making it
with one of her best friends.

224
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:30,110
Now, you have to remember that she...

225
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:32,070
...has a young lover of her own.

226
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:35,280
So it makes her take
a long look at her whole scheme.

227
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:39,450
That's why in my new film,
they drag in this whole thing...

228
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:44,163
...about the lack of communication
between parents and kids.

229
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:03,262
Well, now, Harris, we meet again.

230
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:07,639
"Come into my den,"
said the spider, et cetera.

231
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:11,018
- I was looking for somebody.
- Anybody I know?

232
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:13,520
Where do you get this "anybody
I know" business?

233
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:16,730
From one of those pornographic
movies you star in?

234
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,652
You mean my controversial,
box-office blockbusters?

235
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:26,988
Ashley St. Ives.
I saw one of your movies once.

236
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:32,827
I think it was the one
about the teenage, incest triangle.

237
00:22:32,994 --> 00:22:37,788
You'll have to help me
on the research for the next one.

238
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:42,460
- So you're an ear freak?
- Name some more.

239
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:48,172
All right, then.
How about a toe freak?

240
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,718
I need it. I want it.

241
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:57,054
A beautiful woman
kissing me between the toes.

242
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,183
People who wear sandals
must not get very many volunteers.

243
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,644
- I could change.
- Into something more titillating?

244
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,147
That sounds vaguely obscene.

245
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:14,859
You're a groovy boy.
I'd like to strap you on sometime.

246
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:20,949
And if there's anything I can't stand,
it's vagueness.

247
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:24,035
Harris.

248
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:28,913
A deathly dry gin martini.

249
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:54,392
But I thought we had
another case of scotch.

250
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,142
Excuse me, have you seen Kelly?

251
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,938
No, the last time I saw her
she was wandering around with Z-Man.

252
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,731
- They can be anywhere.
- Thanks.

253
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,732
Get yourself in gear, baby.
These people are dying of thirst.

254
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:07,819
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll check. Okay?

255
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:21,497
- But, Lance, I gave you $ 1200 last week.
- I want $ 12,000, baby.

256
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,710
- I'm sorry.
- Perfect timing.

257
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:30,379
I was looking for the john.

258
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:35,757
Z-Man Barzell is a very rich cat, but
he doesn't have a john in the kitchen.

259
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:39,052
- Maybe I was looking for a sandwich.
- This ain't no welfare line.

260
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:42,681
Then what are you standing in it for?

261
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,517
- Getting my thing together.
- You putting me on?

262
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:51,605
Unmasked again.
He poses as a busboy...

263
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:56,858
...but in real life,
he's Emerson Thorne...

264
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:59,861
...ambitious, young law student...

265
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:05,531
...who studies by day
and waits by night.

266
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:15,456
I was going to say something smart-ass,
but all of a sudden you know what?

267
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:17,082
No. What?

268
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,585
Suddenly, I knew you
weren't putting me on...

269
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:24,173
...that you were Emerson Thorne,
ambitious, young law student...

270
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,506
...and all that crap.

271
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:30,344
What about that kiss
and all that crap?

272
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:34,512
There's more where that came from,
Emerson Thorne.

273
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:38,850
You're into a heavy scene.
Don't sweat it. It can be a drag.

274
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,102
- Am I interrupting something?
- Harris!

275
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:43,897
Only a little make out session
between Count Dracula...

276
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:46,439
...and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley.
- Hey, man.

277
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:52,070
Ronnie Barzell, I'd like you
to meet Harris Allsworth, my...

278
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:54,446
- My manager.
- Manager, eh?

279
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:59,242
Any friend of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley
is a friend of mine.

280
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,246
- Manager?
- The Kelly Affair.

281
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:05,287
The Kelly Affair?

282
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:11,085
You mean, you're the Kelly?
Little did I suspect I was in the presence.

283
00:26:11,252 --> 00:26:14,213
Still, that name won't do, you know.
It's awfully 1950s.

284
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:18,340
- Might as well call them The Haircuts.
- Kelly, I'm ready to leave.

285
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:21,927
Leave? No. You have not yet
graced our gathering with a song.

286
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:25,971
Come, my dove. I must present you
to the faithful. Now!

287
00:26:27,514 --> 00:26:29,808
Ladies and gentlemen,
an announcement if you please.

288
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:32,185
There is a new rock group in the house.

289
00:26:32,352 --> 00:26:36,729
Their name, The Kelly Affair. Well, even
their best friends don't like their name.

290
00:26:36,938 --> 00:26:41,568
Still, as the teen tycoon of rock, I'd like
to hear them and I'm sure you would too.

291
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,112
The Kelly Affair.

292
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:54,994
I'd like to strap you on sometime.

293
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:48,377
Stop! Cool it! Cool it!

294
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:51,797
Masters and mistresses, I'm
so excited about what I've just heard...

295
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:56,341
...I predict these three, like
their sister before them, Carrie Nation...

296
00:28:56,508 --> 00:28:59,344
...will crush the musical barrier
and rise like angels.

297
00:28:59,678 --> 00:29:04,348
Did I say "like Carrie Nation"?
Nay, nay, they are The Carrie Nations.

298
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:07,934
You'll be superstars!

299
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:20,505
- We killed them, didn't we?
- You've reached the unreachable star...

300
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:24,092
...beat the unbeatable foe. The Times
and free-press critics will pay homage.

301
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:26,551
Ronnie, we owe everything to you, man!

302
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,928
My fine countess,
your melodious voice...

303
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:30,972
...surpasses the haunting pipes of Circe.

304
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:34,267
Beauteous Pet of triumph,
you were a thunderstorm.

305
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,100
Casey, mistress fair...

306
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:40,855
...this stringed assault has left
my ears fiercely vibrating. Majestic!

307
00:32:43,232 --> 00:32:46,317
- You played some funky drums out there.
- I'm glad you dug it.

308
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:49,403
- So, what's not to dig?
- Did you hear the wondrous miracle...

309
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,198
...wrought by my muses?
- You've done it again, Ronnie.

310
00:32:52,364 --> 00:32:53,532
Again and again.

311
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:57,868
Porter, methinks this brew is not
for your more delicate sensibilities.

312
00:32:58,035 --> 00:32:59,286
Courage, Camille.

313
00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:03,707
Excuse me. Casey, did you
hear the crowd? You were great.

314
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:05,707
- Thank you.
- Just great.

315
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:09,085
- I'm really happy.
- And you, the infamous Ashley St. Ives...

316
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:12,255
...high priestess of carnality,
what thinkest thou of our minstrels?

317
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:17,342
Congratulations, Ronnie.
They were heavy.

318
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,052
Make haste, my supple countess.

319
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:23,181
The last flight to Shangri-la
leaves within the hour. Hasten, hasten!

320
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:26,557
- Come on, Casey. Let's go.
- I'll talk to you later, okay?

321
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:30,061
Does not the moment
amuse you, Kracow?

322
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:36,398
Hasten, ere the portcullis
bars your entrance to Elsinore.

323
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:39,276
Here, let me help you.

324
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:43,113
- Pet, where's Emerson?
- Cramming for bar exams.

325
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,905
When are you two gonna shack up?

326
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:48,325
As soon as he can move me
into the law library.

327
00:33:49,576 --> 00:33:53,539
- Hey, there's another party at Z-Man's.
- So, what else is new?

328
00:33:53,747 --> 00:33:56,957
Like every night. Deal me out.

329
00:33:57,123 --> 00:34:00,252
- What's the matter, babe?
- Nothing. Just beat.

330
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:05,171
All I want is some peace and quiet,
and that's one thing Z-Man can't offer.

331
00:34:05,505 --> 00:34:09,050
Have a ball. I'll see you tomorrow.

332
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:10,677
Ciao.

333
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:22,603
- Good night.
- Case?

334
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:34,820
- Got anymore grass, man?
- I scored this afternoon.

335
00:34:34,987 --> 00:34:37,865
The cat swore up and down
it was Acapulco Gold.

336
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:42,870
- Lf we're lucky, maybe it's at least pot.
- Or we'll get an oregano high.

337
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:46,705
- Weren't you with Emerson all afternoon?
- I was.

338
00:34:46,872 --> 00:34:50,083
- I thought he was at the law library.
- He was.

339
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:53,336
So, like, when did you score, man?

340
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:57,338
Well, Emerson slipped me
a graduate-student pass.

341
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:03,261
I went back in the stacks to do some
research in the rare book collection.

342
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:08,556
- And who do I run into but my score?
- Cool, man. That's getting it together.

343
00:35:08,764 --> 00:35:12,226
- Yeah. See you later, Kel.
- Okay.

344
00:35:24,985 --> 00:35:27,988
- Hi, babe. Coming to the party tonight?
- What party?

345
00:35:28,155 --> 00:35:31,116
Everyone's splitting for Z-Man's.

346
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:34,868
- Everybody?
- You bugged, man?

347
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:37,871
- Yeah.
- What's the matter, baby?

348
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:40,624
- Things happened tonight.
- Sure.

349
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:45,293
- So?
- So where do I fit in, Kelly?

350
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:47,962
- I don't dig.
- There once was a time...

351
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:50,507
...maybe you can remember,
when I was your manager...

352
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:53,343
...not the next thing
to a goddamn groupie.

353
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:00,765
Come along to Z-Man's. Do you good.

354
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:02,683
Move it out, Kelly.

355
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:09,522
- Be right there.
- Roxie and I will meet you out by the car.

356
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,027
I gotta split, man.

357
00:36:21,573 --> 00:36:25,283
Say, Miss Mac Namara?

358
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,537
You were great.
You really turned them on.

359
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:30,664
Oh, thanks.

360
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:36,209
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Don't tell me your name. You're...

361
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:41,214
- Lance. Lance Rocke.
- That's it!

362
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:45,508
- Coming to the party at Z-Man's tonight?
- I...

363
00:36:45,716 --> 00:36:47,802
I don't know.

364
00:36:48,136 --> 00:36:50,263
What do you think, Miriam?
Feel like a party?

365
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,390
Not really, Lance.

366
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:57,476
Sounds divine,
but it's past my bedtime.

367
00:36:57,685 --> 00:36:59,812
That's a shame, Miriam.

368
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,274
It's gonna be so much fun.

369
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:07,943
- You sure?
- As sure as sure can be.

370
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:14,573
Well, at least let me call you a cab.

371
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,497
What do you say everybody?
Let's do it.

372
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:07,282
- Going my way?
- I'm skipping the party. I'm going home.

373
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:12,537
I'm skipping the party too. Why don't
you climb in, unless you have a ride.

374
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:16,331
- Don't put yourself out. I can hitch.
- We're going the same way.

375
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:21,044
Come on. Get in.

376
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:43,854
Turn left at the next street.

377
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,445
Mine's the one on the right
with the bright lights.

378
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,536
- So?
- Thanks a lot, Ashley.

379
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:06,329
Don't I even deserve a good night kiss?

380
00:39:29,557 --> 00:39:32,143
Let's go inside.

381
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:36,437
- What's wrong with the Rolls?
- Not when my bed's handy.

382
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:41,442
- I want you right here.
- At least we can park in the driveway.

383
00:40:17,553 --> 00:40:20,514
Now it's your move.

384
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:38,862
It's my first time in a Rolls.

385
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:41,114
There's nothing like a Rolls, Harris.

386
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:44,616
There's nothing like a Rolls.

387
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:47,202
Nothing. Nothing like a Rolls!

388
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:51,956
Not even a Bentley!
Not even a Bentley!

389
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:57,627
Bentley! Bentley!
It's like a Rolls. A Rolls!

390
00:40:58,044 --> 00:41:00,713
A Rolls!

391
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:04,466
You're beautiful, Kelly.

392
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:09,929
Kel, who's that Susan Lake broad?
What's her story?

393
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:14,723
- Susan Lake, my long-lost aunt.
- Aunt Susan?

394
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:19,353
That's far out.
She's a fine-looking lady.

395
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,815
Nice and firm.

396
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:28,276
Round and beautiful. Well, pneumatic.

397
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:32,197
- Aunt Susan?
- Yeah, Aunt Susan.

398
00:41:33,448 --> 00:41:39,119
- She'd flip out to hear you say that.
- I doubt it.

399
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:44,207
- Lance?
- Yeah?

400
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:48,668
- I'm thinking of cutting my hair.
- Well, don't.

401
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:50,336
Why not?

402
00:41:50,545 --> 00:41:52,422
I wanna love you for more than money.

403
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,256
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean, the millions.

404
00:41:55,423 --> 00:41:59,927
- The Lake millions.
- You know a lot about me, don't you?

405
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:04,056
- There's no secrets at Z-Man's.
- I gently suggested to Aunt Susan...

406
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:08,559
...that the millions could go screw.
- You what?

407
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,229
- You heard me.
- Wow, baby, that was really dumb.

408
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:14,521
And how come you're
only getting a third?

409
00:42:14,688 --> 00:42:17,023
You ought to be getting half,
and you know it.

410
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,609
- Why should I get anything at all?
- You earned it.

411
00:42:19,776 --> 00:42:24,321
Getting shafted all your life while all
those relatives lived it up in Worcester.

412
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:28,408
- You know a lot about my family.
- Like I say...

413
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:32,245
...there aren't many secrets
around here.

414
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:35,121
Kelly. Now listen, Kelly.

415
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:38,875
I'm gonna give you some free advice,
baby, and you'd better take it.

416
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:43,838
The noble Porter Hall is trying
to get his lunch hooks on that dough.

417
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:47,048
He's screwing you, baby,
not Susan Lake.

418
00:42:47,923 --> 00:42:49,842
That girl Kelly Mac Namara is a tramp.

419
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:52,928
She was living in a single room
with three other individuals.

420
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:55,095
One of them was a male.
And the other two?

421
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:57,056
Well, the other two were females.

422
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:59,391
God only knows what they
were up to in there.

423
00:42:59,558 --> 00:43:01,977
And furthermore,
I wouldn't be surprised to learn...

424
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:06,646
...that all four of them
habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes.

425
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:10,650
- Reefers.
- I'm Kelly Mac Namara, Ms. Lake's niece.

426
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:13,528
- Hi. I'm glad to know you.
- Thanks. She in? Can I see her?

427
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:14,903
I'll see.

428
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,447
- Miss Lake, Miss Mac Namara.
- Besides, if Kelly does turn on...

429
00:43:17,614 --> 00:43:20,325
- Send her in.
- You may go in now, Miss Mac Namara.

430
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:22,160
- Bye.
- Bye.

431
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,453
Now you try to contain yourself, Porter.

432
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:30,500
- I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- Come in, Kelly, Porter's all steamed up.

433
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:33,461
- Too much partying.
- You listen to me, hippie.

434
00:43:33,669 --> 00:43:36,045
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

435
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:39,590
...but if you don't withdraw your
morbid interest in Miss Lake's affairs...

436
00:43:39,757 --> 00:43:44,802
...I shall be forced to take legal action.
- Man, I doubt if you'd recognize a hippie.

437
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:46,345
I'm a capitalist, baby.

438
00:43:46,512 --> 00:43:49,765
I work for my living,
not suck off somebody else.

439
00:43:50,182 --> 00:43:53,769
Not a penny, Miss Mac Namara.
Not a single penny. I promise you that.

440
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:57,312
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- A tramp with the morals of an alley cat.

441
00:43:57,521 --> 00:44:01,316
- Up yours, ratso!
- Not a single penny. It's not her money.

442
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:04,693
Even if she is who she claims to be,
her behavior's disgusting.

443
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:08,571
- I'll take half a million dollars, man!
- What was that?

444
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:14,784
You heard me. Half a million dollars
and not a penny less.

445
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:19,247
How can you be so blind, Susan?
I met her type before.

446
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:23,918
The little innocent face and smile.
The little, sweet virgin-whore.

447
00:44:24,085 --> 00:44:27,003
Porter, why are you acting like this?
She's only a child!

448
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:29,255
It's got to be, Susan.

449
00:44:29,463 --> 00:44:33,509
It's gotta be half.
Half a million dollars.

450
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:38,053
Mom never wanted it,
but she should have had it.

451
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,763
That's the way it's gotta be.

452
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:43,600
Precedent for a defendant
waiving jury trial for a private hearing...

453
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:48,145
...in a case involving national security?

454
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:52,482
Talbott v. United States. Supreme
Court decision, 1917.

455
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:55,358
Amended 1941,
in the case of the government.

456
00:44:55,525 --> 00:45:00,280
Plaintiff v. Consolidated Industries
and defendant Robert F. Zonka.

457
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:05,199
Prejudice of jury alleged in case
involving alien national...?

458
00:45:05,408 --> 00:45:07,994
Enough. Tomorrow I'll study.

459
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:12,498
- Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.
- You sound like Z-Man.

460
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:18,502
And Z-Man sounds like Will Shakespeare.
Right now, I feel like making love.

461
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,606
She loves me,
she loves me not.

462
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,732
What is this, Tammy and the Lawyer?

463
00:45:45,899 --> 00:45:48,485
If I don't dig you,
how come I'm making it with you?

464
00:45:48,652 --> 00:45:52,822
Because I'm the ballsiest cat
you ever did meet.

465
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:55,031
What did you say
before you lost your cool?

466
00:45:55,406 --> 00:45:58,451
Because I'm the ballsiest cat
you ever did meet.

467
00:45:58,618 --> 00:45:59,702
Right on!

468
00:46:41,486 --> 00:46:47,907
Kelly? I mean Miss Mac Namara.
Good morning. Porter Hall here.

469
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:50,076
Hello?

470
00:46:50,284 --> 00:46:54,371
- Who was it, baby?
- Porter Hall.

471
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,920
- See what the ace has got to say.
- We were cut off.

472
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:06,630
I'm terribly sorry about that scene
in Susan 's office yesterday.

473
00:47:06,797 --> 00:47:09,717
Certainly, I never remotely intended
to give the impression...

474
00:47:09,883 --> 00:47:11,010
...I must have left.

475
00:47:11,218 --> 00:47:14,220
There are so many things I feel
we have in common...

476
00:47:14,387 --> 00:47:17,389
...that I'd appreciate it very much
if we could have a drink...

477
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:20,559
...perhaps sometime this afternoon
and discuss them.

478
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:23,061
Have the drink. Go ahead.

479
00:47:24,021 --> 00:47:28,273
- Okay, Mr. Hall.
- Excellent. That pleases me very much.

480
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:34,861
- And where shall we meet?
- Tell him O'Rourke's. O'Rourke's.

481
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:37,739
- O'Rourke's.
- O'Rourke's?

482
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:40,992
- Yeah, near City College.
- Fine. And at what time?

483
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:47,580
- 3:00, I guess. Tell him 3.
- I'll be there about 3.

484
00:47:47,747 --> 00:47:51,667
See you then. Bye.

485
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:57,171
You did good, beautiful.

486
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:08,722
You know the mother's up to something.
Here's your chance to really shaft him.

487
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,600
Think so?

488
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,728
I know so.

489
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:27,403
I'll be out of here by 3,
in case you need the place.

490
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,616
Why do I do everything you tell me?

491
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:37,036
I don't know. Why do you?

492
00:48:37,244 --> 00:48:40,915
I can't help myself.
You've made me into a whore.

493
00:48:41,082 --> 00:48:43,834
And you dig it, you little freak.

494
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:47,628
Kelly, I'm so pleased
that you agreed to meet me.

495
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:51,924
That scene yesterday? I've already told
you how perfectly dreadful I feel about it.

496
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:56,176
I made certain allegations
that I can only deeply apologize for.

497
00:48:56,385 --> 00:48:57,636
- ID?
- I'm having a coffee.

498
00:48:57,803 --> 00:49:01,640
A very dry vodka martini for me.
Make it a double, please.

499
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:04,683
Of course we've had our
misunderstandings, but who hasn't?

500
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:10,063
I believe they call it the generation gap.
In my day, they called it something else.

501
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:14,233
I can remember when my father raised
the dickens over me. I was a devil then.

502
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:20,280
Came home in a pinch-back suit. He
thought I'd gone the way of Oscar Wilde.

503
00:49:21,072 --> 00:49:24,865
- That'll be $ 1.20.
- Start a tab for me, will you please?

504
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,327
- Would you like something stronger?
- They don't serve it in bars.

505
00:49:28,494 --> 00:49:30,121
Hey, got a quarter?

506
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,256
Perhaps it's just as well.

507
00:49:54,223 --> 00:49:59,311
In any event, I didn't ask you
to meet me today simply to apologize.

508
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:04,772
I also wanted to discuss this financial
misunderstanding we're enmeshed in.

509
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:09,527
Now, as Miss Lake's adviser,
I have her best interests at heart.

510
00:50:09,736 --> 00:50:12,488
However, I want to suggest
a business arrangement...

511
00:50:12,655 --> 00:50:17,867
...an arrangement that would be
the greatest benefit to all concerned.

512
00:50:18,034 --> 00:50:21,287
Now, I've taken the liberty
of drawing up this document.

513
00:50:21,454 --> 00:50:26,415
By which, in return for the handsome
consideration of $50,000 immediately...

514
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:32,254
...you would agree to discontinue,
or should I say, no longer press charges.

515
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,589
Kelly.

516
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:41,136
- Kelly, please let me finish.
- You are finished, cheap swindler.

517
00:50:41,303 --> 00:50:44,221
You and Susan Lake
and your documents.

518
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:47,933
Wait. I assure you, Susan Lake
had absolutely no knowledge of this.

519
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:53,063
Congratulations. I didn't think you had
the balls to go sneaking behind her back.

520
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:57,398
- Kelly, please.
- Oh, get!

521
00:51:08,824 --> 00:51:11,369
McHugh, throw me a bar rag.

522
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:15,037
- A clean one.
- Coming at you.

523
00:51:22,836 --> 00:51:26,797
Porter, I'm sorry I lost my temper.

524
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:31,718
It was my fault bringing you here.
Tell you what...

525
00:51:31,885 --> 00:51:38,098
...let's go to my place. We can talk
some more about your document.

526
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,654
- Want some?
- What is it?

527
00:51:56,821 --> 00:52:01,575
Oh, Porter.
You mean you don't know what it is?

528
00:52:06,078 --> 00:52:09,832
Of course I know what it is.

529
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:16,628
Porter, don't waste it!
Look, look, let me show you.

530
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:20,549
Draw in. That's it. Hold it here.

531
00:52:20,757 --> 00:52:23,510
That's it. Now blow it out.

532
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:28,263
Let me show you. Look. Like this.

533
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:38,021
See? Now you do it.

534
00:52:38,313 --> 00:52:42,483
See? Deep down. Deep down here.

535
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,443
Porter, you're so cute.

536
00:52:47,278 --> 00:52:51,574
I think I'll change into something
more comfortable.

537
00:53:00,372 --> 00:53:03,792
Hang cool, teddy bear.

538
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:48,369
Why don't you lose your laundry, Porter?

539
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:04,547
Come on, Porter.
You're taking so much time.

540
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:08,760
Hurry, Porter.

541
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:36,156
Porter, really.
Wearing your underwear to bed?

542
00:54:36,365 --> 00:54:39,994
I'll help you. Come on.

543
00:54:40,202 --> 00:54:45,122
Hey, have you got lead in your...?
There.

544
00:54:56,172 --> 00:55:01,386
- Kelly?
- Yes, Porter?

545
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:09,058
Never mind, Porter.

546
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:12,812
If you don't tell Aunt Susan, I won't.

547
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,984
A toast, a toast, my friends,
to The Carrie Nations...

548
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:25,154
...and to their first golden record.
Long may they reign.

549
00:55:30,576 --> 00:55:33,621
So that's the pole-vaulter?

550
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:38,123
Between that and those little pills,
you won't be good for anything.

551
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:44,253
Ashley's got a better idea.

552
00:55:58,806 --> 00:56:01,559
Now you're inviting motor psychos
to your parties.

553
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:04,103
What next, truck drivers
and longshoremen?

554
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:09,065
You mean really rough trade?
Never mind.

555
00:56:10,274 --> 00:56:12,944
I hope Kelly knows
what she's getting into.

556
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,779
- Lance Rocke is no Prince Valiant.
- They deserve each other.

557
00:56:18,656 --> 00:56:21,075
- Where's Emerson, pussycat?
- Bar exams, as usual.

558
00:56:21,283 --> 00:56:26,453
That's gratitude. I promote him to waiter
and he decides to be a lawyer instead.

559
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:30,290
- Still, some good came of it. He met you.
- Thank you.

560
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:34,960
This should be fascinating.
See the cat in the Brooks Brothers suit?

561
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,837
Who is he?
He looks straight for this crowd.

562
00:56:38,004 --> 00:56:39,548
His name is Baxter Wolfe.

563
00:56:39,714 --> 00:56:42,092
You've treated her like this
since meeting her.

564
00:56:42,259 --> 00:56:46,219
She's after your money. Nothing you
can say will change my opinion.

565
00:56:46,386 --> 00:56:49,013
They were in love for years.
He proposed to her once...

566
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,225
...but it was the wrong moment.
- As your legal adviser...

567
00:56:52,392 --> 00:56:54,851
...let me handle this
in my own discreet way.

568
00:56:55,017 --> 00:56:58,855
I've already seen a display of your
discretion. It's reminiscent of a meat ax.

569
00:56:59,146 --> 00:57:01,357
- She doesn't know he's in Hollywood.
- Really?

570
00:57:01,524 --> 00:57:05,734
- Baxter Wolfe.
- Hello, Ronnie.

571
00:57:06,277 --> 00:57:08,195
Hello, Susan.

572
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:11,240
Baxter, I'd like you
to meet Petronella Danforth.

573
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:15,701
- And this is Porter Hall.
- Glad to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

574
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,370
- How have you been, Susan?
- Okay.

575
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:21,665
I hear you're doing quite well
in the advertising field.

576
00:57:21,832 --> 00:57:25,709
- Yes, Baxter.
- We seem to be interrupting a reunion.

577
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:28,503
- May I escort you to the bar?
- I want a daiquiri.

578
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,590
Could you get away for a few minutes?
I'd like to talk to you.

579
00:57:36,759 --> 00:57:38,845
- It's been three years.
- Doesn't matter.

580
00:57:39,012 --> 00:57:41,806
I'm still in love with you, Susan.
I always have been.

581
00:57:42,015 --> 00:57:45,308
I've changed. I'm no longer the guy
who swore he'd never marry.

582
00:57:45,474 --> 00:57:46,767
I heard you were engaged.

583
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:49,520
Now that you mention it,
I suppose I am engaged.

584
00:57:49,729 --> 00:57:53,274
Or should I say, I was engaged?

585
00:57:53,482 --> 00:57:57,276
I only seriously proposed marriage
once in my life, Susan.

586
00:57:57,568 --> 00:58:00,321
And the offer still stands.

587
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:18,543
Z-Man really has a spread.
I heard it cost half a million.

588
00:58:18,752 --> 00:58:22,130
- Is that all?
- Well, it's a lot of bread to me.

589
00:58:22,339 --> 00:58:25,548
- Hey, Rockey baby!
- Hey, man. What's happening?

590
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:27,967
Get over here
and have a drink on me!

591
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:30,261
Double Johnny Walker
on the rocks for my man.

592
00:58:30,428 --> 00:58:32,597
- Red label or black?
- Black.

593
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:35,932
For my blue-eyed soul brother.
Lance, how you been doing, baby?

594
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,935
Hey, you still balling that rich chick
with the knockers?

595
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,395
Here's another one
in case you ever run out.

596
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:44,397
Goddamn it, Randy,
I haven't seen you in six months, man.

597
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,815
- How the hell you been?
- Making it, baby.

598
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:51,195
Wait a minute, since last I saw you,
you won the heavyweight championship.

599
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:52,988
- Congratulations!
- Thanks, baby.

600
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:56,865
- Digging it, champ?
- Miss Kelly Mac Namara.

601
00:58:57,032 --> 00:59:01,370
Miss Petronella Danforth.
Meet Randy Black. We call him The Man.

602
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:04,704
Two-thirds of my latest creation, champ.
The Carrie Nations.

603
00:59:04,913 --> 00:59:07,707
What are you doing here alone, baby?
Making a last stand?

604
00:59:07,874 --> 00:59:10,418
Don't worry about me.
I got a real nice old man.

605
00:59:10,585 --> 00:59:12,796
If you've got a nice old man,
where is he now?

606
00:59:13,004 --> 00:59:16,840
He's studying for a bar exam,
if that makes any difference to you.

607
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:19,133
Well, that changes everything.

608
00:59:19,509 --> 00:59:21,177
- He a brother?
- Right on.

609
00:59:21,344 --> 00:59:23,847
Then it's my duty to get you
out on this dance floor...

610
00:59:24,013 --> 00:59:27,390
...and keep you all nice...

611
00:59:27,557 --> 00:59:29,684
...and easy for him.

612
00:59:35,437 --> 00:59:38,440
- Where is Casey?
- I phoned her, but she crashed.

613
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:41,986
The champion of the world.
I haven't seen him for six months.

614
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:01,585
Come on, Ashley.
We're on the goddamn sand.

615
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:05,587
- So?
- Somebody could step on us.

616
01:00:05,753 --> 01:00:11,759
- That would be a gas, Harris.
- Phone booth. On a billiard table.

617
01:00:11,926 --> 01:00:16,304
Swinging from a chandelier.
Standing up in a canoe.

618
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:20,892
There's more to life
than the classic position.

619
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:25,186
Would you cool it, Ashley?
Hey, let's make it in a bed for a change.

620
01:00:25,352 --> 01:00:30,649
- That'd be kind of freaky.
- Harris, I can't wait.

621
01:00:35,777 --> 01:00:40,240
Harris, you're so square.
You kids are supposed to be swingers.

622
01:00:40,449 --> 01:00:42,784
I think it'd be a gas
to make love on the beach.

623
01:00:42,993 --> 01:00:47,621
What does sex amount to without guilt?
That's what Sigmund Freud says.

624
01:00:47,787 --> 01:00:50,790
Take away the guilt,
and who'd ever want to get laid?

625
01:00:50,957 --> 01:00:54,626
Why the hell don't you
lay Sigmund Freud?

626
01:01:01,007 --> 01:01:05,593
Harris, you're drunk and you're stoned.
And the worst of it is...

627
01:01:05,802 --> 01:01:10,181
...you're a lousy lay.
You'll never get into one of my films...

628
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:13,392
...unless maybe as a hairdresser.

629
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:16,393
- What do you mean?
- Kinder to tell you now, lover.

630
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:23,067
Maybe it's not too late for you
to find some nice, tender boy.

631
01:01:51,214 --> 01:01:53,550
Kelly!

632
01:01:57,635 --> 01:01:59,220
- Harris?
- Hey.

633
01:01:59,387 --> 01:02:04,391
I said, hey!
The lady's made her choice, loser.

634
01:02:08,435 --> 01:02:11,647
Baby, get up! Attaboy. Come on.
There you go.

635
01:02:11,814 --> 01:02:14,399
Come on, get up. Attaboy, come on.

636
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:19,611
Let's go. I referee fights, man.
Get up. Come on.

637
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:22,990
Don't choke him, pick him up.
Come on, hold him.

638
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,866
Stick him, Lance. Hit him.

639
01:02:26,032 --> 01:02:28,785
- Come on, man.
- The outcome is inevitable.

640
01:02:28,994 --> 01:02:33,957
The golden gladiator
must emerge victorious.

641
01:02:46,549 --> 01:02:50,553
- Lance, stop it. You've hurt him enough.
- He hit on me!

642
01:03:07,191 --> 01:03:10,027
Big lover.

643
01:03:10,194 --> 01:03:13,280
Big man.

644
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:16,490
Dandy, Lance.

645
01:03:17,032 --> 01:03:20,535
How's she getting home?

646
01:03:20,702 --> 01:03:23,330
It's her car.

647
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:27,123
We could have used you
at the Russian front.

648
01:03:27,624 --> 01:03:34,379
What I see is beyond your dreaming.

649
01:03:37,089 --> 01:03:39,342
Miss Mac Namara...

650
01:03:39,509 --> 01:03:42,178
...remember.

651
01:03:42,762 --> 01:03:46,639
Mr. Hall!

652
01:03:52,812 --> 01:03:57,940
Take your $50,000, lover.

653
01:04:04,153 --> 01:04:06,446
- What have you done to Kelly?
- She attacked me.

654
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:12,702
- I find that very difficult to believe.
- Must you continue defending her?

655
01:04:12,869 --> 01:04:17,789
Susan, I think this concerns you.

656
01:04:19,249 --> 01:04:21,709
I never wanna see you again.

657
01:04:21,876 --> 01:04:26,838
- Well, as your legal adviser...
- You'd better leave, Hall.

658
01:04:35,302 --> 01:04:39,390
- The way he humiliated Kelly...
- Hold on, honey.

659
01:04:39,682 --> 01:04:41,392
You can't help her right now.

660
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:44,726
This is something she'll
have to work out for herself.

661
01:04:44,893 --> 01:04:48,522
- But...
- No, baby, no. Not now.

662
01:04:48,689 --> 01:04:52,317
Just leave it.
That's the trouble with people today.

663
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:55,944
All uptight about tomorrow.
Hanging onto yesterday.

664
01:04:56,111 --> 01:04:59,322
It's no good. No good at all.

665
01:04:59,489 --> 01:05:03,452
There's only one time that counts.
Now. Right now.

666
01:05:03,618 --> 01:05:10,373
If you don't live for now, you might
as well roll over and take the full count.

667
01:05:10,748 --> 01:05:17,044
So, what are you,
the heavyweight philosopher?

668
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:19,422
Just try me.

669
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:23,176
Really a fine performance, Lance.
Superb.

670
01:05:23,384 --> 01:05:27,178
Nice little party
and you chop up the chick's boyfriend.

671
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:29,889
Boyfriend?

672
01:05:31,015 --> 01:05:33,684
Boyfriend?
Now listen, Barzell...

673
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:37,853
...I don't know where everybody's
getting this boyfriend crap.

674
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,064
But the chick's been sleeping with me.
You got it?

675
01:05:41,315 --> 01:05:45,484
Knowing you, I'm sure she has.
Have you run an audit on her books yet?

676
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:49,362
Or are you still screwing on faith?

677
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:52,699
You know, I don't like the tone
of your voice.

678
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:54,616
- Don't like it?
- No, I don't like it.

679
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:58,161
It's a shame you narrowed your field.
You'd make a great switch hitter.

680
01:05:58,328 --> 01:06:03,833
I'm all alone tonight. It appears that you
are too. So why don't the two of us...?

681
01:06:08,628 --> 01:06:12,632
This really isn't your night,
is it, pussycat?

682
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,157
- Who is it?
- It's me, Harris. Can I come in?

683
01:06:52,872 --> 01:06:55,706
Thanks, Casey.

684
01:06:58,418 --> 01:07:00,670
What happened to you?

685
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:05,631
Okay, the silent bit.

686
01:07:07,049 --> 01:07:09,176
Pour me one too, will you?

687
01:07:16,723 --> 01:07:19,476
You want a downer?

688
01:07:21,228 --> 01:07:22,646
- Casey?
- I'm here.

689
01:07:22,855 --> 01:07:25,313
- Ashley called me a fag.
- Oh, that's a lot crap.

690
01:07:25,522 --> 01:07:28,650
I don't know.
I don't know. I just don't know.

691
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:31,570
You need some rest.

692
01:07:32,446 --> 01:07:36,740
- Juice. It's a bad trip.
- What are you, my mother?

693
01:07:36,906 --> 01:07:39,951
I'm your friend!

694
01:07:41,578 --> 01:07:44,746
I don't mean to dump on you, Casey.

695
01:07:44,912 --> 01:07:48,833
You get mixed up with these people
and two weeks later, you're an alcoholic.

696
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:51,586
There are juice freaks
and there are pill freaks.

697
01:07:51,753 --> 01:07:56,213
And everybody's a freak.
What you need is grass or a downer.

698
01:07:56,422 --> 01:08:00,968
- All I wanna do is rap.
- Then rap. What is this faggot business?

699
01:08:01,135 --> 01:08:02,762
She said I'm a lousy lay too.

700
01:08:02,928 --> 01:08:06,305
Then I went into the house
and made a bigger ass of myself.

701
01:08:15,353 --> 01:08:17,814
Medicine.

702
01:08:27,822 --> 01:08:32,952
- Can I sleep with you tonight?
- Sure. I've got all the room in the world.

703
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:41,459
- Still uptight?
- Don't you understand?

704
01:08:41,626 --> 01:08:45,419
Kelly and Harris, they're my friends.

705
01:08:45,628 --> 01:08:50,549
You're a bleeder. What you need
is an old man who's always handy.

706
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:54,135
- Is that your old man?
- Emerson!

707
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:04,810
Emerson, you were gonna study.
But you said you were going to study!

708
01:09:13,318 --> 01:09:19,364
- I guess he didn't take it too well.
- Get out. Get out of here!

709
01:09:27,578 --> 01:09:31,541
- Get out!
- All you want is a little action...

710
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:34,209
...and every time there's a hassle.

711
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:10,989
You're in my way, man. Again.

712
01:10:11,156 --> 01:10:15,908
Move your ass out of the way, son.
Son of a bitch, get the hell out of there!

713
01:10:22,415 --> 01:10:26,375
You either move your ass, boy,
or I'll move it for you!

714
01:10:29,211 --> 01:10:34,050
Get me off of here, you bastard!
You stupid bastard!

715
01:10:34,257 --> 01:10:36,842
Stop this car!

716
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:40,095
Oh, my God!

717
01:10:40,262 --> 01:10:43,682
Stupid son of a bitch, stop the damn car!

718
01:10:43,891 --> 01:10:48,060
- What's the matter with you?
- I can fix you once and for all!

719
01:11:01,321 --> 01:11:06,908
Oh, my God, Emerson. Oh, my God.

720
01:11:07,075 --> 01:11:10,370
- It's all right.
- I didn't mean it.

721
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:15,748
I'm such a fool. I love you.
I love you.

722
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:33,889
You bastard. You lousy bastard!

723
01:11:35,472 --> 01:11:38,433
Was it good? Did you enjoy yourself?

724
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,978
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Goddamn it, you're like the rest.

725
01:11:42,437 --> 01:11:45,397
- Casey, like I was...
- Just shut up!

726
01:11:45,605 --> 01:11:48,191
Get out of here!

727
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,095
Hello?

728
01:12:25,303 --> 01:12:27,639
Hello?

729
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:34,935
Where to, amigo?

730
01:15:15,023 --> 01:15:19,986
That's funny, man.
Seriously, though, folks...

731
01:15:20,278 --> 01:15:23,239
...where would we be today
without the great Z-Man Barzell?

732
01:15:23,406 --> 01:15:25,573
Without Z-Man, where would anyone be?

733
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:29,076
You know, sometimes I think he's
secretly the president.

734
01:15:29,243 --> 01:15:33,414
- You kids gonna sing a song for us now?
- Try and stop us, Gordon.

735
01:15:33,622 --> 01:15:38,083
It's the title song of our new album,
Looking up at the Bottom.

736
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:40,294
- Let's play "Find lt."
- "Find it"?

737
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:43,964
It would be a way
to say thank you to someone.

738
01:15:44,464 --> 01:15:46,590
For old time's sake?

739
01:15:48,592 --> 01:15:52,429
- Casey?
- I don't mind. I can handle it.

740
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:58,516
Well, looks like there's
a slight change of plan.

741
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:01,936
We'd like to do a number
that's not in the album.

742
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,729
It's never been performed on live TV.

743
01:16:04,937 --> 01:16:10,026
- It's called "Find lt."
- "Find lt." Why not? If you can.

744
01:16:10,234 --> 01:16:14,030
Ladies and gentlemen, The Carrie Nations
singing, for the first time on TV...

745
01:16:14,196 --> 01:16:15,905
..."Find lt."

746
01:16:52,018 --> 01:16:54,061
- Cut! Cut!
- No, don't listen to that man!

747
01:16:54,228 --> 01:16:56,688
Keep those cameras rolling!

748
01:16:57,105 --> 01:17:01,067
- I don't know what happened here.
- Call an ambulance!

749
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:04,403
Get away from him!
Leave him alone!

750
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:09,198
He's seems still, very motionless.
No, he's moving just a little bit.

751
01:17:09,407 --> 01:17:11,450
- Oh, my God.
- He's alive.

752
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:14,327
Don't move him anymore.
I'll get an ambulance.

753
01:17:15,286 --> 01:17:17,788
Keep them moving.
Keep the cameras moving.

754
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:23,836
I've been so full of crap
right from the beginning.

755
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:26,545
It wasn't enough for me
to mess up my own life...

756
01:17:26,753 --> 01:17:29,631
...but to screw up Harris'...
- Kelly, everyone's guilty.

757
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:34,968
- But he's still alive, isn't he?
- Sometimes you learn too late.

758
01:17:35,176 --> 01:17:39,806
- I don't give a damn! It's still my fault!
- Don't blame yourself, Kelly.

759
01:17:40,015 --> 01:17:42,225
What happened to Harris happened
for reasons...

760
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:43,935
...you don't know anything about.

761
01:17:44,101 --> 01:17:49,480
- What the hell do you know about it?
- I'm going to have his baby.

762
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,693
You Mr. Allsworth's friends?
I'm Dr. Scholl.

763
01:17:55,860 --> 01:18:00,197
Regrettably, we have discovered
traumatic shock to the spinal column...

764
01:18:00,364 --> 01:18:03,409
...resulting in massive nerve dysfunction.

765
01:18:03,576 --> 01:18:07,411
However, in a very small percentage
of these cases...

766
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:10,497
...there is spontaneous repair
of the damaged tissue.

767
01:18:10,664 --> 01:18:14,001
But you must remember,
this is extremely rare.

768
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:18,003
With proper rehabilitation, there is every
reason to believe that the patient...

769
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,047
...will adjust, be useful...

770
01:18:20,213 --> 01:18:24,258
...and yes, have a rewarding life
as a paraplegic.

771
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:29,346
You're just gonna have to relax.
I can't even move you.

772
01:18:31,056 --> 01:18:33,475
How's that, Casey?

773
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:37,060
- Roxanne, l...
- Jeanine, would you excuse us?

774
01:18:37,226 --> 01:18:39,020
- Surely.
- Thank you.

775
01:18:39,312 --> 01:18:45,566
- Come on, let's have it.
- Roxanne, I'm pregnant.

776
01:18:46,484 --> 01:18:50,988
- How long?
- Two months.

777
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:54,865
- You sure? Maybe you're just late.
- The lab report came yesterday...

778
01:18:55,032 --> 01:18:58,661
You have one of the more
common Hollywood problems.

779
01:18:58,869 --> 01:19:03,165
- I know a doctor that can help you.
- I don't want an abortion.

780
01:19:03,374 --> 01:19:06,083
I want this baby.

781
01:19:06,249 --> 01:19:08,794
It belongs to Harris.

782
01:19:09,169 --> 01:19:12,214
- To Harris?
- Yes.

783
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:15,507
But how can you be sure?

784
01:19:17,676 --> 01:19:22,264
He's been the only one for months.
He dropped by one night.

785
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:26,099
He was drunk and I was stoned.

786
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:29,435
- You're determined to have the baby?
- I have to.

787
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:33,314
After what happened, this could be the
only child Harris could ever conceive.

788
01:19:33,481 --> 01:19:38,067
And you feel loyalty
toward a man who raped you...

789
01:19:38,234 --> 01:19:39,860
...when you were unconscious?

790
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:42,947
It's crazy, but in a funny way I do.

791
01:19:43,114 --> 01:19:45,322
It's the child of a man you never loved...

792
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,825
...conceived in a moment
you don't even remember.

793
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:52,037
- That's easy to say.
- And there's your parents to think about.

794
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:57,291
Your father. How will it affect
his career in the Senate?

795
01:19:57,457 --> 01:19:58,875
I haven't thought about him...

796
01:19:59,042 --> 01:20:02,004
- Does Harris know?
- No.

797
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:05,130
Pet and Kelly do, though.

798
01:20:05,297 --> 01:20:10,594
One thing's certain, they aren't
going to volunteer the information.

799
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,221
Not now.

800
01:20:13,388 --> 01:20:18,891
Casey, it's only your problem.

801
01:20:22,145 --> 01:20:24,562
- But the baby...
- The doctor is ready.

802
01:20:24,729 --> 01:20:28,608
- Couldn't I just have one of my dolls?
- Not before, it could be dangerous.

803
01:20:28,816 --> 01:20:30,026
Come on. Come on.

804
01:20:32,778 --> 01:20:34,987
You'll have to wait here, miss.

805
01:20:36,572 --> 01:20:39,992
Miss Smith, this is Dr. Downs.

806
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:44,870
Miss Smith. There's really nothing
to worry about at all.

807
01:20:45,078 --> 01:20:47,539
You'll be just as good as new.

808
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:52,836
- How about another?
- No, ma'am. Why don't you have one?

809
01:20:53,045 --> 01:20:55,962
You trying to talk me off my diet?

810
01:20:58,798 --> 01:21:02,302
What are you waiting for? You'll be late
for class. Expecting company?

811
01:21:02,469 --> 01:21:05,345
- Not company, roses.
- Roses?

812
01:21:05,553 --> 01:21:09,307
This is our anniversary.
We've been engaged exactly one week.

813
01:21:09,515 --> 01:21:12,310
I didn't think you'd remember.

814
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:16,020
That'll be them now.

815
01:21:19,523 --> 01:21:22,068
Well, El Buckaroo.

816
01:21:22,235 --> 01:21:25,736
I was hoping I'd find you here
to personally thank you...

817
01:21:25,903 --> 01:21:31,116
...for those 30 days in the bucket.
- Who is it, Emerson? The delivery...

818
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,494
...boy?
- Right on.

819
01:21:33,661 --> 01:21:38,038
- What was it you wanted delivered?
- What the hell are you doing here?

820
01:21:38,205 --> 01:21:40,374
Just making a little house call.

821
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:43,543
My last one got sidetracked
by assault and battery.

822
01:21:43,752 --> 01:21:48,171
- Randy, please don't cause any trouble.
- Trouble?

823
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:51,549
- You got any jam?
- Randy, please leave.

824
01:21:51,758 --> 01:21:53,927
- No jam at all.
- Man, I think you better leave.

825
01:21:54,134 --> 01:21:58,096
Don't you bother about me.
I'll just fix me a little snack.

826
01:21:58,304 --> 01:22:01,849
I'm used to it. You see, I don't have
a chick to fix breakfast for me.

827
01:22:02,058 --> 01:22:06,018
- So I just fix a little snack of my own.
- Emerson, let me handle this.

828
01:22:06,227 --> 01:22:11,774
Now that's real cool advice. Since you're
in charge, where should we start?

829
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:13,401
Get the hell out of here, man.

830
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:17,152
I just don't understand
your change of mood, lady.

831
01:22:17,319 --> 01:22:22,116
Now, the last time I was up here,
you were in a whole different bag.

832
01:22:22,324 --> 01:22:25,325
I remember that night so clearly.

833
01:22:25,534 --> 01:22:28,161
- You were so good...
- I said get the hell...!

834
01:22:28,912 --> 01:22:31,623
Why, Randy? Why?

835
01:22:31,832 --> 01:22:35,500
Come now, little lady,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

836
01:22:35,667 --> 01:22:37,878
- I love him.
- Nothing at all.

837
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:41,923
- Why can't you leave us alone?
- Come to Papa.

838
01:22:44,632 --> 01:22:46,467
Why you little...

839
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:56,058
You touch him and I'll cut you!
Bastard.

840
01:22:57,184 --> 01:22:59,186
Now, ain't that just the luck?

841
01:22:59,353 --> 01:23:01,814
And here I am without a good cut man
in my corner.

842
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:06,692
I sure could use old Dan Florio right now,
because without the cut man...

843
01:23:06,859 --> 01:23:11,030
...I might get a little slice under the eye.
Don't mean anything.

844
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:17,075
It'd stop the fight.
It don't seem reasonable somehow.

845
01:23:29,544 --> 01:23:31,755
I'm throwing in the towel.

846
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:34,256
Roxanne, you've been so kind.

847
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:37,884
I don't know who else
would have been so wonderful.

848
01:23:38,301 --> 01:23:41,054
I need you very much.

849
01:24:12,329 --> 01:24:13,914
Checkmate.

850
01:24:14,704 --> 01:24:16,831
There is no way I can move.

851
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:21,086
- Another game?
- Not just now. Maybe a little later.

852
01:24:35,221 --> 01:24:40,434
- How do you feel today?
- All right. Maybe a little better.

853
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:44,603
- Is all the stiffness gone?
- Pretty much so.

854
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:48,357
Look, Kelly, don't feel you have to
stay around here and keep me company.

855
01:24:48,524 --> 01:24:51,068
You must have a thousand things to do.

856
01:24:52,611 --> 01:24:57,614
I don't have anything to do that's more
important than this, Harris. Dig?

857
01:24:57,948 --> 01:25:01,535
You're racing through life
full steam ahead, not giving a damn...

858
01:25:01,702 --> 01:25:04,370
...then something happens
to make you stop short.

859
01:25:04,536 --> 01:25:07,622
And you realize that people
are what count.

860
01:25:07,789 --> 01:25:10,792
You're important to me, Harris.

861
01:25:12,085 --> 01:25:15,086
- I'm available too.
- Swell, Lance. Very good.

862
01:25:15,295 --> 01:25:18,840
Why don't you high over to my place
about 9:00 tonight?

863
01:25:19,007 --> 01:25:21,301
Lance?

864
01:25:22,844 --> 01:25:26,179
- No way, lady.
- Lance?

865
01:25:26,345 --> 01:25:29,891
Yeah. I'll see you tonight.

866
01:25:32,476 --> 01:25:35,853
Hello, Roxanne? Why don 't you drop
over to my place about 9:00 tonight?

867
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:39,773
Bring your little girl. I'm in the mood
for one of my special private parties.

868
01:25:39,982 --> 01:25:44,068
Since I'd already proposed to her once,
I figured it was just a waste of time.

869
01:25:44,235 --> 01:25:46,153
Oh, Baxter.

870
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,865
And strictly as an afterthought,
it occurred to me that...

871
01:25:50,032 --> 01:25:51,617
...I loved her.

872
01:25:51,783 --> 01:25:55,869
Our generation fights the sex revolution
and they get married.

873
01:25:56,161 --> 01:25:57,329
Ain't that the truth.

874
01:25:57,495 --> 01:25:59,706
Are you sure you won't stay
and have dinner?

875
01:25:59,915 --> 01:26:04,460
No, thanks. I'd say yes, but tonight
calls for champagne and candlelight.

876
01:26:05,084 --> 01:26:09,714
A toast, a toast, my friends,
to our health and cheer and happiness.

877
01:26:10,089 --> 01:26:13,426
Otto, let the ritual begin.

878
01:26:20,556 --> 01:26:25,434
Well done, vassal. Pray, be excused. We
have no further need of your services.

879
01:26:25,643 --> 01:26:28,562
Make sure you turn off the ovens.

880
01:26:29,605 --> 01:26:31,857
For the queen, so haughty and serene.

881
01:26:32,066 --> 01:26:35,692
- One, two for you, little page.
- What are these for?

882
01:26:35,901 --> 01:26:40,030
To sheathe your body for the court.
And a brutal one for the jungle denizen.

883
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:43,450
- Come with me. We'll change.
- And the best one of all for me.

884
01:26:43,867 --> 01:26:48,954
- The things that I do for bread.
- Not gold. Affection. Friendship.

885
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:53,250
The strong mutual bond of the round
table. We are the spirits of the dead...

886
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:58,962
...creatures treading the river Styx.
- I'm here. Doesn't that prove my fealty?

887
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:03,174
- Doesn't that satisfy you?
- I accept your fealty and nobly return it...

888
01:27:03,383 --> 01:27:07,718
...and beseech you to get thine ass
in gear and garb your angry loins.

889
01:27:07,885 --> 01:27:10,429
Okay. Okay.

890
01:27:16,016 --> 01:27:19,562
- It is I, Superwoman.
- Far out, Z-Man.

891
01:27:19,854 --> 01:27:24,232
Not Z-Man, Superwoman.
It bodes nothing unless you're serious.

892
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:29,278
- Come now, let us seek Jungle Lad.
- Hey, rube, it's your party. Let's do it.

893
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:32,948
Marvelous. It displays you
to such magnificent advantage.

894
01:27:33,115 --> 01:27:35,157
Let's not be jealous, Z-Man.

895
01:27:39,161 --> 01:27:40,328
I don't feel so well.

896
01:27:40,495 --> 01:27:43,874
Only the wine going to your head,
taking those wicked herbs with it.

897
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:46,583
- What?
- Ancient potion by Merlin the magician.

898
01:27:46,749 --> 01:27:49,377
Just add one part peyote
and some other benign goodies.

899
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:52,797
- It's used in all the best rituals.
- It's only a small dose, Casey.

900
01:27:52,964 --> 01:27:54,714
You know how Z-Man is.

901
01:27:54,922 --> 01:28:00,094
I mean, Superwoman.
Listen, I'll watch out for you.

902
01:28:00,303 --> 01:28:05,264
No more words, I pray you.
Let the games begin.

903
01:29:18,532 --> 01:29:20,867
Roxanne?

904
01:29:28,623 --> 01:29:31,960
Will you watch out for me?

905
01:31:32,515 --> 01:31:36,433
- Jungle Lad.
- Ronnie...

906
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:40,896
...I am really ripped. Cool it.

907
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:45,607
- Ronnie? Nay, nay. Superwoman.
- Okay.

908
01:31:45,774 --> 01:31:50,028
Okay, Superwoman. Whatever.

909
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:53,448
Oh, am I flashing.

910
01:31:53,615 --> 01:31:56,783
I gotta get my head together.

911
01:31:56,950 --> 01:32:00,120
Maybe some of that sauce.

912
01:32:00,328 --> 01:32:04,914
Jungle Lad, is it not sufficient
just to be here locked in embrace...

913
01:32:05,123 --> 01:32:08,626
...in the arms of she
who is every man's dream?

914
01:32:11,504 --> 01:32:14,089
Who are you to reject Superwoman?

915
01:32:14,256 --> 01:32:16,715
Why do you react so strangely
in the embrace...

916
01:32:16,924 --> 01:32:19,301
...of the embodiment of carnal desire?

917
01:32:19,468 --> 01:32:23,097
"Carnal desire" my ass.

918
01:33:30,442 --> 01:33:34,195
I, who have never before been spurned.
Superwoman.

919
01:33:34,403 --> 01:33:36,571
You wanna know something?
You're right.

920
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:41,576
You wanna know something else?
I'm gonna take a downer and crash.

921
01:33:41,951 --> 01:33:47,038
You varlet. You serf.
You buggering knave.

922
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:50,666
How dare you cast aside
my alabaster charms...

923
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:54,461
...my capacious love,
my undying troth.

924
01:33:54,627 --> 01:34:00,382
Yes, I vow it.
Ere this night does wane...

925
01:34:00,549 --> 01:34:05,719
...you will drink the black sperm
of my vengeance!

926
01:34:35,868 --> 01:34:42,041
How now, Jungle Lad?
Why so helpless? And why so frail?

927
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:46,502
Where is your much vaunted
muscular prowess?

928
01:34:46,669 --> 01:34:49,672
I don't know your story.
And I don't wanna know it.

929
01:34:49,839 --> 01:34:53,134
All I know is, these goddamn ropes
are cutting my wrists...

930
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,968
...and I want out now!
- Growl, vassal.

931
01:34:56,135 --> 01:35:00,639
You spoil Superwoman's sport
when you whine and succor me.

932
01:35:00,848 --> 01:35:04,183
Jungle Lad should be silent and mighty,
not a groveling ant...

933
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:06,184
...creeping across the melodious moat.

934
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:10,897
Besides, methinks you miss the point.
You are doing what I want...

935
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:13,066
...exactly what I demand, sir.

936
01:35:13,233 --> 01:35:16,735
At last the king of the jungle
comes under the imperious rule...

937
01:35:16,901 --> 01:35:18,778
...of she who is unconquerable:

938
01:35:18,945 --> 01:35:20,822
Superwoman.

939
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:24,199
How it excites me, your legendary
strength rendered impotent...

940
01:35:24,366 --> 01:35:27,076
...as you grovel before
the greatest superhero of all time.

941
01:35:27,326 --> 01:35:29,620
The man's out of his gourd.

942
01:35:37,126 --> 01:35:42,298
Methinks you remind me
of certain things.

943
01:35:42,757 --> 01:35:44,257
Don't move, you churl.

944
01:35:44,424 --> 01:35:48,802
Don't move a single muscle
of that finely fleshed body.

945
01:35:49,011 --> 01:35:51,638
You're a freak, Barzell.
You're a stone freak!

946
01:35:52,056 --> 01:35:56,224
I'll get you back in spades, Barzell!
I'll get you, you mother!

947
01:35:56,391 --> 01:36:00,520
The vorpal blade goes snicker-snack!
Yes, Jungle Lad...

948
01:36:00,687 --> 01:36:05,940
...meet my friend Excalibur,
mightiest sword of all time.

949
01:36:06,149 --> 01:36:10,236
Forged by Woden, the god of time,
legendary blade of King Arthur.

950
01:36:10,445 --> 01:36:13,989
Hurled into the lake,
it sprang forth again, shining and pure.

951
01:36:14,198 --> 01:36:19,660
But now, now it is wielded by she
who will eclipse all their deeds...

952
01:36:19,869 --> 01:36:25,122
...Arthur, Lancelot and even mighty
Coeur de Lion. Superwoman!

953
01:36:25,664 --> 01:36:31,087
Listen, Ronnie. See, this whole thing
has been a big game.

954
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:34,797
Right? A big put on.
We've been putting each other on, man!

955
01:36:34,963 --> 01:36:39,426
The trouble is, you think it's for real,
but it's not.

956
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:46,098
Now, we're friends, aren't we?
Remember, Z-Man? Put the sword away.

957
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:50,143
Come on, Z-Man, put it away.
You don't need it.

958
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:55,522
Yeah.

959
01:36:56,648 --> 01:37:01,569
Z-Man? There is no Z-Man, varlet.

960
01:37:01,736 --> 01:37:08,491
And indeed, it is not a game we play.
I am Superwoman!

961
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:17,748
Oh, my God. No.

962
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:21,419
You've been a broad all along.
Right, Barzell? A goddamn broad!

963
01:37:21,585 --> 01:37:25,295
A goddamn ugly broad, Barzell!

964
01:37:25,462 --> 01:37:27,840
An ugly broad!

965
01:37:29,091 --> 01:37:31,260
No, Ronnie! No!

966
01:37:45,729 --> 01:37:47,731
Oh, God!

967
01:38:39,981 --> 01:38:41,608
You beg for mercy...

968
01:38:41,775 --> 01:38:45,526
...while the cries of 6,000,000 innocent
still ring in your ears?

969
01:38:45,735 --> 01:38:49,030
They are waiting for you.

970
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:08,552
So without the Boy Wonder,
my sylph-like friend?

971
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:49,960
- Man, this game's fixed.
- Objection. Objection.

972
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:55,797
- It's your dime.
- Help me. I'm at Ronnie's...

973
01:40:55,964 --> 01:40:59,092
...and he's flipped out.
He's killing everybody!

974
01:40:59,301 --> 01:41:03,430
- Calm down. Z-Man's killing what?
- Casey, what's wrong?

975
01:41:03,638 --> 01:41:07,307
He's killing everybody!
Please, call the police.

976
01:41:07,515 --> 01:41:13,355
Why turn away from Superwoman,
greatest law enforcer of them all.

977
01:41:14,812 --> 01:41:17,565
- Hang on, Casey. We'll be right there.
- What's happening?

978
01:41:17,774 --> 01:41:20,068
Casey needs help. Let's go.

979
01:42:11,067 --> 01:42:14,027
Stay here. I'm going around the back.

980
01:42:15,236 --> 01:42:17,905
- Come on, Pet. Let's go.
- Help me out of here.

981
01:43:23,958 --> 01:43:25,917
She's dead!

982
01:43:26,126 --> 01:43:29,755
Casey. She's dead.

983
01:43:29,963 --> 01:43:33,759
He killed her!
And there's someone else inside...

984
01:43:33,924 --> 01:43:36,718
...but I don't know who it is.

985
01:43:36,885 --> 01:43:40,055
The head is missing!

986
01:43:40,263 --> 01:43:41,348
Oh, my God!

987
01:43:43,683 --> 01:43:47,935
- Kelly?
- Harris! Harris, are you hurt?

988
01:43:48,144 --> 01:43:52,690
My toes...
I can feel my legs!

989
01:43:55,524 --> 01:43:57,860
God!

990
01:44:00,738 --> 01:44:06,367
- Oh, Harris, you can walk.
- Kelly. Oh, Kelly.

991
01:44:38,893 --> 01:44:43,231
The act of death has caused
another life to be reborn.

992
01:44:43,398 --> 01:44:46,983
Together, we share the wonder
of human existence.

993
01:44:47,149 --> 01:44:50,653
And let there be no doubt
that all of us are brothers.

994
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:55,864
There can be no beginning or ending that
does in some way not touch another.

995
01:44:56,031 --> 01:45:00,911
For our actions affect the lives
and destinies of the many.

996
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:05,414
Z-Man: He forgot that life
has many levels...

997
01:45:05,622 --> 01:45:09,626
...and by choosing to live on only one,
lost sight of reality.

998
01:45:10,252 --> 01:45:14,546
Ashley: Men were toys
for her amusement.

999
01:45:14,754 --> 01:45:19,551
Her total disregard for their feelings
made love a stranger to her.

1000
01:45:19,759 --> 01:45:23,722
Lance Rocke:
He never gave of himself.

1001
01:45:24,013 --> 01:45:29,309
Those who only take must be prepared
to pay the highest price of all.

1002
01:45:29,892 --> 01:45:34,021
Porter Hall used his profession
to mask selfish interests...

1003
01:45:34,187 --> 01:45:37,189
...to betray the trust
that should have been sacred.

1004
01:45:37,732 --> 01:45:40,610
Susan Lake: Perhaps too pure.

1005
01:45:40,818 --> 01:45:43,029
Excessive goodness can often blind us...

1006
01:45:43,195 --> 01:45:45,446
...to the human failings
of those less perfect.

1007
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:48,991
Emerson found that something
as precious as love...

1008
01:45:49,158 --> 01:45:52,703
...brings with it a demand
for greater understanding.

1009
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:56,204
Casey and Roxanne:
Light and shadow.

1010
01:45:56,913 --> 01:46:02,461
Theirs was not an evil relationship.
But evil did come because of it.

1011
01:46:03,003 --> 01:46:06,755
Otto:
An end to Martin Bormann?

1012
01:46:07,589 --> 01:46:13,136
Harris: He forgot that yesterday
is only for remembering.

1013
01:46:13,303 --> 01:46:16,804
Those who choose to live there
lose sight of tomorrow.

1014
01:46:17,513 --> 01:46:21,976
Pet's mistake: A fleeting thing,
born of emotion...

1015
01:46:22,185 --> 01:46:25,186
...yet it almost ruined the lives
of two others.

1016
01:46:25,519 --> 01:46:32,068
Randy's body: A cage for an animal.
It lifted him to the top of his field...

1017
01:46:32,234 --> 01:46:36,236
...but in the end,
the beast almost killed him.

1018
01:46:36,487 --> 01:46:40,157
And Kelly?
Her selfish involvement...

1019
01:46:40,324 --> 01:46:46,119
...so ready to turn her back on
friendship. The road back is painful.

1020
01:46:46,328 --> 01:46:49,915
But by her pain,
she will never again forget.

1021
01:46:51,291 --> 01:46:56,169
You must each decide
what your life will be.

1022
01:46:56,336 --> 01:47:00,423
You must always know that a hand
extended to your fellow man...

1023
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:02,842
...is a gesture of love.

1024
01:47:03,009 --> 01:47:09,180
Love that asks nothing, expects nothing.
It is simply there.

1025
01:47:09,347 --> 01:47:15,226
And if love is in you,
then gentle will be all your steps...

1026
01:47:15,393 --> 01:47:19,605
...as you walk beyond this valley.

1027
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:52,507
They always said there'd be
a first time for everything.

1028
01:47:52,674 --> 01:47:57,885
And this is certainly
our first triple-ceremony.

1029
01:47:59,345 --> 01:48:02,223
Just a second, folks.

1030
01:48:05,641 --> 01:48:08,728
It's Porter Hall.

1031
01:48:17,943 --> 01:48:19,570
And now, we shall begin.
