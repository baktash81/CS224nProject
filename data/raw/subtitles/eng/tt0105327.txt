1
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,044
Hey, David!

2
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:50,241
Davey!
Oh, Davey, come here!

3
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:54,002
Edie, he's not going off to war,
only Massachusetts.

4
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,761
Here, Davey... For the trip.

5
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,442
Edie gives something away!
I'll have a heart attack!

6
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:06,483
Go and become a gentleman,
not like this riff-raff.

7
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:10,765
We ought to kick his butt
for breaking up the team.

8
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:13,521
Hey!
You want to stay in here?

9
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:16,398
If I had your brains, I'd go.

10
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:20,355
- His brains? Any brains!
- Look who's talking.

11
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,678
- I don't know.
- What?

12
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:27,602
- I don't know about that place.
- You know it's not this place.

13
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:33,246
- Oh, shit. Kocus.
- So what?

14
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:36,763
The night before last,
his sister gave me a hand job.

15
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,316
- Her idea.
- Yeah, right.

16
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:45,757
- Hey, Bear.
- Hey, Kocus.

17
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:51,556
We was thinking about going in there,
you know, eat something.

18
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:56,642
- I don't think it would be a good idea.
- Why not? They let Jews in there.

19
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:02,760
Your sister can come in,
only she'll have to wash her hands.

20
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:08,765
You got a Jew friend
with a smart mouth.

21
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:12,715
- I guess I do.
- It don't bother you they killed Jesus?

22
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:15,355
No. I didn't know the man.

23
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:19,886
It bothers the shit out of me,
you sheeny bastard!

24
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:22,845
Hey! Take it to the alley!

25
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:42,284
Yo, man! Come on!
Don't let him do that! Come on! Yeah!

26
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,038
Hit the Jew!

27
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,918
Give 'em hell, kid!

28
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,278
You're late.

29
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:38,838
Look at me.

30
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:42,563
- Goddamnit, David.
- I had to.

31
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:47,357
- Such an opportunity and you do this!
- I had to!

32
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:50,564
This is a school
two presidents went to.

33
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:54,686
They'll think you're a hoodlum.
They might send you back.

34
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,838
- Fine.
- Fine?

35
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:03,320
Take a look at this place.
You want this life?

36
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:07,716
He called me a sheeny bastard.
Should I walk away?

37
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:12,244
Yes. It ain't your problem.
You can't fight your way through life.

38
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:17,117
- You never got into any fights?
- Sure, but nobody handed me Harvard.

39
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:33,162
- You're going to miss the bus.
- We'll make it.

40
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:37,678
- Who did you fight with?
- Kocus.

41
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,804
OK, kids.

42
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:49,119
You can fit in or hack around
with a chip on your shoulder.

43
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:55,283
- All right. All right, I'll fit in.
- They came to you, not you to them.

44
00:06:55,447 --> 00:07:00,043
You don't have to explain
nothing to nobody. Understand?

45
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:02,198
All right.

46
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:09,838
Right. Say goodbye
to your brother and sister.

47
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:13,044
- Goodbye, Sarah.
- Bye, David.

48
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,918
Bye, Petey.

49
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:29,562
You kids wait over there.

50
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,558
Change your shirt.

51
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:39,597
- What did the other guy look like?
- Worse.

52
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:50,446
- You're sounding like Grandpa.
- You should be so lucky.

53
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,518
Got to go, Dad.

54
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:05,677
Go. Make us proud.

55
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:14,157
- Bye.
- Bye.

56
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,686
- Hi, Coach.
- Welcome to Cabot.

57
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,525
I had a little accident.
It's nothing.

58
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:28,760
- Let me get this for you.
- Thanks.

59
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:49,000
- How was your trip?
- Fine. I slept.

60
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,806
- Good. How's your dad?
- Fine.

61
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,800
He's pretty excited about all this.

62
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,720
- What father wouldn't be?
- Yeah.

63
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,606
The team's looking forward
to meeting you.

64
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,282
Good. I'm looking forward
to meeting them, too.

65
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:36,556
- Jesus, this is a high school!
- Yeah. It's your high school.

66
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:02,558
- Thanks for the lift.
- I'll get your bag.

67
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:12,645
Thanks.
I'll see you at practice.

68
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:18,875
Just a minute. I meant to ask you...
Do you have any diet problems?

69
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:23,006
- Diet problems?
- Is there anything you can't eat?

70
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,316
- Turnips.
- Turnips. I can't eat them, either.

71
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,478
I'd better let you get settled.

72
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:34,925
- The kids will be curious about you.
- I'm curious about them.

73
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:39,126
Nobody comes here for just
their last year. It's unusual.

74
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:44,238
They're great kids, don't get me wrong.
But they're privileged.

75
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:47,604
They take a lot for granted
you and I never would.

76
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,839
Just play your cards
close to the vest.

77
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,918
What do you mean?

78
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,363
Don't tell people
more than they need to know.

79
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:00,766
- See you at practice.
- All right.

80
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:50,917
- Hi! Chris Reece, your roommate.
- Hi! David Greene.

81
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:54,875
Pleased to meet you. Rip Van Kelt,
Jack Connors, Charlie Dillon.

82
00:12:55,047 --> 00:12:57,083
We're the big men on campus.

83
00:12:57,447 --> 00:12:59,722
- It's true.
- Where you from?

84
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,357
- Scranton, PA.
- Scranton?

85
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:05,485
- It's in America, Connors.
- No shit.

86
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:08,764
You're the first ringer
St Matt's ever hired.

87
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:12,806
- Dillon...
- No, he is. It's an honour.

88
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:16,437
- Aren't you honoured?
- I hadn't thought about it.

89
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:20,964
- The best quarterback money can buy.
- Dillon, lay off!

90
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:26,918
Don't pay any attention to him.
Peanuts?

91
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:28,918
No problem.

92
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:33,399
Even in Scranton, a prick's a prick.

93
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:38,516
You don't have to be so sensitive.
Come on, it's not required here.

94
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:43,202
There was some talk about me
playing quarterback, so...

95
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:46,359
- Were you in an accident?
- I got into a fight.

96
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,916
- Seriously?
- A fistfight?

97
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:53,478
- Kind of a going-away fight.
- What, you mean like a rumble?

98
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:56,320
- Yeah, like a rumble.
- Over girls and stuff?

99
00:13:56,487 --> 00:14:01,607
There's a place we hang out and these
motorcycle guys wanted to come in.

100
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:04,042
- Bikers.
- We wouldn't let them.

101
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:07,324
- You didn't want them on your turf?
- Right.

102
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:11,082
Everybody knows not to go
on someone else's turf.

103
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:15,081
Who knows what evil
lurks in the hearts of men?

104
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:17,363
The Shadow knows.

105
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:22,436
Crime does not pay.
The Shadow knows.

106
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:24,598
McGiv! My roomie!

107
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,366
David Greene,
our new quarterback.

108
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,961
- This is Mac.
- How do you do?

109
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:35,118
Hi.

110
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:42,045
Football is a game for bug squashers,
cretins and criminals. Don't you agree?

111
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:47,406
- Mac wants to play, but he's too frail.
- So we let him be student manager.

112
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:52,838
That's it! I'm going to kick
your smelly ass back to Greenwich.

113
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:57,401
I guess you didn't get a school tie
yet.

114
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,681
Here, you can wear this one.

115
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:06,125
I got extras because I'm always
dragging them through the soup.

116
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,198
Thanks.

117
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:15,320
You mind if I ask...
How did you wind up here?

118
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:19,682
- I'm not supposed to talk about it.
- Let me guess.

119
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:24,637
Coach McDevitt visited and said
you could get an alumni scholarship?

120
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:27,277
Good guess.
How did you know?

121
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:31,676
St Luke's has whipped us
for three years in a row.

122
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,442
The alumni are pissed.
They want to win real bad.

123
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,722
Not too much pressure, huh?

124
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,238
I want a good seat at the back.

125
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:45,126
It's different from public schools.

126
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:48,518
Chapel three times a week.
But it's not that bad.

127
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:50,678
No kidding?

128
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:51,477
Gentlemen of St Matthew's...

129
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:56,726
...welcome to the finest
preparatory school in the nation.

130
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:03,762
Welcome especially to our new boys.
I am Dr Bartram, your headmaster.

131
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:07,840
The rest of you may
conceivably remember me.

132
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,879
His annual joke.
Make the most of it.

133
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:16,278
Tomorrow begins the 193rd fall term.

134
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:21,043
No, I was not in office
when the first one began.

135
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,482
Some of you new boys may find

136
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:27,560
that academics and discipline
here are very demanding.

137
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,082
Much of what is policy here,

138
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:34,638
including our cherished Honour Code,
has been established,

139
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:38,766
not by me or your teachers,
but by your fellow students,

140
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:42,556
to be enforced
by your own tribunal of prefects,

141
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:46,083
as it has been
for the last two centuries.

142
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,037
We judge ourselves here,

143
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:53,246
and we judge ourselves
by the highest standards.

144
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,479
You, my boys, are among
the elite of the nation,

145
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:00,036
and we strive at St Matthew's

146
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:05,327
to prepare you for the responsibility
that comes with favoured position.

147
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:09,917
Today, more than ever,
this country needs an elite

148
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:13,443
that cares more for honour
than for advantage;

149
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:18,805
more for service
than for personal gain.

150
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,198
To that end,
let us beseech the help of God,

151
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:27,801
in whose name we pray.

152
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:38,043
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name...

153
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:19,086
- Decent hi-fi, Mac.
- Bought it from a friend back home.

154
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:22,045
- How much?
- I jewed him down to $30.

155
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:24,198
I'll give you $25 for it.

156
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:27,404
He always wants
something for nothing.

157
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,364
And he's not even Jewish.

158
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:35,044
- Evening, gentlemen.
- Evening, sir.

159
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,758
Evening.

160
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:43,443
Whose music is that?
And I use the term advisedly.

161
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:46,883
- That's the great sound of The Robins.
- No.

162
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:49,959
I mean the man who would purchase
such swill.

163
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:53,324
- That would be me.
- That would be I.

164
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:00,877
- Have you a name?
- McGivern.

165
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:03,322
- And you?
- Mr Cleary.

166
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:08,599
I happen to be the new housemaster.

167
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,641
Turn it off, please.

168
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,881
One's cultural environment
ought to be as important

169
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:22,198
as the air he breathes
and the food he eats.

170
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:39,720
- Surely, in your day, you had music?
- Yes, and my day has not passed.

171
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:41,878
Dave Brubeck, Ray Anthony,

172
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:44,436
Les Elgart, Mitch Miller,

173
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:46,962
Les Baxter, Roger Williams...

174
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,846
We'll have no problem.

175
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:53,521
Gentlemen, we all have to live here.

176
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:59,086
But we're not going to bring the jungle
into my house, thank you very much.

177
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:35,844
God, Greene,
where did you get the balls?

178
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,835
- You are in.
- I hope all the teachers aren't like him.

179
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:45,919
Most are OK.
Who'd you get for History?

180
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,681
- Gierasch.
- Me, too. He's tough.

181
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:50,644
- French?
- Renard.

182
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:54,004
Good. We'll get him talking
and go to sleep.

183
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,681
- You shower morning or night?
- Night.

184
00:21:56,847 --> 00:22:00,442
Hurry up.
We'll just make it before lights out.

185
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,758
What a beautiful day.

186
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:52,282
Renard will be a breeze.

187
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:07,320
Well...

188
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,762
Well, well.

189
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,726
My musical upstairs neighbours.

190
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:21,279
Please, do sit down.

191
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:26,766
Monsieur Renard is cutting back
on his teaching load,

192
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:32,160
so I will have the pleasure
of teaching this section of French 4.

193
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:04,724
I don't understand...

194
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:29,078
You know how a team works.

195
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:32,125
I wasn't the quarterback
you wanted.

196
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:36,963
- You are our number one back-up.
- But I'd better play halfback.

197
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:41,120
It's our weakest spot now.
You'll make a great halfback.

198
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:45,519
You can run and you can block.
You've got all the stuff, kid.

199
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:49,316
- And I'll give it my best.
- I'm counting on it.

200
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,442
Listen up!

201
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:56,759
New face on the varsity this year.
David Greene.

202
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:59,725
- Greene comes from Pennsylvania.
- Hi.

203
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:02,044
Played quarterback.

204
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:06,519
Led his team to a championship win
last year in a tough league.

205
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:09,599
This year,
we're concentrating on passing.

206
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:11,758
McGivern has some new plays.

207
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,840
If captured, eat them.
If still alive, meet here tomorrow.

208
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:19,959
We'll run them through tomorrow.

209
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:23,642
Today, let's get out there
and warm up. Hit it!

210
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:43,278
- Hi, Coach.
- Dillon.

211
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:47,156
Hi, Dillon.
How was practice?

212
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:51,078
How was practice!

213
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:05,040
- Where's Greene?
- I don't know.

214
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:08,722
- I thought he'd be here.
- Save a place for him, huh?

215
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:12,279
- Like this...
- Will you get off me!

216
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,235
Thank you, God,
for your bountiful gifts...

217
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,281
- I'm holding my own.
- <i>And French?</i>

218
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:50,599
- Hate the teacher.
- <i>Everybody hates at least one.</i>

219
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:52,997
I'd better get back to the books.

220
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:55,635
- Talk soon.
- <i>Don't forget Saturday.</i>

221
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:58,401
- Saturday?
- It's Rosh Hashanah.

222
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:03,245
I've got a game against Winchester,
Pop.

223
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:06,683
It's a very holy day.
It goes back longer than us.

224
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:10,396
You show respect and get to temple.

225
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:13,127
<i>Davey, do you hear me?</i>
<i>No excuses.</i>

226
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:16,319
OK.
Sure, don't worry, Pop.

227
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:20,597
- I'll speak to you next week.
- <i>OK. Bye.</i>

228
00:27:24,647 --> 00:27:26,239
Down!

229
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:31,119
Set!

230
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:34,124
Go! Go!

231
00:27:42,847 --> 00:27:46,556
St Matt's, third and five,
on the Winchester 41.

232
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:49,199
Two!

233
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,880
Three!

234
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:11,923
<i>St Matt's touchdown.</i>
<i>St Matt's six. Winchester nothing.</i>

235
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:15,121
That boy's good.
What's his name?

236
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:19,280
Van Kelt. The boys call him Rip.
He's the team captain.

237
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,564
I think he means the boy
who threw the pass.

238
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:25,480
Oh. That's David Greene.

239
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:01,042
<i>The score is tied seven apiece.</i>

240
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:06,156
<i>St Matt's ball, third and seven</i>
<i>on the Winchester forty-yard line.</i>

241
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:11,839
Set!

242
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,999
Down!

243
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,718
Set... One!

244
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,599
Go!

245
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:31,724
Yeah!

246
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:36,242
<i>Touchdown, St Matt's!</i>

247
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:47,516
We've got a quarterback!
We've found our quarterback!

248
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:55,915
- <i>Lights out!</i>
- <i>Lights out!</i>

249
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:08,199
You go ahead, dear.
I'll be right there.

250
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:27,238
Who is it?

251
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:33,803
- David Greene, sir.
- What are you doing here, Greene?

252
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,719
Praying, sir.

253
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:39,084
I imagine your God allows prayer
during daylight.

254
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:44,367
I couldn't get away before.
It's Rosh Hashanah, Jewish New Year.

255
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:46,643
I know what Rosh Hashanah is.

256
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:49,879
And it ends at sunset
if I recall the custom.

257
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:55,360
Technically. But it wouldn't go over
too well if I said I couldn't play.

258
00:30:55,527 --> 00:30:59,918
- My scholarship depends on football.
- Yes. I saw the game.

259
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:03,762
You seemed thoroughly concentrated
on the task.

260
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:05,918
Thank you, sir.

261
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:12,000
You people are very determined,
aren't you?

262
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:15,398
Sometimes we have to be, sir.

263
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:17,558
I seem to recall a blessing:

264
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:21,606
"Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth."

265
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,565
I wonder how meek they'll be
when they do, sir.

266
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:27,446
Are you finished here, Mr Greene?

267
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:31,358
Yes, sir.

268
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:34,564
Then I suggest
you sneak back to your room.

269
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:38,197
I shall overlook
this evening's infraction.

270
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:43,482
- Mr Greene?
- Sir?

271
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:49,358
Was it worth it? Breaking a tradition
just to win a football game?

272
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:53,995
Your tradition or mine, sir?

273
00:32:04,607 --> 00:32:08,600
The son of a bitch
gives us English to French!

274
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:11,725
The pig won't last here.
I'll bet you.

275
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:15,163
Won't last?
Connors, I flunked that test.

276
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:20,278
I'm getting sick
of these goddamned bells!

277
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:39,877
- Henry Vlll assumes throne?
- 1509.

278
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:44,438
- 1649, Mr Smith?
- Charles I was executed.

279
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:48,759
Correct. Which resulted
in the establishment of what?

280
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:52,044
- A commonwealth, Mr Gierasch.
- Very good.

281
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:56,246
Mr Dillon, when did
Mary Queen of Scots lose her head?

282
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:59,765
- 1687.
- Close. You're only a century off.

283
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:01,758
- Mr Greene?
- 1587.

284
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:06,079
Indeed. And what occurred
during the years 1553 to 1558?

285
00:33:06,247 --> 00:33:08,522
- Mr Collins?
- Bloody Mary.

286
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,918
So it was.
Which resulted in what, Mr Reece?

287
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:14,521
Catholicism was restored.

288
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:16,598
How come, Mr Connors?

289
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:19,201
She married what's-his-name.

290
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:22,881
- Philip?
- Well, more or less.

291
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,203
August 9th, 1593?

292
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,758
Anybody?

293
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:32,235
The birth of lzaak Walton.

294
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:34,443
A personal favourite.

295
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:38,802
Mr Dillon, a literary event...

296
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:42,478
1611?

297
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:46,963
- McGivern?
- Publication of the King James Bible.

298
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:49,118
Correct.

299
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:53,199
You care to try for three, Mr Dillon?

300
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,962
I remind you, Mr Dillon,
this course has no shallow end.

301
00:33:58,127 --> 00:33:59,924
Sink or swim.

302
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:04,241
If I don't get total tit tonight,
I'll cut my throat.

303
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:06,921
Sex is my only reason
for living.

304
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:10,007
Then be careful
you don't cut your hand!

305
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:13,915
Life isn't over yet, Mac.

306
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:17,124
When Princeton might accept
a C in French

307
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:20,359
and you're flunking French,
life is over.

308
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:23,997
Princeton isn't
the only lvy League school.

309
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:28,920
Someone explain
to our friend from Scranton.

310
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:33,126
Five generations of McGiverns have
gone to Princeton.

311
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:36,677
If I don't get in,
it means the others had cocks,

312
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,838
and I just have a wee-wee.

313
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:43,840
I have trouble sympathising.
Harvard wants monthly reports on me.

314
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:47,085
- How about you, Greene?
- Touch and go.

315
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,238
I'm getting a C in French.

316
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:54,117
Dillon's brother graduates this year.
The back-up quarterbacks are thumbs.

317
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,996
I wouldn't go to Harvard.
All those Jews and Communists.

318
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:01,637
- That's just the faculty.
- You are so full of shit.

319
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:03,684
Jew-lover!

320
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:07,203
So what if there are Jews?
They're not in the clubs.

321
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:11,838
- That's not the point.
- It is. You don't have to be with them.

322
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:15,079
- Why would you want to?
- I don't want to.

323
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,715
Then don't go to Harvard, Dillon.

324
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:19,878
- Help?
- How would you know?

325
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:22,038
- What?
- If you're with them?

326
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:27,156
Are you kidding? How would you
not know? It's hard to miss a heeb.

327
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:29,682
Oh, God, girls,
eat your hearts out!

328
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:35,001
Oh, no! You never mess with my hair!
I can't believe you did that!

329
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:37,916
No way! You're dead!

330
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:02,122
Hurry up, fellas. Come on.

331
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:36,437
Don't forget to make room
for the Holy Ghost.

332
00:37:33,847 --> 00:37:37,362
- You can roll your tongue back up.
- She's beautiful!

333
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:40,963
Sally Wheeler.
Dillon says she's his girlfriend.

334
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:44,358
- Is she?
- I guess so. That's the word.

335
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:32,122
- Isn't that your new quarterback?
- David Greene.

336
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:41,639
He must be half nigger!
He can dance.

337
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:06,604
Introduce me.

338
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:09,642
- David!
- Excuse me.

339
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:18,126
You move as well on the floor
as the field.

340
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:21,245
- Sally Wheeler, David Greene.
- Dillon!

341
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:28,002
- I'll be back in a minute.
- No rush.

342
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:33,879
- I saw you dancing.
- I saw you dancing, too. With Dillon.

343
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:39,280
- Dillon's a great guy.
- He's fun.

344
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:41,278
Yeah.

345
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:47,921
Do you think he'll go to Harvard?

346
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:52,046
Is that what you do in your
spare time? Worry about Dillon?

347
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:56,796
I don't have any spare time.

348
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:04,757
This is a great song.

349
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:14,479
- Would you like to dance?
- Yeah, I would.

350
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:33,522
Are you two going steady?

351
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:36,876
No. Our families share some woods,

352
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:40,039
so we've known each other
since we were five.

353
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:42,198
We're thrown together a lot,

354
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:45,962
so everybody thinks we go steady,
but they're wrong.

355
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:53,001
I know how it is. My family shares
some woods in Pennsylvania.

356
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,158
With 300,000 other people.

357
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,205
You must think I'm a spoiled brat.

358
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:05,198
I think you're so pretty.

359
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:13,161
- I must sound like a real nosebleed.
- No.

360
00:41:13,327 --> 00:41:16,876
- Don't tell your roommate.
- How do you know her?

361
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:20,005
I don't.
I just don't want her to know.

362
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:27,082
- You're pretty, too.
- Thanks for taking care of my girl.

363
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:29,158
Try the punch.

364
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:57,358
Maybe he won't show.

365
00:41:57,847 --> 00:42:01,362
- I'm going to puke. My stomach hurts.
- You'll be OK.

366
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:05,156
25% of the grade!
That's crazy. That's just not right.

367
00:42:05,327 --> 00:42:08,797
- I wonder who he'll call on first.
- Take a guess.

368
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:11,879
It all comes down to this one day.
Jesus!

369
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:15,960
- It doesn't. You're worked up.
- My mouth's all dried out.

370
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:18,277
Shit! I can't do this!

371
00:44:18,647 --> 00:44:21,719
- That asshole Cleary!
- Sadistic shiteater!

372
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,799
- Mac was doing all right.
- Will he be OK?

373
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:30,724
- Let him alone. He'll be OK.
- Poor bastard. He really took it.

374
00:44:31,207 --> 00:44:33,846
David, your sister's on the phone.

375
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:39,360
- Hello, Sarah, what's up?
- I didn't know you had a sister!

376
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:41,483
- Who is this?
- Sally Wheeler.

377
00:44:41,647 --> 00:44:44,923
- Hi. Where are you?
- At school, at the dorm.

378
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:48,326
- Are you studying?
- Yeah. Chemistry.

379
00:44:48,487 --> 00:44:50,876
- I hate Chemistry.
- Me, too.

380
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:55,359
- You ever go to Skip's Diner?
- Skip's Diner?

381
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:58,200
- Seen McGivern?
- Hold on... Haven't you?

382
00:44:58,367 --> 00:45:01,564
Not since French class.
Where the hell is he?

383
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:05,959
- Check with Dillon and Van Kelt.
- All right. See you later.

384
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:09,642
- Hi... Skip's Diner?
- Yeah, it's in town.

385
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,763
Kind of a hang-out.

386
00:45:11,927 --> 00:45:16,205
I thought if you weren't doing
anything tomorrow, we could go.

387
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:19,040
- What time?
- Ten o'clock?

388
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:36,805
He hasn't shown up.
I'm going to go look for him.

389
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,838
<i>Lights out!</i>

390
00:46:25,687 --> 00:46:28,963
McGivern! Mac!
Come on, Mac, buddy! Where are you?

391
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:31,118
Mac!

392
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:55,684
- Hold on, I'll get the lights.
- McGivern?

393
00:46:59,007 --> 00:47:00,838
Mac?

394
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:07,246
- McGiv!
- Mac!

395
00:47:40,847 --> 00:47:43,236
- Let's tell somebody.
- Maybe he's drunk.

396
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:46,444
- Mac never drinks.
- Do you think he went home?

397
00:47:46,607 --> 00:47:50,646
- He would have said something.
- Isn't that French class?

398
00:47:53,767 --> 00:47:55,678
Come on, let's go.

399
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:09,763
- Mac!
- McGiv?

400
00:48:13,647 --> 00:48:16,207
Come on. Hey!

401
00:48:17,727 --> 00:48:20,036
Hey! Get some help.

402
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:41,917
Shh... Shh... It's OK.

403
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:48,079
Gentlemen, please! Please, gentlemen,
go back to bed. Please.

404
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,683
You did this!
You did this!

405
00:48:56,847 --> 00:48:58,838
You rode him until he broke!

406
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:02,397
David, walk away!
Just walk away!

407
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:06,003
You wouldn't let up, would you?
You did this!

408
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:09,762
- Come on!
- I'll get you, Cleary! All right?

409
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:15,042
That was horrible.

410
00:49:15,207 --> 00:49:18,995
But David, you can't
go after a teacher like that here.

411
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:21,317
It's the end if you do.

412
00:49:22,047 --> 00:49:25,119
My friends back home
wouldn't believe this.

413
00:49:25,287 --> 00:49:27,596
Over a failing grade in French!

414
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:32,283
Good grades. The right schools,
colleges, connections.

415
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:35,086
Those are the keys to the kingdom.

416
00:49:35,247 --> 00:49:38,125
None of us goes off
and lives by his wits.

417
00:49:38,287 --> 00:49:42,121
We do what they tell us
and they give us the good life.

418
00:49:42,687 --> 00:49:45,247
Goddamn hope we like it
when we get it!

419
00:49:45,407 --> 00:49:50,401
- What will happen to Mac?
- He's not coming back.

420
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:57,164
Man!
I've heard of nervous breakdowns,

421
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:02,037
but I always thought it happened
to women who were 40 years old.

422
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,596
Not to a kid my age.

423
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:10,478
When I was a sophomore,
there was this senior, William Whitton.

424
00:50:10,647 --> 00:50:14,083
- He hung himself in the gym.
- Why?

425
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,240
- He didn't get into Harvard.
- Shit!

426
00:50:18,407 --> 00:50:20,796
- Yeah.
- I want to go to Harvard.

427
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:24,562
I'll be goddamned
if I croak myself if I don't.

428
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:28,203
I envy you.

429
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:32,323
Me? Why?

430
00:50:34,527 --> 00:50:38,122
Because if you get what you want,
you'll deserve it.

431
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:40,960
And if you don't, you'll manage.

432
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:46,478
You don't have to live up
to anybody else's expectations.

433
00:50:47,207 --> 00:50:50,756
That's what draws people,
not that you're quarterback.

434
00:50:50,927 --> 00:50:53,999
You're the most popular guy
on campus.

435
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:58,715
If my name weren't Dillon,
it would be different.

436
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:03,519
- Bullshit.
- David, don't forget my name's Dillon.

437
00:51:04,207 --> 00:51:06,721
Son of Grayson Jr,
brother of Grayson III.

438
00:51:06,887 --> 00:51:10,118
I'm a Dillon,
a part of those right connections.

439
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:12,881
People don't care about that.

440
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:15,838
You'll see.

441
00:52:15,727 --> 00:52:17,718
Evening, sir.

442
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,365
Evening, sir.

443
00:53:46,207 --> 00:53:49,802
- You don't smoke?
- No, I tried it, but it didn't take.

444
00:53:51,287 --> 00:53:54,677
You're too good.
Is that to impress the mothers?

445
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:58,283
- What mothers?
- Of all your girlfriends.

446
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:01,280
No, too many to try.

447
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:05,560
We were talking
about Saturdays in Scranton.

448
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:07,918
Oh, yeah. Garbage day.

449
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:10,681
We had to haul our trash
to the dump.

450
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:14,158
Don't knock it.

451
00:54:14,327 --> 00:54:17,000
One day, my father and I
see two guys.

452
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:20,284
One of them's got
a rope around his waist

453
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:23,644
and his buddy is lowering him
into the pit.

454
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:27,641
- What for?
- They were scavenging for tin cans.

455
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:30,526
- Who'd do that?
- That's what I said.

456
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:34,004
And my dad gave me
this long, hard look

457
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:37,603
and he said,
"Davey, it's an honest living."

458
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:43,118
I never forgot that.

459
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:49,636
- You're different from the other boys.
- How?

460
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:55,120
The others, like Dillon, you know
everything about them in two minutes.

461
00:54:55,287 --> 00:54:58,040
- But you...
- Four minutes, easy.

462
00:55:01,087 --> 00:55:03,442
You have a serious side.

463
00:55:08,687 --> 00:55:11,520
Let's go. Move it.
Move it, move it!

464
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:14,406
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

465
00:55:14,727 --> 00:55:16,877
- Night, David.
- Can I call you?

466
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,038
You'd better!

467
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:44,603
- We'll finish off St Luke's.
- I'll drink to that. It's about time.

468
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:49,443
Don't inspire me to increase my bet.
You can't beat St Luke's.

469
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:53,885
This year is different.
You haven't seen our secret weapon.

470
00:55:54,047 --> 00:55:58,643
Hey, hello, hello!
Mom, Dad, Gray, this is David Greene.

471
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:01,037
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.

472
00:56:01,207 --> 00:56:03,277
Mr and Mrs Wheeler.
David Greene.

473
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:05,961
- Pleased to meet you.
- You've met Sally.

474
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:08,004
- Hello, Sally.
- Hi.

475
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:11,876
- Are we going to punish St Luke's?
- Severely, sir.

476
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:16,403
- Stop eating! You'll be playing soon.
- I'm hungry.

477
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:21,197
- Poor Wheeler attended St Luke's.
- Your winning streak's over.

478
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:23,676
- Not today.
- Join us for dinner?

479
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,839
- Sure. Thank you.
- Remember, loser pays.

480
00:56:27,007 --> 00:56:28,998
All right, you're on.

481
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:32,682
- We should get back.
- Yeah. See you later.

482
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:36,317
- Bye-bye.
- Nice to meet you.

483
00:56:38,167 --> 00:56:40,601
- He's very cute.
- Yeah.

484
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:43,076
No, really, who found the boy?

485
00:56:43,247 --> 00:56:46,125
He applied.
Just like anybody else.

486
00:56:56,887 --> 00:56:58,878
<i>In the black Thunderbird,</i>

487
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:04,121
<i>St Matthew's oldest living alumnus,</i>
<i>Franklin Benson, class of 1875.</i>

488
00:57:08,047 --> 00:57:11,835
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>prior to the second half,</i>

489
00:57:12,007 --> 00:57:14,601
<i>each year three alumni are named</i>

490
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:18,043
<i>to the St Matthew's</i>
<i>Football Hall of Fame.</i>

491
00:57:18,207 --> 00:57:21,995
<i>Until the announcement,</i>
<i>nobody knows who will be named.</i>

492
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:26,763
<i>This year's inductees are,</i>
<i>from the class of 1951,</i>

493
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:29,725
<i>the youngest member</i>
<i>of the Hall of Fame,</i>

494
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:32,685
<i>quarterback Grayson Dillon III.</i>

495
00:57:37,607 --> 00:57:39,598
I don't believe it!

496
00:57:43,007 --> 00:57:48,559
<i>Grayson is currently attending Harvard</i>
<i>and plays football for the Crimson.</i>

497
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:07,242
<i>St Matt's ball,</i>
<i>second and twelve on their own ten.</i>

498
00:58:08,927 --> 00:58:10,519
Set! One!

499
00:58:14,527 --> 00:58:20,238
Chesty, fake off tackle right.
Pass to the flat. Left to Reece, go!

500
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,961
Hey David,
they're looking for a pass.

501
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:27,563
Give it to me on the right side.
I can get the first down.

502
00:58:27,727 --> 00:58:30,446
- Come on, my father's here.
- All right.

503
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,996
David, fake over tackle right.

504
00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:37,884
Left formation, Dillon takes it,
right draw. On two. Ready?

505
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:48,638
One! Two! Three!

506
00:58:58,887 --> 00:59:00,718
Oh, yeah! Show them!

507
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:02,560
Fumble!

508
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,758
<i>St Matt's fumbles.</i>

509
00:59:04,927 --> 00:59:06,918
What the hell's going on?

510
00:59:07,087 --> 00:59:10,443
I send in a play,
that's the play I want to see.

511
00:59:10,607 --> 00:59:13,565
- I'm the coach. You got that?
- Yeah, got it.

512
00:59:13,727 --> 00:59:16,082
Go out and bring this game home.

513
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:19,205
<i>St Luke's ball, third and goal.</i>

514
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:22,839
Blue! Set!

515
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:25,324
Hut! Hut!

516
00:59:29,927 --> 00:59:32,316
<i>Touchdown St Luke's.</i>

517
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,438
Damn it, Dillon!

518
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:43,885
<i>St Matt's ball, third and five</i>
<i>on St Luke's thirty-yard line.</i>

519
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,759
Down!

520
00:59:46,007 --> 00:59:47,599
Set!

521
00:59:48,327 --> 00:59:49,919
One!

522
00:59:51,847 --> 00:59:53,565
Greene! Greene!

523
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,285
Go! Go!

524
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:05,803
<i>It's good!</i>
<i>St Matthew's is on the scoreboard.</i>

525
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:19,957
Give me another chance.
I know I can get six yards.

526
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:24,882
- Let me make up for that fumble.
- Coach calls the plays.

527
01:00:25,047 --> 01:00:29,325
We're going to win now! Left draw,
quarterback keep left on two.

528
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:32,604
Dillon, you'd better
block your ass off for me.

529
01:00:38,407 --> 01:00:40,363
One! Two!

530
01:01:12,887 --> 01:01:15,003
Yeah! Yeah!

531
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:32,243
Let's have dessert,
since dinner is on Mr Wheeler.

532
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:36,320
I consider it a moral victory.

533
01:01:36,487 --> 01:01:40,400
There is no column in the record books
for moral victories.

534
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:44,565
- How do you like our club?
- Unbelievable.

535
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:49,084
In Scranton, a club is three guys
who chipped in to buy an old Buick.

536
01:01:50,967 --> 01:01:54,846
Good arm, good sense of humour.
Not a bad combination.

537
01:01:55,487 --> 01:01:59,116
- Hello, Grayson.
- Oh, Tom Keating. How are you?

538
01:01:59,287 --> 01:02:02,324
- See the game?
- Wouldn't have missed it.

539
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:05,638
- The new quarterback's our hope.
- Meet him.

540
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:08,844
David Greene,
this is Mr Keating, a trustee.

541
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:12,477
Son, many thanks.
It's good to be a winner again.

542
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:15,480
- You know the Wheelers?
- Oh, yes.

543
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:19,526
- Nice to see you, Tom.
- And my boys, Gray and Charlie.

544
01:02:19,847 --> 01:02:21,838
Of course. Gray...

545
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:26,244
- Congratulations. Quite an honour.
- Thank you.

546
01:02:26,407 --> 01:02:30,844
- Call me in the city, Tom.
- I will, Grayson. Have a nice evening.

547
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:34,966
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
Do you mind?

548
01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:44,198
- Tom Keating has had a drink or two.
- He does have that problem.

549
01:02:45,007 --> 01:02:48,124
Excuse me, I see Mrs Bartram
left unattended.

550
01:02:49,047 --> 01:02:51,038
Please, don't get up.

551
01:02:55,127 --> 01:02:57,118
How about a dance?

552
01:02:57,287 --> 01:03:00,359
If one of these young men
will dance with Sally.

553
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,961
Mother!

554
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:09,676
David, do you mind?
I'd like to have a word with this guy.

555
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,199
- Would you like to dance?
- Sure.

556
01:03:15,007 --> 01:03:17,157
OK.

557
01:03:22,527 --> 01:03:27,647
- Son, you played a good game today.
- Not as good as some people.

558
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:31,803
Don't sell yourself short.
That was a key block.

559
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:34,686
Without it,
David couldn't have scored.

560
01:03:35,447 --> 01:03:37,438
Fine game, wasn't it?

561
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:57,158
- I have a secret.
- Oh?

562
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,845
I think about you.
More than I ought to.

563
01:04:01,007 --> 01:04:02,918
That's too bad.

564
01:04:03,087 --> 01:04:06,363
Because if you think of me
as much as I think of you,

565
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:09,599
we're both going to flunk
right out of school.

566
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:12,565
Am I all sweaty
and red in the face?

567
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:16,357
You look like an angel.

568
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:27,995
Don't let your brother's award
detract from your day.

569
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:32,797
Of course not. I threw a good block,
he got into the Hall of Fame.

570
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:35,276
People have different abilities.

571
01:04:35,447 --> 01:04:37,597
I should accept my mediocrity.

572
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:42,204
You are not mediocre. You wouldn't
be at St Matt's if you were.

573
01:04:48,487 --> 01:04:52,275
- What are you looking at?
- Dillon looks like he's dying.

574
01:04:52,447 --> 01:04:56,156
Mention him once more,
I will sit down in a huff.

575
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:58,318
You know I'm a spoiled brat!

576
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:01,684
Dillon, Dillon, Dillon.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

577
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:05,556
You beat St Luke's.
Nobody thought you had a chance.

578
01:05:05,727 --> 01:05:09,117
- Enjoy it!
- Fine. I'm enjoying it. Can I go now?

579
01:05:09,287 --> 01:05:11,517
Yes, yes, you can go.

580
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:28,442
- Thanks for taking care of my girl.
- Stop saying that! I'm not your girl.

581
01:05:28,607 --> 01:05:32,395
- What the hell is this?
- You don't listen very well, do you?

582
01:05:34,047 --> 01:05:38,643
Sally, you're embarrassing me
in front of my friend. Let's talk.

583
01:05:38,807 --> 01:05:42,482
No, you're embarrassing me
in front of my friend.

584
01:05:42,687 --> 01:05:46,521
Charlie, I'm sorry.
It just kind of happened.

585
01:05:48,047 --> 01:05:51,437
- Screw you, friend.
- Charlie, come on!

586
01:05:51,607 --> 01:05:53,996
No! Let him go. I know him.

587
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:57,796
He needs time to cool off.
I'll speak to him later.

588
01:06:01,007 --> 01:06:03,123
The victors! Where's your friend?

589
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:06,085
- What friend? Do I get a drink?
- Absolutely.

590
01:06:06,247 --> 01:06:08,841
- Scotch and soda.
- Dewar's and soda.

591
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:13,762
- You met Cal Reynolds, class of '35?
- Hi, Charlie. Congratulations.

592
01:06:13,927 --> 01:06:18,125
St Luke's class of '35. That's why
he looks so down in the mouth.

593
01:06:18,287 --> 01:06:20,482
I wish we had found Greene first.

594
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:25,038
- St Luke's wouldn't have taken him.
- No, probably not.

595
01:06:25,207 --> 01:06:28,324
- Why not?
- They wouldn't have enrolled a Jew.

596
01:06:28,487 --> 01:06:30,876
Not even for a championship.

597
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:34,718
A Jew?

598
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:43,198
Holy shit!

599
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:47,998
Reynolds, have I ever told you
how nicely you keep a secret?

600
01:06:49,447 --> 01:06:51,438
Sorry.

601
01:07:22,847 --> 01:07:26,362
- I can't believe I dropped that pass.
- Neither can I.

602
01:07:26,527 --> 01:07:28,518
- Punish me.
- Suffer!

603
01:07:28,687 --> 01:07:31,076
Forget it, Rip! We won.

604
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,238
We won!

605
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,487
Hey, Dillon. What a block, boy!

606
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:42,605
- I taught him all he knows.
- God save me!

607
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:46,806
- You did play a great game, Dillon.
- Well, we beat St Luke's.

608
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,764
That was the grand plan.
Mission accomplished.

609
01:07:50,927 --> 01:07:54,237
The old boy network
bought us a victory.

610
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:55,840
But...

611
01:07:57,087 --> 01:07:59,203
The joke is on us.

612
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:01,758
What joke?

613
01:08:02,127 --> 01:08:05,881
- You didn't hear the joke?
- All right. Let's hear it.

614
01:08:06,047 --> 01:08:10,563
True story. Last weekend,
there was a religious revival meeting.

615
01:08:10,727 --> 01:08:13,639
Bishop Sheen
gave such a stirring address

616
01:08:13,807 --> 01:08:16,958
that 10,000 people
converted to Catholicism.

617
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:22,242
Then Billy Graham got up and,
after an hour of inspired preaching,

618
01:08:22,407 --> 01:08:25,558
10,000 people
converted to Protestantism.

619
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,083
Finally, to end the programme,
Pat Boone got up

620
01:08:29,287 --> 01:08:32,359
and sang
<i>There's a Gold Mine in the Sky</i>

621
01:08:32,527 --> 01:08:35,166
and 20,000 Jews
joined the Air Force.

622
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:42,485
What's the matter, David?
Don't Jews have a sense of humour?

623
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:51,041
It turns out our golden boy here

624
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:53,596
is a lying, back-stabbing kike.

625
01:08:57,087 --> 01:08:59,476
- Kike!
- You son of a bitch!

626
01:09:00,967 --> 01:09:02,844
Get the door.

627
01:09:03,007 --> 01:09:06,124
- Come on, damn it!
- I don't want to fight him!

628
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:09,245
Come on!
Go ahead! Deny it!

629
01:09:09,407 --> 01:09:11,443
- Deny it!
- I don't want to fight him!

630
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:14,565
It's true! It's true!
He's a heeb.

631
01:09:20,247 --> 01:09:22,238
Come on, stop it!

632
01:09:22,407 --> 01:09:24,443
All right, enough! Come on!

633
01:09:29,287 --> 01:09:31,482
No.

634
01:10:05,047 --> 01:10:08,596
You going to keep your face in a book
all year?

635
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:13,238
- What do you expect me to say?
- That it's no big deal.

636
01:10:13,407 --> 01:10:17,685
If it's no big deal, why didn't you
tell me in the first place?

637
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:22,035
- I'm your roommate.
- You never told me your religion.

638
01:10:23,247 --> 01:10:25,397
- Methodist.
- Methodist.

639
01:10:26,247 --> 01:10:29,637
- And all the time I didn't know.
- That's different.

640
01:10:29,807 --> 01:10:35,165
- Really? How is it different?
- It just is. Jews are different.

641
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:40,357
It's not like between
Methodists and Lutherans.

642
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:44,440
I mean, Jews,
everything about them is different.

643
01:10:45,767 --> 01:10:48,725
OK, let's get it out.
You think Jews are dirt.

644
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:52,318
- Come on, David!
- If you think like them, admit it!

645
01:10:52,487 --> 01:10:56,321
- Say it. Jews are greedy...
- Come off it! Come on!

646
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:00,086
Come on, I...

647
01:11:02,847 --> 01:11:06,920
You know the first day I came here,
I thought I was dreaming.

648
01:11:07,087 --> 01:11:11,922
I knew it was only for a year,
but I thought, man, what a year!

649
01:11:12,087 --> 01:11:14,078
I'd get into Harvard.

650
01:11:14,247 --> 01:11:18,081
It's not easy when you come
from Podunk Public High School.

651
01:11:18,247 --> 01:11:20,442
You guys were my friends.

652
01:11:22,687 --> 01:11:26,566
We were winning games.
I met Sally.

653
01:11:27,767 --> 01:11:33,797
I didn't want to be told I couldn't
be part of it because I was a Jew.

654
01:11:33,967 --> 01:11:38,597
Can you understand that?
It's happened before.

655
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:44,438
You could have told us.
It wouldn't have made a difference.

656
01:11:44,607 --> 01:11:47,519
Sure.
I knew that the first night I got here

657
01:11:47,687 --> 01:11:51,885
when I heard how McGivern
got his hi-fi. He "jewed him down".

658
01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:54,038
Remember?

659
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:59,762
Sure.
It wouldn't have made a difference.

660
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,558
One moment, please!

661
01:12:15,727 --> 01:12:19,117
I've graded
your take-home translations.

662
01:12:19,407 --> 01:12:21,602
They weren't all that bad.

663
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:25,880
Connors, especially,
wrote a near flawless translation.

664
01:12:28,647 --> 01:12:32,276
I noticed, Mr Connors,
like the rest of the class,

665
01:12:32,447 --> 01:12:36,042
you signed the Honour Code agreement.

666
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:41,316
- Yeah?
- This indicates a promise not to cheat.

667
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:43,079
Yeah.

668
01:12:43,247 --> 01:12:46,717
Use of a published translation
would be cheating.

669
01:12:46,887 --> 01:12:50,766
I didn't use anything
except a dictionary.

670
01:12:50,927 --> 01:12:53,919
If you say so.
Your translation, however,

671
01:12:54,087 --> 01:12:57,716
was a quantum leap
over your previous efforts.

672
01:12:59,327 --> 01:13:03,479
Maybe it's because
you're such a great teacher, sir.

673
01:13:06,607 --> 01:13:08,837
Pick up your graded papers.

674
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:31,439
Dillon. Dillon! Here he comes.

675
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,757
- A Jew!
- Grow up!

676
01:13:33,927 --> 01:13:36,157
Oh, Reece, you're so mature.

677
01:13:38,087 --> 01:13:42,877
Excuse me, there's no salt
on this table. I need salt for my fruit.

678
01:13:43,047 --> 01:13:47,882
- Someone's not doing his menial job.
- It's so hard to find decent help!

679
01:13:49,247 --> 01:13:53,638
- Can't you move any faster?
- I'll show you how fast I can move!

680
01:13:53,807 --> 01:13:56,002
David! David!

681
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:58,601
David, come on! It's not worth it.

682
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,758
It's not worth it, all right?

683
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:09,000
My name is Richard Collins.
What's yours? Reeceberg?

684
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:13,837
David!
I'll work your table, you take mine.

685
01:14:14,007 --> 01:14:16,567
You need this job as much as I do.

686
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:19,719
Come on, Greene, don't blow it,
all right?

687
01:14:20,767 --> 01:14:22,678
All right.

688
01:14:27,407 --> 01:14:32,606
I'm open. Pass it up!
McGoo, pass it up!

689
01:15:23,407 --> 01:15:25,204
<i>Lights out!</i>

690
01:15:55,767 --> 01:15:57,758
Cowards!

691
01:16:11,007 --> 01:16:12,599
OK, Elsie...

692
01:16:13,367 --> 01:16:15,881
Keep kicking! Good girl!

693
01:16:16,047 --> 01:16:18,880
Kick harder!
Reach forwards, that's it!

694
01:16:24,087 --> 01:16:26,442
Elsie, nice going.

695
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:31,004
Betsy, keep pulling.
Nice going, Anne Marie. Great!

696
01:16:35,207 --> 01:16:39,485
- May I help you?
- Yes, I have to talk to Sally Wheeler.

697
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:44,039
Sally, you have a visitor.

698
01:16:57,207 --> 01:16:59,596
- What?
- You wouldn't talk on the phone.

699
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:03,203
- Sally, take this outside.
- Yes, Miss Jones.

700
01:17:11,447 --> 01:17:16,396
- Did you have to come here?
- I had to hear it from you.

701
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:20,162
You have no idea
what you've put me through.

702
01:17:20,327 --> 01:17:24,400
- My mother is going on and on.
- You could have said on the phone.

703
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:28,799
My friends,
they just keep pestering me.

704
01:17:28,967 --> 01:17:32,323
They say, "What's
it like to kiss a Jew? Does his..."

705
01:17:33,247 --> 01:17:35,238
Go on.

706
01:17:39,407 --> 01:17:43,286
- "Does his nose get in the way?"
- Nice friends.

707
01:17:47,007 --> 01:17:49,157
At least they're honest.

708
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:53,764
All that stuff about Scranton,
you didn't say the important thing.

709
01:17:53,927 --> 01:17:55,918
That's not right, David.

710
01:17:56,087 --> 01:18:02,083
I was afraid you wouldn't want
to be with me. Would you?

711
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:10,077
Don't look at me that way.

712
01:18:10,927 --> 01:18:12,918
This may be a surprise,

713
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:17,763
but you're not the first Jew I've met,
just the first who denied it.

714
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:21,522
I'm the same guy, Sally.

715
01:18:29,847 --> 01:18:31,838
I know.

716
01:18:37,127 --> 01:18:39,925
No, I'm sorry.
It just can't happen.

717
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:43,803
No, it can't happen.
Just... Not now.

718
01:18:45,407 --> 01:18:48,205
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie to you!

719
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:51,803
I lied to my father.
I lied to myself.

720
01:19:03,527 --> 01:19:06,121
I have to get back to practice.

721
01:19:09,847 --> 01:19:11,838
Go ahead.

722
01:19:56,367 --> 01:19:58,358
- Test Act?
- 1685.

723
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,837
1686.
Jack, suspend Protestant bishops?

724
01:20:02,007 --> 01:20:04,999
- What?
- Suspend Protestant bishops?

725
01:20:06,287 --> 01:20:08,642
- 1606.
- McGoo, Declaration...

726
01:20:21,247 --> 01:20:24,717
I either know this stuff now
or I'll never know it.

727
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:26,843
Sack time.

728
01:20:36,367 --> 01:20:38,835
Are you sure your notes are right?

729
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:42,636
Yeah. Now all I have to do
is remember them.

730
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:34,484
Please reaffirm your Honour Code.

731
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:41,403
This test will comprise
30% of your final grade.

732
01:21:43,127 --> 01:21:45,118
You may begin.

733
01:22:23,967 --> 01:22:26,162
Oh, shit!

734
01:22:26,807 --> 01:22:28,798
Bless you!

735
01:23:04,487 --> 01:23:07,877
Time is up, gentlemen.
Papers to the front.

736
01:23:13,607 --> 01:23:16,326
Well, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

737
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:22,161
My, my, Mr Connors. You usually
don't have this much to communicate.

738
01:23:23,847 --> 01:23:28,238
You were bound to ask
the right questions sooner or later, sir.

739
01:23:29,647 --> 01:23:31,638
Dismissed, gentlemen.

740
01:23:34,887 --> 01:23:38,163
What's with Rip?
He must have gone down in flames.

741
01:23:38,327 --> 01:23:41,717
- Sure, and I guess you aced it?
- Naturally.

742
01:23:43,447 --> 01:23:48,157
You're dead! You are dead!
You are a fink! Connors, you jerk!

743
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:31,598
Be seated, gentlemen.

744
01:24:39,727 --> 01:24:44,118
I regret to announce that
someone cheated on yesterday's exam.

745
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:47,677
Everyone signed the Honour Code.

746
01:24:47,847 --> 01:24:51,886
So we have a rather bleak situation
confronting us.

747
01:24:53,767 --> 01:24:57,680
Today is Saturday.
Your next class is on Monday.

748
01:24:58,767 --> 01:25:03,522
If the cheater does not come forward,
or is not identified by then,

749
01:25:03,687 --> 01:25:07,282
I will be forced to fail
the entire section.

750
01:25:07,967 --> 01:25:10,117
Need I remind you what that means?

751
01:25:10,287 --> 01:25:13,199
Isn't that unfair?
Only one of us cheated.

752
01:25:13,367 --> 01:25:16,359
We have all been dishonoured
by this person.

753
01:25:16,807 --> 01:25:20,163
How can you be sure
that someone cheated, sir?

754
01:25:21,527 --> 01:25:25,645
I prefer to keep the evidence to myself
for the time being.

755
01:25:26,567 --> 01:25:30,037
- Can't you give us another test, sir?
- That's fair.

756
01:25:30,207 --> 01:25:34,200
And pretend no one cheated?
But someone did cheat.

757
01:25:35,007 --> 01:25:38,602
Whoever has done this
has robbed you of your honour.

758
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:43,045
If I ignore it, he will have robbed me
of mine, as well.

759
01:25:45,887 --> 01:25:48,720
I leave it in your hands, gentlemen.

760
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:11,877
- Someone had better answer quick.
- Someone must have seen something.

761
01:26:12,047 --> 01:26:14,481
Yeah, and then what do we do?

762
01:26:14,647 --> 01:26:19,357
I work my ass off for four years and
now one lying bastard ruins my life!

763
01:26:19,527 --> 01:26:22,803
- Take it easy.
- Whoever did this, admit to it!

764
01:26:22,967 --> 01:26:27,802
- You can't let him fail the whole class.
- You still have time.

765
01:26:27,967 --> 01:26:32,757
I've got this appalling feeling.
I have a good idea who did it.

766
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:34,599
Who?

767
01:26:34,767 --> 01:26:36,962
- Connors.
- You like having teeth?

768
01:26:37,127 --> 01:26:39,925
Cleary all but accused you in French.

769
01:26:40,087 --> 01:26:43,921
Cleary is a sick shit
and so are you, you four-eyed runt!

770
01:26:46,127 --> 01:26:50,803
I've been in more trouble
than all of you and I always admit to it.

771
01:26:50,967 --> 01:26:54,198
- So admit to this.
- Come here, you little runt!

772
01:26:54,847 --> 01:26:56,917
Come on! Come on, Jack!

773
01:27:01,127 --> 01:27:04,005
You bastards aren't pinning this
on me.

774
01:27:10,007 --> 01:27:12,475
Fine. Just fine.
Very cool, McGoo.

775
01:27:12,647 --> 01:27:15,684
I'm sorry,
but this could ruin all our lives.

776
01:27:16,207 --> 01:27:18,641
Look, we've got three prefects here.

777
01:27:18,807 --> 01:27:20,957
You guys have got to handle this.

778
01:27:21,127 --> 01:27:25,723
Let's sleep on it and meet tomorrow
after Chapel in the Founders' Room.

779
01:27:25,887 --> 01:27:28,196
Whoever's guilty, think it over.

780
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:33,160
- Dillon, we have to talk.
- We've got nothing to talk about.

781
01:27:33,327 --> 01:27:36,364
I know it was you.
I can describe the crib sheet.

782
01:27:36,927 --> 01:27:41,364
That's Gierasch's evidence.
Have you seen it since you used it?

783
01:27:41,527 --> 01:27:45,600
If you saw me and didn't report it,
you'd be in violation, too.

784
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:48,679
I know.
But I can't let the whole class fail.

785
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:53,716
- He's bluffing. He won't fail anybody.
- Gierasch wouldn't bluff.

786
01:27:53,887 --> 01:27:57,357
David, you don't understand
the way it is.

787
01:27:57,527 --> 01:28:00,519
You don't know what
this can do to you.

788
01:28:00,687 --> 01:28:04,157
My family expects me to measure up
to the impossible.

789
01:28:04,327 --> 01:28:07,876
- I try, but I can't.
- Set it straight, Dillon.

790
01:28:08,047 --> 01:28:10,038
- David, David!
- What?

791
01:28:10,207 --> 01:28:13,995
Look... I'm begging you.

792
01:28:15,887 --> 01:28:19,402
I'm sorry. I was a prejudiced prick.
I know.

793
01:28:19,567 --> 01:28:23,242
It's nothing to do with that.
Just confess.

794
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:27,519
All right!

795
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:32,284
Nothing for nothing, right?
How much is it going to cost?

796
01:28:32,447 --> 01:28:35,200
Either you tell them or I'll tell them.

797
01:28:35,487 --> 01:28:38,445
Son of a bitch!
Stay where you belong!

798
01:28:41,007 --> 01:28:45,637
All I want to know is how many of
you guys think I could have done it?

799
01:28:45,807 --> 01:28:48,719
- You did screw up some assignments.
- So?

800
01:28:48,887 --> 01:28:52,641
- What are you pulling? C?
- What about this French test?

801
01:28:52,807 --> 01:28:56,356
- Cleary says he cheated.
- Why wouldn't he cheat again?

802
01:28:56,527 --> 01:29:00,759
- I told you I didn't cheat.
- How can we believe you?

803
01:29:00,927 --> 01:29:03,760
- Maybe we should...
- All right. Lay off.

804
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:06,316
It wasn't Connors.

805
01:29:08,727 --> 01:29:11,002
This isn't easy for me to say.

806
01:29:11,167 --> 01:29:15,046
I know it's going to disappoint
some of you and I'm sorry.

807
01:29:15,207 --> 01:29:17,323
I should have said yesterday.

808
01:29:17,487 --> 01:29:20,399
- I know who cheated.
- Who?

809
01:29:21,767 --> 01:29:24,235
- It was Greene.
- What?

810
01:29:24,407 --> 01:29:28,036
- Yeah, I saw him.
- You're a liar! I saw him cheat.

811
01:29:28,207 --> 01:29:32,041
- Just admit it.
- I gave him the choice of confessing.

812
01:29:32,207 --> 01:29:34,004
Hey! Hey!

813
01:29:34,967 --> 01:29:38,846
I saw you cheat!
Word of Honour I saw him cheat.

814
01:29:39,007 --> 01:29:41,123
Let's tell Gierasch the situation.

815
01:29:41,287 --> 01:29:43,721
What?
I turned him in and he's denying it.

816
01:29:43,887 --> 01:29:47,641
- Tell Gierasch!
- We have to make the decision here.

817
01:29:47,807 --> 01:29:50,401
Would you both trust us to be fair?

818
01:29:50,567 --> 01:29:53,718
- Of course I do.
- Greene? Do you trust us?

819
01:29:53,887 --> 01:29:56,481
- Why should he?
- Why shouldn't he?

820
01:29:56,647 --> 01:29:58,842
Unless he's hiding something.

821
01:29:59,247 --> 01:30:02,125
- Greene?
- David, don't do it, all right?

822
01:30:03,047 --> 01:30:06,198
This is the way it's always been done,
right?

823
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:09,359
This is the way it's always been done.

824
01:30:09,527 --> 01:30:14,317
All right. You guys decide.

825
01:30:45,287 --> 01:30:48,199
It's one guy's word
against the other's.

826
01:30:48,367 --> 01:30:52,360
- Maybe we should go to the Head.
- We can handle it ourselves.

827
01:30:52,527 --> 01:30:56,645
- Let's just do it.
- Have we heard from everybody?

828
01:30:56,807 --> 01:30:58,798
Donald?

829
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:03,716
I submit Dillon didn't cheat.
He didn't have to.

830
01:31:03,887 --> 01:31:07,800
- He'll be fifth generation at Harvard.
- Not like Greene.

831
01:31:07,967 --> 01:31:11,323
- But like McGivern and Princeton?
- So?

832
01:31:11,487 --> 01:31:13,955
So, nothing's for sure, McGoo.

833
01:31:24,207 --> 01:31:28,280
Let's go over this again.
There's an objective fact.

834
01:31:28,447 --> 01:31:30,597
One has lied and one hasn't.

835
01:31:30,767 --> 01:31:33,440
- David never lied.
- Yes, he did.

836
01:31:33,607 --> 01:31:37,122
- He lied about being a Jew.
- No one asked him.

837
01:31:37,287 --> 01:31:40,836
Because no one had any idea,
because he lied.

838
01:31:44,007 --> 01:31:48,717
Gierasch says it was block-printed.
No way to tell who wrote it.

839
01:31:50,007 --> 01:31:53,966
He said the reputation of the school
is on our shoulders.

840
01:31:54,127 --> 01:31:58,166
- Screw the school! What about us?
- We get our lives ruined.

841
01:31:58,327 --> 01:32:01,603
My life is screwed
if I don't get into Yale.

842
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:06,887
- I need my grades for a scholarship.
- I can't tell my father I failed History.

843
01:32:07,047 --> 01:32:10,926
We've busted our butts,
now one person is killing us.

844
01:32:11,487 --> 01:32:14,604
- It's got to be Greene.
- Rip, what do you think?

845
01:32:15,727 --> 01:32:19,845
I don't know. I mean, what's
so different about him, anyway?

846
01:32:20,007 --> 01:32:23,158
Everything!
It's like my dad says about Jews.

847
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:26,478
He madly tried to ingratiate himself.

848
01:32:26,647 --> 01:32:29,798
- Bullshit!
- He wanted success without working.

849
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:34,199
- He was a senior.
- Jesus! Leave the Jewish stuff out!

850
01:32:34,367 --> 01:32:37,677
We can't, because David is Jewish,
stupid!

851
01:32:37,847 --> 01:32:40,122
- You're a bigot.
- I resent that.

852
01:32:40,287 --> 01:32:44,041
Resent it all you want.
You were the first to needle him.

853
01:32:44,207 --> 01:32:46,357
Hey! Hey!

854
01:32:47,487 --> 01:32:49,796
I confess.

855
01:32:49,967 --> 01:32:53,357
I admit it, you know,
I'm an anti-Semite.

856
01:32:53,527 --> 01:32:56,883
I crack Jew jokes.
I think they're greedy, pushy.

857
01:32:57,927 --> 01:33:02,443
But you want to know something else?
David Greene's the first one I met.

858
01:33:02,607 --> 01:33:05,724
- What's your point?
- He was a good guy.

859
01:33:05,887 --> 01:33:07,878
That guy wouldn't cheat.

860
01:33:09,607 --> 01:33:13,156
- Which means you think Dillon did.
- Yeah, I do.

861
01:33:13,327 --> 01:33:15,682
That makes two of us.

862
01:33:18,687 --> 01:33:21,804
- Three.
- I can't believe this!

863
01:33:21,967 --> 01:33:25,676
- I can't either.
- You're dumping Dillon for a dirty Jew!

864
01:33:38,287 --> 01:33:40,881
It's now one a.m.
Are we going to decide?

865
01:33:41,047 --> 01:33:43,117
Not unless we can be fair.

866
01:33:43,287 --> 01:33:46,165
You know he cheated.
We know what Jews are like.

867
01:33:46,327 --> 01:33:49,922
How many do you know?
When did you last have one home?

868
01:33:50,087 --> 01:33:51,998
I only have to know one.

869
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:55,842
- He stole Dillon's place on the team.
- Then his girl.

870
01:33:56,007 --> 01:33:59,477
- Stabbed him in the back.
- He's not even paying.

871
01:33:59,647 --> 01:34:03,481
Wake up, guys!
Can't you see what's going on here?

872
01:34:04,287 --> 01:34:07,882
You want to nail Greene
because he knew how you feel.

873
01:34:08,047 --> 01:34:10,163
- Anyone else tired of this?
- Yes!

874
01:34:10,327 --> 01:34:14,286
- Let's vote. Hands or secret ballots?
- Secret ballots.

875
01:34:14,447 --> 01:34:17,644
Look, if we do this,
we do it out in the open!

876
01:34:17,807 --> 01:34:20,605
Ballots!

877
01:34:53,447 --> 01:34:56,120
As Head Prefect, I've been asked...

878
01:35:04,047 --> 01:35:08,245
It's the finding of the class,
the majority of the class,

879
01:35:08,407 --> 01:35:11,604
that the guilt lies with David Greene.

880
01:35:13,567 --> 01:35:18,243
Mr Greene, you're requested
to turn yourself in to the headmaster.

881
01:35:31,727 --> 01:35:33,718
All right.

882
01:35:34,527 --> 01:35:36,836
I'll honour your traditions.

883
01:35:37,007 --> 01:35:39,157
I'll go to the headmaster.

884
01:35:39,327 --> 01:35:41,318
And I'll lie.

885
01:35:57,687 --> 01:35:59,678
Thanks, buddy.

886
01:36:00,847 --> 01:36:02,917
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

887
01:36:29,407 --> 01:36:31,523
Good morning, Mr Greene.

888
01:36:32,167 --> 01:36:35,682
We were wondering
if you'd changed your mind.

889
01:36:35,847 --> 01:36:40,238
- You know why I'm here?
- Indeed. To confess to cheating.

890
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:44,238
That's right.
I cheated on the History exam.

891
01:36:44,407 --> 01:36:47,843
No, David. You did no such thing.

892
01:36:55,887 --> 01:36:58,959
I saw Dillon cheat.

893
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:03,837
He was my roommate for four years.

894
01:37:21,447 --> 01:37:24,564
Thank you, Mr Van Kelt.
You're excused.

895
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:30,997
David...

896
01:37:31,167 --> 01:37:33,158
I'm sorry.

897
01:37:43,567 --> 01:37:47,640
- I did break the Honour Code.
- Yes. As did Van Kelt.

898
01:37:47,807 --> 01:37:53,564
But the Honour Code is a living thing.
It cannot exist in a vacuum.

899
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:59,685
We absolve you both on that account.
Mr Dillon, however, is expelled.

900
01:38:01,367 --> 01:38:06,077
David, you represent the best
of what we hope for at St Matthew's.

901
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:09,398
Please, don't think of leaving.

902
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,082
Good. Then it's settled.

903
01:38:15,887 --> 01:38:19,766
- I'd like to forget this ever happened.
- No, sir.

904
01:38:20,407 --> 01:38:23,638
You never will,
because I'm staying here.

905
01:38:23,807 --> 01:38:27,516
Every day you see me,
you'll remember that it happened.

906
01:38:27,687 --> 01:38:29,757
You used me for football.

907
01:38:29,927 --> 01:38:34,398
I'll use you to get into Harvard.
Excuse me.

908
01:38:53,887 --> 01:38:56,082
You know something?

909
01:38:56,247 --> 01:38:59,444
I'm still going to get into Harvard.

910
01:38:59,607 --> 01:39:03,077
And in ten years,
nobody will remember any of this.

911
01:39:03,247 --> 01:39:08,241
- But you'll still be a goddamned Jew.
- And you'll still be a prick.

912
01:42:45,687 --> 01:42:47,678
