1
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,121
Evelyn, did Jesus have a big sister?

2
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:05,291
No, Dermot, he didn't.
He wasn't as lucky as you.

3
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:09,087
He had two daddies, though.
God the Father and Joseph the carpenter.

4
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,340
Did Joseph ever do a bit of painting
and decorating like my dad?

5
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,683
Evelyn, you take the boys home.
l'll go find your mother.

6
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,393
-All right, Dad.
-Good girl.

7
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,897
l want the big one.

8
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,733
The big one's mine.
l'm the biggest. Come on.

9
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,903
l told you l was just going to the pub
for a Christmas drink.

10
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,404
Why kick up such a fuss?

11
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,574
Who was he?
You were all over him like a bloody rash.

12
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,825
Don't be stupid.

13
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,952
Sounds like Mommy and Daddy are back.

14
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,121
Right in front of all our friends, too.

15
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,958
Jesus.

16
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,752
You frozen little mites.

17
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,420
Come here, now.

18
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,799
We were arguing
if the chimney was wide enough for Santa.

19
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,469
lt's great we're on the top floor
so Santa can park his reindeers, and that.

20
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,722
lt is. He's got the whole roof to land on.
Say goodnight to Mommy.

21
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,349
When will Santa be here?

22
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,309
Santa's gonna be here very soon.

23
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,353
Off to bed with the lot of you.

24
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,648
-Santa will come when you're asleep.
-l won't be able to sleep.

25
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,984
You will, love. Take your jumper
and boots off. Not up on the bed.

26
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,903
-You all right?
-Yes, Daddy.

27
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,614
Okay. All right. Night-night.

28
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,381
Daddy, where's the carriages?

29
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,679
Son, Santa was a bit
strapped for cash this year.

30
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,391
lt costs a lot of money to feed those elves.

31
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,810
How much do they cost?

32
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,229
lt costs lots and lots.

33
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,356
Happy Christmas.

34
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,607
Granddad!

35
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:42,782
My little Christmas angel.
l hope you were a good girl. Were you?

36
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,660
-There's Granddad.
-Happy Christmas, everybody!

37
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,624
All right. Look at what you've got there.

38
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,710
Thanks, Granddad!

39
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,628
Granddad!

40
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,565
No money, no job.

41
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,776
Happy Christmas.

42
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,614
Look on the bright side, son.

43
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,700
Come the New Year, you'll have a new job.

44
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,204
You and the kids will be set up.
The world will be your oyster.

45
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,623
We never died a winter yet.

46
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,253
Oh, of all the money

47
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,298
that ever I earned

48
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:44,803
I spent it in good company

49
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,349
And all the harm that ever I done

50
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,062
Heidi, we're going to see Angela.

51
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,731
She's my best friend.

52
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,069
She has a dolly, too.

53
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,613
l'm sure she'd like to meet you.

54
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,826
Mommy's going shopping, Heidi.

55
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,954
Do you like her nice new shoes and coat?

56
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,208
But this is St. Stephen's Day.

57
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,045
Mommy, come back, it's St. Stephen's Day.
The shops are shut!

58
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,836
Daddy!

59
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,048
Be quiet.

60
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,674
-Daddy!
-What?

61
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,512
Mommy's gone. She was all dressed up
when she went away with a man in a car.

62
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,028
Jesus, don't let me down now. Come on.

63
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,993
She's your daughter.
You say you don't know where she's gone?

64
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,287
She's your wife,
and you don't know, do you?

65
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,873
l always said this would end in tears.

66
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,751
Should never have got stuck
with a corner boy like you.

67
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,169
Who's her fancy man?

68
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,047
ls it the bastard l saw her with in the pub?

69
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,759
-Your language is appalling.
-Your bloody....

70
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,095
Your bloody daughter is appalling.

71
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,473
l hope you don't use language like that
in front of your daughter.

72
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,017
Don't tell me how to bring up
my own daughter.

73
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,520
You obviously know sweet F.A. about it.

74
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,563
Where did she meet him? ln the pub?

75
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:05,360
No, you're the one who spends all his time
there. No wonder she got sick of you.

76
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,487
-l treated her well.
-Yeah?

77
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,533
l never raised a hand in anger to her once,
though she gave me just cause for it.

78
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,326
Maybe that's where l went wrong.

79
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,979
Here you are, love.

80
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,480
Hot milk.

81
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,899
Christmas pudding.

82
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,320
You want some of this?

83
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,406
lt's very nice.

84
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,700
No.

85
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,745
Why not? You must be starving.

86
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,706
She made it.

87
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,551
Maurice, give him the ball back.

88
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,432
l hear her fancy man is English.

89
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,268
Bastard. l might have guessed.

90
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,062
Good day, gentlemen.

91
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,481
l'm lnspector Logan of the SPCC.

92
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,151
Mrs. Daisley, your mother-in-law, l believe,
told us of your plight.

93
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,820
The SPCC?

94
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,074
The Society
for Prevention of Cruelty to Children?

95
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,158
That's correct.

96
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,619
ls she saying
that l've been cruel to my kids?

97
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,287
Not at all, Mr. Doyle.

98
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,165
We only have the children's welfare at heart.

99
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,293
To lose their mother at this age
can have a traumatizing effect.

100
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,004
How's that any business of yours?

101
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,505
l'm here to help you.

102
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,299
l understand you've no income
to support your family.

103
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,384
-Correct?
-Yeah.

104
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,678
Do you have any female relatives
to call upon?

105
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,889
Maureen. Des' mother, died a long time ago.

106
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:45,145
Then, Mr. Doyle, you have no choice but
to approach the authorities for assistance.

107
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,439
l will arrange for the Sisters to call.

108
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,232
We don't need your charity.

109
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,985
You have no job
and no mother for your children.

110
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,779
He's right, son.

111
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,702
All right.

112
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,455
Send in the nuns.

113
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,217
Sit still.

114
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,678
But l don't like cabbage.

115
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,515
lt is very good for you.
Eat it up. l don't want to hear about it.

116
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:31,483
You are a painter and decorator by trade,
but your attempts to secure employment...

117
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,027
since your wife's departure
have been unsuccessful.

118
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,737
Yes, sir. Your Honor.

119
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,615
But it's only been a couple of weeks.

120
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,118
And there's a big job coming up
at the Robert West House...

121
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,080
but that's not until the end of March.

122
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,332
And you have no other source of revenue?

123
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,543
Sir, my father, Henry,
who's sitting here, and myself...

124
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,463
we're setting up a tour of the Dublin pubs.

125
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,966
Surely that will represent expenditure
rather than income.

126
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,218
No, Your Honor.

127
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,637
We'll be playing music for money.

128
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,765
My father was a professional musician.

129
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,143
He played for Radio Eireann
until retirement age.

130
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,479
Dessie has a fine voice, Your Honor.

131
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,189
l'm sure he has.

132
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:15,235
But you won't be able to support your family
on that alone, will you?

133
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,531
Maybe not, Your Honor.

134
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,128
Under Section 10
of the Children's Act, 1941 ...

135
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,757
l hereby rule that
until there is a significant improvement...

136
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,803
in the domestic and financial circumstances
of Desmond Doyle...

137
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,932
his two sons, Dermot and Maurice...

138
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,811
will be placed in care
of the Christian Brothers in Kilkenny...

139
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,939
and his daughter, Evelyn Doyle...

140
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:57,277
will be committed
to St. Joseph's School in Dublin.

141
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,614
And l hope you don't have to leave them
in care for too long.

142
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,540
Daddy!

143
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,420
Come here. Come sit down.

144
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,298
-l wanna go home.
-l know you wanna go home.

145
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,134
We're gonna go home soon. Listen.

146
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,179
l love you very much.
You must understand that.

147
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,260
Granddad, there's St. Joseph, Jesus' daddy!

148
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,515
l'll pray to him to get us home.
He'll understand.

149
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,059
That's right, love, he'll understand.

150
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,001
Mr. Doyle, l'm Brother Eustace.

151
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,412
Look at the rays.

152
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,876
-Do you know what these are?
-No, Granddad.

153
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,252
Angel rays.

154
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,213
-Angel rays?
-Yes.

155
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,594
These mean that your guardian angel is
reminding you that he's waiting to help you.

156
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,221
All you have to do is believe in him.

157
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,142
Angel rays.

158
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,107
Look, pet, your favorites.

159
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,651
He's helping you already.

160
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,531
Granddad, please don't leave me here.

161
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,035
l don't want to stay here with the Sisters.
l hate them!

162
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,080
They're the Brides of Christ.

163
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,540
Then why do they wear
black, horrible dresses?

164
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,876
Brides should wear white dresses!

165
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,129
What's going on?
Have you been bold, young lady?

166
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,841
lt's all right.
l just dropped a tube of fruit gums.

167
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,135
-Come along, now.
-No.

168
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,555
Granddad, please don't go.

169
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,183
-Let go, now.
-Let go of me!

170
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,559
Please, Granddad!

171
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,023
Please be a good girl for the Sisters.
l'll come back and see you soon.

172
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,900
Disgraceful performance.

173
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,569
We'll teach you some manners in here.

174
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,490
We'll get you cleaned up,
you dirty little tinker.

175
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,617
Mr. Doyle.

176
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,792
Sister, please don't cut her hair.

177
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,336
lt's her father's pride and joy.

178
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,437
Thank you, Sister Brigid.
l'm sure we'll manage fine.

179
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,232
One large nun should be enough
to scrub one small girl.

180
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,817
Of course, Sister Felicity.

181
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,737
l was just making sure
she didn't throw another tantrum.

182
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,363
She's a willful one.

183
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,907
Wasn't our Lord a willful one, too?

184
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,660
l'm sure she'll be fine. Won't you?

185
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,290
Thank you, Sister Brigid.

186
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,627
Don't look so worried.

187
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,714
This is standard procedure for new girls.

188
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:32,427
Otherwise, the place would be jumping
with lice and fleas and God knows what.

189
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,055
Come on, take your clothes off.

190
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,059
Don't be shy.

191
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,727
After all...

192
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,230
bare-naked
is how God created Adam and Eve.

193
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,817
lt's how he sent the Baby Jesus
into the world.

194
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,071
Good.

195
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,616
We'll have you squeaky clean
in no time at all.

196
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,203
Come on, sit down.

197
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,246
Shoes.

198
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,043
You can call me Felicity.

199
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,754
What's your name?

200
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,839
Evelyn Doyle.

201
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,716
Pleased to meet you.

202
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,552
Pleased to meet you, Sister Felicity.

203
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,853
Good afternoon, ladies.

204
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,940
Could you spare a few pence
for the poor black babies of Africa?

205
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,693
-Here you are.
-lt's a very good cause.

206
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,654
Thanks, God bless you.
You're very generous.

207
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,615
-Give us another pint, please.
-You've had enough.

208
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,158
Listen to you....

209
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,452
l'm sick of people telling me what to do.

210
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,706
You just get us another pint.

211
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,041
Fine.

212
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,586
-Just a few pennies from you, there?
-There you go, Father.

213
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,132
Those little orphans,
they really need your charity.

214
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,342
Father...

215
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:59,055
you lot have taken my babies!
You've made my babies orphans.

216
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,439
Fair play to you.

217
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,650
That's a great right cross
you have on you there.

218
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,486
Right, here we are.

219
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,371
Quiet! Too much talking.

220
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,290
Just down here, love.

221
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,878
Down you sit.

222
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,256
Don't let my teeth fool you. l don't bite.

223
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,176
She's a sweetheart, that Sister Felicity.

224
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,846
lt's Frigid Brigid you've got to watch out for.

225
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,516
She could put the fear of death
into a corpse, so she could.

226
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,394
l'm Mary.

227
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,563
-l'm Annette.
-l'm Lauren.

228
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,773
l'm Evelyn.

229
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,693
-Your soup doesn't look very good.
-You'll get used to it.

230
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:58,198
You get used to most things here.
Half the kids in lreland are cooped up here.

231
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,034
How long have you been here for?

232
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,163
-Six months?
-Six years.

233
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,251
l won't be here for long.
My daddy's gonna come and get me.

234
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,295
That's what my dad told me.

235
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,429
l'm sorry, Desmond.

236
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,557
l was the seminary boxing champion.

237
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,601
-Really?
-Let that be a lesson to you.

238
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,813
Never underestimate the strength
of the Church militant.

239
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,857
-God bless.
-Thanks, Father.

240
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,446
lf you want your kids back that badly,
you should get a good lawyer.

241
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,949
They cost money.

242
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,618
Go and see Michael Beattie.

243
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,453
Twenty-four Upper Mount Street.

244
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,622
-Say l sent you.
-Fair enough.

245
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,751
l'll say the new barmaid at Fergal's Pub
sent me. That'll impress him.

246
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,754
Tell him Bernadette sent you,
you cheeky oaf.

247
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,716
Bernadette Beattie, his little sister.

248
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,260
l'm working here part-time
to help Uncle Fergal.

249
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,012
l'm a trainee chemist, actually.

250
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,223
So, you're the beautiful niece
Fergal's always bragging about.

251
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,101
l bet you have lots of fellows
running after you.

252
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,439
Yes. But none of them
have managed to catch me yet.

253
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,234
You're not a bad-looking woman,
now that l look at you.

254
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:20,071
Of course, with this bump on my head,
l'm probably hallucinating.

255
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,288
Bless you, John.

256
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,251
Once again,
until we achieve unity and harmony.

257
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,337
Where do we say our night prayers?

258
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,172
Not in the bed...

259
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,717
not under the bed, but by the bed.

260
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,762
Then kneel by your beds and give thanks.

261
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,647
Get a move on, Evelyn.
You're keeping us all waiting.

262
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,870
We do not lie like that, on our stomach.
lt tempts the Devil.

263
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,499
We lie on our back
and cross our arms like this.

264
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,252
l will check every night
that you are sleeping in this position.

265
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,172
We must not tempt Lucifer.

266
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,220
No more talking. Good night, girls.

267
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,763
Good night, Sister.

268
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,268
Mr. Doyle, family law in this jurisdiction...

269
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:36,731
is a cozy conspiracy between
the Catholic Church and the lrish State.

270
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,733
They're in cahoots.

271
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,240
You're saying that you're all frightened
if you take them on, you'll never work again.

272
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,033
Something like that.

273
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:52,372
l suggest you come back to me when
your circumstances are more favorable...

274
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,290
and l'll see what l can do.

275
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:58,628
On the banks of the roses,
my love and I sat down

276
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,590
And I took out my fiddle,
for to play my love a tune

277
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:07,387
In the middle of the tune
she sighed and she said

278
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:11,307
''Oh, Johnny, lovely Johnny,
why'd you leave me?''

279
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:19,149
Oh, when I was a young man,
I heard my father say

280
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:23,028
That he'd rather see me dead
and buried in the clay

281
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:26,781
Sooner than be married to any runaway

282
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,660
On the lovely sweet banks of the roses

283
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:34,539
On the banks of the roses,
my love and I sat down

284
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,418
And I took out my fiddle,
for to play my love a tune

285
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:43,214
In the middle of the tune
she sighed and she said

286
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:47,093
''Oh, Johnny, lovely Johnny,
why'd you leave me?''

287
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,224
''Oh, Lord, l vow never more to offend thee...

288
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,686
''and carefully
to avoid the occasions of sin.''

289
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,646
...and the meadows they are gay

290
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:02,942
And me and my true love
will sit and sport and play

291
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:08,990
On the lovely sweet banks of the roses

292
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,952
On the banks of the roses,
my love and I sat down

293
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:16,706
And I took out my fiddle,
for to play my love a tune

294
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,917
In the middle of the tune

295
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,503
-Look who's back.
-Straight from Chicago.

296
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,254
How's my favorite lrish colleen?

297
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,548
-l'm well. How are you?
-l'm great.

298
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,855
Who's your man in the sharp suit,
over there?

299
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,232
How should l know?

300
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,567
He looks like a Yank.

301
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:48,029
Maybe he's a friend of hers.
Maybe he's a chemist.

302
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,992
lf l can regain your attention for a moment...

303
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,285
we'll have requests.

304
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,372
Apart from Nobody's Child.
We're not fond of that now.

305
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,500
-Boys of Wexford.
-Whistling Gypsies.

306
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:07,882
-Are you still not talking to Grandma?
-No, l'll never speak to that woman.

307
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,552
She blames your father for everything.

308
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,471
May she rot in Hell, the old witch.

309
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:18,768
Jesus says we should forgive
those who trespassed against us.

310
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,311
lt's in the ''Our Father.''

311
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,904
-Grandma, would you like a fruit gum?
-Thanks, love.

312
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,323
Granddad gave them to me.

313
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,327
l won't bother then, love.

314
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,706
Listen, love,
there is something you must tell him.

315
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,377
lt's really warm.

316
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,505
...stuff it, will you?

317
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,174
Good girl.

318
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,636
Grandma's got a letter from Sydney.

319
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,721
Sidney, who?

320
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,765
Sydney in Australia.

321
00:25:56,848 --> 00:26:00,060
-Australia?
-lt's from Mommy, she's in Australia.

322
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,480
She didn't give her address,
but it said Sydney on the postmark thing.

323
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,773
l might have guessed.

324
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:07,525
She always had the wanderlust,
your mother.

325
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,612
-Grandma said it's hot in Australia.
-lt is.

326
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:16,409
You can tell her it's not as hot
as the place where her daughter will end up.

327
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,578
Okay.

328
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:23,083
-That's it.
-Still no carriages, Dad.

329
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,751
No, son.

330
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,462
Still no carriages.

331
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:32,884
''Dear Daddy, it's great news that you have
such a good job, doing up that old house.

332
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:38,098
''I miss you and the boys
and Granddad very much...

333
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,934
''and I hope we can get back together soon.

334
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:45,689
''What did Granddad mean
when he told me to tell Grandma Daisley...

335
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,942
''that he hopes Mommy
meets a great white in Australia?

336
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:52,821
''I think it's a kangaroo,
but Mary thinks it's a koala bear.

337
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,866
''I like most of the nuns here.

338
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:59,953
''Sister Felicity is nice and kind...

339
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,496
''and so is Sister Theresa.

340
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,916
''But Sister Brigid is very scary. ''

341
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,795
ls God good, just and merciful?

342
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,339
Yes, Sister.

343
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:14,300
''Yes'' isn't the catechism answer, is it?

344
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,721
What does the catechism say?

345
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,598
lt says....

346
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:24,978
l've had enough of you, Annette Farrell.

347
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:26,646
Now...

348
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,441
God is infinitely good...

349
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,901
infinitely just...

350
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,611
and infinitely--

351
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,159
What are you saying to me, child?

352
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,120
l don't think you should do that, Sister.

353
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:46,583
lf God is infinitely merciful,
he wouldn't want you to do that.

354
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,127
You dare to question me about God?

355
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,213
lnsolent brat!

356
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:53,798
Right, outside.

357
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,350
Never...

358
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:07,228
never talk to me like that again!

359
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,727
Where's my daughter, Evelyn Doyle?

360
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,270
Do you have an appointment?

361
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:51,773
l don't need an appointment
to see my own daughter.

362
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,192
-Who are you?
-l'm Sister Brigid.

363
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,652
Are you?

364
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,156
lf you ever lay a finger
on my daughter again...

365
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:01,825
l will tear you...

366
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:04,119
limb from limb.

367
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:06,621
Now, where is she?

368
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,667
ln the refectory, on the first floor.

369
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:12,794
Right.

370
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,136
-You shouldn't be on the premises.
-l've come for my daughter.

371
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,471
-You must leave.
-l'm not leaving without her.

372
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:27,350
-You know that's impossible.
-l'm having her back. Where is she?

373
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,644
You cannot barge in here--

374
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,023
There's no bloody laws in lreland
that will keep her away from me.

375
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,401
How dare you use language like that
in front of me.

376
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,695
Don't speak to me like that. l will not have it.

377
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:42,282
Daddy! Don't fight.
Don't fight with Sister Theresa!

378
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,202
lt's all right, love. Don't worry.

379
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,664
Can l see her?

380
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,168
Not if you're going to run off with her.

381
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,170
That'll just get you arrested.

382
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,339
Okay, l promise.

383
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,468
l just wanna hold her for a second.

384
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,637
l give you my word, all right?

385
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,894
Evelyn, your daddy's here to see you.

386
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:16,816
lt's good to see you.

387
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:19,486
Daddy, have you come to take me home?

388
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,199
Yes.

389
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,702
l'll be taking you home soon, pet.

390
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,165
Very soon.

391
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,264
l hear you're doing well at your new job.

392
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,393
My circumstances have improved,
as you would say.

393
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,187
So, you'll take the case, then?

394
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:59,192
You've been drinking, haven't you?
l can smell it off your breath.

395
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:02,904
Since we're not planning on kissing,
l don't see a problem.

396
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,906
lt's not going to help our case...

397
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:08,284
if the court thinks
you're drinking your pay packet.

398
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,911
Our case?

399
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,706
That means you'll take it, then?

400
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,583
Who is this gobshite?

401
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,253
This ''gobshite''
is the Minister for Education.

402
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:22,465
He's claiming we require the consent
of your wife for the release of your kids.

403
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:26,011
How can we get her consent
when she's disappeared?

404
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:29,347
Even her pudding-faced old mother's
got no address.

405
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:32,350
lt's the law. Yours is a unique case.

406
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,644
Normally, the wife would be deceased.

407
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:38,064
She ran out on her kids.
What kind of mother would do that?

408
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:42,444
We could argue that she's emotionally
incapable of bringing up the children...

409
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:45,780
but l'm afraid all of that is,
strictly speaking, irrelevant.

410
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,824
The law still requires her consent...

411
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:50,577
no matter how irresponsibly
she may have behaved.

412
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,746
To hell with the law.

413
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:56,291
That attitude will get us nowhere, Desmond.

414
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:01,212
l've done everything l was asked to do.

415
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:05,342
That District Judge or Justice
didn't tell me l'd need my wife's consent.

416
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:09,679
He definitely misdirected you,
which gives us a useful basis for a start.

417
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,931
But it may not be material enough...

418
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:15,685
for a challenge in law,
as there are no precedents for your case.

419
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:19,022
We'll make the bloody precedent!
l want justice!

420
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:23,151
The law and justice
are two entirely different things.

421
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:25,445
Jesus. You can say that again.

422
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:28,031
Of course, l'm only a solicitor.

423
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:31,076
l'm not entitled to speak
in a court case like this.

424
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,828
We need a barrister.
And they're very expensive.

425
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,872
l don't care how much it costs.

426
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,583
l'll work round the clock, if l have to.

427
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,962
To fight Church and State
is to fight Goliath.

428
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,135
David beat Goliath, in the book l read.

429
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:56,810
-lt's a first edition.
-ls it?

430
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:57,852
Yeats.

431
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:00,855
lt'll be grand, l tell you.
l've got it all worked out, Dad.

432
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:02,899
Don't worry about it.

433
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,658
-Get us another pint.
-You'll have another one?

434
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,284
l will.

435
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:16,287
Make mine a large one, Bernadette.
A pint for Desmond.

436
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,373
You two are knocking them back tonight.

437
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,959
Poor Dessie's going through
a rough time lately.

438
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,502
Aren't we all fond of a drink?

439
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:26,297
That's right, Henry.
You can't hold that against a man, can you?

440
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:28,883
That lad of yours is going through hell.

441
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,095
-l think he's drinking to forget.
-You're right, Fergal.

442
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:36,683
l wonder if our American friend knows
the one thing worse than drinking to forget.

443
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:40,562
-Do you know what that is, son?
-Worse than drinking to forget? No.

444
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:42,313
Forgetting to drink.

445
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:44,399
l'll drink to that.

446
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,819
That wife of his
didn't know the meaning of the word ''love.''

447
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:48,987
Love.

448
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,407
lt's strange. The Greeks
have all these different words for love.

449
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:55,285
''Philia,'' ''agapi,'' ''eros.''
We have just the one.

450
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,912
We use the same word
for our nearest and dearest...

451
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,331
as we do for a packet of cigarettes.

452
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,585
-lt's interesting, isn't it?
-l think it's very interesting.

453
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:07,130
Did you know that Eskimos
have over 40 different words for snow?

454
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,716
-ls that a fact?
-lt's true. The wife told me that.

455
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:12,052
She should know. She's frigid.

456
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,512
You're an awful man.

457
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,563
-l keep telling you not to drink and drive.
-l'm not drinking and driving.

458
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,648
l drank before l drove.

459
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:30,737
-l don't think this is a good idea.
-lt's the only way, Dad.

460
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:32,572
lt's the only way.

461
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:56,179
-l can see the dormitory, there.
-We should come back some other time.

462
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:59,099
No. l've got to rescue the poor little mite.

463
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,267
Right, we've come this far.

464
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,146
Jesus.

465
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:07,816
They've greased the top of the wall.

466
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,401
Mind yourself, son.

467
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,144
Bernadette!

468
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:45,979
You're drenched!

469
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:47,355
That'll be the rain.

470
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,065
You're one to talk.

471
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:51,526
l just....

472
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:53,945
Come in.

473
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,951
-Sit yourself down.
-lt's okay. l'm not staying.

474
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,328
All right. Suit yourself.

475
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,290
l'll get you a towel. A clean one.

476
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:09,461
This place needs a good cleaning.
lt's got more empties than Fergal's.

477
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,343
Looking for a towel here somewhere. God.

478
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,849
Here we go.

479
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,319
There it is.

480
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,323
You can have it, if you want.

481
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:41,493
As a reward
for putting me in touch with your brother.

482
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:43,370
l had no idea you could do this.

483
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:47,290
There's lots of things l can do
that you don't know about.

484
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,084
l'm sure there are.

485
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:51,920
We're saving up for a housekeeper.

486
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:54,422
You know anyone who's suitable?

487
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,759
lt's not a housekeeper you need.
lt's a barkeeper.

488
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:00,261
You know what your problem is?

489
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:03,515
You think all you have to do is smile
with that cheeky twinkle...

490
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:06,351
and everything will be grand.
lt's time you grew up.

491
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:09,813
-You like my cheeky twinkle, then?
-You drink too much!

492
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,482
Ridiculous. l've got a lot on my mind.

493
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:16,695
-Like a trip to Scotland with your kids?
-What?

494
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,865
How do you know about that?

495
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,076
Because the tickets fell out of your coat.

496
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,788
An adult and three kids?
Who could that be, l wonder?

497
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:30,417
l knew you were up to something.
You big idiot.

498
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,711
Don't call me a big idiot!

499
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:36,589
l'll bet you want someone smooth,
like the Yank.

500
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:40,760
Whose jokes you laugh at all the time
like he's Oscar bloody Wilde.

501
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:44,639
Nick's funny. And he's more of a ladies' man
than Oscar ever was.

502
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,766
l get the message.

503
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,478
You fancy him.

504
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:54,274
Don't tell me who l fancy.
That's for me to decide.

505
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,985
What l don't want is a drunkard...

506
00:37:57,068 --> 00:38:01,114
who has some mad notion about
sneaking off with his kids to Scotland.

507
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,451
Why should you care?

508
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:07,037
What business is it of yours?

509
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:12,459
Because l don't want
to have to visit you in prison.

510
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:16,171
Has anybody ever told you
you're a fine woman?

511
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:20,467
Lots of men.
Some of them weren't even married.

512
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:32,062
-Not until you give me the tickets.
-What?

513
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:36,191
Give me the ferry tickets.
l'll take them back and get you a refund.

514
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,692
Jesus, woman.

515
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:42,030
You drive a hard bargain. Where are they?

516
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,158
Here you go.

517
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:48,370
-Thanks.
-l always get sick on the ferry, anyway.

518
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:54,334
-l just think, you know, you and l--
-Do you really think l'd kiss you now?

519
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,378
lt'd be like kissing a soggy beer-mat.

520
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:59,923
-But you just said--
-No. l said you have to give up the drink.

521
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:02,634
For God's sake.
That's the hardest thing to do.

522
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:06,096
The second hardest.
Getting your family back is the hardest.

523
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:18,358
Oh, of all the money that ever I had

524
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:22,487
I spent it in good company

525
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:27,659
And all the harm that ever I've done

526
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:31,955
Alas it was to none but me

527
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:37,252
And if I had money enough to spend

528
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:41,131
And leisure time to sit awhile

529
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,927
There is a fair maid in this town

530
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,932
Who sorely has my heart beguiled

531
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:56,062
Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips

532
00:39:56,646 --> 00:40:00,859
I own she has my heart in thrall

533
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:06,906
So, fill to me the parting glass

534
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:11,995
Good night and joy be with you all

535
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,213
Good man, Des.

536
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:25,008
Lovely. Good man.

537
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,970
Thank you very much, everyone.

538
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:33,224
You've been wonderful. God bless you all.
We hope to see you again next week.

539
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,393
Okay. God bless. Good night.

540
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:39,939
Come on.

541
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,358
You all right?

542
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,401
Dessie, l....

543
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:47,113
Look at me. Are you okay? Dad, come on.

544
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:49,783
Jesus!

545
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,243
Dad. Someone get a doctor.

546
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:54,704
Here, Johnny!
Go and run for a doctor, quick!

547
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,039
l'm here.

548
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,792
-Dessie.
-l'm here, Dad.

549
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:01,836
-The kids.
-We'll get them back.

550
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:03,338
You and l, together.

551
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:07,634
Dad.

552
00:41:11,888 --> 00:41:14,015
Henry, it's Father O'Malley.

553
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:18,269
lf you can hear me,
say the Act of Contrition.

554
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,582
Amen.

555
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,851
Look, angel rays.

556
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:02,439
What's angel rays, love?

557
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:05,400
lt's Granddad letting us know
he's watching over us.

558
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:08,236
He's our guardian angel.

559
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:12,490
He told me all about angel rays.

560
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,120
Good old Dad.

561
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,831
l knew he wouldn't leave us.

562
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:38,058
-Good morning, Miss Gilhooly.
-Mr. Doyle.

563
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,560
-Didn't you get the letter?
-What letter?

564
00:42:40,685 --> 00:42:42,687
The one canceling this appointment.

565
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:44,647
l didn't get any letter.

566
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:47,484
l've taken this morning
especially off work to see him.

567
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:50,945
This is my family we're talking about.
Where is he?

568
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:12,258
Jesus.

569
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:33,822
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

570
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:00,348
Lilo! Higgi! Come on!

571
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:02,851
Sorry, sir. lt's a trespasser.

572
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:05,437
lt's all right. This is a client of mine.

573
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:07,564
-A client, sir?
-Yes!

574
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:10,108
We have an appointment!

575
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,487
Please let us know in the future, sir,
if you're expecting visitors.

576
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:22,078
What the hell are you smirking at?
Do you think this is funny?

577
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:26,332
Do you think you can cancel appointments
and treat people like dirt?

578
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,918
-Mr. Doyle--
-l wasn't talking to you, Yank.

579
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:32,505
All you're good for's wearing sharp suits,
doing fancy deals...

580
00:44:32,547 --> 00:44:34,424
and trying to get hands on our women.

581
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:37,093
-And our fish!
-Desmond, be reasonable.

582
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,346
l'm sorry l missed our appointment...

583
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:42,682
but there's really nothing more
l can do for you anymore.

584
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:44,017
Really?

585
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:47,937
Your being sorry
isn't gonna get my kids back, now, is it?

586
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:51,441
l'm sure the Yank here is having great fun...

587
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:55,487
seeing what a lot of bloody spineless
jellyfish we've got over here.

588
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:58,406
But ask yourself this, Mr. Big Shot.

589
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:01,576
What if it was your family?

590
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:04,746
Wouldn't you fight tooth and nail
to get them back?

591
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,583
Or are you just another
heartless, gutless bastard?

592
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,043
Congratulations.
You just found yourself a lawyer.

593
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:53,628
ls that a fact?

594
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:55,755
Who?

595
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:57,257
Me.

596
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,468
So, you're not a chemist, then?

597
00:46:01,052 --> 00:46:03,680
How come you can work over here
if you're a Yank?

598
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:05,932
Actually, l'm lrish.

599
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:09,227
l was born and reared in Kilkenny
till l was 9.

600
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:12,939
Then we emigrated to the States
and l subsequently came back here...

601
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:14,524
to study law at UCD.

602
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:17,110
So, he's qualified to plead in lrish courts.

603
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:20,238
Does my being a Yank bother you?

604
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:22,615
Not at all. l like Yanks.

605
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:25,952
Most of them were lrish
to begin with, anyway.

606
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:29,330
But l can't afford to pay you fancy money.

607
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:32,292
l'm not doing this for the money.

608
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,420
You'll just have to raise enough
to cover our costs.

609
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:38,089
Right.

610
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:42,093
l really appreciate your help, so l do.

611
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:44,888
We'll do our best for you.

612
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:46,723
-Right. Cheerio.
-Cheerio.

613
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:55,106
-We'll do our best?
-We're in this together, my friend.

614
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,984
Do you think l'll take this on
with any other solicitor?

615
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,987
We have no chance.
l don't know why you're taking it on.

616
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:05,033
Because l know what he's going through,
through no one's fault but my own.

617
00:47:05,116 --> 00:47:07,410
l lost my own kids in that divorce.

618
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:11,581
-You don't realize what we're up against.
-l do realize what we're up against.

619
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:16,169
What possible chance
do you think you have?

620
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:17,712
You and Mr....

621
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:20,507
-Mr. Doyle.
-Mr. Doyle, here.

622
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,635
A painter and what? Decorator?

623
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:26,680
Master tradesman, to you.

624
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:31,142
Apart from anything else,
it will be prohibitively expensive.

625
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:32,727
Only if we lose.

626
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:35,397
-You'll lose, Mr....
-Beattie.

627
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:40,151
You'll lose, because
if you were to win this case...

628
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:43,405
the whole basis of family law
would be undermined.

629
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:47,534
And believe me, gentlemen,
that will not be allowed to happen.

630
00:47:47,617 --> 00:47:50,161
We thank you for your advice, Mr....

631
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:52,205
Shall we?

632
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,340
By the way, Minister...

633
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:05,593
your paintwork's shite.

634
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:11,182
What we really need
is an expert in family law to keep us right.

635
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:13,435
-You know?
-l thought you were an expert.

636
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:17,856
l haven't done family law in 20 years.
l've only a working knowledge.

637
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:22,736
You mean you don't know what you're
talking about? Can't you read some books?

638
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:26,364
lt's not quite as simple as that.
lt's a very tricky area.

639
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:30,994
We've still got the problem that everyone's
terrified of taking on the Establishment.

640
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:34,914
What was the name of that guy
that lectured us about family law?

641
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:37,334
-Remember? The real character.
-Tom Connolly.

642
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:41,129
There was a Connolly who played rugby
for lreland until his cartilage went.

643
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:44,257
l think he did a bit of law in his spare time.
Would that be him?

644
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:50,013
Gentlemen, l'm flattered by your attentions,
but l retired two years ago.

645
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:54,392
ln short, l can no longer face
speaking in court.

646
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:59,230
Sir, you wouldn't have to speak in court.
Mr. Barron here will do all the speaking.

647
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:02,275
But frankly, sir, he needs your help.

648
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:04,861
My family law is so rusty.

649
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,531
Even if you could just come on board
as a consultant.

650
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,535
l'm sorry to say this to you, Mr. Doyle.

651
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,333
But they'll put forward the best people
to put the case for the State.

652
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,628
The best that money can buy.

653
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,005
That's why they hated me.

654
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:26,007
l wouldn't be bought.

655
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:30,553
l believe that if there is a God,
He'll step in to help us.

656
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:35,392
l'm touched by your faith.

657
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:42,107
This is the only Holy Spirit
l've found to be of any practical assistance.

658
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:44,734
Slainte.

659
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:53,660
You were a big hero to me as a boy,
Mr. Connolly.

660
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:55,954
To my dad, too.

661
00:49:56,037 --> 00:49:59,249
He took me to all your games.
You see that photo there?

662
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,794
l was at that game.
The one where you got injured.

663
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:05,338
That was the beginning of the end.

664
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:08,633
When that big brute of a fullback
did my cartilage in.

665
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:11,386
He was English, of course. The bastard.

666
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:14,347
Still, before l left the field...

667
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:17,684
l managed to boot him where his balls
would have been, if he'd any.

668
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:19,185
Fair play to you.

669
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,271
Anyway, lads...

670
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:24,357
your case is interesting.

671
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:26,860
Hopeless, but interesting.

672
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:30,113
You really think it's hopeless?

673
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:33,241
This case is what l used to call
''a real St. Jude.''

674
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:34,826
Why St. Jude?

675
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:38,705
Because St. Jude
is the patron saint of hopeless cases.

676
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:44,085
As l recall, sir, you've won
quite a few St. Judes in your time.

677
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:49,215
l suppose l have.

678
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:54,179
Retirement must be excruciatingly boring
for a man like yourself.

679
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:11,946
Gentlemen...

680
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:15,200
l propose a toast.

681
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:18,620
Justice and St. Jude.

682
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:24,918
I am Desmond Doyle...

683
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:29,589
father of Evelyn Doyle, who's been held
in your care without my consent.

684
00:51:30,256 --> 00:51:33,093
l request the return
of my daughter, forthwith.

685
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,137
Mr. Doyle, you cannot have your daughter.

686
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:41,309
ln that case, my solicitor,
Mr. Michael Beattie...

687
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:43,895
will present you
with a writ of habeas corpus...

688
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:47,107
drafted by my counselor,
Mr. Nicholas Barron.

689
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,193
Duly presented.

690
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,320
Duly witnessed.

691
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:55,323
Thank you, Sister. That's all we need.

692
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,041
-So, it went well, then?
-lt went like a dream.

693
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:08,253
Desmond remembered all his lines,
and spoke them beautifully.

694
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:10,463
Laurence Olivier had better watch out.

695
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:13,174
-You didn't attack a nun, then?
-l did not.

696
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:15,510
l'm learning the rules of the game.

697
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:17,804
-What do we do now?
-We wait.

698
00:52:18,346 --> 00:52:21,099
No. That's just what they want us to do.

699
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:25,478
They'll do nothing for months
and hope that we'll go away.

700
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:29,357
Nothing will happen
unless we force their hand.

701
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:32,861
l'll give my old friend Hugh Canning a ring.

702
00:52:32,944 --> 00:52:34,070
Hugh Canning?

703
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:37,073
-But he's a sports commentator.
-Mostly, yes.

704
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:40,827
But he does a bit of everything.

705
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:51,379
May God grant you justice.

706
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:57,177
-Take this and run along, girl.
-Thank you, Sister.

707
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,266
What is it?

708
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,978
-Eileen, come here.
-What's going on?

709
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:11,191
''Desmond Doyle, a painter and decorator
from Fatima Mansions, Dublin...

710
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:14,861
''is a loving father who just wants
to spend time with his children...

711
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:17,364
''but the powers that be won't let him.

712
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,408
''Desmond's rosy-cheeked
little daughter, Evelyn....''

713
00:53:25,747 --> 00:53:28,917
At least they've set a date for the hearing.
That's the first step.

714
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,503
A little bit of gentle pressure did the trick.

715
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:34,506
We had to give the Minister
a kick up his fat ass.

716
00:53:35,173 --> 00:53:36,675
What do we do now?

717
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:40,679
You should smarten yourself up.
The press might want photos of you.

718
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:44,015
Try combing your hair, occasionally.

719
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:45,433
Shave.

720
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:50,730
Look as if you haven't just fallen out of bed.
Use me as a role model if you want to.

721
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:53,608
And buy a new pair of shoes
before we get to court.

722
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:55,610
-New shoes?
-Yes.

723
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:59,698
l've known judges who judge a man's
character by the state of his shoes.

724
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:11,001
-Here they come. Let's get a shot.
-Especially of the little girl.

725
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:13,962
-Come on.
-Get the three of them together, now.

726
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:18,550
-Daddy, l scored a goal in Gaelic!
-Daddy.

727
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:22,345
My loves! You look wonderful.

728
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:26,141
-Daddy, l like your new shoes.
-Thanks, Evelyn.

729
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:32,272
Ferris hasn't changed much since l knew
him. The torn-faced old poultice.

730
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:36,067
He's always looked like the Turin Shroud.

731
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:39,237
We used to call him ''Ferris the Ferret.''

732
00:54:39,529 --> 00:54:41,614
Which is an insult to the rodent.

733
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:45,744
Mr. Barron, you're representing
the petitioner, Desmond Doyle?

734
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,495
Yes, my lord.

735
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:52,459
We contend the judge at the District Court
hearing of January 10 of this year...

736
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:55,545
misdirected the petitioner,
Mr. Desmond Doyle.

737
00:54:56,671 --> 00:55:00,800
l refer you to the notes of that case
wherein the judge expressed his hope...

738
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:05,180
that Mr. Doyle would not have to leave
his children in care for too long.

739
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:07,974
Sadly, that has not been the case here.

740
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:13,646
The Children's Act of 1941 clearly states...

741
00:55:13,688 --> 00:55:17,859
that unless the spouse is deceased,
which is not the case here...

742
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:21,446
then the consent
of both parents is required.

743
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:25,784
This is the basis of our case, Your Lordship.

744
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:29,996
Provision of the Children's Act...

745
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,583
must be understood in its literal,
grammatical meaning.

746
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:37,170
''Both parents'' means exactly that.

747
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:41,424
l therefore find against the petitioner,
Desmond Doyle.

748
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:44,803
Thank you, Judge Hall.

749
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:46,429
Judge McLaughlin?

750
00:55:46,596 --> 00:55:50,475
With some reluctance,
l conclude that l, too, must find against...

751
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:54,521
the petitioner's application
and uphold the Minister's decision.

752
00:55:56,439 --> 00:55:59,484
-We've lost.
-That's absolutely ridiculous!

753
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:03,071
-Order in court!
-You rotten louses. Let his babies go home.

754
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:05,740
Silence, or l shall have the court cleared.

755
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:10,036
-Silence in court!
-He's loving this. The rodent.

756
00:56:13,873 --> 00:56:15,667
lt is incontrovertible...

757
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,296
that Section 10,
Subsection 1 of the Children's Act, 1941 ...

758
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:23,550
requires the consent of both parents.

759
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:27,721
ln the absence of such consent,
Evelyn Doyle and her brothers...

760
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:31,558
will remain in custody
until they are 16 years of age.

761
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:32,684
Daddy!

762
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:35,270
Furthermore, this court has decided...

763
00:56:35,311 --> 00:56:39,733
that since the Children's Act
is capable of no other interpretation...

764
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:43,236
any appeal
would be a waste of the court's time.

765
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:46,740
Right of appeal is therefore denied.

766
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:50,285
-No, you flea-faced rat!
-Who said that?

767
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:55,915
Was that you, Connolly?

768
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:03,673
This is Hugh Canning,
the man who broke the Doyle story...

769
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,343
covering this sensational new development.

770
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:07,802
Leave them alone.

771
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:09,471
Get your hands off my kids!

772
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,349
-Leave me alone!
-Daddy!

773
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,310
Unbelievable scenes here at the High Court.

774
00:57:15,393 --> 00:57:17,729
l've never seen anything like it.

775
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:21,900
Desmond Doyle struggles with the gardai
for possession of his children.

776
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:24,486
A pitiful scene to watch.

777
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:28,323
And who wouldn't sympathize with a father
in this situation?

778
00:57:28,823 --> 00:57:29,866
Daddy!

779
00:57:30,658 --> 00:57:31,743
Children!

780
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,870
Daddy, please!

781
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:11,449
ls Desmond Doyle here?

782
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:13,952
He's sitting over there, in the booth.

783
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,667
Sorry to interrupt you.

784
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:24,379
l'm Honest Joe O'Leary, racecourse bookie.

785
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:29,634
l owned the book
on the outcome of your court case.

786
00:58:29,884 --> 00:58:32,512
-The punters backed you heavy.
-Great.

787
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:35,098
l didn't feel right in keeping this...

788
00:58:35,223 --> 00:58:37,100
so l want you to have it.

789
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:44,190
Jesus.

790
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:46,026
My God.

791
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:51,114
lt's only £600, so l thought
it might go towards your court costs.

792
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:56,953
l don't know what to say, Mr. O'Leary.

793
00:58:57,037 --> 00:59:00,915
You don't have to say anything, Mr. Doyle.
You see, l grew up in an orphanage.

794
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,668
l wish my dad had your guts.

795
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:06,546
Good luck to you. Good night, all.

796
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,381
Good night.

797
00:59:09,466 --> 00:59:12,302
We're organizing a race next month.

798
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:16,139
-The Desmond Doyle Benefit Sweepstake.
-Great.

799
00:59:17,682 --> 00:59:20,727
-Put your money on Slippery Sam.
-Slippery Sam.

800
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:24,856
Grand man. Good night, now. God bless.

801
00:59:26,524 --> 00:59:30,153
This calls for a celebration.
Another round for the table.

802
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:31,863
Make mine a lemonade.

803
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,491
What? A lemonade? Are you all right, son?

804
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:36,826
No, l'm feeling terrible.

805
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,914
But maybe it's time l tried to feel better.

806
00:59:41,998 --> 00:59:42,957
Jerry.

807
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:50,840
Keep your eye on the ball, son.

808
00:59:53,968 --> 00:59:55,428
Dig it out.

809
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:57,389
-Dig it out.
-Thomas!

810
01:00:01,726 --> 01:00:05,522
-Good reflexes, you'll need them.
-Back in the lrish strip, l see.

811
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,984
lt helps me to see things more clearly.
Did you play rugby yourself, Nick?

812
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:14,280
No, l understand it's kind of
a Neanderthal version of American football.

813
01:00:14,364 --> 01:00:15,990
ls that what you think?

814
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:17,283
Hut, hut.

815
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:23,623
Hopeless.

816
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:25,875
So, anyway...

817
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:29,713
why have l invited you to this sacred turf?

818
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:32,590
-l was kind of wondering that.
-So was l.

819
01:00:32,632 --> 01:00:35,927
Me, too. lt's not exactly
how l planned to spend my morning.

820
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:37,262
You know...

821
01:00:39,222 --> 01:00:43,643
when my cartilage went
and they were taking me off on a stretcher...

822
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:46,479
l looked up and l saw this father...

823
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:50,316
holding his little child up on his shoulders.

824
01:00:51,234 --> 01:00:54,446
They thought l was a hero,
but you know something?

825
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:58,450
l envied that man so much. He was my hero.

826
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:04,456
All Desmond wants
is to hold his kids up on his shoulders.

827
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,958
We can help you to that.

828
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:10,045
But how, Tom? There is no right of appeal.

829
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:11,671
Ferris made sure of that.

830
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:13,548
We don't need an appeal.

831
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,176
Not if we bring an entirely new case...

832
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:19,346
based on an entirely different
principle of law.

833
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:22,515
But we're automatically barred
from bringing the same facts...

834
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:25,310
before the same court
that's already heard them.

835
01:01:25,393 --> 01:01:28,730
Be it the District Courts or High Courts,
we've nowhere else to go.

836
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:30,899
There is somewhere else to go.

837
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:32,650
The Supreme Court.

838
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:34,778
The Supreme Court?

839
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,697
We can't go there with this.

840
01:01:37,864 --> 01:01:41,034
They won't hear a case like this.
They only deal with big stuff.

841
01:01:41,117 --> 01:01:42,077
Yes.

842
01:01:42,827 --> 01:01:46,331
Like laws that contravene
the lrish Constitution...

843
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:49,000
which l've been reading.

844
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,297
Wait a second. Hold on.

845
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:58,385
Has anyone ever successfully
challenged the law on these grounds?

846
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:00,470
No.

847
01:02:05,183 --> 01:02:08,311
-What chance do you think we've got?
-Who knows?

848
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:13,024
But l've seen games won by teams
without any hope at all.

849
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,655
Bloody hopeless.

850
01:02:20,323 --> 01:02:23,618
Good evening,
and welcome to the very first edition...

851
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:25,870
of Conversations With Canning...

852
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:28,790
on this marvelous new medium
of the television.

853
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:33,545
For those of you who listen to my show
on the wireless...

854
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:36,715
I hope I'm even better looking
than you thought.

855
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,928
Now, many of you...

856
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:45,640
will remember these sad headlines
of last month.:

857
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:47,934
''Desmond's Despair. ''

858
01:02:49,185 --> 01:02:52,022
Desmond certainly isn't despairing
at the moment.

859
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:54,691
ln fact, he's sitting here, right beside me...

860
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:57,527
in our ultramodern television studio.

861
01:02:57,986 --> 01:03:01,906
And he's got new reasons for being hopeful,
haven't you Desmond?

862
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,116
Yes!

863
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,912
It's okay. You don't have to shout,
we can hear you fine.

864
01:03:08,496 --> 01:03:09,706
Fair enough.

865
01:03:09,789 --> 01:03:12,584
Doesn't he look handsome
when he smartens himself up?

866
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:15,795
He's learning. l've always told him
he should model himself on me.

867
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:20,300
...that your daughter Evelyn
and your two boys are being held illegally.

868
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:21,801
Yes.

869
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:27,390
And you'll be taking on
some pretty top people?

870
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,102
Yeah. We're gonna call
the Minister of Education as a witness.

871
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:36,483
And I've often asked myself,
''What drives Desmond Doyle?''

872
01:03:37,108 --> 01:03:39,736
-Desmond?
-I love my children.

873
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:43,990
I'm sick of saying goodbye to them
all the time.

874
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:47,494
I just don't want them
to spend their whole childhood crying.

875
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:50,413
-Has a date been set for the trial?
-Not yet.

876
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:53,124
But l want my kiddies home for Christmas.

877
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,378
Home for Christmas.

878
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,298
That's an inspiring note on which to end...

879
01:04:00,423 --> 01:04:03,385
this little conversation with Canning.

880
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:04,719
Holy Jesus.

881
01:04:05,303 --> 01:04:07,639
This thing will never catch on.

882
01:04:08,014 --> 01:04:10,767
...and we'll be following your case closely.

883
01:04:11,434 --> 01:04:12,560
And now...

884
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:15,980
the beautiful strains of the Irish harp.

885
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:23,029
Some good news, some bad news.

886
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:25,657
First, the good news. They've set a date.

887
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,118
-Second week in December.
-Great.

888
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:31,287
lt's a great time to have a trial.

889
01:04:31,454 --> 01:04:35,667
-Even judges are sentimental at Christmas.
-Not all of them, l'm afraid.

890
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,752
Guess who we've got again.

891
01:04:37,919 --> 01:04:39,629
-Ferris the Ferret?
-Yes.

892
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:43,425
He's been elevated
to the Supreme Court, apparently.

893
01:04:43,633 --> 01:04:45,301
Lousy luck.

894
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,013
Luck's got nothing to do with it.

895
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:52,851
lf you ask me, the State's planted him there
in an attempt to scupper us.

896
01:04:55,645 --> 01:04:58,231
Come on, eat up, there's plenty more.

897
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:02,152
Here, have a nice big fat sausage.

898
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:06,573
We're gonna make you lovely and lazy.
Might slow you up a bit.

899
01:05:08,324 --> 01:05:12,746
Sorry, Sam, nothing for you.
You're gonna get your feast after the race.

900
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:18,126
They're off, and it's a close-packed field
at the start now.

901
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:19,878
Come on!

902
01:05:23,882 --> 01:05:25,342
Stay up there, my boy.

903
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:27,218
Stay up. Yes!

904
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:30,722
They're battling it out, neck and neck.
Slippery Sam's edged in front.

905
01:05:30,805 --> 01:05:32,891
And as they come around the bend...

906
01:05:32,974 --> 01:05:35,268
Slippery Sam putting on
a tremendous effort.

907
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:55,413
O'Leary, how did you know?

908
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,083
Let's say l knew he was hungry for a win.

909
01:05:58,166 --> 01:05:59,876
-Good man.
-Desmond?

910
01:06:00,293 --> 01:06:03,546
The readers of the Irish Times
have voted you the Man of the Year.

911
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:06,883
-How do you feel about that?
-l'm honored. Who was second?

912
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:09,052
-The Pope.
-Fair play to him.

913
01:06:09,135 --> 01:06:10,595
Come on, Bernadette.

914
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:13,932
-Let's go and collect our winnings.
-Right you are.

915
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:16,685
Desmond, l've got a few bob, myself.

916
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:20,438
-How's it going with Bernadette, then?
-Great.

917
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:25,402
ln fact, l asked her to come back
to America with me, when the case is over.

918
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:27,070
Really?

919
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:29,072
What did she say?

920
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:31,408
She said she'd think about it.

921
01:06:34,744 --> 01:06:36,746
l asked her to move in with me.

922
01:06:37,122 --> 01:06:38,623
-Really?
-Yeah.

923
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:39,958
What did she say?

924
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,085
She said she'd think about it.

925
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:50,135
-Who knows what she'll do.
-Fatima Mansions versus the USA.

926
01:06:51,469 --> 01:06:52,971
Tough choice.

927
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:00,895
Sister, why don't you cut my hair?

928
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:02,564
You've cut everybody else's.

929
01:07:02,647 --> 01:07:06,526
Because they are not likely
to have their photos all over the newspaper.

930
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:08,403
Why should that make a difference?

931
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:12,824
l don't think that l should be treated special
just because my daddy's getting famous.

932
01:07:12,907 --> 01:07:15,869
But didn't your daddy tell us
not to cut your hair?

933
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:18,913
Yes, and didn't he tell you
to let me go home?

934
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,249
You didn't take a blind bit of notice.

935
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:22,667
Look....

936
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:26,796
lf l were to cut your hair,
Sister Theresa would not be amused.

937
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:29,424
l'll explain to my daddy if he gets cross.

938
01:07:29,507 --> 01:07:32,719
And who will explain it to Sister Theresa
if she gets cross?

939
01:07:32,802 --> 01:07:34,220
You, Sister.

940
01:07:34,512 --> 01:07:38,975
Hugh Canning reporting to you, live,
from outside the Supreme Court...

941
01:07:39,225 --> 01:07:42,562
on the first day of this historic case.

942
01:07:43,313 --> 01:07:46,274
A grand, official car has just arrived.

943
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:49,110
lt's the Minister of Education.

944
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:52,238
Looks as if he'd rather be
somewhere else, this day.

945
01:07:53,406 --> 01:07:56,534
This must be what soldiers feel like
just before battle.

946
01:07:57,327 --> 01:07:58,995
-Nervous?
-Nervous?

947
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:01,706
l'm only trying to make legal history...

948
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:06,127
by doing something that's never been
done before, and if l fail, l'm unemployable.

949
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:08,963
But if you win, son, you're immortal.

950
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:11,383
You're in the history books.

951
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:15,845
And you'll help take this country
out of the Dark Ages.

952
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,643
Rosary beads.
l thought you weren't religious.

953
01:08:22,686 --> 01:08:24,187
l'm not.

954
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:29,526
When the verdict comes in,
these are for counting the score.

955
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:33,780
Remember, Nick, speak from your heart.

956
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:38,201
l'll sit up in the gallery,
out of the Ferret's eye-line.

957
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:39,786
Thanks, Tom.

958
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:42,372
-Good luck, son.
-Thanks for everything.

959
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:46,042
Right.

960
01:08:50,296 --> 01:08:52,257
Let the battle commence.

961
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,301
-ls this all right?
-lt's fine.

962
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,764
Minister, three times now
you have refused...

963
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:03,351
to reconsider the case of Desmond Doyle.
ls that correct?

964
01:09:03,601 --> 01:09:07,230
lt is. A decision subsequently upheld
by the High Court.

965
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:12,736
Yes, but the grounds for our action now
are fundamentally different, is that not so?

966
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:15,864
l suppose it is.

967
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:20,910
Could you tell us, Minister, to whom or
to what do you owe your eminent position?

968
01:09:21,494 --> 01:09:22,620
Pardon?

969
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:24,581
Your job, sir. Who appointed you?

970
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:28,710
Objection, Your Lordship.
This is irrelevant, not to say insolent.

971
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,961
My lord...

972
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:34,507
counsel for the plaintiff
has indeed failed to establish relevance.

973
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:37,302
l am about to do so, Your Lordship.

974
01:09:37,385 --> 01:09:39,512
l hope so, Mr. Barron. Proceed.

975
01:09:41,389 --> 01:09:45,643
As Minister for Education, you are
a government appointee, are you not?

976
01:09:45,852 --> 01:09:47,145
Of course l am.

977
01:09:47,228 --> 01:09:50,398
What is the document on which
the lrish government's authority...

978
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:53,109
and therefore your authority, rests?

979
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:55,987
The lrish Constitution.

980
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:58,907
Have you read it recently?

981
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:01,284
Objection, Your Lordship.
This is insufferable!

982
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:05,330
Counsel for the plaintiff is not displaying
due deference to the witness, my lord.

983
01:10:05,413 --> 01:10:07,165
Objection sustained.

984
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:10,669
Be careful, Mr. Barron.
The witness must be treated with respect.

985
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:12,003
Yes, my lord.

986
01:10:13,546 --> 01:10:16,424
l would be grateful
if you could read out to the Court...

987
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:19,427
those short extracts
from the lrish Constitution...

988
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:23,306
which, we have established,
is the basis for your authority.

989
01:10:25,975 --> 01:10:27,185
''Article 1 .

990
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:31,272
''The lrish Constitution shall be consistent
with the law of God.

991
01:10:33,149 --> 01:10:34,442
''Article 41 .

992
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:38,613
''A parent and child have a fundamental
and God-given right...

993
01:10:38,697 --> 01:10:41,783
''to the enjoyment of each other's
mutual society.

994
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:46,162
''Article 42.

995
01:10:46,204 --> 01:10:50,125
''A blameless parent shall not be deprived
of his or her right...

996
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,293
''to direct the child's education.''

997
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:54,963
ls it fair to say
that by consistently rejecting...

998
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:57,882
Desmond Doyle's application
for the return of his children...

999
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:02,846
you have denied him
that fundamental and God-given right?

1000
01:11:03,346 --> 01:11:06,057
Would it be fair to say that, Minister?

1001
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:11,354
We are waiting for your response.

1002
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:14,357
That is a possibility.

1003
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:15,900
Yes.

1004
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:17,736
And is it also a possibility...

1005
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:21,322
that you have contravened
Article 42 of the Constitution...

1006
01:11:21,406 --> 01:11:26,202
by denying Desmond Doyle
the right to direct his children's education?

1007
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:28,496
Yes.

1008
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,207
That is also a possibility.

1009
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:35,837
-That is what we are here to determine.
-Exactly.

1010
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:39,215
And we will so determine.

1011
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:40,884
Good boy.

1012
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:42,927
No further questions.

1013
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:44,304
Well done.

1014
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:48,600
Article 42 of the Constitution...

1015
01:11:48,683 --> 01:11:51,269
refers to a blameless parent.

1016
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:55,857
And we contend that this concept
is tacit also in Article 41 .

1017
01:11:56,274 --> 01:11:58,610
That it is the blameless parent...

1018
01:11:58,693 --> 01:12:02,822
who has a fundamental, God-given right
to his children's society.

1019
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:04,824
This...

1020
01:12:04,908 --> 01:12:07,285
does not apply to Desmond Doyle.

1021
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:13,166
He came barging in, unannounced,
to the main building.

1022
01:12:13,249 --> 01:12:15,585
He was in a terrible rage...

1023
01:12:16,002 --> 01:12:18,171
and he looked like a man
possessed by the Devil.

1024
01:12:18,254 --> 01:12:22,384
Objection. Your Lordship,
the witness is demonizing my client.

1025
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:26,346
Not so, my lord. The Sister
is merely expressing herself vividly...

1026
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:29,933
using a figure of speech
appropriate to her occupation.

1027
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:32,936
Objection overruled. Proceed, Sister.

1028
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,689
He was like a man possessed.

1029
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:38,274
He shouted at me, ''Where is my daughter?''

1030
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:41,903
-He yelled at the top of his voice.
-And what did you say to him, Sister?

1031
01:12:41,986 --> 01:12:45,782
-l asked him if he had an appointment.
-And what did he say?

1032
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:49,786
He grabbed me by the throat
and almost choked the life out of me.

1033
01:12:49,869 --> 01:12:51,746
Throttling me, he was.

1034
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:54,708
He said if l didn't tell him
where his daughter was...

1035
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:58,378
he would tear me limb from limb.
Those were his exact words.

1036
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:02,799
-l thought he was going to murder me.
-And what did he do then, Sister?

1037
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:06,761
l told him where the girl was
and he ran upstairs...

1038
01:13:06,803 --> 01:13:09,305
repeating his threats as he did so.

1039
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:12,350
My neck was black and blue
from where his thumbs had been.

1040
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:15,186
Did you report
this deplorable incident to anyone?

1041
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:18,064
Yes, l phoned the police.
They will confirm every word.

1042
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:22,527
Sister Theresa decided, out of the charity
of her heart, not to press charges.

1043
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:24,821
No further questions, my lord.

1044
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:29,200
Have l messed it up for us all, then?

1045
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:30,994
You may have.

1046
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:34,664
We're just gonna have to show
that this was an isolated incident...

1047
01:13:34,706 --> 01:13:37,208
not part of a pattern of behavior.

1048
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:40,837
-l hope that was the only such incident?
-Of course it was.

1049
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,090
Apart from the time you tried to punch
Father O'Malley at Fergal's.

1050
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:45,175
That.

1051
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:49,429
-And when you tried to kidnap your kids.
-Yes, but l was drunk on both occasions.

1052
01:13:49,512 --> 01:13:53,099
For God's sake, don't try to use
drunkenness as a defense.

1053
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:55,018
lt doesn't impress them.

1054
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:58,813
Haven't you heard the phrase,
''As sober as a judge''?

1055
01:14:03,401 --> 01:14:05,153
So, you see, Your Lordship...

1056
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:09,824
l only shook Sister Brigid when
l found out she'd beaten up my little girl.

1057
01:14:09,908 --> 01:14:12,452
-l object, Your Lordship.
-Not as much as l object.

1058
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:14,996
l object to anyone laying a finger
on my kids.

1059
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,956
Objection upheld.

1060
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,168
That's Mr. Wolfe's objection,
not yours, Mr. Doyle.

1061
01:14:20,251 --> 01:14:22,253
Continue with your testimony.

1062
01:14:22,712 --> 01:14:25,131
Wouldn't any father have done what l did?

1063
01:14:25,423 --> 01:14:28,176
Evelyn's face was all battered and bruised.

1064
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:31,262
Silence in court.

1065
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:37,644
Even as a very dubious kind of Catholic...

1066
01:14:37,727 --> 01:14:40,355
who finds himself throttling a nun...

1067
01:14:40,605 --> 01:14:44,484
you must know that the fundamental
building block of our society...

1068
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:45,735
is the family...

1069
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:48,697
whose very model is the Holy family...

1070
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,740
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1071
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:54,786
How can you, as a single father
and as a Catholic...

1072
01:14:55,453 --> 01:14:58,665
possibly claim to bring up your children
without a mother?

1073
01:14:58,748 --> 01:15:01,418
There is absolutely no precedent for it...

1074
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:04,629
in the religion
in which you allegedly believe.

1075
01:15:14,472 --> 01:15:16,891
Cat got your tongue...

1076
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,102
Mr. Doyle?

1077
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,443
There is....

1078
01:15:28,945 --> 01:15:32,073
There is a precedent, as you'd like to call it.

1079
01:15:32,115 --> 01:15:33,908
What are you saying?

1080
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:39,122
The fundamental building block of our faith
is not the Holy family...

1081
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:41,708
it's the Holy Trinity.

1082
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:44,627
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1083
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,464
When my mother died...

1084
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:51,176
my father brought us up on his own...

1085
01:15:51,509 --> 01:15:54,095
with only the Holy Spirit to guide him.

1086
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:56,931
He used to say the Holy Spirit was love.

1087
01:15:56,973 --> 01:16:00,310
Doesn't the Holy Bible say,
''...faith, hope and love...

1088
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:04,689
''but the greatest of these is love''?

1089
01:16:06,816 --> 01:16:08,777
l've given up the drink.

1090
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,615
l've worked all the hours God sends.

1091
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:18,286
l've become a better person
to try and fill myself with the Holy Spirit...

1092
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:21,289
so l can bring my kids up
surrounded by love.

1093
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:26,795
That's all l can do.

1094
01:16:28,296 --> 01:16:29,964
No man can do more.

1095
01:16:40,225 --> 01:16:41,643
Silence in court.

1096
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:43,019
Silence!

1097
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,606
No further questions.

1098
01:16:47,023 --> 01:16:49,984
Your Lordship, we would request
that the court is recalled...

1099
01:16:50,026 --> 01:16:52,654
when we have subpoenaed
our next witness...

1100
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:55,031
Evelyn Doyle.

1101
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:59,911
The bastards.
They'll intimidate the little soul.

1102
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:05,250
Lord Jesus, l have to go to the big court
soon, to answer some questions.

1103
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,502
Please let my daddy win.

1104
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:11,131
l know you're testing him,
but l think he's getting very tired.

1105
01:17:11,214 --> 01:17:13,675
Lord, please let him win.

1106
01:17:14,342 --> 01:17:15,427
Amen.

1107
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:28,273
-Daddy!
-Hello, love.

1108
01:17:29,315 --> 01:17:30,608
Your hair.

1109
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:32,569
l told them to cut it.

1110
01:17:32,944 --> 01:17:34,571
Don't you like it?

1111
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:37,615
lt's lovely, pet.

1112
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:39,117
lt suits you.

1113
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,411
You've got your new shoes on again.

1114
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:44,706
You've got to go now.

1115
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:46,124
Bye, Daddy.

1116
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:49,252
Silence in court.

1117
01:17:50,545 --> 01:17:53,089
The court will draw itself to order.

1118
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,724
Now, Evelyn Doyle...

1119
01:18:04,392 --> 01:18:08,188
do you remember the time in St. Joseph's,
when you tripped in the corridor...

1120
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:10,732
and bashed your face,
when you fell down the stairs?

1121
01:18:10,815 --> 01:18:12,067
No, sir.

1122
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:14,736
Think back to last March.

1123
01:18:15,403 --> 01:18:18,406
Apparently, Sister Felicity
had to give you some aspirin.

1124
01:18:18,698 --> 01:18:20,075
lsn't that correct?

1125
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:22,577
-Yes, sir, she did.
-And why was that?

1126
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:25,121
Because my face was all swollen
and black and blue.

1127
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:27,832
Because you had fallen down the stairs.

1128
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:30,502
No. That's what Sister Brigid said.

1129
01:18:30,585 --> 01:18:32,921
According to Sister Felicity,
you made no attempt...

1130
01:18:32,962 --> 01:18:37,550
to deny the fact that you had fallen
down the stairs and bruised your face.

1131
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:42,889
You didn't say otherwise, did you?

1132
01:18:42,972 --> 01:18:44,015
No.

1133
01:18:44,307 --> 01:18:45,725
l mean, yes.

1134
01:18:45,892 --> 01:18:47,227
l'm all mixed up.

1135
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:49,771
So, what really happened...

1136
01:18:50,313 --> 01:18:53,525
was exactly what Sister Brigid said
had happened.

1137
01:18:54,192 --> 01:18:57,612
And you made up a story
in your letter to your father...

1138
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:00,031
because you wanted to get out
of St. Joseph's...

1139
01:19:00,115 --> 01:19:02,617
and you thought a little lie would help.

1140
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:05,412
l didn't lie. l didn't make it up.

1141
01:19:05,495 --> 01:19:09,082
l know it must be a frightening
experience for you, Evelyn...

1142
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:12,127
being a little girl in a big court like this.

1143
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:16,631
You must try not to be scared. Even though
you're alone in front of all these people.

1144
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:35,066
l'm not scared anymore, Your Lordship,
and l'm not alone.

1145
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:38,111
My granddad is here with me.

1146
01:19:39,029 --> 01:19:41,573
See. He's letting us know he's here.

1147
01:19:42,532 --> 01:19:46,369
Your Lordship, the child's grandfather
died some months ago.

1148
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:48,496
She obviously has a very...

1149
01:19:48,663 --> 01:19:50,373
vivid imagination.

1150
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:54,210
Now, child...

1151
01:19:55,003 --> 01:19:57,255
let me ask you one last time...

1152
01:19:57,339 --> 01:20:01,551
do you remember falling in the corridor
and hitting your face on the stairs?

1153
01:20:01,634 --> 01:20:04,012
No, l didn't fall on the stairs.

1154
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:07,515
l was going to tell Sister Felicity
what really happened...

1155
01:20:07,599 --> 01:20:10,769
but then l thought
it would only get Sister Brigid into trouble.

1156
01:20:10,852 --> 01:20:13,938
So, l prayed that God
would forgive Sister Brigid for hitting me.

1157
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:16,608
This is a preposterous assertion.

1158
01:20:16,941 --> 01:20:19,736
Why on earth
would the good Sister hit you?

1159
01:20:19,778 --> 01:20:23,531
Because l said she shouldn't belt Annette
for getting her catechism wrong.

1160
01:20:23,573 --> 01:20:25,867
Poor little innocent. Shame on you.

1161
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:28,745
She was better off with Desmond Doyle.
l can see that now.

1162
01:20:28,828 --> 01:20:32,082
-Wait till l get you outside!
-Silence in court!

1163
01:20:35,752 --> 01:20:36,920
Evelyn Doyle...

1164
01:20:37,003 --> 01:20:40,924
do you expect this court to believe
that after she did that to you...

1165
01:20:41,007 --> 01:20:43,593
-you prayed for her?
-Yes, l did.

1166
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:46,262
l put it to you that you are lying.

1167
01:20:46,304 --> 01:20:48,723
Lying is a sin
against the Eighth Commandment.

1168
01:20:48,765 --> 01:20:52,352
''Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbor.''

1169
01:20:52,602 --> 01:20:55,855
l'm surprised you don't know that,
if you're a lawyer.

1170
01:20:56,272 --> 01:20:58,900
Sister Brigid told this court
the truth of the matter...

1171
01:20:58,942 --> 01:21:02,195
that she picked you up
when you fell down the stairs.

1172
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:06,449
No. That's not true.
Hope she goes to confession soon.

1173
01:21:09,744 --> 01:21:12,664
-Wanna hear the prayer l said last night?
-We do not.

1174
01:21:12,747 --> 01:21:14,290
Not so, Mr. Wolfe.

1175
01:21:14,374 --> 01:21:18,420
lt is material to the court's evaluation
of the child's character.

1176
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:22,132
Evelyn, let us hear your prayer, please.

1177
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:25,010
''Lord God...

1178
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:28,513
''you guide the universe
with wisdom and love.

1179
01:21:28,888 --> 01:21:31,891
''Hear the prayer we make to you
for our country...

1180
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:34,352
''the beautiful country of lreland.

1181
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:38,898
''Through the honesty of our citizens,
and the wisdom of those who govern us...

1182
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:41,359
''may lasting peace be delivered...

1183
01:21:41,609 --> 01:21:43,945
''and truth and justice flourish.''

1184
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:45,488
Amen.

1185
01:21:48,533 --> 01:21:50,577
-She's a credit to you.
-Thank you.

1186
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,829
Thank you, Evelyn. You may step down.

1187
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,791
The great day has finally arrived.

1188
01:21:56,833 --> 01:22:00,837
The day Desmond Doyle and his kids,
and indeed the whole of lreland...

1189
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,672
has been waiting for.

1190
01:22:02,714 --> 01:22:06,343
The day when Desmond finds out,
once and for all...

1191
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:08,595
whether he will get his kids back.

1192
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:12,140
Sister, why couldn't me and the boys
go to court today?

1193
01:22:12,223 --> 01:22:15,435
Because they don't want a repeat
of the scenes they had last time.

1194
01:22:15,685 --> 01:22:20,273
The Lord Mayor of Dublin has just
appeared in his official limousine...

1195
01:22:20,357 --> 01:22:22,817
and a beautiful car it is, too.

1196
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:27,155
l would remind you, however,
that never before...

1197
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:31,534
has a law been found repugnant
to the lrish Constitution...

1198
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:36,039
and that has to happen today,
if Desmond Doyle is to win.

1199
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:46,341
l now call on Justice Ferris
to deliver his judgment.

1200
01:22:47,884 --> 01:22:52,722
l am persuaded by Mr. Wolfe's argument
on behalf of the Minister for Education...

1201
01:22:53,306 --> 01:22:55,266
that the term ''parent''...

1202
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,353
in Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution...

1203
01:22:58,812 --> 01:23:01,981
must be held to imply both parents.

1204
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:05,443
There is no contradiction
between those Articles...

1205
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:07,862
and Section 10 of the Children's Act...

1206
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:12,409
and said Act
is not repugnant to the Constitution.

1207
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:17,580
l, therefore, find in favor of the defendant,
the Minister for Education.

1208
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:21,543
l'll strangle that ferret one day.

1209
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:27,632
lt's 1-0 to the Minister, with 2 votes to go.

1210
01:23:27,924 --> 01:23:31,302
The next Judge, Justice Daley,
must vote for Desmond...

1211
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:33,722
or it's all over for the Doyles.

1212
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:36,891
Don't despair, my child. Have faith.

1213
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,769
...or there'll be rioting going on.

1214
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,441
l agree with Mr. Wolfe...

1215
01:23:45,316 --> 01:23:48,445
that the Minister for Education has,
at all times...

1216
01:23:48,528 --> 01:23:51,364
acted in a reasonable
and conscientious manner...

1217
01:23:52,032 --> 01:23:54,743
within the provisions of the Children's Act.

1218
01:23:54,784 --> 01:23:58,580
l also agree with my learned
and honorable friend, Justice Ferris...

1219
01:23:59,205 --> 01:24:01,458
that there is no precedent for declaring...

1220
01:24:01,499 --> 01:24:04,169
an lrish Statute
repugnant to the Constitution...

1221
01:24:04,252 --> 01:24:07,756
-Please God, grant us a ''however.''
-...and therefore invalid.

1222
01:24:10,342 --> 01:24:13,428
However, despite the absence
of precedent...

1223
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:16,681
l find Mr. Barron's argument persuasive.

1224
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:20,769
ln any event, with respect to
my learned friend, Mr. Ferris...

1225
01:24:20,852 --> 01:24:23,188
it is the duty of the Supreme Court...

1226
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:25,440
not only to follow precedent...

1227
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:27,942
but to set it.

1228
01:24:28,693 --> 01:24:30,570
On the grounds submitted...

1229
01:24:31,237 --> 01:24:34,366
that the Children's Act 1941, Section 10...

1230
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:37,202
contravenes a parent's fundamental,
God-given right...

1231
01:24:37,285 --> 01:24:39,120
to the society of his children...

1232
01:24:39,162 --> 01:24:41,706
and is therefore repugnant
to the Constitution...

1233
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:45,585
l find in favor of the plaintiff,
Desmond Doyle.

1234
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:51,633
Marvelous! Children,
don't you stop praying now.

1235
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:57,222
...the Supreme Court. Now it all rests on the
shoulders of Justice Lynch, a Kerry man.

1236
01:24:57,305 --> 01:25:00,975
The tension in here is almost unbearable.

1237
01:25:01,017 --> 01:25:06,272
I can't think of anything like it, since
Tom Connolly's last-second penalty goal...

1238
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:09,484
that won Ireland the Triple Crown,
30 years ago.

1239
01:25:09,526 --> 01:25:11,069
And amazingly...

1240
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:15,031
Connolly is now part
of Desmond Doyle's team.

1241
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:18,535
l have been impressed
by Desmond Doyle's diligence...

1242
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:23,623
and determination in rebuilding
his financial and domestic circumstances...

1243
01:25:24,082 --> 01:25:26,793
in the wake of
his wife's unfortunate desertion.

1244
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:29,921
l have noted, too,
the obvious bonds of love and affection...

1245
01:25:30,005 --> 01:25:32,716
between Doyle and his daughter, Evelyn...

1246
01:25:33,216 --> 01:25:36,261
who made a deep impression on me,
and l'm sure, on all of us...

1247
01:25:36,344 --> 01:25:39,973
-in the witness stand.
-Please, no. Don't give us a ''however.''

1248
01:25:40,056 --> 01:25:43,727
However, we are officers of the law...

1249
01:25:44,227 --> 01:25:46,855
and must not be guided by sentiment.

1250
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:51,693
Though Mr. Barron
made a moving and powerful plea...

1251
01:25:51,776 --> 01:25:53,319
on behalf of his client...

1252
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:55,613
a stirring appeal to the heart...

1253
01:25:56,948 --> 01:26:01,911
we, as law officers, must determine cases
with the head, not the heart.

1254
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:03,955
Tom, have we lost?

1255
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:06,583
l agree with my learned friend,
Justice Ferris...

1256
01:26:06,624 --> 01:26:09,961
-Yes, unless he says another ''however.''
-...that it is regrettable...

1257
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:15,425
that no precedent has been cited
in support of Mr. Doyle's case.

1258
01:26:18,845 --> 01:26:20,263
However...

1259
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:24,392
though no precedent can be found
in lrish law...

1260
01:26:24,934 --> 01:26:28,897
we can argue
from an analogous English case.

1261
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:32,650
ln the Crown versus Clark, 1891 ...

1262
01:26:32,734 --> 01:26:37,072
the principle of a parent's inalienable right
to his or her children...

1263
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,908
was enshrined in common law.

1264
01:26:42,118 --> 01:26:43,119
However...

1265
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:46,498
...the parent's right...

1266
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:51,086
could, as common law,
be overridden by statute.

1267
01:26:54,547 --> 01:26:57,300
-However...
-Yes, dear God.

1268
01:26:57,342 --> 01:26:58,843
...unlike the English...

1269
01:26:59,302 --> 01:27:02,305
we lrish have a written Constitution...

1270
01:27:03,014 --> 01:27:06,476
so that, in the words
of Evelyn Doyle's prayer:

1271
01:27:06,935 --> 01:27:09,729
''truth and justice may flourish.''

1272
01:27:10,313 --> 01:27:14,275
l find it unarguably true,
as Mr. Barron contends...

1273
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:18,822
a parent has
an inalienable and God-given right...

1274
01:27:18,905 --> 01:27:21,032
to the society of his children.

1275
01:27:21,324 --> 01:27:24,369
l therefore find
in favor of the plaintiff, Mr. Doyle.

1276
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:44,139
We did it!

1277
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:54,232
Desmond Doyle has won!

1278
01:27:56,276 --> 01:27:57,444
Glory be to God!

1279
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:05,535
-Praise be to God!
-Sister, we've won.

1280
01:28:07,495 --> 01:28:10,415
Darling child, don't you forget me.

1281
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,917
l won't, Sister. l love you.

1282
01:28:21,092 --> 01:28:23,928
You'll be needing
a housekeeper now, won't you?

1283
01:28:52,123 --> 01:28:55,085
Love and glory, boys!

1284
01:28:56,252 --> 01:28:59,297
Legal history has been made.

1285
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:16,272
Evelyn's won. We can all go home soon!

1286
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:35,667
Daddy!

1287
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:41,089
Oh, my love. Good to see you.

1288
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:55,937
Let me see you.

1289
01:30:01,443 --> 01:30:03,319
You look gorgeous.

1290
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:31,348
Don't worry, Heidi. l didn't forget you.

1291
01:30:38,646 --> 01:30:41,566
Let's connect these two together now.

1292
01:30:51,242 --> 01:30:52,869
Some tea, too?

1293
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:10,178
Children, come and sit down, turkey's ready.

1294
01:31:10,261 --> 01:31:13,807
Evelyn, Maurice, Dermot,
come and sit down, everybody.

1295
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:17,018
-l am starving.
-Okay, crackers. Get a cracker, lads.
