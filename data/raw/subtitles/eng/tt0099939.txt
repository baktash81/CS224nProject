1
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,314
Read this, puta.

2
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,588
Thanks.

3
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,996
Want a date, honey?

4
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,457
Money, money, money.
Check this out.

5
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,969
You want to stop?

6
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,764
No.

7
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,277
Tubes, my boy, what's up?

8
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,570
What?

9
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,613
What's taking so long?

10
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,615
It's gonna take a few minutes.

11
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,617
We ain't got a few minutes.
We got to get busy.

12
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,870
Why don't you do what you
got to do so we can get busy?

13
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,455
Do me a favor. Here.

14
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,081
Calm down. Relax.

15
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,374
I'm gonna show you
how to do this.

16
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,960
I'm gonna show you how
to test this. Like that.

17
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,341
Right. It's dope.

18
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,259
It's dope, Tito.

19
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,476
You ever get the feeling
you was being watched?

20
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,519
Damn.

21
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,607
You got any soda, man...

22
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,609
Iike some root beer
or something?

23
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,069
I hurt my leg playing ball.

24
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,570
I got these aspirins
I want to take.

25
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,783
Now, what the fuck is he--

26
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,618
Tell him to turn this shit off.

27
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,079
What kind of help you got?
Watching cartoons?

28
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,581
Tell my man to turn the tv
off and get me a soda.

29
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,214
And make sure it's cold.

30
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,550
I like my shit cold,
especially when I play ball.

31
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,677
You play ball, Tito?

32
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,263
You don't look
like you play no ball.

33
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,973
But nice gloves.
I like those.

34
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,517
Hey, Jump.

35
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,518
What's up?

36
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,644
It's copacetic.

37
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,145
Now maybe you satisfied.

38
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,398
No. Maybe now I want
to check out another one.

39
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,108
What the fuck I look like,
Joe Neckbone?

40
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,818
Trust ain't one
of my stronger qualities.

41
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,860
You know what I'm saying?

42
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:11,986
You fucking disrespect me.

43
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,113
I guarantee the shit.

44
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,114
To hell with testing.

45
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,825
Let's get to the large
plus ten percent.

46
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,330
Did he say ten percent?
Wait a minute, Tito.

47
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,332
We had a deal. What's up?

48
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,501
What ten percent
you talking about?

49
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,503
Transportation costs, amigo.

50
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,171
I got expenses.

51
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,297
Well, take the train...

52
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,674
if you got expenses
in transportation.

53
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,676
Why you want to be greedy?

54
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,052
You fuck the sucking greed.
That's our price.

55
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,930
No one else even talks to you
goddamn motherfucking conos.

56
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,348
Now take it or leave it.

57
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,726
Why you want to talk
to me like that?

58
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,727
Take it or leave it?

59
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,396
Take it or leave it?

60
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,316
I take it.

61
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,571
'Cause I like you,
I'm gonna take it.

62
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,531
Pack the shit up.

63
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,828
You in power, Tito.

64
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,042
You the king.

65
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:25,852
Where's my soda?

66
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,952
What the fuck is this?

67
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,580
They're for
the bullet holes, puta.

68
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,006
Room service, motherfuckers!

69
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,822
There's somebody
here to see you.

70
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,104
What's in the cup?

71
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,942
Root beer.

72
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,827
You want some?

73
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,791
There's some things I don't do.

74
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,073
Welcome back home, Frank.

75
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,326
Check him out.

76
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,037
Congratulations, Frank.

77
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,080
Check him out.

78
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,081
Congratulations, man.

79
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,832
Them Colombian motherfuckers...

80
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,834
they took permanent vacation
in hell...

81
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,960
if you know what I mean.

82
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,506
Wow. I must have been
away too long...

83
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,591
because my feelings are dead.

84
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,844
I feel no remorse.

85
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,763
It's a terrible thing.

86
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,142
I heard being in jail makes
you feel like that.

87
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,602
I got a present for you.

88
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,603
Check it out.

89
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,854
They were King Tito's...

90
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,316
but he don't need them
where he is now.

91
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,903
I thought maybe you would
donate them...

92
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,863
to a clothing drive
or something.

93
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,037
Having a good time,
huh, Jump?

94
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,957
I been waiting years for this.

95
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:44,212
Emilio Zapa sends his regards.

96
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,675
You know how I love money.

97
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,678
Well, help yourself.

98
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,059
Is the meeting set with Dalesio?

99
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,310
Downtown.

100
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,478
You need to let me
bust a cap...

101
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,564
in that moonheaded
motherfucker's ass.

102
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,606
Word!

103
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,941
He's a fucking glitter boy.

104
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,693
He's looking
to get sprayed, laid...

105
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,237
played, and slayed.
Know what I'm saying?

106
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,822
I heard that.

107
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,788
You gonna come down, say hello?

108
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,374
You hobnob with them homos,
you want to.

109
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,002
I'm going downtown,
find me a girl...

110
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,253
get my knob polished.

111
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,714
Time for a real party.

112
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,593
Jim.

113
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,267
How come you never
came to see me?

114
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,398
Who wanted to see you in a cage?

115
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,486
Of course.

116
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:56,993
Later.

117
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,622
Champagne. Let's break out.

118
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,388
It's King Tito's.

119
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,972
King Tito's gloves.

120
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,646
It's a good thing he's dead
'cause I'd take that glove...

121
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,815
I'd wrap it right round his...

122
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,884
Sex.

123
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,178
And it's how much?

124
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,597
Wait for the paperback,
and you can get it.

125
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,725
It's too fucking much for me.

126
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,101
You should read that book, Joey.

127
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,185
Why?

128
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,229
Because I think you
might learn something.

129
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,731
What?

130
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,524
How to be good?

131
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,943
Joey, just don't say a word, OK?

132
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:12,986
Why not?

133
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,654
Because I don't want
you to say anything.

134
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:15,989
But we're going home, right?

135
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,866
I know. I'm tired already.
Where is he?

136
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,254
Welcome home, Frank.

137
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,651
Good to see you.

138
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,694
Nice to see you.

139
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,661
Thanks for everything.

140
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:05,914
To freedom.

141
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:07,916
Come on.

142
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,590
Bill, nice to see you.

143
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,550
Bill, Charlie, you know Frank.

144
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,718
How are you?

145
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:19,719
Good of you to come.

146
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,054
Judge, how are you?
Nice to see you.

147
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,098
Listen, I want to
introduce you to--

148
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,516
I'm gonna say hello
to your junior partner.

149
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,062
Hiya, Frank.
Good to see you.

150
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,073
You should
be more careful...

151
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,283
of the affairs
you attend, counselor.

152
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:45,120
One is known by
the company one keeps.

153
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,287
Ain't that right, Joey?

154
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,789
Pete, how are you?

155
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,416
Hey, Frank. Welcome home.

156
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,084
Hello, Frank.

157
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,173
Welcome back.

158
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,010
You know everybody here,
I think.

159
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,974
Pete, how's the family--
Brian, Dennis?

160
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,475
Better than when
you left town, Frank.

161
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,643
They're all working.

162
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:09,936
How about you?

163
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,604
Back from the dead.

164
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,276
Frank White. I've heard
a lot about you...

165
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,820
and it's all bad.

166
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,948
Don't believe everything that
Pete writes in the columns...

167
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,658
because...well...

168
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,455
I've been reformed.

169
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,540
A lot of people
will be happy to hear that.

170
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,542
Huh, Pete?

171
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,211
What can we expect from
the reformed Frank White?

172
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,175
I want to be mayor.

173
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,851
Thinks I'm kidding.

174
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,148
But first, I want
to talk to Arty Clay.

175
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,691
Why don't you relax?

176
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,194
We're supposed to be having
a good time here.

177
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,904
Tell him I got things
on my mind.

178
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,322
I want to
talk them over with him.

179
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,323
The guy's a fucking animal.

180
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,532
He ain't gonna meet with you.

181
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,576
Maybe you can do one
of his lieutenants at best.

182
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:08,703
Tell him...

183
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,874
Frank White wants to talk
business with him.

184
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,585
Just tell him
that all I want to know...

185
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,878
is where and when.

186
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,716
You know, counselor,
they did a wonderful job...

187
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:22,717
with this gentleman.

188
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,302
He's better than ever.

189
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,097
If you'll excuse me...

190
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,683
I'll see you people
in a little while...

191
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,351
if I'm still around.

192
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,234
Look at you.

193
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,323
Look at you.

194
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,494
What's the matter?
You're not glad to see me?

195
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,121
You belonged
where they put you.

196
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,250
Maybe this time you'll
stay out of trouble.

197
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,003
That depends on how
good my lawyers are.

198
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,587
I thought people like you...

199
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,506
didn't believe
in the legal process.

200
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:06,761
I thought people like me
were the legal process.

201
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,104
You know what?

202
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:23,194
You know what
I'd like to do to you?

203
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,867
I would like to take
you on the subway.

204
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:47,802
What can I do for you?

205
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,513
Tell Arty
I need to speak to him.

206
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,391
Wait here.

207
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,309
Sure.

208
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,366
There's some yarm out there
that wants to talk to you.

209
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,419
Ace is still the better.

210
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,463
Arty, you're still--

211
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,631
What's happening here?

212
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,175
You got aces?

213
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:29,719
Two hundred.

214
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,598
Two hundred?
I got to see your two.

215
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,600
All right. One shot.

216
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:36,851
Last ticket.

217
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:38,103
Johnny, give me
something good here.

218
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,270
Take it easy.

219
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,564
Arty. Gentlemen.

220
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,783
-Who goes?
-Arty.

221
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,578
I bet two hundred.

222
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,579
Go ahead.

223
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:59,040
I got a message
from Frank White.

224
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,542
He wants to sit down.
He wants to talk.

225
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,297
You tell him I don't
talk to nigger lovers.

226
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,800
Let's go. What's down?

227
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,844
He says he's got things
on his mind...

228
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,095
that he wants to discuss
with you...

229
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,722
and he wants to know where
and he wants to know when.

230
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,726
You tell him in fucking hell,
that's where.

231
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:18,935
He's gonna wish his lawyer...

232
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,562
Ieft him fucking
the Sambos in the joint...

233
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,605
when I get through with him.

234
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,524
I was making money
off them Colombians.

235
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,984
That's right.

236
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,404
If that's what you want me
to tell him, I'll tell him.

237
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:32,824
It ain't clear enough?

238
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,161
You tell
that son of a bitch...

239
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,079
he made a big
mistake with me.

240
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,706
And you tell him
something else!

241
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:43,168
This is what
Arty Clay has to say.

242
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:47,589
You tell him personally
from me!

243
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,550
Stay outta here!

244
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,139
Come on, sit down.
Let's go.

245
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,932
Come on, you go.

246
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:28,588
I missed you.

247
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,342
Your watch and your wallet,
blood.

248
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:20,724
How about that?

249
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:40,160
Come by the Plaza Hotel.

250
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:41,995
I got work for you.

251
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,955
Ask for Frank White.

252
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,543
Come on.

253
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,307
It's up to me, right?

254
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,726
You guys are in trouble.
I bet two hundred.

255
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,605
Hurry up, will you?

256
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:11,107
I'm down a lot of money here.

257
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,567
Let's play cards.

258
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,119
I got your message, Arty.

259
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,999
You stupid son of a bitch.

260
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,709
You running games here?

261
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,252
I want to play.

262
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,880
Sure, Frank, play.
Bring your friends.

263
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,882
I want to play with Arty.

264
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,801
Come on.
Let's go, will you?

265
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,386
Jump deals.

266
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,682
Blackjack. House out.

267
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,521
You got some balls coming here.

268
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:59,948
Pick up the card.

269
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,617
Come on.
Pick up the card.

270
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,035
Pick it up.

271
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:19,300
From here on, nothing goes down
unless I'm involved--

272
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,386
no blackjack,
no dope deals, no nothing.

273
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,265
A nickel bag
gets sold in the park...

274
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,641
I want in.

275
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,272
You guys got fat while everybody
starved on the street.

276
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:34,816
It's my turn.

277
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:39,404
You think you're gonna
live long enough...

278
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,823
to spend that money,
you fucking hump?

279
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:56,921
If any of you...

280
00:29:58,673 --> 00:29:59,632
are tired of
getting ripped off...

281
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:01,051
by guys like that...

282
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:08,141
You come with me.

283
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,935
I'm at the Plaza Hotel.
You're welcome.

284
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,437
You're all welcome!

285
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,189
To join!

286
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,788
Man or ghost,
I'll kill you again.

287
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,486
Ed.

288
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,072
Aiesha, how you doing?

289
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:31,618
I'm very upset about
what happened today.

290
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:33,203
I told you, Frank,
I did the best I could...

291
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,496
and you know that.

292
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:35,663
Edward.

293
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,707
I told you I tried
to make it work, Frank.

294
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:39,167
Hello, counselor.
How are you?

295
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,377
Alisha, how are you?

296
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,670
Aiesha.

297
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:45,131
The city councilman
was just explaining to me...

298
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:47,258
why that hospital
in the South Bronx...

299
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,511
didn't survive
the fiscal cut this afternoon.

300
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:52,514
I'm telling him
about how disappointed I am.

301
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,224
I was explaining to Frank...

302
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,934
that there simply wasn't
money in the budget...

303
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,018
to fund that facility.

304
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,561
In a city
of twelve million people...

305
00:32:58,645 --> 00:32:59,646
I find that hard to believe.

306
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,606
I hoped we could do better.

307
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,316
I hoped so, too, Frank...

308
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,027
but there simply was
no money in the budget.

309
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,362
If you think it's so easy...

310
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,072
why don't you try
funding it yourself?

311
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:11,533
Maybe I will.

312
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,745
How about sixteen million
by the end of the quarter?

313
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:20,208
Tell your friends
they'll have the money.

314
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,588
Counselor, you're
this man's legal advisor.

315
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:28,049
Why don't you explain to him
the hard financial facts...

316
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,759
of running a municipality.

317
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,553
I know what this city needs...

318
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,096
and privileged districts...

319
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:36,391
shouldn't be the only ones
with hospitals.

320
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:38,101
Forget it, Frank.

321
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,520
I want that place kept open.

322
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:41,646
Forget it.

323
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,939
The city can't afford it
and neither can you.

324
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,316
The city doesn't know
where to look for the money.

325
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,068
Let me give you some
very expensive advice--

326
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,279
go someplace where
you can stay out of trouble.

327
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:54,034
I thought
that's what I pay you for.

328
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,384
Hello, Frank.
I want to talk to you.

329
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:12,927
I don't think so.

330
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:16,097
Come on. O'Neill can wait
for two old friends, can't he?

331
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,974
I'm not your friend.

332
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,018
Come on, Frank. We missed you
while you were away.

333
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,644
Thought about you, too.

334
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,146
I heard a rumor about you.

335
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:24,356
What's that?

336
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,523
I heard you got AlDS...

337
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:26,816
getting dicked
up your ass in prison.

338
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,984
That's what I heard.

339
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,820
I thought about you every time
I jerked off, dickhead.

340
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:32,155
Why don't we
just take this outside.

341
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,200
Next time, wear a tie.

342
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:36,451
Get Abe.

343
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:37,869
Here we go.

344
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,291
Excuse us, folks.

345
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,793
Excuse us. Easy, easy.

346
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:54,052
What the hell is this?

347
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,470
We're taking him in
for questioning.

348
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,514
On what grounds?
This is harassment, Bishop.

349
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:58,932
You're welcome to come along.

350
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,643
Even your client's
got a right to counsel.

351
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:44,561
Come on. Get out!

352
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:48,023
Look inside.

353
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:51,484
Let's go.

354
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,364
What's that?

355
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:57,866
You tell me.

356
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,200
I don't know.

357
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:00,452
This is the only chance
you get, White.

358
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:01,494
What's it gonna be?

359
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:02,537
Are you arresting me?

360
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:03,538
Oh, fuck. Here we go.

361
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,539
If so, do it.

362
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:06,541
If not, I got people
waiting for me.

363
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,418
Shut the fuck up, motherfucker!

364
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,048
Hey, Frank.

365
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,299
All right, that's it.

366
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:15,800
Come here, Frank.

367
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,260
Here, Frank, meet somebody.

368
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,553
Meet somebody, huh?

369
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,096
Piece of shit!

370
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,598
That's it!

371
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:23,641
I'll kill the motherfucker!

372
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,935
No, I'm gonna cap him.
Let me cap the mo--

373
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,063
Get in the fucking car!

374
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,901
This how you do things?

375
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,403
I know what you're up to, White.
Forget it.

376
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,155
I'm gonna make you and
your friends disappear...

377
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,115
Iong before that.

378
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:43,912
Welcome home, fuck face.

379
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:46,456
Gilley, get in the fucking car.

380
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,458
Last fucking time, you fuck.

381
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,127
We're onto your fucking ass.

382
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,088
Give your friends that message.

383
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:39,592
Ladies and gentlemen...

384
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:40,969
can I have
your attention, please?

385
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:42,929
The best man
has something to say.

386
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,975
First of all, I'd like
to thank Tommy Flanigan...

387
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:49,894
for being the only black male
at an lrish wedding.

388
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,979
Are you comfortable, Tom?

389
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:51,980
I'm from the South.

390
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:53,023
Are you comfortable?

391
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:54,232
Real comfortable.

392
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,692
All my buddies here,
all my brothers.

393
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:56,860
He's sweating.

394
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,363
Joe Mulligan,
father of the bride.

395
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:01,865
Come on up here, Joe.

396
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:04,659
Joe provided these
lovely decorations for us.

397
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:05,994
Where'd you get these, Joe,
an A.A. meeting?

398
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:08,913
Not only that, he paid
for the whole thing.

399
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,832
The whole two hundred dollars.

400
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:13,376
Joe, by the way,
put your shotgun away.

401
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,544
The test came back negative.

402
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:21,551
Roy Bishop, do I detect
a little Afro Sheen...

403
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:23,845
on that unusually
wavy hair of yours?

404
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:28,933
Tip...Kathy...
to the finest couple...

405
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,018
I've ever had
the pleasure to know.

406
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:31,394
Join me, folks.

407
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,854
They're the only couple...

408
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,064
that's still together
in this neighborhood.

409
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,525
I wish you health, wealth...

410
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,612
happiness,
a lot of babies, no cops.

411
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,864
We don't need no more
degenerate donkeys...

412
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:44,491
running around with guns.

413
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:45,992
All bullshit aside...

414
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,036
and may I speak
for everybody...

415
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,704
we love you.
God bless.

416
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,206
Hear, hear.

417
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:52,749
Here's to youse.

418
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:53,833
How did I do?

419
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,251
I'm proud of you.

420
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,754
Hey, Father,
thank you for coming.

421
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:00,090
Let's get Father laid.

422
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,638
Give me a real drink.

423
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:08,640
Get Dennis
a drink over here.

424
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,058
Get the house a drink.

425
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:13,561
The bar's not open now.
You pay.

426
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,662
That's my wife!

427
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:34,624
It was a fucking joke!

428
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,418
Would you relax?
Virginia, come here.

429
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,628
Come here. Excuse me.

430
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:40,130
Tip, take a tip.

431
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:41,631
Gilley's after your wife.

432
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,633
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?

433
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,135
Hell, it's more than obvious.

434
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:48,972
He'll find the vampire marks
sunk into her neck.

435
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:51,307
Get outta here!

436
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,271
What's what, my friend?

437
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:57,772
How you doing?

438
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,274
What's what? Terrific.

439
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:01,276
Yeah? How come
you're not dancing?

440
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,237
I'm gonna leave that
to the father of the bride.

441
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,780
Are you sure you're gonna
make it through the night?

442
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:07,490
Aw, shit. You kidding?

443
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,075
I'm the one that
needs the honeymoon.

444
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,536
All they do is stay in bed
all fucking night.

445
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:14,706
Do me a favor.

446
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,374
Give this to the kids.

447
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:17,542
I got a million things to do.

448
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,710
Wish them my love.

449
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:20,211
You sure you won't come in?

450
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:21,671
Nah. I got
a million things to do.

451
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:22,672
I'll see you during the week.

452
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:24,507
You take it easy.

453
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:25,967
Take care, Pops.

454
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:34,411
You can tell your boyfriend
to forget about it.

455
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:36,913
He ain't got enough money.

456
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,415
Maybe he'll surprise you.

457
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,834
I don't like
his fucking surprises.

458
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:44,129
He's got a lot of nerve
even sending you here.

459
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:54,764
You could step
all over that shit...

460
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:57,225
and still get
a hundred twenty a gram.

461
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:59,561
And I got
two hundred twenty pounds of it.

462
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:03,940
Comes to fifteen mil,
street value.

463
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:07,902
And I want guarantees
nobody in this town can give.

464
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,531
Especially him.

465
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:16,327
Look, Larry, why don't you
set the terms?

466
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:18,955
I'll go back, and I'll tell
Frank.

467
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,042
If you two see eye to eye,
we'll make a deal.

468
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:25,253
If not, everybody goes
their own way still friends.

469
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:26,713
What do you say?

470
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:28,798
That cocksucker
ain't got no friends.

471
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:30,633
And before I even think...

472
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:33,178
of sitting across
some table with him...

473
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,221
he got to know one thing--

474
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,932
I ain't no fucking greaseball
named Arty Clay.

475
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,478
You got it.

476
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:46,358
And he pays for your cut.

477
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,946
Why don't you stick around?

478
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,657
I got "Frankenstein"
coming on next.

479
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:01,456
Stop fucking with my lady.
You know what I'm saying?

480
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:04,084
I told him, stop fucking
with my bitch.

481
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,960
And when he started
crying like a bitch...

482
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:08,213
he got fucked like a bitch.

483
00:43:08,296 --> 00:43:09,297
You know what I'm saying?

484
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:13,468
We're gonna shoot the bitch!

485
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,844
We'll just shoot the bitch!

486
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:16,846
Hey, Joe. What you want?

487
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,139
Don't forget the hot sauce.

488
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:19,391
You want white meat, right?

489
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:20,934
-No dark meat!
-No problem.

490
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:23,561
Don't shoot me!

491
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:35,031
Can I help you?

492
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:36,991
Can you help me?
Yeah, you can start...

493
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:39,452
by giving me fifteen pieces
of chicken, motherfucker.

494
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:41,454
Mix it up. I want barbecue,
and I want crispy.

495
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:42,372
You getting this all down?

496
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:46,042
I want six pieces of corn...

497
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:49,713
and I want, uh...yeah,
give me eight spareribs...

498
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:52,465
and give me
twelve pieces of shrimp.

499
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,554
Some onion rings.

500
00:43:57,637 --> 00:43:59,431
You want tartar sauce
or ketchup on those?

501
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,016
I want tartar sauce.

502
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,892
You got any potato salad?

503
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,227
No, we ain't got potato sal--

504
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,520
Get away from the games!
All right?

505
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:06,855
You ain't got no money.
Just get away from the games.

506
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:09,774
What the fuck
is the matter with you...

507
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:10,900
talking to them like that?

508
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:11,985
They ain't got no money.
Is that it?

509
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:12,986
Yeah, that's it.

510
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:15,363
Make sure you get my food,
get it now...

511
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,866
and don't be drooling on it.

512
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,409
And I better not get
none of that cat.

513
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:20,535
I want chicken.

514
00:44:23,788 --> 00:44:25,206
Here you are.

515
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:27,250
Y'all go play the games.

516
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,501
No offense, ma'am...

517
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:31,755
but you make sure
they get what they want.

518
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:36,176
Go ahead.

519
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:37,886
Y'all go play them games. Hear?

520
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:43,391
What's happening
with the food?

521
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,602
What's up? I ain't got
all day, you know.

522
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,562
That'll be 56.70, total.

523
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:50,273
Did I say I was finished?
I want something to drink.

524
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:52,067
Maybe I want some birch beer.
You got birch beer?

525
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,068
No, we don't have
no birch beer.

526
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:54,110
You don't even know
what that shit is.

527
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,487
You got any root beer?

528
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,613
We ain't got no root beer,
either.

529
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:58,365
-How much is this?
-56.90

530
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:00,784
56.90? Fuck you very much.

531
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:02,243
Hey, scumbag, guess what?

532
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:03,787
You're under fucking arrest.

533
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,247
Yeah, motherfucker?
How about that?

534
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:09,000
Police!

535
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:13,838
It's all over, Jimmy.

536
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:15,757
You're under arrest
for the murder of Miguel Mata...

537
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,385
Salvador Tito,
and Rafael Santodomingo.

538
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,095
You have the right
to remain silent.

539
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,554
Shut the fuck up.

540
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:23,640
What's this?
Did you use this on Mata?

541
00:45:23,723 --> 00:45:26,059
Yeah, same one
I'm gonna use on you, punk.

542
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:28,395
Laugh now, motherfucker,
but for the rest of your life...

543
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:29,604
you gonna be somebody's bitch.

544
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:30,939
Some motherfucker named Bubba.

545
00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:32,023
But you're
a motherfucking bro!

546
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:33,566
Don't you slap me,
motherfucker.

547
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:34,734
I'm gonna slap
the black off you.

548
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,152
Take the cuffs off,
you motherfucker!

549
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:37,404
I'm gonna finish
his ass off!

550
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,781
This is the happiest day
of my life. You know why?

551
00:45:39,864 --> 00:45:41,491
'Cause we got a real,
live, talking witness.

552
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:42,951
I don't leave no witnesses!

553
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,828
Oh, yeah, motherfucker?
Well, you must be getting old.

554
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:48,039
I'll teach you
to fuck with my friend.

555
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:50,000
I'm gonna fuck you up!

556
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:13,148
Without private assistance...

557
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,316
everything we've seen
will close down.

558
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:19,154
I can't stress enough how much
your help could mean...

559
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:20,864
to the thousands of families...

560
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:22,615
that depend on us
for medical care.

561
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:24,993
Please, just look around.

562
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:36,338
Look, Larry...

563
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:41,343
the most anybody's
gonna give you for your stuff...

564
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:42,677
is thirty grand a key.

565
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:44,971
That's about
three million dollars...

566
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:46,097
on a bulk sale.

567
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,099
So whoever buys it's
gonna turn around...

568
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:49,726
cut it, bag it,
and sell it on the street...

569
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:51,811
for a hundred twenty,
a hundred fifty a gram.

570
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:54,564
That's a hundred fifty thousand
dollars a key...

571
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:56,524
five times what they paid you.

572
00:46:56,608 --> 00:47:00,111
So now your quintal's worth
fifteen million dollars...

573
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:03,573
a markup of
eleven million something...

574
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:04,741
that you get no part of.

575
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:06,785
I know you don't
have the manpower...

576
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:09,704
to peddle
the uptown streets, but I do.

577
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:13,708
You put up the stuff,
I put up the guys to sell it.

578
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:15,710
I take the heat
and the risk...

579
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,296
if there is any.

580
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,631
We divide the difference...

581
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:22,300
setting aside something
for places like this.

582
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:23,718
What do you say?

583
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:29,849
If I was into
socialized medicine...

584
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:31,935
I would have stayed
in the Peking province.

585
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:35,230
I want cash for my goods.

586
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:37,774
How much?

587
00:47:37,857 --> 00:47:39,776
Three million up front...

588
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:41,277
Iike you said...

589
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:44,781
with another half a mil
when you unload it.

590
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:46,783
That's a lot of money.

591
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:48,034
I got a lot of shit.

592
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:51,287
Make up your mind.

593
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,418
You know something, Frank?

594
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:59,629
This conversation
made me realize...

595
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:01,756
just how fucking crazy
you really are.

596
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:52,766
It's all set up.

597
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:54,309
I don't think you should
go down there alone.

598
00:48:54,392 --> 00:48:56,561
I don't trust
that crazy Chinese guy.

599
00:48:56,644 --> 00:48:57,729
Know what I mean?

600
00:48:57,812 --> 00:48:58,897
It's Enrico Mata.

601
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:00,357
They got him recovering
in a hospital somewhere...

602
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,359
with a police guard
around him 24 hours.

603
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:05,320
He's agreed to testify
for them in court.

604
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:07,322
They got Jump cold
this time, Frank.

605
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:08,573
It's Murder-One.

606
00:49:08,656 --> 00:49:10,325
Did Abe get them set bail?

607
00:49:10,408 --> 00:49:11,785
A million dollars apiece.

608
00:49:11,868 --> 00:49:13,828
So go sign him out.

609
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,330
Posting that kind
of money's gonna raise...

610
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:16,831
more problems
than it solves, Frank.

611
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:18,333
Also, I want you to get Abe...

612
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,834
to talk to some of
those friends of his...

613
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:21,419
see if they can't get
this cop transferred...

614
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:22,837
or retired or something.

615
00:49:22,879 --> 00:49:25,340
I want him out of my way.

616
00:49:25,423 --> 00:49:26,758
He's chief
investigating officer...

617
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:27,801
on a multiple homicide.

618
00:49:27,884 --> 00:49:29,260
It's stupid
to even think about it.

619
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:30,220
Ask him...

620
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:37,310
before I blow Bishop's brains
all over his fucking wing tips.

621
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:42,482
Get some guys and pick him up.

622
00:49:42,565 --> 00:49:44,109
You got it, Frank.

623
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:55,412
Hope you had a good time.

624
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,709
My old man's back.

625
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:01,751
That's right.

626
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:08,008
Captain Crunch
and that doughnut crew is here.

627
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,385
Yo, fellas, what's up?
Long time no see.

628
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:11,636
Bishop, we having
a party downtown.

629
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,680
Why don't you bring Howdy Doody
and the Chocolate Wonder?

630
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:14,889
I hear your mother's
gonna be there.

631
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,641
We having a real
good time down there.

632
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:17,559
You know what I'm sayin'--

633
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:35,201
Give me some.

634
00:50:37,787 --> 00:50:39,664
Black man.

635
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,336
Some flowers for your witness.

636
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:48,548
Jimmy, we got business to do.

637
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:50,759
We got business to do.

638
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:52,594
Get some cheap ones.

639
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:54,220
And you can kiss my ass, too.

640
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:56,598
I'll see you downtown.

641
00:50:56,681 --> 00:50:57,557
You'll be all right?

642
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:02,604
What?

643
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:07,525
Proud of yourself, counselor?

644
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:12,155
If you got a problem,
take it to the judge.
