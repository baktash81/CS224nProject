1
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:25,286
<i>Just south of the arctic circle,</i>

2
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:28,086
<i>out on the edge of the world</i>

3
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,419
<i>is a forsaken
place of great beauty.</i>

4
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:42,285
<i>When outsiders
came to this place,</i>

5
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:45,619
<i>they found it a cruel
and unforgiving country.</i>

6
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:52,686
<i>They had come for the gold,
to find their fortune.</i>

7
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:59,619
<i>Many left with broken dreams.</i>

8
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,486
<i>But the few,</i>

9
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,753
<i>the ones with strong hearts
and iron wills,</i>

10
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:09,020
<i>learned the old ways.</i>

11
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:17,319
<i>Dog sledding was a way of life.</i>

12
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,686
<i>We relied on them,</i>

13
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:22,153
<i>and they relied on us.</i>

14
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:32,020
Hey, let's go, boy!
Ha!

15
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,152
Hold the line, Togo!

16
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:43,753
<i>1917 was the last year</i>

17
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:46,452
<i>for the Alaskan sweepstakes
race.</i>

18
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:50,386
<i>His third straight victory
in the all Alaskan sweepstakes.</i>

19
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:52,753
<i>No one is faster
than Leonhard Seppala.</i>

20
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,285
Go, boy! Whoo!

21
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,085
Nice job, Gunnar!

22
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:10,386
Good race, Gunnar.

23
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:11,552
Good win.

24
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:14,152
Great race, Gunnar.

25
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,386
You did it again.

26
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,219
Togo got speed.

27
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:38,619
<i>Seppala
came to Nome for the gold.</i>

28
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:50,152
<i>But it was the native spirit
he became one with.</i>

29
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:58,586
<i>The spring and summer
we would hunt and fish</i>

30
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,719
<i>in order to survive
the harsh winters.</i>

31
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:06,352
<i>We would live off the land.</i>

32
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:11,686
<i>The animals are
what we relied on.</i>

33
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:20,686
<i>My people believe that
every living thing has a spirit.</i>

34
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:27,452
<i>To take a life, you first
had to honor the spirit...</i>

35
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:34,119
<i>and thank them
for their sacrifice.</i>

36
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:53,252
<i>Seppala never found gold,</i>

37
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:58,319
<i>but he found a way of life
within my tribe</i>

38
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:01,719
<i>and became one of us.</i>

39
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:30,386
I'm pregnant.

40
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:34,320
What?

41
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:40,752
You're pregnant.

42
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,651
Ah.

43
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:01,185
So if it's a girl,
what do you want to name her?

44
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:06,519
Sigrid.

45
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:07,685
Sigrid.

46
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,752
And if it's a boy?

47
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:15,219
It's not a boy.

48
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:43,152
My feet dance because of you.

49
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,518
You're the sky.

50
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:48,319
Most beautiful.

51
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,651
<i>We believe Anguta is an animal,</i>

52
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:13,785
<i>part wolf, part bear.</i>

53
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:17,551
<i>A creature that takes souls
to their final resting place.</i>

54
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:28,418
Kiana!

55
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,252
Kiana!

56
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:34,418
Help!

57
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:40,351
What happened?
She's sick?

58
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:50,685
Sepp.

59
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,185
How is she?

60
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,785
She doesn't have long.

61
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:57,685
Oh, no.

62
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:10,085
Hey, my love, I'm here.

63
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:16,152
I'm sorry
I didn't get here faster.

64
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:17,718
Doing real good.

65
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,651
Can you open those eyes?

66
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:26,318
I know you can do this.

67
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,119
Just open those eyes.

68
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:36,551
There she is.

69
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:37,651
There she is.

70
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,085
Take care of her.

71
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:51,318
Don't go.

72
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,052
Don't go.

73
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:02,685
Don't go.

74
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,785
Don't go.

75
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:08,718
<i>The flu epidemic of 1918,</i>

76
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,051
<i>wiped out
nearly half of my people.</i>

77
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:16,385
<i>Seppala set out to kill Anguta,</i>

78
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:20,718
<i>the very spirit
that came for my people.</i>

79
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:42,685
Yah! Let's go!

80
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,785
Damn you, God.

81
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,218
Damn you, God!

82
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,318
<i>He killed that bear,</i>

83
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,585
<i>but he never found the wolf.</i>

84
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,151
<i>He would always believe
the wolf might return.</i>

85
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:22,585
Good boy.

86
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:26,084
Togo, let's go.

87
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:48,551
Number 12, last car, boys.

88
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:50,751
<i>Grab the crane.</i>

89
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:53,051
<i>The rope.</i>

90
00:11:56,786 --> 00:11:59,618
Everyone outside.

91
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,151
<i>Close the hatch.</i>

92
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:05,084
Let's go.

93
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:28,717
I think you all know

94
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:32,084
this vein we're on
is about tapped out.

95
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,584
She's just not
producing enough for us

96
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,784
to keep her open anymore.

97
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:40,485
I promise you, all of you,
I'll do my best

98
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:42,551
to find you work.

99
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,650
The Yukon Mine's
gonna be runnin' full steam

100
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:48,518
all winter long,
and the foreman over there

101
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,218
told me
he could take most of you on.

102
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,884
Yukon Mine.

103
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:57,549
That's a thousand miles away,
George.

104
00:12:57,552 --> 00:13:01,018
I know. It's
a long way from home, Gunnar.

105
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,550
But if you want to work,

106
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:06,631
it's all there is.

107
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,498
Uh, I'll go.

108
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:13,785
Yeah, me as well.

109
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:19,751
Charlie.
Keep the faith.

110
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,784
Thank you.

111
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:35,417
Good luck to you.

112
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,417
It's gonna be a long winter.

113
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:45,717
Got a little
Christmas bonus for you.

114
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:50,650
I'll see you in church.

115
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:52,284
Thanks, George.

116
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:53,564
Thank you, Sepp.

117
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:01,318
<i>What would you like Santa Claus</i>

118
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,051
<i>to bring you this year?</i>

119
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:06,384
Hmm, I would really love
a dress.

120
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:08,184
What kind of dress?

121
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:11,118
The one like Constance's dress.

122
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,318
We'll have to tell Santa Claus.

123
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,218
What was my mommy like?

124
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:21,084
<i>She was the kindest woman
I have ever known.</i>

125
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,151
She was strong.

126
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:26,650
Really, really strong.

127
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:30,350
Kind of like a certain
special somebody that I know.

128
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,417
She would be so proud of you.

129
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,118
Yeah, let's go.

130
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:15,217
Hah! Hah!

131
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:16,550
Good job, Sigrid.

132
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,450
Let's get over
to Constance's house

133
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,384
and your dad's going to come
pick you up, okay?

134
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,084
Okay.

135
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:23,650
Yeah!

136
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:26,517
And Sigrid Seppala
wins the race.

137
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,798
Let's go.

138
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:35,417
Togo! Togo!
I missed you, boy!

139
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:40,584
Hey, wh-where's my hug, Sig?

140
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,217
Just doing what
you taught me, Daddy.

141
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:44,550
Dogs come first.

142
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,317
Thanks for watching
Sigrid while I was gone.

143
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:47,417
You're welcome.

144
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,283
It's no trouble at all.

145
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:50,751
She's a beautiful child.

146
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:53,051
Yeah.

147
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:55,450
I would love it
if Sigrid could make

148
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:57,183
the Christmas Eve service.

149
00:15:57,185 --> 00:15:59,484
I have all the children
singing up front.

150
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,183
Please, Daddy, please?

151
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:04,283
Please
can we go to church? Please?

152
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:06,417
Uh, we'll see.

153
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,083
I had better
get back to the hospital.

154
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:13,317
The last shipment
of medical supplies

155
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,717
just came in for winter,
and Dr. Welch will need

156
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:18,050
some help sorting through
those crates.

157
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:19,150
Yeah.

158
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:20,317
Goodbye, Sigrid.

159
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:22,217
Bye Constance. Thank you.

160
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:23,517
<i>You're welcome, sweetheart.</i>

161
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,450
Bye, Leonhard.

162
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:30,517
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

163
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,798
Let's go, Sig.

164
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,317
<i>Okay, Daddy.</i>

165
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:38,450
Yeah.

166
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,684
Hee-hee-hee-hee.

167
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,150
Hey, come on. Load up.

168
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:55,150
That's the last of it.

169
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:56,717
Are you sure?

170
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,617
That's the whole shipment.

171
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:01,183
Well, we seem
to be short a few items.

172
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:02,517
But you go ahead.

173
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,417
I know you need to get
the kids ready

174
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:06,117
for the Christmas service,
I'll keep looking.

175
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,250
Thank you, Father.

176
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:09,950
- I'll see you there.
- Okay.

177
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,283
Merry Christmas, Father.

178
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:30,450
Merry Christmas.

179
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:39,484
Good evening.

180
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:41,364
All rise and join me in prayer.

181
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:46,550
Loving Father,
we are gathered here today

182
00:17:46,552 --> 00:17:49,550
to have fun and fellowship,
and to celebrate and remember

183
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:51,183
the birth of Jesus,

184
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:53,283
that we may share
in the songs of the angels,

185
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:55,150
the gladness of the shepherds,

186
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,550
and the worship of the wise men.

187
00:17:57,552 --> 00:17:59,317
Lord, may the Christmas
morning make us happy

188
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,550
to be your children,
and the Christmas evening

189
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:04,117
bring us to our beds
with grateful thoughts,

190
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,050
forgiving and forgiven.

191
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,384
In Jesus' name we pray.

192
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:08,117
Merry Christmas.

193
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,484
Merry Christmas, Leonhard.

194
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:11,017
Glad you came.

195
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,450
Thanks.

196
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:16,450
Daddy! Daddy!
Constance got me a present.

197
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:17,683
I see that.

198
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:20,549
Oh, isn't that kind of her?

199
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:23,250
Thank you
for bringing Sigrid tonight.

200
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:27,283
Oh, thank you,
for being so kind to Sigrid.

201
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:28,683
Merry Christmas.

202
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:30,083
Merry Christmas.

203
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,443
Let's go.
Let's go home.

204
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:33,783
Okay, Daddy.

205
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:37,250
After you.

206
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:42,183
Let's go, boy.

207
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:52,483
A dress!
She got me a dress!

208
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:55,649
I told her I would
love a dress for Christmas!

209
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:57,716
Well, isn't that nice?

210
00:19:57,718 --> 00:20:00,117
Here.
Eat your dinner.

211
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,783
You're not hungry, Daddy?

212
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:10,783
No.

213
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:13,350
Eat up.

214
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:14,683
Eat your dinner.

215
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,583
Do you miss Mama?

216
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:26,549
Yeah. Every day.

217
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:28,750
Well, Constance
would be a good mama.

218
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:31,183
Hey, we don't talk like that
in this house.

219
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:33,050
You understand me?

220
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:36,050
I don't want to ever hear you
speak like that again.

221
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:37,150
You got a mama.

222
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:42,349
Go. Go to bed.

223
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:46,083
Merry Christmas, boy.

224
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:47,923
Maybe you could cheer him up.

225
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:56,716
What?

226
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:01,750
She does.

227
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:21,249
It's to bring you
good luck for the race.

228
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:23,549
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

229
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:33,516
<i>Hoping everyone has a healthy</i>

230
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:35,549
<i>and happy holiday season.</i>

231
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:37,449
<i>Oh, and this just in.</i>

232
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:39,282
<i>We have a report
out of Newfoundland</i>

233
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:40,716
<i>that Santa's sleigh was seen</i>

234
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:43,449
<i>somewhere
over the United States.</i>

235
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:45,316
<i>It's time to get tucked in
boys and girls,</i>

236
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:47,282
<i>because Mr. Claus
is on his way.</i>

237
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:51,282
Daddy, I can't sleep.

238
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:53,316
Come here.

239
00:21:53,318 --> 00:21:54,416
<i>This is Harry Davenport</i>

240
00:21:54,418 --> 00:21:55,549
<i>signing off.</i>

241
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:56,516
<i>Merry Christmas, everyone.</i>

242
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,316
There you go.

243
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,483
Merry Christmas.

244
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:09,149
Merry Christmas.

245
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:21,509
Will you open your mouth
please, Alice?

246
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,049
A little wider please?

247
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,149
Dr. Welch is going
to make you all better baby.

248
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:27,449
You know what?
You are a very,

249
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:29,082
very good patient, Alice.

250
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:31,383
As a matter of fact,
Santa Claus told me

251
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:34,082
that you are at the very top
of his nice list.

252
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:36,482
So he told me to give you this.

253
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:40,316
What's wrong with her?

254
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:41,516
I'm going to go back
to the hospital

255
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:43,516
and pick up some medicine.

256
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:44,750
I'll be right back.

257
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:45,750
She'll be fine.

258
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:47,349
Thank you.

259
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:36,383
She's gone.

260
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:37,716
I'm so very sorry.

261
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:49,149
May I see her?

262
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:01,583
We're so sorry.

263
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:14,216
I will come back.
I will be back.

264
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:15,583
Come, come.

265
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:18,716
What killed that little girl?

266
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,116
She died of diphtheria.

267
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:21,216
Diphtheria?

268
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:22,449
Yes, it's a bacterial infection

269
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:25,016
that attacks
the respiratory system.

270
00:24:25,018 --> 00:24:26,782
And it shuts down the airways

271
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:28,548
and the patient ultimately
dies from suffocation.

272
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,416
Are you sure it's diphtheria?

273
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:32,583
Yes, I'm sure.

274
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:34,282
But don't we have the antitoxin?

275
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:37,182
Yes, we do.
But it's expired.

276
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,516
What are we going to do?

277
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,416
Well, I'm going
to bring all the children

278
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:42,416
showing symptoms
up to the hospital immediately

279
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:45,349
and we'll... I'll check
on all of Mary's classmates.

280
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:53,316
George, we have a problem.

281
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:56,082
An Inuit girl
died of diphtheria,

282
00:24:56,084 --> 00:24:58,516
and I assume that there are
many more infected

283
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:00,116
out in the sandspit.

284
00:25:00,118 --> 00:25:01,282
Diphtheria?

285
00:25:01,284 --> 00:25:03,049
Yes.
It's highly infectious

286
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:05,249
and I have no antitoxin
to fight it with.

287
00:25:05,251 --> 00:25:06,449
I ordered more,
but it didn't arrive

288
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:08,182
with the last shipment.

289
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:10,082
There isn't
another way to cure it?

290
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:11,483
No. And you and I know
what can happen

291
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:14,049
with the last flu epidemic.

292
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:15,549
This could be very, very bad.

293
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:18,349
It could be much worse
if we don't get it here quickly.

294
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:22,216
Curtis, you just tell me
what you want me to do.

295
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,049
We need help.

296
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:30,249
Are we able
to get a telegraph through?

297
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:31,250
Sure, George.

298
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,182
Governor?
- Hmm.

299
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:40,149
Sir, it's a telegram
from the Mayor of Nome,

300
00:25:40,151 --> 00:25:42,149
- very urgent.
- From who?

301
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:43,682
From Nome, Sir, very urgent.

302
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:45,282
The mayor in Nome.

303
00:25:45,284 --> 00:25:46,562
Read it to me.

304
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:50,249
"An outbreak of diphtheria
is almost inevitable here."

305
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:51,615
Stop.

306
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,249
"I am in urgent need
of diphtheria antitoxin."

307
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:56,082
Stop.

308
00:25:56,084 --> 00:26:00,149
God, Nome.
I almost forgot about Nome.

309
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:02,548
We haven't heard
from them in years.

310
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,229
What would you like to do, Sir?

311
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:09,383
Ah, call every hospital
down the coast

312
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:12,383
from Seattle to San Francisco
and tell them to send

313
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:15,182
as much antitoxin
as they can spare.

314
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:16,648
Okay, but... but Sir,

315
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,498
how are we supposed
to transport it there?

316
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:20,348
We can't get it there by ship.
The seaport's frozen over.

317
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:22,416
And... and Nenana's
the last stop on the railroad,

318
00:26:22,418 --> 00:26:23,615
that's at least 700 miles
from Nome?

319
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:26,182
Look, just get the antitoxin.

320
00:26:28,284 --> 00:26:29,383
Yes, Sir.

321
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,732
Thank you all for coming out.

322
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:37,015
Dr. Welch has some important
news that affects all of us.

323
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:38,217
Doctor?

324
00:26:40,784 --> 00:26:43,216
A young girl
has died of diphtheria.

325
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:46,515
It's a very dangerous
and contagious disease

326
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:50,216
and it's going to spread
very rapidly through town.

327
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:55,182
If any of your young ones
have a sore throat

328
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:58,448
or a high fever,
any cold symptoms at all,

329
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,316
please send them
to the hospital immediately.

330
00:27:02,317 --> 00:27:04,715
Is it just the young ones
or can the adults get it too?

331
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:06,415
Children are at the highest risk

332
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,149
because their immune systems
aren't as developed as ours.

333
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:12,216
But adults can carry
the disease without knowing it.

334
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:14,615
So I want you all
to stay in your homes.

335
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:15,548
What are we supposed to do?

336
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,782
How do we treat this?

337
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:18,682
Well, there...
There is an antitoxin

338
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:21,682
but I'm sorry, at the moment,
we... we don't have it.

339
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:27,315
Folks, folks,
please, please quiet down.

340
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:28,648
We... we we've contacted
the governor.

341
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,016
How do we have not any of it?

342
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:31,016
And he...
And he's going to send us

343
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:33,482
the antitoxin
as soon as possible.

344
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:36,315
I... I assure you we're doing
the best we can right now,

345
00:27:36,317 --> 00:27:38,615
so just please do
what the doctor says.

346
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:41,149
I think everybody
just has to stay calm.

347
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:42,365
Stay in their homes.

348
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:43,581
We're going to do
everything we can to...

349
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:45,049
To get this antitoxin here.

350
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:47,149
That's what
we're trying to figure out.

351
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,247
<i>So stay in your homes,
because it will not spread</i>

352
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,515
<i>if you stay in your homes.</i>

353
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:51,715
<i>That's what I ask of you.</i>

354
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:52,796
<i>We will get it here.</i>

355
00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:03,181
Well, we should have
enough antitoxin

356
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,448
by the end of the week.

357
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,215
The last thing
we need is bad press,

358
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:10,582
so I'm hoping
you will support our effort.

359
00:28:12,617 --> 00:28:13,682
Well, I was hoping

360
00:28:13,684 --> 00:28:15,148
you would finally
see the light of day

361
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,682
and realize
it was time for Alaska

362
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:18,248
to step into the modern age.

363
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:20,696
What do you mean by that?

364
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:23,582
I'm talking about an airplane.

365
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,082
We can have that serum
in Nome in two days.

366
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:28,482
Does this have anything to do
with the fact

367
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:31,782
that you are a part owner
of an airline by any chance?

368
00:28:31,784 --> 00:28:34,281
I don't see that
that is really relevant

369
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:35,382
to any matters at hand.

370
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:36,615
You have a problem.

371
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:38,515
I'm offering you a solution.

372
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,582
Subzero temperatures
and Arctic winds

373
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:44,615
are not very conducive
to your flying machines.

374
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:46,548
William, this is Alaska.

375
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,715
This is our chance, Governor.

376
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:50,215
Yeah.
Well you don't have a plane,

377
00:28:50,217 --> 00:28:52,348
and you don't have a pilot.

378
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,715
Now, to fly that distance
in winter conditions,

379
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:57,281
I already checked.

380
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,081
I know.

381
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,415
You called Washington
and they ignored you again.

382
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,181
No, they didn't ignore me.

383
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:05,281
Ignore me.

384
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,148
I can have a plane and a pilot
ready by tomorrow.

385
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,015
Listen, the plane goes down
with the serum on board,

386
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,648
we will be unable
to help anyone.

387
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,248
My plane will make it.

388
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,615
And I guarantee you will be
front page news on my paper.

389
00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:22,315
Aren't you tired of playing
second fiddle to the lower 48?

390
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:26,448
Oh, Jesus. What the hell does
that have to do with anything?

391
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,715
I'll make you a hero.

392
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:31,148
Hell this could even mean
a second term.

393
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,389
Put you on the map so to speak.

394
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:40,081
I'll take your silence as a yes.

395
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,348
I want a test flight first.

396
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,015
If you can prove to me
you can get a plane up there

397
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,048
and fly that distance,

398
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,048
I will consider
flying up the serum.

399
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,382
You're a wise man, Governor.

400
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:58,515
Got a wire
from the Governor's office.

401
00:29:58,517 --> 00:30:00,615
They found the antiserum
in Anchorage.

402
00:30:00,617 --> 00:30:03,215
They want to fly it in
by airplane.

403
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:05,482
We could possibly have it
in a couple of days.

404
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:12,115
Thank you.

405
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:14,682
<i>Going live in five,
four, three, two...</i>

406
00:30:14,684 --> 00:30:17,582
Hello, folks.
This is Harry Davenport.

407
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:19,482
<i>A sliver of hope
for icebound Nome</i>

408
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,382
<i>as a doctor in Anchorage
has discovered 300,000 units</i>

409
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:25,482
<i>of diphtheria antitoxin,</i>

410
00:30:25,484 --> 00:30:27,582
<i>enough to fight off
the epidemic.</i>

411
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,749
Governor Bone had hoped

412
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:31,115
the serum could be delivered
by airplane,

413
00:30:31,117 --> 00:30:33,148
but the test run earlier today
has proven

414
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,348
<i>it is not a reliable option.</i>

415
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,281
<i>Cut off by land, cut off by sea.</i>

416
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:42,248
And now the winged angel
of mercy is stuck on the runway.

417
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,582
<i>How will they get the medicine
they so desperately need?</i>

418
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:47,315
Nome needs our prayers.

419
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:51,382
<i>This is Henry Davenport
signing off.</i>

420
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,682
We don't have time to wait.

421
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:58,281
If we don't get it here soon,
things are going to be very bad.

422
00:30:58,283 --> 00:31:00,015
Well, how much time do we have?

423
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:02,215
In two weeks, hundreds
are going to be infected.

424
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:04,415
This town is going
to be savaged.

425
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:07,315
This disease
is fatal to children.

426
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:11,248
Daddy,
what's going to happen to us?

427
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,215
Well, then, let's go
get that medicine.

428
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:15,081
Nothing's going to happen to us.

429
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:24,448
Gentlemen, it is time for us
to stop talking and take action.

430
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,714
We need to go
get that serum ourselves.

431
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:28,515
How will you
get the medicine here?

432
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:30,281
The sea is frozen over.

433
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:32,215
A ship couldn't get
within a hundred miles.

434
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:33,348
We'll mush it in.

435
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,714
Dog sled?
You can't be serious.

436
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:37,081
Hi, get out of the cold.

437
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:40,215
My father and George are meeting

438
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:42,081
with the town council
at the saloon.

439
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,348
They're discussing the plans
to get the serum here.

440
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,348
George asked me urgently
to get you there.

441
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,348
I'm dead serious,
Mr. Wells.

442
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,781
I'd much rather
put our hopes in a man

443
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:54,781
and a-a good team of dogs
than some damn flying machine

444
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:57,281
that can't even
get off the ground.

445
00:31:57,283 --> 00:32:00,148
It's possible.
The railroad's still running.

446
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,547
We take the mail route

447
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:03,748
and-and the trains get it
as far as Nenana.

448
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,382
One musher can never
make it there and back.

449
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,148
It's 700 miles.

450
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,515
Not one musher.

451
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:10,281
A relay.

452
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:12,714
We station men
at every roadhouse

453
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:14,714
along the way
from here to Nenana.

454
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:16,448
George is right.

455
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,282
It may put lives at risk,

456
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:20,115
but at this point
it's the best option we have.

457
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:21,714
We know these men.

458
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:24,781
We know what they're capable of.

459
00:32:24,783 --> 00:32:26,514
Can you keep Sigrid?

460
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:27,514
Of course.

461
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:28,795
Okay, I'll be back.

462
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,382
Look, I have three children.

463
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,781
And I just don't know if
this is the best option for us.

464
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:37,215
What if we wait another week
and this weather passes?

465
00:32:37,217 --> 00:32:38,748
Yes.

466
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,631
Then we can get an airplane
up here in better weather.

467
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:42,513
You've got a
nine-month-old, Elliot.

468
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:43,781
Do you really want
to take that chance?

469
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:45,281
We are out of time.

470
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:46,647
What if they can't make it
through the mountains

471
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:48,181
by dog sled?

472
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:49,647
And the serum gets lost.
Then what?

473
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:51,115
We have to try.

474
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:54,181
Every day we wait,
children are going to die.

475
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:56,148
I'm not going to
let that happen.

476
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,348
I vote in favor.

477
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,222
Any more discussion?

478
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,781
Good.

479
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:04,248
Let's get started.

480
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,714
"Today officials
tried a second attempt

481
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:08,315
"at delivering the serum
by airplane.

482
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:09,748
"But the plane
had mechanical difficulties

483
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,181
"and had to return
to the landing strip

484
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:13,514
"shortly after takeoff.

485
00:33:13,516 --> 00:33:16,381
"Ice-bound and all alone
on the edge of the world

486
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:20,547
<i>It's now up to the valiant
mushers and the brave canines."</i>

487
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:23,681
We need someone to meet them
at the halfway point,

488
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:25,315
350 miles."

489
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,414
I'll do it.

490
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:32,614
Sepp, even you've said

491
00:33:32,616 --> 00:33:35,015
that the Norton Sound
and the mountain pass

492
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:37,781
never be taken
when the weather's not right.

493
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:40,281
How you're going to do this
in a storm?

494
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:43,048
I can't lose Sigrid.

495
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,481
The Norton Sound
has killed many men,

496
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,514
but we need that serum
and we need it now.

497
00:33:49,516 --> 00:33:51,381
They're expecting temperatures

498
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:53,247
to drop to below 40
tomorrow night

499
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:55,681
and there's a blizzard
dropping in from the north.

500
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:57,647
"As an Arctic blizzard
pushes west,

501
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:01,215
<i>"the drivers are enduring
temperatures of 60 below zero</i>

502
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:03,215
<i>and hurricane strength winds."</i>

503
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:05,115
Can the serum survive
those conditions?

504
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:06,581
It can't stay frozen
for too long

505
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,614
or the antitoxin
will be destroyed,

506
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:13,115
but if it were thawed
at each waypoint

507
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:17,015
and packed very carefully,
yes, I think it would.

508
00:34:22,549 --> 00:34:24,467
I'm going to need somebody
to stay with Sigrid.

509
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:31,681
I'll stay with her
till this is over.

510
00:34:34,249 --> 00:34:35,248
Thanks, George.

511
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:38,547
I'll have Togo ready.

512
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:43,247
Gunner, use my dogs
and prepare a second team.

513
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:45,614
In case the storm
takes a turn for the worse,

514
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,015
Balto's ready to lead a team.

515
00:34:48,017 --> 00:34:50,414
I'll be ready.

516
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:54,180
Well, who should we get to run
that first leg out of Nenana?

517
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:55,414
Wild Bill Shannon.

518
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:12,314
Thank you for watching her.

519
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:15,016
Of course.

520
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:24,280
I met with George,
your father, and Gunnar.

521
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:27,214
We all came up with a plan.

522
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:31,080
Going to run 20 mushers
along the mail route.

523
00:35:33,116 --> 00:35:34,235
About 700 miles.

524
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,781
Togo and I leave
day after tomorrow.

525
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:43,280
You can do this?

526
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:46,381
Yes.

527
00:35:48,182 --> 00:35:50,380
We're going to get that
medicine here.

528
00:35:57,249 --> 00:35:58,488
I, uh...

529
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:06,047
I'm really scared
Sigrid's going to get this.

530
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:12,147
If that day comes,
I will treat her like my own

531
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:13,681
and I will not leave her side.

532
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:21,280
But it won't come to that.

533
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:27,581
She loves you.

534
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:32,567
She talks about you
all the time.

535
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:39,681
Just be safe.

536
00:36:43,783 --> 00:36:45,214
We will.

537
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:07,780
Constance, would you please
check the patients

538
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:09,564
and take their temperatures?

539
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:11,346
Anybody over a hundred
is first priority.

540
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:12,347
Of course.

541
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:14,214
Hi, Akina.

542
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:17,314
Now listen, we can't take such
good care of you at your house.

543
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:20,214
So you're going to stay at
my house for a few days, okay?

544
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:22,014
So say goodbye
to Mommy and Daddy.

545
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:23,047
We'll get you well.

546
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:24,014
It's right here for you, Akina.

547
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:25,581
Love you so much.

548
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:26,861
Good girl, let's go.

549
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:32,736
- Come on, baby.
- I love you, baby.

550
00:37:32,737 --> 00:37:34,047
- It's okay.
- It's going to be okay.

551
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:35,047
- I'll take care of her.
- Okay, thank you.

552
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:36,547
Come here, sweetheart.

553
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:51,581
I'm gonna miss you Daddy.

554
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:52,781
I'll miss you too.

555
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:03,180
Take care of my Daddy, okay?

556
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,080
Don't-don't leave me.

557
00:38:07,082 --> 00:38:08,514
I'll be waiting
right here for you baby,

558
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:09,713
when you're all better, okay?

559
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:10,646
We'll take good care of her.

560
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:11,927
Come with me now.

561
00:38:13,016 --> 00:38:14,080
I'm scared.

562
00:38:16,216 --> 00:38:17,347
I promise, baby.

563
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,414
We're going to take
good care of you.

564
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:25,646
- It's okay.

565
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:31,247
<i>Hey, George.</i>

566
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:45,546
Well, the serum's on the train
bound for Nenana.

567
00:38:47,082 --> 00:38:48,747
Good.

568
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:51,280
Weather seems to be holding.

569
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:53,513
It is for now.

570
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:57,414
I checked the weather report
on the wire.

571
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,546
It's not good.

572
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:01,347
Well, we'll make it.

573
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,480
The team won't quit on Togo.

574
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:06,446
I know how you feel
about that dog of yours,

575
00:39:06,448 --> 00:39:09,381
but like a lot of us
around here,

576
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:13,114
he's getting a little long
in the tooth.

577
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:16,247
Maybe you could
use another lead dog?

578
00:39:19,082 --> 00:39:21,480
These temperatures,
they'll freeze your lungs,

579
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:23,447
you-you know that?

580
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:25,413
George, I'm not going out there
without him.

581
00:39:25,415 --> 00:39:27,014
What is Togo?

582
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,147
Eleven?
Twelve years old?

583
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:32,180
Yeah, he's twelve. And
he's the best lead dog I got.

584
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:34,614
He's going with me.

585
00:39:36,682 --> 00:39:37,841
What's this all about George?

586
00:39:40,149 --> 00:39:41,747
We need that serum, don't we?

587
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:43,713
Yes, we do.

588
00:39:46,782 --> 00:39:47,781
I can do it.

589
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:53,114
Oh, I know you can. But if
anything bad happens out there,

590
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:55,513
you find a hole
and you get down in it.

591
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:56,780
I will.

592
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:59,580
You just make sure
each of those mushers

593
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:01,380
are at those checkpoints
with fresh dogs.

594
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,613
I could do that.

595
00:40:05,615 --> 00:40:07,546
Thanks for looking after Sigrid.

596
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:08,827
We'll be praying for you.

597
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:11,614
Thanks, George.

598
00:40:24,149 --> 00:40:25,346
It's dropping below 40.

599
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:30,380
Maybe you should wait
until the morning to leave?

600
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,546
Oh, no thank you. No.

601
00:40:44,116 --> 00:40:46,074
You know the rule
of the forties?

602
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:49,313
No, I-I can't say that I do.

603
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:55,313
You never run a dog
if it's 40 above or 40 below.

604
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:02,546
You run a dog
when it's 40 above,

605
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:03,613
can overheat.

606
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:07,047
I saw one drop dead once.

607
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:15,513
You run a dog if it's 40 below,
could burn its lungs out.

608
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:20,347
Not a pretty picture.

609
00:41:23,382 --> 00:41:27,313
The air freezes
and every breath you take

610
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:29,513
is like shoving a knife
in your lungs.

611
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:38,179
Your legs go numb,
your arms go numb.

612
00:41:39,448 --> 00:41:41,179
You start to see things.

613
00:41:45,315 --> 00:41:49,546
And if those dogs give out,
they'll find you and them dead.

614
00:41:52,181 --> 00:41:53,246
Oh, my.

615
00:42:05,048 --> 00:42:08,513
But...
but Mr. Shan,

616
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:11,614
that's...

617
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,480
that's why I think you should
wait until tomorrow to leave.

618
00:42:16,482 --> 00:42:20,079
Wait at least
until the storm passes.

619
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:21,160
Then you can see the trail.

620
00:42:23,515 --> 00:42:29,246
Besides, it's...
orders from the governor.

621
00:42:29,248 --> 00:42:31,446
The hell with the governor.

622
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:35,146
As soon as that medicine
gets here, I'm leaving.

623
00:42:57,181 --> 00:42:59,213
Mr. Wetzler?
- Yeah, yeah. Here.

624
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:00,513
Here you go.

625
00:43:00,515 --> 00:43:01,480
It's the antiserum.

626
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:02,546
Hey.

627
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:24,580
Ready, Blackie?

628
00:43:24,582 --> 00:43:26,346
All right, boy, let's go.

629
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:28,480
We better get this thing
put together.

630
00:43:33,115 --> 00:43:34,346
Hai!

631
00:43:58,748 --> 00:44:01,480
Yeah, it's going to be our
toughest race yet, boy.

632
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:03,213
I know, I know
you're ready to go.

633
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:06,746
I'm not going out there
without you.

634
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:09,413
No man.

635
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,446
Let's load up.

636
00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:49,273
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you.

637
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:11,047
Let's go.

638
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:14,612
Come on, boy!

639
00:45:14,614 --> 00:45:15,679
Hai!

640
00:45:27,315 --> 00:45:30,013
You asked me
to prepare a plane for you

641
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:31,579
and to find a pilot,

642
00:45:31,581 --> 00:45:36,213
and instead you were choosing to
transport the serum with dogs.

643
00:45:36,215 --> 00:45:38,046
<i>I hope you know
what you're doing.</i>

644
00:45:38,048 --> 00:45:41,512
You're willing to-to trust
the lives of these poor souls

645
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:43,412
<i>to a Stone Age solution.</i>

646
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:49,146
Sled dogs, Governor, this is
why Alaska is a laughingstock.

647
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:50,146
Well, I'm doing what I think

648
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:51,479
is best for the people in Nome.

649
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,179
It's the safest way, William.

650
00:45:53,181 --> 00:45:56,079
And you may not agree with me
at the... at the moment,

651
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:59,545
<i>but getting that serum
safely there is the key.</i>

652
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:02,545
Now you couldn't even get your
damn plane off the runway.

653
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:05,579
My engineer
has found the problem

654
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:08,013
and we are working right now
on a solution.

655
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,179
I just need another day.

656
00:46:09,181 --> 00:46:11,146
We don't have time.
They need the serum.

657
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:13,679
And they will have it.
My plane will get it there.

658
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:15,545
Well, the mushers assure me

659
00:46:15,547 --> 00:46:19,079
<i>that they can cover
the mail route in six days.</i>

660
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:22,512
<i>The mail route,
that's nearly 700 miles,</i>

661
00:46:22,514 --> 00:46:25,645
<i>and you have an Arctic storm
bearing down from the north.</i>

662
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:27,279
<i>The dogs will never make it.</i>

663
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:29,545
<i>Yeah, well, I made my decision.</i>

664
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:34,412
Then the fate of Nome lies
in the hands of dogs, Governor.

665
00:46:34,414 --> 00:46:35,746
<i>I hope you're right.</i>

666
00:46:35,748 --> 00:46:37,645
<i>I hope so too.</i>

667
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:38,646
Good bye, William.

668
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,146
Hai! Let's go Togo.

669
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:48,345
Whoa, whoa.

670
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,612
Come on, Skye.
Hold that line. Let's go.

671
00:46:52,447 --> 00:46:54,445
Good boy, good boy. Hai!

672
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:02,212
Hai!

673
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:06,712
I tell you, this cold is setting
in my heart and in my bones.

674
00:47:06,714 --> 00:47:08,278
You've been north
of the Norton Sound,

675
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,779
50, 60 below, ain't you?

676
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:12,079
Aren't you a believer?

677
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:13,178
You think them dogs
are going to make

678
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,645
700 miles in 80 below?

679
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:18,178
Don't you got money
in an airplane somewhere?

680
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,212
Trying to put us all
out of work?

681
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:21,579
You know what you don't need
in Hell?

682
00:47:21,581 --> 00:47:23,013
<i>A devil's advocate.</i>

683
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:24,512
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

684
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:37,345
Get the dogs.
Get the dogs!

685
00:47:41,147 --> 00:47:42,426
Goddamn.

686
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:46,145
It's Hell out there.

687
00:47:59,114 --> 00:48:00,113
<i>Hold on a moment folks.</i>

688
00:48:01,314 --> 00:48:03,746
<i>This has just been handed to me.</i>

689
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:07,645
<i>"Musher Wild Bill Shannon has
just arrived in Whiskey Creek</i>

690
00:48:07,647 --> 00:48:11,245
<i>"and passed the lifesaving serum
off to Dan Green.</i>

691
00:48:11,247 --> 00:48:13,312
<i>Brave souls indeed."</i>

692
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:19,645
Keep going boy, keep going.

693
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,012
Hai! Let's go.

694
00:48:31,314 --> 00:48:32,679
Ruth, I promise you

695
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:35,212
I'm going to take as best
care of her as I can, okay?

696
00:48:35,214 --> 00:48:38,012
- Can I see her?
- Not yet. Sorry.

697
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:51,078
Her fever's rising.
A hundred and five.

698
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,459
Constance, bring me the serum.

699
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,178
The serum? It's expired.
Will it even work?

700
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,679
We can try and keep
their airways open,

701
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:03,345
but at some point...

702
00:49:06,014 --> 00:49:07,013
Of course.

703
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,079
Thank you.

704
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:37,859
What's the message?

705
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,379
"Where's the serum?"

706
00:49:49,314 --> 00:49:52,579
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy.

707
00:49:52,581 --> 00:49:54,212
Let's go. Let's go.

708
00:49:54,214 --> 00:49:57,479
- "We have lost contact."

709
00:49:57,481 --> 00:49:59,078
Get your papers,
ladies and gentlemen.

710
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,479
- News out of Nome.
- Critical in Nome!

711
00:50:00,481 --> 00:50:02,479
Critical in Nome!
Two cents a paper!

712
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:07,679
"We're running out of time."

713
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:12,420
<i>You got to speed them up.</i>

714
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:16,345
<i>No, the dogs
are making progress,</i>

715
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,379
<i>they're just not fast enough.</i>

716
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:20,645
We could be at Shaktoolik
by the time Seppala gets there.

717
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:21,778
But Sir, that-that's risky.

718
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,045
What if there's no way
to inform Seppala

719
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:25,612
of the change of plan?
And in this blizzard,

720
00:50:25,613 --> 00:50:27,177
those mushers could pass
right by each other, Sir.

721
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,711
Well, I'm not going to sit here
twiddling my thumbs

722
00:50:28,713 --> 00:50:30,245
and getting blamed

723
00:50:30,247 --> 00:50:32,045
- for an epidemic.
- Okay!

724
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:34,546
<i>This has just been handed to me.</i>

725
00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:37,045
<i>"Musher Dan Green has just
arrived in Whiskey Creek</i>

726
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:41,145
"and passed the lifesaving
serum off to Charlie Evans.

727
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:43,312
<i>"Brave souls indeed.</i>

728
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:46,745
"Bit by bit, mile by mile,
they get closer and closer

729
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:50,178
"to the midway point
of Nulato, Alaska.

730
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,678
<i>"And from that point on,
it will be up to Nome native</i>

731
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,345
<i>Leonhard Seppala."</i>

732
00:50:54,347 --> 00:50:56,678
They said your dad's name
on the radio.

733
00:50:58,547 --> 00:51:00,362
<i>"He'll face the most dangerous</i>

734
00:51:00,363 --> 00:51:02,178
<i>"leg of the relay over the
unpredictable shifting ice</i>

00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,778
<i>"of the Norton Sound.</i>

736
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:07,745
<i>"And then the treacherous passes
of the Brooks Mountains.</i>

737
00:51:07,747 --> 00:51:10,778
"The fate of Nome
will be in his hands.

738
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,412
<i>But with 400 miles left to go,
will he get there in time?"</i>

739
00:51:17,347 --> 00:51:21,112
<i>Stay tuned, folks
for more news out of Alaska.</i>

740
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:23,544
<i>This is Harry Davenport
signing off.</i>

741
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,679
I'll take her to a bed.

742
00:51:51,747 --> 00:51:53,644
You're okay. You're
going to be okay, sweetheart.

743
00:51:53,646 --> 00:51:55,045
Yeah.

744
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:56,478
You're going to be all right.

745
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,711
We're going to take care of you,
sweetheart.

746
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,678
So sorry, Constance.

747
00:52:02,446 --> 00:52:04,644
We're going to take care of you.

748
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,045
<i>Has he got the serum yet?</i>

749
00:52:19,047 --> 00:52:21,444
Temperatures dropped
to 80 below,

750
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:23,778
and we don't know where Sepp is.

751
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,444
<i>Lines are in and out.</i>

752
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:29,711
I'm going to send Gunnar
out there to try to find him.

753
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,012
You've seen it
down there, George.

754
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,644
It's-It's very bad now.

755
00:52:33,646 --> 00:52:37,245
We don't have much time,
so do what you have to do, okay?

756
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,525
I will.

757
00:52:39,747 --> 00:52:41,344
<i>Balto! Hai!</i>

758
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,411
Ah!
I barely made twelve miles.

759
00:52:53,413 --> 00:52:54,478
Get inside!

760
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,578
By the fire!

761
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,277
You need to get warm.

762
00:52:58,279 --> 00:52:59,411
You're going through this?

763
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:00,692
Just as far as Ungalik.

764
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,045
Maynard wants us to stay there
until the storm passes.

765
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,145
<i>What about Seppala?</i>

766
00:53:11,613 --> 00:53:14,045
Maybe he's in Ungalik already.

767
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:15,444
Come on!

768
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,745
I'm so sorry.

769
00:54:18,747 --> 00:54:22,012
Anguta has called Akina home.

770
00:54:27,513 --> 00:54:29,111
She's gone.

771
00:54:54,046 --> 00:54:57,011
Right there. Be careful.
Gen-gentle, gentle.

772
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:03,178
Yeah.

773
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:07,578
I tended to the dogs.

774
00:55:13,613 --> 00:55:16,578
Any news from Nome?

775
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,611
Myles, any news from Nome?

776
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,077
Siggy. Siggy's sick.

777
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:32,144
No. No.

778
00:55:32,146 --> 00:55:34,511
Maynard got a telegraph through.

779
00:55:34,513 --> 00:55:36,591
She's in the hospital
with Constance.

780
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:41,011
Sepp, you can't go out
like this.

781
00:55:41,013 --> 00:55:43,177
- Not now.
- Pack the crate.

782
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:44,778
Maynard wants you
to stay in Ungalik

783
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,411
until the storm passes.

784
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:48,277
Pack the crate.

785
00:55:48,279 --> 00:55:50,311
Sepp, you're dead tired.

786
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,344
I said pack the crate!

787
00:55:57,246 --> 00:56:00,745
Your daddy and Togo,
they're going to come back.

788
00:56:02,213 --> 00:56:04,544
And they're going to have
some medicine for you.

789
00:56:04,546 --> 00:56:06,824
And I started
a new dress for you.

790
00:56:08,213 --> 00:56:12,177
And it's pink and yellow,
it's your favorite colors.

791
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:14,337
You're going to look so pretty.

792
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:23,578
He's going to be here
real soon, okay?

793
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,511
Have to stay with me,
sweetheart.

794
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:29,411
You just hang in there, okay?

795
00:56:29,413 --> 00:56:31,777
Do you have a quote
for the evening edition?

796
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:34,511
Oh.

797
00:56:34,513 --> 00:56:39,177
"Our last hope rests on the dogs
and their heroic mushers."

798
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:41,057
<i>There's your quote, William.</i>

799
00:56:42,013 --> 00:56:43,012
<i>Thank you, Governor.</i>

800
00:56:44,413 --> 00:56:46,710
Oh, have a little faith,
William.

801
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:49,211
You ever heard of that concept?

802
00:57:32,246 --> 00:57:33,444
Let's go, Togo!

803
00:57:36,413 --> 00:57:39,378
- Go!

804
00:57:43,313 --> 00:57:44,543
Faster, boys! Faster!

805
00:58:00,512 --> 00:58:01,610
<i>Ha! Ha!</i>

806
00:58:39,013 --> 00:58:40,510
Are the lines up?

807
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:41,710
They're in and out.

808
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:58,961
<i>This is Harry Davenport</i>

809
00:58:58,962 --> 00:59:01,777
<i>with another installment
of the race against death.</i>

810
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:04,277
<i>Governor Bone of Alaska
says that all hope</i>

811
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:05,410
<i>now rests on the dogs</i>

812
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:07,510
<i>and their heroic mushers.</i>

813
00:59:07,512 --> 00:59:09,643
<i>But time is running out
in faraway Nome.</i>

814
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:13,710
<i>And Leonhard Seppala
is nowhere to be found.</i>

815
00:59:13,712 --> 00:59:16,277
<i>And now all we can do is pray.</i>

816
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:18,144
<i>Pray for Leonhard Seppala.</i>

817
00:59:18,146 --> 00:59:19,610
<i>And pray for the good citizens</i>

818
00:59:19,612 --> 00:59:21,144
of Nome.

819
01:00:07,113 --> 01:00:08,744
Hold, boy!

820
01:00:10,178 --> 01:00:11,343
Hold the line, boy!

821
01:00:25,779 --> 01:00:27,343
Togo, hold the line.

822
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,043
Pull!

823
01:00:55,145 --> 01:00:57,543
Pull, boy! Pull!

824
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,076
Hold the line!

825
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:09,143
Pull!

826
01:01:17,012 --> 01:01:19,477
Togo, hold the line! Pull!

827
01:01:29,112 --> 01:01:31,310
Come on, boy! Pull!

828
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,276
Let's get home.

829
01:02:10,779 --> 01:02:12,057
Let's ride.

830
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:51,477
It's okay, Togo.

831
01:02:51,479 --> 01:02:53,776
I got you.

832
01:02:53,778 --> 01:02:55,377
Let's put you in the sled.

833
01:02:56,379 --> 01:02:57,776
I know you're hurt.

834
01:03:10,445 --> 01:03:12,283
I need to get some air, father.

835
01:03:23,278 --> 01:03:24,343
Come on.

836
01:03:24,345 --> 01:03:25,577
Let's get out of the snow.

837
01:03:26,644 --> 01:03:28,510
Come on. All right, come on.

838
01:03:56,479 --> 01:03:57,609
Come on, boy.

839
01:04:51,745 --> 01:04:57,043
<i>Daddy, Daddy, wake up. Daddy.</i>

840
01:05:25,344 --> 01:05:26,509
Come on, boy.

841
01:05:27,745 --> 01:05:29,310
Don't give up now.

842
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,210
You got to lead us home.

843
01:05:37,112 --> 01:05:39,076
Morning, Henrietta.

844
01:05:39,078 --> 01:05:40,210
Morning.

845
01:06:20,511 --> 01:06:23,242
Everyone is sleeping.

846
01:06:23,244 --> 01:06:24,342
Good. Good.

847
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:27,602
Everyone except you and me.

848
01:06:30,045 --> 01:06:32,175
Well, I closed
my eyes for a while,

849
01:06:32,177 --> 01:06:33,576
but the nightmares came back.

850
01:06:37,711 --> 01:06:42,175
You know when the flu
epidemic of '18 broke out,

851
01:06:42,177 --> 01:06:43,409
they died by the hundreds.

852
01:06:46,012 --> 01:06:49,242
We lost half of the
Inuit population in this town.

853
01:06:53,745 --> 01:06:55,776
I mean, I was, I was helpless.

854
01:06:58,478 --> 01:07:00,309
And now it's happening again.

855
01:07:01,611 --> 01:07:04,376
You're doing such a good job.
You can't blame yourself.

856
01:07:08,311 --> 01:07:10,043
I delivered
most of these children.

857
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:15,275
I brought them
into this world and...

858
01:07:15,277 --> 01:07:17,442
so, in a way...

859
01:07:19,544 --> 01:07:21,275
they're my children too.

860
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:27,142
I feel the same way.

861
01:07:30,211 --> 01:07:32,609
I love those little hearts
out there like my own.

862
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:37,542
I love Sigrid
like she's my own daughter.

863
01:07:40,344 --> 01:07:42,109
All of those children
have helped us both

864
01:07:42,111 --> 01:07:43,409
through difficult times.

865
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:47,816
And now it's our turn
to help them.

866
01:07:49,678 --> 01:07:51,142
Don't lose faith.

867
01:08:55,277 --> 01:08:56,309
Is Sigrid okay?

868
01:08:56,311 --> 01:08:57,590
Yeah, yeah, she's okay.

869
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:13,742
Balto, let's go!

870
01:09:35,277 --> 01:09:37,409
Sigrid,

871
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:39,609
Sigrid can you hear me?

872
01:09:39,611 --> 01:09:41,509
Sigrid, Alice and
five other children

873
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,242
have reached the point
of unconsciousness

874
01:09:43,244 --> 01:09:45,109
and the swelling in their
throats is getting worse.

875
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:46,442
You have to keep
replacing the compresses

876
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:47,542
to keep the swelling down.

877
01:09:47,544 --> 01:09:49,142
And don't forget the neck, okay?

878
01:09:58,144 --> 01:09:59,942
Let's go, Balto, let's go!

879
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,275
No, stay with me honey.

880
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:18,342
- Gee! Gee! Gee!

881
01:10:30,444 --> 01:10:32,601
Ilsa, can you
stay with the children?

882
01:10:37,577 --> 01:10:39,075
- Whoa!
- You made it!

883
01:10:39,077 --> 01:10:40,309
Balto, whoa.

884
01:10:46,444 --> 01:10:48,309
Good job, Gunnar.

885
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:49,709
The medicine, it's here.

886
01:10:52,311 --> 01:10:53,475
Easy, easy, easy.

887
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:57,708
Thank you.

888
01:10:59,044 --> 01:11:00,175
Did you see Sepp?

889
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:01,376
He was behind me.

890
01:11:15,144 --> 01:11:17,075
Let's go home, boy.

891
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,608
There he is.

892
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:42,175
Incredible.

893
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:44,374
They're all intact.
Not a single vial broken.

894
01:11:45,077 --> 01:11:46,242
Doctor, is it going to work?

895
01:11:46,244 --> 01:11:48,042
George, please get these
people out of here.

896
01:11:48,044 --> 01:11:49,341
We need quiet.
Please, please.

897
01:11:49,343 --> 01:11:50,525
Let's move. Let's move.
All of you.

898
01:11:50,526 --> 01:11:51,708
How long do we have to wait?

899
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:52,891
It's going to be
at least a few minutes

900
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:54,074
for these to thaw out,
before injecting.

901
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:55,308
Ilsa, I want you
to go ahead of us

902
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,142
and sterilize their arms.

903
01:11:57,144 --> 01:11:58,242
- And Constance.
- Yes.

904
01:11:58,244 --> 01:11:59,209
You prepare the syringes.

905
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:01,142
Yes, Father.

906
01:12:01,144 --> 01:12:02,143
Let's go to work.

907
01:12:08,543 --> 01:12:10,641
These seem be the most thawed.

908
01:12:10,643 --> 01:12:13,242
We'll start with the worst
cases first going bed to bed.

909
01:12:47,677 --> 01:12:50,109
Thank God.

910
01:12:50,111 --> 01:12:52,375
Is... is Sigrid okay?

911
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:37,608
<i>Daddy. Daddy, wake up.</i>

912
01:13:41,643 --> 01:13:43,308
<i>Daddy.</i>

913
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:46,208
<i>It's Sigrid. Wake up.</i>

914
01:13:49,577 --> 01:13:51,274
<i>Wake up.</i>

915
01:14:03,543 --> 01:14:04,675
<i>Daddy.</i>

916
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:07,742
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

917
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:09,241
<i>It's Siggy.</i>

918
01:14:10,343 --> 01:14:11,775
Take care of her.

919
01:14:32,477 --> 01:14:33,508
<i>Wake up.</i>

920
01:14:38,276 --> 01:14:39,508
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

921
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,341
Daddy.

922
01:14:46,744 --> 01:14:50,074
Daddy, wake up.

923
01:14:50,076 --> 01:14:52,241
It's Siggy.

924
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:53,641
The medicine worked.

925
01:14:58,377 --> 01:15:01,241
I missed you, I love you, Daddy.

926
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:15,375
You look so beautiful.

927
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:16,475
Thank you, Daddy.

928
01:15:19,043 --> 01:15:21,508
Constance took care of me.

929
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:23,274
And Togo took care of you.

930
01:15:25,176 --> 01:15:26,742
You saved a lot of lives, Sepp.

931
01:15:28,377 --> 01:15:30,041
Togo brought you back.

932
01:15:39,276 --> 01:15:40,708
I love you, Daddy.

933
01:15:43,143 --> 01:15:44,774
I love you too, baby.

934
01:15:52,176 --> 01:15:54,041
I'm glad you're okay.

935
01:15:58,776 --> 01:16:00,008
<i>Hello, folks.</i>

936
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:01,575
This is Harry Davenport,

937
01:16:01,577 --> 01:16:05,241
bringing you what I'm happy
to say is the last installment

938
01:16:05,243 --> 01:16:07,041
of the race against death.

939
01:16:07,043 --> 01:16:08,774
Governor, the
epidemic's been averted, Sir.

940
01:16:08,776 --> 01:16:10,055
Nome's saved.

941
01:16:15,377 --> 01:16:16,655
You did it Sir.

942
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:31,241
You have one
very tough little girl.

943
01:16:31,243 --> 01:16:35,041
But that doesn't surprise me,
given her father.

944
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:38,389
Thank you.

945
01:16:39,477 --> 01:16:41,574
Maybe I'll see
you both at church on Sunday?

946
01:16:44,043 --> 01:16:46,141
Yeah.

947
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,660
Yeah, I reckon we'll be there.

948
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:58,341
- Yippee!
- Whoo!

949
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:09,674
Sir, I have Calvin Coolidge
on the phone for you.

950
01:17:09,676 --> 01:17:10,741
He's on the line.

951
01:17:10,743 --> 01:17:13,141
- The President?
- Hmm-mm.

952
01:17:13,143 --> 01:17:14,540
Oh, my.

953
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:15,741
Mr. President?

954
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:24,741
You know,
they say every dog has his day.

955
01:17:24,743 --> 01:17:27,274
Well, for the
noble sled dogs of Alaska,

956
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:31,174
- I'd say today was that day.

957
01:17:31,176 --> 01:17:32,640
Yay, I'm so happy!

958
01:17:32,642 --> 01:17:34,607
Real proud of you, son.

959
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:36,527
- Thanks, George.
- Proud of you.

960
01:17:50,243 --> 01:17:51,774
<i>The entire world now breathes</i>

961
01:17:51,776 --> 01:17:54,540
a collective sigh of relief.

962
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:56,774
I think this editorial
from the Daily News-Miner

963
01:17:56,776 --> 01:17:59,074
sums it up best.

964
01:17:59,076 --> 01:18:01,374
<i>We thank those brave men
and their valiant dogs</i>

965
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:03,741
<i>for saving so many lives.</i>

966
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:05,774
<i>But we owe them
a bigger debt of gratitude</i>

967
01:18:05,776 --> 01:18:08,474
<i>for showing us
that anything is possible</i>

968
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:12,340
<i>when you have hope and courage.</i>

969
01:18:12,342 --> 01:18:14,008
The Stone Age.

970
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:37,340
<i>This is Harry Davenport,</i>

971
01:18:37,342 --> 01:18:39,208
signing off.

972
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:41,474
Thanks for
bringing my daddy home.

973
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:17,741
<i>There was a higher Spirit</i>

974
01:19:17,743 --> 01:19:19,707
<i>that guided those men and dogs</i>

975
01:19:19,709 --> 01:19:22,574
<i>across the harsh conditions
of our land.</i>

976
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,741
<i>Seppala would never
see the wolf again.</i>

977
01:19:38,109 --> 01:19:40,774
<i>His love for his dogs
never changed.</i>

978
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:44,273
<i>And the wild spirit</i>

979
01:19:44,275 --> 01:19:47,407
<i>would find good times ahead.</i>
