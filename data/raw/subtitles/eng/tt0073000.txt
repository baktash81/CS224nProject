1
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,684
There, that's good.

2
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:24,143
Luckily we've got ace photographer
Angus Snapforth to do our credits.

3
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:27,476
He works longitudinally -

4
00:00:27,643 --> 00:00:32,143
- developing his negatives
in Turkish-bath cabinet.

5
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,809
So this should be just the job for him.

6
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:40,684
And he has promised to make it snappy.

7
00:01:56,976 --> 00:02:02,559
37 miles to the north, a bit east,
and then up a bit lies Pinchcliff.

8
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:06,643
A village perched
under the blue welkin -

9
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:12,184
-with it's own steam-driven cheese
factory, a camping site, a local paper -

10
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:15,559
-and it's own TV station.

11
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:22,809
Open to all the winds that blow, where
the sun rises above Lonetree Hill -

12
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,476
-lives our cycle-repairer,
Theodore Rimspoke.

13
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:31,851
Must be awkward for a wretched cyclist
with a blow-out -

14
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:38,726
-to have to wheel his mount all
this way to get our expert to fix it.

15
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:44,226
Doesn't look as if business
is very thriving, does it?

16
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:50,393
It's only our postman, old foot-slogging
Dan Hoofer, who makes his way there -

17
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:55,809
- with the local rag and outstanding
bills. His greatcoat has diamond tread.

18
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,559
He's colour blind and
has been run over a couple of times -

19
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:06,643
- walks with a list to port and plays
the big bass on festive occasions.

20
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:10,684
Not much more to say about Hoofer.

21
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:21,059
Cycle-repairer Rimspoke
is an independent sort of bloke.

22
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:24,934
More of an inventor than a businessman.

23
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:28,809
Famous for his ingenious designs, -

24
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:34,351
-such as pedal-activated combined
shaving and raspberry-picking machine.

25
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:41,476
He uses a copying pencil, instant coffee
and his own patent telescopic ruler.

26
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:46,768
Sonny Duckworth is
the early bird personified.

27
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:50,643
Hatched out
in a weeping willow. A born optimist -

28
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:56,018
- with muffler, felt slippers and
indifferent morals. As Sonny puts it:

29
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:59,559
The early worm gets the bird.

30
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:05,518
Difficulties he treats as trifles,
the impossible as a challenge.

31
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:11,059
He's Rimspoke's right-hand man,
counsellor, and friend.

32
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:19,351
Lambert is a night-owl with hay-fever,
a pillar of the rustic establishment.

33
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:25,059
Run over by a reaper and got a
crew-cut, short back, bushy by the ears.

34
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:30,393
Found under the roots of a knotted oak
and included as a Rimspoke resident.

35
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:35,934
Lambert is a personal pessimist, and
only really at home in Darkest Devon.

36
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:40,143
And this is their home,
standing in its own pleasant grounds, -

37
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:45,309
-enjoying all the benefits of
Rimspoke's ingenious gadgets.

38
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:31,434
Well, string me up
and stuff me in a hen-coop!

39
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:56,226
Hi, Theodore! Look at this.

40
00:05:56,393 --> 00:05:59,059
This morning's post.

41
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:04,476
Nothing but bills. Put them
on the window sill with the others.

42
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:08,851
Take a look at that super car!

43
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:18,018
Look at that there Rudolph Gore-Slimey!

44
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:23,684
-Do you know that fellow?
-Know him?

45
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:28,476
-Yes, I'll say I know him.
-Do you know him personal?

46
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:35,351
That there Rudolph, he was a kind
of apprentice to me in my workshop.

47
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:40,976
Then he suddenly
packed it in and went to town.

48
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:46,226
And now he's in big business,
and a racing driver, I see.

49
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:51,226
You don't say...? Big business, too?

50
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:55,393
Beats me how that there Gore-Slimey -

51
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:59,309
- got into the racing circuit?

52
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:03,851
Competing with
the best in the world, it says.

53
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:07,934
Look! Smashing picture on the back too.

54
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:11,518
Well, I never...!

55
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:14,684
I might have guessed as much.

56
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,434
Guessed? Guessed what?

57
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:23,184
I wonder what he's got
under his bonnet?

58
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:29,601
So that's why Gore-Slimey was
in such a hurry to go to town, huh?

59
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:33,309
There's some skulduggery
going on here.

60
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:39,143
-More trouble brewing, I'll wager...
-No, no, Lambert.

61
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:43,434
Say, Theodore, what's skulduggery?

62
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:46,643
Yeh, what's skulduggery?

63
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:51,768
Well, we better get down
to some honest work.

64
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:54,434
Out with you, and set to work!

65
00:07:54,601 --> 00:08:00,684
When the call to work goes out,
Brother, please include me out!

66
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:05,018
Put your hat and coat on, Lambert!

67
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,934
Come on!

68
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,101
I see, doing your daily dozen, Lambert?

69
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:34,101
I say, what's skulduggery, Sonny?

70
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:38,393
Skulduggery?

71
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,726
That <i>is</i> skulduggery!

72
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,976
Oh.

73
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:55,101
The north wind's blowing
from every quarter today, Sonny?

74
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:58,268
Lovely weather for working.

75
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:02,809
I'm scared, I am.

76
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:07,351
I don't like it when
it's blowing from every quarter.

77
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:13,809
-Let's get this contraption working!
-All, right, just leave it to me.

78
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:22,559
Computerised production of
flagpoles for the Swiss Navy!

79
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:25,476
That'll be 10, 75.

80
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:08,976
Theodore is self-supporting, has his
own electric power, water laid on -

81
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:16,476
- and turns an honest penny on the side.
Lambert remains a true romantic.

82
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:23,184
Despite his chronic hay fever
Lambert is conspicuously on parade -

83
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:27,768
-whenever the sun
shines down at Pinchcliffe.

84
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:34,726
You'd hardly say life at Rimspoke's
is one mad rush, but now and again -

85
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:38,351
-a buckled wheel
or a bent handlebar needs attention.

86
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:44,851
The profits are hardly likely to cause
repercussions on the money market -

87
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:49,601
-still the three of them up the hill
are content enough.

88
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:09,934
Don't be frightened, Lambert.
I'll switch the TV on, Theodore.

89
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:14,643
-I don't like TV.
-There's no bogeyman in the box.

90
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,476
You never can tell, can you.

91
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:27,476
<i>And now for the news, read by</i>
<i>pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.</i>

92
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:31,268
This is usually pretty exciting.

93
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:37,309
<i>The situation is still</i>
<i>very tense in the Middle East.</i>

94
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,601
<i>Here...</i>

95
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,976
-Dang me sideways!
-I'm scared, I am, Theodore.

96
00:13:43,143 --> 00:13:48,351
<i>And now after the news,</i>
<i>the World of Sport.</i>

97
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:54,684
We deserve a little extra treat tonight.

98
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:59,101
I expect you'd like
some dewrinkled raisins, Sonny?

99
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:02,393
Help yourself,
there's plenty for everyone.

100
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,809
<i>... the current Motor Racing</i>
<i>sensation, Rudolph Gore-Slimey.</i>

101
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:13,601
<i>After winning his third successive</i>
<i>Grand Prix. A few words, please.</i>

102
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:21,559
<i>I came of humble stock from</i>
<i>the little village of Pinchcliffe.</i>

103
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:27,309
<i>Worked for a while in a cycle repair</i>
<i>shop run by an eccentric rustic.</i>

104
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:31,559
<i>Forget his name... Theodore...</i>

105
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:35,143
<i>Theodore Rimspoke, I think it was.</i>

106
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:39,268
-Just hark at him... I mean to say...
-Quiet now, Sonny!

107
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,601
<i>Humble beginnings, eh?</i>

108
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:46,809
<i>Funny to think how easy it can be</i>
<i>to get stuck in a rut like that place.</i>

109
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:49,768
<i>But there was no stopping you?</i>

110
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:55,643
<i>No, and I think my latest invention</i>
<i>will revolutionise motor racing!</i>

111
00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:00,476
<i>-What invention?</i>
<i>-This super retometric distributor.</i>

112
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:06,393
<i>It raises the jet-injection factor to</i>
<i>1000 and the corradial effect by 1 12%.</i>

113
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:12,726
So that's your game! So that's
your invention, is it, Rudolph?

114
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:16,476
Funny, because here's
the working drawing!

115
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:23,518
What did you say? Has Gore-Slimey
gone and swiped your invention?

116
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:28,684
Yes, he must have collared it when
he was working here as my assistant.

117
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:35,559
Well, string me up and stuff me in
a hen-coop. I never heard the like!

118
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:43,393
I say, please, could you
pass me another liquorice allsorts?

119
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,726
Hush! We must listen
to what Gore-Slimey has to say.

120
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:56,226
<i>Let me repeat, I'm prepared anytime,</i>
<i>anywhere, to meet any challenge.</i>

121
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:59,059
<i>Thank you for talking to us.</i>

122
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:04,726
<i>We hope we shall soon see</i>
<i>someone putting up a challenge.</i>

123
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:17,018
<i>Now the Chairman, District Veterinary</i>
<i>Surgeon Roger Uddersfield -</i>

124
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,476
<i>-will present today's commercials.</i>

125
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:27,351
<i>For guaranteed social success, use</i>
<i>Brough, the swift-action hair tonic.</i>

126
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:32,476
-Switch off that commercial nonsense!
<i>-Remember the name, Brough!</i>

127
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:35,643
<i>Recommended by egg-heads!</i>

128
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:42,559
-Don't let them fool you, Theodore!
-Well, what's a bloke to do now?

129
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:46,018
You're going to challenge!

130
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:50,101
No, no, that'd be dangerous.

131
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:53,268
-You pipe down, Lambert!
-challenge him?

132
00:16:53,434 --> 00:17:01,268
I do have a little secret tucked away
in the coach-house. Might be fun...

133
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:06,643
Have a go! Could you get this
completed, Gore-Slimey wouldn't need -

134
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,101
- any driving-mirror!
Just imagine Il Tempo Gigante!

135
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:14,643
Rimspoke's reply
to the Italian Ferrari!

136
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:24,601
-Out of the way, macadamised snail!
-Save your felt-slippers, Sonny.

137
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:34,434
Well, shall we take a peep inside the
coach-house and see what we've got?

138
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:38,059
-Yes, let's!
-Oh, no.

139
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:47,309
There isn't much I can do
with this thing here.

140
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:51,143
It's in a sorrier state
than I suspected.

141
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:58,684
- You could soon fix this up.
- Can't build a car without a penny.

142
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:02,851
I haven't even got the nuts and bolts.

143
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:06,976
We'll have to make a real killing!

144
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:10,851
You could raise the wind, could you?

145
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:14,184
A divinity shapes our ends.

146
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,976
Stick'em up!

147
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:20,976
-Hand it over!
-Do you suppose I've got any money?

148
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:25,893
This bloke's a poor as a church mouse!

149
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:30,976
-This won't solve our problems.
-Well, blow me. I'll be...

150
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:40,268
Well, blow me. I'll be...

151
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:44,434
That really hurt.
Never felt such a pain before.

152
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:48,351
Wouldn't never ever
have thought it possible.

153
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:58,351
-Move over!
-Can't I have the inside berth tonight?

154
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:06,476
-Don't we all have our places?
-I never get the inside berth.

155
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:12,351
-There's such a draft off the floor.
-That's why I take the inside berth.

156
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,184
Come on, pipe down!

157
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:28,851
Well, good night to you, Sonny.
Sleep well.

158
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,768
Nighty!

159
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,893
Sonny!

160
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,226
Sonny!

161
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:20,226
I say, Theodore? Has he gone out?

162
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,559
I wonder why?

163
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:31,184
Theodore's feeling
a bit down in the dumps.

164
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:37,226
I wonder if it is because he hasn't got
enough money to build the car, Sonny?

165
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:42,434
Think you'll be able
to help him out, eh, Sonny?

166
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,768
Lambert, it's only a matter of time -

167
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:51,684
-before Sonny Duckworth
of Sludgemere strikes again!

168
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:06,601
I think I'll just stretch
my carcase a bit more.

169
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,934
Oi! String me up
and stuff me in a hen-coop!

170
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:05,851
Rolls-Royce 1905 model! Solid gold.

171
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:08,976
Acetylene lamps.

172
00:22:09,143 --> 00:22:14,351
Gosh, transverse interleaved
suspension. Silicon finish...

173
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:22,101
What sort of a spooky get-up is that?

174
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:25,809
He must be oozing with dough!

175
00:22:28,226 --> 00:22:32,643
Gosh! He's using
dollar bills as fly-whisks!

176
00:22:37,518 --> 00:22:41,643
"Aladdin Oil"!

177
00:22:43,393 --> 00:22:46,184
He must be one of those oil sheiks!

178
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:51,726
Perhaps we could funnel a little
in Theodore's direction...

179
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:56,559
Snickety snoo!
How too, too snickety snoo.

180
00:24:57,601 --> 00:25:02,809
If this isn't tempting providence,
I'd like to know what is.

181
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:06,809
An ape, honestly. A genuine cross
between a chimp and a gorilla.

182
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,684
This is no joking matter!

183
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:59,184
There should be plenty of money here
for Theodore's new design.

184
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:03,809
Well, string me up
and stuff me in a hen-coop!

185
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:07,643
Talk about an Oriental chick!

186
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:16,018
And that fierce-looking money-grubber!

187
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,184
Desperados!
What eez the bizniz going on here?

188
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:53,726
And the papyrus here?

189
00:28:56,518 --> 00:29:01,601
Theez eez no hieroglyphics.
Theeze eez drawing of fast motor-car.

190
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:08,726
Sensation!
Theez car work of great genius.

191
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:11,851
Where is the deesigner?

192
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:16,934
Ali, ali, Emanuel Desperados,
you fetch me theez genius!

193
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:26,851
Thrown out? Not possibull!

194
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:32,476
Throw out of the tent of
Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza?

195
00:29:32,643 --> 00:29:39,601
Idiot!
You stupid gorilla dam blockhead.

196
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:51,976
Sonny's not the type to give up easily!
At a pinch he gets his fertile brain -

197
00:29:52,143 --> 00:29:56,601
-work overtime and changes
his line of attack.

198
00:29:56,768 --> 00:30:01,393
Once his mind's made up,
there's no stopping Sonny.

199
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:07,809
Ah, yes, the Pinchcliffe Gazette.

200
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:12,268
That's an idea all right.

201
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:20,643
An ad inserted here
will have world wide coverage!

202
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:49,143
My Spanish gambit eez successful!
And it's Desperados to move.

203
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:06,976
Your check easy to overcome.
I just go through weez my castle.

204
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,976
That shake you, eh?

205
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:28,893
You theenk you vairy smart, no?
I just move my keeng...

206
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:32,226
And you get nowhere.

207
00:31:44,518 --> 00:31:49,309
Jallah.
Sheikh Bonanza checkmated?

208
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:51,684
You...!

209
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:59,851
I no time to play theez silly game with
stoopid ape. I prefer study drawing.

210
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:07,393
Emanuel Desperados.
Zees car ingenious!

211
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:16,893
You!
Throw designer out of my tent. Idiot!

212
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:19,976
You beeg blockhead!
Stoopid gorilla...

213
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:52,684
So you're up early for once, Lambert?

214
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:58,101
Yeh, gotta spend a penny.

215
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:03,893
-Perhaps you could fetch the paper?
-Yeh, I'll do that for you.

216
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:18,434
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we</i>
<i>have a sensational announcement-</i>

218
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:30,101

Aha! There's the sooper-dooper car.

226
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:14,934
What an advertisement for Aladdin Oil!

227
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:20,684
Me finance Rimspoke and we win race!

228
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:24,226
Emanuel Desperados, you drive me!

229

Emanuel, geev me completed contract!

And you, my little turtle dove,
you come visit Big Chief Rimspoke.

232
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:08,434
Desperados,
speed, queek, hurry!

233
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:13,851
Hurry, hurry!

234
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:19,601
You have trouble weez my Rolls-Royce?
My car guaranteed!

235
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:22,726
Hurry! Turn starting-handle!

236
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:27,768
Bravo!
Close zee door and get cracking!

237
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:31,518
Hurry! We late!

238
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:36,268
Now change gear!

239
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:41,684
Caramba!
Put her in reverse... there you idiot.

240
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:59,309
Snitchery snoo!

241
00:36:00,684 --> 00:36:05,726
This is tempting providence
putting all this in print.

242
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:14,893
Theodore, it says in the paper.
But where the dickens is it?

243
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:38,518
-Theodore, the paper!
-What does it say in the paper?

244
00:36:40,476 --> 00:36:43,518
It's all about your car.

245
00:36:43,684 --> 00:36:47,059
What? Let's have a look!

246
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:51,434
Well, what do you know!

247
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:56,559
Il Tempo Gigante? It's our car!

248
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:59,934
How did that old picture get into print?

249
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:59,143
Speed it up!

250
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:03,059
Dangerous suspension bridge. Hurry!

251
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:08,476
Speed it up!

252
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:36,476
"Rimspoke has accepted
Gore-Slimey's challenge."

253
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:43,434
"Prospects for the
Race of the Century."

254
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:47,601
I wonder who's gone and...?

255
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:53,726
So, that's it. Sonny has been at work.

256
00:38:53,893 --> 00:38:57,809
Yeh, Sonny has been at work.

257
00:38:57,976 --> 00:39:01,309
-Who, me?
-Yes, you!

258
00:39:01,476 --> 00:39:08,101
-What've you been up to now, Sonny?
-What've you been up to now, Sonny?

259
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:16,393
-Just a few casual acquaintances.
-Sonny's casual acquaintances, eh?

260
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:22,393
They're apt to be a bit suspect.

261
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:34,559
-I believe we've got something outside.
-Sounds like it.

262
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:43,226
Ze silence here is as profound as in
ze desert. All people inside ze house.

263
00:39:43,393 --> 00:39:47,809
Emanuel,
go knock up ze door!

264
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:58,393
Would you open the door, Lambert?
Someone's lost his way and landed here.

265
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:06,351
Hurry along, Lambert,
you like receiving visitors, I know.

266
00:40:10,643 --> 00:40:16,059
Lambert, man, don't be scared
just because the door creaks a bit.

267
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:20,851
Look at Sonny!
Cool as a prize cucumber.

268
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:30,059
-Give them a nice welcome, Lambert.
-Yes, I certainly will.

269
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:33,893
-Oh, gosh!
-Salaam, salaam!

270
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:37,559
May Allah protect thee and thy house.

271
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:43,393
I have journeyed from afar
to have a good squint at Rimspoke.

272
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:51,268
Have no fear, friend! My chauffeur
not dangerous, just a bit inquisitive.

273
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:54,184
Very, very inquisitive!

274
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:01,643
What sort of a jungle
denizen might this be?

275
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:07,184
Must have been smuggled in
in a crate of bananas.

276
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:16,809
You ze great bicycle-repairer Rimspoke?

277
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,559
Yes, that's supposed to be me.

278
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:25,476
Just step right inside.
Brew up a pot of coffee, Lambert.

279
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:32,726
Ah, you verry kind. We come to have
pow-wow and you must listen to me.

280
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:37,143
You Rimspoke brilliant designer.

281
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:44,559
I Abdul Ben Bonanza have seen TV.

282
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:49,184
I will finance your Tempo Gigante.

283
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:53,268
I plenty moneys. You plenty broke.

284
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:59,309
Well, maybe,
but what do you want me to do?

285
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:05,268
You use my oil and petrol.
Ze best in ze whole world.

286
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:10,684
She'll run on my own patent mixture.
It would be fun to give it a try.

287
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:15,476
Then pleez you sign theez contract.

288
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:18,393
No, no, that's dangerous.

289
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,768
-Do you think so, Lambert?
-Of course you'll sign, Theodore.

290
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:27,268
The offer of a century,
from friends in distant lands!

291
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:31,768
-Yes, pleez sign!
-You're on dangerous ground.

292
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:35,559
Don't listen to that Jeremiah.
It's the chance of a lifetime.

293
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:39,143
Well, it might well be.

294
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:43,143
Bravo! So now pleez sign contract.

295
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:48,393
We're heading
straight for disaster. I know it.

296
00:43:04,268 --> 00:43:07,726
It's amazing
what you can do with money!

297
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:11,476
And a string of oil wells
to back you up.

298
00:43:11,643 --> 00:43:15,393
Damn me if Theodore, the bird -

299
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,601
-and our ungainly furry friend with
the rucksack haven't really go cracking!

300
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:24,601
Nuts and bolts, sprockets and spindles.

301
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,434
Skilled hands engaged in
precision lathe-work -

302
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:31,726
-on rotary hydrogenic valves.

303
00:43:31,893 --> 00:43:36,518
With one vigilant eye cocked on
the doings of willing helpers -

304
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:42,018
-who run unnecessary risks without
the protection of safety footwear.

305
00:44:00,643 --> 00:44:03,184
Work proceeds day and night.

306
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:08,184
Mysterious fluids seethe and bubble in
carboys, copper tubes and on hotplates.

307
00:44:08,351 --> 00:44:12,434
Theodore is experimenting
with all kinds of fuel -

308
00:44:12,601 --> 00:44:16,684
- and hand-made
thinly rolled body panels.

309
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:21,893
Behind dark goggles Theodore
is concocting a motorised carriage -

310
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:26,893
-that is going to prove a sensation
in the motor-racing world -

311
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:33,809
- with technical finesses which entail
radical innovations in the carburetion!

312
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:53,226
Straight down the lightning conductor!
Theodore has taken proper precautions -

313
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:57,601
-against natural catastrophes
and unforeseen punctures.

314
00:44:57,768 --> 00:45:02,393
Il Tempo Gigante features
special tyres, with steel reinforcement.

315
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:09,768
And seven layers of chicken netting
welded into West Indian rubber alloys.

316
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:38,934
When Theodore builds an engine,
he doesn't settle for a mere two-stroke.

317
00:45:39,101 --> 00:45:44,101
He has drilled 12 cylinders and
fitted them with concave linings -

318
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:48,351
- rammed in a whole heap of
high-tension ignition plugs -

319
00:45:48,518 --> 00:45:53,268
- linked to three-inch
hyper-polished exhaust manuals.

320
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:57,059
The finished product weighing 2.8 tons -

321
00:45:57,226 --> 00:46:02,934
-is impressive enough to shake any
major motor factory to its foundation.

322
00:46:31,643 --> 00:46:36,851
It takes a full year to knock out
a vehicle like Il Tempo Gigante.

323
00:46:39,393 --> 00:46:43,184
The day Theodore
completed the prototype, -

324
00:46:43,351 --> 00:46:48,226
-the Bristol seismograph registered
7,8 on the Richter scale.

325
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:52,851
Not a bad start for
a do-it-yourself village enthusiast.

326
00:46:54,184 --> 00:46:56,809
<i>Here's the late news.</i>

327
00:46:56,976 --> 00:47:02,768
<i>It has been confirmed that Il Tempo</i>
<i>Gigante is ready for its supreme test.</i>

328
00:47:02,934 --> 00:47:06,934
<i>People in Pinchcliffe</i>
<i>are confident that Rimspoke -</i>

329
00:47:07,101 --> 00:47:10,476
<i>- can show Gore-Slimey</i>
<i>a clean pair of heels.</i>

330
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:15,101
We shall see when the chips are down.

331
00:47:15,268 --> 00:47:17,309
Time will show!

332
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:28,393
Hi, you'll frighten them
out of their wits!

333
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:47,143
Sonny! Sonny!

334
00:48:52,476 --> 00:48:55,809
Who is it? Where is he?

335
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:59,476
I can hear something real horrible.

336
00:48:59,643 --> 00:49:03,893
There must be someone
outside snooping around.

337
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:08,976
Theodore, there's someone
snooping around at the dead of night.

338
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:15,309
I bet it's someone after your car.
I think we should hide in the cellar.

339
00:49:15,476 --> 00:49:18,559
What? In the cellar?

340
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:22,351
-Night-time intruders?
-Yes, I think there are people about.

341
00:49:22,518 --> 00:49:28,101
Our burglar alarm should deal with
car thieves, and it's all set up.

342
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:15,643
You go to the right, Sonny,
on the other side of the coach-house, -

343
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:18,768
- and I'll go this side.

344
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:26,143
-And you keep an eye on the door.
- I'm scared, I am, Theodore.

345
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:32,601
I never been so scared.
Never thought I would ever be so scared.

346
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:36,518
Hush, someone's coming!

347
00:51:48,393 --> 00:51:52,768
That's Mister Gore-Slimey
in the bag all right.

348
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:01,809
Well, string me up
and stuff me in a hen-coop!

349
00:52:01,976 --> 00:52:04,393
Gracious...

350
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,351
So it's you strung up
and dangling there, Lambert?

351
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:12,601
I walked slap into it!

352
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:27,976
That rope was intended for Rudolph,
so you'll have to forgive me, Lambert.

353
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:31,851
That put the skids on old Gore-Slimey.

354
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:31,518
Sir Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

355
00:53:31,684 --> 00:53:38,018
We are gathered together to unveil
Rimspoke's technical masterpiece -

356
00:53:38,184 --> 00:53:43,768
-which in tomorrows Grand Prix will
challenge the world's racing drivers -

357
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:49,393
-including Rudolph Gore-Slimey
in his 12-cylinder Boomerang Rapido.

358
00:53:55,726 --> 00:53:58,768
We're gratified
to have TV coverage today, -

359
00:53:58,934 --> 00:54:01,601
- in black and white
and in choice colours.

360
00:54:01,768 --> 00:54:07,601
<i>This event is being transmitted</i>
<i>via the Pinchcliffe TV control panel -</i>

361
00:54:07,768 --> 00:54:14,309
-designed by Theodore Rimspoke
and broadcast nationwide... full stop.

362
00:54:14,476 --> 00:54:21,768
To mark this auspicious occasion we
have invited one of our greatest brads.

363
00:54:21,934 --> 00:54:27,726
Despite an attack of the sniffles and
the handicap of a mane of unruly air -

364
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:32,934
- composed a laudatory epic:
Hanbury Dapplenag!

365
00:54:41,393 --> 00:54:46,643
Greetings,
mighty son of the desert waste

366
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:50,934
On whose oil-wells
your stupendous wealth is based

367
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:55,351
By whose presence
this ceremony is graced

368
00:54:55,518 --> 00:54:58,851
Our great inventor,
thanks to your banking account

369
00:54:59,018 --> 00:55:02,768
Was able to sting you
for a sizable amount

370
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:06,893
And so in this week-end's
great race we folk

371
00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:10,434
Can cheer on
our hero Theodore Rimspoke

372
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:17,851
Driving a very speedy vehicle which
Bears the name of my modest shanty:

373
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:24,351
The racing car Il Tempo Gigante!

374
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:36,809
Thank you, Dapplenag, and may
the Government grant your application -

375
00:55:36,976 --> 00:55:40,143
-for a three-year
Bardic Travelling Scholarship.

376
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:48,018
And now I shall ask Sheikh Abdul Ben
Bonanza to rise and be upstanding.

377
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:57,893
As funds from North Sea is not yet
available for projects such as these, -

378
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:04,434
-an overseas sheikh has
generously stepped into the breach.

379
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:08,351
This entitles him to the honour of
unveiling this super car.

380
00:56:08,518 --> 00:56:12,101
Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza,
she's all yours!

381
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:35,143
I must ask the audience to retain
your seats and your composure.

382
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:46,351
We have TV coverage, and Theodore
will now answer a few snaky questions.

383
00:56:46,518 --> 00:56:51,434
Today's news features Rimspoke's
sensational Il Tempo Gigante, -

384
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:57,851
-capable of challenging Gore-Slimey's
GT Super Boomerang Rapido.

385
00:56:58,018 --> 00:57:05,101
Congratulations on the car!
I must say, equipped with radar and all?

386
00:57:05,268 --> 00:57:08,893
That's right.
In the event of fog and landslides.

387
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:14,768
And to anticipate
any concealed entrances.

388
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:17,851
Could we have a rundown?

389
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:23,434
Let's start with the cranking handle,
which starts the engine up forward -

390
00:57:23,601 --> 00:57:26,809
-which in turn starts the carburettor -

391
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:30,809
-which finally activates
the rocket engine at the rear.

392
00:57:30,976 --> 00:57:35,018
-And then she really moves, eh?
-You could say that, yes.

393
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:37,309
And your top speed?

394
00:57:38,851 --> 00:57:43,684
With twelve cylinders
and pure alcohol fuel -

395
00:57:43,851 --> 00:57:46,684
-and a gaggle of rockets
raring to go, -

396
00:57:46,851 --> 00:57:51,768
-the old bus could hardly
be described as a slowcoach.

397
00:57:53,434 --> 00:57:59,268
This job is designed with
front- and rear-wheel drive -

398
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:04,768
-as well as
direct fuel injection slap in the jet -

399
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:09,143
-using the cantilever method.

400
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:13,559
And I've installed two speedometers -

401
00:58:13,726 --> 00:58:20,601
-serially linked so that one takes over
when the other registers maximum.

402
00:58:20,768 --> 00:58:27,476
-And then this rotary wind-gauge...
-And what about this brake-block?

403
00:58:27,643 --> 00:58:31,351
Same system as on a bike,
but reinforced.

404
00:58:31,518 --> 00:58:37,101
-And what's this device?
-That's blood type Rhesus B Plus.

405
00:58:37,268 --> 00:58:43,809
And Rhesus Minus, and a dash of blue
blood if we should bump into a baron.

406
00:58:43,976 --> 00:58:47,809
-Or some other aristocrats.
-Very smart.

407
00:58:47,976 --> 00:58:50,559
How about a look at the cockpit?

408
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:54,268
No. That wouldn't interest the public.

409
00:58:54,434 --> 00:58:57,393
-Top secret, maybe?
-Um...

410
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:02,393
Well, it only remains for me to wish
Rimspoke every success in the race.

411
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:07,018
And now back to our compère,
Dairy Manager Oliver Clapthwaite.

412
00:59:07,184 --> 00:59:09,934
Thanking you.

413
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:16,268
And now our local band
will conclude this ceremony -

414
00:59:16,434 --> 00:59:20,184
- with a specially composed march,
Cantata Opus Two, -

415
00:59:20,351 --> 00:59:24,059
- by pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.

416
00:59:24,226 --> 00:59:29,476
But first a special welcome to another
prominent visitor, Emanuel Desperados.

417
00:59:29,643 --> 00:59:35,643
Private chauffeur, born right round
the last bend of the Limpopo River.

418
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:41,726
He has kindly consented to assist
in the role of guest drummer.

419
01:02:55,309 --> 01:03:01,018
And now you can see Sheikh Abdul Ben
Bonanza arriving in his Rolls-Royce -

420
01:03:01,184 --> 01:03:04,184
- driven by Emanuel Desperados.

421
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:09,143
This great magnate
is the owner of Aladdin Oil.

422
01:03:09,309 --> 01:03:13,351
There's an air of excitement here as we
await the start of this epic encounter -

423
01:03:13,518 --> 01:03:16,393
-between the world's leading drivers.

424
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,559
Now here's No. 3 coming up to start.
The Italian Ruffino Gassolini, -

425
01:03:21,726 --> 01:03:26,601
-known as the Turin Daredevil,
in his Bertone Carabo.

426
01:03:28,143 --> 01:03:33,184
No. 12 is the German Heinrich von
Schnellfahrt, in his red Abarth 2000, -

427
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:38,393
-the celebrated speed-merchant
with glass-eye and monocle.

428
01:03:44,976 --> 01:03:49,809
Here's No. 5, the Swede
Ronny Turnip Anderson, -

429
01:03:49,976 --> 01:03:54,976
-the Gothenburg Gogetter, followed by
No. 8, the Argentine Carlos Fandango.

430
01:03:55,143 --> 01:04:00,226
The pampas playboy who ran slap into
a wall and escaped without a scratch.

431
01:04:00,393 --> 01:04:04,309
An impressive array of horsepower.

432
01:04:04,476 --> 01:04:10,684
There's one question of special interest
to fans: has Aladdin Oil acted wisely -

433
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:15,143
-in staking money and prestige
on a mere cycle-repairer?

434
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:18,351
<i>I imagine the people in Pinchcliffe -</i>

435
01:04:18,518 --> 01:04:23,476
<i>-will follow today's event with</i>
<i>special attention to their hero.</i>

436
01:04:23,643 --> 01:04:27,559
<i>Let's have a closer look</i>
<i>at Aladdin Oil.</i>

437
01:04:27,726 --> 01:04:31,393
<i>Rimspoke is just leaving the pits.</i>

438
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:38,518
<i>What competition can his home-made</i>
<i>design, Il Tempo Gigante, offer?</i>

439
01:04:38,684 --> 01:04:44,684
<i>It seems hardly likely that an</i>
<i>prototype built by a cycle-repairer -</i>

440
01:04:44,851 --> 01:04:50,518
<i>- will go the full 25 laps</i>
<i>of today's gruelling Grand Prix.</i>

441
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:57,059
But during yesterdays acceleration test
Il Tempo Gigante showed a speed -

442
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:02,393
-that ensured it
a surprisingly good starting position.

443
01:05:06,393 --> 01:05:13,559
In the Snake Oil pit the director of the
Dry Rot and Fungus Control Authority -

444
01:05:13,726 --> 01:05:20,809
-and ace driver Gore-Slimey is behind
the wheel of his Boomerang Rapido.

445
01:05:43,601 --> 01:05:47,934
Rudolph Gore-Slimey
has a string of victories in his car, -

446
01:05:48,101 --> 01:05:52,059
- with a great many hush-hush features.

447
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:57,518
Only a handful of intimates know what's
concealed beneath the black bonnet.

448
01:05:57,684 --> 01:06:02,268
His co-driver, in a cockpit designed on
Spitfire lines, is Eleaser Cassandra, -

449
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:07,768
- whose gift of second sight
has proved invaluable in a tight corner.

450
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:13,434
Less is known of Theodore Rimspoke's
co-driver, Sonny Duckworth.

451
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:18,434
Two novices to the track
that should be watched with interest.

452
01:06:18,601 --> 01:06:23,851
In 30 seconds from now this impressive
pack of speed-hungry roadsters -

453
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:29,518
- will be streaking across the line
in the Grand Prix of the Century.

454
01:06:43,101 --> 01:06:48,018
Five, four, three, two, one!

455
01:06:49,768 --> 01:06:56,143
They're off! The home-made contraption
already seems to be in trouble.

456
01:06:56,309 --> 01:07:01,393
This is bound to be a severe
disappointment to Aladdin Oil.

457
01:07:17,268 --> 01:07:22,268
The German Heinrich von Schnellfahrt
in his Abarth 2000 has taken the lead, -

458
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:27,184
-closely pursued by the Italian
Ruffino Gassolini and Gore-Slimey.

459
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:32,518
But now it looks like they've managed
to crank Il Tempo Gigante into action.

460
01:07:32,684 --> 01:07:38,309
She seems to be firing
on all twelve cylinders.

461
01:07:38,476 --> 01:07:43,684
She's off, and good luck to her.
She's got a lot of leeway to make up.

462
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:50,809
<i>Not a very encouraging start</i>
<i>for the good people of Pinchcliffe.</i>

463
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:11,559
It does really look as if Rimspoke
is putting his best foot forward.

464
01:08:11,726 --> 01:08:19,276
Gore-Slimey in the lead followed by
McQuick, the Swede and Gassolini.

465
01:08:44,059 --> 01:08:47,393
In a moment
they'll be completing the first lap.

466
01:08:47,559 --> 01:08:51,518
Gore-Slimey has been
passed by the Irishman McQuick.

467
01:08:51,684 --> 01:08:57,226
Here they come. Gore-Slimey
flashing past still in the lead.

468
01:08:57,393 --> 01:09:02,059
With nine laps to go, Rimspoke is
lagging 30 seconds behind the leaders.

469
01:09:02,226 --> 01:09:05,518
He has a lot of ground to make up.

470
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:09,726
And now the Argentine ace
Carlos Fandango goes into the lead.

471
01:09:17,309 --> 01:09:23,726
And now it looks as if Rimspoke really
has got his horsepower harnessed.

472
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:29,934
By my stopwatch he's pulled in as
much as 15 seconds on his first lap -

473
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:35,643
- which is sensational. We should
not write off Aladdin Oil's chances yet.

474
01:09:41,434 --> 01:09:47,518
Gore-Slimey once again in the lead with
Nos. 4, 12, 3, 8 and 5 in hot pursuit.

475
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:52,976
Followed by Rimspoke.
He must have put in a tremendous burst!

476
01:09:53,143 --> 01:09:57,976
Rimspoke's backers are clearly elated.

477
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:03,809
The wee chappie now facing the camera
is one of Rimspoke's rusty assistants.

478
01:10:03,976 --> 01:10:07,268
<i>No doubt his first visit</i>
<i>on a race-track.</i>

479
01:10:07,434 --> 01:10:11,684
<i>A popular feature</i>
<i>in this tough competition.</i>

480
01:10:11,851 --> 01:10:16,184
A message: Would the owner
of the car registered PP 14U2 -

481
01:10:16,351 --> 01:10:21,476
- parked on a manhole outside
Entrance C kindly remove his vehicle, -

482
01:10:21,643 --> 01:10:26,518
- as a Drainage and Water Board
inspector is anxious to return home.

483
01:10:27,934 --> 01:10:33,518
We are just coming up for another lap.
And Gore-Slimey is still in the lead.

484
01:10:40,268 --> 01:10:44,184
Amazing what Rimspoke
is getting out of his car.

485
01:10:44,351 --> 01:10:47,434
Can he really keep going?

486
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:17,518
Rimspoke has now rejoined the bunch,
and Schnellfahrt answers with a spurt.

487
01:11:17,684 --> 01:11:23,268
Rimspoke's giving all his got, but seems
to be having trouble with his engine.

488
01:11:23,434 --> 01:11:27,976
He's falling back.
But he's picking up again -

489
01:11:28,143 --> 01:11:33,226
- and is hot on the heels of
McQuick, Gassolini and Anderson.

490
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:56,809
Going into the hairpin bend
we get a ding-dong struggle -

491
01:11:56,976 --> 01:12:00,143
- between Schnellfahrt and Rimspoke.

492
01:12:00,309 --> 01:12:05,268
Out of the bend we have
Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke.

493
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:11,226
Rimspoke must have gone into a bit of a
skid. His car seems a bit stern-heavy.

494
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:36,518
There's a dramatic tussle going on,
with Gore-Slimey still in the lead.

495
01:12:56,976 --> 01:13:01,934
And there goes Rimspoke,
shooting into the lead. Aladdin Oil -

496
01:13:02,101 --> 01:13:05,059
- is leading in the Grand Prix!

497
01:13:27,893 --> 01:13:32,934
Il Tempo Gigante
passing the stands with a clear lead.

498
01:13:33,101 --> 01:13:36,226
But it sounds like she is misfiring?

499
01:13:36,393 --> 01:13:42,184
The subsequent order is Gore-Slimey,
Fandango, Schnellfahrt, Gassolini -

500
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:46,059
-and the Swede Turnip Anderson.

501
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:46,018
Rimspoke is clearly in trouble.
His engine is definitely labouring.

502
01:14:46,184 --> 01:14:50,559
Gore-Slimey
is coming up hand over first.

503
01:14:53,309 --> 01:14:57,101
Now he's passed him
and is in the lead again!

504
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:04,726
Things seem to be going disastrously
wrong for Rimspoke and Aladdin Oil.

505
01:15:04,893 --> 01:15:09,684
Rimspoke is being overhauled by
the rest of the field. My, what a pity.

506
01:15:09,851 --> 01:15:14,434
After such a splendid performance
by this unusual vehicle!

507
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:20,268
But that's the way things go!
Snake Oil first with the German second.

508
01:15:25,976 --> 01:15:31,643
Just behind these two comes Fandango.
The field's spreading out now.

509
01:15:31,809 --> 01:15:36,101
And here's the Swede leaving the pits
after a spot of trouble.

510
01:15:36,268 --> 01:15:41,559
But Il Tempo Gigante
is obviously in still greater trouble.

511
01:15:41,726 --> 01:15:46,934
She is being taken hand of
by her team of mechanics.

512
01:15:50,184 --> 01:15:57,226
Now the German seems to be making a
bid. Fandango breathing down his neck.

513
01:15:57,393 --> 01:16:02,393
The field seems to be massing
for a thrilling attack on the leaders.

514
01:16:27,809 --> 01:16:30,559
Rimspoke is really back in the race!

515
01:16:30,726 --> 01:16:35,476
Talk about a quick start! Nothing like
it since the Apollo went into orbit.

516
01:16:35,643 --> 01:16:40,768
Driver and co-driver must have been
subject to something like 3 G!

517
01:17:10,184 --> 01:17:14,809
Once again Rimspoke challenges the
cream of the world's racing drivers.

518
01:17:14,976 --> 01:17:18,726
This can develop into
something truly spectacular!

519
01:17:18,893 --> 01:17:24,976
Looks as if Aladdin Oil have called on
their second driver. What a gamble!

520
01:17:25,143 --> 01:17:31,601
Gassolini holding on to a slim lead,
closely followed by the others.

521
01:17:31,768 --> 01:17:35,976
What about Rimspoke
and his new second driver?

522
01:18:06,018 --> 01:18:10,268
It's obvious that Il Tempo Gigante
is now performing superbly.

523
01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:14,559
Rimspoke is closing in on the field.

524
01:18:14,726 --> 01:18:19,643
But Gore-Slimey
has pulled ahead and has a clear lead.

525
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:56,351
Gore-Slimey has a commanding lead,
and passes... there.

526
01:18:58,101 --> 01:19:03,601
The rest of the field is nicely bunched,
with the German in front.

527
01:19:03,768 --> 01:19:07,643
But Rimspoke is now only seven
seconds behind the German.

528
01:19:09,018 --> 01:19:14,434
Rimspoke, clearly full of go is only
15 seconds behind Gore-Slimey.

529
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:19,226
It's going to be hard
to predict the winner.

530
01:19:19,393 --> 01:19:25,226
Things are really hotting up.
The German is back in the lead -

531
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:28,893
-with the others
breathing down his neck.

532
01:19:29,059 --> 01:19:35,643
Il Tempo Gigante is putting on
a terrific spurt and catching up!

533
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:22,018
It's a neck-and-neck struggle between
Gore-Slimey and Theodore Rimspoke.

534
01:20:44,601 --> 01:20:47,559
Gore-Slimey
is just hanging on to his lead, -

535
01:20:47,726 --> 01:20:51,268
- but the others are hard on his heels.

536
01:20:59,476 --> 01:21:05,184
Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke are leaving
the rest of the field inexorably behind.

537
01:21:40,601 --> 01:21:45,601
Now what's happening?
Gore-Slimey pulls away.

538
01:21:45,768 --> 01:21:50,559
Rimspoke is in trouble, with Il Tempo
Gigante threatening to disintegrate.

539
01:21:50,726 --> 01:21:55,434
Gore-Slimey is starting on the last lap.
But where is Rimspoke?

540
01:21:55,601 --> 01:22:01,976
There! He seems to have got his engine
going full blast once again!

541
01:22:02,143 --> 01:22:08,393
<i>Gore-Slimey can't be sure of victory.</i>
<i>Both cars being squeezed to the limit.</i>

542
01:22:08,559 --> 01:22:15,226
<i>This is the last and decisive lap, and</i>
<i>a final maximum effort is called for.</i>

543
01:22:15,393 --> 01:22:20,476
<i>This speed must be a terrific strain</i>
<i>on chassis, engine, tyres, -</i>

544
01:22:20,643 --> 01:22:23,184
<i>-and the drivers themselves.</i>

545
01:23:31,684 --> 01:23:37,226
Here things are really getting dramatic.
Il Tempo Gigante is enveloped in smoke.

546
01:23:37,393 --> 01:23:40,768
Is she on fire?
A highly dramatic finish!

547
01:24:29,434 --> 01:24:34,268
Rimspoke comes out of the bend with
Gore-Slimey scraping his exhaust.

548
01:24:34,434 --> 01:24:39,851
He flashes across the line there!
Winner of the Grand Prix of the century!

549
01:24:40,018 --> 01:24:44,934
In third place the German, followed by
the Argentinean, Irishman and Italian.

550
01:24:45,101 --> 01:24:50,476
What a race, what a finish, and what a
triumph for our village cycle-repairer-

551
01:24:50,643 --> 01:24:55,851
-and a sheikh who staked his
reputation and money on his intuition.

552
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:09,643
We congratulate Pinchcliffe, the
native village of the three worthies -

553
01:25:09,809 --> 01:25:15,268
-who ensured Il Tempo Gigante
such a sensational triumph.

554
01:25:59,768 --> 01:26:03,643
The cup and the laurels
were just one more incident -

555
01:26:03,809 --> 01:26:06,726
-in the lives of Theodore,
Sonny, and Lambert.

556
01:26:06,893 --> 01:26:10,809
They'll be back at their daily chores
tomorrow, with petty quarrels, -

557
01:26:10,976 --> 01:26:16,518
-inventions and the manufacture
of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy.

558
01:26:16,684 --> 01:26:22,851
-Tonight you have the inside berth!
-Can I?

559
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:29,143
-Is that really possible?
-Take the inside when I tell you to!

560
01:26:34,226 --> 01:26:38,018
Goodness me!

561
01:26:40,434 --> 01:26:43,684
Snitchery pooh.

562
01:26:43,851 --> 01:26:46,684
-Nighty!
-Nighty!

563
01:27:17,018 --> 01:27:19,684
