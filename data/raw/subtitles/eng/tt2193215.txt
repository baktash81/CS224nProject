1
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,580
Are you awake?

2
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,790
No.

3
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,002
What time is it?

4
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,629
Two o'clock.

5
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,964
Almost two o'clock.

6
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,675
AM or PM?

7
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,512
You're not serious.

8
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,098
Not entirely.

9
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,645
It's afternoon.

10
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,146
I know.

11
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,440
What time is your flight?

12
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,484
7:40 to Amsterdam.

13
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,403
I haven't seen you for two weeks,

14
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:53,156
and you're leaving
again this evening?

15
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:56,826
I know. I'll be gone for
just a few days.

16
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,621
God, you're a sexy woman.

17
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,791
What are you doing?

18
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,292
I'm not doing anything.

19
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,629
They're going to take me
out of here on a gurney.

20
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,803
Tell me something sexy.

21
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:21,810
I want you to put
your hand up my dress.

22
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,271
But you're not
wearing a dress.

23
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:28,024
What does that
have to do with it?

24
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:32,028
It's something you
like for me to say.

25
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:36,574
I know. But it has to
be real, doesn't it?

26
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:42,539
Why don't you just tell me what it
is that you want me to do to you?

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,168
I want you to touch me.

28
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:50,213
You want me to
touch you where?

29
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:54,385
I want you to touch
me down there.

30
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:57,388
You do?

31
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:00,433
I really do.

32
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,229
Say it more sexy.

33
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:11,777
I want you to touch me.

34
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:17,116
Are you wet?

35
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,284
Yes.

36
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,328
You really are.
Yes.

37
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:23,581
God, you're sopping-

38
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:26,167
I know.

39
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:31,922
How did you get yourself
into such a state?

40
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,137
From thinking
about you.

41
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,265
From thinking about me, what?

42
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,603
From thinking about your
sweet face between my legs.

43
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,576
Wait, wait, wait.

44
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:03,747
I think I should go tidy up.

45
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:05,665
I don't want you to.

46
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:15,300
Slow, slow, slow.

47
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:23,141
How do you know
how to do that?

48
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:28,605
From hanging out
with really nasty girls.

49
00:04:36,988 --> 00:04:39,491
You've ruined me,
you know that?

50
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:41,660
I hope so.

51
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:49,084
God, you have the most luscious
pussy in all of Christendom.

52
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,377
Did you know that?

53
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,264
Tell me what to do.

54
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:07,770
You know what to do.

55
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:08,896
Tell me.

56
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:11,816
What if I shock you?

57
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,026
Too bad.

58
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:18,030
I want you to
finger-fuck me.

59
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:20,825
What?

60
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:23,661
You heard me.

61
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,622
I can't believe you said that.

62
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:28,082
Believe it

63
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:40,761
You're reached a whole new level
of depravity, haven't you?

64
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:48,102
I thought it didn't mean
that much to girls.

65
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:50,730
Depends on the girl.

66
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:56,861
I want you to stick
your finger up me,

67
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:59,865
and find my spot,
and push on it.

68
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:09,917
Oh, my God!

69
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:24,348
God, you are luscious.

70
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,231
Oh, my God!

71
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,851
Illegals!

72
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:36,187
Welcome to the United States.

73
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,554
Do you like it because it
reminds you of somewhere else?

74
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:12,057
That's not why I like it.

75
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,226
I like it for itself.

76
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:16,519
It doesn't have
to be like something else.

77
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,355
No.

78
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,982
Do I remind you
of someone else?

79
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,568
Yes, you do.

80
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,362
Someone you miss?

81
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:29,574
Someone who is dead.

82
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,745
I don't think I miss things.

83
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,749
I think to miss something is to
hope that it will come back.

84
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,043
But it's not coming back.

85
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:44,673
I've always known that
since I was a girl.

86
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,260
You don't think
that's a bit cold?

87
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:52,931
I think truth
has no temperature.

88
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:00,563
Mmm.

89
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,236
There it goes.

90
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:44,317
Follow me, please.

91
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,122
Good morning.

92
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:01,250
I want her to have something that

93
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:04,086
she won't be
uncomfortable wearing.

94
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:05,713
I don't want to give her
a diamond so big,

95
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:07,340
she'd be afraid to wear it.

96
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:11,594
She is probably more
courageous than you imagine.

97
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,559
Is this a pillow?

98
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,061
No, it's an Asscher.

99
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:20,812
Look at the corners.

100
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:23,607
Let's put it in
the grading box.

101
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:28,737
The pillow has a slight arc
to the sides.

102
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:32,074
It is a modern version
of the old-mine cut.

103
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,825
Let's look at the color.

104
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:35,702
Put it table-side down.

105
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:37,412
So you're looking
through the pavilion?

106
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,915
Yes, there's more
to look through.

107
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:49,216
it appears to be yellow.

108
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:51,551
It's nitrogen that
gives it the yellow.

109
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:55,639
The colors start with D.
A D-stone has no color.

110
00:13:58,475 --> 00:13:59,851
So, what am I looking at?

111
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,728
H.

112
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:03,021
Is that still a good color?

113
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,023
That's a very good color.

114
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,317
The truth is that
anything you can say

115
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:09,861
about the diamond is
in the nature of a flaw.

116
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:14,075
A perfect diamond would be
composed simply of light.

117
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,662
Do you see the inclusion?

118
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:20,164
No.

119
00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:23,584
It is small, what we
would call a feather.

120
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:27,046
Yes.

121
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,756
I think I see it.

122
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,468
So, it is graded what?

123
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:33,970
A VS1.

124
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:36,264
Some might grade it higher.

125
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:38,766
You might grade it higher.

126
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,104
You like this stone?

127
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:44,272
Oh.

128
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:46,023
I like that stone.

129
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,197
How many carats is it?

130
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:54,532
3.9.

131
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:55,658
It's expensive.

132
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,379
Tell me what you see.

133
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:11,048
Remember,
you're not looking for merit.

134
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,508
This is a cynical business.

135
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:15,052
We seek only imperfection.

136
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:18,432
This is a 5-carat stone.

137
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:21,477
Tell me what you see.

138
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:26,857
The culet seems big.

139
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,361
Crown and pavilion don't fit.

140
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,614
The girdle comes out crooked.

141
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,282
Very good.

142
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:41,663
But there is no
perfect diamond.

143
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,293
<i>"En este mundo nada es perfecto
as my father would say.</i>

144
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:48,337
You're Sephardic.

145
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,421
Yes.

146
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,798
Do you know Spain?

147
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:53,300
I do.

148
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:54,510
And Spain me.

149
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:58,055
At one time, I thought she
would return from the grave,

150
00:15:58,138 --> 00:16:00,390
but that is not to be.

151
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:06,021
Every country that has driven out the
Jews has suffered the same fate.

152
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:08,190
Which is?

153
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:12,110
You don't want to hear.

154
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:14,279
We should talk stones.

155
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:16,782
The most valued stone
is the red diamond

156
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:20,328
from the Argyle Mines,
so very rare.

157
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:24,749
I've seen two in a long life.
A prize almost beyond belief.

158
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:28,711
I do want to hear.

159
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:39,764
Well, I have to say,

160
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:45,061
there's no culture, save for
the Semitic culture, there.

161
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:49,983
The last known culture
before that was the Greek,

162
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:53,945
and there will be no
culture after, nothing.

163
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:56,906
That's a bold claim.

164
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,994
The heart of any culture is to be
found in the nature of the hero.

165
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,830
Who is that man
who is revered?

166
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:07,166
In the classical world,
it is the warrior,

167
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,920
but in the Western world,
it is the man of God.

168
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:16,134
From Moses to Christ,
the Prophet, the Penitent.

169
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:23,017
Such a figure was unknown to the
Greeks, unheard of, unimaginable.

170
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:29,023
Because there is only a man
of God, not a man of gods.

171
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:32,192
And this God is
the God of the Jewish people.

172
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:33,569
There is no other God.

173
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:37,323
We see him...
What is the word?

174
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:39,283
Purloined.

175
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:43,662
Purloined in the West.

176
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:48,125
How do you steal a God?

177
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,047
The Jew beholds
his tormentor dressed

178
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,176
in the vestments
of his own ancient culture.

179
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:00,262
Everything bears
a strange familiarity.

180
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:06,894
The fit is always poor, and the
hands are always dripping blood.

181
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:15,944
That coat? Didn't that
belong to Uncle Haim?

182
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,280
What about the shoes?

183
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:25,664
Enough. I see your look.
No more philosophy.

184
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:38,176
The stones themselves
have their own view of things.

185
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:43,056
Perhaps they are not
so silent as you think.

186
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,934
They were piped
up out of the earth

187
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,853
in a time before
any witness was.

188
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:53,191
But here they are.

189
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:55,902
Let me show you.

190
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:03,702
This is a cautionary stone.

191
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:09,749
Although, I suppose
every diamond is cautionary.

192
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,169
A cautionary diamond.

193
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:14,546
Of course, why not?

194
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:19,384
It's not a small thing to wish
for, however unattainable...

195
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:22,595
to aspire to the stone's
endless destiny.

196
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,599
Isn't that the meaning
of adornment?

197
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:28,728
To enhance the beauty
of the beloved...

198
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:30,938
is to acknowledge
both her frailty,

199
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:34,066
and the nobility
of that frailty.

200
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,526
We announce to the darkness...

201
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:39,697
that we will not be diminished
by the brevity of our lives.

202
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:45,911
That we will not
thereby be made less.

203
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,581
You will see.

204
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:08,434
Afternoon, sir.
Thank you.

205
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:10,603
Looking good, Counselor. Chris.

206
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,812
How you doing?

207
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:12,980
Good.

208
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:25,117
Where's Reiner?

209
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:26,787
He's in there.

210
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:40,967
You don't have
to worry about it.

211
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:42,135
Yeah,
but who paid for it?

212
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:45,180
I put the credit card down.
So, obviously, I paid for it.

213
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:46,890
You paid for it?
I don't care.

214
00:20:47,057 --> 00:20:48,141
But you like it?

215
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:50,227
I do like it.

216
00:20:50,393 --> 00:20:53,563
I've never been to Barbados. Are
all the ladies as sexy as you?

217
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:56,274
It's a steaming pit
of sexual abandon.

218
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,568
I don't believe you.

219
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:01,821
Well, it used to be.
I left.

220
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:05,659
Come in.

221
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:12,415
Good morning, Counselor.

222
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:15,085
Good morning.
Malkina.

223
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:16,962
<i>Hola, guapo.</i>

224
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,213
Hey.

225
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:21,716
How's Laura?
Incredible.

226
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:23,510
That sounds about right.

227
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:25,554
Nice lady,
nice lady.

228
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:28,933
I assume that she's not privy to
your newest business venture.

229
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,143
She's not.
And your lady?

230
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:32,353
Uh...

231
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:34,021
Yeah.

232
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,941
"Yeah," what?

233
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,194
I don't know what she knows.
I don't want to know.

234
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,280
You don't trust her?

235
00:21:42,363 --> 00:21:44,407
Jesus, Counselor.
She's a woman.

236
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:46,284
I don't mean to
sound that cold.

237
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,372
I just mean that, where men are
concerned, they've got their own agenda.

238
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:54,959
I always liked smart women. But it's
been an expensive hobby, you know?

239
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:56,294
Yeah.

240
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:59,880
Do you know what all that stuff is?
Uh...

241
00:22:00,214 --> 00:22:01,841
Mostly, yeah.

242
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,220
Anything I don't know, I can ask her.
Which worries me even more.

243
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:07,430
Hmm.

244
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:10,224
You never told
me what happened

245
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:11,684
with you and
the lovely Clarissa.

246
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:15,229
Ms. Clarissa of the
extraordinary body.

247
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:18,649
She used to go
around with no bra.

248
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:21,777
Those firm nipples in
her blouse or T-shirt.

249
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:27,867
I think in the end,
it was jealousy that undid us.

250
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,951
Jealousy?

251
00:22:29,076 --> 00:22:30,746
Yeah, she was getting
more pussy than I was.

252
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:33,582
Is that true?

253
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:36,293
I think so.
Probably, yeah.

254
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:41,340
I have to say that for
a girl who liked girls,

255
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:44,092
she took an extraordinary
interest in the male member.

256
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:48,639
She sucked on it so hard it
finally corrected my vision.

257
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:55,187
She left me for this
good-looking black woman.

258
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,355
Whoo.

259
00:22:56,438 --> 00:23:02,027
Had a boyfriend. Played for the Oilers.
Nice chap. Nice chap.

260
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,321
We met once for drinks
at this club in Dallas

261
00:23:04,404 --> 00:23:06,073
to discuss our mutual plight.

262
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:09,660
He was taking it rather
poorly, I have to say.

263
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,244
Women do better,
don't they?

264
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,705
Maybe they have
more practice at it.

265
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,833
Yeah, well, my guess
is that in most cases,

266
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,586
if you still have the woman
you're weeping over,

267
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,797
you'll be weeping harder.
Mm-hmm.

268
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,552
So, is this place secure?

269
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:28,720
Who knows?

270
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:31,223
I don't speak in arraignable
phrases anywhere.

271
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,893
There's a scrambler on
the phone, but still,

272
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:36,479
there's a lot of
smart people out there.

273
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:40,858
Of course, anybody who
thinks he's the smartest...

274
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,360
is on his way
to the slam.

275
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:44,070
Would that be me?

276
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:45,321
No, no.

277
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:47,824
Although, I have to
say that I always thought

278
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,368
a law degree was
a license to steal...

279
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:53,579
and that you, for one, hadn't
really capitalized on it.

280
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:56,582
You're not the straight dude
people think though, are you?

281
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:57,750
I guess not.

282
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:00,586
I don't mean the caper, I mean you.
Women like you.

283
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,130
All right.

284
00:24:02,213 --> 00:24:04,382
Do you know what
they like about you?

285
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:05,883
I'm a good fuck?

286
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:07,552
Right!

287
00:24:07,885 --> 00:24:11,347
No, they can sniff out
the moral dilemma.

288
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:13,057
The paradox.

289
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:14,559
"Moral dilemma. "

290
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:16,894
Yeah, they're drawn to it.
Not sure why.

291
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:20,148
Maybe it's just that lacking
any moral sense themselves...

292
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:22,692
they're fascinated
by it in men.

293
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:25,153
Men are attracted to flawed
women, too, of course...

294
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:27,280
but their illusion
is that they can fix them.

295
00:24:27,447 --> 00:24:28,781
Women don't want
to fix anything.

296
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:30,825
They only want
to be entertained.

297
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:32,452
The truth about
women is you can

298
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:34,495
do anything to them
except bore them.

299
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:36,582
Well...

300
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,835
there's nothing about Laura
that I would want to fix.

301
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,420
Maybe not.

302
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:43,046
Do you think she knows
things about me

303
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:44,631
that I don't
know about myself?

304
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,010
Jesus, Counselor, I'm not even sure
what sort of question that is.

305
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:49,928
Yeah.

306
00:24:52,556 --> 00:24:54,016
Okay.

307
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:03,817
If you pursue this road
that you've embarked upon...

308
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,987
you will eventually
come to moral decisions

309
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,073
that will take you
completely by surprise.

310
00:25:10,365 --> 00:25:11,825
You won't see
it coming at all.

311
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:15,871
I don't intend
to take this up as a trade.

312
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:18,415
Yeah, one-time deal, right?

313
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:20,000
Which you've heard
a thousand times.

314
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,461
No, but a few.

315
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:26,006
What usually happens is that
after a couple of deals...

316
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:29,301
they know more than you do and they
set up shop across the street.

317
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:30,677
And how does that
work out for them?

318
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:32,638
Not well.

319
00:25:32,805 --> 00:25:34,431
So, that would
be a moral issue.

320
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:36,225
Not for me.

321
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:38,019
Or for your associates.

322
00:25:38,895 --> 00:25:40,146
Yeah, well...

323
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,567
They have a real aversion to
mixing business with pleasure.

324
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:49,239
Do you know
what a bolito is?

325
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:51,282
No.

326
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,077
A bolo is one of those
skinny neckties...

327
00:25:54,244 --> 00:25:56,746
or one of those things
you throw in Argentina.

328
00:25:56,913 --> 00:25:58,623
Yeah, right.

329
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,961
No. In this case,
it's a mechanical device...

330
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,672
and it has this
small electric motor...

331
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:07,590
with this rather
incredible compound gear

332
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,384
that retrieves
a steel cable.

333
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:10,552
Battery-driven.

334
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:13,304
And the cable is made
out of some unholy alloy

335
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:14,806
almost impossible to cut it.

336
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:16,558
And it's in a loop.

337
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:20,812
And you come up behind the guy
and you drop it over his head...

338
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:23,773
and you pull the free end of
the cable tight and walk away.

339
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,108
No one ever even sees you.

340
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,151
And pulling the cable
activates the motor

341
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:28,987
and the noose
starts to tighten...

342
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:32,490
and it continues to tighten
until it goes to zero.

343
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,825
It cuts the guy's head off.

344
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,119
Yeah, well, it can.

345
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:37,328
There's nothing he can do.

346
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,538
No.

347
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,916
Jesus.

348
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,003
Yeah.

349
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,505
How long does it take?

350
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,965
Oh...

351
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,467
Three, four minutes,
five maybe.

352
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:52,177
It depends on
your collar size.

353
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:54,179
You're shitting me.

354
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,347
No,no,no.

355
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,349
It's just that
there's no easy way

356
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:59,852
to turn the thing off,
or reason to.

357
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:03,355
It just keeps running until the
noose closes completely and then...

358
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:04,565
it self-destructs.

359
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:07,901
Actually, you're probably dead
in less than a minute.

360
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,820
From strangulation?

361
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:11,322
No.

362
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:15,993
The wire cuts through
the carotid arteries...

363
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,621
and then sprays blood
all over the spectators...

364
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:20,080
and everybody goes home.

365
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,291
Sweet.

366
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,002
Yeah, sweet.

367
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:27,212
Think about it,
Counselor.

368
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,132
So where does all this
beheading shit come from?

369
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,759
You never used to see that.

370
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:34,386
I think it's blown
in here from the East.

371
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:35,804
Meaning the East?

372
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:36,847
Yeah.

373
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,308
You put nine Mexicans
and an Arab in a room,

374
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,103
and give them each $100,
and come back in a few hours,

375
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:43,980
who do you think is gonna
be holding the grand?

376
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,152
So you gearing up to do business
with them down the road?

377
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,403
The Arabs?
Yeah.

378
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:52,030
No, no.

379
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:53,907
Why's that?

380
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,451
Because they don't
need your money.

381
00:28:57,888 --> 00:29:00,057
Do you have a dog?

382
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:03,018
Do I have a dog?
Yes.

383
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:04,729
No, ma'am.
Oh.

384
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:06,731
I don't have a dog.

385
00:29:06,856 --> 00:29:08,023
Okay.

386
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:11,485
These are for me.

387
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:12,945
For you?

388
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:15,406
Yes, ma'am.
It's a diet.

389
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:16,907
A diet?

390
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:19,243
See, I probably shouldn't
even be telling you this.

391
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:20,578
I mean, I've tried
a couple of times,

392
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:22,663
and I gotta say,
it works pretty good.

393
00:29:22,747 --> 00:29:24,331
I mean,
you don't really eat.

394
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:28,002
When you get hungry, you just
pop a couple of these bad boys.

395
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:30,087
I carry a baggy full
around with me.

396
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:34,675
Last time,
I lost 27 pounds in 30 days.

397
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:37,762
I'd pretty much
recommend it to anybody.

398
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:41,599
These diets you read about.
I know this works.

399
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:44,393
I mean, but of course, like anything
else, you gotta use your head.

400
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:46,605
Time before,
I woke up in the hospital.

401
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:47,647
But you just gotta
keep your mind

402
00:29:47,731 --> 00:29:50,817
on your business
like anything else.

403
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:54,446
If you wanna lose weight,
this is it.

404
00:29:54,863 --> 00:29:58,241
After a few days, you don't
even want anything else.

405
00:29:58,742 --> 00:30:01,244
I'd absolutely
recommend it to anybody.

406
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:03,914
But you said you
woke up in the hospital.

407
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:08,043
What happened? Did you get a
systemic reaction or what?

408
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:12,005
No, ma'am, it wasn't
anything like that.

409
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:16,551
I was sitting in the street licking
my balls, and a car hit me.

410
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,560
Take care now.
You hear?

411
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:21,868
What?

412
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:22,994
Yeah? Well, too bad.

413
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:47,768
Here you go, ma'am.

414
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:51,773
Thank you.

415
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:55,277
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.

416
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:07,289
I have something to
discuss with you...

417
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:09,833
and I'm a bit scared.

418
00:32:10,584 --> 00:32:11,668
Hmm.

419
00:32:13,337 --> 00:32:14,504
Have you been bad?

420
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:16,340
No.

421
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:23,347
Actually, I don't have that
much to discuss, so...

422
00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:30,812
let me just give you this...

423
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:34,191
and tell me what you think.

424
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:50,165
Will you?

425
00:32:57,423 --> 00:33:00,051
Don't leave me hanging, here.

426
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:03,221
Yes, I will!

427
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:17,902
Try it.

428
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,250
What, you didn't know?

429
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:35,920
I knew...

430
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:38,214
but I was scared anyway.

431
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,342
That's good.

432
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:45,054
It's so beautiful.

433
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:49,267
You are a glory.

434
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:53,229
I'm a glory?

435
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:54,940
Yes.

436
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:59,027
As in "glorious. "
You're a glorious woman.

437
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:04,283
And you're a man
of impeccable taste.

438
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:07,578
Sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

439
00:34:08,537 --> 00:34:10,414
You can't take it back.

440
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:12,249
Here.

441
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:18,714
I intend to love you until I die.

442
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,300
Me first.

443
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,260
Not on your life.

444
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:45,574
That's a nice ring.
How many carats is it?

445
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:46,825
I don't know.

446
00:34:46,992 --> 00:34:48,660
You don't know?

447
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:49,828
No.

448
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:51,330
You've gotta be kidding me.

449
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:52,581
No, I don't know.

450
00:34:52,748 --> 00:34:53,957
Let me see it.

451
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,586
No, take it off.

452
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:03,885
Hmm.

453
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:07,138
It's a 3.5 carat.
Maybe 3.8.

454
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:10,016
It's a nice stone.
It's Asscher cut.

455
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:11,184
Thank you.

456
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:12,352
Good color.

457
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,979
Probably an F, or a G.

458
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:19,692
Nothing visible,
so at least a VS2.

459
00:35:20,693 --> 00:35:21,778
Wanna know how much
it's worth?

460
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:23,029
No.

461
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:27,534
You really don't, do you?

462
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,285
I really don't.

463
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,039
So, have you set a date?

464
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:34,624
Not yet.

465
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:38,628
I really want to get married in the Church.
And he's okay with that.

466
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:42,215
He was married before, so I
thought that would be a problem.

467
00:35:42,382 --> 00:35:45,552
But the Church doesn't recognize
other marriages, so...

468
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:47,345
Are you nervous?

469
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,513
A little bit.

470
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,682
Sometimes I am.

471
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,226
So, you're a church lady?

472
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:57,355
I go.
It's important to me.

473
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,733
And what about confession?

474
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:01,318
Yeah.

475
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:02,987
Well, maybe not so much.

476
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,157
Does the priest
ever ask you about sex?

477
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:11,537
He doesn't ask, but you're
supposed to tell him everything.

478
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:12,997
And all the nasty shit you did...

479
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,665
you're just supposed
to pretend like

480
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,375
you're never gonna
do it again, right?

481
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:18,586
I guess.

482
00:36:18,752 --> 00:36:20,087
Strange.

483
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:28,762
And suppose you've done
something really nasty?

484
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:31,515
He doesn't press you
for the details?

485
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:37,062
I don't think so.

486
00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:40,774
You're blushing.

487
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:41,609
Uh-uh.

488
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:45,362
Okay, we can change
the subject.

489
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:47,615
We'll talk about my sex life.

490
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:50,618
You're teasing.

491
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:54,747
Just rattling your cage.

492
00:36:59,126 --> 00:37:01,046
What a world.

493
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:07,886
Do you think
the world is strange?

494
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:14,184
I meant yours.

495
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:20,482
<i>- Hello?
- Reiner, are you there?</i>

496
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:21,816
<i>Counselor.</i>

497
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:23,276
I think I'm in.

498
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:26,488
<i>You can't think, Counselor.
You're in or you're out.</i>

499
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:29,324
All right, I'm in.
And thanks.

500
00:37:29,616 --> 00:37:31,409
Don't thank me yet.

501
00:37:31,576 --> 00:37:34,579
I won't say, "I hope you know what
you're doing" because you don't.

502
00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:37,958
<i>But, money problems
are serious problems.</i>

503
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:40,627
<i>You keep telling yourself it's
not as bad as it appears...</i>

504
00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:42,671
and then one morning,
you realize it's worse.

505
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:43,880
<i>Am I close?</i>

506
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:46,091
My back is against
the fucking wall, man.

507
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,510
I believe you.

508
00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:52,097
Do you have the cash?

509
00:37:52,263 --> 00:37:54,015
I'll have it Thursday.

510
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:55,183
<i>All right.</i>

511
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,852
I'll call Westray
and set it up.

512
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:15,204
Counselor.
Westray.

513
00:38:15,371 --> 00:38:16,872
It's not dark
enough in here for you?

514
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:20,751
Wow.

515
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,212
That's a dandy.
What happened?

516
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:25,006
Confrontation with a doorman.

517
00:38:25,214 --> 00:38:26,632
"Confrontation"?

518
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:28,968
Jesus.
What did you say to him?

519
00:38:29,135 --> 00:38:31,554
I think I told him that he was
not to take it personally...

520
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:32,847
but he should go fuck himself.

521
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:34,306
What did he say to that?

522
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:36,726
He said, "I'm gonna hurt
you, white person. "

523
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:37,977
What will you have?

524
00:38:38,227 --> 00:38:39,395
I'll have a Heineken.

525
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:40,730
Make it two.

526
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,066
I didn't know you
got into donnybrooks.

527
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:45,234
I don't.

528
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,902
Anyway, it was
in another country.

529
00:38:48,362 --> 00:38:51,240
And besides,
the wretch is dead.

530
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:55,661
No, but I sent a pair of reliable
chaps to speak with him.

531
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:57,580
Bloody expensive, too.

532
00:38:57,747 --> 00:38:58,748
You surprise me.

533
00:38:58,914 --> 00:39:01,042
Counselor,
I'm just a middle man.

534
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,086
I know the smallest
crumb can devour us.

535
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:09,259
You learn not to let anything pass.
You can't afford to.

536
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:10,886
I should keep that in mind.

537
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:14,056
You might keep that in mind.
So, fire away.

538
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:17,517
All right.
What do you do with the money?

539
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:19,269
What do I do,
or what does one do?

540
00:39:19,436 --> 00:39:20,437
What do you do?

541
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:23,398
Mine goes offshore.

542
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:25,734
We can talk about it if you like,
but you can't use my people.

543
00:39:26,526 --> 00:39:27,527
All right.

544
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,863
Okay.
Let me make a call.

545
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,031
All right.

546
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:33,033
What else?

547
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,451
You seem unsettled.

548
00:39:34,785 --> 00:39:36,286
I'm all right.

549
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:38,455
Uh...

550
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:40,123
What's the buy-out
for this whole deal?

551
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,917
Net net?

552
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:44,419
Yeah. Net net.

553
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:45,879
It's hard to put
a cold dollar on it.

554
00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:48,090
You don't know what your
expenses are up front.

555
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:52,427
It's 625 kilos, goes for about
$50 an ounce in Colombia.

556
00:39:52,594 --> 00:39:55,764
And the street value in Dallas
can go as high as two grand.

557
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:57,307
Is that where it's going?
Dallas?

558
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:59,601
No, it's going to Chicago.
Don't write that down.

559
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:01,728
We're probably
looking at 20 million.

560
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:03,897
Maybe a little more.

561
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:06,734
It's 21,900 ounces.

562
00:40:07,944 --> 00:40:09,821
Good return on
your investment.

563
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:11,322
Did you do that in your head?

564
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:13,241
No, I remembered it.

565
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:16,619
But I know someone who could
do that in their head.

566
00:40:17,453 --> 00:40:19,330
I'll bet you're right.

567
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:23,918
If you're not in,
you need to tell me.

568
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:26,003
I'm all right.

569
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:34,762
It's just not our people.
You got the money guys.

570
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:38,558
You gotta get money in dollars into
Mexico, and you gotta get it out.

571
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:40,977
To do that,
you need a corporation.

572
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,520
You can't go
through the US banks.

573
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,274
And even then, you have to
have someone on the inside.

574
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:47,692
You'd be surprised
at the people

575
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:50,528
who are in this business,
very surprised.

576
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:54,782
You have a corporation?

577
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:58,286
No, of course not.
You just pay the points.

578
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,788
The other option
is cash, of course.

579
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:04,667
That's an even bigger headache
for all the obvious reasons.

580
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,712
The biggest issue is not that your guy
is gonna fall for some pole dancer

581
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:09,756
and go south with a
million of your duckets.

582
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,966
The biggest issue
is someone is gonna

583
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:12,926
figure out who he is
and what he's up to.

584
00:41:13,385 --> 00:41:14,761
Here we go.

585
00:41:23,562 --> 00:41:24,563
No, you're good.

586
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,731
Thank you.

587
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:27,566
Well, cheers.

588
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:31,028
A plague of pustulant boils
upon all their scurvid asses.

589
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:32,779
Is that your normal toast?

590
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:34,448
Increasingly.

591
00:41:37,576 --> 00:41:40,120
So, if the drug wars stop...

592
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:41,580
this will dry up, right?

593
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:43,248
Let's just say,
it will be more than risky.

594
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:46,627
That's the thing
Reiner doesn't seem to get.

595
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:49,004
You may have
noticed his lifestyle

596
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:51,465
has become
increasingly lavish.

597
00:41:52,132 --> 00:41:53,467
I've noticed.

598
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:56,762
I don't set foot in his clubs.
And I miss the bastard.

599
00:41:56,929 --> 00:42:00,974
We used to share
a taste for exotic women.

600
00:42:01,141 --> 00:42:03,727
In fact, a few times
shared the women themselves.

601
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:06,146
That wouldn't include the
present one, would it?

602
00:42:07,814 --> 00:42:09,942
Now,
why would you ask me that?

603
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:12,487
No reason. Sorry.

604
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:16,115
The answer is no, of course.
The civil answer.

605
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:18,660
Butlsee a murky picture forming
in that mind of yours.

606
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:21,454
How well do you
know Malkina?

607
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,748
Not very well. Why?

608
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,502
Because you don't know someone
until you know what they want...

609
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:28,795
is why.

610
00:42:29,837 --> 00:42:31,297
I'll try and remember that.

611
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:32,966
Good.

612
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,803
And Reiner?

613
00:42:36,928 --> 00:42:37,929
Reiner.

614
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:40,640
Reiner is beyond advising.

615
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,309
Reiner thinks
nothing bad can happen.

616
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:45,812
And he's in love.

617
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:47,814
You two are going
to open a new club?

618
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:49,649
Is that all right?

619
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:51,943
Sure. Why not?
What the fuck.

620
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,948
Do you know how many people were
killed in JuÃ¡rez last year?

621
00:42:57,448 --> 00:42:58,825
No. A lot.

622
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:02,120
Yeah.
I think 3,000 is a lot.

623
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:05,206
This is a different species,
Counselor.

624
00:43:05,373 --> 00:43:07,875
They will rip out your liver
and feed it to your dog.

625
00:43:08,376 --> 00:43:10,753
Jesus, Westray.

626
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:13,048
Let me ask you. Who do you think
killed all those young girls

627
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,592
before
the so-called drug wars?

628
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,095
I don't know. Nobody knows.

629
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,263
"Nobody knows"?

630
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,472
No.

631
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,434
Come on, Counselor.
Hundreds of girls,

632
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,437
thousands, most likely.
Follow the money.

633
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,149
If you have so much cash that you're
insulating your house with it,

634
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,151
and you've bought all the
clothes, and the cars,

635
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,111
and the guns you can
find a place to put,

636
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,823
and you're morally depraved
beyond all human recognition,

637
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,700
what then do you
do with your money?

638
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,036
Why do they kill them?

639
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:48,292
Who knows? Fun, snuff films. You'll
see those will start turning up.

640
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,294
Anyway, what do you
do with a 15-year-old

641
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,630
you just ravaged in
some heinous manner?

642
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,134
Do you think the drug lords
hired kidnappers

643
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,178
to keep them supplied
with young girls?

644
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:02,723
I think they have kidnappers
on full retainer.

645
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,686
I should keep
that in mind, too.

646
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,731
I can't advise you, Counselor.

647
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,609
But you are advising me.

648
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,156
I just need you to be sure
that you're locked in.

649
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,451
Because I don't know...

650
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:26,581
Maybe I should tell you what Mickey
Rourke told what's-his-face.

651
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:29,918
That's my recommendation anyway,
Counselor. Don't do it.

652
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,587
"This arson is
a serious crime. "

653
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:35,423
Yeah. And so is this.

654
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,179
I guess I'm a little
taken aback at the

655
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,848
cautionary nature
of this conversation.

656
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,935
Good word,
"cautionary. "

657
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:48,978
In Scots law, it defines
an instrument in which

658
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,980
one person stands as
surety for another.

659
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,149
As surety.
Yes.

660
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,776
Sounds a bit primitive.

661
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:55,985
It is.

662
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,153
The problem being,
of course...

663
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:01,825
is what happens when the surety
becomes the more attractive holding?

664
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,035
What about you?

665
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:07,872
I can vanish in a heartbeat
with my money. Can you?

666
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:13,670
Truth is, Counselor, I can walk
away from all of this in a second.

667
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:15,630
And I mean all of it.

668
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,509
You're not gonna believe this, but
I'm going to tell you anyway.

669
00:45:18,676 --> 00:45:20,469
I think about my life.

670
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:22,555
I can live in a monastery.

671
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:26,684
Scrub the steps, clean the
pots, try some gardening.

672
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:29,562
You're serious.

673
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,147
Very.

674
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:32,731
Why don't you?

675
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:36,360
In a word? Women.

676
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:44,910
I've seen it all, Counselor.

677
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:48,706
It's all shit.
It's all shit.

678
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,667
I'll be in touch.

679
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:55,421
Hey, Counselor?

680
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,923
You want to know why Jesus
wasn't born in Mexico?

681
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,258
No, Why?

682
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:02,344
Couldn't find three wise men
or a virgin.

683
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:09,393
And, Counselor, here's
something else to consider.

684
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,688
The beheadings and the mutilations?
That's just business.

685
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:15,024
You gotta keep up appearances.

686
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:18,277
It's not like there's some
smoldering rage at the bottom of it.

687
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:21,615
Let's see if we can guess who
it is they really want to kill.

688
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:23,200
I don't know.
Who?

689
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,868
You, Counselor.

690
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:26,870
You.

691
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:54,648
Hey.

692
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:56,733
Did you bring cigarettes?

693
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,834
They treating you well?

694
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:16,920
Oh, yeah.
Peachy.

695
00:47:22,802 --> 00:47:24,887
You've got a preliminary
hearing on the 17th.

696
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:28,808
What size dress do you wear?

697
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,601
I wear a five.

698
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:32,979
What about shoes?

699
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:36,023
Five?

700
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,275
Yeah.

701
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,110
Hat?

702
00:47:39,277 --> 00:47:40,444
What?

703
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:41,862
What size hat?

704
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,281
A hat?

705
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:46,075
I don't know
what size hat.

706
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:48,160
What the fuck do
I need a hat for?

707
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:52,164
A hat?
You're shitting me.

708
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:53,583
Yes.

709
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:57,211
You're a smartass.

710
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:00,298
You had me going
there for a minute.

711
00:48:03,092 --> 00:48:06,095
So, you gonna get me
something sexy to wear?

712
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:07,388
No.

713
00:48:08,556 --> 00:48:11,100
You'll probably have me looking
like a fucking schoolmarm.

714
00:48:12,393 --> 00:48:13,769
How about a businesswoman?

715
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:16,272
Yeah. Some business.

716
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:17,481
All right.

717
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,567
What was it you
wanted to tell me?

718
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:23,363
My kid is in jail.

719
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:25,574
Oh, boy.

720
00:48:26,158 --> 00:48:27,200
Where?

721
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:29,578
Fort Hancock.

722
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,248
What was he doing
in Fort Hancock?

723
00:48:34,124 --> 00:48:36,001
He was coming to see me.

724
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:38,211
What's he in jail for?

725
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,546
Speeding.

726
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:41,048
Speeding?
Yeah.

727
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,677
Son of a bitch.

728
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:47,846
What,
he couldn't pay the fine?

729
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:53,143
He had $12,000 on him,
but they took that off him.

730
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:56,229
How did you find this out?

731
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,398
He called.

732
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:01,318
What else is he charged with?

733
00:49:01,943 --> 00:49:03,362
I don't know.

734
00:49:04,112 --> 00:49:06,156
Some other stuff.

735
00:49:06,698 --> 00:49:08,367
And how fast was he going?

736
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,202
206.

737
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:13,747
206.
Yeah.

738
00:49:14,706 --> 00:49:17,042
What is that, "206"?

739
00:49:18,043 --> 00:49:20,045
That's not a speed.

740
00:49:20,587 --> 00:49:24,216
That's somebody's weight,
or a time of day.

741
00:49:24,383 --> 00:49:28,012
You're telling me he was going
206 miles an hour? In what?

742
00:49:28,596 --> 00:49:30,640
On that Jap bike of his.

743
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,893
Listen, if you could get
his money back...

744
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,396
he could pay the fine
and get out of there.

745
00:49:36,562 --> 00:49:38,773
He's not getting
his money back.

746
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:41,442
How much is the fine?

747
00:49:41,943 --> 00:49:43,111
$400.

748
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:44,612
Jesus.

749
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,865
I don't guess you
would spring for it.

750
00:49:48,616 --> 00:49:50,118
Christ, $400?

751
00:49:50,952 --> 00:49:52,286
Yeah.

752
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:55,873
All right.

753
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:57,583
"All right" what?

754
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:59,961
All right, I'll get him out.

755
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,296
Thanks. I owe you.

756
00:50:02,797 --> 00:50:04,549
Yes, you do.

757
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:07,301
How about a blowjob?

758
00:50:10,096 --> 00:50:11,764
You would still owe me $380.

759
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:15,226
Damn,
but you are a smartass.

760
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:18,896
I know.
You bring it out in me.

761
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,153
Lighten up, Ruthie.

762
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:26,529
Don't call me that.

763
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,116
I hate that name.

764
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:31,994
I don't even like "Ruth. "

765
00:50:40,252 --> 00:50:42,171
Take care, Ruth.

766
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,214
Guard.

767
00:50:53,432 --> 00:50:55,017
Pull over.

768
00:51:10,657 --> 00:51:11,742
How are you doing?

769
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,456
Get this thing out of here.

770
00:51:18,123 --> 00:51:19,082
You got it.

771
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:20,209
Go.

772
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:50,551
Sorry.
I got held up.

773
00:52:53,345 --> 00:52:54,388
How are you, man?

774
00:52:54,597 --> 00:52:58,350
You see a place like this in the cold
light of day, it looks pretty seedy.

775
00:52:58,517 --> 00:52:59,894
But you get the right lighting
in here...

776
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,187
and some music,
some good-looking girls...

777
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:03,439
and it's a whole other world.

778
00:53:03,606 --> 00:53:04,607
Jesus.

779
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,191
We're looking
for cash flow here.

780
00:53:08,944 --> 00:53:11,405
So, how soon do you think?

781
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:13,574
Two weeks.
Three, max.

782
00:53:14,783 --> 00:53:16,118
Yeah.

783
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:18,412
Are you gonna
keep the dance floor?

784
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:20,122
Yeah. A dance floor takes
up a lot of space...

785
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:23,042
but you try and chat
up a girl at a bar...

786
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,210
she's supposed to
tell you to fuck off.

787
00:53:25,377 --> 00:53:27,254
She doesn't want to
look like a bitch.

788
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:29,965
But, you ask a chick to dance...

789
00:53:31,634 --> 00:53:33,636
well, you got a better shot.

790
00:53:34,804 --> 00:53:35,972
You know Peterson, right?

791
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:37,307
Sure.

792
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:38,767
Yeah, do you know
he speaks Portuguese?

793
00:53:38,892 --> 00:53:40,226
No.

794
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:43,229
Yeah, his family was from Brazil.

795
00:53:43,313 --> 00:53:48,360
So this cousin of
Peterson shows up,

796
00:53:48,443 --> 00:53:51,279
and we are all out
here on Saturday night.

797
00:53:51,363 --> 00:53:54,199
And the cousin is
asking Peterson,

798
00:53:54,324 --> 00:53:57,160
"How do you say,
'May I have this dance?"'

799
00:53:57,243 --> 00:53:59,037
Only we get wind of it.

800
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,624
And we shut Peterson up and we are
coaching him on how to say it.

801
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:07,879
Repeat after me, "I want
to eat your pussy. " Right?

802
00:54:08,421 --> 00:54:11,132
And we work with him till
he's pretty much got it down.

803
00:54:11,216 --> 00:54:15,679
"I want to eat your pussy. "
And we send him off.

804
00:54:15,762 --> 00:54:18,181
He's this kind of
elegant-looking guy anyway.

805
00:54:18,264 --> 00:54:23,061
So he goes off
across the room,

806
00:54:23,144 --> 00:54:25,855
and he picks out this really,
really great-looking girl.

807
00:54:25,939 --> 00:54:31,111
And he stands in front of her, gives
her this little bow, and says,

808
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:33,989
"I want to eat your pussy. "

809
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:36,158
And of course,
the table gets pretty quiet,

810
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:38,703
and the girl looks up at him
and says, "What did you say?"

811
00:54:38,786 --> 00:54:41,998
And he says it again. A little
bow, "I want to eat your pussy. "

812
00:54:42,873 --> 00:54:45,292
And she stares at him
for a minute

813
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:48,671
and then looks
over to see past him,

814
00:54:48,754 --> 00:54:52,299
and of course, hears these
three guys across the room

815
00:54:52,383 --> 00:54:56,637
all hugging each other and just
weeping, weeping with merriment.

816
00:54:56,721 --> 00:55:01,559
So she gets up, and she takes
Peterson's cousin by the hand,

817
00:55:01,642 --> 00:55:03,644
and she takes him out
to this van in the parking lot

818
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:06,147
and proceeds to
fuck his brains out.

819
00:55:06,731 --> 00:55:10,651
He's gone for an hour. We don't
know what the hell is going on.

820
00:55:10,735 --> 00:55:13,029
And finally,
she leads him back in,

821
00:55:13,154 --> 00:55:15,406
and gives him
this big, sexy kiss,

822
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:18,325
and she looks over at us to
make sure we're all watching,

823
00:55:18,409 --> 00:55:19,702
and sends him
back to the table.

824
00:55:19,785 --> 00:55:21,746
Well, we're going nuts, nuts.

825
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:23,622
Peterson is trying to get
the story out of him,

826
00:55:23,706 --> 00:55:25,541
and he's jabbering away,

827
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:28,377
and we're like, "What's he saying?
What's he saying?"

828
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:34,443
It's the whole thing. It's blowjob.
It's the works, the works.

829
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:37,511
Jesus, we're just
fucking flabbergasted.

830
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:42,726
And we are just sitting there
staring at each other.

831
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:45,645
And after a while,
Peterson gets up

832
00:55:45,771 --> 00:55:48,648
and looks at us,
and off he goes.

833
00:55:48,732 --> 00:55:51,568
He crosses the floor
to where this

834
00:55:51,693 --> 00:55:54,529
cool-looking girl is
sitting by herself.

835
00:55:54,613 --> 00:55:57,574
And he gives her a little bow

836
00:55:57,657 --> 00:55:59,701
and announces that he
wants to eat her pussy.

837
00:55:59,785 --> 00:56:00,786
Well, of course.

838
00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:04,998
Well, this time, the husband is
coming out of the men's room.

839
00:56:05,082 --> 00:56:08,627
And he's about,
I don't know, 11 feet tall.

840
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:12,380
This guy hit him so hard that
he came out of his loafers.

841
00:56:12,464 --> 00:56:14,132
He came out of his loafers.

842
00:56:15,189 --> 00:56:19,981
So Peterson is lying dead on the
dance floor in his socked feet...

843
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:23,975
Anyway,
they called an ambulance,

844
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:26,394
and they hauled Peterson
off to the hospital,

845
00:56:26,478 --> 00:56:28,939
and he's got a concussion
and a broken jaw.

846
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:31,441
Jesus.
Yeah.

847
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:32,651
What did you guys do?

848
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:33,902
Nothing. We left.

849
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:35,904
We had enough fun
for one evening.

850
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:39,866
Anyway, the other big
space-eater is the bandstand.

851
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:43,037
I think what I'm gonna do
is take the wall out...

852
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:46,499
and get rid of the hallway,
yeah.

853
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:47,750
I think that Will do it.

854
00:56:47,917 --> 00:56:49,627
Yeah. All right.

855
00:56:50,002 --> 00:56:53,422
I'll talk to my guy and it
should take two or three days.

856
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:54,841
That's my boy.

857
00:57:14,861 --> 00:57:16,320
There he is.

858
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:20,199
I won't be able to get what the
kid is saying. Is that okay?

859
00:57:20,783 --> 00:57:23,578
We don't care what
the kid is saying.

860
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:28,082
Did you get it?

861
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:31,335
Yeah. It's not much.

862
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:33,838
That's okay.

863
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,465
Keep your eye on him.

864
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:37,633
I am.

865
00:57:37,717 --> 00:57:39,510
This guy doesn't read
the fucking newspapers.

866
00:57:40,469 --> 00:57:41,470
I know.

867
00:57:42,054 --> 00:57:44,016
Could you see what it was?

868
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:47,561
Nope.
But it's in the helmet.

869
00:57:48,478 --> 00:57:50,063
Yeah.

870
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,690
It's in the helmet.

871
00:58:02,576 --> 00:58:04,494
<i>Yes?
We got him.</i>

872
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:08,665
<i>Good. Stay with him,
and call me back in an hour.</i>

873
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:24,848
Come here.

874
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,978
Well, Counselor,
how are you making it?

875
00:58:30,979 --> 00:58:31,980
I'm all right.

876
00:58:32,689 --> 00:58:33,732
Is this your lady?

877
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,859
It is.

878
00:58:35,943 --> 00:58:36,985
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

879
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:38,820
Me and the Counselor
go back a ways.

880
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:40,489
We do, I'm afraid.

881
00:58:40,656 --> 00:58:41,740
Don't be afraid.

882
00:58:41,823 --> 00:58:43,283
Hell, I'm okay with everything.

883
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:44,827
Are you okay with everything,
Counselor?

884
00:58:47,372 --> 00:58:48,539
I am if you are.

885
00:58:48,748 --> 00:58:50,959
See, now, ain't he just
the best son of a bitch?

886
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,460
All right, Tony, let's go.

887
00:58:52,627 --> 00:58:54,295
How long have you known
this guy, petunia?

888
00:58:54,462 --> 00:58:56,210
- Long enough.
- Long enough.

889
00:58:56,756 --> 00:58:58,508
Maybe you should listen
to your lady friend.

890
00:58:58,675 --> 00:58:59,801
Is that what you do, Counselor?

891
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:00,885
Pretty much.

892
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:02,053
Does he keep you entertained?

893
00:59:02,971 --> 00:59:03,972
None of your business.

894
00:59:04,138 --> 00:59:06,015
Because you look to me
like you might get bored easy.

895
00:59:06,182 --> 00:59:07,517
Tony, let's go.

896
00:59:08,226 --> 00:59:09,227
Tony, I'm leaving.

897
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,104
Hell, Counselor, keep your seat.

898
00:59:11,688 --> 00:59:13,106
You don't have
to get up for me.

899
00:59:13,273 --> 00:59:16,109
See, petunia, the Counselor has a
way of sullin' up like a possum...

900
00:59:16,276 --> 00:59:17,568
when he don't get his own way.

901
00:59:17,735 --> 00:59:19,612
I'm going to say
you probably noticed it.

902
00:59:20,154 --> 00:59:22,115
But that ain't
really the problem.

903
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:23,574
The real problem is...

904
00:59:23,741 --> 00:59:25,660
his thin skin makes
it okay in his eyes

905
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:27,704
for you to wind up
under the bus.

906
00:59:28,955 --> 00:59:30,331
Do you know what I'm saying?

907
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:34,085
Anyhow, that's how I see it.

908
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,962
You take care now, you hear?

909
00:59:39,132 --> 00:59:40,133
Baby!

910
00:59:43,636 --> 00:59:44,846
Who was that?

911
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:46,682
It's an old client.

912
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,352
It goes with the territory.

913
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,273
I'm sorry.

914
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:20,591
Hi.

915
01:00:22,968 --> 01:00:24,136
"Hi"?

916
01:00:26,597 --> 01:00:27,931
Oh, um...

917
01:00:30,934 --> 01:00:33,020
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

918
01:00:35,272 --> 01:00:36,398
And?

919
01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:40,402
How long has it been
since your last confession?

920
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:43,238
Well, I've never been before.

921
01:00:44,114 --> 01:00:45,657
This is my first.

922
01:00:46,366 --> 01:00:47,367
Are you Catholic?

923
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:48,745
No.

924
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,248
Then I cannot
give you absolution.

925
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,500
I know...

926
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:55,627
but I just wanted to tell
somebody what I had done...

927
01:00:55,794 --> 01:00:57,879
and I thought, "Why not go to
a professional?"

928
01:00:58,046 --> 01:00:59,964
Have you thought about
taking instructions?

929
01:01:00,131 --> 01:01:01,966
That's not something
I do very well.

930
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:04,094
I mean, in order to
become a Catholic.

931
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,929
Then you could confess...

932
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:08,014
and you will be
forgiven for your sins.

933
01:01:09,015 --> 01:01:11,351
What if they're unforgivable?

934
01:01:12,977 --> 01:01:14,479
Nothing is unforgivable.

935
01:01:14,646 --> 01:01:15,688
Oh, yeah?

936
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:19,442
Well, I haven't killed anybody,
but I've been pretty bad.

937
01:01:19,984 --> 01:01:22,445
Look, we have people here
waiting to go to confession...

938
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:23,613
so, I'm sorry.

939
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,281
They can wait.

940
01:01:27,158 --> 01:01:28,201
I did.

941
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,577
Who did you talk to about this?

942
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:31,287
Why did I talk to somebody?

943
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,081
You said
"Bless me, Father. "

944
01:01:33,248 --> 01:01:35,375
Well, I asked a friend but she
didn't know I was gonna do it.

945
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,210
So we're done here then?

946
01:01:37,585 --> 01:01:39,045
I haven't told you my sins yet.

947
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:42,132
I don't want to hear your sins.
There would be no point.

948
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,801
Were you baptized?

949
01:01:44,884 --> 01:01:46,678
I don't know.
It's possible.

950
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,471
Your parents never told you?

951
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,140
I never knew my parents.

952
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:52,560
They were thrown out of a helicopter
into the Atlantic Ocean...

953
01:01:52,726 --> 01:01:54,186
when I was three.

954
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:56,522
Listen...

955
01:01:57,523 --> 01:01:59,400
you don't have to do
the whole forgiveness thing.

956
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:01,652
All you have to do is listen.

957
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:04,155
To the sins.

958
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:08,784
Women tell you
about sex,don't they?

959
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:10,828
I can't talk about that.

960
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:14,832
Yeah, but every woman who
goes to confess tells you...

961
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:17,084
that she's an adulterer or
fornicator or something...

962
01:02:17,251 --> 01:02:19,712
or why else would
she be there?

963
01:02:19,879 --> 01:02:23,549
So you must have a very
unusual picture of women.

964
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,719
You must think that they're
just having sex all the time...

965
01:02:26,886 --> 01:02:28,721
You really need to go now.

966
01:02:28,888 --> 01:02:30,890
If you don't leave, I leave.

967
01:02:31,056 --> 01:02:32,224
Wait, where are you going?

968
01:02:33,726 --> 01:02:35,394
I wasn't finished.

969
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,274
I know.

970
01:02:40,649 --> 01:02:43,235
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

971
01:02:45,446 --> 01:02:47,323
I really miss you.

972
01:02:47,406 --> 01:02:50,492
<i>I really miss you.
I miss you so much.</i>

973
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:53,455
<i>You know what else I miss?</i>

974
01:02:53,538 --> 01:02:55,207
Don't go there.

975
01:02:58,251 --> 01:03:00,545
<i>Are you sure?</i>

976
01:03:00,629 --> 01:03:03,048
You're just glowing
with sexual health?

977
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,593
Is that bad?

978
01:03:06,718 --> 01:03:07,802
<i>No.</i>

979
01:03:07,886 --> 01:03:09,304
I love it.

980
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,515
<i>Do you miss me?</i>

981
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:14,226
Yes.

982
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:16,895
Bad. Badly.

983
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:22,525
<i>You haven't been taking liberties
with your person, have you?</i>

984
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:24,236
No.

985
01:03:27,155 --> 01:03:28,907
You couldn't touch it
with a powder puff?

986
01:03:33,578 --> 01:03:35,580
<i>Do you remember
the night we met?</i>

987
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:39,417
Yes, the airport parking lot.

988
01:03:40,669 --> 01:03:42,379
Did you know I would
do it that night?

989
01:03:44,256 --> 01:03:47,050
Did I know you would
do it with me?

990
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:48,927
Of course.

991
01:03:50,553 --> 01:03:51,888
Why there?

992
01:03:51,972 --> 01:03:56,185
<i>I don't know. I thought it would
be exciting, like in high school.</i>

993
01:03:56,269 --> 01:03:58,354
I remember asking you
if you were all right,

994
01:03:58,437 --> 01:04:00,982
'cause you were
gasping like an asthmatic.

995
01:04:05,444 --> 01:04:09,615
Oh, my goodness.
Is this phone sex?

996
01:04:13,035 --> 01:04:14,370
I wish you were here with me.

997
01:04:14,495 --> 01:04:15,788
<i>I know.</i>

998
01:04:17,373 --> 01:04:20,334
Life is being in bed with you.

999
01:04:20,418 --> 01:04:22,878
Everything else
is just waiting.

1000
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:26,382
I love you very much.

1001
01:04:29,427 --> 01:04:31,554
I love you so much.

1002
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,472
Good night.

1003
01:04:33,639 --> 01:04:34,682
<i>Good night.</i>

1004
01:04:41,439 --> 01:04:43,190
I don't know.

1005
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:46,360
Women have funny
ideas about sex.

1006
01:04:47,695 --> 01:04:50,489
They're supposed
to be so modest.

1007
01:04:51,615 --> 01:04:52,908
Let me tell you,
when they get it

1008
01:04:53,034 --> 01:04:54,327
in their heads how
they want to fuck...

1009
01:04:54,493 --> 01:04:55,661
they're like a freight train.

1010
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:57,581
Sign here.

1011
01:04:58,332 --> 01:05:00,959
The things I've
learned about women.

1012
01:05:01,209 --> 01:05:02,210
Fuck.

1013
01:05:02,377 --> 01:05:04,463
About half of it
I would like to forget.

1014
01:05:04,629 --> 01:05:06,673
I'm not sure
if I follow you.

1015
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,426
What is it you would like
to forget, for instance?

1016
01:05:09,593 --> 01:05:11,428
You don't want to know.

1017
01:05:13,513 --> 01:05:14,514
Sure I do.

1018
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,018
I don't know. Let's talk
about something else.

1019
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:19,686
Here.

1020
01:05:19,978 --> 01:05:22,356
Just pull up your socks
and tell me.

1021
01:05:24,858 --> 01:05:26,109
Yeah...

1022
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,195
I don't know.

1023
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:30,989
What is it you would
like to forget?

1024
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:32,240
All right.

1025
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:35,202
I would like to forget about
Malkina fucking my car.

1026
01:05:35,577 --> 01:05:36,745
What?

1027
01:05:36,912 --> 01:05:38,121
See?

1028
01:05:38,288 --> 01:05:39,539
What did you just say?

1029
01:05:39,748 --> 01:05:43,418
I said I would like to forget
about Malkina fucking my car.

1030
01:05:44,586 --> 01:05:45,879
I think.

1031
01:05:46,505 --> 01:05:48,882
What the hell are
you talking about?

1032
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:52,219
Do you remember
that yellow California I had?

1033
01:05:52,803 --> 01:05:54,096
Sure. Nice car.

1034
01:05:54,262 --> 01:05:56,223
Very nice car.

1035
01:05:57,516 --> 01:06:01,062
Anyway, this was a while back,
not that long.

1036
01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:05,733
We'd been getting it on for a
while, and we came back one night.

1037
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,236
<i>We were staying
up at Cloudcroft.</i>

1038
01:06:08,903 --> 01:06:12,532
<i>We drove out on a golf course
and parked.</i>

1039
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,784
And we're sitting there, talking...

1040
01:06:14,951 --> 01:06:18,413
and for no particular reason
that I could see...

1041
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:21,124
she slides off her knickers...

1042
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:24,252
<i>and hands them to me
and gets out of the car.</i>

1043
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,711
I asked her what
she was doing...

1044
01:06:25,795 --> 01:06:28,589
and she says,
"I'm going to fuck your car. "

1045
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:30,842
All right.

1046
01:06:30,925 --> 01:06:32,677
Leave the door open.

1047
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:37,932
<i>So...</i>

1048
01:06:38,766 --> 01:06:42,937
<i>she goes around and climbs up
on the hood of the Ferrari...</i>

1049
01:06:43,438 --> 01:06:48,276
<i>and pulls her dress up
around her waist...</i>

1050
01:06:48,693 --> 01:06:51,237
and spreads herself
across the windshield

1051
01:06:51,362 --> 01:06:53,948
in front of me
with no panties on.

1052
01:06:55,116 --> 01:06:59,996
<i>And she's had this Brazilian
wax job, you know?</i>

1053
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:02,082
<i>Don't even think
I'm making this up.</i>

1054
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:03,959
<i>You can't make
this up, all right?</i>

1055
01:07:04,126 --> 01:07:05,627
<i>I mean, she was a dancer.</i>

1056
01:07:05,794 --> 01:07:09,006
<i>So, she does
this full split...</i>

1057
01:07:09,339 --> 01:07:14,094
and then she starts rubbing
herself up and down on the glass.

1058
01:07:14,636 --> 01:07:17,514
<i>Then she leans down
to see if I'm watching.</i>

1059
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:20,309
<i>Like, no, I'm sitting there
reading my email.</i>

1060
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:24,146
<i>And she kisses me
upside down.</i>

1061
01:07:24,313 --> 01:07:25,856
<i>And then she tells me
that she's going to come.</i>

1062
01:07:26,023 --> 01:07:28,817
<i>I thought, "I'm losing my fucking mind.
That's what's happening here. "</i>

1063
01:07:28,984 --> 01:07:30,861
<i>It was like one of those...</i>

1064
01:07:31,987 --> 01:07:36,158
one of those catfish things.
You know? One of those...

1065
01:07:37,868 --> 01:07:39,495
One of those
bottom-feeders you see

1066
01:07:39,661 --> 01:07:41,330
going up the side
of the aquarium...

1067
01:07:41,497 --> 01:07:43,332
sucking its way up the glass.

1068
01:07:44,249 --> 01:07:46,460
<i>I mean, it was,
I don't know...</i>

1069
01:07:48,504 --> 01:07:49,796
hallucinatory.

1070
01:07:49,963 --> 01:07:52,633
You see a thing like that,
it changes you.

1071
01:07:54,384 --> 01:07:55,511
Jesus.

1072
01:07:55,677 --> 01:07:57,387
Yeah, tell me about it.

1073
01:07:59,097 --> 01:08:00,516
Did she...?

1074
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,686
Did she what?

1075
01:08:04,395 --> 01:08:05,897
Did she come?

1076
01:08:06,356 --> 01:08:08,858
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

1077
01:08:09,651 --> 01:08:11,694
<i>Finally she climbs down
and she comes around...</i>

1078
01:08:11,861 --> 01:08:13,530
<i>and she gets in the car
and shuts the door.</i>

1079
01:08:13,696 --> 01:08:15,907
I hand her her knickers,
she puts them in her purse...

1080
01:08:16,074 --> 01:08:19,369
and she looks at me to see
what I thought about that.

1081
01:08:21,204 --> 01:08:23,206
<i>What I thought about it?</i>

1082
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,708
Well, I don't know
what I thought about it.

1083
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:28,253
I mean, I still don't.

1084
01:08:29,546 --> 01:08:33,550
It was too gynecological
to be sexy. Almost.

1085
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:36,219
But mostly,
I was just fucking stunned.

1086
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,514
And I asked her if she had
ever done that before...

1087
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:42,225
and she said she had done everything
before. And I believe her.

1088
01:08:44,978 --> 01:08:48,189
So she starts the engine
and turns on the lights,

1089
01:08:48,273 --> 01:08:49,649
but the windshield
is so smeared,

1090
01:08:49,732 --> 01:08:51,985
and I didn't have
anything to wipe it with.

1091
01:08:52,068 --> 01:08:56,114
And she, of course, suggested
that I get out and lick it off.

1092
01:08:56,197 --> 01:08:58,032
But I tried the wipers,

1093
01:08:58,116 --> 01:09:00,243
and naturally, the windshield
washer thing doesn't work,

1094
01:09:00,326 --> 01:09:02,287
because Italians don't really
believe in that sort of thing.

1095
01:09:02,787 --> 01:09:05,958
And finally, I took off my socks

1096
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:10,087
and got out of the car
and used them.

1097
01:09:15,926 --> 01:09:17,094
Do you think
she knew what kind

1098
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,387
of effect this might
have on a guy?

1099
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:21,974
Jesus, Counselor, are you kidding?
She knows everything.

1100
01:09:24,435 --> 01:09:26,604
You don't think this is
an odd thing to tell me?

1101
01:09:27,354 --> 01:09:29,398
I think it is an odd thing.

1102
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,400
No, I mean,
why is it okay to tell

1103
01:09:31,483 --> 01:09:32,651
a thing like that
about somebody...

1104
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,903
Somebody I'm banging?

1105
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:38,407
Come on, Reiner.

1106
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:41,410
Okay, I don't know,
you're probably right.

1107
01:09:41,952 --> 01:09:44,580
Maybe I wanted to see
what you would say.

1108
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,750
Maybe there's more to it than that.
Maybe I'm scared.

1109
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:49,627
You're scared?

1110
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:50,794
Yeah.

1111
01:09:50,878 --> 01:09:52,963
Probably, yeah.
Sometimes...

1112
01:09:53,797 --> 01:09:56,091
she scares
the shit out of me.

1113
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:59,553
Because of that? No, not that.
But...

1114
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:02,181
You're in love with her.

1115
01:10:02,348 --> 01:10:04,099
I don't know what I am.

1116
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:07,311
Yeah, I guess
I'm in love with her, but...

1117
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:10,899
you don't think
that's cause for worry?

1118
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:13,818
It's like being
in love with...

1119
01:10:15,737 --> 01:10:17,489
easeful death.

1120
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,158
Well, I don't know what it is
that you're trying to tell me.

1121
01:10:20,909 --> 01:10:22,160
I know.

1122
01:10:23,328 --> 01:10:25,413
Does this have anything
to do with the deal?

1123
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:28,208
I don't know.

1124
01:10:31,002 --> 01:10:33,088
You're right.

1125
01:10:33,254 --> 01:10:35,090
I shouldn't have told you.

1126
01:10:35,256 --> 01:10:36,758
Just forget it.
Forget it.

1127
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:39,010
Forget it?
Yeah.

1128
01:10:40,387 --> 01:10:41,680
How do you
propose I do that?

1129
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:44,182
Jesus, Counselor,
how do I know?

1130
01:10:44,349 --> 01:10:45,809
Just forget it.

1131
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,538
I gotta go.

1132
01:11:12,378 --> 01:11:14,422
Sir, may I help you?

1133
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:19,885
Nope.

1134
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:08,472
<i>Are you there?</i>

1135
01:14:10,224 --> 01:14:11,601
Anything?

1136
01:14:12,977 --> 01:14:14,312
<i>He's coming.</i>

1137
01:14:15,646 --> 01:14:17,441
Yeah, I hear him.

1138
01:14:18,483 --> 01:14:19,818
All right,
let's do it.

1139
01:15:25,385 --> 01:15:27,136
<i>Jamie, come in.</i>

1140
01:15:30,014 --> 01:15:31,474
<i>Are we okay?</i>

1141
01:15:32,517 --> 01:15:33,810
We're good.

1142
01:16:09,387 --> 01:16:10,388
Hi.

1143
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,181
Hi.

1144
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,812
I had a dream about you.

1145
01:16:17,895 --> 01:16:18,896
Did you?

1146
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:20,524
<i>Yeah.</i>

1147
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:24,445
<i>Very strange. I woke up, and I
could still remember the dream,</i>

1148
01:16:24,528 --> 01:16:28,741
but I could not remember
why it was so disturbing.

1149
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:31,118
<i>You know?</i>

1150
01:16:31,952 --> 01:16:34,288
<i>I just wanted to call
and see if you were all right.</i>

1151
01:16:35,456 --> 01:16:37,207
Are you superstitious?

1152
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:39,710
I don't think so.

1153
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:43,088
No more than the next person.

1154
01:16:43,714 --> 01:16:45,716
<i>And who would that be?</i>

1155
01:16:46,675 --> 01:16:47,718
Excuse me?

1156
01:16:48,093 --> 01:16:49,845
The next person.

1157
01:16:53,432 --> 01:16:55,059
You're not gay,
are you?

1158
01:16:55,976 --> 01:16:58,062
No, of course not.

1159
01:17:00,272 --> 01:17:02,066
I shouldn't have called.

1160
01:17:03,859 --> 01:17:07,404
<i>I know you think
my world is naive.</i>

1161
01:17:07,488 --> 01:17:09,907
But is that so bad,
to have hope?

1162
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:14,453
<i>I don't know.
I can't advise you.</i>

1163
01:17:15,662 --> 01:17:16,789
I know.

1164
01:17:18,499 --> 01:17:21,960
You should be careful
what you wish for, angel.

1165
01:17:22,796 --> 01:17:24,672
<i>You might not get it.</i>

1166
01:17:25,298 --> 01:17:26,341
I know.

1167
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,384
Do you?

1168
01:17:29,094 --> 01:17:30,595
Yes, I do.

1169
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:34,015
Good.
I'll see you at the club.

1170
01:18:18,643 --> 01:18:20,103
Do you know
which truck it is?

1171
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:22,856
Yeah.
It's got Arizona plates.

1172
01:18:38,831 --> 01:18:40,207
Do you know how it goes?

1173
01:18:40,374 --> 01:18:41,417
Yeah.

1174
01:18:42,126 --> 01:18:43,794
It's color-coded.

1175
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:46,422
Red to red.

1176
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:50,009
Green to green.

1177
01:18:50,509 --> 01:18:52,761
Black to black.

1178
01:18:53,012 --> 01:18:54,847
See if it will start.

1179
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,312
Wait a minute.

1180
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:04,356
This thing has
got a switch on it.

1181
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:08,986
Try it now.

1182
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:23,918
Counselor.

1183
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:25,669
We've got a problem.

1184
01:19:27,339 --> 01:19:28,590
<i>Are you there?</i>

1185
01:19:29,925 --> 01:19:31,218
I'm here.

1186
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:33,720
How bad a problem?

1187
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,889
Let's say pretty bad.

1188
01:19:36,056 --> 01:19:37,724
And then multiply it by 10.

1189
01:19:37,891 --> 01:19:38,934
Fuck.

1190
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,685
Meet me in the atrium
at the Coronado.

1191
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:43,104
<i>Coronado? When?</i>

1192
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:44,689
Now.

1193
01:19:44,856 --> 01:19:48,151
We can start getting used
to our new lifestyle.

1194
01:20:19,349 --> 01:20:20,475
Morning.

1195
01:20:20,642 --> 01:20:22,102
Morning.

1196
01:20:22,269 --> 01:20:23,645
Have you seen the paper?

1197
01:20:23,812 --> 01:20:24,854
Nope.

1198
01:20:30,069 --> 01:20:32,280
Do you know who
the Green Hornet is?

1199
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:35,700
The Green Hornet?
Yes.

1200
01:20:35,866 --> 01:20:37,159
He's a cartoon character.

1201
01:20:37,326 --> 01:20:38,869
He's a biker.

1202
01:20:39,578 --> 01:20:40,871
Shit.

1203
01:20:41,372 --> 01:20:42,456
Mmm.

1204
01:20:42,999 --> 01:20:44,417
All right, what?

1205
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,294
Is he in custody?

1206
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,461
It's in the paper.

1207
01:20:48,296 --> 01:20:49,422
What has he done?

1208
01:20:49,588 --> 01:20:51,048
You don't know
anything about this?

1209
01:20:51,215 --> 01:20:52,258
About what?

1210
01:20:52,675 --> 01:20:54,635
Like I said,
it's in the paper.

1211
01:21:00,141 --> 01:21:01,726
He had no ID on him?
No.

1212
01:21:01,892 --> 01:21:03,269
No head either.

1213
01:21:03,436 --> 01:21:04,603
What the hell is this?

1214
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:06,897
I was hoping
you would tell me.

1215
01:21:07,064 --> 01:21:09,859
I had a call from
our business partners.

1216
01:21:10,026 --> 01:21:11,402
They wanted to speak with you.

1217
01:21:12,278 --> 01:21:14,572
It seems the deceased
was working for them.

1218
01:21:14,739 --> 01:21:16,407
Now the shipment is missing...

1219
01:21:16,574 --> 01:21:19,827
and all they have to go on is
that he was a client of yours.

1220
01:21:19,994 --> 01:21:22,079
Client?
He wasn't a client.

1221
01:21:22,288 --> 01:21:23,622
You got him out of jail.

1222
01:21:23,831 --> 01:21:26,000
That doesn't
make him a client.

1223
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:29,712
It was a speeding ticket,
for Christ's sake.

1224
01:21:29,795 --> 01:21:31,006
Jesus.

1225
01:21:31,757 --> 01:21:33,216
I am perfectly
willing to believe

1226
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,384
you had nothing
to do with this...

1227
01:21:34,468 --> 01:21:36,845
but I am not the party
you need to convince.

1228
01:21:37,012 --> 01:21:38,889
Convince of what,
for Christ's sake?

1229
01:21:39,389 --> 01:21:41,558
That this is just
some sort of coincidence.

1230
01:21:41,725 --> 01:21:45,645
They're a pragmatic lot. They
don't believe in coincidences.

1231
01:21:45,812 --> 01:21:48,357
They've heard of them,
they've just never seen one.

1232
01:21:50,776 --> 01:21:51,943
So, what happened
to the shipment?

1233
01:21:52,361 --> 01:21:53,362
I asked them that.

1234
01:21:53,528 --> 01:21:54,654
And?

1235
01:21:55,364 --> 01:21:57,366
<i>They sand, "Se fue. "</i>

1236
01:21:57,866 --> 01:21:59,368
It's gone?
Mmm.

1237
01:22:00,452 --> 01:22:01,495
Jesus.

1238
01:22:01,661 --> 01:22:05,665
Does his mother know? I guess she does.
I need to call her.

1239
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,002
That is probably
not a good idea.

1240
01:22:09,169 --> 01:22:10,170
Why?

1241
01:22:10,337 --> 01:22:12,047
She said she's going
to have you killed.

1242
01:22:12,547 --> 01:22:14,382
Sweet Jesus!

1243
01:22:14,841 --> 01:22:17,803
Sorry about that. What
can I get you to drink?

1244
01:22:17,886 --> 01:22:19,096
Hemlock.

1245
01:22:19,179 --> 01:22:20,222
I'm sorry?

1246
01:22:20,305 --> 01:22:22,432
I'll have an OJ
and a coffee.

1247
01:22:22,599 --> 01:22:24,726
He'll be having a double Maalox
and a side of Oxycontin.

1248
01:22:25,393 --> 01:22:27,479
Just bring us
the two coffees.

1249
01:22:27,938 --> 01:22:28,980
And my OJ.

1250
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:37,949
How did you
wind up with her?

1251
01:22:39,492 --> 01:22:40,827
The mother?

1252
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,788
Yes, the mother.
The mother of all mothers.

1253
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,290
Court appointment.

1254
01:22:46,457 --> 01:22:48,501
It's an appeal. One of
Ferguson's fucked-up deals.

1255
01:22:48,668 --> 01:22:52,755
Look, they can't hook me onto
this thing, mother or no mother.

1256
01:22:53,339 --> 01:22:57,510
Well, I don't know what the kid
told her, or what she told the kid.

1257
01:22:57,677 --> 01:23:00,138
But at this juncture, I would
avoid trying to explain myself.

1258
01:23:00,471 --> 01:23:02,515
What do they think I
would do with this shit?

1259
01:23:02,682 --> 01:23:04,058
They don't know.
They don't care.

1260
01:23:04,225 --> 01:23:05,893
They think everybody
is hooked into something.

1261
01:23:06,435 --> 01:23:08,437
You need to think
about this, Counselor.

1262
01:23:08,688 --> 01:23:10,439
These people are out 20 mil.

1263
01:23:10,606 --> 01:23:12,900
Do you understand
how serious this is?

1264
01:23:14,652 --> 01:23:17,572
They think we're all involved,
don't they? Reiner, too?

1265
01:23:17,738 --> 01:23:20,783
What do you think?
You fucking genius.

1266
01:23:24,871 --> 01:23:26,622
Have you ever
seen a snuff film?

1267
01:23:26,956 --> 01:23:28,624
No. You?

1268
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:29,792
Would you?

1269
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:31,127
I would not.

1270
01:23:32,295 --> 01:23:35,257
Because the consumer
of the product

1271
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,842
is essential to
its production.

1272
01:23:36,925 --> 01:23:40,888
You cannot watch without
being accessory to a murder.

1273
01:23:41,972 --> 01:23:43,307
Will there be anything else?

1274
01:23:43,473 --> 01:23:44,808
No, thank you.

1275
01:23:48,896 --> 01:23:50,647
Do you know somebody
who's seen one?

1276
01:23:51,315 --> 01:23:53,150
Yes, I do.

1277
01:23:53,317 --> 01:23:56,403
He said the young girl was looking
into the camera, crying...

1278
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,614
when her head was lopped off.

1279
01:23:59,323 --> 01:24:01,325
Think about that
the next time you do a line.

1280
01:24:01,575 --> 01:24:02,743
I don't do drugs.

1281
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:04,828
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1282
01:24:04,995 --> 01:24:06,663
Because what follows,
I would hope

1283
01:24:06,747 --> 01:24:09,333
would be beyond your
powers of imagination.

1284
01:24:11,168 --> 01:24:15,088
They let a figure in, wearing
only a hood with eyeholes...

1285
01:24:15,255 --> 01:24:20,344
to address himself to the
headless and quivering corpse.

1286
01:24:20,969 --> 01:24:25,766
Which, you must remember, was selected
because of her youth and beauty.

1287
01:24:26,433 --> 01:24:28,936
And all of this,
he has paid for.

1288
01:24:29,853 --> 01:24:34,524
So, what do you think that cost?
Ballpark?

1289
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:36,777
Jesus.

1290
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:38,696
Mmm.

1291
01:24:39,697 --> 01:24:40,949
God.

1292
01:24:41,324 --> 01:24:43,326
The point, Counselor...

1293
01:24:43,493 --> 01:24:45,703
is that you may think
there are things that

1294
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:48,122
these people are
simply incapable of.

1295
01:24:48,289 --> 01:24:49,540
There are not.

1296
01:24:51,709 --> 01:24:54,462
Counselor, I don't know
what you should do.

1297
01:24:55,004 --> 01:24:58,049
But at this point,
it's out of your hands.

1298
01:25:00,551 --> 01:25:01,886
What about you?

1299
01:25:02,053 --> 01:25:04,847
I've known this day was
coming for a long time.

1300
01:25:05,223 --> 01:25:08,059
Do I regret what I've done?
That's sophomoric.

1301
01:25:08,226 --> 01:25:11,312
I should've jumped ship a
long time ago, and I didn't.

1302
01:25:12,897 --> 01:25:14,816
So, what happens next?

1303
01:25:15,817 --> 01:25:18,278
I'm going to go find a nice,
quiet place,

1304
01:25:18,403 --> 01:25:20,863
and sit down and
think about this.

1305
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:24,325
I would suggest you do the
same, but I know you won't.

1306
01:25:25,034 --> 01:25:26,828
If you think,
Counselor, that you can

1307
01:25:26,953 --> 01:25:28,746
live in this world
and be no part of it...

1308
01:25:28,913 --> 01:25:30,248
then all I can say
is you're wrong.

1309
01:25:31,249 --> 01:25:34,085
It's not that you're
going down, Counselor...

1310
01:25:34,585 --> 01:25:36,421
it's what you're
taking down with you.

1311
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:09,038
Excuse me, ma'am.

1312
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,415
I'm terribly sorry
to bother you...

1313
01:26:11,582 --> 01:26:15,419
but my phone is out
and it's my kid's birthday.

1314
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:18,630
May I please use your phone
for just a minute?

1315
01:26:19,465 --> 01:26:20,716
Sure.

1316
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,551
Thank you.

1317
01:26:30,642 --> 01:26:32,603
Where are you?

1318
01:26:33,145 --> 01:26:35,481
I can't call you
on my cell anymore.

1319
01:26:35,647 --> 01:26:39,985
Now, listen to me. Go home and
wait for me there, I'll call you.

1320
01:26:40,152 --> 01:26:42,322
I'll explain everything later.

1321
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:46,576
I love you.

1322
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:48,995
I'll call you later. Okay.

1323
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,665
Thank you.

1324
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:54,834
I hope you didn't call China.

1325
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:57,087
Have a nice day.

1326
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,171
You, too.

1327
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,315
Fuck.

1328
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,876
Switch off the engine.

1329
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:38,878
They're not cops.

1330
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:40,964
These guys are cartel.

1331
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:54,728
Switch off
your engine!

1332
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,400
Go check it out.

1333
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:12,079
Ah!

1334
01:30:03,985 --> 01:30:05,486
No problems.

1335
01:30:05,695 --> 01:30:07,196
Got to go.

1336
01:30:07,363 --> 01:30:09,282
Bodies on the road.

1337
01:30:11,617 --> 01:30:12,618
You talked to him.

1338
01:30:12,702 --> 01:30:14,036
Yeah,
I talked to him.

1339
01:30:16,497 --> 01:30:18,833
I don't feel comfortable here.
Can we go somewhere else?

1340
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,459
Uh, sure.

1341
01:30:21,335 --> 01:30:22,378
Come on.

1342
01:30:34,974 --> 01:30:38,728
You think I know something you don't,
Counselor? What would that be?

1343
01:30:38,811 --> 01:30:42,273
I don't know what "how bad" means.
Bad is bad.

1344
01:30:42,398 --> 01:30:44,233
Westray thinks we're fucked.
"We"?

1345
01:30:44,567 --> 01:30:45,610
Yeah.

1346
01:30:45,693 --> 01:30:48,029
All right.
I suppose I could ask you

1347
01:30:48,154 --> 01:30:50,532
if you've got a rat
in your pocket.

1348
01:30:50,699 --> 01:30:52,784
You're not serious.

1349
01:30:52,951 --> 01:30:56,580
Well, when was the last time
you tried to call him?

1350
01:30:56,747 --> 01:30:57,831
Yesterday. Why?

1351
01:30:58,081 --> 01:30:59,207
Why?

1352
01:30:59,374 --> 01:31:01,418
Because I couldn't
reach him now, all right?

1353
01:31:07,049 --> 01:31:08,425
What are you going to do?

1354
01:31:10,177 --> 01:31:11,720
I don't know.

1355
01:31:12,471 --> 01:31:14,598
What are you?
I don't know.

1356
01:31:16,933 --> 01:31:18,935
That's what Westray said.
But he did know, didn't he?

1357
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:24,649
What are you going
to use for money?

1358
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,027
I've got some money.
I don't think so.

1359
01:31:27,194 --> 01:31:28,779
If you had any serious
money, you wouldn't

1360
01:31:28,862 --> 01:31:30,447
be in this jackpot
in the first place.

1361
01:31:30,614 --> 01:31:31,656
I might.
Oh, yeah?

1362
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:34,117
Well, I know why I'm in it.
Do you?

1363
01:31:34,284 --> 01:31:35,994
Sure. Same as you.
Greed.

1364
01:31:36,161 --> 01:31:37,287
Yeah?

1365
01:31:37,454 --> 01:31:40,248
No. You got in trouble.

1366
01:31:40,415 --> 01:31:43,418
I tried to appeal to your
greed two years ago.

1367
01:31:43,585 --> 01:31:45,754
No deal.
Now, it's too late.

1368
01:31:46,171 --> 01:31:48,382
It's too late.

1369
01:31:49,549 --> 01:31:50,592
What do you think I should do?

1370
01:31:50,759 --> 01:31:54,055
I don't know, Counselor.
I don't know.

1371
01:31:55,181 --> 01:31:57,266
They know
that you're stupid.

1372
01:31:58,226 --> 01:31:59,644
They just don't
know how stupid.

1373
01:32:03,689 --> 01:32:06,442
You say that like
it's my hole card.

1374
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:11,614
Maybe it is.

1375
01:32:11,781 --> 01:32:13,741
Suppose you could sit
down and have a chat

1376
01:32:13,825 --> 01:32:14,909
with these guys,
what would you say?

1377
01:32:15,743 --> 01:32:17,245
I'd tell them the truth.

1378
01:32:17,412 --> 01:32:20,331
You're just a fucking wonder,
do you know that?

1379
01:32:20,498 --> 01:32:22,375
Go ahead.
Go ahead what?

1380
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:24,544
With the truth.
I'd like to hear it.

1381
01:32:24,961 --> 01:32:26,587
I'd tell them that
I never even met this kid.

1382
01:32:26,754 --> 01:32:28,548
That I got him out of jail
on a speeding charge.

1383
01:32:28,673 --> 01:32:30,216
Okay, how did he
happen to hire you?

1384
01:32:30,383 --> 01:32:33,052
He didn't. I got him out of
jail as a favor to his mother.

1385
01:32:33,219 --> 01:32:35,346
How do you happen
to know the mother?

1386
01:32:35,513 --> 01:32:37,348
I was appointed by
the court to represent her

1387
01:32:37,515 --> 01:32:39,350
in an appeal on
a capital murder case.

1388
01:32:39,517 --> 01:32:41,436
Do you know what her son did
for a living?

1389
01:32:41,519 --> 01:32:42,478
No.

1390
01:32:42,562 --> 01:32:43,980
But you do now.

1391
01:32:45,815 --> 01:32:46,816
I do now.

1392
01:32:46,941 --> 01:32:47,942
And would it please you to tell

1393
01:32:48,025 --> 01:32:49,777
the court what
that occupation was?

1394
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:52,405
How did I get in court?

1395
01:32:53,364 --> 01:32:55,159
I thought I was
talking to cartel guys.

1396
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:58,579
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I was
giving you the easiest way out.

1397
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:01,707
Very funny.

1398
01:33:01,874 --> 01:33:04,084
Yeah, well, probably not.

1399
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:07,838
I'm really worried, baby.

1400
01:33:08,672 --> 01:33:11,758
It's going to be all right.
I'll take care of it.

1401
01:33:11,884 --> 01:33:12,885
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1402
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:14,386
Can't you meet me someplace?

1403
01:33:14,553 --> 01:33:15,721
<i>I can't right now.</i>

1404
01:33:15,888 --> 01:33:17,973
That's not possible
that you can't.

1405
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,641
God, I miss you.

1406
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:22,352
Meet me.

1407
01:33:22,686 --> 01:33:24,938
We really have to be careful.

1408
01:33:25,105 --> 01:33:27,232
<i>How bad is it?</i>

1409
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:29,318
How bad is it?

1410
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:31,361
All right, where?

1411
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:35,324
How about Boise?

1412
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:37,117
<i>Boise?</i>

1413
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:38,702
Boise.

1414
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:42,915
Why Boise?

1415
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:44,625
What's wrong with Boise?

1416
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:46,835
Have you ever been to Boise?

1417
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:48,587
No, have you?

1418
01:33:49,588 --> 01:33:50,881
No.

1419
01:33:54,468 --> 01:33:55,761
Do you have a hotel?

1420
01:33:57,263 --> 01:33:58,640
I'm looking as we speak.

1421
01:34:02,519 --> 01:34:03,603
Tomorrow.

1422
01:34:04,437 --> 01:34:05,647
Boise.

1423
01:34:06,606 --> 01:34:08,274
<i>Yeah, Boise.</i>

1424
01:34:09,108 --> 01:34:11,611
<i>I'll leave you a message
at the Delta counter.</i>

1425
01:34:11,778 --> 01:34:13,154
Okay.

1426
01:34:13,321 --> 01:34:15,949
<i>Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'll set this straight.</i>

1427
01:34:16,115 --> 01:34:17,116
I know.

1428
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,536
<i>I love you.
I love you.</i>

1429
01:34:20,036 --> 01:34:21,454
<i>Be safe.</i>

1430
01:34:53,236 --> 01:34:54,571
So...

1431
01:34:55,321 --> 01:34:57,490
<i>where do you think this
is going, mi capitan?</i>

1432
01:34:58,867 --> 01:34:59,910
This?

1433
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:01,203
Yes.

1434
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:08,168
I can't really take
your question seriously.

1435
01:35:11,422 --> 01:35:13,340
It's going
where it's going.

1436
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:17,761
Well, either you think
it's all going to work out...

1437
01:35:17,928 --> 01:35:20,598
or you don't want
to think about it at all.

1438
01:35:22,516 --> 01:35:24,727
Because the third alternative
is unacceptable?

1439
01:35:24,893 --> 01:35:26,437
Yes.

1440
01:35:26,604 --> 01:35:28,606
The excluded middle.

1441
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:33,027
I don't like
decisions made for me.

1442
01:35:33,193 --> 01:35:36,363
But if you put them off, waiting
for the maximum information...

1443
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:38,365
that may be what happens.

1444
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:40,159
You think there's
still space enough

1445
01:35:40,242 --> 01:35:43,454
to make the decision,
and then there isn't.

1446
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:45,581
"Space. "
Yeah.

1447
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,707
Hmm.

1448
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:50,586
Greed really takes you
to the edge, doesn't it?

1449
01:35:50,961 --> 01:35:51,962
Mmm.

1450
01:35:52,046 --> 01:35:56,050
That's not what greed does.
That's what greed is.

1451
01:35:57,718 --> 01:36:00,722
When the axe comes
through the door...

1452
01:36:00,889 --> 01:36:03,058
I'll already be gone.
You know that.

1453
01:36:04,893 --> 01:36:06,561
That's fair enough.

1454
01:36:10,982 --> 01:36:12,776
You're in trouble.

1455
01:36:13,151 --> 01:36:15,445
Yeah, probably.

1456
01:36:16,404 --> 01:36:18,573
I don't want to lose you.

1457
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:21,951
There.

1458
01:36:23,912 --> 01:36:25,330
I know.

1459
01:36:25,497 --> 01:36:26,998
Are you hungry?

1460
01:36:27,165 --> 01:36:28,958
I'm starving.

1461
01:38:58,401 --> 01:39:00,403
Fuck. Fuck!

1462
01:39:15,711 --> 01:39:16,712
Shit!

1463
01:39:30,434 --> 01:39:33,062
Intercept him!
We want him alive!

1464
01:39:33,229 --> 01:39:34,438
<i>Got it!</i>

1465
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:54,292
Fuck.

1466
01:40:16,523 --> 01:40:17,649
Ah!

1467
01:40:18,442 --> 01:40:19,776
No!

1468
01:40:20,152 --> 01:40:22,237
What the fuck did you do?

1469
01:41:39,565 --> 01:41:41,067
<i>Do you know where Reiner is?</i>

1470
01:41:41,234 --> 01:41:42,402
Nope.

1471
01:41:43,861 --> 01:41:44,946
He doesn't answer his cell.

1472
01:41:45,113 --> 01:41:47,699
And the phone at the club
is no longer in service.

1473
01:41:48,116 --> 01:41:49,283
Where are you?

1474
01:41:49,617 --> 01:41:51,411
I'm at home.

1475
01:41:51,577 --> 01:41:53,579
I'm surprised to hear
you're still there.

1476
01:41:54,414 --> 01:41:55,873
Well, I won't be in an hour.

1477
01:41:59,085 --> 01:42:00,128
An hour.

1478
01:42:00,878 --> 01:42:03,256
Yeah. Where are you?

1479
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,258
I'm not at home.

1480
01:42:05,425 --> 01:42:06,718
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

1481
01:42:06,884 --> 01:42:09,220
What are you,
a mental defective?

1482
01:42:09,387 --> 01:42:11,014
I can't advise you,
Counselor. Call a cab.

1483
01:42:12,432 --> 01:42:13,684
Listen...

1484
01:42:14,935 --> 01:42:17,604
if your definition of a friend is
someone who will die for you...

1485
01:42:17,771 --> 01:42:18,939
then you don't
have any friends.

1486
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:22,026
<i>I gotta go.
You take care.</i>

1487
01:43:48,863 --> 01:43:49,864
No!

1488
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,482
Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad!

1489
01:44:18,686 --> 01:44:20,437
Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad!

1490
01:44:21,063 --> 01:44:22,064
Dad!
Dad!

1491
01:44:22,815 --> 01:44:24,316
Dad!
What?

1492
01:45:12,281 --> 01:45:13,866
Are you all right here, sir?

1493
01:45:13,949 --> 01:45:15,034
Sorry?

1494
01:45:15,117 --> 01:45:16,285
Can I bring you something?

1495
01:45:18,579 --> 01:45:19,789
Would you
do something for me?

1496
01:45:20,415 --> 01:45:21,458
Yes, sir.
Of course.

1497
01:45:26,129 --> 01:45:27,339
Here's my card.

1498
01:45:28,298 --> 01:45:30,508
I'm a guestat the hotel.

1499
01:45:32,135 --> 01:45:33,762
What I wish you
would do for me is go

1500
01:45:33,887 --> 01:45:35,472
to the desk and see
if I have any messages.

1501
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:38,558
I know you're wondering
why I don't go myself,

1502
01:45:38,683 --> 01:45:40,602
but I've bothered
them so much...

1503
01:45:40,769 --> 01:45:44,022
I think they're beginning to figure
me for some sort of nutcase.

1504
01:45:44,189 --> 01:45:46,441
Sure. I'm afraid
they'll stop looking.

1505
01:45:46,608 --> 01:45:47,817
You got it.

1506
01:46:25,648 --> 01:46:27,024
<i>Abogado Hernandez?</i>

1507
01:46:27,191 --> 01:46:28,526
<i>I need your help.</i>

1508
01:46:28,693 --> 01:46:30,194
<i>Can I come see you?</i>

1509
01:46:30,361 --> 01:46:32,530
<i>No problem. Tomorrow.</i>

1510
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:34,240
<i>Thank you.</i>

1511
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:49,547
Upstairs.

1512
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:09,567
All right.

1513
01:47:11,027 --> 01:47:12,903
I have made the call.

1514
01:47:13,446 --> 01:47:14,905
You understand?

1515
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:18,242
If it is all right,
it is all right.

1516
01:47:18,409 --> 01:47:21,370
Don't put me in the center.
Okay?

1517
01:47:22,246 --> 01:47:23,790
"In the middle. "

1518
01:47:23,957 --> 01:47:26,084
In the middle, yeah.

1519
01:47:28,086 --> 01:47:29,629
What do I owe you?

1520
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:37,471
You owe me nothing, Counselor.
We are friends.

1521
01:47:37,637 --> 01:47:39,556
Just a handshake.

1522
01:47:44,478 --> 01:47:45,729
Thank you.

1523
01:47:46,438 --> 01:47:48,815
It Will be a yes or no.

1524
01:47:54,946 --> 01:47:56,406
I will do what I can do.

1525
01:47:56,907 --> 01:47:59,451
But you must
know that this is...

1526
01:47:59,618 --> 01:48:01,286
a long shot.

1527
01:48:01,453 --> 01:48:02,788
I know.

1528
01:48:03,955 --> 01:48:04,956
Thank you.

1529
01:48:15,759 --> 01:48:18,762
Look, the last time I spoke to
them, they were in Midland, Texas.

1530
01:48:18,929 --> 01:48:20,931
That was about two days ago.

1531
01:48:21,473 --> 01:48:23,642
So, I called up the Sheriff
there and I asked him...

1532
01:48:23,809 --> 01:48:26,187
had they found any dead bodies
along the side of the highway?

1533
01:48:26,354 --> 01:48:30,483
And he said that they did. And I
said, "Thank you," and I hung up.

1534
01:48:31,818 --> 01:48:34,445
I know you think I'm kidding.

1535
01:48:34,612 --> 01:48:36,364
But I'm not.

1536
01:48:36,989 --> 01:48:38,783
And I'm not out.

1537
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:42,328
That's right. And I'm not
kidding about that either.

1538
01:48:43,496 --> 01:48:44,831
Really?

1539
01:48:45,498 --> 01:48:50,002
No, I know where the truck is going.
I always did.

1540
01:48:50,336 --> 01:48:51,671
Really?

1541
01:48:52,338 --> 01:48:55,550
Well, I think that falls under
the category of "tough shit. "

1542
01:48:55,716 --> 01:48:57,510
We're all done here.

1543
01:49:12,233 --> 01:49:13,901
Here.
Thanks.

1544
01:49:43,348 --> 01:49:46,018
In the last two accounts, we're
only an hour different...

1545
01:49:46,894 --> 01:49:48,562
but it's another day.

1546
01:49:48,729 --> 01:49:49,730
It's tomorrow.

1547
01:49:50,856 --> 01:49:53,358
See, I love that.
I love that.

1548
01:49:54,735 --> 01:49:57,571
So, what have we got?
625 kilos?

1549
01:49:57,738 --> 01:49:59,573
Yeah, something like that.

1550
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:01,783
Shit. You know,
of all the people...

1551
01:50:01,950 --> 01:50:03,952
you and I should
know if electronic money

1552
01:50:04,077 --> 01:50:06,079
earns an extra
day of interest...

1553
01:50:06,246 --> 01:50:08,916
when it crosses
an international date line.

1554
01:50:09,082 --> 01:50:10,918
Right? I'm just saying.

1555
01:50:11,084 --> 01:50:12,920
That's a good question.

1556
01:50:15,214 --> 01:50:16,757
Why is there a fourth drum?

1557
01:50:18,258 --> 01:50:19,426
No reason.

1558
01:50:19,593 --> 01:50:21,220
It's just convenient.

1559
01:50:22,137 --> 01:50:23,388
Convenient?
Mm-hmm.

1560
01:50:23,555 --> 01:50:25,557
Yeah, maybe we have a traveler.

1561
01:50:25,724 --> 01:50:27,643
Like somebody, you wish
for them to go away...

1562
01:50:27,809 --> 01:50:30,271
so, you send them to America.
That's all.

1563
01:50:30,438 --> 01:50:31,439
Can I have a look?

1564
01:50:31,523 --> 01:50:32,524
You want to look?

1565
01:50:32,649 --> 01:50:33,983
Yeah.
Sick bastard.

1566
01:50:37,445 --> 01:50:38,905
Do you know who he is?

1567
01:50:39,072 --> 01:50:41,741
<i>No. Fuck, no.
He's some pinche pasajero.</i>

1568
01:50:44,285 --> 01:50:45,411
A passenger?

1569
01:50:45,578 --> 01:50:47,789
Yeah.
An immigrant.

1570
01:50:50,833 --> 01:50:53,503
So, it's just a way to
get rid of a body?

1571
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:54,921
Yeah.

1572
01:50:58,466 --> 01:50:59,467
From Mexico?

1573
01:50:59,634 --> 01:51:01,469
No,no,no.
Colombia.

1574
01:51:01,636 --> 01:51:03,304
He came all
the way from Colombia?

1575
01:51:03,388 --> 01:51:04,389
Mm-hmm.

1576
01:51:04,472 --> 01:51:05,515
What are you
going to do with him?

1577
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:07,016
Nothing.

1578
01:51:07,183 --> 01:51:08,434
He just goes
back in the truck?

1579
01:51:08,601 --> 01:51:10,186
Yeah. Goes back in the truck.

1580
01:51:10,353 --> 01:51:11,980
Then what?

1581
01:51:12,146 --> 01:51:13,481
Nothing. It's just normal.

1582
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,483
But they think
it's a fucking joke.

1583
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:18,695
They think it's funny, so they
do this shit to me, you know?

1584
01:51:18,987 --> 01:51:22,156
But in this business, you gotta
have a sense of humor, or else...

1585
01:51:26,995 --> 01:51:28,830
So, what happens to him?

1586
01:51:29,622 --> 01:51:31,291
Nothing. I told you...

1587
01:51:31,457 --> 01:51:33,377
they go back together
in the truck.

1588
01:51:33,544 --> 01:51:35,504
He's inside, they paint it,
he rides around.

1589
01:51:35,671 --> 01:51:38,007
They try to sell it at
auction maybe, maybe not.

1590
01:51:38,173 --> 01:51:40,342
He rides around some more,
sucking up the shit.

1591
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:44,138
Hey, welcome to America.
Huh?

1592
01:51:48,309 --> 01:51:51,687
Yes, but I can only tell you what
I already told our friend.

1593
01:51:51,854 --> 01:51:54,023
<i>There is no one to talk to.</i>

1594
01:51:54,982 --> 01:51:57,026
Could I come to The Florida?

1595
01:51:57,192 --> 01:51:59,028
<i>The Florida is closed.</i>

1596
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:03,365
I would do
whatever you suggest.

1597
01:52:03,532 --> 01:52:06,035
<i>I have no suggestions,
Counselor.</i>

1598
01:52:11,874 --> 01:52:13,667
We could meet someplace.

1599
01:52:13,834 --> 01:52:15,544
<i>We're meeting now.</i>

1600
01:52:20,132 --> 01:52:22,384
I'm not sure you
understand my position.

1601
01:52:22,551 --> 01:52:24,511
<i>But I do, Counselor.</i>

1602
01:52:24,678 --> 01:52:28,057
Actions create consequences
which produce new worlds...

1603
01:52:28,223 --> 01:52:30,184
and they're all different.

1604
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:34,564
Where the bodies are buried in the
desert, that is a certain world.

1605
01:52:34,731 --> 01:52:37,901
Where the bodies are simply left
to be found, that is another.

1606
01:52:38,693 --> 01:52:41,655
<i>And all these worlds,
heretofore unknown to us...</i>

1607
01:52:41,821 --> 01:52:44,157
<i>they must have always been
there, must they not?</i>

1608
01:52:46,242 --> 01:52:47,702
<i>I don't know.</i>

1609
01:52:49,204 --> 01:52:50,538
Did you say something?

1610
01:52:51,665 --> 01:52:53,667
I don't know what I was saying.

1611
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:55,585
<i>Counselor, at some point,</i>

1612
01:52:56,419 --> 01:53:01,257
you have to acknowledge the reality
of the world that you're in.

1613
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:03,385
There's not some other world.

1614
01:53:03,468 --> 01:53:06,012
<i>This is not a hiatus.</i>

1615
01:53:06,096 --> 01:53:07,430
Hiatus.

1616
01:53:10,934 --> 01:53:12,852
I believe the word is "hiatus".

1617
01:53:13,478 --> 01:53:15,897
Can you spell that for me,
please?

1618
01:53:16,251 --> 01:53:22,011
H - I - A - T - U - S.

1619
01:53:23,196 --> 01:53:25,448
Hiatus.
Thank you, Counselor.

1620
01:53:29,452 --> 01:53:30,954
Will you help me?

1621
01:53:31,121 --> 01:53:33,123
<i>I would urge you
to see the truth</i>

1622
01:53:33,289 --> 01:53:35,250
<i>of the situation you're in,
Counselor.</i>

1623
01:53:35,417 --> 01:53:37,628
That is my advice.

1624
01:53:37,795 --> 01:53:41,799
It is not for me to tell you what
you should have done or not done.

1625
01:53:42,758 --> 01:53:47,096
<i>The world in which you seek to
undo the mistakes that you made...</i>

1626
01:53:47,263 --> 01:53:51,016
<i>is different from the world
where the mistakes were made.</i>

1627
01:53:51,934 --> 01:53:54,520
You are now at the crossing.

1628
01:53:54,687 --> 01:53:58,566
And you want to choose, but
there is no choosing there.

1629
01:53:59,316 --> 01:54:01,402
<i>There's only accepting.</i>

1630
01:54:01,569 --> 01:54:05,239
<i>The choosing was
done a long time ago.</i>

1631
01:54:06,407 --> 01:54:08,117
Are you there, Counselor?

1632
01:54:08,784 --> 01:54:09,910
<i>Yes.</i>

1633
01:54:10,077 --> 01:54:11,746
I don't mean to offend you...

1634
01:54:11,912 --> 01:54:14,790
but reflective men
often find themselves...

1635
01:54:14,957 --> 01:54:17,835
at a place removed
from the realities of life.

1636
01:54:18,419 --> 01:54:21,547
In any case, we should
all prepare a place...

1637
01:54:22,006 --> 01:54:24,008
where we can
accommodate all the tragedies

1638
01:54:24,133 --> 01:54:26,135
that sooner or later
will come to our lives.

1639
01:54:26,302 --> 01:54:29,555
But this is an economy
few people care to practice.

1640
01:54:29,722 --> 01:54:32,475
Do you know
the words of Machado?

1641
01:54:32,641 --> 01:54:34,560
<i>I know his name.</i>

1642
01:54:38,565 --> 01:54:40,025
Lovely poet.

1643
01:54:41,818 --> 01:54:44,404
<i>Machado was
a schoolteacher...</i>

1644
01:54:44,571 --> 01:54:47,449
<i>and he married a young,
beautiful girl.</i>

1645
01:54:47,616 --> 01:54:49,826
<i>And he loved her very much.</i>

1646
01:54:49,993 --> 01:54:52,078
<i>And she died.</i>

1647
01:54:52,245 --> 01:54:54,956
<i>And then he became
a great poet.</i>

1648
01:54:55,874 --> 01:54:58,043
I'm not going to
become a great poet.

1649
01:54:58,210 --> 01:55:00,962
<i>No, perhaps not. But even
if you were to do so...</i>

1650
01:55:01,129 --> 01:55:02,506
<i>it would not help you.</i>

1651
01:55:03,548 --> 01:55:06,092
Machado would have
traded every word,

1652
01:55:06,218 --> 01:55:08,762
every poem,
every verse he ever wrote...

1653
01:55:09,513 --> 01:55:12,891
for one more hour
with his beloved.

1654
01:55:13,058 --> 01:55:15,644
And that is because
when it comes to grief...

1655
01:55:15,811 --> 01:55:18,063
the normal rules of
exchange do not apply,

1656
01:55:18,188 --> 01:55:20,398
because grief
transcends value.

1657
01:55:20,982 --> 01:55:25,695
<i>A man would give entire nations
to lift grief off his heart...</i>

1658
01:55:25,862 --> 01:55:29,574
and yet, you cannot buy
anything with grief.

1659
01:55:29,741 --> 01:55:33,245
Because grief is worthless.

1660
01:55:34,371 --> 01:55:36,790
Why are you telling me this?

1661
01:55:36,957 --> 01:55:41,712
<i>Because you continue to deny the
reality of the world you're in.</i>

1662
01:55:42,672 --> 01:55:45,758
<i>Do you love your wife so much,
so completely...</i>

1663
01:55:45,925 --> 01:55:49,929
that you would exchange places
with her upon the wheel?

1664
01:55:50,972 --> 01:55:54,100
And I don't mean dying,
because dying is easy.

1665
01:55:56,394 --> 01:55:59,397
Yes! Yes, damn you!

1666
01:56:02,567 --> 01:56:05,236
<i>Well, that is good
to hear, Counselor.</i>

1667
01:56:10,741 --> 01:56:12,618
What are you saying?

1668
01:56:14,328 --> 01:56:16,414
Are you saying
this is a possibility?

1669
01:56:16,956 --> 01:56:18,416
No.

1670
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,543
It's impossible.

1671
01:56:21,419 --> 01:56:23,713
You said I was that man...

1672
01:56:24,213 --> 01:56:25,590
at that crossing.

1673
01:56:25,756 --> 01:56:28,634
<i>Yes.
At the understanding...</i>

1674
01:56:28,801 --> 01:56:33,764
<i>that life is not
going to take you back.</i>

1675
01:56:35,558 --> 01:56:39,770
<i>You are the world you have created,
and when you cease to exist...</i>

1676
01:56:39,937 --> 01:56:44,026
<i>this world that you have created
will also cease to exist.</i>

1677
01:56:44,693 --> 01:56:47,404
But for those with the
understanding that

1678
01:56:47,529 --> 01:56:50,240
they're living the last
days of the world...

1679
01:56:50,407 --> 01:56:54,536
death acquires
a different meaning.

1680
01:56:55,954 --> 01:56:59,082
The extinction of all reality...

1681
01:56:59,249 --> 01:57:03,921
is a concept no resignation
can encompass.

1682
01:57:05,339 --> 01:57:09,259
<i>And yet, in that despair,</i>

1683
01:57:09,343 --> 01:57:12,095
<i>which is transcendent,</i>

1684
01:57:13,144 --> 01:57:17,741
you will find the ancient
understanding

1685
01:57:19,895 --> 01:57:25,776
that the philosopher's stone
will always be found despised

1686
01:57:25,859 --> 01:57:27,110
and buried in the mud.

1687
01:57:28,862 --> 01:57:32,324
<i>This may seem a small thing
in the face of annihilation</i>

1688
01:57:32,407 --> 01:57:34,326
<i>until annihilation occurs.</i>

1689
01:57:35,285 --> 01:57:40,707
And then, all the grand designs
and all the grand plans...

1690
01:57:40,874 --> 01:57:45,713
will be finally exposed and
revealed for what they are.

1691
01:57:47,215 --> 01:57:49,258
<i>And now, Counselor,</i>

1692
01:57:49,342 --> 01:57:52,220
<i>I have to go, because I
have to make other calls.</i>

1693
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:56,307
<i>If I have time, I think
I'll take a small nap.</i>

1694
01:58:07,402 --> 01:58:10,738
Welcome to London Heathrow,
Terminal 5.

1695
01:58:10,905 --> 01:58:13,908
<i>Please keep your bags with you
at all times.</i>

1696
01:58:14,075 --> 01:58:18,705
<i>Any unattended luggage will be
removed and may be destroyed.</i>

1697
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:35,263
I like the hat.

1698
01:58:35,346 --> 01:58:36,597
Thank you.

1699
01:58:39,517 --> 01:58:42,020
The International.
Of course.

1700
01:58:55,075 --> 01:58:56,076
Hello, madam.

1701
01:58:56,243 --> 01:58:57,369
Hi.

1702
01:58:57,911 --> 01:58:59,121
Checking in?

1703
01:59:03,042 --> 01:59:04,293
How are you doing?

1704
01:59:05,044 --> 01:59:06,086
Okay.

1705
01:59:08,589 --> 01:59:09,631
You're Canadian.

1706
01:59:10,591 --> 01:59:13,469
You saw my passport.
Where are you from?

1707
01:59:13,635 --> 01:59:15,137
New Mexico.

1708
01:59:16,889 --> 01:59:17,931
Have a drink with me.

1709
01:59:18,474 --> 01:59:19,641
What?

1710
01:59:22,311 --> 01:59:23,604
Have a drink with me.

1711
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:25,773
You're a masher.

1712
01:59:25,939 --> 01:59:28,984
A masher? Lord,
where did you hear that?

1713
01:59:29,151 --> 01:59:30,903
I'm teasing.

1714
01:59:31,820 --> 01:59:32,821
I think.

1715
01:59:51,257 --> 01:59:52,258
No.

1716
01:59:52,342 --> 01:59:53,510
Yes.

1717
02:00:01,101 --> 02:00:04,813
<i>Señor, I must close.</i>

1718
02:00:05,772 --> 02:00:06,856
I know.

1719
02:00:07,023 --> 02:00:08,983
You have no
place to go, maybe?

1720
02:00:12,028 --> 02:00:13,446
I fell asleep, I'm sorry.

1721
02:00:14,531 --> 02:00:15,949
There is no harm.

1722
02:00:16,116 --> 02:00:17,700
No harm.

1723
02:00:20,328 --> 02:00:22,330
That's a lovely thought.

1724
02:00:23,665 --> 02:00:25,500
A magical thought.

1725
02:00:29,003 --> 02:00:30,296
Good night.

1726
02:00:32,507 --> 02:00:36,511
It's very dangerous out there.
In the street.

1727
02:00:38,304 --> 02:00:39,722
I know.

1728
02:00:41,391 --> 02:00:44,894
If they hear somebody in the
street, they shoot them.

1729
02:00:45,061 --> 02:00:49,023
Then they turn on the light
to see who is dead.

1730
02:00:49,732 --> 02:00:51,068
Why do they do that?

1731
02:00:51,235 --> 02:00:52,570
To make a joke.

1732
02:00:52,862 --> 02:00:57,575
To show that death doesn't care.
That death has no meaning.

1733
02:00:58,075 --> 02:00:59,201
Do you believe that?

1734
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:00,911
No.

1735
02:01:01,078 --> 02:01:03,330
Of course not.

1736
02:01:03,497 --> 02:01:05,499
All my family is dead.

1737
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:07,835
I'm the one who
has no meaning.

1738
02:03:37,945 --> 02:03:39,655
<i>Please hang up
and try again.</i>

1739
02:03:39,739 --> 02:03:43,034
<i>If you need help, hang up
and dial your operator.</i>

1740
02:04:00,927 --> 02:04:02,929
So, you got the password?

1741
02:04:04,264 --> 02:04:05,599
Five digits.

1742
02:04:06,224 --> 02:04:07,184
Who's Rowena?

1743
02:04:07,267 --> 02:04:08,560
I don't know.

1744
02:04:08,810 --> 02:04:12,731
All right. Social security,
driver's license.

1745
02:04:13,607 --> 02:04:15,484
Can I ask you something?

1746
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:16,651
Sure.

1747
02:04:17,069 --> 02:04:19,780
I don't see what good this will
do unless you have the computer.

1748
02:04:24,493 --> 02:04:26,745
You and I are square.

1749
02:04:29,122 --> 02:04:31,291
So, are you planning
to see him again?

1750
02:04:32,084 --> 02:04:34,503
What would be the point?
He'll be broke.

1751
02:04:34,961 --> 02:04:36,463
Smart girl.

1752
02:04:37,798 --> 02:04:39,174
Or is it worse than that?

1753
02:04:42,594 --> 02:04:44,304
I don't want to get mixed up
in something heavy.

1754
02:04:44,471 --> 02:04:46,473
You already are.

1755
02:04:46,932 --> 02:04:49,142
How would you know he won't
come looking for you?

1756
02:04:49,643 --> 02:04:50,685
But he won't, will he?

1757
02:04:53,313 --> 02:04:54,689
No.

1758
02:04:55,190 --> 02:04:56,983
He won't.

1759
02:05:00,113 --> 02:05:01,489
Jesus.

1760
02:05:08,955 --> 02:05:09,997
Take the money.

1761
02:05:10,123 --> 02:05:11,624
I don't want it.

1762
02:05:12,333 --> 02:05:13,418
Please yourself.

1763
02:05:13,501 --> 02:05:14,669
I have to go.

1764
02:05:14,836 --> 02:05:16,379
You know what I like
about Americans?

1765
02:05:16,546 --> 02:05:17,713
No, what?

1766
02:05:18,506 --> 02:05:20,508
You can depend on them.

1767
02:05:29,976 --> 02:05:32,562
Thank you, Ray.
Okay. Take care.

1768
02:06:50,432 --> 02:06:53,810
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

1769
02:06:55,437 --> 02:06:56,521
Fuck you!

1770
02:06:56,605 --> 02:06:57,606
Drive.

1771
02:08:02,588 --> 02:08:03,756
There you go.

1772
02:08:07,469 --> 02:08:08,512
Drive.

1773
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:14,268
On my count.
One, two, three.

1774
02:08:36,123 --> 02:08:37,124
<i>Momento!</i>

1775
02:08:48,969 --> 02:08:50,012
Hey.

1776
02:09:50,949 --> 02:09:52,700
Oh, God!

1777
02:10:06,798 --> 02:10:08,758
No!

1778
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:32,533
Good evening.

1779
02:10:32,616 --> 02:10:34,285
Lovely to see you, madame.
Thank you.

1780
02:10:34,452 --> 02:10:36,328
Good evening, sir.
Follow me.

1781
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:06,358
<i>Bon appÃ©tit.</i>

1782
02:11:11,865 --> 02:11:12,949
It's good to see you.

1783
02:11:13,366 --> 02:11:14,618
You, as well.

1784
02:11:15,368 --> 02:11:16,703
How's Marisa?

1785
02:11:18,497 --> 02:11:20,040
She's fine.

1786
02:11:20,874 --> 02:11:22,375
You should come and see us.

1787
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:23,877
I know.

1788
02:11:27,464 --> 02:11:28,882
We should talk.

1789
02:11:29,049 --> 02:11:30,884
Yes. Of course.

1790
02:11:31,051 --> 02:11:33,261
We need to move the money
as soon as possible,

1791
02:11:33,386 --> 02:11:35,639
speaking as your banker.

1792
02:11:35,805 --> 02:11:37,057
Are you
returning to the States?

1793
02:11:37,224 --> 02:11:40,852
No, and I certainly
can't go to Mexico.

1794
02:11:41,394 --> 02:11:43,230
I'm thinking Hong Kong.
Really?

1795
02:11:43,563 --> 02:11:45,065
Mmm. You don't
speak the language.

1796
02:11:45,148 --> 02:11:46,191
I'm a quick study.

1797
02:11:46,358 --> 02:11:48,360
Well, I suppose you could simply
buy into the market there.

1798
02:11:48,527 --> 02:11:50,403
Yes, it's not a problem.
Cash?

1799
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:53,156
The easiest way to move cash
is in diamonds.

1800
02:11:53,323 --> 02:11:55,408
You can hold $20 million
in the palm of your hand.

1801
02:11:55,742 --> 02:11:58,662
Well, I suppose there's no problem
selling diamonds in China.

1802
02:11:59,663 --> 02:12:02,207
You can sell diamonds on Mars.

1803
02:12:03,875 --> 02:12:05,085
You need to get out, Michael.

1804
02:12:08,255 --> 02:12:10,757
If anything went wrong,
your name might come up.

1805
02:12:10,924 --> 02:12:12,092
That's right.

1806
02:12:12,259 --> 02:12:14,554
You're not really leaving
me a choice, are you?

1807
02:12:15,429 --> 02:12:16,847
You'll thank me.

1808
02:12:21,769 --> 02:12:23,271
And the cats?

1809
02:12:23,437 --> 02:12:27,942
Silvia died, and Raoul is
alive and well in Arizona.

1810
02:12:28,901 --> 02:12:30,570
I'll miss him.

1811
02:12:31,904 --> 02:12:34,282
I miss watching him
out on the high desert

1812
02:12:34,407 --> 02:12:36,784
bringing down jackrabbits
at 70 miles an hour.

1813
02:12:37,952 --> 02:12:39,453
I never tired of that.

1814
02:12:40,454 --> 02:12:43,457
To see quarry,
killed with elegance...

1815
02:12:43,624 --> 02:12:47,461
it's just... moving to me.

1816
02:12:48,129 --> 02:12:49,797
Is it sexual?

1817
02:12:50,590 --> 02:12:55,052
Yes, of course. A thing
like that is always sexual.

1818
02:12:56,262 --> 02:13:01,601
The hunter has grace,
beauty...

1819
02:13:01,767 --> 02:13:05,104
and purity of heart
to be found nowhere else.

1820
02:13:05,730 --> 02:13:10,318
You can make no distinction between
what they are and what they do.

1821
02:13:10,484 --> 02:13:12,653
And what they do is kill.

1822
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:17,326
We, of course,
are another matter.

1823
02:13:17,492 --> 02:13:21,455
It is our faintness of heart that
has driven us to the edge of ruin.

1824
02:13:23,165 --> 02:13:25,500
Perhaps you won't agree...

1825
02:13:26,501 --> 02:13:28,670
but nothing is
crueler than a coward.

1826
02:13:29,504 --> 02:13:31,840
And the slaughter to come...

1827
02:13:32,007 --> 02:13:34,134
is probably
beyond our imagining.

1828
02:13:35,177 --> 02:13:38,430
I think you've told me
more than I wish to know.

1829
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:41,516
Then I'll say no more.

1830
02:13:43,018 --> 02:13:45,854
Shall we think about ordering?

1831
02:13:46,813 --> 02:13:48,690
I'm famished.
