1
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Ivan,

2
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,000
Spasibo.

3
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Mein herr! Ach!

4
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
Jack Flack escapes.

5
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
How could
he escape?

6
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Look at
the dice.

7
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
So what?

8
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,200
24. Jack's agility
is 24. He escapes.

9
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
That's not fair.

10
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I got killed, and you
should have been dead.

11
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I'm not. Jack Flack
always escapes.

12
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
Dumb game.

13
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,400
You just got to develop
better moves, Kim, that's all.

14
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
You're getting there.

15
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,800
I don't believe this.
How can he do it, Morris?

16
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,000
I had 10 times as many
bullets as Jack Flack.

17
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Yeah, but Flack had the
ingenuity and the contacts, Kim.

18
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,600
It's better than
bullets sometimes.

19
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
Hey, don't feel bad.

20
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
I haven't been able
to beat him all summer.

21
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,600
What happens next,
Morris?

22
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's leave it
for now.

23
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
I want to think of
something really good

24
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
to get you with.

25
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Anyway, I want to
get back to my game.

26
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
Don't look at me.

27
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm sick of
getting killed.

28
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
We could trade.

29
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,400
I'll give you extra gas masks
and a bulletproof vest.

30
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
No way.

31
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,400
You never get hurt.
It's no fun.

32
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,600
Jack Flack always
escapes anyway.

33
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

34
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,400
Hey, guys, be careful
with those.

35
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
I just got them in.

36
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
This is Jack Flack
requesting an assignment.

37
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Over.

38
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Hello
everybody.

39
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Come on, Kim,
be serious.

40
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
You guys want
a real assignment?

41
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

42
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,000
You got
your bus passes?

43
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Ok, I want you to
go over to Textronics.

44
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Pick me up some catalogues
for the new 4200.

45
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,000
Come on, Morris.

46
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Give us
something exciting,

47
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
like Cloak and Dagger,

48
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
only for real.

49
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ok.

50
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I want you to infiltrate
their seventh level.

51
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,600
Then go to their
vending machine.

52
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
Pick me up
a pack of Twinkies.

53
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,800
There's a secret
message inside.

54
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Hmm.

55
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
Whatever you do,

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,800
don't let anybody
see you. Anybody.

57
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
You coming?

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Not if you're gonna be
embarrassing.

59
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I won't.

60
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Let's see.

61
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Grenade...

62
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
gun...

63
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,000
ammo.

64
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,400
Ok.

65
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
Now what
are you doing?

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Jack Flack says to always
keep your gun loaded.

67
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,600
Morris, could we try
these out?

68
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah. Just
don't break 'em.

69
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Time to go, Jack.

70
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,800
See you, Morris.

71
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, great.

72
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,200
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

73
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
Yeah, what?

74
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Come on, Kim.
Play right.

75
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
All right.

76
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,400
Lady Ace
to Jack Flack.

77
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Do you read me?

78
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Loud and clear.

79
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,200
Prepare to penetrate
the enemy stronghold.

80
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
Follow me in.

81
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,000
This is what I meant
by "embarrassing."

82
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Hey!

83
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,800
You proceed to floor 7
for Operation Catalog.

84
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
I'll get the secret
from the machine.

85
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Wait a minute.

86
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
I think that sentry
spotted us.

87
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
Davey, put that away.

88
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
Hi, kids.

89
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,800
You lost?

90
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,600
If you tell me
who you're looking for,

91
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
maybe I can help.

92
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We're looking
for Textronics.

93
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Ah. You're looking
for the Game Division?

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Seventh floor.

95
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,800
Thank you,
Officer.

96
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
We'll take
separate routes

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,800
just in case one of us
is neutralized.

98
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I'll take the fire stairs,
you take the elevator.

99
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,000
Good, 'cause I'm
not walking up.

100
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,600
Pardon me.

101
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What's
the matter now?

102
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,400
That guy had a gun, Kim,
and it was a real gun.

103
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, Davey, will
you stop it?

104
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Honest!
I saw a gun!

105
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,800
You're really
being a jerk.

106
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,200
Well, here. Take this
grenade just in case.

107
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Thanks, anyway.

108
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,000
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

109
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
Yeah, Davey,
what is it?

110
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,800
I'm almost
in position.

111
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
Give me
your location.

112
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,800
I'm already up here,
and I'm waiting for you.

113
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,400
Textronics.
Mr. Rice's office.

114
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
Ok. Start creating
a diversion.

115
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
I'll sneak out
the fire stairs

116
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,800
and hit the machine.

117
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,200
Davey, this
is embarrassing

118
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Maintain radio silence
from now on.

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
Over and out.

120
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,800
Don't let him
leave the building.

121
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
Rice...
moving to the elevator.

122
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Intercepting fully.

123
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Hello?

124
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Hello?

125
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Will there be
anything else today?

126
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,800
Ah, do you have
a food machine here?

127
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,000
Lady Ace,
Lady Ace, come in.

128
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
Excuse me.

129
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
Textronics.

130
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
Mr. Rice is
in a meeting.

131
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,400
I thought we were
maintaining radio silence.

132
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,200
Did you hear them?

133
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,800
No. I'm busy.
Now stop bugging me.

134
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,200
Uh, the vending machines
are right over there.

135
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
So your friend cut off
radio contact, did she?

136
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh. Hi, Jack.

137
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,800
Well, some people
just don't know

138
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,000
how to act on
a secret mission.

139
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,400
I guess we're better off

140
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
just handling this one
on our own.

141
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Like the Maracaibo assignment.
Remember that?

142
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,000
Back when I was known
as Agent X.

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,800
That was
a close one.

144
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,200
Yeah...

145
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah. There we were,

146
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,000
surrounded by hordes
of angry mercenaries.

147
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
All you had was
a ball of string

148
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
and a sealed I.O.U.
from the embassy.

149
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And then there was
a letter bomb.

150
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,400
Yeah, that's 'cause
I told you not to trust them.

151
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,200
That's what I mean
about working alone.

152
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
I guess
you're right.

153
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
Yeah...

154
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,200
Help...me.

155
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,800
Here. Here...

156
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Whatever happens,

157
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
don't let them get it.

158
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Tell the FBI...

159
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
1 million, 329--

160
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
Run!

161
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,600
Davey, what
are you doing?

162
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,000
They just killed a man,
now they're after me!

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
I got Morris'
Twinkie--

164
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,000
Help, police!
Murder!

165
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
What's the
problem, kid?

166
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,000
There's 2 men,
they're trying to kill me.

167
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
What men?

168
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,000
They're up there!
They just killed a man!

169
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,400
Call the police!

170
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,000
He was right here!
I saw him fall!

171
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I had to run
right by him!

172
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,600
You want to tell me
what is this all about?

173
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Well, these Nazis, or
some kind of bad guys,

174
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
they shot
this FBI man.

175
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,000
Nazis?

176
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,200
How should I know?
Maybe they were Russians,

177
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
but they shot him,

178
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,400
and he was bleeding,
and he fell.

179
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
I knew he was dead.

180
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,400
Look,
I'm not kidding you!

181
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,600
I can prove it.

182
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,400
He gave me this
secret cartridge--

183
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
No, no, no.

184
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,200
Don't trust him, Dave.

185
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
That's the first rule
of espionage.

186
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,000
Always stay true
to your source.

187
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,000
Secret what?

188
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Well?

189
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,400
Never mind.

190
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,400
Hi, Mr. Rice.
Hi, Purdy.

191
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Did you see anybody
on the terrace level?

192
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,800
No, not a soul.

193
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Hi.

194
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,600
We better hold him
for the police.

195
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
We better go talk
to the police.

196
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,400
Come on.

197
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Ok, folks,
step back.

198
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,200
Clear the area.

199
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,400
Thank you.

200
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,000
I better be
going now.

201
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,200
You gonna be
all right?

202
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,400
Yeah. I've got a key.

203
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,600
Ok.

204
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Davey, I've been calling
all over the place for you.

205
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Mr. Osborne,

206
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Lieutenant Fleming,
San Antonio PD.

207
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
Dad, I didn't do--

208
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,600
Just wait a minute,
ok? Let him talk.

209
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
What's--come on in.

210
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,000
Not at this time.

211
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I've got to keep an ear
out for the squawk box.

212
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh. Well, go on
to your room, Davey.

213
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Dad, I want to hear
what he has to say--

214
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Just go to your room,
Davey, all right?

215
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,600
What, uh...

216
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
What--what
happened?

217
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
Well, your son
created quite a stir

218
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,200
at the Tower Life
Building this morning

219
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,600
when he reported
a murder.

220
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,000
A murder?

221
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,200
That's right, sir.
We checked out his story

222
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
and found absolutely
no credence to it.

223
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
Then we tried
to bring him home,

224
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,200
but he refused to
divulge the whereabouts

225
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,400
of what he called,
um, "Headquarters."

226
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,600
Sorry, Officer,
but he does, uh,

227
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,000
do that sometimes.

228
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,200
We got them right
where we want them.

229
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,600
Huh?

230
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
Let 'em think
you're nuts.

231
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,600
See, if we're
gonna be heroes,

232
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
we got to keep
a low profile.

233
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,800
No cops, no dads,
we're on our own, pal.

234
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,200
There gonna be any
charges, or what?

235
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600
Not this time, sir,

236
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,200
but we do think that
you ought to consider

237
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
getting him some help.

238
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,600
I have.

239
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,400
For almost an hour,
all he would give us

240
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,200
is his name, rank,
and serial number.

241
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,600
The tougher we got,
the tougher he got.

242
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Good.

243
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,400
If it hadn't been
for the little girl,

244
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
we would've never
gotten him home.

245
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Officer, I...

246
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
They'll sing
a different tune

247
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
once you're a hero.

248
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
...stuff like this
with parents a lot.

249
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
He is a good boy.

250
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,000
He's just...

251
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,200
going through a real
tough time right now.

252
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,400
He lost his
mother recently.

253
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,200
I guess we're both
having a little difficulty

254
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
making an adjustment.

255
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,200
Well, I can say
one thing for him.

256
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,400
If we were at war,

257
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
I'd want him
on my side.

258
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
You ready to talk?

259
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Want to talk
about the murders?

260
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,800
They weren't murderers.
They were spies.

261
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
They'd gone there to
kill an FBI agent.

262
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,800
I just intercepted one
of their communications.

263
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,600
Anybody else see 'em?

264
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,800
If mom were here,
she'd believe me.

265
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,800
She probably would.

266
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
But she's not here,

267
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,200
and she's not
gonna be here.

268
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
We've gotta get
used to that.

269
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
I miss her.

270
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
I know.

271
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,400
We both miss her.

272
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,800
I bet she knows it.

273
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,400
I'll bet she can see us
right now, you know that?

274
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Listen,
I've got an idea.

275
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,800
Why don't you and me

276
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,400
call up Dr. Sullivan
tomorrow?

277
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
You just tell him
what you saw today.

278
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,600
Just--just to see what
he says about it.

279
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,200
Jack Flack was right.

280
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,800
You do think I'm crazy.

281
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,000
You still talking
to Jack Flack?

282
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,200
Sometimes.

283
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,200
Davey, you've
got to understand:

284
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,800
Jack Flack
is make-believe,

285
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800
just like all these
ridiculous games.

286
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
They don't make it
any easier for you

287
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,600
to get a grasp
on things.

288
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Want to see something?

289
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,800
See proof?

290
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,200
Let me show you.

291
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,400
This is what
the FBI man gave me.

292
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,200
Hey, come here.

293
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,400
There's something
coming on.

294
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
More Cloak and Dagger?

295
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
What did I just get
through telling you--

296
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Dad,
this is important.

297
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
Just wait a minute.
You'll see.

298
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,600
Oh, Davey...

299
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,400
Just give me
a chance.

300
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,600
A man was just
killed for this.

301
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Do you want me
to play it once?

302
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
All right, play it.
Play it one time.

303
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,400
See, that's Dr. Boom
and that's Jack Flack

304
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
going to the secret
underground bomb factory.

305
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,600
Have you seen this
or done this before?

306
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
Yeah. I played it
at Morris'.

307
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,600
Now, here we are.

308
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Get the guards.

309
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,000
Got one!

310
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
Ok, get the case...

311
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,000
I'd like to figure
this one out.

312
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,800
And I made it.

313
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,400
And where's the proof
you're talking about?

314
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
I don't know.

315
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,800
Maybe it's on
the next level.

316
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Now let's shut it off,
all right? Come on.

317
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
But I get another life.

318
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,400
Let's just shut it
off. That's enough--

319
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Dad!

320
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,600
I want you to
get ready for bed.

321
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,000
Can I just play
one more?

322
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Davey, I said no
and I mean no.

323
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Now,
get ready for bed.

324
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,600
I hate you.

325
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
I know you don't
mean that, son.

326
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,400
You don't
care about me.

327
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,000
Huh! You never
believe me.

328
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Davey,
when I was a kid,

329
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
I was exactly
like you are.

330
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,400
I wanted to be a hero.

331
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
That's why
I joined the Air Force.

332
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,800
So I could
be somebody.

333
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Let me tell you
something, Davey.

334
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Heroes don't
just shoot bad guys,

335
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
they--they put
supper on the table,

336
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,000
they fix bicycles,
they do boring things...

337
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
real things,
not make believe.

338
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,800
I hope
you'll understand that

339
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,000
when you get
a little bit older.

340
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Now, I'm going to
put these games away.

341
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,800
I don't want you
playing 'em anymore.

342
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Dad, if you'd just play
one with me sometime.

343
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Good night, Davey.

344
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,600
Not too smart for
a military man, huh?

345
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,800
Shut up.

346
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,800
Will you get that
for me, Davey?

347
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Hello?

348
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Is this
David G. Osborne?

349
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,200
Yes.

350
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400
Good.

351
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,800
Dad!
Yeah?

352
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,600
It's them!
It's the spies.

353
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,800
The ones
who killed the man!

354
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,000
Hurry!

355
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Hello.

356
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,200
They hung up.

357
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,400
What'd he say?

358
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Just asked
who I was.

359
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
Dad, they know
where I am.

360
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Ah, it's just a wrong number.
Come on, let's--

361
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No, it wasn't!

362
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,200
I know
it was them.

363
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,600
Come on, come on,
take it easy.

364
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Just go on to bed.
It's way past your bedtime.

365
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,000
Can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

366
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What?

367
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,600
Can I sleep in
your bed tonight?

368
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
What for?

369
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,800
Well, I don't think
those, uh,

370
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,200
guys will come in
when you're here.

371
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,600
You don't, eh?

372
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Ok, come on.

373
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Everything's
going to be ok, son.

374
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,400
Dad!

375
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
What is it, son?

376
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,200
Don't leave.

377
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Well, I've got
to go to work, son.

378
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,800
I don't have
any choice.

379
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,600
Well, they're just
waiting for you to leave

380
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
so they can get me.

381
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah...

382
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,800
Listen, I, um...

383
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
I talked to Dr. Sullivan
this morning,

384
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,200
and I made
an appointment

385
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,800
for us to see him
tomorrow, ok?

386
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,000
Humor him, Davey.

387
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,600
This turkey's
not gonna help us.

388
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,000
We're on our own.

389
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,200
And I got to...

390
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,000
I got to work
a double shift today

391
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,200
on account of
that big inspection

392
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I told you about,
but tomorrow I'm off

393
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
so I can go to
the doctor with you,

394
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,000
and you can tell him...

395
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,400
everything you told me
about those spies.

396
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,800
Can't I
go with you?

397
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Davey...

398
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Come on,
you're a big boy now.

399
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,800
I mean, you're old enough
to stay home alone

400
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,200
without kicking
a fuss, aren't you?

401
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,800
I'll tell you what:

402
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,600
Maybe next week we can get
you in that baseball camp.

403
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

404
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,800
Huh?

405
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,200
Ok.

406
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,600
If you need me, just call me
at the base, ok?

407
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,200
Lady Ace, Lady Ace,
come in.

408
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Kim, are you there?

409
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Kim, come in.

410
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Yeah, what?

411
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,800
Listen, we got an
assignment for today.

412
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,200
I don't want any more of
your stupid assignments.

413
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Come on, Kim, I'm
really in trouble.

414
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Good. You got me
in trouble yesterday.

415
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,800
Now what?

416
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
Remember the spies?

417
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,800
You mean the killers?

418
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
Uh, yeah. They're
coming to kill me.

419
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
They want the Cloak
and Dagger thing back.

420
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,600
I need you to come over.

421
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,800
What Cloak
and Dagger thing?

422
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,200
Can't tell you now.
It's top secret.

423
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,000
Tell him you're having
your breakfast

424
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,200
and you'll call
him back later.

425
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
My mom says
I got to go now.

426
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Wait.

427
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,800
I'm having my breakfast.
I'll call you back later.

428
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,200
Is he
always like that?

429
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,800
Usually.

430
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Doesn't it
drive you crazy?

431
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,200
He's the only boy
in the neighborhood

432
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,800
who isn't boring.

433
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Did I
teach you that?

434
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Well, what's
his father like?

435
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,000
Forget it.
He's not your type.

436
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,200
Wait a minute.

437
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,800
How on earth
would you know

438
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,200
who is or isn't
my type?

439
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,000
He's in the Army
or something.

440
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,000
Guess you're right.

441
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We are on our own.

442
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,800
I'll get it.

443
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,000
There's gotta be
something on this tape.

444
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,200
Probably encoded.

445
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,800
So what do we do?

446
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,000
Have it decoded, take it to
the FBI, and we'll be heroes.

447
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,200
How do we do that?

448
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
A good spy always knows

449
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,000
when to bring in
outside expertise.

450
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,800
Morris can do it.
He can do anything.

451
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,200
Don't tell him
too much.

452
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,000
Just enough
to get the job done.

453
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
We can trust Morris.

454
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
He's my friend.

455
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,000
Friendship is a luxury
a spy can't afford.

456
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
What do you mean?

457
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,000
Well, ok, if you
really think so.

458
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,400
Morris.

459
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,000
Thank you.

460
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,200
Morris.

461
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Where's my Twinkies?

462
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Guess what.

463
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,800
What, you made it
to the 17th level

464
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,000
of Cloak and Dagger?

465
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,200
No, Morris,
this is for real.

466
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,200
I got this real important tape
I wanted you to see.

467
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,400
Oh, yeah?

468
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,600
Yeah, it has some secret code
or something in it.

469
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,000
Will you take
a look at it?

470
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,600
Morris, are you
listening to me?

471
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,200
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Davey, I want to

472
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
have the Twinkies
or my money back.

473
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,800
What's this?

474
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
You tell me.

475
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Looks like a Cloak
and Dagger tape.

476
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Well, it's not.
Take a look at it.

477
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,200
What do you mean,
it's not?

478
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Who gave it to you?

479
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,600
This guy.

480
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,200
I can't tell you
any more than that.

481
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,600
Top secret, huh?

482
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,000
What do you
want me to do?

483
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,400
I don't know, Morris.

484
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
You're the genius
around here.

485
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,200
All right.
Let's have a look.

486
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,800
This microchip
doesn't belong here.

487
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
What?

488
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,200
Take a look.

489
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,400
Whoever put this in

490
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
really knew what
he was doing.

491
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Look at those
connections.

492
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,200
It could be used to
store information.

493
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,400
Input, output...

494
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,200
What kind of information?
Government plans, maybe?

495
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,600
It could be
anything really.

496
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,800
Tell you one thing,
whoever put this in

497
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,600
really went through
a lot of trouble.

498
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,200
Think you can
break the code?

499
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,000
The key is
how to get to it.

500
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I've got an idea.

501
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,800
The guy who gave it to me said
something about some numbers.

502
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
What numbers?

503
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,400
1 million...

504
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,000
329...something.

505
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,400
I bet you anything

506
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,000
that's the secret code
that we're looking for.

507
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Can you think
of anything else?

508
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,200
No.

509
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,600
Davey,
are you alone?

510
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,400
That reminds me,
Davey,

511
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,000
I want to get those
walkie-talkies back.

512
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Sure, Morris.

513
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,200
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

514
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm here.

515
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,600
Kim, where are you?

516
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
Your house.

517
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,400
Get out of there!

518
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
The spies are there!

519
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,200
Kim?

520
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,600
Seems we each
have something

521
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,200
the other wants,
don't we, kid?

522
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,400
Yeah.

523
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,400
We might consider a trade.
How's that sound?

524
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Just leave her alone.
She doesn't know anything.

525
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,200
She does now.

526
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,600
Do you know the
Japanese sunken gardens?

527
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah.

528
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,200
Good.

529
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,400
We'll meet you
there at noon.

530
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,000
If you tell anybody
about this,

531
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,200
we'll break your
little friend in half.

532
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,600
Don't give it
to 'em, Davey.

533
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,400
Rule number 2: Never, never
play by the enemy's rules.

534
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,000
I have to give
them something.

535
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,400
I couldn't
take that.

536
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
We do it
all the time.

537
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,200
It's called, um...

538
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
commandeering necessary
mission equipment.

539
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Stop right there.

540
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,200
Cut the crap, kid.
Give me the tape.

541
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,400
Come any closer and you're
gonna be diving for it.

542
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Now, are we
gonna make a trade

543
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,400
or are we gonna start
dropping things?

544
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,600
Davey!

545
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,600
Why do you want it
so bad?

546
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,800
It's just a kid's game.

547
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Well, let's just say
I'm a kid at heart.

548
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,600
Why don't you
go buy your own?

549
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,200
They don't cost much.

550
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
Look, kid, don't
outsmart yourself.

551
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,400
I got
a couple of friends

552
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,200
and we play, too,
you know.

553
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
If I don't hand that
over to them by 5:30,

554
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,400
your little friend there
is gonna die.

555
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,200
All right,
just put it down,

556
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,400
and I'll let her go.

557
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,200
You let Kim go first.

558
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Sure.

559
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Anything you say.

560
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
Your turn.

561
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,400
Freeze, turkey!

562
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,200
Take my advice.
Don't follow us.

563
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,800
Otherwise,
I'll have to use this.

564
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,600
Little punk!

565
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
What?

566
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Boy, am I glad
to see you!

567
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Come on!

568
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
It's the wrong one!

569
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh, what's going on?

570
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Hurry up!
Let's get out of here!

571
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,600
Thank you.

572
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,600
Thank you.

573
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,800
Thanks, Davey.

574
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,400
What for?

575
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,600
You saved my life.

576
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,800
What were you doing
in my house anyway?

577
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,600
I thought
you weren't coming over.

578
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,600
I wasn't,
but then I felt bad

579
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,800
'cause I hurt
your feelings.

580
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
I was just mad

581
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,600
'cause you got me in
trouble yesterday,

582
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,400
and I thought
you were dumb

583
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,800
because of all
that murder stuff.

584
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,400
I never thought
it could be real.

585
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,600
Me, neither.

586
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,400
I'm really sorry,
Davey.

587
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
That's ok, Kim.

588
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,600
It's gonna be
all right.

589
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Uh-oh!

590
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm gonna get the tape now.

591
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,400
We have no further use for
the kid, do you understand?

592
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,600
Yes,
I understand.

593
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,600
We've got to
get out of here.

594
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,000
I'll make 'em
follow me.

595
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You get to Morris'
as quickly as you can,

596
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,400
and tell him
what's happened.

597
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,800
But they'll kill you
if they catch you.

598
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
No, they won't.
I'm the only one

599
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,600
who knows where
the real tape is.

600
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,800
Sir, uh, I got
to get off here.

601
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,400
Sorry, junior. We're not
allowed to stop along here.

602
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,000
But it's an emergency.

603
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's only 3 blocks to the bus
station and everybody gets off.

604
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,600
But I feel sick...

605
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
What?

606
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,800
Yeah, like I'm
gonna throw--Ulp!

607
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,200
Run, Davey! Run!

608
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,400
Why is he
shooting at me?

609
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,600
He must've found out
where the cartridge is.

610
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,600
1 million,

611
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,400
329...

612
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
That's it.

613
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
I'll be right there!

614
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,600
The following material

615
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,600
is for A-4 security
clearance personnel only.

616
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,600
It is a federal crime
to view such material

617
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,000
without proper
authorization.

618
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,800
Bingo.

619
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,400
I said I'd be
right there.

620
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,200
Looking for
something?

621
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,000
Someone's trying
to kill me.

622
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Well, uh,

623
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,600
why don't you
kill them first?

624
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,200
Don't encourage
him, Henry.

625
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Your food's
getting cold.

626
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,800
Would you
please go away?

627
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,000
Listen, I'm trying
to contact the FBI.

628
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Would you help me?

629
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,600
Get me a direct line
to J. Edgar Hoover.

630
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,000
This is an emergency.

631
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,600
Hoover's dead,
Henry.

632
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,200
Oh, my God,
they've gotten Hoover!

633
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,800
Now we're all goners!

634
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,200
Sorry, kid.
Can't help you.

635
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,800
Stand still, Davey.

636
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,200
They wouldn't dare
shoot at you

637
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,800
with all these
people around here.

638
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,200
In fact, the more people,
the better.

639
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,600
Over there.

640
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Thank you.
Enjoy your ride.

641
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,600
One child?

642
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,200
Uh...yes, ma'am.

643
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,000
That'll be
50 cents.

644
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,200
Thank you.
Enjoy your ride.

645
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Thanks.

646
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,000
One adult,
2 children.

647
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,800
There he is.

648
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,600
Let's get him.

649
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,800
I'll get him.

650
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
No, just get
in line. Get in line.

651
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,000
Hey, buddy,
wait your turn.

652
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,000
I'll go get him
out of there.

653
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,200
No, no, just
take it easy now.

654
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,000
Not now.

655
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,000
Tickets, please.

656
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,200
Thank you.

657
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,200
Your ticket, son.

658
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,800
Hey, here you go.

659
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Sorry, sir.

660
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,200
All full. You'll have to
wait for the next boat.

661
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,800
We want this one.

662
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm sorry, I can't take
any more passengers.

663
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,600
There'll be another boat
in 10 or 15 minutes.

664
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,200
Howard...Howard,

665
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,400
my wallet's gone!

666
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,000
Are you sure?

667
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,200
Of course I'm sure!

668
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,400
Don't panic.
Don't panic.

669
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,200
We'll go back over every
step we've been over

670
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,800
and see if we can
find it somewhere.

671
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Come on!

672
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,200
Hurry!

673
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,400
Welcome aboard,
ladies and gentlemen.

674
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,200
My name is Hal.

675
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,800
Now, our tour through the
Downtown San Antonio River

676
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,800
shall take approximately
25 to 30 minutes.

677
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Now, if you have
any questions

678
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
or anything you'd like to
ask me as we go along,

679
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,200
please do not hesitate
to do so.

680
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,000
I'm gonna get
close to the boy.

681
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,200
When I give you the signal,
create a diversion.

682
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,200
How?

683
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,200
I don't care how,

684
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,000
just as long as people
aren't looking at me.

685
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,200
Sir, would you
kindly have a seat?

686
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,000
You're supposed
to sit down.

687
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,600
Thank you.

688
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,200
Ladies
and gentlemen,

689
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,000
I'd like to call
your attention

690
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,800
to the building coming up
here to the left-hand side

691
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,800
which is the Ahmanson
River Theatre.

692
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,200
Parties and fiestas are held
there almost every day

693
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,600
during the summer months...

694
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,800
George.

695
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
What?

696
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,200
Look.

697
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,200
Look at them.

698
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
Sit down.

699
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,400
What's wrong, boy?

700
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,000
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you, ma'am.

701
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,200
Try me.

702
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,800
That man over there
is trying to kill me.

703
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,400
Sir, uh...

704
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,800
please sit down.

705
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,800
Move!

706
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,000
Why?

707
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,800
Because I said so.
Now move.

708
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,200
Don't be ridiculous.

709
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,800
Looks like a pervert,
if you ask me.

710
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,000
George, we've got to
do something about this.

711
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,200
What?

712
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,800
The building here
to my right-hand side

713
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,000
is the old
San Antonio Library

714
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,800
which contains the Huntsberg
Circus Collection,

715
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,000
with 20,000 exhibits depicting
American circus life.

716
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
The building that you see
straight ahead

717
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,200
is the Power
and Light Building.

718
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
Fire!
Where?

719
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,400
There!
In the engine!

720
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,200
Everybody back
to your seats, please,

721
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,000
and don't panic!

722
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,200
Go back to your seats,
everybody, please.

723
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
Thank you.

724
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,200
I'm sorry.

725
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Sir.

726
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,000
Why don't you guys
sit down

727
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,400
and quit
rocking the boat?

728
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,200
Yeah!
Sit down!

729
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,200
It's for
your own safety.

730
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,000
Please sit down.

731
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,200
We'll continue
the tour.

732
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Morris!

733
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Kim!

734
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
What happened
to you?

735
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,400
Nothing.
Where's Morris?

736
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,000
I don't know,
but look.

737
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,400
Davey,
do you think they...

738
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,200
No. Morris is
too smart for them.

739
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,400
We'll find him.

740
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,600
I think
he's already dead.

741
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,000
Shut up!
You don't know that!

742
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,400
I'm sorry.

743
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,200
What do we do now?

744
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,400
No use calling my dad.

745
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,000
Why don't you call your mom
and tell her

746
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Rice is going to do something
with the tape at 5:30?

747
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,400
Make her
call the police.

748
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,600
Even if she
doesn't believe you,

749
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
we need a grown-up.

750
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,200
Ok. What are you
going to do?

751
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,600
I'm going to try to
find Rice and stop him.

752
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,200
How?

753
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,400
I don't know yet.

754
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Well, you going to
stand here all day?

755
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,400
I'm waiting
for the light

756
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,200
to change.
Come on.

757
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,200
They won't hit you if
you just keep moving.

758
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,200
Crazy kid!

759
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,400
He said he had to be
somewhere at 5:30.

760
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,200
Means he'll probably
take his car.

761
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,600
There. "Textronics."

762
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,600
"Rice."

763
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
There's no place
to hide in there.

764
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,000
Open the trunk.

765
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,400
What's the matter?

766
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
Tough.

767
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
It's now or never.
Come on.

768
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,600
In there?

769
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,600
Hurry up.
Hold it down.

770
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,600
Don't close it shut.
Just hold it down.

771
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,400
Jack?

772
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
Agent X, help.

773
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,200
Help me.
Get him off me.

774
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,600
Isn't it crowded enough
for you in here?

775
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,600
Here.

776
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
He was my friend.

777
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,400
How could they
do that to him?

778
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,200
I guess he just
wasn't good enough.

779
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,800
Yeah, but they didn't
have to kill him.

780
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,600
When you've been playing
this game as long as I have,

781
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
you get used to
this kind of thing.

782
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,200
We've stopped.

783
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,600
Better see where we are.

784
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,400
What happens now?

785
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
We just wait
a couple minutes.

786
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,200
I'll walk over there
and make the drop.

787
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,200
So who gets
the game?

788
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,800
I don't know, and I
don't want to know.

789
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,800
We just leave the case,
we wait a few minutes,

790
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,400
take the money.

791
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,800
Only thing I know about
these people is one of them's

792
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,400
missing a couple fingers
from his right hand.

793
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,800
Well, remember
the Alamo, boys.

794
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,200
Sure as hell
don't tell you much.

795
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,400
Enough.

796
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,800
It's time to go.

797
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,600
Remember, you can win or lose
the game right here.

798
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,400
...taxation
without representation.

799
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,800
In fact,
they were quite angry,

800
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,400
but they did not
want to fight Santa Ana.

801
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,600
Instead they
tried to negotiate,

802
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,800
content being
citizens of Mexico.

803
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,400
All they wanted
was the reinstatement

804
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
of the constitution
and taxes lifted.

805
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,800
In 1835,
negotiations broke down,

806
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,800
and the Texans began
to talk revolution.

807
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,400
General Santa Ana
heard this rumor and...

808
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,800
The souvenir shop is
right through there.

809
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,000
Thank you.

810
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,600
How much time do we have
before that tour bus leaves?

811
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,000
Oh, we've got time.

812
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Let's drop on
by the shop.

813
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Well, look who's here.

814
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,600
Last time I saw you,
you were jumping off a boat.

815
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,800
Were you feeling
a little seasick?

816
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,200
I'm hiding from
that man over there.

817
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Oh, it's somebody
new this time.

818
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,200
Now, isn't it about time

819
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,800
you told me
what this is all about?

820
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

821
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,200
the Alamo will be
closing in 2 minutes.

822
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,800
Our young friend
seems to be

823
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,400
in some sort
of trouble again.

824
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,600
Now, here,
just a minute.

825
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,600
What is your name?

826
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,200
Davey.

827
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,800
Not Davy Crockett
by any chance?

828
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,400
I really have to
go now.

829
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,000
It's a matter of
national security.

830
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,400
Will everyone please exit
through the front door?

831
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,400
What do you think?

832
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,400
I think the boy
needs our help.

833
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,000
Hey, stop that kid!

834
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,600
He's stealing
somebody's bag! Get him!

835
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,400
You got
a hell of a nerve, kid,

836
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,000
stealing inside
the Alamo.

837
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,400
I didn't steal it!

838
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,600
He didn't steal
anything, Officer.

839
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,800
He took this.

840
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,400
Well, that's just
a simple mistake.

841
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
I sent the boy in to
pick up my camera case,

842
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,600
and he took
the wrong one.

843
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,600
Hey!

844
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,600
This yours?

845
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,600
Well, come and get it.

846
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,800
Why don't you take
the boy over to the car

847
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,800
while I straighten
this out?

848
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,000
But that one has

849
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
a secret
cartridge in it!

850
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,800
Come on.

851
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,800
Don't worry
about it.

852
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,800
George will

853
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,800
take care of
everything.

854
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,600
The car's
over here.

855
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,400
Now, don't you
fret yourself.

856
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,600
George will take
care of everything.

857
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,800
He's very good at that.

858
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,400
He's giving him
the camera case!

859
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,600
He is?

860
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,400
Well, if he did, he had
a reason for doing it.

861
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,800
Slide over.

862
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,000
That's it.

863
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,600
This what you're
so worried about?

864
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,600
No, sir.

865
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
It was the case
you gave the other man.

866
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,800
That was the one
with the plans in it.

867
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,200
What makes you
so sure

868
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,600
I gave the wrong
case back?

869
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Pardon?

870
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,400
Why don't you open
it and find out?

871
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,200
You got it!

872
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,600
George always makes things
turn out right.

873
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,000
But how'd you do it?

874
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,400
I just gave that man

875
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,400
my camera case
in its place.

876
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,000
He never noticed
the difference.

877
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,600
Now, do you mind
telling us

878
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,800
what this
is all about?

879
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,000
After all, I sacrificed
my good camera

880
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,400
to save your
Cloak and Dagger tape.

881
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,600
It isn't just
a Cloak and Dagger tape.

882
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,000
There's an extra
microchip in here.

883
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,600
What was that man
doing with it

884
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,600
at the Alamo?

885
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,600
Said he had to give it
to some foreign spy.

886
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,600
No!

887
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,600
Really?

888
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,200
Did he say what
the spy looked like?

889
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,800
Only that he had
2 fingers missing.

890
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,200
How exciting!

891
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,600
May I see the tape,
Davey?

892
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
Sure.

893
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,600
Something wrong, Davey?

894
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,600
It's all right.

895
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,800
Such a clever
little boy.

896
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,600
Don't you think so,
George?

897
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,200
I wish we could take him
to Mexico City with us.

898
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,600
I made an arrangement
with Rice.

899
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,200
He's going to take care
of him for us

900
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,600
on our way
to the airport.

901
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,600
I don't like him, and I
don't like his methods,

902
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,000
and I don't like
those 2 thugs of his.

903
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,200
I made it
very clear to him

904
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,000
that we're
very displeased

905
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,800
with this whole mess.

906
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,000
He won't dare make
another mistake.

907
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,800
Not if he wants
to do business with us.

908
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,000
I made that
very clear.

909
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,600
What time's
our flight?

910
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,000
Midnight.

911
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,800
We better check out.
I'm afraid we won't be able

912
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,000
to use
our dinner reservations.

913
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,600
What a nuisance.

914
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,600
Wake up.
Somebody's coming.

915
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,600
Where are we?
I can't see a thing.

916
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,600
Right back where
you put us.

917
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,000
Hey, pop the trunk,
will you?

918
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,600
Better play dead
or you will be.

919
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,000
That kid is
still out cold.

920
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,600
You want to kill him now

921
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,600
or wait till
the chloroform wears off?

922
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,600
Wait till we get
to the desert.

923
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,800
What's taking
Rice so long anyway?

924
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,200
It can't take him 2 hours
to divide up the money.

925
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,000
I think we
should get extra

926
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
for killing the kid.

927
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,600
You're right.

928
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,200
Let's go
hurry him up.

929
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,800
We'll never
get out of here.

930
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,200
Stay cool.
I'm thinking.

931
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,600
What are we
going to do?

932
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,600
Open the door.

933
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,600
Wait a minute.

934
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,200
What are you doing?

935
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,600
There's
a phone here.

936
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,000
Let's get out of here.

937
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,600
I'm calling Kim.

938
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,000
We better get out of here
and find some weapons.

939
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,000
Mom?

940
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
No, Kim, it's me.

941
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,200
Have you told
your mom yet?

942
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,400
No, she hasn't
come home yet.

943
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,400
She left a note,

944
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,400
but I can't read
her writing.

945
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,000
Listen, you got to get
to the airport right away.

946
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,400
The spies
have the tape.

947
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,600
They're kind of old.
A man and lady.

948
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,000
She only has 3 fingers.

949
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,400
Where are you?

950
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,200
I'm in a car.

951
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,000
Listen,
they're catching a plane

952
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,400
to Mexico City
at midnight.

953
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,600
How am I supposed to get
to the airport?

954
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Use your bus pass.

955
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,200
Duck!

956
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,800
I want you boys
to pay attention.

957
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,200
You do what I tell you.

958
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,200
Keep your mouths shut.

959
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,800
There's a lot more where
that came from.

960
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,200
What about the girl?
You want us to get her, too?

961
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,000
No. I already
took care of that.

962
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
What's that?

963
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,600
Garage door
opener.

964
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,400
What are you going to do,
crush her with a garage door?

965
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,800
Not quite.

966
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
This is a trigger
for a clock.

967
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,400
It'll set off
enough plastique

968
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,600
to blow up her and
half her neighborhood.

969
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,400
You might have
told us.

970
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,800
We could have been
blown up with her.

971
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,400
That's why
I used a timer.

972
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,200
I told that kid,

973
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,800
"If you cross me,
she's going to die."

974
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,400
So now,
in exactly one hour,

975
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,400
our little friend's
gonna have

976
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,800
a very short,
very loud nightmare.

977
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,400
That will
be midnight.

978
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,200
Yeah. I got to
call Kim.

979
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,000
Go get the van.

980
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Let's get these bodies
out of my trunk.

981
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,800
Not now you don't.

982
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,800
Haverman's
got the key.

983
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,400
I'll pop it open
from the glove compartment.

984
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,800
That's all right.
I've got mine.

985
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,400
He was in there
5 minutes ago.

986
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,000
Great, Alvarez.

987
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,800
Haverman,
the kid's gone.

988
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,800
All right,
let's get out of here.

989
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,200
What?

990
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You got to tell me
how to drive this thing.

991
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I don't know.
This is a real car.

992
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Ohh!

993
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,800
Ok. So much for backing up.

994
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,800
Let's try forward.

995
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Peel out, Davey.

996
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,400
Not bad
for a first lesson.

997
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,800
Don't shoot
at my car.

998
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,800
What are you, crazy?

999
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,400
Well, that pretty well
covers parking.

1000
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,000
Give me that.
Go get the van.

1001
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,000
Let's go.

1002
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,000
You're doing
just fine, Davey.

1003
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Push the pedal
to the metal!

1004
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,000
Whoa!

1005
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,200
Take a right here,
Davey.

1006
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,800
Ooh!

1007
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,200
Good. Excellent.

1008
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,400
Sweeper.

1009
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,000
Left, Davey.
The sweeper! The sweeper!

1010
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,400
Road hog!

1011
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,800
Construction!

1012
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,400
Kim's already left.

1013
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,000
She's safe.
Come on, let's go.

1014
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
What if they planted
the bomb on her?

1015
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,400
How?

1016
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,400
Lady Ace.
Lady Ace, come in.

1017
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,800
Hello, Davey.

1018
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,600
Hello.
Can you hear me?

1019
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,400
Why won't she answer?

1020
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,000
She probably dropped
her walkie-talkie.

1021
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,200
Walkie-talkie.

1022
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,400
Cheap thing.

1023
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,400
We got to save Kim!

1024
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,400
Right there!
Uh-oh.

1025
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,200
First we got to find
some hardware

1026
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,000
and blast
these guys.

1027
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,200
Come on.

1028
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,200
I'm calling Dad.

1029
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,400
That guy thinks
you're a nutcase.

1030
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,600
Come on.
Get out of here.

1031
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,000
Come on!

1032
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,600
He's gone.

1033
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,600
No kidding, Alvarez.

1034
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,200
Give me the case.

1035
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,600
All right, you stay
with the van.

1036
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,600
We'll go on foot.

1037
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,600
He can't have
gotten very far.

1038
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,200
Come on. Let's go.

1039
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,400
This is starting
to get good.

1040
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,400
What?

1041
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,000
Just like
Cloak and Dagger.

1042
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,400
They're trying
to kill us.

1043
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,600
They can't kill me.
They can't see me.

1044
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,400
They can kill me.

1045
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,600
Not if you're
good enough.

1046
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,400
That's what this game
is all about, right? Right?

1047
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,600
Kelly Field.

1048
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,000
Uh, yes. I'd like
to speak to

1049
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,600
Master Sergeant
Hal Osborne, please.

1050
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,000
It's his son calling.

1051
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,200
Just a minute.

1052
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,000
Come on. You're wasting
valuable combat time.

1053
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,400
Yeah, thanks.

1054
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,000
Hello.

1055
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Dad, you got
to help me.

1056
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,600
Davey,
why aren't you in bed?

1057
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,000
The spies,
they planted a bomb

1058
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
in Kim's
walkie-talkie,

1059
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,200
and she doesn't
even know it.

1060
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,400
Hang up.
Let's go.

1061
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
I told you
I didn't want you

1062
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,000
to get into those games.
You understand that?

1063
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,200
Dad,
this is no game.

1064
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,000
Now, I need
your help.

1065
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Davey, look,
I got a rush job here.

1066
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I do not have time--

1067
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Would you listen to me?

1068
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,200
They're trying
to take the plans

1069
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,600
out of the country
at midnight.

1070
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,400
Just calm down.

1071
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,200
I don't want you
to get worked up again.

1072
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,400
I'll be home just
as soon as I can.

1073
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,000
What did I tell you?
He's useless.

1074
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,200
Dad, I'm not home.

1075
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,400
Now, please, just
listen to me for once.

1076
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,400
I promise you
I'm telling the truth.

1077
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,400
Now, you don't have
to worry about me,

1078
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,800
but get to Kim before
the bomb goes off

1079
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,800
at midnight.

1080
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,400
What do you mean you're
not home? Where are you?

1081
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,400
I don't know. I'm in
a telephone booth.

1082
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,400
Davey,
now listen carefully.

1083
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,200
I want you to stay right
right where you are

1084
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,800
and don't get out
of that phone booth.

1085
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,600
Davey?

1086
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,200
What's
with him?

1087
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,600
One down
and two to go.

1088
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,200
Come on.
Get the gun.

1089
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
No.

1090
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,600
Davey, come on.
Get with it.

1091
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,600
If you're going
to win this game,

1092
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,800
you got to take advantage
of breaks like this.

1093
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,200
Get the gun.

1094
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,200
We got to get
across town

1095
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,400
and get a bus
to the airport.

1096
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,400
Davey!

1097
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,600
Along the river.
It's the fastest way.

1098
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,600
Play right!

1099
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,200
11:35.

1100
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,600
I'm not going
to make it in time.

1101
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,200
You're going to have to
take these guys out.

1102
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,600
You know that,
don't you?

1103
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,800
All right, it's time for
the heavy artillery.

1104
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,800
Let me have it.

1105
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,600
You got it.

1106
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,400
Now just wait right here
and take them out.

1107
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,800
I don't want
to kill anybody.

1108
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
You know the rules.

1109
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,400
You're supposed
to take out the obstacles

1110
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,600
before reaching
the objective.

1111
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,400
Can't just go right for
the objective. That's no fun.

1112
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,000
Fun?

1113
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
We've got 24 minutes

1114
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,400
before the bomb
goes off.

1115
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,400
That's why you have
to take them out.

1116
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,400
Look, how many people

1117
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,600
have I killed for you
over the years?

1118
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,600
And now you're saying
you don't want to play?

1119
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,600
Now, come on, this is
Cloak and Dagger for real.

1120
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,800
It's what
you always wanted.

1121
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,400
Yeah, but I don't have
a gun or a knife

1122
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,600
or anything.

1123
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,000
The Crossfire Gambit.

1124
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,600
Remember
the Crossfire Gambit?

1125
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,400
Now go back down there
and hide.

1126
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,600
Wait till the first guy
passes you.

1127
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,400
Then get Rice's attention
and lead his fire.

1128
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,000
You understand?

1129
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,600
Davey, if you don't
save Kim,

1130
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,800
who's going to?

1131
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,400
Ok.

1132
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,400
Good luck.

1133
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,600
Hey, Ricey!
What's the matter?

1134
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,000
Can't shoot straight?

1135
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,800
Good work, Davey.

1136
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,000
Now pick up the gun.

1137
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,600
He's dead.

1138
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,600
Never mind that.
You're winning.

1139
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,600
Pick it up.
Come over here.

1140
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,600
My dad was right.

1141
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,400
I don't want to
play anymore.

1142
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,600
Davey, don't chicken out
now! Come on!

1143
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,600
Hurry up.

1144
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,200
Good boy.

1145
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,800
Now hide behind
this tree.

1146
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,800
Wait, Davey!

1147
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,600
It's a dead end!

1148
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,000
Don't come any closer,
or I'll shoot.

1149
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,800
Sure you will...

1150
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,800
with red ink.

1151
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,200
Only this one
shoots real bullets.

1152
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,400
I'm warning you.

1153
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,600
This is not
a water pistol.

1154
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,000
Neither is this.

1155
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,600
I could turn you
into shredded meat

1156
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,600
in about 3 seconds with
this baby if I wanted to.

1157
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,800
But you've been
a real pain in the neck,

1158
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,800
so I'm not going
to be that nice.

1159
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,600
You know what
I'm going to do, boy?

1160
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,000
I'm going to blow
both your kneecaps off.

1161
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,600
It won't kill you,

1162
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,600
but it'll hurt worse than
any dying you can imagine.

1163
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,600
Then you know what
I'm going to do to you, huh?

1164
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,600
Shoot him, Davey.

1165
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,400
Shoot him.

1166
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,600
I'm going to shoot you
in the stomach.

1167
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,600
Then when you beg for me
to finish the job,

1168
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,400
I won't do it.

1169
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,800
I'm just going
to watch you die...slowly.

1170
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,000
Shoot.

1171
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,600
Pull the trigger.

1172
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,000
Please stop. I don't
want to shoot you.

1173
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,200
But I want
to shoot you.

1174
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,600
Kill him.

1175
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,600
The guy's a jerk!
Kill him!

1176
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,000
All right, I'll show you
what a real hero would do.

1177
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,200
Watch this.

1178
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,200
Just get him to
shoot over here, ok?

1179
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,800
Agent X will bounce
the bullets

1180
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,800
right back at him.

1181
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,000
Come on.

1182
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Come on, turkey, shoot.
Come on.

1183
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,800
Right here. Hit me!

1184
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,000
Jack, don't!

1185
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:08,200
No!

1186
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,600
Jack...

1187
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,800
Good work, Davey.

1188
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,000
You won.

1189
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
You're not dead!

1190
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
No, he never
touched me.

1191
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,600
I guess this thing
doesn't stop real bullets.

1192
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,000
He could see you.

1193
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,200
I doubt if he had
the imagination.

1194
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,800
Anyway, who cares?

1195
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,000
You're a hero.

1196
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,600
Hey, Davey.

1197
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:07,600
Look, you killed the bad guys,
you won the game.

1198
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,800
How do you feel?

1199
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,000
That wasn't fair.

1200
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,200
You tricked me!
You made me kill him.

1201
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,200
It was a clear case
of self-defense.

1202
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,800
Come on. Let's go
to the airport.

1203
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,600
I don't want
to play anymore!

1204
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,000
I see.

1205
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,400
Why do kids
always say that?

1206
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,400
Your father
said the same thing.

1207
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,400
After all those games of
Cowboys and Indians...

1208
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,400
you get tired
of make believe,

1209
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,800
you break your toys.

1210
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
Damn.

1211
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,400
He did hit you.

1212
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,400
I'm ok.
Come on. Let's go.

1213
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,400
But you're bleeding.

1214
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,400
I'm ok. Come on.

1215
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I'll tell you what,
Davey.

1216
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,400
M-maybe you better go
to the airport without me.

1217
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,200
No, I can't.

1218
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,800
No, no, no. Listen,
you're a hero now, Davey.

1219
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,000
You don't need an old
jelly blaster like me anymore.

1220
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,200
Don't say that.
You'll be fine.

1221
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,400
Never did like
that rule--

1222
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,200
leaving when
they stop believing.

1223
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,800
Maybe I better
go get some help.

1224
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,000
No, don't go.

1225
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,400
They wouldn't
be able to see me anyway.

1226
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,400
Well...

1227
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:38,200
It was fun while it lasted
anyway, wasn't it, pal?

1228
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,200
But Jack Flack
always escapes.

1229
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,400
Want to
know something?

1230
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,400
You're the best
playmate I ever had.

1231
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,000
You can't
leave, Jack.

1232
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,400
I have to, kid.

1233
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,800
You're growing up now.

1234
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,400
Listen...

1235
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,400
Do me a favor,
will you?

1236
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,600
Go get me a smoke.

1237
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,400
Over there.

1238
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,400
Jack,
where are you?

1239
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,000
Come back. I can't
do it on my own.

1240
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Yes, you can.

1241
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
You were
always on your own.

1242
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,400
Save Kim, Davey.

1243
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,000
The white zone
is for the immediate loading

1244
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,400
and unloading
of passengers only.

1245
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,400
There is no parking.

1246
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,400
Hi. I'm David Osborne's
father.

1247
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,400
Oh, yes.
I know.

1248
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,200
Is Kim here?

1249
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,800
Isn't she
at your house?

1250
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,400
No, she's not.

1251
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,200
Look, I just got
a call from David--

1252
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,200
Come here. I want to
show you something.

1253
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,400
I just got back here.
And look at this.

1254
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,400
Is this another one
of your son's games?

1255
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,400
I don't think so.

1256
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,000
I need the phone.

1257
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
What is it?

1258
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Operator.

1259
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,200
Operator, let me
have the police.

1260
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,000
This is an emergency.

1261
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,400
My name is
Sergeant Osborne.

1262
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,400
I'd like to speak
to Lieutenant Fleming.

1263
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,200
Is it Kim?
Is she--

1264
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,400
Why is he trying
to reach me?

1265
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,200
Two men were shooting
at a young boy.

1266
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,200
I'll have Fleming call--

1267
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,400
Wait a minute!
I'll hold on.

1268
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,000
If you can connect me
with the lieutenant,

1269
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,200
I'll hold on, ok?

1270
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,400
Two men are dead
down at the river.

1271
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,400
They were shooting
at a kid Davey's age.

1272
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:11,600
You and me better get
to that airport.

1273
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,200
Sir, which is
the airport bus?

1274
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
That one over there.

1275
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,400
Is this the bus
to the airport?

1276
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,400
I lost my bus pass.

1277
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,200
75 cents.

1278
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,400
I don't have it.

1279
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,600
Have to get off,
then.

1280
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,200
Can't let you ride
for free.

1281
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,200
But you have to!

1282
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,400
Listen, I'll pay you
when I get to the airport.

1283
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,400
Sorry.

1284
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Flight 146 to Mexico City
is about to board at Gate 15,

1285
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,400
Concourse "B."

1286
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,400
Thanks.

1287
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,200
Mister,
take me to the airport.

1288
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,400
You got any money, son?

1289
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,400
Yeah, lots.

1290
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,400
10 bucks in advance.

1291
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,200
I don't
have that much,

1292
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,200
but I have to get--

1293
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,200
Forget it, kid.

1294
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,200
Listen, I don't
have any money,

1295
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,600
but I got to get
to the airport.

1296
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,000
I'll find some way
to pay you

1297
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,400
when we get there.

1298
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,400
It's a matter of
life and death.

1299
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,400
What happened
to your leg?

1300
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,400
Nothing.

1301
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,200
Look, maybe we better
get you to a hospital.

1302
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,400
That leg doesn't look
too good.

1303
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,200
I don't have time
for that.

1304
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,400
If I don't
get to the airport,

1305
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,400
a girl is going
to die.

1306
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,200
Get in.

1307
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,400
I was going home
that way anyway.

1308
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,400
How long
will it take?

1309
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,400
This time of night
about 10 minutes.

1310
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,400
But you have to stop them
from getting on the plane.

1311
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,400
You see, they have
the "C" and "D" tape.

1312
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,600
What?

1313
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,800
A Cloak
and Dagger tape,

1314
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,200
you know,
a game cartridge.

1315
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,200
Only it has stolen
government plans in it.

1316
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,600
What does this couple
look like?

1317
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,200
I don't know.
Kind of old.

1318
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,400
The woman only
has 2 fingers.

1319
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,600
Maybe it was three.
I forget.

1320
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,400
Will you just stop
that plane from boarding

1321
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,200
before they take off
in it?

1322
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:16,400
I think we better
talk to the chief.

1323
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,000
11:47.

1324
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,400
Can't we go
any faster?

1325
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,600
I only have
a few more minutes.

1326
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,400
Yes, sir, boss.

1327
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,200
You mind
hand-searching that?

1328
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,200
I don't want to put it
through that electrical doodad.

1329
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,400
That's all the
description you've got?

1330
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,600
I told you
we got cut off!

1331
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,400
Look, all you got to do
is check their fingers. Jeez!

1332
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:05,600
Transcon Flight 146
now boarding at Gate 15.

1333
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,000
That's their flight!

1334
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,600
All right, let me just
get this down here.

1335
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,600
But there isn't time!

1336
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,200
The white zone is
for immediate loading

1337
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,400
and unloading of
passengers only.

1338
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,400
There is no parking
in the white zone.

1339
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,800
Wait here. I'll find
some way to pay you.

1340
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,000
Forget it, kid.

1341
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,600
Thanks.

1342
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,400
Southwest Flight 2 arriving
from Houston/Austin...

1343
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,400
How do I
find somebody?

1344
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,400
Tell me their name,
and I'll have them paged.

1345
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,200
Uh, Kim Gardener.

1346
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:50,200
Kim Gardener, please report
to the information counter.

1347
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,400
Kim Gardener to the
information counter.

1348
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,800
Did they call my name?

1349
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,400
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

1350
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,400
What's your mother's
name and phone number?

1351
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,200
I think they just said
Kim Gardener. That's me.

1352
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,400
Just a couple
more questions, ok?

1353
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,200
Have you seen
a little girl around 8?

1354
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,400
She has blonde hair?

1355
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,400
Is she boarding
on this flight?

1356
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,600
Stop them!

1357
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,800
Just a second,
there, son.

1358
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,400
But they have
the cartridge!

1359
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,600
I'm sorry, son. You'll
just have to go around

1360
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,800
and wait your turn.
Who you with anyway?

1361
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,800
Mom, Dad!
Please don't leave me!

1362
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,400
Are they your folks?

1363
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,800
Just a minute, folks.

1364
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Would you mind
coming back here, please?

1365
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,600
Uh, the plane's
already boarding.

1366
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,600
It'll wait. Let's get
this straightened out first.

1367
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,400
Transcon Flight 6
from Miami/Atlanta

1368
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,400
is now arriving
at gate 17.

1369
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,600
Is this your boy?

1370
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,800
Do we look like we could
have a boy that age?

1371
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,800
You putting
me on, son?

1372
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,400
No, sir. I can prove
they're my folks.

1373
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,600
How?

1374
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,400
Look inside
that bag over there.

1375
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,800
You'll find one of
my game cartridges--

1376
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,800
Cloak and Dagger.

1377
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,400
May I see that
bag, please?

1378
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,600
Officer,
this boy is lying.

1379
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,600
We've never seen him
before in our lives.

1380
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,800
I still would like
to see that bag.

1381
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,600
Will you give it
to me, please?

1382
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,400
Ok, thank you.

1383
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,400
Kim!
Davey!

1384
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:34,800
Give me your
walkie-talkie.

1385
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
He grabbed
the gun!

1386
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,800
Eunice,
grab the kid.

1387
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,400
Please, stay back.

1388
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,800
Stay where you are!

1389
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,400
This has
a bom--

1390
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,200
Here,
Lieutenant.

1391
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,600
Take a look
at this.

1392
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,600
What have
you got?

1393
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,600
Come on.

1394
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,200
We'll begin
boarding passengers

1395
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,600
seated in rows
1 through 15.

1396
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,600
What's
going on here?

1397
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,800
Stay back!

1398
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,800
Get over there!

1399
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,800
Oh, my leg!

1400
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,800
Davey! Davey!

1401
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,600
Out of the way!

1402
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,600
They're wanted by the FBI
for selling military secrets,

1403
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,400
which were smuggled in
children's video cartridges.

1404
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,800
What about my son?

1405
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,400
They've got divers
down there now.

1406
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,800
Did this
belong to him?

1407
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,600
God.

1408
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,000
Why didn't
I believe him?

1409
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,800
Lieutenant
Fleming?

1410
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,400
A hijacking
at Gate 15.

1411
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,200
Hijacking?

1412
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,400
I want a Code 3.
Code 3.

1413
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,000
What happened?

1414
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,400
2 people have kidnapped
a little boy...

1415
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,600
Kim!

1416
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,000
Mom!

1417
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,600
Oh, honey, I was
so worried about you.

1418
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,600
They've got
Davey out there.

1419
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,600
What did they say?

1420
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,400
If they can't get
a pilot

1421
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,400
to fly 'em to Cuba
within 5 minutes,

1422
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,400
they're going
to kill him.

1423
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,600
My God.

1424
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,600
What are you going to do?

1425
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,600
FBI is sending over
their resident agent.

1426
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,400
How long
before he gets here?

1427
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,400
It'll be a few minutes.
I just talked to them.

1428
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,600
A few minutes?

1429
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,400
That may be too late.
My son's on that airplane.

1430
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,400
He says we got
3 minutes.

1431
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,600
He's bluffing.

1432
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,800
He's bluffing
with my son's life.

1433
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:06,800
Let me go out there.

1434
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,600
I'm a staff sergeant
out at Kelly Field.

1435
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,600
I'm licensed
to taxi airplanes.

1436
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,200
Forget it.

1437
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,600
He won't
negotiate.

1438
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,600
I think he's
flipping out.

1439
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:17,800
What do I do?

1440
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,800
Tell him a pilot's
coming out there.

1441
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,600
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1442
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,600
Listen to me.

1443
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,000
They might even buy
the uniform,

1444
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,400
but what happens
when they expect you

1445
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,600
to take that plane
in the air?

1446
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,400
I'll fake it.

1447
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
One more minute, and I blow
this kid's brains out.

1448
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
But this
thing has--

1449
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,800
Shut up! Shut up!

1450
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,600
George, remember
your blood pressure.

1451
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,600
Darn kid's messing
everything up.

1452
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,600
Calm down.

1453
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,600
As long as we've
got the boy,

1454
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,800
they'll have to
give us a pilot.

1455
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,000
Which one do I pull?

1456
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,600
Jack?

1457
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,000
Jack?

1458
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,600
Here comes
someone now.

1459
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,400
Jack, please come back.

1460
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,600
I didn't mean
to throw you away.

1461
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,600
I need your help.

1462
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,800
Who are you?

1463
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,200
I'm the pilot.
I'm not armed.

1464
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,800
Turn around.

1465
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,600
Frisk him.

1466
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,000
Where's the boy?

1467
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,600
He's all right.
He's back there.

1468
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,600
He's clean.

1469
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,600
Close the door.

1470
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,600
Get into
the cockpit.

1471
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,000
No funny
business,

1472
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,600
or I'll blow
your head off.

1473
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,400
Watch him,
George.

1474
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,600
Help me, Jack.

1475
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,200
What are you doing?

1476
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,600
I have to pressurize
the cabin.

1477
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,000
Switch over there.

1478
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:49,800
I have to
call the tower

1479
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,000
to get permission
to take off.

1480
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,800
Is that all right?

1481
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,200
San Antonio Tower,

1482
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,000
this is Flight 146.

1483
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,600
San Antonio Tower,

1484
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,200
this is Flight 146.

1485
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,800
Jack, please
come back.

1486
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,000
I can't do this
on my own.

1487
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,200
I need your help.

1488
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,600
Jack...Jack.

1489
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:18,600
Request permission
to taxi to Runway 15

1490
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,800
for reroute to Havana.

1491
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,200
Jack, please come back.
I need your help.

1492
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,600
This is captain
Jack Flack.

1493
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,600
David Osborne, to
the cockpit right away.

1494
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,800
What's the big idea?
You don't have to see the kid.

1495
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,600
They told me
to make sure

1496
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,200
the boy was all right
before I take off.

1497
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,800
Come on.

1498
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,600
You're wanted up front.

1499
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,000
But the bomb goes off
in less than a minute.

1500
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,800
Come on, junior.

1501
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,600
Now!

1502
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:59,600
George.

1503
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,000
George!

1504
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,400
George! George!

1505
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,800
Davey, get up here
right away!

1506
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,600
Dad!

1507
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,600
No, you don't!

1508
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,800
Let me go!

1509
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,200
Dad!

1510
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,800
Dad!

1511
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,600
Look, it's moving.

1512
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:20,800
Dad!

1513
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,000
Davey!

1514
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,200
George!

1515
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:28,600
Forget the boy
and get back here!

1516
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,800
Well, disarm it.

1517
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,400
I don't know how.

1518
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:45,200
It's still going.
The door!

1519
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,400
We got to get you
out of here.

1520
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,400
It won't open with
the cabin pressurized.

1521
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,200
George!

1522
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,000
Open up!

1523
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,000
You'll never fit.

1524
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,400
Never mind me.

1525
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,200
Dad, I'm not going
without you!

1526
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,200
Now take my hand.
Hold my hand.

1527
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:19,200
No, Dad! I'm not
leaving without you!

1528
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,600
Let go of my hands!

1529
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,200
No! I'm not leaving!

1530
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:25,200
When you hit the ground,
run away from the plane!

1531
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:26,600
Dad, come with me!

1532
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,400
Dad.

1533
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,600
Dad!

1534
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,400
Jack?

1535
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,000
Jack?

1536
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,800
Dad!

1537
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,000
Son!

1538
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,400
How'd you escape?

1539
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,800
Jack Flack
always escapes.

1540
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,800
I don't need
him anymore.

1541
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,200
I've got you, Dad.
