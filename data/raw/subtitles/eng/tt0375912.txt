1
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,600
When I was born,
the world was a far simpler place.

2
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,400
It was all just cops and robbers.

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,300
Fucking get down! Get down now!

4
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,800
And you! Stay down! Stay down!

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,700
But it wasn't for me.

6
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,200
Then came the Summer of Love.

7
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,600
Hashish and LSD arrived on the scene.

8
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,300
There were villains locked away for
12 years for robbing a bank of 10 grand,

9
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,200
doing time with drippy hippies
doing 12 months

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,100
for smuggling two million quid's
worth of puff.

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,100
I mean, work it out, mate.
We're in the wrong fucking game.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,700
Drugs changed everything.

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,600
Always remember that one day all
this drug monkey-business will be legal.

14
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,000
They won't leave it to people like me
when they figure out

15
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,000
how much money there is to be made -
not millions, fucking billions.

16
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,900
Recreational Drugs plc.
Giving people what they want.

17
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,100
Good times today, stupor tomorrow.

18
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,800
But this is now.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,800
So, until prohibition ends,
make hay while the sun shines.

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm not against it.

21
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm a businessman whose commodity
happens to be cocaine.

22
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,400
Ten years ago, Charlie was for pop stars
or a celebrity's birthday bash.

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,700
It was demonized by Daily Mail readers
getting drunk in naff wine bars.

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,200
Now they're my biggest clients.

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,200
This is Clarkie. Double first at Cambridge
in Industrial Chemistry.

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,300
Well, he's got to pay off
his student loan somehow.

27
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,400
Today, I only deal in kilos.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Depending which tariff you use,

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,100
that'll cost you either 28 grand
or 15 years in prison,

30
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
which is more time than a rapist.

31
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,300
C'est la vie.

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,000
It is vital that we work
to a few golden rules.

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
Always work in a small team.

34
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,100
Keep a very low profile. Only deal with
people who come recommended.

35
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,200
It's like selling anything -

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,800
washing machines,
hand-made shoes, blow-jobs.

37
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,800
As long as you don't take the piss,
people will always come back for more.

38
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,300
That's not to say we don't weave that
magic that makes two kilos into three,

39
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,400
but never be too greedy.

40
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,900
Know and respect your enemy.

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,600
It is only very, very stupid people
who think the law is stupid.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,100
And avoid like the fucking plague

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,300
loud, attention-seeking
wannabe gangsters,

44
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,100
in it for the glory, to be a face,
to be a name.

45
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Hello, Slavo. Yeah, this is Duke.

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,700
Everything's sweet. When can we meet?

47
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,100
They don't mean to fuck up. They just do.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,400
Forgive me for stating the obvious,
but stay away from the end-user.

49
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,400
They are guaranteed to bring you trouble.

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,900
As do guns.

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,400
I hate guns. And violence.

52
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,900
But as some Roman general once said,

53
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,300
"If you seek peace, plan for war.”

54
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,400
Morty and his assistant Terry,
they watch my back.

55
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,000
Morty learnt caution the hard way.
He did ten years inside.

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,100
He's my bridge to the criminal world, and
he ensures that the traffic is one way.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,700
Look, there's Amsterdam,
and there's Oofdorfe...dorfe.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,400
Not a fucking clue.
None of them speak English.

59
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,500
- Get in the car. I'm sure it's that way.
- Move up.

60
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,600
- I bet you it's that way.
- We've already been that way.

61
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,800
Yeah, but we're gonna go that way again.
Give us the map.

62
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,600
Oh, don't start, the pair of you.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
It's like being out with a pair of kids.

64
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,300
- All day you've been moaning.
- It can't be that difficult.

65
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,400
How many fucking greenhouses
can there be?

66
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,400
Morty.

67
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,100
Terence.

68
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,600
Clarkie.

69
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,500
Very, very important.:
pay your supplier prompt.

70
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,000
In our case, that's Mr. Jimmy Price.
He's the top of the pyramid.

71
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,300
Pay him. In full, on time, without fail,
no short counts.

72
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,700
You get no second chances.
Jimmy calls the shots.

73
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,500
Where the fuck is Gene?

74
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,200
- I don't know. Ask me one on sport.
- What time does your watch tell?

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,500
- The same as yours.
- He's never late.

76
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,000
Shut the fuck up.

77
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,100
Patience.

78
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,900
Gene here is Jimmy's right-hand man.

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Been with him since way back.

80
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,100
All the drugs and cash go through Gene.

81
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,800
Jimmy trusts him with his life.

82
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,000
By the way, Jimmy would like to see
you tomorrow for a spot of lunch.

83
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,100
Wait a minute. Is there a problem?

84
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,900
Why does everybody assume there's a
problem, just because he wants a word?

85
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,700
Maybe he's grateful.
He fucking should be.

86
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,000
See you at Stoke Park at one.

87
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,800
This is just so beautiful.

88
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,400
We need to get in and out
of here sharpish.

89
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Paul and the tide ain't gonna wait.

90
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,500
Everyone likes to walk
through a door mark ed "Private".

91
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,100
Therefore, have a good reason
to be affluent.

92
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,100
I own a share
in a very successful letting agency.

93
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,400
It gives me an honest income.
Looks good on the self-assessment.

94
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,700
Whereas years ago scallywags
were trying to get money out of banks,

95
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,900
now your problem is
how to get your ill-gotten gains in.

96
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,100
That's a job for Mr. Singh.
He does my laundry.

97
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,800
And in a week,
it will be ready for collection,

98
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,400
in the form of a nice, clean cheque
for a round million.

99
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,900
The business is on the up and up.

100
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,100
But I've always said,
have a plan and stick to it.

101
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,400
Quit while you're ahead.

102
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,600
So barring any fuck-ups,
I'm leaving it all behind.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, we got the parcel.

104
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,500
Yeah, better than expected, actually.

105
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,200
It's just that things have gone
a little bit slightly turbo this end.

106
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,000
Come on, boys, lively, lively.

107
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,400
If we miss this tide, we're
not going anywhere till daylight.

108
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,500
Paul, you ain't being paid to moan.
You're being paid to get my cargo home.

109
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,900
Come on, babe. You all right?
Careful here, it's a bit wobbly.

110
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,500
Life is so fucking good,
I can taste it in my spit.

111
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,300
I'll treat tomorrow's lunch like a Last
Supper, feign interest in his tales.

112
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,000
And then leave quietly forever.

113
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
This is pure class.

114
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,100
Please, follow me, gentlemen.

115
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,600
Mr. Price is in the Oval Room.

116
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,500
- Your guests, Mr. Price.
- Thanks, Angelo. Welcome. Sit down.

117
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,700
How is it with that
Paki accountant I put your way?

118
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
- He still doing the business?
- Raj is doing a very good job.

119
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,000
Good. Paying your bit
of straight-goer's tax, eh?

120
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
We all have to do our bit.

121
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,200
Say hello from me
next time you see him.

122
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,100
You hungry? The grub here
will make your bollocks tingle.

123
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,100
Let's eat.

124
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,000
Right.

125
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,700
We've gotta test the snap-crackle-and-pop
factor on these babies.

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Don't ask me.
I ain't fucking touching 'em.

127
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,300
You are a miserable bastard,
you really are.

128
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
- Brian.
- What?

129
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,100
Sit down, mate. Got a little treat for you.

130
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,400
Help yourself.

131
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,800
A little privacy, please, Angelo.

132
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
What do you want, son?

133
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,500
- Excuse me?
- In life. What are you after?

134
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,600
A shot at the title? A seat by the band?

135
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,800
Well, I don't know, Mr. Price.
That's a very expansive question.

136
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Right, expansive. Good answer.

137
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,100
Years ago, people would've
thought you were a homosexual,

138
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,200
using a word like "expansive" .

139
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,000
- You're not a homosexual, are you?
- No.

140
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,200
- Not behind with the rent?
- No.

141
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,700
No, I didn't think you were.

142
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,900
No harm in it, I suppose. Times change.

143
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,900
You know why people like you
can't leave this business?

144
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,700
Because you make too much money
for people like me.

145
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,600
Anyway, I'll get to the point.
I need a favor.

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,100
I need someone who's a bit cute,
a smooth operator.

147
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,600
Not a two-a-penny loud-mouth.
Too many grasses around.

148
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,100
- It would be a pleasure, Mr. Price.
- Jimmy. You can call me Jimmy.

149
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,300
Now, this favor. It's not for me, truth
be told. It's for a good friend of mine.

150
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,000
Like a blood-brother.
We were at school together.

151
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Now he's a right wheeler-dealer.

152
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,300
Flinging up skyscrapers.
His wife's a proper blue blood.

153
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,700
I'll give you a clue. Eddie Temple.
Does that name mean anything to you?

154
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,800
- I know who you mean.
- Now, Eddie's got a daughter.

155
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,000
Charlie, bless her.

156
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,900
The light of his life.
He worships the ground she walks on.

157
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,900
She's a proper beauty, Charlie.

158
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,300
Or to give her her correct moniker,
Charlie Spencer-Temple.

159
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
But she ain't behaving like a lady.

160
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,300
She's hooked on the white powder
and loves a wrong 'un.

161
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,400
This is where you come in, right?
You're gonna find her.

162
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,100
- Find her?
- She's gone missing.

163
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,500
Well, you should get a private detective.

164
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Oh, right. Some nosy ex-policeman,
still on the Scotland Yard payroll?

165
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,200
She's done a runner from a drug
rehabilitation unit in the West Country.

166
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,900
Rehab.

167
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,500
She got loved up in there with some
fucking low-life crackhead called Kinky.

168
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,800
I reckon they've gone back to London.

169
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,900
I wouldn't know where to begin.

170
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,900
Now and then we're asked
to do something beyond the call of duty.

171
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,600
It's called sacrifice, son.
Ask Gene. Ask Morty.

172
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,200
- I'll do my best.
- You do your best and find her.

173
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,000
Keep Mr. McGuire posted.

174
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,000
I've also got a little business
more in your usual line.

175
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,100
Gene'll fill you in.

176
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Everything was to your satisfaction?

177
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,100
- Fucking excellent, Angelo.
- Thank you.

178
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,400
" Details, details.
Things to do, things to get done.

179
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,900
" Don't bother me with details.
Just tell me when they're done."

180
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,400
- Who said that, son?
- Winston Churchill?

181
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,900
Close. No, I said it.
James Lionel Price. Good boy.

182
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,700
I'll see you at the yard tomorrow.
Say, four.

183
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:31,200
Tell you about that bit of business.
I've set up a meet for five with the Duke.

184
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,600
- What's with him?
- He's just had one of these.

185
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,000
These are super Es. We'll make millions!

186
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,900
I don't care. This is my boat-yard.

187
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,400
I want those pills
and that fucking idiot out of here now.

188
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,500
- I can't afford to get nicked.
- Paul. Calm down, mate.

189
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,100
I've got Gene coming down
with a buyer. You'll be in your whack.

190
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,300
Here, chill. Have a pill.

191
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,600
Gene, why are we doing business
with the Duke?

192
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,500
Yeah, why are we dealing with this joker?

193
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
He's a fucking maniac, a relic,
a throw-back, belongs to the Dark Ages.

194
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,200
Will you just shut the fuck up?

195
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
We're dealing with him because
he has 1 million Ecstasy pills

196
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,600
of very high levels of MDMA, OK?

197
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
One million?

198
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,300
Gene, that is a lot of pills.
What's the tax on that?

199
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,500
Jimmy wants 50%/ netto.

200
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,500
Love a bit of cloak-and-dagger, this lot.

201
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Oh, yeah. Driving a bright yellow
Range Rover. Very subtle.

202
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Calm down. You'll feel better
once you've got your money.

203
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,900
But how much can you spend
in Parkhurst or the Scrubs, Gene?

204
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,700
Come on.

205
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,200
Oh, don't go getting Duke at it. Jimmy
doesn't want him fucked about, OK?

206
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,300
Who? Me?

207
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,500
Don't you fucking talk to me
like I'm some kind of mug.

208
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,500
Duke, don't take this personally.
It's business.

209
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
You want to know
how much they're worth.

210
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Yes! Fucking! Please!

211
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,900
Just because you pay a fiver a pop
down the local cattle market,

212
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,900
don't, for fuck's sake,
think these pills are worth millions.

213
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,500
They're not.

214
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,600
We've got to find a buyer.

215
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,200
They've got to split them into parcels.
They've got to find these people.

216
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
You'd give a fucking aspirin
a headache, pal.

217
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,400
Then you've got currency fluctuations,
police activity, adverse publicity.

218
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,000
Who has got the readies lying around
to pay for a million Es?

219
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,300
- This is fucking bollocks!
- Slasher, shut the fuck up!

220
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,900
- Duke, we all want a good deal.
- Mate, mate, mate.

221
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,400
Mate, look, that parcel of pills
has got to be worth five million easy.

222
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,100
- £5 each, yeah!
- You are fucking joking.

223
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200
It doesn't work like that!

224
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,000
Don't keep fucking saying that to me!

225
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,000
I've got some samples.
I'll stay in touch through Gene, OK?

226
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,500
You wouldn't be so fucking flash
if you didn't have him behind you.

227
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,300
Yeah, well, he fucking has, ain't he?

228
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Where did these monkeys
get a million Es?

229
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,100
Don't worry about that.
Can you place them?

230
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,200
We know someone up North who'll buy.

231
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,200
Morty, set up a meeting
with Trevor and Shanks in Liverpool.

232
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,100
What's really bothering me
is what color to get the Aston.

233
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,500
As you're driving it yourself,
probably green.

234
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,400
- Green?
- Yeah.

235
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,700
That's a trifle dull, I thought.
What do you think, girls?

236
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,500
Black. Yeah, black.

237
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,200
Black's the color for a hearse or a taxi.

238
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,700
Don't be so conservative.
Black's a splendid idea.

239
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Hello. Look who it is.
Sit down. Do join us.

240
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,100
- Can we have a word?
- Our dreary broker has arrived.

241
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,300
Hugo, follow me.

242
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't go anywhere.
Drink some more champagne.

243
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,600
Especially you.
I like it when you're drunk.

244
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,600
- You're the master of that.
- What are you up to?

245
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,300
We're doing the number
on these American birds.

246
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,100
- Who am I today?
- The Earl of Oxford.

247
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,300
- The Earl of Oxford.
- Fucking hell.

248
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,400
- What's this business, then?
- It's a bit strange.

249
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,300
Can you find somebody
for me really quickly?

250
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,900
- How quickly?
- 20 grand quickly.

251
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,200
You've got our attention.

252
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,700
Oh, very nice.
I suppose this is the boyfriend?

253
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,200
It's a bit unusual for you.
What's going on?

254
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,500
- It doesn't matter. Can you do it?
- Yeah.

255
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,100
Should be a doddle.
All the same, junkies and crackheads.

256
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Chuck 'em a few quid, they'll cough.

257
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,200
- Is there anything else?
- No.

258
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
We must get back to work, old boy.

259
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100
Look...

260
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,900
All right, mate. I'm the Duke's nephew.

261
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,100
Remember me? Sidney.

262
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,100
Sidney. Yes. Hello, mate. How are you?
I'm just off. Have a nice night.

263
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,100
How you doing?
What you doing here?

264
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,400
I hear you're doing business
with my uncle, the Duke.

265
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,300
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking room?

266
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,200
- This is Tammy.
- Who's your mate, Sidney?

267
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,200
He's a good mate of my uncle's, the Duke.
He was just going.

268
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,200
Yeah, well stick around and have a drink
before you do, yeah?

269
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,600
- Yeah, all right.
- I got VIP down here. Nice little booth.

270
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Charisma, he's fucking got it.

271
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,000
I know he's my uncle and all that,
but you can't deny it.

272
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,100
If you want anything, just tell me,
'cause I got 'em straightened out in here.

273
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,400
If you want any running about,
I'm your man...

274
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,600
- Line?
- What?

275
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
I said do you want a line?

276
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,300
No, mate. You knock yourself out.

277
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,100
Lovely, isn't she? Isn't she a darling?

278
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,900
Isn't she?

279
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,900
Siddy, baby, I could do with a livener.

280
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,100
Sidney, it's been great. I'll see you, man.
Thanks for the champagne.

281
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
All right.

282
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,300
You let me know when you're happy,
Mr. Lucky.

283
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,000
- Too warm down your way?
- We're kept busy, Trevor.

284
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,900
- Everyone wants a slice as well.
- Same wherever you go. Greedy people.

285
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah, it's all clear, Shanks.

286
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,700
You lot would know all about that,
wouldn't you?

287
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,200
What the fuck's that, Shanks?

288
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,700
Well, not you lot, but...

289
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,500
...that team down your end.
Like you don't know.

290
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,600
No offence, but what the fuck
are you talking about?

291
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
You really do surprise me,
do you know that?

292
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,700
Do you know something we don't?

293
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,100
Don't be giving it
the big fucking innocent, pal.

294
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,100
Because I am not a fucking prick.

295
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,300
- I never said you were, Shanks.
- Cool it, Shanks. They really don't know.

296
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,000
- Explain.
- I was over in Amsterdam.

297
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,200
Last weekend, right?

298
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,800
The whole place is alight with a rumor

299
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,100
about how this hooligan outfit
from down your end,

300
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,200
run by this joker called the Duke...

301
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,300
- Gazza, go and find them fucking pills.
- All right. Come on. Have a look in here.

302
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,300
They skanked this outfit,
a proper, nutty Serbian militia.

303
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,400
You're the first person ever to be
foolish enough to steal from me.

304
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,100
Shut up.

305
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,500
But you're not the first
to point a gun at me.

306
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,600
Shut up or I'll be the last.

307
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,300
Fuck me.

308
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,300
They got lucky.
He'd just knock ed up a massive batch.

309
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Fucking jackpot. There's fucking
millions of the fuckers in here.

310
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,200
Stay down there. Yes?

311
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,900
You watch them.

312
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,200
- That looks very heavy for you, darling.
- Fuck off.

313
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,100
- Why don't you put it down?
- Why don't you shut up?

314
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,500
- A little girl playing games with guns.
- I ain't no little girl. Shut up!

315
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,300
- You are shaking.
- Fuck off!

316
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,100
- Look at your arm.
- Fuck off!

317
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,600
- Put it down.
- Why don't you listen to me?

318
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,000
- Sit down!
- Fuck off!

319
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,700
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

320
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,600
Come here. Come here.
Baby, calm down, calm down.

321
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,700
This will not be the end of this,
Mr. Duke, believe me.

322
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,900
Gazza, go and load them pills.

323
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,200
But he got unlucky because this lot
are wanted for fucking war crimes.

324
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Mass murder, ethnic cleansing.
They're lunatics.

325
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,800
They're wanted by the United
fucking Nations. Think about that.

326
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,700
Let's get this clear.

327
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,400
Duke has absolutely sweet fuck-all
to do with us, understand?

328
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Everyone in Amsterdam
believes that he has.

329
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,800
- Bandied your names about.
- What?

330
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,400
Word on the street is they've unleashed
their top boy. His name is...

331
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
His party piece, right,

332
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,600
is lopping people's heads off
then fetching them back to his boss.

333
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,500
It's all about honor and respect with
these head-banging nationalist outfits.

334
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,600
They can't have it getting about that
anybody has took liberties with them.

335
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,000
But we had nothing to do with
the acquiring of said merchandise.

336
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,300
OK, we accept that.

337
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,000
But with you lot up here punting
this shipment, how does it look?

338
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,800
Bad.

339
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,900
You do know that we're only
talking pennies an article?

340
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,100
- Stolen goods.
- You won't want them, then.

341
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:09,900
Sit down, lah. Let's not be too hasty.
Me and him need to have a little think.

342
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,800
Don't think too long. Someone's
gonna make a killing on these pills.

343
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,500
They already have.
That's the problem, kidder.

344
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,400
That prick Duke's made us look
a bunch of fucking amateurs.

345
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,700
I told you he was trouble. But he ain't
gonna drag me down with him.

346
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,100
Try Gene again. What a fucking show-up!

347
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,700
- He's not answering, Mort.
- OK.

348
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,900
Try Jimmy at home.

349
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,100
- You sure?
- Will you fucking ring him?

350
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,400
- Where are we going, Morty?
- Back to that boat-yard.

351
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:57,100
- Somebody's about to get a fucking slap.
- Yes, Morty. About fucking time.

352
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,500
Paul?

353
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,600
What a way to go. An iron burning a hole
in your chest until your heart boils.

354
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Paulie would've told him anything, then,
wouldn't he?

355
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,400
You see, that's what happens
when you do business with loons.

356
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,900
Clarkie, have a sniff about. Make some
phone calls, but really quietly.

357
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,100
Find out where the Duke's holed up.

358
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,000
We're gonna need an insurance policy.

359
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,300
What's the fucking idea of phoning me at
home and leaving messages, you prick!

360
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,600
- Jimmy, it was an emergency.
- Don't fucking call me Jimmy!

361
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,800
And what's the idea of telling Duke
those pills ain't worth shit?

362
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
You don't know
the problems you've caused.

363
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,800
And don't be leaving it to that pair
of ponces, Cody and Tiptoes,

364
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,800
to find that bitch Charlie.

365
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,800
I fucking told you to do it!

366
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,500
Are you listening?
Find a buyer for those pills.

367
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,200
The person moving those pills
met a nasty end.

368
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,700
I don't give a fuck!

369
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
- That was quick.
- The gaff is rotten in there.

370
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,600
- Kinky's still here, isn't he?
- Didn't Tiptoes tell you?

371
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,600
Tell me what? Have you let him go?

372
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,500
No, I haven't. He's in here.

373
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,800
Kinky.

374
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,900
I still want to be paid.

375
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:05,100
So, if I'm correct, you three gearheads
are gonna be clucking very soon.

376
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,100
In fact, you're gonna be climbing
the walls any minute, aren't you?

377
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,000
But I'm prepared to do you a favor.

378
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,900
We can do this one of two ways.

379
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,700
We can do it the nice way,
which I think you'll prefer.

380
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,300
Because the other way
is my friend takes you

381
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,700
and puts your head
through the window!

382
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,800
Right, so, was Charlie here with Kinky?

383
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah, she was here for a couple of days.
Kinky turned up with five grand.

384
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,200
- Who's giving Kinky five grand?
- We don't know.

385
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,700
They kept arguing. She was saying,
"Do you think it's that easy

386
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,400
"taking the five grand?"
But she was still caning the rocks.

387
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,400
Where is she now?

388
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,400
Brighton. She kept begging
Kinky to go with her.

389
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,600
The other night, I hears this noise.
I'm looking out there. It's dark.

390
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,400
But I sees this geezer all in black.
It's like something out of a kung-fu film.

391
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,300
- Pay no attention to him. He's a nutter.
- Shut the fuck up.

392
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,300
And you, fucking tell him now.
What geezer?

393
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,700
I don't know. I goofed out myself.

394
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,600
The next morning,
she's gone and Kinky's dead.

395
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,200
You telling me
that somebody's topped Kinky?

396
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,100
Kinky overdosed.
He always was a greedy fucker.

397
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,300
I saw it with my own eyes, man.

398
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,500
You smoke too much
of that fucking crack!

399
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,000
Shut the fuck up!

400
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
- You twat!
- Shut the fuck up!

401
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,800
Get the fucking money!

402
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,700
Morty! Morty!

403
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,300
This is dodgy.
That kid's talking about murder.

404
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,500
He's talking shit.
Get to Brighton and finish the job.

405
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,700
- It all smells a bit fishy.
- I'll double your money.

406
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
- All right. And ten G for finding Kinky.
- That wasn't the fucking deal.

407
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,400
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

408
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,100
Hello. Ambulance, please.

409
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,800
185 Kirby House, Kings Cross.

410
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,900
There's a dead boy. The door's open.

411
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,100
My name...?

412
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,100
185 Kirby House.

413
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm not happy.

414
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,700
This shit is out of control.
You sort it out or I'll sort you out.

415
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,300
Morty, Kinky OD'd, that's all.

416
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,600
Charlie woke up, found him cold,
freaked out, fucked off down to Brighton.

417
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,100
Cody's gonna find her.

418
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,700
Look, I'm gonna freshen these teas up.
They're cold.

419
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,200
Morty?

420
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,900
Is that you?

421
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,400
Where you been hiding, then, eh?

422
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,000
Fucking hell. What you doing
down this neck of the woods?

423
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Hello, Freddie.

424
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,600
So...

425
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,800
...Mr. Mortimer.

426
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,500
Here, Morty, couldn't spare us a few quid,
for old times' sake?

427
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,900
You look well flush, bruv.

428
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,200
Fuck me, he's loaded.

429
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,700
Here, couldn't make it five, could you...

430
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,300
...mate?

431
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,000
- Let's make it ten.
- Yeah.

432
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
Ten's...

433
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,200
...a nice...

434
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,400
...round number.

435
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,800
What's the matter?

436
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,300
What's happening? Been away?
Yeah. Ten fucking years.

437
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,500
Going off? Or do you need a red light?

438
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,300
Stop, Morty. Enough. He's had enough.

439
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,700
- I'll tell you when he's had enough.
- What the fuck is this?

440
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,000
But let's forget about all that.

441
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,600
Let's have a cup of tea, Mr. Hurst.

442
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,400
What the fuck?

443
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,400
I'm sorry about that.
I won't be around for a while.

444
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,900
- It's me.
- Hey.

445
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,400
Come on up.
I'll leave the door open.

446
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,100
- How's your day been so far?
- Very fucking funny.

447
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,300
Have you eaten?
I'll have a Chinky sent up.

448
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,100
No, I'm fine, thank you.

449
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,300
Gene, who the fuck is Freddie?

450
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,400
He used to run with me, Morty and Jimmy
in this real kamikaze firm.

451
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,200
In those days, we were headed up
by this guy called Crazy Larry.

452
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,900
Yeah. Got shot, didn't he? Bit of a lunatic.

453
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,100
That's an understatement.
They were a spun-out bunch.

454
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,400
Always doing loads of drugs.

455
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,400
- Not worried about keeping a low profile.
- I love you.

456
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,800
Turn over anyone
who couldn't go to the law.

457
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,400
No fucking problem. Boys will be boys.

458
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,600
Until one of them, Kilburn Jerry...

459
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,500
...shoots himself stone dead.

460
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
This is a bit of a dilemma.

461
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,400
This desperate posse can't call the law
or an ambulance.

462
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,500
Morty, out of some mad
fucking sense of loyalty,

463
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,000
actually volunteered
to dispose of the body.

464
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,300
No head. But things went a bit wrong.

465
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,100
The guy Larry told to help him
was Freddie Hurst.

466
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,800
The total imbecile
had fallen asleep at some traffic lights

467
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,800
in a drunk en, drug-induced stupor.

468
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:50,000
Morty was still shut up in the van with
the headless body of Kilburn Jerry.

469
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,000
Being black
was even worse than being Irish.

470
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,300
They threw the book at Morty.

471
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,900
Freddie got three years
for aiding and abetting.

472
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,300
Morty did ten years because
Freddie Hurst fell asleep?

473
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,800
But he kept his mouth shut.

474
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:08,100
Did his bird.
Earned a lot of respect for that.

475
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,000
All because some kid was being ridden
against his will by a psychotic lunatic.

476
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,600
- Who?
- But you, you fuck!

477
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,300
Larry.

478
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,300
- Crazy Larry was gay.
- He was never gay.

479
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,000
- Larry used to say...
- Fucking females is for puffs.

480
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,500
So who shot Crazy Larry?
A boyfriend?

481
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,700
Probably.

482
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,800
Larry made enemies very easy. Took
liberties with too many straight lads.

483
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,000
Not for me.

484
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,900
Listen, son. Let me explain
something to you.

485
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,500
Freddie's in intensive care
with a bit of a brain hemorrhage.

486
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,700
You were there at the scene.
That's called joint venture.

487
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,300
Now, if Freddie dies,
you're either in the dock with Morty

488
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,300
or you're in the witness box
putting him away. Think about that.

489
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,100
You know, I will have one of those.

490
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,000
- All right, fellas?
- Where's Duke?

491
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,600
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

492
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,200
- I don't know. I thought he was here.
- Well, go and fucking find him.

493
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,200
He's probably having a night out
while us mugs baby-sit these.

494
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,800
Gene, what the fuck
am I gonna do about these Serbs?

495
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,600
Come here. I have something for you.

496
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
- You're gonna need one of these.
- Fuck me, Gene.

497
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,700
I fucking hope not. Are you trying
to scare the shit out of me?

498
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,700
I mean, I fucking hate guns.

499
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,100
Although that one is really pretty.
Is that Second World War?

500
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,000
Hey, point it upwards.

501
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,300
Oh, for fuck's sake.

502
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,100
Here, let me see if it's loaded.

503
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,200
You look like
you could do that blindfolded.

504
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,600
I can and I do.

505
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,500
I find it very relaxing.
Good for meditation.

506
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,500
Meditation is concentrating the front
of the mind with a mundane task

507
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,300
so the rest of the mind can find peace.

508
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,100
And you find peace with guns.

509
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,400
Well, on occasion. It has been known.

510
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,600
Listen. I know it's not your thing.

511
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,800
But if you ever have to kill somebody,
never, ever tell a living soul.

512
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,500
- Who is this?
- My name is Dragan.

513
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,900
How did you get this number?

514
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,400
Boatman Paul gave me your number,
in the end.

515
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,200
I believe you have some property
that belongs to my employer,

516
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,100
and you're the person I should talk to
about the return of this cargo,

517
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,100
stolen by your associate, the Duke.

518
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,200
Dragan, the Duke
is nothing to do with me.

519
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,400
Mr. Duke came to Amsterdam,
used your name, said he work ed for you.

520
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,100
- Are you listening?
- Dragan...

521
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,400
I've got an idea. Why don't
you come round for breakfast?

522
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,400
I'll squeeze some orange juice
and we'll talk about this like adults.

523
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,900
- How does that sound?
- Sounds very hospitable.

524
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,900
- Do you know where I live?
- No.

525
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,800
Well, fuck off, then.

526
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,000
Duke's gone missing.
He's a fucking liability.

527
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,400
The pigs are everywhere.
This was meant to be easy. No sweat.

528
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,200
Calm down, Gazza.
I'm sure Duke's just fine.

529
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,400
Well, you've got 48 hours to find a buyer
or I'm sending 'em back, OK?

530
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,600
Now, listen.
Don't do anything stupid, Gazza.

531
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,600
It ain't worth the grief. We've gone
underground, off the radar.

532
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,400
Nothing personal,
but I don't trust you.

533
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,900
Listen, I just had a phone call
from Gazza.

534
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,800
Being a cry-baby. Threatening
to offload those pills in 48 hours.

535
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,300
Between you and that gobshite Duke,
he's promised Jimmy a bumper pay-day.

536
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,100
- So get busy.
- I said to Jimmy I'd try and...

537
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,300
He put yous together.

538
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,400
You and Duke. That's his job.

539
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:02,200
If you two can't make music, he's gonna
want his whack out either way.

540
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,800
That's business.

541
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,100
- I hope you put this Dragan straight.
- Yeah. I told him to fuck off.

542
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,300
What? Please tell me
you're fucking joking.

543
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,500
Well, I am beginning to regret it now.

544
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,200
We've got to find the Duke,
find these fucking pills.

545
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,000
We can't rely
on these monkeys to call Gene.

546
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,800
We've looked everywhere.
There's no sign.

547
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,200
You can't find any of his firm?

548
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,400
Maybe this Dragan geezer's already found
the Duke and done the business.

549
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,800
Yeah, well, there is someone I can call.
Keep looking.

550
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,100
Wait. You're gonna leave it to us?

551
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,800
This Dragan geezer is phoning me.
I am the target.

552
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,000
And if we don't find the Duke,
this, everything, all over.

553
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,600
- It's me. Sidney's mate.
- Oh, hiya.

554
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,300
- What took you so long to call?
- I've been busy.

555
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,400
- You sound sleepy. You just woken up?
- Not long ago.

556
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:24,200
- So when am I gonna see you?
- What are you doing now?

557
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,300
Nothing. No, I was just lying in bed,
wondering what to do.

558
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,100
- You still in bed?
- Yeah.

559
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:45,400
- You lying there naked?
- I've got a little T-shirt on. But that's all.

560
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,000
Here, wait, listen to this.

561
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,900
What's that?

562
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,700
I was just rubbing the phone
against my fanny.

563
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,300
Did you like it?
My, oh my, it's fresh this morning.

564
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:06,900
Look at my nipples, standing up like
little soldiers. What is a girl to do?

565
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,500
Tammy, why don't we meet up now?
I'll book a table for lunch.

566
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,100
St Martin's Hotel.

567
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,100
Don't worry about a table.
We'll have room service.

568
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,400
- Yeah, OK.
- One hour.

569
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,800
Hang on.

570
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,200
Oh, shit.

571
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, leave it off, Sidney.
He's driving me fucking mad.

572
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,100
- We're not expecting Sidney, are we?
- He's too busy kissing Duke's arse.

573
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,900
Not round here, I hope.

574
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,400
No, over by Greenwich market.
So you can relax. It's just the two of us.

575
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,500
Patience. All good things
come to those who wait.

576
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,100
Stay put.

577
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,800
Hello, it's me. It's me. Shut up and listen.

578
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,200
Sidney, Duke's nephew is working down
by Greenwich Market. Go and look.

579
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,400
- Room service.
- Look for that yellow Range Rover.

580
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,100
OK.

581
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,300
- Your champagne, sir.
- I didn't order...

582
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,200
One moment, Mr. Troop. I want to hear
what this bastard has to say for himself.

583
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,600
I'm Jimmy's old colleague, Eddie Temple.

584
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,700
- Fuck!
- He told you to locate my daughter.

585
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,200
Hunt her down like some lost mongrel.

586
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,900
He said you asked for his help.

587
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:07,400
Mr. Troop could find anyone
on the planet in ten minutes flat.

588
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:13,400
If you'd laid a finger on my daughter,
you'd be over the edge like that.

589
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,500
You'd join that shit, Kinky,

590
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,000
who thought he could take my five grand
and fuck me over.

591
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,800
The audacity. How fucking dare you?

592
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,600
I've known Jimmy Price for 45 years.

593
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,600
It pays me to keep an eye on him.

594
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,300
Do you know what a remora fish is?

595
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,700
- Yes.
- Oh, you do?

596
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,200
Well, Jimmy has been swimming
in my slipstream all my fucking life.

597
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,600
I thought he might put some
volatile psychopath on the job.

598
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,100
But I've checked you out, son.
You're a smart boy.

599
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,600
But you keep very, very bad company.

600
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,200
You know, I host
a charity golf tournament every year.

601
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,800
Quite an event in the social calendar,
if I do say so myself.

602
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,300
I like to invite Jimmy. Some of my friends
find him absurdly hilarious.

603
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,500
Drinks are on me. Drinks for everyone.

604
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,500
Champagne.
Fucking good gear and all.

605
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:25,400
But I've come unstuck in my attempts
to provide a spectacle for my chums.

606
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,900
Jimmy, as usual
on the look out for tidbits,

607
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,400
has met the development minister
of some tin-pot republic.

608
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,100
They're trawling the West
for investments.

609
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:41,200
They have vast natural resources.
Quite an investment for the right man.

610
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,500
They've sent in men from Timbuktu
explaining all the details.

611
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,700
Profits, shares, long-term investments,
short-term investments.

612
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
They've even made him an honorary
citizen. Even made him one of the tribe.

613
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,500
What we didn't know,
until it all ended in tears,

614
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,100
was that the hard-line
communist insurgents

615
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,100
who control the country
outside the mining areas...

616
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,100
Bad news about our little venture, Jim.

617
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,200
The communists have broken through.

618
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,600
Heading for the capital
with little resistance.

619
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,800
What the fuck are you on about?

620
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,100
I got word they were planning a push.

621
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,500
The final coup de grâce. I told Jimmy.

622
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,600
- It's all over.
- Fuck's sake!

623
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,400
- Keep your voice down.
- Get my money out quick, now.

624
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,300
As if it was some little kiddie's
piggy bank.

625
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,800
Now, I explained that wasn't possible.
We thought we'd bought a government.

626
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,800
Maybe someone made a better offer.
Forget about it.

627
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,600
You win some, you lose some.

628
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,000
How much are we talking?

629
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,900
It's only a cheeky half-mill, Jim.

630
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,800
- It's much more than that.
- How much?

631
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,000
- 13.
- 13 what?

632
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:59,400
- 13 million pounds. I'm fucked.
- Have you gone fucking mad?

633
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:07,300
13 million pounds!
How could you be so fucking stupid?

634
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,600
You've been right grafted,
royally turned over.

635
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,500
- Like some Yank buying London Bridge.
- Don't talk to me like that.

636
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,600
He accused me of instigating it.

637
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,300
It's no coincidence
I met them at your tournament.

638
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,400
Are you fucking demented?

639
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,900
Asked me to fly to Zurich
to see the minister,

640
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,900
still parked up
in La Maison Grande, still eating well.

641
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:33,100
Big fat fucker.
On little Jimmy's nest egg.

642
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,000
Jimmy thought he'd keep Charlotte
hostage while you went to get his money.

643
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:42,300
Little Jimmy was so stupid,
he thought he couldn't lose either way.

644
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,900
I'm sorry, what?

645
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,100
If you find Charlotte,
he's got his hostage.

646
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,700
If I find you trying to find her,

647
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,700
I do his dirty work.

648
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,900
- I'm still not with you.
- Your lives are inextricably linked.

649
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,100
I've found out something
very interesting about Jimmy,

650
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,100
something I've long suspected.

651
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,800
But I'll let Jimmy explain.

652
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,700
You follow me.

653
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,200
You've no doubt suffered Jimmy's

654
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,400
" CID was geezers you
was at school with" routine?

655
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,700
The other chap's Albert Carter.

656
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,500
Another twisted bastard
from the old neighborhood.

657
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:17,100
Member of the Regional Crime Squad.
Sit back, relax and enjoy.

658
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,900
It ain't like your lot in the old days.

659
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,900
- They've all gone squeaky.
- Tell me about it, Jim.

660
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,000
I have to box clever with those
college boys from Anti-Corruption.

661
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:32,500
- Fucking dogs. Slags. Ten grand?
- It's the going rate, Jim.

662
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,300
Ten K. Hardly seems worth the bother.

663
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,900
Well, there's only so much
in those informer funds.

664
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,400
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

665
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,300
What? About me working
for the old firm? Listen. Gene...

666
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,800
...is too loyal for his own good.

667
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,900
- I don't fucking believe it.
- You better believe it.

668
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,500
- 'Cause it's fucking happening.
- Where did you get this?

669
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,900
Mr. Troop made it for me.

670
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,500
- It's one of his little hobbies.
- I don't fucking believe it.

671
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,300
Don't you want to hear
what Jimmy has to say about you?

672
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:21,600
I've got one for you.
Pluck ed and ready for the pot.

673
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,500
- Just give us a name and he's gone.
- In time.

674
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,500
I don't want a bunce.
I want him out of the way.

675
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,500
Flash young runt.
One of the new breed, ain't he?

676
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,900
Reckons he can just waltz off
into retirement.

677
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,800
I want him away for 12.

678
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,400
If he's got a kilo of class A,
he's looking at double figures.

679
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,400
- I'll put it there myself.
- Sounds personal.

680
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,500
He's got a few quid .
He'll come in handy.

681
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,800
I set him up with that slippery accountant
in the first place.

682
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,500
Fucking rag-head let slip, didn't he?

683
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,000
"You will miss him when he's gone,
Mr. Price. "

684
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,000
Is that you, the flash runt
who thinks he's retiring?

685
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,600
You'd no idea what Jimmy was up to?

686
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,400
How do you think these fuckers
earn a living?

687
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,800
I would've thought a smart young man
like you would know that already.

688
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,600
- Can I have that?
- Mr. Troop.

689
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Thank you.

690
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,600
This looks like you, son.
Smart part of town.

691
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,300
I'll keep an eye open. Must dash off.
Get home. Wash and brush up.

692
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,800
Opera tonight. The Damnation of Faust.

693
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,800
Man sells his soul to the devil. All ends
in tears. These arrangements usually do.

694
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,800
One more thing, young man.

695
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,800
Always remember, the art of good
business is being a good middleman.

696
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Bye-bye.

697
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,400
Fuck!

698
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,700
- I've got him.
- Got who?

699
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,000
Sidney, remember? Yellow Range Rover?

700
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,100
Seems they sent our friend out
for something to eat.

701
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,100
Good. Tell Morty.

702
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,800
- So what do we do now?
- Call Morty.

703
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,300
Shut up and listen.
No more insults, no more games.

704
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,700
If I do not get my cargo back,
you're a dead man.

705
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:45,100
Dragan, I've been doing some checking.

706
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,600
- I've found out who you represent.
- Good.

707
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,500
I can point you towards
your boss's merchandise.

708
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,400
- Come to my hotel...
- Look...

709
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,300
- I'd rather meet you in a public place.
- You have nothing to fear.

710
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,700
- I'm a reasonable man.
- That's not what I've heard.

711
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,400
I'll meet you at...

712
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,400
I'll meet you
at Greenwich Park Observatory.

713
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,400
- Any taxi will drop you off.
- I can read a map.

714
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:18,200
- Tomorrow. Midday.
- Tomorrow at 12.

715
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,600
I'll be there.

716
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,700
That's rude, Mr. Dragan.

717
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,500
It's Conditions Red down there.

718
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,700
They're didgy as fuck.
They haven't moved from that lock-up.

719
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,900
Have a look at the geezer at the front,
on the door.

720
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,000
I know him from somewhere.
This could get messy.

721
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,200
What about the blokes in red?

722
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,700
Mechanics.
They got a ringing coup going on.

723
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,900
The lorries come in one color,
go out another.

724
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,300
But they're nothing to do with the Duke.

725
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,100
- Fuck me, look who it isn't.
- Who's that?

726
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,700
It doesn't matter. I've got work to do.

727
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,300
- Stay here. Those pills move, call me.
- You got it.

728
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,600
- Day and night, Terry.
- What do you mean " night"?

729
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,600
- I've been here all day. Get Clarkie.
- Day and fucking night. Got it?

730
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,800
Hello, young man. Thank you
for coming at such short notice.

731
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,000
I hope you didn't feel too summoned.
How are you?

732
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,300
I'm in the best of health, Mr. Temple.
Thank you for asking.

733
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,600
- How are you keeping?
- I'm very well.

734
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,200
- How was the performance of Faust?
- Complex.

735
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,400
No wonder it took him 60 years to write it.

736
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,700
How's the family?

737
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,800
What is this? A vicar's tea party?

738
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,000
You do sometimes take
your conversations away with you.

739
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,600
Being a clever bastard, are we?

740
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:23,600
- How do I know you're not wired up?
- Well, I'm not.

741
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,500
Then we'll have to trust each other,
won't we? Sit down.

742
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,000
I've been thinking, after
our chat the other day.

743
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,600
Your pills. How much for the lot?

744
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,900
No, I've already got a buyer.

745
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,400
Nearly took my hand off.
He's putting the money together now.

746
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,000
I told you, lah. I'm still thinking.

747
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,500
It's only been three days.
What's the fucking hurry?

748
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,400
- What's he paying?
- It's confidential.

749
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,900
Don't be an idiot.
Let me match his offer.

750
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,000
They've got history.

751
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,600
Bad juju.

752
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,900
And, anyway, this Serbian maniac's
in hot pursuit.

753
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:15,100
If I sold them to you, I'd have to
disappoint him. And he is definitely not...

754
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:20,400
I did you a big fucking favor
letting you know about Jimmy.

755
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,200
I think you owe me.

756
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,400
2½ million in sterling and euros,
high-denomination used notes.

757
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:33,000
So if I gave you three million,
that would keep everyone happy.

758
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,200
Let me state my position.

759
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,800
You can sell these pills
to whoever you like.

760
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,300
That's your privilege.
That's your business.

761
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,800
But I'll tell you,

762
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:50,200
I'll be very, very unhappy
if you don't sell 'em to me.

763
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,700
You understand?

764
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,600
OK, Mr. Temple. Three million. Done.

765
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,900
- My buyer's not gonna be happy, though.
- Fuck him. He'll get over it.

766
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,800
I'm gonna need some help.

767
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,700
Someone who can eliminate the problem.
Someone who's a bit handy.

768
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,900
Whoa! Slow down, kidder.

769
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,800
Mr. Lucky does a drop of freelance work.

770
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,200
I don't need to know.
It's none of my business.

771
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,600
You tell him when,
and he'll come down on the train.

772
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,900
Thanks, Trev.

773
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,200
Excuse me.

774
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,100
Mr. Temple.

775
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,900
You deliver them to my warehouse.
When do I get my consignment?

776
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,800
Monday. No, Tuesday, probably.

777
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,400
Tuesday? I'm paying
over the odds, remember?

778
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,100
England! Typical. Even drug dealers
don't work weekends.

779
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,800
That's good news.
That should cheer Gene up.

780
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:27,100
Yeah, everything's under control.

781
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,400
- Cody's been chasing his ten grand.
- Yeah. I'll call him later.

782
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,600
- Hey, Geno, what's up?
- Got some good news.

783
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,400
Oh, yeah? What's that?

784
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,600
- You murdering bastard!
- Open the fucking door!

785
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,300
- Stay out of this, Morty.
- Gene!

786
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:56,300
- Murder? Who's dead?
- Jimmy.

787
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,600
He killed him.
Blew his fucking head away.

788
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,500
- Open this fucking door!
- Why?

789
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,200
Open this fucking door!

790
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,600
- Get off him.
- No, listen, listen. Just listen.

791
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:20,200
Listen to me, Morty.
I got a call from a cozzer we've got bent.

792
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,000
They found Jimmy's body last night.

793
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:26,400
In his own backyard.
It was this sly bastard.

794
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,000
He's no killer.
Somebody's made a mistake.

795
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,900
All right, look. Here. We'll see.

796
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,900
Read it. Read it out loud.

797
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:38,000
"To senior ranks only. Murder Squad
investigation. James Lionel Price."

798
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,700
Read the fucking ballistics report.

799
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,900
" Preliminary ballistics report. No arms
recovered. Disintegrated on impact.

800
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,900
"One recovered cartridge casing."

801
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,200
You forgot to take the cartridge case.
You got sloppy.

802
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,500
" ...consistent with weapon used

803
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:59,200
" in unsolved homicide of Lawrence
Gower a.k.a. Crazy Larry Flynn."

804
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:04,300
Wait. I got it. Whoever killed
Crazy Larry must've killed Jimmy.

805
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,700
No, no. The gun.
The fucking gun was the same.

806
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,500
The one he stole from my flat.

807
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,400
- You killed Crazy Larry?
- So?

808
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,100
- This fucker killed Jimmy.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

809
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
- Why did you do it?
- He was an informer.

810
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:34,100
- He was a police informer!
- Jimmy a grass? Are you fucking mad?

811
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:38,100
- You'll have to do better than that.
- I've got a recording at home.

812
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,700
Of Jimmy and a cozzer
called Albie Carter.

813
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:47,200
Gene, let's listen to this shit.

814
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,200
If he's lying, we'll both fucking kill him.

815
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,900
Mr. Mortimer reckons

816
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:59,500
the Tylers are bringing in shooters
from Jamaica via Manchester.

817
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,100
They got someone in Immigration
straightened out.

818
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:07,500
I don't think anybody gives a fuck
about spades shooting spades.

819
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:12,400
Don't you care
about dead darkies, Albert?

820
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,700
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

821
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,900
What? About me working for the old firm?

822
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,400
Convinced?

823
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,900
You don't fuck about, do you?

824
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,200
Jimmy was skint, huh?

825
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,900
That's why he set up the whole
Amsterdam business with Duke.

826
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,400
I really think we should keep
all of this to ourselves, right?

827
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,800
Really?

828
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,500
Why did you kill Larry?

829
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,100
Funnily enough,
it was Jimmy who persuaded me.

830
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,300
Jimmy never liked Larry.

831
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,800
Look at that wrong 'un waving
his money around. It ain't right.

832
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,400
Hey, I love you, man.

833
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:21,200
He saw the future was drugs
and it needed to be run like a business.

834
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,700
Crazy Larry
was no fucking businessman.

835
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,500
After that business with Kilburn Jerry...

836
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,700
That's it, son. You do him. Bollocks!

837
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,500
...he wanted him gone.

838
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,600
I didn't have any problem doing him.

839
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,300
That's why I did it.

840
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,800
But why did you keep the gun?

841
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,700
Sounds silly now, but it was my favorite.

842
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,300
I hope you don't tell the other guns
you've got favorites.

843
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,800
So what's the next move, boss?

844
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,200
Well, I'm going to bed.

845
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:16,200
I don't know what you two are doing.
We can talk about it tomorrow.

846
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,700
Sorry?

847
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,500
Sorry, mate, what was that?

848
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,900
Would you pack that in?
I've got a fucking test next week.

849
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,900
OK. OK, I'm sorry. I was just saying...

850
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,900
So when does the target get here, then?

851
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,200
The target? The target's gonna be here
at exactly midday.

852
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,800
Where?

853
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,200
- Here, right fucking here.
- Got a photo?

854
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,500
- Don't worry about it.
- Who's worried?

855
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,800
I'll have some binoculars.
I'll give you a little signal.

856
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:39,300
I could get the 13.10 home from here.

857
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,300
Let's have a little recce.

858
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,700
After we do the business,
walk slowly back.

859
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,600
Remember, it's a stroll in the park.

860
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,100
Don't run, whatever you do.

861
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,500
The first five minutes,
nobody'll have a clue what's going on.

862
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,900
Hopefully, it'll be mayhem.

863
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,700
So try to stay relaxed.

864
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:09,000
Don't do anything
to draw attention to yourself.

865
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,300
Or me.

866
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:17,200
Afterwards, take me to the Underground
station. I'll look after myself.

867
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,600
There.

868
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,900
Time?

869
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,200
Six minutes to twelve.

870
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,500
I hope he's not gonna be late.

871
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,400
- Maybe he'll be early.
- That'll be nice.

872
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,600
Can you see that guy on the left?

873
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
- Big fella, marching up the hill.
- That's our man.

874
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:14,600
- Are you sure?
- For fuck's sake. I'm gonna call him.

875
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,300
It's up to you. You're the client.

876
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,200
- As soon as he answers, he's gone, OK?
- Okey-dokey.

877
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,300
Stand by.

878
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,100
Now.

879
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:46,300
Hello, may I help you?

880
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:53,100
Don't move a muscle.

881
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:57,600
- Do I have your attention?
- Yes.

882
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,200
You English, you have no idea
of honor and respect.

883
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:09,600
I usually kill for less.
I want my cargo and the Duke.

884
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,800
I haven't got your pills.
Just give me a day.

885
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,800
Don't piss in my pock et
and tell me it's raining.

886
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,700
Now listen for the last time.

887
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,400
- You'll bring me what is mine.
- Look, I don't... Jesus!

888
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,600
You have one more day.

889
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:36,800
See you tomorrow at dusk by the statue.
Remember, I will be watching you.

890
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,900
What the fuck were you thinking?

891
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,400
Getting Trevor's man down here
to shoot this Serb in a park!

892
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,300
Trevor's gonna go ballistic.
Now, what the fuck do I tell him?

893
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,900
- What a fucking mess.
- You've gone mad.

894
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:02,900
- Think you're a gangster?
- Fuck off!

895
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,400
You want to play?
You do it somewhere else.

896
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:09,000
If you do it near me,
I'll put you in a fucking wheelchair.

897
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,000
Stick to your fucking sums.

898
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,500
Listen. Listen to me.

899
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,800
Dragan's killed Paul.
He's done the Duke.

900
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,600
He's just put a bullet
between Lucky's eyes. I was there!

901
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,600
He's watching our every move.
Who's next, me?

902
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,800
- I wish.
- Fuck off! It could've been you or Morty.

903
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,800
Dragan said he wanted the pills
and the Duke. Where's the Duke?

904
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,200
What?

905
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,800
I should've told you this earlier.

906
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,600
Duke and Slasher
came by the office the other day.

907
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,900
Paul the boatman was topped last night.
I've got to get on my toes sharpish.

908
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,800
I want Jimmy
brought here right now, yeah?

909
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,400
Getting that smug fucking yuppie bastard
to tell Duke those pills were useless,

910
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,000
after sending us over in the first place.

911
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,200
Hang on, you've lost me now.

912
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,900
If you have us over, I swear by fucking
almighty God, I'll call the fucking law.

913
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,900
- What are you talking about?
- I'll call the law.

914
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,100
She didn't mean that. She's upset.

915
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,100
Shut the fuck up!

916
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,300
That's where playing
at being a gangster gets you.

917
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,300
You're not in there 'cause I like you.

918
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,300
I'm beginning to feel left out.

919
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,000
Why?

920
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,800
Freddie Hurst is still in intensive care

921
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,400
after your jolly little reunion
the other day.

922
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:02,000
Fucking hell, Duke.

923
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,800
For once, you might be of some use.

924
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,300
That was Gazza on the phone. It's on.

925
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,300
He'll pick you up at nine in the morning.
Gallows Corner. You know it?

926
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,000
Yeah.

927
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:36,800
With Jimmy gone, these pills will make
a nice contribution to my retirement fund,

928
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,800
so don't fuck things up again, OK?

929
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:46,200
If you do, you'll wish this Dragan had
shot you between the eyes, understand?

930
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,800
Best of luck.

931
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,300
Thanks.

932
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,100
Fuck off!

933
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:20,800
Sidney, I've told you,
stop answering my phone, OK?

934
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,900
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

935
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,200
- All right?
- Hello, Sidney.

936
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,700
- How you doing, then?
- I'm all right. How are you?

937
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,700
I'm all right, mate, yeah.

938
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:43,000
Gazza, this place stinks. We want to
get you out of here. 50 pence a pill.

939
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,600
That way, we all come out
with something.

940
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:51,000
- I think they're worth more than that.
- This is a reality check.

941
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,100
Paul's dead, Jimmy's dead. Duke and
Slasher, fuck knows where they are.

942
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,400
This gear is knock-off,
and the Serbs you nicked it from,

943
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,000
they'd kill you like you'd take a piss.

944
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,000
Gazza, the Old Bill are outside!

945
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,400
- Gazza, no!
- Go, go, go!

946
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:12,500
- Let's have it!
- Don't point that gun at me.

947
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,900
- Put it down!
- We're going in!

948
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,800
Gazza, look at me. Put it down.
You're gonna get us all shot.

949
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,100
Fuck it! Boat!

950
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,100
Stay there!

951
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,400
Fuck!

952
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,800
Come on!

953
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,800
- Gazza, wait!
- Fucking hurry up, then!

954
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,700
Get in.

955
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,400
Is this for me?

956
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,100
Yes.

957
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,000
Your cargo's gone, I'm afraid.

958
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:31,200
- It was seized by...
- I know already.

959
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,700
- How do you know?
- I watched.

960
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:38,200
I don't believe this.
Captain's gonna go fucking spare!

961
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,800
We are in shit.
You lot have fucked up again.

962
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,900
Oh, fucking hell.

963
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,800
Leave it to me, lads.
I'll explain to Inspector Cox

964
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:51,300
that his suspect has scarpered
'cause of your blundering.

965
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,600
Knobheads. Helmets off.

966
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,000
Does this settle things, then?

967
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:28,200
Tango Foxtrot, over.

968
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,900
Delta Uniform...

969
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,000
How did that other errand go?

970
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:44,100
Success, as far as I could make out.

971
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:50,100
Where is my fucking prisoner?

972
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,200
- You old ladies couldn't catch a cold.
- Sir, I just...

973
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,100
Shut up, you soppy wanker.

974
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,700
- Indigo...
- Dingo Bongo.

975
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,800
- Is this area now secure?
- Yes, sir.

976
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,500
You can fuck off, then.

977
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:08,700
So where are the pills, genius?

978
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,500
I think this is them now.

979
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,100
What the fuck?

980
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,400
- Couldn't leave this behind.
- Greenies.

981
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,800
You are in the wrong game.
You should work with us.

982
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:33,200
- Are we square?
- Yeah, we're sweet.

983
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,600
It seems so. Your pills
are in the back. Help yourself.

984
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,000
Hello.

985
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,500
OK. Yes, I will do. Bye-bye.

986
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,300
You're off the hook, Morty.
Freddie Hurst is out of his coma.

987
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,600
Good news.

988
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,200
- Yeah.
- Good news, mate.

989
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,800
Listen, I've got one for you.

990
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:42,500
Irishman caught his son snorting Charlie.

991
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:47,100
He said, " If I catch you doing that again,
I'll rub your fucking nose in it."

992
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,700
- Do you have the pills?
- In the cars.

993
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,700
Boss wants to see you in his office.

994
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,200
Come in. Sit down.

995
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,900
Here you are. Payment.

996
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:54,900
- You look shocked, son.
- Are you taking the fucking piss?

997
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:01,300
You and Jimmy have caused my little
angel Charlotte considerable anxiety.

998
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:05,000
She's off to Arizona
for a course of intense treatment.

999
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:09,200
I'm keeping those pills for myself,
by way of compensation.

1000
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:13,900
I think I'm entitled. Simple. End of.

1001
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:17,900
The amount of trouble
you've caused the last few days.

1002
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,900
Jimmy.

1003
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,300
Poor little Jimmy.

1004
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,000
It would be in your interests

1005
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:28,400
if this thing finishes here, now, today.
Understand?

1006
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:33,300
It doesn't matter what I do.
This lot are gonna come after you.

1007
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,900
They're too long in the tooth
to rampage round the country,

1008
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:41,300
looking for revenge. Look at 'em.

1009
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,200
Bunch of under-endowed,
ageing fuck pigs.

1010
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,300
Are you enjoying this?

1011
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,500
No. On the contrary.
Take it as a compliment.

1012
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,700
You're a bright young man.

1013
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,800
This monkey business is in your blood,
under your skin.

1014
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:00,000
You're not getting out, you're just
getting in. I've every faith in you.

1015
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:07,000
One day, it will be you sitting here telling
some young Turk the facts of life.

1016
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,200
And they are, Mr. Temple?

1017
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:20,900
You're born, you take shit.

1018
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,500
Get out in the world, you take more shit.

1019
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:29,000
Climb a little higher, you take less shit.

1020
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:32,000
Until one day, you're up
in the rarefied atmosphere,

1021
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,700
and you've forgotten what shit
even looks like.

1022
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,900
Welcome to the layer cake, son.

1023
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:59,900
This thing ends here, tonight.
You understand?

1024
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,300
Drug money's easy money, not grief.

1025
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,200
The odds, as you can see,
are against you.

1026
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,800
Goodnight.

1027
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,600
If you're gonna hang around in this game,
that's where you've got to be.

1028
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,900
In your bonded warehouse with
the ex-soldiers doing the dirty work,

1029
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,300
while you deliver the suspect lecture

1030
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:57,000
to baffle your opponents
and cover your tracks.

1031
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:02,200
The art of good business
is being a good middleman.

1032
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,800
Putting people together. I'll always
thank Eddie for telling me that.

1033
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,300
It's all about honor and respect.

1034
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:15,600
This is the end, Mr. Duke, as I told you.

1035
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,500
Do you know what?
I fucking enjoyed that, brother.

1036
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:09,700
Just like the old days, Shanks.
A nice bit of armed robbery.

1037
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:14,500
All right? Where do you want
the money sent, lah?

1038
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:18,400
I'll let you know as soon as I do.
Again, I am sorry about Lucky.

1039
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:23,800
Don't worry about it, kidder.
Man was a prick, anyway. Later.

1040
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,200
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1041
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:30,900
Did I really think Eddie was gonna
give me three million for those pills?

1042
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,200
Did I fuck.

1043
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:37,500
But suddenly there was a void
where once there was Jimmy Price.

1044
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:42,300
And after a couple of days, Eddie's little
getting-in-and-getting-out speech

1045
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:45,600
started to make sense.

1046
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,600
- Angelo. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1047
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,500
- Can we get some privacy?
- Of course.

1048
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:27,700
The king is dead.

1049
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,300
Long live the king.

1050
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,100
Well, I'm honored.

1051
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:42,500
But for me this is all over. I'm getting out.

1052
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:45,100
What was true then is true now.

1053
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:49,200
Have a plan. Stick to it.

1054
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,100
So I'm sure you must have
lots to discuss,

1055
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,600
but I have no business being here.

1056
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,000
I've got someone to meet.

1057
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,700
Adios, amigos.

1058
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,300
Paul the boatman.

1059
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,000
Kinky.

1060
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,600
The Duke.

1061
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,500
Slasher.

1062
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,300
Kilburn Jerry.

1063
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,200
Crazy Larry.

1064
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,100
Mr. Lucky.

1065
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,100
Troop.

1066
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,100
Jimmy.

1067
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,200
I don't want to add my name to that list.

1068
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,900
My name? If you knew that,
you'd be as clever as me.

1069
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,300
No!

1070
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,800
I'm sorry.
