1
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:17,360
THE AVIATOR'S WIFE

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,340
or ONE CAN'T THINK OF NOTHING

3
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:46,320
François, I've found someone
for that plumbing job.

4
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,480
Give me the address.

5
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,520
Anne Coudriére...

6
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:57,520
56 rue Reineken...

7
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,360
near Boulevard Pereire.

8
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:05,061
- When's he coming?
- Tomorrow.

9
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,080
Couldn't it be later?

10
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:11,360
He'll be busy;

11
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:14,080
Saturday's his only free day, anyway.

12
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:17,320
She'll be out.

13
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,240
Take it or leave it.

14
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,400
Let me know by two o'clock.

15
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,680
It won't be easy, letting her know.

16
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:35,791
She's not on the phone and
I shouldn't call her at the office.

17
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:43,680
I'll leave a note at her place
saying I'll be in touch later.

18
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,120
Have you any paper?
I've nothing to write on.

19
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:58,211
I'll see you at a quarter to two
at the station buffet

20
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,400
near the rue de Verdun exit...

21
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,391
Don't be later than two.

22
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:42,920
Call me at the Hotel Rodin,

23
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,760
361 6595. Christian

24
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,251
Hold on, I'll let you in.

25
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:44,440
Come in. What's the matter?

26
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:48,960
I didn't mean to wake you.

27
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,971
I won't be in Paris again

28
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,391
for at least a month.

29
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:00,481
I meant to write to you,
but it's difficult.

30
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,001
I'd better just tell you.

31
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:07,560
I'll be back,
but I won't be seeing you.

32
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:13,600
Even if I could,
neither of us would want it.

33
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:19,281
My wife's moving to Paris and...

34
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,611
She's expecting a baby,

35
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:26,920
so I'm going back to her.

36
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:29,521
We love each other.

37
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,520
Congratulations.

38
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:37,761
- I'm sorry to tell you so...
- It's all right.

39
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,191
I'll get dressed.
Close the window if you're cold.

40
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:26,760
Just sit down.

41
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:29,280
It's cold.

42
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:30,480
It'll warm up.

43
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,080
Did you do these?

44
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:35,000
No, my little niece.

45
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:37,920
I thought maybe
you did them as a child.

46
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:41,800
Mine disappeared long ago.

47
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,119
Sit down.

48
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:47,120
I must go.
Can we meet at lunchtime?

49
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,440
I have a hairdresser's appointment.

50
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,720
Just stay.

51
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:01,131
Walk with me to the office,
if you have time.

52
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:03,841
Is it cold out?

53
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:07,040
It's going to be a nice day,

54
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,280
apart from some rain later.

55
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:10,440
Are you sure?

56
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:13,200
I won't swear about the rain.

57
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,880
- Have you had breakfast?
- No. I'll make coffee.

58
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,440
No, I'll do it.

59
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:27,680
This tap!

60
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:30,121
You need a plumber.

61
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:34,771
The pipe needs renewing.

62
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,520
I know. You're in the way,
standing there.

63
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:45,600
Anne,

64
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,481
can I talk to you?

65
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:53,160
I'd better go.

66
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,320
No, stay.

67
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,691
- I'd like one last kiss.
- What's the point?

68
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,241
I can't leave you like this.

69
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,651
You've already left me.

70
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:17,761
Are you angry with me?

71
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:19,040
Yes.

72
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:23,011
No. You're entitled
to love whom you like.

73
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:25,661
No obligation to come and tell me.

74
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,681
You'd rather I'd written?

75
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:31,040
Walked out without a word?

76
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:36,280
Maybe I walked out on you.
I really enjoyed my holiday

77
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:38,791
Who were you with?

78
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:43,620
You don't know him,
very good-looking and he loves me.

79
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm glad for you, truly.

80
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,960
It's very sweet of you to pay
a friendly call at 7 a.m.

81
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:55,240
I'd left you a note.

82
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,951
I'm always glad to see friends.

83
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:01,731
You're trembling.

84
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:03,640
Are you cold?

85
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,040
Yes, you left the window open.

86
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:08,531
Yes, it's my fault.

87
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,600
Oh, come off it; stop that.

88
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:18,701
I still love you, you know.

89
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,221
Love me from afar, then.

90
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,640
I intend to.

91
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,720
I can love like that, too, you know.

92
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:34,411
I needn't always be with someone.

93
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:36,560
Here, if you want to help...

94
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,880
I like your place,

95
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,920
but it's a pity
there's no kitchen.

96
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,880
Who needs one? I have lunch
near the office. Evenings I go out,

97
00:11:57,121 --> 00:12:00,640
or settle for a snack.

98
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,160
Don't fuss, Anne. It'll turn up.

99
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,291
If I don't find it now,
I never will.

100
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:39,000
Try again, be systematic.

101
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,760
I already have.

102
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:50,240
What was it?
717? Sonnomateg?

103
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:03,501
It's for you.

104
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:04,720
Who is it?

105
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:06,760
Who's calling?

106
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:08,640
François.

107
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:12,241
Hang up,
say I'm at a meeting.

108
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:15,071
I'm afraid she's at a meeting.

109
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,040
How long?

110
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:21,320
Hang up on him.

111
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:33,720
I marked it ''pink file''

112
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,431
and this is the only pink file
there is.

113
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:40,640
Every time I come back from holiday
I find the same mess.

114
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:43,840
She didn't even put it in my tray.

115
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:54,811
It's François again.

116
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,640
Hang up, I don't want to talk to him.

117
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,400
He'll only call back.

118
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,360
It's crowded.

119
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,040
I must go in half an hour.

120
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,840
I give up, you try.

121
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:02,601
It's a waste of time.

122
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,440
Time has flown today.

123
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,120
You seem on edge.

124
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:14,440
Do I look tired?

125
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,160
Rather refreshed, I'd say.

126
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:19,881
Strange how that happens
when you sleep badly.

127
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,080
But that's not it.

128
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:27,280
Guess who came to see me.

129
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:28,160
When?

130
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:32,520
A Gruyere cheese sandwich, please.

131
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:35,120
Welsh rarebit and a salad for me.

132
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:37,880
The platter is good.

133
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,800
No, Welsh rarebit.

134
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:51,480
Can you bring the sandwich now?
Don't wait for the Welsh rarebit.

135
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:52,641
Don't say that.

136
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,560
She'll take no notice.

137
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,480
Still, you needn't have said it.

138
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:03,120
Never mind,
at least it calms me down.

139
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:08,920
Come on, guess who came to see me
at seven this morning.

140
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:13,520
Who?

141
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,401
A ghost from the past.

142
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,560
Christian?

143
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:19,281
Were you expecting him?

144
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:24,520
No, he was trying to leave a note
and he woke me, that's all.

145
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:26,221
Is he here for long?

146
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:29,240
He's leaving this afternoon.

147
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,121
He comes back in a month.

148
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:34,400
He's moving to Paris for good.

149
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,051
You must be pleased.

150
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:40,240
- See how wrong you were to worry?
- His wife's coming, too.

151
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,341
She'll keep an eye on him.

152
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:44,431
I'm afraid so.

153
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,080
He wants her here.

154
00:17:47,161 --> 00:17:49,911
She's having a baby,
so I have to accept...

155
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:52,400
fidelity and conjugal love.

156
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:55,021
Well, I no longer love him,

157
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:56,560
if I ever did.

158
00:17:57,801 --> 00:17:59,160
So that's all right.

159
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:00,901
You're not upset?

160
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:06,600
Oh, no. I admit I was very close
to tears this morning...

161
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,840
seeing him so stern,
almost pleased with himself.

162
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:16,610
- I was pleased, too. Good riddance.
- You felt he'd divorce?

163
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,880
No, he never thought of marrying me.

164
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:22,880
If you love, you marry.

165
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,080
You always generalize.

166
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:27,440
Most people feel as I do.

167
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,171
I don't understand you.

168
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:33,040
You complain,
yet you won't live with anyone.

169
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,811
Want this? I'm not hungry.

170
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,440
Loving doesn't mean
living together.

171
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:48,671
Do you really believe
the things you say?

172
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:12,431
You're living in a dream world.

173
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:17,301
How can you keep a man
if he isn't with you?

174
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:19,501
I don't understand...

175
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:22,480
or, rather,
I understand all too well.

176
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,931
These guys claim
to be madly in love...

177
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:29,171
but go on living with their wives,
getting them pregnant.

178
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm marrying because I don't want
that kind of disillusionment.

179
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:44,200
I found ''being available'' fun, too,
going from man to man.

180
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:48,280
But you get older.

181
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:51,400
Speak for yourself.
I'm not on the shelf yet.

182
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:53,560
Marriage is a beginning,
not an end.

183
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:56,040
Some beginning,
looking at your Jean-Pierre!

184
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,341
- And what about François?
- I'm not marrying François.

185
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,801
Well, to each his own.

186
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:06,120
But how can you love such
different men... at the same time?

187
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:11,240
Do you really think I'm looking
for some particular type?

188
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:16,871
What interests me isn't whether
someone's tall, short, dark or fair.

189
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,720
It's on another level entirely.

190
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,000
So what has François got?

191
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:27,280
The poor creep isn't
everyone's idea of the ideal pick-up.

192
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:29,391
Talk of the devil!

193
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:38,480
Am I intruding?

194
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,960
No, I was just leaving.

195
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:44,781
- Me too, so the table's yours.
- I'm not hungry.

196
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:46,391
You can have my sandwich.

197
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:47,200
No, thanks.

198
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,471
Who told you I was here?

199
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:53,531
No one, I tried
all the cafés around here.

200
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:59,701
I must go, I'll be late
at the hairdresser's.

201
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,040
I've something to tell you.

202
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:07,800
Some other time, and don't try
to call me at the office.

203
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:11,000
I've found a plumber for you

204
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:13,080
and I've got to let him know.

205
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:14,880
Another day won't matter.

206
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:17,320
But he's free tomorrow.

207
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:20,120
I must go to my mother's.

208
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:21,840
What can we do?

209
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,381
Leave your keys with the concierge.

210
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:26,320
Fine. Goodbye.

211
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:29,491
Wait. I'd better be there myself.

212
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:31,200
No need to bother.

213
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,911
You know it's no bother.

214
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:45,891
I'll walk with you.

215
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:48,440
It's on my way.

216
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:52,600
- Where are you going?
- The Metro, to meet my friend.

217
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:53,880
It's that way.

218
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:56,781
The Etoile station
will do just as well.

219
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,440
I met my friend this morning,

220
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:07,080
he told me about the plumber.

221
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,360
Hurry and say it's OK.

222
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:11,080
There's plenty of time.

223
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:16,271
I came because I know you don't
like me calling you at the office.

224
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:21,280
For something like this, it's OK.

225
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:25,160
No, but I wanted to tell you...

226
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:29,640
I came round at eight this morning.
I saw you both leave.

227
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:35,680
I'll tell you about it,
but not here, not right now.

228
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,000
It was a shock.

229
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,911
I'll tell you all about it.

230
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:42,080
I thought he'd gone.

231
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:44,120
He came back.

232
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:47,131
Believe me,
there's nothing to worry about.

233
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:51,571
When can we talk about it?

234
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,160
I don't know.

235
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:54,040
Tonight?

236
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:55,461
I'm busy tonight.

237
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:56,280
Tomorrow?

238
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:58,040
I'll be at my mother's.

239
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:01,640
Monday evening, then.

240
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:02,851
I'll be working.

241
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,011
Before that. It won't take hours.

242
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:06,800
I can't wait till Monday.

243
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:11,051
- You shouldn't have spied, then!
- I was only doing you a favour.

244
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:13,251
Just trust me. Go away.

245
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:16,731
Are you seeing him tonight?

246
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,371
Has he been in Paris long?

247
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:21,471
Go away, or I'll make a scene.

248
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:25,440
Are you seeing him tonight?

249
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:28,360
Stop getting at me!

250
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:32,000
I think I've some rights in the matter.

251
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,400
If you don't trust me, go to hell!

252
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:38,280
You said
you wouldn't see him again!

253
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:40,000
I did not.

254
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:42,840
I said he'd gone.

255
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,851
It wasn't likely he'd come back,

256
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:47,680
but he did.

257
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:48,520
When?

258
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:53,880
You wouldn't ask
if you felt anything for me.

259
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:55,920
Do you love him?

260
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:02,680
Leave me alone; I'll stop seeing you
if you go on like this.

261
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,560
Put yourself in my shoes.

262
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:09,760
Try putting yourself in mine;
if you felt for me, you wouldn't ask.

263
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:16,640
If you want to know,
he's leaving this afternoon.

264
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:18,120
Are you happy now?

265
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:25,981
Wait a second.

266
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,720
No. See you on Monday.

267
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:48,521
Have I kept you waiting long?

268
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:52,520
It's settled.

269
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:55,480
She's leaving the keys
with the concierge.

270
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:57,080
You've got the address?

271
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:00,520
That's it, then. I must go now.

272
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:45,280
Where's the Place des Fìtes?

273
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:47,880
lt's the other way.

274
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:53,120
I don't want to go there,
I just want to get my bearings.

275
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:54,381
It's easy enough.

276
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,120
Where are you headed?

277
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:59,080
Well, I don't know the address.

278
00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:00,960
You don't know, then.

279
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:04,680
Yes, someone drove me there;

280
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:06,741
it's near a big avenue.

281
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,640
Plenty of those around here, all alike.

282
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:15,280
I'll find it.
I have a good sense of direction.

283
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:16,680
I'd never have guessed.

284
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:18,131
I think it's this way.

285
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,600
Near the town hall?

286
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:25,480
No need to walk, then;
you could have stayed on the bus.

287
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:28,280
Follow me.

288
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:33,080
It's nicer in the park,
it's such a lovely day.

289
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,960
Do you spend your time in parks?

290
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,240
No, today's an exception.

291
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,040
For me, too. I'd be at school,

292
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,101
but my teacher's on strike.

293
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:46,600
I didn't feel like staying indoors,

294
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:49,400
so here I am with my books.

295
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:51,211
Can you work out of doors?

296
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,800
I work best like that.

297
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,880
In buses, trains, parks...

298
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,720
where it's noisy.

299
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:59,960
Some people study in cafés,

300
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:01,600
but not me.

301
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:02,901
You're a student?

302
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,160
Yes, I'm preparing for an exam,

303
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:08,360
but I have to work for my living.

304
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,600
You're not working now?

305
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,881
I work nights and sleep days.

306
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,600
You're not sleeping now.

307
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:18,721
I should be, but I was a bit
on edge, so I couldn't.

308
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:19,821
And right now?

309
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:23,760
I have this errand to do.

310
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:30,880
Where are you off to?

311
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:34,000
It's this way you want to go.

312
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:38,880
Oh, do as you like.

313
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:03,880
Shall we sit down?

314
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:05,881
What about your errand?

315
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:10,280
There's no hurry. It's only three...
no, half past three.

316
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:12,761
I'm going to sit, anyway.

317
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:18,200
All right, but not another word.

318
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:20,160
I'm working.

319
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:21,920
So am I.

320
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,040
Common law.

321
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:32,680
Does that interest you?

322
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:35,600
No, I'm not taking up law.

323
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:39,800
What about you? German.

324
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,001
It's my second language,
after English.

325
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:45,840
I also do Latin.
Did you do German?

326
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:48,160
No, I hear it's difficult.

327
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,840
Not if you know some Latin.

328
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:54,400
We weren't to talk.

329
00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:47,480
- Not reading?
- How about you?

330
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:50,120
- I can look up, can't I?
- So can I.

331
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:52,360
- What are you looking at?
- And you?

332
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm looking at you looking.

333
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:58,480
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing. It's my lookout, anyway.

334
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:01,160
No, it affects my outlook.

335
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:05,160
It's not polite
when you're talking to someone.

336
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:09,400
I wasn't talking, you said not to.

337
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:11,520
So let's both shut up.

338
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:15,320
I think you've been watching
those two since the bus.

339
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,200
Which two?

340
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:17,960
You know very well.

341
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:19,880
Don't point at them.

342
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:21,760
Just let them be.

343
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:25,880
You're following them.

344
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,880
I know you're following them!

345
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:29,560
Quiet, they'll hear you.

346
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:30,720
So far away?

347
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:33,520
So what,
if you're not following them?

348
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:36,760
I just don't want them to think I am.

349
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:39,480
Why on earth should they?

350
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:41,760
Please don't.

351
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:43,160
Let's move on.

352
00:35:44,321 --> 00:35:45,640
No, let's stay.

353
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:47,400
Frightened?

354
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,040
I don't like feeling ridiculous.

355
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,400
But if you don't know them...

356
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:54,000
Now listen.

357
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:57,841
I am following them,
if you want to know.

358
00:35:58,521 --> 00:35:59,771
Are you a detective?

359
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:02,880
No... well, yes, in a way.

360
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:04,160
In the police?

361
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:06,591
No, private... private eye stuff.

362
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:09,280
With an agency?

363
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:14,640
Yes, I do enquiries for husbands
who suspect their wives.

364
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:16,880
What an exciting job.

365
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,401
But you told me
that you worked at night.

366
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:22,240
We have no set hours.

367
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:27,111
- So she's with her boyfriend?
- That's a professional secret.

368
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:29,261
They're not being very amorous.

369
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:35,240
I have an idea they suspect
you're following them.

370
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:36,731
You think so?

371
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:40,680
Yes, I think you need
further training.

372
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:44,600
You shouldn't confide in a stranger.

373
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,480
What if I told them
who you are?

374
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:51,280
You wouldn't.
Why would you do that?

375
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,080
To make trouble for you.

376
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:55,560
I don't like cops.

377
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:56,960
I'm no cop.

378
00:36:57,241 --> 00:37:01,160
What harm has that woman done,
anyway? It's her life.

379
00:37:02,361 --> 00:37:04,440
I'm going to tell them.

380
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:10,560
Let me go! I'll scream!

381
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,640
Stop it, they'll hear you

382
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,691
To hell with it, I'm off!

383
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:18,720
If you could see your face!

384
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:22,001
I wasn't really going to tell them.

385
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:24,741
I don't think they've spotted us.

386
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:27,671
Would be sacked if they had?

387
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,320
Would the agency sack you?

388
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:33,960
All right, I lied to you.

389
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:35,600
I'm no detective.

390
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:41,320
I knew it was just a dodge
for picking up girls.

391
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:43,560
That's why I teased you.

392
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:48,360
Picking up girls isn't my style,

393
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:50,680
especially not today.

394
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:19,981
You want to know?

395
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:27,560
I'm following them,
but I'm no detective.

396
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:29,280
What are you, then?

397
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:30,520
Nothing.

398
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,720
The man is someone I know;

399
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,821
a friend of my girl.

400
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,661
A friend or a lover?

401
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,880
Ex-lover;
I thought they'd broken off.

402
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,680
And now you don't?

403
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,121
I have no idea.

404
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:55,211
What a super story! Tell me more,
it's most interesting.

405
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,080
That's all.

406
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,520
Does he know you?

407
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:04,240
Of course not... I hope.

408
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:07,000
But you know him?

409
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:09,920
Just by sight; if it is him.

410
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:11,560
You're not sure?

411
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:14,000
Yes, it's him, it must be.

412
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:19,221
I don't understand. Did you follow
him from his place, or what?

413
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:23,240
No, the extraordinary thing
is that I spotted him in a café.

414
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:27,880
So? I see lots of people
I know in cafés.

415
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:32,080
Yes, but I'd already seen him
elsewhere this morning.

416
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:36,560
And you'll see him again;
misfortunes come in threes.

417
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:41,040
- Don't talk of misfortune.
- Why, would you kill him? Beware!

418
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:44,640
What are you going to do, though?

419
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:47,600
Nothing.

420
00:39:47,961 --> 00:39:50,511
What's the point
of following them, then?

421
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:52,320
None, really.

422
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:58,960
I just needed to find something
to do this afternoon.

423
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:04,211
So when I saw them leave the café,
I left too, following automatically

424
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:06,800
and got on the same bus.

425
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:10,320
And automatically picked me up.

426
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:13,480
That was a purely
accidental encounter.

427
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:17,640
All right,
but what are you going to do?

428
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,441
Nothing, I tell you;
there's no point.

429
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,760
Will you tell your girl?

430
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:29,080
No, the situation
is bad enough as it is.

431
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:33,560
She wouldn't believe me,
because he was supposed...

432
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:36,560
to leave Paris this afternoon.

433
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:37,611
At what time?

434
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,560
I don't know.

435
00:40:40,681 --> 00:40:42,481
The afternoon isn't over yet.

436
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:47,360
The ideal thing
would be a photograph.

437
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:54,560
Brilliant! I'll borrow their camera
and be right back.

438
00:41:52,361 --> 00:41:56,080
Press this and the picture
comes out there.

439
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:42,280
The light is lovely today.

440
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:11,040
I'd like that tree in the photo;

441
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:13,400
it's my tree fetish.

442
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:05,240
Failed.

443
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:09,600
She probably felt them out,
except for a wisp of hair.

444
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:13,561
She probably felt
they spoiled the picture.

445
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:16,800
Well, what do I care?

446
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,981
I've got a nice photograph.

447
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:27,640
You want it?

448
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:30,580
You're not getting it.

449
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:35,480
I don't give my picture
to just any old wolf.

450
00:44:36,161 --> 00:44:39,480
- I'm not a wolf.
- Oh, that yarn about your girl!

451
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:47,040
Don't kid me that any girl
could love you and that guy.

452
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:51,360
He's not bad; I had a good look.

453
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:56,040
He's as much like you as that duck
is like an orang-utan.

454
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:57,960
That's what amazes me.

455
00:44:58,281 --> 00:45:02,560
You mean you wouldn't be amazed
if he looked like you?

456
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,920
It would sadden me.

457
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:08,440
This saddens me,
but it amazes me as well.

458
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:12,120
They don't go together at all...

459
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:15,181
and she told me she didn't love him.

460
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:17,260
What a woman says...

461
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:28,011
Maybe my problems bore you?

462
00:45:29,441 --> 00:45:32,600
Not at all, you amuse me.

463
00:45:34,721 --> 00:45:36,271
You think I'm ridiculous?

464
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:43,560
Yes, people wrapped up in
their own problems always seem so.

465
00:45:43,721 --> 00:45:45,920
You mustn't mind that.

466
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:51,080
Is she pretty?

467
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:54,400
Who? My girl? Yes, very.

468
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:56,240
Prettier than her?

469
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:58,000
They're different.

470
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:04,360
You won't find ten like her in Paris.

471
00:46:06,641 --> 00:46:07,880
Well, a hundred.

472
00:46:08,321 --> 00:46:10,421
Even a thousand
would be something

473
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:13,621
Like to see her picture?

474
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:31,880
Yes, she's lovely.

475
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:35,800
Her eyes are lovely, but so sad.

476
00:46:36,681 --> 00:46:37,640
Is she sad?

477
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:39,120
Not really.

478
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:43,400
It just looks that way
in photographs.

479
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,360
Actually, she's quite cheerful.
She laughs a lot.

480
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:49,000
As much as me?

481
00:46:49,401 --> 00:46:51,080
Well, it's different.

482
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:53,760
She's twenty-five.

483
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:58,680
- You're younger, aren't you?
- Quite a bit; I'm twenty.

484
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:01,160
I'm fifteen.

485
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:03,680
So I'm half-way between you.

486
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:13,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

487
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:15,960
Who is he?

488
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:19,120
The Prince of Corregidor,

489
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:22,440
waiting to carry me
to his castles in Spain.

490
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:25,600
No, he's a road-sweeper.

491
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:29,001
I don't want to talk about it.
I haven't one, anyway.

492
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:31,360
I'm only fifteen, sir.

493
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:34,360
Do you have a picture?

494
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:38,200
Of my boyfriend?
No picture and no boyfriend.

495
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:40,760
I bet you have one in your wallet.

496
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:46,840
I told you, he's a road-sweeper,
black and the Muslim religion...

497
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:49,720
forbids the taking of pictures.

498
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:54,000
I told you about mine.

499
00:47:57,001 --> 00:48:01,201
You telling me your life story...
doesn't mean I must tell you mine.

500
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:04,240
If my boy cheated on me,

501
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:07,760
I'd keep my sorrow to myself.

502
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:11,041
And I wouldn't follow him about.

503
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:15,080
Or the girl with whom he...

504
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:20,160
Anyway, you're spinning yarns.

505
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:24,800
No, that's how it is;
I can hardly believe it myself.

506
00:48:26,121 --> 00:48:28,400
You're beginning
to make me wonder

507
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:31,360
whether I'm awake or dreaming.

508
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:34,560
- You're dreaming.
- Could be.

509
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:37,920
No, I mean
you're dreaming up a movie

510
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,840
about a total stranger.

511
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:47,560
I tell you it's him, but
it doesn't really matter if it isn't.

512
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:49,920
I felt like walking.

513
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,520
It gave me a purpose;
then when I met you...

514
00:48:52,521 --> 00:48:54,520
That gave you another purpose.

515
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:06,080
Well, it did me good to talk.
Also...

516
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:10,240
It's strange. I hardly know you,

517
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:13,040
yet I can talk to you.

518
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:17,091
I've never talked
about my troubles before.

519
00:49:18,241 --> 00:49:20,680
I don't know what's got into me.

520
00:49:22,121 --> 00:49:23,720
Lack of sleep, probably.

521
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:27,120
Do you believe me?

522
00:49:30,561 --> 00:49:33,960
What difference does it make?

523
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:37,471
I'm sure there's truth
in what you say,

524
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:41,000
but you tell a good story, too.

525
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:43,400
So do I,

526
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:45,571
but only to people who don't.

527
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,880
Some talk and others listen.

528
00:49:53,481 --> 00:49:54,480
They've gone.

529
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:03,160
Here they are, they're coming.

530
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:07,480
Pretend to be talking.
What can we talk about?

531
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:10,880
Spin me another yarn.

532
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:15,760
What I told you was 100% true.

533
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:18,800
50%. Didn't you invent anything?

534
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:22,440
Yes, you did.

535
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:24,480
Not so loud; talk naturally.

536
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:28,680
It's you who's not acting natural.

537
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:33,000
It's your conspiratorial air
that makes us conspicuous.

538
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:37,791
- German is easy, you were saying.
- For me, anyway.

539
00:50:37,961 --> 00:50:41,061
Listen. My teacher says
I have a very good accent.

540
00:50:45,281 --> 00:50:46,331
He looked at us.

541
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:50,640
- I'm off.
- Let them get ahead.

542
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:53,400
But we've been spotted...

543
00:50:55,481 --> 00:50:58,520
- He looked at you.
- I was bawling in German!

544
00:50:59,161 --> 00:51:00,440
What did it mean?

545
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:08,600
No idea.
Most likely he doesn't know German.

546
00:51:08,761 --> 00:51:09,861
He's from Alsace.

547
00:51:10,361 --> 00:51:13,120
Well, it was a private conversation.

548
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,480
Verheiratet... I really don't know.

549
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,920
They can't have gone
beyond the second floor.

550
00:52:31,721 --> 00:52:33,000
What's his name?

551
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:34,800
Schlosser.

552
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:43,840
He's a pilot...
doesn't live in Paris.

553
00:52:44,881 --> 00:52:46,381
Who are you looking for?

554
00:52:48,401 --> 00:52:50,120
Schlosser.

555
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:54,440
Not here.

556
00:52:56,721 --> 00:53:01,200
A tall, thin man; an airline pilot.

557
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:02,520
No pilots here.

558
00:53:02,681 --> 00:53:07,200
He knows a lady who lives here...
blonde hair, cut short.

559
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:09,480
What's her name?

560
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:13,880
I don't know, but they just
went up together.

561
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:17,040
She had a blue mac
and a flowery scarf.

562
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,080
I didn't see them.

563
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:23,800
What do you want with her?
She lost something?

564
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:27,400
Yes, well, no. Not her exactly.

565
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,800
I'm looking for a girl of my age;

566
00:53:31,601 --> 00:53:36,360
we swapped macs by mistake
at the swimming-pool.

567
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:41,000
I don't know her,
but she was seen with this lady.

568
00:53:41,161 --> 00:53:43,000
I can't think of anyone.

569
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:45,141
That's her mac you're wearing?

570
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:46,560
That's right.

571
00:53:46,721 --> 00:53:48,520
I don't recognize it.

572
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:50,161
For sailing, is it?

573
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:52,840
That's right. Do you go sailing?

574
00:53:53,001 --> 00:53:57,920
No. A blonde?
Not a redhead, by any chance?

575
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:02,280
Well, darkish... I think
we must have made a mistake.

576
00:54:08,561 --> 00:54:10,280
Why tell her all that stuff?

577
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:11,920
To gain her confidence.

578
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:18,080
We might have got somewhere,
but it was no use...

579
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:20,400
with you looking so shifty.

580
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,280
He could have come down
any minute.

581
00:54:26,321 --> 00:54:27,440
Well, what now?

582
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:29,201
I'm off.

583
00:54:29,361 --> 00:54:32,840
Don't spoil it now that
it's getting really thrilling.

584
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:34,601
What's thrilling about it?

585
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:36,741
I'm for the bus.

586
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:40,200
I'm thirsty, let's go to that café.

587
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:42,880
We might see them come out.

588
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:48,240
You can do your detecting
and follow them.

589
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:50,440
I have to go at five.

590
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:02,360
We can watch from here.

591
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:07,800
Well, now...

592
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:11,760
What is your theory?

593
00:55:12,361 --> 00:55:14,000
I have no theory.

594
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:16,760
I have.

595
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:20,560
What would Sherlock Holmes
have done?

596
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:23,640
That's fiction;
this is real life.

597
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:25,241
Personally, I like life

598
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:27,201
when it's most like a novel.

599
00:55:36,121 --> 00:55:37,720
What would Sherlock do?

600
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:43,400
Stupid stuff with his lens,
looking for fingerprints.

601
00:55:43,521 --> 00:55:47,200
Not in this case.
He'd have deduced.

602
00:55:47,361 --> 00:55:50,240
So have I,
and I have a theory.

603
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:51,760
What is it?

604
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:53,240
Guess. Deduce.

605
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:54,800
We've no facts.

606
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:57,200
We've plenty.

607
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,000
First fact: they don't live there,

608
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:02,640
either of them.

609
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:08,400
True, and in fact I've an idea
about where they went.

610
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:11,840
The lawyer's office.

611
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:15,240
Clever Mr Detective.

612
00:56:15,441 --> 00:56:16,991
I'm not a complete fool.

613
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:21,571
I'm surprised they didn't have
to check with the concierge.

614
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:23,451
There was a name-plate.

615
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:28,160
I feel they've been there before.

616
00:56:28,521 --> 00:56:32,800
- I don't know, but...
- Yes, they knew the building.

617
00:56:34,681 --> 00:56:36,481
What do you deduce from that?

618
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:40,680
Why a lawyer?

619
00:56:41,161 --> 00:56:44,320
There could be hundreds of reasons.

620
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:46,240
Not that many,

621
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:49,320
and as far as you are concerned...

622
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:52,520
one seems very likely.

623
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:54,960
Certain, in fact.

624
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:57,031
As far as I'm concerned?

625
00:56:57,201 --> 00:56:59,320
Well, your girl, really.

626
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:02,520
What do lawyers handle a lot of?

627
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:05,040
Divorce.

628
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:08,080
They were simply going
to get a divorce.

629
00:57:08,241 --> 00:57:10,791
You mean he's going
to marry the blonde?

630
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:12,920
Good luck to him.

631
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:16,320
You've got it wrong.

632
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:18,120
The blonde is his wife.

633
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,600
Hence the glum looks.

634
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:22,520
Hold on.

635
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:27,120
A man and his wife
couldn't go to the same lawyer.

636
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:30,960
Why not, if it's amicable?

637
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:34,320
My parents did, it's fashionable.

638
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:42,680
What are you thinking?

639
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:48,160
lf he were married,
Anne would have told me.

640
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:49,280
Are you sure?

641
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:53,271
Anyway, he may never have told her.

642
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:55,320
That's possible.

643
00:57:56,161 --> 00:57:59,111
Travelling around
you can get away with anything.

644
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:05,480
Would she lie to you?

645
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:10,320
Anne? Why should she?
She's been very frank about him.

646
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:12,381
Don't make me laugh.

647
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:16,280
Some things
even the sincerest woman won't tell.

648
00:58:17,721 --> 00:58:21,920
She didn't tell you he was back.
You found out, didn't you?

649
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:28,400
I don't know.

650
00:58:28,401 --> 00:58:33,480
What do you mean you don't know?
You know she lied, don't you?

651
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:41,080
How do you like my theory?

652
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,280
You're romancing.

653
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:44,561
Not entirely.

654
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,680
If I were, you wouldn't care,

655
00:58:49,641 --> 00:58:51,880
but you've gone all pensive.

656
00:58:53,121 --> 00:58:54,271
I think it's fun.

657
00:58:54,801 --> 00:58:56,800
Rather stimulating, in fact.

658
00:58:56,961 --> 00:59:01,600
I was a bit down in the dumps.

659
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:04,840
You were? Why?

660
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:09,840
Just because. No particular reason.

661
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:15,760
But also for very specific reasons.

662
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,040
Can't I have problems, too?

663
00:59:20,921 --> 00:59:22,040
Amorous problems?

664
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:26,640
You're very inquisitive, sir.

665
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:30,240
What's your name, by the way?

666
00:59:30,241 --> 00:59:31,760
François. What's yours?

667
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:37,720
Lucie. Let's call a truce.

668
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:04,480
You've been asleep
for ten minutes.

669
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:09,240
You're lucky I've been keeping watch.

670
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,560
I'll drink my coffee,
that'll wake me up.

671
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:20,800
How come you know him,
but he doesn't know you?

672
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:22,800
You still don't believe me.

673
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:26,040
I do. I was just asking.

674
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:31,080
I happened to see him
in the street with Anne.

675
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:35,000
But didn't get a good look?

676
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:40,600
Good enough. He was so engrossed
in her that I'd plenty of time.

677
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:42,920
You like spying.

678
01:00:44,161 --> 01:00:46,480
No, I wondered who he was...

679
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:48,760
her ex,

680
01:00:49,001 --> 01:00:51,000
as she hadn't been seeing him.

681
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,880
So she says.

682
01:00:54,761 --> 01:00:57,360
Are you sure you saw them together
this morning?

683
01:00:57,361 --> 01:00:58,200
Where?

684
01:00:59,681 --> 01:01:02,640
I might as well tell you everything.

685
01:01:02,881 --> 01:01:05,181
I work some nights
at a post office.

686
01:01:05,201 --> 01:01:07,951
- Which post office?
- At the Gare de l'Est.

687
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:10,601
You know it?

688
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:12,920
Sure. In fact...

689
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:17,280
We might have met
on my way to school.

690
01:01:17,561 --> 01:01:19,880
I'm at home asleep by that time.

691
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:23,120
Oh, yes.
What are you saying?

692
01:01:25,441 --> 01:01:30,160
I was saying I was too kind-hearted.
Anne needed a plumber.

693
01:01:30,361 --> 01:01:34,120
I found someone,
brother of a friend

694
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:36,280
who works at the post office.

695
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:41,840
I went to Anne's at seven,
to put a note under her door.

696
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,120
And walked in on them?

697
01:01:44,281 --> 01:01:48,440
No, but I did see them leave
the house at eight.

698
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:51,131
- They didn't see you?
- Of course not.

699
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:54,571
Poor thing, what a shock for you.

700
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:56,240
I wouldn't like that.

701
01:01:57,201 --> 01:01:58,400
What did you do?

702
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:01,800
Nothing. They were some way away.

703
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:07,440
What now?
Not going to kill him, are you?

704
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:09,920
People do...

705
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:13,479
but I bet she's the one
you want to pop off.

706
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:14,480
Neither.

707
01:02:14,641 --> 01:02:16,680
She's the one...

708
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:18,160
how cowardly.

709
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:20,800
I'd be honourable and kill my rival.

710
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:24,001
I don't want to kill anyone.

711
01:02:24,081 --> 01:02:27,760
I'd understand,
but she didn't love him.

712
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:31,720
Some girls are like that:
love one, love'em all.

713
01:02:32,441 --> 01:02:35,280
For me, though,
it's all or nothing.

714
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:36,360
Same here.

715
01:02:36,521 --> 01:02:38,840
Yet you put up
with that guy.

716
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:42,160
I don't.
I thought it was all over,

717
01:02:42,321 --> 01:02:44,640
or I'd never have tried to see her.

718
01:02:46,961 --> 01:02:49,261
Suppose she won't choose
between you?

719
01:02:50,361 --> 01:02:52,920
Well, we'll see what happens.

720
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:12,000
Poor old François

721
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:14,440
is in a stew.

722
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:19,400
His honey's moved to pastures new.

723
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:24,840
Reaching higher with a flyer.

724
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,000
Stop it.

725
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:30,240
Why? I have a gift for poetry.

726
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:37,941
If I were you, I'd pack in that bird.
She doesn't sound much.

727
01:03:39,161 --> 01:03:41,960
You've had it, anyway,
if she's had enough.

728
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,480
Women do the deciding.

729
01:03:49,281 --> 01:03:52,980
I chose her. I had my eye on her
before she saw me.

730
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:58,000
A man gets the girl
he has his eye on

731
01:03:58,161 --> 01:03:59,719
only if she chooses him.

732
01:03:59,721 --> 01:04:03,240
She picked a replacement
because her guy was away.

733
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:07,520
- Am I being rough?
- I chose her!

734
01:04:08,321 --> 01:04:10,080
I don't like being chosen.

735
01:04:10,321 --> 01:04:12,840
Too bad. Girls know what they want.

736
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,520
I don't think Anne does.

737
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:17,840
She does,
though she may not find it.

738
01:04:18,761 --> 01:04:20,680
And she knows it's not you.

739
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:22,491
What do you know about it?

740
01:04:23,441 --> 01:04:26,480
I told you only what I wanted to.

741
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:28,960
We agree on some things,

742
01:04:30,721 --> 01:04:32,240
but it's superficial.

743
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:36,360
I think Anne and I have
a deeper relationship.

744
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:39,800
It's him she loves.

745
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:42,760
She doesn't love him.

746
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:44,480
She doesn't love you.

747
01:04:44,641 --> 01:04:46,680
Stop talking nonsense.

748
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,680
You told me so.

749
01:04:47,681 --> 01:04:49,480
Well, I'm telling you different.

750
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:53,120
Don't get excited.
I was only joking.

751
01:04:54,441 --> 01:04:56,480
She loves you. There!

752
01:04:56,841 --> 01:04:58,640
Sure she loves you.

753
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:03,280
Even well-matched couples don't
seem so to me, so maybe you are.

754
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:07,720
I must go.

755
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:08,880
Where?

756
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:10,800
To the Metro.

757
01:05:12,321 --> 01:05:13,471
I'll go with you.

758
01:05:14,121 --> 01:05:17,800
Don't be silly,
they might come out any minute.

759
01:05:18,321 --> 01:05:19,880
You can follow them.

760
01:05:21,801 --> 01:05:23,320
They spotted me, anyway.

761
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:25,761
And what if they separate?

762
01:05:26,441 --> 01:05:28,760
Then you could use help.

763
01:05:29,401 --> 01:05:32,000
But my grandmother
is expecting me.

764
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:39,720
Still, I'd like to know
if my theory is correct.

765
01:05:40,441 --> 01:05:43,841
Something will happen to prove it
one way or the other.

766
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:47,401
I'll give you my address.

767
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:49,041
You can send me a report.

768
01:05:49,161 --> 01:05:51,960
- Nothing's going to happen.
- Then report that.

769
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:53,320
Have you any paper?

770
01:05:53,761 --> 01:05:55,560
Yes, hold on.

771
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:10,920
No phone number.
Mother would object.

772
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:17,520
Lucie Lavalette.

773
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:23,480
15 Avenue de Verdun.

774
01:06:23,761 --> 01:06:26,711
Avenue de Verdun?
That's close to where I work.

775
01:06:28,081 --> 01:06:30,520
Just put it through the letter-box,

776
01:06:30,961 --> 01:06:32,760
it'll save you a stamp.

777
01:06:35,361 --> 01:06:37,320
Promise not to forget?

778
01:06:39,081 --> 01:06:41,760
You owe me that for my services.

779
01:06:43,161 --> 01:06:45,560
And don't go to sleep again.

780
01:07:22,001 --> 01:07:27,200
Serge, I've had a terrible job
getting hold of you.

781
01:07:27,361 --> 01:07:31,080
I've been trying to get you
all afternoon.

782
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:37,680
About tonight, I'm rather tired.

783
01:07:38,961 --> 01:07:41,400
Not ill, just tired.

784
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:44,451
The girl who filled in
while I was on holiday

785
01:07:44,521 --> 01:07:49,480
messed up the filing.
I've spent the afternoon

786
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:51,200
hunting for things.

787
01:07:51,361 --> 01:07:54,810
I've always said you take
your job too seriously.

788
01:07:55,801 --> 01:07:56,800
One has to.

789
01:07:57,481 --> 01:08:00,880
Going out will cheer you up.

790
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:04,960
Why not come?

791
01:08:05,121 --> 01:08:09,360
All right, maybe
it will relax me a bit.

792
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:16,040
But I'm tired...
I'd like to rest a little first.

793
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:20,240
Could we meet at 8:30?

794
01:08:20,921 --> 01:08:24,840
We won't have time to talk
before the show,

795
01:08:25,081 --> 01:08:27,640
and you'll leave after.

796
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:32,880
Sorry, but I don't feel much
like talking tonight.

797
01:08:33,201 --> 01:08:35,640
All right, I'll see you then.

798
01:08:53,681 --> 01:08:56,681
Do I look as if
I'd been to the hairdresser's?

799
01:08:57,161 --> 01:08:59,200
Not a bit.

800
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:03,881
I can't understand it.

801
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:08,480
Other girls look splendid
after the hairdresser.

802
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:10,120
I look just the same.

803
01:09:10,441 --> 01:09:14,120
Well, you don't look as
if you're going to the hairdresser.

804
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:15,840
That's true.

805
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:18,981
It's not still raining, is it?

806
01:09:19,521 --> 01:09:20,960
See you on Monday.

807
01:09:39,361 --> 01:09:42,280
I hear you're getting married.

808
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,560
To a super airline pilot,

809
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:51,240
so I'm told to approve the pilot,
because then...

810
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,960
I'll be able
to come and see you.

811
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:56,880
Who is it?

812
01:11:57,201 --> 01:11:58,040
Me.

813
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:00,600
This isn't nice of you.

814
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:08,880
I said I wouldn't be in.

815
01:12:09,401 --> 01:12:11,251
- But you are.
- I'm resting.

816
01:12:13,401 --> 01:12:16,720
Come in, since you're here.

817
01:12:24,281 --> 01:12:26,360
I'm not going to kill you,

818
01:12:28,121 --> 01:12:32,960
I just didn't want you
to think that I'm jealous.

819
01:12:33,841 --> 01:12:36,680
I can respect your feelings for him.

820
01:12:36,841 --> 01:12:37,920
Poor François.

821
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:40,571
You see, Christian...

822
01:12:40,641 --> 01:12:43,200
No, it's the way you spoke to me.

823
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:47,760
But that's not what I came to say.

824
01:12:47,961 --> 01:12:51,640
Not on my bed,
say it from over there.

825
01:12:52,761 --> 01:12:53,640
What is it?

826
01:12:53,801 --> 01:12:55,400
Why so angry?

827
01:12:55,641 --> 01:12:59,480
I just can't stand
your lamentations now, that's all.

828
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,240
I'm not lamenting.

829
01:13:03,761 --> 01:13:05,160
OK, I'll go.

830
01:13:05,641 --> 01:13:09,040
Yes, be nice for once.
I need to rest before I go out.

831
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:10,191
You want to sleep?

832
01:13:10,721 --> 01:13:15,160
Just to rest.
Sorry, but we're both on edge.

833
01:13:15,401 --> 01:13:16,800
See you on Monday.

834
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,320
I'll come tomorrow morning.

835
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:22,560
No, you need sleep.

836
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:23,760
How do you know?

837
01:13:23,761 --> 01:13:24,840
It's obvious.

838
01:13:26,921 --> 01:13:28,071
Don't go tomorrow.

839
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:29,920
I have to see mother.

840
01:13:30,081 --> 01:13:31,440
Please, this once.

841
01:13:33,281 --> 01:13:35,360
Would you go if you were married?

842
01:13:36,361 --> 01:13:40,080
- With or without husband?
- I'm not married or planning to be.

843
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:41,360
See you on Monday.

844
01:13:47,441 --> 01:13:50,591
This can't go on.
I'll transfer to the day shift.

845
01:13:52,321 --> 01:13:54,240
Starting next week.

846
01:13:54,481 --> 01:13:55,960
What about your classes?

847
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:58,280
At least I'd see you.

848
01:13:58,761 --> 01:14:03,000
If you're doing this to provoke me,

849
01:14:03,361 --> 01:14:04,760
I'll stop seeing you.

850
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:07,600
I can't go on like this.

851
01:14:08,921 --> 01:14:11,560
- It's no life.
- For you it is.

852
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:16,520
I feel responsible for you.

853
01:14:17,241 --> 01:14:20,341
If you give up your studies
I'll stop seeing you.

854
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,360
- That's blackmail!
- You're the blackmailer.

855
01:14:23,361 --> 01:14:26,211
For your sake
I hope you'll change your mind.

856
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:30,840
For goodness sake go or stay.
I hate you hanging over me.

857
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:46,680
One kiss.

858
01:14:48,361 --> 01:14:50,080
No, if I give an inch...

859
01:14:50,241 --> 01:14:52,600
I'm in horrible mood,
you know.

860
01:14:53,481 --> 01:14:56,600
And I deserve an explanation,
you know.

861
01:14:57,121 --> 01:14:58,120
Of what?

862
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:01,280
I don't owe you any explanations.

863
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:04,200
Even if I were your wife,
I'd refuse.

864
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:09,560
I've a perfect right to see
who I like whenever I like.

865
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:12,240
You come here at ungodly hours.

866
01:15:12,961 --> 01:15:15,280
You pester me on the phone.

867
01:15:15,481 --> 01:15:20,160
You turn up at lunch
and nearly make me late.

868
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:23,280
Now I'm trying to rest
and you walk in.

869
01:15:25,281 --> 01:15:27,760
Think of others sometimes,

870
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:30,560
you're not the only one
with problems.

871
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:34,640
You always want to decide things,
give me a little time.

872
01:15:34,961 --> 01:15:36,661
How can you do this to me?

873
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:39,000
If you'd let me talk...

874
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:42,711
You've done nothing but talk,
but you don't say anything.

875
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:46,800
I'm saying I love you.

876
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:49,040
Your attitude grieves me.

877
01:15:49,201 --> 01:15:53,601
All that's wrong with my attitude
is that I shouldn't have let you in.

878
01:15:54,001 --> 01:15:58,000
Think of me a little,
instead of being sarcastic.

879
01:15:58,161 --> 01:15:59,040
Think of me.

880
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:01,861
Making scenes
won't get you anywhere.

881
01:16:03,361 --> 01:16:07,160
You would turn anyone against you.

882
01:16:08,121 --> 01:16:09,440
You make me laugh.

883
01:16:09,601 --> 01:16:10,501
Listen, Anne...

884
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:12,040
What?

885
01:16:12,441 --> 01:16:13,640
It's quite natural...

886
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:15,720
What? Fussing about nothing.

887
01:16:15,881 --> 01:16:17,200
Nothing? Really?

888
01:16:20,321 --> 01:16:24,760
Maybe not, from the way
you go on about it.

889
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:28,720
- Listen, Anne.
- Is that all you can say?

890
01:16:28,721 --> 01:16:30,471
Just listen, for God's sake.

891
01:16:33,561 --> 01:16:34,761
You really hurt me.

892
01:16:41,641 --> 01:16:43,640
I can do it myself.

893
01:16:44,161 --> 01:16:48,680
Think less about me
and more about your position.

894
01:16:50,121 --> 01:16:51,360
All right.

895
01:16:52,681 --> 01:16:56,640
We can't go on like this.
It's no good for either of us.

896
01:16:58,161 --> 01:17:03,000
Try to live your own life instead
of getting wrong ideas about us.

897
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,920
It's just that I like being with you.

898
01:17:08,521 --> 01:17:12,680
So either I work nights
and you spend yours as you like...

899
01:17:13,241 --> 01:17:18,120
or I can go on days and
we could live like a normal couple.

900
01:17:18,281 --> 01:17:22,360
Perfectly normal,
even down to arguments.

901
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:26,411
- Normal couples live together.
- That's out of the question.

902
01:17:29,281 --> 01:17:32,000
If you want to live with a girl,
find someone else,

903
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:32,880
not me.

904
01:17:34,601 --> 01:17:36,160
I tried it

905
01:17:37,121 --> 01:17:38,280
for three years.

906
01:17:39,881 --> 01:17:41,680
Not again, not just now.

907
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:44,200
- When, then?
- I don't know.

908
01:17:45,201 --> 01:17:46,840
Probably never.

909
01:17:48,441 --> 01:17:49,791
Won't you ever marry?

910
01:17:50,201 --> 01:17:52,040
I'm not planning to.

911
01:17:53,081 --> 01:17:55,781
Even then,
you don't have to live together.

912
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,720
You do.
The law stipulates a marital home.

913
01:17:59,761 --> 01:18:03,261
Well, they won't jail me
for not living with my husband.

914
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:05,840
He could divorce you.

915
01:18:06,001 --> 01:18:07,801
I'll find someone who won't.

916
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:11,641
- He'll have to be rich.
- Why?

917
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:16,880
Two small apartments
cost no more than a big one.

918
01:18:18,081 --> 01:18:20,680
I like this place of mine.

919
01:18:21,561 --> 01:18:24,320
I won't give it up

920
01:18:24,481 --> 01:18:27,560
to share a luxury apartment.

921
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,641
Even if you love the guy?

922
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:32,141
That's immaterial.

923
01:18:33,961 --> 01:18:37,000
For me, love isn't cohabitation.

924
01:18:37,161 --> 01:18:39,360
I hate anything clinging.

925
01:18:39,721 --> 01:18:44,840
It's absurd, because here I am with
the most clinging guy in the world.

926
01:18:45,961 --> 01:18:50,040
Today, maybe, but some days
we hardly see each other.

927
01:18:50,561 --> 01:18:52,160
That's how it should be,

928
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:56,560
absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

929
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:59,320
So why see each other?

930
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:02,920
Understand one thing, François.

931
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:07,401
If you were free every night,
we'd have parted already.

932
01:19:08,801 --> 01:19:12,080
Because I know you:
you'd have wanted to move in.

933
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:15,351
Since it's occasional,
I tolerate you.

934
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:19,400
Rejoice, though.

935
01:19:19,561 --> 01:19:21,680
No one else has been in this bed.

936
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:22,800
No one?

937
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:26,831
I used to go to Christian's hotel.

938
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:32,391
You'll say I'm spying,
but last night...

939
01:19:32,681 --> 01:19:35,200
If you spy, do the job properly.

940
01:19:35,681 --> 01:19:38,800
You didn't see him arrive, did you?

941
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:41,610
He came to see me at 7 a.m.

942
01:19:41,681 --> 01:19:43,640
He must be crazy.

943
01:19:43,961 --> 01:19:45,280
You came then, too.

944
01:19:45,441 --> 01:19:47,440
To leave a note.

945
01:19:47,681 --> 01:19:49,720
Him, too.

946
01:19:50,241 --> 01:19:53,960
But I heard him as he was leaving

947
01:19:54,641 --> 01:19:56,240
and I invited him in.

948
01:19:56,641 --> 01:19:59,240
We had a quick breakfast,

949
01:19:59,401 --> 01:20:00,901
he hates me to be late.

950
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:06,320
If he's coming every day,
he ought to get a car.

951
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:11,131
Are you seeing him tonight?

952
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:14,320
No, he went back to Frankfurt.

953
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:15,400
When?

954
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:17,360
This afternoon.

955
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:23,760
When are you seeing him?

956
01:20:29,961 --> 01:20:31,280
So don't tell me.

957
01:20:33,281 --> 01:20:34,880
Poor François.

958
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:41,000
You can't imagine, wrapped up
in your own little problems...

959
01:20:41,161 --> 01:20:43,440
that I could possibly have any.

960
01:20:44,961 --> 01:20:49,640
You're so sad, so angry, so upset,
yet what's happened to you?

961
01:20:51,161 --> 01:20:52,720
Nothing serious.

962
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:58,480
Your girl has remained true to you,

963
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,480
sleeping soundly in her own bed.

964
01:21:03,721 --> 01:21:05,880
She's the one to despair.

965
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:12,400
Yet instead of comforting her
in her misery, you insult her.

966
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:14,711
And you say you love me.

967
01:21:14,881 --> 01:21:16,720
What did he do to you?

968
01:21:17,721 --> 01:21:19,320
What did he do?

969
01:21:22,681 --> 01:21:24,480
He said a last goodbye.

970
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:26,560
He ditched you?

971
01:21:27,401 --> 01:21:29,240
In favour of his wife.

972
01:21:29,561 --> 01:21:31,640
You didn't say he was married.

973
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:34,800
It didn't matter, or so I thought.

974
01:21:35,161 --> 01:21:37,040
He said they were separated,

975
01:21:37,921 --> 01:21:39,840
but she's expecting a baby.

976
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:41,520
Since when?

977
01:21:41,841 --> 01:21:44,960
What difference does it make?

978
01:21:45,921 --> 01:21:47,421
He won't see you again?

979
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:49,440
Neither should you.

980
01:21:50,681 --> 01:21:53,360
I don't like him doing that to me...

981
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:56,520
after vanishing for three months.

982
01:21:58,321 --> 01:22:01,371
I don't like you making a fuss
into the bargain.

983
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:13,480
Or that cretin Marcillac babbling
to me on the bus home.

984
01:22:16,121 --> 01:22:19,721
And tonight... why didn't
I refuse to go out with Carrére?

985
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:23,920
I'm much too nice.

986
01:22:27,921 --> 01:22:30,960
I spend my life doing things
I don't have to.

987
01:22:46,121 --> 01:22:48,680
It's so pitiful
that it's laughable.

988
01:22:51,001 --> 01:22:52,251
Aren't you laughing?

989
01:23:06,961 --> 01:23:09,600
I'd like to be alone for a bit.

990
01:23:20,241 --> 01:23:23,400
François... don't go.

991
01:23:27,521 --> 01:23:28,400
Stay.

992
01:23:34,521 --> 01:23:38,240
It's all right, Anne, I'm here.

993
01:23:51,201 --> 01:23:52,600
I'm sick of it all.

994
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,360
Lie down.

995
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,720
I must look a fright.

996
01:24:31,561 --> 01:24:32,880
You look lovely.

997
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:52,651
You'll be late for your date.

998
01:24:53,161 --> 01:24:55,240
I don't care.

999
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:59,160
Actually, I set the alarm for 7:30.

1000
01:25:00,321 --> 01:25:02,040
I'll stay with you anyway.

1001
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:04,761
I can say that I'm sick.

1002
01:25:07,921 --> 01:25:09,971
No, I can't get out of my date.

1003
01:25:20,441 --> 01:25:23,360
Carrére isn't much fun,

1004
01:25:23,561 --> 01:25:26,000
but at least he isn't after me.

1005
01:25:28,881 --> 01:25:30,281
Why he takes me out...

1006
01:25:30,361 --> 01:25:32,861
He likes to be seen
with a pretty girl.

1007
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:36,000
But we never see anyone.

1008
01:25:37,961 --> 01:25:40,160
Why do you go?

1009
01:25:43,201 --> 01:25:45,720
Not just because he invites me.

1010
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:51,880
It's nice to go out sometimes
with someone

1011
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:54,080
who isn't really after me.

1012
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:57,880
It seems there aren't
many women after him,

1013
01:25:58,881 --> 01:26:00,960
so it's something.

1014
01:26:02,801 --> 01:26:06,640
You know,
he gets nothing out of me at all.

1015
01:26:07,801 --> 01:26:12,640
To someone not very attractive...
your presence is something...

1016
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:15,201
enough to make me jealous.

1017
01:26:15,841 --> 01:26:17,791
You'd be jealous of my dentist,

1018
01:26:18,001 --> 01:26:20,360
if I'd one.

1019
01:26:20,601 --> 01:26:22,360
A real man-eater, aren't I?

1020
01:26:22,601 --> 01:26:23,720
Not in the least.

1021
01:26:23,881 --> 01:26:25,240
You're so sweet.

1022
01:26:28,361 --> 01:26:30,840
Why did I play you up like that?

1023
01:26:33,081 --> 01:26:35,080
I think it calmed me down.

1024
01:26:40,401 --> 01:26:44,280
And that's the end of Christian.

1025
01:26:46,841 --> 01:26:47,891
Do you love him?

1026
01:26:49,281 --> 01:26:50,040
No.

1027
01:26:52,361 --> 01:26:53,600
Did you love him?

1028
01:26:54,361 --> 01:26:56,840
- Not really.
- You had every right to.

1029
01:26:57,001 --> 01:27:01,920
Everything is my right
and it's not up to you to judge me.

1030
01:27:04,921 --> 01:27:06,440
I was in love with him,

1031
01:27:07,521 --> 01:27:09,160
full of crazy ideas.

1032
01:27:12,321 --> 01:27:14,071
I imagined he'd come back...

1033
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:18,520
and carry me off
like Prince Charming.

1034
01:27:20,121 --> 01:27:22,200
I cherished the idea,

1035
01:27:23,641 --> 01:27:27,000
even if I didn't really believe
or want it.

1036
01:27:29,481 --> 01:27:32,631
I can understand your being sad,
because I am, too.

1037
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,440
Then this morning...

1038
01:27:38,761 --> 01:27:41,200
the fairy-tale of my dreams came true.

1039
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:45,920
The note under my door.
Then him.

1040
01:27:48,761 --> 01:27:51,920
The dream in flesh and blood.

1041
01:27:54,521 --> 01:27:56,800
Simply to say:

1042
01:27:57,881 --> 01:27:59,520
"I love my wife."

1043
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:06,960
What I don't understand is

1044
01:28:08,201 --> 01:28:11,040
why he disappeared...

1045
01:28:11,201 --> 01:28:14,640
why he waited three months
to come and tell you.

1046
01:28:15,121 --> 01:28:16,280
I don't know.

1047
01:28:17,401 --> 01:28:20,440
Reconcilliations take their time,
I suppose.

1048
01:28:21,241 --> 01:28:24,640
He was switched to another route,
too, away from Paris.

1049
01:28:25,641 --> 01:28:28,141
Next month
he'll be with his old flight

1050
01:28:29,961 --> 01:28:32,080
and with his wife.

1051
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:40,120
Two girls in the same city
simply isn't on.

1052
01:28:42,201 --> 01:28:45,320
- She's quite pretty, you know...
- His wife?

1053
01:28:45,481 --> 01:28:46,560
Do I know her?

1054
01:28:47,641 --> 01:28:49,141
No, but I've a picture.

1055
01:28:49,721 --> 01:28:50,800
Show me.

1056
01:28:58,481 --> 01:29:00,981
He wasn't keen on me
having this photo.

1057
01:29:01,361 --> 01:29:03,840
I couldn't understand why.

1058
01:29:04,201 --> 01:29:07,080
This morning he told me
it was her in it,

1059
01:29:07,321 --> 01:29:08,920
there on the right.

1060
01:29:10,681 --> 01:29:12,400
She's very different from you.

1061
01:29:12,401 --> 01:29:13,320
You think so?

1062
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:16,601
Yes, even if you bleached your hair.

1063
01:29:17,081 --> 01:29:21,200
She's on the extreme right,
not on his right.

1064
01:29:22,041 --> 01:29:22,920
In green?

1065
01:29:25,001 --> 01:29:26,451
Who's the blonde, then?

1066
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:27,720
I don't know.

1067
01:29:28,081 --> 01:29:29,400
You're sure that's her?

1068
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:32,160
Yes, why all the questions?

1069
01:29:32,841 --> 01:29:34,320
You'd make a good cop.

1070
01:29:34,761 --> 01:29:37,261
Or maybe not:
you always miss the point.

1071
01:29:38,521 --> 01:29:42,471
He could tell you anything
and you'd have no way of proving it.

1072
01:29:43,601 --> 01:29:46,680
So what, since he's ditching me.

1073
01:29:47,561 --> 01:29:52,480
I'd be more inclined to blame him
for being hurtful.

1074
01:29:54,081 --> 01:29:57,120
He always puts things so bluntly.

1075
01:29:57,761 --> 01:30:01,480
He could have let me down lightly.

1076
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:06,720
But he spun a yarn
about a lawsuit with his sister.

1077
01:30:07,161 --> 01:30:09,000
He's suing his sister?

1078
01:30:09,721 --> 01:30:13,400
No, they're suing somebody. Why?

1079
01:30:13,961 --> 01:30:15,800
No reason.

1080
01:30:23,081 --> 01:30:24,781
What are you thinking about?

1081
01:30:25,961 --> 01:30:27,160
Nothing.

1082
01:30:28,201 --> 01:30:31,040
You're brooding over something.

1083
01:30:31,641 --> 01:30:33,760
- What is it?
- Nothing important.

1084
01:30:34,601 --> 01:30:35,720
What is it?

1085
01:30:38,481 --> 01:30:40,360
Don't you ever think of nothing?

1086
01:30:40,361 --> 01:30:42,280
I'm always thinking something.

1087
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:44,560
That something being nothing.

1088
01:30:47,281 --> 01:30:48,200
What is it?

1089
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:51,320
Stop needling me.

1090
01:30:52,921 --> 01:30:57,840
If you talk about something
you give it importance it doesn't have.

1091
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:02,600
You see, this afternoon...

1092
01:31:07,441 --> 01:31:10,600
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk and...

1093
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:12,640
And what?

1094
01:31:16,521 --> 01:31:19,000
Nothing. I was just thinking...

1095
01:31:20,681 --> 01:31:23,760
About you, him, making up stories.

1096
01:31:24,881 --> 01:31:27,000
Imagining him carrying me off

1097
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:29,920
to the South Seas.

1098
01:31:30,081 --> 01:31:32,360
Something Iike that.

1099
01:31:36,161 --> 01:31:37,280
What eIse?

1100
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:40,400
I forget.

1101
01:31:41,681 --> 01:31:42,800
ReaIIy?

1102
01:31:43,841 --> 01:31:47,240
Thinking the kind of thoughts...

1103
01:31:48,681 --> 01:31:51,400
you have when you're unhappy...

1104
01:31:52,561 --> 01:31:54,520
and jeaIous, too.

1105
01:31:56,001 --> 01:31:59,201
You started to teII me something,
then stopped. What?

1106
01:31:59,281 --> 01:32:00,560
I've told you.

1107
01:32:00,721 --> 01:32:03,760
Come on, tell me what it was.

1108
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:10,240
Do you really want to know?

1109
01:32:14,121 --> 01:32:16,600
I picked up a girl in the park.

1110
01:32:16,761 --> 01:32:18,800
You waste no time, do you?

1111
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:20,960
Incredible!

1112
01:32:22,401 --> 01:32:24,760
They say women act up.

1113
01:32:26,401 --> 01:32:29,320
Yet here you come weeping
in my arms,

1114
01:32:29,481 --> 01:32:31,131
claiming I've deserted you.

1115
01:32:32,001 --> 01:32:35,640
No, it was she who picked me up,

1116
01:32:36,321 --> 01:32:38,071
thinking I was following her.

1117
01:32:38,881 --> 01:32:39,720
Weren't you?

1118
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:41,480
Of course not.

1119
01:32:42,001 --> 01:32:45,560
That's the last thing
I'd been thinking of.

1120
01:32:45,721 --> 01:32:49,320
Why? There's plenty of fish...

1121
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:53,640
No, what I was thinking was
that I wasn't interested...

1122
01:32:54,681 --> 01:32:56,520
in anyone but you.

1123
01:32:56,921 --> 01:32:59,571
Which didn't stop you
from talking to her.

1124
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:03,160
Was she pretty?

1125
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:08,480
Don't tell me you didn't notice.

1126
01:33:08,641 --> 01:33:12,480
It's not the same thing,
she was just a kid of fifteen.

1127
01:33:15,801 --> 01:33:17,301
She was skipping classes.

1128
01:33:17,681 --> 01:33:19,431
She was rather fun, actually.

1129
01:33:19,441 --> 01:33:20,840
Ah, rather fun,

1130
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:23,640
whereas I'm no fun at all.

1131
01:33:24,681 --> 01:33:26,120
I'm too old for you.

1132
01:33:27,841 --> 01:33:29,720
Get yourself another girl.

1133
01:33:30,801 --> 01:33:32,601
Go and find your little bird.

1134
01:33:35,521 --> 01:33:36,920
She doesn't interest me.

1135
01:33:36,921 --> 01:33:38,000
She ought to.

1136
01:33:42,961 --> 01:33:45,040
- Did you make a date?
- No.

1137
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:49,520
Have you her phone number?

1138
01:33:51,281 --> 01:33:52,720
Just her address.

1139
01:33:55,081 --> 01:33:56,481
Will you write to her?

1140
01:33:57,881 --> 01:33:59,200
Are you crazy?

1141
01:34:04,521 --> 01:34:05,521
Are you jealous?

1142
01:34:06,441 --> 01:34:07,760
Me, jealous?

1143
01:34:08,481 --> 01:34:12,431
If that's what you wanted,
you're going the wrong way about it.

1144
01:34:14,721 --> 01:34:17,160
I was just trying to be honest.

1145
01:34:17,481 --> 01:34:20,760
I didn't have to tell you about her.
She means nothing to me.

1146
01:34:20,761 --> 01:34:25,880
I was upset
and it was someone to talk to.

1147
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:28,461
What did you talk about?

1148
01:34:31,841 --> 01:34:35,000
Nothing much, this and that.

1149
01:34:43,161 --> 01:34:44,360
The weather?

1150
01:34:45,281 --> 01:34:46,280
No fear!

1151
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:48,920
Love?

1152
01:34:49,561 --> 01:34:52,920
No, well, just in general.

1153
01:34:56,481 --> 01:34:58,760
May I hear what she thought?

1154
01:34:58,921 --> 01:35:02,200
Just kid stuff, really.

1155
01:35:02,881 --> 01:35:05,880
Oh yes? Such as?

1156
01:35:06,561 --> 01:35:08,680
I don't know...well...

1157
01:35:09,601 --> 01:35:11,251
that girls do the deciding.

1158
01:35:13,361 --> 01:35:14,611
Do you believe that?

1159
01:35:16,201 --> 01:35:18,120
I don't believe it, either.

1160
01:35:19,401 --> 01:35:20,440
I'd like to.

1161
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:25,520
You decide too much.

1162
01:35:25,881 --> 01:35:28,960
Me? No, I don't.

1163
01:35:29,241 --> 01:35:32,040
I can't even decide to put you out.

1164
01:35:35,561 --> 01:35:38,840
Well, I'm off.

1165
01:35:42,241 --> 01:35:43,320
Have you eaten?

1166
01:35:43,521 --> 01:35:45,071
No, I'll get a sandwich.

1167
01:35:46,561 --> 01:35:48,160
Take some grapes.

1168
01:36:12,761 --> 01:36:14,280
Well, I'm ready.

1169
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:16,400
Like that?

1170
01:36:16,801 --> 01:36:17,880
Why not?

1171
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:24,400
I do hate leaving you,

1172
01:36:25,201 --> 01:36:27,851
knowing you're going out
with someone else.

1173
01:36:27,961 --> 01:36:29,280
He's harmless.

1174
01:36:29,681 --> 01:36:32,120
Yes, but he'll be with you,
I won't.

1175
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:41,511
See you on Monday.

1176
01:36:41,881 --> 01:36:43,680
Right, six o'clock.

1177
01:36:47,481 --> 01:36:51,031
And François, don't forget
to write to your little friend.

1178
01:36:52,121 --> 01:36:55,160
A long letter, she'll love that.

1179
01:37:08,601 --> 01:37:10,679
They did go to the lawyer's,

1180
01:37:10,681 --> 01:37:13,760
but the woman was his sister.
We never thought of that.

1181
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:15,760
See you sometime. François.

1182
01:38:28,761 --> 01:38:31,560
<i>Paris has charmed me</i>

1183
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:35,960
<i>Paris has conquered me</i>

1184
01:38:37,001 --> 01:38:41,480
<i>Paris took me in her arms sensuously</i>

1185
01:38:42,841 --> 01:38:48,680
<i>She swallowed me up
in her feverish hustle and bustle</i>

1186
01:38:49,641 --> 01:38:53,760
<i>In her restless frenzy</i>

1187
01:38:55,721 --> 01:39:00,520
<i>And I felt caught up, wrapped up</i>

1188
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:03,760
<i>Sucked up and stifled</i>

1189
01:39:05,121 --> 01:39:08,920
<i>A small spot lost in the immensity</i>

1190
01:39:10,601 --> 01:39:13,880
<i>I count about as much as a cobblestone</i>

1191
01:39:14,681 --> 01:39:18,520
<i>A plane tree leaf
flying on the avenue</i>

1192
01:39:19,481 --> 01:39:24,000
<i>That will tumble down the stairs
of the metro</i>

1193
01:39:25,441 --> 01:39:30,320
<i>Instead of soaring up to the sun</i>

1194
01:39:31,081 --> 01:39:32,840
<i>Way up there</i>

1195
01:39:39,001 --> 01:39:41,800
<i>Paris has charmed me</i>

1196
01:39:42,361 --> 01:39:45,920
<i>Paris disarmed me</i>

1197
01:39:46,561 --> 01:39:49,840
<i>Turning all my hopes to alarms</i>

1198
01:39:52,441 --> 01:39:57,120
<i>I live alone under my garret roof</i>

1199
01:39:58,001 --> 01:40:03,200
<i>From friends and strangers</i>
<i>I remain aloof</i>

1200
01:40:03,961 --> 01:40:08,160
<i>Yet still</i>

1201
01:40:09,081 --> 01:40:13,840
<i>I feel proud of my solitude</i>

1202
01:40:14,921 --> 01:40:22,600
<i>As on the hardships of life I brood</i>

1203
01:40:23,561 --> 01:40:29,200
<i>Life in the city so vast and wide</i>

1204
01:40:29,761 --> 01:40:34,240
<i>Constantly buffeted by wind and tide</i>

1205
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:39,120
<i>It's a struggle for survival</i>
<i>renewed each day</i>

1206
01:40:40,241 --> 01:40:48,200
<i>With cruel destiny</i>
<i>refusing to point the way</i>

1207
01:40:50,321 --> 01:40:54,400
<i>Now the dark and malevolent night</i>

1208
01:40:54,681 --> 01:40:58,840
<i>Drives all ease</i>
<i>from anguished sight</i>

1209
01:40:59,361 --> 01:41:04,240
<i>And muffled roars</i>
<i>still prowl the street</i>

1210
01:41:05,841 --> 01:41:12,800
<i>For the heart of Paris never ceases</i>

1211
01:41:15,161 --> 01:41:18,200
<i>to beat</i>
