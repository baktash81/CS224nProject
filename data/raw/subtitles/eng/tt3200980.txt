So I was thinking maybe you'd
come down to the dealership,

20
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,809
sign a few balls
or something this Saturday.

21
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,310
Nobody wants
my autograph, Milt.

22
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,279
You never know, man.
Come on, seriously.

23
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,648
Last time worked out. Could
be a win-win for both of us.

24
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,585
Oh, there she is.

25
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,320
Shots.

26
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,556
I got this. Don't reach
for your wallet.

27
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,525
All right, man.

28
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,660
- No, don't reach for your wallet.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,896
Here you go, sunshine.

30
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:46,398
Next round's on me, I guess.

00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,702
<i>Thank you!</i>

32
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,772
- Oh!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

33
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,574
I think there's
somebody here tonight

34
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,276
who deserves just a little bit
of recognition, all right?

35
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,478
- Uh-oh, here it is.
- Oh, no.

36
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,781
Now, it's not because he's a
regular here at Stevie Ray's...

37
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,184
Hmm? Is he talking about me?

38
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,920
<i>Or because he was an All-American
at Stevenson High School...</i>

39
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,756
True story, true story.

40
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,891
Or even because
he was a Detroit Tiger.

41
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,227
That's right! Oh, yeah!

42
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,330
Simply because
it's his birthday.

43
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,666
Give it up for Calvin Campbell.

Hey, Katie bear. Hi.

50
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,305
<i>You said you'd be home</i>
<i>by 9:30, Dad.</i>

51
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,940
I know. I'm sorry.

52
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,442
Dang it, I'm sorry.

53
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,377
Milt and Frankie,

54
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,446
they wanted to celebrate
my birthday,

55
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:11,583
so they took me out
for some, uh, dinner

56
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,851
and we just got a little, uh...

57
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,721
- <i> You're drunk.</i>
- No.

58
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,756
Yeah.

59
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,992
Yeah, not too much that
I can't drive, though,

60
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:21,860
if that's what you're
thinking, 'cause I'm good.

61
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,897
Um, sweetheart, we're gonna
celebrate when I get home, okay?

62
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,700
Hello?

63
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,876
Oh, God.

64
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,416
This guy's drunk. Look at this.

65
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,984
He's a mess!

66
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,859
Uh, where do you think
you're going, hmm?

67
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,028
- It's 11:15.
- Out with Colt.

68
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,698
No, no. I told you that I didn't
want you to see that boy anymore.

69
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,367
Yeah? Well, at least
somebody loves me.

70
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,836
You are 16 years old.

71
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,405
I'm 17, Dad.

72
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,575
What happened to us
spending my birthday together?

73
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,978
What happened?

74
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,446
I don't know.

75
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,748
What time did you get home?

76
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,583
Late.

77
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,651
- You making some for me?
- Yes.

78
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,488
I know late. What time?

79
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,655
I don't know.

80
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,823
Colt won his sprint car heat.

81
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,393
We went out to celebrate.

82
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,162
At least I got to celebrate
something with somebody.

83
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,466
I like my eggs over easy.

84
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,841
Yeah, I want to say
something about Colt.

85
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,476
He's like a...

86
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,080
he's like a fastball
from Nolan Ryan

87
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,649
when he was in the
prime of his game.

88
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,552
- What does that even mean?
- It means he's too much for you to handle.

89
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,156
Dad, can't we just have a normal
conversation with breakfast?

90
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,894
<i>Yeah, that's fine.</i>

91
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,069
What are you gonna do today?

92
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,105
- Mall and movie.
- Hmm.

93
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,741
- I need the car.
- I'm using the car.

94
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,746
Don't you think it's about time
you got a real job again, Dad?

95
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,849
So we can afford things?
Like, say, two cars?

96
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,984
You know what?

97
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,954
I'm the dad and you're the kid.

98
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,089
So you don't talk to me
about getting a job

99
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,524
or getting a second car.

100
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,493
Do you understand me?

101
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,763
The other thing about Colt, young
lady, is that he is too old for you.

102
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,885
And I know what old kids want.

103
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,968
- I know what they're after.
- Okay.

104
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,947
Are you guys having...
are you having sex?

105
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,209
Really?

106
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,845
Really, Dad? Really?

107
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:05,484
You are such
a freaking hypocrite.

108
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,752
I can have all the sex I want.

109
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,021
You were obviously
doing it in high school.

110
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,091
Yeah.

111
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,993
Yeah, exactly,
and I don't want you to make

112
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,515
the same mistakes
that I was making.

113
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,632
So, I'm a mistake?

114
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:21,800
That's not what I said, Katie.

115
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,869
- Wow, Dad.
- Katie...

116
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,837
- that's not what I said.
- Well, you did.

117
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,080
You know what?
Maybe you don't like Colt

118
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,282
because you're just jealous
he's an athlete on the way up

119
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,852
and you're... you.

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,348
sorry, pal, I think I just trampled
on one of your vegetables.

130
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,083
A tomato is a fruit.

131
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,851
What'd you say?

132
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,889
A tomato is a fruit.

133
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:55,126
So are avocados,
cucumbers, and olives.

134
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,128
- <i> All fruits.</i>
- Huh.

135
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,997
Well...

136
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,132
that's pretty good information.

137
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,834
- Thanks.
- You're pretty smart.

138
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,338
- You think I'm smart?
- Uh... sure.

139
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,909
Do you want to see
how smart that I am?

140
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,679
You know what?
Maybe another day.

141
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,148
I'm just... I'm not really in
the mood for it today, man.

142
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,150
- Sorry about that.
- Okay.

143
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,252
Have a magnificent day.

144
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,693
All right.

145
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,895
Hey, Miss Amy, how you doing?

146
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,198
Hey, Produce. I'm great.
How are you doing?

147
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,367
<i>- Incredible.</i>
<i>- Nice to see you.</i>

148
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,768
<i>Nice to see you.</i>

149
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,403
<i>Look what I'm getting.</i>

150
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,772
Mr. Campbell, you over there
messing with Produce?

151
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,674
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sorry.

152
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,976
Just having a conversation
with him, Colt.

153
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,378
I'm sure it was compelling.

154
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,916
You know? All right, see ya.

155
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,686
But also putting strawberries
on the top of waffles.

156
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,022
<i>- Look at you.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

157
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,791
- What else is fresh today?
- Tomatoes are fresh.

158
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,393
They look good.

159
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,862
Hey, Produce, uh, thank
you for that information

160
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,264
over there about the fruits
and vegetables and...

161
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,700
You're welcome. My mama said

162
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,102
- <i> those are not good for you.</i>
- This?

163
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,139
Well, your mama
sounds like a smart person, too.

164
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,141
- Thanks.
- <i> Yeah.</i>

165
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,742
Could be good advice.

166
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,184
Could be good advice
if I followed it.

167
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,983
Hey, he's a s... uh, you know?

168
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,018
- The hugging.
- He's a hugger.

169
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,687
What's that about?

170
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,089
It's just his way
of being friendly.

171
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,991
Yeah.

172
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:35,994
I'm Calvin.

173
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,698
Amy.

174
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,770
It's nice to meet you, Amy.

175
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,406
Nice to meet you.

176
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,843
Would you like to have somebody
to help you shop more?

177
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,478
Please help me shop.

178
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,017
♪ And I found the beauty
that I couldn't see ♪

179

183
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,337
Yeah!

184
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,308
Thanks, man.

185
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,143
That was beautiful.

186
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,945
<i>Thank you.</i>

187
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,514
<i>It still needs a lot of
work, but I appreciate it.</i>

188
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,753
Look... there's no one
here, Frank.

189
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,675
I could really use an extra
hand cleaning up in the back.

190
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,493
Laura, I'm not the janitor.

191
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,361
I know, but...

192
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,806
Hey, buddy,
it was a beautiful song.

193
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,810
It got me.

194
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,172
<i>They're lucky to have</i>
<i>you here, Frankie.</i>

195
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,316
What's this?
She forget her broomstick?

196
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,087
She left that for me.

197
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,359
Got work to do.
I'll see you later, man.

198
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,079
You didn't leave me any coffee.

199
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,048
You know how to work
the coffeemaker, Katie.

200
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,050
No, you drank it all, Dad.

201
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,019
There's none in the bag.
That's what I'm saying.

202
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,321
Well, I will...
I will run to the store

203
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,444
and get some more when I'm
finished with my paper.

204
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,829
Hey, Dad?

205
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,498
<i>How about we go see a
movie or something later?</i>

206
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,203
I'd love to, Katie,

207
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:01,606
but I think I have to meet
Milt and Frank later.

208
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,875
Sorry, kiddo.

209
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:20,491
<i>Hi, Mr. Campbell.
How you doing this afternoon?</i>

210
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,927
I'm fine. How are you?

211
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,562
I'm doing good.

212
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,865
Even when I'm doing bad,
I'm doing good.

213
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:30,301
Sounds pretty deep.

214
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,537
<i>Have a magnificent day.</i>

215
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,544
You know what?

216
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,082
Um...

217
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,385
I wasn't being honest
with you, Produce.

218
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,153
I'm not fine.

219
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,522
Well, are you sick?

220
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:55,894
- I don't think so.
- Maybe you just need to smile.

221
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,296
"A cheerful heart
is good medicine."

222
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,108
Where'd you get that?
A bumper sticker?

223
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,169
<i>You told me that I was smart.</i>

224
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,238
- Remember?
- Yeah.

225
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
You wanna see how smart I am?

226
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,242
Uh...

227
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,577
Well, I'll tell you what.

228
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,445
Maybe not today,
because I gotta...

229
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,180
I gotta...

230
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,216
- Pick up that melon.
- All right.

231
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:21,286
They label all of these
fruits and vegetables

232
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:24,022
with some numbers on them.

233
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,325
But I know the number on
the top of that melon.

234
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:30,194
- Okay, go.
- 4329.

235
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,597
Yeah, 4329.

236
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,465
That's correct.

237
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,135
That's impressive, Produce.
Good job.

238
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,104
Pear. Anjou.

239
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,373
4422.

240
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,943
Yep. Correct.

241
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,445
Banana. That's the easy one.

242
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,681
Everybody likes bananas.

243
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,115
4011.

244
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,187
<i>Gala apple. 4135.</i>

245
00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:00,058
Orange. 9669.

246
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,527
Tangerine. 3144.

247
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,595
Granny Smith apple. 4017.

248
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,698
Yeah. There we go.

249
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,333
I'm really impressed.

250
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,968
I mean, you're kinda like
"Rain Man" or something.

251
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,369
Like Superman or Batman!

252
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,971
Oh!

253
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,373
Ow.

254
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,656
You're proud of me
'cause I'm smart.

255
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,212
- I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell.
- No, that's all right.

256
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,974
He didn't realize
he was bugging you.

257
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,484
What did I tell you
about hugging the customers?

258
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,654
Now you get back
to work, young man.

259
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,356
You have a nice day,
Mr. Campbell.

260
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,690
- You, too, Dexter.
- I'm sorry about the hug.

261
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,459
Nah, like I said.

262
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,629
Hey, Produce.

263
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,264
I'm impressed.

264
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,074
- Frank?
- <i> Hi, Susan.</i>

265
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,609
Is Milt here?

266
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,544
Is everything okay?

267
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,279
Yeah, yeah, it's good.

268
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,547
I just need to talk to him.

269
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,249
Yeah, come in.

270
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,754
- You doing all right?
- Yeah, nice to see you.

271
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,489
- You, too.
- Milt.

272
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,359
- Hey, buddy, what's up?
- <i> What's up, man?</i>

273
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,727
- What's up?
- You doing all right?

274
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,769
Yeah. What's going on?

275
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,132
Okay, um...

276
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,267
there's no easy way
to ask you this, so...

277
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:16,903
Okay.

278
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:19,437
I need to borrow some
money for a hotel room.

279
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,406
It's not long.
I'll pay you back.

280
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,275
- What happened?
- I got evicted.

281
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,310
Hadn't paid in a while,
so kinda had it comin'.

282
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,312
Well, you're not getting
in any hotel, all right?

283
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,081
You stay here, all right?
We got plenty of room.

284
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,549
- You're like family.
- Man, I...

285
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,951
No, no, no, no. Stay here.
We got plenty of room.

286
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,228
So I got some
towels if you want to take a shower

287
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,391
and help yourself
to anything in the kitchen.

288
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,834
Thank you.

289
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,536
You're welcome.

290
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,286
No. Colt, hang on.

291
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:12,156
What? What's going on?

292
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,791
Just slow down.

293
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,747
The hell are you doing?

294
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,617
I'm cold.

295
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,220
Come on, take that jacket
off, get back in bed.

296
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,593
You know how many girls
wanna get with me right now?

297
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:52,236
But here I am. I'm trying
to be faithful to you.

298
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,700
I just want it to be special

299
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:56,901
for my first time.

300
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,507
Wait, you... so you're...
you're a virgin?

301
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,142
- Yeah.
- But you said that you've been...

302
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,878
I know. I... I lied.

303
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,482
I just wanted you
to like me, so I said it.

304
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,671
This is awesome, you know that?

305
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,662
Listen, I got some wine
out in my Jeep, okay?

306
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,398
It's in a box, so we don't
need an opener or anything.

307
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,500
- That's special, right?
- You don't get it.

308
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,502
No, you don't get it, Katie.

309
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,841
You can't just tease
a guy like this.

310
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,876
I said just lay back down.

311
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,369
<i>- Katie?</i>

312
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,356
<i>Hey, Katie?</i>

313
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,529
Hey, Katie bear, I just...

314
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,565
I just wanted
to come say good night.

315
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,435
Wha... hey.

316
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:08,038
What are you doing with your
jacket on in your bed, huh?

317
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,644
Hey, what's wrong?

318
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,720
Is there something
I can do to help?

319
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,988
Please get out.

320
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,894
Okay.

321
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,917
Hey, Mr. Campbell.
How you doing?

322
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,019
Where's the shopping cart?

323
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,488
I don't know.

324
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,627
I'm not here to shop.

325
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,495
I guess I just, uh...

326
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,465
I guess I just came to talk.

327
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,600
To me?

328
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,502
Yeah, to you.

329
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,305
I guess I could use
some of that magical happiness

330
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,108
that you always seem to have.

331
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,680
- So, what's your secret?
- It's no secret, Mr. Campbell.

332
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,582
Well, you're doing
something right.

333
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:27,464
You're doing a heck of a
lot better than I'm doing.

334
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,991
Do you think that I'm smart
enough to do anything?

335
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,061
Anything in the whole
wide world?

336
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,499
- Well, come on.
- Uh, where are we going?

337
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,701
All right.

338
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,036
Where...

339
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:46,771
where are we going, buddy?

340
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,973
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look it.

341
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,642
I'm not authorized personnel.
I can't go back there.

342
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,944
Please, Mr. Campbell?
Come... please?

343
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,579
- Come on.
- All right.

344
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,415
- Come on.
- What are we doing?

345
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,553
What? What is this?

346
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:06,324
I'm not smart enough to be
the Employee of the Month.

347
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,726
Oh, shoot.

348
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,961
Yeah, you are.

349
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,464
- Really?
- Let me ask you a question.

350
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,068
Do you think that Colt

351
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,971
can name every fruit number

352
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:24,709
on every piece of fruit
in the store?

353
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,577
But I can name
all the vegetables, too.

354
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,479
Yeah, exactly.

355
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:31,001
That's my point.
He can't do that.

356
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,891
Hey, Produce.

357
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,129
Sometimes...

358
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,967
well, sometimes life

359
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,569
is not fair.

360
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,003
You know?

361
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,365
And sometimes we don't
get what we want.

362
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,811
What do you do for work?

363
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,683
Well, uh...

364
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,518
I've done... I don't know,

365
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,687
I've done a few things

366
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,389
here and there.

367
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,760
I used to play baseball.

368
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,395
Wow!

369
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,130
Will you show me how?

370
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,865
Well, you know,
I haven't... whoa,

371
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,134
I haven't played baseball
in a long, long time, Produce.

372
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,503
I've always wanted
to play baseball.

373
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:26,804
<i>You really want to learn</i>
<i>how to play?</i>

374
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,139
Yeah!

375
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,510
Okay.

376
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:33,778
This is what I want you to do.

377
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,045
I want you to stand
over this box.

378
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,047
That's the home plate.

379
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,917
And then you're just going
to swing this broomstick

380
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,919
like it's a baseball bat.

381
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,688
Hey, Produce?

382
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,592
Not<i> on</i> the box. Over the box.

383
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,128
There you go. Just
stand like that, okay?

384
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,763
<i>All right, Produce,</i>

385
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,066
I just want you to keep
your eye on the ball.

386
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,470
<i>- It's an orange.</i>
- That's very perceptive.

387
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,539
Just swing when it comes
near you, all right?

388
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,840
<i>All righty then.</i>

389
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,584
I'm going to hit a home run!

390
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,753
Well, not if I strike
you out first, kid.

391
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,555
<i>You ready?</i>

392
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,524
Here comes the heater.

393
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,208
<i>Oh!</i>

394
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,765
- <i> It's all right.</i>
- Strike one.

395
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:28,999
<i>It's all right.</i>

396
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,835
Here's what I want you to do.

397
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:33,637
I want you to keep
your shoulders in, okay?

398
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,841
Keep your eye on the orange.

399
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,176
And I always want you to look
for the rotation of the pitch

400
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,678
at its highest point, okay?

401
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,713
That's when it's leaving my...

402
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,483
never mind, just...

403
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,985
- just swing away and have fun.
- Okay.

404
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,991
Oh, yeah, Produce!

405
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,727
<i>Highest point, all right?</i>

406
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,829
Oh! Close.

407
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,233
All right.

408
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,971
There we go.

409
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,006
<i>There it is!</i>

410
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,708
<i>There it is.</i>

411
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,811
Here comes a tomato.
Keep your eye on the ball.

412
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,013
- Ooh.
- All right, here we go.

413
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,819
Boom! There it is!

414
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,555
<i>Nice!</i>

415
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,595
Oh! All right, there we go.

416
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:40,204
- Oh, no!
- Grapefruit.

417
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:42,740
Yeah!

418
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,318
Produce! Where the
heck have you been?

419
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,554
Get a new apron
and get back to work!

420
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,875
Hey, Produce,
how's it going, man?

421
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,610
- Incredible, man.
- That's great. That's great.

422
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:22,947
Listen, if you tell anyone
what you just saw,

423
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:24,348
there's gonna be
some problems for you.

424
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,251
But you took the bottle.

425
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,787
- It's not yours.
- I know.

426
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,822
The thing is, I'd pay
for it if I was 21,

427
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,058
but I'm not, so I can't.

428
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,893
- Understand?
- Understand.

429
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,095
- All right.
<i>- Hey, speed demon.</i>

430
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,297
- Mr. Jenkins, how are you, sir?
- Great, great.

431
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,232
Hey, I caught your race
last Saturday night.

432
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,635
- Oh, thank you.
- So when are they gonna go ahead

433
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,770
and just let you race
in the 500?

434
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,007
Oh, thank you, sir.
You're too kind.

435
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,176
Well, keep up
the good work, son.

436
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,911
You're making us all
proud around here.

437
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:55,746
Thank you, thank you.

438
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,953
Hey, not a word,
you understand me?

439
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,888
- Yeah.
- All right, great.

440
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:16,100
- Hey, Produce.
- Hey, what are you doing out here?

441
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:18,402
I was wondering if you wanted
to go somewhere with me.

442
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:20,304
Where do we want to go?

443
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,139
Come on. It'll be a surprise.

444
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,210
<i>♪ Don't need to worry</i>
<i>'bout me ♪</i>

445
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:29,246
<i>♪ I've got everything I need ♪</i>

446
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:33,183

450

- Dang it!
<i>- It's all right.</i>

451
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,097
<i>You just need to concentrate.</i>

452
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,433
You need to keep
your eye on the ball.

453
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,969
And I want you to put
your elbows in.

454
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,872
Okay, transfer
your weight back.

455
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:57,408
The swing is all in your wrist.

456
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,309
<i>Let's see.</i>

457
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,945
I'm never gonna hit a baseball!

458
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:04,815
You're gonna hit a
baseball and be positive!

459
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:07,918
If you keep telling yourself that you're
never gonna hit a baseball, guess what.

460
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,254
- <i> I won't hit it.</i>
- That's right, exactly.

461
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:13,390
Baseball is 75% mental.

462
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,859
Trust me.

463
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,861
I remember you hitting
that two-run double

464
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,165
off of Clemens
back in the 2000 ALCS?

465
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,300
Do I know you?

466
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,035
Steve.

467
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,337
Bookerson.

468
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,773
I was out of the league by 2000.

469
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,375
Oh.

470
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,277
Right, it was, uh...

471
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,745
'99.

472
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,881
Hey, Produce,
try to swing level.

473
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:40,851
Do you ever think about
getting back into the game?

474
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,220
Nope.

475
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,757
Well, that's a shame because I'm the
assistant GM of the Louisville Bats.

476
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,393
We're looking to fill our manager's
position and I'd like it to be a local boy.

477
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,161
You know what? I got a kid
at home that I can't handle.

478
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,297
I don't think I want to be
in charge of 30 more.

479
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,266
Look, you were one of the smartest
players I had ever seen back in...

480
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,302
Hey, don't you get it, Steve?

481
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,038
I wasn't as good as you or
everyone like you thought I was.

482
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,907
I couldn't hack it when it counted
and I don't want to relive that.

483
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,944
Okay? So thank you,
but no, thank you.

484
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:10,147
I just wanted to offer you the
opportunity if you wanted it.

485
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:12,049
It's a good-paying gig.

486
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,151
But if you got
other stuff going on...

487
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,762
Not really.

488
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:33,804
Look, why don't you stop by the
stadium Sunday evening 6:00 PM.

489
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,873
Sunday at 6:00?

490
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,809
The GM, he'd be excited to meet
you and if you don't like it...

491
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,544
- Okay.
- ...you can always walk away.

492
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,312
Yeah, I'll... I'll be there.

493
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,781
Great.

494
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,549
I'll count on it.

495
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:49,419
Hey, you ready?

496
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,356
Hmm.

497
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,093
I had a good day today.

498
00:29:56,095 --> 00:30:00,497
I took this...
this kid who, uh...

499
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:03,834
I don't know, he's... he's,
like, slow or whatever.

500
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:06,036
- You know?
- Slow or whatever? Like slow like what?

501
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,927
Like can't win a race?
Or slow like retarded?

502
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:11,115
Yeah, no, he's got
Down Syndrome.

503
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:14,378
I don't know.
It was a good day.

504
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,080
He's a happy kid.
He's a good, happy kid.

505
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,349
- Yeah, great.
- That's good, man.

506
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,185
You know what would
make me happy?

507
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,486
If you buy...

508
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,054
How about you buy
a round of beer?

509
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,736
That'd make me happy.
How about that?

510
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,536
<i>Colt. Colt!</i>

511
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,243
- What are you doing?
- Stay out of this, Katie.

512
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,912
- You need my help, bro?
- No, man, I think I got it.

513
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,854
Hey!

514
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,522
Hey, where do you think
you're going, huh?

515
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,557
<i>What are you doing, Colt?</i>

516
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,393
Stay out of this, Katie. It's
got nothing to do with you.

517
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:06,196
Listen, man, I told you
to keep your mouth shut.

518
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,065
I got fired today
'cause of you.

519
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,034
- You did something bad.
- What?

520
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,070
What exactly did I do to you?

521
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,571
Huh? Nothing!

522
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,640
I did absolutely
nothing to you.

523
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:20,010
I came to give
Mr. Campbell a melon.

524
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,014
This melon?

525
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:25,949
You came to give
Mr. Campbell this melon?

526
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:28,485
<i>Yes. Don't break
Mr. Campbell's melon!</i>

527
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,654
<i>Colt! Leave him alone, Colt!</i>

528
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,422
Can't you see he's different?!

529
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,365
All right, man, you know what?

530
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,100
Take your melon.

531
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:47,445
Come on, guys,
let's get out of here.

532
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,609
Produce.

533
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,833
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

534
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,150
Where's Katie?

535
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,484
She left.

536
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,522
I brought you a melon.

537
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,159
I see that.

538
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,661
Um... that was nice of you.

539
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,543
Does your mama know
where you are?

540
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,099
You don't like my melon?

541
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,301
Aw...

542
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,004
That's not it at all, Produce.

543
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,974
- Thank you for the melon.
- You're welcome.

544
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:01,545
So... why are you all dirty?

545
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,113
Did you fall off your bike?

546
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:05,148
- Yes.
- Are you hurt?

547
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,384
- No.
- You okay?

548
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,186
- Yeah.
- Okay.

549
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,624
Well...

550
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,062
um...

551
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,265
do you want a ride home?

552
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:27,070
- You smell funny.
- Yeah, it's, uh...

553
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,374
that's what the French
call<i> eau de Bourbon.</i>

554
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,446
Not funny?

555
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:41,651
Okay.

556
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,489
Well, I'm gonna
go, uh, to sleep

557
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,157
'cause it's real, real late

558
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,062
and, um, I'll see ya
tomorrow or whenever.

559
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,337
- Good-bye.
- Hey, Produce?

560
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:04,541
Hey.

561
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,676
Thank you for my melon.

562
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,445
You're welcome.

563
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,629
And away he goes.

564
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:28,131
Oh, he... Produ...

565
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,634
Produce, you forgot your...

566
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,202
hey...

567
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,413
Hey, Katie bear?

568
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,248
Which, uh... which tie do
you think I should wear?

569
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,583
This one or this one?

570
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,151
- Neither.
- No?

571
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,853
No, you're not much
of a tie guy.

572
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,322
Yeah, I guess you're right.

573
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,824
Why are you so dressed up?

574
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:57,094
Ah, I got that meeting tonight.

575
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:59,596
The owners of
the Bats, you remember?

576
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,398
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

577
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,468
- That's awesome, Dad.
- Thanks.

578
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,137
So just call me after and we
can grab dinner to celebrate.

579
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,806
Yeah, okay.

580
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,842
- I'd like that.
- <i> Me, too.</i>

581
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:13,777
- Well, all right, then, it's a date.
- <i> Okay.</i>

582
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,113
All right.

583
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,449
<i>Mr. Campbell!</i>

584
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,789
You should tell your
mentally challenged friend

585
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,757
not to come
around here anymore.

586
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,893
Produce? Why?

587
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,829
Colt says he's a troublemaker.

588
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,598
He's not a troublemaker.

589
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,666
Colt on the other hand...

590
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:39,302
Can you open the door for him, please?

591
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,771
Dad, Colt is gonna
be here any minute.

592
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,373
Yeah, I don't care about Colt.

593
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,442
Okay, well, just make it quick.

594
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:49,379
- Hi.
- Hey.

595
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,214
- Is that for me?
- Yes, it is.

596
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,150
Oh.

597
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,417
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

598
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,220
I got them from
the flowers department

599
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,556
and they've got
plants there, too.

600
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,558
Oh, I'm gonna go
put them in water.

601
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

602
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,929
Yeah, he's a real troublemaker.

603
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,765
- Hey, big guy.
- Hey, Mr. Campbell.

604
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,800
- How you doing?
- Incredible.

605
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,537
- That's good.
- I left my book here last night.

606
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:15,338
- <i> And I really need it.</i>
- Yes, you did.

607
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,408
It's exactly where you left it.

608
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,876
- Here you go, big guy.
- Thank you.

609
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,945
Hey, you look sharp.
Where you going?

610
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,713
Thanks. I'm going to church.

611
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,583
It practically starts
in 17 minutes.

612
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:29,786
- Practically, huh?
- <i> Look at my watch.</i>

613
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,388
My mama told me

614
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,624
it has all the whistles
and all the bells.

615
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:38,962
Yeah, well, I think your mama's right.
It looks like it does.

616
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:41,605
- It's a beautiful timepiece, Produce.
- <i> Thank you.</i>

617
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,834
Uh, do you want to come
to church with me?

618
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:48,705
No.

619
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,381
It's been a long time since
someone got me flowers.

620
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,817
- So, thank you.
- You're welcome.

621
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,356
Hey, Produce, let me
ask you a question.

622
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,478
What do you think of that boy?

623
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,394
<i>Well, I think he's arrogant</i>

624
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:15,565
and I would love
to give him a karate chop.

625
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,368
Me, too, boy. Me, too.

626
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,404
All right, have a good Sunday.

627
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:24,674
Uh, well, I don't
want to be late.

628
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:28,378
If I ride my bike,
I'll be late.

629
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,647
Can you please give me a ride?

630
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:31,376
Please?

631
00:37:31,402 --> 00:37:34,284
But I've got to go play
golf with my friend.

632
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,286
And then afterwards
I got a real big meeting.

633
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:37,621
- So...
- I know... I know that.

634
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:41,591
I do understand that,
but I need a ride, please.

635
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,427
Give me a ride, please.

636
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,665
All right, what time...
how... how...

637
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,634
all right, just...

638
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,942
Now I'm gonna drop you
off, but I'm not going inside.

639
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:02,345
Your daughter
is extremely sweet.

640
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:04,581
Yes.

641
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,685
I just wish she came
with an instruction manual.

642
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:12,022
Why would she come
with an instruction manual?

643
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,562
Oh, crap.

644
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,398
- Ah, man.
- What's the matter, Mr. Campbell?

645
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,933
Uh, nothing.

646
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,436
I had some drinks this morning.
Damn it!

647
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:34,811
Do you have any...

648
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:37,947
Hey, Mr. Officer.

649
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,951
- Hi, Calvin.
- Hey, Mitch, how you doing?

650
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,821
Good, good. What's, uh...

651
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,389
Wha... what's going on here?

652
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,924
Uh, well...

653
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,826
I'm just, uh...

654
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,594
I'm just teaching
the boy how to drive.

655
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:52,796
- Uh-huh.
- You know?

656
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:54,097
And he's doing pretty great.

657
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,799
He's just... he's going
a little fast.

658
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:57,801
He doesn't know any better.

659
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,769
Yeah, right, I... right.

660
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,740
Well, uh...

661
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:06,009
Encouragement helps.

662
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:11,648
All right, uh, you're... you're
doing a great job here, son.

663
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,850
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

664
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,785
Just slow it down.
Speed kills, remember that.

665
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,488
Okay. Speed kills.
I'll remember that.

666
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,657
Speed kills.

667
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:23,126
All right.

668
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:24,729
- You boys have a nice day.
<i>- All right.</i>

669
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,129
- Thanks.
- Be careful.

670
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,631
Thank you, Officer.

671
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:33,536
<i>Good job.</i>

672
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,572
<i>Good, good.</i>

673
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:38,141
I think you better drive.

674
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,809
Well...

675
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:44,381
you're about to drive a car.

676
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,951
Go.

677
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,955
Real slow.

678
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,557
Keep your eyes on the road.

679
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,727
I've never driven a car before.

680
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,664
- I only have a bicycle.
- Well, you're doing good.

681
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,767
This is incredible!

682
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:09,739
Hey, uh...

683
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,775
so I'm gonna be a little late.

684
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:12,809
Yeah, something came up.

685
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,677
I gotta take somebody to church

686
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,814
and it's taking a little
longer than I thought.

687
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:19,983
Yeah, I'll see ya.

688
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,751
All right, all right.

689
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,823
You can't get past me.
You can't get past me.

690
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,958
You can't get...

691
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,896
Oh, spoiled!

692
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,098
Nice!

693
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,801
All right, all the way.
I got him.

694
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:40,403
<i>- Kick it. Do it. Ah!</i>

695
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,045
You're coming inside,
Mr. Campbell?

696
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,214
Uh... next time.

697
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,919
- Promise?
- I can't promise.

698
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:58,621
<i>Hey, is this</i>
<i>your secret, Produce?</i>

699
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,057
It's no secret, Mr. Campbell.

700
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:03,860
Huh.

701
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,464
Well, good luck at your
baseball meeting tonight.

702
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,267
- Thanks, bud.
- You're welcome.

703
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,769
- Have fun at church.
- Thanks.

704
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,246
<i>Huh.</i>

705
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,684
Huh.

706
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,089
<i>All right, so who is she?</i>

707
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,891
Who?

708
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:37,253
This friend you've been
spending all this time with.

709
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,263
The market, church.

710
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:41,965
Who is she and can I
please see a picture?

711
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,566
Oh, it's not a lady.

712
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,536
I've been hanging out
with that kid, Produce.

713
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:49,172
- The retarded kid?
- Hey, easy.

714
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:52,008
It's called Down Syndrome.

715
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,879
I'll tell you something, you
spend a second with this kid

716
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:58,248
and you realize he's
just like you and me.

717
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,049
You're a genius.

718
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,519
What's guaranteed
to make people spend money?

719
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:05,121
The mentally handicapped...
challenged, whatever you call it.

720
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,090
That's what I need for my
new dealership commercial.

721
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:09,158
Like you're gonna give money

722
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,628
to the Special Olympics or something
every time you sell a car?

723
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,129
- What are you talking about?
- No, you tool bag.

724
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:15,131
I want him to star in my commercial.
It's perfect.

725
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,200
Come on, Milt.

726
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,769
Okay, maybe not him, maybe one of
his special buddies will do it.

727
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:23,072
- Hey, conversation's over.
- Cal.

728
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:25,575
Come on, man, sales are down.

729
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:28,211
Do your old buddy Milt
a solid and call the kid.

730
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:31,114
He won't know the difference.

731
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,982
Maybe he'll do it for free.
You know, he's retarded.

732
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:34,684
Hey!

733
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,252
I said it's Down Syndrome.

734
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,621
Okay, what are you...

735
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,023
you feeling sorry for him?

736
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:44,727
No, Milt, I feel sorry for you.

737
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,863
B.S., man, you feel
sorry for yourself.

738
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:52,074
You've been feeling sorry for yourself
since Detroit kicked you off the team.

739
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,840
- What'd you just say to me?
- You heard every word I said.

740
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:01,010
I'm not gonna sit here
and debate some loser

741
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:04,080
who can't get over the fact that he
was an embarrassment in the majors.

742
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,352
What, are you gonna freeze?

743
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:12,722
Is your whole life
just gonna freeze?

744
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,657
Just like you did
at home plate?

745
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,647
Mr. Campbell!

746
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,082
Where are you?

747
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:59,068
<i>Hey!</i>

748
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,237
What are you doing up there?!

749
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,840
<i>Produce,</i>

750
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:05,742
you scared me.

751
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:06,976
<i>Come on.</i>

752
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:13,650
Hey, watch your step, Produce.

753
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,385
There's all sorts of...

754
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,020
<i>There's just stuff.</i>

755
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,658
Did you drink
that whole bottle?

756
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,026
Not yet.

757
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,935
Now I did.

758
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:38,775
<i>Are you sure that you
are okay, Mr. Campbell?</i>

759
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:42,679
I'm okay. Now that
you're here, I'm great.

760
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,181
I got my drinking buddy.

761
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,218
Uh, maybe we can go
to the batting cages

762
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,022
and be baseball buddies,
not drinking buddies?

763
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,993
You wanna be my baseball buddy?

764
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:59,028
- <i> Yeah, I do.</i>
- Uh, okay.

765
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,330
Here. First lesson...

766
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:05,401
when
you make it to the majors...

767
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,136
'cause you will...

768
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:13,810
and you're standing
at the home plate

769
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:16,345
and there's 40,000 people...

770
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:19,248
cheering for you,

771
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,818
expecting anything...

772
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:26,022
don't forget to swing the bat.

773
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,225
I know that, Mr. Campbell.

774
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,394
Gah, you knew that.

775
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,263
You know everything, huh?
You're a smart guy.

776
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,471
Okay, answer me this...

777
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:44,207
who hit the ball
400 feet on to the roof

778
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,909
of Stevenson High School
when he was a junior?

779
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,747
Was it you, Mr. Campbell?

780
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,348
Uh, well, it wasn't you, was it?

781
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,417
- No, it wasn't me.
- No, it wasn't you.

782
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,286
Yeah, it was me.

783
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,921
It was me.

784
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:06,229
I was supposed to be great.

785
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:14,270
Well, to me,
I think you're great.

786
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,405
Well, of course you do!

787
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:18,407
Of course you do.
You think melons are great.

788
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:23,446
- I don't like it when you drink.
- You know what?

789
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,981
I don't like it when you drink

790
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:26,916
and I don't want to be
your drinking buddy

791
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:29,185
and I don't want to be your baseball buddy.
Do you understand me?

792
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:32,188
<i>I don't want to be your buddy anymore.
I'm sorry.</i>

793
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:36,292
I have a meeting I gotta go to

794
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,394
at 6:00 tonight.

795
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:45,868
It's, like,
a really big meeting...

796
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,972
with really big...
big, important people.

797
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,848
<i>Hey. Toss 'em up.</i>

798
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,416
I don't think that
you should drive.

799
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:03,252
God, toss up the keys, Produce.

800
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:05,288
<i>I'll call Miss Katie</i>
<i>to pick you up.</i>

801
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:14,831
- Produce...
- I'll call Miss Katie to pick you up.

802
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,000
I'm gonna come
down there, Produce.

803
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,369
- No!
- Co... come here! Come here!

804
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,910
Ah, man, Produce.

805
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:29,579
Produce. Hey!

806
00:47:29,581 --> 00:47:32,348
Hey!

807
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,151
Produce!

808
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,320
Hey.

809
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:40,857
If I'm late...
I'm walking and if I'm late,

810
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,892
it's your fault.

811
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:44,961
It's your fault!

812
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:09,151
Hello?

813
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:14,624
It's Calvin Campbell.
I'm here for my interview!

814
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:17,059
I'm late!

815
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,929
Oh, come on! Open the door!

816
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:22,465
Hey. Hey!

817
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,467
Come on!

818
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,502
Come on!

819
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:41,771
You were supposed to call me
right after the meeting, Dad.

820
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:45,074
<i>Katie, it's Officer Minniear.</i>

821
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,209
- Is everything okay?
- <i> Everything's fine.</i>

822
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,045
- <i> It's, uh, just...</i>
- What happened?

823
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,380
We found him passed out in the
visitors' dugout at South,

824
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,483
so I need you to come
down here and pick him up.

825
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:02,525
Here, drink this.

826
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,093
- Cal, come on.
- <i> Hmm?</i>

827
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:05,494
Drink this.

828
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:08,464
- Thanks, Mitch.
- How you feeling?

829
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,299
I don't feel good.

830
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,404
Katie.

831
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,340
No, don't touch me, Calvin!

832
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:21,143
I'm sorry.

833
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:26,282
This is the single most
embarrassing moment of my life.

834
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:28,417
Do you have any idea
what it's like

835
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,519
picking up the man who
calls himself your father

836
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:33,456
at the police station
drunk as hell?

837
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:36,158
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

838
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,460
You're not sorry.

839
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:39,762
You're just
a pathetic little man.

840
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:42,731
You're a pathetic little man who
lives a pathetic little life.

841
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:46,268
<i>- Don't say that.</i>
- Because it's not true?

842
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,270
Because you know it is.

843
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,840
I'm sorry.

844
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:57,346
This isn't how I wanted
things to turn out, Katie.

845
00:51:57,348 --> 00:52:00,783
I just want to make sure you
know that I've given up on you.

846
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:05,187
Ah, Katie, come on. Your old
man's had a rough night.

847
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:08,891
Don't say that to me,
Katie, 'cause you're my little girl.

848
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,663
- I'm sorry.
- Get in the car.

849
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,881
Mitch, Mitch...

850
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:34,183
Mitch,

851
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:36,152
I'm sorry.

852
00:53:23,935 --> 00:53:25,534
It's okay.

853
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,470
You can... you can yell at me,

854
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:29,972
you can scream if you want to.

855
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:31,340
I deserve it.

856
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,577
Why would I do that?

857
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:38,280
I already told you
I've given up on you.

858
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:43,319
What can I do
to make this better?

859
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,821
You tell me what to do, Katie.

860
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:47,923
What can I do?

861
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:49,525
Nothing.

862
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:52,494
Katie.

863
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:57,059
Produce.

864
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:02,765
Hi, Mr. Campbell.

865
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,466
Hey, kid.

866
00:55:06,604 --> 00:55:08,637
Did you make it
to your meeting?

867
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,573
Uh... no.

868
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,375
No, I didn't.

869
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:21,650
Yeah, it's probably better
that you did not go.

870
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,933
You... you're probably right.

871
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:29,758
<i>So, are you still mad at me</i>

872
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,760
<i>for taking your keys?</i>

873
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,495
No.

874
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:40,769
So, are you here
to shop for groceries?

875
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:43,672
Come here.

876
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:47,710
I'm sorry.

877
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:15,104
<i>God grant me the serenity</i>

878
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:18,474
to accept the things
I cannot change,

879
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:21,110
the courage to change
the things I can,

880
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:23,679
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

881
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,954
Come on in.

882
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:40,562
Uh... sorry.

883
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,905
Hi, I'm Amy,
and I'm an alcoholic.

884
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,141
Hi, Amy.

885
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:54,977
Tonight's meeting
is a closed meeting.

886
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:58,259
Anyone who has a desire to stop
drinking is welcome to stay.

887
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,116
Any newcomers?

888
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:06,722
Uh...

889
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:11,160
Please stand up
and introduce yourself.

890
00:57:11,162 --> 00:57:13,996
We'd like to welcome you.

891
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:17,933
Um...

892
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:20,702
Hi, uh...

893
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:27,109
My name is Calvin Campbell.

894
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:31,079
And, uh...

895
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,948
I live here,

896
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,050
St. Matthews.

897
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:37,119
And, um...

898
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:40,756
I have a daughter.

899
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:45,194
She's 17.

900
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:47,162
Uh...

901
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:51,200
who I... I love her
more than anything.

902
00:57:51,202 --> 00:57:52,968
And, um...

903
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,941
Yeah, that's about it.

904
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:03,145
<i>- Hi, Calvin.</i>
- Hi, Calvin.

905
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:04,646
Hi.

906
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:08,217
<i>Thank you.</i>

907
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:11,920
<i>Um, just for future,</i>

908
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,689
first name only is fine.

909
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:15,958
That's kind of
the anonymous part.

910
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,659
And, um...

911
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:20,195
it's customary to state
that you're an alcoholic.

912
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:22,097
That part is...

913
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,632
self-explanatory.

914
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:29,571
<i>All right, tonight I'll be
reading from step three.</i>

915
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,139
<i>"Made a decision</i>
<i>to turn our will and lives</i>

916
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:34,576
<i>over to the care of God</i>

917
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,038
What?

918
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:53,275
Do you love me, Colt?

919
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,179
You don't love me.

920
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:59,147
Why would you even say that?

921
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:03,018
If you loved me,
we'd be in the backseat

922
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,060
right now
and I'd be hitting it.

923
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,791
Prick.

924
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:13,128
What did you just say to me?

925
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,298
- Nothing.
- All right, get out of my car, Katie.

926
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,166
What?

927
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:20,469
I'm not doing this baby
stuff with you anymore.

928
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:23,405
I'm over it, all right? Get out.

929
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,474
- You know what? You are a prick.
- Yeah, and you know what?

930
01:02:25,476 --> 01:02:28,443
You're not hot enough for me to
be trying this hard anymore.

931
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:30,011
Get out.

932
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:04,446
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

933
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:09,251
- Hey, you okay?
- <i> Uh, will you come pick me up?</i>

934
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:09,907
Yeah.

935
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:12,521
<i>I-I would have called
someone else, but...</i>

936
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:16,291
- I'm behind the Valumarket.
- <i> What are you doing there?</i>

937
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:19,561
Well, Colt wanted to go somewhere
that we could be alone.

938
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:21,830
I... just please come get me?

939
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:23,832
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

940
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:26,754
I'm coming to get you right now.
I'll be right there.

941
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:45,120
- <i> Hey, Miss Katie.</i>
- Hi, Produce.

942
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:51,193
I probably look silly just standing
out here all by myself in the dark.

943
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:52,527
Are you cold?

944
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:54,896
Yeah, but won't you be cold?

945
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:56,198
No.

946
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,409
Thank you.

947
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:03,605
I think you look beautiful.

948
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,143
- Well, you're very sweet.
- You're welcome.

949
01:04:13,217 --> 01:04:16,537
Produce, listen to me. I need
you to go back inside, okay?

950
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:21,523
Produce, go back inside.

951
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:22,369
What are you doing here?

952
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:24,092
No, leave him alone.
He didn't do anything.

953
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:27,494
Listen, I don't care about the
'tard, I'm talking to you.

954
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:30,031
I came back
to apologize, Katie.

955
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,234
I'm sorry for
what I said earlier.

956
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:45,447
Damn, you drunk again,
Mr. Campbell?

957
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:50,652
- You touch either one of them...
- Oh, you'll what?

958
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:52,220
Huh?

959
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:56,124
Go home.

960
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:58,426
<i>- We're over, Colt.</i>

961
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:02,130
<i>Okay. Fine.</i>

962
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:03,565
Have it your way.

963
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:07,402
Hey.

964
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,484
Thanks for coming.

965
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:12,540
I'm trying, Katie.

966
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:15,076
- I'm trying.
- I know.

967
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:17,512
- Thanks, Dad.
- And you...

968
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:20,515
thank you

969
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,183
for protecting my daughter.

970
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:24,019
You're welcome.

971
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:27,581
I wish there was something
we could do to repay you.

978
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:59,187
We're gonna leave
in a couple of minutes.

979
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:00,956
So what did you guys
think of the service?

980
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,557
Well, I mean, she liked it.

981
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,360
She was smiles
and, uh, I liked it.

982
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:06,661
Think you guys
will make it back?

983
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:08,697
I don't know. You know?

984
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:11,700
It's been a long time since I've
darkened the doorway of a, uh...

985
01:06:11,702 --> 01:06:13,401
Of a church?

986
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:16,204
Yeah, of a church.

987
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:19,074
I just... you know.

988
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:22,210
I haven't had much faith
in anything in a long time.

989
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:27,482
I hear you.

990
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,017
- Yeah.
- How's everything else been going?

991
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:30,418
Um...

992
01:06:31,455 --> 01:06:34,089
One day at a time.

993
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:35,457
That's right.

994
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,460
Hey, um, can we...

995
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:41,029
can I take you
to get some coffee or...

996
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:46,001
- Um...
- Yeah.

997
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:49,571
Yeah, you got coffee.

998
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:51,339
- Hey, Katie.
- You ready to go?

999
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,375
I am. Uh, Katie,
this is Miss Amy.

1000
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:55,443
- Hi.
- Hi.

1001
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,645
- Nice to meet you.
- It's really nice to meet you.

1002
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,347
I've heard a lot about you.

1003
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,216
Oh, well, hopefully all good.

1004
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:02,484
- Sometimes.
- Thanks.

1005
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:03,752
- Definitely all good.
- Thank you.

1006
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:06,154
Okay.

1007
01:07:06,156 --> 01:07:08,556
- Okay.
- All right.

1008
01:07:08,558 --> 01:07:11,393
- Bye. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1009
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:13,194
- Come on, Dad.
- Come back.

1010
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,463
- We will.
- I'll see you later.

1011
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:39,120
You swing with
your club face open.

1012
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:44,671
What do you know? You swing a
club worse than you swing a bat.

1013
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:50,952
Did you just come here
to mock my golf game?

1014
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,471
I came here to apologize.

1015
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:00,643
Cal, the things I said to
you, man, everything I said...

1016
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:04,145
Hey, what you said was true
and I needed to hear it.

1017
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,088
- Missed you, buddy.
- I'm sorry.

1018
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,556
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1019
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:16,318
- You should be sorry.
- It was a cheap shot.

1020
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:20,228
Let's get out of here.
Let's get a beer.

1021
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,865
How about we make it a coffee?

1022
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:26,868
- A coffee?
- AA.

1023
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,372
You're not an alcoholic, Cal.

1024
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,842
I am.

1025
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:36,811
I'm an alcoholic.

1026
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:41,649
Okay, happy hour. Two for one.

1027
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,486
Two for me, none for you.

1028
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:06,441
- Hey, Dexter.
- Hey, what's up, Calvin?

1029
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:08,243
How you doing?

1030
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:09,744
So today is the day
that you announce

1031
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:12,614
the Employee
of the Month, right?

1032
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:17,585
- Yeah, why?
- Well, um, have you considered Produce?

1033
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:20,455
- He's a hard worker.
- Now, Cal, I have a soft spot

1034
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:21,756
- in my heart for that young man.
- Yeah, I know.

1035
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,358
That's why I hired him
the first time.

1036
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,560
He's a good boy.
He's a good guy.

1037
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:27,562
Now... now, look, Cal.

1038
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,198
Now, Produce ain't got
the sense God gave a cucumber.

1039
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,933
Now, I gotta give that award
to employee that represent

1040
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:33,635
what this supermarket is about.

1041
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,403
This ain't no YMCA where
everybody gets a trophy.

1042
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:37,672
Okay, and with all due respect,

1043
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:41,309
I think that Produce is probably the
hardest-working employee that you have.

1044
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:44,279
I mean he knows the name and the
SKU number, the code or whatever

1045
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:45,647
to every piece of fruit
and vegetable over in your...

1046
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:47,749
- Now, Cal.
- ...section over there.

1047
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,784
Just because the boy's a retard,
he don't get no special treatment.

1048
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:52,187
- You know better than that, man.
- You know what?

1049
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:54,455
We don't use the "R" word just
like we don't use the "N" word.

1050
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,224
You know?

1051
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:59,260
We should be clear
on our word choice, Dexter.

1052
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:18,213
Let's get out of here.

1053
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:20,215
Hey.

1054
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:22,517
Wanna go have some fun?

1055
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:24,419
Hmm? Let's go.

1056
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:39,534
Well, do you guys wanna
hit the go-karts?

1057
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:41,569
- Go-karts? Do we?
- Yeah! I'll do the go-karts.

1058
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,405
We were made to hit
the go-karts, Produce.

1059
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:45,640
Made.

1060
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:48,409

There you go.

1072
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:49,871
You're making this
hard on me, Milt.

1073
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:52,073
Come on, don't be soft.

1074
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,876
They call that enabling.

1075
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:57,478
It's called testing.
Good job, you passed.

1076
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,721
These are actually both for me.

1077
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:04,619
- Where's your family at?
- Franklin's dropping them off.

1078
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:08,056
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

1079
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:09,757
- We're playing house.
- Hmm.

1080
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:26,474
All right, give me a sip.

1081
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:27,383
Really?

1082
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:31,012
Yeah, just a sip, a taste,
to knock off the edge.

1083
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:33,295
Are you sure about this?

1084
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:36,617
One sip.

1085
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:38,519
I've been real, real good.

1086
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,925
Ah, come on.

1087
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,560
I may have lost
my drinking buddy,

1088
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:48,529
but I still gotta look out
for my best friend.

1089
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,798
Besides, the beer was terrible.
Tasted stale.

1090
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,134
- Did it?
- No.

1091
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:54,702
I just remembered I had this.

1092
01:12:56,606 --> 01:12:58,807
I don't want a sip of that.

1093
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,839
Yeah.

1094
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:07,815
Look who we found,
Mr. Campbell.

1095
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,817
Produce wanted me to come
have pizza with him.

1096
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:11,719
Um...

1097
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,155
- Amy.
- Hi, I'm Milt Malcolm.

1098
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:17,158
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- How are you? Nice to meet you.

1099
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,160
Nice work.

1100
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:21,763
Oh, cavalry has arrived.
Excuse me, folks.

1101
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,965
See ya, buddy.

1102
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,666
All right, come on, let's go.

1103
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:29,504
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1104
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:33,775
I'll be right there.

1105
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:40,681
Thank you so much.

1106
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:44,018
<i>It means a lot.</i>

1107
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,627
I... I'm sorry.

1108
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:02,870
Milt.

1109
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,539
Milt!

1110
01:14:06,543 --> 01:14:08,009
Listen, that...
that wasn't anything...

1111
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:09,744
I'm not listening to you!

1112
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:15,148
You're killing me. You're killing me!

1113
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:24,759
<i>Hey, Produce, you
want to go play some games?</i>

1114
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:26,160
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

1115
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:27,762
- Bye.
- See ya later.

1116
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,831
- Wait...
- Ha.

1117
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,532
- <i> Wait...</i>
- We just got ditched.

1118
01:14:33,203 --> 01:14:36,723
Yeah, I think your daughter
just stole him from me.

1119
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:41,075
- Hi.
- How you doing?

1120
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,978
Ah.

1121
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,013
I'm good, yeah.

1122
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:49,083
Nice.

1123
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:52,720
Come on, go get a pizza.

1124
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:54,755
- Pizza.
- Talking your language?

1125
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:56,123
That's unique.

1126
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:02,230
I know how to do this.
I love laser tag.

1127
01:15:02,232 --> 01:15:04,198
Thanks.

1128
01:15:05,802 --> 01:15:08,503
Hey! We're on
the same team, remember?

1129
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,073
Hey, Katie.

1130
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:17,211
Come on.

1131
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:20,681
- I wanna play.
- No, we can play later.

1132
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,683
<i>Come on, guys, it's
the last game of the night.</i>

1133
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:23,985
Then we can come back tomorrow.

1134
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:25,953
We're on the same team,
remember?

1135
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,555
I'll protect you.

1136
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:31,893
Oh, my gosh, you got me, man.

1137
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:36,063
<i>Come on, guys. It's just a
silly game of laser tag.</i>

1138
01:15:36,065 --> 01:15:38,933
- Come on, Katie, let's beat 'em!
- Let's go.

1139
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:17,393
What?

1140
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:20,141
What do you need to be
so rude for, Katie, huh?

1141
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:20,684
What does that mean?

1142
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:22,143
Remember? Remember you
used to say you loved me?

1143
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:24,312
- No, Colt. What are you doing?
- Once upon a time.

1144
01:16:24,314 --> 01:16:26,781
- I just wanna talk, that's all.
- Okay, well, I don't wanna talk.

1145
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:29,283
- Yeah, you don't need to talk.
- No, you need to put your hands off me.

1146
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,686
No, no, listen, I just want you
to lay back down right now.

1147
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:33,621
- That's it.
- You're disgusting.

1148
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:35,656
- Disgusting?
- No, my dad was right about you.

1149
01:16:35,658 --> 01:16:37,224
- Oh, my God.
- Stop!

1150
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:40,027
- Stop! Get off!
- Shh!

1151
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:43,197
This would be easier if you just...

1152
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,906
- Hey, I shot you guys!
- Get out of here, Produce.

1153
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:54,709
No! Is that Miss Katie?

1154
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:56,344
- Get out of here!
<i>- Shut up, Katie!</i>

1155
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:57,812
- No!
- Now!

1156
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:04,218
Shut up!

1157
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,821
Will you shut up?

1158
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:09,757
Shut up. Ah, come on, shut up!

1159
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:25,840
- Dad!
- Yeah?

1160
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:27,074
Dad, please come help. Hurry!

1161
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:28,676
What's wrong, baby?
What's wrong?

1162
01:17:28,678 --> 01:17:31,345
Produce hit Colt
and it's really bad.

1163
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:32,780
What?

1164
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:42,657
Oh, no.

1165
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,259
<i>Hey, should you call 911?</i>

1166
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:47,361
Yeah.

1167
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:50,398
What did you do, Produce?

1168
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:54,802
- You're not proud of me?
- No, I'm not proud of you!

1169
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:58,372
You cannot hit somebody
with a fire extinguisher!

1170
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:00,341
I mean, are you...
are you crazy?!

1171
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,942
I thought we'd be
like brothers!

1172
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:03,878
You go call your mom right now!

1173
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,080
And you bring her here,
Produce.

1174
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,084
- Ah...
- Dad, it wasn't his fault.

1175
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:12,887
He was just trying to
protect me from Colt.

1176
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:13,497
Wh... what do you mean?

1177
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:15,056
I don't know what would
have happened if he didn't...

1178
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:17,792
Oh, baby.

1179
01:18:17,794 --> 01:18:20,928
Oh, I'm sorry.

1180
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,030
I'm sorry.

1181
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,399
Now is he gonna be all right?

1182
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,968
Once he gets treated,
we'll take him in

1183
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,104
and interview him, find out a little
bit more about what happened.

1184
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:31,972
- Okay.
- Where's the kid?

1185
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:34,275
<i>Obviously, we'll need</i>
<i>to talk to him.</i>

1186
01:18:34,277 --> 01:18:37,344
We don't know.
Um, he just took off.

1187
01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:40,414
<i>Okay, I'll send some officers
to... to go look for him.</i>

1188
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:42,950
Is he gonna be in trouble?
Produce?

1189
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:45,119
I don't foresee that.
I think it's, uh...

1190
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:46,887
we just need to ask him
some questions.

1191
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,190
<i>Find out a little bit more</i>
<i>about... about what went on.</i>

1192
01:18:49,192 --> 01:18:50,925
All right, well, it's my fault,
so I'm gonna get in the car

1193
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:53,060
and I'm just gonna go
look for him.

1194
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,895
All right, I'm gonna stay here and
see if I can get ahold of him.

1195
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,864
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll go with you.

1196
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:58,833
- Thank you, Officer.
- <i> Certainly.</i>

1197
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:01,675
- Let us know if you find out anything.
- Absolutely.

1198
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,913
We can't just be
driving around blindly

1199
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,448
looking for him all night.

1200
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,885
- We have no choice.
- Yeah, we do.

1201
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:19,787
I think I'm gonna
take you home.

1202
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:21,088
Maybe just wait for him there.

1203
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,456
Maybe he'll show up
at the house.

1204
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:23,891
No, he's not gonna
show up at the house, Dad.

1205
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:25,493
And I'd rather be
with you right now.

1206
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:48,082
What does Milt want?

1207
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:51,485
Hey, buddy boy,
what do you need?

1208
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:54,088
Let's meet up, man.
Let's meet up.

1209
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:56,323
<i>No, I can't right now. Katie
and I are looking for Produce.</i>

1210
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:59,126
- <i> We're just driving around.</i>
- I talked with him.

1211
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,369
- <i> Can't do that right now.</i>

1212
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:02,530
- Frank, he said he
wasn't sleeping with her.

1213
01:20:02,532 --> 01:20:04,465
She wanted to.

1214
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:06,233
I believe him, man. Oh, jeez!

1215
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:13,340
Hey! Milt?

1216
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:16,143
Hey, answer me! Milt!

1217
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:40,267
Hey. Hey, Amy.

1218
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,136
Hey, is Produce okay?

1219
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:43,871
No, not good.

1220
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:46,006
- Are you his father?
- Uh, no. Uh-uh.

1221
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,142
Dr. Jones wants to speak
to his next of kin

1222
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:49,443
to discuss what's going
to be happening today.

1223
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:51,545
All right,
we'll call his mother.

1224
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:54,381
No, she died over a year ago.

1225
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:57,484
What?

1226
01:20:57,486 --> 01:21:00,154
He talks about her
all the time.

1227
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:03,157
I know. I'm... I'm so sorry.

1228
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:05,159
I thought you knew.

1229
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:06,861
<i>Ho... ho... hold on a second.</i>

1230
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:09,330
So you're telling me
that he lives all on his own?

1231
01:21:09,332 --> 01:21:13,601
Even... even with his...
with... with his condition?

1232
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:15,903
Yeah.

1233
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:18,572
Does that really surprise you?

1234
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:21,508
The patient with DS is... really
wants a book or his book...

1235
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,310
You know what? Let me talk to him.
I'll talk to him.

1236
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:25,312
I'm sorry. I'm only allowed
to have family back there.

1237
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:25,961
Please.

1238
01:21:25,987 --> 01:21:28,549
Ma'am, we are the only
family that he has.

1239
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:31,063
Okay? Amy, do you mind
sticking with Katie?

1240
01:21:31,089 --> 01:21:31,919
Yeah.

1241
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:33,921
- I got it. Thank you.
<i>- Where is he?</i>

1242
01:21:33,923 --> 01:21:35,589
Thank you very much.

1243
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,429
Hey. Hey.

1244
01:21:42,431 --> 01:21:46,300
Oh...

1245
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:48,135
Hey, buddy.

1246
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:50,938
How you doing, Produce?

1247
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:54,308
Hey, Produce, how you doing?

1248
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:59,079
- Hurts so bad.
- Yeah.

1249
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:00,948
I bet you do.

1250
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:05,286
Hey, I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

1251
01:22:05,288 --> 01:22:06,954
Okay?

1252
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:08,555
Back at that laser tag place,

1253
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:12,526
I... I realize you were
just trying to protect Katie.

1254
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:15,195
I just wanted to say thank you.

1255
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:17,965
You're welcome, Mr. Campbell.

1256
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:19,633
<i>I'm sorry, Cal.</i>

1257
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:25,072
- I want to have my book.
- You want your book?

1258
01:22:25,074 --> 01:22:26,640
Yes.

1259
01:22:29,578 --> 01:22:31,278
- You want your book?
- <i> Yes.</i>

1260
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:35,382
Oh, you want your book!
I'm gonna go get your book.

1261
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:38,252
I'll be right back. Hey.

1262
01:22:38,254 --> 01:22:40,421
Your wife's on her way.

1263
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:54,201
- Hey, darling.
- Hey, Dad.

1264
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,736
Hey, sweetheart, will you
run to the car real quick

1265
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:57,604
and grab Produce's Bible
for me?

1266
01:22:57,606 --> 01:23:00,207
- Hi. How are you doing?
- I'm fine. Fine.

1267
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:02,009
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

1268
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:04,478
I just saw Milt. He looks good.

1269
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,282
He's gonna be all right.
Wanna go back and see him?

1270
01:23:08,284 --> 01:23:12,086
Actually, um, I'm not sure
he wants to see me.

1271
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:14,421
Okay.

1272
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:17,024
I mean, I think... I think
that he would wanna see you.

1273
01:23:17,026 --> 01:23:19,660
You sure?

1274
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:22,196
You know, I don't wanna
get him all worked up.

1275
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:23,564
- Okay.
- So...

1276
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:26,066
Okay. Okay. You okay?

1277
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:28,269
Yeah.

1278
01:23:32,074 --> 01:23:36,377
Hey, here's the book I got
that you asked for.

1279
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:38,278
<i>It's not for me.</i>

1280
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,381
What are you...
what are you talking about?

1281
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:45,486
It's for him.

1282
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:55,529
We're looking at blunt trauma
to the left upper abdomen,

1283
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,599
ruptured spleen, severe internal
bleeding, and hypertension.

1284
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:00,667
Should I order an
exploratory laparotomy?

1285
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:03,337
No time. Make sure we're prepped
for a splenectomy, stat.

1286
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:04,772
I don't wanna lose this kid.

1287
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,574
Okay.

1288
01:24:10,146 --> 01:24:12,046
Mr. Campbell.

1289
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:14,568
<i>You're gonna be
all right, kid, I promise.</i>

1290
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:23,057
Please don't leave me here.

1291
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:26,060
Hey, I'm right here, Milt.

1292
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,330
I'm right here, pal.

1293
01:24:33,102 --> 01:24:35,369
Look what the kid gave you.

1294
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:42,076
- He's a good kid.
- Yeah.

1295
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:46,213
- I'm scared, Cal.
- Hey, hey.

1296
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:47,648
You're gonna be all right.

1297
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:56,390
My mom used to do that
back when I was a kid...

1298
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:58,192
read me the Bible.

1299
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:02,863
I used to like Matthew.

1300
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:04,865
I can't remember why.

1301
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,475
Hey, Sue?

1302
01:25:14,477 --> 01:25:15,876
Come on.

1303
01:25:29,258 --> 01:25:32,192
All right. Huh? Pick up.

1304
01:25:42,204 --> 01:25:43,570
"...who are weary and burdened."

1305
01:25:43,572 --> 01:25:45,472
And I will give you rest.

1306
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:48,475
<i>Take my yoke upon you</i>
<i>and learn from me.</i>

1307
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,611
- <i> For I am gentle and humble in heart..."</i>
<i>- We need to get him</i>

1308
01:25:50,613 --> 01:25:53,493
<i>- into surgery now.
- "...and you will find rest..."</i>

1309
01:25:54,884 --> 01:25:56,416
Give me another set
of retractors.

1310
01:25:56,418 --> 01:25:58,418
I see some bleeding
in the left kidney.

1311
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,758
Get two units of blood, stat!

1312
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,693
More suction!

1313
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:11,412
There you go. Bring that in closer.

1314
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:41,828
Hey, thanks.

1315
01:26:46,936 --> 01:26:48,669
What did you say?

1316
01:26:50,339 --> 01:26:52,773
- When?
- When you prayed.

1317
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:56,777
I don't know.

1318
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:00,714
I said a prayer, too.

1319
01:27:02,318 --> 01:27:04,851
That was the first time
I've actually prayed.

1320
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:07,588
Yeah?

1321
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:09,256
Me, too.

1322
01:27:10,826 --> 01:27:15,495
I-I asked that Milt and
Produce will be okay.

1323
01:27:15,497 --> 01:27:18,298
- Do you think it'll happen?
- I hope so.

1324
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:22,402
I hope so.

1325
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:28,795
But I don't know if that's the
way it works, sweetheart.

1326
01:27:29,979 --> 01:27:32,813
Well, then, what good is it to pray
if you don't get what you ask for?

1327
01:27:39,455 --> 01:27:40,687
Okay.

1328
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:48,929
Growing up, did I get you
everything that you ever asked for?

1329
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:51,331
- Of course not.
- No.

1330
01:27:53,636 --> 01:27:55,402
But I love you so much

1331
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:59,473
and I want you to have
everything that you want,

1332
01:27:59,475 --> 01:28:01,475
but sometimes it's not
in your best interest

1333
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:05,579
or it's just, uh...
it's just a hard decision.

1334
01:28:07,483 --> 01:28:09,416
It's not fair.

1335
01:28:10,486 --> 01:28:12,853
I'm saying that God...

1336
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:16,556
is probably not a genie...

1337
01:28:18,027 --> 01:28:21,495
you know, that's granting
every wish or...

1338
01:28:21,497 --> 01:28:24,464
I don't know. I don't know.

1339
01:28:26,035 --> 01:28:27,901
Maybe you're right.

1340
01:28:27,903 --> 01:28:30,370
I hope that you get
what you asked for tonight.

1341
01:28:31,573 --> 01:28:33,707
Thanks, Dad.

1342
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:35,709
He's crashing! Come on!

1343
01:28:35,711 --> 01:28:37,544
Doctor, get that
off of the paper.

1344
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:42,049
Get two units of blood!

1345
01:28:44,887 --> 01:28:46,620
Probing.

1346
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:48,655
Where's the CO2?

1347
01:28:56,098 --> 01:28:57,798
<i>You know, it's
in moments like these.</i>

1348
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:01,335
<i>I'm reminded</i>
<i>of one profound truth.</i>

1349
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:02,936
<i>Life is short.</i>

1350
01:29:02,938 --> 01:29:05,605
And it's meant to be lived
with courage

1351
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:08,075
and not laden with fear.

1352
01:29:08,077 --> 01:29:10,544
<i>And you have to decide</i>

1353
01:29:10,546 --> 01:29:13,914
<i>are your dreams bigger</i>
<i>than your memories?</i>

1354
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:17,351
<i>Or will you stay</i>
<i>stuck in the past?</i>

1355
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:21,555
Life is meant to be lived.
Lived abundantly.

1356
01:29:21,557 --> 01:29:24,024
You know, you look around this
cemetery, you see there are...

1357
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:27,494
there are two dates
on every tombstone.

1358
01:29:27,496 --> 01:29:29,963
There's a birthdate
and there is a date of death.

1359
01:29:29,965 --> 01:29:32,366
<i>Every human being</i>

1360
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:35,035
<i>is guaranteed those two dates,</i>

1361
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:36,870
<i>but that little dash</i>

1362
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,072
<i>that lies in between</i>
<i>those two numbers,</i>

1363
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:41,575
<i>that's what defines our life.</i>

1364
01:29:41,577 --> 01:29:44,144
<i>So make your dash count.</i>

1365
01:29:44,146 --> 01:29:47,647
<i>Live. Really live.</i>

1366
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:27,888
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, let's welcome</i>

1367
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:30,457
<i>our new Louisville Bats
manager, Calvin Campbell,</i>

1368
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:33,493
<i>who will now take the mound</i>
<i>to throw out the first pitch.</i>

1369
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,654
Wow.

1370
01:31:00,656 --> 01:31:02,088
I want to dedicate
this first pitch

1371
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:03,957
to someone
very important to me,

1372
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:08,228
uh, who's not able to be here
with us tonight because...

1373
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,564
well...

1374
01:31:10,566 --> 01:31:13,200
his life ended way too soon.

1375
01:31:13,202 --> 01:31:14,668
Produce...

1376
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:19,233
can I have a ball, please?

1377
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:29,850
Yeah! Ha-ha!

1378
01:31:29,852 --> 01:31:31,251
That's my boy! Ha-ha!

1379
01:31:33,188 --> 01:31:35,555
- Knock 'em down, man.
- Thanks.
