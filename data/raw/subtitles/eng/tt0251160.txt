1
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:43,811
Come on.

2
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,342
The problem is,
our economy is slowing down.

3
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,184
You all know that
as well as anybody does.

4
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:03,020
I bet you've got friends and maybe
yourself understand what it means

5
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:07,897
to have credit card debt, and when
you couple that with high energy bills,

6
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:10,606
there are some people
beginning to feel pinched.

7
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:12,867
It makes sense.
To take control...

8
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:14,111
John?

9
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,745
Honey, what's wrong?

10
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:24,630
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like?

11
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,509
- That's my car.
- That's not what the bank says.

12
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:30,553
- Come on!
- Try paying your bills.

13
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:54,827
What's going on?

14
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,379
I'm sorry. I talked to the bank.
They promised they'd work with me.

15
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:10,885
- John, that was two months ago.
- We're down to one last month's rent.

16
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,503
It's either the car
or the house, so I thought...

17
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,010
- You thought.
- You want them to throw us out?

18
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:20,975
I'm down to 20 hours at the plant.
They're shipping all the jobs to Mexico.

19
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:24,143
- What do you want me to do?
- John, my car is gone.

20
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:28,143
I understand. Now you see I'm trying
to find a second job, baby.

21
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:31,648
You want me to say it's fine?
All right, it's fine.

22
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:35,157
The car is still ours. We own it.

23
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,621
I got to wait for my next cheque.
In two weeks, we'll be fine.

24
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:40,457
Mikey!

25
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:45,750
Yeah! Ronnie Coleman.

26
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,748
Mr Olympia two year running.

27
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:54,796
- Sit down. Eat breakfast.
- I am eating.

28
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:57,849
- A doughnut isn't breakfast.
- It's the continental breakfast.

29
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:02,104
- We're not on a continent right now.
- Dad, what do you call North America?

30
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,638
You're not going to school
till you eat breakfast, so eat.

31
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:06,268
Both of you.

32
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:12,523
I can't believe those jerks took our car.
Can you, Mom?

33
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:15,574
- No, I can't.
- What are we going to do?

34
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:19,913
You're going to do something, right, Dad?
You know what I'd do?

35
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,658
I'd get so big and mad,
I'd go crazy and kick someone's butt.

36
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:25,205
- Watch your language.
- I would.

37
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:27,663
You been watching
too much WW Wrestling.

38
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:31,878
Not wrestling, Dad. Bodybuilding.
There's a big difference.

39
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,583
Get your books.
You're going to be late.

40
00:05:36,682 --> 00:05:37,677
Hurry up, baby.

41
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,225
Can I get a ride to work?

42
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:07,661
 Ø I love you  Ø

43
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:11,461
 Ø Oh, you know I really do  Ø

44
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:16,052
- All right, all right. I got a good one.
-  Ø If I ever seen a girl  Ø

45
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:18,302
 Ø That...  Ø
Go ahead.

46
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:21,883
 Ø That you needed  Ø
Go ahead.

47
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,639
- Radishes.
- No, it's...

48
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:26,600
Reddish stick.

49
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:28,560
- I swear.
- It's "radio station."

50
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:31,728
Radio station. Okay.
That's a good one. You got me.

51
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:40,358
Honey?

52
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:46,084
- Hundred dollars?
- No, we talked about it this morning.

53
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:50,665
- Continent.
- Continent.

54
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:53,798
- Got you, right? Mom?
- How about you, Mom?

55
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:57,886
- Come on, baby.
- You just laugh at me.

56
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:02,675
- I don't like it. I'm no good at it.
- All right, something in the car.

57
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:04,933
- We won't laugh.
- We won't laugh.

58
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:06,392
Please?

59
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:11,896
- All right.
- We can't know what you're saying.

60
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,068
What? What did you say?

61
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,156
I said...

62
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,115
What?

63
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:35,333
- Come get this woman, please.
- What, it's no good?

64
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:41,055
Come on. Come on, baby.
I'll thumb-wrestle you.

65
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:45,141
- All right.
- One, two, three.

66
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:50,648
- One, two, three. She wins.
- You got it.

67
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,814
I am queen.

68
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,478
- All right, I got one.
- I got one for you. You're going to school.

69
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:00,742
Get your lunch.

70
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:15,799
Dad, I got $46
I saved from my allowance.

71
00:08:15,924 --> 00:08:18,380
- You can have it if you want.
- Yeah?

72
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:21,429
We're a family.
We got to stick together, right?

73
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:25,684
That's right. But you earned
that money, so you keep it, okay?

74
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,849
All right. See you later.

75
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:33,564
- Bye, Mike.
- Not good-bye. I hate good-bye.

76
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:37,738
- Remember? "See you later."
- All right, see you later.

77
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,662
Flex Wheeler...
275 pounds, 2% body fat.

78
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,290
Yeah, baby.

79
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,920
- John! You take my grinding wheel?
- What?

80
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:35,839
My grinding wheel!

81
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:37,674
- I do, don't I?
- You do?

82
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:41,004
- Yeah, I have sex appeal.
- No, it's not in my locker.

83
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:43,462
- My grinding wheel.
- Do you want mine?

84
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:46,552
Only two people know
the combination to my locker.

85
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:49,091
That's my grinder and you know it.

86
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:52,729
- John! Smoke, all right?
- All right.

87
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:00,898
- What's with the tie? Somebody die?
- You like that?

88
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,531
That's the tie I'm wearing to my funeral
if I don't get this job at Otisville today.

89
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,195
- There are no jobs.
- I saw it in the classifieds. They're hiring.

90
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,489
- Forget about it.
- I got to go, though.

91
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,208
- How come?
- They repo'd our car this morning.

92
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:15,713
Oh, boy.

93
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:18,665
- You want me to go with you?
- Come on.

94
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,716
Fifty cents!
This is a frigging waste of time.

95
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:30,685
Four hundred people for one job?
Give me a break.

96
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:34,810
Guaranteed somebody's son, cousin,
uncle already got this job sewn up.

97
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:37,267
Why did they put it in the paper
if they're not hiring?

98
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,360
It's a frigging run-around.
Mark my words.

99
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,983
It's either, "We'll keep your application
on file" or, "You're overqualified."

100
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:48,322
- Either way, they screw you.
- Archibald!

101
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,255
I've been working heavy machinery
for 15 years.

102
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,673
I really want the job.
Anything you want, I can do.

103
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:06,262
- I see.
- I can start today if you need.

104
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,177
Your résumé is very impressive.
You've certainly got the experience.

105
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,646
Frankly, you may be overqualified.

106
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,148
We'll keep your application on file.

107
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:29,069
 Ø Jesus loves me, this I know  Ø

108
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:33,493
 Ø For the Bible tells...  Ø

109
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:38,168
Dad, the game starts in 15 minutes.
We're going to be late.

110
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,665
 Ø... to him belong  Ø

111
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,673
 Ø They are weak, but he is strong  Ø

112
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:53,393
 Ø Yes, Jesus loves me  Ø

113
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,645
 Ø The Bible tells me so  Ø

114
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:06,361
Knock it out, baby!
Come on! To the fence!

115
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,734
Come on, Tommy!

116
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,203
Ball four!

117
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:21,370
Go, Mikey!

118
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,637
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, son. All right.

119
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:29,300
- Come on, boy!
- Knock it out!

120
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:33,678
- Keep your head down on the ball, son.
- Knock it out for your mama, baby.

121
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:34,974
Come on, Mikey!

122
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:39,307
- Sometime today, pitcher.
- There you go.

123
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,687
- Strike!
- Don't worry about it, son.

124
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:46,395
- You blind?
- Keep your head down on the ball!

125
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,284
- I hate this pitcher. How old is he?
- He's supposed to be twelve.

126
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:53,656
Twelve, my ass. Look at him.
His beard grew an inch between pitches.

127
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,743
- For your mama, baby.
- Put your elbow up, son.

128
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:01,664
- Go, baby!
- There you go, baby!

129
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:02,793
Safe!

130
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:05,711
- Safe?
- Tie goes to the runner.

131
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:10,721
Run!

132
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:20,140
Second base!

133
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,863
- Michael?
- Mikey, baby.

134
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:33,785
Somebody call an ambulance!

135
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:38,112
Somebody call
a frigging ambulance!

136
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:44,001
- Get the door!
- Get the door, Jimmy.

137
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:46,705
- Got it. Come on, let's go!
- It's going to be okay.

138
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,671
- Take him, baby.
- Give him to me.

139
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:57,515
It's Mama. Come on, Mikey.
We got to get out of here. Go!

140
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:30,090
- Help us!
- Help! Please, somebody.

141
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,674
- Calm down.
- He's not breathing.

142
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,298
All right, come with me.

143
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:38,017
He was just playing baseball,
running to second base.

144
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,726
- I don't know what happened.
- I need a doctor right away, please!

145
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,929
No. Jesus.

146
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,648
- What happened?
- He collapsed playing baseball.

147
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:48,734
- Get him on oxygen.
- Look at Mama.

148
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:51,437
- He's going to be all right, isn't he?
- Wake up.

149
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:54,410
- Anything like this ever happen before?
- No, ma'am.

150
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:55,780
- Any allergies?
- Nothing.

151
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,951
- No medication within the past year?
- Nothing!

152
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,201
- Allergies to medication?
- He's fine. He just fell down.

153
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,958
His liver's enlarged. Flip him.

154
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:06,668
- He's going to be all right, isn't he?
- Pulse is 150, pulse ox 78%.

155
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:09,254
- B.P. 68 over 34.
- What is the matter with him?

156
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:12,800
Would you come with me?
There are procedures we need to go over.

157
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:15,301
- What kind of procedures?
- We're admitting your son.

158
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,720
- You need to fill out the proper forms.
- What kind of forms?

159
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:21,635
Your son may need a transfusion.
We'll need to test you both for blood type.

160
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,104
- We're coming right back, baby.
- Wait a minute!

161
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:29,360
- First name, Mr Archibald.
- John.

162
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:32,690
- Middle initial?
- Q. Quincy.

163
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:34,733
Name of your insurance company?

164
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:38,661
- Where is he? Is he okay?
- We don't know. They're running tests.

165
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:42,289
- We're waiting to find the results.
- Is there anything we can do?

166
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:45,372
- Your card, Mr Archibald.
- I'm sorry.

167
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:49,454
Your insurance card.
I'll need to make a copy for our files.

168
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,755
It's okay. You can go in now.

169
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,292
Sweetheart.

170
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,130
How you doing, slugger?

171
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:39,678
I can't talk.

172
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:44,269
Don't worry about it. Get your rest.
We're going to be out of here in a while.

173
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:51,482
- We love you, son.
- I love you, too.

174
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,737
What is all this?

175
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:59,785
This? This is so we can
monitor Mike's vitals.

176
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:03,660
Respiratory rate,
pulse oximetry, heart rate.

177
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:08,039
And this one is blood pressure...
diastolic and systolic.

178
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:11,089
We'd like this top number
to stay above 90.

179
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:13,706
If his blood pressure drops,
we're going to have to do something.

180
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:15,835
We can't have him going
below 70 again.

181
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:20,263
Why? What would that mean,
if he went below 70 again?

182
00:17:20,392 --> 00:17:23,724
70 and below, he's in heart failure.

183
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:30,181
- If you need anything.
- Thank you.

184
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:40,117
- How's the company insurance?
- He works part time.

185
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:44,036
- She works as a grocery store clerk.
- Can we do anything?

186
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,576
I got to go.

187
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:50,493
Mr and Mrs Archibald.
I'm Rebecca Payne, Hospital Director.

188
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,289
Hi there.
It's nice to meet you.

189
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:55,673
This is Dr Turner, head of Cardiology
and Michael's doctor.

190
00:17:56,302 --> 00:17:58,544
- How do you do?
- Good. My wife.

191
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,759
How's our boy doing?

192
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,720
Please sit down.

193
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,790
This x-ray shows
a normal nine-year-old's heart.

194
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,085
This x-ray is that of your son Michael.

195
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:39,092
There are septal defects
here, here, and here

196
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:42,008
which have induced myopathy,
resulting pulmonary edema,

197
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:44,014
and malignant ventricular ectopy.

198
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:48,519
Michael's heart is approximately
three times larger than normal size.

199
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:49,844
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:54,981
I didn't understand what you said.
Could you put that in layman terms?

201
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:59,654
Basically, there's not enough blood
being pumped by Michael's heart,

202
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:03,828
so it backs up in the lungs
like a sponge getting wet.

203
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:08,240
His heart is trying,
but it's working too hard.

204
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,043
What, does he need
an operation, or...

205
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:17,461
We're considerably beyond
corrective surgery, Mr and Mrs Archibald.

206
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:19,467
Mike's heart is useless.

207
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:22,217
He's going to need a transplant
or he's going to die.

208
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,554
Wait a second.
There are other options.

209
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,852
- What options?
- To do nothing.

210
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,396
Medicate him. Make him feel
as comfortable as possible.

211
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:36,981
You're going to have to start thinking
about quality of life now.

212
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:38,737
I don't understand.

213
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:43,613
We were just with him
and he seemed fine.

214
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,448
He's going to seem fine,
but as his heart gets worse,

215
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,490
he will become increasingly fatigued,
and he will sleep more and more,

216
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:56,254
until one day he will fall asleep,
and he won't wake up.

217
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:01,051
I know this is difficult,
but you have to face the fact

218
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,262
that your son
may not live much longer.

219
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:07,757
You might want to make it
a happy time, say good-bye.

220
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:10,682
God.

221
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:14,561
Transplantation is a high-risk operation.
You could lose your son on that table.

222
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:16,851
You might not want
to take that chance.

223
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:22,864
If he doesn't have the surgery...

224
00:20:28,496 --> 00:20:31,332
If he doesn't have the surgery,
how long would he live?

225
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:33,996
Not long. Months, weeks.

226
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:36,588
Days.

227
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,297
Come on. All right.

228
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:42,920
Come on, now.

229
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:52,057
I'm sorry.

230
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:55,809
This is a lot.

231
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:13,239
All right.

232
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,170
If he was your son,
what would you do?

233
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:27,090
- I'd do the transplant, absolutely.
- Okay. Okay?

234
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:31,926
Let's do that. Let's do it.

235
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:38,849
First we've got to get Mike's name
on the organ recipient list.

236
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:42,020
He's B-positive, so his name
should go right to the top.

237
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:43,185
It's not so simple.

238
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:47,651
There are other considerations before
a recipient can be placed on a donor list.

239
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:52,661
Transplant surgery is very expensive.
In most cases, prohibitively so.

240
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,957
We got insurance, major medical.
He's covered.

241
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:58,660
We've already checked
with your carrier, Mr Archibald.

242
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:01,750
There are no provisions in your policy
for a procedure of this magnitude.

243
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:06,303
That's a mistake.
Not that you're making a mistake.

244
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:11,139
I'm just saying that I'm insured.
My son's covered.

245
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:13,308
Mrs Archibald,
do you have coverage?

246
00:22:13,436 --> 00:22:16,188
No. I've only been working
at the supermarket a couple months.

247
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:19,848
- You don't get benefits until...
- Doesn't matter. We got insurance.

248
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:25,655
I can see here
that you don't own your home.

249
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:28,403
You have no stocks,
no bonds, no investments.

250
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:32,035
- You have a little over $1,000 in savings.
- But we got insurance.

251
00:22:32,163 --> 00:22:35,164
That may very well be. You're going to
have to check with your carrier.

252
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:38,328
In the meantime, we're going to
have to treat this as a cash account.

253
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,952
- What?
- How much does a transplant cost?

254
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:44,458
Wait a minute.
How much does it cost?

255
00:22:45,135 --> 00:22:48,301
Transplant surgery,
doctors' fees, postoperative care,

256
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,013
immunosuppressant drugs...
you're looking at a minimum of $250,000.

257
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:56,851
If you opt for transplant surgery,
that is your choice,

258
00:22:56,981 --> 00:23:01,642
but the hospital maintains a very
strict policy with regard to cash patients.

259
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:06,106
We require down payment before we put
a patient's name on a receivers' list.

260
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,611
- How much?
- What kind of down payment?

261
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:12,112
30%... $75,000.

262
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:14,286
$75,000...

263
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:19,204
- To put my son's name on a list.
- Our son is upstairs dying.

264
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:23,880
- All you can do is talk about money?
- It costs money to provide health care.

265
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,505
It's expensive for you,
it's expensive for us.

266
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:29,759
You're going to
have to guarantee payment

267
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:32,131
before I can put
your son's name on the list.

268
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:37,346
Mr and Mrs Archibald,
please wait!

269
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:43,184
If you people don't want to treat our son,
we'll take him over to County Memorial.

270
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:45,809
- You don't want to do that.
- They have to treat him.

271
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:50,074
Heart transplantation is
always considered an elective procedure.

272
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:53,616
- You're in the right place.
- What are we supposed to do?

273
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:55,655
Talk to your insurance company again.

274
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:58,161
Check with our human resources
department for medical assistance.

275
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:01,827
There's money. There's Children's
State Services and Medicaid.

276
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:06,755
You find a way to keep him here.
You just don't take no for an answer.

277
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:11,592
Your policy has changed,
Mr Archibald.

278
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:14,344
Changed to what?

279
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:18,675
We've recently switched carriers
from a PPO to an HMO.

280
00:24:18,812 --> 00:24:23,308
It's a less expensive policy.
Unfortunately, there are some restrictions.

281
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:27,190
- What kind of restrictions?
- Here's how it works.

282
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,812
Non-management
part-time employees such as yourself

283
00:24:29,949 --> 00:24:33,780
only qualify for second-tier
catastrophic coverage.

284
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:36,995
I'm not part time, I'm full time.
It's just slow right now.

285
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:40,658
Sure, but your coverage
is based on hours worked.

286
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:43,498
Like I said,
you only qualify for second tier.

287
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:47,164
That has a maximum
payout limit of $20,000.

288
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:48,580
What?

289
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:53,502
You have been taking money
out of my cheque every week.

290
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,344
I've been paying into
this policy for years.

291
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:59,097
That's why we're going to cover you
for the full $20,000.

292
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:03,481
You're kidding me, right?
Come on.

293
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:09,937
You have dropped me from full time
to part time. You switched carriers.

294
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:15,446
Now you're telling me I'm not fully covered
even though I got a policy that says I am?

295
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:20,654
- It doesn't seem right, does it?
- No, it doesn't. My son is very sick.

296
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,116
If I'm not covered,
I got a serious problem.

297
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:26,586
I understand that,
but there's nothing I can do.

298
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:29,548
- You can file an appeal.
- Yeah?

299
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:33,672
Here you go. That takes
about seven working days.

300
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:51,316
Says here you already have
medical insurance.

301
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:54,401
- Not enough.
- What little we have is already used up.

302
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:56,065
You on welfare?

303
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,155
- You should be on welfare.
- We both have jobs.

304
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,749
That's too bad.

305
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,116
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

306
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:06,831
Try County Medical.

307
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:09,536
Yes, ma'am, I need to speak
to somebody in Financial Aid.

308
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:15,761
No, I don't want to hold.
I've been holding for 15 minutes.

309
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:21,017
We don't have enough money!
Should I get another job?

310
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:23,895
- I'm not yelling.
- You're yelling in here!

311
00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:32,522
Next, please.

312
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:41,659
- Wrong line. Window 15.
- What?

313
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:42,987
Window 15.

314
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:03,217
- No.
- No, what?

315
00:27:03,352 --> 00:27:05,096
No, you don't qualify.

316
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:08,646
My son is dying, I'm broke.
If I don't qualify, who the hell does?

317
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:10,104
I'm sorry.

318
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:12,725
I don't need you to be sorry!
I need you to help me!

319
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:39,846
No, this is an appeal.

320
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:45,552
An appeal is for an already existing claim.
You needed to file a grievance.

321
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:48,226
- You filed the wrong paperwork.
- Wait a minute.

322
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:50,893
You're going to have to resubmit.
It could take 30 days.

323
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:52,768
- I don't have 30 days.
- I know.

324
00:27:52,902 --> 00:27:57,647
I'm getting sick of the run-around.
I need my son's name on that list.

325
00:27:57,783 --> 00:28:00,569
Your account is in excess of $30,000.

326
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:03,454
The hospital has bent over backwards
to help you out.

327
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,250
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is right.

328
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:08,617
But there is a limit to our generosity.

329
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:12,037
Once and for all,
your insurance does not cover this.

330
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:33,016
Take it.

331
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,237
- Watch your step.
- This thing is frigging heavy.

332
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,196
Get out of the way.

333
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:46,330
Friends, one among us
is suffering in great pain today.

334
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,252
This is a good man.

335
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:35,663
"'You can't say
that you're not going to pitch. '

336
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:39,004
Bernie frowned,
puzzled by Babe's answer. 'Okay, Babe."'

337
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:43,921
Let us pray.

338
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:48,177
God of mercy, into his hands
Your son Jesus Christ

339
00:29:48,312 --> 00:29:50,932
commended his spirit
at his last hour.

340
00:29:51,064 --> 00:29:54,813
Into those same hands,
we commend Your servant...

341
00:29:58,782 --> 00:30:03,076
You should try that news guy
does all them special investigative reports.

342
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:05,739
You know the one,
the guy with the frigging hair?

343
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,658
- Pretty boy. What's his frigging name?
- Lampley.

344
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,658
- Tuck Lampley.
- I'll give you $20 for the TV.

345
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,465
- It's a colour TV.
- $20.

346
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:20,969
Call him up, Jimmy.

347
00:30:21,095 --> 00:30:24,096
You don't mind if we walk and talk.
I'm up to here today.

348
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:26,678
- Not at all.
- What can I do you for?

349
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:32,147
My son Mike, he fell into heart failure
at this Little League game.

350
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:36,437
I got full insurance from the job.
Now they're telling me they won't pay.

351
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,645
What about the hospital?
Don't they have to cover it?

352
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:42,065
- That's what I was saying.
- They're telling me I got to pay cash.

353
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:44,950
Otherwise I got to take my son home
and watch him die.

354
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,866
We was thinking you can do
one of them special interest pieces.

355
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:50,955
Send donations,
write your congressman.

356
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,918
Anything you can do,
Mr Lampley, would help.

357
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:57,667
I think what's happening to your son
is outrageous. I want to help.

358
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,753
I got to run this by my producers.
I got bosses like everybody else.

359
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:04,087
- Right.
- Leave your number with Karen up front.

360
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:08,464
Thank you very much.

361
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:24,025
Give me $100.

362
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,195
Come on, it's a diamond ring.

363
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,992
All right, $90.
Give me $90, then.

364
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,329
He's going to die.

365
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:16,376
- What?
- They're releasing him.

366
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:21,080
- Who?
- Dr Turner just left here.

367
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:24,964
They are releasing Mike this morning.

368
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:28,298
They're not going to send him home.
I gave them money yesterday.

369
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:32,642
It doesn't matter. Listen to me.
They are releasing him.

370
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:35,686
I talked to the hospital.
They said... I'll take care of it.

371
00:32:35,814 --> 00:32:40,558
You always take care of everything,
but it's never enough, is it?

372
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:43,610
You need to do something,
do you hear me?

373
00:32:43,736 --> 00:32:45,362
Do something!

374
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:34,276
You're doing great. You really are.
You've gained what, five pounds?

375
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:38,741
You're the only patient I have
who eats the food in this place.

376
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:42,661
Doc, let me ask you something.
How long before I'm able to play tennis?

377
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,210
You couldn't play before you had
a new heart. Take up knitting.

378
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:49,669
- I play tennis.
- We don't care.

379
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:52,130
Would you please
get back to work? Thank you.

380
00:33:52,265 --> 00:33:54,673
Heidi, make an appointment
for us to have dinner next week.

381
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:56,008
I'm going to cook.

382
00:33:56,144 --> 00:33:59,512
No, and you're not wearing lingerie
around him the next month.

383
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:03,515
You're not in his will. He told me.
Don't push your luck.

384
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:06,735
I gave the hospital $6,000 yesterday.

385
00:34:09,032 --> 00:34:11,653
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes, sure.

386
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:19,657
- Take care of him.
- Take care. Thank you.

387
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:28,463
My wife Denise says you're going to
send Michael home. Is that true?

388
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:31,713
I'm a physician.
I don't make policy decisions.

389
00:34:31,848 --> 00:34:35,513
- That's handled by the board of trustees.
- You're the head of cardiac surgery.

390
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:38,312
You make a recommendation,
they're going to listen, aren't they?

391
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:42,517
I make recommendations all the time.
The final decision rests with the board.

392
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,185
- That's it? Send him home.
- I'm afraid so.

393
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:51,776
Can we take a little walk?
It won't take long, I promise you.

394
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,154
Fine.

395
00:34:54,787 --> 00:34:57,906
I'm looking at the brochure last night.

396
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:02,668
It says this hospital
does over 300 heart surgeries a year.

397
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:05,666
300 surgeries, $250,000 a pop.

398
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:08,124
You know how much that is?
I did the math.

399
00:35:08,259 --> 00:35:10,928
That's $75 million worth
of heart surgeries.

400
00:35:11,053 --> 00:35:14,387
You're telling me
you can't do one for me in good faith?

401
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:17,302
I waived my fee in your son's case.
I know you're not asking...

402
00:35:17,436 --> 00:35:20,768
Nobody asked you to waive the fee.
I can raise the money.

403
00:35:20,897 --> 00:35:25,642
I already came up with $22,000,
and I swear to God on my life

404
00:35:25,777 --> 00:35:28,564
I will pay for this
if you give me the opportunity.

405
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:32,646
I'm only getting 20 hours on the job.
I can do this. I can pay.

406
00:35:32,784 --> 00:35:35,405
I swear to God,
I'll pay you the money back.

407
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:38,787
I don't know how,
but I promise you I will. Trust me.

408
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:42,747
I give you my word
as a man. Please.

409
00:35:44,837 --> 00:35:47,376
Could you take your hands
off me, please?

410
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:52,672
- I've done everything I can. I'm sorry.
- No, you haven't.

411
00:35:52,803 --> 00:35:56,387
- Yes.
- Let's go inside and talk about it.

412
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:03,726
I'm not asking anymore, Doctor.
I'm telling you.

413
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:07,225
You are going to give my son
a new heart, you understand me?

414
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,661
Don't move.

415
00:36:28,923 --> 00:36:31,499
Don't even think about it.

416
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:33,843
Put your hands down.

417
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:36,679
- Mr Archibald, I...
- Shut up.

418
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:39,843
I know how upset you are,
but this is not the way to handle it.

419
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:42,598
You can't go through this way.

420
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:44,187
Put your hands up.

421
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:46,686
- Put them up.
- Oh, God.

422
00:36:47,818 --> 00:36:49,940
- Give me your gun.
- I don't have a gun.

423
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,109
They don't have guns.
They're not armed.

424
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,939
All right. Put your hands down.
Sit down. No, get up.

425
00:36:56,076 --> 00:36:58,827
- You fail to realise the jeopardy...
- Get over here. Shut up!

426
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:01,954
- We have got to talk about this.
- Shut up. Don't move.

427
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:05,166
John, wait.
Just stop. Stop!

428
00:37:06,795 --> 00:37:10,165
If you do this, you're on
an irreversible course of action.

429
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:12,670
Put on the brakes
and think about this.

430
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,422
- We really need to talk.
- Mr Archibald, I hope...

431
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:17,131
- Back up, please.
- What?

432
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:19,220
- Do as he says.
- Would you please back up?

433
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,266
- What are you doing?
- I'm not taking no for an answer.

434
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:25,181
- Back up.
- That guy's got a gun!

435
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,096
Stay right there.

436
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:36,647
What are you doing?
Get back over there.

437
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:40,912
Sit on your hands over there!
Get over there!

438
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:45,249
Turner, everybody, get down!
Sit on your hands!

439
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:48,745
Put your hands under your butt!
Don't anybody move.

440
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:56,462
What are you doing?

441
00:37:57,095 --> 00:38:00,345
I'm bleeding. Trying to get
my goddamned finger sewn back on.

442
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:05,520
Mr Archibald, these people
have nothing to do with this.

443
00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:07,686
Let them go.
They need treatment.

444
00:38:07,815 --> 00:38:11,480
This is a hospital. You're a doctor.
Why don't you treat them? Start with him.

445
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:16,651
What's the matter, Doctor?
You want to see his insurance card first?

446
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:20,320
- I'll do it.
- Okay, you do it.

447
00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:22,943
Wait a minute.
I got a pregnant wife here.

448
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,750
Listen, all right, wait.
Listen, everybody.

449
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:34,458
The hospital's
under new management now.

450
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,963
From now on, free health care
for everybody. How's that?

451
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:41,674
Righteous, man.

452
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:44,681
Don't have to squeeze it like...
You crazy?

453
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:46,768
- What's your name?
- Max.

454
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:49,053
You and Dr Turner come with me.

455
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,643
- You got keys for that elevator?
- Yeah.

456
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:54,851
I want you to kill the power.
Turn it off.

457
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,630
- Keep an eye on him, Max.
- You got to sit still.

458
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:21,758
- I can't do this with you moving around.
- You remind me of Doogie Howser.

459
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:26,684
- We were here before the black guy.
- Everybody's going to get their turn.

460
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:29,348
We're not going anywhere
for a while, so just sit tight.

461
00:39:30,396 --> 00:39:32,354
Just relax, okay?

462
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:49,290
- Is this Hope Memorial Hospital?
- Yeah, emergency room.

463
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:52,286
Could you give me directions?
I need to get over there.

464
00:39:52,419 --> 00:39:53,830
No, ma'am.

465
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:58,126
We're closed for repairs right now.
You're going to have to call...

466
00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:03,680
- This is an emergency!
- Have you tried Mount Angel?

467
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:07,506
No. That's too far.
My husband usually drives.

468
00:40:07,642 --> 00:40:12,104
- I'm going to need directions.
- Which way are you coming from?

469
00:40:12,814 --> 00:40:16,314
Go down Flower, make a right turn,
go all the way to the end, make a left.

470
00:40:16,443 --> 00:40:19,065
- You understand?
- I'm asking you to do something.

471
00:40:19,198 --> 00:40:21,486
You're welcome.
Miss, come from under there.

472
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:27,110
Come from out of there.
Come on out.

473
00:40:27,246 --> 00:40:29,155
What? No, what?

474
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,619
Go sit over there.

475
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:35,747
Unbelievable.
This place is a joke.

476
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:39,664
Good thing I'm not cut.
I'd bleed to death in this joint, am I right?

477
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,588
Excuse me, brother man!

478
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,007
No. You need to do something,
Steve, all right?

479
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,848
You need to get your butt up!

480
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:50,763
- I want you to do something.
- Would you please sit down?

481
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:53,647
- I don't want to sit down!
- What is wrong with you?

482
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:54,770
Wait a minute.

483
00:40:56,693 --> 00:40:59,185
Relax. Don't have the baby yet.
When is it due?

484
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:02,157
- Any minute.
- Don't have it.

485
00:41:02,282 --> 00:41:04,405
- I'm having it.
- Not yet. Hang on.

486
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:07,452
- Brother.
- She's having a baby. Hang on a second.

487
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:11,528
- Excuse me, brother man.
- The woman's having a baby!

488
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:14,336
- When is she going to see a doctor?
- Sit down!

489
00:41:15,964 --> 00:41:17,671
- That's cool.
- Dr Klein!

490
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:21,582
- I'll be there in a minute.
- You and me, we got no problems.

491
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:23,795
That's right.
Just stay in your seat.

492
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:31,598
I don't understand
what you're saying, ma'am.

493
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:38,731
The ear? Ear infection?
Can you help her with the ear infection?

494
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:42,526
- Me? I can't.
- Why not?

495
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:45,407
I don't know anything.
It's my first day.

496
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:59,252
Everybody, in the other room.
Everybody, in the other room right now.

497
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:03,716
They're going to take
great care of you, I promise.

498
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,632
- What? Open up!
- It's dropping.

499
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:11,851
We've got a gunshot victim out here.
He's lost a lot of blood.

500
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,055
- Go to another hospital.
- Let's go. Open the door.

501
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:20,191
You know these guys?
You sure?

502
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,725
- They're here all the time.
- Open the door.

503
00:42:26,032 --> 00:42:27,990
- Take your jacket off.
- What?

504
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,536
Open it up. Take it off.

505
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:37,832
Put it on the ground. Walk away.
Just leave him right there. Go!

506
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:40,745
Just go.

507
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:46,757
- What's wrong with him?
- He got shot.

508
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:54,727
All right, come on.

509
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:08,656
Wait a minute.
I want to see what's in that bag.

510
00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:10,742
What happened to you, buddy?

511
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:17,490
I gave them all the money in the register.
They shot me anyway.

512
00:43:17,627 --> 00:43:20,580
Jesus Christ.
He needs to go into surgery right now.

513
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:22,669
Can I take him to Trauma One?

514
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:24,707
- Thanks.
- What do we got?

515
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:27,678
- Gunshot wound to the belly.
- Anything from the EMTs?

516
00:43:27,803 --> 00:43:30,295
No. Dr Turner,
we're going to need your hand.

517
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,263
- I just bought this suit.
- Can you give me a hand?

518
00:43:34,393 --> 00:43:38,058
On three, two, one, lift.
Thank you.

519
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:41,891
I can't handle a gut shot.

520
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:44,696
I'm a cardiac surgeon,
not an emergency room physician.

521
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,272
It's like riding a bike, Doctor.
Just pretend you're getting paid.

522
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:52,025
- This is apples and oranges. I can't.
- The man is dying. Help him.

523
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,368
- I'd like to. I haven't done this...
- Do it!

524
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:59,411
75 milligrams Demerol I.V.,
lidocaine 2% local.

525
00:43:59,543 --> 00:44:01,500
I'll scrub now.

526
00:44:02,629 --> 00:44:05,667
When I get out of here, I'm suing
this hospital and your security company.

527
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,876
What makes you so sure
you're getting out at all?

528
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:20,308
Right behind you!

529
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,017
Here we go.

530
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:38,657
You've got to stand
behind the line, sir.

531
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:42,325
Move this out of here for me, please?
Thank you very much.

532
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:45,499
- Lieutenant, we got a real problem here.
- What's that?

533
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:48,798
This guy's in for the long haul...
locked down the E.R.,

534
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:51,678
barricaded himself in,
killed power in the elevators.

535
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:55,008
We can bust down the door, but this
son of a bitch might start killing people.

536
00:44:55,142 --> 00:44:57,714
There's two pinpoint cameras
hidden in the E.R.

537
00:44:57,851 --> 00:45:00,806
- The hospital's own surveillance.
- We got a video tap being set up.

538
00:45:00,939 --> 00:45:04,189
- Are you in charge of security?
- No, that would be Wally Pitoniak.

539
00:45:04,317 --> 00:45:08,397
- He's at home. It's his day off.
- Not anymore, it ain't. Get him here.

540
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:12,993
All right,
can you get me a secure line?

541
00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:16,284
We've got one of our guys inside.
He's got a walkie-talkie.

542
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,037
You might want to try this.

543
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:20,656
Put a clamp on all phone lines
to the emergency room.

544
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:23,579
If this guy picks up the phone,
I want him talking to me.

545
00:45:23,712 --> 00:45:26,629
- Done.
- Who's in charge here?

546
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:29,674
Rebecca Payne, sir.
It's her day off, too.

547
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,672
Jesus Christ, does anybody
work at this hospital?

548
00:45:32,804 --> 00:45:35,259
- It's Saturday, sir.
- So what?

549
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,845
People get sick
on Saturday, don't they?

550
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:45,392
Señor, no cry.

551
00:45:49,905 --> 00:45:53,071
Mr Archibald, I need to do
an internal examination on her.

552
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:55,654
- Where you going to take her?
- Examination room there.

553
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:56,816
Good. Go.

554
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:09,048
- Just remember, it ain't your fault.
- Excuse me.

555
00:46:09,173 --> 00:46:11,664
I think my fiancée
might have broken her arm.

556
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:14,472
I was wondering if we could
get somebody to look at her.

557
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:17,549
- Sure. What happened?
- A drunk ran a red light...

558
00:46:17,683 --> 00:46:20,885
Ran a red light.
He slammed into us. Right?

559
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:24,554
- It was an accident.
- Yes, it was.

560
00:46:24,689 --> 00:46:29,103
This is the police depantment.
I'm speaking to the man in charge.

561
00:46:29,236 --> 00:46:32,190
Please pick up the walkie-talkie.

562
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:35,323
The building is surrounded.
There's no way in or out.

563
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,940
If you hear me.
I advise you to respond.

564
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:43,246
Hello. Is anyone there?

565
00:46:45,877 --> 00:46:49,328
This is Lieutenant Frank Grimes
of the Chicago Police Department.

566
00:46:49,465 --> 00:46:51,587
Are you the man in charge?

567
00:46:53,802 --> 00:46:56,968
- That's right.
- Who am I speaking to?

568
00:46:58,807 --> 00:46:59,969
John...

569
00:47:01,812 --> 00:47:02,891
Q.

570
00:47:04,815 --> 00:47:06,808
All right, John Q.

571
00:47:06,942 --> 00:47:10,775
Again, I'm Lieutenant Grimes,
but I want you to call me Frank.

572
00:47:10,905 --> 00:47:12,944
- Can you do that?
- Sure, Frank.

573
00:47:13,073 --> 00:47:16,572
I'll be the hostage negotiator.
I've been a cop for 35 years.

574
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:19,868
This is all I do.
I don't play games. I don't fool around.

575
00:47:19,997 --> 00:47:23,081
If I say something,
you can take it to the bank.

576
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:27,420
Let's get down to it.
Is anybody hurt?

577
00:47:27,546 --> 00:47:29,670
It's an emergency room.
Everybody's hurt.

578
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:30,878
Right.

579
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:32,632
- They're fine.
- Good.

580
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,046
As long as it stays that way,
we can keep talking.

581
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,674
What is it you want?

582
00:47:37,806 --> 00:47:42,552
Find Rebecca Payne, Hope Memorial's
Administrative Supervisor.

583
00:47:42,686 --> 00:47:47,894
You find her. Tell her I want
my kid's name on the donors' list.

584
00:47:50,153 --> 00:47:52,856
- Kid boy or girl?
- A boy.

585
00:47:52,988 --> 00:47:57,449
I got two boys myself.
Two girls and two boys.

586
00:47:59,536 --> 00:48:01,660
Don't handle me.
I don't want to be handled.

587
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:04,077
It insults my intelligence
as a human being!

588
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:07,494
Take it easy. The idea is
not to get too excited, all right?

589
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:10,299
I'm going to take it
any way I can get it, understand?

590
00:48:10,423 --> 00:48:16,092
If I don't get it, there's going to be
some dead bodies on your hands in here.

591
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:20,134
I hear you loud and clear. I'm going to
jot that down. Rebecca Payne, right?

592
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,890
All right.

593
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,181
There's a lot of cops
out here, John.

594
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:28,474
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

595
00:48:28,608 --> 00:48:30,067
I'm sure.

596
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:34,853
All right, sit tight.
You're in a tough spot, a lot of trouble.

597
00:48:34,989 --> 00:48:37,230
If you work with me,
if you're reasonable,

598
00:48:37,366 --> 00:48:39,489
we'll figure a way
out of this, okay?

599
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:41,741
We have to have a little faith
in one another.

600
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:44,287
- Why is that, Frank?
- Why?

601
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:50,623
Because that's what faith's all about...
believing when you don't want to believe.

602
00:48:50,754 --> 00:48:53,126
Besides, what else
are you going to do?

603
00:48:55,676 --> 00:48:57,633
- I want my epidural.
- Too late for that.

604
00:48:57,761 --> 00:49:01,890
- Something for the pain.
- Out! She'll be fine.

605
00:49:11,942 --> 00:49:14,433
- First child?
- Yeah.

606
00:49:16,488 --> 00:49:18,647
Just kind of nervous.
You know how it is.

607
00:49:18,782 --> 00:49:22,115
I was, too. What do you want,
a boy or a girl?

608
00:49:22,245 --> 00:49:26,159
Doesn't matter to me, man,
as long as my kid's healthy.

609
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:27,750
That's all I want.

610
00:49:31,796 --> 00:49:34,251
Listen, I didn't mean
anything by that.

611
00:49:42,223 --> 00:49:45,806
Who was driving?
The car... who was driving?

612
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:49,932
I was. What's that
got to do with anything?

613
00:49:50,064 --> 00:49:51,973
Why is your girl
all banged up and you're not?

614
00:49:55,736 --> 00:49:57,397
What do you call this?

615
00:49:58,822 --> 00:50:01,658
- What are you laughing at?
- Somebody get this fool a Band-Aid.

616
00:50:01,785 --> 00:50:06,493
- I don't want you to bleed to death.
- Screw you. That shit hurts.

617
00:50:07,456 --> 00:50:11,703
- His air bag went off and mine didn't.
- What kind of car you drive?

618
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:14,753
- Mercedes 500.
- You drive a Mercedes 500?

619
00:50:15,673 --> 00:50:20,086
- What year?
- 1986. It's a classic.

620
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:25,182
Mercedes didn't make
passenger-side air bags till 1988.

621
00:50:27,435 --> 00:50:29,842
- Busted.
- What's your point, John?

622
00:50:29,979 --> 00:50:33,562
- What's yours, Mitch?
- You from the Slap-a-Ho tribe.

623
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,356
You like to beat on that young lady,
and everybody here knows it.

624
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:43,950
I was drunk, all right?

625
00:50:55,671 --> 00:51:00,050
- Don't smoke in here, Mitch.
- Give me a break. Work with me here.

626
00:51:00,177 --> 00:51:04,922
- I'm trying my best.
- Mr Q, could I get some water?

627
00:51:05,057 --> 00:51:08,888
- I need to tinkle.
- I got missed-meal cramps.

628
00:51:09,018 --> 00:51:11,805
I'm hungry. Let's get a bucket
of chicken or something.

629
00:51:11,937 --> 00:51:13,182
In a minute.

630
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:16,898
- How's it going in there?
- He's going to make it.

631
00:51:17,027 --> 00:51:20,478
You have any idea how much blood
this guy lost? It's incredible.

632
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:22,607
He saved this man's life.

633
00:51:36,337 --> 00:51:38,331
- What's that?
- Lasix.

634
00:51:38,464 --> 00:51:41,632
It's a diuretic to help get rid
of some of the fluid build-up.

635
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,879
It's potassium-depleting,
so he needs this one to supplement.

636
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:47,003
And those?

637
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:51,054
Dopamine for his blood pressure,
Dig for his heart, Primacor.

638
00:51:52,686 --> 00:51:55,807
- It seems like so much.
- Yeah, it's a lot.

639
00:51:55,941 --> 00:51:58,514
- This is antibiotic.
- What for?

640
00:51:58,652 --> 00:52:01,225
It's prophylactic, just in case.

641
00:52:04,407 --> 00:52:06,649
- And those?
- These two?

642
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:11,826
- They're for pain.
- I don't feel so good.

643
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:15,291
This is going to make you feel yucky
for a few minutes, buddy.

644
00:52:15,419 --> 00:52:18,585
I'm going to get you some of those
crunchy ice chips you want.

645
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:20,089
How does that sound?

646
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:25,677
Mike, by the way, there was this guy,
he stopped by to see you.

647
00:52:25,803 --> 00:52:30,264
He said he was a friend of yours.
I got him right here.

648
00:52:30,391 --> 00:52:33,808
I didn't know if I should let him in.
What do you think?

649
00:52:33,938 --> 00:52:35,561
- He's okay.
- He's okay?

650
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,646
Said he wanted
to hang out with you.

651
00:52:37,774 --> 00:52:39,103
He's okay.

652
00:52:39,234 --> 00:52:40,349
That's great.

653
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:44,071
Thank you.

654
00:53:00,505 --> 00:53:02,663
Oh, my baby!

655
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:05,372
Let me hold my baby!

656
00:53:08,806 --> 00:53:14,926
- Mom? Is Dad coming?
- Yeah, he's coming.

657
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:18,895
When? Where is he?

658
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,774
I don't know, but he's coming.

659
00:53:33,873 --> 00:53:35,534
What are you up to?

660
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:38,669
Never mind me. You're worthless.
Some security guard.

661
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:41,666
You should have zapped the bastard
when you had the chance.

662
00:53:41,797 --> 00:53:47,041
With what? Besides, I'm not sticking
my neck on the line for $8.50 an hour.

663
00:53:56,813 --> 00:53:58,521
- Pay dirt.
- Are you nuts?

664
00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:01,932
- What the hell are you doing?
- Looking out for number one.

665
00:54:02,068 --> 00:54:05,734
You want to stay alive, sit tight
and wait for the cavalry to get here.

666
00:54:05,864 --> 00:54:09,648
The cops are coming in shooting.
They don't care about his kid.

667
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:14,327
Once he realises that,
we're all history.

668
00:54:14,456 --> 00:54:18,833
If he catches you with that scalpel,
you're the one that's history, asshole.

669
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,874
He don't look so bad to me.
"Ethyl chloride." Just like mace.

670
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,339
Put that stuff back
before you get us in trouble.

671
00:54:26,468 --> 00:54:29,553
You listen, you stupid rent-a-cop.
I am not a slob.

672
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:32,883
I have a life.
It means something to me.

673
00:54:33,016 --> 00:54:36,135
I'm not going down
in this shit-hole. No, sir.

674
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,644
Back it up.

675
00:54:44,737 --> 00:54:47,025
How are you?
How you all doing?

676
00:54:47,155 --> 00:54:50,987
Good. How are you?
How are you, fellows?

677
00:54:51,118 --> 00:54:53,739
Is it true the man inside
wants an operation for his son?

678
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:56,658
Everything good?
Good to see you.

679
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,493
- Do you know what weapon he has?
- You'll talk to me, right?

680
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:02,460
I'll let you know when I know, okay?
You'll be the first.

681
00:55:04,173 --> 00:55:06,545
- I'll let you know later.
- Gus, how are you?

682
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:09,629
- How you doing, Frank? It's hot.
- Yeah, it is.

683
00:55:09,761 --> 00:55:13,759
- A little early for heavy artillery, isn't it?
- Maybe. Maybe not.

684
00:55:13,889 --> 00:55:16,642
- You should tell me. What's going on?
- You're looking at it.

685
00:55:16,768 --> 00:55:21,229
A very upset father inside. We'll give him
a couple of minutes to cool off.

686
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:29,655
Let's not give him too much time.
Let's end this quick and quiet.

687
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:32,069
- That's the plan.
- All right. Good.

688
00:55:32,201 --> 00:55:35,652
In that case, I'm just here
to lend my support in any way that I can.

689
00:55:35,787 --> 00:55:38,658
I don't need a babysitter on this.
It's under control.

690
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:39,953
- Is it?
- Yes.

691
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:43,951
All right. Can't have people
running around the street using guns.

692
00:55:44,755 --> 00:55:46,830
Makes it look like the city's unsafe.

693
00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:49,543
Besides, I got to be here.

694
00:55:49,676 --> 00:55:52,215
Chief doesn't show up,
looks like he's asleep at the wheel.

695
00:55:52,345 --> 00:55:55,180
Just stay out of my way.
The TV cameras are over there.

696
00:55:55,307 --> 00:55:58,059
They should make you feel
right at home.

697
00:55:58,185 --> 00:56:00,758
Right. Why don't you just relax?

698
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:05,185
- Why can't you relax?
- I'm fine.

699
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:07,891
- Why don't you just do your job?
- I'm doing my job.

700
00:56:08,028 --> 00:56:10,780
We're both cops, right?
We're on the same side, remember?

701
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:12,697
- Right.
- Right?

702
00:56:14,118 --> 00:56:16,276
It's good to see you. Thanks.

703
00:56:18,414 --> 00:56:20,870
Yes, Mr Mayor.
I'll see you in a little bit.

704
00:56:20,999 --> 00:56:23,372
No, we got it. I got it.

705
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:25,492
How are you?

706
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:28,417
The old man, looking for his Depends.
He leave them over here?

707
00:56:39,962 --> 00:56:42,884
What I don't understand is why
they never found it, the doctors.

708
00:56:43,092 --> 00:56:46,848
My son has had clean checkups
every year since the day he was born.

709
00:56:47,056 --> 00:56:51,017
- How could the doctors not pick it up?
- He might not have been tested enough.

710
00:56:51,225 --> 00:56:52,270
Why not?

711
00:56:55,815 --> 00:56:57,170
You got an HMO, right?

712
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,883
There's your answer.

713
00:56:59,988 --> 00:57:05,308
HMOs pay their doctors not to test.
It's their way of keeping costs down.

714
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:09,061
Say Mike did need additional testing
and insurance says they won't cover them.

715
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,564
The doctor keeps his mouth shut,
and come Christmas,

716
00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:15,525
the HMO sends the doctor
a fat-ass bonus cheque.

717
00:57:15,629 --> 00:57:20,221
- Is that true?
- Possible. Not likely, but possible.

718
00:57:20,326 --> 00:57:23,035
These doctors may have known
what was wrong with my son,

719
00:57:23,243 --> 00:57:25,434
and they could have
treated him all along?

720
00:57:25,644 --> 00:57:30,127
- Who knows? I don't know.
- Don't take this personal, Doc.

721
00:57:30,232 --> 00:57:33,049
- You're a bunch of crooks.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

722
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:36,384
- What about that thing you take?
- The thing?

723
00:57:36,488 --> 00:57:37,844
That promise.

724
00:57:37,948 --> 00:57:41,599
- It's called the Hippocratic Oath.
- More like the hypocritical oath.

725
00:57:41,703 --> 00:57:43,686
How's it go, Doc?

726
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:47,022
"I solemnly swear to take care
of the sick and damn-near-dying,

727
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:48,900
unless they ain't got major medical."

728
00:57:49,108 --> 00:57:51,194
- Something like that?
- You've got it perfectly.

729
00:57:51,404 --> 00:57:55,888
It's funny, but it's not far from the truth.
This shit happens all the time.

730
00:57:55,992 --> 00:57:57,868
Paramedics bring in
some accident victim.

731
00:57:57,972 --> 00:58:01,624
When the boys in Accounting find out
they can't pay, they send them packing.

732
00:58:01,832 --> 00:58:04,543
- Hospitals can't turn people away.
- Isn't there laws against that?

733
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:08,297
There's also ways around those laws.
We have to stabilise them.

734
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,593
After that, we're off the hook.

735
00:58:10,698 --> 00:58:13,410
- That's not how it works.
- That's exactly how it works.

736
00:58:13,514 --> 00:58:16,851
Maybe not on the fifth floor,
but in here if you don't have money,

737
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,980
you get a Band-Aid, a foot in the ass,
and you're out the door.

738
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:24,359
Enough already. I've heard all the bitching
and moaning I can stand for one day.

739
00:58:24,464 --> 00:58:28,532
If you all want to regard me as some kind
of blood-sucking vampire, great.

740
00:58:28,635 --> 00:58:32,911
I'll be the bad guy.
But who's holding the fucking gun?

741
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:43,861
Sir? Lieutenant!

742
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:54,812
This is Frank Grimes.
You pick up the phone, you get me.

743
00:58:54,917 --> 00:58:58,881
- What can I do for you?
- What's going on with the list?

744
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:02,844
- I'm working on it, but I need time.
- Time I don't have.

745
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:06,596
- Let's talk about the hostages.
- What do you want to know?

746
00:59:06,805 --> 00:59:10,664
- What's going on? How are they?
- They're fine. They're full.

747
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:14,837
We're eating candy bars
and discussing HMOs, waiting for you.

748
00:59:15,045 --> 00:59:17,860
- I want you to let some of them go.
- For what?

749
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,574
I do for you, you do for me.
Show some good faith.

750
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:22,659
A lot of nervous people out here.

751
00:59:22,868 --> 00:59:26,306
Make everybody breathe a lot easier
if we saw some happy faces.

752
00:59:26,411 --> 00:59:30,793
I'll do for you when you start doing for me.
I want my kid's name on that list.

753
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:33,817
- I'm not kidding around here.
- Good faith.

754
00:59:33,922 --> 00:59:36,740
- Good faith only takes you so far...
- What's that?

755
00:59:36,842 --> 00:59:40,074
...merit system. So far,
you haven't earned any points.

756
00:59:40,178 --> 00:59:42,264
Excuse me.
I need to talk to you.

757
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:45,081
This woman is six centimetres dilated.
The baby is breeched.

758
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,939
I've medicated her, but we have to
move her up to Maternity immediately.

759
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:51,964
- Hang on, Frank.
- Right down here.

760
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:56,136
- What the hell is going on?
- Do you know this man?

761
00:59:59,577 --> 01:00:01,873
His name is John Archibald.
He has a son here in ICU.

762
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,107
Put people on the door.
Find the mother. I need to talk to her.

763
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,399
- Are you there, Frank?
- I'm here, John.

764
01:00:07,609 --> 01:00:11,987
I changed my mind, all right?
I'm going to let some of the hostages go.

765
01:00:12,093 --> 01:00:13,761
That's the right thing.

766
01:00:13,968 --> 01:00:17,203
But when I do,
the clock starts, you understand?

767
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:23,355
It's 4:15. You got one hour.
You got till 5:15, you understand?

768
01:00:23,565 --> 01:00:27,110
If my boy's not on that list by 5:15,
somebody in here is going to die.

769
01:00:27,214 --> 01:00:29,511
- Don't be stupid.
- 5:15, Frank!

770
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:34,097
- 5-1-5, something happens for me!
- Got it.

771
01:00:34,202 --> 01:00:36,392
You're a cop. Call the coroner.

772
01:00:37,748 --> 01:00:41,400
This is bad, Frank.
This has just got to go away.

773
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:46,508
All right, Miriam...

774
01:00:50,055 --> 01:00:52,871
And Rosa. Vamos.  Let's go.

775
01:00:52,974 --> 01:00:56,937
Mr Archibald,
please let my husband come with me.

776
01:00:57,043 --> 01:00:59,752
I need you to get out of here.
I will be okay. Just go.

777
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:03,301
- Shit, I'll go. I'm free.
- Steve, baby, no, please.

778
01:01:03,508 --> 01:01:06,324
- What kind of man are you?
- Screw you, Tyrone.

779
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:08,515
What? Screw me, Tyrone?

780
01:01:08,723 --> 01:01:12,062
Wait a second.
Wait a minute. Just relax.

781
01:01:16,545 --> 01:01:18,005
That's right, tough guy.

782
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:27,182
Julie, baby.
Get the gun! Come on!

783
01:01:27,286 --> 01:01:29,269
Go over there
and pick up that gun.

784
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:33,543
Shoot him! Shoot him
right in the face, Julie!

785
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:37,197
Get up! Get the gun!
There you go, baby.

786
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,261
What are you... are you crazy?
What are you doing?

787
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:42,410
Come on now!

788
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,205
Max, you got cuffs?

789
01:01:47,312 --> 01:01:49,188
Oh, God!

790
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:55,028
You stupid bitch!

791
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:57,846
That's for beating the shit out of me!

792
01:02:00,034 --> 01:02:03,372
And that's for being an asshole!

793
01:02:08,065 --> 01:02:11,716
And this,
this is for calling me a bitch!

794
01:02:13,592 --> 01:02:15,052
I felt that one.

795
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:18,910
And I'm not going to be
your Barbie anymore!

796
01:02:19,954 --> 01:02:24,647
Goddamn! All that ass
and muscles to go with it.

797
01:02:24,752 --> 01:02:27,984
- I knew damn well you wasn't no blonde.
- Give them to me.

798
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,530
Mitch! Look at me!

799
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,311
Come here.

800
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,180
Let's go, both of you.

801
01:02:53,744 --> 01:02:57,708
Whatever happens, I want you to know
everything's going to be okay.

802
01:02:57,813 --> 01:02:59,794
- You understand me?
- Yes.

803
01:02:59,898 --> 01:03:04,070
Don't worry.
Don't worry about anything.

804
01:03:04,175 --> 01:03:06,676
I'll always be there for you, baby.

805
01:03:09,595 --> 01:03:11,059
Don't shoot!

806
01:03:15,228 --> 01:03:18,672
I'm letting some hostages go!
Don't shoot!

807
01:03:20,235 --> 01:03:23,781
All right, Steve. You, too.
Let's go, both of you.

808
01:03:25,032 --> 01:03:28,891
- Thank you.
- Muchas gracias. Señor.

809
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:31,291
- Thank you, Mr Archibald.
- You, too.

810
01:03:33,062 --> 01:03:34,522
Take care of his ear.

811
01:03:34,627 --> 01:03:37,339
The gunman has just freed
several hostages.

812
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,988
who will immediately be debriefed
by members of the crisis team.

813
01:03:41,093 --> 01:03:44,536
Will the man known as John Q
get a heant for his little boy?

814
01:03:44,641 --> 01:03:45,995
Only time will tell.

815
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:48,705
From Hope Memorial Hospital.
I'm Tuck Lampley.

816
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:52,982
Is it true an ambulance dropped off
a victim after the gunman took over?

817
01:03:53,191 --> 01:03:55,486
He unlocked the door
and he let him inside!

818
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:58,301
- Can you comment?
- The man was critically injured.

819
01:03:58,406 --> 01:04:00,595
If he hadn't let him in,
he would have died.

820
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:05,706
- Ma'am, are you all right?
- I feel good. We're having a baby!

821
01:04:05,914 --> 01:04:08,105
Ma'am, any comments
about the gunman?

822
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:11,441
- John Q very good man.
- The gunman?

823
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:12,901
Very good man!

824
01:04:23,435 --> 01:04:26,043
They got a camera.
They're watching a video feed.

825
01:04:26,148 --> 01:04:28,338
- How do you know?
- They're looking at something.

826
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:33,135
- I want to know what. Can you get it?
- Boss, if they got it, I can get it.

827
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:36,264
You give in, there's going to be guns
in every hospital in the country.

828
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:39,287
You think Mr Archibald's
the only one who has a sick child?

829
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:42,521
Have you checked the HIV ward?
There's a whole floor full.

830
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:45,650
People get sick. They die.
That's the way it goes.

831
01:04:45,753 --> 01:04:47,945
I'm faced with
decisions like this every day.

832
01:04:48,049 --> 01:04:52,429
There's a man threatening innocent people
because you refused to help his son.

833
01:04:52,637 --> 01:04:56,913
There are 50 million people in this country
without medical insurance.

834
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,937
If you'd like to change it,
call your congressman.

835
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:04,525
Excuse me. Why don't we just tell him
his son's name's on the list?

836
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:09,115
Doesn't that make sense?
How's he going to know, anyway?

837
01:05:11,095 --> 01:05:14,019
Sir? Pardon me.
Can you come take a look at this?

838
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:21,526
Sarge, Chief Moroe,
this is Wally Pitoniak, head of security.

839
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:23,820
Nice to meet you.
I got your spot.

840
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:28,724
Here's your sight.
That's going to be your perch.

841
01:05:28,826 --> 01:05:31,014
The X there, that's your phone.

842
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:34,772
- Which phone?
- Bring it up, Jeff.

843
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:39,257
The phone right there.

844
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:46,452
It is. Tom. But Chief Moroe maintains
the police will do whatever is necessary

845
01:05:46,557 --> 01:05:49,268
to preserve the lives
and safety of these hostages.

846
01:05:49,372 --> 01:05:51,250
- Thanks. Tuck.
- This country, man.

847
01:05:51,456 --> 01:05:56,361
Can't go anywhere anymore without
getting mugged or murdered or stabbed.

848
01:05:56,466 --> 01:05:59,176
Kids killing their classmates.
Drive-bys.

849
01:05:59,383 --> 01:06:03,035
- I won't even go into a post office.
- Shut up, Mitch.

850
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:06,579
You shut up.
I hate the little bastard, but he's right.

851
01:06:06,684 --> 01:06:09,917
You know how easy it is to get a gun?
Five minutes. Gun show.

852
01:06:10,126 --> 01:06:13,880
I understand your kid is sick, John,
but what makes him better than me?

853
01:06:13,985 --> 01:06:16,488
- I got a life, too.
- But you got insurance.

854
01:06:16,697 --> 01:06:19,930
So what, are you going to shoot me?
That's what you're telling the cops.

855
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:24,311
If your son doesn't get
the very first heart available, we all die.

856
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:29,422
How's it going to end, John?
What's your move?

857
01:06:30,256 --> 01:06:33,695
I got no moves, okay?
I don't know what I'm going to do.

858
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:39,119
I'm waiting on a miracle, okay?

859
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:42,352
I'm waiting on an act of God.

860
01:07:10,927 --> 01:07:12,387
Could we have a word
with you, please?

861
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:16,871
This is all my fault.

862
01:07:16,976 --> 01:07:19,794
When the hospital told me
they were releasing Mikey,

863
01:07:19,899 --> 01:07:23,964
I called John and yelled at him,
told him to do something, anything.

864
01:07:24,067 --> 01:07:26,885
But I never thought...

865
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:30,222
I understand.
Is he a violent man, Mrs Archibald?

866
01:07:30,433 --> 01:07:37,002
No! He's sweet and gentle.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

867
01:07:37,106 --> 01:07:40,965
That's not what he's saying.
He's talking about killing people.

868
01:07:41,174 --> 01:07:46,909
I may be fishing, but has he spent time
in the military or anything like that?

869
01:07:48,893 --> 01:07:51,289
- What is this?
- What?

870
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,836
I see what's going on here.

871
01:07:56,191 --> 01:08:00,050
You're trying to get me to say something
you can use against my husband.

872
01:08:00,155 --> 01:08:03,699
He's in a lot of trouble.
We're going to need you to talk to him.

873
01:08:03,908 --> 01:08:06,411
Let's get something straight, mister.

874
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,852
You cannot use me
to build a case against my husband.

875
01:08:10,062 --> 01:08:15,067
I support him in everything he does.
I'm on his side, not yours.

876
01:08:15,172 --> 01:08:17,153
And you don't talk to me!

877
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,578
I would tell you
what I think of you...

878
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,018
...but I'm a Christian woman.

879
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:31,753
Now you two leave me alone.
I have a sick child to look after.

880
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:39,680
I've decided to put Michael's name
on the recipient list.

881
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,225
The hospital will pay for everything.

882
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:47,398
Really?

883
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:49,069
Really.

884
01:08:50,214 --> 01:08:51,778
Thank you.

885
01:08:52,509 --> 01:08:55,116
Oh, God, thank you.

886
01:09:02,832 --> 01:09:04,083
You're good.

887
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:07,631
- Excuse me?
- Quite the performance.

888
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,550
- What are you talking about?
- Comforting embrace, sincere look.

889
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:13,262
For a minute,
I actually believed you cared.

890
01:09:26,507 --> 01:09:30,367
We go now to Hope Memorial Hospital.
live... Tuck Lampley.

891
01:09:30,576 --> 01:09:34,016
As you can see. The crowd
in front of Hope Memorial is growing.

892
01:09:34,121 --> 01:09:37,563
The S.W.A.T. Team has arrived.
The situation is becoming tense.

893
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:41,422
Standing next to me is James Palumbo.
friend of John Archibald.

894
01:09:41,527 --> 01:09:44,966
Mr Palumbo. What can you tell us
about John Archibald?

895
01:09:45,071 --> 01:09:50,703
You know. I got to be honest. Tuck.

896
01:09:50,808 --> 01:09:54,875
This whole thing sucks.

897
01:09:55,084 --> 01:09:59,150
It all could have been avoided
so incredibly easy.

898
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:02,487
None of this had to happen
if John had been a frigging millionaire

899
01:10:02,592 --> 01:10:05,930
or if his last name was Rockefeller.
but sometimes John don't get it.

900
01:10:06,034 --> 01:10:10,518
He don't understand that what
we hold sacred in this country isn't values.

901
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:14,588
It's value that's important.
We got haves. We got have-nots.

902
01:10:14,692 --> 01:10:17,715
We've got white collar.
blue collar. And no collar.

903
01:10:17,924 --> 01:10:23,764
Inside there we got surgery.
outpatient surgery. Out-of-luck surgery.

904
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:29,602
There's a lot of people out there
who don't got 250 grand in their billfold.

905
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:33,776
To shame a man like that
and back him into a corner.

906
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,948
seems to me that something
is out of whack. Not someone.

907
01:10:38,156 --> 01:10:41,493
But what do I know?
I'm a factory worker.

908
01:10:41,598 --> 01:10:44,726
I see this is making you upset.
but if you could look into the camera

909
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:47,752
and speak to John Q right now.
what would you say to him?

910
01:10:49,317 --> 01:10:51,505
I'm there with you.
and you take care.

911
01:10:52,756 --> 01:10:54,009
That's one man's opinion.

912
01:10:54,112 --> 01:10:57,763
Live at the crisis at Hope Memorial.
this is Tuck Lampley.

913
01:11:29,258 --> 01:11:32,075
What's going on?
Where's everybody?

914
01:11:32,283 --> 01:11:35,308
We're sending one of our guys
in through the air duct.

915
01:11:35,411 --> 01:11:39,375
If we can get the target
to this phone, we got a clear shot.

916
01:11:39,585 --> 01:11:42,503
- Is that right?
- Yes, Lieutenant, that is right.

917
01:11:42,607 --> 01:11:44,068
When you're ready, Chief.

918
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:02,945
- My wife's calling.
- Worse than that. It's Father Time.

919
01:12:03,154 --> 01:12:04,927
Come over here!

920
01:12:05,656 --> 01:12:08,264
Not one word.
I don't want to hear it.

921
01:12:08,368 --> 01:12:10,558
You're going behind my back!

922
01:12:10,662 --> 01:12:14,001
What do you want from me?
Look at the clock! Look at your watch!

923
01:12:14,211 --> 01:12:17,857
The guy said at a quarter after,
he's going to start killing people.

924
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,988
- This is so goddamned stupid!
- What's your great idea?

925
01:12:21,195 --> 01:12:24,533
There are no great ideas,
especially this!

926
01:12:24,638 --> 01:12:27,245
I got a shot at this guy,
I'm going to take it.

927
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:30,687
You know the drill.
Always take the open shot.

928
01:12:30,897 --> 01:12:33,190
The wife has agreed to speak to him.
Let her talk him down.

929
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:37,362
- That's exactly what I'm going to do.
- You used the wife to set him up?

930
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:41,116
I'm going to use whatever works.
Let me paint a picture for you.

931
01:12:41,325 --> 01:12:45,392
What we have is a lose/lose. This guy
starts whacking hostages, that's bad.

932
01:12:45,497 --> 01:12:48,104
If we give into this asshole,
it's also bad.

933
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:51,752
- Bad for who?
- Everybody. Me, you, everybody.

934
01:12:51,857 --> 01:12:53,528
It's an election year.

935
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:56,447
However it goes down,
this guy's not going to make it.

936
01:12:56,551 --> 01:13:00,411
- You kill him, that's a P.R. bonanza?
- I can live with one dead bad guy.

937
01:13:00,516 --> 01:13:05,940
What I can't live with is one innocent
person being hurt, not on my watch.

938
01:13:07,191 --> 01:13:09,797
You know what, Frank?
You're out!

939
01:13:09,902 --> 01:13:13,656
- I'm out?
- You're officially relieved of duty.

940
01:13:13,865 --> 01:13:15,846
- I'm going to handle this now.
- You?

941
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:19,079
Me. You think it's my first time
around the dance floor?

942
01:13:19,184 --> 01:13:22,102
How do you think I got these?
And watch it.

943
01:13:22,206 --> 01:13:25,438
I got a lot of pressure on me.
There's a lot of eyes watching.

944
01:13:25,543 --> 01:13:29,091
Someone's got to make the call.
You're not going to do it, are you?

945
01:13:29,194 --> 01:13:30,446
I'll do it.

946
01:13:31,385 --> 01:13:33,887
What about the hostages,
the human beings?

947
01:13:34,097 --> 01:13:35,451
Better keep their heads down.

948
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:49,739
- Great.
- What is it?

949
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,825
The air conditioning just turned off.

950
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:01,422
I'm counting on you.
Don't let me down, okay? I'll call you!

951
01:14:01,629 --> 01:14:03,924
Right on. Excuse me. Sorry.

952
01:14:04,028 --> 01:14:06,427
Don't touch me!
Excuse me. Thank you.

953
01:14:06,637 --> 01:14:08,825
Tuck Lampley, Channel 8?
Right. You got it.

954
01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:10,703
Thanks, Officer! Excuse me.

955
01:14:13,623 --> 01:14:14,873
Where's my picture?

956
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:17,585
I got to unscramble the police encryption.
We're almost there.

957
01:14:17,689 --> 01:14:20,089
Hurry up.
I got a contact in Cardiology.

958
01:14:20,192 --> 01:14:23,636
The cops are going to set up a call
between this guy and his wife.

959
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:31,143
Are you with the wife?
All right, let's patch it through.

960
01:15:02,849 --> 01:15:04,621
This better be good, Frank.

961
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,818
God, baby.

962
01:15:13,799 --> 01:15:16,301
- We're on the list.
- What?

963
01:15:16,405 --> 01:15:20,057
Payne just left here.
Mikey's name is on the list.

964
01:15:20,161 --> 01:15:23,603
- Baby, you did it.
- What? We're on the list?

965
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:32,052
This is great, baby.

966
01:15:39,663 --> 01:15:43,731
- We got sound.
- Where's the video? I need picture.

967
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:46,754
Boss, hang on.
I'm going to make you really famous.

968
01:15:47,693 --> 01:15:50,197
I'm just...

969
01:15:51,761 --> 01:15:55,308
That's great, baby.
How's Mikey doing?

970
01:16:01,354 --> 01:16:05,841
Not too good.
I think he's going away.

971
01:16:05,947 --> 01:16:08,135
What?

972
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:14,599
They've done everything they can for him,
but he keeps getting worse and worse.

973
01:16:16,168 --> 01:16:19,191
Oh, God.

974
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,484
Our poor baby.

975
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:34,937
Are you praying for him, John?
Are you praying for our baby?

976
01:16:35,042 --> 01:16:37,755
Yes, sweetheart.
You know I am.

977
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,779
Checkmate.
This is the White Rook. Copy.

978
01:16:40,882 --> 01:16:42,133
I copy, White Rook.

979
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:44,221
It's going to be all right, sweetheart.
Listen to me.

980
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,347
He's going to make it.

981
01:16:47,555 --> 01:16:51,730
I swear on my life, he's going to make it.
You understand me?

982
01:16:54,441 --> 01:16:57,882
You just got to believe me,
you understand?

983
01:16:58,091 --> 01:16:59,238
I believe.

984
01:17:00,386 --> 01:17:03,829
Is he awake? Is Mikey awake?
Can I talk to him?

985
01:17:04,766 --> 01:17:06,121
Hold on.

986
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:17,595
Oh, my God.

987
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:21,138
We got it! Boss!
The video's online.

988
01:17:21,243 --> 01:17:23,122
- You are a genius.
- I got to get the monitor.

989
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:26,875
What are you doing standing around?
Move your ass! This is it!

990
01:17:26,979 --> 01:17:29,691
Thank you.
Freddy, I swear to God...

991
01:17:29,796 --> 01:17:32,089
Nigel, you're moving
like lava. Hustle.

992
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,489
How's my hair?
Never mind. Let's get this.

993
01:17:34,593 --> 01:17:36,576
And three, two, one.

994
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:39,181
This is Tuck Lampley,
live at Hope Memorial Hospital,

995
01:17:39,285 --> 01:17:42,207
bringing you exclusive coverage
between a father and his son

996
01:17:42,309 --> 01:17:44,291
he's fighting
most desperately to save.

997
01:17:46,275 --> 01:17:47,943
Honey?

998
01:17:48,047 --> 01:17:50,134
It's your dad.
He's on the phone.

999
01:17:58,686 --> 01:17:59,831
Champ.

1000
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:03,901
How's my boy?

1001
01:18:04,005 --> 01:18:05,360
You hanging in there?

1002
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:12,555
- How are you?
- How am I? I'm good.

1003
01:18:13,597 --> 01:18:15,372
Don't worry about me.
I'm good.

1004
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,280
How come you're not here, Dad?

1005
01:18:35,186 --> 01:18:41,861
I'm tied up. I can't get away now.
But I'm close. real close to you.

1006
01:18:42,071 --> 01:18:44,887
Mom says I need a new heart.

1007
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,284
That's right, champ. You do.

1008
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:51,873
But what's wrong with my heart?

1009
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:55,212
There's nothing wrong.
It's just that you...

1010
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:02,718
You just need a...
They're going to...

1011
01:19:02,823 --> 01:19:07,100
You got to get a better heart
to be stronger, that's all.

1012
01:19:07,308 --> 01:19:10,228
They're giving you a new one
that's going to make you real strong.

1013
01:19:24,725 --> 01:19:26,811
Am I going to die?

1014
01:19:28,273 --> 01:19:30,879
No, you're not going to die.
Of course not.

1015
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:35,259
How do you know?

1016
01:19:35,363 --> 01:19:38,596
What good would
the world be without you?

1017
01:19:38,702 --> 01:19:41,412
Oh, my God. This is
the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1018
01:19:41,621 --> 01:19:43,601
Without you there is no world.

1019
01:19:44,332 --> 01:19:46,001
This is my white Bronco.

1020
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:49,860
Listen to me.

1021
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,947
On your command.

1022
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:56,430
You know I love you, don't you?
You know how proud I am of you?

1023
01:19:58,306 --> 01:20:00,496
I just wanted to make sure
you know that.

1024
01:20:01,438 --> 01:20:04,251
I just wanted to tell you that
in case I forgot.

1025
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:08,111
Take the shot.

1026
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:11,239
It's not clear.

1027
01:20:12,282 --> 01:20:14,056
Holding.

1028
01:20:16,454 --> 01:20:19,271
Why don't you give me
one of those Chris Cormeirs?

1029
01:20:23,337 --> 01:20:28,030
Chris Cormeir. He's great.

1030
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:30,430
He's great and so are you, baby.

1031
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:37,105
I love you, Dad.

1032
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:40,964
Okay, son.

1033
01:20:43,154 --> 01:20:45,237
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1034
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:48,159
With all my heant. Son.
I love you.

1035
01:20:48,263 --> 01:20:50,975
- I love you. Too. Dad.
- Oh, shit!

1036
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:57,231
You're on TV, man.
Channel 8.

1037
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,231
He's down. We got him.

1038
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,266
He's not down.

1039
01:21:54,801 --> 01:21:56,887
Goddamn it!

1040
01:21:56,991 --> 01:21:59,077
Command. Yes, sir.

1041
01:21:59,182 --> 01:22:02,101
- This is very bad, Gus.
- Not now.

1042
01:22:02,205 --> 01:22:04,917
It's the mayor, sir.
We better kill this video feed.

1043
01:22:05,127 --> 01:22:09,194
The press hacked into our signal.
This went out live over national television.

1044
01:22:32,033 --> 01:22:34,226
- Mikey's not going to make it.
- What about the list?

1045
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:37,142
What list? They're shooting
at me, shooting at us.

1046
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:39,229
They're not going to help my son.

1047
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:41,734
The sniper gained access
to the hospital through the venti...

1048
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:44,547
- Are you going to bust me?
- Out of here.

1049
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:47,155
You just shot an innocent man
on prime-time TV.

1050
01:23:12,498 --> 01:23:14,271
Where's Grimes?

1051
01:23:15,627 --> 01:23:17,505
Hang in there, man!

1052
01:23:17,713 --> 01:23:19,801
Where's Lieutenant Grimes?

1053
01:23:20,424 --> 01:23:23,448
- All right.
- All right what?

1054
01:23:23,656 --> 01:23:26,890
- Let's go see what he wants.
- You've got to be kidding.

1055
01:23:26,995 --> 01:23:29,810
Don't start breaking my balls.
I screwed up, all right?

1056
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:33,148
I need you to save my ass.
I really stepped in shit. Please.

1057
01:23:33,356 --> 01:23:36,279
Come on, I'll buy you a steak.

1058
01:23:38,154 --> 01:23:41,805
Peking duck. Let's go.

1059
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:45,245
A-R-C-H-l-B-A-L-D.

1060
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:48,375
I'm faxing you
all the stuff right now.

1061
01:23:57,343 --> 01:23:59,952
Come over here.

1062
01:24:01,621 --> 01:24:05,165
- Hold your fire!
- Don't fire. Turn them down.

1063
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:08,294
There's a lot of cameras.
I don't want anybody doing anything.

1064
01:24:09,861 --> 01:24:11,215
Who's that with you?

1065
01:24:11,945 --> 01:24:14,655
- Sergeant...
- Moody!

1066
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,785
Police Chief Moroe.

1067
01:24:17,888 --> 01:24:19,870
What's going on here, John?

1068
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:25,294
He's got no pants on.

1069
01:24:33,013 --> 01:24:34,576
You lied to me, Lieutenant.

1070
01:24:34,681 --> 01:24:37,496
You said you were going to
call me back, but you didn't.

1071
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,250
I gave you your hostages,
but you didn't call me back. Why?

1072
01:24:41,355 --> 01:24:45,215
- Because you want me dead.
- Nobody wants to kill you.

1073
01:24:45,319 --> 01:24:47,614
Nobody wants to kill me?

1074
01:24:47,821 --> 01:24:50,845
None of these guys? Not him?

1075
01:24:50,949 --> 01:24:52,619
What is this?

1076
01:24:59,084 --> 01:25:03,152
What did you think would happen?
You want truth? Here's some truth.

1077
01:25:03,361 --> 01:25:08,159
This is going to end up bad for you.
There's only two ways out of here.

1078
01:25:08,366 --> 01:25:11,912
Jail or dead.

1079
01:25:12,017 --> 01:25:16,500
My son is very sick
and he needs some help.

1080
01:25:16,604 --> 01:25:21,194
It's hard to be a man these days,
hard to know what the right thing is.

1081
01:25:21,402 --> 01:25:25,157
- But put the gun down, John.
- You're not hearing me, Frank!

1082
01:25:25,366 --> 01:25:30,478
My son is sick! That's it!
There's nothing else. End of story.

1083
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:35,273
When people are sick,
they deserve a little help.

1084
01:25:36,628 --> 01:25:38,818
Sick, help.

1085
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,745
I am not going to bury my son!

1086
01:25:47,996 --> 01:25:51,231
My son is going to bury me.

1087
01:25:51,336 --> 01:25:54,463
You think these people
give a shit about you? They don't.

1088
01:25:54,569 --> 01:25:59,678
You're just the cause of the moment.
Nobody cares. That's the real truth.

1089
01:25:59,782 --> 01:26:02,286
Nobody cares. Only you.

1090
01:26:03,537 --> 01:26:09,586
And it's only you and me out here
and all these guns pointed at you.

1091
01:26:10,628 --> 01:26:12,610
What do you want to do?
It's your call.

1092
01:26:12,819 --> 01:26:14,280
I want my son.

1093
01:26:15,532 --> 01:26:19,597
- I want my son inside with me.
- Can't do it, John!

1094
01:26:19,702 --> 01:26:22,726
You give me my boy,
I give you your sniper.

1095
01:26:22,829 --> 01:26:24,396
It's all over.

1096
01:26:26,168 --> 01:26:28,463
You bring my son,

1097
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:30,443
I give up...

1098
01:26:31,384 --> 01:26:33,260
...everybody goes home.

1099
01:26:35,867 --> 01:26:37,642
Everybody's safe.

1100
01:26:41,394 --> 01:26:43,271
You bring me my son.

1101
01:26:44,419 --> 01:26:45,775
Come on.

1102
01:26:45,879 --> 01:26:47,235
All right.

1103
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,676
What do you think, Frank?

1104
01:26:51,721 --> 01:26:54,641
Give it to him. He's not going to
hurt anybody with his boy in there.

1105
01:26:54,745 --> 01:26:57,455
The object is to get hostages out,
not bring them in.

1106
01:26:57,559 --> 01:27:00,377
It's not a hostage.
It's his son.

1107
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:04,233
Have all these people
been on the news?

1108
01:27:04,338 --> 01:27:06,321
It's your call, Frank.

1109
01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:12,892
All right, give it to him.

1110
01:27:15,393 --> 01:27:18,210
- Hold it!
- No, listen to me.

1111
01:27:18,418 --> 01:27:20,608
I'm his mother.
I need to be in there!

1112
01:27:22,591 --> 01:27:25,823
Stop! Stop right there!

1113
01:27:25,928 --> 01:27:28,847
Go! Beat it! Now!

1114
01:27:45,014 --> 01:27:48,975
We're in trouble. Mike's blood pressure
has dropped into the mid-40s.

1115
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,627
His atrial blood pressure
should be in the low teens. It's 35.

1116
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:54,190
I'm sorry, John.

1117
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:58,153
Without a new heart,
he's not going to make it.

1118
01:28:05,348 --> 01:28:06,394
Then take mine.

1119
01:28:07,645 --> 01:28:09,521
- What?
- You heard me.

1120
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:12,232
Take my heart,
and you put it in Mike.

1121
01:28:12,336 --> 01:28:15,881
- You done lost your damn mind.
- You can't be serious.

1122
01:28:15,986 --> 01:28:18,179
You bet I'm serious.
I'm dead serious.

1123
01:28:18,284 --> 01:28:19,325
Oh, my God.

1124
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:23,392
- You'll be dead.
- And my son will live.

1125
01:28:23,497 --> 01:28:26,104
- You can't do this.
- It's the only way.

1126
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:29,963
- Physically, you can't do this.
- I kill myself.

1127
01:28:30,067 --> 01:28:32,048
You open me up, take my heart.

1128
01:28:32,153 --> 01:28:33,821
- It's perfect.
- That's just crazy.

1129
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:36,532
We can't just remove your heart
and put it into Michael's body.

1130
01:28:36,637 --> 01:28:37,992
There are too many unknowns.

1131
01:28:38,097 --> 01:28:40,706
Matching donor and recipient
is extremely complicated.

1132
01:28:40,812 --> 01:28:43,208
- Critical tests have to be taken.
- Like what?

1133
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:45,709
Cross matches for blood type,
chest cavity measurements.

1134
01:28:45,815 --> 01:28:48,318
If blood tissues
are not completely compatible...

1135
01:28:48,527 --> 01:28:51,758
I know about compatibility.
We've been tested up the wazoo.

1136
01:28:51,863 --> 01:28:54,367
We're both B-positive.
Our tissues match.

1137
01:28:54,576 --> 01:28:57,287
His heart's three times the size
of normal, so mine will fit.

1138
01:28:57,495 --> 01:29:00,936
- You know we're compatible.
- Out of the question. Too risky.

1139
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:04,275
- I'm telling you he will make it!
- Can't do it.

1140
01:29:04,379 --> 01:29:08,759
If I'm laying dead, you're not going to
take my heart and save his life?

1141
01:29:08,862 --> 01:29:11,679
You'll let two die instead of one
because of a technicality?

1142
01:29:11,784 --> 01:29:15,955
- I think what John is trying to do is right.
- Me, too. I think it's so brave.

1143
01:29:16,164 --> 01:29:18,561
What do you think Mike would want?
What about your wife?

1144
01:29:18,771 --> 01:29:20,649
Mike's too young to know
what's good for him.

1145
01:29:20,753 --> 01:29:24,506
It's my job to protect him.
Denise would do the same thing.

1146
01:29:26,593 --> 01:29:30,660
I know what's happening to Mike is bad.
Matter of fact, it's the worst.

1147
01:29:30,869 --> 01:29:34,208
But killing yourself
ain't going to solve a damn thing.

1148
01:29:34,415 --> 01:29:38,065
Sometimes you just
got to let go and let God...

1149
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,777
Just accept it, brother.

1150
01:29:41,402 --> 01:29:42,968
Accept it?

1151
01:29:44,323 --> 01:29:45,366
Accept what?

1152
01:29:48,808 --> 01:29:50,998
That Mike is going to die.

1153
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:55,690
No, I don't accept that. Ever.

1154
01:29:56,942 --> 01:30:00,175
I reject that out of hand.

1155
01:30:00,383 --> 01:30:04,867
All right, he's a patient to you,
I understand, but he's a good kid.

1156
01:30:04,971 --> 01:30:08,100
He loves bodybuilding.

1157
01:30:08,206 --> 01:30:10,710
He wants to be a bodybuilder.
Can you believe that?

1158
01:30:10,813 --> 01:30:13,421
He's funny. You'd like him.

1159
01:30:14,673 --> 01:30:17,592
- You'd like him if you got to know him.
- I do like him.

1160
01:30:17,696 --> 01:30:21,136
Then, please, I'm just begging you,
step outside the rules.

1161
01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:25,414
I'd like to, John, I really would,
but what you're asking crosses the line.

1162
01:30:25,517 --> 01:30:28,019
It is completely unethical.

1163
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:32,296
I'm crossing the line? You're crossing.
The whole system is crossing the line.

1164
01:30:32,401 --> 01:30:34,696
Maybe you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

1165
01:30:34,905 --> 01:30:38,660
I don't give a damn.
My son's going to live.

1166
01:30:38,868 --> 01:30:43,246
Maybe you haven't figured that out by now.
I'll do whatever I got to do for him to live.

1167
01:30:43,455 --> 01:30:47,940
What are you going to do,
shoot me if I don't operate?

1168
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,321
I'm going to kill myself.

1169
01:30:54,197 --> 01:30:56,911
All right?
Let's just see what happens.

1170
01:30:57,432 --> 01:31:00,248
That's what this is about, right?
He needs a donor.

1171
01:31:00,351 --> 01:31:04,522
Somebody's got to die for him to live.
I'm his father. It's me.

1172
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,516
- All right.
- All right what?

1173
01:31:16,621 --> 01:31:18,603
I'll do it, if that's what you want.

1174
01:31:18,707 --> 01:31:21,521
- You're going to let him kill himself?
- Once he's dead, why not?

1175
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:24,025
You are the finest surgeon
I have ever known.

1176
01:31:24,129 --> 01:31:27,674
You cannot throw your career,
your life away for this.

1177
01:31:27,883 --> 01:31:31,431
- If you do this, you're finished.
- What are they going to do, sue me?

1178
01:31:31,535 --> 01:31:33,412
Disbar me?

1179
01:31:33,619 --> 01:31:35,705
Evict me from the country club?

1180
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:38,419
This is still a hospital.

1181
01:31:38,938 --> 01:31:42,694
If there's a heart available,
I'm not going to let it go to waste.

1182
01:31:42,903 --> 01:31:46,032
Doctor, Mr Maguire,
let's get ready for surgery.

1183
01:32:15,442 --> 01:32:18,779
- They're ready to harvest.
- All right, hurry up, guys.

1184
01:32:19,405 --> 01:32:21,280
Get her on the table.

1185
01:32:21,386 --> 01:32:24,203
- What's our time?
- All right, ready to lift.

1186
01:32:24,411 --> 01:32:27,226
- Count of three.
- Oh-four-five.

1187
01:32:31,086 --> 01:32:32,962
- Scalpels laid out.
- Where's his tray?

1188
01:32:33,067 --> 01:32:36,403
Got the other one ready?
Bring the cart around, please.

1189
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:43,705
What do we have?

1190
01:32:43,913 --> 01:32:46,729
Female donor, 26 years old.

1191
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:50,902
- She is 26 years old, 5'7".
- Liver, kidneys usable.

1192
01:32:51,007 --> 01:32:54,551
Liver and kidneys
are both usable. Lungs?

1193
01:32:55,697 --> 01:32:59,453
- Lungs are okay. Heart?
- Heart is good.

1194
01:32:59,558 --> 01:33:00,704
Blood type?

1195
01:33:02,164 --> 01:33:03,833
B-positive.

1196
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:08,942
This is my...

1197
01:33:11,239 --> 01:33:12,387
...my will.

1198
01:33:14,053 --> 01:33:19,372
It says I'm leaving my heart to my son,
and I need two witnesses to sign.

1199
01:33:19,476 --> 01:33:22,501
I'm not signing it.
I ain't going to watch you kill yourself.

1200
01:33:22,605 --> 01:33:24,171
Me, neither.

1201
01:33:24,275 --> 01:33:26,464
The sooner you sign it,
the sooner you go home.

1202
01:33:29,906 --> 01:33:32,825
- I'll sign.
- Me, too.

1203
01:33:42,837 --> 01:33:45,445
You're just going to go in there
and off yourself?

1204
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:48,365
- Only one thing will stop me.
- What's that?

1205
01:33:48,573 --> 01:33:50,243
If Mitch is B-positive.

1206
01:33:51,705 --> 01:33:54,100
Type O. Swear to God.

1207
01:33:59,317 --> 01:34:00,670
Thank you.

1208
01:34:00,776 --> 01:34:03,383
You be good.
Be careful.

1209
01:34:16,212 --> 01:34:17,983
See you in the funny papers.

1210
01:34:27,891 --> 01:34:29,351
Can I have a word with him?

1211
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:34,046
Thank you.

1212
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,885
How you doing, buddy?

1213
01:35:16,597 --> 01:35:19,516
Did you find me a new heart?

1214
01:35:23,168 --> 01:35:27,653
We got you one.
I guess you got a guardian angel.

1215
01:35:29,738 --> 01:35:32,446
Just try to stay awake
for a minute, okay?

1216
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:35,473
I just need to tell you a few things.

1217
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:46,321
You always listen to your mother.

1218
01:35:46,527 --> 01:35:48,510
You understand?

1219
01:35:48,614 --> 01:35:50,806
Do what she tells you to do.

1220
01:35:53,517 --> 01:35:55,600
She's your best friend.

1221
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,834
You tell her you love her every day.

1222
01:36:04,361 --> 01:36:07,073
You're too young
for girls right now, but...

1223
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:11,455
...there's going to come a time.

1224
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:14,895
When it does,
you treat them like princesses.

1225
01:36:16,147 --> 01:36:17,920
'Cause that's what they are.

1226
01:36:21,987 --> 01:36:24,178
When you say
you're going to do something...

1227
01:36:40,447 --> 01:36:43,158
When you say you're going to
do something, you do it.

1228
01:36:45,766 --> 01:36:49,312
Because your word is your bond, son.
It's all you have.

1229
01:36:51,815 --> 01:36:54,527
And money. You make money
if you get a chance,

1230
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:56,717
even if you got to sell out
once in a while.

1231
01:36:56,821 --> 01:37:00,470
Make as much money as you can.
Don't be stupid like your father.

1232
01:37:01,409 --> 01:37:04,434
Everything is so much easier
with money, son.

1233
01:37:06,518 --> 01:37:07,875
Don't smoke.

1234
01:37:11,838 --> 01:37:14,447
Be kind to people.

1235
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:16,428
When somebody chooses you...

1236
01:37:16,636 --> 01:37:20,077
We talked about this.
You stand up. You be a man.

1237
01:37:24,456 --> 01:37:27,900
You stay away
from the bad things, son, please.

1238
01:37:29,567 --> 01:37:31,758
Don't get caught up
in the bad things.

1239
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:37,181
There's so many great things
out there for you.

1240
01:37:47,297 --> 01:37:49,072
I'll never leave you.

1241
01:37:58,457 --> 01:38:00,126
I'm always with you.

1242
01:38:04,193 --> 01:38:05,757
Right there.

1243
01:38:11,806 --> 01:38:13,473
I love you, son.

1244
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,070
I'll see you later.

1245
01:38:45,493 --> 01:38:47,058
Turner gets the other one.

1246
01:38:53,524 --> 01:38:55,399
Match with donor.

1247
01:39:04,474 --> 01:39:06,456
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

1248
01:39:21,785 --> 01:39:23,143
Let's do it.

1249
01:39:43,063 --> 01:39:46,920
Wait a minute. Are you telling me
that gun was empty the whole time?

1250
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:50,050
I'm all talk.

1251
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,802
The only one
I ever considered killing was me.

1252
01:40:09,552 --> 01:40:11,534
Maybe we should get some towels.

1253
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,226
You're not going to believe this.
We got a match.

1254
01:40:16,434 --> 01:40:20,293
B-positive. Michael William Archibald,
the only status one in the country.

1255
01:40:20,502 --> 01:40:22,066
I'll be damned.

1256
01:40:42,195 --> 01:40:43,760
I'm thirsty.

1257
01:40:52,519 --> 01:40:54,085
We have very good news.

1258
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:07,434
Jesus.

1259
01:41:13,482 --> 01:41:14,942
The safety's on.

1260
01:41:15,046 --> 01:41:17,340
- Is this for real?
- The jet landed at O'Hare.

1261
01:41:17,444 --> 01:41:20,366
The helicopter's
going to be here in 15 minutes.

1262
01:41:20,576 --> 01:41:23,390
You do the honours, okay? Go.

1263
01:41:27,978 --> 01:41:29,857
Baby. It's me.

1264
01:41:32,777 --> 01:41:34,549
It's not working.

1265
01:41:37,885 --> 01:41:40,913
Please. Baby. Pick up.
John. Can you...

1266
01:42:00,518 --> 01:42:03,230
It's a miracle, baby!
They found a heart!

1267
01:42:07,193 --> 01:42:08,339
The heant is here!

1268
01:42:08,549 --> 01:42:11,676
I repeat... the heant for little
Mike Archibald has arrived.

1269
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:15,641
What an unbelievable ending
to this incredible. Tumultuous day.

1270
01:42:15,745 --> 01:42:18,978
- There they are.
- Okay. Here we go.

1271
01:42:22,731 --> 01:42:25,026
Yes. The hostages
are coming out.

1272
01:42:25,236 --> 01:42:27,322
One. Two.

1273
01:42:27,425 --> 01:42:29,614
They appear to be unharmed
but centainly exhausted

1274
01:42:29,824 --> 01:42:32,537
from what must have been
an excruciating ordeal.

1275
01:42:32,638 --> 01:42:35,976
More now! More coming out.
hands waving in the air.

1276
01:42:36,185 --> 01:42:38,272
Freedom. Freedom at last.

1277
01:42:38,376 --> 01:42:40,775
Police are esconting them
one by one to safety.

1278
01:42:40,984 --> 01:42:43,486
- How do you feel?
- Somebody else is coming.

1279
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:45,362
It's John Q.

1280
01:42:45,572 --> 01:42:47,450
John Q has come out.
hands in the air.

1281
01:42:47,659 --> 01:42:51,411
He's putting the gun down.
He appears to be surrendering.

1282
01:42:51,515 --> 01:42:54,960
The police
are approaching cautiously now.

1283
01:42:55,064 --> 01:42:58,400
And they've got him.
They've subdued John Q.

1284
01:42:58,503 --> 01:43:01,321
The handcuffs are on.
and it appears to be over.

1285
01:43:01,426 --> 01:43:03,406
It's all over.

1286
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:08,622
If pictures speak a thousand words.
then these images do speak volumes.

1287
01:43:08,831 --> 01:43:12,169
And now. As the bloody standoff
comes to an end. We remind you

1288
01:43:12,272 --> 01:43:14,460
that Channel 8 News was here first

1289
01:43:14,565 --> 01:43:17,382
with exclusive
moment-to-moment live coverage

1290
01:43:17,589 --> 01:43:20,926
of "Crisis at Hope Memorial."

1291
01:43:21,032 --> 01:43:22,701
I'm Tuck Lampley.

1292
01:43:32,189 --> 01:43:33,861
Open those doors!

1293
01:43:34,071 --> 01:43:35,631
Look out!
We're coming through! Come on!

1294
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:47,627
We love you, John!

1295
01:43:47,732 --> 01:43:50,443
God bless you!
I'd do the same thing!

1296
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:17,453
Heart.

1297
01:44:19,748 --> 01:44:21,000
Thank you.

1298
01:44:23,814 --> 01:44:24,858
Metzenbaums.

1299
01:44:28,925 --> 01:44:30,385
Prepare for cutting.

1300
01:44:46,759 --> 01:44:49,679
Put these on for me,
would you do that?

1301
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:51,453
Take your time.

1302
01:45:03,133 --> 01:45:04,176
Lift it.

1303
01:45:06,574 --> 01:45:09,495
All right, done.
How beautiful was that?

1304
01:45:09,703 --> 01:45:11,476
- Pressure up.
- Pressure up.

1305
01:45:12,414 --> 01:45:15,545
And now one, two, three.

1306
01:45:22,634 --> 01:45:23,783
It worked!

1307
01:45:38,384 --> 01:45:40,471
The other big story...
John Q goes on trial today

1308
01:45:40,574 --> 01:45:43,286
for kidnapping
and attempted murder charges

1309
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:47,457
all because an HMO denied coverage
for his son's heant transplant.

1310
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:51,420
... more expensive for you in the future.
HMOs. To deny coverage...

1311
01:45:51,628 --> 01:45:55,591
There are still 40 million Americans
who are uninsured...

1312
01:45:55,697 --> 01:45:57,782
Tonight. As the trial continues.

1313
01:45:57,990 --> 01:46:02,476
John Quincy Archibald...
vigilante or heroic father?

1314
01:46:02,581 --> 01:46:07,169
... is to sue the pants off them
for millions of dollars to let them know...

1315
01:46:09,671 --> 01:46:13,739
We have known foryears
this is a crappy health care system.

1316
01:46:13,844 --> 01:46:16,033
We've known
we had to do something...

1317
01:46:16,137 --> 01:46:19,578
John Q was using one of those
faith-based health care plans.

1318
01:46:19,683 --> 01:46:22,395
You just pray.
and the government does nothing.

1319
01:46:22,603 --> 01:46:27,401
... not agree with that? The point is.
the enemy we're trying to identify is us.

1320
01:46:29,174 --> 01:46:31,051
We are the ones
who shot down national health care.

1321
01:46:31,153 --> 01:46:33,658
We are the ones
who don't want our taxes raised.

1322
01:46:33,763 --> 01:46:36,474
You have to look in the mirror
for this problem.

1323
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,750
Back up. Come on.

1324
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:44,400
Just one question, please!

1325
01:46:48,571 --> 01:46:50,345
How's your son doing, John?

1326
01:46:51,494 --> 01:46:53,265
A statement, please!

1327
01:46:53,369 --> 01:46:55,560
Out of the way.
Let's go.

1328
01:46:56,497 --> 01:47:00,044
- How are you feeling right now?
- Smile, John!

1329
01:47:15,374 --> 01:47:18,920
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honour.

1330
01:47:19,025 --> 01:47:22,258
As to count one,
attempted murder...

1331
01:47:22,362 --> 01:47:26,430
we find the defendant
John Quincy Archibald not guilty.

1332
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:30,185
Quiet, please.

1333
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:35,607
On count two,
armed criminal action... not guilty.

1334
01:47:36,651 --> 01:47:38,423
Quiet!

1335
01:47:38,632 --> 01:47:43,011
On the final count, the kidnapping
and false imprisonment

1336
01:47:43,221 --> 01:47:46,662
of Julie Byrd, Max Conlan,

1337
01:47:46,766 --> 01:47:50,835
Rosa Gonzalez, Dr Allen Klein,

1338
01:47:50,939 --> 01:47:54,484
Lester Matthews, Steve Maguire,

1339
01:47:54,693 --> 01:47:59,803
Miriam and Steve Smith,
Dr Raymond Turner,

1340
01:47:59,907 --> 01:48:03,765
Mitch Quigley, Debby Utley,

1341
01:48:03,975 --> 01:48:06,479
we find the defendant...

1342
01:48:06,583 --> 01:48:07,625
guilty.

1343
01:48:10,337 --> 01:48:13,570
Quiet, please. Sentencing will be
one week from today.

1344
01:48:14,612 --> 01:48:15,656
All rise.

1345
01:48:19,099 --> 01:48:22,538
- What are we looking at?
- He's going to do some time.

1346
01:48:22,641 --> 01:48:25,250
The judge is not going to give him
more than three to five.

1347
01:48:25,355 --> 01:48:29,005
I'll try and get it down to two.
I'm sorry.

1348
01:48:32,656 --> 01:48:34,531
You all right, slugger?

1349
01:48:36,097 --> 01:48:39,852
You take good care of your mother, okay?
You're the man of the house now.

1350
01:48:39,956 --> 01:48:43,709
You have any problems,
Jimmy and Gina will be here for you, too.

1351
01:48:56,642 --> 01:48:58,626
I'm so proud of you.

1352
01:49:04,256 --> 01:49:06,550
Give them frigging hell, Johnny.
Don't worry about nothing.

1353
01:49:12,601 --> 01:49:14,267
It's not good-bye, son.

1354
01:49:16,249 --> 01:49:17,501
See you later.

1355
01:49:41,071 --> 01:49:44,513
Take care, man.
You my hero.

1356
01:50:22,683 --> 01:50:23,623
Thank you.
