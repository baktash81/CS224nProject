1
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,731
<i>1844...</i>

2
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:18,234
<i>by then, life had become</i>
<i>very bleak for the cosways,</i>

3
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,336
<i>my family.</i>

4
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:22,237
<i>Our plantation was ruined</i>

5
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,472
<i>by the emancipation</i>
<i>of the slaves,</i>

6
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:29,543
<i>and my father, desperate,</i>
<i>drank himself to death.</i>

7
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:42,087
Christophene!

8
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,692
<i>We were alone at colibri...</i>

9
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,894
<i>my mother,</i>
<i>my little brother, and me.</i>

10
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:55,064
<i>Christophene was the only one</i>
<i>who stayed with us.</i>

11
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:56,432
<i>She was our protector,</i>

12
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,066
<i>for she knew obeah,</i>

13
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:00,902
<i>and the blacks</i>
<i>feared her magic even more</i>

14
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:02,370
<i>than they hated us.</i>

15
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:12,412
<i>Colibri had been large</i>
<i>and beautiful</i>

16
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:14,881
<i>as that garden in the Bible,</i>

17
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:17,884
<i>but no one</i>
<i>looked after it anymore,</i>

18
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:20,352
<i>and it had gone wild.</i>

19
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:23,921
Ow!

20
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:26,390
Me blackbeard now,
and you my slave.

21
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:27,891
Come on.

22
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:30,260
Why not you be the slave?

23
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:32,795
Because pirates
are white, silly.

24
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,207
<i>When they killed her horse,</i>

25
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,809
<i>my mother knew</i>
<i>there was one last hope.</i>

26
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,279
<i>She married a rich</i>
<i>englishman, Mr. Mason,</i>

27
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:55,447
<i>who had just arrived in Jamaica</i>

28
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:57,549
<i>and knew nothing about her.</i>

29
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,153
Oh, he has the most
spectacular apple orchard.

30
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,154
Apples?

31
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:04,288
Yes.

32
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:09,592
Obviously her obeah
woman christophene

33
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,794
must have cast a spell on him.

34
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:13,562
A man of his age
allowing himself

35
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:16,097
to be seduced
by a woman like her.

36
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:18,766
How anyone
in their right mind...

37
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:21,935
<i>The English matrons hated</i>
<i>my mother's frenchness</i>

38
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,470
<i>and her irrepressible beauty,</i>

39
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:29,574
<i>but Mr. Mason was too in love</i>
<i>with her to notice.</i>

40
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:33,243
Antoinette.

41
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,086
Antoinette.

42
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:49,590
I want to dance
with my new niece.

43
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:20,553
Thank you, myra.

44
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,457
I have as much right to be here

45
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,825
as your daughter,

46
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,459
more right by English law.

47
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:32,295
I am older than she is,

48
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:34,297
and I am a man.

49
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,132
What do you know
of English law?

50
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:37,133
It's all an invention,

51
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:40,302
and it's making me dizzy.

52
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:42,304
Who let you in here?

53
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:44,306
Do you know who I am?

54
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,308
Everyone around here knows.

55
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,544
Yes! Come with me.

56
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,012
Quick.

57
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:53,146
Quickly.

58
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:56,716
You don't want him
to see me, huh?

59
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,719
What do you want
from me, Daniel?

60
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:02,388
What is rightfully mine.

61
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,722
I give you the money...

62
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:05,090
not because I believe you.

63
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:06,724
Maybe your husband
will believe me.

64
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:08,225
How much do you want?

65
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:09,559
I take no money now,

66
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:12,828
just to give you time
to think about it.

67
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,830
If I see you here again,

68
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,032
you're going to be sorry
you were born.

69
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:26,907
You talk to him,
he poison your mind.

70
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:31,744
Myra, she let him in.

71
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:35,114
Like a spider, that man.

72
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:37,583
He will always be around.

73
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:19,758
Look at them,

74
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,893
forever laying about.

75
00:07:21,895 --> 00:07:23,828
Why aren't you three
in the fields?

76
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,796
Snakebite, sir.

77
00:07:25,798 --> 00:07:27,798
All three of you?

78
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,733
Big snake.

79
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,983
I'm bringing in some coolies
from the east indies.

80
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,818
They'll soon lick this
place into shape.

81
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,186
I wouldn't discuss that

82
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:54,656
in front of the servants
if I were you.

83
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:56,491
I've told him a hundred times.

84
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:58,826
The people here
don't want to work,

85
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,194
so why should they care?

86
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,129
Well, just look at this place.

87
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:04,364
It's enough
to break your heart.

88
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:06,833
It's dangerous to stay here
any longer.

89
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:08,201
I see the signs.

90
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:09,669
You don't know these people.

91
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,804
They're children.

92
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:14,039
They wouldn't hurt a fly.

93
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,840
Unhappily, children
do hurt flies.

94
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,775
Don't you see them watching us,

95
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:20,210
asking the servants
what we eat every day?

96
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:23,846
They're curious, that's all.

97
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:26,782
They're too damn lazy
to be dangerous.

98
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:29,951
They're more alive
than you are, lazy or not,

99
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:31,852
and they can be dangerous
and curious

100
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:33,854
for reasons
you wouldn't understand.

101
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:36,623
No. No, I don't understand.

102
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,693
Now, you're the widow
of a slave owner,

103
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:42,628
here on your own for years,

104
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,797
and they never harmed
a hair on your head.

105
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,241
If you want to go away
for a change, nettie,

106
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,643
by all means, we'll go.

107
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,017
Antoinette, come here.

108
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:17,224
Don't forget to kiss your
stepfather good night.

109
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:19,859
He's very hurt that
you never kiss him.

110
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,227
He never looks hurt.

111
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:23,596
He's told me he's
very fond of you.

112
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:26,999
Perhaps one day he'll
take you to england.

113
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,872
I wonder where
they've all gone.

114
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:38,174
Must be one of those dances on.

115
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,509
You'd hear drums
if there was a dance.

116
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:44,512
Probably a wedding then.

117
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:47,047
Any excuse not to work.

118
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,116
<i>Afterwards I understood,</i>

119
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:52,251
<i>but not then.</i>

120
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:54,920
<i>In front of the servants,</i>

121
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:57,422
<i>he had said</i>
<i>he would bring in coolies</i>

122
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,223
<i>to replace all the workers.</i>

123
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,725
<i>My stepfather knew nothing</i>
<i>of the old hatred</i>

124
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:05,595
<i>between our family</i>
<i>and the former slaves.</i>

125
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,745
Mama!

126
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:04,346
Mama!

127
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:07,749
Antoinette, what is it?

128
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,484
Out! Get out!

129
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:13,120
Manny! Christophene!

130
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:20,826
Oh, my God!

131
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,828
Antoinette!

132
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,963
Antoinette!

133
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:27,965
Take her out of here,

134
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:31,168
and then tell Manny to
bring the carriage.

135
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:38,206
You're hurt. His hands.

136
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,208
His bed was on fire.

137
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,977
You had left him to die.

138
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,647
We'll have to make
a run for it.

139
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,882
I told you over and over,

140
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:52,551
but you sneered at me,
you grinning fool.

141
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:55,053
Why don't you go out there

142
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:57,188
and tell them to let you go?

143
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,956
Say I was the slave owner.

144
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,558
Tell them how you
always trusted them.

145
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,192
Annette, for God's sake!

146
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:05,127
The whole house is burning!

147
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:08,163
Antoinette, stay close to me.

148
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,205
Here they come,

149
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,239
the black witch woman

150
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,140
and her white cockroaches.

151
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:29,645
No. No.

152
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:30,746
Annette!

153
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:33,248
What does she want, her jewels?

154
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,149
Her damn parrot.

155
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:40,754
Annette, they're
laughing at you.

156
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:43,289
Don't let them laugh at you.

157
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,993
Father, which art in heaven,

158
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:49,461
hallowed be thy name,

159
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:50,762
thy kingdom come,

160
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:52,430
thy will be done on earth

161
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:54,298
as it is in heaven.

162
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Give us this day
our daily bread,

163
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:58,802
and lead us not
into temptation,

164
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:00,703
but deliver us from evil...

165
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,540
let us through.

166
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,475
The boy will die
if we don't get help.

167
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:10,010
Black and white burn the same.

168
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:12,846
Here and hereafter,
as you will in your turn.

169
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:14,180
Wish bad luck on me,

170
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:17,649
and I'll cut the tongue
out of your mouth.

171
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,132
God have mercy!

172
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:41,068
Everyone into the
carriage, for God's sake.

173
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:51,711
Go along!

174
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:56,681
Christophene.

175
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:58,049
Christophene.

176
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:26,209
<i>After Pierre died in the fire,</i>

177
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:29,078
<i>my mother went mad with grief.</i>

178
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,581
<i>Mr. Mason hired a man</i>
<i>to look after her,</i>

179
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,083
<i>then he went back to england</i>

180
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:36,851
<i>and forgot her.</i>

181
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:09,214
<i>Oui, ma souer.</i>

182
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:11,149
<i>Merci.</i>

183
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:29,498
Antoinette.

184
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:46,580
Hello, antoinette.

185
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:53,853
A few months
before I left england,

186
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,655
your stepfather died.

187
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,125
Paul wanted you to have
his properties here

188
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,460
so long as you married somebody

189
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,261
who could manage them for you.

190
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:08,631
He arranged it all
with a family in england.

191
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,810
What's happening?

192
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:24,478
They were cutting seaweed
from the rudder,

193
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,012
and one of them
was sucked down.

194
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:28,647
We're on the edge
of the sargasso sea...

195
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:31,950
Miles and Miles
of floating weed,

196
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:33,117
a sailor's graveyard.

197
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>This voyage to Jamaica</i>

198
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,121
<i>has been a nightmare</i>
<i>from the beginning,</i>

199
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,357
<i>and I'm sick with fever.</i>

200
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,360
<i>My father has arranged</i>
<i>a marriage for me</i>

201
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:46,328
<i>with a girl I've never met.</i>

202
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,963
<i>I wonder what</i>
<i>she expects of me.</i>

203
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:51,498
<i>Who knows?</i>

204
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,334
<i>Perhaps we might even</i>
<i>like each other.</i>

205
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:56,469
Edward, good to see you.

206
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,838
You look a little
the worse for wear.

207
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,306
Just a touch of fever.

208
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:01,907
How on earth do you
live in this heat?

209
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:03,842
One gets used to it. Come.

210
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,350
I thought that slavery
had been abolished.

211
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:15,352
Well, they get paid wages now,

212
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:17,987
not that one gets
much thanks for it.

213
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:19,722
They're bone-idle,
most of them.

214
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:22,357
They don't have much
reason to thank us

215
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,093
after kidnapping them
from their own countries.

216
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,865
Here we are.

217
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:16,572
Ahem.

218
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:18,640
Come in.

219
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,652
Edward Rochester...

220
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,756
May I introduce you to my niece

221
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:38,757
antoinette cosway

222
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,426
and her aunt Cora.

223
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,300
How was your journey from
england, Mr. Rochester?

224
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:53,469
The land seems a little bumpy

225
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:54,803
by comparison.

226
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:58,673
I hope you don't
feel too homesick.

227
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:07,279
Bring water!

228
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:08,480
Yes, sir.

229
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,914
Edward. Edward.

230
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,283
Edward?

231
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,798
They seem to be
getting on all right.

232
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,533
I want to know more about him.

233
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:32,268
How do we know he's
not a fortune hunter

234
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,702
who'll marry her
for her properties,

235
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,104
then disappear back to england?

236
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,139
I'd trust him with my life.

237
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:40,207
You're trusting him with
her life, not yours.

238
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:41,808
Why does he need her property

239
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,309
if he comes from such a family?

240
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:45,177
Has he been disinherited?

241
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,179
The estate passed
to his older brother,

242
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:49,181
but he's a damn fine gentleman.

243
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:51,316
There's not
a respectable man here

244
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:52,650
who'd look at her

245
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,818
with a drunken father
and a crazed mother...

246
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,186
she should be
legally protected.

247
00:19:56,188 --> 00:19:58,955
You know absolutely
nothing of these things.

248
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,834
I have something for you...

249
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,202
the little silk bag

250
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:15,970
on the dressing table.

251
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:21,208
They're my rings.

252
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,877
Two of them are valuable.

253
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:25,011
Don't let him see them...

254
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:26,045
Ever.

255
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:27,146
Richard?

256
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:28,847
Richard's a half-wit...

257
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:29,881
hard as a board

258
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:31,382
and stupid as a foot.

259
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:33,750
I mean your future husband,

260
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:35,518
this honorable englishman

261
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,386
we know absolutely
nothing about...

262
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:40,155
Apart from his partiality
to fainting.

263
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,325
Does he know about me?

264
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,526
He knows what he needs to know.

265
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:51,395
Perhaps I shouldn't marry him.

266
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:54,164
My dear, you have no choice.

267
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,429
She's decided.

268
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,397
She's not going to marry you.

269
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,766
I can't say I'm surprised

270
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:34,267
after my spectacular entrance.

271
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:35,568
But everything's arranged...

272
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,870
the church, the
minister, the guests.

273
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:39,471
It's just as Paul wanted.

274
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:40,605
You can't drag her
to the altar,

275
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:41,639
you know, Richard.

276
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:43,641
I feel very badly,

277
00:21:43,643 --> 00:21:46,477
bringing you halfway around
the world for nothing.

278
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,046
She seems gracious.

279
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,381
Perhaps she'll
let me try again.

280
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:56,752
I've been taking
some deep breaths.

281
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:57,753
I think I might be able

282
00:21:57,755 --> 00:21:59,454
to keep my feet this time.

283
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:05,292
I am hoping you may
reconsider your decision.

284
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:08,395
I'm afraid of what may happen

285
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:10,230
if I become your wife.

286
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,065
What do you mean?

287
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,833
You don't know me,

288
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,801
and I cannot live in the town

289
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,135
like an English lady.

290
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,670
The way we live is
so very different.

291
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,439
We can live wherever you want.

292
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,275
When I was a child,

293
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,443
there was a house
in the mountains...

294
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:32,214
And I used to go there
with my mother.

295
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:35,083
Then that's where we'll go.

296
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:37,617
Antoinette...

297
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:40,853
I do want you to be my wife.

298
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:42,921
I know how you feel.

299
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:44,689
We're complete strangers

300
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:48,059
from opposite sides
of the world,

301
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:50,061
but I will trust you

302
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:52,196
if you'll trust me.

303
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,952
How is your hand so cold

304
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:19,453
in this hot sun?

305
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,455
I was born in it.

306
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:36,327
Mountain water.

307
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:41,965
That's delicious.

308
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:44,400
Amelie was born
in colibri like me.

309
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:47,035
So she was a slave.

310
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:49,237
I suppose so...

311
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,571
But not for long.

312
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:51,638
She was sent here

313
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,407
to work at the summer house.

314
00:24:58,445 --> 00:25:00,478
It's not exactly
england, is it?

315
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Oh, england, england...

316
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:04,748
Is it really there?

317
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:44,586
Double up, now, double up.

318
00:25:51,494 --> 00:25:55,294
Mr. Rochester,
this is Nelson...

319
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:56,428
Rose...

320
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,263
Hilda...

321
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,465
And amelie you know.

322
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:03,067
How do you do?

323
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:06,937
This is a grateful day
for all of us, sir,

324
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:09,306
and we hope you'll
be happy here with us.

325
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:11,308
Ever since the good news,

326
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,777
we've been trying to get
everything in place.

327
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,381
The house has been lonely
for many years...

328
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:19,815
A home for spiders,

329
00:26:19,817 --> 00:26:20,816
centipedes,

330
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:22,417
and bats.

331
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:23,651
We got rid of them,

332
00:26:23,653 --> 00:26:26,320
and the house is ready
to welcome you.

333
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:31,724
I hope you'll be
specially happy, sir,

334
00:26:31,726 --> 00:26:34,793
in your sweet honeymoon home.

335
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:36,494
And this is christophene,

336
00:26:36,496 --> 00:26:38,395
who was my<i> da...</i>

337
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,398
my nurse... long ago.

338
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,080
<i>She took childlike pride</i>
<i>in showing me the house,</i>

339
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:00,515
<i>but I couldn't understand</i>
<i>her pleasure in it.</i>

340
00:27:00,517 --> 00:27:02,450
<i>It seemed neglected and bare,</i>

341
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:04,151
<i>not ugly but awkward.</i>

342
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:05,819
<i>A little sad,</i>

343
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:08,520
<i>as though it knew</i>
<i>it couldn't last.</i>

344
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:10,421
To happiness.

345
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:11,688
Happiness.

346
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,103
Now you're an emperor.

347
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:31,938
It's only christophene.

348
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,606
Only christophene?

349
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:36,108
She's the most ferocious-looking
creature I've ever seen.

350
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,311
Well, hide in here
until she's gone.

351
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:52,223
<i>Dear father,</i>

352
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:56,160
<i>the £30,000 has been paid to me
without question or condition.</i>

353
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:59,296
<i>I'll never be a disgrace</i>
<i>to you or my dear brother,</i>

354
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:01,331
<i>the son that you love.</i>

355
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,000
<i>I have property now</i>
<i>at the edge of the world.</i>

356
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:05,468
Don't do that to my hair.

357
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,535
He doesn't like it.

358
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:13,174
Every man likes scent
on his wedding night.

359
00:28:13,176 --> 00:28:16,143
With this scent, he'll remember
it the rest of his life...

360
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:18,578
And you...

361
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,414
Kiss first... And long.

362
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:25,483
Everything else will follow.

363
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:51,507
You can go now, Nelson.

364
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:03,685
I'll have to shout
to get above that noise.

365
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:04,919
Whisper.

366
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,954
I'll hear you.

367
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:09,088
I know we're far away,

368
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,056
but in that dress...

369
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:13,525
You look almost English.

370
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:14,893
It's French.

371
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:17,428
Aunt Cora had it made
for me in Saint-Pierre.

372
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,462
You say Saint-Pierre

373
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,896
as if it were Paris.

374
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:23,199
You've hardly eaten.

375
00:29:23,201 --> 00:29:24,934
It's too hot.

376
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:28,203
In england, the cold
gives you an appetite.

377
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:30,538
How strange to be
cold all the time.

378
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,141
Is it true that england
is like a dream?

379
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:37,210
I read in this book
that this place London

380
00:29:37,212 --> 00:29:40,379
is like a cold, dark dream.

381
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:43,882
This place feels
like a dream to me.

382
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,304
They'll come back if we
don't put the candles out.

383
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:29,991
I feel as though I'm on
the edge of the world.

384
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:39,499
One night...

385
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:41,133
There was a full moon,

386
00:30:41,135 --> 00:30:43,135
and I watched it
for a long time

387
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:44,936
before I fell asleep.

388
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:47,838
Christophene found me
in the morning.

389
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,440
She said, "it's very bad
to sleep in the moonlight

390
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:52,174
when the moon is full."

391
00:30:54,244 --> 00:30:56,844
Do you think she was right?

392
00:30:56,846 --> 00:31:00,614
Had I slept too long
in the moonlight?

393
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:09,188
Wait.

394
00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:11,289
Wait.

395
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,824
Wait.

396
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,626
Wait.

397
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,206
Now.

398
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:35,208
Now.

399
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:52,155
It's christophene.

400
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:54,323
I had to send her away twice.

401
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:56,224
Come in now.

402
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:03,697
Good morning.

403
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:06,032
Good morning, christophene.

404
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:10,902
Taste my bull's blood,
master...

405
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:14,538
Not horse piss like
the English madams' drink.

406
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,374
Drink, drink
their yellow horse piss.

407
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:20,276
Talk, talk their lyin' talk.

408
00:32:23,781 --> 00:32:25,547
I'll send the girl
to clean the mess you make

409
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:26,748
with the frangipani.

410
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,283
Be careful not to
step on the flowers.

411
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:31,752
It brings cockroaches.

412
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,465
Her coffee may be delicious,

413
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:47,866
but she might
hold up her dress.

414
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:51,269
It must get as filthy
as her language.

415
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,803
It's for respect

416
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,037
or a feast day.

417
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,072
And is this a feast day?

418
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,907
She wanted it to be.

419
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,108
Don't you like her?

420
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,311
I don't like the way
she dawdles about.

421
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,979
Well, she seems so,

422
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:07,216
but every move
she makes is right,

423
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,219
so it's quick in the end.

424
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,222
I don't think I'll
get up this morning.

425
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,024
What do you mean?

426
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:18,192
I'm very lazy, you know...

427
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:20,194
Like christophene.

428
00:33:20,196 --> 00:33:23,330
I often stay in bed all day.

429
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:27,367
So you go to the pool

430
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:30,036
before it gets too hot.

431
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:32,071
Benbow will take you.

432
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:51,255
How are you all today?

433
00:33:51,257 --> 00:33:54,191
Very tired, sir.

434
00:33:54,193 --> 00:33:56,193
Are you very tired?

435
00:34:21,252 --> 00:34:23,719
Darling, what on earth
are you doing?

436
00:34:25,322 --> 00:34:28,056
Will you please
take off my clothes?

437
00:34:28,058 --> 00:34:31,158
Antoinette, I'm going
to need those clothes.

438
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:36,095
Please, darling, will you
take my clothes off?

439
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,596
I'm warning you.

440
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:39,664
You want them? Here!

441
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:40,898
Aah!

442
00:34:42,935 --> 00:34:44,067
Aah!

443
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:27,641
Thank you. I think we
can manage now, Nelson.

444
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,275
Yes, sir. Hilda.

445
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,615
Do you honestly not mind the
servants laughing at us?

446
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:39,150
Oh, don't be angry with me.

447
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:43,019
These were part of
a pirate treasure.

448
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:45,221
They probably used them
in drunken orgies.

449
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:49,391
They lived like that because every
voyage might be their last.

450
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:51,393
Then they buried their treasure

451
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:53,395
and dreamed that one day

452
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:56,030
they'll come back
and live like kings.

453
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,333
I read about pirates
when I was a child.

454
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:01,335
Maybe my father was one.

455
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:03,136
Tell me about your father.

456
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:07,173
Oh, he died before I
could even remember him.

457
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:10,376
So you were left with your
mother and christophene.

458
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,711
Yes.

459
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:17,348
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to upset you.

460
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,416
No more stories.

461
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:48,456
<i>Aah!</i>

462
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,857
<i>Ahh!</i>

463
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:36,502
I try to make you think
they're not true,

464
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:40,272
but to scare you,
you know better.

465
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:05,362
It always thunders,
but it never rains.

466
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:08,130
It's coming in a week or two.

467
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,434
I know he's there.

468
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,268
Who?

469
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,136
The king of the pool.

470
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,104
That's where he always lived.

471
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:27,646
Out of the way, quick.

472
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:29,948
Quick. Quick!

473
00:41:35,054 --> 00:41:37,621
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

474
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:41,057
What would my friends in
england think of you?

475
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:42,825
Would they like me?

476
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:45,227
They'd think you're
a wild creature...

477
00:41:45,229 --> 00:41:47,062
Untamed...

478
00:41:47,064 --> 00:41:49,164
Mrs. Rochester.

479
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:03,578
¶ Pull down the moon ¶

480
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,047
¶ love in the dark... ¶

481
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:08,582
<i>no matter how close</i>
<i>we are in the dark,</i>

482
00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:11,051
<i>she is still</i>
<i>a stranger to me...</i>

483
00:42:11,053 --> 00:42:16,089
<i>A stranger who does not</i>
<i>think or feel as I do.</i>

484
00:42:16,091 --> 00:42:17,690
<i>I am hungry for her,</i>

485
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:19,658
<i>but I don't understand her.</i>

486
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,427
Why do you make me
want to live?

487
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:26,029
What do you mean?

488
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:28,064
Suppose you took
this happiness away

489
00:42:28,066 --> 00:42:29,265
when I wasn't looking.

490
00:42:29,267 --> 00:42:30,399
And lose my own?

491
00:42:30,401 --> 00:42:33,935
I'm not used to happiness.

492
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:35,236
It makes me afraid.

493
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:37,738
But I'm here.

494
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,699
<i>The six weeks I've been</i>
<i>here could be a year.</i>

495
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:12,135
<i>I feel like I'm floating</i>
<i>in an opium dream.</i>

496
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:15,705
<i>This climate...</i>

497
00:43:15,707 --> 00:43:18,374
Now it rains every day
at the same time.

498
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:19,975
Like clockwork.

499
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:22,944
That way everybody knows how
long they can stay in bed.

500
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:30,917
You'll be the death of me.

501
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:34,320
Josephine spent
most of her life in bed.

502
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:37,323
She came from Martinique,
like my mother,

503
00:43:37,325 --> 00:43:42,227
and she became empress
of all France.

504
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,396
Close your eyes.

505
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:54,604
What's wrong?

506
00:43:54,606 --> 00:43:56,238
I just don't like that fruit.

507
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,139
It seems squishy and overripe.

508
00:43:58,141 --> 00:44:00,107
You're so English.

509
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:01,241
What else would I be?

510
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:03,176
You could be like me...

511
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:06,479
French, welsh, a little Irish,

512
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:08,247
a little pirate.

513
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:10,249
My little outcast.

514
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:42,980
Is it possible
to die of happiness?

515
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,785
If I could die now
when I'm happy,

516
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,987
you wouldn't have to kill me.

517
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,990
Just say it.

518
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,057
Try.

519
00:44:57,393 --> 00:45:00,794
Say die, and watch me die.

520
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:06,564
Die, then.

521
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,333
Die.

522
00:45:11,903 --> 00:45:13,002
Die.

523
00:45:26,283 --> 00:45:29,050
Good morning, master.

524
00:45:29,052 --> 00:45:30,217
Good morning, amelie.

525
00:45:30,219 --> 00:45:33,086
It came for you early, sir.

526
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,690
Thank you.

527
00:45:38,692 --> 00:45:40,224
Amelie...

528
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:45,495
Is anything wrong,
christophene?

529
00:45:45,497 --> 00:45:47,063
Nothing wrong.

530
00:45:47,065 --> 00:45:50,099
You will tell me
if there is, won't you?

531
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:51,500
Yes, master.

532
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,179
<i>"Dear sir,</i>

533
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:08,048
<i>"you have been</i>
<i>shamefully deceived.</i>

534
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,551
<i>"Your wife's father</i>

535
00:46:11,553 --> 00:46:14,253

536
00:46:14,255 --> 00:46:17,389

537
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:22,026
<i>"Her mother... she had the madness

538
00:46:22,028 --> 00:46:25,362

539
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:34,636
<i>"I hear that she</i>

00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:48,781
<i>Did you know, father,</i>

542
00:46:48,783 --> 00:46:51,083
<i>Did you plan it together?</i>

<i>Richard Mason,</i>

544
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:58,222
<i>But my wife...</i>

545
00:46:58,224 --> 00:47:01,758
<i>How little I really</i>
<i>knew of her.</i>

546
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:36,350
Come and dance.

547
00:48:36,352 --> 00:48:39,252
No, thank you.

548
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:57,034
<i>"My mother marry again</i>
<i>with rich englishman</i>

549
00:48:57,036 --> 00:48:58,602
<i>"who give her the moon,</i>

550
00:48:58,604 --> 00:49:01,171
<i>"but her madness get worse.</i>

551
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:05,074
<i>He has to lock her away</i>
<i>and run back to england..."</i>

552
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:06,942
Is something wrong?

553
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,277
No.

554
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,912
Who were all those people
there this afternoon?

555
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:14,682
Oh, cousins, nephews,
and nieces.

556
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,452
Are you missing your england?

557
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:21,954
My england is always
there if I want it!

558
00:49:32,432 --> 00:49:34,165
I'm sorry.

559
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:44,040
You never told me what
happened to your mother.

560
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:45,875
There was a fire.

561
00:49:45,877 --> 00:49:47,343
You know about the fire.

562
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:49,478
Yes.

563
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,746
She died then.

564
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,815
I'm sorry.

565
00:49:57,685 --> 00:50:00,185
I won't bring it up again...

566
00:50:00,187 --> 00:50:01,319
I promise.

567
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:02,353
Never make promises.

568
00:50:02,355 --> 00:50:03,420
What did you say?

569
00:50:03,422 --> 00:50:04,754
Never make promises!

570
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:05,855
Why?

571
00:50:05,857 --> 00:50:07,823
Then they'll never be broken.

572
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:27,708
<i>She will look you in the eye</i>

573
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,509
<i>and tell you lies.</i>

574
00:51:28,066 --> 00:51:33,569
Not so hard.

575
00:51:33,571 --> 00:51:35,671
Die.

576
00:51:35,673 --> 00:51:37,606
Die!

577
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:39,007
Oh...

578
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:40,742
Die!

579
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:21,615
What am I doing hurting you?

580
00:52:26,621 --> 00:52:28,621
It's all right.

581
00:52:35,462 --> 00:52:37,562
I'm sorry.

582
00:52:37,564 --> 00:52:39,497
I'm sorry.

583
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:44,834
I don't know what came
over me, antoinette.

584
00:52:44,836 --> 00:52:47,503
I feel so ashamed.

585
00:53:10,326 --> 00:53:14,094
But he must have
said something.

586
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:16,162
Did he say when he'd be back?

587
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:20,098
He didn't say anything
about when he'd be back.

588
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,000
You should have asked him.

589
00:53:23,002 --> 00:53:25,736
Now go.

590
00:53:29,975 --> 00:53:31,774
Edward...

591
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:34,610
You will stay for the
weekend, won't you?

592
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:37,245
Governor's having a small
soiree on Saturday.

593
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:40,214
You know, it's a pity
antoinette didn't come.

594
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,716
Her mother was
a beautiful dancer.

595
00:53:42,718 --> 00:53:45,452
That's something I've been
meaning to ask you about.

596
00:53:45,454 --> 00:53:47,454
Whatever happened
to her mother?

597
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:50,557
Nettie? Oh, she died
shortly after the fire.

598
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:51,891
She was very badly burned

599
00:53:51,893 --> 00:53:53,893
trying to save her little boy.

600
00:53:53,895 --> 00:53:57,128
Now, I never knew that
antoinette had a brother.

601
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:00,430
Well, she never talks
of him, of course,

602
00:54:00,432 --> 00:54:01,898
having lost him like that.

603
00:54:05,336 --> 00:54:08,236
Off to england, probably.

604
00:54:08,238 --> 00:54:10,972
I rather envy them.

605
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:57,149
How are you faring out in
the wilds, Mr. Rochester?

606
00:54:57,151 --> 00:54:58,750
England seems far away.

607
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:02,487
Is that obeah woman still with you?
What's her name?

608
00:55:02,489 --> 00:55:06,190
Christophene... apparently she was a
wedding present to antoinette's mother.

609
00:55:06,192 --> 00:55:08,492
What is this word "obeah"?

610
00:55:08,494 --> 00:55:11,695
Voodoo they call it
in Haiti. Here it's obeah.

611
00:55:11,697 --> 00:55:15,331
They're supposed to make potions
that bring back the dead.

612
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:18,534
A lot of nonsense. I'm sure
your wife would agree.

613
00:55:18,536 --> 00:55:21,336
Not necessarily. Most of the
natives believe it completely.

614
00:55:21,338 --> 00:55:23,871
Antoinette obviously
prefers the open air

615
00:55:23,873 --> 00:55:27,040
to our stuffy little society
down here in Spanish town.

616
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:29,776
She'd be a most welcome
addition to our dances,

617
00:55:29,778 --> 00:55:33,045
but she isn't English.
She might feel left out.

618
00:55:33,047 --> 00:55:34,546
Oh, I don't know.

619
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:37,482
Many of the best dances
were invented by the French.

620
00:55:37,484 --> 00:55:39,317
Yes. Come, Edward.

621
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:42,786
We must do our duty
by the wallflowers.

622
00:55:42,788 --> 00:55:44,053
Ahem.

623
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:29,762
Apparently they had
snow at home at Noel.

624
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:31,163
It amuses me
how all of you here

625
00:56:31,165 --> 00:56:32,697
talk of england as home.

626
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:36,166
Have you ever
actually been there?

627
00:56:36,168 --> 00:56:37,267
No, not yet.

628
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:40,370
Mummy plans to
take me next year.

629
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:42,672
She hopes to
present me at court,

630
00:56:42,674 --> 00:56:44,407
if we can afford it.

631
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:47,743
Sadly, our situation
is not what it was.

632
00:56:47,745 --> 00:56:49,745
But surely, as you were
born in this country,

633
00:56:49,747 --> 00:56:51,046
this is your home.

634
00:56:51,048 --> 00:56:53,515
Certainly not, Mr. Rochester!

635
00:56:53,517 --> 00:56:54,949
Even in the good times,

636
00:56:54,951 --> 00:56:58,018
it was no fit place for a lady.

637
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,218
Oh!

638
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:04,556
You're supposed to lead!

639
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:06,758
1, 2, 3. 1...

640
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,760
how can you be a gentleman

641
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:11,395
when you smell like a horse?

642
00:57:11,397 --> 00:57:13,797
Benbow? Benbow.

643
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:15,632
Rub him down well, will you?

644
00:57:15,634 --> 00:57:16,766
I've ridden him hard.

645
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:18,634
Good to be back.

646
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:19,935
Good afternoon, sir.

647
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:20,936
Afternoon, hilda.

648
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:22,237
How was your journey, sir?

649
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:24,239
Very good, thank you.

650
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:25,640
Ladies.

651
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,159
Finish quickly

652
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:48,761
and go tell christophene
I want her.

653
00:57:48,763 --> 00:57:50,763
Christophene is leaving.

654
00:57:50,765 --> 00:57:53,465
Leaving?

655
00:57:53,467 --> 00:57:57,001
Christophene don't like this
sweet honeymoon house no more...

656
00:57:57,003 --> 00:58:00,671
And your husband
look like he see zombie.

657
00:58:00,673 --> 00:58:04,441
Maybe he don't like honeymoon
house no more, either.

658
00:58:07,212 --> 00:58:09,745
Oh! I hit you back,
white cockroach!

659
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:12,513
For God's sake, antoinette!

660
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:15,982
Go away, child!

661
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:17,350
Child?

662
00:58:17,352 --> 00:58:20,152
She's older than the
devil and more cruel!

663
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:21,853
Fetch christophene!

664
00:58:21,855 --> 00:58:23,020
Yes, master.

665
00:58:28,594 --> 00:58:31,294
It's past midday!

666
00:58:31,296 --> 00:58:34,330
¶ The white cockroach,
she marry ¶

667
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:37,599
¶ the white cockroach,
she like englishman ¶

668
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:40,835
¶ the white cockroach,
she marry ¶

669
00:58:40,837 --> 00:58:43,771
¶ the white cockroach,
she like englishman... ¶

670
00:58:43,773 --> 00:58:45,172
you're not leaving!

671
00:58:45,174 --> 00:58:46,306
I am.

672
00:58:46,308 --> 00:58:47,540
And what about me?

673
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:49,041
Get up and dress!

674
00:58:49,043 --> 00:58:52,310
Woman must have sparks
to live in this world.

675
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:53,844
The young master don't like me,

676
00:58:53,846 --> 00:58:56,179
and perhaps I don't like him.

677
00:58:56,181 --> 00:58:57,880
If I stay, I bring trouble

678
00:58:57,882 --> 00:59:00,382
and bone of contention
to your house.

679
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:01,549
Then go.

680
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:05,185
Amelie?

681
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:09,155
Smile like that once
more, just once more,

682
00:59:09,157 --> 00:59:11,657
and I'll mash your face
like a mashed plant.

683
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:13,058
You hear me?

684
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,327
I give you a bellyache
like you never see.

685
00:59:16,329 --> 00:59:17,828
Answer me, girl!

686
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,629
Yes, christophene.

687
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,899
Now, poutos...

688
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:26,233
You get yourself out of bed.

689
00:59:28,937 --> 00:59:31,470
Did you hear what
the girl was singing?

690
00:59:31,472 --> 00:59:34,506
White cockroach... that's me.

691
00:59:34,508 --> 00:59:36,908
That's what they call
all of us who were here

692
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:41,679
before their own people sold
them to the slave traders.

693
00:59:41,681 --> 00:59:45,215
Why are you looking
at me like that?

694
00:59:45,217 --> 00:59:46,816
Get out.

695
00:59:46,818 --> 00:59:49,184
I want to get dressed.

696
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,755
I want to get dressed
for dinner.

697
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:13,005
Why did you go away
without telling me?

698
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:14,973
Hello...

699
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,375
Nettie.

700
01:00:17,377 --> 01:00:19,844
That was my mother's name.

701
01:00:19,846 --> 01:00:21,545
It suits you.

702
01:00:22,948 --> 01:00:24,814
No. Sit with me.

703
01:00:35,059 --> 01:00:38,559
I'm sorry. I haven't
been myself lately.

704
01:00:41,063 --> 01:00:43,896
This country's still
so strange to me.

705
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,499
Sometimes I feel as though

706
01:00:47,501 --> 01:00:49,300
I may lose myself in it.

707
01:00:51,103 --> 01:00:54,737
You'll go back
to england, won't you?

708
01:01:02,946 --> 01:01:06,314
I rather feel like
a walk in the garden.

709
01:01:18,127 --> 01:01:21,494
I can hardly hear
the insects now.

710
01:01:23,831 --> 01:01:27,833
Perhaps I am getting used
to everything after all.

711
01:01:30,971 --> 01:01:33,037
Let's toast again...

712
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:35,105
To happiness.

713
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,380
Sorry, sir. The mistress
gone to pay a visit.

714
01:02:18,382 --> 01:02:19,748
She'll be back tonight.

715
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,749
She make up her mind
in a hurry, and she gone.

716
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:25,252
Thank you.

717
01:02:41,002 --> 01:02:43,836
Do you know this man?

718
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:46,138
Yes. I know Daniel.

719
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,606
Why does he write to me?

720
01:02:47,608 --> 01:02:51,409
He write you two letters
and he don't say why?

721
01:02:53,546 --> 01:02:55,779
Is his name really cosway?

722
01:02:55,781 --> 01:02:59,082
Some people say yes,
some people say no.

723
01:02:59,084 --> 01:03:02,018
Some people say there are
many people called cosway.

724
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,019
They are related.

725
01:03:05,889 --> 01:03:08,155
But I don't know about that.

726
01:03:10,225 --> 01:03:11,991
You may go.

727
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:15,193
I am sorry for you.

728
01:03:15,195 --> 01:03:16,260
What?

729
01:03:16,262 --> 01:03:19,496
I say nothing, master.

730
01:03:23,635 --> 01:03:25,001
You ask me a hard thing,

731
01:03:25,003 --> 01:03:26,369
I'll tell you a hard thing.

732
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:28,170
Pack up and go.

733
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:29,437
When a man don't love you,

734
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:31,672
more you try, more he hate you.

735
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:36,776
A rich girl like you...
pick up and walk out.

736
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:37,810
He come after you.

737
01:03:37,812 --> 01:03:39,812
He wouldn't come after me,

738
01:03:39,814 --> 01:03:41,547
and I'm not rich.

739
01:03:41,549 --> 01:03:44,216
Everything I have belongs to him.
That's English law.

740
01:03:44,218 --> 01:03:46,184
Law? Ha!

741
01:03:46,186 --> 01:03:48,653
That Mason boy do it.

742
01:03:48,655 --> 01:03:51,656
Him worse than Satan himself.

743
01:04:27,757 --> 01:04:28,822
Daniel cosway?

744
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:30,690
Yes, sir.

745
01:04:30,692 --> 01:04:33,025
Why did you ignore my message

746
01:04:33,027 --> 01:04:34,393
to stop writing to me?

747
01:04:34,395 --> 01:04:37,562
Many people say things
behind your back.

748
01:04:37,564 --> 01:04:40,197
I don't care what people
say behind my back.

749
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:42,098
Oh, but you do, sir.

750
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,266
You mind very much.

751
01:04:44,268 --> 01:04:46,835
They make monkey
out of you... I mind.

752
01:04:46,837 --> 01:04:48,937
You're a troublemaker,
Daniel cosway...

753
01:04:48,939 --> 01:04:50,738
If that's your real name.

754
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:53,941
Same name as your
wife... Same father.

755
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:55,709
Oh, yes, sir.

756
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:58,444
Everything I say is true.

757
01:05:00,114 --> 01:05:04,782
Ask that devil Richard
Mason three questions.

758
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:08,252
Is your wife's mother
a lunatic?

759
01:05:08,254 --> 01:05:11,355
Was her brother
a born imbecile?

760
01:05:11,357 --> 01:05:13,890
And is your wife
going the same way

761
01:05:13,892 --> 01:05:15,424
as her mother?

762
01:05:15,426 --> 01:05:17,224
Is her mother alive?

763
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:20,627
Last I hear,

764
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:23,029
she live in a house
on the hill,

765
01:05:23,031 --> 01:05:25,564
taking in any man who asks...

766
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,432
And your wife...

767
01:05:30,235 --> 01:05:32,401
Same seeds in her.

768
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,270
Take a look.

769
01:05:35,272 --> 01:05:37,605
See the sign!

770
01:05:37,607 --> 01:05:39,974
Fine English gentleman like you

771
01:05:39,976 --> 01:05:42,609
don't want to touch
a little yellow rat

772
01:05:42,611 --> 01:05:44,077
like me, huh?

773
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,546
You believe me, but you
want everything quiet

774
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:48,881
like the English do. All right.

775
01:05:48,883 --> 01:05:50,082
But if I keep quiet,

776
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:53,452
it seems like
you owe me something.

777
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:57,088
What's £500 to you?

778
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,123
Huh?

779
01:06:01,727 --> 01:06:03,460
All right!

780
01:06:03,462 --> 01:06:06,930
Get back to your wife's
house, my sister's house!

781
01:06:06,932 --> 01:06:10,300
You will see what I can do!

782
01:06:10,302 --> 01:06:12,302
And give her my love.

783
01:06:12,304 --> 01:06:16,438
You are not the first
to kiss her pretty face.

784
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,174
You knew what I wanted
as soon as you saw me.

785
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,476
Hush up!

786
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:24,111
If a man don't love you,
I can't make him.

787
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:27,114
You can make people
love or hate or die.

788
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,584
You believe that tin-tin
story about obeah?

789
01:06:32,354 --> 01:06:36,421
If he would come to me
just once more...

790
01:06:36,423 --> 01:06:39,357
I'd make him love me again.

791
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:43,027
Poutos...

792
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:46,497
Obeah is too strong
for a white man.

793
01:06:46,499 --> 01:06:49,332
It would only cause
big trouble.

794
01:06:50,935 --> 01:06:53,302
When the people
tell your husband stories

795
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:55,304
about you and your mother,

796
01:06:55,306 --> 01:06:58,674
him don't know what to believe.

797
01:06:58,676 --> 01:07:01,677
Cool him. Calm him.

798
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:04,646
Tell him all that
happened, but don't cry.

799
01:07:04,648 --> 01:07:06,681
Crying's no good with him.

800
01:07:06,683 --> 01:07:08,949
He wouldn't believe me.

801
01:07:30,238 --> 01:07:31,971
I'll do what you ask me

802
01:07:31,973 --> 01:07:34,707
but only if you talk
to him first.

803
01:07:53,426 --> 01:07:54,725
You want to know
about my mother

804
01:07:54,727 --> 01:07:57,761
because of what
Daniel tells you.

805
01:07:57,763 --> 01:08:02,531
She wasn't mad. She was lonely.

806
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:05,267
That can be a kind of madness.

807
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:08,536
After the fire, my
stepfather bought a house

808
01:08:08,538 --> 01:08:11,705
and hired someone
to look after her.

809
01:08:11,707 --> 01:08:15,374
And then he forgot her.

810
01:08:15,376 --> 01:08:17,409
Is she still alive?

811
01:08:19,112 --> 01:08:22,746
She died not long ago.

812
01:08:22,748 --> 01:08:26,616
You told me she died
after the fire!

813
01:08:28,286 --> 01:08:29,418
You lied!

814
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:32,788
Because they told me to say so!

815
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,389
And it's true!

816
01:08:34,391 --> 01:08:37,925
There are always two deaths...

817
01:08:37,927 --> 01:08:41,295
the real one and
the one people see.

818
01:08:46,534 --> 01:08:47,900
<i>Have a drink.</i>

819
01:08:53,474 --> 01:08:55,474
<i>Ha ha ha.</i>

820
01:08:55,476 --> 01:08:57,275
Come here.

821
01:09:34,613 --> 01:09:37,747
I've tried to
make you understand,

822
01:09:37,749 --> 01:09:40,516
but nothing's changed, has it?

823
01:09:43,854 --> 01:09:46,487
Where did you go this morning?

824
01:09:49,558 --> 01:09:51,924
To see christophene.

825
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:57,828
To ask her what to do?

826
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:00,797
She told me to leave you.

827
01:10:00,799 --> 01:10:03,699
Don't you think that might
be the best thing...

828
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:07,502
If one of us went
away for a while?

829
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,689
Your mouth is colder
than my hands.

830
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:12,598
Darling, I didn't mean it

831
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,299
when I said
one of us should leave.

832
01:11:14,301 --> 01:11:16,134
I don't want that.

833
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:20,004
We're letting
ghosts trouble us.

834
01:11:20,006 --> 01:11:23,474
We can be happy. I know we can.

835
01:11:42,227 --> 01:11:44,293
<i>I swear, before I drank,</i>

836
01:11:44,295 --> 01:11:46,528
<i>I longed to bury my face</i>
<i>in her hair</i>

837
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:47,729
<i>as I used to do.</i>

838
01:11:49,265 --> 01:11:51,965
<i>She need not have done</i>
<i>what she did to me.</i>

839
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:54,734
<i>I'll always swear that.</i>

840
01:11:54,736 --> 01:11:57,703
<i>She need not have done it.</i>

841
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,860
Amelie!

842
01:14:02,862 --> 01:14:06,763
Amelie, bring me some water!

843
01:14:27,818 --> 01:14:30,051
I am sorry for you.

844
01:14:38,828 --> 01:14:41,194
I am sorry for you.

845
01:14:43,064 --> 01:14:45,998
Is that the only song you know?

846
01:16:43,913 --> 01:16:47,447
I'll be leaving
the island soon, amelie,

847
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:50,283
and I would like
to give you a present.

848
01:16:58,359 --> 01:16:59,991
What are you going to do?

849
01:16:59,993 --> 01:17:03,361
Since a long time,
I know what I want,

850
01:17:03,363 --> 01:17:05,363
but I know I don't get it here.

851
01:17:05,365 --> 01:17:08,132
You're beautiful enough
to get anything you want.

852
01:17:08,134 --> 01:17:10,267
I go to Rio.

853
01:17:10,269 --> 01:17:13,036
Rich men in Rio.

854
01:17:13,038 --> 01:17:17,940
And when do you plan
to start this journey?

855
01:17:17,942 --> 01:17:20,174
Tomorrow.

856
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:24,811
Nothing to stay here for.

857
01:17:24,813 --> 01:17:26,445
I think you're leaving

858
01:17:26,447 --> 01:17:28,647
because you're frightened
of christophene.

859
01:17:30,717 --> 01:17:33,784
I have malice for no one.

860
01:17:35,788 --> 01:17:38,321
Are you still sorry for me?

861
01:17:38,323 --> 01:17:40,690
Yes, I am sorry for you,

862
01:17:40,692 --> 01:17:43,325
but I find it in my heart

863
01:17:43,327 --> 01:17:46,194
to be sorry for her, too.

864
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:07,548
Nelson?

865
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,252
Nelson?

866
01:18:16,357 --> 01:18:18,357
Nelson?

867
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:19,725
Yes?

868
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:22,194
Do you know where
the mistress went?

869
01:18:22,196 --> 01:18:23,828
She didn't say.

870
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,830
Have the cook make some lunch.

871
01:18:25,832 --> 01:18:27,865
Benbow can bring it to me
at the bathing pool.

872
01:18:27,867 --> 01:18:29,166
Cook gone.

873
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:30,667
What?

874
01:18:30,669 --> 01:18:33,770
Says she don't want
to work here no more.

875
01:18:33,772 --> 01:18:35,404
I see.

876
01:18:35,406 --> 01:18:38,273
Then the young girl
can make it.

877
01:18:38,275 --> 01:18:40,275
She not feeling good.

878
01:18:40,277 --> 01:18:43,344
Well, I'm sure you
can sort something out.

879
01:20:03,292 --> 01:20:05,659
This came from england.

880
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:24,809
My brother has been killed
in a riding accident.

881
01:20:26,813 --> 01:20:30,781
It means the family
estate belongs to me.

882
01:20:36,554 --> 01:20:37,886
No.

883
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,220
No more.

884
01:20:52,901 --> 01:20:55,334
I'll go find christophene.

885
01:20:59,907 --> 01:21:02,507
I rang the bell
because I was thirsty.

886
01:21:02,509 --> 01:21:03,508
Can nobody hear?

887
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,876
Will you stop drinking?

888
01:21:04,878 --> 01:21:06,510
And who are you
to tell me what to do?

889
01:21:06,512 --> 01:21:08,745
Christophene!

890
01:21:08,747 --> 01:21:10,847
I won't have her in my house!

891
01:21:10,849 --> 01:21:12,582
So it's your house now?

892
01:21:12,584 --> 01:21:13,749
I thought you
liked the black people,

893
01:21:13,751 --> 01:21:17,085
but you like
the light-brown girls.

894
01:21:17,087 --> 01:21:20,555
You blamed the old planters,
but you do the same thing.

895
01:21:20,557 --> 01:21:22,757
Slavery was not a matter
of liking or disliking.

896
01:21:22,759 --> 01:21:24,759
It was a question of justice.

897
01:21:24,761 --> 01:21:26,227
Justice?

898
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:28,829
My mother, whom
you all talk about,

899
01:21:28,831 --> 01:21:31,331
what justice did she have...

900
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:32,565
My mother?

901
01:21:32,567 --> 01:21:36,869
What in God's name
are you talking about?

902
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:38,070
Nettie!

903
01:21:38,072 --> 01:21:41,073
Nettie is not my name.

904
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:43,508
You're trying to turn me
into someone else.

905
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:45,576
That's obeah!

906
01:21:51,684 --> 01:21:52,783
I love this place.

907
01:21:52,785 --> 01:21:56,619
You've spoiled it.

908
01:21:56,621 --> 01:21:58,621
And I hate it now,

909
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:01,023
like I hate you.

910
01:22:01,025 --> 01:22:02,691
And before I die,

911
01:22:02,693 --> 01:22:05,126
I'll show you
how much I hate you.

912
01:22:09,698 --> 01:22:12,297
Don't you love me at all?

913
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:16,700
No, I do not...

914
01:22:16,702 --> 01:22:18,868
Not at this moment.

915
01:22:23,707 --> 01:22:25,807
Not at this moment.

916
01:22:25,809 --> 01:22:27,809
That's how you are,

917
01:22:27,811 --> 01:22:29,710
a stone.

918
01:22:29,712 --> 01:22:30,811
Serves me right.

919
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:33,446
Aunt Cora told me all about you

920
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,549
and how your daddy gives
everything to your brother.

921
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,451
Shut up and go back to bed!

922
01:22:39,453 --> 01:22:42,720
I bought you! I bought you!

923
01:22:42,722 --> 01:22:44,221
Ow!

924
01:22:45,857 --> 01:22:47,456
Touch me once

925
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:50,725
and you'll see if I'm a
dumb coward like you are.

926
01:22:50,727 --> 01:22:51,826
Traitor!

927
01:22:51,828 --> 01:22:53,994
Fornicator!

928
01:22:58,666 --> 01:23:00,999
You hush up, and don't cry.

929
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:04,836
Crying's no good with him.
I told you before.

930
01:23:04,838 --> 01:23:08,105
Why don't take that girl
somewhere else?

931
01:23:08,107 --> 01:23:10,806
Why you do that in this place?

932
01:23:12,042 --> 01:23:14,442
You want her to hear you.

933
01:23:20,115 --> 01:23:23,316
So, my wife
ran off to tell you.

934
01:23:23,318 --> 01:23:24,350
I might have known.

935
01:23:24,352 --> 01:23:25,918
She tell me nothing.

936
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,586
She a creole girl...

937
01:23:27,588 --> 01:23:29,020
she have the sun in her.

938
01:23:29,022 --> 01:23:32,023
She have more pride than you.

939
01:23:32,025 --> 01:23:33,657
I know that girl.

940
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:35,825
She never ask you
for love again.

941
01:23:35,827 --> 01:23:37,626
She die first.

942
01:23:37,628 --> 01:23:39,027
But I beg you,

943
01:23:39,029 --> 01:23:41,262
she love you so much.

944
01:23:41,264 --> 01:23:43,530
Love her again, a little,

945
01:23:43,532 --> 01:23:45,765
like you can love,

946
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:47,867
or they will tear her to pieces

947
01:23:47,869 --> 01:23:49,301
like they do her mother.

948
01:23:49,303 --> 01:23:53,204
I'll always look after
her. I promise you that.

949
01:23:53,206 --> 01:23:54,538
She don't come to your house

950
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,673
and beg you to marry her.

951
01:23:56,675 --> 01:23:59,942
Is you come all
the long way to her house,

952
01:23:59,944 --> 01:24:03,445
and you love her
till she drunk with it,

953
01:24:03,447 --> 01:24:05,513
till she can't see the sun.

954
01:24:05,515 --> 01:24:10,217
Then you say you don't
want her and break her up.

955
01:24:10,219 --> 01:24:13,687
What you do with her money, eh?

956
01:24:13,689 --> 01:24:16,856
That has nothing
to do with you.

957
01:24:16,858 --> 01:24:20,025
Take it. Leave her
enough so she can live.

958
01:24:20,027 --> 01:24:22,227
Take the rest and go.

959
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:24,195
Who will take care of her?

960
01:24:24,197 --> 01:24:25,529
I will!

961
01:24:27,733 --> 01:24:30,199
Take her away from this place.

962
01:24:31,969 --> 01:24:34,135
Maybe to Martinique.

963
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:39,138
That girl was made for loving.

964
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:43,242
She'll marry someone else.

965
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:46,078
Oh, no, she will not.

966
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,979
She's my wife.

967
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:50,815
I'll look after her for
the rest of her life.

968
01:24:50,817 --> 01:24:52,650
Say goodbye to your mistress

969
01:24:52,652 --> 01:24:54,251
and go.

970
01:24:54,253 --> 01:24:56,987
Who you to tell me to go?
This miss antoinette's house.

971
01:24:56,989 --> 01:25:00,090
I assure you it belongs to me.

972
01:25:00,092 --> 01:25:01,758
Now you'll leave immediately,

973
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,260
or I'll get the men
to put you out.

974
01:25:04,262 --> 01:25:08,330
You think
the men here touch me?

975
01:25:08,332 --> 01:25:11,132
Then I'll get the soldiers up.

976
01:25:11,134 --> 01:25:14,468
I've kept some of that wine
with the poison in it.

977
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:16,470
No soldiers here.

978
01:25:16,472 --> 01:25:19,039
No chain gang, either.

979
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:21,273
No treadmill.

980
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,443
This a free country,

981
01:25:25,445 --> 01:25:28,712
and I a free woman.

982
01:25:31,817 --> 01:25:34,350
Do you think I wanted this?

983
01:25:34,352 --> 01:25:36,652
I'd give my eyes
never to have seen her

984
01:25:36,654 --> 01:25:39,520
or this abominable place!

985
01:25:42,391 --> 01:25:45,558
First true damn word you say.

986
01:26:04,411 --> 01:26:06,878
Finally, it seems quiet here.

987
01:26:10,016 --> 01:26:11,648
Antoinette?

988
01:26:12,817 --> 01:26:14,249
Don't.

989
01:26:15,785 --> 01:26:17,584
Where's christophene?

990
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:21,587
She won't be coming back.

991
01:26:23,791 --> 01:26:26,024
Everything's clearer
without her,

992
01:26:26,026 --> 01:26:28,092
for both of us.

993
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:33,029
Ow!

994
01:26:47,044 --> 01:26:48,410
Antoinette.

995
01:28:45,061 --> 01:28:48,328
The<i> rose of tralee's</i>
<i>a very fine vessel.</i>

996
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:50,630
I've traveled on her a
couple of times myself.

997
01:28:50,632 --> 01:28:53,499
Know the captain well.

998
01:28:53,501 --> 01:28:56,134
This is so sudden.

999
01:29:04,576 --> 01:29:06,708
She doesn't seem herself.

1000
01:29:08,945 --> 01:29:11,745
Well, she'll be better
looked after in england

1001
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:13,813
than in this country.

1002
01:29:19,152 --> 01:29:22,419
Antoinette, do you
really want to go?

1003
01:29:22,421 --> 01:29:26,221
I think it's time
to say our goodbyes.

1004
01:29:27,457 --> 01:29:30,224
Goodbye, my darling girl.

1005
01:29:30,226 --> 01:29:31,858
Goodbye.

1006
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,861
I expect I'll be visiting
you at thornfield hall.

1007
01:29:34,863 --> 01:29:37,230
Yes, I expect so, Richard.

1008
01:29:42,636 --> 01:29:45,236
And pull!

1009
01:29:45,238 --> 01:29:47,605
And pull!

1010
01:29:47,607 --> 01:29:50,608
And pull!

1011
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:53,944
And pull!

1012
01:29:53,946 --> 01:29:56,413
And pull!

1013
01:30:04,522 --> 01:30:07,389
And pull!

1014
01:30:07,391 --> 01:30:09,624
And pull!

1015
01:30:09,626 --> 01:30:12,560
<i>I hated the beauty of the place</i>

1016
01:30:12,562 --> 01:30:14,028
<i>and its magic</i>

1017
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:16,530
<i>and the secret I'd never know.</i>

1018
01:30:16,532 --> 01:30:20,266
<i>Above all, I hated her.</i>

1019
01:30:20,268 --> 01:30:22,935
<i>She'd left me thirsty,</i>

1020
01:30:22,937 --> 01:30:25,103
<i>and all my life would be thirst</i>

1021
01:30:25,105 --> 01:30:27,638
<i>and longing for what I'd lost</i>

1022
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,906
<i>before I had found it.</i>

1023
01:31:04,575 --> 01:31:06,408
Congratulations, sir.

1024
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:08,276
Congratulations.

1025
01:31:58,761 --> 01:32:01,294
I had to tell you the news.

1026
01:32:01,296 --> 01:32:03,529
The master's
marrying our Jane eyre.

1027
01:32:03,531 --> 01:32:05,397
He's waited long enough.

1028
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,566
How is she? Lost as usual?

1029
01:32:10,569 --> 01:32:12,702
She's not lost her spirit.

1030
01:32:12,704 --> 01:32:14,070
I don't turn my back on her

1031
01:32:14,072 --> 01:32:17,306
when she's got
that look on her face.

1032
01:32:17,308 --> 01:32:19,741
<i>When I first came here,</i>

1033
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:22,310
<i>I thought it</i>
<i>would be for a reason.</i>

1034
01:32:22,312 --> 01:32:24,745
<i>I waited for him to come,</i>

1035
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,680
<i>but he did not come.</i>

1036
01:32:26,682 --> 01:32:29,749
<i>He hired a woman</i>
<i>to look after me,</i>

1037
01:32:29,751 --> 01:32:32,218
<i>and then he forgot me.</i>

1038
01:32:39,493 --> 01:32:41,659
Aah!

1039
01:32:51,836 --> 01:32:54,369
<i>Now I know what I must do</i>

1040
01:32:54,371 --> 01:32:58,206
<i>in this house where I am
cold and not belonging.</i>

1041
01:32:58,208 --> 01:33:02,610
<i>I will dream</i>
<i>the end of my dream.</i>
