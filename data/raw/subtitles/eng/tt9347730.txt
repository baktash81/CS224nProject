00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,532
He is right.

173
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,038
[water running]

174
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,584
[Bri] I'm just glad Troy's
finally dating someone normal.

175
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:54,298
I was getting exhausted trying to keep up
with all those European fashion designers.

176
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,216
Hello?

177
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,053
[Anthony]
What time is Clive coming tomorrow?

178
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,471
10:00 a.m.

179
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,766
You feeling good
about what you're showing?

180
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,603
Uh, I think so.

181
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,521
Uh…

182
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,190
Some stuff he might enjoy.

183
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,400
Mm-hmm.

184
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,569
Okay, okay.

185
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,029
[both grunt]

186
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,197
Huh.

187
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,700
I guess she did kill a Rottweiler.

188
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,910
Damn.

189
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,037
I don't care.

190
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,624
I'm not trying to get creeped out
in my new apartment before bed.

191
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,419
Your new apartment is ghost-proof.

192
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,839
- It was on the Zillow listing.
- Our new apartment.

193
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,216
Mm-hmm.

194
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,383
Sorry.

195
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,801
[police sirens wailing]

196
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,055
[Bri laughing] Come here.

197
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:45,849
[kisses]

198
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,645
[Clive] Hmm.

199
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,355
Who are you, man?

200
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:54,691
Uh, well…

201
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,945
[Clive] This is Anthony McCoy
of two years ago.

202
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,739
I want the Anthony McCoy of the future.

203
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,201
I want the great Black hope
of the Chicago art scene of tomorrow.

204
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,080
That's the guy that I gave a solo show to
straight out of grad school.

205
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,792
[sighs] Look, I really don't want
to have to go through

206
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,836
the trouble of replacing you
in the summer show,

207
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,798
but you're the only person
who hasn't shown me what I'm putting up!

208
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,262
- I'm working on something.
- Dig into that history of yours, dude!

209
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,848
I'm thinking about doing something
about the projects.

210
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,768
- And about how white supremacy…
- White people.

211
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,563
Yeah, how it creates these spaces

212
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,606
of rampant neglect
for communities of color,

213
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,733
- in particular, Black communities.
- Yeah, like where you're from.

214
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,945
- Yeah. Bronzeville.
- South Side is kind of played.

215
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,866
Uh, or Cabrini-Green.

216
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,162
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

217
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,540
Bye, babe.

218
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,542
- Don't forget we have your mom's tonight.
- 7:00.

219
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,421
[Bri laughing]

220
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,505
Bye.

221
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,468
["Like The Moon" playing]

00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,368

[siren wailing]

233
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,839
[man] They'd almost never come
round here back in the day.

234
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,758
Unless it was to take someone in.

235
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,636
[chuckles] But that was a long time ago.

236
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,764
Now they can't seem to stay away.

237
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,684
At night, they post up where
the last of us still live,

238
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,520
a police car on either side of the block.

239
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,230
Keeping us safe…

240
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,149
or keeping us in.

241
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,361
You've lived around here for a while?

242
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,073
Uh, since before the high-rises came down.

243
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,158
William. William Burke.

244
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,535
Anthony McCoy.

00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,036
[clicks fingers]

246
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,789
You need a hand?

247
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,251
[William] Home sweet home.

248
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,464
Ah, the more things change,
the more things stay the same.

249
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,049
How you doing, brother?

250
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,803
Ask the white people around here
about "Girl X," Dantrell Davis.

251
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,013
Blank stares.

252
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,725
One white woman dies in the hood,
and the story lives on forever.

253
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,518
It's a good story, I guess.

254
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,687
You mind if I take some notes?

255
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,314
[pen clicks]

256
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,111
Makes you think about what could make
someone just snap like that.

257
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,947
Helen Lyle was out here
looking for Candyman.

258
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,533
You ask me, I say she found him.

259
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:39,953
What's Candyman?

260
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,876
[William] <i>For me, Candyman
was a guy named Sherman Fields.</i>

261
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,337
<i>He had a hook for a hand.</i>

262
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,421
<i>Neighborhood character.</i>

263
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,508
<i>Used to stand there
and hand out sweets when I was a kid.</i>

264
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,593
<i>One October,</i>

265
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,847
a razor blade shows up
in a little white girl's Halloween candy.

266
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,017
Police come around looking for Sherman,
but Sherman's gone.

267
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:07,231
And one day, I saw him myself.

268
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,525
[heartbeat thumping]

269
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,944
[Candyman humming]

270
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,451
[William] <i>He'd been hiding in the walls.</i>

[screaming]

272
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,455
[screaming continues]

273
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,377
We got a suspicious noise…

274
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,922
That's when I saw the true face of fear.

275
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,507
[footsteps approaching]

276
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,760
[policeman, muffled] Come on, come on.
Go, go, go!

277
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,470
Go, go! Come on, let's go!

278
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:41,473
[shouting fades]

279
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,618
[muffled shouting]

280
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,370
Hurry! Come on, go, go, go!

281
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,955
[footsteps approaching]

282
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,011
Over here.

283
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,555
Get out of here! Come on!

284
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,973
[indistinct shouting]

- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

291
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,959
What shows up a couple weeks later?

292
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,755
More razor blades in more candy.

293
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,551
That's when we knew
Sherman had been innocent.

294
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,053
Harmless.

295
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,806
But that wasn't the last we saw of him.

296
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,569
[knuckles crack]

297
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,487
I don't know what to tell you.

298
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,447
Beshaw dropped out of my show.

299
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,119
Oh, I told you months ago
to put her in rehab.

300
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,705
You fix this.

301
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,748
[speaking in French]

302
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,504
Uh.

303
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,715
[continues speaking in French]

304
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:20,799
Uh-huh.

305
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,509
Uh-huh. Okay.

306
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:23,677
[speaks in French]

307
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,054
What's up?

308
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,267
- You forgot your mother's.
- Shit. I'm sorry.

309
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,269
Will you please call that woman?

310
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,354
- Tomorrow.
- You said that yesterday.

311
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,356
And it's nice that she wants
to spend time with you.

312
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,816
Not everyone has that.

313
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,861
Is she okay?

314
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:44,198
She implied that I give you money
so you won't visit her.

315
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,618
So, she's about the same.

316
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,828
- [sighs] Stop it.
- [laughs] That's great.

317
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:51,330
I wanna show you something.

318
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,332
Uh…

319
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,002
- Do I need to come upstairs?
- Stay right there.

320
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,046
All righty then.

321
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:03,342
[Anthony] Sherman's face was beaten
so badly that it was unrecognizable,

322
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,011
and that's where the story started.

323
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:09,014
About them seeing him around Cabrini.

324
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,933
About him coming to get you.

325
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,772
Over time, his name disappears,
and he just becomes the Candyman.

326
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,483
What do you think?

327
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,109
Well…

328
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,945
it's a pretty literal approach.

329
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,198
Not much room for viewer
interpretation, you know.

330
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:30,035
Moving from the symbolism of violence
to the actual depiction of it.

331
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,996
Okay, but how is it hitting you?

332
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,498
It's…

333
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,917
painful.

334
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:41,046
I feel really connected to this.
I've never been this clear before.

335
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,676
It's like I know exactly
what I'm meant to be doing right now.

336
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:50,013
Babe, that's great.

337
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,894
- And I'm sure Clive will be...
- Oh, there's one more thing.

338
00:23:56,728 --> 00:24:00,107
The legend is
if you say his name five times

339
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,650
while looking in the mirror,

340
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,571
he appears in the reflection
and kills you.

341
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,449
So, I thought

342
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,827
that we could…

343
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,412
[laughs] What did you think?

344
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,289
[whispering] Summon him.

345
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:16,790
[scoffs]

346
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,166
Hell no.

347
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,794
No.

348
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,337
Candyman.

349
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,672
Anthony…

350
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,508
- Candyman.
- Anthony, no.

351
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,760
- Candyman.
- Stop. Stop it.

352
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,387
- Candyman.
- Stop it!

353
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,597
Okay.

354
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,057
- You better not do that last one.
- Okay, okay, okay.

355
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,147
- [whispers] Candyman.
- Anthony, you play too much!

356
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,565
Stop, stop, stop.

357
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,442
What happened to your hand?

358
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,777
- Fucking bee sting.
- Really?

359
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,279
Yeah, that shit hurt.

360
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,615
Mmm. Looks like it.

361
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,867
- Kiss it.
- Get the fuck outta here.

362
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,453
Help, help.

363
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,024
[crowd chattering]

364
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,214
[camera clicking]

365
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,176
- We can go now.
- Finally.

366
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:38,307
Last year, we did a solo booth
at Frieze LA with Jameson.

367
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,725
Phenomenal work.

368
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,018
These are related works,

369
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:46,231
but here, he's recreating
and looping archival footage.

370
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,443
[Bri] Just take your time.

371
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,746
This is quite a departure
from your previous work.

372
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,166
Go ahead, open it.

373
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,470
I'm trying to align these moments in time
that exist in the same place.

374
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,223
The idea is to almost

375
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:23,769
calibrate tragedy into a focused lineage
that culminates in the now.

376
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,106
Brianna,
tell your boy not to hog the critic.

377
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,944
He's got a whole thing.

378
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:36,573
Yeah, no, I know, I heard it.
It's complicated.

379
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:40,410
She's interacting with the piece.

380
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,914
[Anthony] The mirror invites you
to attempt the summoning yourself.

381
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:46,583
Huh.

382
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,713
Anyway, I don't know why
I'm standing next to my own piece

383
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,674
like some kind of asshole.

384
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,928
- The work speaks for itself.
- Oh, it speaks, all right.

385
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,431
It speaks in didactic knee-jerk clichés

386
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:04,852
about the ambient violence
of the gentrification cycle.

387
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:09,731
But your kind are the real pioneers
of that cycle, you know.

388
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:11,149
Excuse me?

389
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,527
Artists.

390
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:18,323
Artists descend upon
disenfranchised neighborhoods

391
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:21,201
divining cheap rent, so they can
dick around in their studios

392
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,662
without the crushing burden of a day job.

393
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:27,082
I'm gonna get another drink.

394
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,135
- Should we try it?
- What?

395
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,803
Summon the Candyman?

396
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,140
Uh, yeah, no. Black people don't need
to be summoning shit.

397
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:46,226
- Come on, that is nonsense.
- This isn't the bayou.

398
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,187
In Chicago, that's white people shit.

399
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,563
Mmm.

400
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,900
- Candyman. Candyman.
- Zip it. Hey, stop.

401
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,865
- Candyman.
- Stop it.

402
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,372
[man] Of course, I did. I owe Brianna one.

403
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,667
She introduced me to Thelma Golden
three years ago.

404
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,212
- [Brianna] You still owe me one for that.
- [laughs]

405
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:14,588
And, uh…

406
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:15,881
Ah… [snaps fingers]

407
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,382
Tony, is it?

408
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,219
I love interventionist strategy.

409
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:23,305
Conventional painting is such a drag.

410
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,057
I love that you hid those fucking things

411
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,351
in a storage room
with the lights out. So smart.

412
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,603
Is all your work based on found material?

413
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,647
I mean, where'd you
even find those paintings?

414
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,023
Thrift store in the desert?

415
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,525
[laughing]

416
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:37,528
I found them in the studio
where I painted them.

417
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:38,737
[laughing]

418
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,572
You goofy-ass fuck.

419
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,243
And you, you fucking hyenas.

420
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,453
- Oh, what the fuck?
- Hey. Let's go. Clive.

421
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,915
- Anthony.
- You think you'd even be here

422
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,083
if it wasn't for her?

423
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,168
Shouldn't you be stocking up
on morning-after pills

424
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,045
to accommodate your summer intern program?

425
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,923
That's not spontaneous.
You had that one in the bank.

426
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,675
Yeah, I did, bitch.

427
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:00,926
[grunts]

428
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,137
That's fine.
I can take being called a bitch.

429
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,516
- It's fine. I'm on a NuvaRing.
- [stammering] I know.

430
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,435
Thanks for coming.

431
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,547
I'm so fucking over it.

432
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,216
Honestly, if she can't control her man…

433
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,593
[woman] She lost control.

434
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:45,387
It's like, do I get a thank you? No!

435
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,307
Do I get an apology for that display?

436
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,267
Atrocity exhibition.

437
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:55,772
[Clive] Shoehorning her boyfriend
into my summer show was her first mistake.

438
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,941
- Only mistake.
- [sighs] She's done.

439
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:00,152
And she has no one to blame but herself.

440
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,071
Don't mix curation
with who you're fucking.

441
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:04,281
[woman laughs]

442
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,782
Love will tear us apart.

443
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,327
Jesus, Jerrica, we get it.
You like Joy Division.

444
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,912
- [Jerrica laughs]
- [Clive sighs]

445
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,002
- What's that thing again?
- [sighs] What thing?

446
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,546
You know.

447
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,716
Say what five times in the mirror?

448
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,968
[sighs] You tell me.

449
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:27,387
You proofread the press release, Jerrica.

450
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:29,681
[Clive] "Candyman."

451
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:34,269
But don't do it, okay?

452
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,939
I don't want you to die tonight.

453
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,651
At least, not until we…

454
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,444
fuck.

455
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:45,614
You're no good for me.

456
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,950
You know what? I changed my mind. Do it.

457
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,826
Necrophilia's always been
on my bucket list.

458
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,078
Mmm.

459
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,040
- [shoes clatter]
- [Clive] Mmm.

460
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,668
Hmm.

461
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,044
Let's do it here then.

462
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,712
Um.

463
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:03,298
- No, I've been here all day.
- Come on.

464
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,385
[rain pattering]

465
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,683
- [Clive] Mmm.
- [giggles]

466
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,937
- [Jerrica] Candyman.
- Are you serious?

467
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,188
Quiet, bitch.

468
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,489
- Candyman.
- [Clive groans]

469
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,658
Candyman.

470
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,243
[bee buzzing]

471
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,288
- Candyman.
- Mmm.

472
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,706
Candyman.

473
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:54,308
[Jerrica] <i>See?</i>

474
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:55,976
Nothing.

475
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,811
So much for that.

476
00:32:58,437 --> 00:32:59,605
[kisses]

477
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:01,690

[blood splattering]

480
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:07,946
[Clive] Is this real?

481
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,742
This is real?

482
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,118
What the fuck?

483
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,788
- [gurgling]
- What the fuck!

485
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,004

- What…
- [whirring]

- …the fuck?
- [whirring stops]

00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,909
Oh!

00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,452
Fuck!

494
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:59,206
Fuck me. Must go faster.

495
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,333
- Must go faster!
- [buzzing intensifies]

496
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:09,800
Fuck!

497
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,302
- Fuck! No!

It's cool to be mentioned, I guess.

your daddy could fly.

Did you?

530
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:09,813
Well, I can.

Anthony?

539
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:56,860
Are you okay?

540
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,572
I had a bad dream.

541
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:02,449
Me too.

542
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,118
What was it?

543
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:07,913
What was what?

544
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,374
The dream.

545
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,548
I'll be out. I'll be out in a minute.

546
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:22,845
Anthony?

547
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:31,478
So, I don't know what this is,
or how you knew it existed,

548
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,939
but this is everything
we have under Helen Lyle.

549
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,650
I didn't. That's why I had to ask.

550
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,863
Well, here it is.

551
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:42,447
Thanks, I appreciate it.

552
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:45,158
Of course.
I found it filed under True Crimes.

553
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,369
Work-study undergrads are the worst.

554
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:48,954

<i>A code of honor, perhaps,
fear of the police themselves.</i>

562
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:15,105
<i>The easy answer is always,
"Candyman did it."</i>

As you can imagine, what I'm writing is
no longer an exhibition review.

626
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:30,986
It's...

627
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:33,947
It's now expanded into a larger article,

628
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:35,657
which impacts both the works

629
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:39,745
and the circumstances around the murders.

630
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:41,038
I see.

631
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:45,042
So, I just wanted to get
a few quotes from you.

632
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,003
Well, I don't know much of anything.

633
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,547
Your work is so macabre, and that's…

634
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:55,052
pretty interesting,
considering what happened.

635
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:57,638
That's a coincidence.

636
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:00,098
I'm not saying that you're at fault,

637
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,809
and I'm certainly not saying
that a ghost manifested

638
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:06,939
by collective storytelling
killed a prominent art dealer.

639
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:09,191
I'm just saying that…

640
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:13,654
all of a sudden, your work seems…

641
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,199
eternal.

What's next?

644
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:25,707
I'm expanding the work into a series.

645
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,545
I'm hoping to do a solo show.

646
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,714
All about Candyman. Spread the word.

647
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:34,591
Mmm, I love that idea.

648
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:40,264
I'm surprised at how positive
your take on my piece seems to be now.

649
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:42,975
Well, it grew on me.

650
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:45,686
- Seemed like you didn't quite get it.
- No, I get it.

651
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:49,273
It's the hood, gentrification, et cetera.

652
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,692
Artists gentrify the hood?

653
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,987
Who do you think makes the hood?

654
00:44:56,613 --> 00:45:00,450
The city cuts off a community
and waits for it to die.

655
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,996
Then they invite developers in

656
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,415
and say, "Hey, you artists,

657
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:09,710
you young people, you white,
preferably or only…

658
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:13,505
please come to the hood, it's cheap.

659
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:17,384
And if you stick it out for a couple
of years, we'll bring you a Whole Foods."

660
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,929
You wanna be a part of the story, right?

661
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,556
Well, as a critic, I…

662
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,975
To really engage with the work,

663
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:26,393
to "get it"…

664
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,022
you should say it.

665
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:31,732

- Say his name.

I love being here.
It's so provincial, yet exciting.

690
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:09,134
Oh, my God.
Have you met Danielle Harrington?

691
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,845
- She's chief...
- Curator at the MCA.

692
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:14,306
I find it crazy that
we actually haven't met yet.

693
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:15,891
I've been so eager to meet you.

694

Don't you start already. I get first dibs.

Clive literally had to die

Jameson's doing a show
at my gallery in New York.

697
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:28,987
I think it's
the perfect opportunity for you

698
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:30,614
to spread your wings a bit more.

699
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:32,032
Come to the big city.

700
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:33,992
I could introduce you to
the women of Entre Nous

701

00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,085
Don't you wanna focus
on working with artists

705
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:46,088
instead of chasing outstanding invoices?

706
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:49,591
You can change the institution
from the inside.

707
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:52,427
You should come by the museum some time.

708
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:54,429
Okay.

709
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:56,014
- I think I'd like that.
- [phone buzzing]

710
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,391
- [Jameson] Oh, my God.
- [phones chiming]

711
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,559
- What's wrong?
- What's happening?

712
00:50:58,642 --> 00:51:01,228
Finley Stephens was found dead
in her apartment.

713
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:02,980
[Danielle] Her husband found her.

714
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,816
Poor thing. Oh, her husband's a suspect.

715
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:09,653
- I have to go.
- Anthony.

716
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:11,029
[gasps]

717
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,093
Anthony?

718
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:34,803
[Anthony] <i>What is he?</i>

719
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:36,638
[William] <i>Candyman ain't a he.</i>

720
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,974
<i>Candyman's the whole damn hive.</i>

721
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:41,518
There are others?

722
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,354
[William] <i>Samuel Evans.</i>

723
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:48,692
<i>Run down during
the white housing riots of the '50s.</i>

724
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:51,820
<i>William Bell, lynched in the '20s.</i>

725
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:55,782
<i>But the first one, where it all began,</i>

726
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:58,118
<i>was in the 1890s.</i>

727
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,747
<i>It's a story Helen found.
The story of Daniel Robitaille.</i>

728
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:07,044
<i>He'd made a living touring the country
painting portraits for wealthy families.</i>

729
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:10,047
<i>Mostly white, and they loved him.</i>

730
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:12,174
But you know how it goes.

731
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,844
They love what we make

732
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:17,012
but not us.

733
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:21,183
<i>One day, he's commissioned</i>

734
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,393
<i>to paint the daughter
of a Chicago factory owner</i>

735
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,646
<i>who made his fortune in the stockyards.</i>

736
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:26,730
<i>Well,</i>

737
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:30,192
<i>Robitaille committed
the ultimate sin of his time.</i>

738
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:32,736
They fell in love.

739
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:35,072
They had an affair, she got pregnant.

740
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,282
<i>The girl tells her father, and, well…</i>

741
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:38,367
<i>you know…</i>

742
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,161
<i>He hires some men to hunt Robitaille down,</i>

743
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,663
<i>told them to get creative.</i>

744
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,582
Chased him through here
in the middle of the day.

745
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:46,792
He collapses from exhaustion

746
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:49,545
right near where the old tower
in Chestnut used to be.

747
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:52,130
<i>They beat him. Tortured him.</i>

748
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:55,884
<i>They cut off his arm
and jammed a meat hook in the stump.</i>

749
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:59,012
They smeared honeycomb
from the nearby hives on his chest

750
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:00,389
and let the bees sting him.

751
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,183
<i>A crowd started to form to watch the show.</i>

752
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:05,936
<i>The big finale:</i>

753
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,564
They set him on fire

754
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:10,357
and he finally dies.

755
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,194
But a story like that,

756
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,571
a pain like that…

757
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,615
lasts forever.

758
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,202
That's Candyman.

759
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:28,375
So…

760
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:31,628
he's real?

761
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:32,880
Bell is real.

762
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:36,758
Samuel, Sherman, Daniel Robitaille.
They're all real.

763
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,721
Candyman is how we deal with the fact
that these things happened.

764
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,514
That they're still happening.

765
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:47,060
Get some rest, young blood.

766
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:50,022
You'll feel better in the morning.

767
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:08,457
[Anthony] Don't look at those!

768
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,376
What the fuck is this?

769
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,795
You shouldn't be looking at this.

770
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:18,842
Anthony, we are beyond
sensitive artist bullshit.

771
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,136
What is going on?

772
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:23,931
I think... I think…

773
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:28,727
- I made a mistake, Bri.
- What do you mean?

774
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,314
- I brought him back.
- Who?

775
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:35,400
You promise you won't think I'm crazy?

776
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:36,902
Anthony, who?

777
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,241
Oh, God.

778
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,827
- Burke told me…
- God. Who is Burke?

779
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:47,704
From the laundromat.
He knows about all of it.

780
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:48,956
Knows about what?

781
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,583
Candyman.

782
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:55,462
- Candyman isn't real.
- I saw him!

783
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:58,590
Candyman isn't real, Anthony!

784
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:02,427
You know what is real?

785
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:06,598
Me, Anthony. Me. This, this is real.

786
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:10,060
- You don't understand.
- Okay.

787
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:13,897
I will show you that... Okay.

788
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:15,941
- Candyman.
- No!

789
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:17,025
Candyman!

790
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:18,151
[screams]

791
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:20,988
[screams]

792
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,992
Don't… say his name.

793
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:27,035
- You stay the fuck right there.
- Brianna…

794
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,246
Don't follow me.

795
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:40,340
[Troy] Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Let the motherfucker try and come up here.

796
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:45,137
Fucking art ogre, fucking fee-fi-fo-fum.
Grady will stomp on his ass.

797
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,973
- Ain't that right, Grady?
- If I have to stomp, I'll stomp.

798
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:50,267
I mean, he literally was, like,

799
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,395
"I summoned Candyman," and I'm like…

800
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:55,105
Candyman ain't real, nigga.

801
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:58,442
I told you not to start dating
that Dapper Dan-ass,

802
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:01,778
li'l Basquiat-ass, fucking no-job Sun Ra...

803
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:03,405
Troy. Okay.

804
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:06,283
Ain't a dick on the planet good enough
to offset a demonology hobby.

805
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:07,910
Okay, Troy, stop!

806
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:10,204
What? It's the truth.
If Grady came up in here,

807
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:12,122
smashing mirrors.

808
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,791
Mirrors.

809
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:17,336
He's right.

810
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,090
- All right.
- You…

811
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,219
take care of Lucy.

812
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:27,596
And you are in time-out.

813
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:28,805
Come here.

814
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:31,517
Break it up.

815
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:39,024
I spoke to Mom.

816
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:42,402
She wants to close the storage unit out,

817
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:45,364
so we finally have to deal
with Dad's work.

818
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:47,366
I was thinking maybe we could

819
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:49,952
sell or…

820
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:55,541
- if you want to keep anything…
- No, I don't want any of that in my house.

821
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:58,126
- Thank you.
- Then, sell or do a show.

822
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,753
I think you should open a space.

823
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:03,674
I'm not doing a show
of the thing that killed him, Troy.

824
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:05,968
You can't hide everything, and…

825
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:07,845
- and just hope it goes away.
- Troy…

826
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:11,056
You don't have to be there every time
a tortured artist has a psychotic break.

827
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:17,771
I'm sorry.

828
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:18,897
[scoffs]

829
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,358
Bri.

830
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,740
I'm glad you're here.

831
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:33,412
You can stay as long as you want,
on the condition you don't try

832
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:34,913
and summon Candyman.

833
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:37,791
Who would do that?

834
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,835
- [bell ringing]
- What's up?

835
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,214
[laughing, chattering]

836
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:49,970
[girl] Trina was fooked up this weekend.

837
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:53,223
- Guys, what should I do about my bangs?
- No one cares about your bangs.

838
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:54,600
Annika, look at this.

839
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:57,728
Trina's fucking trashed. Look.
Watch, watch, watch.

840
00:57:57,811 --> 00:58:00,439
- Samantha.
- Oh, my God, that's so sad.

841
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:04,443
- [gasps] Oh, shit.
- Look at this chunky-ass vomit.

842
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:06,904
Oh, my gosh, in front of everyone.

843
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,780
Have you guys heard of Candyman?

844
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,367
Fuck this. I changed my mind.
I'm not gonna do it.

845
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:16,371
- Come on, Boof. Don't be a pussy.
- Why not? It's a warm and wonderful thing.

846
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:17,956
Boof, we're already in formation.

847
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,583
- Fine.
- Okay, ready?

848
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,376
Candyman.

849
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,961
All at once, dumbass.

850
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:27,674
[all] Candyman.

851
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:30,469
Candyman.

852
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:33,472
Candyman.

853
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:37,893
- Not today. Not today.
- Come on.

854
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,686
[Haley] Two more times.

855
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,151
[all] Candyman.

856
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:47,361
One more.

857
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,031
Candyman.

858
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:56,119
Well, we're still alive, so…

859
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,750
Hey, Trina.

860
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,169
[Haley] Let's go.

861
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:12,803
Hey, Triney, how's that hangover?
You're such a mess.

862
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,221
[girls laughing]

863
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:16,306
[banging]

864
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,852
- Trina was fucking trashed.
- Don't let her drink that much.

865
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,353
That's between her and her god.

866
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:24,147
Trina, you broke the fucking door.

867
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:26,733
[music on headphones]

868
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,778
Haley, I'm too young to die. Open it.

869
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:31,530
- I'm working on it.
- [bees buzzing]

870
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:33,490
[raspy breathing]

871
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:37,327
Guys…

872
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:38,662
What the fuck?

873
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:41,039
- Wait, I forgot my vape.
- Boof.

874
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:43,750
You know, I don't think you should…

875
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:45,210
- Boof?
- [thuds]

876
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,004
Boof?

877
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:48,297
[cracking]

878
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,756
Boof?

879
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:52,926
What are you doing?

00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,928

This isn't funny!

910

[Danielle] We've been trying to move
in a fresher direction

911
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:09,563
for the past few years,

912
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:13,775
and our last curator was a great guy,
but just had a hard time getting there.

913
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:16,695
[Brianna] Well, I've certainly noticed
a shift in programming

914
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:19,615
- since you started here.
- Hopefully for the best.

915
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:22,784
I'm so happy I finally got
to meet you at Jack's dinner.

916
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:25,495
Yes. He's been trying
to get us together before.

917
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:28,665
It's crazy about Clive.

918
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,210
I heard you were the one
to find the bodies.

919
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:32,628
Yeah…

920
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:33,795
[guide speaking, indistinct]

921
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:35,797
You've really emerged

922
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:39,593
as an interesting figure amidst all this.

923
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:42,346
The show you put together
sounded so good too.

924
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:45,641
You were so brave to embrace formlessness.

925
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:50,145
Actually, there were a lot of bodies...
figures in the show.

926
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:51,855
Like Arnold's work.

927
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:57,236
For so long, abstraction has been about
indexing a sublimated emotional state,

928
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:00,239
- and I just wanted to focus on the body.
- Of course, but I mean,

929
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:03,200
between the recent tragedies
and your father's legacy,

930
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:05,702
you've got a fascinating story.

931
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,247
Right.

932
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,707
And your eye for emerging talent.

933
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:13,126
How long have you worked
with Anthony McCoy?

934
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:15,838
Just a couple years.

935
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:19,842
My board members are buzzing
about McCoy's work.

936
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:24,346
Feels like a Project Room show
is something we could start talking about.

937
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:28,433
And of course, any other artist
you have your eye on.

938
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:38,277

943
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,667
[doctor] Welcome back, Mr. McCoy.

944
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,002
What?

945
01:03:55,544 --> 01:03:57,671
I saw in your file you were born here.

946
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,176
I was born on the South Side.

947
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,721
No, it says you were born here.

948
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,514
[voices whispering]

949
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:10,142
Regardless, it's good that
you came in when you did.

950
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:13,729
We need to admit you immediately
for monitoring and do some more testing.

[door opens, creaks]

954
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:47,304
Anthony, where have you been?

955
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,855
What happened to your hand?

956
01:04:57,648 --> 01:04:59,274
Looks bad.

957
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:04,071
Went to River North Memorial,
near Cabrini.

958
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:07,908
They fixed me right up.

959
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:11,745
You've been painting?

960
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:14,540
[chuckles]

961
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:18,585
Yeah, I've been inspired a lot, actually,

962
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:20,462
by Cabrini.

963
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,423
[sniffs] You want some tea?

964
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:25,551
I heard a story about a fire.

965
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:28,387
Killed a woman named Helen Lyle.

966
01:05:29,721 --> 01:05:31,348
A baby that was taken.

967
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,393
Something they used to call Candyman.

968
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:36,061
[shushes]

969
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:38,647
Don't.

970
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,148
Don't say that.

971
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:47,030
You told me I was born on the South Side.

972
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:49,408
I did raise you in the home you remember.

973
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:55,122
But you were born in River North Memorial

974
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,916
and spent the first two years in Cabrini.

975
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:00,752
Why did you lie?

976
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:04,006
To protect you.

977
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:10,137
From what?

978
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:18,604
I just wanted you to grow up happy

979
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:20,230
and normal.

980
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:28,155
Do I look normal, Mama?

981
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,746
- [grunts]
- I have to know.

982
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:38,457
Now.

[sighs]

984
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:53,305

I thought she was the one who did it.

986
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:11,156

01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:13,200
Helen.

01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:14,743
[fire crackling]

989
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:20,874
The way I found her in her apartment,

990
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,501
covered in blood.

991
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:26,004
We all thought she was crazy.

992
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:33,846
But it wasn't her.

993
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:39,726
It was him.

one of his victims.

999
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:55,659
He wanted you to burn in that fire.

1000
01:07:55,742 --> 01:07:58,078
But she pulled you out…

1001
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:02,124
and gave you back to me.

1002
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:04,626

[Anne-Marie] <i>In the fire.
I thought she ended it.</i>

1006
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:19,850
And we vowed to never say his name again.

1007
01:08:24,395 --> 01:08:25,898
But…

1008
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:30,736
someone broke the pact and…

1009
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:32,069
He found me.

Come out immediately where I can see you.

- Immediately.
- Troy, stop. Please, oh, my gosh.

01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,749
[muffled thudding]

1059
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:54,917
[Billy] I said…

1060
01:12:56,877 --> 01:12:58,545
Sabrina?

1061
01:12:58,629 --> 01:13:00,172
- [liquid dripping]
- [gasps]

1062
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:03,634
- [panting]
- [bees buzzing]

1063
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:07,179
[raspy breathing]

1064
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:12,476
Sherman.

1065
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:17,064
[shushes]

1066
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:18,815
[bee buzzing]

1067
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:23,654
Now…

1068
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:26,949
we have a witness.

1069
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:36,124
[man] I think I saw the guy
you're looking for.

1070
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,835
The "Say My Name" killer.

1071
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:40,462
He's roaming around
the row houses at Cabrini.

1072
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:42,089
A Black man, around 30.

1073
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:46,093
He was waving a hook and talking crazy.
I think he's killing people down there!

1074
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:47,302
[chair rattles]

1075
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:48,720
- What the fuck?
- [phone beeps]

1076
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:00,566
[Brianna] What the fuck?

1077
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:04,069
I was baptized here.

1078
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:07,948
Isn't it beautiful?

1079
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:12,035
- A... A... A... Anthony?
- [voices whispering]

1080
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:16,290
Oh, uh... Yeah, I guess I'm on
some other shit now, huh?

1081
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:18,166
[Brianna whimpering]

1082
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,544
[William] When something leaves a stain,

1083
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:23,130
even if you wash it out,

1084
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:24,214
it's still there.

1085
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:26,675
You can feel it.

1086
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:30,220
A thinning, deep in the fabric.

1087
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:35,559
This neighborhood got caught in a loop.

1088
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:39,479
The shit got stained
in the exact same spot,

1089
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:41,231
over and over,

1090
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:43,942
until it finally rotted
from the inside out.

1091
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:45,110
[gasping]

1092
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:48,280
[William] They tore down our homes,
so they could move back in.

1093
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:50,741
We need Candyman.

1094
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:54,578
'Cause this time,
he'll be killing their fathers,

1095
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:58,540
their babies, their sisters.

1096
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:04,963
I knew it was only a matter of time
before the baby came back here,

1097
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:07,132
in perfect symmetry.

1098
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:11,803
A chance for Candyman to take back
what's rightfully his.

1099
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:12,930
[Brianna whimpering]

1100
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:14,097
His legend.

1101
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,189
Hand.

1102
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:24,816
Wait…

1103
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,527
[Brianna] No, no, no, no!

1104
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:27,444
[gasping]

1105
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:29,071
[squelching]

1106
01:15:29,154 --> 01:15:30,364
[Brianna] Anthony!

1107
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:33,116
[Brianna sobbing]

1108
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:42,543
See, you can really make
the story your own.

1109
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:46,630
But… [grunts] …some of the specifics

1110
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:48,799
should be somewhat consistent. [grunts]

1111
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:50,092
[whimpering]

1112
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:52,094
- [hook slashes]
- [flesh squelching]

1113
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:54,429
- [William grunts]
- [Anthony groaning]

1114
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:04,356
Here we have the story of Anthony McCoy,

1115
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:06,316
artist who lost his mind,

1116
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,861
and the cops showed up
and shot him down in cold blood

1117
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:10,571
without even saying a word.

1118
01:16:10,654 --> 01:16:12,114
[laughing]

1119
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:15,450
Well, say his name, if you dare!

1120
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:18,871
Say it five times in a mirror.
See what happens.

1121
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:24,293
When it's all done,
they'll tell his story,

1122
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,962
and Candyman will live…

1123
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:29,548
- [sighs]
- [sirens wailing in distance]

1124
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:30,716
…forever.

1125
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:32,843
[pants]

1126
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:34,469
Here comes the swarm.

1127
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,225
[William] Are you ready for the sacrament?

1128
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:42,019
[grunting]

1129
01:16:42,603 --> 01:16:44,021
[panting]

1130
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:46,356
[whimpering]

1131
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,983
[William] Hey!

1132
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,194
- Where you going?
- [siren wailing continues]

1133
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:52,362
Don't you want a sweet?

1134
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:54,323
- [flesh squelches]
- [Anthony groans]

1135
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:56,408
[Brianna panting]

1136
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:00,037
[gasps]

1137
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,288
[Brianna] Fuck!

1138
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:07,127
[knocks]

1139
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:10,339
[William] Where you going?

1140
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:14,343
[Brianna panting]

1141
01:17:15,677 --> 01:17:20,516
[William] <i>♪ Who can make the sunrise ♪</i>

1142
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:26,813
<i>♪ Sprinkle it with dew? ♪</i>

1143
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:36,823
- [William shouts]
- [Brianna screaming]

1144
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,285
- [Brianna grunts]
- [William groans]

1145
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:45,624

[sirens continue]

1148
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:07,437
[weapon clangs]

1149
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,984
This is as good a place as any, pet.

1150
01:18:12,943 --> 01:18:15,028
- [grunts, groans]
- [metal clangs]

1151
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:16,280
[William laughing]

1152
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:19,074
[gasps, groans]

1153
01:18:20,117 --> 01:18:22,119
[grunting]

1154
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,210
I think he's dead.

1155
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:37,342
Brianna.

1156
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:38,927
[whimpering]

1157
01:18:42,306 --> 01:18:44,183
[panting]

1158
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,865
No, no!

1159
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:03,493
Get up, Anthony. Get up.

1160
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:06,496
Baby, baby, baby…

1161
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,750
- [sirens continue]
- Please. No. No.

1162
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,793
Anthony, baby.

1163
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:14,505
- [whispering] It's okay.
- Get up, please.

1164
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:18,008
Please.
Please stay with me, Anthony, please.

1165
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:21,345
Please, please, please. Please get up.

1166

[police sirens wailing]

1168
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:26,141
Don't go.

1169
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:29,019
We're gonna get you help.
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

1170
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:30,437
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

1171
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:32,147
In here!

1172
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,067
- [officer] Put your hands up!
- He just needs…

1173
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:36,735
[gunshots firing]

1174
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:40,864

Oh, my God.

[siren wails]

1179
01:20:25,242 --> 01:20:26,952
[officer] Hey. Stay on your feet.

1180
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,704
- Come on. Move it.
- [officer 2] What's going on?

1181
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:30,747
[officer] We got two suspects, one's down.

1182
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:32,875
- [officer 2] Get her in the car.
- [officer 3] Hurry up.

1183
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:36,253
[officer 3] We didn't know what to do.

1184
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:43,385
[gasping]

1185
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:45,345

[sighs]

1189
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:13,582
Very unfortunate
what happened to your man in there.

1190
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,711
We'd been looking for him.

1191
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:20,547
Got a tip he'd be here.

1192
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:24,176
You know anything about that?

1193
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:30,307
Whatever you tell us helps.

1194
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:33,310
Any cooperation is noted.

1195
01:21:34,311 --> 01:21:35,938
Saying what you saw

1196
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:38,190
when he came at Jones…

1197
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:42,444
and Jones, obviously knowing
what he'd done before,

1198
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:46,073
seeing his hook,
knowing you were in danger,

1199
01:21:46,156 --> 01:21:48,909
had no choice but to discharge his weapon.

1200
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:54,790
Doesn't sound right to you?

1201
01:21:57,417 --> 01:21:58,794
[sighs]

1202
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:00,629
Or…

1203
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:03,340
she's an accomplice.

1204
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,053
She held the victims down, he cut 'em up.

1205
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:11,598
He died coming at a cop.

1206
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:15,435
She goes to jail for the rest of her life.

1207
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,441
Which story is it?

1208
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:30,492
Can I see myself?

1209
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:31,869
What?

1210
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:33,453
[Brianna] In the mirror.

1211
01:22:34,955 --> 01:22:38,542
I'll tell you everything
if you let me see myself.

1212
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:41,503
No.

1213
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,798
I'll say whatever you want.

1214
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:51,305
[sighs]

1215
01:22:58,437 --> 01:22:59,688
Candyman.

1216
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:07,237
Candyman.

1217
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:09,198
[scoffs] What?

1218
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,036
Candyman.

1219
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:16,872
What the fuck is that?

1220
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,502
- Candyman.
- Candyman?

1221
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:28,383
What the fuck?

1222
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:29,760
- [door rattling]
- [officer] Holy shit.

1223
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:32,012
Rooney? Jesus. What the fuck?

1224
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:35,265
[officer] 10-1, emergency. Officer down.
Officer down.

1225
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:36,767
What the fuck!

1226
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:39,228
- Get on the ground now! Now!
- [gunshots firing]

1227
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:45,192
What the fuck!

1228
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:48,487
- [officer] Let me in.
- I can't!

1229
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:49,821
[officer] Let me in, damn it!

1230
01:23:50,781 --> 01:23:52,574
- Stop!
- No, no, no, no, no!

1231
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:53,909
[shouts]

1232
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:55,827
Holy shit!

1233
01:23:57,538 --> 01:23:58,914
What the fuck?

1234
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:05,754
[bees buzzing]

1235
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:10,634
Who are you?

1236
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:14,596
[Anthony] <i>I am</i>

1237
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,390
<i>the writing on the walls.</i>

1238
01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:21,812
<i>I'm the sweet smell of blood
on the street.</i>

1239
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:26,358
<i>The buzz that echoes in the alleyways.</i>

1240
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:31,154
<i>They will say I shed innocent blood.</i>

1241
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:33,574
<i>You are far from innocent,</i>

1242
01:24:33,657 --> 01:24:35,492
<i>but they'll say you were.</i>

1243
01:24:36,493 --> 01:24:38,078
<i>That's all that matters.</i>

1244
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:43,959
[sighs]

1245
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:46,837
[breathing heavily]

1246
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:52,176
[door opens]

1247
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:55,888
[door closes]

1248
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:13,280
- [police radio, indistinct]
- [distant groans]

1249
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:19,328

[officer shouts]

1252
01:25:35,677 --> 01:25:37,387
[police sirens wailing]

1253
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:41,266
[buzzing continues]

1254
01:25:57,991 --> 01:25:59,201
Tell…

1255
01:26:00,661 --> 01:26:02,204
everyone.
