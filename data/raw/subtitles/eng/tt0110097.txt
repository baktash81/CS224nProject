<i>The Academy of Television

00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,957
<i>It's too complicated
to get into right now.</i>

3
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,693
<i>Matt, will you
get in here for God's sake!</i>

4
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:33,629
<i>Look, Ma, how can I show up?</i>

5
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:37,232
How can I show up tonight when my
union is boycotting the Emmys?

6
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:40,535
Look, I have to hang up. It's on!
Right now! Right this second!

7
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:41,602
Come on or you're gonna miss it!

8
00:00:41,604 --> 00:00:43,570
You're gonna miss it!
You're gonna miss it!

9
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:45,605
All right, I gotta go watch.

10
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,007
<i>The nominees for best actor</i>

<i>Powers Boothe,</i> Guyana

00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:15,195
<i>Powers Boothe.</i>

20
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:17,230
My!
Damn it!

21
00:01:17,232 --> 00:01:19,432
Damn it!
Damn it!

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,004
Look, he even showed up.

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,806
What an act of courage.

24
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:31,775
Yeah, he was really good in that role.

25
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:32,842
You make me crazy!

26
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:33,576
If you played someone insane

27
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:36,011
who killed someone by poisoning
a popular soft drink,

28
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,912
you would have won, too!

29
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:43,049
Yeah, I wonder if they send you
something for just being nominated.

30
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,583
Of all the pathetic questions!

31
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:48,253
Why are you so damn foul all of a sudden?

32
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:55,192
Beth, what?

33
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:58,495
<i>And I believe in the Academy.</i>

34
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,342
We've been going back and forth on
where we've been heading for so long,

35
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:20,014
I was hoping that if you won tonight,
it might mean something for us.

36
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:21,882
Marriage?

37
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:23,183
Yes.

38
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:39,732
Look, Beth, the only thing...

39
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,534
Please go fast. I can't take
your dragging this out.

40
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:47,572
The only thing that I have
against our getting married

41
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:50,107
is that it might not be fair,

42
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,777
because you... See, I love acting.
I love it so much.

43
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:58,381
And I'm just gonna stay with
it forever, no matter what.

44
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:02,852
And, you know, it's okay for me
to put up with the ups and downs,

45
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:05,521
and the money and all of that,

46
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:08,056
but it might not be fair to you.

47
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:12,660
I'm going to tell you something
that I've never told you before.

48
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:14,261
Your feelings towards your work

49
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:17,897
are one of the things
I love most about you.

50
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,232
Really?

51
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:26,437
Well, then we have no problem here.

52
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,237
Marry me.

53
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:40,715
I was just worried whether
I could make you happy.

54
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:06,071
Could you get her, honey? I've
got that big reading tomorrow.

55
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:08,572
No.

56
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:10,707
I have a busy day tomorrow, too.

57
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,241
I have to borrow on our Christmas club.

58
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:15,077
I have to cut out the coupons
from the damn newspaper

59
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,478
so I can go to the store.

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,250
Beth. Beth. I don't want you
to worry about money anymore.

61
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:24,785
Now, I didn't want
to tell you this because

62
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:28,922
it may sound strange
when I say it out loud,

63
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:33,960
but you know me, I'm not that cocky,

64
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:37,830
but I'm gonna get
<i>Kiss of the Spider Woman.</i>

65
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:42,334
I mean, it is between me or Raul,

66
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:45,670
and I've never been so sure.

67
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,671
It's weird.

68
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,273
I just know it.

69
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,541
I do.

70
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,143
Boy, am I reassured.

71
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,311
What good news.
Isn't that a load off?

72
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:02,080
I've got a baby girl in there
sleeping in a used crib

73
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:06,717
who couldn't care less what a
director named Hector Babenco thinks.

74
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,186
Beth, I'm gonna get this part.

75
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:12,488
I can't stand this anymore.

76
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,418
Hello?
<i>Matt, this is Beth.</i>

77
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,153
Beth, I'm glad you
finally returned my call.

78
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:49,489
<i>Don't sound so self-righteous
about not returning calls.</i>

79
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:51,057
What are you so mad about?

80
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:51,657
<i>I'm talking about you!</i>

81
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,593
<i>Taking your share of the responsibility...</i>
You know, Beth...

82
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:56,728
Beth, you're not the only
one that can scream!

83
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,131
You know, I can scream too, you know!

84
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:04,634
You know what?
<i>What?</i>

85
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:07,269
I'm being sort of a gutless wonder here.

86
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:09,771
I'm arguing back with you
because I'm embarrassed.

87
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:12,507
I won't be able to take
the kid when I said.

88
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,643
Beth, now listen. Wait a second.
Listen to me.

89
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:18,345
<i>You're taking her.
You're taking her.</i>

90
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:20,180
<i>You're taking her.
Do you know how long...</i>

91
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:21,681
Beth, I know exactly how long it's been,

92
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:25,051
and I feel strange as hell at not
seeing her, but this isn't a choice.

93
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:27,787
I'm broke. It's a dry spell in my life.

94
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:28,821
<i>That's not my problem.</i>

95
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,389
I know that's not your problem,

96
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,691
but it's no place
for a six-year-old.

97
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:33,491
What can I do?

98
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,993
The only full-time job
I seem to have right now

99
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,261
is not showing how scared I am.

100
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,496
<i>Is that something you're trying
to say particularly well?</i>

101
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:44,233
No, that's not something I tried
to say particularly well.

102
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:47,035
<i>Well, it was very well put.</i>
Well, thanks.

103
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:49,203
<i>But you're still taking your daughter!</i>

104
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:50,537
<i>And there's no way...</i>

105
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:51,004
Beth! Hey!

106
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:53,239
<i>Look, let me tell you what you are.</i>
Beth! Hey, hey!

107
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:57,076
Never mind! I'll take her!
Bye! <i>What kind of...</i>

108
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:01,346
I must get work.
I will take anything.

109
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:02,146
I must get work!

110
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:06,450
I must not be embarrassed
by these pep talks to myself!

111
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:08,552
Popcorn Pictures.

112
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:12,222
The truck is ridiculous.
Get the Lexus. Get the Lexus.

113
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,389
It's nuts here today.

114
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,392
Cathy, Matt Hobbs on one.

115
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:19,828
Hi, this is Cathy.

116
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,929
Sure I remember you.
Sure.

117
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:25,065
Just a minute.
I have another call.

118
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:29,268
Hey.
Hello. How are you?

119
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,036
Hi. Do you know a...

120
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:31,503
Hey, Shannon!

121
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:35,240
Don't ever refer to me or any
of us again as "D" people.

122
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:37,642
We are Development Executives.

123
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:38,843
There's an easy way to remember that.

124
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:40,744
We're what you want to be. Sorry.

125
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:42,779
What? Do you know a Matt Hobbs?

126
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:44,247
Matt Hobbs?
Matt Hobbs?

127
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:46,315
It does ring a dull something or other...

128
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:47,949
He's the guy Redford
played in <i>The Natural.</i>

129
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:50,084
No, no, no, that's Roy Hobbs.

130
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:50,784
There is a Matt Hobbs.

131
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:55,922
If I were you, I would be cautiously
enthusiastic until I figured out who that was.

132
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:59,692
Hi. Sorry. I was just finishing
a script evaluation, Matt.

133
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:02,895
So, is everything okay?

134
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:06,131
Good, good.
I haven't seen you since...

135
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,566
The last time we saw...

136
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:12,002
The one time we saw each other.

137
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:16,239
The night at the acting school.

138
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:18,708
Sure. Matt, hi.

139
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,945
Actually, I do know of something

140
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:25,047
that's starting in a hurry.

141
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,516
They're auditioning here today.

142
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:29,451
I can get you in.

143
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:31,052
No, no. No problem.

144
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,486
Yeah.
I'll see you later.

145
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:36,156
No, no, don't thank me.
You didn't interrupt anything.

146
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:38,825
This script is beyond awful.

147
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,459
Bye.

148
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,635
Even the title, <i>Little Dick,</i>
means so many things.

149
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:54,105
Story, story, story, story.

150
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:56,307
This one you loved, right?

151
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,609
I had some problems.

152
00:08:59,011 --> 00:08:59,909
Like what?

153
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,977
What? It is
a little garbagey.

154
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,445
So? It has to be
cast right.

155
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:06,881
If Cathy doesn't like it,
we know it's a smash.

156
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:08,215
Hey.

157
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:12,685
- Popcorn Pictures.
- Please hold.

158
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,386
It's not like I didn't recommend it.

159
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,389
No, I'm sorry.
He's not available.

160
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,825
No, I understand, but I
can't interrupt. Really.

161
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,895
If he checks with me, I'll have
him call you as soon as I can.

162
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,529
What did you say your number was?

163
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:30,734
You know, I wasn't sure you would
remember me, let alone help.

164
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,368
Stop! You're good.

165
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,404
I am doing them a favor
by getting you in.

166
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:38,006
Well, that's a fresh slant.

167
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:46,345
No, no, you're at the top
of the list. I promise you.

168
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:48,680
Claire, this is Matt Hobbs.

169
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:51,049
How you doing, Claire?
It's good to meet you.

170
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:53,051
Same here.

171
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:56,120
Please.

172
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:59,823
Hi, I'm George LaForest. I'm
here for the part of Harry.

173
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,791
Okay.
Have a seat next to him.

174
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,058
Thanks.

175
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:18,506
Hey.

176
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:25,779
This is Matt Hobbs.

177
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:28,314
This is John Earl McAlpine, our director.

178
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,148
Good to meet you.

179
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,017
Burke Adler, our producer.

180
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,251
Okay, fine.

181
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:38,821
So, what have you
been doing with yourself

182
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:39,921
in the last few years?

183
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:43,691
Look, if you don't mind,
I'm really bad at interviews,

184
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:46,226
and I'd really prefer just to read first.

185
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,727
That's the way you'd like to do it?

186
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:48,260
Yes.
I see.

187
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:50,262
Okay, I'll tell you what,
why read at all?

188
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,330
Why don't we just give you the role?
Okay?

189
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,166
You want the part?
We don't have to read.

190
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:00,236
No, no, I'm serious.
Really.

191
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:03,205
Very good
in the mini-series.

192
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,240
Yeah, he got an Emmy nomination for it.

193
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:07,208
You know, there are all different ways.

194
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,442
Did you know Bertolucci
never reads actors?

195
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:11,945
Just looks at them, feels around a
little bit and then he decides.

196
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:14,681
Doesn't read a word.
Well, I also have a way.

197
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:16,049
I like to interview first,
then I like to read.

198
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,117
Maybe come back the next
day, do it all over again.

199
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,119
I'll call people up
the actor's worked with.

200
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:21,053
I'll check him out if he's famous,

201
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,754
I'll do an opinion survey
to see if people like him.

202
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:24,055
If he's not famous, I'll put him on tape,

203
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:26,524
grab anybody I can find
and show them the tape.

204
00:11:26,526 --> 00:11:27,758
That's the way I like to do it.

205
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,292
I believe in screen tests.

206
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:31,193
I believe in cutting people
out if the dailies are bad.

207
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:33,595
I believe in replacing people
if the previews aren't there.

208
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:39,634
Because I don't make movies for theaters
that serve cappuccino in the lobby.

209
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:40,568
I make popcorn movies.

210
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,304
You want to know what I like, come
to my house, look at my lamps.

211
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,373
That's what I like. But you're
not gonna find it in my movies.

212
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,975
In my movies, you'll see what I know,

213
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:49,675
and what I know is detail.

214
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:52,044
And what I don't know, I discover.
I'll tell you something.

215
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,413
Yesterday we were mixing this
last scene in a movie, right?

216
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:58,049
Huge field of windmills. Big windmills.
Now, they blow up.

217
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,950
The propellers come loose.
They slice through the air.

218
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,153
One of them hits this
four-story tank of propane gas.

219
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,288
There's this humongous explosion.

220
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,956
Now, I'm sitting there going, "Louder!"

221
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,824
"It's gotta be louder,
louder, louder, louder!"

222
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:13,161
They're saying to me, "We can't make it
louder. There's too much distortion."

223
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:13,761
We went louder.

224
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:16,630
See, they discovered a thing, a filter.
I don't know what they did.

225
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:18,031
But the fact is, we did it.

226
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,767
I don't question.
I just do it.

227
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,969
So if you're asking me
can you do it differently,

228
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:26,105
you don't want to talk, you
just want to read, I say...

229
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:28,774
Ask him, he's the director.

230
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:31,842
Whatever.

231
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:35,812
Okay. Good. Let's go. Any questions?

232
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:39,882
They only gave me two pages.

233
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,850
And I really want to
give this my best shot,

234
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:44,819
so if I could read the script
and then come back.

235
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:47,054
The part works tomorrow.

236
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,224
Okay.

237
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:52,491
Who will I read with?

238
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:53,859
Right here.

239
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:56,594
I'll play Wendy.

240
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:04,234
Over there, okay?

241
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:10,272
What? What is it? What are you holding?
What does it say?

242
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:12,974
They need John for the physical.
They won't wait.

243
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:16,377
Time for my buns to have visitors.

244
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,749
All right.
Go ahead.

245
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:26,652
Go ahead?
The director just left.

246
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:29,221
So? He trusts me.

247
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:33,324
Anyway, we're just doing the first page.

248
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,301
Let's start with "I've
been so..." Just...

249
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:58,546
You know...

250
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,982
God, I've been so messed up.

251
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:06,152
Maybe all the bad stuff was in my mind?

252
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:07,219
Right?

253
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,120
"Okay, darling Harry, here it is."

254
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:11,021
"If someone were breaking up with me,"

255
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:15,692
"I'd like it short and sweet.
What about you?"

256
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:20,796
"Incredibly drawn out."

257
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:26,167
"I can't take care of you right now.
What am I, your mother?"

258
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,868
"What am I, your duck?"

259
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,236
"You know, we've been
together for two years"

260
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:32,372
"and you act like you're
blowing away some feathers,"

261
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:33,439
"so what I'm asking you..."

262
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,073
You didn't do the quack.

263
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,276
Stage direction says for him to quack.
You didn't do it.

264
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,311
Over there.

265
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,847
Yeah.
But, you know,

266
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:50,185
why would he quack when somebody
is breaking up with him?

267
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:54,621
Well, hopefully because it's funny.

268
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:56,122
But this isn't a comedy.

269
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:57,890
Then we're in a lot of trouble,

270
00:14:57,892 --> 00:14:59,892
'cause they're already
fall-down laughing

271
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:04,396
at the teaser trailer in 5,235 theaters!

272
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:06,564
Yes, it's a comedy.

273
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:08,264
Comedy.

274
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,634
I think I need to make
an adjustment here.

275
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:16,504
No. You know what?
You're not right for this.

276
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:17,605
But, Martin, I like him.

277
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:19,807
I want to bring him back
for something else. Okay?

278
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,508
Okay.

279
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,942
Sure.

280
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:26,211
- Thank you.
- Bye.

281
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:28,813
It was very touching.

282
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:32,282
Burke wants everybody starting
for the preview. Cathy!

283
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:35,985
You know, I got all the way to the
car, and I forgot to thank you.

284
00:15:35,987 --> 00:15:39,088
Sure, how'd it go?

285
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,923
Well, I didn't get it.

286
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:42,223
Strange man.

287
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:44,858
He did say something about
wanting me back, though.

288
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,294
Well, good. His saver is
he means what he says.

289
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:51,130
Well, I just wanted to say thanks.

290
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,665
Let's go. He wants everybody
at the preview early.

291
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,333
I'm coming, I'm coming.

292
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:57,168
Don't be sad.

293
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:00,504
No.

294
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,138
No.

295
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,038
So long, Matt.

296
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,241
That's Matt.
How do you know him?

297
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,542
Well,

298
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:10,611
I was, auditing this acting class and...

299
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:12,779
He filled in teaching one night.

300
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:15,615
He did a scene himself,
and he was awesome.

301
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:18,851
For some reason
he just can't get arrested.

302
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:21,819
Listen. Just listen to me.

303
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:27,124
<i>It is very important that you
get here exactly on time.</i>

304
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,391
Beth.

305
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:29,392
<i>Very important, Matt.</i>

306
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,994
I'm gonna tell you,
it just makes more sense

307
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:34,696
if you put her on a plane in Georgia.
Hey, you, actor! You!

308
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:36,798
And I'll be right here to pick her up.

309
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,732
<i>Absolutely not.</i>
You know what I mean?

310
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,934
I'm so lucky to run into somebody I know.
What's your name again?

311
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:42,903
Excuse me, I'm on the phone. <i>Matt,
don't have two conversations at once.</i>

312
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:45,672
Hang up, hang up. Excuse me.
I'm on the phone, please.

313
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:47,640
<i>Matt, listen to me.</i>
I'm sorry, Beth.

314
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:49,608
Where's my driver? Why do you think?
If I pick her up,

315
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,210
it's going to end up costing
an extra $480. Hang up.

316
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,212
It's senseless. Please, please. Hang up.

317
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,380
<i>I said no.</i>
Why are you so upset?

318
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,048
You know, it doesn't
have to be like this.

319
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,449
Please.
<i>Yes, it does.</i>

320
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,718
Okay, okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

321
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,753
Is Jeannie there?

322
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,688
<i>Just be here on time, okay?</i>

323
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,655
Is Jeannie there?

324
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,590
<i>Just be here on time.</i>

325
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:09,857
Tell her I said hi.

326
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,025
<i>I will. Okay.</i>
All right, so long.

327
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:14,093
What...
I got a crisis!

328
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:16,528
This kid who's supposed to
drive me is 30 minutes late.

329
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,196
Everybody from my office is gone.

330
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,131
Now, I have a very big movie opening.

331
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,266
There's a test screening
in the valley in 45 minutes.

332
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:24,034
Do you have any idea
how important this is?

333
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:24,868
Do you know what I'm talking about?

334
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,670
Is that what this is all about?
You need a lift?

335
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,505
Yes, yes.

336
00:17:31,242 --> 00:17:33,075
Okay, I got my car right over here.

337
00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:34,643
Wait up.

338
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,512
This is your car?

339
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:40,379
Yeah.

340
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,519
How late are you?
How late are you?

341
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:51,421
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Were you surfing?
Not just today.

342
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,322
There's no way you're
ever going to make it.

343
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:53,889
You are going to fail!

344
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:55,657
Listen, listen, I know about this.
You're gonna be a failure!

345
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:59,460
Look, a guy got shot on the freeway.
Traffic was all tied up.

346
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:02,963
You should leave time
for that kind of thing!

347
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,565
Let's go. You said
you'd give me a lift.

348
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:06,866
What the hell are you talking about?

349
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,868
Not in your car.
I got my own.

350
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,803
I'll give you $120 to take me.

351
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:14,006
And don't worry.
It'll still be a favor.

352
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:21,213
What do you need me for?
Don't you drive?

353
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:22,847
Yeah, I drive.

354
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:26,382
I don't like to look for parking.

355
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:43,398
Keep driving.

356
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,233
She runs the test screenings.
Very smart, very...

357
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:49,837
She's got a real case on me. So far
I've been keeping it in the bank.

358
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:06,684
Hello. Welcome.

359
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:10,020
The name of the picture you'll
be seeing is <i>Ground Zero.</i>

360
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:14,424
There may be some scratches.
Some of the colors may be off.

361
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:15,558
There are no titles,

362
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,561
and it has not been
finally mixed for sound.

363
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:20,329
And the music is temp.

364
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:21,730
That means temporary.

365
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:24,566
So thank you all for coming
and enjoy the show.

366
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:31,505
Come on.
Here we go.

367
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,541
Nothing good that happens tonight

368
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:37,110
will make feeling the way
I do right now worth it.

369
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:38,112
Nothing.

370
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:43,015
Please, God, let tonight give him peace.

371
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:46,184
Nan!
No prayers.

372
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,952
Forgive my manners.
I'm Nan.

373
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,920
Have you two met?
Yeah.

374
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:51,922
Good.

375
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:55,156
Turn it down!

376
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:58,692
Lower it!
That hurt!

377
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:01,226
Yeah, I'm divorced, too.

378
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:03,728
Yeah, my daughter's six.

379
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,729
Mine's 11.

380
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:06,764
11, yeah.

381
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:09,466
She's coming out here.
I'm gonna go pick her up.

382
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:10,266
Good.

383
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:11,667
I remember how it was for us

384
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,069
when my daughter and I moved
out here from Washington.

385
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,838
Well, she's only gonna
be here for three weeks.

386
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:20,941
Washington.
Washington?

387
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:23,576
Boy, that must have been
a big adjustment.

388
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:24,910
It wasn't that bad.

389
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:27,946
Both places have a lot in common.

390
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,581
Over-privileged people,

391
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,585
crazed by their fear
of losing their privileges.

392
00:20:35,187 --> 00:20:37,120
Alcoholism.

393
00:20:37,422 --> 00:20:39,054
Addiction.

394
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:40,321
Betrayal.

395
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:46,160
The near total degradation of
what once were grand motives.

396
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:49,563
The same spiritual bloodletting.

397
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,633
I kind of do miss the seasons though.

398
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,902
What?

399
00:20:56,904 --> 00:20:59,070
What?

400
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:04,241
So how long has it been since
you've seen your daughter?

401
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:07,310
A little over two years.

402
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:09,045
Two years?

403
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:14,016
Well, my ex-wife insisted
on moving back to Georgia,

404
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:16,985
and I was in the Philippines
on a mini-series...

405
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:17,518
Please!

406
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,086
It's one thing to be a son of a bitch.

407
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:21,521
You don't have to be
a stupid son of a bitch.

408
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:24,023
People move heaven and
earth to see their kids.

409
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:26,859
I don't care if she moved to Pluto.
It's abandonment.

410
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:29,561
Hey, wait a minute.
We just met.

411
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:32,463
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:57,886 --> 00:21:59,919
<i>Sorry to bust your chops.</i>

413
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:03,822
Faster, people.
Faster, please!

414
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:07,058
Very good. Who else? Yeah, yeah.

415
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,426
All right.

416
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,828
All right, we're running behind on Hispanics.
Let's go, people.

417
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,597
Women over 25. Women under 25. Past 40.

418
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,032
Males under 25.
Males over 25.

419
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,867
I just never thought
it would do that well.

420
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:22,468
There were so many holes.

421
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,470
I told everybody it
wasn't gonna do business.

422
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:27,973
Why am I so public with my opinions?

423
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:29,040
You might just be right.

424
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,475
Not with that score.

425
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:36,512
Here, here.

426
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,182
I got it.

427
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:43,250
You know,

428
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:47,520
maybe tonight's the night
I'm losing my entire mind,

429
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:50,055
but weren't you in <i>Platoon?</i>

430
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:53,590
That's incredible.

431
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,358
You know, I was only
in there for a minute.

432
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,329
In the rape scene, moving past Charlie
Sheen when I left the Quonset hut.

433
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:04,032
I had a great scene, but it was cut out.

434
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:07,335
But there was that one long
close-up where you seemed,

435
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:09,570
ashamed of yourself,

436
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:11,338
but still arrogant?

437
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,672
No?

438
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:17,742
That's exactly what I was going for.

439
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,944
It was?
Yeah.

440
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:24,315
Yeah.

441
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:25,749
I'll take my...

442
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:30,651
Thanks.

443
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:32,953
You read all those scripts?

444
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,921
Beast of burden.

445
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:36,588
Okay.

446
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:47,798
So what are you?
Totally wonderful or what?

447
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,999
I...

448
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:56,905
Good night.

449
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:11,686
So how come you haven't said anything?
This is great, right?

450
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:13,220
No.

451
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:14,154
What no?

452
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:17,757
The definite recommends are way
off for a score this high.

453
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,761
And even for action-adventure,
it's just too low for women.

454
00:24:21,763 --> 00:24:23,562
But it was such a good score.

455
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,063
I know.

456
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,130
I'm sorry.

457
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:31,967
And, unfortunately, yesterday's
tracking wasn't...

458
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,570
I'm sorry.

459
00:24:34,572 --> 00:24:39,741
They just don't seem in the mood
for action-adventure right now.

460
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:46,413
I think it's so wonderful

461
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:50,683
that you don't worry about
even trying to act strong.

462
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:53,484
Thanks.

463
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:56,920
Hey,

464
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,856
you wanna eat something sometime?

465
00:25:01,392 --> 00:25:03,191
I'm...

466
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,462
I'm blushing from head to foot.

467
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:10,196
Good.

468
00:25:10,264 --> 00:25:12,130
I'll call you.

469
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:14,631
Maybe I'll come by the office tomorrow.

470
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:17,166
Ten, 15 and 20.

471
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:18,600
Thank you.
Yep.

472
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,802
You know, I was gonna
offer you this regularly,

473
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:23,738
but I thought it would humiliate you.

474
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,073
I don't mind an occasional odd job.

475
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:29,309
But I can't work tomorrow.
I gotta get my kid.

476
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,577
All right.
Let's go.

477
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:38,850
I gotta look at the cards.
I'll ride back here.

478
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:57,666
I shouldn't be long.

479
00:25:57,668 --> 00:26:00,402
Okay.
We'll make your plane.

480
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:28,595
Hi, are you Matt?

481
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:31,931
I didn't know if we
could wait much longer.

482
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:37,602
She's a real nut on smoking
anywhere near the kid.

483
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:39,870
Just... One...

484
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:43,440
Come on in.

485
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:01,690
You wait here.

486
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,665
Hello.

487
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:12,966
Hi.

488
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:14,901
Did you two meet?

489
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:17,135
No, not really.

490
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,137
Is she ready?
I have a taxi waiting.

491
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,038
I just have to say goodbye to her.

492
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,374
You have no idea how difficult that is.

493
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:28,211
It's three weeks.

494
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,546
It's not three weeks.

495
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:32,547
Yes, it is.

496
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:34,015
No, it's not.

497
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,349
Yes, it is.

498
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:37,050
He doesn't know?

499
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:45,057
You're not taking her for a visit.

500
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,759
You're taking her for a while.

501
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:52,597
Just because you want to go off
with him, doesn't mean I have to...

502
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,498
You're getting the wrong idea.
I don't think so.

503
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,200
No matter how you put
this, I don't think so!

504
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:58,434
Hey, look, I'm a United States marshal.

505
00:27:58,436 --> 00:28:03,305
I'm here because she didn't show up
yesterday to start serving her time.

506
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:12,312
I don't have a choice.

507
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:14,647
You don't have a choice.

508
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:20,384
What did she do?

509
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:23,219
I loved, helped and supported,
in every way possible,

510
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:25,221
a businessman who committed
the terrible crime

511
00:28:25,223 --> 00:28:29,725
of being financially imaginative
with a pension fund.

512
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:35,797
Jeannie, come over here.
I want to talk to you.

513
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,699
Okay, there.

514
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:42,201
Now listen carefully.
Be still.

515
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:45,871
What's the most important
thing in life to know?

516
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:49,474
No one will ever love me
as much as you do.

517
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:50,141
Good.

518
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:52,343
Now concentrate with all your muscles

519
00:28:52,345 --> 00:28:55,846
and remember everything
I'm about to say to you.

520
00:28:55,848 --> 00:28:59,182
Don't talk to strangers.
They may be monsters.

521
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:03,719
Take your vitamins so the poison
in the food can't hurt you.

522
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,554
What else now?
Teeth.

523
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:07,455
Right! Thank you.

524
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:09,023
Brush right after you eat

525
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:12,793
or your gums will start to bleed
in your sleep and choke you.

526
00:29:12,795 --> 00:29:14,528
Beth, Beth, Beth!
Mrs. Hobbs...

527
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,530
What? I'm giving
Jeannie her reminders.

528
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:20,000
Her reminders? You can't say
things like that to a little girl.

529
00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:22,235
No, don't.
Don't dare.

530
00:29:22,237 --> 00:29:23,836
Don't criticize the way I mother her

531
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:26,605
or I think I'll start to
scream and never stop!

532
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:27,606
Mrs. Hobbs.
Yes?

533
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:30,976
You know, I've been involved with
this sort of thing for a long time.

534
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,445
You're not gonna criticize me, are you?

535
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:34,078
Not in front of him.

536
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,115
Because all he's done is send
Jeannie these long, stupid letters.

537
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:40,283
He doesn't even realize she can't read.

538
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:43,552
He sends letters to
somebody who can't read.

539
00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:44,920
It's almost funny.

540
00:29:44,922 --> 00:29:47,455
I thought you'd read them to her.

541
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,225
The meter's running.
All right.

542
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,660
Can I just have another minute with her?

543
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:59,230
Jeannie, Jeannie,
come here. Come here.

544
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,501
That's a very good outfit
you just picked out.

545
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,669
Mrs. Hobbs.

546
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,283
Hi. Hi, hi,
hi, hi, hi.

547
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:31,159
What have you been telling her?

548
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:38,299
Okay, love, Mommy's going to help
others who need her for a few years,

549
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:41,535
and you're going with Daddy,
as I explained.

550
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:47,239
Look at me. Don't step
in the street alone.

551
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:49,841
You don't want to lose a foot.
Remember the story I told you.

552
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:52,443
Now if someone ever comes up
and offers you candy,

553
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:54,611
you scream for the police immediately.

554
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:58,448
Stranger, danger, Jeannie.
Stranger, danger.

555
00:31:00,452 --> 00:31:03,386
Beginning now, you must give less value

556
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,821
to your own happiness
and well-being.

557
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,823
Then, hopefully, you will reach a point

558
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:11,159
where you give that no value whatsoever.

559
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,727
Give her everything.

560
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:15,596
There's no such thing
as spoiling a child.

561
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:17,631
Even if you have to steal to do it?

562
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:20,667
You don't really want to
mess with me, do you?

563
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:21,200
No.

564
00:31:21,202 --> 00:31:23,302
Come on, Jeannie.
We've got to go.

565
00:31:23,304 --> 00:31:24,536
I want to go with you.

566
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:27,272
Can't, pretty heart.
I'm sorry.

567
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:29,274
Not even a compromise?

568
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:33,578
Okay, the compromise will be that
you don't have to ride in back.

569
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,448
What? You can ride up front
with the driver, okay?

570
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,250
Now, remember, Jeannie,
don't talk to strangers.

571
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:42,819
Don't forget to say
your prayers at night.

572
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:45,555
Remember God.
He made you.

573
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,888
Can we go, please?

574
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,757
Yeah. To the airport? Yes.

575
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:00,867
Goodbye, sweetness.

576
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,502
You think of me!

577
00:32:06,273 --> 00:32:08,840
<i>Tonight, Atlanta's own
Attman's Theater for the Arts</i>

578
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:13,177
<i>presents kids' comedy theater on
Saturday from 1:00 to 5:00...</i>

579
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,254
It'll be okay.

580
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,655
I'm your dad, you know,

581
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:29,124
so it'll be okay.

582
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,827
You and I will make it okay.

583
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:35,462
You ever ridden in a plane before?

584
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:36,729
Yes.

585
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,285
Don't stare at me.

586
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:05,089
Sorry.

587
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:10,660
I want to put on my yellow dress.

588
00:33:13,331 --> 00:33:16,598
We can't get the yellow dress
'cause it's underneath the plane.

589
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,367
Why don't you run under there and get it?

590
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:22,903
It's underneath the plane,
so we can't get it.

591
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:24,838
I want my yellow dress.

592
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,472
Please!
I want my yellow dress!

593
00:33:26,474 --> 00:33:28,240
Jeannie, it's impossible.
It's impossible. Please!

594
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:31,142
Please, I want it! It's underneath the plane.
We can't get it.

595
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:32,877
I want my yellow dress!

596
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:36,647
Please, I want my yellow dress!
Jeannie, please.

597
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:38,415
Please, give it to me!

598
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,883
All right, all right, Jeannie.

599
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,051
Jeannie, listen to me. Give
it to me, give it to me,

600
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,852
give it to me, give it to me!
Jeannie, Jeannie.

601
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:45,820
Jeannie, it's impossible.
It's underneath the plane.

602
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:48,490
Don't, don't kick the seat.

603
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,959
I want to put on my yellow dress!

604
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:53,494
Jeannie.
Give me a compromise!

605
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:54,595
All right, you want a compromise?

606
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:57,598
As soon as we land,
that's the compromise.

607
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,199
Don't hit her!

608
00:33:59,201 --> 00:34:02,569
I didn't hit her.
She hit herself.

609
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:05,004
Let go, let go, let go!
Jeannie!

610
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:07,006
Let go, let go!

611
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:08,940
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

612
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:11,542
<i>the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign.</i>

613
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:13,043
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

614
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:15,378
Jeannie.
Jeannie.

615
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,545
Jeannie! Jeannie...

616
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:17,712
Sir, the seat belt sign is on!

617
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:21,182
Jeannie, please, we have to sit down.
Sir, please.

618
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,684
Jeannie...

619
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:27,220
I want my dress!

620
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:32,291
I have no idea what to do.

621
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:36,796
God.

622
00:34:51,376 --> 00:34:53,943
Okay, partner.

623
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:56,545
Okay. All right.
What?

624
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:00,181
Where you going now?

625
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:04,384
All right. I'll have you
in bed in a second.

626
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,792
It's cheerier in the daytime.

627
00:35:22,035 --> 00:35:23,834
Can you read the sign?

628
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:26,636
The Jeannie part.

629
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:28,871
Yeah.
All right.

630
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:52,624
Where do I sleep?

631
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:56,127
I have a sleeping bag...

632
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:58,362
Or a bed.

633
00:35:59,631 --> 00:36:01,697
Which do you want?

634
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:07,903
That.

635
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:09,904
Okay.

636
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:30,924
Socks off?
Okay, in bed.

637
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:45,237
Hug?

638
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,571
Hug?

639
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,516
Let go.

640
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,952
Let go.

641
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:16,331
<i>Mr. Adler, I've given
Mr. Vincent another note.</i>

642
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,666
<i>He knows you're holding.</i>

643
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,954
<i>Mr. Adler,
he's running late,</i>

644
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:45,489
<i>and he asked me to read you this.</i>

645
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:47,224
<i>"I've gone over</i>
<i>the</i> Ground Zero <i>test scores.</i>

646
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:50,126
<i>"And I think we must..."
He underlines must.</i>

647
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:53,829
<i>"Delay the release of the film until we
see the results of the next preview."</i>

648
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:57,299
<i>"I'm also concerned that the
running time is now 78 minutes."</i>

649
00:37:57,301 --> 00:37:59,501
<i>"I'll speak to you
after the next test."</i>

650
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:02,070
<i>Sorry.
The "sorry" was mine.</i>

651
00:38:21,557 --> 00:38:22,557
Monica?

652
00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:25,024
Yeah, is Leslie up yet?

653
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:30,429
Good. I didn't want you to get worried
when you realized I wasn't there.

654
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:32,597
I'm...

655
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:35,099
I'm still with that man.

656
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:37,800
Well, I'll tell you about it later.

657
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:41,770
But it sure is nice
to have wobbly legs again.

658
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:45,373
Yeah, look, today is recycling
day for Leslie at school,

659
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:48,242
so give her some empty cans.

660
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:51,078
Well, then dump some soda out.

661
00:38:51,814 --> 00:38:54,648
Yeah, well, thank you.

662
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:58,117
Yeah. Well,
take good care.

663
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:25,876
I thought you took off
in the middle of the night.

664
00:39:25,878 --> 00:39:28,945
No, no, I just had to call home.

665
00:39:28,947 --> 00:39:31,514
Is that why you're upset?

666
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:33,015
No.

667
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:48,262
How you doing?

668
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:50,063
I'm from next door.

669
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:50,897
Right across the hall.

670
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:53,900
And I've seen you in the
laundry room with your kids.

671
00:39:53,902 --> 00:39:56,168
Hello.
So... Hello.

672
00:39:58,005 --> 00:39:59,771
Who are you?

673
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:03,707
I'm Lucy Grizada.

674
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,642
What's your name?

675
00:40:06,644 --> 00:40:08,677
Say "Jeannie."

676
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,314
I need somebody to help me
and her on short notice.

677
00:40:13,316 --> 00:40:15,749
You know, I have seen you in
the building with your kids,

678
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:19,085
and I was hoping you knew someone
that I could leave her with.

679
00:40:19,087 --> 00:40:22,755
I've got a new job that starts now.
Do you know anyone?

680
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:24,656
Well, I'm always here.

681
00:40:24,658 --> 00:40:27,025
Maybe I could do it myself.

682
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:28,426
Great! Great!

683
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,461
We'll work out
a full-time schedule.

684
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:31,829
Wait!

685
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:42,505
Why don't you go in and
meet Ricky and Essa. Okay?

686
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:45,040
We're gonna make fruit bars.

687
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:50,444
Why don't you leave her for a
while and then we'll talk?

688
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,246
Sort of a test?

689
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,482
No. Just to see
how it works out.

690
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:06,657
Birdie.

691
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:08,558
Please behave.

692
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,962
I don't know what we'll do
if this doesn't work out.

693
00:41:12,964 --> 00:41:15,297
So behave, sweetheart.

694
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:16,731
Behave.

695
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:22,235
All right. Thank you.
She'll be fine.

696
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:55,967
Shoot.

697
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:17,251
I'm sorry I bothered you.

698
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:19,987
Come on, Jeannie.
Let's go.

699
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:21,722
Come on. Let's go.
Wait, wait, wait.

700
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:24,424
Wait. Can I have her
just a little while longer?

701
00:42:24,426 --> 00:42:27,794
My little boy just fell, and she's
the only one he lets hold him.

702
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:32,799
Your little boy fell. He's
the one that's screaming.

703
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:36,102
Yes, she can stay.

704
00:42:36,104 --> 00:42:38,137
All right, Jeannie.

705
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:38,737
Jeannie.

706
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:41,906
No, no, that's okay.
That's okay.

707
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:47,777
Women over 25, under 25.
Count! So go ahead.

708
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:52,014
So they moved her up to first class.

709
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:54,883
Don't worry.

710
00:42:55,852 --> 00:43:00,287
My daughter used to have fits in
supermarkets when we first moved here.

711
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:01,821
It's all so perfectly normal.

712
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:04,990
Plus, I know a great
psychiatric children's group.

713
00:43:04,992 --> 00:43:06,591
No, no, no, no.

714
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:11,028
What breaks your heart
about Jeannie is that...

715
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:15,198
She... She doesn't think
anything can help.

716
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:18,200
She's...

717
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,071
She's lucky she has a daddy
who cares, believe me.

718
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:26,707
I don't know if lucky's the word.

719
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:28,074
You know,

720
00:43:28,076 --> 00:43:30,409
I'm hoping that she's
asleep when I get home

721
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:33,245
so I don't have to deal with her.

722
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:37,448
I'm actually afraid of my own kid.

723
00:43:40,653 --> 00:43:41,318
My God.

724
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,854
I've had exactly that feeling
and never said it aloud.

725
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,122
Excuse me, Nan. Here are the cards.
You could...

726
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,023
Never mind.
I'll do it. Thanks.

727
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:51,191
Very good? Fair?

728
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:55,795
I felt terrible, the way that I blew
up at you when I first met you.

729
00:43:55,797 --> 00:43:59,231
It was really rude. No, please.
No, no, no.

730
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:02,867
Quickly! Come on!
Let's count!

731
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:10,707
I began taking antidepressants when
we moved here from Washington.

732
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:12,308
I had some side effects.

733
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,310
Sleeping 14 hours, no libido,

734
00:44:14,312 --> 00:44:17,046
I gained 17 pounds in nine
days, that sort of thing.

735
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:19,114
So they gave me pills to
deal with the side effects,

736
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:23,017
then pills to deal with the side effects
I was getting from those pills.

737
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:27,121
All this besides the stuff the
nutritionist was giving me.

738
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:30,524
The combination formed some sort of...

739
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:31,624
Potion.

740
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:34,526
So I keep telling the truth.
I don't have a choice.

741
00:44:34,528 --> 00:44:37,695
That's why I was so rude to you.

742
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:41,097
It's true.

743
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,998
Thanks.

744
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,632
Your doctor says this?

745
00:44:44,634 --> 00:44:47,167
Yes.
He's excited.

746
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:48,701
He's monitoring me for a while longer

747
00:44:48,703 --> 00:44:50,469
before writing it up
for a medical journal.

748
00:44:50,471 --> 00:44:52,471
Burke's going crazy
waiting for the score.

749
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:55,607
Okay. All right.
Thanks. Coming!

750
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:02,445
So, how are you anyway?

751
00:45:02,613 --> 00:45:05,146
I'm...

752
00:45:06,048 --> 00:45:07,947
It's a tough one?

753
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:09,248
Me, too.

754
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:12,550
Hey, Cathy! Come on!

755
00:45:12,552 --> 00:45:15,553
Nan, I didn't say... I can barely hear you.
You're getting fuzzy.

756
00:45:15,555 --> 00:45:18,556
We're right here at the office anyway.
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

757
00:45:18,558 --> 00:45:21,125
Stop right here
so I can hear her, please.

758
00:45:21,127 --> 00:45:21,792
Nan, you're breaking up.

759
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:24,528
Look, my daughter's home with a baby-sitter
for the first time. I gotta go.

760
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,996
Would you wait one second, please?

761
00:45:25,998 --> 00:45:27,897
I can't hear you.
Back up an inch.

762
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,965
- Keep talking, Nan.
<i>- I said that...</i>

763
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:33,635
I can't hear you. Go forward two inches.
Keep talking, please.

764
00:45:33,637 --> 00:45:35,503
Stop right there!
Go back again.

765
00:45:35,505 --> 00:45:39,006
Nan, you're fading. There! Right there.
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

766
00:45:39,008 --> 00:45:41,608
You checked over every card yourself?

767
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,809
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

768
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:43,709
Did we do well with any group at all?

769
00:45:43,711 --> 00:45:48,180
<i>Eleven-year-old boys, but there were
only three of them in the audience.</i>

770
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:49,714
Just three 11-year-olds?

771
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:53,484
<i>Honey, I know you'll feel better soon.</i>

772
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:54,918
<i>It's only a movie.</i>

773
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,452
Yeah, right. See you.

774
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,520
<i>And I love...</i>

775
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,355
I'm all alone.

776
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,056
At least there's that.

777
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:06,892
I don't wanna go!

778
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:09,127
Everybody is tired!
You can come back tomorrow.

779
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:13,564
I want to live with them! I
want to live with those people!

780
00:46:13,566 --> 00:46:15,632
God, let me live there!

781
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:18,067
Jeannie. Jeannie.

782
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,037
Please, Lucy, don't make me go!

783
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,871
Maybe if she just stayed tonight.

784
00:46:24,873 --> 00:46:27,840
I love it here so much that...

785
00:46:29,643 --> 00:46:32,377
Daddy says I can stay.

786
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:39,883
I think it's terrible to
give her what she pleases,

787
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:42,452
especially when she acts like that.

788
00:46:42,454 --> 00:46:43,719
Terrible!
I know, I know.

789
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:46,755
She's gonna think that she
can do whatever she wants.

790
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:48,490
I know.

791
00:46:50,694 --> 00:46:54,629
All right, you will see Lucy in the morning.
We're going home.

792
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:56,030
No, I'm not! Stop!

793
00:46:56,032 --> 00:46:57,664
What is wrong with you?

794
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:00,299
What's wrong with you?

795
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:03,167
Don't talk back!
Don't talk fresh!

796
00:47:03,169 --> 00:47:04,568
You promised!
You promised!

797
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,269
You're on
a time-out!

798
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:07,670
What's that?

799
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:12,207
That is where you stay by
yourself and you be quiet!

800
00:47:14,244 --> 00:47:16,510
Could I please just say one word?

801
00:47:16,512 --> 00:47:17,611
No!

802
00:47:17,613 --> 00:47:18,945
One word!

803
00:47:18,947 --> 00:47:20,313
No!

804
00:47:28,456 --> 00:47:31,223
Goodbye, bunny rabbits.

805
00:47:32,793 --> 00:47:34,926
Goodbye, Georgia.

806
00:47:35,295 --> 00:47:38,195
Goodbye, new training wheels.

807
00:47:38,197 --> 00:47:40,730
Bye-bye,
stuffed animals,

808
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,399
especially Doris.

809
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:46,167
Goodbye, Ronnie's puppy.

810
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:48,001
And...

811
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:53,239
What's the matter?
Are you sad?

812
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:55,908
I don't like that word, please.

813
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,743
Which? Which word?

814
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:00,345
Sad.

815
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:05,750
You know, you're in here

816
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:08,552
because you made a choice
by the way that you acted.

817
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:11,521
So if you don't like the
way that this worked out,

818
00:48:11,523 --> 00:48:14,957
then next time that
you have to make a choice,

819
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:17,392
you just think of this.

820
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,760
I don't understand.

821
00:48:19,762 --> 00:48:23,130
Well, I don't either.
I just read it.

822
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:27,467
All right.

823
00:48:29,204 --> 00:48:31,604
Okay.

824
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:37,609
I don't feel like being
alone right now, do you?

825
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:41,545
No.

826
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,947
Okay, let's do
this time-out

827
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:46,748
together.

828
00:48:48,752 --> 00:48:50,518
Okay.
Okay.

829
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:59,626
What is the sin that we've committed
that we have to eat take-out Thai

830
00:48:59,628 --> 00:49:00,460
every day of our lives?

831
00:49:00,462 --> 00:49:03,629
Did you bring chopsticks?

832
00:49:03,797 --> 00:49:04,695
Here.

833
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:05,929
Chopstick.

834
00:49:05,931 --> 00:49:08,164
Popcorn Pictures.

835
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:10,299
Hey.
Hey.

836
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:12,367
How you doing?
Good.

837
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,368
You want some?
It's perk.

838
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,202
No, thanks.
I brought my own.

839
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,837
I'm almost finished with this,
if you'd just give me a minute.

840
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:20,574
No, no, that's fine.
I'll sit over there.

841
00:49:21,443 --> 00:49:23,075
You want a script to read?

842
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:23,708
No. No, thank you.

843
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,577
Will somebody take a minute
to look over my casting list

844
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:28,612
before Burke gets here?

845
00:49:31,483 --> 00:49:35,418
Popcorn Pictures.
Please hold.

846
00:49:43,493 --> 00:49:44,492
This list isn't so great, Millie.

847
00:49:44,494 --> 00:49:48,162
Well, I wanted to put people on
there we had a shot at getting.

848
00:49:48,164 --> 00:49:50,397
"Jeff Daniels, Ed Harris,

849
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:52,031
"F. Murray Abraham,
Willem Dafoe,

850
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:55,034
"Tommy Lee Jones, John
Malkovich." For an action lead?

851
00:49:55,036 --> 00:49:56,668
Does Academy Award stuff
mean anything here?

852
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,704
I mean, could you just take my list
and go down it one name at a time

853
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:02,206
instead of this general lack of...
Okay, okay.

854
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,841
Let's play State the Obvious.

855
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:06,676
"Ed Harris."
Losing his hair.

856
00:50:06,678 --> 00:50:11,047
"F. Murray Abraham." Has a nose
as long as an Aspen ski-line.

857
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,915
"Jeff Daniels."
Beanpole.

858
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:17,286
"Bob Hoskins." Looks fur-bearing
when he takes off his shirt.

859
00:50:17,288 --> 00:50:20,422
"Tommy Lee Jones."
Very unfortunate skin.

860
00:50:20,424 --> 00:50:23,691
"John Malkovich"? What
dermatologist gave you this list?

861
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:25,359
Hey.

862
00:50:26,228 --> 00:50:29,696
"James Spader."
Vanilla, vanilla, vanilla.

863
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:32,732
"Christopher Walken."
Weird hair.

864
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:34,066
Where do you put the garbage?

865
00:50:34,068 --> 00:50:35,734
"Willem Dafoe."
Teeth.

866
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:38,336
- "Gary Busey."
- Teeth again.

867
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:39,036
Teeth again.

868
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:42,172
"James Woods."
Small head, pointy face.

869
00:50:42,174 --> 00:50:44,707
"Raul Julia."
Bug eyes.

870
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:45,808
"John Goodman."

871
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,476
Bombed on the big screen.

872
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,377
Bombed on the big screen.

873
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:52,713
Where do they find these people?

874
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:55,282
Did you say something?

875
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:59,520
Yes. Where did
they find you?

876
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:00,486
What?

877
00:51:00,488 --> 00:51:03,922
Yes. You know,
I always thought

878
00:51:03,924 --> 00:51:07,759
that people in your job had
to have some qualifications.

879
00:51:07,761 --> 00:51:10,895
I mean, forget common
decency for a minute. Okay?

880
00:51:10,897 --> 00:51:14,098
You don't even know that these
people that you're talking about

881
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,699
are some of the best guys alive!

882
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:17,133
I don't think all the
yelling is necessary.

883
00:51:17,135 --> 00:51:21,504
Yes, it is. And I'm not talking
to you, and I don't like you.

884
00:51:24,575 --> 00:51:26,241
You know, I...

885
00:51:26,243 --> 00:51:29,677
You know, I always had
a firm idea about acting.

886
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:30,844
That you just shut up and act.

887
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:37,383
And I always believed that you forget about
all the crap that you can't control.

888
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,550
But, you know...

889
00:51:38,552 --> 00:51:39,484
My God, man!

890
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:42,620
I mean, where did they find you?

891
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:43,019
I...

892
00:51:43,021 --> 00:51:46,989
Okay, okay, okay. All
right, you know, I know.

893
00:51:46,991 --> 00:51:48,890
It's a business.

894
00:51:49,058 --> 00:51:52,559
And nobody ever put
a gun to anybody's head.

895
00:51:52,561 --> 00:51:54,961
You know, nobody put it
up there and said,

896
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:56,729
"Okay now,
you've gotta act."

897
00:51:56,731 --> 00:52:01,100
But, you know, doesn't somebody in
your job still have to have at least

898
00:52:01,102 --> 00:52:08,373
some dull feeling of respect for people
who really do know what they're doing?

899
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:12,376
I mean, don't you have
to know something besides

900
00:52:12,378 --> 00:52:16,813
how to pose for this picture
of you that nobody's snapping?

901
00:52:16,815 --> 00:52:18,381
Hey, why don't you just
mind your own business?

902
00:52:18,383 --> 00:52:22,952
Well, because, man, because
you're minding my business!

903
00:52:22,954 --> 00:52:25,087
And that's the problem!

904
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:34,795
The hell with this.
I'm really sorry.

905
00:52:34,797 --> 00:52:38,799
No, no, no.
Take my seat, please.

906
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,735
Don't hit me.

907
00:52:42,737 --> 00:52:45,037
I'm not gonna hit you.

908
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:47,272
It's not your fault,

909
00:52:48,074 --> 00:52:49,540
this stupidity of yours.

910
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:54,011
You're just a scared little shit
that gets to say he's making movies.

911
00:52:54,013 --> 00:52:57,414
And the only thing that
they ever taught you

912
00:52:57,416 --> 00:53:01,184
is that what you really
like doesn't matter.

913
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:05,254
I didn't mean you.

914
00:53:05,256 --> 00:53:08,457
If you didn't, you sure should have.

915
00:53:08,826 --> 00:53:10,392
I'll take that.

916
00:53:10,394 --> 00:53:12,260
Thank you.

917
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:23,837
What? What is it?

918
00:53:24,372 --> 00:53:26,071
I've been...

919
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,309
I just got this feeling,

920
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:33,978
seeing myself talking to you and...

921
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,581
Like this is the most
important moment of...

922
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:38,815
Ever.

923
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:42,251
Okay, good.
What is it?

924
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,588
I've been watching
this company make movies

925
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,857
that cost tens of millions of dollars.

926
00:53:50,925 --> 00:53:52,624
And all the while, I have known

927
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:55,360
about this wonderful script,
which we somehow own,

928
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:56,994
and we could make for about 14 million.

929
00:53:56,996 --> 00:54:00,197
Three million if you can live
without stars or a name director.

930
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:01,865
That's it?
Send me the coverage.

931
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:05,768
I have sent you coverage
on it nine times!

932
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:08,870
I'm sorry.

933
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:14,708
I swear to you, Burke, it'll work.

934
00:54:16,078 --> 00:54:18,812
You have never heard me say that.

935
00:54:18,814 --> 00:54:19,946
Really?

936
00:54:19,948 --> 00:54:21,147
How about last night's preview?

937
00:54:21,149 --> 00:54:25,050
I don't know anything
about action-adventure!

938
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:31,022
I have no idea where that came from.

939
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:41,698
Look, I know that everyone thinks that
I don't have any commercial sense

940
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,701
because of what I said at that
<i>Gremlins</i> preview and all.

941
00:54:44,703 --> 00:54:48,638
And you think that I can't
put myself on the line.

942
00:54:49,941 --> 00:54:52,641
Well, if this picture doesn't work,

943
00:54:52,943 --> 00:54:54,208
fire me.

944
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,711
Have me killed if it
doesn't get good reviews.

945
00:54:57,713 --> 00:55:02,916
If this picture doesn't get a 70% definite
recommend from women 49 and under,

946
00:55:02,918 --> 00:55:06,352
I promise to be your sex slave
until they drop ticket prices

947
00:55:06,354 --> 00:55:09,421
back to five bucks and start
enforcing the "R" rating.

948
00:55:09,423 --> 00:55:11,189
You're selling very excellent.

949
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:13,424
Very excellent presentation.

950
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:16,727
You

951
00:55:17,296 --> 00:55:19,863
gotta do this for me.

952
00:55:20,165 --> 00:55:23,499
I think this movie could save me.

953
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:25,800
Please.

954
00:55:27,503 --> 00:55:29,469
What's the script?

955
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:33,706
<i>Mr. Deeds Goes To Town.</i>

956
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:35,274
A remake.

957
00:55:35,776 --> 00:55:37,475
Yeah.

958
00:55:38,344 --> 00:55:41,578
I would like you to look at this.

959
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,046
You're being poopie.

960
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,180
Jeannie!

961
00:55:44,182 --> 00:55:45,714
Thanks, Lucy.

962
00:55:45,716 --> 00:55:47,482
Say goodbye.

963
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:49,082
Say goodbye.

964
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:51,150
Jeannie, say goodbye.

965
00:55:51,152 --> 00:55:54,286
Why wouldn't you look at
the way I dressed Ricky?

966
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:55,353
I had a real rough day.

967
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:59,557
So I don't want to talk about it.
Just let it sit there.

968
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:05,362
<i>You have no messages at this time.</i>

969
00:56:05,364 --> 00:56:08,164
What was so rough?

970
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:10,032
Tell me.

971
00:56:11,235 --> 00:56:12,934
Compromise.

972
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,338
Are you sad?

973
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:19,639
Yes.

974
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:22,807
Now I really need to be quiet.

975
00:56:29,382 --> 00:56:30,814
You!

976
00:56:30,816 --> 00:56:34,751
I know what will cheer you up.

977
00:57:03,381 --> 00:57:05,381
¶ You are the best.

978
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:07,416
¶ You can do everything.

979
00:57:07,418 --> 00:57:11,420
¶ You can be everything you want to be.

980
00:57:12,122 --> 00:57:14,255
¶ You are a smile.

981
00:57:14,257 --> 00:57:16,190
¶ You are a rainbow.

982
00:57:16,192 --> 00:57:20,561
¶ You were created so perfectly.

983
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:23,062
¶ Sometimes we laugh.

984
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,596
¶ Sometimes we cry.

985
00:57:24,598 --> 00:57:29,400
¶ Sometimes we hurt inside
and don't understand why.

986
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:31,769
¶ We're only human.

987
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:33,170
¶ We make mistakes.

988
00:57:33,172 --> 00:57:39,609
¶ Sometimes it seems like only
other people get the breaks.

989
00:57:40,878 --> 00:57:42,277
¶ Hey.

990
00:57:42,612 --> 00:57:44,645
¶ You're the best.

991
00:57:44,747 --> 00:57:46,780
¶ Don't you worry.

992
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:49,549
¶ You're not your friends,
you're not your mother.

993
00:57:49,551 --> 00:57:52,118
¶ You're not your father
and you're not your brother.

994
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,286
¶ Don't let sadness get you down, just...

995
00:57:54,288 --> 00:57:56,288
<i>¶ ...and that's the best
anybody can do</i>

996
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:59,357
<i>¶ Don't let sadness get you down ¶</i>

997
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,059
I'm stupid!

998
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,693
I can't even remember the words!

999
00:58:03,695 --> 00:58:08,431
No, no, no, listen to me.
You're not stupid.

1000
00:58:09,534 --> 00:58:10,900
I am stupid.

1001
00:58:10,902 --> 00:58:14,770
I can't even remember
the words to some baby song.

1002
00:58:19,075 --> 00:58:19,606
Hello?

1003
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:23,676
Matt, they may let me finally
make a movie I love!

1004
00:58:24,478 --> 00:58:26,544
And I think you're perfect for it, too.

1005
00:58:26,546 --> 00:58:28,445
Who is it?

1006
00:58:28,447 --> 00:58:30,313
Me? Well...

1007
00:58:30,315 --> 00:58:30,680
Is it Lucy?

1008
00:58:30,682 --> 00:58:33,382
Well, this is great. Okay. I'll come
right over and pick up the script.

1009
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,784
<i>No, I'll get your address from Claire.</i>

1010
00:58:35,786 --> 00:58:36,684
Okay.

1011
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:37,851
Can I just talk?

1012
00:58:37,853 --> 00:58:39,786
If you like, bring it right on over.

1013
00:58:39,788 --> 00:58:41,220
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

1014
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:43,388
Let me talk!

1015
00:58:50,263 --> 00:58:52,930
We might make it yet, kid.

1016
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:09,812
I let you wear your cape and crown.
Now, come on!

1017
00:59:09,814 --> 00:59:12,614
Why can't I stay just a little while?

1018
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:15,516
Because this is a very
special friend of Daddy's

1019
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:17,117
and I need the privacy.

1020
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,419
Now, be fair!

1021
00:59:19,688 --> 00:59:21,921
I let you wear that dress!

1022
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,225
Hi, come in.

1023
00:59:27,227 --> 00:59:29,994
I want you to meet my
daughter, Queen Elizabeth.

1024
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:30,728
Boo!

1025
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:31,995
Jeannie, this is Cathy.

1026
00:59:31,997 --> 00:59:34,230
Hi. What a
pretty dress.

1027
00:59:34,232 --> 00:59:35,464
Thank you.

1028
00:59:35,466 --> 00:59:37,999
Thank you.
That's nice.

1029
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:40,368
Are you going to a party?

1030
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:45,939
Hey, Dad, am I going to a party?

1031
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:48,808
No, you're going next door.

1032
00:59:50,278 --> 00:59:52,011
Jeannie!

1033
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:58,850
Do you remember our compromise?

1034
00:59:58,852 --> 01:00:02,954
You're gonna go next door to
Lucy's, and you're gonna play.

1035
01:00:02,956 --> 01:00:05,589
And you're gonna show them this dress.

1036
01:00:05,591 --> 01:00:07,958
And then I'm gonna come
by and get you later,

1037
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,363
and we'll go out and we'll buy you
anything you want for under $17.

1038
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:22,938
I remember.

1039
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:42,423
Goodbye.

1040
01:00:42,558 --> 01:00:44,925
I love you very much.

1041
01:00:46,495 --> 01:00:49,429
Well, thank you!

1042
01:00:49,864 --> 01:00:53,498
Say thank you.
Say thanks!

1043
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,932
Thanks.

1044
01:00:55,601 --> 01:00:58,168
Now say,
"Thanks, Jeannie."

1045
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,637
Thanks, Jeannie.

1046
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:06,941
Go on inside.

1047
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:15,349
What a little winner?

1048
01:01:19,088 --> 01:01:20,587
Thanks.

1049
01:01:21,222 --> 01:01:24,056
This is my favorite project.

1050
01:01:24,058 --> 01:01:24,322
Good.

1051
01:01:24,324 --> 01:01:26,324
And it looks like we're
going ahead with it.

1052
01:01:26,326 --> 01:01:30,695
<i>Mr. Deeds Goes To Town,</i> It's a remake.

1053
01:01:30,697 --> 01:01:32,697
Well, come on.
Well, it's original.

1054
01:01:32,699 --> 01:01:34,632
This is a wonderful rewrite.

1055
01:01:34,634 --> 01:01:36,667
It's funnier.

1056
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,502
And there's a part in it for...

1057
01:01:39,504 --> 01:01:42,137
Yes. Burke says I can
test whoever I want.

1058
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:44,672
He wasn't even surprised
when I mentioned you.

1059
01:01:44,674 --> 01:01:46,206
So if you could read this now,

1060
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:49,108
and if you like it,
we can make a test deal.

1061
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:51,710
Okay. Which part?

1062
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:54,579
Longfellow Deeds.

1063
01:01:58,651 --> 01:01:59,883
Mr. Deeds?

1064
01:01:59,885 --> 01:02:02,318
Who goes to town, yeah!

1065
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:06,555
I just can't wait to hear
what you think of it.

1066
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:09,590
I mean, who are we kidding?

1067
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:11,592
I'm even having trouble
getting short parts.

1068
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:15,095
I'm gonna say that I love this no
matter what you've done to it.

1069
01:02:15,097 --> 01:02:17,964
Stop being so creepy honest.

1070
01:02:20,234 --> 01:02:23,735
I really have an instinct

1071
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,036
about you for this.

1072
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:29,471
I'm going home.

1073
01:02:34,811 --> 01:02:38,445
Call me when you finish reading it, or...

1074
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,614
You know, just come on over.

1075
01:02:44,018 --> 01:02:45,550
For luck.

1076
01:02:45,552 --> 01:02:47,018
For luck.

1077
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:50,811
I mistimed it.

1078
01:03:50,813 --> 01:03:54,314
I wanted you to catch me fully frontal.

1079
01:04:00,688 --> 01:04:03,522
So, the script?

1080
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:04,990
It's really good.

1081
01:04:04,992 --> 01:04:08,059
I get a little nervous thinking
about the opportunity.

1082
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:10,027
Well, I want to hear everything.

1083
01:04:10,029 --> 01:04:13,230
Should we go through it page by page?

1084
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:15,965
Okay.

1085
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,406
If it's okay...

1086
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:27,607
I kind of...

1087
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:30,810
I kind of work on
these things in private.

1088
01:04:31,045 --> 01:04:34,379
It's just that it's
a little better for me

1089
01:04:34,381 --> 01:04:37,248
if I don't...
If I don't...

1090
01:04:37,783 --> 01:04:39,282
Okay.

1091
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,996
No, it's okay.
It won't kill me.

1092
01:04:53,998 --> 01:04:57,666
No, no, really, please.
I do understand.

1093
01:04:57,668 --> 01:04:59,200
I'm just not that fragile.

1094
01:04:59,202 --> 01:05:01,268
No, no, no, no.

1095
01:05:06,908 --> 01:05:09,642
Let's go.
Yeah.

1096
01:05:24,857 --> 01:05:27,257
You look so serious.

1097
01:05:30,395 --> 01:05:32,428
I am so serious.

1098
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:37,132
Good.

1099
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:48,109
I get a lot of calls.
I'm a phone person.

1100
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:54,748
<i>Cathy, you were supposed to be
here an hour and five minutes ago.</i>

1101
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,651
<i>Maybe you think a one-month
anniversary is silly. Goodbye.</i>

1102
01:05:58,653 --> 01:06:02,621
<i>You know something? Maybe we
should start seeing other people.</i>

1103
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,261
<i>Hey, Cath, pick up, pick up, pick up.
Great news.</i>

1104
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:13,362
<i>Oliver Stone's movie just fell apart.</i>

1105
01:06:13,364 --> 01:06:17,566
<i>He's going crazy. Perfect
timing to send him</i> Deeds. <i>Bye.</i>

1106
01:06:17,568 --> 01:06:19,968
<i>Guess who's gay?
Call me, bye.</i>

1107
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:23,371
Is this the kind of crap
you listen to all day?

1108
01:06:23,373 --> 01:06:25,473
Please, we're making love here.

1109
01:06:32,014 --> 01:06:33,713
<i>Daddy?</i>

1110
01:06:33,715 --> 01:06:38,484
<i>Daddy? Where is he?
Lucy, you dialed wrong.</i>

1111
01:06:38,853 --> 01:06:41,720
<i>Matt, you left this number.
Are you there?</i>

1112
01:06:41,722 --> 01:06:43,054
<i>Jeannie misses you and is upset</i>

1113
01:06:43,056 --> 01:06:44,688
<i>because you're not here to
watch TV like you promised.</i>

1114
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:49,159
<i>I think all daddies should keep
their promises, Matt. Bye.</i>

1115
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:55,630
I'm sorry.

1116
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:58,732
It's all right.

1117
01:07:04,773 --> 01:07:07,740
Is there a name for what we just had?

1118
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:12,744
No.

1119
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:22,353
Just tell me what made you rush
over and pick me up at my office

1120
01:07:22,355 --> 01:07:24,722
and bring me here at 6:00.

1121
01:07:26,692 --> 01:07:30,160
We seem to have this unspoken agreement,

1122
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:33,329
not to talk about why we're
together when we're together.

1123
01:07:33,331 --> 01:07:38,567
And I don't think it's good to let
that become a pattern for us.

1124
01:07:43,874 --> 01:07:45,406
Come on.

1125
01:07:46,575 --> 01:07:49,509
Why did I rush over to see you?

1126
01:07:49,511 --> 01:07:51,777
Well...

1127
01:07:54,047 --> 01:07:57,415
Well, I had the urge to

1128
01:08:00,153 --> 01:08:02,019
be with someone.

1129
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,387
You were the closest.

1130
01:08:07,658 --> 01:08:09,324
What's wrong?

1131
01:08:09,326 --> 01:08:13,761
You're not at all aware that
you've just said something

1132
01:08:14,997 --> 01:08:16,830
unattractive?

1133
01:08:16,932 --> 01:08:18,831
I'm sorry if it came out the wrong way.

1134
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,799
I'm not looking for an apology.

1135
01:08:20,801 --> 01:08:21,132
"Closest."

1136
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:23,701
One of the things I'm not
great at is expressing...

1137
01:08:23,703 --> 01:08:25,135
Let's not make this
about your shortcomings.

1138
01:08:25,137 --> 01:08:29,639
I'm sure you've had enough of those
conversations to last you a lifetime.

1139
01:08:29,641 --> 01:08:32,608
What I'm trying...
No, I haven't.

1140
01:08:32,743 --> 01:08:33,708
No, you haven't what?

1141
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:37,344
Had conversations about shortcomings.

1142
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,879
No woman has ever told you

1143
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:43,816
that you have an almost
barbaric insensitivity?

1144
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:47,086
That you seem to have lapsed
into some final cynicism

1145
01:08:47,088 --> 01:08:51,223
where you actually believe that not only
does everyone think the way you do,

1146
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:54,893
but only you have
the courage to express it.

1147
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,599
That you seem horribly certain

1148
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:07,137
that everyone else is sort of
pretending when they talk about love.

1149
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:11,875
Or seem to care for anything
outside their own anus.

1150
01:09:12,878 --> 01:09:16,079
No one's ever said that
sort of thing to you?

1151
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:17,313
Yeah, I heard that.

1152
01:09:17,315 --> 01:09:21,317
But I didn't know that's what
you meant by shortcomings.

1153
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:25,521
If you think this way,
what are you doing here?

1154
01:09:26,857 --> 01:09:28,957
I'm here for the same reason

1155
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:34,128
that 86% of older women
love <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

1156
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:37,464
I would like to believe
that underneath the creature,

1157
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:41,167
there's a sweet, caring guy.

1158
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:44,603
I sure hope you're wrong.

1159
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,072
No.
I'm kidding.

1160
01:09:48,074 --> 01:09:50,340
Come on.
I have to pick up Leslie.

1161
01:09:50,342 --> 01:09:52,475
Come on.
No.

1162
01:09:52,477 --> 01:09:54,009
Come on!

1163
01:09:54,077 --> 01:09:56,510
Stop making me feel bad.

1164
01:09:56,979 --> 01:09:58,511
Okay.

1165
01:10:17,263 --> 01:10:19,263
You know, this is awkward,
me driving you around

1166
01:10:19,265 --> 01:10:22,399
and then going in to
test for you tomorrow.

1167
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:23,133
Not really.

1168
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,703
Well, I can't drive you to work
tomorrow and then go right in and test.

1169
01:10:26,705 --> 01:10:28,538
It's okay.
I'm coming in late tomorrow.

1170
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,907
I'll get one of the kids to drive me.

1171
01:10:31,075 --> 01:10:32,774
Thank you.

1172
01:10:33,777 --> 01:10:36,577
And, look, if I get
the lead in this movie?

1173
01:10:36,579 --> 01:10:37,311
Yeah?

1174
01:10:37,313 --> 01:10:41,715
You have to go back to sitting up
front with me when I drive you.

1175
01:10:51,692 --> 01:10:53,692
Very good!

1176
01:11:03,904 --> 01:11:04,869
Hey, Kenny?
Yeah, baby.

1177
01:11:04,871 --> 01:11:06,604
Did you hear I was in
the hospital last week?

1178
01:11:06,606 --> 01:11:08,906
Matt, should we run lines? Yeah.

1179
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:09,940
For food poisoning.

1180
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:10,874
Food poisoning?

1181
01:11:10,876 --> 01:11:13,343
I thought that I would die.
"What's wrong?"

1182
01:11:13,345 --> 01:11:14,610
Guys, they're ready for you.

1183
01:11:14,612 --> 01:11:16,712
Okay, so, Matt, they're ready.
I went to the hospital.

1184
01:11:16,714 --> 01:11:18,547
Lily, ready for you.

1185
01:11:22,018 --> 01:11:22,883
Is he fabulous?

1186
01:11:22,885 --> 01:11:24,851
Do you always wear your hair...

1187
01:11:24,853 --> 01:11:26,319
Is he out there?
Yeah.

1188
01:11:26,321 --> 01:11:28,721
They couldn't pump my stomach.

1189
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:31,089
You can't keep...
Underneath?

1190
01:11:31,091 --> 01:11:32,690
You want more powder under there?

1191
01:11:32,692 --> 01:11:35,359
If that will be good for
you, it's good for me.

1192
01:11:35,361 --> 01:11:37,728
How's that? Good?

1193
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:39,529
Yeah.
Yes.

1194
01:11:39,531 --> 01:11:40,496
Where's Jeannie?

1195
01:11:40,498 --> 01:11:43,732
Jeannie's fine. I'll
never eat there again.

1196
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:44,799
Well, I hope not.

1197
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,634
They're all ready for you. All right.

1198
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,769
How many men are testing today?

1199
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,670
You're the only one.

1200
01:11:54,242 --> 01:11:55,774
Well, well, all right.

1201
01:11:55,776 --> 01:11:57,542
In that case, tell them I need more time.

1202
01:11:57,544 --> 01:11:58,376
No, actually, I'm finished.

1203
01:11:58,378 --> 01:12:03,214
No, I mean for me. I want
to focus a little more.

1204
01:12:03,282 --> 01:12:04,381
Okay.

1205
01:12:04,383 --> 01:12:05,949
Matt?
Yeah?

1206
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:10,787
The thing they're
looking for most is sexy.

1207
01:12:13,391 --> 01:12:16,658
You know who she was involved
with for a minute or so?

1208
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:16,924
Who?

1209
01:12:16,926 --> 01:12:19,660
Hey, hey, hey, you guys, you know...

1210
01:12:19,662 --> 01:12:21,495
I really need to be alone right now.

1211
01:12:21,497 --> 01:12:24,731
'Cause I need to focus a
little, so if you don't mind.

1212
01:12:24,733 --> 01:12:25,631
Is that all right?

1213
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:28,400
- That's fine.
- Thank you.

1214
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:30,268
Focus a little.

1215
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:30,868
Ken.

1216
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:34,438
Have you seen the pastry truck?
Has that guy been by?

1217
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,639
No, he's always late.

1218
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:37,874
Let's focus on a Danish.

1219
01:12:41,112 --> 01:12:45,214
I can't remember. You're too pretty.
You're...

1220
01:12:45,216 --> 01:12:47,382
I can't remember.
You're too pretty.

1221
01:12:47,384 --> 01:12:50,818
I told them I could be a chairman.

1222
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:53,787
No, that's a lie.
I tell them...

1223
01:12:53,789 --> 01:12:55,688
I told them I'd tell her the truth.

1224
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:58,457
I told her I'd keep on being chairman.

1225
01:12:58,459 --> 01:13:03,061
I told them I'd keep on being chairman.

1226
01:13:03,063 --> 01:13:04,162
I told them I'd keep...

1227
01:13:04,164 --> 01:13:06,697
I told them that I'd
keep on being chairman.

1228
01:13:06,699 --> 01:13:08,498
You know, you know...

1229
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:12,301
You know I am chairman.

1230
01:13:12,569 --> 01:13:15,603
Sexy, sexy.

1231
01:13:15,605 --> 01:13:20,541
Sexy. I am chairman,
you know.

1232
01:13:44,966 --> 01:13:47,399
- I'm so nervous, Mom.
- It'll be okay.

1233
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:49,601
I forgot everything.

1234
01:13:51,338 --> 01:13:53,705
Get out of my way!

1235
01:13:53,773 --> 01:13:55,839
Don't say it like that!

1236
01:13:55,841 --> 01:13:57,874
How should I say it?

1237
01:13:58,243 --> 01:14:00,376
Get out of my way.

1238
01:14:00,378 --> 01:14:03,445
Or, get out of my way!

1239
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:06,514
Or, get out of my way.

1240
01:14:08,784 --> 01:14:10,183
Wow.

1241
01:14:16,524 --> 01:14:18,891
No, I'm doing my name.

1242
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,392
J-E...

1243
01:14:21,394 --> 01:14:23,193
Hey, hey!

1244
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:25,094
Hey, it felt great!

1245
01:14:25,096 --> 01:14:26,395
Tell me!

1246
01:14:26,397 --> 01:14:27,662
Great!

1247
01:14:27,664 --> 01:14:29,096
Let him finish. God!

1248
01:14:29,098 --> 01:14:30,130
I want to tell him!

1249
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,298
If you wait one minute, I'll let you.

1250
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,099
¶ I can't wait to tell him,
I can't wait to tell him.

1251
01:14:34,101 --> 01:14:38,103
Anyway, the girl I did it with?
She's really good!

1252
01:14:38,105 --> 01:14:41,372
And the director, the crew,
we all felt we nailed it.

1253
01:14:41,374 --> 01:14:44,308
¶ I can't wait to tell him,
I can't wait to tell him.

1254
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:47,311
¶ I can't wait to tell him,
I can't wait to tell him ¶

1255
01:14:47,313 --> 01:14:47,711
Now?

1256
01:14:47,713 --> 01:14:50,013
Wait'll you hear this one.

1257
01:14:50,015 --> 01:14:50,847
Yeah.

1258
01:14:50,849 --> 01:14:51,814
Who's next?

1259
01:14:51,816 --> 01:14:54,116
Tell them you liked the script.

1260
01:14:54,818 --> 01:14:55,383
Excuse me.

1261
01:14:55,385 --> 01:14:58,786
Just be yourself,
honey, but remember to smile.

1262
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:05,392
Some lady asked me to go in a
room and you know make-believe,

1263
01:15:05,394 --> 01:15:08,094
and say stuff like
we were playing a game,

1264
01:15:08,096 --> 01:15:08,961
and everybody
went "Yeah!"

1265
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:13,065
And they said they wanted
me to be on television!

1266
01:15:13,067 --> 01:15:15,067
¶ And give me money.

1267
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:17,235
¶ And have a teacher there.

1268
01:15:17,237 --> 01:15:18,569
¶ And a person to braid my hair.

1269
01:15:18,571 --> 01:15:22,739
¶ And color my face and give me clothes ¶

1270
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:26,275
They said that they
want you on television?

1271
01:15:26,277 --> 01:15:27,709
Yeah.

1272
01:15:27,711 --> 01:15:28,443
Come here.

1273
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:32,313
Just sit right here for one second, okay?

1274
01:15:32,315 --> 01:15:34,281
¶ And give me money.

1275
01:15:34,283 --> 01:15:36,549
¶ And have a teacher there.

1276
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:37,883
Excuse me.

1277
01:15:37,885 --> 01:15:40,252
She auditioned for a TV show?

1278
01:15:40,254 --> 01:15:41,419
Yeah.

1279
01:15:41,421 --> 01:15:42,119
Come here.

1280
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,087
¶ And give me money.

1281
01:15:44,089 --> 01:15:45,321
¶ And have a teacher there.

1282
01:15:45,323 --> 01:15:48,757
¶ And a person to braid my hair and
color my face and give me... ¶

1283
01:15:48,759 --> 01:15:53,661
Do you actually think you can have my kid
audition for a show without asking me?

1284
01:15:53,663 --> 01:15:54,061
I didn't!

1285
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:58,231
She went for water, and by the time she
got back, they had offered her the part.

1286
01:15:58,233 --> 01:16:00,866
Blame Burke.
He was there.

1287
01:16:07,341 --> 01:16:09,474
What's the part, anyway?

1288
01:16:10,477 --> 01:16:11,008
It's...

1289
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:16,513
A white kid in a multiracial foster home
with all these kids of varying ages.

1290
01:16:16,515 --> 01:16:18,548
It's not a bad show.

1291
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:20,549
I can't wait to see the test.

1292
01:16:20,551 --> 01:16:22,050
How did they test her so fast?

1293
01:16:22,052 --> 01:16:26,721
No, they offered it to her off the reading.
I meant your test.

1294
01:16:32,728 --> 01:16:35,428
Offered off the reading.

1295
01:16:42,036 --> 01:16:43,769
Child actor.

1296
01:16:45,672 --> 01:16:49,640
Just what any kid with problems
needs to straighten out.

1297
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:52,008
A series of her own.

1298
01:16:59,684 --> 01:17:02,551
You'll let me know as
soon as they see my test?

1299
01:17:02,553 --> 01:17:04,019
Right away.

1300
01:17:04,021 --> 01:17:06,154
You've got my vote.

1301
01:17:10,393 --> 01:17:15,229
- I'm not changing my mind.
- I've thought about this.

1302
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:17,330
I'm doing it.

1303
01:17:22,236 --> 01:17:24,236
Back up a bit.

1304
01:17:31,812 --> 01:17:34,979
Do I have to learn to read
to be on television?

1305
01:17:34,981 --> 01:17:38,649
You have to learn to listen to me.

1306
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:42,985
I'm doing it.

1307
01:17:42,987 --> 01:17:44,886
Not if I don't let you.

1308
01:17:45,688 --> 01:17:47,521
That's the law.

1309
01:17:48,557 --> 01:17:50,490
Police law.

1310
01:17:56,164 --> 01:17:57,863
All right, just listen to me.

1311
01:17:57,865 --> 01:17:59,564
I don't like listening to you!

1312
01:17:59,566 --> 01:18:02,900
You talk too much!
Why? Why do you?

1313
01:18:02,902 --> 01:18:04,768
Because I know about this.

1314
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:07,203
I have worked with kid actors,

1315
01:18:07,205 --> 01:18:09,738
and they don't have that much fun.

1316
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:11,606
You know, they're inside all day.

1317
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:14,075
They don't get to go to regular schools.

1318
01:18:14,077 --> 01:18:19,180
And they don't play with regular
friends like Ricky and Essa.

1319
01:18:19,615 --> 01:18:20,113
And their parents.

1320
01:18:20,115 --> 01:18:25,118
Do you think that I am going to be one
of those parents that sits around

1321
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,519
in one of those little rooms...

1322
01:18:26,521 --> 01:18:28,087
You're cuckoo anyway!

1323
01:18:28,089 --> 01:18:30,189
I won't do it!
And I don't care!

1324
01:18:30,191 --> 01:18:35,027
Because I'd be stupid at it anyway!

1325
01:18:41,435 --> 01:18:43,435
Pick it up, Jeannie.

1326
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:46,537
We don't throw things here.

1327
01:18:55,848 --> 01:18:58,515
Take it out of the trash.

1328
01:19:02,754 --> 01:19:05,354
Take it out of the trash.

1329
01:19:10,994 --> 01:19:12,626
Come here.

1330
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,770
Let's work on it.

1331
01:19:27,542 --> 01:19:30,409
So when you play a part,
the character is you.

1332
01:19:30,411 --> 01:19:33,545
So anything you think
or feel will be right.

1333
01:19:33,547 --> 01:19:36,147
You can't make a mistake.

1334
01:19:36,682 --> 01:19:42,385
And once you get that, then you can relax.
You really feel...

1335
01:19:43,421 --> 01:19:46,722
I'm really thrilling you
with this, aren't I?

1336
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:50,925
Come on.
Let's get off the bed.

1337
01:19:50,927 --> 01:19:53,861
Let's do the scene where
they say "I love you."

1338
01:19:54,663 --> 01:19:56,696
Get off the bed.
Come on over here.

1339
01:19:56,698 --> 01:19:59,765
I don't want to do
that "I love you" again.

1340
01:19:59,767 --> 01:20:02,768
Why don't you do that with poopie Cathy?

1341
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:06,238
Look.
My hair's so pretty.

1342
01:20:08,008 --> 01:20:10,308
My hair's so pretty.

1343
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,343
Look, I'm pretty.

1344
01:20:12,345 --> 01:20:13,544
Barbie.

1345
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:19,982
<i>Come on, Deeds.
Tell me about the meeting.</i>

1346
01:20:20,484 --> 01:20:23,785
<i>I can't remember.
You're too pretty.</i>

1347
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,419
<i>All right, darling.</i>

1348
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:29,689
<i>I told them that I would
keep on being chairman.</i>

1349
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:31,691
<i>I know.</i>

1350
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:35,761
<i>Do you always wear your
hair back like this?</i>

1351
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,207
<i>Cut.</i>
He's so good!

1352
01:20:51,076 --> 01:20:51,741
Beautiful!

1353
01:20:51,743 --> 01:20:54,410
<i>Great, very good.</i>

1354
01:20:54,412 --> 01:20:57,413
<i>Gee, are you good.
Thanks.</i>

1355
01:20:57,681 --> 01:21:00,148
Okay, let's have our
creative meeting right here.

1356
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:02,884
Well, I'd sure go to bed with her.
Very fuckable.

1357
01:21:02,886 --> 01:21:04,218
I'd bone her.

1358
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:04,751
What about him?

1359
01:21:04,753 --> 01:21:07,720
I think he's a very good
to excellent actor.

1360
01:21:08,856 --> 01:21:09,921
But there's something...

1361
01:21:09,923 --> 01:21:11,989
You wouldn't go to bed with him.

1362
01:21:11,991 --> 01:21:13,890
Well, six years ago, maybe.

1363
01:21:13,892 --> 01:21:15,625
Everything doesn't boil down to...

1364
01:21:15,627 --> 01:21:18,561
I like that shy thing he was going for.

1365
01:21:18,563 --> 01:21:20,362
He's talented and attractive.

1366
01:21:20,364 --> 01:21:22,564
So you'd go to bed with him?

1367
01:21:22,566 --> 01:21:23,531
He,

1368
01:21:23,533 --> 01:21:27,301
might be a little light in that area.

1369
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:34,474
The man is talented.

1370
01:21:34,476 --> 01:21:38,377
Let me stop you before
you embarrass yourself!

1371
01:21:38,779 --> 01:21:43,214
We all can do our little lectures
about what things boil down to.

1372
01:21:43,216 --> 01:21:45,683
Everybody else here was
professional enough to say,

1373
01:21:45,685 --> 01:21:49,319
"I'd go to bed with him, I
wouldn't go to bed with him."

1374
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,186
You're ducking it.

1375
01:21:50,188 --> 01:21:54,590
So let's cut out the acting stuff
and focus on what's important.

1376
01:21:54,592 --> 01:21:59,728
You know, we do have some kind of
responsibility to the audience.

1377
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:02,097
So, you've just seen
the screen test, okay?

1378
01:22:02,099 --> 01:22:06,968
Your job aside, would you,
yourself, go to bed with him?

1379
01:22:07,837 --> 01:22:09,970
Would you, Cathy?

1380
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,906
I'm being real now.

1381
01:22:23,684 --> 01:22:25,016
No.

1382
01:22:26,519 --> 01:22:29,653
Okay, then we keep looking.

1383
01:22:33,191 --> 01:22:36,158
Well, that's standing up to him.

1384
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:51,973
I'm fine.

1385
01:22:51,975 --> 01:22:54,141
I'm right outside my office.

1386
01:22:55,544 --> 01:22:58,144
Good, give the phone to him.

1387
01:22:58,146 --> 01:22:59,912
Hello, Matt.

1388
01:23:00,581 --> 01:23:02,547
Okay, sure.

1389
01:23:03,716 --> 01:23:05,282
Matt?

1390
01:23:05,951 --> 01:23:07,283
Matt.

1391
01:23:07,952 --> 01:23:08,450
Matt!

1392
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:11,920
Maybe it would be easier
if I just said hi to her?

1393
01:23:11,922 --> 01:23:14,489
Okay, here she is.

1394
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:17,191
Hi.
<i>Hi.</i>

1395
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:20,994
Yeah, it's exciting, isn't it?

1396
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:24,296
No. No, no,
he's right, honey.

1397
01:23:24,298 --> 01:23:27,332
They get somebody to read it to you.

1398
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,734
Can you put your dad on?

1399
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:33,202
Yes. It's important.

1400
01:23:33,204 --> 01:23:36,338
No, put your dad on first.

1401
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,639
Damn it!

1402
01:23:37,641 --> 01:23:38,906
Rude.

1403
01:23:38,908 --> 01:23:40,207
Hello?

1404
01:23:40,275 --> 01:23:43,276
Hi, Matt.

1405
01:23:43,278 --> 01:23:45,478
A few hours ago.

1406
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,179
They all...

1407
01:23:47,181 --> 01:23:50,215
Everyone liked your work, but...

1408
01:23:51,117 --> 01:23:55,719
<i>You know, I think they'll
go for a name or something.</i>

1409
01:24:04,495 --> 01:24:07,195
You know, I...
I could do...

1410
01:24:07,197 --> 01:24:08,529
I can do it with more humor, if...

1411
01:24:08,531 --> 01:24:12,299
<i>No, it's not a matter
of doing it differently.</i>

1412
01:24:12,301 --> 01:24:16,736
<i>They liked what you did a lot, and...</i>

1413
01:24:19,674 --> 01:24:21,573
It's not you.

1414
01:24:22,576 --> 01:24:24,175
It's them.

1415
01:24:24,443 --> 01:24:28,344
<i>I want you to know that I
really hung in there for you.</i>

1416
01:24:28,346 --> 01:24:29,445
<i>Really. I fought hard.</i>

1417
01:24:29,447 --> 01:24:34,316
Well, gee, Cath, I want to thank you
for giving me a shot, you know?

1418
01:24:34,318 --> 01:24:37,118
<i>No, don't thank me.</i>

1419
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:43,457
<i>If you feel like getting
together later, or anytime.</i>

1420
01:24:43,459 --> 01:24:44,758
Yeah.

1421
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,160
Give me a call, okay?

1422
01:24:47,562 --> 01:24:51,196
It sounds like you have
your hands full right now.

1423
01:24:52,232 --> 01:24:53,731
Bye.

1424
01:25:11,851 --> 01:25:13,250
Daddy?

1425
01:25:19,023 --> 01:25:20,455
Daddy?

1426
01:25:33,069 --> 01:25:35,169
Everything's okay.

1427
01:25:35,538 --> 01:25:39,706
I'm sorry. I forgot to put
you back on with Cathy.

1428
01:25:44,312 --> 01:25:45,944
You didn't cry because of that.

1429
01:25:45,946 --> 01:25:49,180
I didn't even want to talk to her.

1430
01:25:57,557 --> 01:26:01,158
Dad, can I say one thing?

1431
01:26:05,197 --> 01:26:06,496
Yeah.

1432
01:26:06,831 --> 01:26:09,665
You've got to make me supper.

1433
01:26:35,325 --> 01:26:39,694
Okay, here we go, kids.
On the set, please.

1434
01:26:39,696 --> 01:26:40,161
Set?

1435
01:26:40,163 --> 01:26:43,130
That pretend living
room right over there.

1436
01:26:43,265 --> 01:26:44,264
Set. Bye-bye.

1437
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:45,965
Wait, wait, Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie.

1438
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,700
Let Daddy give you a big kiss.

1439
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,768
No, I have to go to work.

1440
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:51,769
Is this the set?
That's the set.

1441
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:53,538
Thanks for trusting me.

1442
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:56,807
I love you, I love you. You're
the world's greatest mom.

1443
01:26:56,809 --> 01:26:58,241
I owe you everything.

1444
01:26:58,243 --> 01:26:59,775
Bye, honey.

1445
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:03,178
You just told me she was sad.

1446
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:06,214
No, I never said for you to look sad.

1447
01:27:06,216 --> 01:27:07,515
Okay, okay, wait.
No, come on.

1448
01:27:07,517 --> 01:27:10,518
Let me figure out how
to tell you what I want.

1449
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:12,986
I know what you want.
What?

1450
01:27:12,988 --> 01:27:15,321
You want that Jackee thing. No.

1451
01:27:15,323 --> 01:27:16,588
That very colored thing.

1452
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:17,589
No, way over the top.

1453
01:27:17,591 --> 01:27:18,890
Cop to it.
Yes, you do.

1454
01:27:18,892 --> 01:27:20,558
A little would be fun.

1455
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,526
Dad!

1456
01:27:22,928 --> 01:27:24,360
Daddy!

1457
01:27:26,263 --> 01:27:28,630
What? What? Come on.

1458
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,766
There's this trouble.

1459
01:27:31,768 --> 01:27:33,534
No, no, no, no.

1460
01:27:33,536 --> 01:27:35,235
Look, she's just very worried

1461
01:27:35,237 --> 01:27:38,438
about being able to pretend
cry when she has to,

1462
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:42,008
and she doesn't get it about memorizing,

1463
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:43,209
but that's all.

1464
01:27:43,211 --> 01:27:45,511
That's all?

1465
01:27:46,013 --> 01:27:46,811
Come here.

1466
01:27:46,813 --> 01:27:49,013
This isn't going to be good.
I can't do it.

1467
01:27:49,015 --> 01:27:51,048
Yeah, well, not with that attitude.

1468
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:54,184
It's just that... Did they
tell you what an audience is?

1469
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,753
Can you help me to cry?

1470
01:27:57,055 --> 01:27:58,587
Yes.

1471
01:27:58,589 --> 01:28:00,155
Yes, I can.

1472
01:28:00,157 --> 01:28:02,891
I can help make it okay.

1473
01:28:04,494 --> 01:28:05,960
Trust me.

1474
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:15,569
Now I can't even
understand what you're saying!

1475
01:28:15,571 --> 01:28:17,604
Do you know what trust means?

1476
01:28:17,606 --> 01:28:19,072
Not very.

1477
01:28:20,008 --> 01:28:23,142
It means that if something
is hard to believe,

1478
01:28:23,144 --> 01:28:24,776
you believe someone you trust

1479
01:28:24,778 --> 01:28:28,679
because you know he wouldn't
say it unless it were true.

1480
01:28:28,681 --> 01:28:30,414
You don't make sense!

1481
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:32,749
I don't understand you.

1482
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:40,088
I think you do.

1483
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:45,092
Just know that I'm gonna be here
for you whenever you need me.

1484
01:28:45,094 --> 01:28:47,561
I will always...
Okay!

1485
01:28:57,739 --> 01:28:59,705
I think you do.

1486
01:29:08,582 --> 01:29:10,181
We look like jerks
eating here at this hour.

1487
01:29:10,183 --> 01:29:15,386
Everybody's gonna think we couldn't get
a reservation during the hot hours.

1488
01:29:15,588 --> 01:29:18,355
Hey, great to see you!

1489
01:29:19,124 --> 01:29:21,624
Can't remember her name.

1490
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:25,260
Why do you do this to yourself?

1491
01:29:25,262 --> 01:29:25,526
What?

1492
01:29:25,528 --> 01:29:27,594
Why do you insist on
eating dinner in a restaurant

1493
01:29:27,596 --> 01:29:31,197
where you're bound to see all
the people you're afraid of?

1494
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,265
I'm not afraid of them.

1495
01:29:33,533 --> 01:29:37,067
What do you call it when you think that
what a group of people thinks of you

1496
01:29:37,069 --> 01:29:41,805
can confirm or destroy any decent
idea you have of yourself?

1497
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:44,007
Normal.

1498
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:46,509
How did little Jeannie do today?

1499
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:50,579
Isn't it something? They've got
you testing my new TV show.

1500
01:29:51,114 --> 01:29:53,781
What I asked was how did Jeannie do?

1501
01:29:53,783 --> 01:29:55,616
What are you talking about?

1502
01:29:55,618 --> 01:29:57,551
Somebody else.

1503
01:29:58,220 --> 01:29:59,886
Jeannie.

1504
01:30:00,054 --> 01:30:01,787
How did she do?

1505
01:30:03,557 --> 01:30:05,924
Don't talk to me like this.

1506
01:30:06,559 --> 01:30:11,795
I want to be treated as if I'm
really saying words to you,

1507
01:30:11,797 --> 01:30:14,564
which you engage and respond to.

1508
01:30:14,566 --> 01:30:18,000
I like Matt. I'd like to
know how his daughter did.

1509
01:30:18,002 --> 01:30:22,237
So before you start working
this room desperately,

1510
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:26,774
and I end up feeling
so sorry for you I could die,

1511
01:30:26,776 --> 01:30:30,010
I would like you to answer my question.
How did Jeannie do?

1512
01:30:30,012 --> 01:30:32,679
She did okay! All right, that's all.

1513
01:30:32,681 --> 01:30:34,080
No, no.

1514
01:30:37,418 --> 01:30:39,151
It's heating up.

1515
01:30:39,219 --> 01:30:41,686
Don't go.
Don't worry.

1516
01:30:41,688 --> 01:30:43,754
I'm not that mad.

1517
01:30:44,089 --> 01:30:46,289
I gotta go do this.

1518
01:30:55,233 --> 01:30:58,367
That son of a bitch.

1519
01:31:09,646 --> 01:31:12,213
How are you?
Nice to see you.

1520
01:31:12,215 --> 01:31:13,380
Lovely wife.
Yes.

1521
01:31:13,382 --> 01:31:15,215
The smartest guy in town.

1522
01:31:15,217 --> 01:31:16,583
This is my wife.

1523
01:31:16,585 --> 01:31:18,251
You, too.

1524
01:31:18,253 --> 01:31:20,853
How are you?
See you later.

1525
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:30,294
The world's funniest man. Bye-bye.

1526
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:31,695
My hand.

1527
01:31:36,635 --> 01:31:37,867
Where you going?

1528
01:31:37,869 --> 01:31:39,735
What's the matter with you?
Where you going?

1529
01:31:39,737 --> 01:31:42,204
Hi, Victor, how are you?

1530
01:31:42,206 --> 01:31:43,772
Jack. This is Nan.

1531
01:31:43,774 --> 01:31:46,975
Jack and of course, his lovely wife...

1532
01:31:46,977 --> 01:31:48,643
Elisabeth.
Elisabeth.

1533
01:31:48,645 --> 01:31:49,543
And of course...

1534
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:52,612
You know, come up with the great carpets.

1535
01:31:52,614 --> 01:31:54,113
Stacy.
Stacy!

1536
01:31:54,115 --> 01:31:55,013
This is Nan.

1537
01:31:55,015 --> 01:31:56,447
Victor, I called you yesterday...

1538
01:31:56,449 --> 01:31:58,749
I'm sorry I can't talk now.

1539
01:31:58,751 --> 01:32:00,984
I'm very upset about
what's happening to Burke,

1540
01:32:00,986 --> 01:32:05,388
so I just made up my mind that I
can't be witness to it anymore

1541
01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:06,021
if I love him.

1542
01:32:06,023 --> 01:32:08,256
And I certainly shouldn't
be here if I don't,

1543
01:32:08,258 --> 01:32:09,757
so I was just in the process of leaving

1544
01:32:09,759 --> 01:32:13,627
when he stopped me
and you folks walked in.

1545
01:32:13,629 --> 01:32:17,197
I'm sure you've had something
like this happen to you sometime,

1546
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:22,202
some horrible thing in your
personal life happening in public?

1547
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:24,771
Thank you for understanding.

1548
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:26,639
Goodbye.

1549
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:29,274
I wish only good things for you,

1550
01:32:29,276 --> 01:32:34,912
even though I feel I've been very
damaged by this relationship.

1551
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:37,213
I...

1552
01:32:37,515 --> 01:32:38,947
Wasn't that spectacular?

1553
01:32:38,949 --> 01:32:41,916
I've never seen anybody that secure.

1554
01:32:42,184 --> 01:32:43,683
Fantastic.

1555
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:52,824
- Hello?
<i>- Nan.</i>

1556
01:32:52,826 --> 01:32:53,624
Yeah?

1557
01:32:53,626 --> 01:32:56,393
<i>I hope I'm not calling too late.</i>

1558
01:32:57,596 --> 01:32:58,995
I'd like another chance.

1559
01:32:58,997 --> 01:33:03,733
You only think you feel that way
because you're on the verge of failure

1560
01:33:03,735 --> 01:33:05,868
and you're without a core.

1561
01:33:05,936 --> 01:33:08,403
See? No one
else gets me!

1562
01:33:11,673 --> 01:33:15,107
Do you wanna have a little sex?

1563
01:33:17,177 --> 01:33:21,712
You know, I've never hung
up on anybody in my life.

1564
01:33:21,714 --> 01:33:25,248
Because what if the next thing
they said solved everything?

1565
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:28,050
But I must end this conversation.

1566
01:33:28,052 --> 01:33:29,718
That's no?

1567
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,287
Hello? Nan?

1568
01:33:54,344 --> 01:33:56,477
I'm so nervous, Mommy.

1569
01:33:56,479 --> 01:33:58,479
You'll be fine.

1570
01:34:00,616 --> 01:34:01,314
Are you gonna need me?

1571
01:34:01,316 --> 01:34:04,784
The kids are rehearsing upstairs, and
I'd like to go up and take a look.

1572
01:34:04,786 --> 01:34:05,918
Yeah, sure.

1573
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,153
I have to stay inside
during lunch hours now anyway.

1574
01:34:08,155 --> 01:34:13,057
That's when everybody returns my calls
'cause they're trying to miss me.

1575
01:34:13,059 --> 01:34:14,925
Is that true?

1576
01:34:15,527 --> 01:34:16,959
Yeah.

1577
01:34:16,961 --> 01:34:18,994
Thanks for the support.

1578
01:34:25,135 --> 01:34:29,337
What's the most important thing
you do when you're acting?

1579
01:34:30,306 --> 01:34:31,872
You listen.

1580
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:33,740
Listening.
Right.

1581
01:34:34,042 --> 01:34:39,145
You're really worried about being able
to cry when you're supposed to, right?

1582
01:34:39,914 --> 01:34:41,446
Right.
Okay.

1583
01:34:41,448 --> 01:34:46,918
Well, you know, there are only two
ways to do a thing like that.

1584
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,655
One is to think of something
that really makes you sad.

1585
01:34:50,657 --> 01:34:55,993
Or two, forget you're you, and really
forget that you're pretending.

1586
01:35:03,301 --> 01:35:05,501
How do you do that?

1587
01:35:05,503 --> 01:35:08,203
Okay, you...

1588
01:35:09,806 --> 01:35:12,740
I could eat you for lunch
when I was your age

1589
01:35:12,742 --> 01:35:14,608
and I'm a hell of a lot bigger now!

1590
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:15,809
That's it.
That's it!

1591
01:35:15,811 --> 01:35:18,578
Do you see how it scared
you and you reacted?

1592
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:22,081
Now in acting, that's called
action, reaction. See?

1593
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:23,682
Don't do that again.

1594
01:35:23,684 --> 01:35:26,251
All right.

1595
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:29,053
Jeannie, they need you, honey.

1596
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:32,156
Come on.

1597
01:35:32,491 --> 01:35:34,057
Hurry up.
Let's go.

1598
01:35:34,059 --> 01:35:35,458
You're welcome!

1599
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:37,159
Come on, baby.

1600
01:35:37,161 --> 01:35:39,194
You're welcome.

1601
01:35:40,163 --> 01:35:41,829
You're welcome.

1602
01:35:51,506 --> 01:35:53,839
What's wrong?
Well...

1603
01:35:56,043 --> 01:35:57,475
To heck with it.

1604
01:35:57,477 --> 01:36:02,480
I'm a free man. Let's go to your house
and break the answering machine.

1605
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:05,749
You know, I could get away right now.

1606
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:09,252
No. I've got a big
meeting later...

1607
01:36:09,387 --> 01:36:11,653
We'd better take two cars.

1608
01:36:18,027 --> 01:36:19,059
I hope it's you.

1609
01:36:19,061 --> 01:36:21,261
You're a little nutty in the afternoon.

1610
01:36:21,263 --> 01:36:24,264
<i>So this is how the big ones make out?</i>

1611
01:36:24,266 --> 01:36:24,764
So what's new?

1612
01:36:24,766 --> 01:36:29,201
You know, this is the biggest bonus I
ever got out of a busted screen test.

1613
01:36:29,203 --> 01:36:32,571
<i>Someday you'll have to show it to me.</i>

1614
01:36:32,573 --> 01:36:33,638
Sure.

1615
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,739
No, no, I don't want to see it.

1616
01:36:34,741 --> 01:36:40,611
I'm just trying to figure out how to get
it out from under my skin. Forget it.

1617
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:44,780
Matt, will you take me off the speaker?

1618
01:36:45,215 --> 01:36:46,714
Sure.

1619
01:36:47,583 --> 01:36:48,615
What's the matter?

1620
01:36:48,617 --> 01:36:52,919
<i>Better talk fast. This is where
my phone always kicks out.</i>

1621
01:36:53,521 --> 01:36:56,522
<i>Matt, before someone else tells you,</i>

1622
01:36:56,524 --> 01:36:59,358
<i>I'd better confess something.</i>

1623
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,692
When we did your screen test...

1624
01:37:01,694 --> 01:37:03,660
Can you hear me?

1625
01:37:03,662 --> 01:37:04,794
Yes.

1626
01:37:04,796 --> 01:37:08,063
I sort of folded on you at the end.

1627
01:37:11,601 --> 01:37:13,167
<i>Matt?</i>

1628
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,135
You didn't like what I did?

1629
01:37:15,137 --> 01:37:17,337
No, I did, truly,

1630
01:37:17,339 --> 01:37:20,139
but the discussion got sort of dumb.

1631
01:37:20,141 --> 01:37:22,774
It was a question of sexiness.

1632
01:37:25,211 --> 01:37:28,245
You folded on whether or not I'm sexy.

1633
01:37:28,247 --> 01:37:30,380
You don't think I'm sexy?

1634
01:37:30,382 --> 01:37:32,148
And you expressed that to...

1635
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:35,784
Well, I tell you, I certainly
must think so pretty much

1636
01:37:35,786 --> 01:37:40,088
because I feel great about
where we're going now.

1637
01:37:45,394 --> 01:37:45,992
You very mad at me?

1638
01:37:45,994 --> 01:37:51,330
No, no, it's just that, you
know, I know that you were...

1639
01:37:51,965 --> 01:37:53,631
God!

1640
01:37:53,633 --> 01:37:54,932
I'm... Yeah.

1641
01:37:54,934 --> 01:37:58,268
Yeah, I am, damn it.
Damn it, I am.

1642
01:37:58,270 --> 01:37:59,802
<i>Matt!</i>

1643
01:38:00,738 --> 01:38:01,738
Matt!

1644
01:38:09,912 --> 01:38:12,178
- I know.
- Come on!

1645
01:38:16,284 --> 01:38:19,151
I don't know if I've been bad,

1646
01:38:19,153 --> 01:38:22,220
but I know somebody's been bad.

1647
01:38:22,222 --> 01:38:24,088
I'm a good kid.

1648
01:38:26,858 --> 01:38:29,925
Comb your hair.
Learn your lines.

1649
01:38:29,927 --> 01:38:32,093
I don't know if I've been bad,

1650
01:38:32,095 --> 01:38:34,528
but I know somebody's been bad.

1651
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:36,463
Maybe it's you.

1652
01:38:42,837 --> 01:38:45,237
I won't be able to do it.

1653
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:48,006
Parents, please? Parents, parents?
Thank you.

1654
01:38:48,008 --> 01:38:49,307
Remember, when you're in the audience,

1655
01:38:49,309 --> 01:38:53,010
be sure you laugh and applaud,
even if it's somebody else's kid.

1656
01:38:53,012 --> 01:38:55,545
Please try to follow the rules.

1657
01:38:55,547 --> 01:38:57,547
They're really very simple.

1658
01:38:57,549 --> 01:39:00,049
You're not allowed near the stage, okay?

1659
01:39:00,051 --> 01:39:02,117
Now, if you haven't signed a contract,

1660
01:39:02,119 --> 01:39:04,419
be sure that before you leave
this building tonight,

1661
01:39:04,421 --> 01:39:06,254
that all your paperwork's done...

1662
01:39:06,256 --> 01:39:09,090
You're not allowed near the stage.

1663
01:39:09,992 --> 01:39:11,758
Hey, you're not allowed near the stage.

1664
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,160
<i>How's everybody doing tonight?</i>

1665
01:39:14,162 --> 01:39:18,264
<i>We are excited today. We're
here to see</i> The Rainbow House.

1666
01:39:18,266 --> 01:39:21,667
I just found out that we
bow before we do anything.

1667
01:39:21,669 --> 01:39:23,802
Great!
Then everybody claps!

1668
01:39:23,804 --> 01:39:24,169
Great!

1669
01:39:24,171 --> 01:39:27,071
I made up a great bow.
Are you going to look?

1670
01:39:27,073 --> 01:39:29,606
I wouldn't miss it.
Yes?

1671
01:39:29,608 --> 01:39:31,207
Yes!

1672
01:39:33,311 --> 01:39:34,710
What's wrong?

1673
01:39:34,712 --> 01:39:37,646
I won't be able to cry.
It's too hard for me.

1674
01:39:37,648 --> 01:39:42,617
Look, they'll give you a lot of
chances after everyone leaves.

1675
01:39:42,619 --> 01:39:47,221
You'll get to do it over and over
till you get it right. Don't worry.

1676
01:39:47,223 --> 01:39:48,689
Okay?

1677
01:39:50,692 --> 01:39:54,994
<i>It is my pleasure now to introduce a
bunch of very talented young actors.</i>

1678
01:39:54,996 --> 01:39:58,964
<i>Let's start off with the
charming Heather Deloach.</i>

1679
01:39:58,966 --> 01:40:01,700
<i>A big round of applause for Heather.</i>

1680
01:40:01,702 --> 01:40:05,303
<i>DJ Dellos!
Let's get him out here.</i>

1681
01:40:05,705 --> 01:40:07,337
<i>Brittany Johnson!</i>

1682
01:40:07,339 --> 01:40:08,738
Matt!

1683
01:40:10,108 --> 01:40:12,575
<i>Here is Tricia Joe!</i>

1684
01:40:12,577 --> 01:40:14,043
Matt!

1685
01:40:15,613 --> 01:40:17,613
I don't want to miss her introduction.

1686
01:40:17,615 --> 01:40:18,947
I'll talk fast.
It's amazing news.

1687
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:23,918
Oliver Stone's been looking for a
comedy, and he's doing my picture!

1688
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:24,752
Good for you.

1689
01:40:24,754 --> 01:40:25,853
No, but part of this involves you.

1690
01:40:25,855 --> 01:40:27,688
He remembers you from <i>Platoon,</i>

1691
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:30,157
and he wants to use you in this one.

1692
01:40:32,127 --> 01:40:34,727
Got your attention?

1693
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:43,669
<i>And now I'd like to introduce
a very special young girl,</i>

1694
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:46,004
<i>Jennifer Cabrera!</i>

1695
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:48,106
Cathy.

1696
01:40:48,508 --> 01:40:50,207
Look, I'm going to watch this.

1697
01:40:50,209 --> 01:40:52,075
Let me talk to you later or tomorrow.

1698
01:40:52,077 --> 01:40:52,942
<i>Jeannie Hobbs!</i>

1699
01:40:52,944 --> 01:40:55,511
It's really good news.
I gotta go!

1700
01:40:55,579 --> 01:40:57,612
<i>What show is complete without twins?</i>

1701
01:40:57,614 --> 01:40:59,480
<i>Alissa and Danielle Dowdy!</i>

1702
01:41:01,917 --> 01:41:02,949
I missed it!
I missed it!

1703
01:41:02,951 --> 01:41:05,751
I promised her I'd see it
and I missed it!

1704
01:41:05,753 --> 01:41:08,320
Get a grip.
She'll recover.

1705
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:12,890
Just stop worrying about it.

1706
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:13,823
I mean,

1707
01:41:13,825 --> 01:41:18,093
my father never saw any of
my things when I was a kid.

1708
01:41:22,732 --> 01:41:25,632
This looks intense.
Excuse me.

1709
01:41:25,634 --> 01:41:28,034
Good luck tonight, Matt.
I bet it'll be great.

1710
01:41:28,036 --> 01:41:30,336
Thank you. What's going on?
What are you doing?

1711
01:41:30,338 --> 01:41:34,006
<i>We'll start the show in
a couple of minutes.</i>

1712
01:41:34,008 --> 01:41:37,676
She's wishing me luck because of my kid.

1713
01:41:42,882 --> 01:41:44,948
Why are you doing this to me?

1714
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:47,984
Is it because of that screen test thing?

1715
01:41:48,953 --> 01:41:50,585
No, I don't think so.

1716
01:41:50,587 --> 01:41:51,218
Well, don't be like this!

1717
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:55,755
I mean, especially since anyone in the world
would have done the same thing I did.

1718
01:41:55,757 --> 01:41:59,792
I don't know.
It's a big world.

1719
01:42:00,194 --> 01:42:01,159
Look,

1720
01:42:01,161 --> 01:42:04,729
I don't have a kid or a mate or a talent.

1721
01:42:04,731 --> 01:42:10,000
I've got my work and I am not gonna
apologize for thinking it's important.

1722
01:42:10,002 --> 01:42:12,969
I am being real here, Matt.

1723
01:42:13,771 --> 01:42:19,307
You're not going to make me
miss one minute of this show.

1724
01:42:19,309 --> 01:42:21,042
I am late for three things now too,

1725
01:42:21,044 --> 01:42:24,845
two of which are really
important, and I am taking the...

1726
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:26,913
Don't miss them.

1727
01:42:27,448 --> 01:42:31,283
I couldn't help overhearing because
I was intentionally eavesdropping.

1728
01:42:31,285 --> 01:42:34,252
Don't feel bad.
It's not your fault.

1729
01:42:34,254 --> 01:42:36,554
It's not?
No.

1730
01:42:36,856 --> 01:42:39,523
It's just that he's too good for you.

1731
01:42:55,107 --> 01:42:59,275
Get Kate in here, and then you
can have your favorite food.

1732
01:42:59,277 --> 01:43:00,809
What is your favorite food?

1733
01:43:00,811 --> 01:43:02,277
Carbohydrates!

1734
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:05,947
You're lucky you already got to do yours.

1735
01:43:05,949 --> 01:43:07,114
Yeah.

1736
01:43:07,116 --> 01:43:10,183
When the light goes on, you go in, okay?

1737
01:43:12,187 --> 01:43:14,620
I said stop.

1738
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:15,286
Will you stop?

1739
01:43:15,288 --> 01:43:20,491
I want all you kids out. Clear out
so I can have a talk with her.

1740
01:43:38,944 --> 01:43:41,245
Nan?
Just a second.

1741
01:43:43,549 --> 01:43:46,917
Just sit there and wait till I sign this.

1742
01:43:47,352 --> 01:43:49,819
Okay, time to do this! Everybody, out!

1743
01:43:49,821 --> 01:43:51,921
Not you, fool.
And not you.

1744
01:43:51,923 --> 01:43:53,255
Go easy on her.

1745
01:43:53,257 --> 01:43:55,390
Now, you gonna hear what I have to say,

1746
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:58,926
and I'm gonna listen
to what you have to say.

1747
01:43:59,528 --> 01:44:03,496
This is as much about me
as it is about you.

1748
01:44:03,498 --> 01:44:04,830
Now go ahead.

1749
01:44:04,832 --> 01:44:07,132
Say what you got to say.

1750
01:44:09,703 --> 01:44:11,936
What do you think?

1751
01:44:11,938 --> 01:44:14,138
Wait, wait. Listen.

1752
01:44:15,241 --> 01:44:17,107
Stop rocking.

1753
01:44:18,844 --> 01:44:21,110
Now what's going on?

1754
01:44:21,112 --> 01:44:23,912
It's like everyone's pis...

1755
01:44:23,914 --> 01:44:25,580
Ticked off at me

1756
01:44:32,054 --> 01:44:34,487
because I'm not colored!

1757
01:44:34,489 --> 01:44:36,121
The word is "black."

1758
01:44:36,123 --> 01:44:39,557
The word is
"African-American."

1759
01:44:43,161 --> 01:44:46,762
What do we do with a new word?
We use it in a sentence.

1760
01:44:46,764 --> 01:44:52,734
Go ahead. Use African-American
in a sentence.

1761
01:44:57,507 --> 01:45:00,641
This is where she has to cry.

1762
01:45:04,179 --> 01:45:06,212
Look at me! I...

1763
01:45:19,594 --> 01:45:21,660
They should cut.

1764
01:46:02,701 --> 01:46:05,902
I love an African-American.

1765
01:46:07,672 --> 01:46:11,373
I love a little redneck.

1766
01:46:16,513 --> 01:46:17,812
What?

1767
01:46:17,814 --> 01:46:19,146
No.

1768
01:46:38,066 --> 01:46:41,767
It's okay, Jeannie. We just need
to get that hug at the end.

1769
01:46:41,769 --> 01:46:43,301
Amazing.
Amazing, right?

1770
01:46:43,303 --> 01:46:45,002
You were great.

1771
01:46:49,074 --> 01:46:51,474
Do you want me to put you down?

1772
01:46:51,476 --> 01:46:53,676
No, this is okay.

1773
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:01,550
Okay, you have some more work to do.

1774
01:47:01,552 --> 01:47:05,186
You have to go hug the lady
just like you did me.

1775
01:47:05,188 --> 01:47:06,587
Wait.

1776
01:47:08,257 --> 01:47:10,624
I'm very proud of you.

1777
01:47:13,895 --> 01:47:16,662
I love you more than anybody.

1778
01:47:28,075 --> 01:47:29,474
When I had to cry,

1779
01:47:29,476 --> 01:47:33,878
I was thinking of someone
taking me away from you.

1780
01:47:44,423 --> 01:47:46,322
Give me a kiss.

1781
01:47:51,095 --> 01:47:56,331
All right, we're clear.
We're not done yet. Come on.

1782
01:48:08,343 --> 01:48:11,243
I can't hear you!
You're a grownup!

1783
01:48:11,245 --> 01:48:13,445
My ear is bleeding!

1784
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:23,453
Hey, Jeannie!
You did it!

1785
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:28,691
Do you have any idea
how special you were?

1786
01:48:28,693 --> 01:48:29,958
That looks like a yes.

1787
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:31,626
Gotta get dressed for the party.

1788
01:48:31,628 --> 01:48:33,494
There's more?

1789
01:48:33,662 --> 01:48:36,195
The party's on the roof!

1790
01:48:53,144 --> 01:48:54,309
Wait a second.

1791
01:48:54,311 --> 01:48:54,809
I wanna see my kid!

1792
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:59,113
They're taking the cast picture
now, so just wait for one second.

1793
01:49:00,316 --> 01:49:00,714
Nan...

1794
01:49:00,716 --> 01:49:04,117
She doesn't look like the
women I normally go out with.

1795
01:49:04,119 --> 01:49:07,720
But you know what
they say. Beauty fades.

1796
01:49:07,722 --> 01:49:11,557
What they don't say
is it fades very slowly.

1797
01:49:15,729 --> 01:49:18,262
You don't think I can
tell you what to do.

1798
01:49:18,264 --> 01:49:21,198
No, no!
Only I can do that.

1799
01:49:21,533 --> 01:49:24,400
I want you to tell me what to feel.

1800
01:49:25,369 --> 01:49:28,670
This Oliver Stone thing,
does he really want me?

1801
01:49:28,672 --> 01:49:29,203
Yeah.

1802
01:49:29,205 --> 01:49:32,739
I forgot to say congratulations.

1803
01:49:36,144 --> 01:49:37,042
Which part?

1804
01:49:37,044 --> 01:49:37,776
Which part do you want?

1805
01:49:37,778 --> 01:49:40,178
One of the two leads wouldn't be bad.

1806
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:43,514
No. It's the crippled
factory owner.

1807
01:49:53,559 --> 01:49:56,092
Best part in the movie.

1808
01:50:04,569 --> 01:50:06,702
Jeannie?
Smile!

1809
01:50:07,304 --> 01:50:08,569
Smile.

1810
01:50:10,506 --> 01:50:12,672
Yeah, Mom!

1811
01:50:23,249 --> 01:50:24,681
Daddy.

1812
01:50:35,626 --> 01:50:37,525
Why are you breathing so heavy?

1813
01:50:37,527 --> 01:50:38,759
I'm nervous!

1814
01:50:38,761 --> 01:50:42,996
Look, let's move our thing
in a more regular direction.

1815
01:50:42,998 --> 01:50:44,931
What does that mean?

1816
01:50:44,933 --> 01:50:46,565
Let me think.

1817
01:50:47,434 --> 01:50:50,902
Why don't we go out this weekend?

1818
01:50:51,604 --> 01:50:53,437
With your kid.

1819
01:50:55,974 --> 01:50:58,140
Whose name is...

1820
01:51:04,114 --> 01:51:05,713
Leslie.

1821
01:51:09,185 --> 01:51:11,685
Okay.
Okay.

1822
01:51:21,463 --> 01:51:22,829
I was right?

1823
01:51:24,832 --> 01:51:26,231
Jerk.

1824
01:51:42,215 --> 01:51:44,014
Last ones here?

1825
01:51:44,016 --> 01:51:45,548
I told you.

1826
01:51:47,852 --> 01:51:50,619
What did you think of my bow?
I didn't see it.

1827
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:51,419
I know that!

1828
01:51:51,421 --> 01:51:53,654
Well, don't push.
Show it to me.

1829
01:51:53,656 --> 01:51:55,489
All right.

1830
01:52:13,876 --> 01:52:15,008
Hey, I got a part in a movie.

1831
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:19,379
Good. Don't you just love
it when that happens?

1832
01:52:19,547 --> 01:52:21,647
Yeah, I guess I do.

1833
01:52:28,756 --> 01:52:30,989
<i>¶ You are the best</i>

1834
01:52:30,991 --> 01:52:32,757
<i>¶ You can do everything</i>

1835
01:52:32,759 --> 01:52:37,461
<i>¶ You can be everything you want to be</i>

1836
01:52:37,463 --> 01:52:39,663
<i>¶ You are a smile</i>

1837
01:52:39,665 --> 01:52:41,431
<i>¶ You are a rainbow</i>

1838
01:52:41,433 --> 01:52:46,035
<i>¶ You were created so perfectly</i>

1839
01:52:46,203 --> 01:52:48,336
<i>¶ Sometimes we laugh</i>

1840
01:52:48,338 --> 01:52:49,770
<i>¶ Sometimes we cry</i>

1841
01:52:49,772 --> 01:52:54,808
<i>¶ Sometimes we hurt inside
and don't understand why</i>

1842
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:57,110
<i>¶ We're only human</i>

1843
01:52:57,112 --> 01:52:58,511
<i>¶ We make mistakes</i>

1844
01:52:58,513 --> 01:53:05,251
<i>¶ Sometimes it seems like only
other people get the breaks ¶</i>

1845
01:56:03,831 --> 01:56:05,897
<i>¶ And give me money</i>

1846
01:56:05,899 --> 01:56:08,032
<i>¶ And have a teacher there</i>

1847
01:56:08,034 --> 01:56:09,333
<i>¶ And a person to braid my hair</i>

1848
01:56:09,335 --> 01:56:13,570
<i>¶ And color my face and give me clothes ¶</i>
