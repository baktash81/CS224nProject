One Adam 12. See the woman?

38
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:24,508
Houston, we have a problem up here.

39
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,133
It's half past the hour...

40
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:29,206
and now time for the news
with Michael St. James.

41
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:31,367
What do you make of it?

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,233
I don't know, Joe.

43
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:36,100
No weapons, no motive, no clothes.

44
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:39,732
All we've got to go on
is this bloody corpse.

45
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,773
- Well, look again, Harry.
- Huh?

46
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:48,599
Not blood...

47
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:53,884
Due in a large part to
a major surplus of tomatoes.

48
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,601
Tomato juice.

49
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:01,532
The tomato crop continues to grow
at an unprecedented rate.

50
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,957
Within the last 12 hours,
we have received...

51
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:07,015
a number of unconfirmed reports
from throughout the nation...

52
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,911
that may or may not be connected to
this strange phenomenon.

53
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,148
Sure doesn't taste like tomato juice.

54
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:28,283
Look at the giant tomato, Martha.

55
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,774
I didn't knew they grew 'em so big, Jess.

56
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
I wonder where he's going.

57
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,208
He got little Timmy.

58
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,541
Poor Timmy.

59
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:41,250
He ate him all up.

60
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,898
The tomatoes are coming!
Sheriff, they're coming!

61
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:26,946
My god, did you see that?
A tomato...

62
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:29,258
You didn't see anything.
You didn't hear anything.

63
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:31,745
- The pilot's still in there.
- Forget about the pilot.

64
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:34,178
- Come over here!
- We can't leave him.

65
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,800
It's just too incredible!
A kamikaze tomato!

66
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,523
- Tomatoes can't fly!
- Yeah?

67
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:41,948
They can't eat people either, but
they're doing one heck of an impression.

68
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:45,033
Jim, talk to that sheriff and find out
what's going on.

69
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,261
Get over here!

70
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,026
How bad is it?

71
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,702
Well, sir, I definitely
don't think it'll fly again.

72
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:51,352
I'm not talking about that, you Weiner!

73
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:52,165
What about the tomatoes.

74
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,200
We found two more bodies
at the main road...

75
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,432
but we pushed the tomatoes
back to the north end.

76
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,907
I don't think any managed to bust loose.

77
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:58,548
They better not have.
I want this thing contained!

78
00:05:58,572 --> 00:05:59,886
I understand,
but nothing seems to stop them.

79
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,632
We tried chemicals, bugs, bullets.
Nothing seems to work.

80
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:09,200
Look, the President wants
a complete investigation.

81
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,736
We can't let this out.
People would...

82
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:11,761
Panic, that's what.

83
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,142
And you know whose ass is on the line?

84
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:16,142
Yours, mine, and the entire AG department.

85
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,167
Look out!

86
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,837
What if the President
wants an investigation?

87
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:25,027
He'll get his investigation,
but we'll keep it quiet.

88
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:27,467
I've arranged for the
most obscure generals...

89
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,683
the most obscure scientists,
and to head the investigation...

90
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:32,947
this man.

91
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,952
- I don't recognize him.
- Nobody does.

92
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:37,100
His name is Mason Dixon.

93
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,832
He hasn't worked since the bay of pigs.

94
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,793
- Is there any sign of a problem elsewhere?
- Not yet.

95
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,950
I've ordered the entire G.D.♪.
program shut down.

96
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:44,633
Wait a minute.

97
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,967
Isn't that Jim Richardson,
the Press Secretary?

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,755
What's he doing here?

99
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,898
The President's got him keeping an eye
on the investigation.

100
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:52,428
- Why him?
- He's got a vegetable garden, that's why.

101
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,116
With peas and carrots
and squash and tomatoes.

102
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,559
That sheriff tells me...

103
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,535
there were reports of incidents like this
all over the county.

104
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:00,240
Oh, bullshit. One nut spots a
flying saucer, and pretty soon...

105
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:01,735
everybody's shaking hands
with little green men.

106
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,799
God, who would've thought.

107
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,609
All we wanted was a
bigger, healthier tomato.

108
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,867
Look out!
Here it comes again!

109
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:10,333
Where did you get this one, general?

110
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,567
Oh, I won that one in a
three-legged sack race...

111
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,518
last armed forces day picnic.

112
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,400
What's the matter with general number two?

113
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,900
Oh, he was out all night on manoeuvrers.
Let him rest.

114
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:21,566
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, gentlemen.

115
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:22,795
Would you follow me, please?

116
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,973
Certainly.

117
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,584
Oh, general, would you wake up, please?

118
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,067
I apologize for the size of this
room, gentlemen.

119
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,065
It's all I could do on such short notice.

120
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,333
Now, are we all here?

121
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:17,537
Where's Jim Richardson?

122
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:18,935
- The Press Secretary?
- Yes.

123
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,800
Perhaps we can give him a few more minutes.

124
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,800
General, I've been meaning to ask you...

125
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,456
have you heard anything
about the nuclear strike force...

126
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:28,100
tactical training command meeting?

127
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,100
- You mean operation nichefict?
- That's right.

128
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,843
Not really. I've been following
the personnel proficiency planning...

129
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,967
for Pago-Pago paratroop platoon patrols.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,233
Oh, operation ppppp.

131
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,933
- What's the poop on ppppp?
- Moving well.

132
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,767
Did somebody mention misfits?

133
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,548
- No. Ppppp.
- Ah.

134
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:45,906
Well, then, nichefict must be pretty well
wrapped up.

135
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,550
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

136
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:18,236
Now that we're all here...

137
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:20,267
I'd like to turn the meeting
over to Dr. Morrison.

138
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,933
- Doctor?
- Thank you, captain.

139
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,604
- Major.
- Pardon me?

140
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:24,846
Never mind.

141
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:30,267
Well, as I'm sure you're well aware...

142
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,767
this tomato problem has caused
considerable concern...

143
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,432
within the scientific community.

144
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:38,398
Scientists throughout the nation have...

145
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,249
directed their attention to this...

146
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:41,652
very vexing problem...

147
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:43,526
with only limited success.

148
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:45,365
However...

149
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,200
with the help of Dr. Fuji Nokitofa...

150
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,353
we believe we've made a breakthrough.

151
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:53,666
Gentlemen, may I present Dr. Nokitofa.

152
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:54,800
How do you do, doctor?

153
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,462
Very well, thank you.

154
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:59,800
Dr. Nokitofa, would you please explain...

155
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,300
the project to the gentlemen?

156
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:15,142
Gentlemen, what we have developed
is, in essence...

157
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:17,105
a half-man, half-robot...

158
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,294
a very sophisticated combination...

159
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,164
of human intelligence
and superhuman powers...

160
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:24,833
which we are confident will
result in the ultimate...

161
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,967
destruction of the enemy.

162
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,994
Thank you, Dr. Nokitofa.

163
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,233
Are there any comments, gentlemen?

164
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:37,267
Mr. Black?

165
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,167
As head of the federal
intelligence agency...

166
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,667
I certainly don't mean to
question the background...

167
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,867
of these fine gentlemen...

168
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,633
but frankly, I don't think
the answer to this problem...

169
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,200
lies in trinkets and gadgets.

170
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:53,767
This is man versus vegetable.

171
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:57,289
Technically, sir, tomatoes are fags.

172
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,200
He means fruits.

173
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:02,800
Ah. Fruits.

174
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,667
You see what I mean?

175
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:09,833
Mr. Dixon, I've been authorized to
assign you four of my best agents.

176
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,707
Gentlemen, with your
permission, I'd like to...

177
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:15,262
introduce Mr. Dixon to his operatives.

178
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:16,295
That's fine, Mr. Platt.

179
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:18,870
In the meantime, the rest of us
will accompany the doctors...

180
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:21,838
down to view a demonstration of the latest
anti-tomato project.

181
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:23,700
We'll be going outside, Mr. Dixon.

182
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,000
You'd better bring your coat.

183
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,942
There's a little jap in the air.

184
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:28,800
He means nip.

185
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,367
♪ Wash, wash, wash. ♪
♪ Scrub, scrub, scrub. ♪

186
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:42,743
♪ Can you get my back? ♪

187
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,300
Oh, my eyes!
Oh, my eyes!

188
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:57,044
Water! Water!

189
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:07,233
Actually, gentlemen,
this project entails...

190
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:10,183
the development of limbs
with superhuman powers.

191
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:13,300
Unfortunately...

192
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,896
budget limitations have restricted
our development to only...

193
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:18,854
one of these technologically advanced legs.

194
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:22,376
Okay, Bruce, now let's try running first.

195
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:27,926
Uh, that'll be fine, Bruce.

196
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:30,991
Bruce...

197
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:33,758
please jump for us.

198
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,533
Despite some minor
recruitment difficulties...

199
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,912
caused by our recent ♪.R. Problem...

200
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,933
I believe you'll find that your unit...

201
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,100
will meet the highest of standards.

202
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:51,687
Pynchon.

203
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,262
Your men, Dixon.

204
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:58,738
Sam Smith, disguise expert.

205
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:01,567
Gretta Attenbaum, swimming expert.

206
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:04,233
Gretta defected to us
after the last Olympics.

207
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,933
We feel she's gonna be quite an addition
to the department.

208
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,361
Greg Colburn, underwater expert.

209
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:14,833
The fourth member of your unit, It.
Finletter...

210
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:17,233
is winding up his current mission.

211
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:19,500
He'll contact you at these coordinates.

212
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,896
Expect him at 10-100 hours.

213
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:24,103
Good luck, Dixon.

214
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:45,142
Can you, like, believe how he waffles
on every issue?

215
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:46,471
Oh, right on.

216
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:50,051
We'll never have another president as bad
as this one.

217
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:10,506
What is it? Over there!

218
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:15,172
No! No!

219
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:38,132
Mr. Daniels, I realize that in the past...

220
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,743
there have been some questions raised...

221
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,172
regarding the president's
use of public funds...

222
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:44,767
for what some may consider personal items.

223
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,475
However, I can say without
fear of contradiction...

224
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,600
that under no circumstances
and at no time...

225
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,667
has the current administration expended...

226
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,400
any public monies whatsoever...

227
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:59,700
for the purchase of the fluffy flower-print
toilet paper.

228
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:02,467
Now, if there are no further questions...

229
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,067
Thank you, Mr. Press Secretary.

230
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,293
Mr. Secretary!
Mr. Secretary!

231
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:09,884
Just a moment, gentlemen.

232
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:13,612
One more question.
The little fellow in the rear.

233
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:16,222
Bobby Jenks, sir, ♪.S. 149.

234
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:17,733
I have a question, sir.

235
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:20,772
Certainly, young man.
What would you like to know?

236
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:23,741
We've heard nothing at all about
the growing tomato menace.

237
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:28,290
I...

238
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,133
Uh...

239
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,473
Wouldn't exactly call it a
menace, young man.

240
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,433
There have been some isolated reports...

241
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:44,133
alleged incidents involving
some unusual activity...

242
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,567
associated with this, uh...

243
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,682
particular vegetable...

244
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,000
but I assure you that, uh...

245
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,133
this is not and never will become a menace.

246
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:57,033
However, the President,
leaving no stone unturned, has...

247
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:01,333
called upon our most noted
congressional leaders in this field...

248
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:04,400
to begin a thorough,
intensive, painstaking...

249
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,500
and exhaustive investigation...

250
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,228
into the backgrounds and origins of this...

251
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,103
interesting quirk of nature.

252
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:17,033
Furthermore, you can assure all of your
young readers that...

253
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:20,600
this will never become a problem
that Americans need fear.

254
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:28,433
This, uh, meeting of the senate
investigating committee's...

255
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,400
called to order.

256
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,967
Anybody remember what we're
supposed to be investigating?

257
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:40,467
- The tomatoes, Wayne.
- What was it?

258
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:43,459
We're investigating those tomatoes.

259
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:46,967
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, of course. Yes.

260
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:50,967
Well, there's one for you...

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
one for you...

262
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:54,439
one here for me...

263
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,217
one for you.

264
00:16:57,806 --> 00:17:00,440
There's supposed to be one for everybody.

265
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,900
Wonder where it could be.

266
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:12,373
Good morning, city herald.
May I help you?

267
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,533
Roberts!

268
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,141
- Sir?
- Get me Goldstein.

269
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,533
- He's still in Beirut, sir.
- Beirut?

270
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:25,026
Yes, he's fired, sir.

271
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:26,884
Oh. Yeah.
Get me Johnson.

272
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:30,000
Sorry, sir.
He's covering that trial in Texas.

273
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,170
Oh, cripes!

274
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:35,100
Okay, just get me anybody
in the special assignment desk.

275
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:37,167
They're all on special assignment.

276
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,328
Goddamn it!
Who the hell is here?

277
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:42,300
Well, uh, there's you, sir.

278
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you, Julius.

279
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:47,000
Wait a minute.

280
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:49,333
- There's Fairchild.
- Who the hell is he?

281
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,200
She. Sir.

282
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:53,530
Lois Fairchild, society section.

283
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,221
The new kid?

284
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,990
Society, huh?

285
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,779
Oh, what the hell.
Send her in.

286
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:04,475
Now, damn it!

287
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:32,179
Hey, look. It's a funky little tomato.

288
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,067
- Where are we going?
- Take the old mission road.

289
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,797
Some crazy-ass biker has got himself
munched on by a herd of tomatoes.

290
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:53,275
- So what can we do?
- We can keep it quiet, that's what.

291
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:54,870
Didn't you hear the police radio?

292
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:56,482
It's solid tomatoes
between here and Holtville.

293
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:57,648
We're liable to get killed!

294
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,315
Will you can it, you little pud-puller?

295
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:01,676
If John Q. Public finds out
what's really going down...

296
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,633
we're both as good as dead.

297
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:07,593
Fairchild, sir.

298
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:10,000
- Hmm?
- Fairchild.

299
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:12,067
You sent for me?

300
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,850
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Have a seat.

301
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,000
Fairchild, I've been keeping my eye on you.

302
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,647
You've got a good sense of organization.

303
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:23,031
Thank you, sir.

304
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:24,661
Fluid style.

305
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:26,558
- Thank you, sir.
- Sharp mind.

306
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:27,716
Thank you, sir.

307
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,467
- A nice ass.
- Thank...

308
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,100
I'm about to give you a challenge...

309
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,933
your first big assignment...

310
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,067
and I expect you to use...

311
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,812
every attribute at your disposal.

312
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:41,150
I'm sure that what you
lack in experience...

313
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:44,241
you'll more than make up for in...

314
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,096
Determination.

315
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:47,745
Now...

316
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:51,033
this will give you the
necessary background...

317
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,577
to handle the assignment.

318
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,067
Go to it.

319
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,876
Right away, sir.

320
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,459
Uh, one more thing, Fairchild:

321
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,073
I'm certain the government
will go to unbelievable lengths...

322
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,904
to ensure the secrecy of this thing.

323
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:09,483
Good luck.

324
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,733
Help! Help!

325
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,346
Do you read me?
Do you read me?

326
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:29,471
Go away! Go away!

327
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,000
- Do you read me? Do you read me?
- Are you happy now?

328
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,767
You kept it so goddamned secret,
nobody knows where the hell we are!

329
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,967
- Do you read? Do you read?
- Help me! S.O.S.!

330
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:41,791
Give me that, for Christ sake!

331
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,200
You can't tell me to shut up! I quit!

332
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:46,067
What? You can't quit!
The department...

333
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,933
Screw the department!
I'm gonna die!

334
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:50,815
You conceited little
S.O.B., I'm gonna die too!

335
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:53,506
Good! Good!
Good, good, good...

336
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:58,233
Not good, Mr. President.
Not good at all.

337
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:00,233
Frankly, I was not overly impressed...

338
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:03,702
with the level of competency displayed
by the scientific team.

339
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:06,494
I haven't seen Dixon's
special forces unit yet...

340
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,800
but if it's anything like
what I've seen so far...

341
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,059
I'd say we're in for a bit of trouble.

342
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,767
I know what you mean, Jim.
I know what you mean.

343
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:17,367
It's like trying to stack bibles...

344
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,267
on whipped cream.

345
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,667
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, an unusual problem...

346
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,635
calls for an ingenious solution.

347
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,260
I think I've got one.

348
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,633
Jim, have you ever heard of mind maker?

349
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,508
Certainly, sir.

350
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,031
The advertising agency
you used in your campaign.

351
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,267
That's right.

352
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:35,107
You know,
they said I'd never get re-elected...

353
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,126
especially after it got out
that I used the Statue of Liberty...

354
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:39,900
as collateral on that Arab loan.

355
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,638
- Yes, sir.
- But...

356
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:44,078
I'm sitting here now...

357
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:46,704
and I owe it all to mind maker.

358
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,177
Incidentally, Jim...

359
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:51,186
you were in the Middle East last summer.

360
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:54,622
Tell me, how does the old girl look
in the Dead Sea?

361
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,067
- Just grand, sir.
- Good.

362
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,238
I tell you, Jim,
if those fellows could elect me...

363
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:01,795
- They can do anything.
- Yes, sir.

364
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:04,933
Jim, I want you to fly
to New York immediately.

365
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,633
I want you to see Ted Swann.

366
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:09,267
Believe me, the man's a genius.

367
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,997
I'm on my way, sir.

368
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:21,090
Yes, Sir.
That's the whole story.

369
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:24,142
Say, would you want to buy a used crib?

370
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:27,845
I don't think so,
but I appreciate this information.

371
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,304
This could be especially helpful in...

372
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,867
Fairchild, from the times.

373
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:42,267
What's this deal about tomatoes?

374
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:44,999
Look, buddy, don't try and stonewall me.

375
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:48,294
- Hi there, Lois.
- Oh. Hi, Clark.

376
00:22:51,018 --> 00:22:52,635
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, no comment.

377
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:53,841
And who's he?

378
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:54,913
No comment.

379
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,560
How serious is this situation?

380
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:57,816
No comment.

381
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,833
- The American public has a right to know.
- Up, up, and away!

382
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,982
You can't ignore the press.

383
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,371
Dixon!

384
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,433
Dixon!

385
00:23:08,818 --> 00:23:10,271
Dixon!

386
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:13,033
Dixon!

387
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,067
Hey, guys, here's the song
everybody's been asking for:

388
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,486
Ronny Desmond's puberty love.

389
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:22,227
♪ Puberty, puberty love ♪

390
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,346
Oh, wow, what is that?

391
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:26,267
Oh, no! Don't tell me that's the song.

392
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,167
Please, oh!
Turn it off!

393
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,449
Oh, it's torture on the ears!
I can't stand that noise!

394
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:41,533
Quiet! I want to hear the news.

395
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,533
And today,
the president closed the nation's...

396
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:46,818
last remaining sub base at Groton,
Connecticut.

397
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,986
When asked why he had made
the startling decision...

398
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,518
the President responded:

399
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:55,600
Those funny little black ships
just keep sinking anyway.

400
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:58,989
And in other news today,
in Newark, New Jersey,

401
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:02,800
a man was eaten by a bacon,
lettuce and tomato sandwich.

402
00:24:42,677 --> 00:24:44,743
You're free!

403
00:25:19,238 --> 00:25:22,867
Geronimo!

404
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:52,484
Hmm.

405
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:55,000
So you're Finletter, huh?

406
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:57,708
I'm Mason Dixon, and this is...

407
00:25:57,733 --> 00:26:01,133
My god!
It's Adolf Hitler!

408
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,664
This is Sam Smith.

409
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:26,574
He's our undercover expert.

410
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:30,067
He's only disguised as Adolf Hitler.

411
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:33,477
Guten morgen, herr Hitler.

412
00:26:33,502 --> 00:26:35,998
- Autobahn.
- Sprechen ze deutche?

413
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,903
Weiner schnitzel.

414
00:26:41,704 --> 00:26:43,333
Get in the back seat!

415
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,191
What about me, Mr. Dixon?
What about me?

416
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:48,367
You...

417
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:51,077
You...

418
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:58,177
You go disguise yourself as a tomato...

419
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,300
and infiltrate their camp.

420
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:37,445
Yes. Thank you.

421
00:27:39,384 --> 00:27:41,854
- Hi.
- Mr. Richardson to see Mr. Swann.

422
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:43,667
Yes, sir. He's expecting you.

423
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,856
I'll let him know you're here.

424
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Please have a seat.

425
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:49,967
Mr. Swann?

426
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,035
Mr. Richardson is here to see you.

427
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:56,155
He'll be right with you.

428
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,563
Jimbo, buddy!
How are ya? How you doing?

429
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:03,385
- Fine. I, uh...
- Super, super.

430
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,310
Hey, the president tells me
you have a situation, Jimbo.

431
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:09,594
Well, let me clue you:
You boys have come to the right place.

432
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:13,519
Let me give you a peek
at mind maker in action.

433
00:28:15,552 --> 00:28:18,633
First, we have to convince
the little housewife out there...

434
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,067
that the tomato which ate the family pet...

435
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,201
is not dangerous, no problem.

436
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:26,767
Then we have to convince
local authorities...

437
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:29,633
that the thousands missing
from rural communities...

438
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,937
were merely stranded during their...

439
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:34,883
bicentennial pilgrimage to Philadelphia.

440
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:36,386
No problem.

441
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:40,161
Third, the president wants us
to do this in such a way...

442
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:43,631
that it can be covered up,
and no one will know it ever happened.

443
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:45,151
That's no problem.

444
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:47,433
But then he wants us to do this...

445
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:51,069
and convince 200 million Americans...

446
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:54,500
that this disaster is actually a blessing.

447
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,300
Now, that's a challenge.

448
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,400
I understand what you're saying, Mr. Swann.

449
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:01,867
The president is a very demanding person.

450
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:04,725
Sometimes he expects the impossible.

451
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:07,688
But I don't...
I never said impossible, Richardson.

452
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:11,500
What I said was that it was a challenge.

453
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:15,700
Man was put on this earth
to meet challenges, my boy.

454
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:17,633
You really think you can do it?

455
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,533
Can I do it?

490

Well, let's go meet that
challenge, young man.

491
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:20,180
I've already put my staff to work...

492
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:22,173
so if you'd be good enough
to stop by in the morning...

493
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:25,164
we can take a look-see at some
of the preliminary sketches.

494
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:28,768
Roll it.

495
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,738
Then I can tell the president
you'll accept the assignment.

496
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:34,842
You bet your booties.

497
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:39,198
Traffic cops all over the country
meet this challenge day to day.

498
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:43,367
This man is like any other policeman
anywhere in the country.

499
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,322
He works hard and takes
pride in serving people.

500
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:48,774
Yes, he's a policeman
just like any other...

501
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,606
except for one thing: He is blind.

502
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,700
This has been a public
service announcement...

503
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:01,333
produced for the national
health foundation.

504
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:15,733
Sir, I really don't think this is
a good place to camp.

505
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,000
We're not sleeping on the sidewalk.

506
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:20,582
Do you see that big building over there?

507
00:32:20,804 --> 00:32:22,355
It's called a hotel.

508
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,022
You and I are going to sleep in the hotel.

509
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:26,916
No campfire, sir?

510
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:28,537
No campfire.

511
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:31,547
Well, then, what am I supposed to do
with these marshmallows?

512
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,874
Here's the key to my room.
I'm gonna check for messages.

513
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:00,987
- Be up in a minute.
- Yes, sir.

514
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,971
Pardon me.

515
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:16,733
Do you have any messages for
Mason Dixon in room 401?

516
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:53,900
Excuse me.

517
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,133
May I have the key to room 401?

518
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,800
I... I seem to have misplaced mine.

519
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,108
Thank you.

520
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,177
Pray-Tel records presents...

521
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:09,200
21 great dead beats.

522
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:11,533
You get the best of Jimi
Hendrix, Janis Joplin,

523
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,533
Otis Redding, Buddy Holly, Jim Croce...

524
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:20,454
It's the evening news with
Charles Collingsmith...

525
00:34:20,922 --> 00:34:22,772
Turn that thing off, will ya?

526
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:24,796
Let's get some sleep.

527
00:34:25,742 --> 00:34:27,101
Marshmallow?

528
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,938
Oh. I'm... I'm terribly sorry.

529
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:19,433
I-I mean, I thought this was my...

530
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:20,912
Really. You know.

531
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:23,031
What was that?

532
00:35:23,105 --> 00:35:25,862
- A strumpet, sir.
- A what?

533
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,700
A harlot. A trollop.
A lady of the evening.

534
00:35:29,923 --> 00:35:32,423
Go to sleep, finletter!

535
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,333
Hmm?

536
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,466
Wh-what?

537
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:04,453
Where?

538
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:07,433
I'll be right there.

539
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:14,804
- Breakfast, sir.
- No time!

540
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:17,733
- But... your vitamins.
- No time!

541
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:19,867
Now, listen.
This is important.

542
00:36:20,126 --> 00:36:21,543
You've got to go down and warn Gretta...

543
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:23,667
that there's tomato activity in sector 2.

544
00:36:23,692 --> 00:36:26,167
You got that?
No matter what happens, you tell her.

545
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,840
- Yes, sir.
- We interrupt this program...

546
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:29,733
to bring you a special bulletin.

547
00:36:29,758 --> 00:36:32,658
The following is an NBS hotline bulletin...

548
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:35,225
with Douglas Keikler in New York.

549
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,767
NBS... the network that brings you...

550
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,700
the news as it happens...

551
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:42,601
brings you these bulletins
in times of emergency...

552
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:45,338
the news you need to know
when you need to know it...

553
00:36:45,363 --> 00:36:49,667
on NBS, the network of the news.

554
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:52,333
This NBS news hotline bulletin...

555
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,033
is brought to you by Schritz Beer.

556
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:58,200
You're never too drunk to ask for Schritz.

557
00:36:58,295 --> 00:37:01,249
And by Bright Gums, the toothpaste...

558
00:37:01,274 --> 00:37:04,459
for people without teeth or dentures.

559
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:06,217
And by...

560
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,933
What is it, Spot?
What's in there?

561
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:34,967
Gosh, Billy, I don't know.

562
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,967
You stay there. I'll go look.

563
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,367
Spot? Spot?

564
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:05,067
- What are those red circles, sir?
- Machine gun emplacements.

565
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,067
We've got the whole valley
surrounded with them.

566
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,197
I don't think we can hold them
very long, though.

567
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:12,106
And that green line,
that's their furthest point of advance?

568
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:13,920
- That's right.
- Uh-huh.

569
00:38:13,945 --> 00:38:15,253
What are the blue dots?

570
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:16,903
Those are Mobil stations.

571
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:18,533
Oh.

572
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:21,900
That must be major mills.

573
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,633
- Take over.
- Yes, sir!

574
00:38:28,952 --> 00:38:30,413
I'm glad you could make it, sir.

575
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:32,195
I think we've got something
that will interest you.

576
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:33,228
So I've been told.

577
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:35,267
Dixon, I want you to see this.

578
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,490
Captain?

579
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:37,892
Yes, sir.

580
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
Sir...

581
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,200
we've captured a giant tomato.

582
00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:13,115
I'm afraid, gentlemen,
that what we have here before us...

583
00:39:14,747 --> 00:39:16,057
isn't what we thought.

584
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:17,429
You don't mean...

585
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:19,405
This...

586
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,654
may god help us...

587
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:26,139
is a cherry tomato.

588
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,165
Mr. Dixon has ordered me to inform you...

589
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,233
that there's tomato
activity in your sector.

590
00:41:31,252 --> 00:41:34,435
All right, who wants to be paper monitor?

591
00:41:39,473 --> 00:41:42,250
I'm telling you, ♪.B., it's a great idea.

592
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:45,133

Kinky crispies.

594
00:41:47,517 --> 00:41:49,749
Comes in three delicious flavours...

595
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,920
Good afternoon, Mr. Swann.

00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:55,767
I'll call you back, ♪.B.
Bye.

597

598
00:41:58,353 --> 00:42:00,267
I believe that's my question.

599
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:03,525
Right.
Fun-NY!

600
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:06,703
Well, let me tell you,
we've been going great bananas.

601
00:42:07,196 --> 00:42:09,367
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

602
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:12,583
I asked myself, what do we need?

603
00:42:12,837 --> 00:42:14,375
Something original...

604
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,349
something that strikes
at the very heart of the matter.

605
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:19,292
And here it is!

606
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:23,233
Mind maker at its best!

607
00:42:23,267 --> 00:42:25,267
Who can argue with that?

608
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:33,766
And there's more.
Listen to this.

609
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:41,200

00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,518

Pretty classy, huh?

With a capital K.

618
00:43:01,972 --> 00:43:03,907
Right.
And Mr. Secretary,

619
00:43:03,932 --> 00:43:06,249
being a public relations man yourself...

620
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:09,029
you understand the value of symbols.

621
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,766
Well, we have spent a great
deal of time and effort...

622
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:16,983
and over a million dollars to create a
symbol which will wage this battle...

623
00:43:17,076 --> 00:43:19,470
an effort that will become known as...

624
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:22,330
the stop tomato program.

625
00:43:23,445 --> 00:43:24,572
I see.

626
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,718
It all looks quite... Extraordinary.

627
00:43:27,749 --> 00:43:28,970
Thank you.

628
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,928
Now if you'll excuse me,
I think I'll be on my way.

629
00:43:31,953 --> 00:43:33,541
Just a moment. One more thing...

630
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:35,100
before you leave, Mr. Secretary.

631
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:37,021
I'd really like you to see this.

632
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:39,930
It's something I've worked
on for many years...

633
00:43:39,955 --> 00:43:43,467
the culmination of years of effort:

634
00:43:43,812 --> 00:43:46,843
The world's ultimate commercial.

635
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:48,177
Roll it.

636
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Hi.

637
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,627
Jesus Christ for Technitron.

638
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:16,433
The nation is in chaos.

639
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:19,019
Can nothing stop this tomato onslaught?

640
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:21,503
Last night,
tomatoes attacked Los Angeles...

641
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:24,433
Boston.

642
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,558
Seattle.

643
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:30,911
Chicago.

644
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:34,500
Even the mere mention of the word...

645
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:37,500
is sufficient to induce panic.

646
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:45,722
Tomato.

647
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,638
More news at the hour.

648
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,657
Now back to the rocking sound
of the boober on super 101.

649
00:45:03,682 --> 00:45:06,385
All right!
Man, that's really something, huh?

650
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:10,294
Hey, everybody, I'm gonna play something...

651
00:45:11,502 --> 00:45:12,343
That's right, man.

652
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:14,100
It's number one in the charts this week...

653
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:17,118

that the necessary information
has not been forwarded...

659

respective review and approval...

660
00:45:56,205 --> 00:45:58,333
we cannot ignore local pleas...

00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:02,167
in what is obviously an affair...

663
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,887
best suited for international actions.

664
00:46:05,353 --> 00:46:08,161
This is a question best left to people...

for whom there is no spokesman greater...

666
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:13,983
than those who speak...

667
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,300
And then I put my foot to the floor...

668
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,715
and I got out of there as fast as I could.

669
00:46:31,153 --> 00:46:32,964
It was all very strange.

670
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,421
I... I just don't know what to think.

671
00:46:34,445 --> 00:46:37,326
You made no unusual motions of any kind?

672
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:39,448
Not to my knowledge.

673
00:46:39,828 --> 00:46:40,828
Odd.

674
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:44,217
Were there any loud noises
or other extraneous activity...

675
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:47,601
which might have affected the
tomatoes' behavior, such as...

676
00:46:47,814 --> 00:46:50,499
an airplane or another car in the vicinity?

677
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:52,367
I'm almost sure there wasn't.

678
00:46:52,932 --> 00:46:54,467
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen...

679
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,404
I really have to be
getting back to Washington.

680
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:58,589
That's fine.
Give my regards to the president.

681
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:01,480
- I'll do that, captain.
- It's major.

682
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:02,944
Of course.

683
00:47:03,728 --> 00:47:06,438
Priority-one message for Mr. Dixon, sir.

684
00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:10,233
- A phone call for you.
- Oh, thank you.

685
00:47:10,258 --> 00:47:12,453
I'll need one of those for my records too.

686
00:47:12,653 --> 00:47:14,288
I'll need one for my files.

687
00:47:14,313 --> 00:47:16,280
And don't forget the major.

688
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:54,342
- Yeah?
- Trouble, sir.

689
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,927
- Hello?
- Trouble, sir.

690
00:47:55,952 --> 00:47:56,952
What?

691
00:47:57,111 --> 00:47:59,411
I haven't seen Dixon all day.

692
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:02,577
I've been following his assistant,
but that's getting me nowhere.

693
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:04,985
- Followed? By who?
- Following who?

694
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:06,867
- His assistant.
- A spy.

695
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,733
- A spy?
- That's right.

696
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:09,933
Well, what's he look like?

697
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:11,706
Medium height, medium build.

698
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:12,768
It's a she, sir.

699
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:14,759
You know, the strumpet last night.

00:48:14,813 --> 00:48:16,850

00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:20,200
- Sunglasses...
- Combat boots...

703
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,767
- And a dress.
- Nothing suspicious about that.

704
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,627
- You can't be serious.
- What shall I do?

705
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:29,067
Look, I thought I made it perfectly clear.

706
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:31,895
I don't think you've made
use of all your potential...

707
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,900
if you know what I mean.

708
00:48:32,933 --> 00:48:35,000
Look, you're obviously tired.

709
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:36,800
Why don't you go take a nap?

710
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:40,000
- You mean, go to bed?
- I couldn't do that!

711
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:43,033
- Why not? You're a woman.
- I resent that.

712
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:45,400
I didn't say that you were incompetent.

713
00:48:45,424 --> 00:48:48,117
I just think you could use a rest.

714
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,631
Yes, sir. But I...

715
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:54,133
Well, I'll do my best, sir.

716
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:56,700
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

717
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,733
Goodbye.

718
00:49:02,128 --> 00:49:03,128
Operator?

719
00:49:03,656 --> 00:49:04,992
Operator, I, uh...

720
00:49:05,017 --> 00:49:08,172
I've gotten a wrong number.
I'd like my dime back.

721
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,267
Hi, there.

722
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:27,819
- Hello.
- Listen, about last night.

723
00:49:27,844 --> 00:49:30,951
It was an accident.
I really didn't mean...

724
00:49:31,157 --> 00:49:32,967
It was a dark night. I mean...

725
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,933
the lights were off, and it got dark.

726
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:38,196
I mean, it was dark...

727
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,483
and it was light earlier.

728
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:41,843
You want to go to bed?

729
00:49:42,464 --> 00:49:44,067
Uh, excuse me, ma'am?

730
00:49:44,162 --> 00:49:46,233
- Uh...
- I've got to go to bed.

731
00:50:44,582 --> 00:50:47,267
I don't think you've made use
of all your potential...

732
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,185
if you know what I mean.

733
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:51,077
All your potential.
Potential. Potential. Potential.

734
00:51:18,874 --> 00:51:19,933
I, uh...

735
00:51:23,198 --> 00:51:25,340
I was right.
I was right!

736
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,325
A spy!

737
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:18,516
Did you warn Gretta?

738
00:52:18,899 --> 00:52:22,933
Uh, yes, sir,
but she was already dead.

739
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,658
It figures.

740
00:52:57,296 --> 00:52:59,896
Attention. Attention.

741
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,200
The 56th combat support group...

742
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:04,158
will depart at 0900 hours.

743
00:53:04,286 --> 00:53:08,419
All 3rd division personnel report to
the 5th division staging area.

744
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,646
All 5th division personnel report to...

745
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:12,705
the 3rd division staging area.

746
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,624
Will the driver of tank 38421...

747
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,587
please go to the parking lot?

748
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,512
Your lights are on.

749
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,374
Had a few setbacks during the night.

750
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,399
Serious?

751
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:28,930
Well, it depends on your point of view.

752
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:30,967
Did you have any relatives in Wyoming?

753
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,292
Say again?

754
00:53:33,017 --> 00:53:34,917
Arkansas? Are you sure?

755
00:53:37,653 --> 00:53:39,186
Arkansas.

756
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:43,053
What's the situation?

757
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:47,943
Prime intelligence tells us...

758
00:53:48,014 --> 00:53:49,674
that the tomatoes are
amassing for a final...

759
00:53:49,698 --> 00:53:51,220
all-out attack on the nation.

760
00:53:51,555 --> 00:53:52,774
Our top brass...

761
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:55,279
wants us to concentrate our forces here
on the coast.

762
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,658
If we can hold them here, we can win.

763
00:53:58,161 --> 00:53:59,026
If not...

764
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:00,411
Is there anything I can do, major?

765
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:02,834
Yes. The President wants
your personal report.

766
00:54:02,908 --> 00:54:05,508
Call him on the red line at 1100 hours.

767
00:54:05,652 --> 00:54:06,925
Be back here tonight.

768
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:09,257
We'll need every man we can get.

769
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:11,404
Damn it, Dixon, this is war!

770
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:12,618
Very good, sir.

771
00:54:21,245 --> 00:54:21,990
Sir, I...

772
00:54:22,015 --> 00:54:23,415
I think somebody's shooting at you.

773
00:54:23,571 --> 00:54:25,216
Where do you think...

774
00:56:09,943 --> 00:56:11,443
So you can see, Mr. Dixon...

775
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:14,174
we have no choice but to make
our stand out west.

776
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:15,699
And I want you to make sure...

777
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,821
that our military people out there...

778
00:56:17,846 --> 00:56:19,608
in that region understand and are aware...

779
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:21,635
of their enormous responsibility.

780
00:56:21,933 --> 00:56:23,733
I'm sure they are, Mr. President.

781
00:56:24,004 --> 00:56:26,540
By the way, have you seen Jim Richardson
out there?

782
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:29,422
Just briefly.
How's the ad campaign going?

783
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:31,377
Excellent. My mail's running...

784
00:56:31,402 --> 00:56:33,562
30 to 1 in favour of the tomatoes.

785
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:35,413
Terrific.

786
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:37,677
Oh, God, I almost forgot.

787
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:39,845
- Shirley?
- Yes, sir?

788
00:56:40,149 --> 00:56:42,325
I want you to get general
Mitchell on the line.

789
00:56:42,367 --> 00:56:44,648
Tell him to bomb New York City.

790
00:56:45,127 --> 00:56:46,349
But, Mr. President...

791
00:56:46,374 --> 00:56:49,074
the tomatoes are not even
close to New York City.

792
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,246
Listen, you worry about your problems...

793
00:56:51,271 --> 00:56:52,595
and I'll worry about mine.

794
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,164
Yes, sir.

795
00:57:00,672 --> 00:57:02,438
- Is that the last pen?
- Yes, sir.

796
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,319
Thank god.

797
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:19,069
Hey, will somebody please pass the ketchup?

798
00:57:29,253 --> 00:57:30,787
As you were.

799
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:32,379
Order, arms.

800
00:57:36,685 --> 00:57:38,106
The men look ready, major.

801
00:57:38,242 --> 00:57:40,076
As ready as they'll ever be, Dixon.

802
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,386
You know, Dixon...

803
00:57:43,411 --> 00:57:45,977
a man stops to think at a time like this...

804
00:57:46,115 --> 00:57:47,363
about his home...

805
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:50,468
his wife, his kids.

806
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,300
- You married, major?
- No.

807
00:57:53,567 --> 00:57:54,567
Me either.

808
00:57:55,816 --> 00:57:59,267

the tomatoes continue on their rampage...

840
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:38,172
of wanton destruction...

841
01:01:38,406 --> 01:01:39,537
Burning.

842
01:01:40,147 --> 01:01:41,385
Pillaging.

843
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:43,794
Raping.

844
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,763
Let's shoot it from over there, huh, Bill?

845
01:02:00,911 --> 01:02:02,093
Come on over here, lady.

846
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,798
Stand by over here for just a minute, huh?

847
01:02:03,941 --> 01:02:05,355
Okay, don't go away.

848
01:02:06,326 --> 01:02:08,483
We start with a tight shot, huh, Bill?

849
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:10,207
Tell me when you're ready.

850
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:11,610
Don't run off.

851
01:02:15,718 --> 01:02:18,669
Across this great nation,
almost everyone has been affected...

852
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:21,131
in one way or another by this
terrible tomato onslaught.

853
01:02:21,156 --> 01:02:23,342
Mrs. Williams,
I understand your husband is missing.

854
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:24,638
- Yes, he is.
- Do you think he's dead?

855
01:02:24,662 --> 01:02:25,942
- Well, I...
- Will you miss him?

856
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:27,617
Will you marry again?

857
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,643
What if he's laying in a ditch somewhere...

858
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,567
with both legs broken, calling your name?

859
01:02:31,592 --> 01:02:32,107
Stop!

860
01:02:32,132 --> 01:02:34,307
You will have to find another
man, you know.

861
01:02:34,332 --> 01:02:35,575
You're no spring chicken.

862
01:02:35,831 --> 01:02:37,698
What are you going to do, Mrs. Williams?

863
01:02:38,678 --> 01:02:40,233
Can you answer my quest...

864
01:02:40,488 --> 01:02:42,086
Please look into the camera.

865
01:02:42,111 --> 01:02:43,530
Get away from me!

866
01:02:45,653 --> 01:02:48,120
Last night's crushing military defeat

867
01:02:48,145 --> 01:02:50,300
may spell the end for humanity.

868
01:02:50,595 --> 01:02:53,665
The shattered remnants
of a once-proud civilization...

869
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:57,361
lay scattered amongst crushed
spirits and broken bodies.

870
01:02:57,544 --> 01:03:00,828
Lawlessness is rampant,
panic stalks the streets,

871
01:03:01,025 --> 01:03:02,540
and personal grooming habits...

872
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:04,967
have reached an all-time low.

873
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:38,867
I'll tell you now what's coming up...

874
01:04:38,892 --> 01:04:41,841
It's the song that's sweeping the country,
number one all over...

875
01:04:41,866 --> 01:04:45,078
from the west coast to the east coast,
every coast in between...

876
01:04:45,103 --> 01:04:45,766
Yeah, that's right.

877
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:47,657
You've been asking for it,
you've been waiting for it.

878
01:04:47,681 --> 01:04:51,315
Here it is, boys and gals,
it's Ronny Desmond's Puberty Love!

879
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:54,438

Get out of the car!
Hurry up, move!

884

Hey!

885
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:02,333
- Sir? Sir?
- What?

886
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:05,337
- Sir! Sir!
- I'm driving!

887
01:07:10,367 --> 01:07:12,667
There's something wrong with the car!

888
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,405
We'll get them, Finletter!

889
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:18,396
- We can catch it, sir!
- Don't worry!

890
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:53,875
Freeze!

891
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,859
Good afternoon, Mr. Dixon.

892
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:16,859
Had a pleasant nap?

893
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:20,481
Richardson. I'm not surprised.

894
01:08:21,675 --> 01:08:22,600
Mr. Dixon...

895
01:08:22,633 --> 01:08:24,908
I didn't really think you would be.

896
01:08:25,467 --> 01:08:27,035
That's why you're here.

897
01:08:27,752 --> 01:08:29,367
What do you intend to do with me?

898
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,993
Mr. Dixon, don't be so naive.

899
01:08:32,353 --> 01:08:35,861
You are the only one with the knowledge
that can stop me.

900
01:08:36,397 --> 01:08:38,343
Don't be a fool, Richardson.
You don't have a chance.

901
01:08:38,367 --> 01:08:40,932
You know very well I do.

902
01:08:42,403 --> 01:08:43,403
You know...

903
01:08:44,786 --> 01:08:46,738
It's funny, Dixon.

904
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:52,632
No man sits closer to power...

905
01:08:52,657 --> 01:08:56,444
than the Press Secretary to the President
of the United States.

906
01:08:58,098 --> 01:09:00,131
And yet as close as it is...

907
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,244
that power is never
really within your grasp.

908
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:06,738
It dangles before you...

909
01:09:07,112 --> 01:09:09,397
taunting, daring...

910
01:09:10,048 --> 01:09:11,702
mocking your very impotence.

911
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:14,627
I will not be mocked anymore!

912
01:09:15,173 --> 01:09:16,886
I will no longer give...

913
01:09:17,179 --> 01:09:20,717
other people's answers to
other people's questions.

914
01:09:21,723 --> 01:09:23,754
The answers will be mine.

915
01:09:24,403 --> 01:09:26,726
The questions will be mine.

916
01:09:27,762 --> 01:09:29,969
Everything will be mine.

917
01:09:31,271 --> 01:09:33,759
It'll be glorious, Dixon.

918
01:09:34,006 --> 01:09:36,673
It's too bad you won't be around to see it.

919
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,145
What makes you think that you can...

920
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:42,744
control these tomatoes
better than anyone else?

921
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,467
Questions, questions.

922
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,206
You missed your calling.

923
01:09:49,006 --> 01:09:52,530
Mr. Dixon, have you had lunch yet?

924
01:09:53,434 --> 01:09:56,122
Here. Have a tomato.

925
01:09:57,384 --> 01:09:58,767
Don't be afraid.

926
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,767
It's really quite small and quite harmless.

927
01:10:02,601 --> 01:10:04,112
It's from my garden.

928
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:08,985
You might say that I'm...

929
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,700
In tune with my tomatoes.

930
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:19,305
At the proper time...

931
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:24,167
when all vestiges of
authority have disappeared...

932
01:10:24,326 --> 01:10:26,733
I shall charge in on my white stallion...

933
01:10:26,767 --> 01:10:28,380
and save the nation...

934
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:30,459
or what's left of it.

935
01:10:31,471 --> 01:10:34,939
My fellow citizens will
be eternally grateful.

936
01:10:35,452 --> 01:10:37,600
At the very least, they'll surely choose...

937
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,700
my benevolent leadership...

938
01:10:39,733 --> 01:10:42,500
over the obvious alternative.

939
01:10:44,812 --> 01:10:47,279
It shall be my Golden moment.

940
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,257
But, Mr. Dixon...

941
01:10:53,575 --> 01:10:56,333
I'm afraid these are your final moments.

942
01:10:56,967 --> 01:10:59,636
You're awfully confident for a man
who has failed twice.

943
01:11:00,287 --> 01:11:03,467
Three times, but who's counting?

944
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,640
I don't think you can do it.

945
01:11:06,488 --> 01:11:08,833
You know, Dixon, you may be right.

946
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:11,748
I've never killed a man before.

947
01:11:12,544 --> 01:11:14,610
You may be right.

948
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:19,900
Who's there?

949
01:11:19,933 --> 01:11:22,228
U.♪.S. package for you.

950
01:11:25,747 --> 01:11:27,314
Come in.

951
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,606
Then again...

952
01:11:42,577 --> 01:11:45,410
- you may be wrong.
- Wait.

953
01:11:47,228 --> 01:11:48,873
Before you pull that trigger...

954
01:11:49,813 --> 01:11:51,267
tell me how you do it.

955
01:11:51,836 --> 01:11:52,967
Really.

956
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,080
How melodramatic.

957
01:11:57,393 --> 01:12:00,253
Very well. It's really quite simple.

958
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:02,705
You see, all I do is...

959
01:12:11,174 --> 01:12:12,824
A real bad apple, sir.

960
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:15,086
It's a good thing we got him.

961
01:12:44,521 --> 01:12:46,587
Finletter!
Finletter!

962
01:12:47,055 --> 01:12:49,451
We've got to round up everybody
in the city. You got that?

963
01:12:49,476 --> 01:12:51,819
And meet me in the stadium.
There's no time to lose.

964
01:12:51,844 --> 01:12:53,767
But, sir, everybody's left town.

965
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,277
The only people left will be crazy people.

966
01:12:55,301 --> 01:12:57,868
I don't care!
Just do it! Move!

967
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:59,190
Sir...

968
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:22,494
Then it's unanimously agreed...

969
01:13:22,519 --> 01:13:24,300
that the committee recommend...

970
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:27,167
that no further action
will be taken at this time.

971
01:14:24,217 --> 01:14:25,704
I've got it!

972
01:14:27,123 --> 01:14:29,357
I've got it!

973
01:14:38,821 --> 01:14:41,123
Hey, guys, look! They're starting to come!

974
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:42,346
They're coming!

975
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:16,733
Turn on the record player!

976
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,586
