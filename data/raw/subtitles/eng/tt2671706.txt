1
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,536
Troy, you ought to
stop that lying.

2
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,959
I ain't lying.

3
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,758
Nigger had a watermelon this big,

4
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,717
talking about,
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

5
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,473
I'd like to fell out.
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,352
And it sitti ng there, big as life.

7
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,556
- What Mr. Rand say?
- He ain't said nothing.

8
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,296
He figure, if the nigger was too dumb
to know he's carrying a watermelon,

9
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,117
he wasn't going to get
much sense out of him.

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,998
Trying to hide that great, big,
old watermelon under his coat.

11
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,594
Afraid to let the white man
see him carry it home.

12
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,474
I'm like you.
I ain't got no time for them kinda people.

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,073
Now, what he look like getting mad

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,216
'cause he seen the man from the union
talking to Mr. Rand?

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,471
He come up to me, talking about
"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,755
I told him, "Get away from me with that."

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,308
He walked away from me
calling you a troublemaker.

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,352
What Mr. Rand say?

19
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,112
He ain't said nothing.
Told me to go down

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,040
to the Commissioner's office
next Friday. Whoa!

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,776
They called me down there to see them.

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,030
Well, as long as
you got your complaint filed,

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,189
they can't fire you.

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,696
That's what one of them
white fellas tell me.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,976
I ain't worried about them firing me.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,275
What, they gonna fire me
'cause I asked a question?

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,429
That's all I did.

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,596
I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
I asked him, "Why?

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,016
"Why you got all the white mens
driving, and the colored lifting?"

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,951
Told him, "What's the matter?
Don't I count?

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,096
"Think only white fellows
got sense enough to drive a truck?"

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,401
"Hell, that ain't no paper job.
Anybody can drive a truck.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,080
"How come you got all the whites driving
and the colored lifting?"

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,776
He told me, "Take it to the union."

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,074
Well, hell, that's what I done.

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,310
Now they want to come up
with this pack of lies.

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,834
I told Brownie if the man
come and ask him any questions,

39
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,234
just tell the truth.

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,136
Ain't nothing but somebody
trumped it up on you

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,336
'cause you filed a complaint on.

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,696
Brownie ain't got that much sense.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,976
Man wasn't thinking about nothing.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,896
All I want them to do
is change the job description,

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,115
give everybody a chance
to drive the truck. Oi!

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,233
Brownie can't see that.
He ain't got that much sense.

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,719
How you figure he be making out

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,234
with that gal,
be up in Taylors' all the time?

49
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,038
- That Alberta gal?
- Who?

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,439
Brownie.

51
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,909
Same as you and me,
getting about as much as we is.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,468
- Which is to say nothing.
- It is, huh?

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,074
Well, I figure
you doing a little better than me.

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,718
And I ain't saying what I'm doing!

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,677
Nigger, look here. I know you.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,716
If you had gotten anywhere
near that gal,

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,030
20 minutes later,
you'd be looking to tell somebody.

58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,576
And the first one you gonna want to tell,

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,556
that you gonna want to brag to
is going to be me.

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,755
Oh, I ain't saying that.

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,156
I see where you be eyeing her.

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,629
I eye all the women.
I don't miss nothing.

63
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,976
Don't never let nobody tell you
Troy Maxson don't eye the women.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,376
Hey, you been doing
more than eyeing her.

65
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,656
You done bought her a drink or two.

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,056
Hell, yeah,
I bought her a drink. What that mean?

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,336
I bought you one, too.

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,998
What that mean,
'cause I buy her a drink?

69
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,155
I'm just being polite.

70
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,536
It's all right to buy her one drink.

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,278
That's what you call being polite.

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,080
But when you want to be
buying two or three,

73
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,559
that's what you call eyeing her.

74
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,312
Look here. As long as you've known me,

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,277
you ever known me
to chase after women?

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,635
Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.

77
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,136
You're forgetting, I knew you when.

78
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,151
I'm talking about
since I been married to Rose.

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,390
Oh... Not since you
been married to Rose.

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,056
That's the truth, though.
I can say that.

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,672
All right then. Case closed.

82
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,039
I see you be walking up
around Alberta's house.

83
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,918
You supposed to be at Taylors',
and you be walking up around there.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,136
What you watching
where I'm walking for?

85
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
I don't be watching after you.

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,376
No, I seen you
walking around there more than once.

87
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,816
Hell, you liable
to see me walking anywhere.

88
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,856
That don't mean nothing 'cause
you seen me walking around there.

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,176
Where'd she
come from, anyway?

90
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,496
She just kinda showed up one day.

91
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,830
Tallahassee. You can look at that
and tell she one of them Florida gals.

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,150
They got some big,
healthy women down there.

93
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,071
Grow them right up out of the ground.

94
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,718
She got a little bit of Indian in her.

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,736
Most of them niggers in Florida
got some Indian in them.

96
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,796
Yeah, I don't know
about that Indian part,

97
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,838
but she damn sure big and healthy.

98
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,956
Woman wears some big stockings.

99
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,192
Got them crazy big legs,
and hips wide as the Mississippi River.

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,759
Legs don't mean nothing.

101
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,536
You don't do nothing
but push 'em out of the way.

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,118
But them hips,

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,158
- they cushion the ride.
- Troy, you ain't got no sense!

104
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,232
It's the truth.
Like you riding on Goodyears!

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,356
What you all out here getting into?

106
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,715
What you worried about
what we getting into for, woman?

107
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,835
This is men talk.

108
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,296
What I care
what you all are talking about?

109
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,673
Bono, you gonna stay for supper?

110
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,079
No, thank you, Rose,

111
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,435
but Lucille say
she cooking up a pot of pigfeet.

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,556
Pigfeet? Hell, I'm going home with you.

113
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,995
I might even stay the night,
you got some pigfeet.

114
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,936
You got something in there
to top them pigfeet, Rose?

115
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,256
I'm cooking up some chicken.
I got some chicken and collard greens.

116
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,536
Well, you go on back in the house.

117
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,936
Let me and Bono
finish what we talking about.

118
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,679
This is men talk.
I got some talk for you later.

119
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,751
And you know
what kind of talk I mean, too.

120
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,319
You go on in there and powder it up.

121
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,799
Troy, stop it!

122
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,673
Oh, woman, come here.

123
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,151
Oh! Look here, Bono.

124
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,674
When I first met this woman,

125
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,557
I got out that place.

126
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,598
Hitch up my pony
Saddle up my mare

127
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,319
There's a woman out there
for me somewhere

128
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,233
I looked at here, looked at there,
saw Rose, and I latched on to her.

129
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,277
I latched on to her and I told her...

130
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,793
Now, I'm gonna tell you the truth.

131
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,358
I latched on to her and told her,
"Baby, I don't want to marry.

132
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,078
"I just want to be your man."

133
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,594
Rose told me...
Tell him what you told me, Ro.

134
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,517
I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,

135
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,896
then move out of the way,
so the marrying kind could find me.

136
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,354
That's what she told me,
"Nigger, you in my way.

137
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,759
"You blocking the view.

138
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,796
"Move out the way,
so I can find me a husband."

139
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,314
- I thought it over 2-3 days.
- Two-three days, nothing.

140
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,873
You was back the same night.

141
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,110
I come back, told her, "Okay, baby,

142
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,997
"but I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster

143
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,718
"and put him out there in the backyard.

144
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,233
"And when he see a stranger come,

145
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,720
"he gonna flap his wings and crow."

146
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,936
Look here, Bono.
I done watched that front door by myself.

147
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,713
It was that
back door I was worried about.

148
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,234
Don't talk like that!
Troy, you're not but telling a lie.

149
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,633
Only thing was, we first got married,
forget the rooster. We ain't had no yard.

150
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,869
I hear you tell it.

151
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,349
Me and Lucille was staying
down there on Logan Street.

152
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,908
Had two rooms
with the outhouse in the back.

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,592
I ain't mind the outhouse none.

154
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,188
But when that goddamn
wind blew through there in the winter,

155
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,998
that's what I'm talking about!

156
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,680
To this day, I wonder why the hell

157
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,194
I ever stayed down there
for six long years.

158
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,040
But, see, I didn't know
I could do no better.

159
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,559
I thought only white folks
had inside toilets and things.

160
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,834
A lot of folks don't think

161
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,536
they can do no better
than they're doing now.

162
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,677
Just something you gotta learn.
A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.

163
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,416
Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's.
She got fresh food.

164
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,336
I ain't said nothing about
if she got fresh food.

165
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,720
I'm talking about what she charge.

166
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,637
She charges 10 cents
more than the A&P.

167
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,278
A&P ain't never done nothing for me.

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,191
I spend my money
where I'm treated right.

169
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,599
I go down to Bella, say,

170
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,176
"I need a loaf of bread,
I'll pay you Friday," she gives it to me.

171
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,031
What sense that make
when I got money

172
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,439
to spend it somewhere else

173
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,176
and ignore the person
who done right by me?

174
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,235
That ain't in the Bible.

175
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,696
We ain't talking about
what's in the Bible.

176
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,870
What sense it make to shop there
when she overcharges?

177
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,536
Well, you do your shopping
where you want to,

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,136
I do my shopping
where people been good to me.

179
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,176
Oh, I don't think it's right for
her to overcharge, that's all.

180
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,456
Look here, I got to be getting on.

181
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,976
Lucille gonna be raising all kind of hell.

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,616
Where you going, nigger?
We ain't finished this pint.

183
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,755
Come here finish this pint.

184
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,480
Well, hell, I am,
if you ever turn the bottle loose.

185
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,237
Only thing I'll say about the A&P is,
I'm glad Cory got that job down there.

186
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,176
Help him with
his school clothes and things.

187
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,509
Gabe done moved out,
things getting tight around here.

188
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,828
He got that job,

189
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,478
he can start to look out for himself.

190
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,791
Cory done got recruited
by a college football team.

191
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,037
I told that boy about
that college football stuff.

192
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,918
The white man ain't gonna
let him get nowhere with that football.

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,991
I told him
when he first come to me with it.

194
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,674
Now, you come telling me
he done got more tied up in it.

195
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,830
He ought to get recruited
in how to fix cars,

196
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,216
or some way he can make a living.

197
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,629
He ain't talking about
making no living playing football.

198
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,711
It's just something
the boys in school do.

199
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,976
They're gonna send a recruiter by
to talk to you. He'll tell you.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,056
He ain't talking about
making no living playing football.

201
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,593
It's an honor to be recruited.

202
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,114
It ain't gonna get him nowhere,
Bono'll tell you that.

203
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,477
If he be like you in sports,
he gonna be all right.

204
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,028
Ain't but two men
ever played baseball good as you.

205
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,196
That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.

206
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,440
Them the only two men ever
hit more home runs than you.

207
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,795
And what it ever get me?
I ain't got a pot to piss in,

208
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,194
or a window to throw it out of.

209
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,096
Times have changed since
you were playing baseball, Troy.

210
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,216
That was before the war.
Times have changed a lot since then.

211
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,376
How the hell they done changed?

212
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,976
They got a lot of colored boys
playing ball now.

213
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,353
Baseball and football.

214
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,477
You right about that, Ro.
Times have changed, Troy.

215
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,913
You just come along too early.

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,675
There ought not never
have been no time called "too early."

217
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,430
Now you take that fellow...

218
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,256
What's that fellow they had playing
right field back then for the Yankees?

219
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,416
You remember
who I'm talking about, Bono,

220
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,456
played right field for The Yankees.

221
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,118
- Selkirk?
- Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!

222
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,550
Man's batting 269,
you understand? 269!

223
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,349
What sense that make?
I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!

224
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,432
He's batting 269,
playing right field for the Yankees!

225
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,636
I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.

226
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,393
She's running around
with raggedy shoes on her feet.

227
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,096
I bet you
Selkirk's daughter ain't running around

228
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,976
with no raggedy shoes on her feet.
I bet you that.

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,840
They got a lot of
colored baseball players now.

230
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
Jackie Robinson was the first.

231
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,680
Folks had to wait for Jackie Robinson.

232
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,917
I done seen 100 niggers play baseball
better than Jackie Robinson.

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,912
Hell, I seen some teams
Jackie Robinson couldn't even make!

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,336
What you talking about,
Jackie Robinson?

235
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,032
Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!

236
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,976
I'm talking about if you could play ball,
then they ought to let you play.

237
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,256
Don't matter what color you are.

238
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,918
Telling me I come along too early.

239
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,276
If you can play,
then they ought to let you play.

240
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
You gonna drink yourself to death.

241
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,716
You don't need to be drinking like that.

242
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,758
Oh! Death ain't nothing.
I done seen him,

243
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,216
I done wrestled with him.
You can't tell me nothing about death.

244
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,516
Death ain't nothing
but a fastball on the outside corner,

245
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,477
and you know what I do with that.

246
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,437
Look here, Bono, am I lying?

247
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,353
You get one of them fastballs
about waist high

248
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,032
on the outside corner of the plate

249
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,840
where you can get
the meat of the bat on it,

250
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,151
and, good God,
you could kiss it good-bye.

251
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,196
- Am I lying?
- No, you telling the truth.

252
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,793
I seen you do it.

253
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,000
If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth of lying.
That's all death is to me.

254
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,514
A fastball on the outside corner.

255
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,909
I don't know why you want to
get on talking about death?

256
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,376
Ain't nothing wrong
with talking about death.

257
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,118
That's a part of life!
Everybody gonna die.

258
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,514
You gonna die. I'm gonna die.

259
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,397
Bono gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.

260
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,896
But you ain't got to talk about it.
I don't like talking about it.

261
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,176
Well, you the one brought it up.

262
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,758
Me and Bono talking about baseball.

263
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,856
You come telling me
I'm gonna drink myself to death.

264
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,154
Ain't that right, Bono?

265
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,470
Now you know I drink just
but one night out the week,

266
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,709
that's Friday night.

267
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,576
I drink just enough
to where I can handle it.

268
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,176
Then I leaves it alone. I cuts it loose.

269
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,336
So, you ain't got to worry
about me drinking myself to death

270
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,918
'cause I ain't worrying about death.

271
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,673
I done seen him,
done wrestled with him.

272
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,034
Look here, Bono.

273
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,271
I look up one day,
and Death is marching straight at me,

274
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,476
like soldiers on parade.

275
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,915
The Army of Death
was marching straight at me.

276
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,356
It was the middle of July, 1941.

277
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,670
And it got real cold,
just like it be winter.

278
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,352
And it seemed like Death, himself,

279
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,476
reached out
and touched me on the shoulder.

280
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,836
He touched me like I touch you now.
I got cold as ice.

281
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,256
Death standing there, grinning at me.

282
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,998
Troy, why don't you hush that talk.

283
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,356
I said, "What you want, Mr. Death?
You be wanting me?

284
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,317
"You done sent your army
to be getting me?"

285
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,416
I looked him dead in the eye.

286
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,509
I wasn't fearing nothing.

287
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,273
I was ready to tangle,
just like I'm ready to tangle now!

288
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,517
Bible says be ever vigilant.

289
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,909
So, I don't get but so drunk.
I got to keep watch.

290
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,656
Troy was right down there
at Mercy Hospital.

291
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,080
You remember he had that pneumonia,

292
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,096
laying there with a fever,
talking plumb out his head.

293
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,496
And Death standing there,
staring at me,

294
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,919
carrying that sickle in his hand.

295
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,757
Finally, he say, "You want to be
bound over for another year?"

296
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,990
Just like that. He say,

297
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,868
"You want to be bound over
for another year?"

298
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,953
I said, "Bound over, hell!
We can settle this right now."

299
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,470
He kinda fell back when I said that.
And all the cold went out of me.

300
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,551
I reached down, I grabbed that sickle.

301
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,432
I threw it as far as I could throw it,

302
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,192
and me and him
commenced to wrestling.

303
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,795
We wrestled for... Carry the six...
Three days and three nights!

304
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,189
Now, I don't know
where I got the strength from,

305
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,056
'cause every time
he tried to get the best of me,

306
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,198
I reached way deep down inside myself,
found the strength to do him one better.

307
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,872
Every time Troy tells that story,

308
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,256
he find different ways to tell it,

309
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,816
different things to make up.

310
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,239
I ain't making up nothing, woman.

311
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,936
I'm telling you
the facts of what happened.

312
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,235
I wrestled with Death
for three days and three nights,

313
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,794
and I'm standing here
to tell you about it.

314
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,156
All right. At the end of the third night,

315
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,312
we done weakened each other
to where we can't even hardly move.

316
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Death stood up.

317
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,761
He threw on that robe,
had a white robe with a hood on it.

318
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,136
He throwed on that robe
and went off to look for that sickle.

319
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,835
He said, "I'll be back."
Just like that. "I'll be back."

320
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,037
I said, "Yeah?
Well, you gonna have to find me!"

321
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,235
I wasn't no fool.

322
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,119
I wasn't going looking for him.

323
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,816
I know Death ain't nothing to play with.
And I know he's gonna get me.

324
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,877
I know I got to join his army,
his camp followers.

325
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,838
But as long as I keep up my strength
and see him coming,

326
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,275
as long as I keep up my vigilance,

327
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,799
he gonna have to fight to get me.

328
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,154
I ain't going easy.

329
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,235
Well, look here,
since you got to keep up your vigilance,

330
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,231
- let me have the bottle.
- Oh!

331
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,816
Hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.

332
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,016
I should have left out that part.

333
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,519
Troy be talking all that stuff.

334
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,955
Half the time, he don't even know
what he be talking about!

335
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,096
- Yeah, Bono know me better than that.
- That's right, I know you.

336
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,317
I know you got some
Uncle Remus in your blood.

337
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,675
You got more stories
than the devil got sinners.

338
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,354
Oh, hell, I done seen him, too.
Done talked to the devil.

339
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,160
Nobody wants to be
hearing that stuff!

340
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,154
Hey, Pop.

341
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,753
What you come "Hey, Poppin"' me for?

342
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,910
How you doing, Rose?

343
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,514
Mr. Bono, how you doing?

344
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,272
Hey, Lyons, how you been?

345
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,793
He must've been doing all right.

346
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,096
I ain't seen him around here last week.

347
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,816
Troy, leave your boy alone.
He come by to see you

348
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,416
and you want to start all that nonsense.

349
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,816
I ain't bothering Lyons.
Here, get you a drink.

350
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,319
Me and him got an understanding.

351
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,551
I know why he come by to see me,
and he know I know.

352
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,517
Come on, Pop.
I just stopped by to say hi,

353
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,669
see how you was doing.

354
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,816
- You ain't stopped by yesterday.
- You staying for supper, Lyons?

355
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,136
I got some chicken cooking in the oven.

356
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,016
No, Rose, thanks.
I just was in the neighborhood

357
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,496
and thought I'd stop by for a minute.

358
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,056
Yeah, you was
in the neighborhood all right.

359
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,416
Nigger, you telling the truth there.

360
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,256
You was in the neighborhood
'cause it's my payday.

361
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,510
Well, hell, since you mentioned it,
let me have $10.

362
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,355
I'll be damned.
I'll die and go to hell

363
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,908
and play blackjack with the devil
before I give you $10.

364
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,878
That's what I want to know about,
that devil you done seen.

365
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,110
Pop done seen the devil?
You too much, Pop.

366
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,430
- Yeah, I done seen him.
- He ain't seen no devil.

367
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,696
I told him that man
ain't had nothing to do with the devil.

368
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,856
Anything he can't understand,
he want to call it the devil.

369
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,077
Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's
to get some furniture.

370
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,958
You got three rooms for $298.
That what it say on the radio.

371
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,396
"Three rooms, $298."
He made up a little song about it.

372
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,472
I get down there,
man tell me I can't get no credit.

373
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,790
I'm working every day,
can't get no credit.

374
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,995
What to do?

375
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,896
I got an empty house
with some raggedy furniture.

376
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,035
Cory ain't got no bed.

377
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,236
He's sleeping on a pile of rags
on the floor.

378
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,356
Working every day, can't get no credit.

379
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,840
I come back here, Rose'll tell you,

380
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,880
madder than hell,
trying to figure out what to do.

381
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,235
Come a knock on the door.

382
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,440
I ain't been living but three days,
who know I'm here?

383
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,596
I open the door.
Devil standing there.

384
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,715
Bigger than life.

385
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,680
White fella,
got on good clothes and everything.

386
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,976
Standing there
with a clipboard in his hand.

387
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
Now, I ain't got to say nothing.

388
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,833
First words come out of his mouth,

389
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,753
"I understand you need some furniture
and can't get no credit."

390
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,310
I liked to fell over. He said,
"I'll give you all the credit you want,

391
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,391
"but you gonna have to pay
the interest on it."

392
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,976
Now, I told him,
he give me them three rooms,

393
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,479
he can charge whatever he want.

394
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,198
Next day, a truck pull up here,

395
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,918
two men unload them three rooms.

396
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,235
Man what drove the truck
give me a book.

397
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,756
Said first of the month,
send $10 to the address in the book,

398
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,949
everything'll be fine.

399
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,519
Said if you miss a payment,

400
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,273
the devil was coming back,
and there'll be hell to pay.

401
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,873
That was 15 years ago.

402
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,475
To this day, first day of every month,
I send my $10,

403
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,016
just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.

404
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,393
Troy lying.

405
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,936
I ain't never seen that man since.

406
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,896
Now, you tell me,
who else that gonna be but the devil?

407
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,990
And I ain't sold my soul
or nothing like that.

408
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,799
No, I wouldn't have truck with the
devil over nothing like that.

409
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,475
But I got my furniture.
And I send my $10, just like clockwork.

410
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,438
How long you say
you been paying this $10 a month?

411
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,555
15 years.

412
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,360
Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?

413
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,376
How much the man done charge you?

414
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,913
Oh, hell, I done paid for it.

415
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,632
I done paid for it 10 times over.

416
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,056
Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.

417
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,514
Troy lying.
We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.

418
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,318
He ain't paying
no $10 a month to nobody.

419
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,675
Hell, woman,
Bono know I ain't that big a fool.

420
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,376
I was just getting ready to say,
I know where there's a bridge for sale.

421
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,469
I'll tell you this.

422
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,312
It don't matter to me if it was the devil.

423
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,816
It don't matter if the devil give credit.

424
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,751
- Somebody got to give it.
- It ought to matter.

425
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,176
You walking around here saying
you gonna make truck with the devil,

426
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,696
God's the one
you're gonna have to answer to.

427
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,240
He's the one gonna be at the Judgment.

428
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,280
Yeah, well, look here, Pop,
let me have that $10.

429
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,475
I'll give it back to you.

430
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,056
Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.

431
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,149
Bono, what did I tell you?

432
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,896
Only time I see this nigger
is when he want something.

433
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,160
That's the only time I see him.

434
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,709
Come on, Pop,
Mr. Bono don't want to hear all that.

435
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,995
Let me have the $10.
I told you, Bonnie's working!

436
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,496
What that mean to me
if Bonnie's working?

437
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,671
I don't care if she working.
Go ask her for $10 if she's working.

438
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,433
Talking about Bonnie working.
Why ain't you working?

439
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,876
Ah, Pop,
you know I can't find no decent job.

440
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,096
Where am I gonna get a job at?
You know I can't get no job.

441
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,315
I told you,
I know some people down there.

442
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,296
I can get you on the rubbish
if you want to work.

443
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,118
I told you that last time you
come back here asking for something.

444
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,576
No, Pop, thanks, that ain't for me.

445
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,136
I don't want to be carrying
nobody's rubbish.

446
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,040
I don't want to be punching
nobody's time clock.

447
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,136
What's the matter?
You too good to carry people's rubbish?

448
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,096
Where you think
that $10 you talking about comes from?

449
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,872
I'm just supposed to
haul people's rubbish

450
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,896
and give my money to you
'cause you too lazy to work?

451
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,035
You're too lazy to work

452
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,776
and want to know
why you ain't got what I got.

453
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,496
What hospital
Bonnie working at, Mercy?

454
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,320
She down at Passavant,
working in the laundry.

455
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,200
I ain't got nothing as it is.
I give you $10,

456
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,696
I got to eat beans the rest of the week?

457
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,216
No, you ain't getting no $10 over here.

458
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,719
You ain't got to be eating no beans.

459
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,136
I don't know why you want to say that?

460
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,991
I ain't got no extra money!

461
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,029
Gabe done moved out,

462
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,475
giving his money over there
to Miss Pearl, paying her rent.

463
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,816
Things done got tight around here.

464
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,376
I can't afford to be
giving you every payday.

465
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,039
I ain't asked you to give me nothing.
I asked you to loan me $10.

466
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,189
I know you got $10.

467
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,396
Yeah, I got it. You know why I got it?

468
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,755
'Cause I don't throw my money away
on them streets.

469
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,876
You want to live the fast life,
being a musician,

470
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,598
running around in them
clubs and things,

471
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,120
then learn to take care of yourself.

472
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,351
You ain't gone find me asking
nobody for nothing!

473
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,759
I spent too many years without.

474
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,336
Hey, you and me is two different people.

475
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,591
I done learned my mistake
and I learned to do what's right by it.

476
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,416
You still trying to get
something for nothing.

477
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,589
Life don't owe you nothing.

478
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,274
You owe it to yourself.
Ask Bono. He'll tell you I'm right.

479
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,794
You got your way of
dealing with the world, I got mine.

480
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,677
Only thing that matters to me
is the music.

481
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,120
Yeah, I can see that.
Don't matter how you gonna eat,

482
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,616
don't matter
where your next dollar coming from.

483
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,119
Yeah, you telling the truth there.

484
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,270
I know I got to eat.
But I got to live, too.

485
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,816
I need something that's gonna help me
get out of bed in the morning,

486
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,416
make me feel like I belong in the world.

487
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,112
I don't bother nobody.

488
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,349
I just stay with my music

489
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,656
'cause that's the only way
I can find to live in the world.

490
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,274
Otherwise, ain't no telling
what I might do.

491
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,238
I don't come by
criticizing you and how you live.

492
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,278
I just come by to ask you for $10.

493
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,470
I don't want to hear
all that about how I live.

494
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,994
Boy, your mama did
a hell of a job raising you.

495
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,753
You can't change me, Pop.
I'm 34 years old.

496
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,754
If you wanted to change me,

497
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,760
you should have been there
when I was growing up.

498
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,469
I come by to see you, ask you for $10,

499
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,313
and you want to talk about
how I was raised?

500
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,915
You don't know nothing
about how I was raised.

501
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,829
Let the boy have $10, Troy.

502
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,112
Hell you looking at?
You know I ain't got no money.

503
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,031
You know what I do with my money.

504
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,000
Go on, give him $10
if you want him to have it.

505
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,357
I will, soon as you turn it loose.

506
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,191
There it is.

507
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,316
Seventy six dollars
and twenty-two cents.

508
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,673
You see this, Bono?
I ain't gonna get but six of that back.

509
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,752
He ought to stop telling that lie.
Here, Lyons.

510
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,189
Thanks, Rose.

511
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,016
Look, I got to run. I'll see you all later.

512
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,190
Wait a minute.
You gonna say, "Thanks, Rose,"

513
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,176
but you ain't gonna look to see
where she got that money from.

514
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,296
You see how they do me, Bono?

515
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,616
I know she got it from you, Pop.
Thanks. I'll give it back to you.

516
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,776
There you go, telling another lie.

517
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,030
Time I see that $10,
you'll be owing me $30 more.

518
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,031
- See you, Mr. Bono.
- Take care, Lyons.

519
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,553
- Thanks, Pop. I'll see you again.
- Mmm-hmm.

520
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,552
I don't know why that boy don't go
and get him a decent job

521
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,976
and take care of that woman he got.

522
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,514
He'll be all right, Troy.
The boy is still young!

523
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,478
The boy is 34 years old.

524
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,232
Let's not get off into all that.

525
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,471
Look here, I got to go. I got to be going.
Lucille gonna be waiting.

526
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,915
See this woman, Bono?

527
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,632
I love this woman.

528
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,152
I love her so much, it hurts.

529
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,279
I love her so much,
I done run out of ways of loving her,

530
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,590
so, I got to get back to basics.

531
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,480
Don't you come by my house
Monday morning,

532
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,736
talking about time to go to work.

533
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,910
- 'Cause I'm gonna still be stroking.
- Troy, stop!

534
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,672
I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.

535
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,376
That ain't nothing but gin talk.

536
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,436
Go on, Troy! I'll see you Monday.

537
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,750
Don't you come by my house, nigger!

538
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,670
I done told you
what I'm gonna be doing!

539
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,196
Come back on Tuesday!

540
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,556
Jesus be a fence

541
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,395
All around me

542
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,277
Every day

543
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,757
Good morning.

544
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,796
You ready for breakfast?
I can fix you some

545
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,155
soon as I finish hanging up
these clothes.

546
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,117
I got the coffee on.
That's all right.

547
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,794
I just have some of that this morning.

548
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,310
That 651 hit yesterday.

549
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,233
That's the second time this month
Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.

550
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,629
Seems like those that need the least
always get lucky.

551
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,976
Poor folks can't get nothing.

552
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,319
Them numbers don't know nobody.

553
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,560
I don't know why you fool with 'em,
you and Lyons both.

554
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,159
Oh, it's something to do.

555
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,515
You ain't doing nothing
but throwing your money away.

556
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,158
Troy, you know I don't play foolishly.

557
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,896
I just play a nickel here
and a nickel there.

558
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,496
That's two nickels
you done throwed away.

559
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,159
Nah, I hit sometimes.
That makes up for it.

560
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,753
Always comes in handy when I do hit.

561
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,056
I don't hear you complaining then.

562
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,000
I ain't complaining now.
I just say it's foolish,

563
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,191
trying to guess out of 600 ways
which way the number gonna come.

564
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,840
If I had all the money these niggers...

565
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,433
You negroes throw away
on numbers in one week,

566
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,353
just one week, I'd be a rich man.

567
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,919
You wishing and calling it foolish

568
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,656
ain't gonna stop folks
from playing the numbers.

569
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,716
That's one thing for sure.

570
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,951
Besides, some good things
come from playing numbers.

571
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,998
Look where Pope done bought him
that restaurant off of numbers.

572
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,514
I can't stand niggers like that.

573
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,716
Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.

574
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,519
He running around with his shoes
all run-over,

575
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,591
bumming money for cigarettes.

576
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,592
All right.
Got lucky there, hit the numbers...

577
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,080
Troy, I know all about it.

578
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,496
Had good sense.
I'll say that for him.

579
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,873
Man ain't throw his money away.

580
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,794
I done see niggers go through
$2,000 in four days.

581
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,394
Man built him that restaurant
down there.

582
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,993
Fix it up real nice, too.

583
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,957
Then he won't let nobody come in it.

584
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,349
Negro go in there,
can't get no kind of service.

585
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,716
Seen a white fella go in there,
he orders a bowl of stew.

586
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,070
Pope pick all the meat
out of the pot for him.

587
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,116
Man ain't had nothing
but a bowl of meat!

588
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,679
Negro go in there behind him,

589
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,776
he ain't got nothing
but the potatoes and the carrots.

590
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,916
Talking about
what numbers do for people.

591
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,296
You picked the wrong example there.

592
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,390
Ain't done nothing
but made a worser fool out of him

593
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,272
than he already was before.

594
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,434
Troy.

595
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,751
You ought to stop worrying about
what happened at work yesterday.

596
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,359
I ain't worried.

597
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,000
Just called me down there,
the Commissioner's office,

598
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,759
everybody's worried
about them firing me.

599
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,718
I ain't worrying about them firing me.

600
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,030
You ain't got to worry about that.

601
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,270
Where's Cory? Cory in the house?

602
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,830
- Cory!
- He gone out.

603
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,672
Out, huh? Yeah, he going out

604
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,638
'cause he know
I want him to work on this fence.

605
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,631
I know how he is.
That boy is scared of working.

606
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,056
He ain't done a lick of work in his life.

607
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,559
He had to go to football practice.

608
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Coach wanted them
to get in a little extra practice

609
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,994
before the season start.

610
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,752
Oh, yeah, I got his practice all right.

611
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,115
Running out of here
before he gets his chores done.

612
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,840
Troy, what is wrong with you
this morning?

613
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,056
Don't nothing set right with you.

614
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,480
Go on back in there, go to bed,
and get up on the other side.

615
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,856
Why something got to be
wrong with me?

616
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,016
I ain't said nothing wrong with me.

617
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,576
Well, you got something to say
about everything.

618
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,416
First, it's the numbers,
then it's the way the man

619
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,271
run his restaurant,
then you done got on Cory.

620
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,873
What's it gonna be next?

621
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,150
Take a look up there,
see if the weather suit you.

622
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,816
Or is it gonna be
how you gonna put up this fence

623
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,176
with the clothes hanging in the yard?

624
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,792
You hit the nail on the head then.

625
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,950
I know you like I know
the back of my hand.

626
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,871
Come on in here
and get you some more coffee,

627
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,518
see if that don't straighten you up.

628
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,278
'Cause you ain't right this morning.

629
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,431
Three for a quarter

630
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,555
Come and buy now
'Cause I'm here today

631
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,954
Yes, sir, I got plums

632
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,999
Ask me how I sell 'em

633
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,310
Ten cents apiece
Three for a quarter

634
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,879
Come and buy now

635
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Hey!

636
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,156
'Cause I'm here today
Tomorrow, I'll be gone

637
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,708
There's Troy. Hey, Troy.

638
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Hey, Gabe.

639
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,753
- Hey, Rose.
- Hey, Gabe.

640
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,353
What you got there?

641
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,273
You know what I got, Rose?
I got fruits and vegetables.

642
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,157
Where them plums you talking about?

643
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,835
I ain't got no plums today.
I was just singing that.

644
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,589
I'll have some tomorrow.
I put me in a big order for plums.

645
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,879
I'll have enough plums
tomorrow for Saint Peter and everybody!

646
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,076
Troy mad at me.

647
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,789
I ain't mad at you, Gabe.
What I got to be mad at you about?

648
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,016
You ain't done nothing to me.

649
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,713
I just move over to Miss Pearl's

650
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,472
to keep out from in your way.

651
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,788
I ain't mean no harm by it.

652
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,393
Who said anything about that?

653
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,993
I ain't said nothing about that.

654
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,872
You ain't mad at me, is you?

655
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,556
I ain't made at you, Gabe.
If I was mad at you, I'd tell you about it.

656
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,029
Come on, get on out of the street.
Come on.

657
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,709
I got me two rooms in the basement.
I got my own door, too.

658
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,349
- You want to see my key?
- Mmm-mmm.

659
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,515
That's my own key.
Ain't nobody else got a key like that.

660
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,431
That's my key for my two rooms.

661
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,476
That's good, Gabe.
Got your own key, that's good.

662
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,754
You hungry, Gabe?

663
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,576
I was just fixing to cook Troy
some breakfast.

664
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,749
I'll take some biscuits.

665
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,400
- Ooh, you got some biscuits?
- Mmm-mmm.

666
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,077
Did you know, when I was in Heaven,

667
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,071
every morning, me and Saint Peter

668
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,994
would sit down by the Gate
and eat some big, fat biscuits?

669
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,116
Oh, yeah, we had us a good time.

670
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,470
We'd sit there and eat us them biscuits.

671
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,154
And then Saint Peter
would go off to sleep,

672
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,832
and tell me to wake him up

673
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,195
when it's time to open the Gates
for the Judgment.

674
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,751
Well, come on,
I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.

675
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,793
Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your name
in his book. I seen it.

676
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,757
It say, "Troy Maxson."

677
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,917
I say, "I know him.

678
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,310
"He got the same name like what I got.

679
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,356
"That's my brother."

680
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,069
How many times
you gonna tell me that, Gabe?

681
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,197
Ain't got my name in the book.
Don't have to have my name.

682
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,510
I done died and went to Heaven.

683
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,592
But he got your name, though.

684
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,990
One morning,
Saint Peter was looking at his book,

685
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,753
and he was marking it up
for the Judgment,

686
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,876
and he let me see your name.

687
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,793
He got it in there under "M."

688
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,836
He got Rose's name.

689
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,270
I ain't seen it like I seen yours,
but I know it's in there.

690
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,956
He got a great big book! Whoo!

691
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,713
He got everybody's name
what was ever been born.

692
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,074
That's what he told me.

693
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,997
But I seen your name.
I seen it with my own eye.

694
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Come in the house.

695
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,616
Rose gonna fix you something
to eat now.

696
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,074
I ain't hungry. I done had breakfast

697
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,156
with Aunt Jemima!

698
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,391
She come by,
cook me up a whole mess of flapjacks!

699
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,256
All right. Come on,
let's go in the house. Rose fix us...

700
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,736
Remember how we used to eat
them flapjacks?

701
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,920
Yes, I remember. Come on now.

702
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,115
- I got to go!
- Gabe!

703
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,798
- I got to go!
- Gabe, come on now!

704
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,678
I got to go sell my plums!

705
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,716
I done sold some tomatoes.

706
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,677
Got me two quarters. Want to see?

707
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,471
I'm gonna save 'em
and buy me a new horn,

708
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,315
so Saint Peter can hear me
when it's time to open the Gate.

709
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,913
You hear that?

710
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,039
You hear that?
That's the hellhound.

711
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,792
I'm gonna chase them out of here.

712
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,714
Go on! Get out of here!
Get out! Get out!

713
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,592
Ouch! Ouch!

714
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,076
All you hypocrite members

715
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,471
Wasting your time away

716
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,394
My God is calling
for a workman

717
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,631
You had better obey

718
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,998
Better get ready
for the Judgment

719
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,472
Better get ready
for the Judgment morning

720
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,719
Better get ready for Judgment

721
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,153
My God is coming down

722
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,832
Better get ready
for the Judgment

723
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,872
Better get ready
for the Judgment morning

724
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,993
Better get ready
for the Judgment

725
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,953
My God is coming down

726
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,792
Better get ready
for the Judgment

727
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,552
Better get ready
for the Judgment

728
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,716
Where's Gabe?

729
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,711
He's gone off somewhere.

730
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,475
He ain't eating right.

731
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,516
Miss Pearl say
she can't get him to eat nothing.

732
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,936
What you want me to do about it, Rose?

733
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,396
I did everything I could for the man.
I can't make him get well.

734
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,677
Man got half his head blown off,
what you expect?

735
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,496
Seems like something ought to be done
to help him.

736
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,839
The man don't bother nobody.

737
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,275
He just mixed up
'cause of that metal plate

738
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,033
he got in his head. Ain't no sense in...

739
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,157
Thank you. Ain't no sense
in sending him to the hospital.

740
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,559
At least he'd be eating right.

741
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,096
They could help him
take care of himself.

742
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,712
Don't nobody
want to be locked up, Rose.

743
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,677
What you want to lock the man up for?

744
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,398
Man going down there,

745
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,678
over there and fight that war,
messing with them Japs,

746
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,432
getting half his head blown off.

747
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,229
They give him a lousy $3,000.
I got to swoop down on that.

748
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,696
Is you fixing to get into that again?

749
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,756
He got a metal plate in his head.

750
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,916
That's the only reason
I got a roof over my head

751
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,513
is 'cause of that metal plate.

752
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,496
Ain't no sense
in you blaming yourself for nothing.

753
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,715
Gabe was in no condition
to manage that money.

754
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,976
You done what was right by him.

755
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,096
Can't nobody say
you ain't done what was right by him.

756
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,520
Look how long you took care of him.

757
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,200
Till he wanted his own place
and moved over there with Miss Pearl.

758
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,794
That ain't what I'm saying, woman.
I'm just...

759
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,833
I'm just stating the facts.

760
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,990
If my brother
didn't have a metal plate in his head,

761
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,513
I wouldn't have a pot to piss in

762
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,999
or a window to throw it out of.

763
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,798
And I'm 53...

764
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,358
Where you going off to?

765
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,176
You been running out of here
every Saturday for weeks.

766
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,033
I thought you were gonna
work on this fence.

767
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,839
I'm gonna go down to Taylors' and, uh...

768
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Mama?

769
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,110
Oh, Cory.
Your daddy like to have a fit with you

770
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,078
running out of here this morning
without doing your chores.

771
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,434
You all right?

772
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,796
He say you supposed to be
helping him with the fence.

773
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,280
I told you I had to go to practice.

774
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,416
And he's been saying that
the last four or five Saturdays,

775
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,512
and then don't ever do nothing
but go down to Taylors'.

776
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,056
You told him about the recruiter?

777
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,513
Yeah, I told him.

778
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,800
- Well, what'd he say?
- He didn't say nothing too much.

779
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,479
Go on and get started on your chores
before he gets back here.

780
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,199
Go on and scrub down them steps

781
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,158
before he come back here hollering
and carrying on!

782
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,071
Go! Boy, go!

783
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,990
Go on, Troy.
You liked to scare me to death.

784
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,336
What was the score of the game?

785
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,256
Lucille had me on the phone.
I couldn't keep up with it.

786
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,856
What do I care about the game?
Come here, woman.

787
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,096
I thought you went down to Taylors'

788
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,872
to listen to the game. Go on, Troy.

789
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,736
I thought you're supposed to
be putting up the fence.

790
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,115
I'll put it up when I finish with what...

791
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,555
Is at hand.

792
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,710
Go on, Troy.
I ain't studying you!

793
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,712
I'm studying you.
I'm finna do my homework.

794
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,472
Troy, you better leave me alone!

795
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,776
Where Cory?
That boy brought his butt home yet?

796
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,199
He's upstairs doing his chores.

797
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,599
Cory, get your butt...

798
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,275
- Where you going?
- I'll be right back.

799
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,954
- When?
- I'm just going right down the street.

800
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,790
Where? Who?

801
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,593
Troy, go in the house!

802
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,176
You just now coming here
from leaving this morning?

803
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,816
- Yeah, I had to go to football practice...
- Yeah, what?

804
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Yes, sir.

805
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,456
I ain't but two seconds off you, no way.

806
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,160
That garbage sitting in there,
overflowing.

807
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,576
You ain't done none of your chores.

808
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,856
Now you come in here,
talking about, "Yeah."

809
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,376
I was just getting ready
to do my chores now, Pop.

810
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,696
Your first chore is to help me
with this fence on Saturday.

811
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,278
Everything else come after that.

812
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,669
Now, get that saw,
we gonna cut these boards.

813
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,912
- Hey, Pop.
- Mmm?

814
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,797
Why don't you buy a TV?

815
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,314
What I want with a TV?
What I want one of them for?

816
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,198
Everybody got one.
Earl, Ba Bra, Jesse.

817
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,576
I ain't asked who had one,
I said what I want with one?

818
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,034
So, you can watch it.
They got lots of things on TV.

819
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,440
- Baseball and everything.
- Yeah?

820
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,760
We could watch the World Series.

821
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,796
- Yeah, how much this TV cost?
- I don't know.

822
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,474
They got 'em on sale for about $200.

823
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,198
- $200?
- That ain't that much, Pop.

824
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,874
No, that's just $200.

825
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,281
You see that roof
you got sitting over your head at night?

826
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,271
Let me tell you something
about that roof.

827
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,239
It's been 10 years
since that roof was last tarred.

828
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,437
See, now snow come this winter,
sit up on that roof like it is,

829
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
it's gonna seep inside,
just gonna be a little bit,

830
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,736
you ain't gonna hardly notice it,

831
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,875
then next thing you know,

832
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,496
it's gonna be leaking all over the house.

833
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,476
Then the wood rot from all that water,

834
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,471
and you gonna need a whole new roof.

835
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,755
Now how much you think it cost
to get that roof fixed?

836
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,079
- I don't know.
- $264 cash money. See?

837
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,878
While you be thinking about a TV,

838
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,473
I got to be thinking about the roof

839
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,120
or whatever else go wrong around here.

840
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,111
Now if you had $200,
what would you do?

841
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,589
Fix the roof, or buy a TV?

842
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,069
I'd buy a TV.
And when the roof started to leak,

843
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,480
if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.

844
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,976
Where you gonna get your money from?

845
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,319
You done spent it on a TV.

846
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,469
You gonna sit up in there,

847
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,790
let that water run all over
your brand-new TV?

848
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,438
Pop, you got the money. I know you do.

849
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,238
- Where I got it at, huh?
- In the bank.

850
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,594
You want to see my bank book?

851
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,478
You want to see that $73.22
I got sitting up in there?

852
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,296
You don't have to pay for it
all at one time.

853
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,256
You can put a down payment on it,
and carry it on with you.

854
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,953
Not me. I ain't owing nobody nothing
if I can help it.

855
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,600
Miss a payment, they come
and snatch it right out of your house.

856
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,717
Then what you got, huh? See?

857
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,315
Now, when I get $200 clear,
I'll buy me a TV.

858
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,796
Right now, when I get $264,
I'm gonna get that roof fixed.

859
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Oh, Pop...

860
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,679
You go get you $200
and buy you a TV if you want to.

861
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,360
I got better things to do with my money.

862
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,670
I can't get $200. I ain't never seen $200.

863
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,308
All right, I'll tell you what.

864
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,597
You get $100,
I'll put the other $100 with it.

865
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,159
All right, I'm gonna show you.

866
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,471
Yeah, show me how you can
cut these boards right now.

867
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,634
There you go. That's $200 worth.

868
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,152
- The Pirates won today.
- Yeah?

869
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,355
That makes five in a row.

870
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,616
I ain't thinking about no Pirates.

871
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,868
They got an all-white team.

872
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,635
Got that boy, though, that Puerto Rican
boy, Clemente?

873
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,029
Don't even half play him.

874
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,320
That boy could be something
if they'd give him a chance.

875
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,240
Play him one day,
sit him on the bench the next.

876
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,600
He gets lots of chances to play.

877
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,496
I'm talking about playing every day,
playing regular,

878
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,296
so you can get your timing,
that's what I'm talking about.

879
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,456
They got some white guys on the team
that don't play every day.

880
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,776
You can't play everybody
at the same time.

881
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,656
If they got a white fellow
sitting on the bench,

882
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,319
you can bet your last dollar
he can't play.

883
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,496
Colored guy got to be twice as good
to get on the team.

884
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,318
That's why I don't want you
getting all tied up in them sports.

885
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,436
Man on the team, what it get him?

886
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,476
Got colored on the team,
don't even use him.

887
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,313
Same as not having them.
All them teams the same.

888
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,675
The Braves got Hank Aaron
and Wes Covington.

889
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,791
Hank Aaron hit two home runs today.
That makes 43.

890
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Aaron ain't nobody.
That's what you supposed to do.

891
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,717
That's how
the game's supposed to be played.

892
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,616
Ain't nothing to it. It's a matter of
getting your timing and follow through.

893
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,756
Hell, I can hit 43 home runs right now.

894
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,376
Not off no major-league pitcher,
you couldn't.

895
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,016
We had better pitching
in the Negro leagues.

896
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,792
I hit seven home runs
off of Satchel Paige.

897
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,176
You can't get no better than that.

898
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,936
Sandy Koufax,
he leading the league in strikeouts.

899
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,520
I ain't thinking about no Sandy Koufax.

900
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,376
You got Warren Spahn
and Lew Burdette. I bet you...

901
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,628
I'm through with it now.

902
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,269
Go and cut them boards.

903
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,676
Your mama told me you got recruited
by a college football team.

904
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,079
Is that right?

905
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,511
Yeah, Coach Zellman say the recruiter
gonna be coming by to talk to you.

906
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,636
Get you to sign the permission papers.

907
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,376
I thought you was supposed to
be working down the A&P.

908
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,096
Ain't you supposed to be
working down there after school?

909
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,872
Mr. Stawicki say
he gonna hold my job for me

910
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,359
until after the football season.

911
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,029
He said starting next week,
I can work weekends.

912
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,032
Boy, I thought we had an understanding
about this football stuff.

913
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,838
You supposed to keep up
with your chores,

914
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,717
hold your job down there at the A&P.

915
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,995
You ain't been around here all day
on a Saturday,

916
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,354
ain't none of your chores done.

917
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,216
Now you come telling me
you done quit your job?

918
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,336
- I'm gonna be working weekends.
- You damn right you are!

919
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,256
And ain't no need for nobody
to be coming around here,

920
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,496
talking to me about signing nothing.

921
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,555
Pop, you can't do that.

922
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,016
He's coming all the way
from North Carolina.

923
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,871
I don't care where he coming from!

924
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,149
Look, boy,

925
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,556
the white man ain't gonna let you
get nowhere with no football no way.

926
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,155
Now you get your book-learning,
so you can, uh,

927
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,192
work your way up at the A&P
and learn how to fix cars,

928
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,952
or build houses, get you a trade.

929
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,554
This way, you got something
can't nobody take away from you.

930
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,069
You go in and learn
how to put your hands to good use

931
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,037
besides hauling other people's garbage.

932
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,189
I get good grades, Pop.

933
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,696
That's why the recruiter
want to talk with you.

934
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,336
You got to keep up
your grades to get recruited.

935
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,256
This way, I'll be going to college,
I'll get a chance.

936
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,750
First, you get your butt down there
and get your job back.

937
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,336
Mr. Stawicki done already
hired somebody else

938
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,000
'cause I told him I was playing football.

939
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,271
You a bigger fool than I thought.

940
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,351
You gonna let somebody
take away your job,

941
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,759
so you can play some football.

942
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,548
Where you gonna get your money

943
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,176
to take care of your girlfriend
and whatnot?

944
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,078
What kind of foolishness is that
to let somebody take away your job?

945
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,456
I'm still gonna be working weekends.

946
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,616
No. You getting out of here
and finding you another job.

947
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,914
Come on, Pop. I gotta practice.

948
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,816
I can't work after school
and play football, too.

949
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,456
The team needs me,
that's what Coach Zellman say.

950
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,696
I don't care what nobody say.
I'm the boss. You understand?

951
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,951
I'm the boss around here.
I do the only saying what counts.

952
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,429
- Come on...
- I asked you, "Do you understand?"

953
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,438
- Yeah.
- What?

954
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,671
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

955
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,557
You get on down there to that A&P

956
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,856
and see if you can get your job back.

957
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,440
If you can't do both,
then you quit the football team.

958
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,636
You got to take the crookeds
with the straights.

959
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,914
Yes, sir.

960
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,999
Can I ask you a question?

961
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,593
What the hell you got to ask me?

962
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,478
Mr. Stawicki the one
you got the questions for.

963
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,039
How come you ain't never liked me?

964
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,472
Like you?
Who the hell said I got to like you?

965
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,110
What law is there say I got to like you?

966
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,576
You want to stand up in front of my face

967
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,318
and ask a damn fool-ass question
like that.

968
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,674
Talk about liking somebody.

969
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,160
Come here, boy, when I talk to you.

970
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,718
Straighten up, God damn it!
I asked you a question.

971
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,958
- What law is there say I got to like you?
- None.

972
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,031
All right, then. Don't you eat every day?

973
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,833
Answer me when I talk to you.

974
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,056
- Don't you eat every day?
- Yeah.

975
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,752
Nigger, as long as you in my house,

976
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,920
you put a "sir" on the end of it
when you talk to me.

977
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,313
- Yes, sir.
- You eat every day?

978
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,776
- Got a roof over your head?
- Yes, sir.

979
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,056
- Got clothes on your back?
- Yes, sir.

980
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,680
- Why you think that is?
- 'Cause of you.

981
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,836
Hell, I know it's 'cause of me.

982
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,229
But why do you think that is?

983
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,239
'Cause you like me?

984
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,351
"Like" you.

985
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,317
I go out of here every morning,

986
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,710
I bust my butt putting up
with them crackers every day

987
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,518
'cause I "like" you.

988
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,637
You about the biggest fool I ever saw.
It's my job.

989
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,551
It's my responsibility.

990
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,438
A man is supposed to
take care of his family.

991
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,518
You live in my house,
fill your belly with my food,

992
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,195
put your behind on my bed
because you're my son.

993
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,078
Not 'cause I like you.
'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.

994
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,720
I owe a responsibility to you.

995
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,680
Now, let's get this straight
right here and now,

996
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,318
before it go along any further.

997
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,879
I ain't got to like you.

998
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,077
Mr. Rand don't give me my money
come payday 'cause he like me.

999
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,197
He give it to me 'cause he owe me.

1000
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,376
Now I done give you
everything I got to give you.

1001
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,709
I give you your life!

1002
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,336
Me and your mama
worked that out between us,

1003
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,477
and liking your black ass
wasn't part of the bargain.

1004
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,079
Now don't you go through life

1005
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,390
worrying about
whether somebody like you, or not.

1006
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,552
You best be making sure
they're doing right by you.

1007
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,336
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, sir.

1008
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,796
Then get the hell out of my face
and get on down to that A&P!

1009
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,594
Why don't you go ahead
and let the boy play football, Troy?

1010
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,591
He just want to be like you
with the sports.

1011
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,750
I don't want him to be like me.

1012
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,593
I want him to get as far away from my life
as he possibly can get.

1013
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,830
You the only decent thing
ever happened to me, Rose.

1014
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,793
And I wish him that.

1015
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,511
But I don't wish him
nothing else from my life.

1016
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,873
I decided 17 years ago,

1017
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,428
that boy wasn't gonna
get involved in no sports.

1018
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,216
Not after what they did to me
in the sports.

1019
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,536
Why don't you just admit
you were too old for the major leagues?

1020
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,160
For once, why don't you just admit that?

1021
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,912
Don't you come tellin' me I was too old.

1022
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,231
I just wasn't the right color.
Hell, I'm 53 years old,

1023
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,432
I can do better
than Selkirk's.269 right now.

1024
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,875
How were you gonna play ball
when you were over 40?

1025
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,640
Sometimes, I can't get
no sense out of you.

1026
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,789
I got good sense, woman.

1027
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,111
I got sense enough not to let that boy
get hurt playing no sports.

1028
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,713
You mothering the boy too much.

1029
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,956
Worrying about whether
people "like" him or not.

1030
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,316
Everything that boy do, he do for you.

1031
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,960
He wants you to say,
"Good job, son." That's all.

1032
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,517
I ain't got time for that, Rose.
He's alive, he's healthy.

1033
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,956
He's got to make his own way.
I made mine.

1034
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,656
Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand
when he get out there in the world.

1035
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,035
Times have changed, Troy.

1036
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,190
People change.

1037
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,555
The world changing,
and you can't even see it.

1038
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,874
Huh.

1039
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,833
Woman, I do the best I can do.

1040
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,239
I come in here every Friday,

1041
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,153
I carry a sack of potatoes
and a bucket of lard.

1042
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,835
You all line up at the door
with your hands out.

1043
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,672
I give you the lint from my pockets.

1044
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,512
I give you my sweat and my blood.

1045
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,194
I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.

1046
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,914
We go upstairs in that room at night,
I fall down on you

1047
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,515
and try to blast a hole into forever.

1048
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,830
I get up Monday morning,
find my lunch on the table,

1049
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,319
go out and make my way.

1050
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,678
Find my strength
to get me through to next Friday.

1051
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,159
That's all I got, Rose.

1052
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,078
That's all I got to give.

1053
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,793
Can't give nothing else!

1054
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,994
Mr. Maxson?

1055
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,115
Commissioner will see you now.

1056
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,273
Rose!

1057
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,832
Hey, Ro!

1058
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,311
I wish I could've seen
Mr. Rand's face when he told you.

1059
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,976
He couldn't get it out his mouth.

1060
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,194
Liked to bit his tongue.

1061
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,296
When they called me down there
to the Commissioner's office,

1062
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,073
he thought they was gonna fire me,
like everybody else.

1063
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,856
Oh, I didn't think they was gonna fire you.

1064
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,348
I thought they's gonna put you
on the warning paper.

1065
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,750
Hey, Rose!
Yeah, Mr. Rand liked to bit his tongue.

1066
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,876
I see you run right
down there to Taylors'

1067
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,274
and told that Alberta gal.

1068
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,432
Hey, Rose! I told everybody. Hey, Ro!

1069
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,431
I went down there to cash my check.

1070
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,355
Hey!

1071
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,237
Hush all that hollering.
I know you out here.

1072
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,176
What they say down
at the Commissioner's office?

1073
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,997
You supposed to come
when I call you, woman.

1074
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,229
Bono will tell you that.

1075
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,833
Don't Lucille come when you call her?

1076
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,096
Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog.

1077
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,440
Talk about come when you call me.

1078
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,136
You hear this, Bono?
I used to have me an old dog

1079
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,229
get uppity like that.

1080
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,880
You say, "Come here, Blue,"
he just lay there, look at you.

1081
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,296
End up getting a stick chasin' him away,
trying to make him come.

1082
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,799
I ain't studying you and your dog.

1083
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,520
I remember you used to
sing that old song.

1084
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,870
Hear it ring!
Hear it ring!

1085
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,752
Had an old dog
His name was Blue

1086
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,717
Nobody wants to hear that old song.

1087
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,072
You know Blue was mighty true

1088
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,296
Used to have Cory
runnin' around here singin' that song.

1089
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,992
Hell, I remember that song myself.

1090
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,435
You know Blue
Was a good old dog

1091
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,835
Blue treed a possum
In a hollow log

1092
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,514
That's my daddy's song.
My daddy made up that song.

1093
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,240
I don't care who made it up.
Don't nobody want to hear you sing it.

1094
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,833
Come here, woman!

1095
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,630
You come in here carrying on,
I reckon they ain't fired you.

1096
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,736
What they say down there
at the Commissioner's office?

1097
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,797
Look here, Rose.
Mr. Rand called me in his office

1098
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,394
after I got back from
talkin' to them people down there.

1099
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,789
He called me in his office
and told me...

1100
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,873
They was making me a driver!

1101
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,678
Troy, you kidding!

1102
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,432
No, I ain't. Ask Bono.

1103
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,216
That's great, Troy. Now you don't have to
hassle them people no more.

1104
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,357
Oh, hell.
I didn't think I was gonna see you today.

1105
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,919
I thought you was in jail.

1106
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,400
Got it all over the Courier
about them raiding Seefus' place

1107
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,954
where you be hanging out
with all them thugs.

1108
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,856
Hey, Pop,
that ain't got nothing to do with me.

1109
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,120
I don't go down there gambling.

1110
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,037
I just go down there
to sit in with the band.

1111
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,190
I ain't got nothing to do
with the gambling part.

1112
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,793
They got some good music down there.

1113
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,632
They got some rogues is what they got.

1114
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,711
How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.

1115
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,439
I see where you playing down
at the Crawford Grill tonight.

1116
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,096
How come you ain't brought
Bonnie like I told you?

1117
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,176
You shoulda brought Bonnie.

1118
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,576
She ain't been by in a month of Sundays.

1119
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,840
I was just in the neighborhood.

1120
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,376
- Thought I'd stop by.
- Here it comes.

1121
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,595
Your daddy got
a promotion on the rubbish.

1122
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,989
He gonna be the first colored driver.

1123
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,416
Ain't got to do nothin' but sit up there

1124
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,936
and read the paper,
like them white fellas.

1125
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,679
Hey, Pop, if you knew
how to read, you'd be all right.

1126
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,274
Nah, nah. You mean
if the nigger knew how to drive,

1127
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,696
he'd be all right.

1128
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,336
Been fighting with them
people about driving

1129
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,112
and ain't even got a license.

1130
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,976
Mr. Rand know
you ain't got no driver's license?

1131
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Driving ain't nothing.

1132
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,896
All you do is point the truck
where you want it to go.

1133
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,989
Driving ain't nothing.

1134
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,696
Do they know
you ain't got no driver's license?

1135
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,856
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1136
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,240
I ain't asked if driving was easy.

1137
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,675
I asked if Mr. Rand know
you ain't got no driver's license.

1138
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,896
The man ain't got to know my business.

1139
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,136
Time he find out, I have
two or three of them driver's license.

1140
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,037
- Say, look here, Pop.
- I knew it was coming.

1141
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,031
I knew what kinda
"Look here, Pop" that was.

1142
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,480
Nigger finna ask me
for some money.

1143
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,398
It's Friday night, it's my payday.

1144
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,995
All them rogues down on the avenue,
the ones that ain't in jail,

1145
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,799
and Lyons is hopping in his shoes
to get down there with them.

1146
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,915
Now, see, Pop,

1147
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,514
if you gave somebody else
a chance to talk sometime,

1148
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,195
you'd see I was fixing to pay you back
your $10 like I told you.

1149
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,431
Here. I told you I'd pay you
when Bonnie got paid.

1150
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,715
No, you keep that $10.
Put it in the bank.

1151
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,456
Next time you feel like
you wanna come by here

1152
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,416
and ask me for somethin',
you go down there and get that.

1153
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,668
Here you go your $10, Pop.

1154
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,616
I told you,
I don't want you to give me nothing.

1155
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,868
I just wanted to borrow $10.

1156
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,520
No, you keep that for the next time
you want to ask me.

1157
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,119
Come on, Pop, here go your $10.

1158
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,272
Troy, why don't you let the boy
pay you back?

1159
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,680
Here you go, Rose. If you don't take it,

1160
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,716
I'm gonna hear about it
for the next six months.

1161
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,438
You can hand yours over, too, Troy.

1162
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,096
You see this, Bono?
You see how they do me?

1163
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,872
Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.

1164
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,310
Better get Ready for the Judgment

1165
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,358
Better get ready

1166
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,151
Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!

1167
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,559
How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

1168
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,119
Lyons!

1169
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,435
The King of the Jungle!

1170
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,718
Rose. Hey, Rose, I got a flower for you.

1171
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,234
I picked it myself.
That's the same rose like you is.

1172
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,992
Aw, that's right nice of you, Gabe.

1173
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,600
What you been doing,
Uncle Gabe?

1174
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,150
Oh, I been chasing hellhounds
and waiting for the time

1175
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,071
to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.

1176
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,832
You been chasing hellhounds, huh?

1177
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,640
Well, you doing
the right thing, Uncle Gabe.

1178
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,712
- Somebody's got to chase 'em.
- Oh, yeah, I know it.

1179
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,678
The devil's strong.
The devil ain't no pushover.

1180
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,194
Hellhounds
snipping at everybody's heels.

1181
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,874
But I got my trumpet waiting
on the Judgment time.

1182
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,736
Waiting on
the Battle of Armageddon, huh?

1183
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,830
Oh, ain't gonna be too much of a battle

1184
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,396
when God get to waving
that Judgment sword. Whoo!

1185
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,550
But the people's
gonna have a hell of a time

1186
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,200
trying to get into Heaven
if them Gates ain't open.

1187
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,793
- You hear this, Pop?
- Mmm.

1188
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,555
- Uncle Gabe, you all right.
- Lyons.

1189
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,874
The King of the Jungle!

1190
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,120
You stayin' for supper, Gabe?

1191
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,336
You want me to fix you a plate?

1192
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,272
I'll just take a sandwich, Rose.
I don't want no plate.

1193
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,476
I want to eat with my hands.
I'll take a sandwich.

1194
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,736
What about you, Lyons?
You stayin'?

1195
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,954
Got some short ribs cooking.

1196
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,510
Nah. I won't eat nothing
till after we finish playing.

1197
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,151
You ought to come down,
listen to me play, Pop.

1198
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,515
Oh, I don't like all that Chinese music,
all that noise.

1199
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,070
Go in there and wash up, Gabe.
I'll fix you a sandwich.

1200
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,799
- Troy mad at me.
- Huh?

1201
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,233
What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?

1202
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,416
He think Troy mad at him

1203
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,158
'cause he moved over there
to Miss Pearl's.

1204
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,376
I ain't mad at the man.
He can live where he want to live at.

1205
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,616
Well, what he move over there for?
Miss Pearl don't like nobody.

1206
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,456
Oh, she don't mind him none.
She treat him real nice.

1207
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,000
She just don't allow all that singing.

1208
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,640
She don't mind that rent he be paying.
That's what she don't mind.

1209
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,256
Troy, I ain't goin' through that
with you no more.

1210
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,136
He moved over there
'cause he wanted his own place.

1211
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,296
He can come and go as he please.

1212
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,496
He can come and go as he please here.
I wasn't stoppin' him.

1213
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,816
I wasn't putting no rules on the man.

1214
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,592
That ain't the same thing,
and you know it.

1215
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,976
Now that's the last
I wanna hear about that.

1216
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,256
I don't wanna hear nothin' else
about Gabe and Miss Pearl.

1217
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,315
And next week...

1218
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,913
I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.

1219
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,216
And next week, when that recruiter
come from that school,

1220
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,913
I want you to sign that paper
and go on and let Cory play football.

1221
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,800
That'll be the last
I have to hear about that.

1222
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,391
Cory got recruited?
What school he goin' to?

1223
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,112
I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.

1224
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,350
Boy walking around here
smelling his piss,

1225
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,976
thinking he gonna do
what he want to do,

1226
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,275
irregardless of what I say.

1227
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,635
Look here, Bono,
I left the Commissioner's office

1228
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,119
and went down to the A&P.

1229
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,395
That boy ain't workin' down there,
he lied to me.

1230
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,836
T ellin' me he got his job back,
tellin' me he workin' weekend,

1231
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,478
tellin' me he workin' after school.

1232
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,790
Mr. Stawicki says
he ain't working down there at all.

1233
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,074
Cory just growing up.

1234
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,296
He just bustin' at the seams,
tryin' to fill out your shoes.

1235
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,469
I don't care what he doing.

1236
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,640
When he get to the place
where he want to disobey me,

1237
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,871
then it's time for him to move on.
Bono will tell you that.

1238
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,635
I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy
without paying the consequences.

1239
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,995
I ain't never had the chance.

1240
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,675
My daddy came on through,
but I ain't never knew him to see him.

1241
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,354
Or what he had on his mind,
or where he went.

1242
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,115
Just moving on through.
Searching out the New Land.

1243
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,309
That's what the old folks used to call it.

1244
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,836
See a fella moving around
from place to place, woman to woman,

1245
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,309
they call it
"Searching out the New Land."

1246
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,038
I can't say if he ever found it.

1247
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,268
I come along, didn't want no kids.

1248
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,816
I didn't know if I was gonna
be in one place long enough

1249
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,831
to fix on 'em right as their daddy.

1250
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,036
I figured I was going searching, too.

1251
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,350
As it turn out,
I been hooked up with Lucille

1252
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,829
for near about as long as
your daddy been with Rose.

1253
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,070
Going on 16 years.

1254
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,080
Sometimes, I wish
I'd never known my daddy.

1255
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,874
He ain't cared nothing about no kids.
A kid to him wasn't nothing.

1256
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,431
All he wanted you to do
was learn how to walk,

1257
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,192
so he could start you to working.

1258
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,034
Come to eating, he ate first.
Anything left over, that's what you got.

1259
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,192
Man would sit down,
eat two chickens, and give you the wing.

1260
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,556
You ought to stop that, Pop.
Everybody feed their kids.

1261
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,757
No matter how hard times is,
everybody care about their kids.

1262
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,096
Make sure they have something to eat.

1263
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,872
Only thing my daddy cared about

1264
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,776
was getting them bales of cotton
in to Mr. Lubin.

1265
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,836
That's the only thing
that mattered to him.

1266
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,070
Sometimes, I used to wonder
why he was still living,

1267
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,720
why the devil hadn't come and got him.

1268
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,871
"Get them bales of cotton
in to Mr. Lubin."

1269
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,313
Find out he owe him money.

1270
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,456
He should have just
went on and left

1271
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,656
when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.

1272
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,776
That's what I would've done.

1273
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,712
How he gonna leave with 11 kids?
And where he gonna go?

1274
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,997
He ain't knew nothing but how to farm.
No, he was trapped.

1275
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,551
I think he knew it, too.
But I'll say this for him...

1276
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,392
He felt a responsibility toward us.

1277
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,480
May not have treated us
like I felt he should have,

1278
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,437
but without that responsibility,

1279
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,476
he could have run off and left us,

1280
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,919
made his own way.

1281
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,399
A lot of them did.

1282
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,136
Back in those days,
what you talkin' about?

1283
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,840
- Mmm-mmm.
- They walk out their front door

1284
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,077
and take off down one road or another
and just keep on walkin'.

1285
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,071
There you go.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1286
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,516
Just keep on walking
till they come to something else.

1287
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,910
Ain't you never heard of nobody
having the walking blues?

1288
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,468
Now, that's what you call it
when you just take off like that.

1289
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,154
Mmm, my daddy ain't had no
walking blues.

1290
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,434
What you talking about?

1291
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,040
He stayed right there with his family,

1292
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,753
but he was just as evil as he could be!

1293
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,509
My mama couldn't stand him.
Couldn't stand that evilness.

1294
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,592
She run off when I was about eight.

1295
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,837
She sneaked off one night,
told me she was coming back for me.

1296
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,638
I ain't never seen her no more.

1297
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,838
All his women run off and left him.
He wasn't good for nobody.

1298
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,032
My turn come to head out.

1299
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,473
I was 14,

1300
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,438
got to sniffing around
Joe Canewell's daughter.

1301
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,109
We had this old mule called "Greyboy".

1302
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,356
My daddy sent me out
to do some plowing.

1303
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,115
I got to fooling around
with Joe Canewell's daughter.

1304
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,397
Found us a nice spot,
got real cozy with each other.

1305
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,677
She was about 13,
so we done figured we grown anyway.

1306
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,149
So, we were down there by the creek,
enjoying ourselves,

1307
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,639
ain't thinking about nothing.

1308
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,029
Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose,

1309
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,556
wandered back to the house,
and my daddy was lookin' for me.

1310
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,310
So, we down there enjoying ourselves
when he come up on us.

1311
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,470
Surprised us.

1312
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,114
Had them leather straps off that mule,

1313
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,237
commenced to whupping me
like there was no tomorrow.

1314
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,914
I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.

1315
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,716
I was scared of my daddy.

1316
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,911
Now, when he commenced
to whipping on me,

1317
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,760
quite naturally,
I run to get out of the way.

1318
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,473
Now, I think he's mad
'cause I ain't done my work.

1319
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,199
But I see where he's chasing me off,

1320
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,191
so he can have the gal for himself.

1321
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,716
When I see what the matter of it was,

1322
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,878
I lost all fear of my daddy,
and right there, I became a man.

1323
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,349
Fourteen years of age.

1324
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,352
Now, it's my turn to run him off.

1325
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,237
I picked up them same reins
he used on me.

1326
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,915
I picked up them reins,
I commenced to whupping on him.

1327
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,269
Gal jump up, she run off.

1328
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,428
When he turned to face me,

1329
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,397
I knew why the devil
never come and get him

1330
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,630
'cause he was the devil himself.

1331
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,520
I don't know what happened.

1332
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,797
I woke up,
laying there by the creek,

1333
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,555
and Blue, this old dog we had,
he was licking my face.

1334
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,677
Both my eyes were swoll shut.

1335
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,591
I thought I was blind,
I couldn't see nothing.

1336
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,389
I just laid there and cried.

1337
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,872
And I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1338
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,397
But I knew the time had come
for me to leave my daddy's house.

1339
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,989
Suddenly, the world got big, and...

1340
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,993
It was a long time before I could
cut it down to where I could handle it.

1341
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,513
Part of that cutting down
was where I got to the place

1342
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,591
where I could feel him
kicking in my blood,

1343
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,336
and I knew the only thing
that separated us

1344
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,476
was a matter of a few years.

1345
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,000
What you got there,
Uncle Gabe?

1346
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,313
I got me a ham sandwich.

1347
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,550
Rose gave me a ham sandwich.

1348
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,190
I lost touch with everybody
except Gabriel.

1349
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,200
But...

1350
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,711
I hope he's dead.

1351
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,633
I hope he found some peace.

1352
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,756
That's a heavy story, Pop.

1353
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,948
I didn't know you left home
when you was 14.

1354
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,116
Fourteen's kinda young
to be on your own.

1355
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,077
I don't know what I would've done.

1356
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,638
Well, I got up from that creek,
walked on down to Mobile.

1357
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,395
I was through with farming.
I figured I'd do better in the cities.

1358
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,311
So, I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.

1359
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,834
Wait a minute,
you ain't walked no 200 miles, Pop.

1360
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,116
Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.

1361
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,156
You talking about some walking there!

1362
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,993
That's the only way you got anywhere
back in them days.

1363
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,913
Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have
hitched a ride with somebody.

1364
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,736
Who you gonna hitch it with?

1365
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,616
There ain't no cars
and things like they got now.

1366
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,278
We talking about 1918.

1367
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,918
What you all out here gettin' into?

1368
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,195
I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.

1369
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,616
He don't know nothing
about this I'm talking.

1370
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,080
Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.

1371
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,456
She says you supposed to pick her up.

1372
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,232
Yeah, okay, Rose.

1373
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,039
I walked on down to Mobile,

1374
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,396
hitched up with some fellows
that was coming up this way.

1375
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,118
Got up here and found out,

1376
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,713
not only could you not get a job,

1377
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,353
you couldn't find no place to live.

1378
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,079
I thought I was in freedom.

1379
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,749
Colored folks living down there
on the riverbanks

1380
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,136
in whatever kind of shelter
they could find for themselves.

1381
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,628
Right down there
under the Brady Street Bridge.

1382
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,350
Living down there in shacks
made out of sticks and tar paper.

1383
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,118
Messed around down there.

1384
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,714
Went from bad to worse.
Started stealing.

1385
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,394
First, it was food.
Then I figure I steal me some money,

1386
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,948
I can buy me some food,
buy me some shoes, too.

1387
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,032
One thing led to another.
Met your mama.

1388
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,789
I was young, anxious to be a man.

1389
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,715
I met your mama and had you.
Why'd I do that for?

1390
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,234
Now, I got to worry about
feeding you and her.

1391
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,799
Got to steal three times as much.

1392
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,030
I went out one day
looking for somebody to rob.

1393
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,520
That's what I was, I was a robber.

1394
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,752
I'mma tell you the truth.

1395
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,751
I'm ashamed of it today,
but it's the truth.

1396
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,677
I went to rob this fella,
I pull out my knife.

1397
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,910
He pulled out a gun,
shot me in the chest.

1398
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,231
It felt like somebody had taken
a hot branding iron and laid it on me.

1399
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,357
Now, when he shot me,
I jumped at him with my knife,

1400
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,071
and they say I killed him.

1401
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,296
Locked me up, put me
in the penitentiary for 15 years.

1402
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,673
That's where I met Bono.

1403
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,515
Where I learned how to play baseball.

1404
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,176
Got out that place,
and your mama had taken you,

1405
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,191
went on to make a life without me.

1406
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,350
Fifteen years was a long time
for her to wait.

1407
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,376
But that 15 years
cured me of that robbing stuff.

1408
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,753
Rose'll tell you.

1409
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,115
I first met her, she ask me if I had

1410
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,350
gotten all that foolishness
out of my system.

1411
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,271
I said, "Baby, it's you and baseball,

1412
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,078
"all what count to me."
You hear me, Bono?

1413
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,799
And I meant it, too.
She said, "Which one come first?"

1414
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,952
I said, "Well, ain't no
doubt it's baseball.

1415
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,996
"But you stick and get old with me,

1416
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,640
"and we'll both outlive this baseball."

1417
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,836
Am I right, Rose?

1418
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,109
And it's true.

1419
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,016
Man, hush your mouth.
You ain't say no such thing.

1420
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,696
Talkin' about, "Baby, you know
you'll always be number one with me."

1421
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,314
That's what you was talking.

1422
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,628
That's why I love this woman.

1423
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,936
Rose will keep you straight.

1424
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,076
You get off the track,
she'll straighten you up.

1425
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,576
Lyons, you better get on up
and get Bonnie.

1426
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,079
She waiting on you.

1427
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,434
- Hey, Pop.
- Yeah?

1428
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,556
You ought to come down to the Grill,
hear me play.

1429
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,918
Oh, man, I ain't goin' down there.

1430
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,496
I'm too old
to be hanging out in them clubs.

1431
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,796
You got to be good to
play down at the Grill.

1432
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,359
Come on, Pop.

1433
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,228
- I got to get up in the morning.
- Well, you ain't gotta stay long.

1434
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,915
No, I'm gonna eat my supper
and go to bed.

1435
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,833
Well, I got to go. I'll see you later.

1436
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,635
Don't you come by my house
on my payday!

1437
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,110
And pick up the phone,
let somebody know you coming,

1438
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,256
and bring Bonnie,
you know I'm always glad to see her.

1439
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,750
I'll do that, Rose.
You take care now.

1440
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,353
- See you, Pop.
- All right.

1441
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,510
See you, Mr. Bono.

1442
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,637
- See you, Uncle Gabe!
- Lyons! King of the Jungle!

1443
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,074
Supper ready, woman?

1444
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,776
Me and you got some business
to take care of.

1445
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,075
- I'mma tear it up, too.
- Troy, I done told you now!

1446
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,037
Oh, hell, woman, it's Bono.
Bono like family.

1447
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,315
I done know this nigger since...

1448
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,868
- How long have I known you?
- It's been a long time.

1449
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,349
I done known this nigger
since Skippy was a pup!

1450
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,271
Me and him
done been through some times!

1451
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,032
You sure are right about that.

1452
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,111
Hell, I known him
longer than I known you, Rose,

1453
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,031
and we still standin'
shoulder to shoulder.

1454
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,510
Look here, Bono,
a man can't ask for no more than that.

1455
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,828
I love you, nigger.

1456
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,876
Oh, hell! I love you, too.

1457
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,952
But I got to get home, see my woman.
You got yours in hand.

1458
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,793
I got to go get mine.

1459
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,637
What you do that for, Pop?

1460
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,136
What's the matter?
Cory, what's the matter?

1461
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,976
Pop done went up to the school
and told Coach Zellman

1462
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,200
I can't play football no more.

1463
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,753
Wouldn't even let me play the game.

1464
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,416
Told him to tell the recruiter not to come.

1465
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,237
- Troy.
- What you Troying me for?

1466
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,976
Yeah, I did it.
And the boy knows why I did it.

1467
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,936
Why you wanna do that to me?
That was the one chance I had!

1468
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,456
Ain't nothing wrong
with Cory playing football, Troy.

1469
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,629
The boy lied to me.

1470
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,234
I told the nigger,
"You want to play football,

1471
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,594
"you keep up with your chores

1472
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,194
"hold that job down at the A&P."
That was the conditions.

1473
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,760
I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...

1474
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,559
I can't work after school
during the football season, Pop.

1475
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,856
I tried to tell you
Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.

1476
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,296
You don't never want to listen to nobody,

1477
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,656
and then you wanna go
and do this to me?

1478
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,296
I ain't done nothin' to you.
You done it to yourself.

1479
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,912
Just 'cause you didn't get a chance!

1480
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,360
You're just scared
I'm gonna be better than you, that's all!

1481
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,028
- Come here.
- Troy.

1482
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,720
Troy.

1483
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,039
Pick it up.

1484
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,678
Put it on.

1485
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,277
Strap it up.

1486
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,233
All right.

1487
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,552
See, you done made a mistake.

1488
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,320
- I didn't even do nothing!
- I'll tell you what your mistake was.

1489
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,629
You swung at the ball
and you didn't hit it.

1490
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,389
That's strike one.
You in the batter's box now.

1491
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,600
You swung and you missed, see?

1492
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,068
That's strike one.

1493
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,032
Don't you strike out.

1494
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,993
Cory, why don't you come on in here,
help me clean out these cupboards.

1495
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,436
I ain't quitting the team.
I don't care what Papa says.

1496
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,670
I'll talk to him when he get back.

1497
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,496
He had to go see
about your Uncle Gabe.

1498
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,794
Police done arrested him again.

1499
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,592
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1500
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,033
He'll be back directly.

1501
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,680
Come on in here and help me
clean out these cupboards.

1502
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,028
Come on.

1503
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,277
Troy, what they say down there?

1504
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,670
They ain't said nothing.
I give them $50, they let him go.

1505
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,637
I'll talk to you about it.

1506
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,755
Where Cory?

1507
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,115
He in the house,
helping me clean out these cupboards.

1508
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,240
All right,
tell him to get his butt out here.

1509
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,516
All they want is the money.

1510
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,856
This makes six, seven times,
I done went down there and got him.

1511
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,110
See me coming,
they stick out their hands.

1512
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,953
Yeah, I know what you mean.
That's all they care about, that money.

1513
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,110
They don't care about what's right.

1514
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,951
Nigger, why you got to go
and get some hardwood?

1515
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,315
You ain't doing nothin'
but building a little old fence.

1516
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,311
Get you some soft pinewood.
That's all you need.

1517
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,000
I know what I'm doing.
This outside wood.

1518
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,310
You put pinewood inside the house.

1519
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,472
Pinewood inside wood.
This here the outside wood.

1520
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,710
Now tell me, where the fence gonna be?

1521
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,957
You don't need this wood.

1522
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,519
You can put it up with pinewood,

1523
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,920
and it'll stand as long as
you gonna be here looking at it.

1524
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,496
How you know
how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?

1525
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,192
Hell, I might live forever.

1526
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,874
I'll live longer than old man Horsely.

1527
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,678
That's what Magee used to say.

1528
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,120
Ah, Magee a damn fool.
Now you tell me who you ever heard of

1529
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,237
gonna pull their own teeth
with a pair of rusty pliers?

1530
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,435
They're old folks.

1531
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,440
My granddaddy used to
pull his teeth with pliers.

1532
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,640
They ain't had no dentists
for colored folk back then.

1533
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,274
Well, get clean pliers.
You understand? Clean pliers.

1534
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,920
Sterilize them.
Besides, we ain't living back then.

1535
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,158
All he had to do
was go down to Doc Goldblum's.

1536
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,800
I see where you
and that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta,

1537
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,396
see where you all done got tight.

1538
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,754
What you mean, "got tight"?

1539
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,936
I see where you be laughing
and joking with her all the time.

1540
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,679
I laugh and joke with 'em all.
Bono, you know me.

1541
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,960
Ain't the kind of laughing and joking
I'm talking about.

1542
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,879
How you doing, Mr. Bono?

1543
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,736
Cory, get that saw from Bono
and cut some wood.

1544
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,194
He talking about wood too hard to cut.

1545
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,872
Stand back there, Jim.

1546
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,296
Let the young boy
show you how it's done.

1547
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,470
He's sure welcome to it.

1548
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,479
Whew-ee!

1549
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,112
Look at that.
Big, ol' strong boy, looks like Joe Louis.

1550
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,799
Hell, I must be getting old

1551
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,960
the way I'm watching that boy
whip through that wood.

1552
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,429
I don't see why Mama
wants a fence around no yard no way.

1553
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,595
Damn if I know, either.

1554
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,750
I don't know what the hell
she keeping out with it.

1555
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,831
She ain't got nothing nobody wants.

1556
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,957
Some people build fences
to keep people out,

1557
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,349
and other people build fences
to keep people in.

1558
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,629
Rose wants to hold on to you all.
She loves you.

1559
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,352
Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody
to tell me my wife loves me.

1560
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,910
Cory, go in the house
and see if you can find the other saw.

1561
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,678
Where's it at?

1562
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,558
I said find it.
Look for it till you find it.

1563
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,750
What is that supposed to mean?
Want to keep us in?

1564
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,435
Troy,

1565
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,789
I done known you seem like
damn near my whole life.

1566
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,633
You and Rose both.
I known both of you all for a long time.

1567
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,188
I remember when you met Rose.

1568
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,238
When you was hitting them baseball
out of the park.

1569
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,830
A lot of them old gals was after you then.

1570
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,916
You had the pick of the litter.

1571
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,595
When you picked Rose,
I was happy for you.

1572
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,870
That's the first time
I knew you had any sense.

1573
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,152
I said, "My man Troy
knows what he's doing.

1574
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,391
"I'm gonna follow this nigger,
he might take me somewhere."

1575
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,836
I been following you, too.

1576
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,469
I done learned a whole heap of things
about life watching you.

1577
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,191
I done learned how to tell
where the shit lies.

1578
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,595
How to tell it from the alfalfa.

1579
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,788
You done learned me a lot of things.

1580
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,474
Showed me how to not
make the same mistakes.

1581
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,757
To take life as it come along,

1582
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,513
keep putting one foot
in front of the other.

1583
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,353
Rose is a good woman, Troy.

1584
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,634
I know she a good woman.

1585
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,280
I've been married to her for 18 years.

1586
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,673
What you got on your mind, Bono?

1587
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,149
I just say she's a good woman,
like I say anything.

1588
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,616
I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.

1589
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,096
You just say she a good woman
and leave it hanging out there like that?

1590
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,296
Why are you telling me
she a good woman?

1591
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,153
- She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.
- Uh-huh.

1592
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,440
You saying I don't measure up?

1593
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,788
That's what you tryin' to say.

1594
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,656
I don't measure up
'cause I'm seeing this other gal.

1595
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,880
I know what you tryin' to say.

1596
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,070
I know what Rose means to you, Troy.

1597
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:20,118
I'm just tryin' to say
I don't want to see you mess up.

1598
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,314
Yeah.

1599
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,673
Well, I appreciate that, Bono.

1600
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,395
If you was messing around on Lucille,
I'd be telling you the same thing.

1601
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,993
That's all I got to say.

1602
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,998
I just say that 'cause I love you both.

1603
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,040
Oh. Yeah.

1604
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,348
You know me.
I wasn't out there looking for nothing.

1605
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,874
You can't find
a better woman than Rose, I know that.

1606
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,033
But it seems like
this woman just stuck on to me

1607
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,320
where I can't shake her loose.

1608
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,016
I done wrestled with it
and tried to throw her off,

1609
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,474
but now she stuck on tighter.

1610
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,869
And now she stuck on for good.

1611
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,713
You's in control.
That's what you tell me all the time.

1612
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,552
You responsible for what you do.

1613
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,392
I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.

1614
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,869
As long as it set right in my heart,
then I'm okay.

1615
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,872
'Cause that's all I listen to.
It tell me right and wrong every time.

1616
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,856
And I ain't talking about
doing Rose no bad turn.

1617
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,313
I love Rose.

1618
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,392
She done carried me a long ways,
and I love and respect her for that.

1619
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,629
I know you do.

1620
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,836
That's why I don't want
to see you hurt her.

1621
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,309
But what you gonna do
when she finds out?

1622
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,830
What you got then?

1623
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,319
You try to juggle both of them,

1624
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,152
sooner or later,
you gonna drop one of them.

1625
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,480
- That's common sense.
- I know what you're saying, Bono.

1626
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,196
I been trying to figure a way
to work it out.

1627
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,316
Work it out right, Troy.

1628
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,079
I ain't trying to get all up
between you and Rose's business,

1629
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,355
but work it, so it come out right.

1630
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,670
Hell, I get all between
you and Lucille's business.

1631
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,718
And when you gonna buy that woman
that refrigerator she be wanting?

1632
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,472
And don't tell me
you ain't got no money.

1633
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,834
I know who your banker is.

1634
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,496
Mellon don't need that money
as bad as Lucille wants that refrigerator.

1635
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,520
I know that.

1636
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,776
- Tell you what I'll do.
- What?

1637
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,791
When you finish building
this fence for Rose,

1638
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,518
I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.

1639
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,478
You done stuck your foot
in your mouth now.

1640
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,192
Hey, nigger, where you going?

1641
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,508
I'm going home.

1642
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,431
I know you don't expect me
to help you now.

1643
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,953
I'm protecting my money.

1644
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,352
I want to see you
put that fence up by yourself.

1645
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,032
That's what I want to see.

1646
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,350
You'll be here
another six months without me.

1647
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,799
Nigger, you ain't right.

1648
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,552
When it come to my money,

1649
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,712
I'm right as fireworks
on the Fourth of July.

1650
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,279
We gonna see.

1651
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,952
You better get out your bank book!

1652
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,080
What they say down there?
What's happening with Gabe?

1653
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,118
I went down there
and got him out. Cost me $50.

1654
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,633
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1655
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,154
Judge set up a hearing for him
in three weeks

1656
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,834
to show cause
why he shouldn't be recommitted.

1657
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,592
What'd you say?
What'd you tell the judge?

1658
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,638
I told him I'd take care of him.

1659
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,336
It didn't make no sense
to recommit the man.

1660
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,759
He stuck out his big greasy palm,

1661
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,513
told me to give him $50
and take him on home.

1662
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,511
Where's he at now?
Where'd he go off to?

1663
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,576
Gone about his business.
He don't need nobody to hold his hand.

1664
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,856
Well, I don't know, seem like
that would be the best place for him.

1665
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,880
To put him in a hospital.

1666
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,554
I know what you gonna say,
but that's what I think would be best.

1667
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,280
Man had his life ruined
fighting for what?

1668
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,656
Now, they want to take him
and lock him up?

1669
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,989
Let him be free.
Man ain't bothering nobody.

1670
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,909
Everybody got
their own way of looking at it, I guess.

1671
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,268
Come on, get your lunch.

1672
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,016
I got some lima beans
and cornbread in the oven.

1673
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,176
Come on, get somethin' to eat.

1674
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,840
Ain't no sense in you fretting over Gabe.

1675
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,216
Rose, I got something to tell you.

1676
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,073
- Wait till I put the food on the table.
- Rose...

1677
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,753
Now, I don't know how to tell you this.

1678
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,716
And I can't explain it none.

1679
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,951
It just sort of grows on you.

1680
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:29,077
It started off like a little bush,

1681
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,536
next thing you know, it's a whole forest.

1682
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,879
Troy, what is you talking about?

1683
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,757
I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.

1684
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,637
I'm trying to tell you,

1685
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,154
find a way to tell you that...

1686
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,549
I'm gonna be a daddy.

1687
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,995
Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.

1688
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,313
Troy, you ain't telling me this.
You're gonna be what?

1689
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,776
- You're gonna be somebody's daddy?
- Rose...

1690
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,936
You're telling your wife this?

1691
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,995
Now...

1692
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,310
Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!

1693
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,994
I got to wait 18 years
to hear something like this?

1694
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,308
Hey, Rose.

1695
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,595
I got a flower for you.

1696
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,829
That's a rose.
The same rose like you is.

1697
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,273
Thanks, Gabe.

1698
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,760
Troy, you ain't mad at me?

1699
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,273
Them bad mens
come and put me away.

1700
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,749
- You ain't mad at me?
- No. No, I ain't mad at you.

1701
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,751
Eighteen years,
and you want to come with this?

1702
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,519
See what I got?
Got a brand-new quarter.

1703
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,509
Rose, it's just that...

1704
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,800
Ain't nothing you can say, Troy.
Ain't no explaining it.

1705
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,519
The fella that give me this quarter
had a whole mess of 'em!

1706
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,108
I'm gonna keep this quarter
till it stops shining.

1707
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,800
Gabe, go on up front now.
I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.

1708
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,989
Go on. I'll get you a piece.

1709
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,799
Say, Rose, you know,
I was chasing hellhounds,

1710
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,792
and them bad mens come
and get me and take me away.

1711
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,871
Troy helped me.
He come down there and told them

1712
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,872
they better let me go
before he beat them up!

1713
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,234
Yeah, he did!

1714
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,595
Go up front now, Gabe.
I'll get you some watermelon.

1715
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,159
Them bad men is gone now.

1716
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,595
Okay. Rose gonna give me
some watermelon,

1717
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,148
the kind with the stripes on it.

1718
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,073
Why, Troy?

1719
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,068
Why?

1720
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:26,598
After all these years,
you come dragging this in to me now?

1721
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,830
It don't make no sense at your age.

1722
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,308
I could've expected this
10, or 15 years ago, but not now.

1723
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,830
Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.

1724
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,196
I done tried to be everything
a wife should be.

1725
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,474
Everything a wife could be.

1726
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,834
I've been married 18 years,

1727
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,434
and now,
I got to live to see the day you tell me

1728
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,035
you been seeing another woman
and done fathered a child by her.

1729
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,193
And you know I never wanted
no half-nothing in my family!

1730
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,474
My whole family is half.

1731
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,391
Everybody got different
fathers and mothers

1732
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,959
and my two sisters and my brothers.

1733
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,632
You could hardly tell who's who.

1734
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,536
Could never sit down
and talk about Papa and Mama.

1735
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,199
It was always your papa,
your mama, my papa, my mama.

1736
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,794
And I ain't never wanted that
for none of my children!

1737
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,256
And now,
you want to drag your behind in here

1738
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,456
and tell me something like this!

1739
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,496
Stop it now. You ought to know.
It's time for you to know.

1740
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,238
Well, I don't want to know, God damn it!

1741
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,309
Rose?

1742
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,830
I just can't make it go away.
It's done now.

1743
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,833
I can't wish the circumstances
of the thing away.

1744
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,594
And you don't want to, either.

1745
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,477
Maybe you want to wish me
and my boy away.

1746
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,913
Maybe that's what you want.

1747
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,508
Well, you can't wish us away.

1748
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,556
I got 18 years of my life invested in you.

1749
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,736
You ought to have stayed upstairs
in my bed where you belong.

1750
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,354
Now, listen to me.
We can get a handle on this thing.

1751
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,280
We can talk this out,
come to an understanding.

1752
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,588
All of a sudden it's "we."

1753
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,016
Where was "we" at
when you were down there,

1754
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,416
rolling around
with some godforsaken woman?

1755
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,736
"We" should've
come to an understanding

1756
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,336
before you started making
a damn fool of yourself!

1757
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,800
You're a day late and a dollar short

1758
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,296
when it comes to
an understanding with me.

1759
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:39,077
Rose, it's just that
she gives me a different idea.

1760
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,751
A different understanding about myself.

1761
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,310
I can step out of this house
and get away from the pressures

1762
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,816
and the problems, be a different man.

1763
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,696
I ain't got to worry about
how I'll get the roof fixed,

1764
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,358
or pay the bills, or...

1765
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,759
I can just

1766
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,314
be a part of myself
I ain't never been before.

1767
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,670
What I want to know is...

1768
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,668
What I want to know

1769
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,439
is do you plan to continue seeing her?

1770
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,829
That's all you can say to me.

1771
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,758
I could sit up in her house and laugh.

1772
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,195
You understand what I'm saying?

1773
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,874
I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.

1774
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,190
It reaches all the way down
to the bottom of my shoes.

1775
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,474
Rose, I...

1776
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,678
I can't give that up.

1777
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,696
Well, maybe you ought to go on
and stay down there with her,

1778
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,392
if she's a better woman than me.

1779
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,296
It ain't about nobody being
a better woman, or nothing.

1780
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,639
Rose, you ain't to blame.

1781
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,995
A man couldn't ask
for a better wife than you've been.

1782
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,559
I'm responsible for it.

1783
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,198
I done locked myself into a pattern,

1784
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,336
trying to take care of you all,
that I forgot about myself.

1785
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,998
Well, what the hell was I there for?

1786
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,638
That was my job, not somebody else's.

1787
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,837
Rose, listen to me.
I done tried all my life to live decent.

1788
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,832
To live a clean, hard, useful life.

1789
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,071
I try to be a good husband to you,
in every way I know how.

1790
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,355
Maybe I come into the world backwards,
I don't know,

1791
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,750
but you're born with two strikes on you
before you come to the plate.

1792
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,960
You got to guard it closely,

1793
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,679
always looking for the curveball
on the inside corner.

1794
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,398
You can't afford a called strike.

1795
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,880
You can't let nothing get past you.

1796
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,036
If you're going down,
you're doing down swinging.

1797
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,839
Everything lined up against you!

1798
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,033
What you gonna do?

1799
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,074
I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.

1800
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,354
When I found you and Cory
and a halfway decent job, I was safe.

1801
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,635
Couldn't nothing touch me!

1802
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,153
I wasn't gonna strike out no more.

1803
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,696
I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.

1804
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,075
I wasn't gonna
lie in the street with a bottle of wine.

1805
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,438
I was safe. I had me a family,
a job.

1806
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,313
I wasn't gonna get that last strike.

1807
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,958
I was standing on first base,

1808
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,056
waiting for one of them boys
to knock me in, to bring me home.

1809
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,877
You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.

1810
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,456
Then I saw the gal,
she firmed up my backbone.

1811
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,438
I got to thinkin' that if I tried,
maybe I could steal second.

1812
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,056
- You understand?
- You should've held me tight.

1813
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,470
- You should've grabbed me and held on.
- I stood on first base for 18 years,

1814
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,949
and I thought, well,
God damn it, go on for it!

1815
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,429
We ain't talking about baseball!

1816
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,896
We talking about you going off
and laying up with another woman,

1817
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,976
then bringing it home to me.

1818
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,336
That's what we're talking about.
We're not talkin' about no baseball!

1819
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,616
Rose, you're not listening to me.

1820
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,518
I'm trying to explain it to you
the best way I know how.

1821
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,354
It's not easy for me to admit

1822
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,552
that I've been standing
in the same place for 18 years!

1823
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,154
Well, I've been standing with you!

1824
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:32,279
I've been right here with you, Troy!
I got a life, too.

1825
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,592
I gave 18 years of my life
to stand in the same spot as you!

1826
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,636
Don't you think
I ever wanted other things?

1827
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,836
Don't you think
I had dreams and hopes?

1828
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,514
What about my life? What about me?

1829
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,200
Don't you think it ever crossed my mind
to want to know other men?

1830
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,592
That I wanted to lay up somewhere
and forget about my responsibilities?

1831
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,272
That I wanted someone
to make me laugh,

1832
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,396
so I could feel good?

1833
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,550
You're not the only one
who's got wants and needs.

1834
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,591
But I held on to you, Troy.

1835
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:02,832
I took all my feelings,
my wants and needs and dreams,

1836
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,717
and I buried them inside you.

1837
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,075
I planted a seed
and watched and prayed over it.

1838
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,152
I planted myself inside you
and waited to bloom!

1839
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:14,074
And it didn't take me no 18 years
to realize the soil was hard and rocky,

1840
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,276
and it wasn't never gonna bloom!

1841
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,272
But I held on to you, Troy.
I held you tighter.

1842
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,351
You was my husband.

1843
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,079
I owed you everything I had.

1844
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,833
Every part of me I could find to give you.

1845
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,748
And upstairs in that bedroom,
with the darkness falling in on me,

1846
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,953
I gave everything I had
to try and erase the doubt

1847
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,713
that you wasn't the finest man
in the world.

1848
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,473
And wherever you was going,
I was gonna be there with you,

1849
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,034
because you was my husband.

1850
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,472
'Cause that's the only way
I was gonna survive as your wife.

1851
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:52,395
You always talking about what you give
and what you don't have to give.

1852
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,798
But you take, too, Troy.

1853
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,519
You take
and don't even know nobody's giving.

1854
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,656
You say I take and don't give.

1855
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,829
Troy, you're hurting me.

1856
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,176
- Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!
- I gave you everything I got.

1857
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,256
Don't you tell that lie on me.

1858
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,679
- Mama!
- Don't you tell that lie!

1859
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,273
Troy, you're hurting me!

1860
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,233
Troy! Troy!

1861
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,315
All right. That's strike two.

1862
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:17,358
You stay away from around me, boy.
Don't you strike out.

1863
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,031
You're living with a full count.

1864
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,397
Don't you strike out!

1865
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,711
Troy, I want to talk to you.

1866
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,430
All of a sudden?

1867
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,948
After all this time,
you want to talk to me, huh?

1868
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,576
You ain't wanted
to talk to me in months.

1869
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,976
You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.

1870
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,479
You didn't want no parts of me then.

1871
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,111
What you want to talk to me about now?

1872
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,239
Tomorrow's Friday.

1873
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,719
I know what day tomorrow is.

1874
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,056
You think I don't know
tomorrow's Friday?

1875
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,296
My whole life, I ain't done nothing
but look to see Friday coming,

1876
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,696
and you got to tell me it's Friday.

1877
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,233
I want to know if you're coming home.

1878
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,234
I always come home, Rose.
You know that.

1879
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,776
Ain't never been a night
I ain't come home.

1880
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,438
That ain't what I mean, and you know it.

1881
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:29,076
I wanna know if you're coming
straight home after work.

1882
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,118
I figured I'd cash my check,
hang out at Taylors' with the boys.

1883
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,376
Maybe play a game of checkers.

1884
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,994
Troy, I can't live like this.
I won't live like this.

1885
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,536
You're living on borrowed time with me.

1886
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,616
Been going on six months now,
you ain't been coming home.

1887
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,676
I come home every night.
Every night of the year.

1888
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,228
That's 365 days.

1889
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,354
I want you to come home
tomorrow after work.

1890
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:57,035
Rose, I don't mess up my pay.
You know that.

1891
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,997
I take my pay, I give it to you.

1892
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,436
I don't have no money
but what you give me back.

1893
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,671
I just want a little time to myself.

1894
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,949
A little time to enjoy life.

1895
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,917
What about me?
When's my time to enjoy life?

1896
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,136
I don't know what to tell you, Rose.
I'm doing the best I can.

1897
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,256
You ain't been comin' home from work,

1898
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,696
but time enough
to change your clothes and run out.

1899
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,711
You wanna call that
the best you can do?

1900
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,352
I'm going over to the hospital
to see Alberta.

1901
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,152
She went into the hospital
this afternoon.

1902
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:26,676
Looks like she might have the baby early.

1903
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,232
I won't be gone long.

1904
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,456
Well, you ought to know.
They went over to Miss Pearl's

1905
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,708
and got Gabe today.

1906
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,554
She said you told them to
go ahead and lock him up.

1907
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,599
I ain't said no such thing.
Whoever told you that is telling a lie.

1908
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,456
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing
but telling a big, fat lie.

1909
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,416
She ain't had to tell me.
I read it on the papers.

1910
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,416
- What'd it say, huh?
- It said you told them to take him.

1911
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,896
Oh, well, then they screwed that up,
just like they screw up everything.

1912
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,216
I ain't worried about
what they got on that paper.

1913
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,216
It say the government sends
part of the check to the hospital,

1914
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,309
the other part to you.

1915
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,096
I got nothing to do with that,
if that's the way it works.

1916
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,240
I don't make up the rules...

1917
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,656
You did Gabe just like you did Cory.

1918
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,936
You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory,

1919
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,656
but you signed for Gabe!
You signed that paper!

1920
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,511
I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman.

1921
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,256
Hell, the only thing I signed
was the release form.

1922
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,280
Hell, I can't read,

1923
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,736
I don't know what they had
on that paper.

1924
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,600
I ain't signed nothing
about sending Gabe away.

1925
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,896
I said send him to the hospital,
you said let him go free.

1926
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:17,920
Then you went down there

1927
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,536
and you signed him to the hospital
for half his money.

1928
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,936
You went back on yourself, Troy.
You're gonna have to answer for that.

1929
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,576
You just been over there
talking to Miss Pearl.

1930
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,216
She just mad 'cause she ain't gettin'
Gabe's rent money, that's all it is.

1931
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,736
Troy, I seen where you signed the paper!

1932
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,936
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1933
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,633
And what she doing got papers
on my brother for, anyway?

1934
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,401
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing
but telling a big, fat lie,

1935
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,311
and I'm gonna tell her about it, too!

1936
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,794
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1937
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,879
Say...

1938
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,910
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1939
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,079
Troy.

1940
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,913
- Troy.
- Mmm?

1941
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,400
Hmm?

1942
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,998
That was the hospital.
Alberta had the baby.

1943
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,034
Yeah? What she have?
What is it?

1944
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,599
It's a girl.

1945
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,998
I...

1946
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,270
I better get on down there to see her.

1947
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,120
Troy.

1948
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,113
I got to go see her now, Rose.
That's only right.

1949
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,716
What's the matter?
Baby all right, ain't it?

1950
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,997
Alberta died having the baby.

1951
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,231
She died? You say she's dead?

1952
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,719
Alberta dead?

1953
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,869
They said they done all they could.
They...

1954
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,753
They couldn't do nothing for her.

1955
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,758
Oh, what about the baby? Baby all right?

1956
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,750
They say it's healthy.

1957
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,513
I wonder who's gonna bury her.

1958
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,635
She had a family, Rose.

1959
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,256
She wasn't living in the world by herself.

1960
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,555
I know she wasn't living
in the world by herself.

1961
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,096
Next thing you wanna know
if she had any insurance.

1962
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,496
You ain't got to talk to me like that!

1963
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,696
First thing that jumped out your mouth.
"Who's gonna bury her?"

1964
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,336
Like I'm finna take that task
on for myself.

1965
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,351
I'm your wife. Don't push me away.

1966
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,874
I ain't pushing nobody away.
Just give me some space.

1967
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,190
Just give me some room to breathe.

1968
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,471
All right, Mr. Death.

1969
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,673
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

1970
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,320
I'm gonna take

1971
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:40,433
and build me a fence
around this yard, see?

1972
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,515
I'm gonna build me a fence
around what belongs to me.

1973
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,672
And then I want you to stay
on the other side.

1974
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,496
You stay over there
till you're ready for me,

1975
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,112
then you come on.

1976
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:58,035
Bring your army, bring your sickle,
bring your wrestling clothes.

1977
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,270
I ain't gonna fall down
on my vigilance this time.

1978
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,920
You ain't gonna...

1979
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,190
You ain't gonna
sneak up on me no more.

1980
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,108
When you ready for me,

1981
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,555
when the top of your list
say Troy Maxson,

1982
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,710
then you come on up
and knock on the front door.

1983
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,756
Ain't nobody else
got nothing to do with this.

1984
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,717
This between you and me.

1985
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,197
Man to man!

1986
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:33,794
You stay on the other side of that fence
till you ready for me!

1987
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,994
Then you come up
and knock on that front door

1988
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:41,709
anytime you want!

1989
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,751
I'll be ready for you.

1990
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,696
Bob Clemente with four home runs

1991
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,154
and 24 runs batted in.

1992
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,714
Rose?

1993
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,878
I'm standing here
with my daughter in my arms.

1994
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,951
Now,

1995
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:57,077
she ain't but a wee,

1996
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,515
bitty little old thing.

1997
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,068
She don't know nothing
about grownfolk business.

1998
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,639
She innocent,

1999
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,875
and she ain't got no mama.

2000
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,991
What you telling me for, Troy?

2001
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,112
Well...

2002
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,229
Guess we'll go sit out here on the porch.

2003
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,796
A man's got to do what's right for him.

2004
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,795
I ain't sorry for nothing I done.

2005
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,113
It felt right in my heart.

2006
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,151
What you smiling at?

2007
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,994
Your daddy's a great, big ol' man.

2008
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:20,478
Got these great big ol' hands,
but sometimes he's scared.

2009
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:24,710
And right now,
your daddy's scared 'cause we

2010
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,113
sitting out here on the porch
and ain't got no home.

2011
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,456
Oh, I've been homeless before.

2012
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:35,315
I ain't never had no baby with me,
but I've been homeless.

2013
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,997
You just be out there on the road
by your lonesome

2014
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,877
and just see one of them trains
coming by

2015
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,598
and just kinda go, say...

2016
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:51,150
Please, Mr. Engineer
Let a man ride the line

2017
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:58,950
Please, Mr. Engineer
Let a man ride the line

2018
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:07,752
I ain't got no ticket
Please

2019
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,719
Let me ride the blinds

2020
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,390
She's my daughter, Rose, and my...

2021
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:23,994
My own flesh and blood.
I can't deny her.

2022
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:27,197
No more than I can deny them boys.

2023
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,595
You and them boys is my family.

2024
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,675
You, them, and this child
is all I got in this world, so...

2025
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,430
I guess what I'm saying is,

2026
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:52,197
that I'd appreciate it
if you was to help me take care of her.

2027
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,359
Okay, Troy,

2028
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,028
you're right.

2029
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,790
I'll take care of your baby for you.

2030
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:16,951
'Cause, like you say,

2031
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,914
she innocent.

2032
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,870
You can't visit the sins
of the father upon the child.

2033
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,110
Motherless child's got a hard time.

2034
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,912
From right now,
this child's got a mother.

2035
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,750
But you're a womanless man.

2036
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,831
I'm coming in, everybody going out.

2037
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,514
I'm taking this cake
down to the church for the bake sale.

2038
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,920
Lyons was by to see you.
He stopped by to pay you your $20.

2039
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,400
It's laying right here on the table.

2040
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,629
Well, here go this money.

2041
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,840
Well, put it in there on the table, Troy.
I'll get it.

2042
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:29,240
What time you coming back?

2043
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,696
Ain't no use in you studyin' me.
Don't matter what time I come back.

2044
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,736
I just asked you a question, woman.
Can't I ask you a question?

2045
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,936
Troy, I don't want to get into it.

2046
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,376
Now, your food is in there on the stove.

2047
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,680
All you got to do is heat it up.

2048
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,354
And don't be eating the rest
of them cakes in there now.

2049
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:41,475
I'm coming back for them.

2050
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,949
We're having a bake sale
at the church tomorrow.

2051
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,829
Hey, Troy.

2052
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,673
What's happening, Bono?

2053
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:47,513
I just thought I'd stop by to see you.

2054
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,431
Wasn't no one at the house,
so I figured...

2055
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,760
What you stop by to see me for?

2056
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,593
You ain't stopped by
in a month of Sundays.

2057
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,511
Hell, I must owe you
some money or somethin'.

2058
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,115
Well, since you got your promotion,
I can't keep up with you.

2059
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,713
- Hmm.
- Used to see you every day.

2060
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,360
Now I don't even know
what route you working.

2061
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,440
Keep switching me around.

2062
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:08,877
Got me out there in Green Tree now,
hauling white folk garbage.

2063
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,712
- Green Tree, huh?
- Yeah.

2064
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:11,835
You lucky.

2065
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,354
At least you ain't got to be
lifting them barrels.

2066
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,635
- Damn if they ain't getting heavier.
- Mmm.

2067
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,280
I'm gonna put in my two years
and call it quits.

2068
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,396
Yeah, I'm thinking about retiring myself.

2069
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,791
Oh, you got it easy.

2070
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,759
You could drive for another five years.

2071
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:28,955
Mmm. Ain't the same, Bono.

2072
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:32,392
It ain't like working
the back of the truck.

2073
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:36,393
You feel like you working by yourself.
Ain't nobody to talk to.

2074
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:40,473
Naw, I'm thinking about retiring.
How's Lucille?

2075
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,035
She all right.

2076
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,953
Her arthritis get to acting up
on her sometimes.

2077
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,396
Saw Rose on the way here.
She going down to the church, huh?

2078
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,512
Yeah, she took up going down there.

2079
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,751
All them preachers looking
to fatten their pockets.

2080
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,309
Got some gin in here.

2081
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:59,597
No, thanks.
I just stopped in to say hello.

2082
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,671
Well, you can take a drink, nigger.
I ain't...

2083
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,069
I ain't never known you
to say no to a drink.

2084
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,388
Oh...

2085
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,176
You ain't got to work tomorrow.

2086
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,156
I just stopped by.

2087
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,816
I'm thinkin' of going over to Skinner's.

2088
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:13,149
We got us a domino game
going over his house every Friday.

2089
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,878
Nigger, you can't play no dominoes.

2090
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,758
I used to whup you
four games out of five.

2091
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:22,352
Well, that learned me.
I'm getting better.

2092
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,200
Yeah?

2093
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,428
That's all right.

2094
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,268
Look here, I got to be getting on.

2095
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:38,679
Stop by sometime, huh?

2096
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,876
Yeah, I'll do that, Bono.

2097
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,635
Lucille told Rose you, uh,
got her that new refrigerator.

2098
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:52,157
Yeah. Rose told Lucille
you had finally built your fence,

2099
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:54,077
so, I figured we'd call it even.

2100
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,550
I knew you would.

2101
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:57,640
Yeah.

2102
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,074
Okay.

2103
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:03,360
I'll be talking to you.

2104
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:06,159
Yeah, good to see you, Bono.

2105
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,878
I'm gonna stop over.

2106
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:09,791
Yeah. Okay, Troy.

2107
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:23,230
Hear it ring! Hear it ring!

2108
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,999
Had an old dog
His name was Blue

2109
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:39,114
You know Blue was mighty true

2110
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:49,113
You know Blue
Was a good old dog

2111
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,433
Blue treed a possum
In a hollow log

2112
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:14,312
Old Blue died
And I dug his grave

2113
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:19,153
Let him down
With a golden chain

2114
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,393
Every time old Blue barked

2115
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,833
Blue treed a possum
In Noah's Ark

2116
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,275
I got to get by.

2117
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,634
Say what? What you say?

2118
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,195
You in my way. I got to get by.

2119
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,831
You got to get by where?

2120
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,871
This is my house. Bought and paid for.

2121
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:56,952
Took me 15 years,
and if you want to go in my house

2122
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,976
and I'm sitting on the steps,
you say, "Excuse me,"

2123
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,040
like your mama taught you.

2124
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:01,296
Come on, Pop, I gotta get by.

2125
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,536
You just gonna walk over the top of me?

2126
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,312
I live here, too.

2127
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,868
You just gonna walk over
the top of me in my own house?

2128
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,228
I ain't scared of you.

2129
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,016
I ain't asked you
if you was scared of me.

2130
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:11,960
I asked you was you finna
walk over the top of me

2131
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:13,560
in my own house?
That was the question.

2132
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:14,999
You ain't gonna say, "Excuse me."

2133
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,296
You just gonna walk over the top of me.

2134
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,376
If you want to put it like that.

2135
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,480
How else am I gonna put it?

2136
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,596
I was walking by you
to go into the house,

2137
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,496
'cause you sitting on the steps drunk,
singing to yourself.

2138
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,801
- You can put it like that.
- Without saying, "Excuse me"?

2139
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,513
I asked you a question.
Without saying, "Excuse me"?

2140
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,856
I ain't got to say "Excuse me" to you.

2141
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,871
You don't count around here no more.

2142
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:37,160
Oh?

2143
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,280
Oh, I see.
I don't count around here no more.

2144
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,896
You ain't got to say
"Excuse me" to your daddy.

2145
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,593
All of a sudden, you done got so grown,

2146
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:47,274
where your daddy don't count
around here no more, huh?

2147
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,918
Around here in his own house and yard

2148
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,960
that he done paid for
with the sweat of his brow?

2149
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,759
All of a sudden, you done got so grown

2150
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,256
that your daddy
don't even count around here.

2151
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,872
What, you gonna take over?

2152
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:58,360
Huh?

2153
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,398
You gonna take over my house?
You gonna wear my pants?

2154
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,436
You gonna go in there
and stretch out on my bed?

2155
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,838
You ain't got to say, "Excuse me,"

2156
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:08,920
because your daddy
don't count around here no more.

2157
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,076
- Is that right?
- That's right.

2158
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:12,673
You always talking this dumb stuff.

2159
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:13,936
Now why don't you just get out my way?

2160
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:16,633
I guess you got someplace to sleep.

2161
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:20,793
Something to put in your belly.
You got that?

2162
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,400
Huh?

2163
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,235
'Cause that's what you need.
You got that?

2164
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,320
Huh?

2165
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:30,040
You don't know what I got!
You ain't got to worry about what I got!

2166
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,878
You right.

2167
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,592
You 100% right.

2168
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:37,434
I done spent the last 17 years
worrying about what you got.

2169
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,238
Now, it's your turn, see?

2170
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,390
I tell you what we do.

2171
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:45,400
You grown.
We done established that.

2172
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,593
You a man.
Now, let's see you act like one.

2173
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,520
Turn your behind around
and walk out this yard.

2174
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:53,640
And when you get out there in the alley,
you can forget about this house, see.

2175
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:54,999
'Cause this is my house.

2176
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,753
You go on and be a man
and get your own house.

2177
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,115
You can forget about this,
'cause this is mine.

2178
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,668
You go on and get yours,
'cause I'm through doing for you.

2179
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,877
What you done for me.
What you ever give me?

2180
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:08,396
Them feet. Them bones.
That pumping heart, nigger!

2181
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,360
Give you more than anybody else
ever gonna give you.

2182
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,595
You ain't never gave me nothing!

2183
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,336
You ain't never done nothing
but hold me back,

2184
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,715
afraid I was gonna be better than you!

2185
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:21,431
All you ever did
was try and make me scared of you.

2186
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,476
I used to tremble every time
you called my name.

2187
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:26,279
Every time I heard
your footsteps in this house.

2188
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:28,256
Wondering all the time,
"What's Pop gonna say if I do this?

2189
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,536
"What's he gonna say if I do that?

2190
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,391
"What's Pop gonna say
if I turn on the radio?"

2191
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,096
And Mom, too!
She tries, but she's scared of you.

2192
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,536
Leave your mama out of this.
Your mama ain't got...

2193
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,256
I don't know how she stands you
after what you did to her!

2194
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,696
I told you, leave your mama outta this.

2195
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,392
What are you gonna do?
Give me a whupping?

2196
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,471
You can't whup me no more!
You're too old!

2197
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:42,629
You're just an old man.

2198
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:44,120
Nigger!

2199
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,151
That's what you are.
You're just...

2200
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:51,153
You're just another nigger
on the street to me.

2201
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,629
- You're crazy! You know that?
- Yeah, go on.

2202
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,995
Get on away from around me.
You got the devil in you.

2203
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,336
You are just a crazy old man!
Talkin' about I got the "devil" in me!

2204
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,395
Yeah. I am crazy.

2205
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,357
If you don't get the hell out of my yard,

2206
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,476
I'm gonna show you how crazy I am.

2207
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,120
Now, go on,
get the hell out of my yard!

2208
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,388
This ain't your yard!

2209
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,096
You took Uncle Gabe's money
he got from the Army

2210
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,696
to buy this house, when you put him out!

2211
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:12,109
Get your black ass out of my yard!

2212
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,633
I ain't going nowhere!

2213
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,400
Come on, put me out,
I ain't scared of you.

2214
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,032
- That's my bat.
- Come on.

2215
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,792
- Put my bat down.
- Come on, put me out!

2216
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,035
What's the matter?
You so bad. Put me out!

2217
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:26,271
You're gonna have to use it.

2218
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,839
You want to draw that bat back on me,
you're gonna have to use it.

2219
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Come on!

2220
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:34,593
Come on!

2221
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,955
You're gonna have to kill me.

2222
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:40,191
You want to draw that bat back on me,

2223
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,158
you're gonna have to kill me.

2224
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:45,829
Come on.

2225
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,951
Come on. Then I'll show you.

2226
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:57,869
Come on!

2227
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:30,988
Huh?

2228
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:39,150
Go on, get away from around my house.

2229
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:49,920
Go on.

2230
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,711
Tell Mama I'll be back for my things.

2231
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:55,712
They'll be on the other side
of that fence!

2232
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,712
Can't taste nothing.

2233
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,350
I can't taste nothing.

2234
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:29,109
Hallelujah!

2235
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,553
Hallelujah.

2236
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,479
Hallelujah.

2237
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,389
I can't taste nothing no more.

2238
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:59,593
Come on.

2239
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:02,670
It's between you and me now.

2240
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,755
Come on. Anytime you want.

2241
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:12,275
Come on. I be ready for you.

2242
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,753
But I ain't gonna be easy.

2243
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,348
Raynell?

2244
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:32,271
- Ma'am?
- What you doing?

2245
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:33,475
Nothing.

2246
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:36,120
Get in here and get dressed.
What are you doing?

2247
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,872
See if my garden growed.

2248
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:39,616
I told you it ain't gonna grow overnight.

2249
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:40,789
You got to wait.

2250
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,759
Yeah, but it look like
it ain't never gonna grow, Mama. Dag!

2251
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,794
I told you, a watched pot never boils.

2252
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,472
This ain't even no pot, Mama.

2253
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,616
Get in here and get dressed.

2254
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:51,840
This ain't no morning
to be playing around, you hear me?

2255
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,393
Yes, ma'am.

2256
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,036
Bye, garden.

2257
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:22,756
Hi. I bet your name is Raynell.

2258
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:24,560
Mmm-hmm.

2259
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:26,673
Is your mama home?

2260
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,356
Mama, there's a man down here!

2261
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,200
Mama!

2262
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,273
Cory?

2263
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:37,828
Cory.

2264
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:40,352
Cory. Cory!

2265
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:44,628
- Oh! Lord have mercy!
- Cory.

2266
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,239
Lookee here, y'all.

2267
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,355
Aww, looka here.

2268
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:57,079
Done got all grown up.

2269
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:58,798
Don't cry, Mama. What you crying about?

2270
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:01,348
I'm just so glad you made it.

2271
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,431
Hey, Lyons.
How you doing, Mr. Bono?

2272
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,631
Look at you, man, look at you.

2273
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:08,553
Don't he look good, Rose?
Got on them corporal stripes.

2274
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:10,039
What took you so long?

2275
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:11,216
You know how the Marines are, Mama.

2276
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:12,576
They got to get
all their paperwork straight

2277
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:13,880
before they let you do anything.

2278
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:17,270
Well, I'm sure glad you made it.
They let Lyons come.

2279
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,776
Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.

2280
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,736
They don't know
if they're gonna let him out or not.

2281
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,239
I talked to them a little while ago.

2282
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,629
A corporal
in the United States Marines.

2283
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,870
Your daddy knew you had it in you.

2284
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,877
He used to tell me all the time.

2285
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,911
Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?

2286
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,629
Yeah, he reminds me of Troy
when I first met him.

2287
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:37,153
Ah, say, Rose,

2288
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,549
Lucille's down at the church
with the choir.

2289
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:41,511
I'm gonna go get
the pallbearers lined up.

2290
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:42,834
I'll be back to get you all.

2291
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,308
Thanks, Jim.

2292
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,400
See you, Mr. Bono.

2293
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,552
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

2294
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,592
Cory, look at Raynell.

2295
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:53,715
Ain't she precious?

2296
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,400
She's gonna break a whole lot of hearts.

2297
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,056
Say hello to your brother.
This your brother, Cory.

2298
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,435
- You remember Cory?
- No, ma'am.

2299
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,656
Naw, she don't remember me, Mama.

2300
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:03,240
Oh, well, we talk about you.
She heard us talk about you.

2301
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,354
This is your brother, Cory.
Say hello.

2302
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,759
- Hi.
- Hi.

2303
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,068
So, you're Raynell.

2304
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:10,280
Mmm-hmm.

2305
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:11,600
Mama's told me a lot about you.

2306
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:15,056
Come on, let me fix you some breakfast.
Keep up your strength.

2307
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:16,149
I ain't hungry, Mama.

2308
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:19,113
You can fix me something, Rose.
I'll be in there in a minute.

2309
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,696
You sure you don't want nothing, Cory?

2310
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:22,278
I know they ain't feeding you right.

2311
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:23,816
No, Mama, thanks.
I don't feel like eating.

2312
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,909
I'll get something later.

2313
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,833
Raynell, get up there
and get that dress on like I told you.

2314
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:43,237
I always knew you was gonna
make something out of yourself.

2315
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,474
Your head was always
in the right direction.

2316
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,549
So,

2317
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:54,958
you gonna stay in?

2318
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,315
Make it a career?
Put in your 20 years?

2319
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:01,315
I don't know.
I got six already. I think that's enough.

2320
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:04,995
Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.

2321
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:06,911
Ain't nothing out here.

2322
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:11,313
I guess Rose told you
about what happened with me.

2323
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:16,559
They got me down at the workhouse.

2324
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:19,359
I thought I was being slick
cashing other people's checks.

2325
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,432
How much time you doing?

2326
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,748
They give me three years.

2327
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,991
I got that beat now.
I ain't got but nine more months.

2328
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:36,749
It ain't so bad.

2329
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:39,838
You learn to deal with it
like anything else.

2330
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,080
"You got to take the crookeds
with the straights,"

2331
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:47,357
that's what Papa used to say.

2332
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,035
He used to say that when he struck out.

2333
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:53,315
I seen him strike out
three times in a row,

2334
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:57,632
and the next time up,
he hit the ball over the grandstand.

2335
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:00,678
Right out there in Homestead Field.

2336
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:05,108
He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats.
He wanted to hit it over everything.

2337
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,312
Then after the game,

2338
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:14,396
he had 200 people standing around,
waiting to shake his hand.

2339
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:20,394
You got to take the crookeds
with the straights.

2340
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,832
Papa was something else.

2341
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,150
You still playing?

2342
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:30,912
Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.

2343
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,070
We got some fellas down there.
We got us a band.

2344
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:37,152
We gonna try to stay together
when we get out, but...

2345
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,309
Yeah.

2346
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,910
I'm still playing.

2347
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,096
Still helps me get out of bed
in the morning.

2348
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:45,314
As long as it do that,

2349
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:48,836
I'm gonna stick with it,
try to make some sense out of it.

2350
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:51,434
Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.

2351
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,831
Let me get in here
and get these eggs, man.

2352
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,956
Get ready to go bury Papa.

2353
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,279
How you doing?

2354
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,359
You doing all right?

2355
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:27,474
Hi.

2356
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:28,959
Hi.

2357
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:31,473
You used to sleep in my room?

2358
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,751
Yeah, that used to be my room.

2359
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:38,232
That's what Papa call it. "Cory's room."

2360
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:42,471
Got your football in the closet.

2361
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,632
Raynell. Get up there, get dressed,
and put them good shoes on.

2362
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,070
Mama, can I just wear these?
Them others hurt my feet!

2363
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:50,096
Well, they're just gonna have
to hurt your feet for a while.

2364
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,256
You ain't said they hurt your feet

2365
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:52,656
when you went down
to the store and got 'em.

2366
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:54,830
They didn't hurt then.
My feet done got bigger.

2367
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:56,478
Don't give me no back talk!

2368
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:59,398
Get up there, get dressed,
and put them good shoes on.

2369
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:09,913
Ain't too much changed.

2370
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,639
He still got that rag tied to the tree.

2371
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,911
He was out here swinging that bat.

2372
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:22,313
I was just getting ready
to go back in the house.

2373
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:26,319
He swung that bat and just fell over.

2374
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:32,674
Seem like, when he swung it,
he stood there with this grin on his face.

2375
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:40,272
Then he just fell over.

2376
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:44,736
They carried him
down there to the hospital,

2377
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,876
but I knew there wasn't no need.

2378
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:52,989
- Why don't you come on in the house?
- Mama, I got something to tell you.

2379
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:57,511
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I got to tell you.

2380
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:59,631
I'm not going to Papa's funeral.

2381
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:05,794
Boy, hush your mouth.

2382
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:07,871
That's your daddy you talking about!

2383
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:10,160
I don't want to hear
that kind of talk this morning.

2384
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:11,639
I done raised you to come to this?

2385
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,096
You standing there
all healthy and grown,

2386
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:14,936
talking about
you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?

2387
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:17,155
- Mama, listen...
- I don't want to hear it, Cory!

2388
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,616
Just get that thought out of your head.

2389
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:21,279
I've got to say no to him.
One time in my life, I got to say no.

2390
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,873
I don't got to listen to that!

2391
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,616
Now, I know you and your daddy
ain't seen eye to eye,

2392
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:28,076
but I don't have to listen
to that kind of talk this morning.

2393
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,720
Disrespecting your daddy
ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.

2394
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:32,616
You gotta find some way
to come to that on your own.

2395
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:35,108
Not going to your daddy's funeral
ain't gonna make you a man.

2396
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:41,072
The whole time I was growing up,
living in his house,

2397
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:44,072
Papa was like a shadow
that followed you everywhere.

2398
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:48,071
It weighed on you,
and it sunk into your flesh.

2399
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,716
It would wrap around you and lay there

2400
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,234
until you couldn't tell
which one was you anymore.

2401
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:57,512
That shadow just diggin' into your flesh!

2402
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:59,909
Trying to crawl in.
Trying to live through you.

2403
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:05,516
Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson
staring right back at me.

2404
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:08,751
Hiding under the bed, in the closet.

2405
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,877
I'm just saying I got to find a way
to get rid of that shadow, Mama.

2406
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,190
You just like him.
You got him in you good.

2407
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:16,656
- Don't tell me that, Mama.
- You Troy Maxson all over again.

2408
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:19,194
I don't want to be Troy Maxson!

2409
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,112
I just want to be me.

2410
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:25,112
You can't be nobody
but who you are, Cory.

2411
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:28,272
That shadow wasn't nothing
but you growing into yourself.

2412
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,496
You either got to grow into it,
or cut it down to fit you,

2413
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,795
but that's all you got to make a life with.

2414
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,873
That's all you got to measure yourself
against the world out there.

2415
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:40,792
Your daddy wanted you to be
everything he wasn't,

2416
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,393
and at the same time,

2417
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,233
he wanted you to be everything he was.

2418
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:47,278
Now, I don't know
if he was right or wrong,

2419
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:48,475
but I do know

2420
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:51,552
he meant to do more good
than he meant to do harm.

2421
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:56,393
Sometimes, when he touched,
he bruised,

2422
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:00,436
and sometimes,
when he took me in his arms, he cut.

2423
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:09,390
When I first met your daddy,

2424
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:11,753
I thought,

2425
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,072
"Here is a man
I can lay down with and make a baby."

2426
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:21,592
That's the first thing
I thought when I seen him.

2427
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,989
I thought, "Rose Lee,

2428
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:26,796
"here's a man
you can open yourself up to

2429
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:29,075
"and be filled to bursting!

2430
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:35,355
"Here's a man that can
fill up all them empty spaces

2431
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:38,079
"you been tipping around the edges of."

2432
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:46,352
When your daddy
walked through the house,

2433
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,112
he was just

2434
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:51,635
so big.

2435
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,032
He filled it up!

2436
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:00,393
That was my first mistake.

2437
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:02,789
Not to make him
leave some room for me.

2438
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:05,072
But

2439
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,868
I wanted a house I could sing in.

2440
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:14,551
And that's what your daddy gave me.

2441
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:18,713
I didn't know to keep up his strength,
I had to give up little pieces of mine.

2442
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:23,916
I took on his life as mine
and mixed up the pieces,

2443
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,992
so you couldn't hardly tell
which was which.

2444
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:32,991
It was my choice. My life.

2445
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:36,072
And I didn't have to live it like that,

2446
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:40,296
but that's what life offered me
in the way of being a woman,

2447
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:41,514
and I took it.

2448
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:46,513
I grabbed it with both hands.

2449
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:49,672
And by the time
Raynell came into the house...

2450
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:59,037
I didn't want to make my blessings
off of nobody's misfortune,

2451
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:03,952
but I took on to Raynell like she was

2452
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:07,191
all them babies I wanted and never had.

2453
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:12,432
Like I'd been blessed
to relive a part of my life.

2454
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:18,711
And if the Lord see fit
to keep up my strength,

2455
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,793
I'm gonna do her exactly
how your daddy did you.

2456
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:31,153
I'm gonna give her
the best of what's in me.

2457
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:42,160
Mama!

2458
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,390
Reverend Tolliver on the phone.

2459
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:03,160
Hi.

2460
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:06,680
Hi.

2461
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,475
You in the Army or the Marines?

2462
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:10,913
Marines.

2463
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:15,351
Papa said it was Army. You know Blue?

2464
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:17,113
Blue? Who's Blue?

2465
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:19,510
Papa's dog,
what he sing about all the time.

2466
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:24,794
Hear it ring!
Hear it ring!

2467
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,954
Had an old dog
His name was Blue

2468
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:31,870
You know Blue was mighty true

2469
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:35,269
You know Blue
Was a good old dog

2470
02:08:36,440 --> 02:08:38,396
Blue treed a possum
In a hollow log

2471
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:41,392
From that you know
Blue was a good old dog

2472
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:43,789
Hear it ring! Hear it ring!

2473
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:47,313
Blue treed a possum
Out on a limb

2474
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:49,231
Blue looked at me
and I looked at him

2475
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:52,394
Grabbed that possum
Put him in a sack

2476
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,311
Blue stayed there
Till I came back

2477
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:57,314
Old Blue's feet was
Big and round

2478
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:59,470
Never let a possum
Touch the ground

2479
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:02,230
Old Blue died
And I dug his grave

2480
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,709
I dug his grave
With a silver spade

2481
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:07,469
Let him down
With a golden chain

2482
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,471
And every night
I call his name

2483
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,831
Go on, Blue, you good dog you

2484
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:12,920
Come on.

2485
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,150
Go on, Blue
You good dog you

2486
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:17,994
Blue laid down
and died like a man

2487
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,436
Blue laid down and died

2488
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:24,990
Blue laid down
And died like a man

2489
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:28,993
Now he's treeing possums
In the Promised Land

2490
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:32,514
I'm gonna tell you this
Just to let you know

2491
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:35,354
Blue's gone
Where the good dogs go

2492
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:40,510
Blue's gone
Where the good dogs go

2493
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:46,269
Cory, we're getting ready
to leave now!

2494
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:56,193
Go upstairs and put your shoes on
like Mama told you,

2495
02:09:56,360 --> 02:09:59,193
so we can get ready
to go to Papa's funeral.

2496
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:02,350
- Okay. I'll be back.
- Mmm.

2497
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:13,635
Rose!

2498
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:17,879
Hey, Rose!

2499
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:20,390
- Gabe?
- I'm here! I'm here, Rose!

2500
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,391
Hey, Rose, I'm here!

2501
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:24,072
- Lyons, lookit here!
- See, Rose?

2502
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:25,991
I told you. I told you they'd let him come.

2503
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:28,136
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

2504
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:30,310
Hey! Hey, Rose, it's time!

2505
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:33,756
It's time to tell Saint Peter
to open the Gates.

2506
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:40,516
You ready, Troy? Troy, you ready?

2507
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:43,512
I'm gonna tell Saint Peter
to open the Gates.

2508
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:45,875
You get ready now.

2509
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:17,508
Troy!

2510
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:19,519
Troy.

2511
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:18,359
That's the way that go.
