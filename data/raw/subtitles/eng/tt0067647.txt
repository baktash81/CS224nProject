1
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:35,680
The window that once glowed
with light is now darkened

2
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:40,200
A sign that my beloved is unwell

3
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,560
Her sister comes to
the window and tells me:

4
00:02:53,402 --> 00:02:57,600
"Your beloved is dead and buried"

5
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:07,640
She always lamented that she slept alone

6
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:16,640
Now she sleeps in the arms of Death.

7
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,280
After you, please.

8
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:54,840
No, Mr. Chaucer, after you, please

9
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,000
It was nothing, sir.

10
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,635
Nothing, my eye! You hurt me bad!

11
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:05,308
You have a nose like a bludgeon

12
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,760
l was joking. l hope
l did not offend you

13
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,520
Between a jest and a joke
many a truth can be told

14
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,160
I’m so skilled in the art of weaving...

15
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,160
...I can undo all those
bitches in Ypres and Ghent

16
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:35,640
In all modesty I say... Oh,
shit... begging your pardon...

17
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:42,360
...there's none better than me
for gathering collections in church

18
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,720
And if any woman should try
to get the better of me...

19
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,480
I’ll make her wish she'd never been born

20
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:54,280
I'll eat her alive!

21
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:59,880
Three times l went to Jerusalem

22
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,600
Then Rome, San Jacopo di
Compostela and Cologne

23
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,600
I’m no spring chicken
but l know how to have fun

24
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,920
...and how to make people laugh

25
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,680
Between you and me, lads, l
also know a few love potions

26
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:26,200
Because, my darlings, l
know all the old dances

27
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,880
Good folks, here are pardons
brought for you hot from Rome

28
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:45,920
A piece of the Virgin's veil,
a scrap of Saint Peter's sail...

29
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:52,640
...from when he used to sail, before
Christ taught him to walk on water

30
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:57,640
Radix malorum est cupiditas...
cupidity is the root of evil

31
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:00,880
Don't be miserly. Come, buy

32
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:08,548
Nowhere in the Gospels does
it say we should remain virgins

33
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:13,000
What were the genitals made
for? Not to lie there dormant

34
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:18,040
And don't tell me they
were made just for pissing

35
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,726
Ladies and gentlemen...

36
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:28,284
- Quiet, give him a chance!
- ...your attention, please.

37
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:33,840
Gentle folks, truly l welcome you...

38
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,080
...from the bottom of my heart

39
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:42,320
In all these years I
never saw a finer company

40
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:46,040
You take the path to Canterbury

41
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:50,237
God be with you and the holy
blessed martyrs will reward you

42
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:56,409
Still, as experience is my teacher,
I know that in such a long journey...

43
00:06:56,609 --> 00:07:02,761
...you may become dreadfully
bored. Therefore accept my advice.

44
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:08,296
To shorten the way, each of you will
tell a tale on the road to Canterbury

45
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:11,080
l shall be the judge, and your guide

46
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:18,529
I'll accompany you at my own expense,
until you reach Canterbury. Agreed?

47
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,960
l have resolved...

48
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,080
...to be a wedded man

49
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:40,120
l am convinced no other life is
as worthy; marriage is paradise

50
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:45,120
When a man is old and grey he
should take a fair young wife...

51
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:47,600
...to beget an heir...

52
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,937
...and live a life of joy and pleasure

53
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,920
Everyone agrees on this

54
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Few disagree, of whom
Theophrastus was one...

55
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,120
...but who gives a damn
if he enjoyed telling lies?

56
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,920
Arrange for my marriage promptly,
for l do not want to wait

57
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,240
But, dear friends, on no
account will l take an old wife

58
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,960
What l think is right

59
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,240
...is old fish and young flesh

60
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:29,120
I'll have no woman of thirty:
that is but straw and fodder

61
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:33,320
A woman trained in many
schools is but half a scholar...

62
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,598
...and l don't like scholars

63
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
Get stuffed!

64
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,385
What pretty figures, pretty faces

65
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:11,791
By God, what pretty neighbours

66
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,760
It's only a question of choosing

67
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:18,230
Hey, why not?

68
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:20,911
Perhaps May?

69
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:30,457
Better not...

70
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,256
Not bad!

71
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:37,435
Yes...

72
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:04,949
Hey brothers, come quickly!

73
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:09,301
No longer need you search
on foot and horseback

74
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:14,200
l have made my decision,
l have found my mate...

75
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,187
...the foundation of my happiness

76
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:20,777
l have chosen May

77
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:24,850
Make a marriage contract

78
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,720
Hands and bonds... my heart needs peace

79
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,146
My brother, l feel in my heart...

80
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:28,157
...profound pity that
tonight I must do harm to her

81
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,040
I fear she will not sustain my assaults

82
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,360
God forbid that l should use...

83
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,160
...all my might

84
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,600
l wish these guests were gone

85
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:51,695
Stop eating, let dancing commence

86
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:56,462
Father, that's enough

87
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:01,077
Hurry up, Father

88
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,160
Father, hurry

89
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:18,680
Go away, all of you

90
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,000
Alas, l must trespass
against you, my spouse...

91
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,600
...and make you suffer
before our moment of pleasure

92
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:43,013
But remember that no
workman in the world...

93
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:46,296
...can do his best work hastily

94
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:49,880
We have plenty of time to play

95
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,640
All the time we need... my little wife

96
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,240
We have the law of
God and man on our side

97
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,080
l am ready

98
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:35,289
l did it!

99
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:30,600
I want to rest, it is almost day. I
am a little weary, twice in a night

100
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,600
You'll see, my Columbine,
how fair a garden

101
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,640
I doubt that the author of "Romance
of the Rose" could tell its beauty

102
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,280
Now summer has come again,
and only in this garden...

103
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,800
...I will pay my dent as a husband

104
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
No one but I can enter this garden

105
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,640
No one holds the key, no one
but myself alone, understand?

106
00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:25,560
I carry it with me always

107
00:18:26,600 --> 00:19:24,040
Come, little wife,
lie beside me... there

108
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,120
Somebody help me! I am
blind, you imbeciles!

109
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:42,464
May, help me, I am blind

110
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,000
May, where are you?

111
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,520
There you are

112
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,320
Where are you going? From
now on I'll hold on to you

113
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:26,720
I can't see you, but
I'll never let you go

114
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,360
Everyone get out! I don't want anybody

115
00:20:46,600 --> 00:21:17,720
Leave me alone with May. Go, all of you

116
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,880
Lead me to my garden, my lovely garden

117
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:32,280
I shall never see it again

118
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,080
Poor January, led off to be deceived

119
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,400
But I forbid it, for I shall
give him back his sight...

120
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,000
...so that he can see her treachery

121
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,520
You can if you wish, but if you do
I shall give her the power of words

122
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,640
Don't be angry, I give
up. But I gave my word...

123
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,920
...and kings must keep their word

124
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,400
I am a queen, and like
you I will keep my word

125
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:14,400
And you, my dear, must
not be angry with me

126
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,800
Are we there, my love?

127
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,201
Come now, lie on the
grass, my sweet little wife

128
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,624
Body sweeter than
wine, doe-eyed delight

129
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:37,211
My belly...

130
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:39,840
I so long to eat those lovely
mulberries up on the tree

131
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,160
Sweet, fruitful wife, there is
no boy here to climb the tree

132
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,040
Never mind, come over here

133
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Careful, my dear. Do not hurt yourself

134
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:06,600
Yes, that's it. Very good.
I'd give my blood to help you

135
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,160
Are the mulberries ripe?

136
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,400
Eat your fill, my child

137
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:36,360
My eyes! I can see!

138
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,400
What are you doing, slut?

139
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,240
You can see

140
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,080
It's a miracle!

141
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm so happy

142
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,920
I saw you! That man was having you!

143
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,480
I saw it with my own
eyes, up in the tree

144
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,560
You are confused, sir

145
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,680
Your eyesight never was good

146
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,520
Jealousy made you see phantoms

147
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,120
Husband, your sight is restored.
Let us thank God for this miracle

148
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,120
Yes, little wife,
let's forget everything

149
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,760
And may the Lord forgive me
if ever I thought ill of you

150
00:24:45,520 --> 00:26:18,760
You are even more beautiful than
I remembered, my sweetest May

151
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,240
Listen... hold on...

152
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,600
Virgin Mary

153
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,880
Behind the market, in the fish alley...

154
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:46,440
...no, not the old market,
but at the new one I found two

155
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,120
My friend, for your wife's sake
I'll cross you out of our black book

156
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,880
I am your friend. How much did we say?

157
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,440
Three, four hundred... take it all

158
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Don't denounce me, for the love of God

159
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,800
You swear by Christ you haven't
a copper coin to give me?

160
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,080
It's the truth, my lord, I swear

161
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,800
My friend, I do this for your sake

162
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,800
But I am a poor man, have mercy on me

163
00:29:43,920 --> 00:30:23,440
Ask the judge for mercy;
you'll burn on a griddle

164
00:30:24,880 --> 00:31:52,560
Griddle cakes!

165
00:31:52,600 --> 00:33:25,400
Just a minute, we're coming!

166
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,640
Excellent, my friend, you've
done yourself much honour

167
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,080
I have new tasks for you

168
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,600
Good morning sir, and good health

169
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,400
Welcome. Do you ride for today?

170
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,600
No, nearby to collect rent

171
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,400
Are you a rent collector? So am I

172
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,880
But I'm a stranger to this country.
Shall we be friends, brothers even?

173
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,640
Why not? On my word of honour

174
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,440
Give me your hand

175
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:42,200
Let us swear to be brothers
until the day we die

176
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,840
I swear

177
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,800
Brother, where is your district...

178
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,840
...if some day I should
come and need you?

179
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,960
Far away, in the northern country

180
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,840
I hope that soon you
will visit me up there

181
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,640
As we're rent collectors, teach me
a trick or two to earn more money

182
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,440
Forget conscience or sin, speak
frankly, brother to brother

183
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,480
My wages are so small and
I have to manage somehow

184
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,360
So I live by extortion and blackmail

185
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,800
So do I. Without them
I could not survive

186
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,400
I know neither pity nor conscience

187
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,320
We are made to be together. Tell
me, brother, what is your name?

188
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,840
Brother, do you really want to know?

189
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,400
I am the Devil and I dwell in Hell

190
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,920
I ride to earn a living, just as you do

191
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,840
You cheat without scruples, just as I do

192
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,720
I will keep you good
company until you forsake me

193
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,040
Even if you're the Devil, I'll keep
our bargain. We're both out for profit

194
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,880
We could share what we make

195
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,160
That is, you take all
that men want to give you

196
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,440
Agreed. You'll take your
part while I shall take...

197
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:32,600
...everything that
mankind wants to give me

198
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,400
Here lives an old woman who'd rather
break her neck than part with a penny

199
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,816
I'll get twelve pence from her,
under threat of summoning her to court

200
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:46,083
She's not guilty of the smallest of sins

201
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:53,240
Learn how we do things in these parts

202
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,520
What can I do for you gentlemen?

203
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:04,264
On pain of excommunication you must
appear before the archdeacon tomorrow

204
00:37:04,464 --> 00:37:09,040
Answer to the court for certain
things... you know what I mean

205
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,240
Twelve pence, and I'll
see that you're acquitted

206
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,080
Where will I find twelve
pence, in the name of Holy Mary?

207
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,120
In all my life I've never
had, even seen twelve pence

208
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,440
Have pity on me, I'm poor and wretched

209
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,400
Pay up, or I'll take our new
pitcher to settle our debt

210
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,080
I paid your fine when you
first cuckolded your husband

211
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,720
Liar! I've never been
summoned to court in my life

212
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,200
And I've never been wicked with my body

213
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,240
Devil take your body and my pitcher too

214
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,680
Come now, dear mother

215
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,520
Did you really mean what you said?

216
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,640
Yes, Devil take him alive, and
the pitcher, unless he repents

217
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,040
No, you old witch, don't bank on it

218
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:28,840
I won't repent for what I take
from you, no matter what happens

219
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,400
Brother, don't take it ill

220
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,840
This pitcher and your
body are mine by right

221
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,120
This very night you
shall come with me to Hell

222
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:59,720
There you shall learn more of our
secrets than a Master of Theology

223
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,280
Get out, you wretched scoundrel!

224
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,440
You've finished scrounging around!

225
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,720
Don't show your face here again!

226
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,000
Stop there!

227
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,600
I'll get you, rotten little thief!

228
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,040
You got the sack? You are
a disgrace to your family

229
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,040
I'm sure your mother had
you by an Italian, not me

230
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,720
Go to bed at once! No dinner for you!

231
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,920
Eat, son. Don't let your father see you

232
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:36,240
Be a good boy. Find another job tomorrow

233
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,280
Promise me, in the name of God

234
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,040
Mister, have you a job for me?

235
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,800
I do need a boy. I'll try you out

236
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,360
Shine the eggs

237
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,647
What have you done?

238
00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:29,160
It's nothing, Master

239
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,640
It's a miracle. Let me see

240
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,640
What an omelette!

241
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,200
I must go out for a moment

242
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,600
Stay here and work.
Serve the customers well

243
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,320
Why not come and play with us?

244
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,440
Can I join your game?

245
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,880
Scoundrel! You're sacked!

246
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,920
Better cast forth the rotten
apple before it rots all the rest

247
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,160
You're right

248
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,360
Perkin, come and meet my good wife

249
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,080
She's a whore

250
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:30,625
Perkin the Reveller

251
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:32,720
I declare you under arrest

252
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,080
You'll be tried in London

253
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,000
Geoffrey Chaucer!

254
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,440
Yes, my wife

255
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,640
Robin, come here!

256
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,960
Alison, if I can't have you now,
my passion for you will kill me

257
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,000
Love me, or I swear I'll die

258
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,040
Let go of me, Nicolas,
let go or I'll scream

259
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,640
Keep your hands off me

260
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:39,640
Alison, I want not only your
body. I love you with all my soul

261
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,680
I'll be your servant, your
slave, if you love me a little

262
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,680
In that case, if you swear it...

263
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,200
I swear

264
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,720
Then I shall give you my love

265
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,089
When?

266
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:58,800
My husband is jealous. Guard
your secret, or I'll be dead

267
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,760
Bring me a basket of food for three
days. I'll be locked in my room

268
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,400
Do just as I tell you. Don't worry

269
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,280
A student wouldn't be worth much
if he couldn't outwit a carpenter

270
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,320
Once more

271
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,840
Eggs, meat, fruit...
Enough food for three days

272
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,960
Make pliable that which is rigid

273
00:53:52,600 --> 00:54:16,120
For everlasting pleasure

274
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,440
Time to go, Martin

275
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,760
Am I handsome?

276
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:58,160
Oh, Alison, my love

277
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,960
Master Gervase, don't you
ever do anything but work?

278
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:08,400
When I was your age I liked to give
"incense" to all the parish wives

279
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:37,280
Come on, Absalon, here we go

280
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,981
Alison, do you hear Absalon
singing under our window?

281
00:55:55,181 --> 00:55:58,248
Yes John, I hear it all

282
00:55:58,448 --> 00:56:00,600
The peasecod who
serves as a sacristan...

283
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,920
...and thinks only of decking
himself out and eyeing females?

284
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,400
The very one

285
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,360
They say he minds his words
and is squeamish about farting

286
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,400
Sleep. You must be weary
after your journey to Osney

287
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:29,520
Listen to Absalon,
gurgling like a nightingale

288
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,760
You're sure you haven't
seen our student all day?

289
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:44,067
Yes, I sent Jill to enquire at
the door, but there was no answer

290
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,790
Robin, let's go and see

291
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,720
Help us, Saint Frideswide

292
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,360
She's made of stone

293
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,840
By Saint Thomas, I feel
sorry for our dear Nicholas

294
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:13,280
I shall go in and shake
him out of his meditations

295
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,400
May I come in?

296
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:28,200
What's the matter? Look
down and think of our Lord

297
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,360
I'll make the sign of the cross to
protect you from elves and spirits

298
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:39,640
Jesus Christ and Saint
Benedict protect this house

299
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,160
Shall the whole world vanish so soon?

300
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,920
By my astrology I have
found out that on Monday next

301
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:56,960
...a rain will fall so fierce that
Noah's flood was only half as great

302
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:01,440
Within an hour mankind will be drowned

303
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,440
Alas, my wife. Will
my poor Alison drown?

304
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,800
Is there no remedy?

305
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:16,160
Yes. Follow my advice and I
promise I shall save her, you and I

306
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,640
Bring me a kneading-trough
or a brewer's tub

307
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,080
We need one for each of us

308
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,760
See they're big enough to
float. And food for a day

309
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,120
The rain will stop and
retire the next morning

310
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,640
Send away your servants Robin and Jill

311
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,440
When you've found tubs,
hang them high to the roof

312
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,640
Put an axe in each, so we can cut
the ropes when the water comes...

313
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,640
...and float like lords, safe and
sound, as did Noah and his wife.

314
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,400
You and your wife
must keep well apart...

315
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,440
...for woe betide any man who
commits carnal sin in this night

316
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,520
Go to work now, and God be with you

317
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:36,440
Quickly, let's go on board

318
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,120
That's enough. Now shush!

319
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,080
Absalon, come here

320
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:48,760
The carpenter hasn't been seen all
day. Your girl's alone in her bed

321
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:54,120
Then I'll run there

322
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,000
Let's go

323
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,960
- Get your smock off.
- No, I want to see you

324
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,840
You first. I want to see it

325
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,680
You lucky devil, Absalon

326
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,960
Alison, it's me, Absalon

327
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,640
What are you doing, honeycomb sweet?

328
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,760
Alison, my fair bird, my sweet
cinnamon, wake up, speak to me

329
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,640
It's Absalon

330
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,360
He's tried to win me with many gifts

331
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:39,720
Sweet wine, hydromel
beer brewed with spices...

332
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,640
...pasties of the sweetest
fruits, wafers hot from the stove

333
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,880
And as I'm a city girl, money too.

334
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,960
My love, I'm fluttering
like a turtle dove

335
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,920
You fool! Go away, because I
love another man better than you

336
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,520
True love is always ill-fated

337
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:09,240
If I cannot hope for
more, give me just a kiss

338
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,800
If I do, will you go?

339
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,560
Certainly, my love

340
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,280
Then lick your lips, I'm coming

341
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,320
You'll die laughing

342
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,360
Quick, lest the neighbours see

343
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,480
I am a lord, for after
this I dare hope for more

344
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,640
What have you done,
Alison? You'll pay for it!

345
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,960
- Master Gervase
- Not abed, Absalon?

346
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,840
Has some girl set you on your toes?

347
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:19,160
Lend me that poker from the
fire, I'll bring it back at once

348
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,320
Take it, but why do you want it?

349
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,200
I'll tell you tomorrow

350
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,800
Alison, it's me again,
your Absalon, my love

351
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,960
What now?

352
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,760
I've brought you a golden
ring my mother gave me

353
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,160
It's yours for another kiss

354
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,000
It's my turn now

355
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,600
Leave it to me

356
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,360
Alison, where are
you? Just one more kiss

357
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,080
Speak, so I know where you are

358
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,320
Water, for the love of God!

359
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,480
My God, it's Noah's flood!

360
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,800
Husband, come on!

361
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,920
You know what women are like

362
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,920
The more you deny it, the more
we want it. Are you finished?

363
01:05:50,440 --> 01:06:10,360
I can't stay here at your beck and call

364
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:17,440
Mary, fetch some water for your master

365
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,800
What a lovely arse!

366
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,960
Now, good neighbour

367
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,880
This is Mr. Jenkins, my new
boarder, a student at Oxford

368
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:17,560
The pleasure is all mine. I think
I have seen you somewhere before

369
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:35,400
Who knows where?

370
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,280
What a fine, young stud

371
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,600
But truly, as all my husbands say...

372
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:48,200
...I have the best little pussy
to be found in the city of Bath

373
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,640
But you are married, if I'm not mistaken

374
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,600
I'm never without plans
for weddings and the likes

375
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,000
If you really want to
know, I think he's silly

376
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,480
That mouse has only one hole to hide in

377
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:11,280
I've agreed to go to the
procession with him tomorrow

378
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,960
Oh, my sweet husband, beloved husband!

379
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:46,160
Why are you leaving me?

380
01:09:50,320 --> 01:11:38,040
Never again

381
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,400
I want to speak to you

382
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,920
Speak, then

383
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,680
You have bewitched me, I can't deny it

384
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,000
I dreamt of you all night

385
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:10,120
You tried to kill me as
I lay down on my back...

386
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,960
...and my bed was covered in blood

387
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,680
You have bewitched me

388
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,800
So, you'll have to marry me

389
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:24,400
Marry? But I'm too young

390
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,600
You see, my husband croaks his last...

391
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:34,920
...and those who know such things
agree it's a propitious dream

392
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,760
Because blood...

393
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,920
...means gold

394
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:36,600
Alice, my hat, how do I look?

395
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,520
Jenkins, will you take
this woman here present...

396
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,640
...as your wedded wife by the
sacred rite of our Mother Church?

397
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:52,800
Alison, do you take this man here
present to be your wedded husband...

398
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:04,600
And this is for my dearly
beloved fifth husband to pee in

399
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:28,240
I hope I won't regret giving
you all the lands and rents...

400
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:35,400
...left me by four husbands before you

401
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,360
In this book it's written...

402
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,920
And just what is there...

403
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,400
...for Saint Iodoca's sake?

404
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,760
It tells of Simplicius Gallus...

405
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:05,400
...who left his wife for all time...

406
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,840
...because once he caught her looking...

407
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,600
...outside the door

408
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:16,000
And Eve, with her perversity
has led men to misery...

409
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,840
...and Christ to the Cross

410
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:27,240
Xanthippe, now, who poured a
piss-pot over Socrates' head...

411
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:32,800
...and the saintly man wiped
his head and quietly said:

412
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,520
"Ere thunder stops, down comes the rain"

413
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:47,000
I hate people who dare
tell me my faults...

414
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:51,240
...like you do

415
01:15:51,440 --> 01:16:05,880
You little turd, swine!

416
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,600
You killed me so you
could enjoy in peace...

417
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,240
...all my land and my money

418
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,840
But I forgive you, and before I die...

419
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,840
...come here, give me one more kiss

420
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,600
God, curse me for what I've done

421
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:32,600
Forgive me, I beseech you, my dear

422
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,480
Rector, I do regret this illness...

423
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:03,560
...that keeps me in
bed like a newborn babe

424
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,120
What grieves me more,
they take advantage

425
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:12,280
Simpkin the miller
steals more corn than ever

426
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,960
Sir Rector!

427
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,360
As our Manciple is dying...

428
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,920
...or looks as if he's about to...

429
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:24,800
...will you give us leave to go
and watch the miller grind our corn?

430
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:31,280
Good, you'd like to take on this task

431
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:36,760
We bet the miller won't manage
to cheat us by trickery or force

432
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,920
Then go, gentle students

433
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:54,840
Perhaps it is for the best.
May the good Lord protect you

434
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:14,440
How lovely to gad
about with nothing to do

435
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,400
Why must we be locked in school?

436
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,000
You'd like a good screw, John?

437
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:23,200
We're worse than monks,
arses tight and pricks hard

438
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:30,120
Freedom! Freedom!

439
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,200
Simpkin, how goes it?

440
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:46,040
How fares your pretty
Molly and your wife?

441
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,960
Not bad at all, I see

442
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,800
What a lovely surprise; two
students instead of the Manciple

443
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,360
What brings you here?

444
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,640
Our Manciple is likely to die

445
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,440
So we've come to grind our grain

446
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,720
What will you do while I grind it?

447
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,800
I'll stand by the hopper
and see the corn go in

448
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:13,440
I never saw the hopper go to and fro

449
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:19,240
Do that, John, And I'll see how
the meal falls into the trough

450
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,680
For I'm as poor a miller as you, John

451
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:28,000
Right, lads, get your sack
off the horse and bring it here

452
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:39,120
Milling's a great trade, lads

453
01:19:39,403 --> 01:19:42,640
Make yourself at home, get to work

454
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,400
Start the sails, we're ready

455
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,240
They think they can't be tricked

456
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:54,960
What simpletons

457
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,040
I'll give them bran for
flour, for all their philosophy

458
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,800
The cleverest student
may not be the smartest

459
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,680
The more they think they're
clever, the more I'll rob them

460
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:05,160
There you are, lads, done in a trice

461
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,240
Amusing... the hopper

462
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,240
Interesting... the working of the trough

463
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,240
Where is the horse?

464
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,640
Which way did he go?

465
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,480
He's gone down to the
marshes, fast as the wind

466
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,920
He can't escape us both

467
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,240
Why didn't you put him in the stall?

468
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,640
Wife, we'll fill half
their sack with bran

469
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:47,480
See them run, like children at play

470
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,600
Dobbin, where are you?
Leave the mares alone

471
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:09,080
You're as weary and wet as
two animals out in the rain

472
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,800
We've caught the horse, but we beg for
your hospitality, for the love of God

473
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,360
And our money, of course

474
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,280
Small as it is, share my humble home

475
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:23,040
Still, you students can always
make a yard out of a foot

476
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,000
Have a drink with your
old friend the miller

477
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:59,120
Are you asleep John? Did
you ever hear such a racket?

478
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:03,640
The miller's snoring like a cart-horse

479
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:09,200
You could stick a tail and horns
on him. Who wants to sleep tonight?

480
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:14,480
I'll be damned if I
don't hump that wench

481
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:22,240
I'm entitled to compensation for
the grain that's been stolen from us

482
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,720
Mind the miller doesn't wake
up, or he'll do for us both

483
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,280
He's no more worth than a flea

484
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,400
You get your own back
with his daughter...

485
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,320
...while I stay here
like a sack of potatoes?

486
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,800
In Cambridge they'll say
I was a sissy or a fool

487
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,440
Look at this!

488
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:57,840
What about mine?

489
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:46,640
I'm dying for a pee, I'm bursting

490
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,320
Dammit, the cradle

491
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,040
Where is the cradle?

492
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,120
I nearly got in the wrong bed

493
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:54,280
Husband, it's long since you did
anything like this. What's happening?

494
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,200
Shut up and get on with it

495
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,240
Molly, my love, sweet,
darling little pussy

496
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,640
Well done husband, keep it up

497
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:23,800
Farewell Molly. It's dawn and I must
go, but I'll always be your student

498
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,040
Farewell. But before you
go, I must tell you one thing

499
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,960
When you leave the mill,
just behind the door...

500
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,640
...you'll find a loaf
made with your stolen flour

501
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,240
God keep you safe

502
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,920
Hey, John!

503
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:00,800
Wake up, listen to this

504
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:05,640
Three times I've screwed the
miller's daughter while you laid low

505
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:30,160
You filthy devil, you
traitor! I'll murder you!

506
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,840
Bye-bye, my love

507
01:28:33,080 --> 01:29:09,520
John, it's baked with our flour

508
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,280
Why don't you cut it off?

509
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,400
Whore!

510
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,960
Come on

511
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,400
You bitch!

512
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,080
You're on double time

513
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,040
Just a minute

514
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,120
Tell me you are my queen

515
01:30:48,600 --> 01:31:19,240
My sweet love, my little
pigeon, my sweet little flower

516
01:31:20,226 --> 01:31:25,440
Saint Paul said: God shall destroy
meats for the belly, belly for meats

517
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:33,680
Cook, two fried eggs

518
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,640
Take that, you old bag, sent by the
Devil to light the fires of lust...

519
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,800
...and fan them with your whores

520
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,600
Why don't you piss wine?

521
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:58,240
You'll pay for your drunken
sin in eternal hellfire

522
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:01,040
Lecherous thing is wine

523
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:05,040
Drunkenness is the root
of evil, you drunks

524
01:32:05,527 --> 01:32:09,800
Your face is putrid, your breath
is rancid and your embrace foul

525
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,760
Why aren't you all like Samson?

526
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,960
Read the Bible, Samson
never touched a drop of wine

527
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,640
Rufus, go and piss on your whore's head

528
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:29,160
I've preached against gluttony,
now I warn you about gambling

529
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:35,000
Gambling is the father
of lies and trickery...

530
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:39,800
...the father of
blasphemy against Christ

531
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:45,720
A prince who gambles loses
respect, his prestige as a ruler

532
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,920
Who's dead?

533
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:19,600
Go and ask whose corpse it is

534
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:25,040
No need, sirs, he was
an old friend of yours

535
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:29,080
He was killed this night,
sitting dead drunk on a bench

536
01:33:29,564 --> 01:33:33,600
A thief called Death came and
split his heart with a lance

537
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,040
He left without a word

538
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,000
This Death, is he so dangerous?

539
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:46,520
I'll seek him out. We three are
brothers, we'll avenge our friend

540
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,160
Brothers of the flesh

541
01:33:53,720 --> 01:34:43,160
Get your knives out, we must
find the man who killed our friend

542
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:03,240
God be with you, gentle sirs

543
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,160
Who are you, wrapped up like a friar?

544
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,680
Why live so long to be so old?

545
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:12,600
I cannot find anyone, although
I even walked to India...

546
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:19,160
...in village or town, who would
change his youth for my old age

547
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,080
So, poor and wretched,
I roam the world...

548
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,600
...and ceaselessly upon ground,
which is my, no other's gate...

549
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:31,000
...I knock with my staff and say:

550
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:36,600
"Dear mother, let me in, when
shall my bones lie to rest?

551
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:42,160
"Mother, I'd give all I own
to have a shroud to wrap me in"

552
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:45,560
But she will not grant that mercy

553
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:50,960
Sirs, you are discourteous to speak
roughly. Do not harm an old man...

554
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,720
...as you would not be harmed when old

555
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,720
Go your ways in peace and I
will go mine. God be with you

556
01:36:00,945 --> 01:36:06,320
You'll not get off so lightly. Just
now you talked of this traitor, Death

557
01:36:06,526 --> 01:36:10,080
I bet you are both in league...

558
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:12,920
...to plot to kill the young

559
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:22,920
No, sirs. If you want to find
Death, turn down that crooked path

560
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:28,600
For in the grove I left him under a tree

561
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:34,600
See that oak? Right
there you will find him

562
01:36:35,120 --> 01:37:06,000
God save you and make you mend your ways

563
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:11,080
From now on we can live as rich men

564
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,560
But we can't take it away in daylight

565
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:22,520
One of us fetch bread and wine. We'll
guard it, then carry it away tonight

566
01:37:22,640 --> 01:38:16,480
Dick is the youngest

567
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:27,960
Master Apothecary, I need
poison to kill rats and a polecat

568
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:54,360
I have such a poison that anyone who
takes but a speck will die at once

569
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,760
Bread and three flasks of wine

570
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,520
Get a move on, little bastard!

571
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:40,360
I'm in a hurry. Come on!

572
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,920
Listen, Johnny

573
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,120
We are sworn brothers

574
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:07,480
You go to him as if to struggle in jest

575
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I'll knife him

576
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,120
We kill him and split
the treasure, right?

577
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,720
Here's the wine

578
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:25,760
About time, too

579
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:31,760
Dick, my true love, I always
said you were my best friend

580
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:43,760
What a lovely arse you have

581
01:40:43,880 --> 01:41:39,560
Let's eat and drink, then bury him

582
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,080
What a delicious cake

583
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:05,400
God be benign to you...

584
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,280
...for here I've had many
gifts and many a good meal

585
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:13,960
Brother Tom, I hear you've
given things to other friars, too

586
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,160
You're ill because you're unfaithful

587
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:22,560
You gave oats to that convent,
and chickens and geese to another

588
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,320
Each thing united in itself is
stronger than if it's scattered

589
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:34,800
What is farthing worth
when cut into many parts?

590
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:39,720
I may give you what I
have, none other for sure

591
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:44,880
Tell me, when you say I'm
your brother and you love me

592
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,840
Yes

593
01:42:48,396 --> 01:42:53,400
While I live, I'll give you
the most precious thing I have

594
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:57,480
On one condition: Share
it so that each friar...

595
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:01,080
...may have as much as another

596
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,120
Well then, reach down beneath my
arse, find something I have hidden

597
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,920
Where?

598
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,880
Right beneath my arse

599
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:30,280
Is your hand there? Well then

600
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:41,920
What is it?

601
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:47,200
You must come with me. We are
going to pay a visit to Hell

602
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,360
Why?

603
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:52,280
Up above they decide
to do what they like

604
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:56,920
Close your eyes

605
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:35,720
Keep them tight shut

606
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,760
Hey, Satan!

607
01:44:38,040 --> 01:45:55,520
Lift your tail, show where
you keep friars in Hell

608
01:45:55,521 --> 01:45:55,521
