1
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,905
<i>GIRL:
I live on top of the world,</i>

2
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:52,451
<i>in the never-summer mountains
of Wyoming,</i>

3
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:57,216
<i>8,000 feet closer to the sky.</i>

4
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,917
<i>In my mountains,
when spring finally comes</i>

5
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,426
<i>to save me
from a perpetual winter,</i>

6
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,157
<i>the world comes to life again,</i>

7
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,224
<i>and I remember
what it is I'm here for.</i>

8
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:13,669
<i>I'm the only daughter
in a long line of ranchers.</i>

9
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,638
<i>And when we let our horses out</i>

10
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,767
<i>for the first time
every spring,</i>

11
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,506
<i>I love to watch them
rediscover the world.</i>

12
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:26,074
<i>I can see in them an expression
of my own restless spirit.</i>

13
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,147
<i>Charged with an appetite
for adventure,</i>

14
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,887
<i>they take to the land
without hesitation.</i>

15
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,301
<i>They are pure power.</i>

16
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,102
<i>When I see them running
wild and free,</i>

17
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,478
<i>I often think
of the first horses</i>

18
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,280
<i>and how they were
the true pioneers of America.</i>

19
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,488
Thank you, sir.

20
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,860
Time's up, Katy.

21
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,753
See ya!

22
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:38,846
How'd you do?

23
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,586
Not too bad.

24
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,252
Oh, Katy!

25
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,263
I'm so glad I saw
you before you left.

26
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,299
Can you give this
to Howard for me?

27
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,628
Not a problem.

28
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,430
Thanks.

29
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:54,530
I think I'm gonna be seeing
a lot of you this summer.

30
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,303
- Um, bye, Gracie.
- See you next year, Miranda.

31
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,105
Hey, Jenny,
wait up.

32
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,372
Kathy McLaughlin.

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,469
Yes?

34
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,049
You need to come see
the headmaster.

35
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,028
- Bye! See ya!
- Have a good summer!

36
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,022
Seems like I dropped
you off yesterday.

37
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,806
Daddy.

38
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,052
Let's go home.

39
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,123
Okay.

40
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,386
Howard!

41
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,758
This is so cute, it's crazy.

42
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,955
What do you think?

43
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,293
Too many horses?

44
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,367
Too much?

45
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,527
Too babyish?

46
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,696
- Shall we do it?
- Mom!

47
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,296
I know, I know: chill.

48
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,102
You got it.

49
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,708
She's here!

50
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,576
My baby.

51
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,756
Has anybody seen my daughter?

52
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,290
Mom!

53
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,019
I missed you so much!

54
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,527
How are you, baby? Oh...

55
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,425
Oh, thank you.

56
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,659
Howard!

57
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,306
What?

58
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,176
This is from your fan club.

59
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,120
Hey, you okay?

60
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,747
Oh, he's gonna kill me.

61
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,758
How bad could it be?

62
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,088
- Worse.
- Worse?

63
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,128
- Mm-hmm.
- You can tell me later.

64
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,159
I think your mom will finally
sleep through the night.

65
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,848
Who wants to go runnin'?

66
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,102
Guess I can't avoid
the inevitable.

67
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,877
Got to face him some time.

68
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,999
What is it, Yankee?

69
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,766
Hold on!

70
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,774
Yankee!

71
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,043
You scared it off!

72
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,788
Norbert,
it's your lucky day.

73
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,120
Oh, is that right?

74
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,092
You ready to meet
a miracle on four legs?

75
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,596
Three-year-old stallion
I been saving just for you.

76
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,495
- Something, ain't he, honey?
- Mm, beauty.

77
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,693
Yeah, I can't use
any more quarter horses.

78
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,963
I mean, any profit
in middlemanning horses

79
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,767
is fading faster
than a mountain sunset.

80
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,068
I'll get Howard
to bring her around.

81
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,370
No, now, I don't need him
for the rodeo, either.

82
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,072
Folks are just bored with
calf-roping and barrel racing.

83
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,204
Howard!

84
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,646
Well, here's my check.

85
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,183
Now, just hold on
a minute.

86
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,946
Now, I don't need
any more horses— unless...

87
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,956
you might have something
a little more interesting.

88
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,252
For instance?

89
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,656
<i>Mestengos.</i>

90
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,989
Mustangs.

91
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,563
That's right, wild horses.

92
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,223
More loco the better.

93
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,664
- Morning.
- Hey.
- Morning, hon.

94
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,167
No mustangs around here.

95
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,531
Them four-legged parasites

96
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,571
can strip ten acres
of grassland overnight.

97
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,800
Wild horse racing's
my biggest draw now.

98
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,706
I had a purse last year
near $1 0,000.

99
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,676
Only takes one mustang
foal to ruin a herd,

100
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,441
and then my quarter
horses wouldn't be

101
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,277
pure quarter horse
anymore, would they?

102
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,714
All I'm saying is,
if you had a herd

103
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,376
of mustangs around here,
I'd buy 'em all.

104
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,681
If I had a herd of mustangs
around here, I'd be ruined.

105
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,689
Rob, it's fine. It's fine.

106
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,419
Well...

107
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,725
Nell, it's always
a pleasure to see you.

108
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,729
Thanks.

109
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,096
But as for your
husband here, uh...

110
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,102
gelding would be
my suggestion.

111
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,672
I'll see y'all next year.

112
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,263
Bye.

113
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,876
There goes money
we already spent.

114
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,415
It's easy being a rancher
with good luck.

115
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,007
We'll get by, like always.

116
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,644
Howard, call your sister,
start muckin' the stalls.

117
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,813
Yes, sir.

118
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,317
Mm!

119
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,984
She left before I got up.

120
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,289
She what?

121
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,193
- I'll go do it myself.
- You good boy.

122
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,331
Where's Katy?

123
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,630
She must've
taken Yankee out.

124
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,146
And for your dining
pleasure, gentlemen,

125
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,988
wild gooseberry pancakes
with crème fraiche

126
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,891
and rosemary
chicken sausage.

127
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,987
Well, who lives better than us?

128
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,623
Uh, let me think...
the Rockefellers.

129
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,634
Speaking of which,
you gonna put your brand

130
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,966
on that little schoolgirl
this summer?

131
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,436
You know, Jack,
we stopped

132
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,235
branding our females
a few years back.

133
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,330
Isn't that right, Rob?

134
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,773
Kinda miss it, though.

135
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,640
Well, take it
from an expert—

136
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,373
don't let that little flicka

137
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,448
get away.

138
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,914
The what?

139
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,315
It means, uh, “pretty girl”
or something.

140
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,046
That's what Gus calls Katy.

141
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,712
Oh, he does, does he?

142
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,417
A flicka is just a
young girl— innocent.

143
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,688
You can see in her face
the beauty she will become.

144
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,353
I, uh, I think it's Swedish.

145
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,057
My mama used to call my
little sister flicka.

146
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,929
I just saw a lion
on the mountain.

147
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,094
Dad, it was right there
in front of me.

148
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,502
And this horse, this mustang,
it just ran off the lion...

149
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,801
S-Slow down, Katy. Was it
a lion, or was it a horse?

150
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,638
- It was both. We need to do something.
- Where'd you see this lion?

151
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,338
I don't know where I saw it
exactly, but it was there.

152
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,539
Oh, did you see
Sasquatch, too?

153
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,206
Somebody ask your opinion?

154
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,784
Katy, wait.

155
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,683
Wh-What is this on your face?
You have blood all over you...

156
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,153
It was a lion. Honest.

157
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,486
Well, as long as
we're being honest,

158
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,492
do you have something
you need to tell me?

159
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,585
About school?

160
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,555
- Did you tell him?
- I didn't say anything.

161
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,499
The headmaster faxed this
to us this morning.

162
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,128
Do you want to read it?

163
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,968
Help me understand
something, Katy.

164
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,134
He said he gave you the topic
to your final essay in advance,

165
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,838
and you turned in
a blank paper.

166
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,211
Not one word in two hours
for the exam.

167
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,147
I wrote it in my head.

168
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,720
I just didn't... put it down.

169
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,221
In your head. Hmm.

170
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,258
Wouldn't have made
a difference, anyway.

171
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,850
They just want us to spit back

172
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,588
exactly what
they want to hear.

173
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,129
I have an opinion;
it's just not their opinion.

174
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,994
Well, their opinion is
that you should repeat

175
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,068
the year, just throw it away.
Do you realize what

176
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,035
this family does without so
that you can go to a private school?

177
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,698
Truck's passing 200,000 miles?

178
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,933
Well, let's see if it'll do

179
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,509
another 50.
The barn roof's

180
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,408
about to blow away, we'll patch
it again for the umpteenth time

181
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,310
and all so you can go

182
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,712
to a fancy boarding school.

183
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,215
But I go along
because your mother

184
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,444
wants you to go to college.

185
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,814
Hey, your father
wants it, too.

186
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,321
Well, now we'll have to worry
if she'll even graduate.

187
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,687
Thirteen...

188
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,695
Howard, can't you
see the rot?

189
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,632
Fourteen...

190
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,201
Fifteen...

191
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,497
Come on.

192
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,601
Sixteen.

193
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,902
Dad...

194
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,500
I think we should bring
that mustang in.

195
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,443
Seventeen.
Not now, Katy.

196
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,071
But that lion
can take down a horse, and...

197
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,649
Katy?

198
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,012
I could probably find her again.

199
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,517
No.

200
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,951
I'll help her.

201
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,216
This doesn't concern you,
does it?

202
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,552
No, sir.

203
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,922
If you live on a ranch,
you have to contribute.

204
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,688
That's how we get by.

205
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,320
Here's your summer:

206
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,796
You're gonna do your chores,

207
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,389
you're gonna help your mother,

208
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,092
and you're gonna
write that essay.

209
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,535
Then maybe I can talk 'em
into passing you.

210
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,129
Yes, sir.

211
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,005
And then maybe we'll
talk about horses.

212
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,484
You ready?

213
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,485
Eighteen...

214
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,917
A trim.

215
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,016
Split ends— that's it.

216
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,493
Sweetheart, just a few inches
for the summer.

217
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,894
- No.
- You stop it.

218
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,263
I get better-reasoned arguments
from the hens.

219
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,427
Short hair makes me look
like a boy.

220
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,436
No, that would be impossible.

221
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,665
You're so beautiful.

222
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,471
What's that thing that,
uh, Gus said?

223
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,012
You're a-a... a flicka.

224
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,417
A flicka?

225
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,918
Yeah, a pretty girl.

226
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,489
So, how's your friend Stephanie?

227
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,526
Shallow... vain...

228
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,219
The usual.

229
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,762
Since when?

230
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,853
Since Eric.

231
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,763
Or was it Justin?
Lost track.

232
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,062
Well, you never know
what'll happen.

233
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,000
People can surprise you.

234
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,002
I guess so.

235
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,364
Surprise!

236
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,104
I'm gonna get you!

237
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,441
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

238
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,818
Okay, okay.

239
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,323
Looks good...

240
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,529
Harry, is that you?

241
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,435
You look good, big boy.

242
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,508
Look at you...

243
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:00,305
I'm so happy to see you. I am.

244
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,079
What is she thinking?

245
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,412
There she is.

246
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,620
Whoa, down, boy.

247
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,394
Come on!

248
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,863
Let's get her.

249
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,399
Hyah!

250
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,720
Hyah! Hyah!

251
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,156
Keep 'em moving, boys.

252
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,193
Howard!

253
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,990
Yeah, I got 'em this side.

254
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,724
Come on, keep going.

255
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,060
Something's bothering them.

256
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,635
You know what it is?
It's that A.D.D.

257
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,727
- What's going on? Take it easy.
- Come on, keep going.

258
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,238
Hyah! Hyah!
I don't hear anything.

259
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,916
Yes!

260
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:01,533
Mustang!

261
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,429
Damn!

262
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,901
Let her through.

263
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:09,905
Hold 'em back!

264
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,600
- Come on!
-Jack, on this side!

265
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,610
She's taking the herd.

266
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,249
Jack, get ahold
of this thing.

267
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,255
All right.
Gus, get the herd.

268
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,993
I didn't want the lion
to get my horse.

269
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,366
Your horse?

270
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,531
That animal doesn't belong
to you or anyone else.

271
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,199
Must've separated
from some herd.

272
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,800
I'm surprised
it's still alive.

273
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,469
What are you gonna do with her?

274
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,013
I don't have to do a dang thing
with that loco creature.

275
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,810
Ain't worth the price
of a bale of hay.

276
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,909
Ain't Norbert looking
for mustangs?

277
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,353
Get her behind the fence.

278
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,288
Keep her clear
of the herd.

279
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:12,019
Aw, hell! Forget it, Jack—
I'll take her.

280
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,690
Welcome home.

281
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,069
Hey, Howard,
where's your dad at?

282
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,531
Don't ask.

283
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,334
Something Katy did?

284
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,466
- You guessed it.
- Oh...

285
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,835
Thank you.

286
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,450
So... how bad?

287
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,850
Gimme a category.

288
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,355
Oh, I don't think he made
a category for this one yet.

289
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,720
Open the gate!

290
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,166
Aw... come on, now.

291
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,759
Hold still.
Get around here.

292
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,668
Come on.

293
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,202
She's scared to go through.

294
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,872
Hyah! Hyah!

295
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,276
That's the wild horse.

296
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,013
Isn’t she beautiful?

297
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,782
Wow, she's something,
that's for sure.

298
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,652
That's a dangerous animal.

299
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,419
She's just scared.

300
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,619
I'd say she's
about two years old.

301
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,219
Yeah, two years wild.
And I'll bet most of it alone.

302
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,423
She'll calm down, once I

303
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,794
- start training her.
- What?

304
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,663
No one's riding that loco thing.

305
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,100
I'm calling Norbert
after supper.

306
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,797
No. I can ride her.

307
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,430
No, you can't!
And you won't.

308
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,031
I won't tolerate it, Katy.

309
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,008
After that stunt
you pulled today?

310
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,908
If you're gonna live
under my roof,

311
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,503
you're gonna follow
my rules.

312
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,674
Look at me!

313
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,777
Nobody goes in there
without my permission.

314
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,287
Come on.

315
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,653
Howard!
Get the horses.

316
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,058
Calm down, Flicka.

317
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,601
You named her?

318
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,567
Flicka.

319
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,902
That is the word, isn't it?

320
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,976
Oh, yeah.

321
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,976
Uh, beautiful, um...

322
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,238
young girl.

323
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,144
Well, you got
the “girl” part right.

324
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,015
I didn't see the vet bill.

325
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,849
Someone want to grab this last burger?

326
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:51,980
How much?

327
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,149
You know what I've been
thinking about lately?

328
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,558
If quitters never win, why are you supposed
to quit while you're ahead?

329
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,256
Or, how good
can a bedtime story be

330
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,163
if it's supposed
to put you to sleep?

331
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,065
- Right.
- How much?

332
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,638
$1 ,648.32.

333
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,229
$1 ,600?!

334
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,774
That's just unacceptable.

335
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,503
Well, I'll speak to the horses.

336
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,205
I don't remember my daddy
ever giving horses shots.

337
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,439
They were healthy,
they took care

338
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:17,845
of themselves.
Ain't that right, Gus?

339
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,214
Oh, sure. Back then, horses
mucked their own stalls,

340
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,581
nailed on their own shoes,

341
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,518
even chipped in
with the rent money.

342
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,250
Don't call Norbert!

343
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,962
I think I'll have that burger.

344
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,246
Hey, you.

345
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,373
I don't care what he says.

346
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,247
She's my horse.

347
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,082
Calm down. Give me
a chance to talk to him.

348
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,782
He doesn't listen
when he's this mad.

349
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,449
You know what they say—

350
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,154
anger is just fear
on the way out.

351
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,889
Nice try.

352
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,862
He's not afraid
of anything.

353
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,060
I don't know, you could scare
the heck out of anybody.

354
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,500
Yeah, right.

355
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,834
When you were three,

356
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,103
you climbed out of bed,
unlatched the kitchen door

357
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,074
and walked outside.

358
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,941
He found you
in Lightning's stall.

359
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,413
That horse was crazy,
he could've killed you,

360
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,349
and you were laughing.

361
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,783
I don't remember that.

362
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,912
Yeah, well, he does.

363
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,651
Parents have this kind of...
selective memory.

364
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,751
Sometimes I think I can't
remember what I did yesterday,

365
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:42,026
and then I swear I can remember
every injury, every close call,

366
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,624
every... “another inch
and they could've been killed,”

367
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,194
that ever happened
to my children.

368
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,171
Try and understand

369
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,470
what it feels like
to be responsible

370
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:56,013
for something you love so much.

371
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,978
Good night.

372
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,420
Give her the horse.

373
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,551
No.

374
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,721
Come on, honey,
training her own horse

375
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,026
will make her responsible
for something,

376
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,796
and-and she'll feel
proud of herself.

377
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:23,397
Here it comes—
psychobabble.

378
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,909
This isn't about psychology,
Nell, this is about discipline,

379
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,173
and I'm not gonna
reward bad behavior.

380
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,340
That sure sounds
like psychology to me.

381
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,475
No horse.

382
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,972
That's right.

383
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,595
Sorry, girl, that was my fault.

384
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,249
Maybe you should wash up.

385
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:18,345
Or someone might think you
slept on the ground all night.

386
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,601
You ready for the Price Clu...?

387
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,859
My sweetheart.

388
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,303
Hey, girl.

389
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,172
You want it?

390
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,941
Well, you're gonna have
to come and get it.

391
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,416
But you'd have to trust me
to do that, wouldn't you?

392
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,751
That's enough for tonight.

393
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,828
See you tomorrow.

394
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,841
You can have Chariot.

395
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,416
It's not the same thing.

396
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,747
Well, four legs,
a tail...

397
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,822
Food goes in the front,
out the back.

398
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,289
Well, as long as you're
here, he'll be yours.

399
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,826
Not a problem—
'cause I won't be here.

400
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,986
I mean, on the ranch.

401
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,426
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

402
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,727
I said I'd give the ranch a try,
I tried it.

403
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,596
It's not working for me.

404
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,329
I think I'm gonna take

405
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,337
that scholarship from B.U.

406
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,408
If I can borrow
somebody's backbone.

407
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,409
So will you tell him?

408
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,139
Why would you want
to leave Wyoming?

409
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,147
Oh, I don't know,
how about...

410
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,911
restaurants where you don't
have to drive up to the window...

411
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,043
He needs you
to keep the ranch going.

412
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,553
Hey, keep your voice down!

413
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,247
Nobody can hear us way out here.

414
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:44,795
What?

415
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,591
You didn't know?

416
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,326
He's got hidden cameras
and microphones everywhere.

417
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,301
Can you read me, Dad? Over.

418
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,201
What's that?

419
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,069
Yeah, yeah,
I'll tell her.

420
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,702
Okay. Over and out.

421
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,248
He said... he doesn't need me.

422
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,214
He said

423
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,151
you're the one he needs.

424
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,291
He just doesn't realize it yet.

425
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,299
You're such a good girl.

426
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,239
Okay, now,
I'm gonna try something new.

427
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,706
Okay?

428
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,401
I'm gonna try this hackamore.

429
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,840
Okay, good girl.

430
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,009
Good girl.

431
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,882
It's okay, it's okay. Shh.

432
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,511
It's okay.

433
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,788
Oh, my...

434
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,312
All right, here we go.

435
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,751
I'm just gonna open...

436
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,766
Flicka, calm down.

437
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,734
You'll wake them all up.

438
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,965
Come on.

439
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,508
Good girl.

440
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,940
Good girl.

441
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,173
Good girl.

442
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,441
Okay,

443
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,779
I'm just gonna try
this hackamore.

444
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,818
Nothing to be scared of.

445
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,385
It's okay.

446
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,860
Okay, let's try this again.

447
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,022
Good girl.

448
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,966
See? Isn’t so bad.

449
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,300
Okay.

450
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:47,968
Shh.

451
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,410
Hey, Dad, uh,

452
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,074
- I been thinking...
- How they look?

453
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,881
Well, pretty much
the same as yesterday.

454
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,354
That can change
in a heartbeat.

455
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,515
Right.

456
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,684
You know, animals are
a lot like us, son—

457
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,159
they'll...
always find a way

458
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,994
to tell you exactly
how they're feeling.

459
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,967
You just got to learn
to listen to 'em.

460
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,370
Let's bring 'em in.

461
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,542
- Yeah.
- Let's go!

462
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,075
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

463
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,906
- Watch yourself, Jack!
- Let's go!

464
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,276
Come on! Come on!

465
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,446
He said I can't ride you,

466
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,952
but I don't believe him.

467
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:38,661
Well... got to find out
sometime, right?

468
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,225
Prove 'im wrong, right, Flicka?

469
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,105
Thank you.

470
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,008
Come on!

471
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,351
You're not supposed
to go in there.

472
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,051
What's it to you?

473
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,356
You could get hurt.

474
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,761
Besides...
that's what your father said.

475
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,425
How long are you gonna be
afraid of my father?

476
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,027
Um... forever.

477
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:24,767
And you, why are you sneaking out here
in the middle of the night

478
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,467
if you're not scared?

479
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,048
Because I have to.

480
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,555
Then don't let nobody stop you.

481
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,765
Good night.

482
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,204
Babe.

483
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,855
You want to take a ride?

484
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,452
Sure wish you would.

485
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,601
Bye!

486
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,677
We'll be back for dinner, Mama.

487
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,542
- Beautiful.
- Hi, Rick.

488
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,414
Hey.

489
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,920
Esther went out shopping
with her interior decorator.

490
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,786
You know, at this point,
it'd be cheaper

491
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,153
just to adopt that lady.

492
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,390
Hey, handsome.

493
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,259
Aw, thanks.

494
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,128
What do you think
about the horse?

495
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,809
That's a nice bandanna.

496
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,815
Yeah. Some...
some girl gave it to me.

497
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,248
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

498
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:51,844
-Just any old girl?
- No one special.

499
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,947
Bet she'd like to see you at that rodeo.

500
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,082
You gonna come and cheer her on?

501
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,420
If she's good to me.

502
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,520
Did you tell them?

503
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,063
I will.

504
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,633
I'm waiting
for the right time.

505
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,430
When is there ever going
to be a right time?

506
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,437
Why don't you just
tell them the truth?

507
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,167
“I changed my mind,
I'm gonna take the scholarship.”

508
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,368
It's easier said than done.

509
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,843
I don't know, I...

510
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,510
I feel like a cartoon.

511
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:27,819
My-my feet are running,
but I'm just not moving.

512
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,424
I think everyone writes
a story in their head

513
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,326
that eventually becomes
their life.

514
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,296
And if you don't
write it yourself,

515
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,424
then someone else is
gonna write it for you.

516
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,767
That's not gonna happen
to my story.

517
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,432
Am I in your story?

518
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,913
- How's it going?
- Hey.

519
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,887
This was the Chapman Ranch.

520
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,989
12,000 acres.

521
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,728
Last piece sold off
about two years ago.

522
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,600
You mean they just left?

523
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:18,106
With a great deal of money
in their pockets.

524
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,700
Our marketing people did
a magnificent job.

525
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,403
If you're ever curious...

526
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,414
I'm curious now.

527
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,279
What do you got
there, about...

528
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,249
5,000 acres, more or less?

529
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,684
Well, mostly less.

530
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,279
You could get about 20
spectacular home sites

531
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,551
out of that ranch,
and keep your house,

532
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,683
and a hundred acres.

533
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,591
We can't graze our herd
on a hundred acres.

534
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,062
Uh, sweetie, everything
changes in this life.

535
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,362
You know, one day some lucky
guy's gonna marry you.

536
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,868
What are you gonna do if
he doesn't want to ranch?

537
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,529
Break off the engagement.

538
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,908
Ah, wait'll you fall
in love, sweetie.

539
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,500
Well, then I guess
I won't fall in love.

540
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,706
You wouldn't sell
our ranch, would you?

541
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,715
Now, Katy, don't
get all worked up.

542
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,047
But we wouldn't sell;
we're not like them.

543
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,144
It's time to go.
You get in the truck.

544
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,763
You didn't even tell us
you were gonna sell the ranch.

545
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,170
We're not discussing it.

546
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,503
You are?

547
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,804
I was just talking
to the man.

548
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,504
I guess it can't hurt.

549
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:33,606
I mean, just to explore
all your options.

550
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,207
Yeah. All my options.

551
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,787
I can't believe you would give
our land to strangers.

552
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,877
Katy!

553
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,355
It's crazy! Loco!

554
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,755
That's enough!

555
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,340
Hey, hon, how'd it go?

556
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,449
Rob?

557
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,192
Prodigious day, Mom.

558
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,369
I don't even want to know.

559
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,631
Crazy.

560
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:42,918
What happened
to your movie posters?

561
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,284
I'm moving into my Zen phase.

562
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:01,162
I hate him.

563
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:06,140
Tonight you do.

564
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,178
But he never
understands me.

565
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,139
I know.

566
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,751
And now you're going away.

567
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,694
Oh, come on.

568
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:31,097
I'm changing time zones,
not solar systems.

569
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,533
But once you're gone,
you'll never come back.

570
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,809
Hey, girl.

571
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,087
You came to me.

572
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,592
You know me.

573
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,764
Let's ride.

574
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,036
Good girl.

575
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,909
Good girl.

576
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,345
Okay.

577
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,042
Slowly walk.

578
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,416
Good girl.

579
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,957
Yes, Flicka!

580
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,690
I knew we could do it!

581
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,960
Let's go out.
What do you say?

582
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:52,537
Come on, girl!

583
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,541
Whoa, Flicka.

584
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,408
Whoa! Wait!

585
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:57,980
Whoa!

586
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,548
Hold on, Flicka!

587
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,947
Whoa!

588
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,211
Hey! Hey!

589
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,058
- You all right?
- Flicka went that way.

590
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,185
- What happened?
- She got bucked off the mustang. We're on it.

591
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,661
Are you hurt?

592
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:14,662
No!

593
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:15,663
You couldn't have planned

594
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:16,892
a better way
to get yourself killed.

595
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,898
Rob, don't.

596
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,628
Don't what?
Don't be her father?

597
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,294
You're not protecting her,
you're crippling her,

598
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:23,396
and she'll end up being
as useless as that dang mustang.

599
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,101
Flicka isn't useless.
She wants to learn.

600
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,108
No, she doesn't.

601
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,475
You want something
that doesn't exist.

602
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,014
- It's time you see her for what she is.
- I know what she is!

603
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,878
How do you know a dang thing
about that creature?

604
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,544
Because we're the same!

605
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,951
You did this behind my back.

606
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,819
She was excited,
she got carried away.

607
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,448
Don't-don't make excuses
for her.

608
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,756
It's the same as if she
had lied to my face.

609
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,466
You just don't get it.

610
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,976
There's got to be
a better way.

611
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,913
Well, if there is,
I don't... I don't know it.

612
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,779
Okay.

613
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,063
Go slow now.

614
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,102
Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.

615
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,406
Flicka!

616
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,277
No! No, you can't take her!

617
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,317
Katy, listen,
it's better this way.

618
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,613
She's never been
inside a trailer before.

619
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,153
She's gonna be fine, sweetie.

620
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,688
She's gonna be a rodeo star.

621
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,688
She's scared!

622
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,281
She can't see the sky!

623
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:52,453
Stop it!

624
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:53,756
No!

625
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,195
Katy! Katy!

626
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,290
You're not my father anymore.

627
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,234
Unload Flicka, before you
look like a damn fool!

628
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:02,669
What is wrong with you?

629
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,832
You made this decision
without me,

630
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,739
because you know it's wrong.

631
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:07,901
I'm done discussing this.

632
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,000
Well, I'm not done.

633
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,511
Katy found Flicka.

634
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,512
She should decide.

635
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,912
Until you're running
this ranch,

636
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,506
I'll make the decisions
around here!

637
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,449
I don't want to run your ranch!

638
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:18,043
- Howard!
- No, I'm sick of this place!

639
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,680
You know what,
I've given it a lot of thought,

640
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,689
and guess what?

641
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,761
I'm never gonna be
a rancher. Never.

642
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:27,659
I want to go to college.

643
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,493
Wh-Why didn't you say anything?

644
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,831
'Cause this is what
you wanted me to do.

645
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,399
Katy wants this ranch.

646
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:39,634
I don't want
any part of it.

647
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:43,544
I'm sorry you feel that way.

648
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,009
Norbert... take your horse.

649
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,353
Hope to see you folks
at the fairground.

650
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,722
No! Please! No!

651
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,526
- Please!
- Let's move it.

652
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:00,527
Gus!

653
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,571
Flicka!

654
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,505
No!

655
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,676
Stop! Stop!

656
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,673
<i>The stories we hear</i>

657
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,045
<i>about how the West was won
are all lies.</i>

658
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,813
<i>The history of the West
was written by the horse.</i>

659
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,650
<i>Wherever a settler
left his footprint,</i>

660
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,156
<i>there was a hoofprint
beside it.</i>

661
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:05,751
<i>Men came further and further
west to stake their claim</i>

662
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:08,296
<i>in the great
American wilderness.</i>

663
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,094
<i>But they encountered a strength
that couldn't be tamed.</i>

664
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,536
<i>Wild horses.</i>

665
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,267
<i>Mustangs.</i>

666
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,400
<i>The settlers
called them parasites</i>

667
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,809
<i>that would strip the land
and starve their own herds.</i>

668
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:29,079
<i>They couldn't domesticate them,
so they destroyed them.</i>

669
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:33,054
<i>Isolated and hungry,
they were on their way</i>

670
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,647
<i>to disappearing
from the face of the earth.</i>

671
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:42,359
<i>Sometimes
when the light disappears,</i>

672
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,661
<i>an afterimage remains,</i>

673
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,793
<i>just for a moment.</i>

674
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,531
<i>Mustangs are an afterimage
of the West,</i>

675
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,473
<i>no better than ghosts,
hardly there at all.</i>

676
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,545
<i>No one really wants them,</i>

677
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,772
<i>not ranchers, not city people.</i>

678
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,508
<i>That's their destiny.</i>

679
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,050
<i>Let them disappear
once and for all,</i>

680
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,177
<i>along with all
the other misfits, loners</i>

681
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,745
<i>and relics of a wilderness
no one cares about anymore.</i>

682
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:13,121
<i>Lucky for us,
a few mustangs survived,</i>

683
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,858
<i>hidden away in the mountains.</i>

684
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,957
<i>We need to protect them,</i>

685
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,832
<i>for they are the hope
for some kind of living memory</i>

686
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,303
<i>of what the promise of America
used to be...</i>

687
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,037
<i>and could be again.</i>

688
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,180
Whoa.

689
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,484
Don't say anything.

690
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:42,615
Just get on.

691
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,363
Come on.

692
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,124
When the kids were little,
I'd tuck 'em in

693
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,395
and say, “I'll love you
till the mountains tumble down.”

694
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,163
Right now, I feel like

695
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,239
they could blow away
at any second.

696
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,073
Before Dad died,

697
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,204
he asked me if I wanted
to sell the ranch and...

698
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,441
take the money.

699
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,814
I said, “Over my dead body.

700
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,353
No way, no how.”

701
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:15,083
I thought that's what
he wanted me to say.

702
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:20,220
But, no, he... he seemed
almost disappointed.

703
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,060
He... he said he felt
like that he was giving me

704
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,691
something that didn't
make any sense anymore.

705
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,633
Maybe he's right.

706
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,607
But then I...
I see these kids,

707
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,143
they're hanging out
in the mall,

708
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,872
they're sullen,
they're lazy.

709
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,143
Got no ambition,
got no dreams.

710
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,081
This is the only
way that I know

711
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,675
how to save our children.

712
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,618
Honey, Howard
doesn't need saving.

713
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,383
He'll be fine
wherever he goes.

714
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,948
But Katy, honey,
we could lose her.

715
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:55,589
She's... smart and she's strong,
but she can't survive out there.

716
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,599
Our daughter lives
in a fantasyland.

717
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,328
So do you.

718
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,633
Look at you, sitting on top
of cowboy mountain

719
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,003
looking down at the world
passing by.

720
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,406
When are you gonna look
at your daughter

721
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,137
and realize that she's you?

722
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:15,149
And that's why
I love her so much.

723
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,315
They want to go
to the rodeo, you know?

724
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,984
She wants to see Flicka.

725
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,687
Yeah.

726
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:29,060
They expect me to say no.

727
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,132
Yep.

728
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,801
I bet I'd really blow
their minds if I said yes.

729
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:42,838
Then they'd see how diabolical
I can really be.

730
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,346
You are such a bad boy.

731
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,415
I love it.

732
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,480
Race me back?

733
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,418
Let's go. Come on.

734
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,184
Come on, Belle.

735
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,726
Last one back's naked first.

736
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:58,759
Hyah!

737
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,855
I'm gonna win!

738
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,330
Yeah, right!

739
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,196
Gotcha!

740
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,972
Want to go swimming?

741
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,635
No, thanks.

742
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,516
It's a thousand degrees
in here.

743
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:27,684
I'm busy.

744
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:31,955
You really want to go swimming.

745
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,290
What's he gonna say?

746
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,954
Well, that's his problem.

747
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,965
I'm gonna go see
if the coast is clear.

748
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:41,131
Mom!

749
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,205
Nobody's home.

750
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:45,839
Let's go.

751
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,136
Are you sure about this?

752
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,870
Hey, we'll be back
before anybody even knows.

753
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:49,876
Come on.

754
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:50,877
I'm hot.
Are you hot?

755
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,878
Oh, yeah.

756
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:52,845
Oh, yeah!

757
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,383
Miranda?

758
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,582
Close your eyes, cowgirl!

759
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,412
What's going on?

760
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,538
Well, somebody tell me.

761
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,946
Miranda saw Flicka.

762
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,042
Where?

763
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:33,680
At the fairgrounds when I
was practicing the course.

764
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,018
How did she look?

765
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:38,992
What?

766
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,858
I've never, ever

767
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:44,127
been scared around horses,
not in my entire life,

768
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,566
but those horses
that she was with...

769
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,728
What?
Don't stop. Tell me.

770
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,174
You'd really have to work hard
to make horses that angry.

771
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,837
Listen, I'm sorry, Katy.

772
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,109
I just thought
you'd want to hear.

773
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:04,277
The cowboys in that race are crazy.

774
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:07,686
But they say the purse
is over $8,000.

775
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,123
Oh, money's no good if you're dead.

776
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,751
I can win that race.

777
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:16,491
My demented sister is even
more demented than I thought.

778
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,999
Riders get to choose
their horses, right?

779
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,000
Yeah.

780
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,627
I choose Flicka, I win.

781
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:23,330
If you can stay on her.

782
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,270
I can.

783
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,500
You're too young to enter.

784
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,803
You're not.

785
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:28,809
Bad idea.

786
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,004
Brilliant idea.

787
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,411
If I buy Flicka back
with the prize money,

788
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,245
she won't be Dad's horse anymore,
she'll be mine.

789
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:38,184
And if she wins,
someone'll want her foal.

790
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,483
That's money in my pocket.

791
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,888
And if he tries to sell
our land, I'll buy that, too.

792
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:45,927
Whoa, whoa, Katy, she is
way too dangerous to ride.

793
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,497
Maybe for you
but not for me.

794
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,226
I only have to stay on her
for a few seconds.

795
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,767
I've already done that.

796
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,898
Miranda?

797
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,543
Oh...

798
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,112
The people have spoken.

799
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,742
No, the inmates have
taken over the asylum.

800
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:13,448
Come on, let's see you
walk it like you talk it.

801
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,114
Drown me, please.

802
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,123
Hey! Hey!

803
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,193
Whoa! Whoa!

804
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:28,526
Oof! That aftershave'll
scare the livestock.

805
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:32,631
Oh. But the ladies
find it reassuring.

806
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:35,142
Yeah, it let's 'em know
I'm sensitive,

807
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:38,612
not just a... sexy beast.

808
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,147
Can we get going?

809
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,446
Oh, Jack, you stink.

810
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:45,452
Busted.

811
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,352
Let's go! Come on!

812
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:48,355
I'm coming!

813
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:04,968
Well, what'll it be
tonight, boys,

814
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,371
crazy eights or canasta?

815
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:09,775
Canasta it is.

816
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,005
Ladies and gentlemen,

817
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:15,141
welcome
to the Red Gulch Roundup!

818
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,347
Now, for those of you
that may be visiting

819
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,389
our beautiful state
for the first time,

820
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,584
welcome to Wyoming!

821
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:24,853
In our grand entry today,

822
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,293
our flags are being carried
by Miss Rodeo America

823
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,628
and her lovely assistant.

824
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,896
And all of our beauty
a-horseback.

825
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,129
Now in the center

826
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,366
of the arena is the world
champion trick roper,

827
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,999
Mr. Gene McLaughlin!

828
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,943
They say in every cowboy's life,
he gets a...

829
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:48,108
good horse, a good woman
and a good loop.

830
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:49,946
All right, folks,
it's rodeo time,

831
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:53,250
but it seems that Miss Rodeo
America needs my assistance...

832
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:55,119
Aw, honey, how could you
eat that stuff?

833
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,488
It makes me sweeter.

834
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,994
You're already sweet.

835
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:00,994
There she is!

836
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,792
...the barrel race!

837
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,662
All right, ladies, cowgirl up.

838
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,734
Mm, mm, mm.

839
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,068
Introducing our next
barrel racer, Miranda Koop.

840
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:12,906
Come on, baby!

841
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,067
Here she comes around

842
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:15,303
the first barrel.

843
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:16,435
Quick.

844
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,640
Another great run.

845
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:22,115
Coming to the third barrel...

846
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,545
Out she goes.

847
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,789
That's okay.

848
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,690
That's okay.

849
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,839
Hyah, hyah!

850
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:55,303
She's mine, boys.

851
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,208
Katy, I'm scared.

852
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:09,875
I'm not, not even a little.

853
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:14,951
What do you think?

854
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,455
I think I should be
the voice of reason.

855
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,722
We're runnin' out of time.

856
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,225
Hold on.

857
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,174
You need gum.

858
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,873
Yeah, okay.

859
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,159
Wait here.

860
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,032
Here's your receipt.
Good luck to you, partner.

861
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,503
- Thank you, sir.
- You bet.

862
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,667
How you doing, Norbert?

863
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,004
Oh, what you say, Wagner?

864
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,600
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hiya, Norbert.

865
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:12,146
Can I help you?

866
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:15,240
Yeah, uh,
I want to register.

867
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,943
For an event.

868
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,351
You gonna tell me which one,
or do I have to read your mind?

869
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,514
The wild horse race.

870
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,558
Wild horse race.

871
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,524
That takes a team of two.

872
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,721
Mm-hmm.
That's my partner.

873
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,991
Outside.

874
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,659
That little bitty feller?

875
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,837
Good luck.

876
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:36,996
I need $50.

877
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,734
Yes, sir.

878
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:43,772
Fifty.

879
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,872
Gotta sign this waiver.

880
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,076
Right there.

881
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:50,948
Report to the corral.

882
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,044
Pick yourself out a hoss.

883
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,486
- Here you are, darling.
- Thank you.

884
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,615
The event rolls at 5:00 p.m. sharp.
Here's your receipt.

885
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,886
Thank you.

886
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:00,929
And if you come to your senses
and want to back out...

887
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:03,362
you lose every penny.

888
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,534
Good luck.

889
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,114
It's okay, Flicka.

890
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,518
Doggone, Billy!

891
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,988
Hey, get outta there,
you lunatic!

892
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,651
You choose your horse
like everybody else,

893
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,456
or you can take a hike!

894
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:36,053
Do the rules say you can put
a baby cradle on a horse?

895
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,826
Quiet down!

896
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,162
All right, gather 'round, boys.

897
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,235
Shout 'em out.

898
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,038
Fourth team takes
the black filly.

899
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,438
Son, you just lost a race.

900
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,204
That horse is truly loco.

901
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,075
Boys, next time
you see your horse,

902
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,546
it'll be in the ring,
trying to run you over.

903
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:54,741
All right, now.

904
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:55,839
Good luck!

905
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,153
Ladies and gentlemen,
and cowboys...

906
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,692
the wild horse race
is about to start.

907
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,591
Now, if you've got
a weak heart...

908
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:07,685
Hey!

909
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,128
- Kick some cowboy ass.
- Thanks.

910
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:11,461
...or you just ate
a big meal, I suggest you...

911
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:14,730
Don't you dare get hurt.

912
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:16,532
Dang! Norbert.

913
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,335
You know what we say to our
first group of riders...

914
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,273
welcome to our...

915
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,571
Do you think he
recognized us?

916
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,612
- I don't know.
- Let's bring 'em in!

917
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:25,840
Come on.

918
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:27,848
Now, direct your attention
to the chutes.

919
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,578
That ain't no earthquake
beneath your feet.

920
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:32,711
That's wild horses
coming at you.

921
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,882
Look at those crazy devils.

922
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,755
They've never been saddled,
never haltered.

923
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,523
Angrier than a cowboy
who just totaled his pickup.

924
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,528
Here's how it works.

925
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:43,689
In a few moments the horses...

926
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:44,993
- No way.
- What?

927
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,432
Are you freaking crazy?!

928
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,934
Just try and stop me.

929
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,732
...the boys have gotta grab
'em, saddle 'em,

930
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,363
then ride 'em
between a pair of barrels,

931
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:53,135
and any rider
that stays on that long...

932
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:54,709
Your group's up next.

933
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,277
...wins $8,000.

934
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:59,280
- I'm giving my number back.
- Go ahead.

935
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:00,406
So, let's bring in
the first set of victims.

936
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,108
I mean, cowboys.

937
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,119
Team number one, this is

938
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,983
Jimmy Miles and John Bull.

939
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:10,115
Team number two, the Eggan boys.

940
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:13,059
Second generation,
Wade and Trace Eggan.

941
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:16,097
Team number three— Chris Fadey
and Big John Slim.

942
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:19,998
And this next team of kids,
they are so green,

943
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:24,232
they've got moss
oozing out of their pores...

944
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,171
- Hi, Norbert. How are you?
- Well, well, well.

945
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,503
Hi, how are you?

946
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,771
Guess you changed your mind
about mustangs, didn't you?

947
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:30,937
Come again?

948
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,275
Well, you're here
to see your boy

949
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,609
ride that wild horse,
aren't you?

950
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:34,683
- My boy?
- Howard?

951
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:35,682
Yeah.

952
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:36,774
What are you
talking about?

953
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,217
Well, he's up now.

954
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,719
Where is he?
I'm gonna kill him.

955
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,619
- Follow me.
- Where's Miranda?

956
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,656
I don't believe this.

957
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:44,589
...the first four teams...

958
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,092
Riders, get ready.

959
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,423
Here we go.

960
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,260
Don't let anybody back out,
boys. Your life's on the line.

961
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,459
Let's go for it.

962
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,694
Ten...

963
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:54,963
nine...

964
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,038
eight...

965
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:57,105
seven...

966
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,298
six...

967
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,341
five... four...

968
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,774
three...

969
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:02,809
two...

970
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:03,844
one...

971
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,346
Aw, let her rip, boys!

972
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,474
Get back, Loretta.
Here they come.

973
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,916
Four of the toughest broncs
you're ever gonna see.

974
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,851
Remember,
one man's gonna give chase;

975
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,286
one's gonna try
to get him saddled.

976
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,291
You see this black filly,
number 1 4—

977
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,156
she is out of control.

978
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,558
- Get her! Get her!
- Whoa!

979
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,826
That's a bad old girl to have
to deal with in this dance.

980
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,299
Them boys got more
than they bargained for,

981
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:27,994
taking that horse.

982
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,397
Now this is the height
of insanity—

983
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:32,940
we've got a man on right here.

984
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,340
Almost on.

985
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,809
Oh, my Lord, my mother
could've rode better than that.

986
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:41,314
Two riders up,
one still unsaddled.

987
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:44,181
Heads up, boys!

988
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,687
Oh, that is not the recommended
way to dismount a wild horse.

989
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,348
This is insane.

990
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,722
There it is, on the far side.

991
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:54,887
Take a chance,
put your life on the line.

992
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:58,228
Dropped him like a two-ton rock,
split him like a $2 suitcase.

993
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:01,462
He's wide open,
and he is all done.

994
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,037
Flicka!

995
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,505
Boy, I hope one of these guys
wins this thing...

996
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,472
Easy, girl.

997
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,206
Hey.

998
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,244
I see Howard.

999
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,851
...the last time we see...

1000
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,422
It's Katy.

1001
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:24,857
Oh, my God.

1002
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,858
Rob! Rob!

1003
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,087
Lookee here!

1004
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:29,664
Some lunatic just jumped
out of the VIP section.

1005
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:30,823
He's here.

1006
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:32,764
What's he doing
in the middle of the arena?!

1007
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,529
- Look!
- I'm an idiot.

1008
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:36,002
He's never gonna
let me keep her.

1009
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:38,130
-Just win.
- It won't make any difference to him.

1010
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,231
- He doesn't want either of us.
- Let go!

1011
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,708
Look at that crazy fool, this guy is still at it.

1012
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:45,609
Where is he going?!
What's going on?

1013
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:46,976
Katy, let go.

1014
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,276
Ya... come on.

1015
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,045
Look a-here,
jumped on bareback.

1016
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:52,643
What in the world is going on?

1017
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,848
I'm gonna set you free, girl.
Hyah!

1018
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,517
Ladies and gentlemen, number 1 4...
is gonna be the winner.

1019
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:58,524
Katy!

1020
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,094
14, folks,

1021
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,790
is not stopping at the barrels.

1022
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,924
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

1023
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,595
I've been watching this
for 40 years.

1024
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,195
So, call the state troopers
in Wyoming.

1025
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:12,899
He's headed for Cheyenne.

1026
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:15,875
I don't think he can stop
that black filly.

1027
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:56,614
I don't know what to do.

1028
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,882
Where do we go, Flicka?

1029
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:05,860
Nothing you can do.

1030
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,553
What'd they say?

1031
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,688
Can't get a helicopter
here till morning.

1032
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:10,992
Boys lost the trail.

1033
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,967
Probably won't be able to pick
it up again till daylight.

1034
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,969
- Norbert, gimme a horse.
- Two horses.

1035
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:17,333
Y'all need to calm down.

1036
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,431
No, we're not gonna calm down
till we find our daughter.

1037
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:21,600
She'll go home.

1038
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,642
No, honey, she can't.

1039
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,474
Not in the mountains,
not in the dark.

1040
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,047
Not Katy— Flicka.

1041
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:28,946
Hey, our mountains
are her home, too.

1042
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,985
You're right.
Let's go.

1043
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,577
When we get back to the ranch,
we're riding out.

1044
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,748
Weather's coming in.

1045
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,711
This is our creek, isn't it?

1046
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,746
You brought us back.

1047
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,212
Thank you, girl.

1048
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,948
Let's go home.
Come on.

1049
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:31,172
What is it?

1050
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,908
What is it, girl?

1051
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:44,356
What is it, girl? Huh?

1052
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,624
It's okay, girl.

1053
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:49,789
It's okay.

1054
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,456
It's okay, girl.

1055
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:52,864
Come on.

1056
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,435
Come on, it's okay.

1057
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:03,434
No!

1058
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:07,138
No!

1059
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,211
Get away from her!

1060
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,288
No!

1061
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,690
Flicka!

1062
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,090
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1063
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,733
God! Get up.

1064
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,499
Oh, God.

1065
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,336
Oh, my God.

1066
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:36,036
Flicka, get up, please.

1067
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:37,772
Get up!

1068
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,040
Somebody help me!

1069
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,887
Get up!

1070
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,860
Get up, please!

1071
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,266
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Let's go.

1072
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:00,335
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyah!

1073
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,630
Hyah!

1074
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,601
I'll search the ridge.

1075
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,075
I'll take the south meadow. Katy!

1076
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:12,044
I'm gonna check the creek.

1077
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,910
You should go back.

1078
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,244
Not a chance.

1079
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,375
Katy!

1080
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:19,078
Katy!

1081
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,281
Katy!

1082
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,133
Katy!

1083
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:37,164
Aah...

1084
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:38,762
Oh!

1085
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,341
Katy?

1086
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:41,466
Oh, baby.

1087
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:42,737
It's gonna be okay, baby.

1088
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:45,575
Daddy's got you.
Come on.

1089
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:49,242
Dad... the lion got her.

1090
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,622
You're gonna be all right, baby.

1091
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,554
It's all right.

1092
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,635
Flicka.

1093
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:24,879
Is she all right?

1094
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,280
Find Jack.
Go to the creek.

1095
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,824
That horse is hurt bad.

1096
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,861
<i>A hundred and two.</i>

1097
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:36,795
I don't know if it's accurate.
It's an old thermometer.

1098
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:39,026
No.

1099
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,329
The doctor can't land
in the storm.

1100
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,970
So... no.
So, we'll wait.

1101
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,838
Okay.

1102
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,414
What do I look for?

1103
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:55,745
A hundred and five.

1104
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,978
Can that be right?

1105
01:15:58,086 --> 01:16:00,782
Howard, get some more ice, son.

1106
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:07,157
Flicka!

1107
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:38,217
Flicka!

1108
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:51,204
What's Katy's shirt
doing around her neck?

1109
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:55,305
She tried to stop
the bleeding.

1110
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,504
Oh, she's cut deep.

1111
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,105
We ought to take
away her pain.

1112
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,678
You gonna shoot her?

1113
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,347
What do you think?

1114
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:21,526
How bad's the horse?

1115
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,699
Go back and put her down.

1116
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:34,411
She'll hear the shot.

1117
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:35,881
She'll think it's thunder.

1118
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,611
No, she won't.

1119
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:40,119
Look, Katy's smart.

1120
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,383
She sees things...

1121
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:45,756
little details
most people ignore...

1122
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:48,329
the ones that make
a difference.

1123
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,295
She'll know it's Flicka.

1124
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:53,232
I can't let that animal suffer.

1125
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,230
I'll do it myself.

1126
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:16,017
- Dad?
- Don't.

1127
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:19,355
I'm sorry.

1128
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:22,487
I really screwed up.

1129
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:25,065
Look at me.

1130
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:26,395
You're a good man.

1131
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,559
Yes, sir.

1132
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,330
Now, you stay
with your mother.

1133
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:30,928
Yes, sir.

1134
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:45,114
Are you gonna kill Flicka?

1135
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,620
I'm just gonna have
a look at her, baby.

1136
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,519
It's okay, Daddy.

1137
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,959
You can shoot us.

1138
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,532
Katy!

1139
01:18:57,632 --> 01:19:00,157
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

1140
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,358
Damn!

1141
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,169
Flicka!

1142
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:47,145
Shh!

1143
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:49,308
It's okay.

1144
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,450
Dang it.

1145
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:42,266
Oh, dear God.

1146
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,338
Oh...

1147
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,506
Oh, look at her.

1148
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,110
It was a lion.

1149
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,448
There's no good reason
she's alive.

1150
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:06,118
There's a very good reason
she's alive.

1151
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,788
She's got
mustang blood in her.

1152
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:12,298
She's a fighter...

1153
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,369
just like our girl.

1154
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:24,810
Don't worry.

1155
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:26,778
The doctors will be
here in the morning.

1156
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:31,182
Let's get her
to the barn.

1157
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,015
Come on, sweetie.

1158
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:35,248
Come on, Flicka.

1159
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,418
Come on, honey.

1160
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:55,034
The day you were born...

1161
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,206
...and they gave you to me...

1162
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:05,083
...I felt my hands were
too rough to hold you.

1163
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:10,083
And you cried
no matter what we did...

1164
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,520
...but your mom said
that that was a good sign.

1165
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:16,597
You were strong.

1166
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:22,869
That wasn't much comfort
when I was holding you

1167
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:27,374
and pacing back and forth
all night.

1168
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:32,344
All you did was look at me
with those big, beautiful eyes.

1169
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:37,249
I made all kinds
of promises to you

1170
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:40,219
if you would
just go to sleep.

1171
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:47,423
Katy...

1172
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:51,488
I forgot to keep
those promises...

1173
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:57,604
...and I'm sorry.

1174
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,637
Do you forgive me?

1175
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:08,648
I'll tell you every day
how proud I am of you

1176
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:12,379
and how proud I am
that you're my daughter.

1177
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:17,486
Just stay with me...

1178
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:20,060
please.

1179
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:29,951
Daddy.

1180
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:36,797
Her fever's broke.

1181
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,097
I want to see Flicka.

1182
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:42,169
No, it's okay, sweetheart.

1183
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:50,704
Oh, babe...

1184
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,555
Katy, can you come downstairs
for a minute?

1185
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:24,074
It's my fault Flicka's dead.

1186
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:27,012
I don't think so.

1187
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:28,946
Come on outside.

1188
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:46,233
Flicka!

1189
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,533
Baby!

1190
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:57,636
You're alive.

1191
01:26:57,745 --> 01:26:59,906
It's going
to be okay now, okay?

1192
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,683
Aw...

1193
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:06,481
Your mother's been taking
good care of her...

1194
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:07,919
but when you're better,

1195
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:11,856
I expect you to take
care of her yourself.

1196
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,190
But you said if I don't get
back into school...

1197
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:16,024
Yes, that's what I said,
and I meant it.

1198
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,030
So Dad sent them your essay.

1199
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:20,032
I told them I didn't know much
about writing,

1200
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:21,897
but I sure as heck
know about the West.

1201
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:23,231
So does my daughter,

1202
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:24,999
and it's right there
in her essay—

1203
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:27,336
every opinionated,

1204
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:29,842
ornery, hot-blooded
part of it.

1205
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:34,411
What did they say?

1206
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:37,177
What does anyone say
to your father?

1207
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:38,513
“Yes, sir.”

1208
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:43,619
I love you, Daddy.

1209
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,192
I love you, sweetie.

1210
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:58,028
<i>I believe there is a force</i>

1211
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:01,700
<i>in this world that lives
beneath the surface...</i>

1212
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,369
<i>something primitive and wild
that awakens</i>

1213
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,108
<i>when you need an extra push
just to survive...</i>

1214
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,210
<i>...like wildflowers that bloom</i>

1215
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,448
<i>after a fire turns
the forest black.</i>

1216
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,553
<i>Most people are afraid of it</i>

1217
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:25,497
<i>and keep it buried
deep inside themselves.</i>

1218
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,103
<i>But there will always be
a few people</i>

1219
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:42,774
<i>who have the courage to love
what is untamed inside us.</i>

1220
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:44,442
<i>One of those men...</i>

1221
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:48,685
<i>...is my father.</i>

1222
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,159
<i>There was once a time</i>

1223
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:04,500
<i>when Americans came west
to discover their destiny.</i>

1224
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:11,409
<i>Today, they seem to move
around every which where,</i>

1225
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:14,276
<i>restless and unsettled...</i>

1226
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:20,082
<i>but I think they're still
looking for the same thing—</i>

1227
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:23,988
<i>a place where they can be
optimistic about the future,</i>

1228
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:27,528
<i>a place that helps them to be
who they really want to be...</i>

1229
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:32,793
<i>...where they can feel
that this life makes sense...</i>

1230
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:37,863
<i>...a place where they can feel</i>

1231
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:41,271
<i>what I feel
when I am riding Flicka.</i>

1232
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:47,838
<i>'Cause when we're riding,
all I feel...</i>

1233
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,948
<i>...is free.</i>
