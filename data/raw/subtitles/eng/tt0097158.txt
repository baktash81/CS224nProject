00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,360
Hugo?

8
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,640
The Queen.

9
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,880
[TOGETHER] The Queen.

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,400
Nice to see you back, Lord.

12
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,160
Thank you, Waldo.

13
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,320
Very nice to be back.

14
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,920
I take full credit
for that, Waldo.

15
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,560
He's my guest, aren't you, Hugo?

16
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, indeed, Jamie.

17
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,760
He used to leave whiskeyfor me in my tooth mug

18
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
when we were at school.

19
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,440
I think it was because hehad a thing for my sister.

20
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,320
Oh, Jamie.

21
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,240
[laughs]

22
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,480
Hard to imagine
you in the city.

23
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,320
What exactly do
you do there, Hugo?

24
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,560
What's the best buy now?

25
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm not a stockbroker, Alec.

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,680
I, um, I'm more of an adviserto Peter here, really.

27
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,080
ALEC: Come on, you
can give us a hint.

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,280
No, I can't.

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,040
Of course, it's
damned hard to maintain

30
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,760
the lifestyle of theregiment once you left it.

31
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,160
Who pays the bills?

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,040
I do.

33
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,560
Peter does, of course.

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,480
He says it's worth it forthe uh, the letter heading.

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
He says the title looksawfully good on the stationery.

36
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,920
[chuckles]

37
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
You were never in the
Army, were you, Peter?

38
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,360
None of the services?

39
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,640
In none of the services, no.

40
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,400
I went straight into the city.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,640
We're, uh, we're aboutto go into South America,

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,640
aren't we, Peter?

43
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,520
We were in the Falklands.

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,080
You missed
something there, Hugo.

45
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,040
HUGO: Yes.

00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,960
Mm-hmm.

49
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,400
Has Lady Bruckton arrived yet?

50
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,640
Oh, I see.

51
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Um-hum.

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,280

time she'd return?

54
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,560
Jamie?

55
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
Are you on duty tonight?

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
Yes, won't be long.

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,200
Mind if I come along?

58
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,120
Evening.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,880
Here we go.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Let me drive, Jamie.

62
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,760
I ought to, really.

63
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,800
Oh, don't be prat, Jamie.

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,200
It's Hugo.

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,640
Let him drive!

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,880
Look after her.

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,120
Hold on, chaps.

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,120
Hold on--

Say, Hugo, you are comingto my stag night, aren't you?

77
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,240
I'm best man.

78
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
Oh, God help us.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,920
I don't suppose Alec's wifeis going to be much of a threat.

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,960
Got her well trained already?

81
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,920
Rather, eh?

82
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,400

JACK: And how's your wife, Hugo?

87
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,680
Delectable Lady Bruckton, hm?

88
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,680
I gather she's teamed
up with Raul Vargas.

89
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,600
You see, Hugo, I'd havethought you'd have been the one

90
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,840
to handle her business affairs.

91
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,000
Under the circumstances.

92
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Come on, Jack,
leave him alone.

OK.

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,000
Is she all right?

103
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,600
Come on, up you get.

104
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,320
Come on.

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,280
Are you OK?

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
Get her over there.

107
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,280
No, I don't think
she should be moved.

108
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
She should go over there.

109
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,800
That's not the
right thing to do.

110
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,400
Call an ambulance.

111
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,400
She's dead.

112
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,400
We've got to get the police.

113
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,720
There's nothing we can do.

114
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,880
- Get an ambulance!
- All right, quiet down!

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,960
What do you mean quiet down!

116
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,920
We can't just leave her here!

117
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,320
Get the police!

118
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,760
For fuck's sake, get
him back in the car.

119
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,920
I said she's dead.

120
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,800

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,720

to tell someone.

What does she look like?

134
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,240
She's dead!

135
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
She isn't anybody.

136
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,640
Christ.

137
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,120
How can we just drive on?

138
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,360
What are we doing?
God!

139
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,400
There's nothing we can do!

140
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,600
For God's sake!

141
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,880

It's getting really late.

152
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
Look, I'll try and
get back if I can.

153
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
If I don't, please don't worry.

154
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,320
I'll probably stay
at Cordelia's.

155
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,360
Otherwise, I'll see
you down at crew.

156

Thank you so much.

165
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,320
My memory of you, anyway.

166
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Can you hold those there?

167
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,640
Thank you.

Yeah, those are good.

Hi, mom.

171
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,960
Hello.

172

Oh!

Are you going to drive
us down to the country?

177

Oh, Ed, I'm sorry.

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm sorry.

182

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,880
Why am I being roped off?

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
We are open to the publictomorrow, my Ladyship says.

193
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,360
Oh.

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,920
They're here already?

195
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,920
EXETER: No, it's Master Edward.

196
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,360
Teddy?
Oh.

197
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,240
Well, this is something.

198
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,240
This is indeed something.

199
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,160
Teddy!

200
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,040
Hi, grandad.

Hello, darling.

203
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,400
Hello, darling.

204
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,200
What have you done
to your forehead?

205
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,040
You all right?

206
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,200
Hello, Peter.

207
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,400
I hitched a ride with Raul.

208
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,160
I'm going on to the
Babberton's, so it's

209
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,640
no problem.
- Ah, good.

210
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,920
Come and have a drink.

211
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,520
You uh, you know each
other, of course.

212
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,000
Thanks, but I won't.

213
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,760
PETER: I heard all about you.

214
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
Still playing the polo?

215
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,800
RAUL: Anyway, better go.

216
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,920
I'll ring you over the weekend.

217
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,840
And do your homework.

218
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,200
Bloody Argies.

219
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,360
Still, they do breed goodpolo ponies, don't they, Hugo?

[car driving away]

221
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,080
I'll take our luggage in.

222
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
Bad for you, old boy.

223
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,760
I don't want to!

224
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,800
Put me down.
- Yes, you do.

225
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,920
Don't let him watch TV
for too long, Benny.

226
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,360
Oh, why on earth not?

227
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,560
Night, night, night.

228
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Good night, sir.

229
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Good night, Edward.

230
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,480
Sleep tight.

231
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920
[laughs]

232
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,920
Hello, darling.

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,760
Whew!

236
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,360
You never told me
it was like this.

[music stops]

238
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,120
God, you've got
lousy selection, Jamie.

239
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,800
A telephone call for you.

240
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:30,720
Thank you, Mr. X.

241
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,400
Wonderful figure, that girl.

242
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,880
Absolutely miraculous figure.

243
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,320
I hear Virginia is becominga formidable business

245
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,360
I do hope we won't
prove too dull for her.

making that noise?

248

Ah, Jamie Skinner.

249
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Oh, yes, of course.

250
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Rebecca's invited him
down for the weekend.

251
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,360
PETER: Poor old Jamie.

252
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,840
Shouldn't you get
that fixed, Jamie?

253
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,720
Hi, everybody.

254
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,000
Hello, darling.

255
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,840
You can use our

256
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,880
Telephone tomorrow.

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,400
Thanks.

258
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,640
It sounded like an oldHook's clock coming to get you.

Hm?

262
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,240
Old Hook's clock.

263
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,680
And he loves
his little Jaguar.

264
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,880
Um, sorry.

265
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
I was looking for Hugo.

266
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,160
He's not here, I'm afraid.

267
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm just doing the uniform.

268
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,840
Excuse me.

269
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,600
I had such a good
time last night.

270
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,120
HUGO: Oh, really?

271
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,600
I really wish
you'd been there.

272
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,520
I'm so pleased with that office.

273
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,600

going to work, you know?

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,440
I thought you said it wasall going to be over by 10:00.

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,800
I telephoned.

277
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,040
We went onto
dinner afterwards.

278
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
I drank far too much.

279
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,840
Was Raul there, at dinner?

281
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,120

Do you know what it's
like for me to love you?

286
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,320
Do you have any idea?

287
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,320
Hm?

Well, here's to lots
and lots of tourists

291
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,040
and to lots and lots
of money for us.

292
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,720
Do be quiet, Rebecca.

293
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,240
The council have
this idea to buy

294
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
the lower section of Down Park.

295
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,480
HUGO: Do they, indeed?

296
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,760
What for?

297
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,800
A leisure center, I think.

298
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,840
It seems to me-- I
hope you don't mind?

299
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,160
Please.

300
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,080
Well, there may be advantages.

301
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
If the council wants
something from you,

302
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,800
well, it might help infurther plans that you have.

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880

00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,520
Does no one have a
surname nowadays?

310
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,560
aren't you?

311
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,160
God.

312
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,920
I don't want to walk up anddown modeling silly clothes.

313
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,760
Who cares about their
clothes, anyway?

314
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,480
Who wants to be a clothes horse?

315
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,680
I'm sure if you
ask them nicely,

316
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,920
they'll let you model
the long dresses.

317

are bloody good.

No, my dear.

Not all of us.

322
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,920
There is a story that

shoes and stockings

of us would wish to see

But then I wouldn't behere to see that, would I?

333
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,000
Worse luck.

335
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,200
Couldn't we just
sleep together?

336
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,000
You'd better not be
here in the morning.

337
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,600
What is it, Jamie?

338
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,600
What?

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,120

341
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,560
Nothing.

342
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,960
What are you doing, Jamie?

343
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,280
Um, nothing.

344
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,720
Just to the loo, you know.

345
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,520
I thought gentlemen
went downstairs.

346
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,200
Downstairs?

347
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,920
In my family, gentlemen alwaysgo to the lavatory downstairs.

348
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,680
Of course.

349
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,760
I knew some
Skinners in Cheshire.

350
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,120
Um, cousins, I think.

351
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,480
They're quite distant.

352
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,920
Oh.

353
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,120
Hugo tells me you werequite a scholar at school.

354
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,480
Doesn't that mean you'resupposed to be awfully clever?

355
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,480
No, it wasn't that
sort of a scholarship.

356
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,440
It was more a sort of a bursaryfor, um, sons of old boys

357
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,640
if they found the
fees rather right.

358
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,240
I see.

359
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,120
Goodnight, Jamie.

360
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,960
Goodnight, Lady Crewne.

361
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,640
Yeah, well, I said that.

362
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,440
Uh-huh.

00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,880
[laughs]

364
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,040
I've given up
on the little man

from the Coal
Board compensation,

366
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,240
but Peter says he
knows the minister.

368
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,200
Uh-huh.

369
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,280
Yeah, yeah.

370
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Uh-huh, OK.

371
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,320
I'll see.

372
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,400
I'll speak to you soon.

373
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,360
Bye bye.

374
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,680
So who was that, then?

This is nonsense.

747
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,640
OFFICER: Good evening, sir.

[music playing]

750
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,680
The accident happened lateat night a few weeks ago.

751
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,160
[voices]

752
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,120
But the woman was
taken to hospital.

753

[voices]

754
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,720
The incident took placeoutside the home of Mr. Vargas.

755
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,160
I believe you know him, sir.

756
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,960
Former business
associate of yours.

757
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,480
HUGO: Yes, I know
Mr. Vargas very well,

758
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,280
but, uh, I fail to see whatthat has to do with me.

759
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,880
OFFICER: Quite.

760
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,760
You've heard the rumor linkingyour name with the event?

761
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,000
HUGO: Yes, it's ridiculous.

762
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,720
OFFICER: Yes, sir.

763
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,120
But where were you that night?

764
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,800
HUGO: Well, as a
matter of fact, I

765
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,680
was having dinner with some offriends from my old regiment.

766
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,640
Hello,darling.

767
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,880
Gentlemen.

768
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,800
Lady Bruckton.

769
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,800
Forgive the appalling
venue and the wine list.

770
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,560
The Turf And White's would haveseemed a little conspicuous,

771
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,720
so I chose Soho.

772
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,960
Oh, come on, Peter.

773
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,960
It's obvious why we're here.

774
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,920
Someone's let the
cat out of the bag,

775
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,040
and it has to be one
of us, doesn't it?

776
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,600
Someone here has talked.

777
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,360
And we all swore not to.

778
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,400
Has anyone here saidanything to anyone about this?

779
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,040
- Yes.
- What!

780
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,120
Yes.

781
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,760
- You?
- I said yes.

782
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,680
Oh, Jamie!

783
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,760
I'm sorry, Hugo.

784
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,040
I really am.

785
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,040
Well, go on!

786
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,440
What do you mean, go on?

787
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,640
Who did you tell?

788
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,800
You broke your word.

789
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,960
I suppose you've
told everybody!

790
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,880
No.

791
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,800
Who?

792
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,920
I want tell you.

793
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,200
You bloody well will.

794
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,160
No.

795
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,960
God, you little hypocrite!

796
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,200
Talk about double standards.

797
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,360
Little shit.

798
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,320
Have you been sendingme blackmail notes, Jamie?

799
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,800
No.

800
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,280
Not very clever
of you, was it?

801
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,840
Considering you look
like the guilty party.

802
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,360
JAMIE: What do you mean?

803
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,240
What do you mean?

[dance music]

805
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,800
No!

806
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,800
No!

807
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,800
Bitch.

808
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,320
Oh, you bitch.

809
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,320
You bloody bitch!

810
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,440
I'm sorry, Hugo!

811
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,320
I'm sorry!

812
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,400
I didn't mean to do it!

813
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,280
Bitch.

814
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,680
It was a joke.

815
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,040
It was just a joke.

816
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,920
I'm sorry.

817
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,920
I'm really sorry.

818
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,400
I'm so sorry.

820
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,760
Do you know where
moles have their ears?

LORD CREWNE: No.

822
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,280
Under their armpits.

823
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,640
[laughs]

824
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,560
It's true.

825
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,640
John told me.

826
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,560
I don't know how
John knows, though.

[coughing]

828
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,680
Anyway, how many have
you had today, grandpa?

829
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,680
What?

830
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,920
Cigarettes.

831
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,240
Oh.

832
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,720
Five.

833
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,920
Let me see the packet.

834
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,680
How many were in the packet?

835
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,560
20.

836
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,760
Oh, by the way, how is
the, uh, the new girl?

838
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,160
She's fine.

Edward seems to like her.

840
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,480
Good.

841
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,400
Good.

00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,880
No.

844
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,240
Why do you ask?

845
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,680
We-- we could have
dinner out if you like?

846
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,800
No, I-- I just thought thatif you wanted to go out, I was

00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,320
going to have an early night.

'I bet they'd be
more happy at home."

Every time he went
to the zoo, he

00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,800
did his best to
talk them out of it,

857
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,120
but they only laughed at him."

Hello, darling.

870
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,960
No, he's out.

871
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,480
Listen, Cordelia,
I'm downstairs.

872
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,920
Let me pick up in
the bedroom, OK?

Captain J. Skinner.

876
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,680
Yes, he was duty
officer that evening.

877
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,760
Now can you tell me
what this is all about?

878
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,520
Would his car
be kept here, sir?

879
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,400
His car?

880
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,240
Captain Skinner is afirst rate career soldier.

881
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,200
Actually, he's a fine officer.

882
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,800
I'm sure that in this
case there's a perfectly

883
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,120
straightforward explanation.

884
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,880
Well, I can't
believe he's your man.

885
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,640
The car?

886
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,160
Shall we look at the car, sir?

[mumbling]

889
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,480
It clearly wasn't Hugo
who was responsible.

890
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,840
I spoke to Peter about it,and he tells me the rumor

891
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,200
was started by Jamie Skinner.

892
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,600
Well, I never did have
any confidence in him.

893
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,120
There's nothing worse
than being disloyal to--

894
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,200
Peter told you that that?

895
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,120
That is ridiculous.

896
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,480
But that's not the point!

897
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:40,640
The point is we must alldo our very best for Hugo

898
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,800
so that no one can be
in the slightest doubt.

899
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,160
Edward loves coming
here, doesn't he?

900
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,080
Edward?

901
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,440
Yes.

902
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,400
It's so good for him
to get out of London.

903
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,400
Yes, it is.

904
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,600
You gave everyone suchpleasure when he was born.

905
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,040
Oh, good.

906
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,560
Of course, I was alwaysa great support of yours.

907
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:16,680
It's so important whenthere are children involved.

908
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:22,560
It would be quite terrible--
unthinkable-- for Edward

909
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,120
if anything should
happen to Hugo.

910
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,120
Yes, so nice to chat
with you like this.

911
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,200
I'd been meaning to,
you know, for some time.

01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,880
I want you to feel
that you really

somewhere to stay.

The police are after me.

REBECCA [ON SPEAKER]: Oh,that's your own fault.

924
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,600
You shouldn't have gone tothem in the first place.

925
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,520
I didn't!

Are you coming

938

It's in the stables.

939
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,320
We've called it
the eighth house.

940
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,800

You're looking well.
- You, too.

973
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,400
Thank you.

974
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,240
May I have my wife back, please.

975
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,240
Of course.

976
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,240
Thank you.

977
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,200
I think we should go
for a walk, my darling.

978
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,480
[WHISPERING] It's
very inconvenient.

979
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,960
Two ghastly policemen.

980
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,320
I thought they'd come
about the parking,

981
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,960
but they want to interview Hugo.

982
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,240
They're most insistent.

983
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,240
I'll see to it.

984
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,400
Rebecca?

985
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,840
Rebecca.

986
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,840
Ah.

987
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,080
An afterthought if
ever there was one.

988
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,120
I can't think what you
must have been thinking

989
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,040
of when you thought of her.

990
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:09,400
I must have been out of mymind when I thought of her.

991
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,080
Must have lost my mind.

992
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,120
Look, Hugo, it's
a bit cold for this.

993
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,560
I think we should go back.

994
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,400
I'm so sorry, my darling.

995
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,280
Thanks.

996
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,200
I want us to be alone tonight.

997
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:51,080
You look so beautiful tonight.

998
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:54,840
I've never seen you
look so beautiful.

999
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,680
Do you remember when
I first brought you

1000
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,520
here, when you first saw this?

1001
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,400
Captain?

1002
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,600
What have you done?

1003
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,560
Please, Hugo, don't do this.

1004
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,560
You're frightening me, Hugo.

1005
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,560
No one will disturb us here.

1006
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,880
Ginny, I love you so much.

1007
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,840
GINNY: What are you--

1008
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,840
Listen to me!

1009
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,320
Listen to me.

1010
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,280
I forgive you, Ginny,
just as you forgive me.

1011
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,840
GINNY: Don't do this.

1012
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,840
I'm scared.

1013
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,960
Ginny, don't be afraid.

1014
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,960
Come here, my darling.

1015
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,440

Shit, Jamie's here.

1021
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,800
Jamie, what the hell
are you doing here?

1022
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,800
Where's Hugo?

1023
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,760
You look dreadful.

1024
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,560
I want to see Hugo.

1025
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,040
You can't at the moment.

1026
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,000
Come on.

01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,120
Ah, Sergeant.

1029
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,840
I'm so sorry to have
kept you waiting.

1030
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,600
Rather hectic
evening, I'm afraid.

1031
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,760
Sorry to drag you away, sir.

1032
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,880
That's quite all right.

1033
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,800
Are they looking
after you, Waller?

1034
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:58,960
About the accident.

1035
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,080
Oh, yeah?

1036
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,280
We need to talk
to Captain Skinner

1037
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,240
before we proceed further.

1038
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,240
Of course.

1039
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,600
Anything that I can do to help.

1040
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:05,760
I--

1041
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,960
DETECTIVE: Have
you heard from him?

1042
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,840
Any idea of his whereabouts?

1043
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,720
No.

1044
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,600
DETECTIVE: But presumably younow a number of his friends.

1045
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,680
Will you excuse me forjust a few moments, Sergeant?

1046
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,600
DETECTIVE: This
shouldn't take long.

1047
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,240
Well, there are someguests who've just arrived,

1048
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,640
and I must attend to them.

1049
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,880
You know how it is.

1050
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,920
Thank you, Sergeant.

1051
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,680
Jamie, that the hell
have you been up to?

1052
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,560
Hm?

1053
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,480
Oh, look.

1054
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,600
We've got a gate crasher.

to worm his way in.

1060
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,240
I understand from
our hostess you

1061
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,200
weren't invited to this party.

1062
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,680
For God's sake.

1063
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,160
You're improperly dressed.

1064
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,200
And you're drunk.

1065
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,080
Look at him.

1066
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,040
Stay there!

01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,440
I want to talk to Hugo.

1072
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,680
Well, he doesn't
want to talk to you.

1073
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,840
None of us do.

1074
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,560
I just want to
talk to him, really.

1075
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,040
Stand up, Skinner.

1076
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,760
Your mother wants you, Hugo.

1077
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,200

Stand up, damn you.

Party's over.

1090
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,280

Get up.

1094
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,080
Don't look too
clever, do you old man?

1095
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,600
No.

1096
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,920
Time to get him home, I think.

1097
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,200
Yeah, come on.
