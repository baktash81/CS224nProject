2
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,269
Perhaps it's fate
that today is the 4th of July.

3
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,957
You will once again
be fighting for our freedom.

4
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:21,068
Not from tyranny,
oppression or persecution.

5
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:23,403
But from annihilation.

6
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:26,500
We're fighting for
our right to live.

7
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:38,475
We're fighting for
our right to live.

<font color="#80ffff">INDEPENDENCE DAY
RESURGENCE</font>

9
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:20,537
but as the day when
the world declared in one voice.

10
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:23,833
"We will not go
quietly into the night!"

11
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:26,929
"We will not vanish
without a fight!"

12
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:30,973
"We're going to live on!
We're going to survive."

13
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:35,450
Today, we celebrate our Independence...

14
00:02:40,146 --> 00:02:44,038
MORRRISTOWN
VIRGINIA

15
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:11,088
The countless lives that
we lost in the war of '96

16
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:13,991
did not perish in vain.

17
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:20,108
They inspired us to rise from the
ashes as one people of one world.

18
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:23,657
For 20 years the world has
seen no arm conflict.

19
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:27,026
Nations have put their
petty differences aside.

20
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:32,215
United, we rebuild our families,
our cities and our lives.

21
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,561
The fusion of human and alien technology
not only enable us to defy gravity

22
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:40,378
and travel with unimaginable speed.

23
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:44,687
It also made our planet
finally safe again.

24
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:48,574
- Great speech, Patty.
- Thank you, Madam President.

25
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:53,427
One moment.

26
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:01,361
We're ready for you, sir.

27
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,073
Captain Hiller.

28
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:08,908
- Welcome to the White House.
- It's great to be back.

29
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,985
I cannot tell you how proud
we are to have you flying our

30
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,765
- It's an honor, Madam President.
- Your father was a great man.

31
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,217
He'd be so proud.

32
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:20,881
I think you know the
Secretary of Defense.

33
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,141
- Sir.
- Nice to see you again, son.

34
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,727
And that one,
I don't have to introduce you to.

35
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:30,365
You're moving up in the world.

36
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,565
Say's America's knight
in shining armor.

37
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:34,460
Now you're the one
bagging the White House.

38
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:37,466
As an employee, I don't quite get
the same benefits as when I lived here.

39
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:38,462
- Captain.
- Yeah.

40
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,321
- We're ready for you.
- Thank you.

41
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,649
Dylan.

42
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:44,926
Be nice to Jake when
you see him up there.

43
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:59,340
Moon Tug-10, confirm position.

44
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,263
7 miles and closing.

45
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:07,920
The slowest trip of my life.

46
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:09,318
Hey, cheer up.

47
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:13,272
There're worse things you could be doing
than towing a half trillion dollar of weapon.

48
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,506
Yeah.
Well, I need a little more stimulation.

49
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:18,640
Hey, you know.
I'd never follow you up here.

50
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,833
Yeah, you did.
You get lonely without me.

51
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:24,894
I was the youngest valedictorian
in the history of the academy.

52
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,610
I could have been
stationed anywhere.

53
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:29,271
Like San Diego, you know?
Beaches, surfing.

54
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,072
- You never surf a day in you life.
- But I'm a fast learner.

55
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:34,911
And I got great balance.
Like a cat.

56
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,119
Cats hate water, Charlie.

57
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:39,759
4% to first thrust.

58
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:42,633
Roger.
Tug-10 reversing thrust, 4%.

59
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,311
The Tugs and the weapon
are on final approach.

60
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:46,864
They are in position, sir.

61
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,419
Docking in
3. 2. 1.

62
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:56,380
Initiate uncoupling sequence.

63
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:59,577
All Tugs disengage.

64
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:03,100
Trust there are only 36 women
on this moon base.

65
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,802
I'm sure one of them will
eventually come around, pal.

66
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:07,676
You know, it's not like
they all rejected me.

67
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,638
I happen to have standards.

68
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:13,263
- Whoa. What did you do?
- Nothing.

69
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,534
That didn't sound
like nothing!

70
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:18,009
Tug-10 collided
with the weapon.

71
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:20,896
The clamps are stuck.
They are not responding, sir.

72
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:22,920
All Tugs, take evasive action.

73
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:25,129
Pull back!
Pull back!

74
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:30,246
- Charlie, it's going to crash the base.
- I said, PULL BACK!

75
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:32,321
Uh, that's a negative, sir.

76
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:39,178
- This isn't a fire, Jake.
- Don't remind me!

77
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:42,078
Lieutenant Miller,
what are you idiots doing?

78
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:43,957
I don't know, sir.

79
00:06:45,757 --> 00:06:49,124
We're going to die!
This is how I die!

80
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,363
Sir, he's slowing the fall.

81
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,081
Go to your docking place.
I'm kicking into fusion drive.

82
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:06,110
Are you crazy?
We'll burn up.

83
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,505
Yeah, that's very possible.

84
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:14,581
Come on!

85
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:18,536
<font color="#ff8080">ENGINES OVERHEATING</font>

86
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:25,476
YES!
Yes!

87
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:27,961
It's actually working!

88
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:40,758
I honestly didn't think
that was going to work.

89
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,101
Uh, shit.
Jiang's coming in hot.

90
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:47,656
And he's got that look.

91
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,069
This is our base.

92
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,618
He knows we don't
speak Chinese, right?

93
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:52,612
You almost destroyed us.

94
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:55,096
- That was a close call, sir.
- You almost got us all killed.

95
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:57,459
Ah, yeah.
But then I saved everyone.

96
00:07:57,484 --> 00:08:00,895
You don't get credit for
cleaning up you own mess.

97
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:03,197
And you destroyed
one of our Tugs.

98
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,001
Uh, actually, sir.
If anybody's to blame I...

99
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,990
Sir, I lost my focus.
It won't happen again.

100
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:08,687
No, it won't.

101
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,807
You're grounded until further notice.

102
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:15,929
Can I still watch TV or...

103
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,297
You didn't have
to take the fall?

104
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:20,502
Yeah, well.
He already hates me, why break tradition.

105
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:25,243
Transport 103, ARP1

106
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:29,863
General Adams, we're being
directed to alien prison platform 1.

107
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:38,133
DEFENSE HEADQUARTERS

108
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,409
- General.
- This better be good.

109
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,994
My wife and I were enjoying
a very nice morning

110
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,108
in a very expensive
bed and breakfast.

111
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:47,618
Sorry, sir.

112
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:49,856
I thought you should see this.

113
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:51,619
Sir.

114
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:59,934
It started a couple
of hours ago.

115
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:03,048
Look how their behaviour changed.

116
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:08,111
After 20 years,
they are being catatonic.

117
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,332
Get me director Levinson.

118
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:11,974
We tried.

119
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:14,679
He's unreachable, sir.

120
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:18,689
RESEARCH MISSION
AFRICA

121
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:23,029
You need to take me seriously.

122
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,294
I've been chasing you across
the planet for 3 weeks now.

123
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,630
But, now that I have you.

124
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:28,452
Excuse me.
Who are you again?

125
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:31,061
Floyd Rosenberg,
government appointed controller.

126
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:32,291
Please be advised.

127
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:34,757
Entering hostile territories,
we should slow down.

128
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,379
We don't want to look like
we are posing a threat.

129
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,732
Now, we are going to
start with appendix 2.

130
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:40,998
I know a lot of people have a
negative reaction to being audited.

131
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:43,302
- But I actually find that it's a
  very constructive experience.
- Lloyd. Lloyd. Lloyd.

132
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:45,198
- It's Floyd.
- We have to meet a friend right now.

133
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:47,318
A great guy.
Come say hi.

134
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,540
Where are we?

135
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:59,091
Director Levinson.
Director Levinson.

136
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,770
Who are those men?

137
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:06,612
- It's Umbutu's rebel forces.
- The Warlord!

138
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,763
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

139
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:10,778
His old man just died.
And I hear that the son

140
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:12,919
is much more of a moderate.
But... uh.

141
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:14,910
Hey, fellas.
Howdy doody.

142
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:18,915
Say, uh.
I'm looking for Dikembe Umbutu.

143
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:23,059
I see you found their armory.

144
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:26,654
The one and only David Levinson.

145
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:29,001
Catherine.
Wow.

146
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:31,550
Wh.. um. What are you-
What are you doing here?

147
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:34,438
You don't think you're the
only expert he called, do you?

148
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:37,065
Um. I'm so surprise to see you.
A little bit.

149
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,795
I'm a little surprise that
you remember my name.

150
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,542
Hey, hey.
Come on.

151
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,135
Let's be...
Let's be professional.

152
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,345
Well. We both remembered
what happened the last time

153
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,284
we tried to be professional.

154
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:51,352
I'm sensing a affable tension here.

155
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:54,339
We've bumped into each other
in a few conferences.

156
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:56,016
I bet you have.

157
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:57,327
Shut up, Floyd.

158
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,681
Director Levinson, I'm sorry,
we're not done with our business here.

159
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,026
*Where are your papers?

160
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:04,512
- What papers?
- Uh, it looks like this.

161
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:10,214
So why does Umbutu junior
need a psychiatrist.

162
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,043
Unresolved daddy issues?

163
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:15,924
These people fought a grand war
with the aliens for 10 years.

164
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:18,351
Their connection is the
strongest I've ever seen.

165
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:22,908
It's as if their mind is tapped
into the aliens subconscious.

166
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:28,429
Yeah. Your obsession with the
'human-alien psychic residual condition'.

167
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,168
You, calling me obsessive.
That's cute.

168
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:47,783
How do they get the lights on?

169
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,532
We didn't.

170
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:55,823
It happened on it's own,
2 days ago.

171
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:05,240
Of course you're aware that this
is the only ship that landed in '96.

172
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:08,711
And so I appreciate you finally granting
us this access, Mr. Umbutu.

173
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:11,026
Your father was... very tenacious.

174
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,907
His pride caused the death of
more than half of my people.

175
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,791
- Including my brother.
- I'm so sorry.

176
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,772
- Becareful!
- Whoa!

177
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:19,481
Wow.

178
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:21,941
What happened here?

179
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,822
They were drilling.

180
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,147
For what?

181
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:27,196
Man, I don't know.

182
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,247
When did the drilling stop?

183
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:31,232
When you blew up the mother ship.

184
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:34,374
And uh. Right now for us,
anyway to get up there?

185
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,390
You're not afraid of heights,
are you?

186
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:40,934
Oh yes, I do.

187
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:15,975
Oh my god.

188
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:19,082
That's the same pattern.

189
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:24,853
So the signal was
coming from this ship.

190
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:28,723
20 years ago, when we
destroyed the mother ship,

191
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,927
we detected a burst in
an X-band frequency

192
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:35,258
directed towards deep space.

193
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:37,631
Oh.

194
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:52,743
The distress call.

195
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:59,135
Looks like someone picked up
the phone and answered.

196
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,490
I'm going crazy up here,
I can't take it anymore.

197
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:07,033
Tell me how much
you miss me.

198
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:10,393
Actually the chief of staff just
got a really handsome intern.

199
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:13,371
Not quite as tall as you,
but has great dimples,

200
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,295
and plays a cello.

201
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:18,352
- You know how much I miss you.
- You know what?

202
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:20,193
I'm going to steal a Tug and
come back to see you right now.

203
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:22,222
No, please don't.
Because the last time you did that,

204
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:23,555
they added a month
to your tour.

205
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,197
Come on. Tell me that wasn't
the best 2 minutes of your life.

206
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:27,641
Yes.
Yes.

207
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,818
But I would like my fiance
back permanently.

208
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:34,328
What was that?

209
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:37,517
We've been getting these power
surges for the last couple of days.

210
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,974
You take a look at the
houses I send you?

211
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,453
No, I haven't yet.
I just um...

212
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:45,516
It's okay.
There's no rush.

213
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:48,734
I saw Dylan at the
White House today.

214
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,787
I just think you two need
to have a conversation.

215
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:55,370
So he's shaking hands with the president
and I'm stuck on the moon.

216
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,038
Ha ha.
It must be nice.

217
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,249
You nearly killed him, remember.

218
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,419
Give him a little credit, Jake.

219
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:03,811
P?

220
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,195
<font color="#ff8080">CONNECTION LOST</font>
<font color="#80ffff">QQ</font>

221
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,584
Thank you for using QQ.

222
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:15,627
Ladies and gentlemen.

223
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:19,961
Please welcome the
international Legacy Squadron.

224
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:21,974
Captain Hiller

225
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:25,831
Considering he died during a test flight,
how do you feel taking off to the moon

226
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:28,639
from a hanger named
after your father.

227
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,528
He would have love it.

228
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,107
It's too bad he's
not here to see it.

229
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:36,059
Captain Lao, china has been integral
to the Earth Space Defense program,

230
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,791
is there anything you want to
say to the folks back home?

231
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:41,830
*To be on the same team that
represents the unity of the world...

232
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:45,145
I didn't want to text you,
I wanted to hear your voice.

233
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,722
What's wrong?

234
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,056
Nothing.

235
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:52,603
My boy, making a name for himself.

236
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:54,183
Are you going
to be okay, Mom?

237
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,880
Just tell me you'll
be careful up there.

238
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:01,875
Moon Base, this is Legacy Squadron.

239
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,565
We're on the final approach,
requesting permission to land.

240
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,269
Permission granted.
Welcome to the moon, Captain.

241
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,604
Just keep it cool.

242
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,994
It's easy.

243
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:36,183
Rain.
Rain.

244
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:44,087
Do I get an autograph too?

245
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:47,967
Back to work.

246
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:02,604
<font color="#ff80c0">Mengniu moon milk.</font>

247
00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:10,105
I have been looking
all over for you.

248
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:11,889
- I've got good news.
- Yeah.

249
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,909
The pilot the China sent
is my future wife

250
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:16,759
and I mean it.
I think my heart exploded.

251
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:20,334
It's like our souls
were communi...

252
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,239
He just walked in, didn't he?

253
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:25,842
Yeah, he did.

254
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,075
Okay.

255
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,159
You're not gonna finish this?

256
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,478
You mind moving?

257
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,637
We both know what happens
when you get in my way.

258
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,818
I've waited a long
time to do that.

259
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:56,065
Morrison.

260
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,732
What's going on here?

261
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:03,760
I asked you a QUESTION.

262
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:07,545
Yes. Uh.
Sir, the floor is very slippery.

263
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:09,563
Becareful if I were you.

264
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,662
Great to see you, Dylan.

265
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:20,711
I was so close to
punching him back.

266
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,639
I think you made
the right choice.

267
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:26,420
You did almost kill him, but...
that's why they have ejection seats.

268
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:28,581
No, I went too far.

269
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:33,821
It's the only way I thought
I could... stand out.

270
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,028
It was never going to be you
leading that squadron.

271
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:39,676
That's not the way
the world works.

272
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,826
You know he's royalty.

273
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,008
Bridges to office.

274
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:46,271
You know the last thing
I said to my parents was

275
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:48,010
I hated them.

276
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:53,114
The only reason I'm still alive
is they dropped me off

277
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:54,879
at that stupid camp.

278
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:57,025
Well, I'm glad they did.

279
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:03,420
Because you're the
only family I got.

280
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:08,097
Alright, final training time.
Winner leads the Legacy Squadron.

281
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:09,631
Why don't you just
give up, Morrison?

282
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:11,518
Second place would just
have to be good enough.

283
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:13,541
Yeah.
We'll see about that, Captain Hiller.

284
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,124
Passing on the Left!

285
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:16,677
Hey, there's not enough room!

286
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:18,371
Damn it, Jake.
You're going to clip my wing.

287
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:19,917
Control, I'm going down.

288
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:21,947
Ejecting!
Ejecting!

289
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:37,941
Dr. O'Brian, please report
to the surgical theater.

290
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:42,847
Good morning, Brakish.
How are we today?

291
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:44,790
I brought you a new one.

292
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:49,672
Dactylorhiza maculata, or
the spotted orchid.

293
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:52,776
And when it fully blooms,
the lavender...

294
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:55,320
is going to take
your breath away.

295
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,582
Can you believe it?

296
00:19:56,607 --> 00:20:00,418
You've been in a coma
for 7300 days.

297
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:05,105
I made you a gift.
I took a knitting class.

298
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,368
Is it itchy?

299
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:08,620
You tell me if it was itchy,
I'll...

300
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,443
Ah!

301
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:14,314
Okay.

302
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:16,178
You're awake.

303
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:18,823
Did...
Did we win?

304
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,652
Anne!
Bring in the medical team, he's awake!

305
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:26,419
Where's-Where's my glasses?
I can't see.

306
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:28,258
They're right here.
They're right here.

307
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:31,237
How long was I out?

308
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:33,462
A long time, baby.
A long time.

309
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:36,104
Yeah, I can see that.

310
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:39,800
Babe.
You got a bit fat.

311
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:42,989
And really bald.

312
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:51,830
You still look great.

313
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:53,797
This just came in from Hubble.

314
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:56,286
There's some kind of force
pulling in Saturn's rings.

315
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:58,786
Holy Christ.
What about our defense base there?

316
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:00,188
It's gone.

317
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:03,950
It's not just the base, it's like
the whole moon just vanished.

318
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:10,541
- Up the alert level to red.
- Right away.

319
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,234
Hey, honey.

320
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:19,041
Listen, I want you to
pack up your stuff

321
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:21,433
and go to your
sister's right now.

322
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:36,817
Well, but this symbol comes out more
often than anything I've encountered.

323
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:39,018
Look.
Look at the similarities.

324
00:21:39,043 --> 00:21:41,030
How can you not
see the relevance.

325
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:42,107
No, it's not that
I don't see it.

326
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:43,789
I just feel that right now
there are more pressing matters

327
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:44,872
than analyzing doodles.

328
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:46,871
You know, like a giant
space ship turning back on.

329
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:47,925
- Sir.
- Yeah.

330
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,085
- We lost all contact with Saturn.
- What?

331
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,096
- We need to notify the President.
- Already tried.

332
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:55,587
Tanner said he'll get back
to us after the press talk.

333
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:58,031
Bypass Tanner, hurry.
And you talk to Lanford now.

334
00:21:58,056 --> 00:22:00,676
- Right. Right. Right.
- Thank you.

335
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:07,108
Uh, at least your father
spared the elephants.

336
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:08,246
Good for him.

337
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:11,317
Look.
The Roswell crash, in '47.

338
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:14,363
The farmer who made contact
drew the same circle.

339
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:17,956
And everytime I interviewed one of
my patients and showed them this.

340
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:20,998
- They all expressed the same emotion.
- Mm-Hm.

341
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:22,228
Fear.

342
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:24,733
And I don't think
it's a circle.

343
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:26,300
The night the ship turned on.

344
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:29,582
I experienced the strongest
vision I've ever had.

345
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:35,145
And I drew this.

346
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:46,716
That's incredible.

347
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:49,443
How did you decipher
so much of their language?

348
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,631
They were hunting us.

349
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,799
We have to learn
how to hunt them.

350
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:02,698
- That means you're beautiful.
- Oh. Thanks, man.

351
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:03,842
Not you.
I mean...

352
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:05,731
You have to remove
the sub-sonic inlets

353
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:08,372
before you can reconfigure the
thermalize plasma cartridges.

354
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:10,622
That's great. Why don't you put
that thing down and help me?

355
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:12,665
Okay. Try to have a good
grasp of today's situation.

356
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,637
There she is.
Ah.

357
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:16,209
- It's happening.
- God damn it.

358
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:17,735
The chemical reaction,
the pheromones.

359
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,749
All the blood of my body
is rushing to my head.

360
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,795
Your head, huh.

361
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,861
- I'm going to go introduce myself.
- Yeah, no problem.

362
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,526
God.
SHIT!

363
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:27,909
So.

364
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:30,515
You must the pilot China sent.

365
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,411
- Did the giant flag give it away?
- There's that.

366
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:35,465
In fact, I heard you speaking
Chinese earlier anyway

367
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,374
I was wondering if you
want to get a drink,

368
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,129
maybe fall in love.

369
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:44,131
- Aren't you a little young for that?
- I'm 23 and I have.

370
00:23:52,999 --> 00:24:00,871
All personnel, report to
your stations immediately.

371
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:05,021
Arm the primary.

372
00:24:16,503 --> 00:24:18,496
- Get me the Security Council.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:24:18,521 --> 00:24:19,928
On screen.

374
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,182
- Sir.
- Yeah.

375
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:31,939
This just came in.

376
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:36,784
It was a spaceship.

377
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:46,047
Madam President, the heads
of state are coming online.

378
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,668
David, are you seeing this?

379
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:51,382
Yes, Madam President.
I'm looking right at it.

380
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:57,087
They could be initiating an attack.
We need to strike first.

381
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:58,146
Uh, hold on.

382
00:24:58,171 --> 00:24:59,493
Hang on a second.
To my eye,

383
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:02,140
the design and technology
of this ship

384
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:04,121
is nothing like the ones
that attacked us.

385
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:05,562
I'm telling you
this is not them.

386
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,814
- And what if you're wrong?
- If you're wrong,

387
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,335
we could be starting a war
with a whole new species.

388
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,276
At this point, we know the
Saturn base has been destroyed.

389
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:16,545
Madam President, this could very
well be a coordinated attack.

390
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:19,907
- Get the cannon into firing position.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:23,872
We should be cautious
and listen to Director Levinson.

392
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,576
How does the rest
of the Council feel?

393
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:27,503
Let's hold off until
we know more.

394
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:30,728
We have to be decisive.
I vote to attack.

395
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:33,281
I also vote to strike.

396
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:38,173
Madam President,
I need an answer.

397
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:41,404
Take them out, Commander.

398
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:43,766
We are locked on.

399
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,851
I think this is a mistake.
Let's take another moment...

400
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:47,228
Fire!

401
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:07,654
Get me an image.

402
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,306
It crashed into
Van de Graaff crater.

403
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:13,725
We are not picking up
any signs of life.

404
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:16,582
Let's hope to god
we did the right thing.

405
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:19,755
Madam President, we need to send
a team up to investigate the wreckage.

406
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,193
We need to know who
we just shot down.

407
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:24,430
There's no sign of life and
the threat has been neutralized.

408
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:27,444
We can send a team up,
but David needs to be in DC.

409
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,592
No, oh.
Can we not make this political.

410
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:31,977
I need to get up there
and get answers.

411
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:36,262
David, you can lead a team up there,
but after the celebration.

412
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:37,574
You heard the President.

413
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,591
I'll expect to see you next to us
tomorrow wearing your best smile.

414
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:42,719
You want to see
my best smile?

415
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,622
<font color="#ff8080">CONNECTION TERMINATED.</font>

416
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:46,317
Did he just
hang up on me?

417
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:48,470
Sure sounded that way to me, sir.

418
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:52,716
Where are you going?

419
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:53,759
Jake.

420
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:55,261
I really think you should
think this through.

421
00:26:55,286 --> 00:26:58,981
Okay, everyone get out!
I'm taking off.

422
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:03,868
Wait wait wait...
Our Tug's not gonna fly.

423
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:06,023
That's why we're taking Mike's Tug.

424
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:08,330
Oh, Jiang is not going to like this.

425
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:12,535
At approximately 2100 hours,
Earth Space Defense program

426
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,401
repelled an alien attack
targeting our planet.

427
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:20,712
It wasn't them.

428
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:23,320
- You can't know that for sure.
- It wasn't them.

429
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:26,167
- I have to tell the world.
- Sir, it's time for your meds.

430
00:27:26,192 --> 00:27:27,871
I have to talk to the
Joint chiefs of Staff!

431
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,701
Matthew, can you just
give us a second, please.

432
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,802
You shouldn't be wasting your
time with a crazy old man.

433
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:40,589
You gave up flying
to take care of me

434
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:42,602
and I know how
much you loved it.

435
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,616
You should be with Jake.

436
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:47,579
He's on the moon, remember?

437
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,083
And then you should be
with the President.

438
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:54,137
I am with the President.

439
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:57,879
They are coming back.

440
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:02,477
And this time we won't
be able to stop them.

441
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,664
I will avenge you, brother.

442
00:28:37,313 --> 00:28:39,529
Hey, wait wait wait.
I need a receipt!

443
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:53,528
So how do you
know this guy?

444
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:57,099
Oh.
He's Patricia Whitmore's fiance.

445
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,241
Thank you so much.

446
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:59,722
- Good job, Collins.
- Sir.

447
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:01,455
Someone called a cab?

448
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,252
- Thanks for doing this, Jake.
- No problem.

449
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:05,178
Let's get moving though
'cause I kinda stole this thing.

450
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:06,949
- I'm coming with you.
- Uh, you know.

451
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:08,987
This is an ESD operation.

452
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:13,116
Strictly off limits to
all civilians and warlords.

453
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:14,596
I let you in.

454
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:17,347
It would be wise for you
to return the favor.

455
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,346
There he goes.
Where's he going?

456
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:28,127
- Oh, I'm coming too.
- Catherine.

457
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:29,874
Look, something is
drawing him out there

458
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:31,162
and I'm going to
find out what.

459
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,422
Excuse me.
Uh, Director Levinson.

460
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:34,953
Where the heck do you
think you are going?

461
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:36,880
Why don't you join us, Floyd?
Everyone else is.

462
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:39,146
- Might do you some good.
- No. No no no.

463
00:29:39,171 --> 00:29:41,243
You're not getting on that thing
and neither am I.

464
00:29:41,268 --> 00:29:43,686
Okay, we're going to stay here.
And we're gonna...

465
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,338
Hi.

466
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:50,167
I've never been in a Space Tug before,
is there anything I should know?

467
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:52,111
There's a lot you should know.

468
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:55,559
Seat belt.
Obviously.

469
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:58,490
David, why don't you take a seat.

470
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:00,841
- Re-Really? In the...
- What's the matter? You nervous?

471
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,742
Uh.
You know, it's not my favourite.

472
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,596
Oh, don't worry.
I haven't crash in...

473
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:09,050
... a couple of days.
But that was intentional.

474
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,372
What?

475
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:12,190
Okay, here we go.

476
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:19,269
God.
I forgot how much I hate this.

477
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,261
- Bye!
- Bye.

478
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:38,479
That wasn't so bad.

479
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,565
I haven't kicked on
the fusion drive yet.

480
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,706
Huh?

481
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:55,961
And in our darkest moment,
when all hope was lost.

482
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:58,431
I said, "Never give up."

483
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:00,688
"You have to have faith."

484
00:31:00,713 --> 00:31:03,167
And in that moment,
it came to me.

485
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:06,070
Pow!
Like a thunderbolt.

486
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:11,265
And that's when I came up with
the idea that saved the world.

487
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:14,724
Yeah.

488
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,327
Uh, sir?

489
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,010
- Huh?
- Ah, there he is.

490
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,687
Welcome back.

491
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:26,825
This book is a bargain!
9.95

492
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,212
It makes a great gift
for your grandchildren.

493
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:31,277
If you're lucky enough
to have any.

494
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:33,712
Are you ready to go, Mr. Trest.

495
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:36,035
Don't rush.

496
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:39,692
Dad, you awake?

497
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,725
I thought we could watch
the celebration on TV together.

498
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,530
Matthew!

499
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:58,626
What was that?

500
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:01,674
We're flying through the
old mother ship's debris field.

501
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:09,362
Don't worry.
These are basically space tanks.

502
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:11,501
Space tanks, huh.

503
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,594
Coming up to the
Van de Graaff crater.

504
00:32:21,621 --> 00:32:25,055
There it is.
That's the crash site.

505
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:38,593
Today, we are honored to be
in the presence of some of the

506
00:32:38,618 --> 00:32:42,689
brave men and women, who
defied insurmountable odds

507
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:47,189
and lead us to victory over
alien invaders 2 decades ago.

508
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:52,024
General Grey and his
beautiful wife, Audrey.

509
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,342
We thank you for your
unwavering leadership.

510
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:02,938
Jackson.
Where the hell is Levinson?

511
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,594
So what are we looking for?

512
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:08,228
Well, I'm hoping
we'll know when we see it.

513
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,245
Is there a way of seeing
what they are seeing?

514
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,139
You can even talk to them.

515
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,255
Nice tattoos.

516
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:19,306
That's how many aliens
you killed, right?

517
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,636
So.
How did you do it?

518
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:25,683
You have to get
them from behind.

519
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:32,231
Catherine.

520
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:36,927
I think I just found
another one of your doodles.

521
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:40,239
Charlie.

522
00:33:40,264 --> 00:33:44,015
Tell commander to prep
the lab at Area 51.

523
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:53,382
How's it looking out there,
Captain Hiller?

524
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:57,104
It's truly humbling to see how beautiful
Earth is from here, Madam President.

525
00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:00,008
On this day, in 1996,

526
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:02,467
President Whitmore passionately declared,

527
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:05,700
"We will not go
quietly into the night!"

528
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:07,657
and we did not.

529
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:09,909
It's President Whitmore!

530
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:12,772
What a surprise.

531
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:16,150
Ladies and gentlemen,
another great war hero.

532
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:19,508
The one and only,
President Thomas Whitmore.

533
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:21,921
Please say a few words!

534
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,091
Today...

535
00:34:26,975 --> 00:34:28,682
... I'm not going to.

536
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,029
I... came to warn you.

537
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:37,796
Dad?

538
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,384
Dad.

539
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:13,383
Help me.

540
00:35:17,012 --> 00:35:20,878
That is definitely...
bigger than the last one.

541
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:29,549
Shit.

542
00:35:29,732 --> 00:35:31,359
Hey, Charlie.

543
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:33,310
I think you better
come and get us.

544
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,692
The sooner the better.

545
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:40,632
- AS IN RIGHT NOW!
- I'm already on it.

546
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:43,692
Everybody strap in!
It's going to get bumpy!

547
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,184
Charlie, where the hell are you?

548
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:53,718
Flying through my worst nightmare.

549
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:10,464
David!

550
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:12,514
Grab my hand!

551
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,266
Come on!
Reach!

552
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:16,959
We're in, close the ram!

553
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:21,286
This just came in from
one of our lunar satellites.

554
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:24,829
The ship is more than
3,000 miles in diameter.

555
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:28,049
How the hell
did we miss this?

556
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:32,200
Activate all our defense systems
and shut down the celebration.

557
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:34,679
Attention. Attention.
We have an emergency situation.

558
00:36:34,704 --> 00:36:37,240
Let's go, move.
Get her out of here.

559
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:40,033
Please leave the premises
in a calm and orderly fashion.

560
00:36:40,058 --> 00:36:40,997
I repeat.

561
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:44,325
Please leave the premises
in a calm and orderly fashion.

562
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,278
- We got to move!
- Not without that piece.

563
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:47,415
Yeah, I thought you
were going to say that.

564
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,052
Charlie, get on the arms.

565
00:36:57,388 --> 00:36:59,400
Talk to me, Charlie.

566
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,995
What's happening?

567
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,550
- Damn it.
- What do you mean, damn it?

568
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:04,060
I'm trying my best.

569
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:06,342
Stop fighting, just grab it.

570
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:13,248
Got it!
Go. Go.

571
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,626
There's a flying mountain
coming right for us.

572
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,492
Hold on!

573
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:38,563
Oh shit.
I'm losing speed.

574
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:40,747
Jesus, it has it's own gravity.

575
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:43,669
- What does that mean?
- It means we're going for a ride.

576
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:46,319
You mean we're stuck
under this thing?

577
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:51,840
Arm the primary.

578
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:59,160
We're powered up
and locked on.

579
00:38:00,305 --> 00:38:01,651
Fire!

580
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:08,640
<font color="#ff80c0">Negative impact.</font>

581
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,838
<font color="#ff80c0">Negative impact.</font>

582
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:16,895
Permission to engage.

583
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,590
Negative. Negative.
All fighters clear the blast zone.

584
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:22,007
Arm the primary
and fire again!

585
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:27,944
Above us.
Something is happening.

586
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:29,717
Sir.

587
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,103
Evacuate!
EVERYONE!

588
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,958
Go.
Go!

589
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:42,580
Uncle Jiang, hurry!

590
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:53,811
Rain, watch out!

591
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:03,190
All fighters, fall back.
Fall back!

592
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,540
Copy.

593
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:11,945
It's projected to enter
Earth's atmosphere in 22 minutes.

594
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,747
If it doesn't alter
it current velocity,

595
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:15,484
it's going to crack
the planet in half.

596
00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:17,102
We're not going to let
that happen, Tanner.

597
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:20,029
- Initiate the orbital defense system.
- Yes, ma'am.

598
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:27,102
General Adams, we are primed
and ready to fire.

599
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:30,116
Initiate simultaneous count down.

600
00:39:30,865 --> 00:39:33,704
Roger, command.
Syncing now.

601
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:38,638
<font color="#ff80c0">Starting count down.</font>

602
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:41,254
10. 9. 8.

603
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,653
Here we go again.

604
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:48,419
5. 4. 3. 2.

605
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:55,862
General, the Asian Pacific defense system
went off line before they can fire.

606
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,058
Yes, sir.
Copy that!

607
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,046
Jake's alive!
He radioed us from the moon!

608
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:05,489
He's with Director Levinson!
They're on their way to Area 51!

609
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:08,231
That Hercules right there
is on standby.

610
00:40:08,256 --> 00:40:11,148
President Lanford just rolled in,
make a hole.

611
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:14,018
Madam President, can you take
my father to Cheyenne Mountain?

612
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:16,791
- Yes, of course.
- I'm going with you, Patty.

613
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:18,066
Dad.

614
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:20,028
You're going to need me.

615
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:26,146
- Wish us luck.
- Ma'am, we have to go.

616
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,858
Director Levinson.

617
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:43,656
I'm going to talk
to my supervisor

618
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:46,355
to make sure you get all
the money you need!

619
00:40:46,749 --> 00:40:49,030
What are those green light?

620
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:55,315
I want you to help us, quickly.

621
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,864
Help!

622
00:40:58,224 --> 00:41:01,266
Help!
Let's go!

623
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:05,599
Hey!
Where are you going?

624
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:55,537
The ship will touch down
over the Atlantic.

625
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:57,685
- Which part?
- All of it, ma'am.

626
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,336
Issue evacuation order
for every coastline.

627
00:42:00,363 --> 00:42:01,827
I don't think there's time.

628
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,860
So what's the plan?

629
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:05,461
We have less than 20 minutes to
get every patient out of here.

630
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:06,635
- Move.
- Yes, ma'am.

631
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,796
We still have two in surgery.

632
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:10,501
- Get them to post-op
  as fast as you can.
- Absolutely.

633
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:14,365
Help, please.

634
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,674
I got you, honey.
I'm not going to leave you.

635
00:42:27,484 --> 00:42:30,098
What goes up,
must come down.

636
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:34,063
Don't worry, we're
in a controlled dive!

637
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:37,380
- Falling. It's called falling.
- No, controlled dive.

638
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:06,260
Nice.
Nice.

639
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:09,210
Jesus.

640
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,935
They like to get the landmarks.

641
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:30,136
Are we dead?

642
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:31,718
We're okay.

643
00:43:32,939 --> 00:43:34,440
You peed in your pants?

644
00:43:34,465 --> 00:43:36,113
Uh, yeah.

645
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:38,018
Yeah, me too.

646
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:41,640
.

647
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:44,412
We can access the
trench through here.

648
00:43:44,437 --> 00:43:46,910
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm, a 100%.

649
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:49,154
This, right here.
That's the best way in.

650
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:50,613
Yeah, we got it.

651
00:43:51,204 --> 00:43:53,387
Captain, they are ordering
all ships out of the area.

652
00:43:53,412 --> 00:43:56,637
That's a 100 million dollars
worth of gold on that ship.

653
00:43:56,804 --> 00:44:00,034
They think we're going to leave it,
they're out of their minds.

654
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:03,493
Captain.
You better come and see this.

655
00:44:45,555 --> 00:44:48,698
To all aircraft within
the sound of my voice,

656
00:44:48,723 --> 00:44:52,000
we expect the devastation to the
east coast to be beyond imagination.

657
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:55,915
The rally point for all remaining
aircraft is Area 51.

658
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,696
Rain, you take the lead.
I'll meet you there.

659
00:44:58,721 --> 00:45:00,822
I got to see about someone.

660
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:02,548
Good luck.

661
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:12,894
- You okay?
- My mother lives in London.

662
00:45:13,436 --> 00:45:15,413
Maybe she made it out.

663
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:18,053
Yeah.
Maybe.

664
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,099
- Dad, where are you?
- On my boat, where else.

665
00:45:25,124 --> 00:45:28,534
David, this one is definitely
bigger than the last one.

666
00:45:30,323 --> 00:45:32,501
You can see it?
Uh, listen to me.

667
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:34,925
You have to get to shore
as fast as you can.

668
00:45:35,171 --> 00:45:36,063
Dad!

669
00:45:36,088 --> 00:45:37,633
David.
David!

670
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:45,112
Oh, sweet Moses.

671
00:45:54,095 --> 00:45:56,595
Wait!
Wait!

672
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,033
Wait!

673
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:06,937
- We're going to die!
- No. No.

674
00:46:06,962 --> 00:46:09,788
Look at me. Look at me.
We are not going to die.

675
00:46:09,813 --> 00:46:11,550
Marine 3, clear.

676
00:46:11,575 --> 00:46:15,256
I got bodies on the hospital roof
that need immediate evac!

677
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,055
I got you.
I got you.

678
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,763
Yes!
Yes.

679
00:46:22,788 --> 00:46:24,597
Come on, let's go.

680
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,092
Hand him the baby.
It's okay.

681
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,752
Okay.
Please becareful.

682
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:30,441
You're going to be alright.
He's got her.

683
00:46:30,466 --> 00:46:31,588
Get on board.
Get on board.

684
00:46:31,613 --> 00:46:33,289
We got to go right now!

685
00:46:34,303 --> 00:46:35,739
Good girl.

686
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,000
MOM!

687
00:46:38,025 --> 00:46:40,346
Pull her up!
Pull her up!

688
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:42,662
No!
No, mom!

689
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:45,027
Nooooo!

690
00:46:49,923 --> 00:46:52,004
Whoa. Whoa.
Oh my!

691
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,888
Why did I buy this boat?

692
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,783
Whoa.
Whoa.

693
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:30,306
Glad to have you back, Mr. President.
It's been far too long.

694
00:47:30,331 --> 00:47:31,731
Thank you.

695
00:47:31,756 --> 00:47:34,589
- Is David Levinson here?
- Not yet.

696
00:47:34,614 --> 00:47:37,368
Morrison's tug is still
10 minutes out.

697
00:47:37,393 --> 00:47:39,567
Have them meet us
at the prison.

698
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:41,911
We need to interrogate one.

699
00:48:17,899 --> 00:48:19,292
What the...

700
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:26,023
It's gotten worse.

701
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,583
Much worse.

702
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,477
Mr. President?

703
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:34,522
Dr. Okun.

704
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,763
- You're awake.
- Very much so.

705
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:40,948
Why are they screaming?

706
00:48:40,973 --> 00:48:42,694
No.
No, no, no.

707
00:48:42,718 --> 00:48:46,494
They-They...
They're not screaming.

708
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,382
They're celebrating.

709
00:48:58,517 --> 00:49:01,783
General, one of the prison cells
is docking with the chamber.

710
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:03,085
Where's my dad?

711
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,697
- I... I think he went in there.
- Get the weapons!

712
00:49:05,722 --> 00:49:07,543
Let's go!
Let's go!

713
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,830
We have alien guns?

714
00:49:10,932 --> 00:49:12,259
<font color="#ff8080">OVERRIDE </font>SYSTEM
<font color="#ff8080">CHAMBER LOCK</font>

715
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:15,172
<font color="#ff80c0">Isolation chamber activated.</font>

716
00:49:22,695 --> 00:49:24,684
How did he get in here?

717
00:49:25,237 --> 00:49:26,844
Dad, it's too dangerous.

718
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:28,775
- Someone get him out of there.
- He overrode the system.

719
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,484
Sir, please unlock the door!

720
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,992
Don't you worry about me.

721
00:49:32,017 --> 00:49:34,892
Just get as many
answers as you can.

722
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:36,481
No.
Don't!

723
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:49,340
Whitmore locked himself in.

724
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:06,651
Can you hear us?

725
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:10,532
She has arrived.

726
00:50:11,485 --> 00:50:13,054
Who is she?

727
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:17,136
She... is all.

728
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,584
What does she want?

729
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:29,093
What does this mean?
What does this symbol mean?

730
00:50:29,372 --> 00:50:31,643
Why are you afraid of it?

731
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:35,414
- It's killing him!
- That's enough!

732
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:37,713
Move!
Kill it now!

733
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:16,162
Dad?

734
00:51:16,316 --> 00:51:17,856
Daddy?
Daddy?

735
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:23,013
- He's breathing.
- Someone call a medical team.

736
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,324
Is it dead?

737
00:51:30,843 --> 00:51:34,619
I told you.
You kill them from behind.

738
00:51:39,353 --> 00:51:41,602
Daisy, stop crying.

739
00:51:41,627 --> 00:51:43,541
She's scared, okay.

740
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:46,125
I want Mom.

741
00:51:46,883 --> 00:51:48,292
We'll find her.

742
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:49,579
They're both dead.

743
00:51:49,604 --> 00:51:51,710
Just shut up, okay.
That's enough.

744
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:54,733
- You don't even have your license.
- Um, look around you.

745
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:56,884
You think anyone's
going to pull us over?

746
00:51:56,909 --> 00:52:00,291
The radio said to go inland
so that's where I'm going.

747
00:52:02,448 --> 00:52:05,193
- There's a guy in that boat!
- I am not stopping, alright.

748
00:52:05,218 --> 00:52:06,522
Look, he was moving.

749
00:52:06,547 --> 00:52:09,094
- He needs our help.
- Sam, stop the car.

750
00:52:09,983 --> 00:52:12,081
Unbelievable.

751
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,553
Hurry up, okay.

752
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:28,343
I think he's just knocked out!

753
00:52:32,104 --> 00:52:34,172
I don't think it's
a coincidence that

754
00:52:34,197 --> 00:52:36,279
this thing showed up
just before they did.

755
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:37,671
- You know, I think you're right.
- Brakish.

756
00:52:37,703 --> 00:52:39,517
You should be in bed, babe.

757
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:42,285
Where.
Where did you get this?

758
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:43,234
That's uh.

759
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:45,729
That's from a ship
that we shot down.

760
00:52:45,754 --> 00:52:48,054
We need to cut this open.

761
00:52:49,327 --> 00:52:52,548
Director Levinson, proceed to
command center immediately.

762
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:54,877
Call us as soon as
you have anything.

763
00:52:54,902 --> 00:52:57,321
Come on, people.
Move.

764
00:52:57,346 --> 00:53:01,244
Baby, I'm so happy that you
want to dive back into work.

765
00:53:01,269 --> 00:53:04,596
- Maybe we should get you some pants.
- Pants?

766
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,890
Oh.
Alright, go on!

767
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:09,014
Why didn't you tell me
my butt was hanging out?

768
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:14,107
We have infrared
of the alien ship, sir.

769
00:53:16,352 --> 00:53:19,984
- Are those dots...
- That must be aliens.

770
00:53:20,554 --> 00:53:23,531
What's that mass?
Enlarge the section, please.

771
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:27,174
That's what our prisoner alien
meant by...

772
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,362
"She is all."

773
00:53:29,387 --> 00:53:32,942
Director Levinson, I have Cheyenne Mountain
and the remaining world leaders online.

774
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:34,950
- David, what can you tell us?
- Ma'am.

775
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:36,949
They are like a hive and I think
we've just found their queen.

776
00:53:36,974 --> 00:53:39,714
Their... very big queen.

777
00:53:39,746 --> 00:53:41,512
This is an infrared image
of their ship

778
00:53:41,537 --> 00:53:43,227
and we think that's her,
Madam President.

779
00:53:43,267 --> 00:53:45,426
- Right there in the middle.
- Christ almighty.

780
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:48,245
General Adams, we have a live feed
from our reconnaissance aircraft.

781
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,373
- Great. Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

782
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,069
David, is this one of their plasma drills
you briefed us about?

783
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:04,965
Yeah, I believe so.

784
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,968
The funnel is over
a mile in diameter, sir.

785
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:13,272
That's 20 times bigger
than the one in Africa.

786
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:15,582
I think they're after
our molten core.

787
00:54:15,607 --> 00:54:17,872
Which means no magnetic fields.

788
00:54:17,897 --> 00:54:22,357
Our atmosphere evaporate basically
the end of life on this planet.

789
00:54:22,382 --> 00:54:24,885
Oh, so you are saying
we're already finished.

790
00:54:25,572 --> 00:54:28,843
Not necessarily.
Back in '96,

791
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:31,990
the drilling in Africa stops when
we blew up their mother ship.

792
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:34,404
There must be a queen up
there that we didn't know about.

793
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:36,187
Assuming this hive theory holds true.

794
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:39,817
General, if we could blow up this
queen, maybe it could work again.

795
00:54:39,842 --> 00:54:44,223
Alright then. I'm authorizing
an immediate retaliatory strike.

796
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:45,348
Let's do it.

797
00:54:45,373 --> 00:54:46,865
- Scramble the fighters.
- Right away.

798
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,829
- Go get them.
- Attention. All pilots report to mission briefing in ...

799
00:54:57,723 --> 00:54:58,937
Hey.

800
00:55:08,212 --> 00:55:10,843
Come find me after
the briefing, okay?

801
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:21,843
Suit up, boys.

802
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,065
I'm so sorry, Dylan.

803
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,404
I was right there, man.

804
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:52,491
I couldn't save her.
It's too late.

805
00:55:53,196 --> 00:55:54,644
Look. I know I am
probably the last person

806
00:55:54,669 --> 00:55:56,746
you want to hear
from right now.

807
00:55:58,224 --> 00:56:00,197
But I've been where you are.

808
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:03,894
And I know how
deep it hurts.

809
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,374
She wouldn't want
you to give up now.

810
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,690
Come on, man,
you got to lead us.

811
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,258
See you up there, Lieutenant.

812
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:38,692
Good afternoon.

813
00:56:39,264 --> 00:56:41,590
This red mass on
top of the ship,

814
00:56:41,615 --> 00:56:42,762
that's your target.

815
00:56:42,787 --> 00:56:44,711
We're gonna send a fleet of
drones to go ahead of you

816
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:46,259
and disable their shields.

817
00:56:46,284 --> 00:56:49,363
You mission,
is to fly cover

818
00:56:49,388 --> 00:56:53,137
for the bombers who will be
armed with cold-fusion warheads.

819
00:56:53,162 --> 00:56:55,727
Now, the blast should
penetrate the hull

820
00:56:55,752 --> 00:56:57,807
and kill that alien queen.

821
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,828
Captain Hiller will brief
you on the flight plan.

822
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,546
We'll all try to converge
at the same time.

823
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:08,790
But whoever gets to the target first,
will deliver the payload.

824
00:57:08,965 --> 00:57:10,700
We have to expect
that they're going to

825
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:13,611
come at us with
everything they got.

826
00:57:14,624 --> 00:57:17,505
So protect the bombers
at all cost.

827
00:57:18,193 --> 00:57:20,835
We all lost someone
that we loved.

828
00:57:21,983 --> 00:57:24,013
So let's do it for them.

829
00:57:24,563 --> 00:57:27,197
Alpha launch in 1 minute.

830
00:57:27,222 --> 00:57:28,549
Jake.

831
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,423
I'm coming back.

832
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:37,774
I promise.

833
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,853
Make them pay.

834
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,955
I'm not going out there
to make friends, right?

835
00:57:58,345 --> 00:58:00,264
I looked at the houses.

836
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:04,783
The one on Harrison Street,
with the stone walkway.

837
00:58:04,808 --> 00:58:06,570
If it's still there.

838
00:58:11,953 --> 00:58:13,854
Okay.
It's getting real.

839
00:58:13,879 --> 00:58:16,571
It's getting real, real.

840
00:58:16,882 --> 00:58:19,583
Alright, form up.
On me.

841
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:23,893
It's the 4th of July.
So show them some fireworks.

842
00:58:58,346 --> 00:58:59,900
I want you to give me
one of your katana blades

843
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:02,198
and teach me everything you know.

844
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,271
Fine.

845
00:59:04,296 --> 00:59:06,438
You know what?
I'll figure something out.

846
00:59:13,565 --> 00:59:15,389
What are you idiots doing?

847
00:59:16,516 --> 00:59:18,420
The world's going to an end.

848
00:59:18,445 --> 00:59:21,175
- Even worse, we lost the gold.
- Mm-hm.

849
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,255
So we thought
we drink a little!

850
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,644
US government is on the line.

851
00:59:24,669 --> 00:59:26,395
They say the aliens are
drilling to the Earth's core

852
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,271
and they are looking for a ship in
the area to monitor their progress.

853
00:59:29,296 --> 00:59:30,973
We're the only ones left.

854
00:59:31,059 --> 00:59:35,082
Tell them we'll do it,
for a hundred million dollars.

855
00:59:39,332 --> 00:59:40,877
Look at this guy.
Weee.

856
00:59:40,902 --> 00:59:42,481
Yeah, hold on a second.

857
00:59:43,024 --> 00:59:43,852
He's drunk.

858
00:59:43,877 --> 00:59:45,709
They say it's a deal.

859
00:59:54,945 --> 00:59:56,908
Look, Sam.
They are going off road.

860
00:59:56,933 --> 00:59:58,485
Maybe we should do the same.

861
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:01,014
Dear god!
Ouch. Ouch.

862
01:00:01,738 --> 01:00:04,308
- What the hell happened here?
- We rescued you.

863
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:06,140
Oh, thank you.

864
01:00:06,165 --> 01:00:07,859
Is this really you?

865
01:00:08,419 --> 01:00:10,488
Well, of course it's me.
Who else would it be?

866
01:00:10,513 --> 01:00:12,769
- What's your son like?
- Can you get us his autograph?

867
01:00:12,794 --> 01:00:14,076
How often do you see him?

868
01:00:14,101 --> 01:00:17,884
These days we only see each other
at Thanksgiving but unfortunately...

869
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:20,059
unless he had to cancel.

870
01:00:20,836 --> 01:00:24,353
What about you?
Where are your parents?

871
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:25,729
Um.

872
01:00:26,909 --> 01:00:29,744
Visiting our grandparents in Florida.

873
01:00:29,769 --> 01:00:31,242
Oh, I see.

874
01:00:31,267 --> 01:00:33,338
Where should we go, Mr. Levinson?

875
01:00:34,494 --> 01:00:37,305
I think the safest place for
all of us to be right now

876
01:00:37,339 --> 01:00:39,041
is by my David.

877
01:00:39,066 --> 01:00:40,935
Since you're the leading
expert in this condition,

878
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,496
I really want you to see this.

879
01:00:42,521 --> 01:00:46,175
How can his connection
be so strong?

880
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,830
During the first attack,
he was exposed

881
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:51,891
to their collective mind.
It was completely unfiltered.

882
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:54,383
- I need to ask him about this.
- I already have.

883
01:00:54,408 --> 01:00:56,838
He doesn't even
remember drawing them.

884
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,424
Okay.
Let's try this baby on for size.

885
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,820
You know, I helped bring
that thing back from space.

886
01:01:03,845 --> 01:01:06,194
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah.

887
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:07,766
Back off.

888
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:09,458
Yeah.
Of course.

889
01:01:26,028 --> 01:01:27,750
Command, we have visual.

890
01:01:27,775 --> 01:01:29,969
Roger, Captain Hiller.
Continue approach.

891
01:01:29,994 --> 01:01:31,791
Mission is a go.

892
01:01:37,482 --> 01:01:38,596
Bay 18, sir.

893
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:40,222
Why did you put it
all the way up there?

894
01:01:40,247 --> 01:01:42,799
Give me that.
Get the ladder down there, come on.

895
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,608
You couldn't leave it
on the bottom shelf?

896
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:46,229
Here we go.

897
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:49,322
Alright.
I'm coming for you, baby.

898
01:01:49,347 --> 01:01:50,693
There she is.

899
01:01:50,718 --> 01:01:52,680
What is it?
An alien laser?

900
01:01:52,705 --> 01:01:56,532
Nope.
That's the Okun laser.

901
01:02:02,641 --> 01:02:06,798
- Why aren't they attacking us?
- Becareful what you wished for.

902
01:02:09,187 --> 01:02:12,557
There's the queen ship.
Bombers, prepare to drop!

903
01:02:14,153 --> 01:02:16,651
You just had to jinx us!

904
01:02:16,676 --> 01:02:17,898
Bank right!
Bank right!

905
01:02:17,923 --> 01:02:19,438
Evade!
Evade!

906
01:02:19,463 --> 01:02:21,213
God!

907
01:02:21,653 --> 01:02:22,835
Evade!
Evade!

908
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,400


909
01:02:25,735 --> 01:02:27,095
Squad, pull out!

910
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,164
Bank right.
Maintain defensive posture.

911
01:02:31,006 --> 01:02:32,316
.

912
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:35,782
Protect the bombers.
Dive! Dive!

913
01:02:39,177 --> 01:02:41,636
Command, the queen ship
is too heavily defended.

914
01:02:41,661 --> 01:02:43,759
We have to regroup
and find a new approach.

915
01:02:43,784 --> 01:02:45,677
We have incoming!

916
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,525
- Damn, they're fast!
- Jesus, look at their fire power.

917
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:01,579
Break left.
Bank right!

918
01:03:02,582 --> 01:03:04,162
Oh yeah, I got you now.

919
01:03:04,187 --> 01:03:06,345
I got you.
I got you.

920
01:03:17,763 --> 01:03:19,182
Wow!

921
01:03:20,626 --> 01:03:24,013
I can't shake him.
Son of a bitch!

922
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:26,618
Uh, come on.
Help me out here.

923
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:28,307
I got you.

924
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:37,209
Dylan, that's me, 12 o'clock.

925
01:03:38,776 --> 01:03:40,631
Come on.
Come on.

926
01:03:40,656 --> 01:03:42,154
Bank left!

927
01:03:44,515 --> 01:03:45,985
God!

928
01:03:46,792 --> 01:03:49,984
- You can thank me later.
- I'll thank you right now.

929
01:03:54,312 --> 01:03:57,482
We just lost bomber 9
and bomber 13, sir.

930
01:03:57,507 --> 01:03:59,096
Command, we can't get
to the top of the ship.

931
01:03:59,121 --> 01:04:02,378
It's to heavily armed.
We're dropping like flies out here.

932
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:03,713
Come on!

933
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,218
I think we need
to fly inside.

934
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:08,494
- No, that's suicide. Sir.
- Damn it.

935
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:10,775
Morrison's right.
This is our only shot!

936
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,785
Do it.

937
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:13,518
We'll detonate the bombs
from the command center

938
01:04:13,543 --> 01:04:15,317
and we'll give you enough time
to get the hell out of there.

939
01:04:15,342 --> 01:04:18,667
Copy that.
Jake, follow my lead.

940
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:20,301
I'm on your wing.

941
01:04:22,045 --> 01:04:24,580
All bombers, we're going in.

942
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:37,199
They didn't follow us.

943
01:04:38,068 --> 01:04:40,190
Let's form up on the leads.

944
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:49,378
Charlie, look at those fields down there.
They have their own ecosystem.

945
01:04:56,339 --> 01:04:58,097
Dad. Dad.
Hey, it's me.

946
01:04:58,122 --> 01:05:00,133
You have to warn them.

947
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:02,815
She knows that they are coming.

948
01:05:10,758 --> 01:05:13,311
We got eyes on the target, tally-ho.

949
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:16,022
That's what we came here for.

950
01:05:16,047 --> 01:05:19,180
All bombers, open bomb bay doors.

951
01:05:20,508 --> 01:05:23,325
Get them out of there.
It's a trap.

952
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,960
Come on, no!

953
01:05:33,854 --> 01:05:35,769
Command, I have engine failure!

954
01:05:35,794 --> 01:05:37,823
We have engine failure!

955
01:05:37,848 --> 01:05:39,778
Attempt to restart!

956
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:42,469
We're going down!
We're going down!

957
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,675
I can't restart.

958
01:05:46,928 --> 01:05:48,653
Come on!

959
01:05:56,212 --> 01:05:58,285
We lost all power.

960
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:12,496
Command, you have to trigger the bomb!
It's the only way!

961
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:16,147
- Don't let us die for nothing!
- Do it!

962
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,986
Madam President, requesting authorization.

963
01:06:20,446 --> 01:06:22,328
Permission granted.

964
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:24,921
Detonation sequence initiated.

965
01:06:24,946 --> 01:06:27,015
Tel... Patricia...
I... lov... her...

966
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,186
I love you too.

967
01:06:29,309 --> 01:06:34,570
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

968
01:06:44,178 --> 01:06:45,575
Command, it's a negative impact!

969
01:06:45,608 --> 01:06:48,134
The blasts are contained
by an energy shield!

970
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:51,481
Repeat...
The blasts... contained... by an energy sh...

971
01:06:58,134 --> 01:07:00,177
We lost the signal, sir.

972
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:14,778
Wait.
Something's happening.

973
01:07:27,452 --> 01:07:29,484
<font color="#ff8080">SYSTEM OFFLINE</font>

974
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,221
She baited us.

975
01:07:35,243 --> 01:07:37,314
Tanner, we have to
have a status report.

976
01:07:37,339 --> 01:07:38,775
We're trying.
Our satellites are down.

977
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,757
We're completely blind.

978
01:08:10,203 --> 01:08:11,882
Madam President!

979
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,741
There will be no peace.

980
01:08:21,168 --> 01:08:24,118
Careful!
You'll agitate the crystals.

981
01:08:24,143 --> 01:08:26,057
I build it back in '94.

982
01:08:26,082 --> 01:08:29,490
Had to shelf it though after
the meltdown in Sector 3.

983
01:08:29,515 --> 01:08:33,293
- Here. Put it over here.
- Brakish, you're overexerting yourself.

984
01:08:33,564 --> 01:08:35,182
What is that thing doing here?

985
01:08:35,207 --> 01:08:37,606
Alright. Be a good boy,
go stand over there.

986
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:41,039
Wait a second.
What meltdown?

987
01:08:41,064 --> 01:08:43,029
Are we sure this thing
is safe to use?

988
01:08:43,054 --> 01:08:45,082
Highly unlikely.

989
01:08:45,409 --> 01:08:46,802
Clear!

990
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,600
What's the status of the fleet?

991
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:54,989
Only 7% made it back to base, sir.

992
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:56,485
- 7%!
- Yes, sir.

993
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:58,846
General.
Cheyenne Mountain is gone.

994
01:08:58,871 --> 01:09:02,743
All members of the presidential
line up succession are presumed dead.

995
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:04,804
They're here to swear you in, sir.

996
01:09:09,171 --> 01:09:11,187
Attention to orders!

997
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,626
Please repeat after me.

998
01:09:16,651 --> 01:09:19,879
- I, Joshua T. Adams.
- I, Joshua T. Adams.

999
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:22,995
- Do solemnly swear.
- Do solemnly swear.

1000
01:09:35,497 --> 01:09:37,350
I'm so sorry.

1001
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:40,607
You are right.

1002
01:09:43,566 --> 01:09:46,085
We're not going to
beat them this time.

1003
01:09:47,356 --> 01:09:50,950
God, look at the line.
It's like a thousand cars.

1004
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,977
We're never going to get gas.

1005
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,030
Have a little faith.

1006
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:57,673
You want to talk about faith?

1007
01:09:59,451 --> 01:10:02,971
My parents are probably
dead right now.

1008
01:10:02,996 --> 01:10:04,235
And most of my friends...

1009
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:07,410
She's upset because her boyfriend,
Kyle, is for sure a goner.

1010
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:09,093
What's a goner?

1011
01:10:09,118 --> 01:10:11,511
- Someone who is dead.
- Felix.

1012
01:10:11,536 --> 01:10:12,631
Why don't you pull over here.

1013
01:10:12,664 --> 01:10:14,647
Let me drive and
you take a little break.

1014
01:10:14,672 --> 01:10:16,056
Okay.

1015
01:10:21,654 --> 01:10:25,113
David, you should be
in the command center.

1016
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:29,046
President Whitmore,
thank god you're okay.

1017
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:30,989
It's been a while.

1018
01:10:33,841 --> 01:10:36,684
I had 20 years
to get us ready.

1019
01:10:37,118 --> 01:10:39,495
And we never had a chance.

1020
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,856
We didn't last time, either.

1021
01:10:43,212 --> 01:10:46,118
We always knew they
were coming back.

1022
01:10:48,122 --> 01:10:50,581
But look how far we've come.

1023
01:10:51,107 --> 01:10:53,097
In the last 20 years,

1024
01:10:53,122 --> 01:10:58,516
this planet has been unified in a way
that's unprecedented in human history.

1025
01:10:58,927 --> 01:11:00,698
That's sacred.

1026
01:11:03,177 --> 01:11:05,328
That's worth fighting for.

1027
01:11:05,352 --> 01:11:09,785
We convinced an entire generation
that this is a battle we could win.

1028
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,864
And they believed us.

1029
01:11:12,681 --> 01:11:15,453
We can't let them down.

1030
01:11:16,535 --> 01:11:18,990
It wasn't luck last time.

1031
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,846
It was our resolve.

1032
01:11:24,274 --> 01:11:28,327
We all have to fight
till our last breath.

1033
01:11:30,422 --> 01:11:33,140
And that is going to
lead us to victory.

1034
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,154
You understand some of their language.

1035
01:11:39,326 --> 01:11:40,910
I like you to tell me if

1036
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:44,328
any of these writings
mean anything to you.

1037
01:11:45,411 --> 01:11:48,207
So okay,
how about this one.

1038
01:11:48,598 --> 01:11:53,682
This talks about an
intergalactic war.

1039
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:56,852
This concerns the whole universe.

1040
01:11:56,877 --> 01:11:58,743
What about this one?

1041
01:12:00,371 --> 01:12:02,921
Something about an enemy.

1042
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:07,289
That needs to be destroyed
before it gets to us.

1043
01:12:07,462 --> 01:12:10,744
Wait.
I had a case study in Brazil,

1044
01:12:10,769 --> 01:12:15,675
where my patient didn't
describe the circle as sphere.

1045
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:20,426
He refereed to it
as "enemy".

1046
01:12:20,785 --> 01:12:22,727
Of course.

1047
01:12:23,932 --> 01:12:27,844
Their enemy is our ally.

1048
01:12:29,064 --> 01:12:31,528
Uh.
Your laser's smoking.

1049
01:12:31,684 --> 01:12:34,008
Oh oh.
Get it out of here.

1050
01:12:34,033 --> 01:12:36,480
Tell them to try and
pull it open.

1051
01:12:55,332 --> 01:12:57,241
Hello, gorgeous.

1052
01:12:58,309 --> 01:13:01,424
Time to find out what
secrets you're hiding.

1053
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,921
Alright, let's go get everyone.
Bring them here.

1054
01:13:04,946 --> 01:13:06,324
Yes, sir.

1055
01:13:19,139 --> 01:13:20,873
Watch your back!

1056
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:24,379
Go, go.
Don't block in front of the guy.

1057
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:33,852
Jake, get out of the way!

1058
01:14:02,863 --> 01:14:05,286
Guys.
You really need to see this.

1059
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:08,607
I've run every possible scan.
It's not giving off any kind of signal.

1060
01:14:08,632 --> 01:14:12,469
I mean nothing.
It's like it doesn't even exist.

1061
01:14:12,904 --> 01:14:15,294
It's almost like
it's trying to hide itself.

1062
01:14:16,644 --> 01:14:18,974
- It's really smooth.
- Hey. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1063
01:14:18,999 --> 01:14:21,046
You're not wearing gloves,
you'll contaminate it!

1064
01:14:21,071 --> 01:14:22,925
Remove your hands, Floyd.

1065
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,773
That's weird.

1066
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:27,825
- I can't.
- What do you mean you can't, Rosenberg?

1067
01:14:28,994 --> 01:14:30,565
Okay.
I'm trapped.

1068
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:32,334
Somebody do something,
it's swallowing me.

1069
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:33,826
Just stay calm and don't panic.

1070
01:14:33,851 --> 01:14:36,850
This thing is trying to eat me,
your advice is not to panic?

1071
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,743
<font color="#ff8080">ENEMY DETECTED</font>

1072
01:14:52,774 --> 01:14:57,418
<font color="#ff8080">ENEMY DETECTED</font>

1073
01:15:35,842 --> 01:15:38,005
It looks like they're mobilizing.

1074
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:02,056
David, please tell me this isn't
some kind of a Trojan horse.

1075
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:05,949
I don't think it's a danger to us,
but it must be to them.

1076
01:16:05,974 --> 01:16:08,533
He turned it on
just by touching it.

1077
01:16:08,558 --> 01:16:12,572
I activated myself when I
detected your biological signature

1078
01:16:12,597 --> 01:16:14,168
to be different from theirs.

1079
01:16:14,193 --> 01:16:17,511
It speaks, ha,
in English.

1080
01:16:17,536 --> 01:16:20,356
I deconstructed your primitive language.

1081
01:16:20,381 --> 01:16:22,824
- We're-We're primitive?
- Correct.

1082
01:16:22,849 --> 01:16:28,656
My species shared our biological existence
for a virtual one thousands of years ago.

1083
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:29,751
Far out.

1084
01:16:29,776 --> 01:16:31,343
Why are you here?

1085
01:16:31,368 --> 01:16:33,795
When I intercepted
their distress call,

1086
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:36,699
I knew they would come
to exterminate you.

1087
01:16:36,724 --> 01:16:40,637
I came to evacuate as
many of you as possible.

1088
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:45,208
But you attacked me with the
same weapons that they used on us.

1089
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,828
- They attacked you?
- Correct.

1090
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:53,239
A harvester ship conquered our planet
and extracted it's molten core.

1091
01:16:53,264 --> 01:16:58,010
They used them to refuel their
ships and grow their technology.

1092
01:16:58,035 --> 01:17:01,840
They've done this
to countless civilizations.

1093
01:17:01,865 --> 01:17:04,194
We fought them for
thousands of years.

1094
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:07,408
But they destroyed
all of our ships.

1095
01:17:07,433 --> 01:17:09,906
I, am the sole survivor.

1096
01:17:09,931 --> 01:17:13,244
I am so sorry to hear that.
Do you have a plan?

1097
01:17:13,269 --> 01:17:16,742
My system holds the key
to superior technology.

1098
01:17:16,767 --> 01:17:19,980
And there is a hidden planet
where I teach refugees

1099
01:17:20,005 --> 01:17:24,516
from other fallen worlds how to
build weapons that will defeat them

1100
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:28,029
- once and for all.
- That's why they're afraid of you.

1101
01:17:28,054 --> 01:17:31,428
You're the only ones who
threaten their existence.

1102
01:17:31,453 --> 01:17:32,710
Correct.

1103
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:36,922
But now that I'm activated,
the queen will detect my signature

1104
01:17:36,947 --> 01:17:38,818
and hunt me down.

1105
01:17:38,843 --> 01:17:40,499
It's too late.

1106
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,424
She's already on her way.

1107
01:17:43,448 --> 01:17:46,283
Yeah.
She's coming.

1108
01:17:46,308 --> 01:17:50,925
And what would happen if...
if we're able to kill her.

1109
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:54,670
No one has ever killed
a harvester queen.

1110
01:17:54,717 --> 01:17:56,181
That's encouraging.

1111
01:17:56,206 --> 01:17:58,609
But as a hive,
her fighters will fall

1112
01:17:58,634 --> 01:18:03,832
and her ship will leave your planet,
recalled by other harvester queens.

1113
01:18:03,857 --> 01:18:05,376
But it's too late now.

1114
01:18:05,402 --> 01:18:08,503
You must terminate me or
she will get the coordinates

1115
01:18:08,528 --> 01:18:12,064
to the refugee planet.
And that will be the end.

1116
01:18:12,089 --> 01:18:13,312
Wait-Wait a second.
Wait a second.

1117
01:18:13,337 --> 01:18:15,064
If we are so sure that she's
coming here to get you.

1118
01:18:15,089 --> 01:18:16,394
Maybe.

1119
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:21,713
We can bait her...
like she baited us.

1120
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:27,059
Mr. President, Dr. Okun
thinks that we can

1121
01:18:27,084 --> 01:18:30,423
- replicate the sphere's RF radiation signal.
- David, English please.

1122
01:18:30,448 --> 01:18:32,585
Every computer has a radioactive signature,

1123
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:35,466
whether it's your laptop,
you phone, even your watch.

1124
01:18:35,497 --> 01:18:38,866
But the sphere has a RFR
that's completely off the charts.

1125
01:18:38,891 --> 01:18:43,501
So, if we hide the real sphere
inside the isolation chamber,

1126
01:18:43,526 --> 01:18:46,531
and pack this decoy transmitter
so to speak, onto a Tug

1127
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:50,368
filled with cold-fusion bombs
and lure her out to the salt flats.

1128
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:54,597
We can fly right up her
royal ass and bon voyage!

1129
01:18:54,622 --> 01:18:56,401
You set off cold-fusion bombs,

1130
01:18:56,426 --> 01:18:58,609
you're gonna kill everyone
from here to Houston.

1131
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:03,424
Not if we use the shield generators
from this base to contain the blast.

1132
01:19:04,347 --> 01:19:07,880
Without our shields, you better put
a blaster in every able-bodied hand.

1133
01:19:07,905 --> 01:19:10,589
- And get them ready
  to shoot some aliens.
- Yes, sir.

1134
01:19:10,614 --> 01:19:13,999
Now, we just need a way to...
see her coming.

1135
01:19:14,024 --> 01:19:15,391
Follow me.

1136
01:19:16,296 --> 01:19:17,573
- Do your thing.
- My thing.

1137
01:19:17,598 --> 01:19:19,383
My thing.
My thing.

1138
01:19:23,228 --> 01:19:25,166
- Take it off!
- Copy, sir.

1139
01:19:25,191 --> 01:19:26,053
Watch it.

1140
01:19:26,078 --> 01:19:29,953
This old radar truck was suppose
to go to the Smithsonian.

1141
01:19:30,369 --> 01:19:33,461
- They never picked it up.
- It's a good thing they didn't.

1142
01:19:34,284 --> 01:19:36,457
Yeah, drive it to the highest point.
The higher the better.

1143
01:19:36,482 --> 01:19:37,754
Yes, sir.

1144
01:19:40,836 --> 01:19:42,385
Look what I found
in the hold.

1145
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,966
We should be able to
communicate with this.

1146
01:19:44,991 --> 01:19:46,885
Let's hook up the antenna.

1147
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,174
What was that?

1148
01:19:52,733 --> 01:19:53,593
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1149
01:19:53,618 --> 01:19:55,622
The drill is cracking the outer mantle.
But...

1150
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,458
that shouldn't happen for another...

1151
01:19:57,933 --> 01:19:59,142
We were wrong.

1152
01:19:59,167 --> 01:20:01,710
We do not have 7 hours
until the Earth core breach.

1153
01:20:01,735 --> 01:20:04,597
We only have... one.

1154
01:20:06,476 --> 01:20:08,053
Call it in.

1155
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:12,102
Area 51. Area 51.
Do you copy?

1156
01:20:22,073 --> 01:20:26,384
So the idea is to
get her to follow this tug

1157
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:31,829
into the salt flats using the
decoy transmitter on board.

1158
01:20:31,854 --> 01:20:33,897
And once she's taken the bait,

1159
01:20:33,922 --> 01:20:38,885
our cold-fusion bombs
can go to town to hail Mary.

1160
01:20:39,258 --> 01:20:40,587
It can work.

1161
01:20:40,612 --> 01:20:41,621
There's a catch.

1162
01:20:41,646 --> 01:20:44,899
As you know, they took out
all of our satellites, which means...

1163
01:20:44,938 --> 01:20:48,119
that somebody is going to
have to fly in manually.

1164
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:50,510
And I know that I'm asking
for the ultimate sacrifice.

1165
01:20:50,535 --> 01:20:51,783
I know that.

1166
01:20:51,808 --> 01:20:55,432
But you, you're the only
pilots we have left.

1167
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,912
And I need a volunteer.

1168
01:20:59,033 --> 01:21:02,175
Let's get it done.
I'll fly it in.

1169
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:04,225
No, you won't.

1170
01:21:05,029 --> 01:21:06,411
I'll do it.

1171
01:21:06,436 --> 01:21:08,124
Mr. President.

1172
01:21:16,692 --> 01:21:18,732
Dad, what are you doing?

1173
01:21:18,757 --> 01:21:23,138
Patty, there're a lot of reasons
I'm the best choice for this.

1174
01:21:24,205 --> 01:21:27,431
You all have to pick up
the pieces once it's over.

1175
01:21:28,826 --> 01:21:30,727
This is my part.

1176
01:21:37,706 --> 01:21:39,219
Matthew.

1177
01:21:39,685 --> 01:21:42,295
Do not let him
get on that Tug.

1178
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:45,283
Do you understand me?

1179
01:21:51,168 --> 01:21:52,710
Get the hell off the road!

1180
01:21:52,735 --> 01:21:55,539
If you go any slower,
we'll be going backwards.

1181
01:21:55,564 --> 01:21:58,364
Don't be a schmuck,
we have to conserve gas.

1182
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:01,857
Area 51 is still
75 miles away.

1183
01:22:01,882 --> 01:22:05,486
- We're running on fumes.
- What do we have here?

1184
01:22:14,027 --> 01:22:16,527
- Who's in charge here?
- No one.

1185
01:22:16,552 --> 01:22:19,343
Our driver left us
to take a ride to Minnesota.

1186
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:20,953
Just like that.
He just left?

1187
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:23,446
He wanted to go have
sex with his girlfriend.

1188
01:22:28,471 --> 01:22:30,604
YES!
All aboard!

1189
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:32,977
Wait. Wait wait wait.
What about our-our car?

1190
01:22:33,002 --> 01:22:34,670
We'll get you a new one
when you get your license.

1191
01:22:34,695 --> 01:22:36,724
On the bus, everybody!

1192
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,346
Tell the General
we're up and running.

1193
01:22:45,371 --> 01:22:48,700
Bring it in!
Spin it around.

1194
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:50,869
Alright.
Plug it in.

1195
01:22:50,894 --> 01:22:53,100
Radar is operational, sir.

1196
01:22:55,812 --> 01:22:57,492
Son of a bitch.

1197
01:22:57,517 --> 01:22:58,898
Alright, they're coming in fast.

1198
01:22:58,923 --> 01:23:01,620
David, we got a real
firestorm coming our way

1199
01:23:01,645 --> 01:23:03,146
and not a lot of
time to prepare.

1200
01:23:03,171 --> 01:23:04,749
Give me numbers, Mr. President.

1201
01:23:04,774 --> 01:23:06,543
9 minutes to the
queen ship's arrival.

1202
01:23:06,568 --> 01:23:09,983
Roughly 22 minutes before the
drill reaches our molten core.

1203
01:23:10,008 --> 01:23:10,747
Jesus Christ.

1204
01:23:10,772 --> 01:23:13,752
Take your positions.
We don't have a second to lose!

1205
01:23:15,837 --> 01:23:17,767
Are we going to make it, sir?

1206
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:20,004
You bet your ass we will.

1207
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:31,891
This thing is way cooler
than the machete.

1208
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,493
Sorry!

1209
01:23:35,518 --> 01:23:37,747
Sorry, everyone.
That was my bad.

1210
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:45,948
I'm going to see
if it's clear.

1211
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:48,388
Jake!
Ha.

1212
01:23:49,366 --> 01:23:51,220
- Hell of a time to scare a guy.
- Sorry.

1213
01:23:51,245 --> 01:23:52,596
God, it's great.
It's good to see you.

1214
01:23:52,621 --> 01:23:53,639
It's good to see you too.

1215
01:23:53,664 --> 01:23:56,069
- I didn't think you'd made it.
- Why not?

1216
01:23:57,006 --> 01:23:58,509
Uh, you know.

1217
01:23:58,799 --> 01:24:01,068
You haven't flown a fighter in a while,
so I figure...

1218
01:24:01,093 --> 01:24:02,793
You're alive, that's what counts.

1219
01:24:02,818 --> 01:24:05,264
Enough with the reunion.
They're going to hear us.

1220
01:24:05,289 --> 01:24:08,426
- More of us made it.
- You're still talking loud.

1221
01:24:08,876 --> 01:24:11,955
So what now?
Go in guns blazing?

1222
01:24:12,573 --> 01:24:13,925
Hey, what are you doing?

1223
01:24:13,972 --> 01:24:16,419
You guys, get to those fighters
and don't leave me hanging.

1224
01:24:16,444 --> 01:24:17,662
Wait!

1225
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:26,010
Excuse me!
Down here

1226
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:27,866
There you go.

1227
01:24:27,891 --> 01:24:29,980
Listen, I usually don't hold a grudge.

1228
01:24:30,005 --> 01:24:33,442
But... you killed my parents.

1229
01:24:33,467 --> 01:24:37,204
So... Well, I'm going to make
an exception for you guys.

1230
01:24:38,436 --> 01:24:41,378
Charlie, Rain.
You two take the first fighter.

1231
01:24:44,745 --> 01:24:46,987
Been holding that
one for a while.

1232
01:24:48,214 --> 01:24:52,009
- Their technology hasn't change at all.
- Get the weapons ready.

1233
01:24:54,477 --> 01:24:57,469
Woo.
New interface.

1234
01:24:59,909 --> 01:25:01,109
Shit!

1235
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:04,529
Jake's in trouble!
Let's go!

1236
01:25:12,355 --> 01:25:14,840
Getting a little low there, Rain.

1237
01:25:21,696 --> 01:25:23,221
Nice.

1238
01:25:25,907 --> 01:25:27,703
Oh no, you don't.

1239
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:33,021
- Should have kept running.
- Get your ass out of there!

1240
01:25:34,025 --> 01:25:35,404
Take this.

1241
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:39,019
- Hey, thanks for that.
- Yeah.

1242
01:25:39,044 --> 01:25:41,076
- Get up there where you belong.
- What, you don't want to fly?

1243
01:25:41,101 --> 01:25:42,881
Hell no.
I want to shoot.

1244
01:25:42,906 --> 01:25:45,714
All pilots, go to channel 6
on your radios.

1245
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:46,996
Anytime, gentlemen.

1246
01:25:47,021 --> 01:25:49,841
You guys, go ahead.
We'll cover the rear.

1247
01:25:56,016 --> 01:25:58,818
They're closing doors.
They're closing doors.

1248
01:25:58,843 --> 01:26:01,486
Jake, where are you?

1249
01:26:02,468 --> 01:26:04,824
We're on our way.
Rain, how long have we got?

1250
01:26:04,849 --> 01:26:05,974
20 seconds, max.

1251
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:08,167
No, Rain.
Stop, bank left.

1252
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,588
- We have to go.
- No.

1253
01:26:11,613 --> 01:26:15,200
We're not leaving anyone else behind.
No one else dies today.

1254
01:26:15,225 --> 01:26:18,192
- You with me?
- I'm with you.

1255
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,718
- It's getting dicey up here.
- Rain, just get out of here!

1256
01:26:26,743 --> 01:26:29,898
Respectfully, sir.
No way in hell.

1257
01:26:31,999 --> 01:26:33,276
Ah!
Come on!

1258
01:26:33,301 --> 01:26:35,348
Hey, man.
I just want you to know.

1259
01:26:35,666 --> 01:26:37,685
If we don't make
it out of here,

1260
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:40,078
I'm really sorry for almost
killing you in training.

1261
01:26:40,103 --> 01:26:41,681
Well, if we don't make it out of here,
I just want you to know.

1262
01:26:41,706 --> 01:26:44,537
I'm not sorry at all about
punching you in the face.

1263
01:26:49,436 --> 01:26:51,186
Yeah.
Way to go, Charlie!

1264
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:53,116
- Woo!
- Ha ha!

1265
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,832
Alright, we're clear.
You lead, we follow.

1266
01:26:58,852 --> 01:27:01,704
Faster, Rain.
Faster!

1267
01:27:04,814 --> 01:27:06,964
Hang on to your seat, buddy!

1268
01:27:14,299 --> 01:27:16,295
Jake, did you make it?

1269
01:27:17,091 --> 01:27:18,459
Rain.

1270
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:21,806
Did you see him
come out of there?

1271
01:27:21,831 --> 01:27:23,617
I'm not sure.

1272
01:27:25,594 --> 01:27:26,964
Jake.

1273
01:27:27,711 --> 01:27:29,916
- Did you miss me?
- Oh!

1274
01:27:31,569 --> 01:27:34,523
You can't do that to me.
You can't.

1275
01:27:35,575 --> 01:27:38,230
I told you you'd get
lonely without me.

1276
01:27:38,564 --> 01:27:41,032
All right, aviators.
Let's turn and burn.

1277
01:27:41,057 --> 01:27:43,450
Clock's ticking,
we got to get out of here.

1278
01:27:47,236 --> 01:27:51,535
Standby for a broadcast from
the United States government.

1279
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,246
I understand that many people
around the world are tuning into

1280
01:27:54,271 --> 01:27:56,982
this channel on their
shortwave radios.

1281
01:27:57,226 --> 01:27:59,511
To you out there
and here at home.

1282
01:27:59,991 --> 01:28:03,623
Make no mistake,
this is humanity's last stand.

1283
01:28:04,261 --> 01:28:05,971
What we do in the
next 12 minutes

1284
01:28:05,996 --> 01:28:09,079
will either define the
human race or finish it.

1285
01:28:09,205 --> 01:28:11,160
To those of you listening:

1286
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:15,403
No matter your nationality,
color, or creed,

1287
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:18,178
I ask that all of
you pray for us.

1288
01:28:19,135 --> 01:28:22,534
No matter our differences,
we are all one people.

1289
01:28:22,722 --> 01:28:26,495
Whatever happens,
succeed or fail,

1290
01:28:27,301 --> 01:28:32,786
we will face it together,
standing as one.

1291
01:28:35,559 --> 01:28:38,890
Decoy mission launch,
T minus 60 seconds.

1292
01:28:38,915 --> 01:28:41,693
Patricia!
Patricia.

1293
01:28:41,718 --> 01:28:43,858
- What is it?
- It's your dad, he collapsed.

1294
01:28:43,883 --> 01:28:45,440
Come with me quick.

1295
01:28:47,997 --> 01:28:51,200
Mission is fueled, loaded
and ready for launch.

1296
01:28:51,573 --> 01:28:56,072
- Where is he?
- He asked me, as a friend, as a father.

1297
01:29:00,286 --> 01:29:01,612
Dad!

1298
01:29:12,715 --> 01:29:16,310
Decoy convoy.
Hold in ready position.

1299
01:29:18,384 --> 01:29:21,517
It says here, you got
to fly on Air Force One.

1300
01:29:21,542 --> 01:29:22,699
You meet the President?

1301
01:29:22,724 --> 01:29:24,457
My dad says your son
never went to space

1302
01:29:24,482 --> 01:29:26,035
and it's just a conspiracy.

1303
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:29,528
Oh yeah?
You father's a butt.

1304
01:29:34,476 --> 01:29:37,690
Wait.
Do you-Do you hear that?

1305
01:29:37,813 --> 01:29:40,874
- Oh. That kid making fun of me?
- No. That sound.

1306
01:29:49,238 --> 01:29:51,955
Kids, hold on to your seats!

1307
01:29:54,183 --> 01:29:57,898
They're inbound.
10 seconds till contact.

1308
01:29:58,142 --> 01:29:59,890
They're going to target
the cannon first.

1309
01:29:59,915 --> 01:30:03,238
We won't get too many shots off
so you just make them count.

1310
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,152
On my command!

1311
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,415
Fire!

1312
01:30:34,602 --> 01:30:35,980
I have to take this fighter.

1313
01:30:36,005 --> 01:30:38,478
We're still priming the fusion drive.
It's only 32%.

1314
01:30:38,503 --> 01:30:41,108
That's more than enough.
Give me the harness.

1315
01:30:42,902 --> 01:30:44,533
General, we're up and running.

1316
01:30:44,558 --> 01:30:46,079
Alright, Tom.
You're ready to go.

1317
01:30:46,104 --> 01:30:48,691
Activate the decoy transmitter
on my mark.

1318
01:30:48,716 --> 01:30:51,913
3. 2. 1.

1319
01:30:53,261 --> 01:30:56,005
<font color="#ff80c0">Isolation chamber activated.</font>

1320
01:30:56,030 --> 01:31:00,088
Convoy is a go.
Give them cover fire, now.

1321
01:31:03,739 --> 01:31:05,668
Now, Tom.
Now.

1322
01:31:15,111 --> 01:31:17,491
It's working.
She's following the decoy.

1323
01:31:17,516 --> 01:31:19,143
Wait!
What are you doing?

1324
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,733
It doesn't matter, we're isolated.
I'm going to turn it back on.

1325
01:31:21,758 --> 01:31:25,396
- Why would you do that?
- To see what else this thing knows.

1326
01:31:25,421 --> 01:31:26,247
Excuse me.

1327
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:29,331
Just have a few questions,
if you don't mind.

1328
01:31:29,356 --> 01:31:32,283
Sir, there's a school bus
heading directly towards for the trap.

1329
01:31:32,324 --> 01:31:33,059
No no no...

1330
01:31:33,084 --> 01:31:36,186
David, the queen ship
will be there in 2 minutes.

1331
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,051
Who is that?
No. No. No.

1332
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:44,740
There's a tall gangly man
waving us down over there.

1333
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:46,415
- Hey, look.
- Tall, gangly?

1334
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,138
That's my David.

1335
01:31:48,654 --> 01:31:50,488
Just who is this blind idiot?

1336
01:31:50,513 --> 01:31:53,346
Yeah! Yes! Yes!
Thank you.

1337
01:31:56,503 --> 01:31:57,880
Dad?

1338
01:32:01,533 --> 01:32:05,750
This is going to catapult our
civilization by thousands of years.

1339
01:32:05,775 --> 01:32:09,405
Our understanding of physics, wormholes,
everything everything everything.

1340
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:12,619
- Babe, calm down, calm down.
- I don't want to calm down!

1341
01:32:12,644 --> 01:32:14,291
Ah, David.

1342
01:32:14,418 --> 01:32:15,240
What?

1343
01:32:15,265 --> 01:32:17,892
We have to wait for the end of the
world for us to get together.

1344
01:32:17,917 --> 01:32:19,029
Come, David.
Give me a kiss already.

1345
01:32:19,054 --> 01:32:20,760
You're alive.
I'm-I'm-I'm busy right now.

1346
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,321
You'll be happy to know
I made some acquaintances.

1347
01:32:22,346 --> 01:32:23,628
They came to see you.

1348
01:32:23,653 --> 01:32:25,554
I'm a little busy right now, Dad.

1349
01:32:25,579 --> 01:32:27,265
- You and I. We're going to have to talk.
- I said not now.

1350
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,719
- Look. Look. Light.
- Yeah, I see.

1351
01:32:37,672 --> 01:32:40,180
Tom, it looks like
the plan is working.

1352
01:32:40,205 --> 01:32:41,798
She thinks you've
got the sphere.

1353
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:44,981
- She's going after you.
- You got to get these kids to cover. Go. Go.

1354
01:32:52,749 --> 01:32:55,322
It's good to see
you flying again.

1355
01:32:56,044 --> 01:32:58,302
You place is in the air.

1356
01:32:59,775 --> 01:33:01,652
You should have
let me do this.

1357
01:33:01,677 --> 01:33:04,240
You saved the world
once before, Dad.

1358
01:33:04,670 --> 01:33:07,048
I'm not saving the world, Patty.

1359
01:33:08,078 --> 01:33:09,888
I'm saving you.

1360
01:33:14,017 --> 01:33:15,330
Tom, what's going on?

1361
01:33:15,355 --> 01:33:16,975
She's in my head.

1362
01:33:18,334 --> 01:33:21,634
Mr. President, you got
incoming fighters on your six.

1363
01:33:21,659 --> 01:33:23,892
Can you get me to the target,
Lieutenant Whitmore?

1364
01:33:23,917 --> 01:33:26,021
Yes, sir.
Follow me.

1365
01:33:29,112 --> 01:33:30,538
Come on.

1366
01:33:35,642 --> 01:33:37,091
Go now.

1367
01:33:42,689 --> 01:33:44,682
Now. Now.
Activate the shield.

1368
01:33:44,707 --> 01:33:47,056
<font color="#ff80c0">Shield engaged.</font>

1369
01:33:47,695 --> 01:33:50,509
Lieutenant Whitmore, clear the blast zone.

1370
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:02,281
Surprise to see me?

1371
01:34:02,306 --> 01:34:03,794
Do it.
Push the button, Tom.

1372
01:34:03,819 --> 01:34:05,252
Do it, Tom.

1373
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:07,429
<font color="#ff8080">SHIELD IMPACT
DETECTED</font>

1374
01:34:07,454 --> 01:34:09,377
That's right.
We got you.

1375
01:34:09,409 --> 01:34:13,400
On behalf of the planet Earth,
happy 4th of July!

1376
01:34:17,202 --> 01:34:18,562
Ooh.

1377
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:31,114
Do we have confirmation, David?

1378
01:34:40,033 --> 01:34:41,835
I think it's safe to say,
Mr. President.

1379
01:34:41,862 --> 01:34:43,716
That, we got her.

1380
01:34:43,741 --> 01:34:45,842
- Yay!
- Yay!

1381
01:34:50,954 --> 01:34:52,147
Whoa!

1382
01:35:03,324 --> 01:35:07,160
Wait, if she's dead,
why are her fighters still attacking us?

1383
01:35:15,888 --> 01:35:18,072
- Command, we have a breach.
- How many do you think?

1384
01:35:18,097 --> 01:35:19,253
About 2 dozen, sir.

1385
01:35:19,278 --> 01:35:21,724
Under no circumstances
do they see the sphere.

1386
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:24,297
You do whatever it takes!
Do you copy?

1387
01:35:24,322 --> 01:35:25,614
Copy that.

1388
01:35:29,302 --> 01:35:32,283
- This is Sam, my navigator.
- Um.

1389
01:35:32,308 --> 01:35:34,338
You're a lot taller
than I imagined.

1390
01:35:34,363 --> 01:35:36,069
This is her sister, Daisy.
Bobby.

1391
01:35:36,094 --> 01:35:39,439
Um, sir.
Is that suppose to happen?

1392
01:35:42,032 --> 01:35:43,981
- Oh my god.
- Not good.

1393
01:35:44,675 --> 01:35:47,452
Oh my god.
She has her own shield.

1394
01:35:47,477 --> 01:35:49,592
- What is that?
- Okay, back on the bus, kids!

1395
01:35:49,617 --> 01:35:51,693
Back on the bus.
Here we go.

1396
01:35:57,038 --> 01:35:58,804
Ginger!

1397
01:35:59,816 --> 01:36:01,380
Come on, Ginger!

1398
01:36:01,405 --> 01:36:02,757
No, no, no.
We're getting out.

1399
01:36:02,782 --> 01:36:04,193
Come on, girl.
Come on, let's go.

1400
01:36:04,218 --> 01:36:06,649
We all have to wait for the dog.
I guess so.

1401
01:36:13,918 --> 01:36:15,529
Oh my god!

1402
01:36:20,532 --> 01:36:24,678
All remaining pilots, target the queen.
Unload everything you've got.

1403
01:36:37,631 --> 01:36:39,439
Did you hear that?

1404
01:36:41,275 --> 01:36:43,446
We need backup down here now!

1405
01:36:43,471 --> 01:36:46,003
We got a serious breach
in cell block 5.

1406
01:36:46,028 --> 01:36:48,089
We got aliens on the loose.
We need backup now!

1407
01:36:48,114 --> 01:36:50,147
HEY!
Where are you going?

1408
01:37:03,764 --> 01:37:05,814
Charlie.
The thing just leaped into the air!

1409
01:37:05,839 --> 01:37:08,522
- What did he just say?
- Something about jumping.

1410
01:37:10,327 --> 01:37:11,927
Whoa.
Whoa.

1411
01:37:36,134 --> 01:37:38,384
We are within 6 minutes, sir.

1412
01:37:42,511 --> 01:37:45,526
David, 6 minutes to Earth's core breach.

1413
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:11,503
- General Adams, her shield is down!
- Yes!

1414
01:38:11,528 --> 01:38:12,983
I repeat.
Her shield is down.

1415
01:38:13,008 --> 01:38:14,777
Great job, Lieutenant.

1416
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,261
I got you, baby.

1417
01:38:56,184 --> 01:38:58,239
We're going to
get you out of this.

1418
01:39:02,184 --> 01:39:04,994
Aim for her gun, Charlie.
Aim for her gun.

1419
01:39:05,554 --> 01:39:09,140
This is Captain Hiller.
We hijacked a couple of alien fighters.

1420
01:39:09,165 --> 01:39:10,266
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1421
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:12,774
Do not shoot at us.
We're the ones trailing smoke.

1422
01:39:12,799 --> 01:39:14,389
Roger that, Captain Hiller.

1423
01:39:14,414 --> 01:39:15,983
- Yes!
- Come on, get her.

1424
01:39:16,008 --> 01:39:17,480
Shoot her down!

1425
01:39:19,546 --> 01:39:23,392
Whitmore destroyed the queen ship
and his daughter knocked out her shield.

1426
01:39:23,417 --> 01:39:26,080
Now listen up.
They're going for our molten core.

1427
01:39:26,105 --> 01:39:28,376
You've got 4 minutes
to destroy the queen.

1428
01:39:28,401 --> 01:39:30,159
So give her hell.

1429
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:32,428
Copy that, no pressure.

1430
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:43,588
We're really running
into an alien prison!

1431
01:39:43,613 --> 01:39:45,149
This is the one!

1432
01:39:45,352 --> 01:39:47,630
- Open up!
- We're here!

1433
01:39:56,078 --> 01:39:57,709
Ah!
She knows!

1434
01:39:59,121 --> 01:40:00,795
She's coming!

1435
01:40:11,362 --> 01:40:12,556
Dylan, what's happening?

1436
01:40:12,581 --> 01:40:15,223
I don't know.
My controls just stopped responding.

1437
01:40:15,724 --> 01:40:17,668
- Same here.
- Charlie, do something.

1438
01:40:17,693 --> 01:40:18,554
I can't.

1439
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,648
She must have taken
control over our systems.

1440
01:40:20,673 --> 01:40:23,224
I think we are
part of the hive now.

1441
01:40:25,778 --> 01:40:28,076
Looks like we're not
the only ones.

1442
01:40:33,538 --> 01:40:36,961
What the hell.
She's taking us straight to Area 51.

1443
01:40:37,696 --> 01:40:39,139
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1444
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:44,477
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1445
01:40:44,502 --> 01:40:46,854
- You're not going to follow her!
- Stay behind the yellow line, please Dad.

1446
01:40:46,879 --> 01:40:49,176
- There's no yellow line.
- Imagine one.

1447
01:40:57,394 --> 01:40:59,199
That!
Take that!

1448
01:41:04,982 --> 01:41:06,592
You see.

1449
01:41:07,368 --> 01:41:09,217
I told you
I'll figure it out.

1450
01:41:15,935 --> 01:41:17,825
You talk too much.

1451
01:41:23,522 --> 01:41:26,614
Baby, we're saved

1452
01:41:27,573 --> 01:41:29,000
They got me.

1453
01:41:31,434 --> 01:41:32,825
No.

1454
01:41:33,072 --> 01:41:35,661
Don't worry.
I'm going to get you to sick bay.

1455
01:41:35,686 --> 01:41:37,633
I'm afraid I'm not
able to make.

1456
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:39,184
Wait a minute.
Wait. Wait.

1457
01:41:39,209 --> 01:41:41,007
You can't go.

1458
01:41:41,032 --> 01:41:44,829
Whose gonna...
Whose gonna water your orchids?

1459
01:41:44,854 --> 01:41:47,580
Whose gonna make sure you put
your pants on when I'm gone?

1460
01:41:47,612 --> 01:41:49,595
Baby, you're right.

1461
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:52,275
I got something
I got to tell you.

1462
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,679
What?

1463
01:41:53,901 --> 01:41:58,227
This... was supposed to be a sweater.

1464
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,166
Oh no no no.

1465
01:42:06,387 --> 01:42:08,799
No.
No.

1466
01:42:28,472 --> 01:42:30,386
What the hell is she doing?

1467
01:42:34,012 --> 01:42:36,187
That's close enough, David.
That's close enough.

1468
01:42:38,804 --> 01:42:41,441
It's like they are
trying to protect her.

1469
01:42:42,679 --> 01:42:44,971
More are coming.

1470
01:42:45,539 --> 01:42:48,078
- Give me that thing!
- Take mine.

1471
01:42:54,945 --> 01:42:57,820
2 minutes, sir.
2 minutes until core breach.

1472
01:42:57,855 --> 01:43:01,166
Captain Hiller, you got 2 minutes.
2 minutes.

1473
01:43:01,191 --> 01:43:05,114
- We got to get of this tornado.
- Every tornado has an eye, right?

1474
01:43:05,139 --> 01:43:07,350
I think if we want to get a shot
at her, we got to get up there.

1475
01:43:07,375 --> 01:43:08,486
How are we going to do that?

1476
01:43:08,511 --> 01:43:10,394
We don't have any
manual controls left.

1477
01:43:10,419 --> 01:43:12,447
Well, don't these things have
fusion drive or something?

1478
01:43:12,471 --> 01:43:15,949
Are you kidding me?
That thing is make for outer space!

1479
01:43:15,975 --> 01:43:19,097
- Down here we'll burn up!
- You got a better idea, Charlie?

1480
01:43:19,122 --> 01:43:21,610
From where I'm sitting, it looks
like it's our only damn chance!

1481
01:43:21,635 --> 01:43:24,703
- Our only chance to die.
- Charlie, shut up!

1482
01:43:24,852 --> 01:43:26,894
Rain, on the thrusters.

1483
01:43:28,153 --> 01:43:29,887
- You're all crazy!
- One.

1484
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:32,184
Two.
Three.

1485
01:43:57,576 --> 01:43:59,649
Ah, still alive.

1486
01:44:00,226 --> 01:44:02,482
- You alright?
- Woo, man.

1487
01:44:03,339 --> 01:44:06,415
- I got the controls back.
- And our weapons are working.

1488
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,643
Yeah, but our engines are fried.

1489
01:44:08,668 --> 01:44:11,406
Alright. Well, it's got to be
a controlled dive then.

1490
01:44:14,479 --> 01:44:16,101
There she is.

1491
01:44:16,364 --> 01:44:19,762
Everybody, we got 1 shot at this.
Let's make it count.

1492
01:44:21,752 --> 01:44:24,566
Thanks for always
looking out for me, Jake.

1493
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:26,143
You got it, buddy.

1494
01:44:31,942 --> 01:44:33,648
It's over.
It's over.

1495
01:44:33,673 --> 01:44:35,858
- You got them all.
- Okay.

1496
01:44:44,135 --> 01:44:46,419
Except that one.

1497
01:44:46,914 --> 01:44:48,855
Oh my god.
She's got it.

1498
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,225
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1499
01:44:59,673 --> 01:45:02,468
Get ready for a
close encounter, bitch!

1500
01:45:05,802 --> 01:45:07,418
Charlie, go for her back!

1501
01:45:07,443 --> 01:45:10,318
Right where the tentacles are.
That's her weak spot.

1502
01:45:27,033 --> 01:45:30,662
- Keep shooting, Charlie!
- What do you think I'm doing?

1503
01:45:35,606 --> 01:45:37,720
Charlie, this thing got ejection seats?

1504
01:45:37,745 --> 01:45:40,047
Negative!

1505
01:45:40,616 --> 01:45:42,058
Look out!

1506
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:52,186
Okay, that's getting too close.
David!

1507
01:45:52,211 --> 01:45:53,974
David, let's get out of here.

1508
01:45:53,999 --> 01:45:55,992
Back off.
Go back!

1509
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,708
We're alive.

1510
01:46:33,490 --> 01:46:36,344
We're rich.
Oh my god.

1511
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:42,264
General Adams, the Earth's core
is secure.

1512
01:46:42,289 --> 01:46:45,099
- Yay!
- Yay!

1513
01:46:57,839 --> 01:47:00,684
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1514
01:47:15,505 --> 01:47:19,210
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Baby, put the gun down.

1515
01:47:19,235 --> 01:47:20,624
Jake.

1516
01:47:23,078 --> 01:47:24,649
Jake.

1517
01:47:43,476 --> 01:47:46,155
We're not even married yet, and
you're already trying to shoot me?

1518
01:47:49,123 --> 01:47:51,998
Maybe we should try that.

1519
01:47:53,742 --> 01:47:55,043
You know.

1520
01:47:57,026 --> 01:47:58,640
Dinner first.

1521
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:08,898
Director Levinson,
well done.

1522
01:48:08,923 --> 01:48:10,797
Thank you, Mr. President.

1523
01:48:12,312 --> 01:48:14,302
Catherine.
Um.

1524
01:48:14,327 --> 01:48:17,654
Don't say anything.
You'll just ruin it.

1525
01:48:18,922 --> 01:48:20,497
Who are you?

1526
01:48:20,522 --> 01:48:23,234
David never mention a
beautiful woman in his life.

1527
01:48:23,259 --> 01:48:24,448
Dad.

1528
01:48:24,569 --> 01:48:26,702
I'm Julius.
I'm his father.

1529
01:48:26,727 --> 01:48:29,052
Enchanté.
I'm Catherine Marceaux.

1530
01:48:29,077 --> 01:48:31,693
- Can you give us a second?
- I was never here.

1531
01:48:32,025 --> 01:48:33,050
Uh, listen.

1532
01:48:33,075 --> 01:48:36,786
Maybe you guys should
stay with me for a while.

1533
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:39,241
I think I would
really like that.

1534
01:48:39,266 --> 01:48:41,027
Yes, so would I.

1535
01:48:43,953 --> 01:48:47,991
- Are you okay?
- I am. Thanks to you.

1536
01:48:48,925 --> 01:48:50,898
This wasn't all for nothing.

1537
01:48:50,923 --> 01:48:55,718
- You are a remarkable species.
- Not so primitive after all, uh.

1538
01:48:58,544 --> 01:49:00,244
Hey.
You think they'll let me keep this?

1539
01:49:00,269 --> 01:49:02,759
You have the heart of a warrior.

1540
01:49:04,267 --> 01:49:07,136
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me

1541
01:49:14,902 --> 01:49:16,848
Hell of a job.

1542
01:49:40,524 --> 01:49:42,343
We are rich!
We are rich!

1543
01:49:42,368 --> 01:49:44,196
Woo!

1544
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:02,925
I don't know if this planet
can survive another attack.

1545
01:50:03,249 --> 01:50:04,904
No, no.
Excuse me.

1546
01:50:04,929 --> 01:50:09,387
Director Levinson, you won't believe
the weapons and the technology

1547
01:50:09,412 --> 01:50:12,645
this thing has on it's-
on it's proverbial hard drive.

1548
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:15,272
It wants us to lead
their resistance.

1549
01:50:15,297 --> 01:50:17,854
- What do you mean?
- Two words.

1550
01:50:17,879 --> 01:50:20,658
Interstellar travel.

1551
01:50:20,683 --> 01:50:22,180
Take the fight to them.

1552
01:50:22,205 --> 01:50:23,963
When do we leave?

1553
01:50:24,109 --> 01:50:28,997
We are going to kick
some serious alien ass.

1554
01:50:30,994 --> 01:50:36,995
