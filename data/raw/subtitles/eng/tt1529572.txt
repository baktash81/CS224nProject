Oh, my God,

(Aunt) So, you two. High school.
That's pretty great.

10

the role models we were looking for.

don't you think?

- Why?
- 'Cause it totally, like, flattens out my boobs.

think that I was hotter

had a better bra.

like all the time too?

you never used to.

down for guys, like Serena.

You know that.

176

179
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,752
Yes, Lynn.
[horn honking]

180
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,426
It's a parking lot,
moron. Go around!

181
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,049
Did you get my point?

182
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,596
Yeah, Mom. I get it.
[horn honking]

183
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,924
Oh, for the love of--

184
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,555
- Bite me!
- Mom!

185
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,350
Yeah, I'm gonna get the steak sandwich,
medium, with grilled onions.

186
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,600
And can I get a side
of chips, please?

187
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,148
Oh, I'm sorry, we don't--

188
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,066
(Al)
He means French fries.

189
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,690
Twenty years here, he still
can't say French fries.

190
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,773
I'm gonna have the same thing,
actually, except rare on the steak.

191
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,823
And to drink,
we'll have a bottle of--

192
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,025
Really?

193
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,032
'92 Rothschild.

194
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,829
Fantastic selection.

195
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,827
(Will) So what are
we celebrating?

196
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,871
(Al) So A & A wants to use us.
For everything.

197
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,123
- They liked the campaign?
- Liked?

198
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,125
How 'bout I just got a
phone call from the CEO

199
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,459
that was basically
ten minutes of phone sex.

200
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,340
Hey, let me
ask you something.

201
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,762
How old are you?

202
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,009
- Old enough.
- Oh.

203
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,806
I'm Claire, by the way.

204
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,007
Hi, Claire. I'm AI.

205
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,810
- That's Will.
- Hi.

206
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,762
Please let me know if there's
anything else you need.

207
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:25,893
Anything?

208
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,442
Can you stop?
She's nineteen.

209
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,939
One hour.
That's all I ask.

210
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,521
Just one hour
with that ass.

211
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,525
(Will)
How's Barbara?

212
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,696
Oh, fuck off.

213
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,944
[chuckles]

214
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,324
[cheerful pop music]

215
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,285
[singing]

216
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,541
That is so weird.

217
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,965
Peter and I were just doing exactly
the same thing in his room.

218
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,714
(Annie) Ah, Dad. [all laugh]

219
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,933
Okay. What now?

220
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,744
What? How old
are you?

221
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,082
[Annie, whispering]
Why do you keep lying?

222
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,210
[phone rings]
What?

223
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,878
Why do you keep
lying to me?

224
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,004
(Peter) Man, you won't believe
the stuff I'm Finding in here.

225
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,841
(Will) I'll say.
You wanna keep these Playboys?

226
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,221
What?

227
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,643
Just kidding.

228
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,846
Oh. Yeah, me too. [chuckling]

229
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,307
What, you packed
'em already?

230
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,188
Yeah, kinda.

231
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,483
[chuckles]

232
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,861
You all right with this?

233
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,238
With What?

234
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,365
The whole college thing.

235
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,536
Yeah, I guess.

236
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,114
Don't feel pressured

237
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,700
into doing things
you don't want to do.

238
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,663
Wait. This isn't another
father-son talk, is it?

239
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,874
Oh, Dad, we had the sex talk,
like, three years ago

240
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,301
and I still can't order a salad
with cucumbers in it.

241
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,845
I just don't want you to lose
sight of what's important, like--

242
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,764
Taking responsibility
for my actions

243
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,094
living up to my potential
and personal expectations

244
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,726
staying true to my beliefs.
Basically, being a man?

245
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,728
Something like that.

246
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,232
Relax, Pop.
I got this. Trust me.

247
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,110
God. Come on.
Let's hug it out.

248
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,941
[chuckles]

249
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,007
I feel the same way.

250
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,128
You coming in, sweetheart?
It's getting cold.

251
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,588
Hold on a sec.

252
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,298
Um, I'm talking
to Brittany, Dad.

253
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,428
Two minutes.

254
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,975
Okay. Now go away.

255
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,105
Hi.

256
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,276
How do I know that?

257
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,826
Okay.

258
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:29,577
Well, are you
still a virgin?

259
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,288
Good, 'cause that would
have been creepy.

260
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,169
So, um, how old
were you when you--?

261
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,503
Did you set the alarm?

262
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,430
Force Held activated.

263
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,133
Is Annie upstairs?

264
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,560
She's in her room.
Peter's still out.

265
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,727
Amen to that.

266
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,099
You heartless witch.

267
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,647
What?
[chuckles]

268
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,724
You're happy he's
going, aren't you?

269
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,778
Two words for you.
Home gym.

270
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,151
[both chuckle]

271
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,531
His room's gonna look great
with a treadmill in it.

272
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,700
Our poor kid is barely packed and
you're already redecorating.

273
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:18,334
What can I say?
Except--good riddance! [chuckles]

274
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,307
[both laugh]
Fuck.

275
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,266
Oh, for God's--

276
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,154
(Annie)
They're in their room.

277
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:49,282
Right now?
Just a T-shirt and some underwear.

278
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,249
No. With just the T-shirt.

279
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,879
Okay.

280
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,636
Okay, it's dark now.

281
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,812
[chuckles softly]
Oh, I guess. What is it?

282
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,061
No.

283
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,650
[soft piano music]

284
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,236
Okay.

285
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,911
Is that everything?

286
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,462
Yeah.

287
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,005
Katie, come
give me a hug.

288
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,423
(Kate) No.
I don't want you to go.

289
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,637
[Peter clears throat]

290
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,720
So, I guess I'm gonna
go to college now.

291
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,561
I love you.
Email me, okay?

292
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,237
Okay. Hey,
and check my tweets.

293
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,235
(Will)
Okay, we gotta go, guys.

294
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,691
(Will)
We'll see you later.

295
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,948
(Lynn) Bye. Bye, angel. Bye.

296
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,878
[guide explaining,
bells tolling]

297
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,779
Hi. Uh, it's me again.

298
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,410
Where are you? I'm sitting
on the bench just outside.

299
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,581
Annie?

300
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,250
Yes?

301
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,748
It's me. Charlie.

302
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,580
Hey, you.

303
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:10,260
God, I can't believe
it's really you.

304
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,508
Look at you.
You're gorgeous.

305
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,885
Is this a joke?

306
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,683
What?

307
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,728
No, it's me, Charlie.

308
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,022
What's wrong?

309
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,191
You're not 25.

310
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:30,864
Oh. Well, hey.

311
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,862
Don't get upset.

312
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,363
Annie, please.

313
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,571
Just give me
a chance to explain.

314
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,203
It's me, Charlie.

315
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,625
I'm sorry, I, but--

316
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,294
Okay, all right.
You're right.

317
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,167
I just couldn't think
of a way to tell you.

318
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,045
You have to believe me.

319
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,549
Annie, please. Please?

320
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,131
Don't get upset.
You're killing me here.

321
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:02,812
Annie? It's
still me. Okay?

322
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,357
Forget the age thing.
All that stuff that we talked about?

323
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,652
All the things that we shared?
It's me. Charlie.

324
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,106
I'm sitting right
here next to you.

325
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,409
Why do you keep
lying to me?

326
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,242
Because of this.

327
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,825
I was,
I was afraid

328
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:28,755
that you wouldn't be mature
enough to understand.

329
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:34,711
Annie, when you connect with
someone the way that we connected

330
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:40,392
when you find a soul mate the
way that we found each other

331
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,640
then nothing else matters.

332
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,973
I thought you were old
enough to understand that.

333
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,481
I mean, you made me think you
could handle this, Annie.

334
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,569
I mean, this
is ridiculous.

335
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,868
I mean,
it's me, Charlie.

336
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,573
The same guy that you've been talking
to every day and every night

337
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,499
for the last
two months.

338
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,120
I love you.

339
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,882
Annie.

340
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:18,304
And I don't get why age
has to change that.

341
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,392
Can we just
walk a bit? Huh?

342
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,764
Talk a little bit more.

343
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,562
Just for a couple
of minutes

344
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:32,315
before I have my long drive
back to the airport?

345
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,067
Come on. Just--

346
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,901
I was just looking forward
to seeing you so much.

347
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,409
I thought we were
friends at least, Annie.

348
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,011
This remind you
of anything?

349
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:04,308
I was just thinking that.
Your year abroad in London.

350
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,808
All these American students come in.
I saw this girl.

351
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,265
Love at first sight.

352
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,271
Didn't work out.
I ended up with you.

353
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,479
There.

354
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,199
Sorry.

355
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,000
(Lynn)
Go ahead, spin it.

356
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:39,010
(Annie) The candy's weird.
It's better without it.

357
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,381
(Charlie)
Can I have some of yours?

358
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,475
Oh.

359
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:55,902
Yeah. You win.
Pistachio rocks.

360
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,900
So Peter
took off, huh?

361
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,356
You must be
so excited.

362
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,988
Yeah, I'm happy
for him.

363
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,910
I'm just gonna miss
him, that's all.

364
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,783
I just hope he doesn't
get caught up

365
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,956
into that whole
fraternity rush thing.

366
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,954
Sounds so stupid.

367
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,582
Yeah, there's definitely some
stupid stuff involved, but

368
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,413
I have to say
I was a Delt

369
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,090
and there were some great
things about it, too.

370
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,170
I met some, some quality guys that
I hope will be friends for life.

371
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,052
Yeah, I just, when he drinks
he kind of loses control.

372
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:30,762
This one time he tried to text
me the sound of him vomiting.

373
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,439
It's kind of tough to spell.
[chuckles]

374
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,143
it's kind of--
I, I don't know.

375
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,151
It's like, "UG,"
I don't know. But...

376
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,952
I just hope he doesn't just
do it to party and get laid.

377
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,996
But, yeah, I guess that's
what college is for, right?

378
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,792
Finding out for yourself,
finding out who you are.

379
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,037
What?

380
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,964
Nothing.

381
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,632
It's just

382
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,712
you amaze me.
Seriously.

383
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:07,799
You're so intelligent
and sensitive, like

384
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,975
wise beyond your years.

385
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,805
It's just amazing,
that's all.

386
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,225
Hey.

387
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,687
Want me to teach you the
secret Delt handshake?

388
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,273
Okay.

389
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,699
You can't
tell anyone.

390
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,900
I won't.

391
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,110
Okay.

392
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,695
Stick out your hand

393
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,371
like you're
gonna shake mine.

394
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,588
So--

395
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,671
So.

396
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,599
You still mad at me?

397
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,768
No, not really.

398
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,024
Wanna check out
your present?

399
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,851
Oh, yeah.

400
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,364
You said you'd want
one in red, so--

401
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,073
It's sexy, right?

402
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:18,377
I can't tell you how many times
I've thought about you in it.

403
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,877
It's crazy, I'm so
nervous and excited

404
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:30,385
to be sitting here with you
finally after all this time.

405
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,314
[soft piano music]

406
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,735
[soft piano
music continues]

407
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,989
There.

408
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,323
Happy?

409
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,630
You look
ridiculously sexy.

410
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,584
No, don't go.

411
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,293
I'm serious.

412
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,592
Come here.

413
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,842
Come sit down.

414
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,816
(Charlie) Have you thought
about us like this?

415
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,660
I know you have because you
told me about it, didn't you?

416
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,538
(Annie) You don't think
my body's weird?

417
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,090
Are you kidding?

418
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:32,261
You're,
you're gorgeous.

419
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:40,766
So you're not--
disappointed or anything?

420
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,565
Annie. Annie.

421
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,062
You're perfect.

422
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,110
You take
my breath away.

423
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,040
Can I just--?

424
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,557
No, wait, Charlie, wait.
Hold on.

425
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,813
It's okay.

426
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,859
Charlie--

427
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,313
It's okay.

428
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,989
Charlie, wait.

429
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,953
Charlie.

430
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,497
[sobbing]

431
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,873
[breathing fast]

432
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,027
It's okay, Annie.
Don't worry.

433
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:16,027
[soft metallic
clinking of belt]

434
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,325
I'm just
taking these off

435
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,033
Oh. Hold still, Annie.
I've gotta take these off too.

436
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,916
That's my girl.

437
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,966
Oh, God.
Look at you.

438
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:41,887
[kissing and gentle sobbing]

439
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,684
(Charlie)
This is perfect.

440
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,566
(Lynn) How about the boys in class?
[cutlery clinking]

441
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,866
(Kate)
They 're okay.

442
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,070
(Lynn)
Are they?

443
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,282
(Kate) Um, we're making
bowls in pottery class, but

444
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,834
mine looks like
an ashtray

445
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,537
which is kind of funny
because I don't smoke.

446
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,917
[Will and Lynn laugh]

447
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,794
(Lynn) Nice. [chuckling]

448
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,002
How 'bout you, Annie?
How's school?

449
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,132
Annie.

450
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,554
Hm?

451
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:24,179
School.
How is it?

452
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,351
(Lynn)
Annie?

453
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,607
[chatter]

454
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,820
(girl)
He's so cute.

455
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,243
(Serena)
I know.

456
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,865
You should
go out with him.

457
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,413
(Brit)
Did you get my text?

458
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,785
Mm-hm.

459
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,866
Why didn't you
call me back?

460
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,874
(girl 2) Check it out, Annie.
Your boyfriend.

461
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,546
(girls)
OW!

462
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,840
I told you before.
He's not my boyfriend.

463
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,755
(girl 2) You keep saying that.
Makes me think you like him.

464
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,586
If you're so obsessed
with him, why you fuck him?

465
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,797
- What's your problem?
- Yeah? He's cute!

466
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,521
(Annie)
Pick up, please pick up.

467
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:15,726
(Brit)
ls this about Charlie?

468
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,152
(Annie)
No. No.

469
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,945
(Brit)
Annie, what happened?

470
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,489
That was him
at the mall, wasn't it?

471
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,612
How old is he?

472
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,863
It doesn't matter.

473
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,114
Annie, wait.

474
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,035
Oh, my God.

475
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,161
(Annie) It 's not
that big a deal.

476
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,667
We me! up on Saturday.
We had sex.

477
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,464
[hits locker, sobs]

478
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,792
(Annie)
We're in love.

479
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,377
(Brit)
Oh, my God.

480
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,134
Now just drop it.
I'm serious.

481
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,714
[school bell ringing]

482
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,845
(teacher)
The word ciao

483
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:51,554
comes from schiavo,
or servant, and was used as--

484
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,434
(woman)
Sorry to interrupt, uh

485
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,357
mind if I borrow Annie
Cameron for a second?

486
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,186
(Annie) Ms.
Worley, why are we going this way?

487
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:02,113
Oh, it's all right,
Annie. Come on in.

488
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,116
Why don't you
have a seat?

489
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,044
I know, yeah.

490
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,248
Holy shit!
Dude, dude.

491
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,806
[muffled knocking]

492
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:37,482
(Will) No, it's Antigua.
Anguilla is a totally different island.

493
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,434
Honestly, I was hoping
to get the crew

494
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,441
and the equipment
in the same place.

495
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,488
Yeah. Hang on.
Hang on just a second.

496
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,782
Hello. Speaking.

497
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,325
[suspense music]

498
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,994
Sorry, I,
I don't understand.

499
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,914
(Lynn)
Will. Will!

500
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,242
What happened?

501
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,415
They won't tell me anything.
I just, I just! got here, and I--

502
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,246
Excuse me. Annie Cameron.
We're the parents.

503
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,455
Let me find
the nurse.

504
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,665
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron?

505
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,591
I'm Officer Gomez.

506
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,544
Your daughter wants you to
know that she's okay, but

507
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,879
maybe you should
have a seat.

508
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,555
- What's going on?
- What?

509
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,756
We don't know exactly
what's happened.

510
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,261
What we do know so far

511
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,888
is that we think
she was assaulted

512
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,515
by her alleged
boyfriend three days ago.

513
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,891
She hasn't
got a boyfriend.

514
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,473
Well, apparently
on Saturday

515
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,479
she met up with a man
she calls Charlie

516
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,186
at a motel, where she
was sexually assaulted.

517
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,897
The man is at least
35 years old.

518
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,448
Jesus Christ.
Where is she?

519
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,525
She's in an exam room
with the nurse

520
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,702
collecting evidence for the rape kit.
She's okay.

521
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,824
One of the counselors from
the hospital is with her.

522
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,871
I have to see her.

523
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,665
Look, there is a private waiting
room just down the hall--

524
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,083
We have to see her
right now!

525
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,206
We want to see
her right now.

526
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,881
She's having an exam.
You'll see her in a minute.

527
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,107
(nurse)
I'm almost done.

528
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,809
I just need to get one more
picture of that abrasion.

529
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,444
(Will) This is fucking insane.

530
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,450
On, baby.

531
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,831
[sobbing]

532
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:28,423
It's okay. We're here.
We're here now.

533
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,549
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron,
I'm Gail Friedman.

534
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,801
I'm a counselor
with the hospital.

535
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,678
I'm glad
you're here.

536
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,885
- Annie here is an amazing young woman.
- Gail.

537
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,346
- Ah. This is Special Agent Doug Tate with the FBI.
- Hi.

538
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,102
FBI?

539
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,603
(Doug) Well, any time
a crime is committed

540
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,229
against a child
using the Internet

541
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,982
and the suspect
is a traveler

542
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,905
someone from out of
state, they call us in.

543
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,074
Look, Annie, I know
you've had a rough day.

544
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,572
But I need to ask you a couple of questions.
You feel up for it?

545
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,950
Do we have
to do this now?

546
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,077
Trust me, the sooner we start
this investigation, the better.

547
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,783
Gail, do we still have the clothes
she was wearing that night?

548
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,243
- Yes.
- Are they here?

549
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,203
No, they're
at her house.

550
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,288
Okay, I need to get those
from you as soon as possible.

551
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,498
Is that okay?

552
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,924
Yeah, I guess.

553
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,001
Mr. Cameron,
Mrs. Cameron

554
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,634
I would like to talk to Annie alone.
Could you please just--

555
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,305
Look, I've had
enough of this.

556
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,383
This is our daughter.
We wanna be with her.

557
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,594
(Gail) You've got to
understand that right now

558
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,595
Annie's a victim of a crime and you
and your wife are just witnesses.

559
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,773
That's why we interview
everybody separately

560
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,975
so as not to contaminate
anyone's testimony.

561
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,560
Now if you can just give
Annie and I a second alone

562
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,065
and then I'll come
back to your house

563
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,238
and we can all
sit down and talk.

564
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,485
Fair enough?

565
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,168
(Lynn) So how long
will this take?

566
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,463
Well, it depends if we get enough
genetic material to run a profile.

567
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,085
And if there is,
how long?

568
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,212
Right now, there's
a nationwide backlog.

569
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,760
In Illinois alone, we've
got 2,000 unopened kits

570
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,304
sitting in freezers
waiting to be processed.

571
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,801
Some people have been
waiting a year.

572
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,723
- What? - How is that possible?

573
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,551
We'll run this through
the FBI facilities.

574
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,011
So, two weeks,
a month on the outside.

575
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,516
A month?

576
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,441
Now can I see
the family computer?

577
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,312
(man)
Doug.

578
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,894
Yeah.

579
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,071
- Did you copy the hard drive?
- Yup.

580
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,649
- We'll take that with the evidence down to the lab.
- Okay.

581
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,234
Apart from Teen Chat

582
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,943
were there any
other networking sites

583
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,448
you used to communicate?

584
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,996
No, not really.

585
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,120
Did you guys ever
speak on the phone?

586
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,076
You spoke to him.

587
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,912
(Doug) Now, you said
his mother was sick.

588
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:27,962
Yeah. Cancer.

589
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,755
Yeah, okay.

590
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,424
Tell him you feel awful
about his mother

591
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,172
that you really
wanna talk to him

592
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,595
that you lost
an uncle to cancer.

593
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,762
I-I don't know.

594
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,682
You don't know what?

595
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,886
I just don't
wanna lie to him.

596
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,063
What are you talking about,
sweetheart? He lied to you.

597
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,482
(Lynn) What do you think
of writing to him

598
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,527
and just telling him
how you feel?

599
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,321
(Doug) Yeah, Annie.
Would that be good?

600
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,023
Yeah, I guess.

601
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,108
Okay, good.

602
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,785
(Doug) Okay, just keep
if simple- Be yourself

603
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,912
Maybe he didn't
even like me.

604
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,121
He didn't.

605
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,048
(Lynn)
Will!

606
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,467
(Will) it wasn't like
that, sweetheart.

607
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,544
The man tricked you.

608
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,347
(Will)
What?

609
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,890
[incoming message]

610
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,842
- (Will) Is that him?
- Charlie.

611
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,769
(Doug) Okay, now, remember,
he's gonna test you

612
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,346
to see if you told anybody.
You haven't, okay?

613
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,227
Tell him that
you're concerned

614
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,104
and a little worried that
he hasn't called. Okay?

615
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,400
Should I?

616
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,773
Yeah, answer
him. Yeah.

617
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,108
(Will) A-are, are you
guys tracing this?

618
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,410
Yes.

619
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,289
[phone rings]

620
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,836
It says private.
What do I do to answer it?

621
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,379
(Doug)
Frank, are we good?

622
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,298
We're good.
[phone ringing]

623
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,093
(Doug) Annie? Look at me?
Just, just talk to him.

624
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:57,919
All right?

625
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,379
Okay.

626
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,597
Hello?

627
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,519
(Charlie)
Annie?

628
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,891
Charlie?

629
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:08,688
Hi.

630
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,891
Hi.

631
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:14,274
(Charlie) It's kinda late.
Where are your parents?

632
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,528
They took Katie
to the movies.

633
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,986
Charlie?

634
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,243
[suspense music]

635
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,165
[phone ringing loud]

636
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,371
Shit.

637
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,508
(Charlie) Shame on you, Annie.
[hangs up]

638
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,052
Charlie?

639
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:39,969
Charlie, are
you there?

640
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:40,886
Charlie?

641
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,589
Damn it!

642
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,596
Frank, did
we get it?

643
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,269
Well, that's it.
He's gone.

644
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,223
Why did you
make me do that?

645
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,775
Annie!

646
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,105
(Doug) He probably got your
cell number off your website.

647
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,781
(Doug) Look, I'll
give you a call

648
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,484
when I get back
from the motel.

649
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:06,572
Tell me something.
Did she yell for help?

650
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,453
I mean, did she scream,
tell him to stop?

651
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,580
Just because she
didn't scream for help

652
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,286
does not mean
this wasn't rape.

653
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,371
Now that guy is 20 years
older than she is.

654
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,174
He groomed her for weeks just
to get her into the motel room

655
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,547
and she's armed with what?
The eighth-grade biology

656
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,300
and the expectation that the
world is a decent place.

657
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,380
I'm gonna fucking
kill this guy.

658
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,592
No, you won't. That's why I'm here.
Now, we will find him.

659
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,301
And what am I
supposed to do?

660
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,681
You go back inside,
you support your daughter

661
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,729
and you let us
do our job.

662
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,227
What, with just five of you
guys working the whole state?

663
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,309
There's gotta be something I can do.
I'm not just gonna stand around and wait--

664
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,939
Mr. Cameron, I promise you.

665
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,863
I put everything
I got into these cases.

666
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,362
You just gotta
give us a chance.

667
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,409
Now, my cell
is on the back.

668
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,911
You call me
if you need anything.

669
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,335
I'll drop you a line tomorrow
when I get back from the motel.

670
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,344
(Lynn) You want me to
sleep with you tonight?

671
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,555
No, I just want
my blanket.

672
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,610
[sobbing]

673
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,380
[Annie, sobbing]
No, please, stop.

674
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,386
(Annie)
Stop, please!

675
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,348
Dad, please help me
to stop him.

676
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,433
Please, Dad, help!

677
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:46,235
[screaming] Help me!
No, get off! [sobbing]

678
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,989
Don't Please, Dad, help me, please.
[sobbing and screaming]

679
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,865
Stop! No!

680
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,911
(Al)
Will.

681
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,916
You all
right, buddy?

682
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,963
Yeah, of course.

683
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,088
If Mrs. Van Dersey
wants the meeting, fine.

684
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,171
But I think that we should
dictate the parameters.

685
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,675
No more of this bullshit.

686
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,304
Good.

687
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,225
Is there
any more coffee?

688
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,646
Grab another coffee.

689
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,567
(Will) Hey.
I got you a new cell.

690
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,107
Now, you have
to promise me

691
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,564
that you're not
gonna try and call him

692
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,070
or text him
with this new number.

693
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,402
Remember what Tate
said about the old one

694
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,704
that if he tries to call you on
that, you tell us immediately.

695
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,577
I'm gonna have
to check the bills.

696
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:39,751
And if I find out that
you've tried to contact him

697
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,999
I'm gonna have
to take it back.

698
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,751
Okay?

699
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,557
So what? Do I just start
talking like Tony Soprano?

700
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:42,230
Boy, I hope not.
[chuckles softly]

701
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,730
I'm glad you came.

702
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,981
Yeah, well, my parents
said I had to.

703
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,688
Well, even so,
I'm still glad.

704
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,239
I want this
to be a place

705
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,908
for you to feel
safe and comfortable

706
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,360
talking about anything.

707
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,161
I just wanna
be helpful to you.

708
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,238
You think
I need help?

709
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:02,075
I think that what you've been
through must be very difficult.

710
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,581
You know, what's
the big deal?

711
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,287
There are girls
at my school

712
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,044
who've had sex
with half the football team.

713
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,466
I lose my virginity
and my parents

714
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,168
make a federal case
out of it.

715
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,594
Literally.

716
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,046
I think they're
more concerned

717
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,301
that you may have
been in danger

718
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,256
more than anything else.

719
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,842
Danger?

720
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,678
That's 'cause
they don't know him.

721
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,809
You know,
the thing is

722
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,563
I bet my dad would
really like him

723
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,067
if they'd met,
you know, before.

724
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,864
What is it about him you think
your father would like?

725
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,447
He's sweet, and smart,
and really funny.

726
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,532
And gives great advice and
which, by the way, worked.

727
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,709
I-I made the team
because of him.

728
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,582
You think that's the only
reason you made the team?

729
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:50,541
Because of his advice,
and not your own ability?

730
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:54,378
Well, he's older.
He's been playing longer.

731
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,508
What'd you think
about him being older?

732
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:01,218
At first I thought
he was 16, okay?

733
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:06,397
And then, all of a sudden
he's 20 and I'm like, what?

734
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,850
And then we kept talking

735
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:12,983
and I was, like,
what's the big deal?

736
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:15,736
He gets me, you know?

737
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,364
He's not judgmental.

738
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,821
He's encouraging.

739
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:26,375
And despite my age difference
he still loves me.

740
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,330
And he thinks
I'm beautiful.

741
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,166
What'd you think
about him

742
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,093
not being honest
about his age?

743
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,593
You know,
Charlie said that

744
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:43,302
when you connect
like we did

745
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:47,355
when you find
that soul mate

746
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,435
that's the only thing
to think about.

747
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,270
Don't you believe that when
two people are in love

748
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,197
nothing else matters?

749
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,992
I can understand how strong
those feelings are, Annie.

750
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:04,072
But, there are reasons why
girls your age and men his

751
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,828
aren't supposed
to be together.

752
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,204
Whatever.

753
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:12,881
He loves me.
I know he does.

754
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,959
And he's dying
to call me or email me

755
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,090
but he knows it's no! safe

756
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:22,299
thanks to my parents
and the FBI.

757
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,759
I just--

758
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,642
What?

759
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,065
I just hope he's okay.

760
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,269
[suspense music]

761
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,025
What, he go to lunch early?

762
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,323
He went home.
Said he wasn't feeling well.

763
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,410
Hello?

764
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:44,908
Will, it's Agent Tate.

765
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,705
I wanted to give
you an update.

766
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,455
Now, look, the motel
didn't give us much.

767
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,206
He paid cash
for the room.

768
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,379
He told the manager
he lost his wallet.

769
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,548
He even ordered a credit
card right in front of him.

770
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,508
The, uh, the cell phone was prepaid.
It was purchased in St. Louis.

771
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,803
He paid cash for that,
too, whoever he is.

772
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,255
So his name's not
Charles Hightower.

773
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,090
Yeah, not that
we can tell.

774
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,800
I found seven of them living
in the U.S. so far

775
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,056
but none of 'em
fit the description.

776
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,433
There 's nothing that even
confirms he's from California

777
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,477
we, uh, we actually traced his IP
address to the Czech Republic.

778
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,308
What?

779
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,815
It seems he's running some
sort of ghost program.

780
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,817
It's a software
that basically bounces

781
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,022
his IP address from
one server to another

782
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,028
all over the world.

783
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,324
Sir?

784
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,492
Sorry, I don't understand.

785
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,240
What does that mean?

786
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,413
It means he's good
at what he's doing.

787
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,911
But don't worry, don't worry.
This is exactly how it starts.

788
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,412
You need to go on through,
go get your stuff.

789
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,789
Yeah, one minute, please.

790
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,085
What about the car?
Anything?

791
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,084
Hang up the phone, sir.

792
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,756
It was an airport rental.
He must've swapped the plates.

793
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,675
Gary!

794
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,047
(Will) Look, I'm, I'll have
to call you back. Okay?

795
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,549
Seriously, is
my conversation

796
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,505
that much of a threat
to security?

797
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,760
Thank you, sir.

798
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,305
Is it over?

799
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,608
Yeah, you missed
a pretty good fight.

800
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,186
(Lynn) When they do Real
Housewives of Chicago

801
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,896
I am so auditioning.

802
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,198
Yeah, right.

803
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,236
I talked to Jennie.

804
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,868
Brittany's really upset
you won't call her back.

805
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,494
Good.

806
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,036
She was only
trying to help, honey.

807
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,371
Yeah, well, she's a bitch.

808
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,877
No, she's
your best friend.

809
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,334
Best friends don't
narc on each other.

810
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,385
Not like she'll ever
get a boyfriend

811
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,180
but if she does, I hope someone
ruins it for her, too.

812
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,632
(Will)
Lynn?

813
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,682
(Will)
Did you get my message?

814
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,353
Yeah, I called
you back

815
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,603
but it went to voice mail.
Did you eat?

816
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,275
Have a look
at this a second.

817
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,977
You won't believe this.

818
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,061
[typing]

819
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,772
What is this?

820
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:46,200
This is the National
Sex Offenders Registry.

821
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:50,200
There's perverts all over
Wilmette, not just Chicago.

822
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,333
See this? All
these red dots.

823
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,534
They're everywhere.

824
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,588
Oh, my God.

825
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,757
This guy here is literally
three blocks away on Linden.

826
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,425
What's going on?

827
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,471
Hi, sweetheart.
Um, come here a second.

828
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,424
I, I need you to do
something for me.

829
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,518
These men are all registered sex
offenders in the neighborhood

830
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,978
that fit the description.

831
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,654
I need you to look
through them.

832
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,072
Why?

833
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,649
In case one of them's Charlie.

834
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,951
What?

835
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,120
No. N-- No.

836
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,790
(Lynn) Honey, you should.
One of them could be him.

837
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,137
None of them's him.

838
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,594
Forget the hair and the mustaches.
Just look at the face.

839
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,099
Could any
of them be him?

840
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,146
I said, no.

841
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,769
God, what's
your problem?

842
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,521
My problem is you
were attacked.

843
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,352
It wasn't like that.

844
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,564
Besides, none of them
are Charlie, okay?

845
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,150
Are we done?

846
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,335
(Lynn) Pervert Tracker.
What is this?

847
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,293
It's a group
I met with today.

848
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:31,093
(Will) Supposed to be the best in the country.
They hunt predators.

849
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,890
Today? It says
they're in New Jersey.

850
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,850
You were in New Jersey today?

851
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,352
You got on a plane today
without telling me?

852
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,732
Are you fucking
kidding me?

853
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,654
I swear to God, Will

854
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,153
if you ever get on a plane
again without telling me

855
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,280
I swear to God, I don't
know what I'd do.

856
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,861
I'm sorry.

857
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,574
Honey, you're right.
I'm sorry.

858
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,159
I'm gonna go
check on her.

859
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,246
[suspense music]

860
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,960
(Annie) I've gotta
get out of my house.

861
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,883
How come? What's
happening at home?

862
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,883
You know, they think I'm stupid
for meeting up with him.

863
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,054
Going back to his hotel.

864
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,428
They said that?

865
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:01,308
My dad looks at me
like I'm an idiot.

866
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:04,857
He wants to kill Charlie.
That's all he talks about.

867
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,730
Getting his hands on him.

868
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,686
Well, what would you do if
he got in touch with you

869
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,113
have you thought about what
you would say to him?

870
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,988
I just wanna talk to him.
Hear his voice.

871
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,700
See how his mom's doing,
and his little dog.

872
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:25,662
See how we're gonna
make this work.

873
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,129
I just wanna talk to him
about what happened.

874
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,677
We haven 'I really
talked about that

875
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:38,474
about what happened
in the motel.

876
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,643
Are we supposed to?

877
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:44,268
In my experience,
it helps. It really does.

878
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,144
But only if you're ready.

879
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,321
Li 's kind of weird,
you know.

880
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,874
Like it wasn't really
happening to me.

881
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,552
Like I was watching it
from above.

882
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:25,055
Sometimes when you can't
physically escape from a situation

883
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:28,983
where you feel frightened
or threatened

884
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:35,064
you find a way to remove or
distance yourself psychologically.

885
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:38,651
It's a way
of protecting yourself.

886
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,283
Does that make sense?

887
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,791
Still have ten minutes.

888
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,210
Yeah, well.
I'll see you later.

889
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,754
(Al) Chicago has a very
strong sense of history.

890
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,127
Kinda like when they bought Marshall
Fields, turned it into a Macy's.

891
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,959
They lost half
their client base.

892
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,919
(Will) It's a fine line.
You want a fresh look

893
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,800
but you don't want to alienate
your loyal customers.

894
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,301
We loved what you
did with A & A

895
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,007
particularly
in the tween market.

896
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,592
Well, that was mostly
Will's work here.

897
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,177
Well, I don't know
if that's true

898
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,763
but I'm very happy
to take the credit.

899
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,653
(man)
Rebecca?

900
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,981
Becky.

901
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:17,815
Jerry?

902
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:18,774
Yeah.

903
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,234
Hi, Jerry.

904
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,911
Look at you.
You're gorgeous.

905
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,909
(Becky over mic)
You really think so?

906
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,709
(Jerry over mic)
Yeah. Can't believe it's you.

907
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,331
Did you bring
your stuff?

908
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,506
(Jerry)
Uh--

909
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,208
Fuck!

910
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,588
(Doug) Hey! Hey! Stop! FBI!

911
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:42,720
(Becky)
Hey, get that guy!

912
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,768
(Doug) Go, guys, get him, get him!
Come on!

913
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:46,639
Hey!

914
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,439
Actually, there's
a lot of similarities

915
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,562
between your company
and Academic Appeal.

916
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,315
It's just you have a much more
sophisticated client base.

917
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,113
Everybody wants to broaden
their consumer appeal

918
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,940
especially in the tween market.

919
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,993
I mean, it's like
the Holy Grail of--

920
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:07,494
Sorry, would you just
excuse me a minute?

921
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,122
(Doug) Look, I'm
really sorry, Will.

922
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,749
So what made you think
he was our guy?

923
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,456
The program he was running
to scatter his IP address

924
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,041
the chat rooms he used.

925
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,296
Mostly, Will, it was
his conversation.

926
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,218
It was the way he spoke.

927
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,046
It was very similar
to the way Charlie chatted.

928
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,177
How do you know that?

929
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,429
I was able to get transcripts
of two months worth of IM chats

930
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,977
between him and your
daughter from Teen Chat.

931
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,019
You're kidding.

932
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,722
No. I'm not.

933
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,852
So when can I see them?

934
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,308
You can't, Will.

935
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,189
It's an ongoing
investigation.

936
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,066
I'd completely lose
Annie's trust.

937
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,943
Now, I do have
some good news.

938
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,866
The lab was able to extract
enough DNA for a profile.

939
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,818
We're gonna run it through
CODIS, the national database

940
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,870
and if there's a hit
we should know

941
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,039
within a week or two
at the most.

942
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,663
Hey, I'll be right back.
I gotta call in.

943
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,047
(Will)
Lynn.

944
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,803
Will, what are you
doing here?

945
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,099
I just came
from seeing Tate.

946
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,518
What's wrong?

947
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,561
You're not gonna
believe this.

948
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:12,729
What? What
is this?

949
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,226
Read it.

950
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:15,307
What is it?

951
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:15,982
Just read it.

952
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,779
"l can't stop
thinking about it."

953
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,606
"You inside me.
I get wet when I picture it."

954
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,986
Okay, stop.

955
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,068
Our daughter
wrote this.

956
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,245
Annie.

957
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,287
"How big are you?
I bet you taste good."

958
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,615
Will, stop it.

959
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,823
"l wanna see it
right now."

960
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,750
Stop it,
Jesus God!

961
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,919
I mean, she's 14.
Where the hell did she learn this?

962
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,917
She's 14, she didn't
make this happen!

963
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,794
Yeah, but we're gonna have
to talk to her about this.

964
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,546
- You are not gonna talk to her.
- But look at it!

965
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,252
Our daughter sounds like
a fucking porn star!

966
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,588
You cannot confront
her about this.

967
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,014
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No.

968
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,716
I swear to God,
I'm gonna find

969
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,642
this animal and I'm
gonna fucking kill him!

970
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,845
Stop it!

971
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,852
Oh, my God.
You're acting crazy, Will.

972
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:59,435
No, you're not gonna--
You're not gonna read this.

973
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,486
Just leave it alone.
Give it to me.

974
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,110
I'll see you tonight.

975
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,984
(Doug) Now I need you to bring
that back to me right now, Will.

976
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,785
I'll get it back
to you tomorrow.

977
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,737
You do know it's
a federal crime, right?

978
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,289
(Will) I just think I
have a right to know

979
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,241
who my daughter's
talking to.

980
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,247
No, no, no. You are interfering
with the investigation.

981
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,498
You've betrayed your
daughter's trust to me.

982
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,204
She doesn't need to know.

983
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,085
You're not letting me
do my job, Mr. Cameron.

984
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,711
I need you to bring them
back to me right now, Will.

985
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,338
Yeah, I will.
I'll get it back to you.

986
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,761
Right--
[cell phone disconnects]

987
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,088
Oh, you son of a bitch.

988
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,887
[pop music and chatter]

989
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,484
Hey, stranger.

990
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:50,410
This is something, huh?

991
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,989
Oh, yeah, it's great. I feel 80.

992
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,073
Mojito?

993
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,660
I'm fine, thanks.

994
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,837
(man)
Hey, great party, man.

995
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,542
(Al)
Will, come here!

996
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,282
[suspense music]

997
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,968
Will. Are you
all right?

998
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,766
No, I'm, I'm, I'm
just feeling, I'm--

999
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,343
S-- Sorry.

1000
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,928
[shattered glass]

1001
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,139
Will? Will!

1002
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,507
[suspense music continues]

1003
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,526
I heard the door.

1004
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,828
(Will)
That was me.

1005
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,871
I, I couldn't sleep.
I took a drive.

1006
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,870
Well, you scared me.

1007
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,456
Will, you scared me.

1008
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:06,084
Sorry.

1009
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,174
All right, so,
are you coming up?

1010
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,968
In a bit.

1011
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,595
What are you doing?

1012
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,096
Nothing.

1013
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,784
Is this you?

1014
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,090
Are you, are you
Sad Little Girl?

1015
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,671
What are you doing?

1016
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,973
You're posing
as a teenage girl

1017
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,767
to chat with men
on line, seriously?

1018
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,389
That's what they do.
They showed me.

1019
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:03,846
Oh, my God.

1020
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:06,478
It's a way
of drawing them out.

1021
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,240
Good night.

1022
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,937
(Lynn) I spoke to Pete today.

1023
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:32,984
He's coming home
for Halloween.

1024
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:36,025
(Lynn) Well, he said he would try.
He's got a lot of work.

1025
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,607
But, and he sounds
good. Happy.

1026
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,113
You didn't tell
him, did you?

1027
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,239
(Lynn)
No. But I--

1028
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,445
Don't, okay?

1029
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,781
Oh, about what?
What?

1030
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,958
Remember what we talked
about upstairs, sweetie

1031
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,535
about Annie
being hurt?

1032
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:50,834
I'm serious, okay?

1033
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,457
Okay.

1034
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:59,094
How 'bout we go to the
movies this weekend?

1035
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,967
Is there anything
you wanna see?

1036
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,390
Nothing you'd
be interested in.

1037
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,560
Well, try me.
I may surprise you.

1038
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:07,726
Yeah, right.

1039
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:11,181
What does that mean?

1040
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,438
Why are you being so mean to me?
What did I do?

1041
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,643
I'm not being mean.

1042
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,149
Katie, am I being mean?

1043
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,697
(Kate)
No.

1044
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,026
How 'bout we go on a
bike ride this weekend?

1045
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:25,954
(Kale) Well, yeah.
Uh, can we also go along the lake?

1046
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:29,829
Yeah. And we can go to that
favorite rock that you like.

1047
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,501
Cool.

1048
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,666
(Annie)
Great.

1049
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:42,004
(Lynn) You know, you don
'I have to do this, honey.

1050
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,634
Yeah, I know.

1051
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:50,854
Well, call me if you
need anything, okay?

1052
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:55,851
Honey? Give me a kiss.

1053
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,565
I love you.

1054
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,446
See you later.

1055
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:04,617
Okay.

1056
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,951
You're gonna have
to talk to me sometime.

1057
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,377
I'm really sorry,
Annie, okay?

1058
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,171
I didn't know
what else to do.

1059
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,373
Annie?

1060
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,457
You're sorry?

1061
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:20,838
Yeah.

1062
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,636
Do you realize
what you did?

1063
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,679
You fucked up everything.

1064
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,883
Charlie, my parents, everything.

1065
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,183
I was scared, okay?

1066
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,102
No. It's not okay.

1067
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,145
I kept every
secret of yours.

1068
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:37,692
Annie, you're my best friend
and I was worried about you.

1069
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:42,568
"Was." I was
your best friend.

1070
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,400
Do me a favor and never
talk to me again.

1071
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,279
Annie.

1072
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,578
Annie!

1073
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,914
(Al) That was fucking embarrassing
at the big launch party.

1074
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,787
Oh, yeah, I know,
I'm sorry.

1075
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,334
It was just some personal stuff.
It was nothing.

1076
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,252
You're sure?

1077
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:59,206
Because you've been kind
of MIA around here lately.

1078
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,667
There just could not be a
worse time to be distracted

1079
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,422
while I really need
your head in the game.

1080
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,469
What, you don't think
I'm giving a 100 %, Coach?

1081
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,799
Well, you tell me.
I put this on your desk a week ago.

1082
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,635
Mel's been waiting since Monday
for you to sign off on this.

1083
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,720
Well, tell him, then, fine.
Run with it.

1084
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,976
You haven't even looked
at it, have you?

1085
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,558
What the hell's
going on?

1086
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,866
It's Annie.

1087
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:34,203
She was sexually assaulted.

1088
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:35,704
What?

1089
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,791
Oh, my God.

1090
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,962
I had no idea, Will.

1091
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:48,422
She's fine.
I mean, she wasn't, but she's okay.

1092
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,303
They catch the guy?

1093
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,133
They're looking for him.

1094
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,595
They started with the
crime scene in the motel.

1095
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,145
Jesus. She
was kidnapped?

1096
01:06:56,221 --> 01:07:00,067
No, she-- She sort
of knew the guy.

1097
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,564
I-- I don't understand.

1098
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,271
It was someone
she met online

1099
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,982
someone she'd been
talking to for a while.

1100
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:12,071
Oh, I thought you meant she was
like attacked, you know. I--

1101
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,951
You scared the shit
out of me.

1102
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,499
She was raped.

1103
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,497
She's 14.
The guy's in his 30s.

1104
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,204
I know, I know.
It's just that I was picturing--

1105
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,040
Well, you don't wanna know
what I was picturing.

1106
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,592
Could have been
much worse.

1107
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:31,844
[Will, knocking]
Hey, can I come in?

1108
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,800
I guess. What's up?

1109
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:37,933
How was school?

1110
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,390
Okay.

1111
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,858
Was it weird seeing
your friends again?

1112
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,909
It was fine, Dad.

1113
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,373
Did you see Gail today?

1114
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,831
No, tomorrow.

1115
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,287
How, how's that going?

1116
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:05,374
Great. I'm cured.

1117
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,973
Still no contact
from "Charlie"?

1118
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,392
I hate when you do that.

1119
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,724
Say his name like that.

1120
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,933
It's not his
real name, is it?

1121
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,314
What do you want, Dad?

1122
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:26,565
Has there been
any contact?

1123
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:27,566
No.

1124
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,488
None at all?

1125
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:31,032
What, you don't
believe me?

1126
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,575
You wanna check
my phone?

1127
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,617
Would you have
a problem with that?

1128
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,036
Yeah, I would.

1129
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,408
Why, if there's
nothing to hide

1130
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,535
why would that
be a problem?

1131
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,208
You're unbelievable.

1132
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,411
What?

1133
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,621
Take it.
What's your problem?

1134
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:48,174
What is my problem?
My problem is you lied to me, sweetheart.

1135
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,344
From the second that you knew he
wasn't 15, you should have told me

1136
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:54,298
and you didn't.
You lied.

1137
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,883
Why didn't you come and
talk to me or your mother

1138
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:00,812
and say what was going on?

1139
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,935
When you found out
for the first time, what--

1140
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,766
What were you thinking?

1141
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:07,602
You didn't know then that
something was wrong?

1142
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,734
When you, you met him in the mall
and saw him for the first time

1143
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,532
what do you do, you don't call me?
You don't run away?

1144
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:16,157
You get in a car with him?
it's like rule number one.

1145
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,329
You know, I'm trying
to understa--

1146
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,451
Please just leave me alone.

1147
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,998
But talk to me. I--

1148
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,075
You're just pissed
you didn't know.

1149
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,751
No, that's not--

1150
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,328
No, everything
would've been fine

1151
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,163
if everyone would've
just chilled out.

1152
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,463
- What are you talking about?
- Charlie and me.

1153
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,631
Are you out
of your mind?

1154
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:30,754
You're the crazy one!

1155
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,176
Checking my phone,

1156
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,628
bringing out sickos
on the web.

1157
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,758
I'm trying
to find the scumbag!

1158
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,009
He's not like that!

1159
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,887
You don't even know him!

1160
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:39,808
My God, you're protecting him.
The guy raped you.

1161
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,181
And you're protecting him.

1162
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,012
He didn't rape me!

1163
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:45,315
Get out, get out of my
fucking room right now!

1164
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,108
I hate you. Get out!

1165
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,026
Get out!

1166
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,399
Get out of my room!

1167
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,966
I just wanted to know
how Annie's doing.

1168
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,590
You know I can't discuss her
treatment with you, Mr. Cameron.

1169
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,342
I'm sorry, but this still
doesn't make sense to me.

1170
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:18,014
She's my daughter.
A minor.

1171
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,308
If she needed
an appendectomy

1172
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,226
you'd need my signature
for surgery, right?

1173
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,518
Therapy is different.

1174
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,141
Yeah, but this whole--

1175
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,518
None of this makes
sense to me.

1176
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:27,598
And I'm really
starting to--

1177
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,151
What's going on?

1178
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:39,737
I cannot stop
thinking about it.

1179
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:45,451
I'm driving my car

1180
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:49,208
whatever, in the office,
in a meeting

1181
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:53,463
and I think about him
on top of her.

1182
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,888
The other night I had this dream.
I'd got him.

1183
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:11,647
I was beating
the life out of him.

1184
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:13,569
I was on top of him
and I was punching him

1185
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:15,112
and punching him
and his face was caving in

1186
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,986
there was blood
going everywhere

1187
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,066
and I could actually
taste it.

1188
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,949
I woke up, I found I'd actually
chewed the inside of my mouth.

1189
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,531
It's my own blood
I was tasting.

1190
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,908
What if they did catch him and they put him in jail him.
How would that make you feel?

1191
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,870
Good. Relieved.

1192
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,459
Angry.

1193
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,835
Why angry?

1194
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:35,462
Because I'd still
want to rip

1195
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,884
his fucking head off
and now I couldn't.

1196
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,212
What else are you
angry about?

1197
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:43,926
I'm angry I didn't know
what was going on.

1198
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:48,434
I'm angry that Annie
lied to me.

1199
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:53,861
That I didn't know the extent
of her intimacy with him.

1200
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:00,192
That I couldn't--

1201
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,032
What?

1202
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,954
Stop it?

1203
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:14,039
We can't control what happens
to us or our loved ones.

1204
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,965
What happens when Annie
goes to college?

1205
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,294
What are you saying?

1206
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,506
People get hurt.

1207
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,135
There's only
so much we can do

1208
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,512
to protect ourselves,
our children.

1209
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,013
The only thing
we can do

1210
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,720
is we can be there
for each other

1211
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:31,898
when we do fall down,
to pick each other up.

1212
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,514
[suspense music]

1213
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:37,539
[heavy breathing]

1214
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,215
[mud]

1215
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,917
Ugh!

1216
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,304
[gunshot]

1217
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,057
(man) Can I help you with
anything today, sir?

1218
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,775
(Peter)
Hey, Pop!

1219
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,281
(Will)
Hey.

1220
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,701
(Peter)
You look older.

1221
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:59,128
(Will) It's only been
six weeks, smart ass.

1222
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,796
(Peter) Yeah, still,
maybe it's, uh

1223
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:02,544
like Einstein's
special relativity.

1224
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:04,842
You know, six weeks to me,
five years to you.

1225
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,342
(Will) I think I preferred you
with a high school education.

1226
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:12,096
(Peter) Dude. No way.
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

1227
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,175
So how was
the ride in?

1228
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,602
Okay.

1229
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,099
Okay. I'm still
a little, ech.

1230
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,475
Oh. Big night, eh?

1231
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,557
I was off my face,
wasn't I?

1232
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,187
Come here.

1233
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,994
Jesus, Pop. What is it?

1234
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,534
(Aunt)
Where are the kids?

1235
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,120
(Lynn) Come on, kids.
Hurry up, the food 's gonna be cold.

1236
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:44,086
(Peter)
All right, ready?

1237
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,667
Hey!
[all laugh]

1238
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,627
[all clapping]

1239
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,964
it's fantastic.

1240
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,766
(Lynn) Look at the
toilet seat cover.

1241
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,720
It was her idea.

1242
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,305
Let me help you off with your
flippers so you can eat.

1243
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,810
(Kate)
No, Mom, that's cheating.

1244
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,016
That's not a very
scary mask, Pete.

1245
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,225
It is to Grandpa.

1246
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:04,310
Don't get
me started.

1247
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,986
He's a socialist.

1248
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,609
(Grandmother)
Oh, Cal, now come on.

1249
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:08,735
No costume, Annie?

1250
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,782
This is my costume.

1251
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,531
(Kate) You're not supposed
to wear a penguin

1252
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,032
you're supposed
to be a penguin.

1253
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,784
Do you want me
to come or not?

1254
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,410
Okay. I guess
you can come.

1255
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,788
[all chuckle]

1256
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:22,791
(Peter) I'm sorry I
didn't get to email much.

1257
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:24,338
You know, things
have been really crazy.

1258
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,415
It's no big deal.

1259
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:30,049
No. No, I should have called more.
Checked in a bit.

1260
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:34,007
You know I love you, right?
Right?

1261
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,933
(Grandmother) Did you
kids ever hear the story

1262
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,976
about when Grandpa and
I met on Halloween?

1263
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:39,770
He asked me to take
a picture of him

1264
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,815
next to this statue
of a werewolf

1265
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,563
They've all heard
the story, Susan.

1266
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:45,518
(Lynn)
No, no, we haven 't.

1267
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,568
Okay, good.

1268
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,112
So, he goes up

1269
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,734
and he stands
right under it

1270
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:52,192
trying to impress me,
of course.

1271
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,652
But it turns out it's just a
guy in a costume, right, hon?

1272
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,829
[chuckling]
And he grabs Grandpa.

1273
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,282
And Grandpa starts
screamin ' like a girl.

1274
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,493
- (Grandfather) I did not.
- (Grandmother) You did.

1275
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:05,125
[all chuckle]

1276
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,627
Annie, honey.
Is that corn cold?

1277
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,798
Because I could heat it
up for you, sweetie.

1278
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,922
Mm. it's fine.

1279
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:14,096
Annie, you have to try the sweet potatoes.
They are amazing.

1280
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:18,927
Oh, they are, sweetheart, they are.
Just, just have a little. You'll love 'em.

1281
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,603
You guys wanna cut
my steak, too?

1282
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,816
So, I hear you got
a girl, Pete.

1283
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,240
What? No.
No, God, no.

1284
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,317
No, it's just this girl
I met at a mixer.

1285
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,324
Yeah, she's a DG.

1286
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:40,122
But we 're not-- you know,
we 're just friends.

1287
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:43,451
She's super athletic though.
She plays tennis and lacrosse.

1288
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:44,285
You'd really like her.

1289
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,336
Cool.

1290
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:49,541
But, you know, she's, she's not
my girlfriend or anything.

1291
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:50,966
We just started
hanging out.

1292
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,759
(Grandfather)
Yeah.

1293
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:56,635
Peter, it's okay for you
to have a girlfriend.

1294
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,637
It's pretty normal.
Right, Dad?

1295
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:02,895
I'm not sure
I understand.

1296
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,393
You don't understand?

1297
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:07,770
Have you guys
had sex yet?

1298
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,851
Annie.

1299
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,732
Was she good?

1300
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,654
That's enough.

1301
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,277
(Annie)
What?

1302
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:19,032
You can tell everybody
about my life

1303
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:24,914
about me having sex and who
with, but I can't ask him?

1304
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:28,292
I asked you
not to tell him.

1305
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:31,465
That's the only
thing I asked.

1306
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,215
Thank you, Dad.

1307
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:40,050
I hope you guys
have an awesome time.

1308
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,100
(Lynn) Honey,
please, please stay.

1309
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:43,644
(Annie)
No. No. Let me go.

1310
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:50,935
(Doug)
Okay. Good news.

1311
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:52,520
We ran the DNA
from his shirt

1312
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,355
through the national database.

1313
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,440
And we actually
found a match.

1314
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:57,991
That's, that's incredible.

1315
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,660
So what happens now?
You arrest him?

1316
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,282
(Doug)
It's not that easy.

1317
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,535
While the DNA is
on the database

1318
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:06,037
it's still a John Doe- We
don't know who it belongs to.

1319
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,538
I don't
understand.

1320
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:09,211
Well, there were
other cases, Will

1321
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,380
three of them, where
rapes were reported.

1322
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,048
We were able to recover
genetic material

1323
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,796
from the victim
and the crime scene.

1324
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,923
The DNA profile
is the same.

1325
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,629
It's just that we don't know
who it belongs to.

1326
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,714
So he's done this before.

1327
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:23,096
- Yes, he has.
- (Lynn) Oh, my God.

1328
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,894
Well, he's had other girlfriends before.
I told you that.

1329
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,472
These weren't
girlfriends, Annie.

1330
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:28,806
These were minors
who reported a rape.

1331
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:31,187
Well, DNA can be wrong.

1332
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,897
The odds of these four samples
not coming from the same person

1333
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:38,779
are in the hundreds of millions.
It's the same guy.

1334
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,485
Now, look. We, uh, we
don't normally do this.

1335
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,286
We 're very careful
with victim information.

1336
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:44,989
But I'm hoping there
might be some kind

1337
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,495
of connection between
all four of you girls.

1338
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,497
Maybe you went to
the same camp together

1339
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,499
you shopped
at the same mall.

1340
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,296
I can't give you their names
but I was hoping that

1341
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,750
you might take a look
at their pictures.

1342
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,301
(Lynn) Wait a minute.
I don't know if this is a good idea.

1343
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,879
No, no. I want,
I want to. Yeah.

1344
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:03,182
All right, Annie, do
you know this girl?

1345
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,009
She's from Cleveland.

1346
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:06,514
She's fifteen years old.

1347
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:12,983
No.

1348
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,481
No? Okay.

1349
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:17,063
This is the Milwaukee case.

1350
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:20,195
This photo was taken
about a year ago.

1351
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:23,494
She's fourteen.

1352
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:28,666
Now, this girl was assaulted in St.
Louis seven months ago.

1353
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:34,123
She's twelve.

1354
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,831
(Lynn)
Oh, my God.

1355
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:43,385
(Annie) I don't, I
don't know them.

1356
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:47,890
(Doug) Okay. It's okay.
You did a good job.

1357
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,140
Thank you, Annie.

1358
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,846
Honey.

1359
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:53,307
(Annie) No. I'm fine.
I just need a second.

1360
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,688
So you're telling me the FBI's
been chasing this guy for years?

1361
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,271
It looks that way, yeah.

1362
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,989
Look, on the upside, Will there's
more information for us.

1363
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,946
There's more
evidence for us.

1364
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,248
The investigation is seeing
a real breakthrough.

1365
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:10,825
I bet the agent in St.
Louis said the same thing

1366
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:12,626
to some family
about seven months ago.

1367
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,294
I understand your
frustration, Will, I do

1368
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:15,792
but I'm working as hard
as I can for Annie.

1369
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,090
Yeah, but it's
not enough, is it?

1370
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,259
I mean, that sick fuck is still out
there grooming other girls, right?

1371
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:22,428
Will, I'm doing all I can.
I'm sorry you don't see it that way.

1372
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:25,598
(Lynn)
Annie? Annie!

1373
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,094
Did she come
down here?

1374
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:29,051
[suspense music]

1375
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,810
[horn honking]

1376
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:41,356
(Gail)
You okay?

1377
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:43,691
You want something
to drink? Water?

1378
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:45,321
There were other girls.

1379
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,948
What other girls?
Tell me what you mean.

1380
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:49,371
Charlie. He had
other girls.

1381
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:52,950
Three of them.
Like me.

1382
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,706
There were other
victims, you mean?

1383
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,503
He said that I
was special.

1384
01:21:56,578 --> 01:22:00,924
That I was the only
one for him.

1385
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,127
But if there are
other girls--

1386
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,884
They weren't even-- They
weren't even that pretty!

1387
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:06,930
Tell me why it matters.

1388
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,177
No. No. No.

1389
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,931
Why does that
matter?

1390
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:15,606
[sobbing] Because they
were just like me.

1391
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:20,403
He told me, he said
I was pretty.

1392
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:24,527
What's wrong with me?

1393
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,860
Why does it mean that
something 's wrong with you?

1394
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:33,575
If he lied to me the way he lied to
those other girls, he never loved me.

1395
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:37,707
He lied so he could
have sex with me.

1396
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,416
What, Annie?

1397
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,591
Oh, my God.

1398
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:51,429
He raped me.

1399
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:55,433
He, he raped me.

1400
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:01,148
How could I have
been so stupid?

1401
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,947
All he wanted-- My God.

1402
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,695
All he wanted was--

1403
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:13,281
God, I'm so sorry.

1404
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:42,605
(Lynn) Oh, God.
She's finally asleep.

1405
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,733
This guy is one sick fuck.

1406
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:52,821
Will, I'm so worried about her.
I've never seen her like this. I'm just--

1407
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:57,704
He's just destroyed her.
[sniffs]

1408
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,956
He sent her
a picture of his dick.

1409
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,344
Please stop looking at this shit!
[thud]

1410
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:10,966
What are you doing?

1411
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,140
What the f--
What are you doing?

1412
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:16,219
Why are you down here when you
should be up there with her?

1413
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,349
You think finding this guy
is more important

1414
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:20,476
that it's gonna make her better?
Do you think that--

1415
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:23,651
Well, it might. Or it might save
some other poor fucking girl.

1416
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:27,946
I want this guy out of my house.
I want him out of my house!

1417
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,149
You want me to go up there and
talk to her? I've tried.

1418
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,575
She won't fucking
talk to me!

1419
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,822
Shut up!

1420
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:35,996
She finally fell asleep.

1421
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:40,201
You'd fucking know that if
you were up there with her.

1422
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:44,460
It's Annie.
It's Annie.

1423
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:47,963
She is in pain.
She needs you and you're just--

1424
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:51,261
You're sitting there
doing nothing!

1425
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,727
All right.
[papers ruffling]

1426
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:08,525
Here, here you go.
[sniffs]

1427
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:36,223
(Coach)
Cameron!

1428
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:38,426
Look, Vicki's sick.
She can't play today.

1429
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,010
You're gonna start
in her place.

1430
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,265
I don't know, Coach. I--

1431
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:43,018
We need you, Annie.

1432
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:44,894
Can I count on you?

1433
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,477
Yeah.

1434
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,109
That's the spirit.

1435
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:52,360
(Coach)
At the net.

1436
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:53,611
[crowd cheering]

1437
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:54,691
(Kate)
Annie! Harder!

1438
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:04,285
(Brit)
Hey, guys. Hi, Lynn.

1439
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:05,335
(Lynn)
Hey.

1440
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,842
You having
fun? Yeah?

1441
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:16,798
Dig in!

1442
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,427
Nice Set!

1443
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:21,977
Block it!

1444
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:23,349
[suspense music]

1445
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,323
You having
a good time?

1446
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,204
Huh?

1447
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:46,785
You enjoying this, looking
at all the young girls?

1448
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:47,835
What's that?

1449
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:48,707
You sick fuck!

1450
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:53,884
(Will) I'll kill ya!
You fucking shit.

1451
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,929
(Will) You sick fucking cunt!
I'll kill ya!

1452
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:00,508
(Lynn)
Oh, my God!

1453
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:01,967
Dad, are you okay?

1454
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,677
(Coach)
What happened?

1455
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,182
(Lynn)
What are you doing?

1456
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:06,935
(Coach)
I'm calling the police.

1457
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,015
(man) Hey, hey, no,
no, there's no need

1458
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:10,772
it's, it's just
a misunderstanding.

1459
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,149
Dad, you're hurt.

1460
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:16,448
No, no. Pumpkin, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm sorry if I scared you, I'm okay.

1461
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,241
- (Coach) Are you sure?
- (man) Absolutely.

1462
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:19,943
It's just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

1463
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:22,575
[crowd clapping]

1464
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:26,917
(Coach) Okay, can we get the game
going again, please? [blows whistle]

1465
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,128
How could you
do that to me?

1466
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:31,546
I'm really sorry.

1467
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,919
You're sorry?
Gee, Dad, thanks.

1468
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,967
That makes everything
so much better.

1469
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,886
I lost my temper.
I don't know what else to say. I'm sorry.

1470
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:42,717
Don't you get it?
There 's nothing anybody can say.

1471
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,051
My life is ruined.

1472
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,136
No, it's not ruined.

1473
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:50,474
We're going through a tough time
but your life's not ruined.

1474
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:54,437
We're going through
a tough time?

1475
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,398
We didn't get raped.

1476
01:27:57,481 --> 01:28:01,736
We're not the laughingstock
of New Trier. I am!

1477
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:02,740
I got raped. Not you!

1478
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:04,821
I know that.

1479
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:09,786
Nothing 's ever gonna be the same.
I know that.

1480
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:16,547
But, please, can you please stop
reminding me of it every second?

1481
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:35,144
(Brit) Annie, wait!
I'm so sorry.

1482
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:38,067
(Annie) For what?
It's not your fault my dad's a psycho.

1483
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:42,652
What? No. I swear to God, I
had nothing to do with it.

1484
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,078
Wait, what are
you talking about?

1485
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,030
The Internet thing.

1486
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:49,036
What?

1487
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:50,537
Oh, uh--

1488
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:52,085
(Brit)
Annie!

1489
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,537
Annie!

1490
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:09,474
Cameron.

1491
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:13,307
Oh, my God.

1492
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:17,819
My God.

1493
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,083
[door opens]

1494
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,664
Hello?

1495
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:41,797
[steps]

1496
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,254
Lynn?

1497
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,422
[sizzling]

1498
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,409
[phone ringing]

1499
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:56,665
Hello?

1500
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:59,083
[Iynn, desperate] Will, where have you been?
I've been calling you.

1501
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:01,506
What, what do you mean?
I'm, I'm here. Where are you?

1502
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:02,753
On my way.
ls, is Annie there?

1503
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:04,709
No, I don't, why?

1504
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,887
Just-- Brittany called me-
Something 's happened.

1505
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:08,384
Is she there?

1506
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,841
What? Annie?
What, what happened?

1507
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:14,349
I-- don't-- just go check, please!
Call me back.

1508
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:16,554
Annie!

1509
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:19,186
Annie.

1510
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:23,486
Annie.

1511
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:25,188
[locked door]

1512
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:26,693
Annie, are you
in there?

1513
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:28,650
[rattles doorknob,
suspense music]

1514
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:31,361
Annie, open this door!

1515
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:33,913
[hits door]
Annie!

1516
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,585
Shit.

1517
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,541
(Lynn)
Will?

1518
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,422
(Will)
Call an ambulance!

1519
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,595
(Will) How many pills
have you taken?

1520
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,013
(Annie)
I'm not really--

1521
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:52,056
[screaming]
Call an ambulance!

1522
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:53,304
[sobbing]
Hello?

1523
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:55,226
Open your mouth.

1524
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:56,848
Open your mouth,
sweetheart.

1525
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:57,929
(Lynn)
We need, please--

1526
01:31:58,013 --> 01:31:59,731
[gags and coughs]

1527
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:00,773
(Lynn) She's taken
too many pills?

1528
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:01,816
Yeah. Come on.

1529
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:03,393
It's all right.

1530
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:05,274
[soft piano music,
no dialog]

1531
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,348
(Will)
She asleep?

1532
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,311
I'm through talking.

1533
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,690
Brittany's spending
the night.

1534
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:08,709
Good night.

1535
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:33,626
(Annie)
Dad?

1536
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:44,478
Dad.

1537
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:49,730
Are you okay?

1538
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:55,824
You remember the first
time you went in the pool?

1539
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:58,402
What?

1540
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:00,737
You probably don't.
You were two.

1541
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:04,791
Peter was scared to death
the first time he went in.

1542
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:09,372
He screamed and cried so
much, he didn't stop.

1543
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:13,254
He was fine in the
bath, but pool...

1544
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:19,051
Not you.

1545
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:22,009
You were fearless.

1546
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,641
I remember.

1547
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:29,733
You were amazing.

1548
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:33,186
Came in with me and almost
immediately started laughing

1549
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:36,273
and playing and
splashing around.

1550
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:41,237
You just had
this confidence.

1551
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,536
It wasn't just swimming.

1552
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:44,080
You just had this--

1553
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:49,002
trust--in things, people,
the world.

1554
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,205
It was who you were.

1555
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:55,341
No fear.

1556
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:03,891
God, I loved that.

1557
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:06,311
I was so proud of it.

1558
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:09,772
I envied it.

1559
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:16,230
And I was so afraid that you'd
lose it as you grew up.

1560
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:19,065
That confidence.
That faith.

1561
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:22,364
But you didn't.

1562
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:30,205
And then I failed you.

1563
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:36,879
It was my job to make
sure you didn't lose it.

1564
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:40,633
To keep you safe.

1565
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:43,591
What am I if I
can't protect you?

1566
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:51,143
And to see you lose
that confidence

1567
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:53,941
to see you
question yourself.

1568
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:58,938
That the idea would
even occur to you

1569
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:03,118
to want to hurt yourself.

1570
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:05,069
Or for you to think
for one minute

1571
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:07,656
that you weren't
as beautiful--

1572
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:24,882
I don't know if you can
ever forgive me, Annie.

1573
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:30,687
I really don't know
if you should.

1574
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:34,687
But I'm sorry.

1575
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:37,360
I'm so sorry.

1576
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:40,109
Dad. Daddy.

1577
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:46,152
I love you so much.

1578
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,366
Dad.

1579
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:11,682
(boy) Dad. Come on.
How much longer?

1580
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:14,184
(father) We just
got here, buddy.

1581
01:38:14,263 --> 01:38:16,140
Let's at least pick up some
stuff for the park. Okay?

1582
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:17,851
What a day.

1583
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:20,187
Susanna- Grab some
apples, will ya?

1584
01:38:20,269 --> 01:38:23,569
(boy) Hey, Dad.
Can I do it for awhile?

1585
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:26,276
Okay. Be careful,
all right, buddy?

1586
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:31,330
Well, hello.
How do I look?

1587
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:32,783
[boy, chuckling]
Goofy.

1588
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:34,458
Yeah. Probably so.

1589
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:36,332
(Tyler)
Mr. Weston!

1590
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:37,754
Hey, Tyler,
how's it going?

1591
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:38,876
I'm good. How
about yourself?

1592
01:38:38,955 --> 01:38:40,423
I'm good.

1593
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:41,841
Uh, Mom, Dad, this
is Mr. Weston.

1594
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,133
Hey, very nice
to meet you.

1595
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:44,586
He's my
physics teacher.

1596
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,421
Pleasure, pleasure.
Hey, Susanna.

1597
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:48,381
One of my
students, Tyler.

1598
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:50,933
Oh. Hi, Tyler. I'm Susanna.
Nice to meet you.

1599
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,100
(Weston)
My wife, Susanna.

1600
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,098
And I'm Jennifer.

1601
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:54,474
Hi, Jennifer.

1602
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:56,147
And this is
our boy, Mark.

1603
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:58,725
(Tyler) Hey, man.
How's it goin'?

1604
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,435
(Weston)

1605
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:01,986

1606
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:04,155
