1
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,405
In the days before the event,

2
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:56,554
he had the whole world
wondering if he would show up.

3
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,312
Plane after plane
waited on the runway

4
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:08,006
while he napped

5
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:10,483
or took walks
and ate sandwiches.

6
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:14,280
Henry Kissinger called

7
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:16,565
and asked him to go
for his country's honor.

8
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:21,554
Soon after arriving,

9
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:23,390
he offended the Icelanders

10
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:25,486
by calling their country
inadequate

11
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:27,669
because they had
no bowling alleys.

12
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,632
He complained
about the TV cameras,

13
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:32,986
about the lighting,

14
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,596
about the table and chairs,

15
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,218
and the contrast of
the squares on the board.

16
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:41,819
His hotel room, he said,
had too nice a view.

17
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,835
None of this had anything
to do with chess, of course...

18
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,444
Or maybe it did.

19
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:51,648
If he won,

20
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,734
he'd be the first American
world champion in history.

21
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:56,671
If he lost,

22
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:59,538
he'd just be another
patzer from Brooklyn.

23
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,693
On the 40th move
of the 21st game,

24
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,226
he countered
spassky's bishop to king-6

25
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:10,178
with a pawn to rook-4.

26
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:13,468
And it was all over.

27
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:17,913
He came home an American hero.

28
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:22,374
He bragged to the world
he'd beat the Russians.

29
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,429
He delivered.

30
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,956
He can now command the same money
as heavyweight prizefighters.

31
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,128
He was invited to dinner
by statesmen and kings.

32
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:41,886
Then Bobby Fischer made the most
original, unexpected move of all.

33
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,533
He disappeared.

34
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,417
Where is he?

35
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,443
Maybe he gave up.

36
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,845
Shh.

37
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,614
Do you see anything?

38
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:03,897
I think we lost him.

39
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,821
It's cold. Let's go home.

40
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,081
If he doesn't find us in two hours,

41
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:11,464
I say we go.

42
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:14,482
Hello, boys.

43
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:15,775
Aah!
Aah!

44
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,327
Theo, what are you doing here?

45
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,339
I thought you wanted to go home.

46
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,340
I have to buckle
my own shoes, right?

47
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,774
You said something

48
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,644
about rolling on your own
side of the board, right?

49
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,012
This is my side.

50
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,013
Remember that?

51
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,777
Roll it on your own side.

52
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,683
You talk too much.

53
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:12,698
You talk too much.

54
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:57,931
Josh?

55
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,001
Josh?

56
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,443
Your move.

57
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,878
Josh!

58
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,404
That's good.

59
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,517
Well, there you go.

60
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,145
Not too much, but that's good.

61
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,139
A little more.

62
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:43,850
Yeah. That's good.

63
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,130
You got to be careful
not to use it

64
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,302
too much, but you
want just enough.

65
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:50,575
A little more. That's great.
O.k.

66
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:55,630
That looks pretty good.
How's that look to you?

67
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,700
- Pretty good.
- Good.

68
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,474
Now rub that in there.

69
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,700
See how the leather
drinks that up?

70
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:05,572
That's got a great smell, huh?

71
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,900
Smell that.

72
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,013
Yeah. Great. O.K.

73
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:11,983
Now...

74
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:14,778
Ohh.

75
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,145
What's wrong?

76
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,604
I forgot to buy a ball.

77
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,401
Do you believe it?

78
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,643
You got to put a
ball in the pocket.

79
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:26,070
A hard ball...

80
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,163
To get the shape right.

81
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,263
Yeah.

82
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:37,831
That'll work.

83
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:38,865
O.k.

84
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,286
Put that in like that...

85
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,637
Bend that over.

86
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,439
All right.
Get in bed.

87
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:48,476
Tomorrow I buy a real baseball.

88
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:51,604
You know what?

89
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:54,265
I don't believe this.

90
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,951
I can't believe it.

91
00:06:57,196 --> 00:06:58,220
What?

92
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:00,431
You're 7.

93
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,460
Happy birthday.

94
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:10,087
Good night, Josh.

95
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:11,340
Good night.

96
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,240
Josh!

97
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,241
Bye.

98
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,843
How was school?

99
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,244
Good.

100
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,847
O.k. Bye.

101
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,849
Bye. See ya.
How you doing?

102
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:02,850
Fine. Bye.

103
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,151
Bye-bye. See ya.

104
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,221
Are you in the mood
for some pizza?

105
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,890
I don't know.
Are you?

106
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,992
Are you feeling all right?

107
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,061
Yeah. Why?

108
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,296
Where we going to get pizza?

109
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,800
You want to go watch
the men in the park?

110
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,235
What men in the park?

111
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,972
I'm going to smack
this guy's ass, man.

112
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,910
There's fire in the bush.

113
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,913
It ain't over.
We still got a minute.

114
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,315
When it slaps 12:00,
then it's over.

115
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,850
Then it's over.

116
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,290
We playing chess.

117
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,292
What we playing here?

118
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,960
We playing chess.

119
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,864
Now we playing chess.

120
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,833
Come on, Josh, let's go.

121
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,968
Is that the best you got?

122
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,970
That's the best you got?

123
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,205
You ain't got nothing.

124
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,007
You sure
you've played this game?

125
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,177
You want to go to Chinatown
and play Chinese checkers?

126
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,646
No, that ain't it.

127
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,047
You want that? O.K.

128
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,982
You can have that.

129
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,085
But you can't have that.
That's my baby.

130
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,687
You got to leave with that.

131
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,689
You can't trade queens with me.

132
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,357
I ain't in the trading business.

133
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,892
What you trying to do?

134
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,228
You're going to have
to do better than that.

135
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,663
That's kamran shirazi.

136
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,931
That's Kamran Shirazi.

137
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,567
That's kamran shirazi, man.

138
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,839
Shirazi!

139
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,106
The grandmaster's here.

140
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,108
You come to hustle the hustler.

141
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:39,212
Don't look at my clock.
My time is fine.

142
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,214
I want to go home.

143
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,683
Come and take my money.

144
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,618
Let's go, Josh.

145
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:47,020
Come on, grandmaster.
Show me something.

146
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,824
All right.
Check to his majesty.

147
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:52,626
No, no. Back up.

148
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,628
Check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

149
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,229
You can't have it.

150
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,865
Mmm. Hello?

151
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,700
That's right. Run.

152
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,968
Run.

153
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,870
Run.

154
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,271
Somebody call the police.

155
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,306
The man is loitering.

156
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,078
Excuse me, sir.

157
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,085
I noticed your sign.

158
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,187
Where is your camera?

159
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,891
No. My son would like to play
a game of chess with you.

160
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,464
Check.

161
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,421
Nyet. Nyet.

162
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,422
It's over.

163
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,157
You lose.

164
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,096
Thanks.

165
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,166
What's his name?

166
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,167
Josh.

167
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,201
Josh what?

168
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,070
Don't tell him, Waitzkin.

169
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,041
Josh Waitzkin.

170
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:57,144
I'm going to watch out
for you, Josh Waitzkin.

171
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,545
Tell these patzers

172
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,280
I watched you play
like Bobby Fischer.

173
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,882
Show them this.

174
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:06,920
Your boy used pieces in
combination to attack, lady.

175
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,288
Shut up, man.

176
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,423
Look what you did.

177
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,132
And here's the pitch.

178
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,434
A short grounder to second base.

179
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,036
Here's the throw.

180
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,271
And he got it.

181
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,306
Hey, babe.

182
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,540
Hi.

183
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:31,912
Hi.

184
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:32,913
Where's Josh?

185
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,915
He's over there.

186
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,083
Hey, Josh.

187
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,150
How's it going?

188
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,151
Eddie.

189
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,619
Come here.

190
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,288
Give me a hand.

191
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,324
What did I miss?

192
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,859
No score.

193
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,862
I took Josh to the park today.

194
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,497
He played chess.

195
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,566
Um...

196
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,569
Josh doesn't know
how to play chess.

197
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,606
Don't ask me how, but he does.

198
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,575
You going to write about
sports like your dad,

199
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,044
or you going to play?

200
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,046
I'll play second base
for the yanks.

201
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,482
Make that a four-game streak!

202
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,885
They could use a second baseman.

203
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,198
Careful.

204
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,199
Careful, careful.

205
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,935
Oh, here.

206
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,336
Hey...

207
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,038
Look what I found.

208
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,612
Want to play a game?

209
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,516
Why?

210
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,485
For fun.

211
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,924
Let's go to a dealership instead
and get some brochures.

212
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,660
Well, show him.

213
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,662
Your dad wants to see you play,

214
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,131
like with the men in the park.

215
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,366
Hey, it'll be fun.

216
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,302
Then we'll go to a dealership.

217
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,718
Now go easy on me.

218
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,254
It's been a while
since I've played.

219
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,692
Check.

220
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,308
Oh, uh...

221
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,010
Checkmate.

222
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:20,313
You see, I've got
you here and here.

223
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,714
See?

224
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,417
Can we go to the dealership now?

225
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,220
Sure.

226
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,356
Pee and get your coat.

227
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,327
Yeah, I know.

228
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,329
I should've let him win one.

229
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,564
I gave him every opportunity.

230
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,599
He wasn't trying to win.

231
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,200
Oh, no?

232
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,340
Come on, Bonnie.

233
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:49,294
It doesn't matter.

234
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,222
No.
Say what you mean.

235
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:54,255
You don't get it?

236
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:58,610
He doesn't want
to beat his daddy.

237
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,476
Dad.

238
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,728
She thinks you're
throwing the game.

239
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,434
You know what that means,
throwing the game?

240
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:13,700
No.

241
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,246
Well, this time, really try.

242
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:18,504
I was trying.

243
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,246
Well, I know you were,

244
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:24,090
but we're going to play one
more just for fun, o.K.?

245
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:26,340
Josh...

246
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,098
It's o.K. To beat him. You
won't hurt his feelings.

247
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,660
It's your move.

248
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,871
Your move, Josh!

249
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,550
I can't.

250
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:40,402
I'm playing chess with my dad.

251
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,730
Chess. It's a game,
like monopoly.

252
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:45,171
Josh!

253
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:47,132
Don't hang up.

254
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,276
Hi.

255
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,222
Your move, Josh!

256
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:19,457
Did you move that pawn?

257
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,876
I moved a pawn, yeah.

258
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:23,109
Yeah, that one.

259
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:25,121
Move my horse
in front of my king.

260
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,624
You mean your knight.

261
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:28,767
Yeah.

262
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,949
O.k.

263
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,395
He's going to lose his queen.

264
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,387
Oh, really?

265
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,055
Did you do it?

266
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,516
Yeah.

267
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,723
Can we go out now?

268
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,730
Well, the game's
not over yet, Josh.

269
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:52,652
Yes, it is.

270
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,020
Bobby Fischer was 6

271
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:07,988
when his mother moved the family

272
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:10,682
to a small apartment
near ebbets field.

273
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:12,960
At night,

274
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,213
when the traffic noise
died down,

275
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:18,624
you could hear the roar of
the crowd from the stadium.

276
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:23,346
His sister brought home
games to amuse him

277
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:25,907
while their mother was at work.

278
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,553
Monopoly...

279
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:30,257
Parcheesi...

280
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:32,397
Chess.

281
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:36,382
Even though
she was five years older,

282
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:39,046
she was soon no match for him.

283
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:41,708
It became more interesting

284
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,639
for him to play against himself.

285
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:48,163
He'd play both sides
of the board equally hard,

286
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:50,053
careful to be fair...

287
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,186
And he always won.

288
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,424
And up...

289
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,425
3...

290
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,293
4.

291
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,027
Now over.

292
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,629
Arms long, girls,

293
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:03,763
and down.

294
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,265
Let's go to the other side.

295
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,536
Long neck.

296
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,905
And plié.

297
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,707
And down.

298
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,581
3...

299
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,450
4. Very nice.

300
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:24,651
J'adoube.

301
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:25,725
What are you doing?

302
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,538
J'adoube.

303
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:28,335
J'adoube?
You moved the piece.

304
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:29,938
No, I adjusted the piece.

305
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:31,218
J'adoube.

306
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:33,444
No, you moved it,
then took it back.

307
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:34,683
No, I adjusted...

308
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,358
Who are you with again?

309
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,094
No, you picked up the piece...

310
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:40,421
The Hadassah chapter
on Staten island.

311
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,725
What did you have in mind?

312
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:46,585
Lecture? Exhibition?

313
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,608
I'm looking for
Bruce Pandolfini.

314
00:21:49,077 --> 00:21:50,960
What are you prepared to pay?

315
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,905
$30.

316
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:58,669
Do you know how much I'm accustomed
to getting for a lecture?

317
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,663
Want to play?

318
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:26,608
Can I have one of those?

319
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,092
Yes, I'll be there.

320
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,397
Yes, I... I'm agreeing to the $30.

321
00:22:52,178 --> 00:22:53,475
Yes, I have it.

322
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:55,563
Bye.

323
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,792
I work for a newspaper.
I wanted.

324
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,846
I don't know
where Bobby Fischer is.

325
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:22,621
I was talking to the guy who
writes the chess column.

326
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:26,199
He told me I could find
Bruce pandolfini here.

327
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,887
- I'm looking for a teacher for my son.
- I don't teach anymore.

328
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:33,098
He was sure that you did.

329
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:36,777
I don't.

330
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,973
Come on, Josh.

331
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,645
Just a second.

332
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:19,184
Thanks.

333
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,624
What was the score?

334
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:25,825
33 to 8.

335
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,227
33 to 8?
What did you do?

336
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,798
3 home runs, 3 triples,
and 2 singles.

337
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,634
I almost had 4 home runs,

338
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,335
but I slipped coming
home from third.

339
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,064
I ain't playing this game.

340
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,048
Oh, caught you looking.

341
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:43,976
You want some smoke?

342
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,845
Never play defensive.
Always attack.

343
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,193
- Even when you retreat, you attack. You understand?
- Yeah.

344
00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:51,377
There you go.
Now you're playing chess.

345
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:53,658
That's what I'm talking about.
Make him run.

346
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,517
Got me in trouble.
I'm on the run.

347
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,642
What can I do?
Where can I go?

348
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:58,805
Young Fischer.

349
00:25:58,838 --> 00:26:00,005
Come after me.

350
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:02,758
There you go.

351
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:04,361
Outstanding. Outstanding.

352
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,814
Nothing I can do.

353
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:08,916
I'm in major trouble,
major trouble.

354
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,728
I got big problems now.

355
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,086
What's this?

356
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,337
This goes like this.

357
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,998
- And this goes like this.
- Yes.

358
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:18,900
And this can go over pieces.

359
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:21,022
That piece should go over here.

360
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,353
And the pawn go.

361
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:25,885
And the pawns.

362
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,887
The pawns can take like this.

363
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,288
This is a pawn...

364
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,617
- You sneak in here again, Katya?
- Yeah.

365
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:34,132
Come on. It's way past your bedtime.

366
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:37,664
Say good night to your brother.

367
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:38,781
Good night.

368
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,618
There.

369
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,233
Mom?

370
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,261
Yeah?

371
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:50,093
Does Vinnie sleep in the park?

372
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,140
To be honest with you.
I have no idea where he lives.

373
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,084
Well, I was thinking...

374
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,788
Maybe he could sleep
in my top bunk instead.

375
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:04,913
Then when I get old enough to sleep
in it, he could sleep down here.

376
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,702
You have a good heart.

377
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:15,476
And that's the most important
thing in the world.

378
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:22,966
Good night.

379
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:24,362
Good night, mom.

380
00:27:57,065 --> 00:27:59,134
Glad you could make it.

381
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:06,849
So how's it going?

382
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,603
All right.

383
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:09,986
Great.

384
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:12,234
That's great.

385
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,812
So what do you think?

386
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:17,931
Have you ever been
to a tournament before?

387
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:18,656
No.

388
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:20,550
Ah. You're
in luck then.

389
00:28:20,677 --> 00:28:22,695
This is one of the
most prestigious.

390
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:26,531
The talent gathered here's the strongest
in the country. Everybody's here.

391
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:29,281
Joel Benjamin...
Former U.S. champion,

392
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:33,835
among the six highest-rated
players in the country.

393
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:40,594
The man in the corner's
Roman Dzindzichashvili.

394
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,822
Two-time U.S. champion.

395
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:46,570
A few years ago, he was ranked among
the top 10 players of the world.

396
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:55,364
Asa Hoffman.

397
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,613
He's the son of two lawyers.

398
00:28:57,643 --> 00:28:59,199
He grew up on park Avenue,

399
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:01,034
went to Columbia and Horace Mann

400
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:03,294
before dropping out
to play chess full-time.

401
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:06,425
He plays about 200 chess
tournaments a year.

402
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:07,664
Asa.

403
00:29:08,276 --> 00:29:09,343
Asa.

404
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,255
How much do you make at the
tournaments altogether...

405
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,675
About $2,000 a year?

406
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,670
Look at that. I got him thinking.
I got him thinking.

407
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,855
Maybe I can win a pawn.

408
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:34,213
Clearly, you had me come here

409
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:36,550
so I could see all this.

410
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:40,152
But if you really
wanted me to say no

411
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:41,745
to letting my son play,

412
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:43,374
you wouldn't have bothered.

413
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:48,818
You want me to think
you want me to say no,

414
00:29:49,726 --> 00:29:51,597
but you actually...

415
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:53,894
Want me to say yes.

416
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,784
You have no idea what I want.

417
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,331
What is chess, do you think?

418
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:07,393
Those who play for fun
or not at all,

419
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:09,545
dismiss it as a game.

420
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,902
The ones who devote their lives to it,
for the most part,

421
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:14,495
insist it is a science.
It's neither.

422
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:18,821
Bobby Fischer got underneath it

423
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:21,253
like no one before him and
found at its center...

424
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,990
Art.

425
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:27,003
I've spent my life
trying to play like him.

426
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:29,251
Most of these guys have.

427
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,691
But we're like forgers.

428
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:34,796
We're competent fakes.

429
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:40,279
His successor
wasn't here tonight.

430
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,602
He wasn't here.

431
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:49,509
He's asleep in his room
in your house.

432
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,169
Your son creates like Fischer.

433
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:57,181
He sees like him...

434
00:30:58,151 --> 00:30:59,392
Inside.

435
00:31:00,236 --> 00:31:01,293
You can tell that

436
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,392
by watching him play
some drunks in the park?

437
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:04,951
Yes!

438
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:10,853
You want to know what I want?

439
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:13,087
I'll tell you what I want.

440
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,816
I want back

441
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:18,657
what Bobby Fischer took with
him when he disappeared.

442
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:25,814
Yeah, look at that.

443
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:30,260
Oh!

444
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,063
You're his father.
It's your decision.

445
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
Josh.

446
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,508
I... I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine.

447
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,650
Hi, Josh.

448
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:01,292
This is Bruce.

449
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:02,528
Hi.

450
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,027
Well, I'll let you two, um...

451
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:09,516
I'll be downstairs.

452
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:53,745
I love water basketball.

453
00:32:54,354 --> 00:32:57,354
Well, supposedly, he used to,
uh, really be someone.

454
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,237
Some sort of, uh...
Master level...

455
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:02,721
Something or other.

456
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,464
Used to.

457
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,456
Well, yeah. Well,
he doesn't play anymore...

458
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,201
On the circuit...

459
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:12,964
Or... or whatever, um...
They call it.

460
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:16,888
Well, he's interesting.

461
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,374
All right, this is it.

462
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:39,385
Mr. Green
in the conservatory

463
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,878
with the candlestick.

464
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:47,390
Wrench.

465
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:52,044
♪ Frère Jacques ♪

466
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,366
♪ Frère Jacques ♪

467
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,568
♪ Dormez-vous?

468
00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:58,337
♪ Dormez-vous? ♪

469
00:33:58,888 --> 00:34:02,240
I need to talk to your dad a minute.
I'll see you next week, o.K.?

470
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:05,036
- I really had a great time, Josh.
- Me, too.

471
00:34:05,598 --> 00:34:07,246
- Bye.
- Bye.

472
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,349
The first lesson went
very well, I think.

473
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:12,708
Oh, good.

474
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:16,063
So, uh...

475
00:34:16,118 --> 00:34:17,568
Uh, were you guys...

476
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:18,885
Talking about...

477
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:20,443
Chess up there?

478
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:22,661
No, it didn't come up.

479
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,927
So I'll see you
next Saturday then?

480
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:30,693
Uh, right.

481
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:41,448
That's great.

482
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:45,226
So long.

483
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:52,169
How about some pac man
next week, Josh?

484
00:34:52,245 --> 00:34:53,396
Pac man and pizza.

485
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:54,083
Great.

486
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:55,187
O.k.

487
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,779
I'll see myself out.

488
00:34:58,108 --> 00:34:59,977
It was very nice meeting you.

489
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,509
Mate is four moves

490
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,583
from the position
in front of you.

491
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,794
Don't move until you figure
it out in your head.

492
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:18,599
Don't look to me for a hint.

493
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:22,350
I can't do it without
moving the pieces.

494
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:23,583
Yes, you can.

495
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,372
Clear the lines of men
in your head,

496
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:27,818
one at a time,

497
00:35:28,444 --> 00:35:30,813
and the king will
be left standing alone,

498
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:33,044
like a guy on a street corner.

499
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,193
Here, I'll make it
easier for you.

500
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:08,615
Knight to c8.

501
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:10,790
Good.

502
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:31,315
I want to show you
something else.

503
00:36:41,891 --> 00:36:43,510
This is very rare.

504
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:46,479
It says, "master
chess certificate...

505
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:48,127
Awarded to..."

506
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:51,104
And there's a blank here
for a name...

507
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:53,643
"For highest achievement

508
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,885
on this day of blank,
nineteen hundred and blank."

509
00:36:59,476 --> 00:37:00,783
Careful with it.

510
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:09,803
It's a mysterious
and powerful thing.

511
00:37:10,553 --> 00:37:12,577
It's only been given out...

512
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:15,288
I don't know...

513
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,694
A few times in history.

514
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:24,492
And then only to those who achieve
a lot of master-class points.

515
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:27,789
Then there's a big
ceremony and so on.

516
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:31,898
- How do you get master-class points?
- You earn them.

517
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,617
You just earned 10...

518
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:37,265
For that knight to c8.

519
00:37:37,843 --> 00:37:38,867
10.

520
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:40,664
10...

521
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,117
Master...

522
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,735
Class...

523
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:46,465
Points.

524
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:27,529
O.k., Josh, let's go!

525
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,386
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

526
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,454
Take two!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

527
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,424
Hi.

528
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:49,236
You're overdressed, Bruce.

529
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,598
Two, four, six, eight,

530
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:53,978
who do we appreciate?

531
00:38:54,061 --> 00:38:54,907
Eagles!

532
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:55,744
Eagles!

533
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:57,606
Yeah, eagles!

534
00:38:58,637 --> 00:38:59,814
O.k., yeah!

535
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:02,941
Nice game guys.

536
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:05,677
Let's get that equipment
in and head on out!

537
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:07,579
Good game, fellas.

538
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:15,451
Come on, Josh.

539
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,825
His chess ideas are like pieces of
his body he's reluctant to give up.

540
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:23,304
For instance, he simply
can't cope with being told

541
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,977
not to bring his queen out
too early in the game.

542
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,295
Why shouldn't he?

543
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:30,170
He's won many a game in Washington
square doing exactly that.

544
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:31,347
Why is this suddenly wrong?

545
00:39:31,706 --> 00:39:34,074
Try getting him to brush
his teeth sometime.

546
00:39:34,828 --> 00:39:37,632
What I'm trying to teach him
and what he's learning there

547
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:39,268
are two very different things.

548
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:41,881
Park hustlers play
tactics, not position.

549
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,310
They rely on wild,
unpredictable moves

550
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:46,836
meant to intimidate
their opponents.

551
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:49,980
Great in a two-minute
speed game for drug money,

552
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:52,514
but it'll cost Josh
dearly in real games.

553
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:56,027
Well, he's learning
some new words.

554
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,957
Could you keep him from
playing there so much?

555
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,532
Sure.

556
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,620
No.

557
00:40:06,257 --> 00:40:09,160
Not playing in the park
would kill him. He loves it.

558
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,495
Just makes my job harder.

559
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:15,128
Then your job's harder.

560
00:40:26,272 --> 00:40:27,679
What are you talking about?

561
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:29,469
We're already packed.
We're, like, out the door.

562
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,734
Make sure his laces are tight
if there's escalators.

563
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,300
I don't know why
I o.K.'d this anyway.

564
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,272
Well, you didn't.
He wants to do this.

565
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:38,124
I should've dissuaded him.

566
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,943
I grew up playing
in tournaments.

567
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,540
They have nothing to do
with what's important.

568
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:44,811
They're about all
winning and losing. So?

569
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:47,153
It's not chess.

570
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,580
Ah. Chess is art.

571
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,115
That's right.

572
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,918
No. Chess is you appreciate
the beauty of Josh's play

573
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,653
at 60 bucks an hour.

574
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,256
Will you be ready to go
in 30 minutes or not?

575
00:40:58,603 --> 00:40:59,709
He's not coming.

576
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:00,773
May I talk to him?

577
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,291
Hold on.

578
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,370
Josh!

579
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,130
I don't...

580
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,801
Telephone.

581
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:14,084
Hi.

582
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:16,322
Josh, how are you doing?
You excited?

583
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:17,389
Yeah.

584
00:41:17,694 --> 00:41:19,396
Listen, I can't make it.

585
00:41:19,492 --> 00:41:22,213
I've got some things
I have to take care of.

586
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:24,107
Hmm.

587
00:41:24,578 --> 00:41:25,578
That's o.K.

588
00:41:26,002 --> 00:41:28,541
I'll be thinking of you.
You'll do great, I know it.

589
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,002
And I'll see you
when you get back.

590
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:32,027
O.k.

591
00:41:32,431 --> 00:41:33,431
Bye.

592
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,940
O.k. Bye. Don't bring
your queen out too soon...

593
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,927
This is great.

594
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,701
Which one's yours?

595
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,420
Over there by the steps.

596
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:21,006
Oh. That...
That one's mine.

597
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:22,399
All right, yeah.
What?

598
00:42:22,447 --> 00:42:24,583
Looks like they're
friends already.

599
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:29,543
Uh, what's his rating?

600
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:38,474
15.

601
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:41,006
15 hundred?

602
00:42:42,821 --> 00:42:43,904
Yeah.

603
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,109
How old is he?

604
00:42:49,494 --> 00:42:50,494
7.

605
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:51,949
7.

606
00:42:53,857 --> 00:42:56,486
Well, I doubt that they'll
be playing each other then.

607
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:58,173
Morgan's not rated 1,000 yet.

608
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:59,647
Oh.

609
00:43:06,755 --> 00:43:08,190
15 hundred?

610
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,474
Questions during
the course of the game,

611
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,993
raise your hand.

612
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:19,064
He was cheating. He tried to
castle when I had him checked.

613
00:43:20,438 --> 00:43:23,485
O.k., I want to remind you
to conduct yourselves

614
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:25,221
like adults.

615
00:43:25,763 --> 00:43:27,665
I don't want any trouble.

616
00:43:28,112 --> 00:43:31,082
And you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

617
00:43:31,649 --> 00:43:33,571
If you're going
to watch the game,

618
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,546
do so from behind the player.

619
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:39,144
No throat noises.

620
00:43:40,468 --> 00:43:42,136
No comments.

621
00:43:43,282 --> 00:43:45,518
No eye contact.

622
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:48,593
Nobody cares if you're
guilty or not.

623
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,269
If you all behave yourselves,

624
00:43:51,887 --> 00:43:54,273
I think we'll all have
a very good time.

625
00:43:55,475 --> 00:43:56,943
I'm not kidding.

626
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:01,065
Listen, my son can't
play with these pieces.

627
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,359
My daughter needs her own clock.

628
00:44:06,899 --> 00:44:10,135
Oh, this is unfair.

629
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:11,999
Start...

630
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,644
Your clocks.

631
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,319
I did not pull on my ear!

632
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,321
You pulled on your ear!

633
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,958
I did not!
I scratched my ear!

634
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,960
You're a liar!
Break it up!

635
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:56,494
He's out of his mind!

636
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,796
Break it up!

637
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:59,197
I don't care!

638
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,132
Take your hands off me!

639
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:03,501
You're the one
who's trying to...

640
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,436
We just came to have fun.

641
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,143
I don't understand this.

642
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:08,497
Hey!

643
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:09,990
Hey, what... hey!

644
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:28,362
See, you can call me
the man of many signals.

645
00:45:28,864 --> 00:45:29,999
Many signals.

646
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,744
Knock it off, for Christ's sake.

647
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,770
I don't want to "knock it
off, for Christ's sake."

648
00:45:35,013 --> 00:45:36,698
I'm a man of many signals.

649
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,580
Yeah, I pull
my nose, my elbow...

650
00:45:40,316 --> 00:45:42,408
And whatever else
I want to pull.

651
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:47,963
You play the game fair.
That's the way it's played.

652
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:50,846
So... you see me
pulling my ear,

653
00:45:51,397 --> 00:45:52,931
it's not an itch.

654
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,056
You might think it's an
itch, but it's not an itch.

655
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:01,650
So watch for the subtleness.

656
00:46:02,571 --> 00:46:05,368
You're lucky you don't get
nervous at these things.

657
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:33,692
Hi.

658
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,194
If your son wins his game

659
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:37,929
and my son wins his,

660
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:40,716
they'll be playing each
other in the final round.

661
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:42,998
I can hardly wait.

662
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:45,396
Hey! It's only a game.

663
00:46:48,412 --> 00:46:50,341
I'm going to get myself
a tuna fish sandwich.

664
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:52,490
Can I get you a sandwich?
No, that's...

665
00:46:52,515 --> 00:46:55,117
I'm going to get you
a tuna fish sandwich.

666
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,303
Queen takes pawn.

667
00:47:24,401 --> 00:47:27,196
Josh is in trouble.
He's down another pawn.

668
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:33,395
Don't you believe it.
Your boy'll pull it out.

669
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,060
No, he's down too much material.

670
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:38,754
He's going to lose.

671
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:53,238
Knight takes rook.

672
00:47:57,865 --> 00:47:59,927
Petey just hung his rook!

673
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:06,782
He probably sacrificed
it for position.

674
00:48:07,272 --> 00:48:09,602
He's probably still
got the advantage.

675
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,110
It's over.

676
00:48:35,169 --> 00:48:36,349
Wha... d...

677
00:48:42,812 --> 00:48:44,413
Who won?

678
00:49:29,686 --> 00:49:32,497
In school,
before he dropped out,

679
00:49:33,227 --> 00:49:34,729
Bobby studied chess books

680
00:49:35,036 --> 00:49:37,560
while his teachers
taught other things.

681
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,630
When they told him
to put his books away,

682
00:49:41,714 --> 00:49:43,081
or took them away,

683
00:49:43,419 --> 00:49:45,021
he studied in his head.

684
00:49:46,591 --> 00:49:49,254
When a science report
came back to him once

685
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:51,622
with the words
"not satisfactory"

686
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,002
written across the top,

687
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:54,307
he wrote under it

688
00:49:54,854 --> 00:49:56,135
just as big,

689
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:58,182
"tough."

690
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,596
He was 14

691
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:04,948
and had already beaten the strongest
adult players in the country

692
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,297
to become the youngest
U.S. champion ever.

693
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:19,350
Welch is on the mound.
Now Casey signals.

694
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,127
He winds up...
The pitch!

695
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,287
Bye, mom.

696
00:50:31,312 --> 00:50:32,814
Have fun.

697
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:34,874
We'll call you
when we get there.

698
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:35,966
Bye!

699
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:44,742
There's your dad.

700
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:52,386
Yes!

701
00:50:52,597 --> 00:50:54,511
Look at this. Look at this.
See this?

702
00:50:54,536 --> 00:50:57,239
None of you patzers
ever won anything like this.

703
00:50:57,558 --> 00:51:00,060
Shut up. We're trying
to play a game.

704
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:01,370
He gets it,

705
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:02,737
throws to first...

706
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:05,330
Gets him!

707
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:06,683
And one out.

708
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:10,335
Thanks.

709
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:19,462
That's a high-15
instead of a high-5.

710
00:51:21,971 --> 00:51:24,322
I think we got it
in the bag now.

711
00:51:25,146 --> 00:51:26,580
Come on, Bruce!

712
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:29,224
All right.

713
00:51:39,368 --> 00:51:40,818
The windup and...

714
00:51:41,095 --> 00:51:42,229
The pitch!

715
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:45,092
Great.

716
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,308
He's out.

717
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,515
Oop!

718
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,142
And in first place...
Josh Waitzkin.

719
00:52:23,962 --> 00:52:24,962
Mr. Waitzkin?

720
00:52:25,491 --> 00:52:26,624
Oh, hi.
How you doing?

721
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:28,725
Hi. I'm so glad
you could make it.

722
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,397
Me, too. This
is really great.

723
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:33,918
Isn't it? The children
worked very hard on it.

724
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:36,921
I understand from Josh you
just got back from Washington.

725
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,140
I think that's super.

726
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:39,596
Yeah, it was great.

727
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:41,311
He told us all about the hotel.

728
00:52:41,336 --> 00:52:43,038
He was impressed with that.

729
00:52:43,763 --> 00:52:46,132
You've been taking him
a lot of places lately.

730
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:47,577
I think it's good.

731
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,814
It's important
for kids to travel.

732
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,421
It's a great education.
They start to realize

733
00:52:52,452 --> 00:52:55,422
there's more to the world
than Washington square.

734
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:59,677
Yes. He's been talking a lot
about Washington square, too.

735
00:52:59,702 --> 00:53:00,678
Uh...

736
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,247
Uh, let's see...

737
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,648
We've heard about hotels

738
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,706
in, uh, Syracuse, Philadelphia,

739
00:53:05,731 --> 00:53:06,699
Boston...

740
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:07,825
Washington now.

741
00:53:07,871 --> 00:53:09,816
That seems to be
all he can remember.

742
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,569
Not the white house

743
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,978
or the capitol building

744
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:14,580
or the Lincoln memorial.

745
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:17,262
And you're wondering
why that is.

746
00:53:18,511 --> 00:53:20,556
It's because I'm a rotten father.
You're right.

747
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:22,066
I drag him all over the country

748
00:53:22,091 --> 00:53:23,692
for my own selfish reasons.

749
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:26,637
Fred! Is Josh falling
behind in his schoolwork?

750
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:29,675
He is, but I'm more concerned
about other things...

751
00:53:30,029 --> 00:53:31,297
Like his friendships.

752
00:53:31,322 --> 00:53:32,891
There's a problem there?
Possibly.

753
00:53:33,112 --> 00:53:34,988
Well, is there or isn't there?

754
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:36,542
Mr. Waitzkin...

755
00:53:36,836 --> 00:53:38,971
I'm sure he's very good
at this chess thing,

756
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:40,965
but that isn't
really the issue...

757
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:41,990
Chess thing.

758
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:43,054
I'm sorry?

759
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:43,648
Chess thing.

760
00:53:43,673 --> 00:53:46,359
I'm sure he's good at
it, but I'm worried.

761
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,018
If I can make an analogy.

762
00:53:48,551 --> 00:53:49,836
If it was like, say...

763
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:51,430
Oh, I don't know...

764
00:53:52,334 --> 00:53:53,368
Um, cards,

765
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:54,565
pinochle.

766
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:55,566
Pinochle.

767
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,567
For instance.

768
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:57,070
Pinochle.

769
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,277
Fred...

770
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:01,213
Bonnie...

771
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:03,292
She's comparing chess
to pinochle.

772
00:54:03,317 --> 00:54:05,685
What am I supposed
to say to that?

773
00:54:06,351 --> 00:54:07,812
She's trying to make a point.

774
00:54:08,242 --> 00:54:09,429
Maybe we should listen.

775
00:54:10,468 --> 00:54:13,179
Vinnie thinks he's spending
too much time at it, too.

776
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,353
Vinnie? Vinnie's
a drug addict.

777
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:17,992
I'm supposed to listen
to his opinion, too?

778
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:20,343
I'm sorry, but your analogy

779
00:54:20,368 --> 00:54:21,851
is a very bad one.

780
00:54:21,955 --> 00:54:25,406
If you want to make a comparison
to something, have it make sense.

781
00:54:25,665 --> 00:54:27,828
Compare it to math
or music or art,

782
00:54:27,853 --> 00:54:31,804
because otherwise it
belittles him and it and me.

783
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:33,804
I don't mean to belittle you.

784
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:36,648
Oh, but you are, even the
way you're looking at me.

785
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:38,633
Mr. Waitzkin,
I think perhaps.

786
00:54:38,658 --> 00:54:41,961
I'll tell you how good he is.
He's better at this

787
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,816
than I've ever been
at anything in my life.

788
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,640
He's better at this than
you'll ever be at anything.

789
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,089
My son has a gift.

790
00:54:52,765 --> 00:54:55,453
He has a gift, and once
you acknowledge that,

791
00:54:55,538 --> 00:54:56,906
then maybe

792
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:59,898
we'll have something
to talk about.

793
00:55:01,901 --> 00:55:03,039
Josh.

794
00:55:04,186 --> 00:55:06,155
Chess is what it's called.

795
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,149
Not the "chess thing."

796
00:55:08,494 --> 00:55:09,662
Chess.

797
00:55:19,161 --> 00:55:20,327
What's its number?

798
00:55:20,352 --> 00:55:23,923
It doesn't have a number.
It's a private school.

799
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:26,827
Only the public schools
have numbers.

800
00:55:27,017 --> 00:55:28,523
It's called Dalton.

801
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,679
You can still see your
friends whenever you want.

802
00:55:34,704 --> 00:55:36,437
After school or on weekends,

803
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:39,390
when there's not a tournament.

804
00:55:43,476 --> 00:55:45,044
Your friend Morgan goes there.

805
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:46,343
Morgan goes there?

806
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,510
Oh, yeah.

807
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:50,534
He wouldn't go there unless
it was great, right?

808
00:55:50,856 --> 00:55:52,224
Ah, it's the best.

809
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:56,500
They, um,
even have a chess class.

810
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,968
What's the yard like?

811
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,586
The yard?

812
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:02,484
Do they have good stuff
to climb on?

813
00:56:02,522 --> 00:56:04,190
I'm sure it does.

814
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:06,648
Um, I haven't seen it, but

815
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:09,195
I'm sure it's great.

816
00:56:11,623 --> 00:56:13,601
So, um...
What do you think?

817
00:56:14,928 --> 00:56:17,328
If you say it's great,

818
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:19,664
then it has to be.

819
00:56:36,795 --> 00:56:38,463
It's a mistake.

820
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:53,143
What was wrong
with the old school?

821
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,475
I don't know.
I guess it was no good.

822
00:56:56,178 --> 00:56:57,615
And the new one's better?

823
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:00,303
They have a chess class?

824
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:02,389
They have a chess class.

825
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,586
Are you o.K.?

826
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,535
What the hell's
going on over there?

827
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:31,616
Bobby Fischer.

828
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:03,128
Young Fischer.

829
00:58:11,229 --> 00:58:12,430
Check.

830
00:58:13,434 --> 00:58:14,568
Check.

831
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,024
Trick or treat.

832
00:58:38,544 --> 00:58:40,544
Why is black better?
Take your time.

833
00:58:40,569 --> 00:58:42,333
White has more pawn islands.

834
00:58:42,546 --> 00:58:44,093
Which is white's weakest island?

835
00:58:44,305 --> 00:58:45,672
The isolated pawn.

836
00:58:45,714 --> 00:58:47,241
Only the king can save it.

837
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:49,679
That's right.

838
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:51,030
That's very good.

839
00:58:51,158 --> 00:58:53,761
You just earned
20 master-class points.

840
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:26,202
You studying up
on your end game, Bruce?

841
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:29,311
Josh,

842
00:59:29,431 --> 00:59:31,671
go get yourself a coke. We're through here.

843
00:59:33,513 --> 00:59:35,482
Get yourself a coke.

844
00:59:43,104 --> 00:59:44,479
What do you want?

845
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,533
Hello. How are you?
How have you been?

846
00:59:47,777 --> 00:59:49,026
How's your health?

847
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:51,677
Any one of these
would be appropriate.

848
00:59:55,942 --> 00:59:57,697
I want to join the club.

849
00:59:57,749 --> 01:00:00,719
Well, actually, not me, my
young friend Jonathan here.

850
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:09,501
I suggest you bring him
back in a couple of years.

851
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,209
We'd like an application,

852
01:00:12,492 --> 01:00:14,298
if it's not too much trouble.

853
01:00:52,325 --> 01:00:55,052
He's been my student
since he was 4 years old.

854
01:00:55,575 --> 01:00:57,615
His parents
have given him to me.

855
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:00,139
Does nothing but play chess.

856
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,290
No other interests.

857
01:01:02,816 --> 01:01:04,700
- He goes to school?
- Oh, no.

858
01:01:05,837 --> 01:01:08,106
Well, that's great. You
should be proud of yourself.

859
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:09,919
I am.

860
01:01:17,545 --> 01:01:20,282
You should watch him play.
He reminds me of you,

861
01:01:20,588 --> 01:01:21,865
only he never gives up.

862
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:22,396
Josh.

863
01:01:22,771 --> 01:01:24,536
It's not a part
of his character.

864
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:30,075
He's not going to
disappoint his teacher.

865
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:55,302
"And when he knew that the
cottage was entirely destroyed,

866
01:01:55,869 --> 01:01:59,440
"the monster screamed once
more in agony and hatred

867
01:01:59,755 --> 01:02:03,458
and retreated backward to
seek refuge in the woods."

868
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:09,357
Wow! Then it gets
really scary

869
01:02:09,638 --> 01:02:10,928
because they chase him

870
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:12,450
and light torches and stuff.

871
01:02:12,783 --> 01:02:15,404
So we'll get to that tomorrow.

872
01:02:16,756 --> 01:02:17,841
Good night, tiger.

873
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,002
Good night.

874
01:02:28,483 --> 01:02:29,550
Dad...

875
01:02:35,536 --> 01:02:38,012
Maybe we shouldn't go
to the state finals.

876
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,559
What are you talking about?

877
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,036
Of course we're going.

878
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:54,051
That's what we've worked
so hard for.

879
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:56,887
If I win...

880
01:03:01,508 --> 01:03:04,477
Everybody will say,
"well, of course he won.

881
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:07,152
He's a top-ranked player"

882
01:03:08,464 --> 01:03:10,270
but if I lose...

883
01:03:12,938 --> 01:03:14,773
You won't lose, Josh.

884
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,544
What if I do?

885
01:03:16,972 --> 01:03:18,129
You won't.

886
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:19,934
I'm afraid I might.

887
01:03:20,223 --> 01:03:23,294
Josh... they're afraid.

888
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,739
They're terrified of you.

889
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,689
Now you get some sleep.

890
01:03:44,273 --> 01:03:46,942
Maybe it's better
not to be the best.

891
01:03:51,847 --> 01:03:54,637
Then you can lose,
and it's o.K.

892
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:16,575
It took people a while
to realize he was really gone.

893
01:04:18,442 --> 01:04:20,426
He disappeared before.

894
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:22,551
Once for 18 months

895
01:04:22,741 --> 01:04:26,356
before the crushing defeat
of Petrosian in Belgrade.

896
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,919
But when he didn't show up
in Manila in '75

897
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:33,700
to defend his title,

898
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:37,411
they took it away from him and
gave it back to the Russians.

899
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:46,270
O.k., let's go.

900
01:04:46,804 --> 01:04:48,773
I'm standing here
with Fred Waitzkin.

901
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:50,038
I hope I pronounced that right.

902
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:52,239
Fred, what's it like
being a chess parent?

903
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,833
In my case, the hardest part

904
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:57,200
is keeping track
of my son's toy cars,

905
01:04:57,279 --> 01:05:00,649
making sure he eats something
other than French fries...

906
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:09,700
Hi.

907
01:05:12,062 --> 01:05:13,062
Hi.

908
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:15,430
Your son's the odds-on
favorite, I understand.

909
01:05:15,681 --> 01:05:17,898
He's rated number one
in his division, yes.

910
01:05:18,075 --> 01:05:20,758
So every other parent
in this room hates you.

911
01:05:21,513 --> 01:05:23,147
I'm just kidding, Fred.

912
01:05:27,403 --> 01:05:29,859
Thank you, sir. He can
go to his table now.

913
01:05:30,204 --> 01:05:31,272
Next, please.

914
01:06:03,355 --> 01:06:04,578
Oh, my god.

915
01:06:11,145 --> 01:06:12,363
That was quick.

916
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,349
I hate this part.

917
01:06:19,951 --> 01:06:20,982
What?

918
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:27,974
No.

919
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:58,515
Seven moves.

920
01:07:00,707 --> 01:07:02,176
Seven.

921
01:07:03,282 --> 01:07:07,877
How is it possible
to lose in seven moves?

922
01:07:12,053 --> 01:07:14,025
Maybe I don't really have it.

923
01:07:14,345 --> 01:07:16,134
Well, you know that's not true.

924
01:07:17,007 --> 01:07:18,374
That's not why this happened.

925
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:21,560
I don't understand
why this happened.

926
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:23,220
Why did this happen?

927
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,744
Well, think.

928
01:07:29,955 --> 01:07:31,557
Take your time.

929
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:36,087
Take more time than you took losing
to that patzer and figure it out.

930
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:38,580
Did you fall for a trap?

931
01:07:40,462 --> 01:07:42,626
Did you
bring your queen out early

932
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:46,212
even though Bruce warned you
time and again about that?

933
01:07:48,033 --> 01:07:49,916
Maybe he's just better than me.

934
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:53,658
No, don't tell me that kid's
better than you because he isn't.

935
01:08:07,145 --> 01:08:09,673
Why are you standing
so far away from me?

936
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:24,361
Come here.

937
01:08:31,913 --> 01:08:33,348
It's o.K.

938
01:08:36,562 --> 01:08:38,031
It's o.K.

939
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,551
I'm sorry.

940
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:47,971
For all his natural ability,
Bobby Fischer studied harder

941
01:08:48,266 --> 01:08:49,793
than any player who ever lived.

942
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:51,795
He woke up thinking about chess.

943
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:54,798
He went to bed thinking about it.
He dreamt about it.

944
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:57,735
Why? Isn't it enough
to be a natural?

945
01:08:58,852 --> 01:09:00,375
If you don't care about
winning, it's enough,

946
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,771
but he wanted to win.

947
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:03,469
He had to be champion,

948
01:09:03,985 --> 01:09:06,141
and in order to do that,
he had to work,

949
01:09:06,254 --> 01:09:08,024
which is what we're going to do.

950
01:09:08,049 --> 01:09:09,316
O.k.

951
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,359
All right.

952
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:13,336
Promise you won't
argue moves with me,

953
01:09:13,412 --> 01:09:15,586
no matter how much
you think you're right.

954
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:16,611
I promise.

955
01:09:16,672 --> 01:09:19,868
Everything I tell you
imagine is coming from him

956
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,441
because I know
every game he ever played,

957
01:09:22,685 --> 01:09:26,355
so, in effect, he's going to be
teaching you, and you'll become him.

958
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,380
Promise.

959
01:09:28,155 --> 01:09:29,160
All right.

960
01:09:30,673 --> 01:09:32,542
Some new rules.

961
01:09:33,972 --> 01:09:35,606
No more speed chess.

962
01:09:36,129 --> 01:09:39,035
I know you like it,
I know it's fun,

963
01:09:39,313 --> 01:09:40,681
but it's no good.

964
01:09:41,558 --> 01:09:43,566
It ruined Arbakov,
and it'll ruin you.

965
01:09:44,738 --> 01:09:47,121
And no more games
in Washington square.

966
01:09:47,146 --> 01:09:50,649
They're patzers, and they're
teaching you all the wrong things.

967
01:09:51,629 --> 01:09:53,043
They're not patzers.

968
01:09:53,473 --> 01:09:54,558
They're losers,

969
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:57,559
and unless you want to
end up just like them,

970
01:09:57,894 --> 01:09:59,129
you'll stay away.

971
01:10:00,277 --> 01:10:01,957
They're not patzers.

972
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:05,840
I mean it.

973
01:10:08,347 --> 01:10:09,415
Now...

974
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:18,163
Which one is you?

975
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,406
What do you mean?

976
01:10:21,398 --> 01:10:24,257
I mean, which one is you?

977
01:10:25,194 --> 01:10:27,264
None of them.
They're just pieces.

978
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,562
This is you.

979
01:10:49,116 --> 01:10:50,616
So what's your best move?

980
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,695
Rook to d1.

981
01:10:51,843 --> 01:10:53,327
What about taking on e5?

982
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:55,077
What about it?

983
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:57,702
You didn't consider it. You're
still not considering it.

984
01:10:57,751 --> 01:10:58,751
Sit up.

985
01:10:59,963 --> 01:11:02,070
I'm right. Rook to
d1 is the best move.

986
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,489
That’s not the point.
You didn't study the board.

987
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:07,319
You're moving before I know the answers.
Give me your book.

988
01:11:09,406 --> 01:11:10,140
Why?

989
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,491
Give me your book.

990
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,540
Why?

991
01:11:12,993 --> 01:11:15,463
You just lost some
master-class points, tiger.

992
01:11:16,176 --> 01:11:17,544
I can't lose points.

993
01:11:17,569 --> 01:11:20,882
No? You just lost some
more for arguing with me.

994
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:28,686
Fine, Tim, it's not enough.

995
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:29,679
What's happening?

996
01:11:29,704 --> 01:11:30,780
What's happening?

997
01:11:30,805 --> 01:11:33,952
I hear a whole lot of talk
and don't get much for it.

998
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,114
Ooh, it hurts!

999
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:43,385
Damn!

1000
01:11:46,419 --> 01:11:47,686
Damn!

1001
01:11:52,481 --> 01:11:54,983
Do you know what the
word contempt means?

1002
01:12:00,614 --> 01:12:04,228
It's to think of others
as being beneath you,

1003
01:12:04,755 --> 01:12:07,837
to be unworthy of being in
the same room with you.

1004
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,718
I don't feel that.

1005
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:17,194
Well, you better start.

1006
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,893
Because if you don't think it's a
part of winning, you're wrong.

1007
01:12:24,354 --> 01:12:26,697
You have to have contempt
for your opponents.

1008
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,089
You have to hate them.

1009
01:12:33,801 --> 01:12:35,236
But I don't.

1010
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:37,752
They hate you.

1011
01:12:43,803 --> 01:12:45,370
They hate you, Josh.

1012
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:51,401
I don't hate them.

1013
01:12:52,624 --> 01:12:55,596
Bobby Fischer held the
world in contempt.

1014
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:03,057
I'm not him.

1015
01:13:12,831 --> 01:13:14,600
You're telling me.

1016
01:13:16,807 --> 01:13:18,696
In the primary division,

1017
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:21,097
in first place with a
perfect six out of six.

1018
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,099
Jonathan Poe.

1019
01:13:27,297 --> 01:13:30,467
Let's give a round of applause
for all the winners.

1020
01:13:40,317 --> 01:13:41,892
It's white's move.

1021
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:50,923
Can we expect it any time soon?

1022
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:52,985
How many points is it worth?

1023
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:55,040
To make the opening move?

1024
01:13:55,349 --> 01:13:56,349
Yes.

1025
01:13:58,079 --> 01:13:59,290
Forget the points.

1026
01:13:59,569 --> 01:14:01,509
How much is it worth if I do it?

1027
01:14:01,694 --> 01:14:04,329
Do it for its own sake.

1028
01:14:04,505 --> 01:14:07,564
I want to know how close I am
to getting the certificate.

1029
01:14:08,052 --> 01:14:09,052
Forget that.

1030
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:10,592
I want to know.

1031
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:13,187
I don't know.
What do you mean?

1032
01:14:13,266 --> 01:14:14,600
I don't care.

1033
01:14:15,939 --> 01:14:17,509
I don't understand.

1034
01:14:17,952 --> 01:14:20,962
It's white's move.

1035
01:14:26,368 --> 01:14:27,888
I want the certificate.

1036
01:14:28,071 --> 01:14:29,679
You want the certificate?

1037
01:14:29,704 --> 01:14:31,650
You have to have
the certificate?

1038
01:14:31,716 --> 01:14:34,150
You won't move until you
get the certificate?

1039
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:35,288
You win.

1040
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,523
Here's your certificate.
Fill it out.

1041
01:14:41,452 --> 01:14:43,487
Doesn't mean anything.
It's a piece of paper.

1042
01:14:43,536 --> 01:14:46,478
It's a xerox of a piece of paper.
Do you want another one?

1043
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:49,290
Do you want 10?

1044
01:14:52,782 --> 01:14:54,284
You want 20?

1045
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:56,462
30?

1046
01:14:56,823 --> 01:14:59,376
I've got a briefcase full of them.
They mean nothing.

1047
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:07,103
They mean nothing.

1048
01:15:13,324 --> 01:15:15,040
Get out of my house.

1049
01:15:34,923 --> 01:15:37,233
To put a child in a position
to care about winning

1050
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:40,540
and not to prepare him is wrong.
- Get out of my house.

1051
01:15:59,738 --> 01:16:02,750
Look, I know you don't want
to admit it, but he's right.

1052
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:06,970
I mean, you wouldn't sign
your kid up for little league

1053
01:16:07,223 --> 01:16:09,259
and then not get him a glove.

1054
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:10,407
You equip him.

1055
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:11,500
It's over.

1056
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:14,104
Bonnie, he's in a slump.

1057
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,168
This is a slump.
It happens.

1058
01:16:16,662 --> 01:16:18,631
When you get into a slump,

1059
01:16:18,656 --> 01:16:21,298
you get out of it eventually.
You don't give up.

1060
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:22,743
This is like baseball to you.

1061
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:26,150
If you're afraid to lose, you lose.
If you loose, you get more afraid.

1062
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:28,353
He's not afraid of losing.

1063
01:16:28,378 --> 01:16:30,423
He's afraid of losing your love.

1064
01:16:32,322 --> 01:16:33,782
How many ballplayers grow up

1065
01:16:33,807 --> 01:16:35,423
afraid of losing
their father's love

1066
01:16:35,448 --> 01:16:36,838
every time they come
up to the plate?

1067
01:16:36,862 --> 01:16:37,876
All of them!

1068
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:45,249
He knows you disapprove of him.

1069
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:48,022
He knows you think he's weak,

1070
01:16:48,381 --> 01:16:50,022
but he's not weak.

1071
01:16:51,266 --> 01:16:52,694
He's decent.

1072
01:16:53,911 --> 01:16:57,421
And if you or Bruce,
or anyone else

1073
01:16:57,687 --> 01:16:59,290
tries to beat that out of him,

1074
01:16:59,463 --> 01:17:01,796
I swear to god
I'll take him away.

1075
01:17:05,525 --> 01:17:07,921
When did you start to get
serious about chess?

1076
01:17:08,179 --> 01:17:10,682
Uh, I got serious, oh...

1077
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:15,665
Hmm, oh, well, I was always
pretty serious about it.

1078
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:18,247
You know, when I was maybe 7.

1079
01:17:21,925 --> 01:17:25,614
People say they've received
letters from him over the years,

1080
01:17:26,904 --> 01:17:28,762
but never show them.

1081
01:17:30,572 --> 01:17:32,607
They say he lost his nerve,

1082
01:17:33,294 --> 01:17:35,372
and he'll never play again.

1083
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,742
They say he lost his mind

1084
01:17:39,986 --> 01:17:42,567
and roams the streets
of Los Angeles

1085
01:17:43,055 --> 01:17:45,057
hiding out under assumed names.

1086
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:47,864
Check.

1087
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:48,865
Check.

1088
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:50,599
Some people say...

1089
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,601
He's dead.

1090
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:59,175
I think he's lying low
and getting stronger,

1091
01:17:59,944 --> 01:18:02,561
waiting for just the right
moment to come back

1092
01:18:03,316 --> 01:18:05,249
and reclaim his crown.

1093
01:18:33,076 --> 01:18:33,897
Hey, Josh.

1094
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:35,076
Shh.

1095
01:18:41,227 --> 01:18:43,324
What happened to your room?

1096
01:18:44,022 --> 01:18:45,791
I cleaned it.

1097
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,285
Hey, you know,

1098
01:18:54,448 --> 01:18:56,472
you don't have to
do this anymore.

1099
01:18:57,059 --> 01:18:59,886
You could give it up, and
that's all right with me.

1100
01:19:06,928 --> 01:19:08,329
In fact...

1101
01:19:10,596 --> 01:19:12,198
I want you to.

1102
01:19:14,404 --> 01:19:16,112
How can I do that?

1103
01:19:17,445 --> 01:19:19,573
What do you mean?
You just do it.

1104
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,159
But I have to win.

1105
01:19:27,066 --> 01:19:29,292
No, that's what I'm
saying, you don't.

1106
01:19:30,268 --> 01:19:32,018
But you told me I did.

1107
01:19:33,229 --> 01:19:36,307
Well, I'm telling you
now that you don't.

1108
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:39,018
But I do.

1109
01:19:39,672 --> 01:19:40,714
I do.

1110
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:43,181
Why?

1111
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:47,409
Because I have to.

1112
01:19:49,996 --> 01:19:51,030
Why?

1113
01:19:51,431 --> 01:19:53,127
It doesn't mean anything.

1114
01:19:53,746 --> 01:19:55,675
It's just a game.

1115
01:19:58,561 --> 01:19:59,948
No, it isn't.

1116
01:20:52,484 --> 01:20:53,807
Good morning.

1117
01:21:00,212 --> 01:21:02,014
These belong to you.

1118
01:21:33,023 --> 01:21:34,409
Want to play?

1119
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,238
Two minutes.

1120
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:49,305
What's that?

1121
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:50,573
Schleimann attack.

1122
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:52,375
Where'd you learn
that from, a book?

1123
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:53,977
My teacher taught me.

1124
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,946
Forget it. Play like you
used to from the gut.

1125
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,348
Get your pawns rolling
on the queen's side.

1126
01:21:59,382 --> 01:22:01,016
Put it out.
Josh is playing.

1127
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:04,019
He taught you how not to
lose, not how to win.

1128
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:07,313
You got to risk losing. You
got to risk everything.

1129
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:11,432
You got to go
to the edge of defeat.

1130
01:22:11,471 --> 01:22:13,167
- But...
- But what? Play.

1131
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,917
Never play the board,
always the man.

1132
01:22:16,271 --> 01:22:19,284
You got to play the man
playing the board. Play me.

1133
01:22:19,339 --> 01:22:21,708
You have to beat me,
not the board.

1134
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,292
- You're not who I have to play.
- You're playing me now.

1135
01:22:24,331 --> 01:22:25,331
Come on, beat me.

1136
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:30,645
Better.

1137
01:22:31,771 --> 01:22:33,305
All right.

1138
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,698
Better! Yes!
Come on, move.

1139
01:22:37,003 --> 01:22:38,054
Good!

1140
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:39,087
Yeah!

1141
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:40,878
All right!

1142
01:22:41,102 --> 01:22:42,437
Better!

1143
01:22:43,026 --> 01:22:44,026
Yeah!

1144
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:47,088
Good move!

1145
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:48,208
Yeah!

1146
01:22:48,415 --> 01:22:49,799
Yeah! Uh-huh!

1147
01:22:50,794 --> 01:22:51,929
Yes!

1148
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:53,469
Move!

1149
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:56,105
Ooh, yeah!
Good, good, good! Move!

1150
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:57,773
Yeah, that's it!

1151
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,435
Ooh, good! Yeah!

1152
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:00,615
What's that?

1153
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:01,412
Mate.

1154
01:23:01,467 --> 01:23:02,801
Yeah.

1155
01:23:37,034 --> 01:23:38,169
How's it going?

1156
01:23:39,064 --> 01:23:39,771
All right.

1157
01:23:39,934 --> 01:23:41,102
How's Josh?

1158
01:23:41,354 --> 01:23:42,810
Well, he's good.
Sit down.

1159
01:23:42,936 --> 01:23:45,612
Still planning on going to
Chicago for the nationals?

1160
01:23:45,637 --> 01:23:46,705
Yeah.

1161
01:23:47,419 --> 01:23:49,165
I've seen you both at the park.

1162
01:23:49,425 --> 01:23:51,970
Yeah. We've been hanging
out there a lot.

1163
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:53,845
Think that's a good idea?

1164
01:23:55,589 --> 01:23:56,956
Yes, I do.

1165
01:23:58,392 --> 01:23:59,908
He's playing better than ever.

1166
01:24:00,352 --> 01:24:01,915
How would you know that?

1167
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:06,798
You're right.

1168
01:24:06,823 --> 01:24:08,204
I... I don't know.

1169
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:13,353
But what I do know is that
he likes playing again

1170
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:15,923
for the first time
in a long time.

1171
01:24:16,759 --> 01:24:19,033
I know you think
you're doing what's best,

1172
01:24:19,058 --> 01:24:22,634
but you're setting him up for the
biggest disappointment of his life.

1173
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:26,295
That other kid isn't spending
his afternoons riding bikes

1174
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:28,380
and playing pac man,
I can guarantee you that.

1175
01:24:28,405 --> 01:24:29,712
I'm doing the only thing

1176
01:24:29,766 --> 01:24:32,469
I know how to do for Josh.

1177
01:24:33,323 --> 01:24:35,384
I don't know what else to do.

1178
01:24:36,429 --> 01:24:38,400
Don't let him
go down there to lose.

1179
01:24:43,384 --> 01:24:45,238
That's what you can do for him.

1180
01:24:45,366 --> 01:24:46,868
You're his father.
Forbid it.

1181
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:49,493
I can't do that.

1182
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:50,184
Fred...

1183
01:24:50,439 --> 01:24:51,707
He's going to killed.

1184
01:24:52,154 --> 01:24:54,340
There's not going to be
much left of him.

1185
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:57,340
You have no idea what a fall
like this can do to you.

1186
01:24:59,897 --> 01:25:01,395
I think I do.

1187
01:25:08,028 --> 01:25:09,028
You know what?

1188
01:25:10,165 --> 01:25:11,903
You should come down with us.

1189
01:25:13,053 --> 01:25:15,558
It would mean a lot to
him to have you there.

1190
01:25:18,635 --> 01:25:20,231
That I can't do.

1191
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:45,934
There you go.

1192
01:25:45,959 --> 01:25:47,060
Thank you.

1193
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:48,710
Thanks.

1194
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:50,668
Come on, Katya.

1195
01:25:58,249 --> 01:26:00,592
O.k. That's not bad,
but that's not right, o.K.?

1196
01:26:00,617 --> 01:26:01,951
That's not what Casablanca did.

1197
01:26:02,351 --> 01:26:03,986
See?
You want to be patient.

1198
01:26:04,011 --> 01:26:04,967
Fools rush in.

1199
01:26:04,992 --> 01:26:06,944
You want to go to the 7th rank.

1200
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:08,495
Hi, Morgan.

1201
01:26:08,845 --> 01:26:10,401
Josh, where you been?

1202
01:26:11,437 --> 01:26:12,643
Fishing.

1203
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:15,479
Whoa. Look at this.

1204
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:19,729
No chess boards, no chess books.

1205
01:26:20,306 --> 01:26:23,475
I wasn't allowed to talk about
chess for two whole weeks.

1206
01:26:23,565 --> 01:26:24,901
Just fish.

1207
01:26:25,407 --> 01:26:26,408
Whoa.

1208
01:26:26,715 --> 01:26:28,354
It was my dad's idea.

1209
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:29,971
Hey, Kalev.

1210
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,080
How's it going?

1211
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:33,481
Fishing?

1212
01:26:34,357 --> 01:26:35,611
Sure.

1213
01:26:42,223 --> 01:26:45,135
The 200 young players finding
their seats behind me

1214
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,704
represent some
of the strongest chess minds

1215
01:26:47,729 --> 01:26:49,378
of any age in the country.

1216
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:52,113
Traveling from as far away
as Alaska and Hawaii,

1217
01:26:52,251 --> 01:26:54,887
they've come here to compete
against each other

1218
01:26:54,912 --> 01:26:57,730
over the course of the next
two long, grueling days.

1219
01:26:57,755 --> 01:26:58,966
To become champion,

1220
01:26:58,991 --> 01:27:00,960
one must win all seven games.

1221
01:27:01,423 --> 01:27:02,423
That's right.

1222
01:27:02,645 --> 01:27:04,520
This is Donovan Dennan,

1223
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,889
director of the national
scholastic championship.

1224
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:10,055
Tell me, is the next Bobby
Fischer somewhere in this room?

1225
01:27:11,269 --> 01:27:12,605
Hi, mom.

1226
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,391
This girl you're playing
is ranked 82nd.

1227
01:27:31,093 --> 01:27:32,561
All right.
Get through it quick,

1228
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:35,281
and you can rest before
the next round, o.K.?

1229
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:36,250
O.k.

1230
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:38,149
I'll see you in a little while.

1231
01:27:39,192 --> 01:27:40,192
Bye.

1232
01:27:40,271 --> 01:27:41,271
Bye.

1233
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:43,946
Josh...

1234
01:27:46,028 --> 01:27:47,028
Good luck.

1235
01:27:51,414 --> 01:27:55,579
Some of you may be unfamiliar
with sudden death rules.

1236
01:27:56,224 --> 01:28:00,494
If you're writing moves down
while a player gets down

1237
01:28:00,545 --> 01:28:04,787
to where there's less
than five minutes left,

1238
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:08,029
it's no longer
your responsibility to...

1239
01:28:08,843 --> 01:28:09,843
Hi.

1240
01:28:09,985 --> 01:28:11,037
Hi.

1241
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:12,459
Is that clear?

1242
01:28:13,051 --> 01:28:14,252
Good luck.

1243
01:28:14,433 --> 01:28:15,662
One more thing.

1244
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:18,301
If you have a problem...

1245
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:19,162
Morgan.

1246
01:28:19,222 --> 01:28:21,959
If you have a problem,
you don't have to discuss it

1247
01:28:22,278 --> 01:28:23,780
with your opponent.

1248
01:28:24,212 --> 01:28:26,914
All these people
with purple hats around here,

1249
01:28:26,939 --> 01:28:28,469
they'll be wandering around.

1250
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:31,649
Just put your hand up,
and they'll straighten it up.

1251
01:28:32,007 --> 01:28:34,196
O.k. Just hold up your hand,
and they'll see it.

1252
01:28:34,358 --> 01:28:37,352
Don't argue with your opponent.

1253
01:28:37,427 --> 01:28:38,628
That's ridiculous.

1254
01:28:39,106 --> 01:28:41,469
O.k. Good luck.

1255
01:28:41,546 --> 01:28:43,248
Start your clocks.

1256
01:30:34,406 --> 01:30:35,961
Can I come in?

1257
01:30:55,507 --> 01:30:57,016
How are you feeling?

1258
01:31:01,731 --> 01:31:03,533
Scared?

1259
01:31:05,027 --> 01:31:06,703
I can't beat him.

1260
01:31:09,247 --> 01:31:10,816
You might be right.

1261
01:31:12,016 --> 01:31:13,696
I'm not supposed to say that,

1262
01:31:14,251 --> 01:31:16,860
but you'd know I was lying
if I said anything else.

1263
01:31:22,714 --> 01:31:24,483
I have something for you.

1264
01:31:33,532 --> 01:31:34,782
It says,

1265
01:31:35,097 --> 01:31:40,649
"this is to certify that
Josh Waitzkin, on this day,

1266
01:31:41,051 --> 01:31:43,141
"has in the eyes
of his teacher...

1267
01:31:47,348 --> 01:31:50,016
Attained the rank
of grandmaster."

1268
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:22,407
I have never been so proud
of anyone in my life.

1269
01:32:27,802 --> 01:32:30,546
I'm honored to call myself
your teacher.

1270
01:32:41,602 --> 01:32:43,265
I'm so scared.

1271
01:32:44,701 --> 01:32:45,802
I know.

1272
01:32:59,336 --> 01:33:01,164
Will you stay until it's over?

1273
01:33:02,408 --> 01:33:03,961
Will I stay?

1274
01:33:07,821 --> 01:33:10,054
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1275
01:33:59,844 --> 01:34:01,367
It's unsettling, isn't it?

1276
01:34:02,586 --> 01:34:06,617
When you realize there are only so
many things you can teach a child.

1277
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:09,907
And finally...

1278
01:34:12,447 --> 01:34:13,891
They are who they are.

1279
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:19,507
Good luck.

1280
01:34:23,521 --> 01:34:24,610
Good luck.

1281
01:34:28,838 --> 01:34:30,118
Start your clocks.

1282
01:34:49,117 --> 01:34:51,345
What's happening? Why
isn't he moving?

1283
01:34:51,587 --> 01:34:52,961
Letting his time run.

1284
01:34:52,986 --> 01:34:54,681
Trying to psych Josh out.

1285
01:35:24,762 --> 01:35:25,762
Don't do it, Josh.

1286
01:35:25,856 --> 01:35:27,357
Don't even think about it.

1287
01:35:27,445 --> 01:35:28,714
Bring her out.

1288
01:35:30,798 --> 01:35:31,798
Keep her back.

1289
01:35:31,831 --> 01:35:33,066
Bring her out, Josh.

1290
01:35:38,609 --> 01:35:39,609
Oh, Jesus!

1291
01:35:39,648 --> 01:35:40,648
What?

1292
01:36:19,908 --> 01:36:20,908
Is it over?

1293
01:36:20,933 --> 01:36:22,696
Is it over?
He's setting him up.

1294
01:36:22,727 --> 01:36:24,266
Josh is setting him up now.

1295
01:36:24,765 --> 01:36:25,806
I taught him that.

1296
01:36:51,031 --> 01:36:52,299
Check.

1297
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:09,940
There it is!

1298
01:37:17,806 --> 01:37:19,442
Trick or treat.

1299
01:37:56,538 --> 01:37:58,306
That was a mistake.

1300
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:00,242
What was a mistake?

1301
01:38:00,610 --> 01:38:02,142
Who made a mistake?

1302
01:38:06,259 --> 01:38:07,615
Look deep, Josh.
It's there.

1303
01:38:07,649 --> 01:38:10,322
It's 12 moves away, but it's there.
You've got him.

1304
01:38:12,822 --> 01:38:14,197
Take his pawn with your pawn.

1305
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:17,330
G takes f6 forking
his bishop and rook.

1306
01:38:18,994 --> 01:38:20,759
Don't take back
with your bishop.

1307
01:38:20,784 --> 01:38:22,564
You'll need that to guard e7.

1308
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,009
He'll take back,

1309
01:38:26,034 --> 01:38:27,814
either with his bishop
or his knight.

1310
01:38:27,839 --> 01:38:31,728
When he does, this is the hard
part, sacrifice your rook.

1311
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:35,318
Capture him on f6
and get him to check.

1312
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:36,678
King has to take your rook.

1313
01:38:36,711 --> 01:38:37,509
He takes f6.

1314
01:38:37,534 --> 01:38:39,876
Give him the knight to check e7,

1315
01:38:40,034 --> 01:38:41,769
forking his king and his rook.

1316
01:38:42,015 --> 01:38:43,950
He'll move to safety.

1317
01:38:44,021 --> 01:38:45,657
King f5.

1318
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,869
Take his rook with your knight.

1319
01:38:47,894 --> 01:38:49,996
He'll take back with his king,

1320
01:38:50,021 --> 01:38:52,023
and you've got him.

1321
01:38:54,367 --> 01:38:56,095
Don't move until you see it.

1322
01:38:57,177 --> 01:38:58,339
I can't see it.

1323
01:39:00,102 --> 01:39:02,067
Don't move until you see it.

1324
01:39:03,025 --> 01:39:04,466
I can't see it.

1325
01:39:05,594 --> 01:39:07,239
Don't move until you see it.

1326
01:39:09,469 --> 01:39:10,888
I'm sorry, dad.

1327
01:39:14,157 --> 01:39:15,958
Here, I'll make it
easier for you.

1328
01:39:50,285 --> 01:39:51,469
He's got it.

1329
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,523
He's got it. He's got it.

1330
01:39:53,856 --> 01:39:55,539
How do you know he's got it?

1331
01:39:55,564 --> 01:39:56,773
He's got it.

1332
01:40:05,049 --> 01:40:06,246
What?

1333
01:40:10,983 --> 01:40:12,558
Come on, move.

1334
01:40:18,446 --> 01:40:20,410
What's that supposed to mean?

1335
01:40:20,637 --> 01:40:22,338
What's that supposed to mean?

1336
01:40:22,363 --> 01:40:23,996
He's offering him a draw.

1337
01:40:24,365 --> 01:40:26,367
I'm offering you a draw.

1338
01:40:26,721 --> 01:40:29,257
Draw? You've got
to be kidding.

1339
01:40:36,664 --> 01:40:37,664
You've lost.

1340
01:40:37,857 --> 01:40:39,441
You just don't know it.

1341
01:40:39,944 --> 01:40:41,212
I've lost?

1342
01:40:41,558 --> 01:40:43,127
Look at the board.

1343
01:40:43,848 --> 01:40:45,160
I have.

1344
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:49,871
Take the draw, and we'll
share the championship.

1345
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:56,652
Take the draw.

1346
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:06,050
Move.

1347
01:42:00,337 --> 01:42:01,582
Check.

1348
01:42:37,519 --> 01:42:38,586
Good game.

1349
01:42:55,497 --> 01:42:56,497
Yay!

1350
01:42:56,897 --> 01:42:58,932
Hey, you did good.

1351
01:42:58,957 --> 01:43:01,192
All right!

1352
01:43:14,556 --> 01:43:15,421
Yes!

1353
01:43:15,463 --> 01:43:17,023
Josh, my man.

1354
01:43:17,146 --> 01:43:18,480
All right! All right!

1355
01:43:18,607 --> 01:43:19,675
My man!

1356
01:43:24,916 --> 01:43:27,408
I'm so proud of you.
I knew you could do it.

1357
01:43:27,537 --> 01:43:30,907
I told you. I told you.

1358
01:43:33,861 --> 01:43:35,763
Bobby Fischer played
in Washington park, too.

1359
01:43:35,843 --> 01:43:37,206
See this? Look.
Josh Waitzkin.

1360
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:38,297
Morgan, what...

1361
01:43:38,424 --> 01:43:39,612
Morgan...

1362
01:43:40,748 --> 01:43:42,250
Will you come here?

1363
01:43:50,637 --> 01:43:52,694
I tried to give him a way out.

1364
01:43:54,837 --> 01:43:56,304
I know you did.

1365
01:44:06,002 --> 01:44:08,972
Why did you bring
the queen out so early?

1366
01:44:09,677 --> 01:44:11,291
You know what I'm saying?

1367
01:44:11,513 --> 01:44:13,190
You know what I'm saying?

1368
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:15,862
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1369
01:44:16,822 --> 01:44:18,384
Are you listening to me?

1370
01:44:21,453 --> 01:44:22,579
What happened?

1371
01:44:22,666 --> 01:44:23,634
I lost.

1372
01:44:23,659 --> 01:44:24,860
That's all.

1373
01:44:27,533 --> 01:44:29,251
What did your dad say?

1374
01:44:30,042 --> 01:44:32,251
"You should have
taken out your knight

1375
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,516
"instead of your queen.

1376
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:36,680
You took out your queen
too early."

1377
01:44:37,487 --> 01:44:39,149
I do that, too.

1378
01:44:41,877 --> 01:44:43,063
That's all he said?

1379
01:44:43,297 --> 01:44:44,618
Pretty much.

1380
01:44:48,401 --> 01:44:49,657
Morgan...

1381
01:44:52,256 --> 01:44:54,090
You want to know a secret?

1382
01:44:57,218 --> 01:44:59,201
I'm going to tell you a secret.

1383
01:45:03,215 --> 01:45:06,263
You're a much stronger player
than I was at your age.

1384
01:45:08,951 --> 01:45:10,263
Thanks.
