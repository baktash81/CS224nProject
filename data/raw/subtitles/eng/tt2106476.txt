1
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:20,188
They're going in!

2
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,273
Wait for me, damn it!

3
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,444
Come on, you're so damn slow!

4
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,364
Hop on the back, come on.

5
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,658
- Hurry, damn it!
- They bet 1200.

6
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:32,826
On what?

7
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:34,536
On who jumps in the lake first.

8
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:38,039
- Let's go!
- That can't be healthy.

9
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,876
Wow, this is cold!

10
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,503
Wait for me, damn it!

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,672
Come on, Johan!

12
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:48,800
Johan, you're looking good.
Come on. Get in there.

13
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:51,428
Hell no, I'm not getting in there!
I won't do it, man.

14
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:58,476
You can jump in yourself.
It's freezing cold, man.

15
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,357
I'm not going in, damn it!

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,748
Here it comes.
Shit, I have a cramp.

17
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,710
- Damn, it hurts!
- I'm coming.

18
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,296
Ah, it hurts.

19
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:32,093
Are you all right?

20
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,810
Theo, get him into
the recovery position, and then...

21
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:43,354
pump his chest a bit.

22
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:46,107
Don't fuck him.

23
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,987
Did you get a look at my eel traps?
Did I catch anything?

24
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,448
I want 600.
I came second.

25
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:55,283
There is hot toddy in the car.
Let's go, boys.

26
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,099
THE HUNT

27
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,442
There is something fishy
going on here.

28
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,528
Attack!

29
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:17,073
Is that you, Pelle?
Are you alone?

30
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,826
I got him.

31
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:23,121
- He is going down!
- Argh, there are so many of you!

32
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:26,791
Well, who is this?
Now I'm dangerous.

33
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,669
You're my new weapon, Pelle.
You're my new weapon.

34
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:32,088
There.

35
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,548
I have to go to the bathroom.

36
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,341
Just hang up
the outdoor clothes, all right?

37
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,176
I have to go to the bathroom.

38
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,595
- Number one or number two?
- Two.

39
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,138
Tell you what then...

40
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:42,098
we should get Lucas
to help you with that, okay?

41
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,475
Lucas, would you please
help him with that?

42
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,186
And remember,
all his clothes come off.

43
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,939
Is it a good idea to be jumping
if you're going in there?

44
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,828
- I'm done.
- That's good.

45
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,580
You can handle that yourself, can't you?

46
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:07,290
Hello? Wipe!

47
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,294
What kind of...
what kind of tone is that?

48
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,004
Come here.

49
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:17,383
And soap. Yes.

50
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,387
Come!

51
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,643
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

52
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,979
- Is something wrong?
- I'm lost.

53
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,358
Where are
your mom and dad?

54
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,401
At home.

55
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,946
I forgot to look where I was going,

56
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,781
and all of a sudden I was here.

57
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,201
Are you still not allowed
to step on the lines?

58
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:48,039
So you can't look up and down
at the same time?

59
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:51,167
No, and then I couldn't remember
which way I went.

60
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,836
That isn't good.

61
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,882
But you know what?
I remember where we live.

62
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:59,467
Why don't we go together?

63
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,304
I'll look up, and then you can
look down at the lines.

64
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:06,683
I would like to do that.

65
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,435
- Is Fanny coming too?
- She is coming too.

66
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:12,146
That's good,
then she can watch out for us.

67
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,902
What's your favorite dish?

68
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,530
Probably venison.

69
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:23,074
My favorite is fish fingers.

70
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:26,285
Why do you work
in our kindergarten?

71
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:29,998
Well, that's because I was a teacher
at your big brother's old school.

72
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,165
And then it closed.

73
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,583
Do you remember that?

74
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:38,506
My dad says that you are sad because
you live in a big house all alone.

75
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,051
Well, does he now?

76
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,512
You know what?
Cheer up.

77
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,681
Just keep your head high
and your feet on the ground.

78
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:50,476
If you are still sulking,
then you can have a kick in the butt.

79
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,189
Well, did your dad teach you that?

80
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,026
Then you can have
a kick in the butt.

81
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,320
Can I come over and walk Fanny?

82
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:03,990
As much as you want.

83
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:07,201
You just say the word.
You can try calling her.

84
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:10,621
- Fanny?
- No, much louder.

85
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,166
- Fanny?!
- Say, come here!

86
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,501
- Come here!
- Yeah, see!

87
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:16,669
Klara, where have you been?

88
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,046
She has been at the supermarket.

89
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,256
- Come on, Fanny!
- And then me and Fanny found her.

90
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,468
Sweetie, sweetie, haven't
I told you not to run away from home?

91
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,511
- Sorry.
- Coffee?

92
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,305
- Did you say coffee?
- Yes, I sure did.

93
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:28,973
- Fanny?
- Come on, you know the way.

94
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,101
- Come!
- Go to your room. Come on.

95
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,313
Take a look at what I found
out in the gutter, here.

96
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,690
- Hi, Lucas.
- Hi, Agnes.

97
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:41,194
Hi. Hi, Fanny.
Who's a good dog, huh?

98
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,029
Hi, honey.

99
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:45,656
You know, why haven't
you moved that yet?

100
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,867
You promised to get it out of here.

101
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,620
Do you also have your sporting gun
lying around the house like that?

102
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:52,205
My sporting gun.

103
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,831
Agnes, how often do I have to tell you?

104
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,375
It's a rifle.
This isn't a sport, all right!

105
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,377
Torsten?

106
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,922
- Torsten?!
- Yes, what?

107
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,256
Hey, little lady,

108
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,092
didn't you have something
to think about up in your room, huh?

109
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,928
All right, Torsten and I are
going to go buy some football shoes.

110
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:09,430
- You two keep your paws off that pie!
- We promise.

111
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,390
All right? I mean it.

112
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,310
It's in one piece when I get back.
Torsten, are you coming?

113
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,189
Drop by one of these days
for some dinner, will you?

114
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:19,857
- Next week?
- We'll make something nice.

115
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,651
- Yes, Wednesday. Lasagna.
- Yes.

116
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,778
- Lasagna.
- Come on, let's go, sweetie.

117
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:27,031
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Really, Torsten.

118
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,162
Shit, she'll be furious, man.
Damn, it's hot!

119
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,040
- The white things there can cover it.
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

120
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:37,625
I've got it.

121
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,585
How is it going
with Marcus and your ex

122
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,839
- and that whole mess?
- It's going well.

123
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,424
Yeah.

124
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,052
I can tell when you're lying, okay?

125
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,972
You do this thing with your eye, right?

126
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:53,641
- Sort of like a little twitch.
- I do?

127
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,102
So don't lie to me, Lucas, okay?

128
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:00,982
Okay. Well, she will still only let me
see him every other weekend.

129
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,610
Call Kirsten. Call Kirsten, all right?

130
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:07,113
And all that stuff
with the lawyers and all that shit...

131
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,699
Hey, Fanny, be quiet!

132
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:12,618
Then stop saying Kirsten over
and over. That's why. Stop it, Fanny!

133
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,328
You hear?

134
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,122
Do you miss Marcus?

135
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,957
Do I miss him?

136
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:20,585
Yes, of course I miss my boy.

137
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,004
Grab the phone, and then call Kirsten.

138
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:24,255
- Stop it!
- Hey, stop that now!

139
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:25,923
- Stop it. Lay down.
- Stupid dog.

140
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,509
- I said, lay down!
- You lay down now! Shut up, dog.

141
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:29,677
- Lay down.
- Lay down.

142
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,804
- Stop it, Fanny.
- Shame on you.

143
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,807
He is a bit upset that...

144
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,726
it is 12 days with you
and two with me,

145
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:38,436
and perhaps we could find
another solution?

146
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,229
I think it is working fine like this.

147
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:41,981
I don't see why
we have to do it differently.

148
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:45,443
Can I say something too?
Thank you.

149
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,154
He told me that he would like
to spend more time here.

150
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,364
And you had talked about it,
and you were very happy too,

151
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,491
because I have a job now,
and all is well.

152
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,827
Is that wrong,
the things he said, or not?

153
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,204
Lucas, you're 42 years old.

154
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,663
- You work in a kindergarten.
- Yes.

155
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,999
What do you expect him to say to you?
He feels sorry for you.

156
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,085
What? What did you say? He feels
sorry for me, or what are you saying?

157
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,338
Of course he does.
He feels sorry for you.

158
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,590
Try behaving a bit more like an adult
and listen to what I'm saying.

159
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,342
- You have to set yourself aside...
- That's not the reason.

160
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,135
For once. This isn't about you,
it's about the boy, damn it.

161
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,762
Well, that is what I am doing, damn it.

162
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,680
He was the one who asked me
about this, all right?

163
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,432
You can't even keep an agreement.

164
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,559
We have a clear agreement
that you are not

165
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,436
supposed to call me,
so don't call me.

166
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,898
All right, can I just ask you then,
when can we talk

167
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:26,150
if you don't call me,
and I'm not allowed to call you?

168
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,319
When can we talk then?

169
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,488
- I don't know. I can't answer that.
- What?

170
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:33,991
- I am hanging up now.
- No, when can we talk, Kirsten?

171
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,684
Hey, wait for me.

172
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,061
- Old rod, big rod. Ugly rod.
- No, no, no, no, no.

173
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,646
Crooked and wrinkly rod, man.

174
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:05,189
Rod, rod, roderoo, rod, rod.

175
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:06,857
Hey, Klara!

176
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,151
Look at this, Klara,
it points straight up in the air.

177
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,195
Hush... Come on,
let's go into my room.

178
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:15,241
Whoa, man! That's crazy, man.
Giant hooker rod.

179
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:22,415
I am so fucking tired. God damn it,
I do everything around here, man.

180
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,958
I make the lunches,
I wash the clothes.

181
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,584
- Good morning, Klara.
- Is anyone...

182
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,545
- Good morning.
- Listen to me.

183
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:31,966
You have to take her there.

184
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:35,094
Why can you never keep an agreement?

185
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,847
- We haven't agreed on shit!
- Are they arguing?

186
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,598
I have an appointment with Sten.

187
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,559
- We have to go and pick up...
- Are you upset?

188
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,436
No, he can just have
a kick in the butt.

189
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,855
We agreed last night.

190
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:47,898
You have to stop this, damn it!
If you can make kids,

191
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,151
you can damn well take
your kid to kindergarten too.

192
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:52,361
Do you want me
to take you to kindergarten?

193
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,196
I would like that.

194
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,868
- I'll just tell your dad.
- Yeah?

195
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,078
I'm standing just outside
and you're making a racket.

196
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,914
It's Agnes, she is completely
crazy. I can't find Klara anywhere.

197
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,166
Yeah, she is sitting right here.

198
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,834
Should I just take her with me?

199
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,627
Yeah, of course. Bye.

200
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:12,298
Yeah. That was okay with him.
Shall we go?

201
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:19,013
Shall we say that you'll look where
we're going, and I'll look at my lines?

202
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,265
Yes, let's do that.

203
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,188
You're all so weak. I will...

204
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,565
- Who will get to fly?
- One, two, three.

205
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,736
Oh, no. I'm not used to...

206
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,572
- Me too. Me too.
- Who is that now?

207
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,700
I need a break...

208
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,703
- Or else I'm dying.
- Me too. Me too.

209
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,748
- I'm dying, I'm dying.
- Me too. Me too. Me too.

210
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:33,421
Yay, tickle him.

211
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,382
- Tickle him.
- Wake up. Wake up, Lucas.

212
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:39,552
Tickle him.

213
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,095
Who is trying to wake the dead?

214
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:44,223
What?
Here comes the dead hand.

215
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,267
He is just pretending.

216
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:49,061
Okay... now...

217
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,022
All right, I think that is
time for fruit.

218
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,026
- Fruit is ready.
- We're coming.

219
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,903
And, boys,
you need to clean up first.

220
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,449
Klara? Klara? Come here.

221
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,787
There was a little present
in my coat pocket just now.

222
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,087
I think you should
give this to one of the boys.

223
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,070
It's not from me.

224
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,723
It says Klara on it though.

225
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,769
Then someone must be teasing you.
It's not from me.

226
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:35,065
Okay, but you know what?
I think you should give it to your mom,

227
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,568
or give it to the boy
who made it, okay?

228
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,820
And you shouldn't kiss
anyone on the mouth,

229
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,073
unless it's your dad or mom.

230
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,786
- It's not from me. You're lying.
- Klara.

231
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:51,081
It's not from me.

232
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,084
Klara?

233
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,712
That's it. Boys! Clean up now!

234
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,380
And then wash your hands.
Let's go.

235
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,424
- Do you mean it?
- Yes, I mean it.

236
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,593
Clean up how?

237
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,514
- Hi, Pelle. Hi, Janus.
- Hi, Grethe.

238
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,849
- I want to go home.
- Do you want to say goodbye

239
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,852
- And thank you for a good day?
- Come on, let's go home now.

240
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:18,859
Hi, little sweetie.
Are you still here?

241
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,112
Well, your mom will be here
in just a minute, all right?

242
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,367
Are you excited about Christmas?

243
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,746
Do you remember the carol?

244
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,998
Come on, let's sing it together.

245
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:37,211
<i>A child is born in Bethlehem</i>

246
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,713
<i>Bethlehem</i>

247
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,467
<i>Now joy is in Jerusal...</i>

248
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,219
I hate Lucas.

249
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,431
Oh, I thought you were
such good friends?

250
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:53,352
- We're not.
- Why not?

251
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:59,275
He is stupid, and he is ugly.

252
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:05,531
- And he has a penis.
- Well, most men do, don't they?

253
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,577
Your dad does,
and Torsten does, and...

254
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:17,209
But his points straight up
in the air like a...

255
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,670
like a rod.

256
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,674
Why do you say that?

257
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,802
Because it does.

258
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,141
Did something happen, Klara?

259
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:39,023
Yes, he gave me this heart,
but I don't want it.

260
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,944
Well, then...
That's not good.

261
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,655
Well, you'll just have to throw it away.

262
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,784
Do you think
Santa will come this year?

263
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:56,248
Well, yes you never...
never know.

264
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,499
I think he'll come.

265
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,586
Yes, if the kids have been good,
he'll probably come.

266
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:03,881
- Hi, Grethe.
- Hello.

267
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:05,716
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

268
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,178
Are you just sitting there
in the dark? Huh?

269
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:11,639
Aw, you know, I'm so sorry.

270
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,975
I have just been so busy all day.
I came as fast as I could.

271
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,436
Whew, did you have a good time?

272
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,148
Was there something
you wanted to say, or...?

273
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,441
No, no, we have...

274
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,193
We have been collecting
frogs and mushrooms

275
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,278
and animal turds out
in the woods today, haven't we?

276
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,947
Oh, that sounds lovely.

277
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,699
Come on, sweetie,
let's go home, shall we?

278
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,285
- Yes, take care, Klara.
- Bye, Grethe.

279
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,412
- Bye bye... Bye.
- Hi, sweetie.

280
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,999
Come on, my darling.

281
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:42,127
Now let's just hurry home

282
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,421
and make dinner, shall we?

283
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,473
Where are your gloves?

284
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,849
- Okay?
- Oh, dear.

285
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,393
Did Dad forget to pack your mittens?

286
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,396
- Grab your bag.
- Wow. That's a surprise.

287
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,815
I'm really thrilled about that.
But did something happen, or?

288
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,983
- Bye.
- I think this is really rough.

289
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,862
- See you. Come on, sweetie.
- Or did you just talk about it?

290
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,573
Yes, we did.
He wants to stay permanently with you.

291
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,867
There is nothing I can do.
He is yelling and screaming.

292
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,577
Listen, Kirsten.
This will be really good.

293
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,915
And I'll just take him to your place
as often as he wants, all right?

294
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,210
Are you okay?

295
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,340
You should talk to him.
I'll go and get him.

296
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:32,511
Oh, sorry.
I'll just go past here.

297
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,849
- Dad?
- Marcus! Great!

298
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,435
Yeah, it's great, but I can't
change schools until after Christmas.

299
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,520
Yeah, I know, but we'll figure it out.

300
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:44,231
I should go and see to Mom.
She's pretty devastated.

301
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,775
Okay, you do that.
And listen, Marcus?

302
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:49,069
Be nice to her, okay?
This isn't easy.

303
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,363
- Of course. Bye.
- Honey?

304
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,449
I love you.
I'll see you very soon.

305
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,041
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hi!

306
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,336
That was my son.

307
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,922
He's going to come
and live with me now.

308
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,257
Ah! Okay.

309
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,259
- That is great.
- Yes.

310
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:16,263
So maybe we should
have a cup of coffee to celebrate?

311
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,056
- Coffee.
- Coffee?

312
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:22,311
- Coffee.
- Coffee now? In here?

313
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,022
Yes.

314
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,857
Let's have some coffee then.

315
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,318
Do you take milk?

316
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:32,404
No, I like it black and strong.

317
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,323
But I make the coffee.

318
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,450
- No, no.
- Yes, yes.

319
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,786
I make the coffee,
and you do the dishes.

320
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,788
I do no more dishes today.

321
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,373
So that's it. Okay.

322
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,647
You can just do it like this.

323
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,398
- Easy!
- Oh, no.

324
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,567
It's better to do it like this.

325
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,737
Like this.

326
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,322
- Yes.
- Like that?

327
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,407
Yes, you're very good at this.

328
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,117
Thank you very much.

329
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,044
If I put the chairs up,
would you two clean up the playground?

330
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,421
Yes, we'll do that.

331
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,550
- Okay.
- Good?

332
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,426
Hey. Very good.

333
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,012
And, yeah,
so far I haven't found

334
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,474
any job that matches
my education or anything.

335
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,893
But hey, I like it here.

336
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,437
I like all the fresh air,

337
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,065
I like the kids,
I like all the nice people,

338
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,234
all the good-looking men.

339
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,528
Ah, okay.

340
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:58,866
Well...
But I'll see you tomorrow.

341
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,660
- Monday.
- Tomorrow.

342
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,872
No, I'll see you Monday,
because it's the weekend.

343
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,667
Yes...

344
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:12,671
I like when I see you.

345
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:16,633
Likewise.

346
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,930
Come here.

347
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,267
You're sweet.

348
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,855
You're cute.

349
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,482
Likewise.

350
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,110
- Can you even see the bread?
- All right, listen.

351
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,487
You know what? That was
the first time ever that I didn't...

352
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,323
- Yes, it is.
- That I didn't hit shit.

353
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,826
- It's definitely the first time.
- Let's do the song!

354
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,911
Maybe, maybe he has
a problem with his eyes.

355
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,455
Should we just... Should we try these
on? Maybe you should try these on?

356
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,834
Fuck off.

357
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,669
Cheers, everybody.

358
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:19,006
Why is the glass...

359
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,008
No, no, no, those aren't the rules.

360
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,845
Listen up,
I'll tell you how it's going to be.

361
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,264
I'll call and talk to Ulla.
You take...

362
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,558
- I'll do that too then!
- Yes, yes, you bring the roast pork.

363
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,768
Eel, black pudding.

364
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,229
Johan? Apple pork...

365
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,356
- Apple pork, apple pork.
- Why don't we drink some more?

366
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,650
And you'll bring
apple pork like you always do.

367
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:42,112
This is Lucas.

368
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,323
Hello?

369
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,328
All right, listen.
That is bullshit. I hit them...

370
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,040
I can't... I can't
hear anything. Wait a second.

371
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,375
Hello, this is Lucas.

372
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,128
Why do you never call me?

373
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,882
Sorry, what?

374
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,301
Why do you never call me?

375
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,597
Because I don't have your number.

376
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,933
Look on your phone.
It is on your display, right?

377
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,689
Yes, it is.

378
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,232
So call me.

379
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,703
Hello, it's Nadja.

380
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,914
- Yes, it's me.
- Who?

381
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,875
It's me.

382
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,212
What are you doing?

383
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,215
Nothing.

384
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,760
Okay.

385
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,303
And you?

386
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,555
Well, I'm...

387
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,808
Pussy! Pussy!

388
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,060
I'm at a meeting.

389
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:58,438
- Or, no, no, I'm not. I'm...
- In a meeting?

390
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,983
I'm really happy
you called me because, I...

391
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,279
I've been thinking about you a lot.

392
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,908
- So, should we meet?
- Yeah, I would love to meet.

393
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,828
I sure as hell hope it's coming.

394
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,454
Get those beers over here.

395
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,248
Where the hell are the beers?

396
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,501
What's up? Who were you just...

397
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:21,419
Who were you just calling, huh?

398
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,964
- We'll talk about that later.
- Was it a chick?

399
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,466
- It might have been.
- He was out calling...

400
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,177
- Stop it, stop it.
- I'm just trying to calmly and quietly

401
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,805
tell everyone that he was
just out calling a lady.

402
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,974
The least you could do is...

403
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:42,440
<i>Would Lucas, would Lucas,
would Lucas drink a beer?</i>

404
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,734
<i>Would Lucas, would Lucas</i>

405
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,570
- <i>Would Lucas drink a beer?</i>
- Yes, I actually would.

406
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:50,073
<i>Would Lucas, would Lucas,
would Lucas drink a beer?</i>

407
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:59,416
<i>And surely, and surely,
and surely he would!</i>

408
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,501
<i>And surely, and surely</i>

409
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,336
<i>And surely he would!</i>

410
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:06,464
<i>And surely, and surely,
and surely he would!</i>

411
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:07,674
I brought you a present.

412
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,551
- No, no, no, no, no. Come.
- Yes.

413
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,970
- It's not Christmas Eve.
- Yes, yes, I can get up.

414
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,222
- Yes, yes, yes, Lucas, I can get up.
- I'll help you a bit.

415
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,391
- I can get up.
- How much has he had to drink?

416
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,351
- I don't know. I didn't keep count.
- I can see that.

417
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,437
- I'll help you inside, come on.
- Yes, thanks a lot, Lucas.

418
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,230
- I'll just bring you inside.
- Lucas?

419
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:25,567
Yes? Yes? Yes?

420
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,485
I just talked to Agnes.

421
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,571
- You're my best friend.
- You got him?

422
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,406
- Yes, I think so.
- Yes, that's great.

423
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,325
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Kiss, okay... Kiss.

424
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,327
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

425
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,287
- Are you sure?
- Thank you so much for the help.

426
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,872
- No, damn...
- Okay. Are you sure?

427
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,540
- Yes.
- Okay, good. It has to stop.

428
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,500
I'll call you if there's trouble.
Get home safely.

429
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,586
Come on, honey, let's get you to bed.

430
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,463
Agnes?

431
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:52,010
So there is something
I need to tell you.

432
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,304
Do you know why you're beautiful?

433
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,598
- Do you know why you're beautiful?
- No.

434
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:00,060
It's because you don't know.

435
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,277
- You're sweet, honey.
- Agnes, I love you.

436
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,702
I love you...

437
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:20,080
I love you.

438
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,707
I love you so much.

439
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:24,251
Did you wait for a long time?

440
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,418
Yes.

441
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm sorry.

442
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,059
This is my dog, Fanny.

443
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,061
Hello.

444
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,980
This is my kitchen.

445
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,357
Do you want some coffee,
or you want some...

446
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,317
No.

447
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:53,822
Fanny! Fanny?
Fanny? Where are you?

448
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,118
- Where are you?
- Come here!

449
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,704
Thank you for the ball. Come here!

450
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,500
She could do this...

451
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,460
She did this
when she was one years old.

452
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,671
Fanny?
She wants to see it again.

453
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,548
- Okay.
- She wants to see it again.

454
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,883
Here we go.

455
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,762
And where does the dog sleep?

456
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,933
Downstairs.

457
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,686
- Good idea?
- Yeah, I'll throw the ball.

458
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:28,523
- You throw the ball.
- No problem.

459
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,735
Good.

460
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,945
So... okay.

461
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:36,114
So...

462
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,127
- Okay?
- Very okay.

463
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,628
- Can you see anything?
- I can see you.

464
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:55,008
- Don't strangle me, right?
- No, no, no, no, no.

465
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,772
- Socks? No socks?
- Socks!

466
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,454
Okay.

467
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:46,393
I scared you!
I got you! That was the first time!

468
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,607
- Help!
- I have to catch you.

469
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,323
- Lucas? Lucas?
- Hi!

470
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,992
- You can't get away from me.
- Could you come in here for a moment?

471
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,370
Yes, be right there.

472
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,456
Boys! I can't catch you.

473
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:12,585
But I'm going inside to drink
some super juice, and then I'll be back.

474
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:15,296
Hi, Grethe.

475
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:16,589
Lucas.

476
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:17,966
Come in and take a seat.

477
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,303
- How is little Marcus doing?
- It's going well.

478
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,140
He isn't so little anymore.
Time flies.

479
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,851
But yes, he, well, the plan is

480
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,103
that he will be moving
into my place just before Christmas.

481
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:35,066
I've been racking my brain, and I...

482
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,444
I just can't get it out of my head.

483
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:46,578
One of the children told me some things
that I have to talk to you about.

484
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,455
Yes, of course.

485
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,499
I know that this child has
a vivid imagination, but...

486
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,668
but I still wanted to
mention it to you.

487
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,713
Yes, yes, of course.
Who are we talking about?

488
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,592
Well, I can't tell you that.

489
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,267
The child told me that something
happened between the two of you,

490
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:12,479
which should normally
only happen between grown-ups.

491
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,526
What is that... What is it?
What has happened?

492
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:21,362
The child says that he/she

493
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:24,782
doesn't like you and...

494
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,535
that... well...

495
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:31,831
that he/she has seen
your private parts.

496
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:45,011
But how the hell
could that have happened?

497
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,430
Well, I don't know.

498
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,813
Shit.

499
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:01,444
Yes, this isn't good.

500
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,404
But stay calm.

501
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:06,699
I don't want to jump to any conclusions.
We'll figure this out.

502
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:12,789
What is it...
What exactly has been said, Grethe?

503
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,291
Well, I can't tell you.

504
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,420
It's fruit time anyway,
so I think I need to get going.

505
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,886
Perhaps it would be best if
you took a couple of days off, maybe?

506
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,597
Then we can sort this out
quietly and calmly.

507
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:33,810
Just finish your shift, and then,
then we'll figure it out.

508
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:36,229
- Yes... We will.
- Yes...

509
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,623
Hi, Grethe.

510
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,517
I hope you haven't waited long.

511
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,102
No, no, no, it's fine.

512
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,313
I'm a bit uncertain
about how this is done.

513
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,772
Yes, well...

514
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,611
But I just think we should get started
straight away, all right?

515
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,324
Well... Klara,

516
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,827
could you try and tell me

517
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:37,790
the same thing you told Grethe?

518
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:53,598
You need to be a good girl and...

519
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:57,685
and tell him what you told me
about the heart.

520
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,986
I didn't say anything.

521
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,074
Is it just something

522
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,369
Grethe is just making up?

523
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,415
Or is it perhaps something
you were making up?

524
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:22,710
- No.
- All right.

525
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:25,963
Then try and tell it to me too.

526
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:36,349
Yes. It's okay for you to tell us.

527
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,399
Was it something about you saying

528
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:48,903
that you had seen Lucas' penis?

529
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:06,170
See if you can tell me what Lucas did.

530
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:10,425
See if you can tell me
a bit about that, Klara.

531
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,178
I want to go outside and play.

532
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:17,306
But, you just have to answer, Klara.

533
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,392
Don't be scared.
I'm sitting right here.

534
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,894
I'm here for you.
Ole won't do anything to hurt you.

535
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,814
He just wants you
to tell us what happened.

536
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:31,529
Was it here in the kindergarten
that he showed you his penis?

537
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,034
Was it? Klara?

538
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,250
Klara?

539
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,098
You're nodding.

540
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,186
So it was here in the kindergarten.

541
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:11,527
Will you try and tell me
what else happened?

542
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:18,451
Grethe told me that you told her
that it was pointing.

543
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:22,789
Was it his penis that was pointing?

544
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,710
I think so.
I can't remember.

545
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:30,296
So he showed you his penis?

546
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,636
Klara?

547
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:40,932
Do you feel uncomfortable
talking about Lucas?

548
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,655
But it's because
you don't like what he did?

549
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,536
Klara, I think that you...

550
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,162
you're doing really well,

551
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:06,290
and you're very good
at answering my questions.

552
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:09,627
And we're almost done, okay?

553
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:13,923
What did he do afterwards,

554
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,843
when he showed you his penis?

555
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,345
I don't really know.

556
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,765
Did you touch it?

557
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,898
Do you remember...

558
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,776
whether...

559
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,780
something white came out of it?

560
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:50,126
Well, this might be a lot all at once.

561
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,587
You can go outside and play now.

562
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:56,173
- Can she do that?
- Oh yes,

563
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,301
if you just keep an eye on her,
it should be fine.

564
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,681
Yes...

565
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:09,645
So you and I know
each other well, Grethe,

566
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:10,980
and that's all well and good.

567
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:15,735
But actually this is
a matter for the police.

568
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:19,697
And, of course, we need the consent
of her parents first, all right?

569
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:22,033
I'm just grateful for your help.

570
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,952
I'm not sure how to handle
this kind of situation.

571
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,456
I also know that Klara has
a vivid imagination, but...

572
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:32,501
but, but, I don't think
that's the case here.

573
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,670
No.

574
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:37,173
It doesn't seem like it, does it?

575
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,925
No.

576
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,852
Ole says that we should prepare to...

577
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:52,063
to make this an official matter.

578
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:55,316
Contact the relevant authorities.

579
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,198
We should probably cancel
the parents' meeting tonight then.

580
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,116
No, no, I don't think so.

581
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,828
It's our duty to
inform the other parents.

582
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,248
Where is Klara now?

583
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,835
I saw her playing outside.

584
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:18,915
Where is Lucas?

585
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:22,134
I think he's outside too,
playing with some of the boys.

586
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,220
Shouldn't we send him home?

587
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,138
Yes, do that.

588
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:59,338
- Hello, Grethe.
- Hello. Hi, Torsten.

589
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:00,965
- Hi, Grethe.
- Yeah, we're in a hurry.

590
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,675
We were just on our way to
football practice, when you called me.

591
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,218
I hope you have time
to sit down for a moment.

592
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,429
Yeah, wasn't it at 7:00?

593
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,265
Are you all right?

594
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:10,641
Yes, but we're going
to talk about Klara.

595
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:12,184
Yes, that was it.

596
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,020
Perhaps Torsten had better
wait outside while we talk.

597
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,188
Yes.

598
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:21,152
Torsten, wake up, go outside
and send some texts out there, okay?

599
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,070
And play some games.
I'll be right there, okay?

600
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,825
So...

601
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,871
What has she done this time,
the little rascal?

602
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,416
Something may have happened

603
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,543
which isn't supposed to happen
between children and adults...

604
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,628
Or rather,
it most likely has happened...

605
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:43,382
And I haven't been able to prevent it,
and I'm deeply sorry for that.

606
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:48,095
Klara has recounted some
sexual details about an adult.

607
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,767
And I don't think children lie.
Not in that way.

608
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,852
That is...

609
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:58,230
It sounds very strange,
what you're telling me, Grethe...

610
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:01,692
What exactly are you saying?

611
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,820
I'm telling you that it looks
as if Klara has been

612
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:07,198
a victim of sexual abuse
here in the kindergarten.

613
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:11,577
And it looks like a person who is very
close to you has been involved in it.

614
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,498
Sexual abuse...

615
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,501
The things she said...

616
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,669
She will probably deny everything now

617
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,380
because she is scared
and embarrassed, but, well...

618
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,467
But, I mean, where...

619
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:29,553
How?

620
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,560
Let's wait and see how bad it is.

621
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,152
Hi, here's the cake!

622
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,696
Hey, you old archer.
All right, good to see you.

623
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,657
- Is it lactose-free?
- Yeah.

624
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:52,034
This looks good.

625
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:59,375
Long time no see.

626
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:02,002
Hi. Hi.

627
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,257
Hi.

628
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,134
Hi.

629
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,138
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

630
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:15,391
Yes, but could I just have
your attention for a moment,

631
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:18,727
because we have an extra item
on the agenda today.

632
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:24,483
Unfortunately we have reason
to believe that the children

633
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:29,029
have been subject to indecent conduct
here in the kindergarten.

634
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,660
Yes, it seems there is
an overwhelming likelihood

635
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,246
that one of the children has
been molested by an adult.

636
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:41,542
And, well, theoretically there might
be several cases of it.

637
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:50,926
There are lots of symptoms
of these types of violations,

638
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:53,345
which you can keep
an eye out for yourselves...

639
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:57,641
Bedwetting, headaches,
nightmares and such,

640
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:59,560
and we will be talking
a lot more about that tonight.

641
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,395
But I would like to ask you
to read this pamphlet,

642
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,772
which will tell you
much more about the subject.

643
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:07,776
What? Grethe, that is a very serious
accusation you're making.

644
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:11,530
Yes, yes. But there is
no need to panic, not right now.

645
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,533
Because we're following municipality
procedure in this matter to the letter.

646
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,410
Of course we are.

647
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,050
Good morning, Marcus.

648
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:33,552
Hello?

649
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:36,388
Hello?

650
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,141
Dad?

651
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:41,227
Why are you whispering?

652
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:45,689
They said I couldn't call you.

653
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:51,278
Who doesn't want me to call?
What... Why not?

654
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:54,865
What... Did something happen?

655
00:42:58,035 --> 00:42:59,995
Marcus, are you crying?

656
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,041
They are saying all kinds
of things about you.

657
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:08,587
That I can't talk to you or move.

658
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:11,173
Wait, calm down. Who is saying that?
Is your Mom saying that?

659
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:15,261
They called and said that you...

660
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:18,055
That all kinds of disgusting things
have happened in the kindergarten.

661
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:25,229
Don't listen to them, Marcus.
It isn't true.

662
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:31,735
- Who called you?
- Grethe from the kindergarten.

663
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:37,950
Son, listen...

664
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:40,577
Just go to school today
and I will call you later tonight, okay?

665
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,746
- And I will talk to your mom too.
- Okay.

666
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:47,042
Don't worry about this.
It's nothing. Okay, son?

667
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,134
It's because I don't, well...
I should have told you...

668
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:57,886
I'm sorry...

669
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:00,764
but yesterday...
I was told that one of the children

670
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:03,517
in the kindergarten
has said that he had...

671
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:07,313
That I had shown my penis
to him, or to her.

672
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,237
I'm sorry, but...

673
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:20,784
That is really far out.

674
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:22,578
Yes.

675
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:28,417
But now Marcus' mother
has been told too, so...

676
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,337
By whom?

677
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:37,259
Hi, Lucas.

678
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:43,932
- Hi.
- Hi.

679
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:49,063
Boys, not now.

680
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,524
Is Grethe here?

681
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,568
What are you doing here?

682
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,404
- I thought you were on leave?
- Yeah, I just need to...

683
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:04,536
What are you doing here?
What's going on?

684
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:08,374
I need to talk to you.

685
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,960
Yes, I'm in the middle
of something.

686
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,545
Okay.

687
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,052
I think you should go home, Lucas.

688
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:23,263
- And leave Grethe alone.
- Yes, but I just need to...

689
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,681
Grethe?

690
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:31,105
Grethe, come on.

691
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,899
Grethe, stop this.

692
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:35,859
Why are you leaving?

693
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:37,778
Really, Grethe, come on.
This is completely absurd.

694
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:40,155
You shouldn't come here
when I've asked you not to.

695
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:45,869
- I'm not doing anything.
- Stop! Stop right there.

696
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,080
How could you do something
like that?! You're sick!

697
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:50,416
How could...
What the hell did I do?

698
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,959
I... I think
it's very wrong that the two of us

699
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:53,419
are standing here together like this.

700
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:56,296
Let me...
Let me tell you what's wrong.

701
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:58,924
You've called Marcus' mother.

702
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:00,926
He should have been here today
and now he isn't allowed...

703
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:03,178
Because you called him.

704
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:05,639
What must he be thinking now?

705
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:08,142
I believe the children,
Lucas, I always have.

706
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,852
They don't lie.

707
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,605
You just leave Marcus alone, okay?

708
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,233
Don't bring my family
into this at all, do you understand?

709
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,485
You leave my children alone,
do you hear?

710
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:21,655
You must be sick!
Klara is an innocent little girl.

711
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:24,575
Is it Klara?

712
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:27,411
- Grethe, is it Klara?
- Yes, let's stop this now.

713
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:28,996
I'm just talking
to Grethe for a second, Johan.

714
00:46:29,163 --> 00:46:30,706
I think we should get you out of here.

715
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:33,750
- What did she tell you happened? Huh?
- I want you out of here.

716
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:36,044
It's my best friend's daughter.
You know that, don't you?

717
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,296
Yes, come on!

718
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:42,259
- You have to get out of here.
- Shit... It's Klara.

719
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:44,303
I guess I really need
to have a talk with Theo, huh?

720
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,888
- Yeah, yeah, come on.
- What?

721
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:49,475
- Easy now.
- What are you doing here?

722
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,019
Why is Ulla in the office, crying?

723
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:53,896
I think you need to leave now, Lucas.

724
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,689
- What the hell are you doing?
- That's enough.

725
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:57,733
- What the hell are you doing?!
- The two of us don't have

726
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,610
anything to talk about
ever again. Let's go.

727
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:01,361
Have you gone completely mad, or?

728
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:03,780
Yeah, maybe I have.
Get out.

729
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:05,616
Get out of here!

730
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:09,411
Come on, Lucas. Leave!

731
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:42,945
Hi, Theo.

732
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:46,073
I need to talk to you, I think.

733
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:51,703
Yes.

734
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:57,918
Okay.
They're asleep. Come in.

735
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:04,883
I'll just fetch something to drink.

736
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,490
I made some lemonade, so...

737
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:31,118
So if you want a bit to drink...

738
00:48:31,285 --> 00:48:34,371
So, you can just take some, here...

739
00:48:34,538 --> 00:48:36,373
Thank you.

740
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,417
So, listen...

741
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:41,253
We need to have a talk about this.

742
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,466
Yes.

743
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:52,556
What are they saying? Huh?

744
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:55,309
- You're asking me?
- Yes.

745
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:57,060
You need to ask
your daughter about that.

746
00:48:57,227 --> 00:48:59,021
I know nothing,
they don't tell me anything.

747
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:02,899
But it has blown completely
out of proportion.

748
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:06,987
So I thought that you and I, we...

749
00:49:07,154 --> 00:49:08,947
we'll sit down calmly,
find out what happened,

750
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:11,908
and then we'll have to go
to Grethe and... and...

751
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,828
Get this sorted out,
before all hell breaks loose.

752
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:27,299
You want me to ask Klara, huh?

753
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:29,885
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes, you must ask Klara.

754
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:31,970
Yes, yes, of course.
What do you mean?

755
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:35,849
Lucas...
I know my little girl

756
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:38,810
and she doesn't lie,
and she never has.

757
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,400
So why would she be lying now?

758
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:51,198
Well, I don't know why.

759
00:49:51,365 --> 00:49:54,076
But she is.

760
00:50:04,795 --> 00:50:07,297
Damn it, Lucas.

761
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:09,591
Theo, I haven't touched your daughter.

762
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:20,894
You know I haven't, don't you?

763
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:27,359
Do you believe what
I'm telling you, or don't you?

764
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,821
I don't know.

765
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,078
Theo, I haven't touched your daughter.

766
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:39,871
You don't honestly
believe that, damn it!

767
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,249
I don't know, Lucas.
I don't know.

768
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:44,876
Theo?

769
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:55,595
What is going on here?

770
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:57,806
What is he doing here?
He shouldn't be here!

771
00:50:57,973 --> 00:50:59,391
No, he probably shouldn't.

772
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,101
Lucas, you have to leave now.

773
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:03,061
Will you please tell me
what it is I've done?

774
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:05,397
- Get out of here!
- What is it you imagine has happened?

775
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:07,107
- Can you tell me that?
- Shut up!

776
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:09,151
- What did she tell you?
- You know what? Get out!

777
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,945
I'm not going to sit here and discuss
this with you. Get out of here!

778
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:15,407
Disgusting! You sure as hell can't sit
here on our sofa, man, in our house!

779
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:16,950
I don't want you
to ever come here again!

780
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:20,120
I'll cut your fucking
dick off, man! Get out!

781
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:24,374
Hey! Lucas!

782
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:28,962
- Are you crazy?
- If you touched my little girl,

783
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:32,299
I'll put a bullet right into your head!

784
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:35,343
And I think you have, because that's
what she's saying, isn't it?

785
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,472
Are you trying to ruin my life?

786
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:40,223
Are you trying to ruin
my life, is that it?

787
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,808
Come here. Look at me.

788
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:43,268
Look at me,
look me in the eyes. Come on.

789
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:44,895
What the hell are you doing, Theo?

790
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,024
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi, Lucas.

791
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:52,444
Klara, go to your room.

792
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:54,154
Agnes!

793
00:51:56,615 --> 00:51:58,492
Come on, honey. Come on.
We'll go to the living room.

794
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:04,206
Is Dad upset?

795
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:07,751
No, he'll cool down
in a second, all right?

796
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:09,920
You know he will. There.

797
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:12,214
The two of us will just sit here
for a bit and wake up.

798
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,550
Mom, are you mad at Lucas?

799
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:20,847
Let's just sit here
for a while, honey, okay?

800
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,059
He didn't do anything.

801
00:52:24,226 --> 00:52:26,478
It was just me,
I said something stupid.

802
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:29,481
And now everyone in the kindergarten
have started talking about it too.

803
00:52:29,648 --> 00:52:31,942
They say a lot of things.

804
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:40,450
Klara...

805
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:42,285
my sweetie!

806
00:52:44,788 --> 00:52:47,165
This is a bit difficult
to understand, but...

807
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:50,335
Maybe it's like this, that...

808
00:52:51,962 --> 00:52:54,881
Your head would rather not
remember what happened,

809
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:58,093
because it's not a very nice thing
to think about, but...

810
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,220
Klara, it did happen.

811
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,765
And that's why it's so good

812
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:05,934
that you've told us about it, okay?

813
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:09,563
Okay, honey?

814
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:16,278
Come on.

815
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:18,572
Let's try the Christmas cookies.

816
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,582
Yes, hello, Nadja.

817
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:30,667
Come on in and sit down.

818
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:35,797
Yeah, so...

819
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:43,430
Yes, you'll have heard
of this very sad case?

820
00:53:43,597 --> 00:53:47,183
We have reported it to the police.

821
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,146
Should I speak English?

822
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:52,355
No, it's okay.

823
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:56,192
We have informed the parents
about the symptoms of abuse,

824
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,987
and they have asked their children
whether they were

825
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:01,239
having any headaches
or nightmares...

826
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,700
Nightmares, you know?

827
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:05,577
Yes, and...

828
00:54:05,744 --> 00:54:09,122
There were several parents
who felt that they did have that,

829
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:12,167
they had symptoms,
and so we chose to act on it.

830
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:14,794
Why am I here?

831
00:54:19,758 --> 00:54:22,928
Are you seeing Lucas?

832
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:25,055
Is Lucas your boyfriend?

833
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:28,808
Yeah.

834
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:31,478
I'll try to say it in English.

835
00:54:31,645 --> 00:54:33,480
It is our duty

836
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:35,357
to inform the authorities

837
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:38,610
about such matters

838
00:54:38,777 --> 00:54:41,071
in a very serious case like this.

839
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:44,157
Okay? Why?

840
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:47,452
I don't think that anyone here

841
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:49,955
is any longer in doubt

842
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:53,124
about what Lucas has done.

843
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,459
Lucas has been walking

844
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:56,336
to and from
the kindergarten with Klara.

845
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:59,214
They've been seen together
all sorts of places.

846
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:02,133
He has been alone with the kids
right here in the kindergarten,

847
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,929
in the lavatories,
in the pillow room.

848
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:08,890
Kirsten, this is me again.
Will you please call me?

849
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:18,733
Hi, you've called Kirsten.
I can't answer the phone...

850
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,652
She isn't picking up.

851
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,737
Well, maybe she needs more time...

852
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:25,115
That might be so,
but I need to speak to Marcus now.

853
00:55:31,621 --> 00:55:34,332
Hi, you've called Kirsten.
I can't answer the phone...

854
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:36,710
What did they say in the kindergarten?

855
00:55:49,723 --> 00:55:51,266
Hi, Klara.

856
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,852
Hi.

857
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:00,191
What are you doing here?

858
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:03,987
I wanted to ask if I could
take Fanny for a walk.

859
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:07,949
Okay? Well, of course.

860
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,953
Does your mom know you're here?

861
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:21,046
I think you need to talk to your mom
before you come here.

862
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:31,139
They're saying that
you've been nasty to me.

863
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:46,196
Is that what you think too then?

864
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:52,327
I don't know.
I can't really remember.

865
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:02,670
What is it I'm supposed
to have done to you, sweetie?

866
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:05,548
I don't know.
I don't remember it anymore.

867
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:09,052
It's the others too.

868
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:15,433
The others?
Who are they?

869
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:20,313
Klara, who else?

870
00:57:21,773 --> 00:57:23,483
I'm scared.

871
00:57:27,946 --> 00:57:29,197
Okay.

872
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:33,409
Don't you just want to go home then?

873
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,998
What about Fanny?

874
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:41,209
Well, she is here all the time.

875
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:43,002
You can take her
for a walk some other time.

876
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:47,423
I think you better go home now, Klara.

877
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,691
Lucas?

878
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:08,653
Did you touch that girl?

879
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:11,865
What?

880
00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:17,620
You are not a sick person, are you?

881
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:24,002
Do you think I am?

882
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:27,797
No, I'm...

883
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:31,009
No, I'm... Well, I'm just...

884
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:33,469
I'm getting...
I'm getting...

885
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,140
- confused.
- What do you mean?

886
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:39,017
Nothing.

887
00:58:39,184 --> 00:58:40,393
Sorry. It doesn't matter.

888
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:47,442
Do you think I'm a sick person?

889
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,865
Do you think I'm a sick person?

890
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:01,164
No.

891
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:08,129
I think you should take
your things and leave now.

892
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:10,715
Hey, stop it!

893
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:12,008
Yes, just take your things and leave.

894
00:59:12,175 --> 00:59:14,052
- No, come on. I want you to leave now.
- Hey, hey, hey!

895
00:59:19,224 --> 00:59:21,684
Come on. Why are you doing this?

896
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:23,561
- Lucas?
- I've touched a child.

897
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:25,230
Isn't that what you're
telling me, you idiot, huh?

898
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:26,981
- Hey...
- It's what they're all saying.

899
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:30,902
Get out of here, get out, get out, out!

900
00:59:40,245 --> 00:59:42,080
You see, Klara, it's snowing.

901
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:45,625
Right on the elf.

902
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:46,834
Yeah.

903
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:57,679
This one...
This should be on the lake, right?

904
00:59:57,845 --> 01:00:01,474
Yes, it should. They're ice skating.

905
01:00:02,976 --> 01:00:05,270
Where is he going to sit?

906
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:07,397
That's up to you.

907
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:09,357
There.

908
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:14,737
Yes.

909
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:19,575
And we'll put this one here.

910
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:25,164
Then he can see everything.

911
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:36,175
Shouldn't he be with all the rest?
Down by the lake?

912
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:38,928
It's snowing!

913
01:00:40,138 --> 01:00:42,223
Come on, don't you want
to come out and see it?

914
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,309
- Yes, yes, I'm coming.
- Come on!

915
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,978
Wow, it's so pretty!

916
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,150
Be careful not to get too cold.

917
01:00:52,317 --> 01:00:54,944
There. There!

918
01:01:55,046 --> 01:01:56,506
Fanny.

919
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:25,076
- What the hell do you want, huh?
- What?

920
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:27,829
Marcus?

921
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:30,164
Marcus.

922
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:32,750
Shit, Marcus, is that you?

923
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:35,253
I'm sorry. Come here!
Come here!

924
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,506
- Christ, you scared me.
- Yes, and I really didn't mean to.

925
01:02:38,673 --> 01:02:41,217
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

926
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:45,471
Hi, Fanny. Old girl.

927
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:50,435
Should we go inside?

928
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:51,936
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Does your mom know you're here?

929
01:02:52,103 --> 01:02:55,815
Yeah, sure.
Where the hell is the key?

930
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:58,192
Oh yeah, the key,
I just lent it to someone else.

931
01:02:58,359 --> 01:02:59,694
I actually need to get it back.

932
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:01,112
Fanny, come! Come on!

933
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:04,365
- Are you hungry? Huh?
- Yes.

934
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:06,993
Fuck, this place looks like shit.

935
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,495
I can't believe you came.

936
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:11,747
Hey, stop that.

937
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:13,541
Stop it.

938
01:03:14,834 --> 01:03:16,377
Mom just said that it might

939
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:18,921
be a good idea
to stop by here and say hello.

940
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:21,048
Weren't you supposed
to be in school today, or what?

941
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:23,301
But I just took

942
01:03:23,468 --> 01:03:24,927
a few days off before
the Christmas holidays.

943
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:28,806
Oh, but, Marcus,
you do know that...

944
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:31,350
things aren't quite
as usual here at the moment, right?

945
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:33,227
I've been fired.

946
01:03:33,394 --> 01:03:36,063
The police have become involved,

947
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,859
and I call them 50 times a day, but they
aren't telling me a damn thing, so...

948
01:03:41,194 --> 01:03:42,820
So I'm going completely crazy.

949
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:48,159
Your mom doesn't know
you're here, does she?

950
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:55,333
Does she?

951
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,044
Fuck, man.

952
01:03:58,211 --> 01:04:00,880
I'm going to cry again.

953
01:04:10,932 --> 01:04:12,391
Do you want to talk about it?

954
01:04:12,558 --> 01:04:15,228
No, no.

955
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:20,399
It's okay.

956
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:22,360
- I'll pull myself together.
- It's okay.

957
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,111
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

958
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,280
It's so fucking ridiculous, man.

959
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:28,157
It's okay. Come here.

960
01:04:38,376 --> 01:04:40,127
Hi.

961
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:42,880
Hi. What the hell?

962
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:44,298
If it isn't my godson.

963
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:46,259
- Hi, Marcus!
- Hi.

964
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,135
Hi.

965
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,971
Aren't you too busy to come here?

966
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:52,974
The air feels a little dry in here.

967
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,518
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

968
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:02,858
- Did you talk to the police yesterday?
- Yeah.

969
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:04,694
And what did they say?

970
01:05:08,656 --> 01:05:10,908
They asked a lot of questions and...

971
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:12,535
it turns out that apparently

972
01:05:12,702 --> 01:05:15,079
I've touched some
of the other children too now.

973
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:18,791
- Bloody hell. That's just crazy.
- Completely.

974
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,919
But, damn it!
You haven't done anything!

975
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:27,425
But it's all of them now.

976
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:29,927
It's... It's Johan.
It's Bent, it's...

977
01:05:30,094 --> 01:05:33,264
They've all gone completely insane.

978
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:37,560
You've always put up
with way too much, Lucas,

979
01:05:37,727 --> 01:05:39,729
you know that,
I've always told you that.

980
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:42,064
Yes, but...

981
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:45,776
All right, Fanny.

982
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:48,029
Kirsten.

983
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:50,698
Yeah. It still works.

984
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:56,746
I don't really know.

985
01:05:58,372 --> 01:05:59,832
Lucas...

986
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:03,836
- Thank you, thank you.
- Okay?

987
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:06,631
Yeah, it'll be okay.
And now Marcus is here too, so...

988
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,591
Isn't he that guy
sitting over there who is neglecting

989
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:10,259
to pour his godfather a cup of coffee?

990
01:06:10,426 --> 01:06:12,136
What about your hunting
and rifle license?

991
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:14,096
- I'll be ready on October 16th.
- October 16th?

992
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:16,474
Holy shit! That'll be the day
when men become mice,

993
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:18,684
and mice become men.

994
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:27,360
Well, then call your mom
and tell her you're here.

995
01:06:28,444 --> 01:06:29,570
And Marcus...

996
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:30,863
if she flares up,

997
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,198
I'll put her in her place.

998
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:34,158
Okay.

999
01:06:55,846 --> 01:06:57,348
That'll be 269,50.

1000
01:06:57,515 --> 01:06:59,475
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1001
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:06,065
- And you get 30,50.
- Thank you.

1002
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:10,361
Hi, Marcus.

1003
01:07:11,654 --> 01:07:13,239
Your dad isn't with you today?

1004
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:16,492
- No.
- Could you tell him

1005
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:18,619
that I don't want him
shopping here anymore,

1006
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:20,621
and he shouldn't ask you
to do it either.

1007
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:25,459
- Why?
- You know why.

1008
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:27,253
There are other customers too,
all right?

1009
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,880
And I don't want you here.

1010
01:07:52,027 --> 01:07:54,363
- What's going on?
- Is that your son?

1011
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,115
Yes.

1012
01:07:59,994 --> 01:08:02,663
Could I just...
Son, listen to me.

1013
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,666
Go and call your mom, and tell her
to come and pick you up, okay?

1014
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,210
I've been arrested,
and I need to go with them now.

1015
01:08:08,377 --> 01:08:10,463
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

1016
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:13,048
- Get in there.
- Yes.

1017
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:15,009
- All the way to the other side.
- Yes.

1018
01:08:29,023 --> 01:08:30,733
Fuck, man.

1019
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:53,631
Hi? Hi, Marcus.

1020
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:55,925
You don't have an extra key
to our house, do you?

1021
01:08:57,593 --> 01:08:59,261
What?

1022
01:09:01,096 --> 01:09:02,431
A key?

1023
01:09:02,598 --> 01:09:04,183
I don't think
we have it any longer.

1024
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,227
Okay. I'll just be off again then.

1025
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:09,146
Hey, Marcus?
Are you okay?

1026
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:11,899
Yes.

1027
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:14,693
Okay. Listen...

1028
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:17,279
We know they've taken
your dad and all that.

1029
01:09:23,494 --> 01:09:26,330
Could I come in and talk to you?

1030
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:29,667
- What?
- Could I please talk to you?

1031
01:09:29,834 --> 01:09:32,461
Yes, but we...

1032
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:35,965
Yeah, come on in then.

1033
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:38,801
So are you hungry, or something?

1034
01:09:38,968 --> 01:09:40,803
You should just go in
and say hello to Marcus, all right?

1035
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,638
- Okay.
- Klara, could you please

1036
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:43,931
get out the mugs, honey?

1037
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:45,599
Hi, Marcus.

1038
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:47,893
Hi.

1039
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:53,649
So...

1040
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:54,817
I think the others are coming now.

1041
01:09:54,984 --> 01:09:56,318
- See you.
- Hi.

1042
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:58,320
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi.

1043
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:00,364
He is sitting in there,

1044
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:03,325
so we need to just...

1045
01:10:03,492 --> 01:10:05,411
Well, you can just put
your jackets over there.

1046
01:10:06,996 --> 01:10:09,957
Amazing...

1047
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,502
Marcus...

1048
01:10:14,962 --> 01:10:18,173
We'll drive you, if you want.

1049
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,427
Or call your mom.

1050
01:10:29,435 --> 01:10:31,103
Marcus, are you okay?

1051
01:10:32,688 --> 01:10:33,981
Are you okay?

1052
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:39,737
I just wanted to ask,
if you would help my dad?

1053
01:10:40,821 --> 01:10:42,281
Help your dad?

1054
01:10:42,448 --> 01:10:44,950
What do you mean?

1055
01:10:45,117 --> 01:10:46,952
I just wanted to ask if you couldn't...

1056
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:48,746
give it all an extra thought?

1057
01:10:48,913 --> 01:10:51,999
Marcus?
You're such a good boy,

1058
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:55,336
and I can understand why you feel
this way about your dad, and...

1059
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:58,756
you shouldn't pay
for his mistakes, okay? It...

1060
01:10:58,923 --> 01:11:01,425
But he hasn't done
the things you're saying.

1061
01:11:01,592 --> 01:11:05,387
Klara? Honey,
go to your room, okay?

1062
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:07,598
No, I need to tell Klara something.

1063
01:11:08,933 --> 01:11:11,143
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

1064
01:11:12,353 --> 01:11:14,021
Are you doing okay?

1065
01:11:17,232 --> 01:11:19,610
- Why are you lying about my dad?
- I'm not.

1066
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:21,278
Come here.
Klara, come here. Come with me.

1067
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:22,947
Come on, Klara, let's go upstairs.

1068
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:24,865
- We need to talk.
- Klara, go to your room.

1069
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:26,325
- Theo? Let go.
- You don't think so?

1070
01:11:26,492 --> 01:11:28,243
- You don't think so?
- Let go!

1071
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,245
Marcus, that's enough.
You should leave the girl alone.

1072
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:31,622
It's a lie.
She needs to stop! You get that?!

1073
01:11:31,789 --> 01:11:33,248
- Now, damn it!
- What the hell are you doing?

1074
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:34,792
- I just need to talk to her!
- You get out of here now!

1075
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:36,919
- I need to talk to you.
- That's enough, boy!

1076
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:39,380
- Marcus, stop that!
- Why are you lying about my dad, bitch?

1077
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:40,881
Stop that. Oh no, you didn't.

1078
01:11:41,048 --> 01:11:42,508
- Marcus, you hear!
- Holy shit!

1079
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:44,718
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I need to talk to her.

1080
01:11:44,885 --> 01:11:46,929
Enough already!
This is stopping right now.

1081
01:11:47,096 --> 01:11:49,264
- I need to talk to her, man!
- That's fucking enough.

1082
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:51,850
What the fuck!

1083
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:56,647
Damn it, Johan!
Stop it, Johan!

1084
01:11:56,814 --> 01:12:00,025
- Come here!
- Johan! Stop it. Come here!

1085
01:12:00,192 --> 01:12:02,778
- Let go of me, man!
- Go away, Carsten. You got it?!

1086
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:05,698
Go home now. You go home.
Get out of here now.

1087
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:07,658
Yeah, get the hell out of here!

1088
01:12:07,825 --> 01:12:09,660
- Get out of here, you hear me?
- Fuck off.

1089
01:12:09,827 --> 01:12:11,662
You're all fucking assholes, man.

1090
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:13,414
Come on, come. Come on now.

1091
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,499
The little shit, man.

1092
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,877
Fucking assholes, man.

1093
01:12:29,096 --> 01:12:31,515
No, you can't catch me. Hey, look.

1094
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:36,270
Hey, Marcus.
I'm glad you came.

1095
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:37,855
Come on in.
Come in and get warm.

1096
01:12:38,022 --> 01:12:39,857
Wow, you look all worn out, huh, boy?

1097
01:12:40,024 --> 01:12:42,276
Oh damn! What? How...

1098
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:50,034
- Did someone hurt you?
- No.

1099
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,328
Oh shit.

1100
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:56,165
No, you can't catch me.
Hey, look...

1101
01:12:56,331 --> 01:12:59,835
Hey, young ladies?
Slow down up there.

1102
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:03,213
Yeah, we have some family
staying over the weekend so...

1103
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,507
Hi!

1104
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:07,342
- Marcus, come.
- Got you!

1105
01:13:07,509 --> 01:13:09,261
- You can't catch me.
- My two sisters.

1106
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:11,555
You've met them, right?
When you were little.

1107
01:13:11,722 --> 01:13:13,348
- Hi.
- You probably can't remember them.

1108
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:16,018
Wow, it has been so long.
How are you?

1109
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:18,729
- Fine.
- I call them Chip and Dale.

1110
01:13:18,896 --> 01:13:20,898
They're cracking nuts.
Say hi to my dad.

1111
01:13:21,065 --> 01:13:23,317
He is just over there
trying to help your dad.

1112
01:13:23,484 --> 01:13:24,943
Are you okay?

1113
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,198
- This is Lucas' boy Marcus.
- Hi.

1114
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:31,784
These are my brothers-in-law,
sitting here.

1115
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,411
- That is Elias, and Erik.
- Hi.

1116
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:37,915
I'm Erik, and that surly bastard,
his name is Elias.

1117
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:40,375
Sit down, Marcus, okay?
Give him some water.

1118
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:42,086
Yeah, are you thirsty?

1119
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:43,921
- No wine though, right?
- Yes, please.

1120
01:13:47,174 --> 01:13:49,635
- Is tap water fine?
- Thanks.

1121
01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:53,430
Marcus, I spoke to your mom, right?

1122
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:56,683
Don't forget to call home again.
Is that understood?

1123
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:03,398
Do you know
what's going on with Dad?

1124
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:10,030
What did your old man say?

1125
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:13,325
Well, he said that...

1126
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:15,452
that Lucas is going into a...

1127
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:18,247
preliminary hearing
tomorrow morning, at 8:30.

1128
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:20,666
And there can be

1129
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,501
what we're afraid might happen,

1130
01:14:22,668 --> 01:14:26,463
that the judge will confirm
the remand order.

1131
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,841
- Yeah.
- And two...

1132
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:32,344
that he doesn't see any basis
to continue with the case, so...

1133
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,433
What do you think will happen?

1134
01:14:41,812 --> 01:14:45,774
I don't know, but...

1135
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:49,736
Apparently all the children are
telling the same story.

1136
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:54,199
It seems they describe,
in detail, your basement,

1137
01:14:54,366 --> 01:14:56,160
what kind of tapestry
you have on your walls,

1138
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:58,036
the color of the sofa and so forth.

1139
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:02,374
But when the police went
and searched your house this morning...

1140
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:06,170
They discovered...
Marcus?

1141
01:15:10,841 --> 01:15:12,885
That we don't even have a basement?

1142
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:14,469
Exactly.

1143
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:17,014
And what does that mean?

1144
01:15:17,181 --> 01:15:19,474
It means they don't have
a damn basement.

1145
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:22,394
- But what does it mean for Lucas?
- It means there is still hope.

1146
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:25,105
They've been telling a story
about a basement which doesn't exist.

1147
01:15:25,272 --> 01:15:26,815
Yes, it's very commonly seen in cases

1148
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:29,026
like this that children
describe details,

1149
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:31,486
such as for example your basement,
which doesn't exist.

1150
01:15:31,653 --> 01:15:33,906
And I don't know whether
it's their own imagination,

1151
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:36,700
something they're making up on the
playground while talking to each other,

1152
01:15:36,867 --> 01:15:39,536
whether they hear it from Mom and Dad,
or see something on the television.

1153
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:41,872
But I mean, people always
work from the presumption

1154
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:44,708
that children are telling the truth.

1155
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:47,753
And unfortunately,
very often they are.

1156
01:15:50,714 --> 01:15:53,717
- So what now?
- Well, now we'll...

1157
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:56,220
just have to wait and see, right?

1158
01:15:56,386 --> 01:15:58,972
They'll call us tomorrow morning,
then we'll see.

1159
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:04,037
Marcus.

1160
01:17:05,706 --> 01:17:07,124
Marcus?

1161
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:13,922
Good morning, kid.

1162
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:16,842
Good morning.

1163
01:17:17,009 --> 01:17:19,011
Did you sleep well?

1164
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:23,348
I brought you a cheese sandwich
and a cup of coffee.

1165
01:17:23,515 --> 01:17:25,017
Thanks.

1166
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,853
There was just something I...

1167
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,813
needed to talk to you about.

1168
01:17:31,023 --> 01:17:33,233
I just wanted to tell you

1169
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,860
that I'm your godfather

1170
01:17:35,027 --> 01:17:36,778
and you can always count on me.

1171
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:41,241
No matter what's going to happen, okay?

1172
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:46,955
I just spoke to your dad

1173
01:17:47,956 --> 01:17:49,374
and it's looking good.

1174
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:51,335
He's on his way here now in a cab.

1175
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,961
What?!

1176
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:54,713
He is out again.

1177
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,758
Eat your sandwich and drink your coffee,

1178
01:17:57,924 --> 01:18:00,135
and then we'll go down...

1179
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,680
and say welcome home
to your dad.

1180
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:29,873
Hello!

1181
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,459
Don't stand there
and fondle your boy, all right?

1182
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:35,170
That'll put you back in jail.
There are eggs and bacon in here.

1183
01:18:35,337 --> 01:18:37,589
- It's not going to eat itself!
- Coming.

1184
01:18:37,756 --> 01:18:39,466
It sure is good
to see you again, you idiot.

1185
01:18:41,343 --> 01:18:43,095
Hey.

1186
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:47,391
Hey, Fanny, girl.
Oh come on, it's not that bad.

1187
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:50,018
Could the two of you grab
some shovels and dig a basement?

1188
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:52,604
- Can't we use you?
- Fanny peed on the floor.

1189
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:55,857
No, no, no. It can't be Fanny.
It must be the police.

1190
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:06,368
What? Brother-in-law!

1191
01:19:06,535 --> 01:19:08,203
Put on a pot of something!

1192
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:27,139
Fanny?

1193
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:28,932
She'll be right in, son.

1194
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:39,693
Should I also wash,

1195
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,903
the women's panties I found?

1196
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:49,494
What are you trying to say?

1197
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:53,206
Nothing, I'm just asking you
if I should wash them.

1198
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:55,667
That would be nice,
if you can find them.

1199
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,794
I can, in a minute.

1200
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:00,505
If you put them in the basket.

1201
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:04,301
- Is she your girlfriend?
- I thought so,

1202
01:20:04,468 --> 01:20:08,555
then all this happened, so...

1203
01:20:08,722 --> 01:20:10,807
I was actually hoping
you could meet her, but...

1204
01:20:10,974 --> 01:20:12,767
well, we'll have to see.

1205
01:20:14,644 --> 01:20:16,480
What about you?
Do you have a girlfriend?

1206
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:18,523
- No.
- What?

1207
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:20,942
That isn't really my thing.

1208
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:22,944
Having a girlfriend?

1209
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,781
- No.
- No.

1210
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:30,911
I thought there was something
about someone named Jasmin?

1211
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:33,872
No, that was more than
a year ago, man!

1212
01:20:42,881 --> 01:20:45,467
Stay here. Stay here.

1213
01:20:54,476 --> 01:20:55,977
Stay here.

1214
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:58,313
Hello!

1215
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:08,448
Hello!

1216
01:21:48,113 --> 01:21:49,281
What's that?

1217
01:21:52,242 --> 01:21:55,161
- Dad, what is it?
- Just go back inside, Marcus.

1218
01:21:58,498 --> 01:22:00,166
Come, come,
we're going inside, Marcus.

1219
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:03,795
Come on in.
Marcus, go inside when I tell you.

1220
01:22:03,962 --> 01:22:05,589
- Go inside when I tell you, okay?
- Stop it, man!

1221
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:07,215
Come on.

1222
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,073
I'll fucking kill you!

1223
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,160
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
- You're fucking dead!

1224
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:37,078
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1225
01:22:37,245 --> 01:22:39,331
- Let go of me, man!
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop that now.

1226
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:41,416
- I'll kill you!
- Put it down. Put it down.

1227
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:46,254
I'll kill you, man!

1228
01:22:46,421 --> 01:22:49,007
She needs to go inside. She's cold.

1229
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,607
Lucas?

1230
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:12,072
Lucas?

1231
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:17,452
I want to be alone, Bruun.

1232
01:23:18,578 --> 01:23:21,581
Where is Marcus? Lucas?

1233
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:24,876
Did you send him back to his mom?

1234
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:26,753
Yeah.

1235
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:32,425
- Would you please leave, Bruun?
- Lucas, stop that for a moment.

1236
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:34,260
Please go, damn it,
when I ask you to, okay?

1237
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:35,428
I don't think you should
be standing out there.

1238
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:37,180
- Come on inside.
- Go home!

1239
01:23:37,347 --> 01:23:38,932
Go home when I tell you.
Leave.

1240
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:41,726
Just go.

1241
01:24:23,852 --> 01:24:26,146
Here you go.
And have a very Merry Christmas.

1242
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:28,189
- Thank you, you too, Per.
- Thank you.

1243
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:32,485
Hello, I'd like two chops.

1244
01:24:32,652 --> 01:24:34,821
We don't have any chops.

1245
01:24:37,699 --> 01:24:40,034
Sorry, I mean those pork chops.

1246
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:41,911
You can't buy anything here.

1247
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:52,005
I have a right to shop here.

1248
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:54,674
You have to leave now.

1249
01:24:54,841 --> 01:24:58,094
- Get out of here.
- I would like two chops.

1250
01:25:12,484 --> 01:25:15,195
Okay, you have to leave now.
Come on.

1251
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:17,614
Get out of here.
You can't come in here.

1252
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,285
He shouldn't be hitting.

1253
01:25:22,452 --> 01:25:24,245
You can't be here anymore.

1254
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:26,623
- He can't just hit me.
- I'm telling you quietly.

1255
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:28,875
- He shouldn't punch me like that.
- You're leaving. Get out.

1256
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,668
Right? You can't just
come out and punch me.

1257
01:25:30,835 --> 01:25:32,545
- What's going on here?
- Is that...

1258
01:25:32,712 --> 01:25:34,255
- No, that's not normal.
- Is that normal?!

1259
01:25:34,422 --> 01:25:36,132
- Just punching the customers?
- Get out. Out.

1260
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:38,927
- I can walk on my own.
- Yes, we know you can. But come on.

1261
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:47,060
- I would like to get my groceries.
- Get out now!

1262
01:25:47,227 --> 01:25:48,645
- We said get out!
- I haven't done anything.

1263
01:25:48,812 --> 01:25:50,146
I'm allowed to get
my groceries! Okay...

1264
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:55,777
All right, stop, stop, stop.
Get him out, man!

1265
01:25:55,944 --> 01:25:57,695
Get him out!
Not a moment too soon!

1266
01:25:57,862 --> 01:25:59,072
Get him out of here.

1267
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:04,744
Go home! And thanks for coming!

1268
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:11,334
- Get lost!
- What a hit!

1269
01:26:11,501 --> 01:26:13,795
Fuck off.
Don't ever come back here again.

1270
01:26:13,962 --> 01:26:17,340
- What a fucking pervert.
- You stay away from here.

1271
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:11,185
Didn't I tell you to get out of here?

1272
01:27:11,352 --> 01:27:13,688
This is the last time
I'm going to tell you!

1273
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:18,568
I just need to tell...
I just need to tell you something.

1274
01:27:21,988 --> 01:27:24,282
What the hell is he doing?

1275
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:26,576
Hey, man. He is fucking crazy.

1276
01:27:26,743 --> 01:27:28,828
- Are you okay? Let me see.
- And now I would like my groceries.

1277
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:31,331
- He's hurt.
- Just give him his groceries!

1278
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:33,249
He's sick.

1279
01:27:36,878 --> 01:27:38,671
Shit, it fucking hurts.

1280
01:27:43,301 --> 01:27:47,055
- That'll be 45,50.
- Oh, man, it hurts.

1281
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:48,848
Here you go.

1282
01:27:56,189 --> 01:27:58,983
Oh God, it's Lucas.

1283
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:01,527
Look at him, he's a mess!

1284
01:28:06,783 --> 01:28:10,370
- I'm going to go talk to him.
- No, no, no, Theo.

1285
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:13,331
Let's just stay here until he's gone.

1286
01:28:13,498 --> 01:28:15,416
Okay?

1287
01:28:18,586 --> 01:28:20,380
Where is Fanny?

1288
01:28:24,634 --> 01:28:26,135
I don't know.

1289
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:30,515
Holy shit.

1290
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:05,624
CHRISTMAS EVE

1291
01:31:07,672 --> 01:31:09,924
I would like to get in.

1292
01:31:50,882 --> 01:31:54,218
You are all very welcome
here in the church.

1293
01:31:54,385 --> 01:31:55,928
Merry Christmas.

1294
01:31:56,095 --> 01:31:58,181
We are having a Christmas service.

1295
01:31:58,347 --> 01:32:00,433
And as always,

1296
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,312
we'll be starting
with an introductory prayer.

1297
01:32:10,818 --> 01:32:13,279
Lord, I have come into your house

1298
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:15,156
to hear what you would say to me,

1299
01:32:15,323 --> 01:32:18,534
God the father, my creator,
you, lord Jesus, my savior,

1300
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:23,497
you, good holy spirit in life
and death, my comforter.

1301
01:32:23,664 --> 01:32:27,335
Lord, open now my heart
by your holy spirit,

1302
01:32:27,501 --> 01:32:29,337
for the sake of Jesus Christ.

1303
01:32:29,503 --> 01:32:32,632
So that I may learn
from your word to repent of my sins

1304
01:32:32,798 --> 01:32:35,301
and to believe in life
and death in Jesus,

1305
01:32:35,468 --> 01:32:39,138
and every day to grow
in holy life and living.

1306
01:32:39,305 --> 01:32:42,183
Hear me and grant this, O God,

1307
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:44,936
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

1308
01:32:51,192 --> 01:32:53,861
Christmas Eve in the church

1309
01:32:54,028 --> 01:32:55,696
is about the little baby Jesus.

1310
01:32:55,863 --> 01:32:58,741
The birth of the son of God.

1311
01:32:58,908 --> 01:32:59,992
Honey, what's wrong?

1312
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:01,869
This is the birthday of Jesus...

1313
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:03,829
- I can see it in his face.
- But that isn't all.

1314
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:08,376
- It's everyone's birthday.
- See what?

1315
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:11,045
You can reflect on this,
when we in a moment

1316
01:33:11,212 --> 01:33:14,966
will recite the lord's prayer together.

1317
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:18,219
Father, you will say,
and then it will happen,

1318
01:33:18,386 --> 01:33:22,431
you will have become a child,
a child of God.

1319
01:33:22,598 --> 01:33:24,600
It is starting now.

1320
01:33:24,767 --> 01:33:26,435
Now, it is Christmas,

1321
01:33:26,602 --> 01:33:29,230
the celebration of children.

1322
01:33:30,523 --> 01:33:32,275
This year, we have done something

1323
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:34,652
to emphasize the gospel
for Christmas Day.

1324
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:36,862
We have invited
the kindergarten's choir,

1325
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:39,365
who, along with Grethe,
have been rehearsing,

1326
01:33:39,532 --> 01:33:41,951
so that we may all enjoy the psalm.

1327
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:45,538
A Child is Born in Bethlehem.

1328
01:33:52,586 --> 01:33:55,673
Come, yes, you go over here.

1329
01:33:58,426 --> 01:34:02,430
There, there and there. Okay.

1330
01:34:02,596 --> 01:34:04,015
Klara, you'll stand here,

1331
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:06,350
a little bit more in front,
you go there.

1332
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:09,186
Yes. Could you come forward a bit?

1333
01:34:09,353 --> 01:34:12,440
On a line here?
That's it, that's it.

1334
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:27,955
<i>A child is born in Bethlehem</i>

1335
01:34:28,122 --> 01:34:31,667
<i>Bethlehem</i>

1336
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:38,341
<i>And joy is in Jerusalem</i>

1337
01:34:38,507 --> 01:34:42,720
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1338
01:34:42,887 --> 01:34:47,725
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

1339
01:34:47,892 --> 01:34:53,731
<i>A lowly maiden all alone</i>

1340
01:34:53,898 --> 01:34:57,777
<i>All alone</i>

1341
01:34:57,943 --> 01:35:03,908
<i>Gave birth to God's own holy son</i>

1342
01:35:04,075 --> 01:35:08,287
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1343
01:35:08,454 --> 01:35:14,168
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

1344
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:19,465
<i>She chose a manger for his bed</i>

1345
01:35:19,632 --> 01:35:23,636
<i>For Jesus' bed</i>

1346
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:26,597
<i>God's angels sang for joy o'erhead</i>

1347
01:35:26,764 --> 01:35:28,724
What are you saying?

1348
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:30,559
Are you saying something to me?

1349
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:31,977
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1350
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:33,437
Come on, what do you want
to say to me? Huh?

1351
01:35:33,604 --> 01:35:35,856
- What the hell are you doing, man!
- You want to tell me something?

1352
01:35:36,023 --> 01:35:37,775
- Stop it, Lucas.
- You want to tell me something?

1353
01:35:37,942 --> 01:35:39,819
- Take it easy. Stop it, Lucas.
- Huh? Go on!

1354
01:35:39,985 --> 01:35:42,321
- Take it easy!
- The whole town is listening to you!

1355
01:35:42,488 --> 01:35:44,573
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Then say it!

1356
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:46,659
- Calm down, Lucas.
- Psychopath!

1357
01:35:46,826 --> 01:35:48,953
Then do it!
What do you want to say, man?!

1358
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,580
- What do you want to s...
- Stop it!

1359
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:55,251
- What?
- Stop that right now.

1360
01:35:55,418 --> 01:35:56,502
You fucking psychopath!

1361
01:35:56,669 --> 01:35:59,463
I'm allowed to talk to Theo here.
Take a look.

1362
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:01,340
Then look into my eyes.

1363
01:36:01,507 --> 01:36:04,135
Look into my eyes.
Look me in the eyes.

1364
01:36:05,386 --> 01:36:08,055
Look, look, look.
What do you see?

1365
01:36:08,222 --> 01:36:12,059
Do you see anything?
What do you see, huh?

1366
01:36:12,226 --> 01:36:16,897
Nothing! There is...
there is nothing.

1367
01:36:18,315 --> 01:36:20,651
There is nothing.

1368
01:36:20,818 --> 01:36:23,487
You have to leave me alone now.

1369
01:36:24,613 --> 01:36:27,616
You do! Oh, come on, Theo,
you have to leave me alone now!

1370
01:36:27,783 --> 01:36:30,453
Okay?
I'll go now, thanks.

1371
01:36:34,999 --> 01:36:37,460
Thanks, okay.

1372
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:56,395
Oh, you're so lucky!

1373
01:36:56,562 --> 01:36:58,981
- You've had plenty.
- Oh, how nice.

1374
01:36:59,148 --> 01:37:02,193
- What did you get?
- You've had plenty of presents.

1375
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:04,653
That was just what you wanted!

1376
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:06,614
What's up, kid?!

1377
01:37:08,866 --> 01:37:10,367
There... I've got her.

1378
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:17,249
That's damn lucky.

1379
01:37:17,416 --> 01:37:19,210
At least someone got what they wanted.

1380
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:45,694
Fanny?

1381
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:00,793
Lucas?

1382
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:04,672
Hi, Lucas.

1383
01:38:14,223 --> 01:38:18,352
I didn't mean for that to happen.

1384
01:38:30,573 --> 01:38:32,908
Klara, honey?

1385
01:38:36,036 --> 01:38:39,123
It's not Lucas.
It's just Dad.

1386
01:38:46,755 --> 01:38:49,883
- Dad, are you crying?
- No.

1387
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:53,804
It's just because there...

1388
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:57,016
is so much evil in this world, and...

1389
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:00,227
if we hold on to each other...

1390
01:39:01,228 --> 01:39:02,521
it will go away.

1391
01:39:03,689 --> 01:39:06,900
Are you very sad?

1392
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:12,573
No.

1393
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:16,910
You know that...

1394
01:39:17,077 --> 01:39:18,662
that Lucas, right?

1395
01:39:18,829 --> 01:39:20,706
He's your dad's

1396
01:39:20,873 --> 01:39:22,958
very, very, very best friend and...

1397
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:25,711
we've...

1398
01:39:25,878 --> 01:39:27,630
driven around on mopeds...

1399
01:39:27,796 --> 01:39:29,548
stolen apples, and all that.

1400
01:39:29,715 --> 01:39:31,508
Dad told you about all that, right?

1401
01:39:33,135 --> 01:39:36,138
I just said something stupid.

1402
01:39:39,058 --> 01:39:41,727
He hasn't done anything.

1403
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:53,280
- No.
- No.

1404
01:39:56,367 --> 01:39:58,619
Just go back to sleep, okay?

1405
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,205
There.

1406
01:40:15,803 --> 01:40:17,680
What are you doing, honey?

1407
01:40:17,846 --> 01:40:19,848
Just go back to the others.

1408
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:23,185
Who is that for?

1409
01:40:25,312 --> 01:40:28,232
Listen, I just need 10 minutes
then I'll be back.

1410
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:30,401
Move aside.

1411
01:40:30,567 --> 01:40:32,277
Theo.

1412
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:35,280
You're not going to his place.

1413
01:40:37,783 --> 01:40:39,952
Agnes, move aside.

1414
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:09,064
- Hey.
- What?

1415
01:41:09,231 --> 01:41:11,191
- Lucas.
- What are you doing here?

1416
01:41:11,358 --> 01:41:12,818
It's just me.

1417
01:41:19,742 --> 01:41:21,744
What the hell are you doing here?

1418
01:41:28,584 --> 01:41:30,085
Well...

1419
01:41:30,252 --> 01:41:33,422
I brought some food,
if you want some.

1420
01:41:37,593 --> 01:41:40,220
Are you hungry?

1421
01:41:47,227 --> 01:41:51,190
You can go ahead and eat if you want.

1422
01:42:55,379 --> 01:42:57,005
It's good.

1423
01:42:58,632 --> 01:43:01,009
You can go back
to your own house if you want to.

1424
01:43:07,683 --> 01:43:09,476
No.

1425
01:43:11,019 --> 01:43:12,354
If it's okay, I'd...

1426
01:43:12,521 --> 01:43:14,815
I would like to just sit here for a bit.

1427
01:43:14,982 --> 01:43:17,484
If that's okay.

1428
01:44:16,283 --> 01:44:20,114
THE FOLLOWING YEAR

1429
01:44:43,946 --> 01:44:45,614
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1430
01:44:49,076 --> 01:44:50,327
Hi, Johan.

1431
01:44:50,494 --> 01:44:51,495
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello.

1432
01:44:51,662 --> 01:44:53,789
We were just killing
ourselves laughing.

1433
01:44:53,956 --> 01:44:56,750
- What's up, Torsten?
- What's up, Marcus? Good to see you.

1434
01:44:56,917 --> 01:44:59,169
- Hey.
- Hi, Bent.

1435
01:44:59,336 --> 01:45:01,713
So we're back here again. Hi.

1436
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:04,758
- Lucas?
- What the hell?

1437
01:45:04,925 --> 01:45:07,052
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

1438
01:45:07,219 --> 01:45:08,303
Yeah, you too.

1439
01:45:12,474 --> 01:45:14,601
All right...

1440
01:45:14,768 --> 01:45:16,603
You have to shut up now!

1441
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:20,440
Because we're all gathered here
for a very special reason.

1442
01:45:20,607 --> 01:45:21,900
This is the day,

1443
01:45:22,067 --> 01:45:24,569
where boys become men,

1444
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,446
and men become boys.

1445
01:45:26,613 --> 01:45:29,282
Marcus, you big lad.

1446
01:45:29,449 --> 01:45:31,535
You've gotten your hunting license

1447
01:45:31,702 --> 01:45:35,706
and tomorrow you're going
on your first hunt, at daybreak.

1448
01:45:35,872 --> 01:45:37,624
You're becoming a...

1449
01:45:37,791 --> 01:45:39,376
a grown man.

1450
01:45:39,543 --> 01:45:43,046
Now it's your turn
to conquer the woods.

1451
01:45:43,213 --> 01:45:45,799
Come up here, my boy.

1452
01:45:52,681 --> 01:45:56,643
It makes me so happy,

1453
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:59,563
to have you standing here today.

1454
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:02,482
And that's why I want to give you this.

1455
01:46:16,872 --> 01:46:20,375
I wish that it was
that you were my boy

1456
01:46:20,542 --> 01:46:23,754
and that I was the one who was
giving you this beautiful rifle.

1457
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,215
But it's not. It's your dad,

1458
01:46:27,382 --> 01:46:30,677
who is sitting right there,
who has given it to you.

1459
01:46:30,844 --> 01:46:35,390
And it has been in your family
for generations, and now...

1460
01:46:35,557 --> 01:46:40,645
now it belongs to you.
So take good care of it.

1461
01:46:40,812 --> 01:46:43,565
You grandfather,
who is buried here in town,

1462
01:46:43,732 --> 01:46:45,108
missed many a deer,

1463
01:46:45,275 --> 01:46:46,735
before his family finally...

1464
01:46:46,902 --> 01:46:48,612
got food on the table.

1465
01:46:48,779 --> 01:46:51,782
Think about that,
and congratulations, my boy.

1466
01:46:53,116 --> 01:46:55,494
<i>We hope that
he will drink with us</i>

1467
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:57,370
<i>Will drink with us,
will drink with us</i>

1468
01:46:57,537 --> 01:46:59,498
<i>We hope that
he will drink with us</i>

1469
01:46:59,664 --> 01:47:01,833
<i>That he will drink
with us</i>

1470
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,004
<i>That he will drink
with us</i>

1471
01:47:06,171 --> 01:47:08,381
- Cheers!
- Cheers and congratulations, my boy!

1472
01:47:08,548 --> 01:47:10,592
There is lunch in the next room!

1473
01:47:14,554 --> 01:47:17,516
Is there none left?
There isn't just...

1474
01:47:17,682 --> 01:47:19,935
- We'll bring some.
- Great, thanks.

1475
01:47:39,121 --> 01:47:41,081
Oh, that's going to be tough.

1476
01:47:41,248 --> 01:47:43,792
There are a lot of lines
you can't step on.

1477
01:47:43,959 --> 01:47:46,628
Yes, that's what I was
just thinking about too.

1478
01:47:49,089 --> 01:47:52,384
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

1479
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:55,387
Are you okay?

1480
01:48:07,399 --> 01:48:10,735
So what are we going to do
about all those lines?

1481
01:48:10,902 --> 01:48:12,445
I don't know.

1482
01:48:12,612 --> 01:48:15,073
- There are so many of them.
- Yes.

1483
01:48:23,206 --> 01:48:25,083
Come on.

1484
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:33,008
Carefully,

1485
01:48:34,342 --> 01:48:37,554
with very long strides...

1486
01:48:39,139 --> 01:48:40,348
We made it!

1487
01:48:41,516 --> 01:48:43,101
I think your dad is in here.

1488
01:48:45,812 --> 01:48:48,440
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1489
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:05,040
Hey...

1490
01:49:05,207 --> 01:49:07,459
you're scaring away the game.

1491
01:49:07,626 --> 01:49:10,003
Fuck, what am I doing?

1492
01:49:11,963 --> 01:49:13,840
- Did I ruin everything?
- Oh, no, no.

1493
01:49:14,007 --> 01:49:15,675
They'll come back.

1494
01:49:15,842 --> 01:49:18,386
Marcus, go wait by your deer stand.

1495
01:49:18,553 --> 01:49:20,889
You're going to have to wait
for a while on your own,

1496
01:49:21,056 --> 01:49:22,641
but they'll come.

1497
01:49:23,808 --> 01:49:25,644
Are you ready?

1498
01:55:30,592 --> 01:55:35,179
THE HUNT
