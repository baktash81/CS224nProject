1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000


3
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,673
Gideon!

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,035
It's Nicholas.

5
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,154
Yes, sir?

6
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,471
Tonight I give the Christmas angels
their assignments.

7
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,915
Well, I thought you forgot about me.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,197
Forgot about you? Oh, no, Gideon.

9
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,795
I have a very difficult case
for you this year.

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,840
Her name is Ginnie Grainger.
She never even says "Merry Christmas. "

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,796
Yeah, I know. Where will I find her?

12
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,156
In a town to the north, called Medford.

13
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,199
You'll find her there tomorrow morning,
in a shopping mall.

14
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,038
Medford, north, in a shopping mall.

15
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,671
Mommy!

16
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,311
Bye, Santa.

17
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,955
Mom, why can't I go see Santa Claus?
Mom, why?

18
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,917
Because I say so, that's why.

19
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,794
Come on, Ginnie, let
her. It's only $4.50.

20
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,155
I have to work over an hour
to make four and a half dollars.

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,037
You get a job,
you can take her to see Santa Claus.

22
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,559
Are you gonna start
up with that again?

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,998
Please, Mom. Please!

24
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,436
Abbie, you are going to get a smack
in a minute, and I mean it.

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,354
We came here to get socks and stuff,
and that's it.

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,193
It's OK, honey. You don't want to see
that Santa Claus anyway.

27
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,510
He's not the real Santa Claus,
is he, Cal?

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,672
No, the real Santa Claus
is up at the North Pole.

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,513
This guy's just like,
you know, Santa Claus's helper.

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,830
If I don't even see
Santa Claus's helper,

31
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,275
how does Santa Claus know
what I want for Christmas?

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,069
Santa Claus! Abbie, for Pete's sake,
you're nearly seven years old, so...

33
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,593
Mom!
- Ginnie.

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,398
It's about time you found out

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,756
that the only real Santa Claus
is the one at the North Pole.

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,038
I'm six. I already knew that.
- Can we have an ice cream, Daddy?

37
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,317
I want a Cabbage Patch Kid,
and a toy oven that really bakes.

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,198
Just put it all in the letter
to Santa.- OK, Dad.

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,191
I want a Swatch watch, too.

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,114
Forget it. You're not getting all those
things. We can't afford a big Christmas.

41
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,990
We can't, but Santa Claus can.
He has a zillion million dollars.

42
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,355
Hey, old Santa
had a pretty tough year, too.

43
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,556
He might not even be able
to get to some of the poor kids.

44
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,915
Like Molly Monaghan?
- Like Molly Monaghan.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,390
Don't get jelly on your jacket.
- Abbie got jelly on her jacket.

46
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,596
I did not, jelly face.

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,229
One of these days, Abbie. To the moon!

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,071
Hey, Dave.
- Hi, Jack.

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,348
Who's that, Dad?
- That's Dave Gilchrist.

50
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,432
He used to work with me
over at Continental. Continental Radio.

51
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,198
That's where your old
dad got canned from

52
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,876
by that dork, Frank Crump.

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,996
A long, long time ago.

54
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,277
Hey, not that long ago. July.
- June.

55
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,789
And Continental's making us move out.
Right, Dad?

56
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,509
Yep. Yep, it's a company house.
It's their house.

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,751
Oh, look, Cal.
Our snowman fell over again.

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,030
We gotta build it again.

59
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,318
Where are you going?

60
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,109
Down the basement. Work on those bikes
for the neighbour kids.

61
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,998
Jack, we're moving in only ten days.

62
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,356
We gotta start
getting some of the packing done.

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,113
Come on, Ginnie, just give me
half an hour, 45 minutes.

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,633
I gotta get 'em done by Christmas Eve.

65
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,030
So I'm supposed to do all the packing by
myself on my one morning off from work?

66
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,351
Just give me a little while down there
and then I'll give you a hand.

67
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,032
Hey!

68
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,352
Hey, Eddie.

69
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,672
Can you believe
that weather we're having? Huh?

70
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,751
Do you think
we're gonna get another blizzard?

71
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,829
I hope not.

72
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,151
Still working on the bikes?
- Working on the bikes?

73
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,310
Well, I don't know.

74
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,156
Huh?
- Oh, brother! Go on down there.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,195
Thanks a lot, honey.
You won't be sorry.

76
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:54,391
I'm already sorry.

77
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,153
It's time to finish the great
Jack Grainger special, huh?

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,437
No, gotta finish this one
for Molly Monaghan first.

79
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,080
But if I can sneak a few
more hours' work on it,

80
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:09,640
oughta be ready for a road test.

81
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
High speed, very low energy input.

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,711
Jack, this could be
some kind of breakthrough.

83
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,712
You could make a mint on a
bike like this.- I could?

84
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,348
I thought about owning my own shop.
- Really?

85
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,514
Yeah, sell my own special designs.
I worked out the figures, though.

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,196
It'd cost me 5,000 bucks just to open
the door. That's 5,000 more than I got.

87
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,271
Which reminds me.

88
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,099
I collected 18 more bucks for

89
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,079
the town tree fund
from the guys at work.

90
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,879
Good. Puts us over 200.

91
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,391
You know, everybody thinks
we're nuts for doing this.

92
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,235
Why? It wouldn't be Christmas in Medford
without the town tree lit up, right?

93
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,238
Hit it over, come on!
- How about passing the puck sometime?

94
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,231
Out of my way, Ralphie!

95
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,477
It's stopped snowing!

96
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,198
What are you getting
for Christmas, Molly?

97
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,478
I don't know. Nothing, I guess.
- But what would you really like to get?

98
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,553
A bike. I'd sure like to get a bike.

99
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,832
Three days till Christmas.
- Does your mom like Christmas?

100
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,516
Yep.
- My mom don't. I wish she did.

101
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,676
Your momma doesn't like Christmas?
- Who are you, mister?

102
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,518
A friend. Just a friend.

103
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,920
Hey, boys, be careful.
There's little kids here.

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,752
Eat snow, mister!

105
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,790
I told you that'd happen.
- Let's get out of here!

106
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,668
That's amazing! The window broke.
- The window broke!

107
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,193
Hey, Mom, we've got company.

108
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,191
Mr Grump.
- What?

109
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,037
Hey, how you doing, Ginnie?
Frank Crump from Continental.

110
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,477
I just dropped by to show these folks
around the premises.

111
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,437
Well, Mr Crump...

112
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,875
This is the Noonans, Mrs Grainger.

113
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,599
They just wanted to have
a quick look-see around, you know.

114
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,274
Mr Crump,
I haven't even made the beds, and I...

115
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,272
Hey, hell, who cares
if the beds aren't made?

116
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,999
Abbie, Cal. For Pete's sake,

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,639
you're tracking snow
all over the carpet!

118
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,156
Now go outside right this minute.
- We'll just start downstairs, OK?

119
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,630
The basement's right down here.

120
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,915
Hi, Jack. Frank Crump.

121
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,876
Just showing the new tenants around.

122
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,752
You got a full basement...

123
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,355
All this junk out of here,

124
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:53,591
you'd make a swell
rec room for your kids.

125
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,513
This colour in the kitchen, Mr Crump,
this awful yellow.

126
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,431
Is there something you
can do about that?

127
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,910
We could repaint it for you, Louise.
Any colour you want.

128
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,757
It wasn't this yellow when you moved in,
was it, Ginnie?

129
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,434
No. I painted it myself.

130
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,954
I like yellow.

131
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,237
Well, I guess
we'd better be pushing along. OK.

132
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,191
You're gonna be outta here
by the first, right, Ginnie?

133
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,430
Yes, that's right.
- Right, OK.

134
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,990
Mr Grump?
- That's "Crump. " Yes, dear?

135
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,469
My daddy says you're a dork.

136
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,831
<i>Think it ov...</i>

137
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,039
<i>Stop! In the name of love</i>

138
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,954
<i>Before you break my heart</i>

139
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,589
<i>Stop! In the name of love</i>

140
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,950
Will somebody please get the phone?

141
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,592
Hold up, Abbie. I gotta go.
- I gotta go more than you gotta go.

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,558
Wrong number. This is not my day.

143
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,598
Mom, Abbie's in the bathroom
and I gotta go.

144
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,639
Abbie? Oh, come on,
I'm taking a shower, Abbie.

145
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,790
Now, I've got to get to work.

146
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,436
Do you have to lock the door?
- Got to, Mom.

147
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,790
Miss Badducci
says to tell you Merry Christmas.

148
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,075
Well, tell Miss Badducci thank you.

149
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,469
Why don't you ever say
"Merry Christmas," Mom?

150
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,592
Well, nobody ever really means it
when they say it, anyway.

151
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,397
It's free, Mom.
- My turn.

152
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,391
Oh, no, I'm gonna...

153
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,231
No, Cal...

154
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,995
See you later, Mom.

155
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,748
Hi, Molly. Be my guest.

156
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,829
Please, in my next life,
let me have two bathrooms.

157
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,550
Mrs Grainger!

158
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,318
Cal?
- What?

159
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,757
What's a dork?
- Dork? Well, it's, uh...

160
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,553
You know, like a sorta...

161
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,354
Well, you're too
young to know, meatball.

162
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:15,789
Oh. Thought so.

163
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,995
Oh, no.

164
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,953
You're in a lot of trouble, meatball.

165
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,676
Attention, Glen's Market shoppers.

166
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,436
Good afternoon. Here are your
Saturday afternoon five-star specials.

167
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:46,117
Nabisco Shreddies
in the large family box, only $1.69.

168
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,192
You save a dollar off our regular price.

169
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,068
And Glen's own boneless beef stew...
stew beef,

170
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,914
sale priced at only $2.29 a pound.

171
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,074
Excellent value. Have a nice day
and thank you for shopping Glen's.

172
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,833
Herbie Conklin, manager.
- Herbert.

173
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,831
Herbert.

174
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,070
Keep things moving here.

175
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,277
Hey, you already rung up
them Dorito chips already.

176
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,158
Oh, OK. You're right.
I'll take it off your tote.

177
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,276
See what she tried to pull on me?

178
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,313
See that? Next time
I'm going to the A&P!

179
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,072
Please be my guest.
Next time, go to the A&P.

180
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,798
All right.

181
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,108
That's $16.64, minus the potato chips.

182
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,273
Got that five cents, Frankie? Come on.

183
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,879
OK, fine now.

184
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,196
Thank you.

185
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,878
Ginnie, let's step on it here.
Your line's backing up.

186
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,075
Hey, Herbie,
why don't you get off her back?

187
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,072
She's behind because
she made your announcement for you.

188
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,071
Yeah, well...

189
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,909
OK, that's $26.83, Mrs Monaghan.
Cash or check?

190
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,274
I've got these food things.

191
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,033
But there's only $25 worth.

192
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,394
I don't know what to say.
I could loan you, maybe.

193
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,278
Oh, that's OK. I don't need this.

194
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,676
OK, it's...

195
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,555
That's $2.29. You're down to $24.52.
- Good. I'm OK, then.

196
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,909
Here it comes, Dad.
- OK, kids. Send it up.

197
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,639
Here it comes, Jack.

198
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,954
It's the prettiest angel ever.
- It's the biggest angel ever!

199
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,759
Bye, angel!

200
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,231
What did you get Mom for Christmas?
- A ring. A beautiful amethyst ring.

201
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,629
It used to belong to my Grandma Rebecca.

202
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,509
Whoo!

203
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,233
But don't tell anybody, OK?
Cos it's a secret.

204
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,995
OK, Dad.
Dad, is there such a thing as an angel?

205
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,594
Of course there is.
- Mommy says there isn't.

206
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,069
Well, I believe that there is.

207
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,755
I believe that whenever
anybody who's really good dies,

208
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,434
they go up to heaven
and become an angel.

209
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,992
A guardian angel or a Christmas angel.
All kinds of angels.

210
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,788
Are you ready?

211
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,950
Give me your legs.

212
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,632
And the angels are everywhere.

213
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,156
They're all around us,
and they're watching us,

214
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,152
to make sure that we're A-OK.

215
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,438
But you can't see 'em, right, Dad?
- That's right.

216
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,559
Because they are invisible.

217
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,158
Invisible.

218
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,231
Exactly.

219
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,150
Night, Dad.
- Good night, honey.

220
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,191
Invisible.

221
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,675
Did the kids give any trouble
about going to bed?

222
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,036
No, they went right up.
They're sleeping.

223
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,509
Look what I got 'em for Christmas.

224
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,757
I ran over to Toys R Us
on my dinner break.

225
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,675
I got Cal an Etch A Sketch.
You know how much he likes art.

226
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,754
And I got Abbie this tea set. I think
she'll really like that, don't you?

227
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,796
Yeah, she will.

228
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,995
So...

229
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,074
So I guess we can go get
the rest of their stuff on Monday.

230
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,077
Yeah, we'll go get 'em some crayons,
little things like that.

231
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,752
But that's the main thing.

232
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,158
Cal?
- What?

233
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,192
If Santa Claus brings all the toys,
how come Mom bought me that tea set?

234
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,595
I don't know. I think Santa Claus
only brings some of the toys,

235
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,195
and your mom and dad
have to buy the rest.

236
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,639
Oh.
- That's why they got toy stores.

237
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:28,353
Anyway, I think Santa Claus isn't coming
to us this year, cos we're too poor.

238
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,637
Not because we're poor.
- Then why?

239
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,076
Because I didn't write no letter
to Santa Claus.

240
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,298
Yeah, well, a lot of presents

241
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,596
doesn't make it any
better of a Christmas.

242
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,433
Well, when you're a little kid
it does, hon.

243
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,556
We've still got $5,000 in the bank.

244
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,677
We might as well take out a few hundred
and just buy a bunch of stuff.

245
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,834
A few hundred? Jack, that money's all
we've got between us and the poorhouse.

246
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,036
You want to throw
it away on a bunch...

247
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:58,152
No, no, no, no, no.
Not throw it away.

248
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,869
Yeah, throw it away on junk from Taiwan
that's gonna be broke in two days.

249
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,952
We don't have to buy junk.
We can buy good stuff.

250
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,068
That's not the point. The point is,
what happens if one of us gets sick?

251
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,118
What do we do for money then?

252
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,633
"That's all Cal and me want. "

253
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,271
"Please write back and tell me
if you are really real. "

254
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,954
"Your friend, Abbie Grainger. "

255
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,235
It's all wrote, Elizabeth.

256
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,675
I'm sorry I was so cranky tonight.

257
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,759
It's OK.

258
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,834
It's just this moving thing, you know,
with Christmas on top of it.

259
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,036
Well, you'd be better off

260
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:18,112
if you believed in
Santa Claus like Abbie.

261
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,993
Like you, you mean.

262
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,390
You believe in Santa Claus, don't you?
- Sure.

263
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,639
Or at least, you know, a nice spirit

264
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,279
that's around at
Christmastime, that's all.

265
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,271
I've noticed.

266
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,795
Mostly round department stores.

267
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,159
Give us a kiss.

268
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,273
<i>Oh, give me a land
where the bright diamond sand</i>

269
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,356
<i>Flows leisurely downstream</i>

270
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,955
<i>Where the graceful white swan</i>

271
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,511
<i>Goes gliding along</i>

272
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,637
<i>Like a maid</i>

273
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,751
<i>In a heavenly dream</i>

274
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,557
Can you keep a secret?

275
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,709
Yes.

276
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,516
Well, I'm an angel.
A Christmas angel.

277
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,879
Oh, no, you're not, cos my dad told me
you can't see angels. They're invisible.

278
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,839
Well, they're invisible sometimes,
but sometimes they have to show up.

279
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,152
So what's your name, then?
- Gideon.

280
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,472
Gideon, was you a good person that died?

281
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:52,590
Good person?
Well, I was a cowhand, out west.

282
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,237
And one Christmas a long, long time ago,
I was riding along the Snake River,

283
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,270
and I heard this little kid
yelling for somebody.

284
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,433
And so I jumped into the river
to save him.

285
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,637
Well, I saved him all right,
but I got myself drowned,

286
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,314
cos I didn't know how to swim.

287
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,552
And after that,
they made me a Christmas angel.

288
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,754
What do Christmas angels do?

289
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,995
Well, my job is to...

290
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,516
Every Christmas I have to help
one person that's feeling down

291
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,909
to get into the Christmas spirit.

292
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,394
One person?
- Yeah.

293
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,473
Could it be my mom? Could you make
my mom like Christmas better, Gideon?

294
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,394
Yeah, I think so, if you'll help me.
- OK.

295
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,315
Abbie?

296
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,677
I knew it.

297
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,990
Take this letter
that you wrote to Santa Claus,

298
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,117
and give it to your mom
and let her mail it for you.

299
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,838
Why?

300
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,559
That'll help her
get into the Christmas spirit,

301
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,076
and then that can be
our Christmas present to her.

302
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,712
Now, you'd better go on inside because
your momma's going to be worried.

303
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,793
And remember, don't tell anybody
that you talked to an angel, OK?

304
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,989
Abbie!

305
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,109
Abbie!

306
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,919
Abbie, you were nearly run over
by that car.

307
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,237
I know, Mom, but the angel Gideon
made it. I mean, a man made it.

308
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,676
Abbie, what are you talking about?

309
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,830
Come inside the house right now.

310
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,469
Yes, Mom. Here,
you can mail a letter to Santa Claus.

311
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,177
This letter, Abbie...

312
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:23,674
Coming out in the night,
nearly getting hit by a car.

313
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,075
Abbie, you're in
big trouble. I mean it.

314
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:28,390
But it was an angel,
and I talked to him.

315
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,870
You are never
supposed to talk to strangers.

316
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,071
Is that the kind of motel
you lived in when you was little, Mom?

317
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,799
Not really.
- No, your mom's was bigger.

318
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,589
It was the Ramada Inn,
and her dad was the manager.

319
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,834
Is that where you met Mom, Dad?
At the motel?

320
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,753
No. The motels came later.

321
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,637
Jack!

322
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,637
No, I met your mom on a blind date.

323
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,713
Ginnie Hanks, prettiest girl I ever saw.
And you know something?

324
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,032
The minute I saw her, I knew
she was the girl I was gonna marry.

325
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,315
You did not!
- Did so.

326
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,874
And she's still the prettiest girl
in the whole world, isn't she, kids?

327
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,518
No, she's just Mom.

328
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,871
Just Mom.

329
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,595
We finally got here.

330
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,834
Hi, Great-Granddad.

331
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,718
Hey, Granddad, good to see you.
Merry Christmas.

332
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,759
Great-Granddad, is there
really, really, really a Santa Claus?

333
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,476
Well, of course
there's a Santa Claus, Abbie.

334
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,549
Why, you're a Grainger, honey.

335
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,599
Our family, we've always been
strong believers in Santa Claus,

336
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,355
and the Christmas spirit
and angels and stuff.

337
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,909
We're dreamers, I guess you'd say.

338
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,714
Yeah, you're great dreamers,
all you Graingers.

339
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,155
That's what's so wonderful about you,
I guess.

340
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,231
In other words, we're nuts, huh?

341
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,477
Over there, Cal. That's a boy!
- Is there a ghost up here?

342
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,634
Nope, just cobwebs and old stuff.

343
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,798
A rocking horse! A rocking horse!

344
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,115
I know those Christmas tree lights
are up here somewheres.

345
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,155
How about this box right here?

346
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,079
Here they are. I knew they was up here.

347
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,271
Oh, my goodness.

348
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,469
I clean forgot about these.

349
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,517
Lookee here, kids.

350
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,152
What is it?

351
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,955
It's the North Pole,
where Santa Claus lives.

352
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,670
Ooh, it snows.
That's pretty, Great-Granddad.

353
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,593
Do you want it, Abbie?
- Sure.

354
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,629
Thanks, Great-Granddad.

355
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,913
<i>And here's the Christmas book my mother
used to read to me when I was little.</i>

356
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,028
Do you want it, Cal?
- Thanks, Great-Granddad.

357
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,918
Now you both got a present from me.

358
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,518
Won't have to give you
nothing for Christmas.

359
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,748
But maybe I will anyway.

360
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,994
Cal?
- What?

361
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,517
If we was at Great-Granddad's house,
would Santa Claus fit down that chimney?

362
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,230
Sure. Santa Claus can fit down
any chimney, cos he's magic.

363
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,758
Magic?
- Yep. He's watching you all the time.

364
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,479
He can see you wherever you are.
- The bathroom, too?

365
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,917
No, every place except the bathroom.
- Thank goodness.

366
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,799
Mom, is that Santa's house?

367
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,677
Yes.
- Does he have any kids?

368
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,318
No, he just has a wife, Mrs Santa Claus.

369
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,032
Oh. Mom, if Mrs Santa Claus had kids,
would she be crabby to them?

370
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,918
All moms are crabby sometimes, but that
doesn't mean they don't love their kids.

371
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,875
You go to sleep, all right? Good night.

372
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,799
Good night, Mom. Mom,
did you mail my letter to Santa Claus?

373
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,718
No, Abbie, I didn't. Not yet.

374
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,315
Aw, gee, Mom. Now I won't get anything.

375
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,078
Oh, Abbie, stop it.
Now, you're going to get

376
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,756
plenty of presents.
Now just go to sleep.

377
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,592
Good night.

378
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,595
Mom's never going to like Christmas,
Elizabeth.

379
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,118
Gideon!
- Shh.

380
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,359
Your mom still hasn't found
the Christmas spirit, has she?

381
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,470
Nope. She didn't mail my letter yet,
cos she's never gonna like Christmas.

382
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,836
She did once, a long time ago.

383
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,953
But then she lost the spirit.

384
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,276
Something in her broke.

385
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,789
The glass ball! It broke.

386
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,072
Fixed.
- It's fixed.

387
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,349
I can fix broken pieces of glass.

388
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,935
But only your mom can fix

389
00:33:09,936 --> 00:33:12,870
what's broke in her
life. What's been lost.

390
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,635
Can't we help her?
- Well, we can help her remember.

391
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,359
How, Gideon? What are we gonna do?

392
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,070
Well, we're going to give her
a Christmas present

393
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,516
that only angels and children can give.

394
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,750
And I want you
to listen real careful now.

395
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,630
No matter what happens
between now and tomorrow night,

396
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,836
I don't want you to be afraid.

397
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,072
I'm not afraid.
- That's good.

398
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,675
Now, you will need to find me later on.

399
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,837
Do you know where to find me?
- No, Gideon. Where?

400
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,635
Where the angel is at the top.

401
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,477
The tree.
- The tree?

402
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,358
The tree. At the tree.

403
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,711
At the tree.

404
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,472
This letter is to Santa Claus.

405
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,950
What are you doing?

406
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,395
Nothing. Just going
through these figures

407
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,750
again that I worked
up for the bike shop.

408
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,149
Are you still thinking about that?

409
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,712
Yeah, well, I had this idea.
Knock it off by a couple of thousand,

410
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,678
and then maybe I could
float a small business loan.

411
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,479
A loan? With what for collateral?

412
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,590
Forget it. You've got to get a job,

413
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,116
a regular job
that brings in a salary every week.

414
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,709
I know. I know I need a job.

415
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,149
This bike shop idea is the dumbest thing
I've come up with yet.

416
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,354
Where are you going?

417
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,873
Jack!

418
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,918
I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.

419
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,913
There's just no way
you can start any bicycle shop.

420
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,318
It just seems like nothing's going right
for you and me. Just nothing.

421
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,595
And now Christmas.

422
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,235
I don't know one thing
we've got to be so joyful jolly about.

423
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,630
Things'll be better next year.
- Maybe.

424
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,509
Still, you know, ever since my dad died
last year, I've been thinking.

425
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,071
Why did he even live?
What did he live for? A motel manager.

426
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,833
And me, what am I living for?
The supermarket?

427
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,718
People live for...

428
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,271
Well, I suppose, for nights like this.

429
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,474
Watching Christmas lights...

430
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,520
Being able to hear the rain on the roof.

431
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,152
Being able to see just one star.

432
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,918
Stars...

433
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,358
You know, when I was in high school,
we had this piano teacher, Miss Lehmann,

434
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,752
and she used to have us kids over
to her house to listen to records.

435
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,479
She liked
those Broadway shows, you know.

436
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,315
And she used to have this song
called "Lost In The Stars. "

437
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,777
I've never heard that one.

438
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:07,155
You would like it.
It reminds me of you.

439
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:13,110
Sometimes I think maybe God's gone
away, forgetting the promises he made.

440
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,912
<i>And we're lost out here in the stars</i>

441
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,709
<i>Little stars, big stars</i>

442
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,270
<i>Shining in the night</i>

443
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:33,117
<i>And we're lost out here in the stars</i>

444
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,752
You know something, honey?

445
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,758
If you came on this little walk here

446
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:45,676
to cheer me up, you're
doing a lousy job.

447
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,079
Hey, Jack, I'm just...

448
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,869
I'm gonna take another turn
around the block.

449
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,273
Howdy.

450
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,511
Late Christmas cards,
or maybe something for the North Pole?

451
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,397
I'm a little old for the North Pole,
thank you.

452
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,109
Well, you don't sound like
you've got much Christmas spirit.

453
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,470
I don't know you, do I?
- No.

454
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,439
No, I didn't think... I didn't think so.

455
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,993
No, I don't have much Christmas spirit.

456
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,958
But you should, you know. That's sad.

457
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,872
I should, huh? Why?
- Why?

458
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,555
You've got to find out, Ginnie.
I want you to find out.

459
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,349
How'd you know my name?

460
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,550
I put a tuna nibble casserole for you
and the kids' supper in the fridge.

461
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,234
I'm gonna be working all day,
all night till ten.

462
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,953
Honest, honey, couldn't you call in?
- Jack, we've been through this.

463
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,874
If I don't work a double today,
Herbie says that's it, I'm fired.

464
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,396
We'll go to Granddad's
first thing in the morning.

465
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,433
But then how will Santa Claus know
where to bring all our stuff tonight?

466
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,396
Abbie, I'm getting a
little sick of hearing

467
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:23,552
all this talk from
you about Santa Claus.

468
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,631
If he's coming,
he'll know where to find us.

469
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,713
He'll know, honey, and he's coming.
- Right, he's coming.

470
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,997
Jack, you just remember what I said
to you about the bank account.

471
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,674
So you're going to miss
the town tree lighting, too.

472
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,718
I've seen Christmas trees before.

473
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,076
And now me and Abbie won't be able
to decorate no tree tonight.

474
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,835
Hush, Cal. You'll be able to
decorate one tomorrow, right?

475
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,797
Ask Daddy. I gotta go.

476
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,156
Yeah, Eddie's gonna bring
that generator over.

477
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,916
Thank you, sport.

478
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,433
It wasn't as heavy as I remembered.

479
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,908
Hi, Betty.
- Good morning.

480
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,672
Can you believe those jerks
at the city council?

481
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,036
Won't even throw in five cents' worth
of free electricity.

482
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,078
OK, we're all set. Meet me at the tree
at 5.30 and we'll hook it up.

483
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,549
Yeah, I hope this is worth it,
and you folks aren't...

484
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,108
Hey, shh. Ginnie doesn't know that part.

485
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,073
Bye, honey.

486
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,434
Gin? I have eight dollars exactly, so
can you make sure I don't go over, OK?

487
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,988
OK, I'll get the window.

488
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,029
Oklahoma... No papers.

489
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,798
How many miles did you say
you got on this heap?

490
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,632
55,000.

491
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,355
155,000's more like it.

492
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,357
I can't give you anything
for this wreck.

493
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,829
Hey, look, do me a favour, will you?
Give me a break.

494
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,549
I gotta get my hands on some money
today. For this kid.

495
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,439
It's Christmas.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

496
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,949
I'll give it to you!
A hundred bucks, the car's yours.

497
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,112
50 bucks?
- I'm sorry.

498
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,512
Or I got this camp stove.

499
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,150
Ah, sure you're sorry!

500
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,711
OK, that's that.

501
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,018
I'm gonna drop you
off at the bus station

502
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:49,197
for a couple of hours, Frankie.

503
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,396
There's something I'm gonna do.

504
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,595
OK, I gotta go
in the bank for a minute, kids.

505
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,432
But what are you going
to do in the bank?

506
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,715
Never mind about that.
I'll just be a few minutes.

507
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,234
You guys stay right here
and don't touch anything, OK?

508
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,880
OK.
- OK, Dad.

509
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,556
Abbie, Dad said to stay in the car.
Where are you going?

510
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,835
To see Mom.

511
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,433
Hi, Mom!

512
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,911
Abbie...
- Hey, Mom, guess what.

513
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,676
Dad bought us a little Christmas tree
to decorate tonight. It's on the car.

514
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,513
Where is your dad?
- He went in the bank.

515
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,636
In the bank?

516
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,631
Oh, no, he doesn't!

517
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,990
Ginnie! Ginnie!
- Come on, you're coming with me.

518
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,310
Just where do you think you're going?

519
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,055
Herbie, I just have
to go to the bank for

520
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:51,710
two seconds. You could
take my register.

521
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,475
Me? I am the manager here,
and you're not going anywhere.

522
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,552
We're in the middle of
the Christmas rush here.

523
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,272
If one more person says "Christmas"
to me, I'm gonna throw something at 'em!

524
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,476
Now, I'm going to the bank, Herbie.

525
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,757
Well, that's it. You're fired, Ginnie!

526
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,119
Go jump in a lake, Herbie.

527
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,154
Thank you, Mrs McCormick.
- Merry Christmas, Eleanor.

528
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,714
Put all the money you've got there
in the bag and don't say a word,

529
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,110
or you're blown away.

530
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,996
Readouts.

531
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,311
You know you're not supposed
to go in Glen's when I'm working.

532
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,618
I've told you that before.
Your dad, honestly!

533
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,837
Now I've gone and gotten fired.

534
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,036
Abbie, get in the car
and don't get out again.

535
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,993
I mean it. Cal, keep her in there.

536
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,076
Is there a problem?
- Yes, sir.

537
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,639
Gimme that.

538
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,996
Keep that gun where it is, old man.
OK, now. We're leaving, me and her.

539
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,798
Anybody try anything, she's dead.

540
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,429
Hey, listen. No one's gonna stop you
from going. Just let the girl go.

541
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,036
Leave me alone. Leave me alone, pal.
- Listen, it's Christmas Eve...

542
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,996
Jack?

543
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,430
Jack, you're gonna be OK, honey.
You're gonna be OK.

544
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,155
He's killed him.

545
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,312
He's driving off in Ginnie's car.

546
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,356
What?

547
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,752
My kids. My kids are in that car!

548
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,753
Hey, mister, this is my dad's car.

549
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,069
He took them. He took my kids!

550
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,230
He took my kids!

551
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,069
What are your names, then?
- I'm Cal and she's Abbie.

552
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,549
Well, I'm Harry.

553
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,552
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

554
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,596
I've never hurt nobody.

555
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,671
Oh, help! He's down there.

556
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,875
Ginnie?

557
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,916
The police just called.

558
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,152
They found the children,
standing by a roadside.

559
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,310
They're fine.

560
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,595
They must have been
dropped off by the man

561
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,558
before he went in the water,
the police said.

562
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,673
We're home, Mom.
- The car crashed into the river, Mom.

563
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,038
But an angel saved us.
Right out of the river.

564
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,509
It was like we was flying.

565
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,719
Cal and Abbie?

566
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,711
Yes, Mom?
- Yes, Mom?

567
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,434
Sometimes bad things happen.
Real bad things.

568
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,478
And sometimes good things happen.
Right, Mom?

569
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:50,908
Right. But this is about a bad thing
that happened to your dad.

570
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,718
What bad thing, Mom?

571
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,111
You know this morning
when your dad went to the bank?

572
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,159
That man that took you away...
- Harry?

573
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,391
Harry, yeah.

574
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,591
He shot your dad, and your
dad got killed.

575
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,993
You mean Dad's in the hospital?

576
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,833
No. No, Cal, you see...
- When's Dad coming home, Mom?

577
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,751
Well, that's the thing.
He is not coming home. Ever.

578
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,910
He's not coming back to us.

579
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,515
But he's gotta come back, Mom.
- For Christmas.

580
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,199
You have to understand this,
you have to.

581
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,797
Your dad's not coming back.
Your dad died.

582
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,070
Dad never died before.

583
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,917
Cal?

584
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,235
We'll be all right.

585
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:21,398
We gotta make it, Cal, so Dad's not dead
any more, so Mom's not crying.

586
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,233
We can't, Abbie.
- We gotta.

587
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,668
I know.

588
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,909
Maybe we can't, but Gideon can.
He can do anything.

589
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,599
He made this glass ball break, and then
he made it so it didn't break again.

590
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,638
No, he didn't. Nobody can do that.

591
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,314
He did so, and I'm going to him.

592
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,789
Are you crazy?
Where do you think you're going?

593
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,553
To find Gideon.
- You don't know where he is.

594
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,156
I do, too, cos he told me.
I'm going to him. He's at the tree.

595
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,072
Mom, Abbie just ran away.
- What?

596
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,119
She said she was going to find
Gideon the angel at the tree.

597
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,031
Gideon?

598
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,271
Gideon?

599
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,196
I'm not afraid.

600
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,589
Abbie!

601
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,672
The glass ball?

602
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,217
The glass ball was one thing,

603
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,675
but bringing your dad
back is something else.

604
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,320
I think I know who we
can talk to, though.

605
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,311
Who, Gideon?

606
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,397
Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus?

607
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,388
Do you know Santa Claus?
The real Santa Claus?

608
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,635
Then we gotta go to the North Pole,
Gideon, to see Santa Claus,

609
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,631
so he can make my dad not dead.

610
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,069
Come on.

611
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,991
You didn't find her?

612
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,600
She came here. I know she came here.

613
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,996
Come on, Ginnie, I'll take you home.

614
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,469
She's probably already home by now.

615
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,675
See that little door up there?
That's where you have to go.

616
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,194
Now, you have to talk to him yourself.

617
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,636
And I'll wait for you here,
to take you home.

618
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,518
I've really got to go by myself, Gideon?

619
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,559
Yes, child?
- Does Mr Santa Claus live here?

620
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,710
Of course he does. Come in.

621
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,791
What it is, Santa Claus...

622
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,110
is my mom and Cal and me
want my dad back,

623
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,671
so he's not dead any more.

624
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,558
I'm sorry, little
one, but there are some

625
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,357
things not even Santa Claus can do.

626
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:51,793
You wouldn't have to bring me or Cal
anything else. Just our dad back.

627
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:56,351
You could give the stuff you was
going to give us to Molly Monaghan.

628
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,359
Molly Monaghan?

629
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,515
Oh, yes.

630
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,194
Please, Santa Claus, please.

631
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,355
I would, Abbie.
I really would if I could, but I can't.

632
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,157
I am sorry.

633
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,077
But there is someone who could.

634
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,310
There is? Who?

635
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,758
Your mother.
- My mom?

636
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,229
Yes.

637
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,834
She can make my dad not dead?

638
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,471
Yes, Abbie, yes.

639
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,071
But how could she?

640
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,668
I fixed your sweater, Nicholas.

641
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,879
Oh... Oh, my sweater. Thank you.

642
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,318
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

643
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,035
Abbie, I have something

644
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,991
I want you to give to your mother.

645
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,670
Is this your workshop?
- Yes, this is my workshop, Abbie.

646
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,832
My brother's never going
to believe this.

647
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,040
Watch out for the bicycle, child.

648
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,118
My brother is never going
to believe this.

649
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,195
Hello, how are you doing, Sidney?
- Merry Christmas.

650
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,599
Hello.

651
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,594
<i>Bonjour!</i>

652
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,950
Did you see that man?
That was Mr Perkins.

653
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,079
He used to be the janitor in our school
before he...

654
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,675
Died? Most people think it's elves,

655
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,992
but it's just nice, ordinary people,
young and old, that work here.

656
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,991
<i>Joyeux Noël, François.</i>

657
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,708
Hello.
- Merry Christmas, Eli.

658
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,990
Merry Christmas, all.

659
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,275
Abbie, this is my mail room.

660
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:52,478
All of the letters children all over
the world write to me come here.

661
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,350
Now, let me see. Oh, yes. What was
your mother's name when she was little?

662
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,510
Ginnie.

663
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,115
I mean her last name.
- Oh. Hanks.

664
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,394
O'Hanks?

665
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,355
Oh... Hanks!

666
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,271
Hanks.

667
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,591
Hanks... Hanks...

668
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,115
My brother's never going
to believe this.- Uh-oh.

669
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,397
Anyone! Chaps!

670
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,109
Would you please push me a bit closer?

671
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,515
In!

672
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,111
Whoa, whoa!

673
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,911
Hanks!

674
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,037
Now, let me see.

675
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,871
Ah, I thought so.

676
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,994
Now, here it is, Abbie.

677
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,709
Now, this is what I want you
to give to your mother.

678
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,258
Santa Claus, how come
you don't look like

679
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:49,516
the Santa Claus in the mall?

680
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,354
Because the Santa Claus in the mall
isn't me.

681
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,396
Santa Claus, how can one sleigh carry

682
01:04:57,397 --> 01:05:00,673
all the toys for all
the kids, everyplace?

683
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,878
Because it's a magic sleigh. Very magic.

684
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,070
Do you believe in magic, Abbie?

685
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,756
Yes.
- Good.

686
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,550
Your lunch, Nicholas.
- Oh, yes!

687
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,631
Have a nice trip.
- Yes.

688
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,511
Take care of Abbie.
Make sure that she gets home,

689
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,752
and I'll see you in the morning.
- I'll see you in the morning.

690
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,711
Goodbye, Abbie.

691
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,677
Bye, Santa Claus.

692
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:55,040
You wait here, Abbie, and I'll go
and fetch Gideon to take you home.

693
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,509
Yes, Mrs Santa Claus.

694
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,629
Santa Claus has gone.

695
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,670
Good night, Gideon.
- Good night, Abbie.

696
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,557
Hi, Cal.
- Abbie, where you been?

697
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,350
To the North Pole.
- You have not. Mom's mad at you.

698
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,396
She was looking for you everywhere.

699
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,950
I saw Santa Claus, but he can't make it
so Dad isn't dead any more, but...

700
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,917
You did not see Santa Claus!

701
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,912
I did so. Give me back my glass ball.

702
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,468
Who needs it?
I'm gonna tell Mom you're back.

703
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,678
And you're gonna get it, Abbie.
You're gonna get it good.

704
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,154
Gonna get it!

705
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,630
Mom, Abbie came back. She's upstairs.

706
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,749
Abbie...

707
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,912
I told you, Mom.
I told you she was back.

708
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,753
You go on back downstairs.
I want to talk to Abbie for a minute.

709
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,353
Oh, Mom, do I have to?

710
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,000
Yeah, you have to. Go on.

711
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,991
Yes, Mom.

712
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,359
Come on, let's go to your room.

713
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:15,554
Abbie, where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

714
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:19,189
I've been to the North Pole, Mom,
to see Santa Claus.

715
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,035
Don't tell me stories like that.

716
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,196
No, Mom, really.
Gideon took me there. He can fly.

717
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,273
You gonna spank me, Mom?

718
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,959
No, I'm not, but you
shouldn't tell fibs.

719
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,909
Yes, Mom. But it's true.

720
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,918
There is an angel.

721
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,515
You know there's an angel, or Cal and I
would be drowned in the river.

722
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,752
Maybe there is an angel.

723
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:01,030
There is a Santa Claus, too. But he
can't make it so Dad's not dead no more.

724
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,634
Aw, honey, nobody can.

725
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,552
No, you can. He said you can.

726
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,870
But then he didn't tell me how.

727
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,639
I'm tired, Mom, real tired.

728
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,278
It took such a long time,

729
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:19,831
going all the way to the North Pole
and then coming back home again.

730
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,356
I know.

731
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,873
Tell you what.
Close your eyes, go to sleep.

732
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,315
When you wake up in the morning,
it'll be Christmas.

733
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,837
Yes, Mom.
Santa gave me something to give you.

734
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,758
It's a letter.

735
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,274
It's in my pocket.

736
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,798
OK, Abbie.

737
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,913
"December 21 st, 1959."

738
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,478
"Dear Santa Claus,

739
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,075
"I want roller skates and a Hula-Hoop

740
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,150
and a raggedy doll and a tea set

741
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,151
and a Mister Potato Head. "

742
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,157
"Your friend, Ginnie Hanks. "

743
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,835
Oh, my!

744
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,517
Good night, Ginnie. Merry Christmas.

745
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,549
Good night, Gideon.

746
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,631
Oh, Jack!

747
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,631
You're not dead.

748
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,749
Hey, honey, of course I'm not dead.

749
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,549
No... No, of course you're not dead.

750
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,551
Of course not.

751
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,548
It's just that it is so good to see you.

752
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,794
So good to see me?

753
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,668
Well, I saw you a minute ago, didn't I?

754
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,513
You sang that little song, remember?

755
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,989
Yeah. Yeah, just a minute ago, yeah.

756
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,157
I love you so much.

757
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,800
I love you, too.

758
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,508
You're not going to work, Mom?

759
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,353
No, I'm not going to work.
I don't care if Herbie fires me.

760
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,989
It's Christmas Eve
and we're going to be together.

761
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:28,996
We're going to have
a wonderful Christmas, you'll see.

762
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,753
I'll give it to you.
A hundred bucks, the car's yours.

763
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,400
Forget it. It's not worth
anything to me.

764
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,032
50 bucks?

765
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,956
I'm sorry.- So what'll you
give me for a camp stove?

766
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,109
50 dollars.

767
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,434
Some kind of joke?

768
01:15:55,435 --> 01:15:57,909
No. No, I just really
need a camp stove.

769
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,194
There it is.

770
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,431
Thanks a lot.

771
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,709
You don't know what this means to me.

772
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,909
Maybe I do.

773
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,268
Thanks again, lady.

774
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,791
Merry Christmas.

775
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,352
I don't care if you fire me, Herbie.

776
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:48,389
It's Christmas, and I'm going to spend
Christmas Eve with my kids and Jack.

777
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,836
And I mean it.
- Is that so?

778
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,314
Well, you know
what I have to say about that.

779
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,868
No.
- Go, and don't come back.

780
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,279
Not until Thursday morning.

781
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,636
But you be on that register
nine o'clock sharp. Merry Christmas.

782
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,109
Herbie! Thanks.

783
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,788
Molly Monaghan wanted a bike.

784
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,950
Yeah, and now she's getting it.

785
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,912
Hurry up. Come on, get in.
Close the door.

786
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,395
Merry Christmas!

787
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,916
A bike! A bike!

788
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,559
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?
- A bike!

789
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,551
Oh, it's so nice.

790
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,828
Maybe it needs oil.
- Maybe.

791
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,553
<i>How faithful are thy branches!</i>

792
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,553
<i>O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree</i>

793
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:38,270
<i>How faithful are thy branches</i>

794
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:42,399
<i>Green are thy boughs in summertime</i>

795
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,553
<i>And through the winter's frosty rime</i>

796
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,713
<i>O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree</i>

797
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,794
<i>How faithful are thy branches</i>

798
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,914
For the Jack Grainger bicycle shop.

799
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,597
Santa Claus?
- Santa Claus.

800
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,714
Santa Claus is real?

801
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,075
No way! He can't be.

802
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:40,199
But he is. And don't ever forget,
I told you so, Cal.

803
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,470
Something's missing,
something's missing.

804
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:25,715
Oh! Yes, of course. Lights.

805
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,831
Merry Christmas, Ginnie.

806
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,231
Merry Christmas.

807
01:22:03,231 --> 01:22:13,231
