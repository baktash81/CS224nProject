1
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:14,262
<i>We call him Flipper</i>

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,865
<i>Flipper,
faster than lightning</i>

3
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,801
<i>No one you see</i>

4
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:24,139
<i>Is smarter than he</i>

5
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:26,141
<i>And we know Flipper</i>

6
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:30,311
<i>Lives in a world
full of wonder</i>

7
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:35,917
<i>Lying there under,
under the sea</i>

8
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:41,089
<i>There once was a boy</i>

9
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:43,824
<i>Who lived by the sea</i>

10
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:46,928
<i>Ever so kind</i>

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,165
<i>But lonely was he</i>

12
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,333
<i>Until one day</i>

13
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:55,670
<i>One day when he met</i>

14
00:00:55,672 --> 00:01:01,509
<i>A friend he'll never forget</i>

15
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:03,511
<i>His name is Flipper</i>

16
00:01:03,513 --> 00:01:04,679
<i>Flipper</i>

17
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,682
<i>Faster than lightning</i>

18
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,418
<i>No one you see</i>

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,521
<i>Is smarter than he</i>

20
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:15,390
<i>And we know Flipper</i>

21
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:17,492
<i>Lives in a world</i>

22
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,860
<i>Full of wonder</i>

23
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:22,863
<i>Lying there under</i>

24
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:26,033
<i>Under the sea</i>

25
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:20,588
Mr. L.C. Porett,
remember now,

26
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,157
tomorrow we're coming through,
dolphin pen and all.

27
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,159
Ain't no need
to push none.

28
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:26,927
The boy and the dolphin
will be gone by then.

29
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,430
Fact is, they'll be
gone this afternoon.

30
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,366
It has to be done.

31
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:32,867
Look, it can't be
put off no more.

32
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:43,077
Jump, Flipper. Jump!

33
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,225
Come on. Once more.

34
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:02,897
Come on,
take me to the dock.

35
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:41,335
Thank you, Flipper,

36
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,337
but bananas
aren't for dolphins.

37
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:46,006
They're for people,
and you're not a people.

38
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,980
Sandy!

39
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,016
Coming, Mr. Porett.

40
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:04,858
Hi, Mr. Porett.

41
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,427
Come on down
and see Flipper.

42
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,028
Why, I haven't
time now, son.

43
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,363
Come on to the house.

44
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:10,531
I have to talk
to you right away.

45
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:11,532
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:13,201
Drop anchor, Star.

47
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:21,075
I still don't
understand.

48
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,876
How come I have
to leave here?

49
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:26,214
Sandy, all of this...

50
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:28,382
It's always been
state property.

51
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:30,384
And now they're
coming through here

52
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:32,720
with a new causeway,
starting tomorrow.

53
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,788
There just
ain't room no more.

54
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,790
I got to talk
to my pa.

55
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,792
You can't.
I tried to reach him.

56
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:40,794
He's still up at
the Park Ranger School.

57
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:42,296
Well, what
about Flipper?

58
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:43,964
What's gonna become
of Flipper?

59
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,900
Well, Flipper, you don't have
to worry about him none at all.

60
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:48,902
Why, he's gonna get
the best care...

61
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:50,904
by the best people
in the whole world

62
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:53,574
when it comes to dolphins,
the Miami Seaquarium.

63
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:56,010
Well, they're coming down
to get him in an hour.

64
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:57,878
To get him?

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,847
You mean,
to take him away?

66
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,916
But nobody
can take Flipper.

67
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,918
I won't let anybody
take Flipper.

68
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:09,257
Look, there ain't no
place else for him.

69
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,758
What, with your pa
still gone

70
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
and your ma passed away,
God rest her.

71
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,094
You have to go up
to Madisonville

72
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:15,396
and stay with your aunt.

73
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,598
Mr. Porett,
Flipper has to go where I go.

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,767
Sandy, there's no more water
in Madisonville

75
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,101
than you can get
from a well.

76
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,870
Now, you know Flipper
can't live in no bucket.

77
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:23,871
Mr. Porett, please...

78
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:24,872
Sandy!

79
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:30,144
I'll be back in a half hour
to help you get ready.

80
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:36,817
I'm sorry, son.

81
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,820
I thought I raised
you real good.

82
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:42,823
I did the best
I know how.

83
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:45,959
Yes, sir.
The best I know how.

84
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,668
Watch your helm, Star.
Engines ahead full.

85
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,040
Nobody's going to
take you, Flipper.

86
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,876
Nobody.

87
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:37,412
You wait right here.

88
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,013
Dear pa...

89
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:22,356
Please don't worry
about me.

90
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:28,696
I'm going far away

91
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:35,369
where no one can find
Flipper and me.

92
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:45,212
But just remember,
I'll always love you

93
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,715
and be thinking of you.

94
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:56,056
Your son, Sandy.

95
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,903
To my pa.

96
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,072
Private.

97
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,289
Yes, Porter Ricks,
R-I-C-K-S.

98
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,293
He's one of them student rangers
at the diving school.

99
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,297
Hello, Po?

100
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,000
I been trying to get you
for three days.

101
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:02,002
Listen, is Sandy
up there with you?

102
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,337
'Cause if he is,

103
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,339
I want you to put
the front of your hand

104
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:06,807
on the back
of that boy's britches!

105
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,843
No, Sandy
isn't here with me.

106
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:10,845
Why should he be?

107
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:11,846
He has what?

108
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:14,414
Well, Po, the first day,

109
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,252
I thought he'd come home
when he got good and hungry,

110
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:20,921
and then I started
really looking.

111
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:23,924
The boy ain't around
nowhere, Po...

112
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:25,359
and Flipper's gone too.

113
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,194
Mr. L.C. Porett...

114
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:30,197
You must've been using
a soap bubble for a skull.

115
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,199
I'm coming down
on the first plane.

116
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,201
And when I get there,
I want a boat,

117
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:36,036
and I want it ready to go.

118
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,630
Mom still says
you can have the boat

119
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,632
as long as you want it,
Po, but she'd kind

120
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,634
of like to know
how long you'll need it.

121
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:15,635
How long?

122
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:17,304
Till I find Sandy,
that's how long!

123
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:18,538
Till I search every
little bay and cove

124
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
up and down
the Florida coastline!

125
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:23,043
Anywhere a boy might try
to hide with a dolphin.

126
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:24,311
Well, you don't need
to worry none

127
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,313
about him going out
into the open ocean!

128
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:27,481
Why not?

129
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:28,883
Well, see, about the time
Sandy disappeared,

130
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:30,885
the coast guard
was searching every inch

131
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,386
of that water out there,
using planes and everything,

132
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,255
looking for three
escaped convicts.

133
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:36,257
Gil Bateson,
you heard of him,

134
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,758
and two other
murderers.

135
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,993
Gil Bateson?

136
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:40,961
For a while they thought
they'd headed out in a boat.

137
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,496
If Sandy had been out there,

138
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:43,998
they'd have spotted him
right off.

139
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,100
I know. I checked
first thing.

140
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:48,002
It's a big ocean.

141
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:51,005
But Sandy wouldn't go out
there in just a skiff.

142
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:53,874
Even you couldn't have
made him that desperate.

143
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:56,510
Po! Wait!

144
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:02,849
I've been saving this
for you, Flipper's horn.

145
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,351
Sandy went off
without it.

146
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,353
It might help you
find him.

147
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:09,924
Thanks,
Mr. L.C. Porett.

148
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,926
Sorry I was
so angry with you.

149
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:13,928
I know, you were only
trying to do well.

150
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,363
That's the lord's truth,
Po. It sure is.

151
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:22,036
Help me out, will you?

152
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,956
Sorry, Flipper.

153
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,392
That's empty.

154
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:56,197
That was the last
can of food too.

155
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,633
I guess I'm in trouble.

156
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:00,867
Bad trouble.

157
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:15,616
Flipper, I don't care what
happens or what you say.

158
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,618
I'm not
turning back now.

159
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:33,767
Thanks, Flipper.

160
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,306
Guess I'm not
that hungry yet.

161
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:08,135
Sam! Sam!

162
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,370
Sam!

163
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:10,371
Dang-blast it!

164
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:12,506
You're getting too old
to hear anything!

165
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,009
There's a castaway
out there.

166
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,579
I'm changing my course
to pick him up.

167
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:37,564
Oh, no.

168
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,272
Flipper!

169
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,874
Flipper, it's gaining.

170
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:21,975
You've got to help me.

171
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,600
Sam! Sam! Sam!

172
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,601
What?

173
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,102
Speed her up, Sam!

174
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,303
O.K.

175
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:14,895
Sam! I think you got
to speed her up!

176
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:16,397
He's pulling away!

177
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,398
All right.

178
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,166
He's pulling away!

179
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:31,512
Faster, Sam! Faster!

180
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:34,014
20 years you've been
working on that engine!

181
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:37,017
It can't even catch up
with one puny boy

182
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:38,519
in one puny skiff!

183
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,423
Well, do something!

184
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,605
Forget it, Sam.

185
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,309
I said, forget it.

186
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:03,811
Whoever he is,

187
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,813
he don't need
any help from us.

188
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:08,315
We need help from him.

189
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,833
O.K., Flipper.

190
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,200
We're O.K. now.

191
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,375
All right, Flipper.
You can rest now.

192
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:41,080
Don't worry.

193
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:42,582
We'll make it.

194
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:27,807
Flipper!

195
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,947
Flipper,
it's just perfect.

196
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,448
Everything we could want.

197
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,150
Nobody anywhere!

198
00:25:37,152 --> 00:25:39,252
They'll never find us here.

199
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:43,890
Flipper, I wouldn't
trade you for anything.

200
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:58,304
<i>I don't care</i>

201
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,807
<i>If the skies are cloudy</i>

202
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,276
<i>Long as you're with me</i>

203
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,812
<i>It's a fine and dandy</i>

204
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,581
<i>Cotton candy world</i>

205
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,350
<i>I see many times</i>

206
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,953
<i>When I'm feelin' lonely</i>

207
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,222
<i>You come into view</i>

208
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:18,691
<i>It's a fine and dandy</i>

209
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:20,960
<i>Cotton candy world</i>

210
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,462
<i>With you</i>

211
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:23,963
<i>You're the prize</i>

212
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:25,465
<i>I won</i>

213
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,835
<i>You're the apple
on the stick</i>

214
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:31,671
<i>You're the one
I had to pick</i>

215
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,339
<i>You made my heart</i>

216
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,609
<i>Go tickety tickety tick</i>

217
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:43,316
<i>Every day is a day
of wonder</i>

218
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:45,552
<i>Never ever blue</i>

219
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:47,554
<i>It's a fine and dandy</i>

220
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:49,088
<i>Cotton candy</i>

221
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,924
<i>Fine and dandy</i>

222
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:53,626
<i>Cotton candy world</i>

223
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:57,396
<i>With you</i>

224
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:16,716
Quiet, Flipper.

225
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,885
A plane.
I've got to hide.

226
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,462
An underwater cave.

227
00:28:02,464 --> 00:28:05,698
We couldn't have
a better hiding place.

228
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,667
Flipper, this is great!

229
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:42,235
Go up and take a look,
Flipper.

230
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:18,638
Hey,
get the boat out.

231
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,639
Come on.

232
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,877
This may be
the best break we've had

233
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:26,879
since we ran that cabin
cruiser up on the rocks.

234
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,048
What'll we do now?

235
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,215
Act like castaways,

236
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:31,217
see if we
can hitch a ride!

237
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:19,265
The boat's
leaking again!

238
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:21,201
Stuff the rags
in tighter.

239
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,612
O.K., Flipper?

240
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,063
Mummy, daddy, there's
a little boat over there

241
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:25,831
with some sick men in it.

242
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,642
Could be
those convicts

243
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,078
they've been
searching for.

244
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,580
Well, if it is,
they're half dead.

245
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:42,082
We'd better
take a look.

246
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,583
Go below and
get my gun,

247
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,151
will you, Julia?

248
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,613
That's the three.

249
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,948
They fit the
descriptions perfectly.

250
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,550
Better get
on the radio.

251
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:20,353
Can one of you
give me a line?

252
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,688
I wouldn't do that,
friend.

253
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,824
Drop your gun
on the bottom of the boat.

254
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:30,930
All right.
Now move!

255
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:54,587
Just what we need

256
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:56,556
to take us where
we want to go.

257
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,592
Probably not enough food
for people we don't need,

258
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:02,928
so we're going
to make a little swap.

259
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,430
You're going
to take our boat,

260
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:05,965
and we're going
to take yours.

261
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:10,770
All right.

262
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:12,639
We'd better do
as he says.

263
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,209
Wait a minute.

264
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,778
We may need you
to run this boat.

265
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,912
You stay.

266
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:23,115
Yeah, but they
can't handle that...

267
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:25,117
All right, lady.
It's all yours.

268
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,826
All right, lady.
Get in the boat!

269
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,807
All right. Let's get
this clunk inside.

270
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:23,009
Come on, children.
We'd better start rowing.

271
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,395
Help them, Flipper.
Tow them if you can.

272
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:02,048
A sea monster!

273
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,317
No, it's a dolphin!

274
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:06,319
Well, never mind it.
Try to row.

275
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,321
But it's attacking us!

276
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:31,410
I know.

277
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:34,047
I saw her
try to hit you.

278
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,882
I don't blame you.

279
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,918
I'm getting
blisters, mummy.

280
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Oh, well...

281
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,556
Well, wrap those rags
around your hands.

282
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:48,194
Oh, mummy, look!

283
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:50,196
Quickly! Put them
back together!

284
00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:51,831
Oh, quickly!
Quickly, honey!

285
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:52,932
I can't!

286
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:53,933
Try! Try!

287
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:59,272
Row! Row as quick
as you can.

288
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:00,439
Quickly.

289
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,703
Oh, my babies!

290
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,738
Quickly!

291
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,808
Won't be long now.

292
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,578
Hurry!

293
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,699
I can't!

294
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:19,852
A ring, look.

295
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:22,221
Here.

296
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:30,997
Hold on.
Hold on now.

297
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,167
Hang onto it.

298
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,768
Hang onto the ring.

299
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:07,333
Gwen! Are you all right?

300
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:25,418
Penny, are you all right?

301
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,419
Yes!

302
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:28,754
Thanks to this.

303
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:31,257
Where did you
get it from?

304
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:34,860
It must have been
in the boat all along.

305
00:38:49,343 --> 00:38:52,844
Oh, mummy, what are we
going to do now?

306
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:55,981
No food, no water.

307
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:57,149
Nothing.

308
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:01,387
Marooned here.

309
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:03,389
What will happen
to daddy?

310
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,593
It'll be all right.

311
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,662
Somehow, it'll
be all right.

312
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,139
Good work, Flipper,

313
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:23,975
but I guess we both
better get out of sight

314
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:25,977
before they start
looking around.

315
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,314
See ya later.

316
00:39:58,379 --> 00:39:59,511
Morning, Flipper.

317
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:04,082
I'm going down to see
how our visitors are doing.

318
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:05,817
Follow me down the beach.

319
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:09,187
Penny!
Come down at once

320
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:11,857
before you fall down
and break something!

321
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,302
Oh, but, mummy,
we're all so hungry.

322
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:25,771
We've got to reach
those coconuts.

323
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:30,643
Well, maybe we could
cut the tree down.

324
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:33,312
There must be
millions of things

325
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:36,047
we can find
in there to eat.

326
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:37,549
Well, yes, there are,

327
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:39,551
but there are also
millions of things

328
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:40,886
that are very poisonous

329
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:43,389
and none of us knows
which is which.

330
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:45,658
I'm sorry,

331
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,395
but I can't run the risk
of your getting ill here.

332
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:52,398
We'll just have
to catch fish

333
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,566
or look for turtle eggs
or something like that.

334
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:57,235
But how, mummy?

335
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:59,772
I don't know.
We can try.

336
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:08,414
I'd like to help them,
Flipper,

337
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:11,016
but they just can't
know i'm here.

338
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:33,772
Now, Penny,
you try to fish,

339
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,774
and, Gwen, look along
the beach over there.

340
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,275
See if you
can find something.

341
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:38,777
Sometimes things
are washed up.

342
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:40,779
I'll look over there
among the trees.

343
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:42,914
That's a super idea,
mummy.

344
00:42:46,514 --> 00:42:48,514
Take this to her, Flipper.

345
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:54,252
And be sure
she doesn't see you.

346
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:07,098
Flying fish!

347
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:14,473
Take this to her, Flipper,
and stay out of sight.

348
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:46,338
Mummy!

349
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,339
Mummy!

350
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:56,748
But, mummy, they
must be flying fish.

351
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,250
They flew
right up at me.

352
00:43:58,252 --> 00:43:59,751
Penny, they're
not flying fish.

353
00:43:59,753 --> 00:44:01,186
They're a fish
called Grunion.

354
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:02,587
At a certain
time of the year

355
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:03,755
when the moon
is right,

356
00:44:03,757 --> 00:44:05,257
they swim up
on the beach.

357
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:07,259
Well,
I don't see any moon!

358
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:09,428
Children, I don't care
what kind of fish they are.

359
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,096
I'm just glad we have them.

360
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:15,167
See? I told you Providence
would take care of us.

361
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:16,868
Can't I try it, mummy?

362
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,771
Oh, Penny, you'll
only get in the way.

363
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:21,173
I'll just go on
a bit longer.

364
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:28,947
Flipper, they just
can't do anything right.

365
00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:33,618
Come on. I'm going
to need you again.

366
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:51,537
Oh, I'm sorry.

367
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:53,572
All I'm getting
is blisters.

368
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:58,977
Well, we'll just have
to eat this fish raw.

369
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:00,979
Oh, no!

370
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:02,481
Gwen, in the far east,

371
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:05,484
millions of people
eat it every day.

372
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:10,322
With a little lemon juice,
it's quite good.

373
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:12,324
But we don't
have any lemons.

374
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:13,725
Well, we must eat!

375
00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:27,005
It's that monster.

376
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:29,007
Well, never mind.
It won't come on land.

377
00:45:29,009 --> 00:45:30,409
Come on. We must eat.

378
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:36,848
Mummy, matches!
Dry ones!

379
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,852
I swear they weren't there
10 minutes ago!

380
00:45:40,854 --> 00:45:44,523
They must have been
washed up from some ship.

381
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:46,225
You see?

382
00:45:46,227 --> 00:45:48,927
Every time we need something,
somehow we get it.

383
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:50,795
It's just like I told you.

384
00:45:50,797 --> 00:45:53,031
It's Providence
watching over us.

385
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:55,033
Well, let's hope
that Providence

386
00:45:55,035 --> 00:45:57,035
is looking after
daddy too.

387
00:46:08,882 --> 00:46:11,216
Thanks, Flipper, again.

388
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:14,786
All that trouble so they
can have just one good meal.

389
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,890
Flipper,
we've got problems.

390
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:18,650
Who are you?

391
00:47:18,652 --> 00:47:20,952
Look, please...

392
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:22,454
Forget I'm here.

393
00:47:22,456 --> 00:47:23,955
I'm hiding out. I...

394
00:47:23,957 --> 00:47:24,956
Hiding out?

395
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:27,292
I'm, I'm a fugitive.
I mean...

396
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:29,294
You're part of that gang
that took my father!

397
00:47:29,296 --> 00:47:30,396
No! No!

398
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:35,867
Look! I'm a friend!
I'm not one of them!

399
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:36,868
Honest!

400
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:39,871
Look, I've been
trying to help you.

401
00:47:39,873 --> 00:47:42,874
That's how you got
the fish and the matches

402
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:45,877
and that life ring
when your boat sank.

403
00:47:45,879 --> 00:47:48,047
Flipper brought
them to you.

404
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,553
He's my friend.

405
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:58,557
He's your friend too.

406
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,527
See?

407
00:48:01,529 --> 00:48:03,529
He's bringing you
a present.

408
00:48:18,845 --> 00:48:20,612
Thank you...

409
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:23,682
Flipper.

410
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:25,617
Then why did you say

411
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,619
you were a fugitive
hiding out?

412
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:31,323
Well, I didn't
really mean...

413
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,825
I haven't got time
to tell you now.

414
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,827
But the important
thing is,

415
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,530
you've got to promise not
to tell anyone I'm here,

416
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:40,031
not even your mother.

417
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:41,100
All right.

418
00:48:41,102 --> 00:48:42,201
I promise.

419
00:48:42,203 --> 00:48:44,936
It's got to be an oath,
a blood oath.

420
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:46,972
A blood oath?

421
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:48,873
That way I can
really trust you.

422
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:50,576
Then I'll help you
all I can.

423
00:48:54,548 --> 00:48:55,981
Well, all right.

424
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:04,556
I swear I won't tell
anything

425
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:06,558
about Sandy Ricks
or Flipper.

426
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,727
I swear I won't tell anything
about Sandy Ricks...

427
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:09,728
That's me.

428
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:10,729
Or Flippah.

429
00:49:10,731 --> 00:49:11,830
His name is Flipper.

430
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:13,932
But that's what I said.

431
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:14,933
Flippah.

432
00:49:14,935 --> 00:49:17,436
Why do you
talk so funny?

433
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:19,070
I talk funny?

434
00:49:20,073 --> 00:49:21,173
Flipper!

435
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:23,908
Flipper.

436
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,245
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

437
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:28,247
England.
That's where I live.

438
00:49:28,249 --> 00:49:29,248
Penny!

439
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,382
Oh, Penny!

440
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,851
Go ahead.
Answer.

441
00:49:32,853 --> 00:49:34,686
Coming!
Be right there!

442
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,595
Look, whenever you
hear this whistle...

443
00:49:45,766 --> 00:49:48,833
try and get away
and meet me.

444
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,938
Say, you fight
pretty good.

445
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,440
You were lucky.

446
00:49:57,044 --> 00:50:00,646
You should see me when
I've had enough to eat.

447
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,419
How about that, Flipper?

448
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:12,357
Flippah?

449
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:21,966
We'll save these matches
no matter what happens,

450
00:50:21,968 --> 00:50:24,235
and we'll take turns
watching the bay.

451
00:50:24,237 --> 00:50:25,970
The minute you see
or hear anything,

452
00:50:25,972 --> 00:50:27,472
a plane, a boat,
anything,

453
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:29,474
this signal fire's
to be lit instantly.

454
00:50:29,476 --> 00:50:30,642
Right, mummy.

455
00:50:30,644 --> 00:50:32,143
It's our only chance

456
00:50:32,145 --> 00:50:33,645
to get help
for daddy.

457
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:35,647
I'll take
the first watch.

458
00:50:35,649 --> 00:50:38,383
Maybe just you and I
should stand watch, mummy.

459
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:40,318
I think we can rely
on Penny too.

460
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,354
You know
how Penny is.

461
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:44,623
She daydreams.

462
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:50,128
Maybe Gwen
is right, mummy.

463
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,996
I'll see if I can have
some more luck fishing.

464
00:50:51,998 --> 00:50:52,997
All right.

465
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:55,233
Look, I'd better
come with you.

466
00:51:11,017 --> 00:51:14,018
Not bad
for a daydreamer.

467
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,522
Gwen, why don't you
take these back to mummy?

468
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:29,200
All clear?

469
00:51:29,202 --> 00:51:30,535
It's O.K.

470
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:32,236
O.K. Now meet me
where I told you.

471
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:46,050
See how easy it is

472
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:48,052
when you know
what you're doing?

473
00:51:48,054 --> 00:51:51,055
Now, what did I tell
you about tinder?

474
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:53,558
Only use the inside
bark of the tree

475
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,560
because it doesn't
get any rain,

476
00:51:55,562 --> 00:51:57,562
so it's always dry,
real dry.

477
00:51:57,564 --> 00:52:00,064
Now, another thing you
should know right away

478
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:02,066
is how to climb
a coconut tree,

479
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:03,902
also, how to
husk coconuts.

480
00:52:03,904 --> 00:52:05,737
My pa showed me
how they do it

481
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:07,238
in the south seas.

482
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,574
It's not hard,
even for a girl.

483
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:10,575
Come on.

484
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:17,315
No, no.

485
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:21,486
You get sweeter milk
from the green coconuts.

486
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,763
O.K. That's pretty good.

487
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:33,398
I know, for a girl.

488
00:52:57,457 --> 00:53:00,124
Please, Gwen, you
only get in the way!

489
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:05,296
And that's the way
you come down...

490
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:07,465
almost the same way
as you go up.

491
00:53:07,467 --> 00:53:08,800
I remembered it all

492
00:53:08,802 --> 00:53:11,469
from a movie I saw
about the south seas,

493
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:14,205
Mutiny on the Bounty.

494
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:15,807
Well, I saw Mutiny
on the Bounty,

495
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:17,308
and I don't
remember that.

496
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,310
And that's how I remembered
how to make a fire

497
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:21,646
by rubbing sticks together.
It all came back to me

498
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:23,648
when I was sitting
over there

499
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,650
fishing and daydreaming.

500
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:28,152
You want to try it?
I'll show you how.

501
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:30,488
Oh, my weak ankles,
you know.

502
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,992
Well, maybe you'd like
to husk those coconuts.

503
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:36,661
Hit them hard against
the point of that rock

504
00:53:36,663 --> 00:53:38,262
the way I showed you.

505
00:53:38,264 --> 00:53:40,164
Oh, well...

506
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:42,000
maybe Penny
ought to do it.

507
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:45,169
Well, she seems to know
so much more about it.

508
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:47,171
Penny got
the coconuts.

509
00:53:47,173 --> 00:53:48,673
I think it's her
turn to rest now.

510
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:49,841
I see no reason,
Gwen,

511
00:53:49,843 --> 00:53:51,676
why you
shouldn't do it.

512
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:33,217
You know, this is
a magic island.

513
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:35,353
It's just
full of miracles.

514
00:54:48,602 --> 00:54:52,437
<i>Imagine that you see</i>

515
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:56,307
<i>A hand of magic</i>

516
00:54:56,309 --> 00:55:02,647
<i>Paint the trees
and the streams</i>

517
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:07,185
<i>It's like walking
into a lovely</i>

518
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:12,290
<i>Land of dreams</i>

519
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:17,996
<i>Well, take my hand</i>

520
00:55:17,998 --> 00:55:21,666
<i>Come with me</i>

521
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:24,135
<i>There's such</i>

522
00:55:24,137 --> 00:55:29,508
<i>A wondrous world to see</i>

523
00:55:30,511 --> 00:55:32,243
<i>Imagine</i>

524
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,779
<i>That you see</i>

525
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:38,216
<i>A rainbow painted</i>

526
00:55:38,218 --> 00:55:41,520
<i>Right in front</i>

527
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:45,690
<i>Of your eyes</i>

528
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:50,428
<i>Like a million flowers
were dancing</i>

529
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:55,133
<i>'Cross the skies</i>

530
00:55:55,135 --> 00:56:00,906
<i>Well, take my hand</i>

531
00:56:00,908 --> 00:56:05,510
<i>And you will see</i>

532
00:56:05,512 --> 00:56:11,115
<i>If you imagine
long enough</i>

533
00:56:12,218 --> 00:56:18,423
<i>If you imagine
strong enough</i>

534
00:56:18,425 --> 00:56:23,394
<i>This wondrous world</i>

535
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:29,834
<i>Belongs to you and me</i>

536
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:33,171
<i>Just imagine</i>

537
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:41,846
<i>And you'll see</i>

538
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:46,418
This tree can be
most useful of all.

539
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,919
It's the palmetto.

540
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:49,421
Inside the top here,

541
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:51,423
there's something
real good to eat

542
00:56:51,425 --> 00:56:52,924
called swamp cabbage.

543
00:56:52,926 --> 00:56:55,927
I never knew there was
so much we could eat

544
00:56:55,929 --> 00:56:57,429
right under our noses.

545
00:56:57,431 --> 00:56:59,431
That's where
most people do eat...

546
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:00,932
Right under their noses?

547
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:04,268
See these leaves?

548
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,771
Once you learn
how to weave them,

549
00:57:06,773 --> 00:57:08,807
you can make
almost anything.

550
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,709
Stick with me,

551
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:14,211
because right now,
I'm going to teach you

552
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:16,648
how to weave
a fish trap.

553
00:57:19,385 --> 00:57:21,385
You're pretty good
at it.

554
00:57:21,387 --> 00:57:22,887
It's not hard.

555
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,533
Penny!

556
00:57:42,509 --> 00:57:44,509
What on earth
have you got there?

557
00:57:44,511 --> 00:57:46,010
It's a fish trap.

558
00:57:46,012 --> 00:57:48,513
I made it by weaving
palmetto. It's easy.

559
00:57:48,515 --> 00:57:51,015
Now, I know I didn't see
anything like that

560
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:53,117
in Mutiny on the Bounty.

561
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,285
No.

562
00:57:54,287 --> 00:57:57,989
This was in
Showdown in Samoa.

563
00:57:59,158 --> 00:58:02,326
Well, well,
if you ask me, mummy,

564
00:58:02,328 --> 00:58:04,228
it looks a pretty
ridiculous contraption.

565
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,598
Shall we just
try it out?

566
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,199
Yes! Why not?

567
00:59:11,031 --> 00:59:14,032
I think it's been
down long enough.

568
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:17,334
Well,
come and help, Gwen!

569
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,823
It's remarkable.

570
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,192
It's nothing,
really.

571
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:43,160
You just don't see
the right films.

572
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:46,430
Well...

573
00:59:46,432 --> 00:59:48,700
Come on.
Let's get it back.

574
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:55,840
Showdown in Samoa?

575
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,550
Hey...

576
01:00:05,552 --> 01:00:07,051
You know who
this guy is?

577
01:00:07,053 --> 01:00:09,687
I've just been going
through his papers.

578
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,356
Sir Halsey Hopewell.

579
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,559
Or, excuse me...

580
01:00:14,561 --> 01:00:16,193
The Sir Halsey Hopewell.

581
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:20,297
One of the world's great
airplane builders and designers.

582
01:00:20,299 --> 01:00:22,333
Worth $10 million.

583
01:00:24,804 --> 01:00:26,838
Honored by six governments.

584
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,508
Yeah, we got ourselves
a real prize here.

585
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:34,178
I got myself some
prize new ideas.

586
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,281
Yeah. Feed him
to the fishes.

587
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:38,749
Save some food.

588
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:41,318
We don't need him
around here anymore.

589
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,354
Oh, yes, we do.

590
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:45,356
We're changing course
right now.

591
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:46,858
We're going
to turn around

592
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,360
and go right back
to that island.

593
01:00:49,362 --> 01:00:51,863
Besides, he ain't
eating very much.

594
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:53,865
All right, Mr. Sir.

595
01:02:20,787 --> 01:02:21,919
They mustn't!

596
01:02:23,623 --> 01:02:25,756
They mustn't bring
anybody here.

597
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,092
Flipper! Stop them!

598
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,342
Look, mummy,
there it is!

599
01:03:06,565 --> 01:03:07,898
Oh, mummy!

600
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,000
What?

601
01:03:45,772 --> 01:03:46,871
What happened?

602
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:53,077
Why would it do
a thing like that?

603
01:04:15,802 --> 01:04:17,467
See what I brought you?

604
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:19,970
How dare you send
Flipper to put out

605
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:21,405
our signal fire?!
How dare you?!

606
01:04:21,407 --> 01:04:23,808
I'm sorry,
but I had to.

607
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:26,143
I just can't risk
having any strangers

608
01:04:26,145 --> 01:04:27,311
come to this island

609
01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:29,146
who might find out
about Flipper and me.

610
01:04:29,148 --> 01:04:31,148
Flipper and you?

611
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,649
That's how it is.

612
01:04:32,651 --> 01:04:33,984
Do you realize

613
01:04:33,986 --> 01:04:35,485
you may have cost us
our only chance

614
01:04:35,487 --> 01:04:36,653
to help our father!

615
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:39,156
Our only chance to
get word to somebody!

616
01:04:39,158 --> 01:04:41,658
Not what happened to us,
what happened to him!

617
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,293
Oh, you... you...

618
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:46,964
I'm sorry about
that too, but...

619
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:48,532
You've got
to understand...

620
01:04:48,534 --> 01:04:50,000
All right, I will keep
my blood oath

621
01:04:50,002 --> 01:04:51,501
because I have to!

622
01:04:51,503 --> 01:04:53,670
But don't you ever try
to help us again!

623
01:04:53,672 --> 01:04:55,039
Or even speak to me!

624
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,120
I got your message
to meet you, Po.

625
01:06:49,122 --> 01:06:50,254
What's up?

626
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,957
Mr. Porett,
these charts of mine,

627
01:06:53,959 --> 01:06:55,959
now one of them's missing.
Did you take it?

628
01:06:55,961 --> 01:06:57,461
No, Po.
Which one's missing?

629
01:06:57,463 --> 01:06:59,963
The chart of the Bahamas
and the West Indies.

630
01:06:59,965 --> 01:07:01,965
I had it.
It's gone now.

631
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:03,467
Po, you don't think

632
01:07:03,469 --> 01:07:05,936
the boy headed out
that way, do you?

633
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,438
I don't know.

634
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,640
There's a coast guard station
in Puerto Rico

635
01:07:09,642 --> 01:07:11,642
that covers
that entire area.

636
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:13,644
That's where
I'm going now.

637
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,329
Hi, Flipper.

638
01:07:34,066 --> 01:07:35,900
Want me to come
with you?

639
01:09:39,025 --> 01:09:40,957
Penny, why won't you
look at the fish trap?

640
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,959
Why are you being
so stubborn?

641
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:45,462
Because I know there
won't be anything in it.

642
01:09:45,464 --> 01:09:47,464
When the wind
is this high,

643
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:49,466
the water's too full
of plankety.

644
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:50,467
Plankton.

645
01:09:50,469 --> 01:09:51,468
And that's when fish

646
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,303
just won't go
into fish traps.

647
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:55,305
But at least
you could have a look.

648
01:09:55,307 --> 01:09:57,141
It might not be
so windy over there.

649
01:09:57,143 --> 01:09:59,643
And there might be
some lobster again.

650
01:09:59,645 --> 01:10:03,380
I'm tired of nothing
but bananas and coconuts.

651
01:10:03,382 --> 01:10:05,382
Oh, I'll go
and have a look.

652
01:10:05,384 --> 01:10:06,983
Yes, Gwen, do.
I'll come with you.

653
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:08,885
No. All right.
I'll do it.

654
01:10:08,887 --> 01:10:10,187
We'll all go.

655
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:21,125
Oh, mummy,
it's really heavy.

656
01:11:36,642 --> 01:11:38,375
Cans?

657
01:11:39,478 --> 01:11:41,211
Cans of food.

658
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:49,986
And a flashlight.

659
01:11:49,988 --> 01:11:52,356
And it works.

660
01:11:57,329 --> 01:12:00,864
And a can-opener.

661
01:12:00,866 --> 01:12:02,866
A can-opener?

662
01:12:02,868 --> 01:12:06,036
That's what it is,
look, a can-opener.

663
01:12:06,038 --> 01:12:08,272
Oh, mummy,
this place is haunted.

664
01:12:14,647 --> 01:12:17,147
Penny...

665
01:12:17,149 --> 01:12:19,650
Do you know anything
about this?

666
01:12:19,652 --> 01:12:21,351
Well, I...

667
01:12:28,126 --> 01:12:29,660
Look.
It's that dolphin.

668
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:34,064
Oh, that creature.

669
01:12:34,066 --> 01:12:37,701
It must have put
those cans in there.

670
01:12:37,703 --> 01:12:39,303
With a can-opener?

671
01:12:39,305 --> 01:12:41,238
Oh, let's get away
from it.

672
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,907
It might do anything.

673
01:12:47,313 --> 01:12:49,179
But a can-opener!

674
01:12:59,324 --> 01:13:01,658
Hi. Did you
like those things

675
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,093
I put
in the fish trap?

676
01:13:03,095 --> 01:13:04,227
There's lots more.

677
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:06,497
I don't want
to talk to you.

678
01:13:06,499 --> 01:13:07,998
I found
a sunken boat.

679
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,500
It's just loaded
with things

680
01:13:09,502 --> 01:13:11,502
that you and your sister
and mother could use.

681
01:13:11,504 --> 01:13:13,504
Well, you just keep them.
Thank you.

682
01:13:13,506 --> 01:13:15,706
We don't need anything
from you anymore.

683
01:13:16,876 --> 01:13:19,376
I know
I made a mistake.

684
01:13:19,378 --> 01:13:21,378
I'm trying
to make up for it.

685
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,380
I even put
my flashlight in

686
01:13:23,382 --> 01:13:25,382
so you could
signal at night

687
01:13:25,384 --> 01:13:27,885
if you saw a plane
or heard a boat.

688
01:13:27,887 --> 01:13:29,887
I'm trying
to help you.

689
01:13:32,758 --> 01:13:34,758
We don't need
your help anymore.

690
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,760
Thank you.
Daddy's back for us.

691
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,568
It's daddy!

692
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:46,336
Mummy, mummy, quick!
It's daddy.

693
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:47,337
Look! Look!

694
01:14:09,562 --> 01:14:12,563
Yeah, Flipper, I know.

695
01:14:12,565 --> 01:14:14,731
Her father's back,

696
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:17,233
and we'd better
get out of sight

697
01:14:17,235 --> 01:14:19,837
just in case
she does tell.

698
01:14:23,576 --> 01:14:24,908
Mummy!

699
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:26,076
Oh, look!
Come on, look.

700
01:14:26,078 --> 01:14:27,243
There he is.

701
01:15:00,946 --> 01:15:02,112
Be right back.

702
01:15:05,117 --> 01:15:07,117
It's those convicts.

703
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:08,785
Run, mummy, run!

704
01:15:08,787 --> 01:15:09,953
No.

705
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:13,289
No.

706
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:16,326
We'll be with daddy
no matter what happens.

707
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,260
O.K., ladies,
get in the boat.

708
01:16:58,196 --> 01:16:59,562
Daddy!

709
01:16:59,564 --> 01:17:00,731
Daddy!

710
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:01,965
Are you all right?

711
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:04,034
Yes. Are you?

712
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,568
Yes, all right.

713
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:34,731
Darling.

714
01:17:36,101 --> 01:17:37,600
All right,
all right, lady.

715
01:17:37,602 --> 01:17:38,935
Sit down over there.

716
01:17:42,775 --> 01:17:44,574
Get on the radio,
friend.

717
01:17:53,285 --> 01:17:55,618
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

718
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:59,089
This is WG9026.

719
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,792
Sir Halsey Hopewell
on the Penn Julia.

720
01:18:01,794 --> 01:18:04,627
I can only send
this message once.

721
01:18:04,629 --> 01:18:07,130
Please tape record
if you can.

722
01:18:07,132 --> 01:18:09,132
I will wait 10 seconds.

723
01:18:20,979 --> 01:18:24,647
My wife,
my two daughters, and I

724
01:18:24,649 --> 01:18:26,649
are being
held as hostage

725
01:18:26,651 --> 01:18:28,384
by Gil Bateson.

726
01:18:28,386 --> 01:18:31,822
He and his associates

727
01:18:31,824 --> 01:18:33,824
want a guarantee
of immunity

728
01:18:33,826 --> 01:18:36,827
and safe conduct
to wherever they wish to go.

729
01:18:36,829 --> 01:18:39,830
If they do not get this
within one hour,

730
01:18:39,832 --> 01:18:41,998
they will kill me...

731
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,566
and my family.

732
01:18:43,568 --> 01:18:44,835
Do not...

733
01:18:44,837 --> 01:18:48,271
I repeat, do not conduct
any search activities.

734
01:18:48,273 --> 01:18:49,505
Stay away.

735
01:18:49,507 --> 01:18:51,007
I repeat, stay away,

736
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:53,476
or they will
kill us all.

737
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,847
And I mean it.

738
01:19:01,186 --> 01:19:03,019
I'm very sorry, sir.

739
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:05,521
But all search activities
have been suspended

740
01:19:05,523 --> 01:19:07,023
throughout
that entire area.

741
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:08,358
But why?

742
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,860
I can't tell you that.

743
01:19:09,862 --> 01:19:11,361
Well, then
for how long?

744
01:19:11,363 --> 01:19:13,329
At least 24 hours.
Perhaps longer.

745
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,331
My boy may be still
floating out there

746
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,033
somewhere in an open skiff,
half dead.

747
01:19:17,035 --> 01:19:18,034
Don't you understand?

748
01:19:18,036 --> 01:19:19,535
I think I do,
Mr. Ricks.

749
01:19:19,537 --> 01:19:21,037
I'm the father
of a boy myself.

750
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:22,205
If you'd like
to sit down,

751
01:19:22,207 --> 01:19:23,206
relax,
and wait...

752
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:25,041
Wait? I'll hire
my own search plane.

753
01:19:25,043 --> 01:19:26,542
No. I'm sorry.

754
01:19:26,544 --> 01:19:28,044
We can't let you
do that either.

755
01:19:28,046 --> 01:19:29,379
We have our reasons.

756
01:19:29,381 --> 01:19:31,381
We also have reason
to believe

757
01:19:31,383 --> 01:19:33,049
that the situation may
improve very quickly.

758
01:19:33,051 --> 01:19:34,550
Let's both hope so.

759
01:19:34,552 --> 01:19:35,551
Sir.

760
01:19:38,556 --> 01:19:39,790
Excuse me.

761
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:22,265
Hey, Gil.

762
01:20:22,267 --> 01:20:24,267
Want some more food
on board?

763
01:20:24,269 --> 01:20:26,602
There's a bunch of cans
drifting in there.

764
01:20:26,604 --> 01:20:28,104
It looks like
they popped up

765
01:20:28,106 --> 01:20:29,773
from that
cabin cruiser we sunk.

766
01:20:29,775 --> 01:20:32,776
Well, we got a few more
mouths to feed...

767
01:20:32,778 --> 01:20:34,778
don't know for how long.

768
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,147
Better go and get them.

769
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:16,112
It was a shark.
I saw it.

770
01:22:16,114 --> 01:22:18,148
It was this long.

771
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:23,219
Gone.

772
01:22:24,389 --> 01:22:25,789
Just like that.

773
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:27,056
All right, all right.

774
01:22:27,058 --> 01:22:28,557
Get back there.

775
01:22:28,559 --> 01:22:30,559
I'm tired of
looking at them.

776
01:22:30,561 --> 01:22:31,895
Get 'em
in that cockpit,

777
01:22:31,897 --> 01:22:33,562
tie them up
and keep them tied.

778
01:23:18,943 --> 01:23:20,644
Hey, Gil.

779
01:23:26,285 --> 01:23:27,717
Look at that.

780
01:23:38,963 --> 01:23:40,897
How about a little
target practice?

781
01:23:40,899 --> 01:23:42,098
Save your ammo.

782
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,600
You never know when
you may need it.

783
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,968
Only take one bullet.

784
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:47,470
Save it,
I told you.

785
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,887
What do you suppose would
make a fish act that way?

786
01:24:04,889 --> 01:24:07,591
Got some kind of loco weed
in the water or something?

787
01:24:15,334 --> 01:24:16,333
Sandy.

788
01:24:17,502 --> 01:24:18,568
Turn around.

789
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:20,002
I'll cut you
loose.

790
01:24:25,009 --> 01:24:26,509
I got one.

791
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:27,510
The other 2
are forward.

792
01:24:27,512 --> 01:24:28,678
Thanks, son.

793
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:47,029
Mummy!

794
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:09,719
Halt!

795
01:26:43,582 --> 01:26:46,516
Darling, I want you
to handle the boat.

796
01:27:00,164 --> 01:27:01,197
Look out!

797
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:49,545
Flipper.

798
01:27:49,547 --> 01:27:51,347
Quick.

799
01:27:58,556 --> 01:28:00,556
Flipper. Stop them.

800
01:32:49,681 --> 01:32:50,846
Twist it.

801
01:32:51,849 --> 01:32:53,515
Sandy, you were
wonderful.

802
01:32:59,823 --> 01:33:01,123
Thank you.

803
01:33:02,126 --> 01:33:05,027
Mum, dad, Gwen,
this is Sandy.

804
01:33:05,029 --> 01:33:06,195
He's been helping us
all along.

805
01:33:06,197 --> 01:33:07,429
Only you
didn't know it.

806
01:33:07,431 --> 01:33:10,432
Sandy, I don't know
how you did it.

807
01:33:10,434 --> 01:33:12,101
I don't know how
to thank you either.

808
01:33:12,103 --> 01:33:14,470
Don't thank me.
Thank Flipper.

809
01:33:14,472 --> 01:33:16,138
Wasn't for Flipper,

810
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,506
I wouldn't have been
able to do anything.

811
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:18,808
But who's Flipper?

812
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:19,809
Flipper.

813
01:33:26,383 --> 01:33:27,650
Flipper?

814
01:33:30,788 --> 01:33:32,454
He's been hurt.

815
01:33:51,175 --> 01:33:53,175
Coast guard radio,
San Juan,

816
01:33:53,177 --> 01:33:55,177
this is WG9026.

817
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:57,013
Sir Halsey Hopewell
on the Penn Julia.

818
01:33:57,015 --> 01:33:58,347
Over.

819
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:01,851
WG9026, this is coast guard
radio, San Juan. Over.

820
01:34:01,853 --> 01:34:04,186
Need urgent assistance.

821
01:34:04,188 --> 01:34:07,256
We have found
your three convicts.

822
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:11,260
We also need someone

823
01:34:11,262 --> 01:34:13,696
who can help
with an injured dolphin.

824
01:34:13,698 --> 01:34:14,864
Over.

825
01:34:14,866 --> 01:34:17,366
Did you say
an injured dolphin?

826
01:34:17,368 --> 01:34:18,868
That is correct,

827
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:20,369
an injured dolphin.

828
01:34:22,206 --> 01:34:23,839
Stand by one.

829
01:34:23,841 --> 01:34:25,340
I'll give you
our exact position.

830
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:46,562
We'll help you, Flipper.

831
01:34:46,564 --> 01:34:49,231
We'll help you somehow.

832
01:34:49,233 --> 01:34:52,568
Flipper,
it'll be all right.

833
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:54,804
Flipper, please
stop moving.

834
01:35:06,985 --> 01:35:09,485
Pa, if Flipper
lives,

835
01:35:09,487 --> 01:35:11,487
he won't have to
stay here, will he?

836
01:35:11,489 --> 01:35:13,990
No, son. My Park Ranger
commission's come through.

837
01:35:13,992 --> 01:35:15,958
The Coral Key
Marine Preserve...

838
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,194
that's where we're gonna be
living from now on.

839
01:35:18,196 --> 01:35:20,662
And there'll be plenty
of room for Flipper.

840
01:35:20,664 --> 01:35:22,698
He's got
to save Flipper.

841
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,566
He's just got to.

842
01:35:24,568 --> 01:35:27,036
Well, if anybody can,
it's Dr. Burton.

843
01:36:21,926 --> 01:36:23,459
That's it.

844
01:36:23,461 --> 01:36:25,127
Let's see
what happens.

845
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:28,230
If Flipper swims now,

846
01:36:28,232 --> 01:36:30,466
he's going
to be all right.

847
01:36:58,762 --> 01:36:59,761
He's swimming.

848
01:36:59,763 --> 01:37:01,263
He's going
to be all right.

849
01:37:01,265 --> 01:37:03,265
He's going
to be great.

850
01:37:03,267 --> 01:37:04,967
Flipper,
you're wonderful.
