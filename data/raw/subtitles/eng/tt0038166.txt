1
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,906
<i>We're three happy chappies
with snappy serapes</i>

2
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,501
<i>You'll find us
beneath our sombreros</i>

3
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,915
<i>We're brave and we'll stay so
We're bright as a peso</i>

4
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:55,250
<i>Who says so, we say so
We're Three Caballeros</i>

5
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,687
<i>Oh, through fair</i>

6
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,056
<i>Or stormy weather</i>

7
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,358
<i>We're always together</i>

8
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,559
<i>So let come what may</i>

9
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,865
<i>Like brother to brother
we're all for each other</i>

10
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,598
<i>The Three Caballeros</i>

11
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:18,235
<i>Forever we'll stay</i>

12
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,905
Oh!
"Felicitations to Donald Duck...

13
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,414
on his birthday, Friday the 13th...

14
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,950
from his friends in Latin America."

15
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,144
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

16
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,552
What a pleasant surprise.

17
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,149
Whoops.

18
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,923
Ah, now, isn't that wonderful?

19
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,294
Which one should I open first?

20
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:16,233
My mama told me to take...

21
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,497
this one!

22
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,436
I wonder what's in it.

23
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,911
Oh, boy! Home movies!
Just what I wanted.

24
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,844
Well, well, well.

25
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:36,252
Well, doggone.
A little penguin.

26
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,790
Oh. What a cute little fella.

27
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,102
Well, what is this?
How do you open this thing, anyway?

28
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,768
On with the show.

29
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,320
The show must go on.

30
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,896
<i>Sí, señor.
That means "strange birds."</i>

31
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,597
Oh, sure, sure.
I know: Birds.

32
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,900
Yes, amigo,
your feathered cousins.

33
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,104
You know, Donald, you have
more relatives here...

34
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,114
than there are coffee beans
in Brazil.

35
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:41,781
For instance, take the one
who lives way, way down...

36
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,285
But suppose we let my friend
Professor Holloway tell us about it.

37
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,453
From the beginning to...

38
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,463
<i>El fin, the end.</i>

39
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,659
Yes. Thank you.
Professor?

40
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,500
This story takes us
way down to the South Pole.

41
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,042
Rather than have you
stand on your heads...

42
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,204
let's turn the theater over.

43
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,872
There. That's better.

44
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,849
Two things you will find
most of down here...

45
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,115
are ice and penguins.

46
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,292
It's amazing that anybody
would want to live here...

47
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,192
but most penguins wouldn't
live anywhere else.

48
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:28,162
You couldn't find better weather
for fishing...

49
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:32,937
skiing, tobogganing...

50
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,872
or swimming.

51
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,672
And there is nothing the average
penguin likes better...

52
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:40,678
than a day at the beach.

53
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,812
Uh, but come on.
Let's meet Pablo.

54
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,682
He lives down at
the end of Main Street.

55
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:50,984
Let's go in and see
what's cookin'.

56
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,686
Pablo could never remember
having been warm enough...

57
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,321
and so his closest companion
was SmokeyJoe...

58
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:00,331
his little stove.

59
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:11,366
Between chills,
Pablo had one burning desire...

60
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,345
to spend the rest of his life
on some tropical shore.

61
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,011
So we see him bravely set forth
for the isle of his dreams.

62
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:26,081
The other penguins turned out
to give him a big send-off.

63
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:29,559
But when he gets just so far
away from his stove...

64
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,867
See what happens?

65
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:44,903
Too bad.
Perhaps he'll give up this wild idea.

66
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:48,378
But no.
He's off to another start.

67
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,617
This time he's bringing a friend.

68
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,233
Anyway, it was a hot idea.

69
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,134
Well, maybe he'll be content
to stay at home this time.

70
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,679
But no!
There he goes...

71
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,148
hotfooting it
to the land of the sun.

72
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,253
By now, the farewell committee
has been reduced to two.

73
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,200
Discouraging, isn't it?

74
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,276
Suddenly,
Pablo got one of those ideas...

75
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,683
that change a person's
whole life: A boat.

76
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,846
But where would he get a boat?

77
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,856
Just watch.

78
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:17,027
Where there's a will,
there's a way, they say.

79
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,367
And now, the official launching.

80
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,478
Day after day,
the south wind carried him north.

81
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,991
One day,
a blanket of fog rolled in...

82
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,220
and it was so thick...

83
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,671
Must be near Cape Horn.

84
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,367
As the fog lifted...

85
00:07:56,442 --> 00:08:00,606
he found himself headed straight
through the Straits of Magellan...

86
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,343
and northward
along Chile's rocky coast.

87
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,909
One day, a storm cloud came up...

88
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,581
just a little bitty
old storm cloud, though...

89
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,254
and just tried awful hard
to have its first storm.

90
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,799
Didn't amount to much, though.

91
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,568
One day on lookout,
Pablo had a bit of a shock...

92
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,766
a waterspout off the port bow!

93
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,444
But it proved to be
theJuan Fernandez Islands...

94
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:37,277
where Robinson Crusoe once lived...

95
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,317
and still does, apparently.

96
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,782
Four bells and all's well.

97
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,660
According to Pablo's chart,
he should be nearing Vina Del Mar.

98
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,894
And strangely enough,
that's just where he is.

99
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,296
He sailed past Lima,
capital of Peru...

100
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,931
hugging the coastline
with a tenacity of purpose...

101
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,635
seldom found in a penguin.

102
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,837
One day his telescope
picked out a city...

103
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:09,346
high up on top of a mountain.

104
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,747
The map said it was Quito...

105
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,650
and it was right smack
on the equator.

106
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,180
It wasn't as easy to cross...

107
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,694
but with a little help from Neptune,
he made it.

108
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,458
So, making a left turn,
he followed the equator...

109
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,989
headed for the Galapagos Islands.

110
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,003
Ah, that good old sun.

111
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,006
Pablo felt that
he'd never get enough of it.

112
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,849
Oh, he hadn't counted on this.

113
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,044
Things looked pretty bad.

114
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,111
Help! Man the pumps!
She's sprung a leak!

115
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,022
Pipe all hands on deck!
Do things! Get going!

116
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,652
Take to the lifeboats!
Abandon ship!

117
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,060
Unruffle the mizzenmast
and man the poops!

118
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,360
And, well, don't just stand there.
Get going!

119
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,731
Swab the decks, and...
Heavens.

120
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,776
Look! What's that?

121
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,937
Just what he's been looking for.

122
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:50,413
Pablo has finally reached
the isle of his dreams.

123
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,119
And so, as the warm tropical sun...

124
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,556
sinks slowly in the west...

125
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:04,392
we leave little Pablo,
a bird in paradise...

126
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,728
a picture of health
in his new coat of tan.

127
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,735
He should be the happiest
penguin in the world.

128
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:15,239
Only sometimes...

129
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,741
he gets to thinking...

130
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,944
Never satisfied.
Well, that's human nature for you...

131
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,984
even if you're a penguin.

132
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,315
You're absolutely right.

133
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,785
And now, Donald,
let's hop over the Andes.

134
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,626
From these snowcapped peaks
to the depths of the Amazon jungle...

135
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,633
one finds many more
strange and exotic birds.

136
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,330
Like the anambepreto
of Colombia and Venezuela.

137
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,397
He carries his own bagpipes
hidden under his beard.

138
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,110
Then there's his cousin,
the arapapa...

139
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,239
pride of Paraguay,
whose perfect appearance...

140
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:00,115
permits his pompous pride
in his pompadour.

141
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,087
<i>And la tijereta, the scissors bird...</i>

142
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,689
the Colombian cutup.

143
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,457
<i>Then there's
the arapacu de pico curvo.</i>

144
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,125
He's always sticking
his nose into things.

145
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,828
Did you ever see
such a freak beak, huh?

146
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:21,533
Speaking of beaks, what a time
two toucans have making love.

147
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,373
When they're beak to beak,
they can't get cheek to cheek.

148
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,437
Because when one toucan
turns his head...

149
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,641
only one toucan can.

150
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,278
Uh-oh. Who's that?

151
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,619
Oh, a thousand pardons.

152
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,625
Señor Donald, I would like
to have you meet...

153
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,992
one of the most eccentric birds
you have ever seen.

154
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,327
His name is the aracuan.

155
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,731
You'll find him most everywhere.

156
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,805
Eh, glad to know ya.
Pleased to meet ya.

157
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,733
Now, he's called the aracuan...

158
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,870
because of the peculiar
song he sings...

159
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,177
which sounds something like this.

160
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,661
By the way, amigo, did you know
some birds are skilled craftsmen?

161
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,033
Uh-uh. Is that so?

162
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,198
Yes. Quite a builder
is the little marrequito.

163
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,435
His nest may look
haphazard in design...

164
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,778
ah, but every single
stick and straw...

165
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,377
is scientifically
placed to withstand...

166
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,512
the stress and strain of...

167
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,124
well, almost anything.

168
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,255
Literally dotted are the shores
of many tropical marshes...

169
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,266
with the brilliant plumage
of the flamingo.

170
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,380
And now, Donald, how would you
like to hear a story...

171
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,322
about another bird so amazing
you won't believe it?

172
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,792
Oh, sure. You bet.

173
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,228
It's a tale told by
an old gaucho from Uruguay.

174
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:26,697
Listen.

175
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,767
It was early one morning
in springtime...

176
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,067
just as day was beginning to break.

177
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,903
As the sun came up over the...

178
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,943
Oh, but I am forgetting my story.

179
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,501
It was silent out there
on the pampas.

180
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,672
Only one little bird was awake.

181
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,945
<i>From his nest came the little
hornero to see if the...</i>

182
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,816
<i>Oh, say, do you know why
this bird's called the hornero?</i>

183
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,857
- No?
- Uh-uh. Why?

184
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,620
<i>You see, his nest is
just like the horno.</i>

185
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,662
That's the oven where we
bake our bread and our...

186
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,494
Oh, oh, oh,
you know who that is?

187
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,763
<i>That's me, when I was
a little gauchito.</i>

188
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,770
Many, many years ago, of course.

189
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,533
And why was I up so early?

190
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,541
Because I was going out
hunting all alone.

191
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,942
<i>First I put on my bombachas
and tied on my chiripá.</i>

192
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,342
<i>Then I slipped into my new botas.</i>

193
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,149
<i>And I put my boleadoras
where I could reach them in a hurry.</i>

194
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:29,024
<i>¡Gauchito.!
Not forgetting my hunting knife.</i>

195
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,187
And now I was ready to go.

196
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,965
Now, the best place
to hunt the wild ostrich...

197
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,332
is out on the wide open plains...

198
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,167
on the broad, flat land of the...

199
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,800
Flat land?
Say, what am I doing here?

200
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,969
Oh, now I remember.

201
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,481
This day I was hunting for condor birds
high up in the mountains.

202
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:53,177
While looking around for the condors,
I climbed to the top of a rock.

203
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,914
No, come to think of it,
it was a tree.

204
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,684
Let's see,
maybe it was a rock after all.

205
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,987
Although I could swear
it was a tree.

206
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,086
Oh, what's the difference?
Let it go. Let it go.

207
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,757
My sharp eyes soon discovered
the nest of a...

208
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,198
<i>Psst! ¡Gauchito.!
The nest.</i>

209
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,334
I could tell from the wings he was...

210
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,341
he was a least five meters
from tip to tip.

211
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:21,106
<i>The biggest condor bird
in all of... ¡Caramba.!</i>

212
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,672
What's this?
I couldn't believe my eyes.

213
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,218
No, it couldn't be.
But there it was.

214
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,449
I was looking face to face
with a flying donkey.

215
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,720
The donkey bird didn't seem bashful.

216
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,525
<i>He flew right up close to...
Quick, Gauchito.!</i>

217
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,589
Now! Get him, quick!

218
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,130
Aha. Got him.

219
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,468
Now, now. Easy, easy.

220
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,793
This donkey should be worth
a fortune.

221
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,801
I couldn't let him get away.

222
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,327
So I made up my mind that I'd catch him
if it took me the rest of...

223
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,340
<i>Now I had him!
Hold him, Gauchito.!</i>

224
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,138
Ride him, cowboy!

225
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,010
<i>He acted just like he was loco,
but I was an expert, of course.</i>

226
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,242
<i>He thought he could
throw this gauchito...</i>

227
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,615
but he soon found out
who was the boss.

228
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,177
<i>Psst, Gauchito.!
Who is the boss?</i>

229
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,689
I decided to train him
for racing...

230
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,284
far out where nobody could see...

231
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,990
'cause I planned to win
thousands of pesos...

232
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,523
for this little burrito and me.

233
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,865
I made brilliant plans for the future.

234
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,371
We'd live like a couple of kings...

235
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,034
and I'd be the world's
richest gaucho...

236
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,044
with my hands full
of big diamond rings.

237
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,689
<i>¡Ah, macanudo.!
Okay.</i>

238
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,354
This burrito was tame as a kitten.

239
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,125
He was learning new tricks every day.

240
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,565
<i>You should see how he begged
for my mate.</i>

241
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,727
He liked it much better than hay.

242
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:39,081
Then we soon fell asleep
by the campfire.

243
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,086
We both were as tired
as could be...

244
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,055
and tomorrow was very important...

245
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,786
for little Burrito and me.

246
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,055
For this was the day of fiesta.

247
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,432
The gauchos were happy and gay.

248
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,165
<i>They danced the zamba and gatos...</i>

249
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,504
and gambled their pesos away.

250
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,100
While the crowd sang
and danced in the plaza...

251
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,339
I just stood in the shade
of a tree...

252
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,848
<i>and watched them toss coins
at the sapo.</i>

253
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,714
But this game meant nothing to me.

254
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:17,882
<i>Some others were rolling the bochas
and betting on games of this kind.</i>

255
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,516
But I didn't join in these pastimes.

256
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,561
I had something bigger in mind.

257
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,598
<i>- ¡Ay, caballo.!
- The race was about to begin...</i>

258
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,759
and the grand prize was 1,000 pesos.

259
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,802
The gauchos were howling
with laughter...

260
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,774
when they saw us
come out on the track.

261
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,806
I whispered,
"Remember the wings, Burrito."

262
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,818
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Not yet! Not yet!

263
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:54,316
The gauchos and horses
were all on their toes.

264
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,658
We were off with the speed of a bullet.
We flew down the track like the wind.

265
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,526
Every gaucho was, uh, uh...

266
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,591
Meanwhile, Burrito and I were,
uh, uh, jockeying for position.

267
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,133
<i>¡Gauchito.!
They went that way.</i>

268
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,140
That way.

269
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,673
No wonder they laughed.
I didn't even look like a jockey.

270
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,308
<i>Hey, Gauchito.
Come on.</i>

271
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,318
Look like a jockey.

272
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,692
Pepito, the pride of Mendoza,
was setting a furious pace...

273
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,160
and Fuego, Gordito and Pingo,
you never have seen such a race.

274
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,028
Now it's Pepito and Fuego.
It's Fuego and Pepito.

275
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,828
And there comes Gordito
on the rail.

276
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,960
Do your stuff, kid.

277
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,368
No?
Well, don't wait too long or...

278
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,464
Look out!

279
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,873
Ah-heh.
What did I tell you?

280
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,173
<i>Come on, Gauchito.
The wings, the wings.</i>

281
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,381
Quickly I untied the rope.

282
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,441
Come on, come on.
Quickly I untied the rope.

283
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,226
<i>The knife! The knife!
¡Córtalo, córtalo.!</i>

284
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,127
And now we go.
You should see little Burrito...

285
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,166
tearing up the track,
so fast you couldn't see us.

286
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,476
And now down the home stretch comes
Fuego. Now Pepito's ahead on the rail.

287
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:24,209
Here comes Pingo, Gordito and Gato,
and Dorado is right on his tail.

288
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,649
But where is Burrito?

289
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,209
Here comes Burrito!

290
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,688
We passed them
like they were standing still.

291
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:36,854
And now coming down across the line
of finish, it's Burrito, the winner!

292
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:41,059
Well, amigos, it was all over
but the shouting...

293
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,033
I thought.

294
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,559
<i>Caramba.
The jig was up.</i>

295
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,712
And what became
of the flying donkey, you ask?

296
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,277
Neither him nor me
was ever seen again...

297
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,289
as long as we lived.

298
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,291
Adios, amigo.

299
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,192
Adios. So long!

300
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,957
Good-bye!

301
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,058
What's going on here?

302
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:22,638
Presents! Oh, boy!
Let me at 'em!

303
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,305
Say, what's this?

304
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,896
<i>Ah, Pato Donald.</i>

305
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,739
Or, as you Americans say,
what's cookin'?

306
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:07,979
Joe Carioca!
Well, I'll be doggoned!

307
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,317
Imagine meeting me here.

308
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,120
Donald, have you ever been
to Baía? No?

309
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,992
- No, I haven't.
- Ah, Baía.

310
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,258
Land of romance...

311
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,324
moonlight, music,
beautiful girls.

312
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,017
Oh, forgive the interruption,
Donald.

313
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,054
This crazy bird is the aracuan.

314
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,522
<i>He's meio maluco,
a very stupid fellow.</i>

315
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,189
But tell me, Donald,
have you ever been to Baía?

316
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,823
- No, I haven't.
- No? Oh...

317
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,299
I am so sorry for you.

318
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,132
Ah, Baía.

319
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,570
It is like a song in my heart.

320
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,675
A song with love...

321
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,303
and beautiful memories.

322
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:18,718
I close my eyes,
and I can see it now.

323
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,918
I can see the beautiful twilight
in the sky.

324
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,264
I can feel the breeze
from the bay...

325
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:32,497
and I can hear the music,
the music of Baía.

326
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:51,083
<i>When twilight is deep in the sky</i>

327
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,360
<i>Someone that I long to see</i>

328
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,024
<i>Keeps haunting my reverie</i>

329
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,263
<i>And so the loneliness
deep in my heart</i>

330
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,134
<i>Calls to you</i>

331
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,435
<i>Calls to you</i>

332
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:20,545
<i>I live in the memory of</i>

333
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:24,055
<i>Many dreams ago</i>

334
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,317
<i>When the stars were bright</i>

335
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,292
<i>And you were mine alone</i>

336
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,465
<i>My love for you cannot die</i>

337
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:38,060
<i>Though the oceans run dry</i>

338
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,970
<i>Or heaven falls from the sky</i>

339
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,942
<i>Now you're gone</i>

340
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:56,616
<i>Can't you hear my lonely call</i>

341
00:25:56,688 --> 00:26:00,852
<i>Morena</i>

342
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:06,828
<i>Make my life complete again</i>

343
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,966
<i>How I pray for the day</i>

344
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,474
<i>When I'll see your smile</i>

345
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,942
<i>And my heart will beat again</i>

346
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:36,894
<i>When twilight is deep in the sky</i>

347
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,226
<i>Someone that I long to see</i>

348
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:46,964
<i>Keeps haunting my reverie</i>

349
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,974
<i>And so the loneliness
deep in my heart</i>

350
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:55,035
<i>Calls to you, calls to you</i>

351
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:14,797
Ah, Baía.

352
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:16,923
Beautiful Baía.

353
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:27,066
Oh, forgive me, but have
you been to Baía, Donald?

354
00:27:27,144 --> 00:27:30,045
- No.
- No? Well, let's go.

355
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:32,241
If you go to Baía, my friend...

356
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:34,409
you'll never return.

357
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:40,417
<i>Have you been to Baía, Donald</i>

358
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:43,051
<i>- Uh-uh.
- Well, let's go</i>

359
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:45,288
<i>- They have vatapá
- What's that?</i>

360
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,593
<i>- They have caruru
- Is that so?</i>

361
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,758
<i>- They have munguzá
- Munguzá?</i>

362
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,268
<i>- Do you like to samba
- Oh, sure.</i>

363
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:12,955
<i>- Have you been to Baía, Donald
- No.</i>

364
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,889
<i>Well, let's go</i>

365
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,052
<i>When you go to Baía, my friend</i>

366
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,653
<i>You'll never return</i>

367
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:26,168
Have you been to Baía?

368
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,145
- No.
- No? Well, let's go!

369
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,086
Hurry, Donald! Hurry!

370
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:51,250
Well, well. Here we are in Baía,
land of romance.

371
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,553
Baía? Where is Baía?

372
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,217
We are in Baía.

373
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,925
Look.

374
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:02,557
Well, I'll be doggoned.

375
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:08,830
- Who's that?
- Donald, that's Yayá.

376
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:11,238
<i>- Who's Yayá?
- Ah, a baiana.</i>

377
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:22,210
<i>Donald, quindins de Yayá.</i>

378
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:25,915
She sells cookies.
Cookies, my friend.

379
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,945
Donald!

380
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,798
<i>- Hello.
- i Como vai!</i>

381
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,166
Hi, toots.

382
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,841
What?

383
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:12,525
<i>- Who is that guy?
- Oh, he's a malandro, Donald.</i>

384
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:10,549
Oh, boy!

385
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,268
This Donald!

386
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,435
Did you ever see
such a fast worker?

387
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,002
No, no, Donald.
Take it easy.

388
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,599
Look.

389
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:27,279
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy!

390
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,391
Come on, boys.

391
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:05,237
What do you feel about Baía, huh?
Tell me the truth.

392
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:08,307
Oh, swell! Marvelous!

393
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:10,910
Romance.

394
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,856
Moonlight.
Beautiful girls.

395
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:24,156
Or as you say, you are a wolf.

396
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:26,862
Take it easy.
You have more presents.

397
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:30,202
Presents?
Whee! Presents!

398
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:41,141
What? Oh! Oh!
Oh, I'm a midget!

399
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,619
Oh!
You, you're a midget too!

400
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:47,589
Oh-ho, Donald!
Don't worry.

401
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,421
It is simple, my friend.

402
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:53,293
Just a little black magic
will fix you up.

403
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,251
Believe it or not,
it is very simple!

404
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,666
You are very funny fellow!

405
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,511
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my!

406
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,843
You kill my head!

407
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:38,567
- Huh?
- Oh, my friend...

408
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:41,433
you are using the wrong finger.

409
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,405
Now, blow!

410
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:53,211
- Thanks, pal!
- B-B-B-But, Donald, your presents!

411
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:55,513
My presents!

412
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:24,672
Aha, my friends!

413
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:26,436
Welcome to Mexico.

414
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,747
Son of a gun, it's a pleasure to see
such fine gentlemen in Mexico.

415
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:33,205
Here, amigos.
Donald!

416
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,712
José.

417
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:40,449
<i>¡Caramba.!
Now we're three gay caballeros.</i>

418
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:48,822
<i>We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros</i>

419
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:52,527
<i>They say we are
birds of a feather</i>

420
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:58,540
<i>We're happy amigos
No matter where he goes</i>

421
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:02,044
<i>The one, two and three goes
We're always together</i>

422
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:08,850
<i>We're three happy chappies
with snappy serapes</i>

423
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:11,887
<i>You'll find us
beneath our sombreros</i>

424
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:18,049
<i>We're brave and we'll stay so
We're bright as a peso</i>

425
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:19,822
<i>- Who says so?
- We say so</i>

426
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:22,262
<i>The Three Caballeros</i>

427
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:32,598
<i>We have the stars to guide us</i>

428
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:35,701
<i>Guitars here beside us</i>

429
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:38,611
<i>To play as we go</i>

430
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:41,912
<i>We sing and we samba
We shout, Ay, caramba</i>

431
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:45,385
<i>- What means "ay, caramba"?
- Oh, yes. I don't know.</i>

432
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:53,027
<i>Through fair or stormy weather</i>

433
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:56,189
<i>We stand close together</i>

434
00:43:56,265 --> 00:43:59,598
<i>Like books on a shelf</i>

435
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:01,068
<i>And pals though we may be</i>

436
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:03,970
<i>When some Latin baby
says yes, no, or maybe</i>

437
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:08,269
<i>Each man is for himself</i>

438
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:05,623
- What's this?
- What's this?

439
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:10,635
This is your gift from Mexico, Donald:
A piñata.

440
00:45:10,706 --> 00:45:16,144
Oh, boy, oh, boy! A piñata!
What's a piñata?

441
00:45:16,212 --> 00:45:19,443
A piñata is full
of surprises, presents.

442
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:21,779
It is the very spirit
of Christmas.

443
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:26,220
<i>Christmas?
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all...</i>

444
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:29,156
No, no, Donald.
For goodness sake.

445
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:32,160
Not "Jingly Bells."

446
00:45:32,228 --> 00:45:34,719
<i>In Mexico, they sing
"Las Posadas."</i>

447
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:41,795
This custom takes place on each
of the nine days before Christmas.

448
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:44,965
Each evening, the children
gather at the village church...

449
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:49,478
and form a procession symbolizing
the journey of Mary and Joseph...

450
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:52,810
from Nazareth to Bethlehem.

451
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:57,216
The little ones carry images
of the saints from house to house...

452
00:45:57,286 --> 00:46:00,847
<i>singing a plea for shelter,
or posada.</i>

453
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:03,858
A reply comes from within:

454
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:06,861
<i>"No posada. No shelter."</i>

455
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:10,558
Looking sad and downhearted,
they try again...

456
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:13,659
but the reply is still the same.

457
00:46:13,736 --> 00:46:16,170
<i>"No shelter. No posada."</i>

458
00:46:17,273 --> 00:46:19,901
They repeat this song
time after time...

459
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:23,605
and always they are refused.

460
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,514
Until at last they reach
a friendly house and the door is opened.

461
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:31,075
"Come in, come in, holy pilgrims.

462
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:33,554
This humble home is yours."

463
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:37,684
And now, Mary and Joseph
have found shelter at last.

464
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,388
Then the rejoicing begins...

465
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:42,863
the feasting,
the celebrating...

466
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:46,231
and finally the biggest
surprise of all:

467
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:48,566
Breaking the piñata.

468
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:53,265
And now for your piñata, Donald.

469
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:55,401
Here you are.
Go to it.

470
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:59,312
One side, boys. One side.
I'm gonna smack it!

471
00:46:59,382 --> 00:47:01,942
Uh-uh, no, hold it.
Ho-Hold it, Donald.

472
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:05,977
First you must be blindfolded.
We have to put this over your eyes.

473
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:09,149
That's part of the tradition.

474
00:47:09,225 --> 00:47:11,591
Now, now, now, stand here.

475
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:14,425
Come here now.
Hit it hard.

476
00:47:14,497 --> 00:47:17,295
All right, let's see you smack it.

477
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:32,137
Just a minute.

478
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:43,819
Uh-oh. Aha!

479
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:32,897
You see, Donald? Didn't I told you
it was full of surprises?

480
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,083
Did you know that the history
of Mexico is in her flag?

481
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:48,988
Oh, yes! You see, many hundreds
of years ago, the god of the Aztecs...

482
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:53,222
commanded them to build
a big city where they would find
an eagle destroying a serpent.

483
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:58,097
But when they find this eagle, he was
sitting on a cactus on top of a rock...

484
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:00,761
way out in the middle of a lake.

485
00:49:00,836 --> 00:49:05,273
<i>¡Caramba.! To build a city here
would be almost imposible.</i>

486
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:09,004
But they built and built
and built some more...

487
00:49:09,078 --> 00:49:13,105
until today, believe it or not,
the lake is full of Mexico City.

488
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,676
<i>Sweet music</i>

489
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:22,281
<i>Gay serenatas</i>

490
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:24,723
<i>Tropic skies</i>

491
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:29,457
<i>Of velvet blue</i>

492
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:33,933
<i>Magic gardens</i>

493
00:49:34,002 --> 00:49:38,530
<i>Perfume the breezes</i>

494
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:42,043
<i>Where true love</i>

495
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:46,069
<i>Brought me to you</i>

496
00:49:47,282 --> 00:49:49,944
<i>Mexico</i>

497
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:53,920
<i>With all your romance</i>

498
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:56,583
<i>Your song oflove</i>

499
00:49:56,658 --> 00:50:01,652
<i>Will live forever after</i>

500
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:05,497
<i>Mexico</i>

501
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:09,628
<i>Sweethearts are singing</i>

502
00:50:09,705 --> 00:50:13,607
<i>Lovebirds are winging</i>

503
00:50:13,675 --> 00:50:19,079
<i>Through a sky
filled with laughter</i>

504
00:50:19,147 --> 00:50:21,980
<i>Paradise</i>

505
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:25,679
<i>That's where I found you</i>

506
00:50:25,754 --> 00:50:28,154
<i>Your magic smile</i>

507
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:34,856
<i>Made the blossoms
bloom around you</i>

508
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,990
<i>Mexico</i>

509
00:50:38,066 --> 00:50:42,162
<i>Why do I feel as I do</i>

510
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:44,432
<i>I simply fell</i>

511
00:50:44,506 --> 00:50:46,838
<i>Under the spell</i>

512
00:50:46,908 --> 00:50:49,934
<i>Of you</i>

513
00:50:50,012 --> 00:50:53,038
<i>- ¡Oba.! ¡Oba.! Nice! Oh, boy!
- Wow!</i>

514
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:58,610
Ah, but this is only the beginning,
amigos. Take a look at this one.

515
00:50:59,855 --> 00:51:02,881
Oh, boy!
What a pretty picture!

516
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,483
And now, for a nice little
trip through Mexico...

517
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,529
on the magic serape.

518
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:13,793
- All aboard, amigos.
- Oh, what's goin' on here?

519
00:51:23,245 --> 00:51:25,975
<i>Paradise</i>

520
00:51:26,048 --> 00:51:30,007
<i>That's where I found you</i>

521
00:51:30,085 --> 00:51:32,747
<i>Your magic smile</i>

522
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:39,226
<i>Made the blossoms
bloom around you</i>

523
00:51:39,294 --> 00:51:42,263
<i>Mexico</i>

524
00:51:42,331 --> 00:51:46,358
<i>Why do I feel as I do</i>

525
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:48,767
<i>I simply fell</i>

526
00:51:48,837 --> 00:51:51,067
<i>Under the spell</i>

527
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:54,575
<i>Of you</i>

528
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:56,838
<i>Of you</i>

529
00:51:56,912 --> 00:51:59,403
And this, Donald,
is Patzcuaro...

530
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:02,109
a fisherman's paradise.

531
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:04,948
Yeah! Beautiful!

532
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,786
Oh, boy! Would I like
to come back sometime...

533
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:11,052
and do a little fishing.

534
00:52:11,126 --> 00:52:12,889
Uh-oh!

535
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:37,115
- What's going on here?
- Shh!

536
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,053
<i>This is my favorite dance,
the "jarabe pateño."</i>

537
00:53:21,029 --> 00:53:23,463
Doggone it!
I can't get it.

538
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:28,166
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, boys!
You are off the beat.

539
00:53:29,337 --> 00:53:31,032
This is the way.

540
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:34,608
Well, what do you know?

541
00:54:13,582 --> 00:54:17,040
Thanks.
I had a wonderful time.

542
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:21,183
So long!

543
00:54:46,448 --> 00:54:48,916
This is the way
they dance in Veracruz.

544
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:51,248
<i>It's called the "lilongo."</i>

545
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:18,745
Hi, girls!
May I cut in?

546
00:55:18,814 --> 00:55:21,442
Watch your step, Donald!

547
00:55:22,484 --> 00:55:24,816
Some fun, hey, kid?

548
00:55:34,863 --> 00:55:36,558
So you like dancing, huh?

549
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:38,599
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:41,397
Go on, Donald.
Don't be afraid.

551
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:43,495
Not so fast, boys.

552
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:46,132
Go on in, Donald.
Don't be bashful.

553
00:55:48,009 --> 00:55:52,105
Hi, toots!
Am I intruding?

554
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:58,913
Hey, Donald, you are
what they say, off the cob!

555
00:55:58,987 --> 00:56:01,854
- You know, corny.
- Oh, yeah?

556
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:35,948
Swing me
with that boogie beat, Joe!

557
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:45,964
How am I doin', toots?

558
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:32,775
Come on, let me down.

559
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:35,611
- I wanna stay!
- Take it easy, Donald.

560
00:57:50,464 --> 00:57:53,433
There she is...
Acapulco Beach...

561
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:55,935
the Riviera of Mexico.

562
00:57:56,003 --> 00:58:00,064
Take the telescope and have a look at
what you might call the hot stuff.

563
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,906
Oh, boy! Am I going
to like this place.

564
00:58:08,516 --> 00:58:12,452
Oh, boy! Hot stuff!

565
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:45,078
I'll be right down, toots.

566
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:57,253
- Hello, my sweet little
bathing beauties.
- Donald! Donald!

567
00:58:58,532 --> 00:59:01,467
<i>We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros</i>

568
00:59:01,535 --> 00:59:04,629
<i>They say we are
birds of a feather</i>

569
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,774
Where's Donald?

570
00:59:12,846 --> 00:59:17,283
Aha! I am a son of a gun. Look at
the little wolf in duck's clothings.

571
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:20,320
Come to Papa.

572
00:59:20,387 --> 00:59:22,617
Wha-What's going on here?

573
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:26,488
Come here, you little rascals.

574
00:59:27,628 --> 00:59:30,119
Now I've got ya. Uh-oh.

575
00:59:38,806 --> 00:59:41,036
Doggone this confusion!

576
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:48,339
Oops! Where is she?

577
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:52,051
Come here, my little enchilada.

578
00:59:54,788 --> 00:59:56,915
I've got you this time, tootsie.

579
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,921
Peek-a-boo.
I see you.

580
01:00:09,436 --> 01:00:11,495
Hey, where am I?

581
01:00:18,912 --> 01:00:21,176
My, my, my!

582
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:25,009
Ain't this fun?

583
01:00:40,934 --> 01:00:42,959
Here I come!

584
01:00:43,037 --> 01:00:45,597
This time I'm gonna get you!

585
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:53,143
Oh, no, no, no, Donald!
Don't do that!

586
01:00:55,382 --> 01:00:58,647
Let me go. Get me outta here!
You can't do this to me.

587
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:01,984
Get your hands off of me!
This is a free country.

588
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:06,416
Bye-bye!

589
01:01:08,062 --> 01:01:11,259
So you like pretty girls, huh?

590
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:13,925
Let's go!

591
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:16,765
- Let me go!
- Don't ruffle your feathers, Donald!

592
01:01:16,837 --> 01:01:20,273
Look, I will show you
the nightlife of Mexico City.

593
01:01:21,909 --> 01:01:24,173
- Beautiful, no?
- Colossal!

594
01:01:24,244 --> 01:01:27,338
Oh, boy! Mexico City?

595
01:01:27,414 --> 01:01:30,110
Very beautiful city.

596
01:01:30,184 --> 01:01:32,311
Careful, Donald.

597
01:01:32,386 --> 01:01:35,723
Even the sky is full of romantic!

598
01:01:35,723 --> 01:01:41,320
<i>You belong to my heart</i>

599
01:01:41,528 --> 01:01:45,862
<i>- She's beautiful!
- Now and forever</i>

600
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:50,495
<i>- And our love had its start
- Oh, boy!</i>

601
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:55,531
<i>Not long ago</i>

602
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:58,339
<i>We were gathering stars</i>

603
01:01:58,412 --> 01:02:04,351
<i>While a million guitars
played our love song</i>

604
01:02:04,418 --> 01:02:08,479
<i>When I said "I love you"
every beat of my heart</i>

605
01:02:08,555 --> 01:02:11,956
<i>- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Said it too</i>

606
01:02:12,025 --> 01:02:16,553
<i>'Twas a moment like this</i>

607
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:20,691
<i>Do you remember</i>

608
01:02:20,768 --> 01:02:25,171
<i>And your eyes threw a kiss</i>

609
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:30,336
<i>When they met mine</i>

610
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:33,174
<i>Now we own all the stars</i>

611
01:02:33,247 --> 01:02:39,186
<i>And a million guitars
are still playing</i>

612
01:02:39,253 --> 01:02:41,414
<i>Darling, you are the song</i>

613
01:02:41,488 --> 01:02:46,084
<i>And you'll always belong
to my heart</i>

<i>'Twas a moment like this</i>

615
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:24,558
<i>- Do you remember
- Uh-huh.</i>

616
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:28,795
<i>And your eyes threw a kiss</i>

617
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:33,363
<i>- When they met mine
- Don't do that!</i>

618
01:03:34,341 --> 01:03:36,969
<i>Now we own all the stars</i>

619
01:03:37,044 --> 01:03:42,107
<i>And a million guitars
are still playing</i>

<i>And you'll always belong
to my heart</i>

622
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:18,845
<i>You belong</i>

623
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,821
<i>To my heart</i>

624
01:04:21,889 --> 01:04:26,349

<i>Every beat of my heart
said it too</i>

629
01:04:44,278 --> 01:04:46,303
- Some fun, hey, kid?

<i>And you'll always
belong to my heart</i>

637
01:05:50,811 --> 01:05:53,245
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.

638
01:05:53,314 --> 01:05:55,339
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.

639
01:06:05,493 --> 01:06:07,927
What? Oh, boy!

640
01:06:21,342 --> 01:06:22,639
Uh-oh.

641
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:09,315
Uh, what's happening, anyway?
Where am I?

642
01:07:14,528 --> 01:07:16,018
Uh-oh!

643
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:29,269
My, my!

644
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:47,192
Uh-oh.

645
01:08:05,746 --> 01:08:07,373
What?

646
01:08:20,394 --> 01:08:22,021
What?

647
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:25,359
What?

648
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,534
<i>Come on, torito,
give it to me!</i>

649
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:15,200
What's the matter with you?
Are you color-blind?

650
01:10:26,119 --> 01:10:28,849
Come on, bull. You bashful?

651
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:58,251
<i>Oh, through fair or stormy weather</i>

652
01:10:59,987 --> 01:11:02,820
