1
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,313
Just to show you that I have a good heart...

2
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:32,619
...I'll give you a ticket for some
mouthwash, because you got halitosis.

3
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,951
I'm gonna raise you a dollar in food stamps.

4
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,926
There's a job at Haley's Car Wash.

5
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,620
You're not going to get it.

6
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,066
I'd like to call the hurry-up squad.
I've got a good hand.

7
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,727
What is this dog thing?
Nobody wants...

8
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,336
Who put that in?

9
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,841
There's a lot. I got two dogs.

10
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,010
Bring them down.
We'll barbecue them.

11
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,011
I'll do that.
You can eat them.

12
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,593
You're lucky it's not a cat.

13
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,055
Put some Alpo coupons in.
That's good food.

14
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,358
Pure horse meat.
Doesn't shrivel in the skillet.

15
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,360
You can spread it on bread.

16
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,863
Are we gonna play?
What have you got?

17
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,966
I got a straight.
I almost got a straight.

18
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,570
Let me see your straight.
- A pair of sevens.

19
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,670
I got a pair of nines.

20
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,154
There are five, six puppies.

21
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,036
How you doing?
- Hi, baby.

22
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,850
Can I take something?

23
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,942
Take this.
- What can I get?

24
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,755
You can get lost, Clifford.
- I like that. Get lost.

25
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,865
Jack.
- How about a one-on-one, little man?

26
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,685
It's all right with me, big man.

27
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,670
Feel the ball. Bounce it.

28
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,770
Jack.
- Let me have it.

29
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,880
Can't you play the game?

30
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,015
Are you gonna do that every time?

31
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,417
Jack, your army buddy
came to my office today.

32
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:16,447
It was very embarrassing.
He's gonna auction off the house.

33
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:21,027
He's gonna auction off the house.
- My parents gave it to me.

34
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,729
They gave you the mortgage.

35
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,599
You know it's mine.
- We haven't paid in six months.

36
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,970
I haven't finished the book.
When I do, I'll get the money.

37
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,875
Would you stop about the book?
- Angela, you know I'm a writer.

38
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,579
Yes, darling. You're a writer.
A very good writer.

39
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,614
I am a writer, right?
- He is.

40
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,094
Everybody, ain't I a writer?

41
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,725
Stanley.

42
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,098
Register at the desk
if you want to take the class.

43
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,068
I want to see my friend
before he goes to work.

44
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,168
Jack, get out of here.

45
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,778
Why are you upsetting Angela,
telling her you're selling my house?

46
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,853
You're not going to sell it, right?

47
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,172
The house belongs to the bank...

48
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,325
...unless you come up
with a quick 10 grand.

49
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:29,996
I'm trying to stop them, but I can't
help if you don't have a job.

50
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,365
So get a job and get out, Jack.

51
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,201
I have a job.
Writing a book is a job.

52
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:39,072
Writing a book is a cop-out, Jack.
Now get a job.

53
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,442
A paying job will convince
them of your sincerity...

54
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,443
...and your honest intentions.

55
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,280
Ticklish.

56
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,650
Now why don't you get a job?
And don't touch me.

57
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,405
No physical contact.
We'll lose our license.

58
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,659
Get out of here, will you?
You're disrupting the cast.

59
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,091
Just get out. Out. Out.

60
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,231
Get a job. Get a job. Get a job.

61
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,075
Hey, brother. Where you going?

62
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,066
Where you going?
- Clifford, I'm here for a job.

63
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,269
What do you think we're in line for?
- The bus.

64
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,873
No. The job. I'll tell you
what to do. Just a moment.

65
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,810
All you waiting on the job?
- Yeah. Get your bicycle.

66
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,813
Okay? There you go,
to the end of the line.

67
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,163
If you can't find it,
come back to the front again.

68
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,851
Watch the cars.

69
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,523
Oh, my God.
He's gonna hit that man.

70
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:43,256
Come on, Shorty. Come on.
Watch yourself. Come on.

71
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,429
There you go. Good boy.

72
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,394
Hey. What, you crazy idiot.

73
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,239
Yeah. No. Instruments? No.

74
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,947
Cleaning lady?
Cleaning lady?

75
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,192
Hey. Halt.

76
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,753
Hey, pops. What do you need?

77
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,139
Want to keep an eye on this for me?

78
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,469
Hi, foxy lady.
- Thank you very much.

79
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,473
A quarter. I'll buy a car.

80
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,448
I have a job for you. You mind?
- Not at all.

81
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,619
Hold those while I get in. Bless your
heart. Good luck to you. Thank you.

82
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,221
Not for you.
- It's a free country.

83
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,857
That's Fancy Bates.
- His daughter?

84
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,261
Wife numero three.
- You think she is ready?

85
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,251
Ready for what?
- Black experience.

86
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,465
You ready?

87
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,894
Take it easy, Fancy.

88
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,972
Miss Jackie Brown.

89
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,058
Is there no Miss Jackie Brown?

90
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,737
That's me.
- Miss Jackie Brown.

91
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:11,250
I got it.
- Not you. We need a part-time woman.

92
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,754
I can be a part-time woman.
I'm a part-time woman.

93
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,656
Jackie Brown.

94
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,592
Man, no jive. This is...
That's good.

95
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,596
That's very good.
You're what we call 'overqualified.'

96
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:28,568
Mr. Brown, we're looking for a woman
to do a little part-time cleaning...

97
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,736
...and you're a journalist.

98
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,906
Go see the people in Mr. Bates' newspaper.

99
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,406
<i>The Bugle.
They aren't hiring any blacks.</i>

100
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,002
Is this a protest?

101
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,811
You're not starting a sit-in, are you?

102
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,184
I just want a job.

103
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,319
Here's your Phi Beta. I'm sorry.

104
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,255
I can do anything a woman can do.
Almost.

105
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,995
No. Answer's no.

106
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,325
No now. No tomorrow. No next week.

107
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,298
No next month. No next year.

108
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,542
You know what I like about
this outfit, Mr. Morehouse?

109
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,735
Its open-mindedness.

110
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:16,015
I think you're trouble.
Mr. Bates doesn't want any trouble.

111
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,319
Thank you for coming. My secretary
will give you a parking validation.

112
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:25,288
I'm not trouble.
My girlfriend, she's trouble.

113
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,295
Is she foxy?
What kind of trouble could she be?

114
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,390
Oh, she's a legal staff
for the local Klanwatch.

115
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,931
She's very litigious.

116
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,103
Litigious.

117
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,158
She sues people?
- Like in court.

118
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,578
Why don't you sit down?
You don't want this job.

119
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,613
No. I'll be truthful with you.

120
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:52,151
You'd have to come in two days,
on Tuesdays and Fridays...

121
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,587
...to serve a staff luncheon.

122
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,982
I waited tables in college.

123
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:01,861
Every weeknight you have to clean
the window displays for three hours.

124
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,761
I'll take it.
- Is it that bad out there?

125
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,965
Worse.

126
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,504
How attached are you to that beard?

127
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:16,409
I'm not gonna vacuum with my beard.
That's the '60s. This is the '80s.

128
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,579
You see, we're part
of Mr. Bates' family here.

129
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,714
And none of us have beards.

130
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,612
I will not be denied, Sidney.

131
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,822
She's busy.
Come back about 3 o'clock.

132
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:33,187
I'm looking for Miss Ruby D. Simpson.

133
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,962
That's me.
What do you want?

134
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,272
I'm the new cleaning lady.

135
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,905
Lord, have mercy.
Morehouse done flipped his wig.

136
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,215
I'm the new cleaning lady.

137
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,459
Come on, honey. Walk this way.

138
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
Move it.

139
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,288
He's gonna want to see all of this.
So you know your job.

140
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,768
You want to be ready, right?

141
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,458
Chicken, Mr. Morehouse?

142
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,902
Please get some pants on
before Mr. Bates sees you, okay?

143
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,002
Okay, pilgrim.

144
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,121
Good morning, U.S.

145
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,326
How are you, U. S?
- Pretty good.

146
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,362
Mr. U.S., phone.
- No calls. Time is money.

147
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,293
It's your son.
- Excuse me.

148
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Time is money.

149
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,003
Hello, Eric.

150
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,172
How was the flight?

151
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,899
Good. Good.

152
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:03,082
I'm glad you're here.
We're gonna have a wonderful week.

153
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,616
And anything you want.

154
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,181
Anything. Absolutely.

155
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,517
Okay, son. I'll see you.

156
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,416
That's my tomato salad.
- I'm sorry.

157
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,815
No, my salad.

158
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,076
Mine had four eggs on it.

159
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,542
I can... I can go help fix this.

160
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,692
I can fix this.

161
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,121
Excuse me, Mr. Morehouse.

162
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,010
I'm sorry, U.S. Goes back to you.

163
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,133
No, these other people got to eat.

164
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,552
Me, U. S?

165
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,208
He wants to talk to you.
Go on down there.

166
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,485
Cover your lip. Mustache.

167
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,863
Cover your lip.

168
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,257
Sorry, Mr. Bates.

169
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,847
You're very strong for a little lady.

170
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,731
And you have a lot of hair on your lip.

171
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,884
We don't like our waitresses
to have hairy lips.

172
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,360
You see, I noticed...

173
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,835
Tell you what. Shave.
- Shave?

174
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,466
And after you shave, you're fired.

175
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,105
Thank you, Mr. Bates.

176
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:00,618
No, I can do it.
I can do it, Mr. Bates.

177
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,436
What did he say?
- What a great man.

178
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:14,996
He says I'm sexy and he loves the chicken.

179
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,477
Know what I mean, soul brother?

180
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,239
Power to the people. Right on.

181
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,794
Here we are, young man.
Shall I wait?

182
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,942
Give me a hand.
Somebody give me a hand.

183
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,205
Let's see, hand, football.

184
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,051
Do I have to stay? I'm an accountant.
Will he exceed his credit?

185
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,686
We gotta win this one.

186
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,890
There's six seconds or we
don't win the Super Bowl.

187
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,626
I didn't come this far to lose, okay?

188
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,191
He's fired. Did you fire him?

189
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,255
I didn't fire him.
You're the ones...

190
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,403
Go deep. Swing left on blue, okay?

191
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,370
On six. On three. On two.

192
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,841
Be ready. Somebody get Matoussac.

193
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,900
Okay. 36, 44, on blue.

194
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,013
Go for it.

195
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,154
I'm okay.

196
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,415
Blue, 26, 32.

197
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,631
It's always my toy department.
Why can't he get into stereos?

198
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:50,236
Or something we don't even sell.
- We sell everything.

199
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,075
Don't know my own strength.

200
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,475
'Danger. Do not touch.'

201
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,391
Wonder Wheel.

202
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,068
Looks like a job for me.

203
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,502
Wonder Wheel.

204
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,602
This is great.

205
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,936
Bounces. Dance on it.

206
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,489
<i>What's so dangerous about...</i>

207
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,181
It doesn't work.
That's why it's dangerous.

208
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,281
It works.

209
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:45,150
Wonder Wheel. Stop.
I admit it, it works.

210
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,659
Okay. Stop, Wonder Wheel.

211
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,626
Nice Wonder Wheel. Stop.

212
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,203
Stop the Wonder Wheel.

213
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,898
Help. Wonder Wheel.

214
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,744
I'm the Wonder Wheel
champion of the world.

215
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,813
Miracle Wonder Wheel.
The best one.

216
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,116
The best...

217
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,021
Wonder Wheel, no. Wonder Wheel...

218
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:19,324
Come on. Don't, you can't.
We've been through too much together.

219
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,086
Come on. Come on, Wonder Wheel.

220
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,294
Come on, you can do it.

221
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,833
I don't want to be
a Wonder-Wheel murderer.

222
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,269
I want you to play with kids.

223
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,174
You haven't even been to the zoo.

224
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,670
You never even touched water.

225
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:39,259
Come on, Wonder Wheel.
Where's your heart?

226
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,698
I know what I want.
- He likes it.

227
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,538
Let's blow it up right away.
- The black man.

228
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,072
He wants one in black, all right?

229
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:11,233
The black man.
- He wants the black man.

230
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,607
No, Eric, no. Not today.
Not now. Not ever.

231
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,441
Yes.
- He's not a toy.

232
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,721
He's trouble. See the mustache?
I asked him to shave.

233
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:27,226
I really don't care.
- He's one of our cleaning people.

234
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,394
I want him.
- He's not for sale.

235
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,395
Why not?
- Because he's a person.

236
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,068
Daddy said anything I wanted,
anything in the store.

237
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,398
You can't buy a human, Eric.
- Why not?

238
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,538
Because...

239
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,343
It's against the law, isn't it?

240
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,674
Doesn't my daddy make the laws?

241
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,180
I think he's got a point there.

242
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,386
Mr. Morehouse.

243
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,322
Now.

244
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,058
It's your department.

245
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,584
Good choice.
- You'll have a wonderful time.

246
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,501
Tim, Toys.
- Jack, Windows.

247
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,764
Remember me?
- I'm fired, right?

248
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,273
No, no.
Do you see that kid over there?

249
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,616
He's the son of our...
- Boss.

250
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,821
He's bright.
- I see the resemblance.

251
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,759
He'd like to take you home with him.
- Why?

252
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,427
It's just a joke.

253
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:39,898
What, is he sick? Nuts, right?
What are we talking about?

254
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,228
He's just used to getting his own way.

255
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,328
You guys are serious.
- No jive.

256
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,775
You want me to go with him?
- Lf you wouldn't mind.

257
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,478
I mind.
- I don't want him to get angry here.

258
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,581
He can do a lot of damage.

259
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,116
I don't care. I'm not going anywhere.

260
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,518
No, sir. Not me.

261
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,918
No now. No tomorrow. No next week.
I'm not...

262
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,647
No. As you say, you know?

263
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:10,003
I think we have to butter your bread.

264
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,066
You can't...
I can't be bought.

265
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,603
This got settled in the Civil War.
You can't have slaves.

266
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:21,639
We just want to rent you for a little while.

267
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,410
What is your hourly rate?
- I don't have...

268
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,545
By the hour.

269
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,082
I don't have to stay long?

270
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,555
You'll give a decent
burial to Wonder Wheel?

271
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,423
Yes.
- That's my friend.

272
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,981
This is light.
Thank you.

273
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,331
It's a little light here.
Thank you.

274
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,431
A little light.

275
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,902
Very pleased to meet you.

276
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,672
This is Eric.
Eric, he has agreed.

277
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:57,342
His name is Jack Brown.
Jack, Master Bates.

278
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,315
Wrap him up.

279
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,078
Wrap who up?
I don't get wrapped.

280
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:11,056
I can't be wrapped unless you have
ribbon or something soft.

281
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,156
This is still light.

282
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,695
Elbows off the table.

283
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,767
Sit up, Eric.

284
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,810
Now, Eric, our stomachs digest
our food a lot better...

285
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,847
...if we eat some vegetables,
some starch and some meat.

286
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:40,112
In that order. Not all
the vegetables at one time.

287
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,221
I hate liver.
- I only understand German.

288
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,321
I hate German.

289
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,491
Well, Eric...

290
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,296
...it certainly is a pleasure to have you.

291
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,899
Now, what do you want to do first?

292
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,435
Six Flags? Delta Queen? New Orleans?

293
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,526
You know, I have a new helicopter.

294
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,044
How's school?

295
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,582
How's your math?

296
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,988
How are the boys?

297
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,064
Does Fancy have to come
to Six Flags with us?

298
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,201
Certainly not. Do you want
Barkley to take you?

299
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,701
I want you to take me.

300
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:39,117
Eric, I've got a surprise for you.
Your present's arrived.

301
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,646
Not until you finish your meal.

302
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,814
Now just a minute here.

303
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,120
Boys will be boys, God bless him.

304
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,465
Finish your dinner.
- Get me a hammer.

305
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,268
Not until you eat.
- Get me a hammer.

306
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,271
If you don't come and finish your dinner...

307
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,740
...you won't open that until tomorrow.

308
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Are you crazy?

309
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,047
What's going on in here?

310
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:20,986
She won't help me open my present.
She won't give me a hammer.

311
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,453
What the hell is that?
- Help.

312
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,859
You said I could have anything.

313
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,688
Help, please. I need air.

314
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,897
Schatzie, get a hammer.

315
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,925
Can I have some air?
- Who are you?

316
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:43,801
I'm the new part-time cleaning lady,
sir, at the store.

317
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,345
What are you doing in there?

318
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,148
Your son came along and asked them...

319
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,818
...to wrap me up, which they did,
in a box.

320
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,918
This box.

321
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:01,451
I hope you have a good explanation for this.

322
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,505
You said anything in the store.
Well, he was in the store.

323
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,489
I get to open it. It's my present.

324
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,669
What?

325
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Hurry.

326
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,109
Please hurry.

327
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,568
Didn't I tell you to shave?

328
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,831
Sorry.
- Sir.

329
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,239
Sorry, sir.

330
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,838
I mean, come here.
- No way.

331
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,863
Wait a minute.
Let's not be too hasty.

332
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,184
I'll pay you on an hourly basis.
- Sir.

333
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,794
All right, I'll pay you on an hourly basis, sir.

334
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,894
No.

335
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,833
What sort of a position are you looking for?

336
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:19,233
Slave sound too crass?
- I'm serious.

337
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,106
I am too.
I'm a journalist.

338
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,242
I've been trying to get
a job on your newspaper.

339
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,079
The only black people you hire
do windows, mop floors...

340
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,651
I don't like it. I tried it.
Believe me, I have dignity.

341
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:36,236
Take those firecrackers and...
Never mind.

342
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:43,589
That's not the way out.
- Go get him, Daddy.

343
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,626
Wait. What's your name?
- Jack Brown.

344
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,102
I only have the boy for one week a year.

345
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,039
Get better lawyers. That's too long.

346
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,802
I love him.
- Frankly, I don't give a damn.

347
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,280
He wants you to stay.
- He wants to see if you can make me.

348
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,525
He's manipulative. It's a power play.

349
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:10,121
You know, if you were
a little less hysterical...

350
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,693
...you'd suggest I pay you
what I pay my reporters for a week.

351
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,762
$400.
- For babysitting?

352
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,363
Step in my office.

353
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,772
Isn't that a magnificent
arrangement of dominoes?

354
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,872
It's really something.

355
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:34,145
It took me over a month to set it up.
- A month? Wow.

356
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,625
It's rewarding. Have a seat.

357
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:50,560
I'm a man who gets what he wants
by patience.

358
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,705
Some people exercise
their tibias or fibulas...

359
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,234
I exercise my patience.

360
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,913
Patience.

361
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,386
No hole.

362
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:18,481
Just bite the end off.
And spit it in your hand.

363
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:31,401
Eric's not a bad boy.
High-spirited. I like that.

364
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,405
I like him.

365
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,107
You'll like him.
- I'm crazy about him.

366
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:40,045
He should understand that money
means never being sorry.

367
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:44,104
That's about the only thing
he does understand.

368
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,558
That's not an ashtray, you asshole.

369
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,887
That's an ashtray.

370
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,099
What you're offering me isn't a job.
It's an insult.

371
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,430
I'm insulted and I'm splitting.

372
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,465
All right, what do you need?

373
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,808
I need?

374
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,903
$10,000.
- Ten...

375
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,648
You're not a reporter.
You're a crook.

376
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,851
You didn't ask me what I'd settle for.

377
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:24,854
That's what I meant.
- Let's start at 1000 and work up.

378
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,758
That's highway robbery.

379
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,828
<i>I'd settle for $400 and a job on The Bugle.</i>

380
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,897
There isn't any job on the paper.

381
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,231
1500.
- Deal.

382
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,695
2000.
- Now, wait a minute.

383
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,473
We had a deal.

384
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:45,343
Two-five.
- Fine, but for that kind of money...

385
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,673
...if Eric blows his nose,
you wipe it.

386
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,273
3000.
- Two-five.

387
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,178
Two-seven.
- Two-five is my top.

388
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,253
$3000.
- I wonder if Eric knows...

389
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,226
...what kind of bastard he's getting.

390
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,556
I may be a bastard, Mr. Bates,
but l...

391
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,819
I'll kill you.
- Two-five is fine.

392
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,487
Two-five is excellent.

393
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,612
Are you at the store?

394
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,985
Well, where are you?
At U.S. Bates' house?

395
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,831
The U.S. Bates' house?
Clifford, hold it down.

396
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:44,402
I'm working for U.S. Bates.
- 'I'm working for U.S. Bates.'

397
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,970
Not on the paper...

398
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,438
A toy?

399
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:52,210
I'm U.S. Bates' toy. I'm not stoned.
- Let's play. Get off the phone.

400
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,514
No, he's not playing with me.
I'm his son's toy, Eric.

401
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,017
He's got a son and he hired me...

402
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:03,254
He's one of the nicest kids
I've ever met. He's really...

403
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,557
Play with me.
- He's wonderful.

404
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,793
Ask me how much I'm making.
- Get off the phone.

405
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,162
Get off the phone.
- Just ask me.

406
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:15,460
$2500 a week.
- Get off the phone.

407
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:20,394
Say goodbye. Come on.
- He's a wonderful...

408
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,309
He's just wonderful.
- You're paid to play, not to talk.

409
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,011
Just a minute. How old are you?
- Nine.

410
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,478
You want to live to be 10?
Do you?

411
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:40,218
Fancy.
- Wait until I'm done, U.S.

412
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,462
I've got to talk to you.
- But I'm busy.

413
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,707
What I have to tell you is important.

414
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:53,232
What am I supposed to do?
- How do you turn off this machine?

415
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,798
Oh, sugar. I like it like that.

416
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:11,115
That was fun.
- Please. I have a headache.

417
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,124
I've got something to say.

418
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:17,562
Is it about the party?
Everything's arranged beautifully.

419
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,662
It's about Eric.

420
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,798
Oh, God.
Has it been a year already?

421
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,127
I forgot it was his week.

422
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:30,657
What do I have to do with him?
Take him to Six Flags?

423
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,642
He...

424
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,178
He bought a black man.

425
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:41,886
I wasn't aware that we sold them.
- I wanted you to know...

426
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:45,356
...so you wouldn't be frightened
if you saw him.

427
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:50,301
There's a black man in this house?
- It's only for a week.

428
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:54,931
But why?
- To play with, he says.

429
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,768
To aggravate you and me, I say.

430
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,909
Heaven forbid. You just
tell him no, you ass.

431
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,103
That's U.S., not 'you ass.'

432
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:11,506
Well, I'm just gonna take a shower,
U.S.

433
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,766
Look out.

434
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,959
My bedroom's over here.

435
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,673
I am Swiss. I know nothing.
Oh, Eric.

436
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,754
This is fun, Jack.
- Fun?

437
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,184
Look out.

438
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:16,614
I didn't figure your weight
in the turn. Great ride, though.

439
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:20,114
Are you all right, Master Bates?
Are you?

440
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,681
Jesus Christ. Are you crazy?

441
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,357
What are you doing?

442
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,347
Stop making faces.
Leave him alone.

443
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,825
Here's a hat. Now put it on.
Let's go.

444
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,168
Give him a ticket. Put it on.

445
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,268
I'm Eric Bates.

446
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,773
Chop, chop. Give him a ticket.

447
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,575
What's going on?
What do you mean?

448
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:48,873
Is everybody like this?
Does this go on every day?

449
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,480
You can't talk.
- He's clean.

450
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,986
Thank you. That's more than the floor is.

451
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,355
Know what's on that floor?
- No.

452
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,455
Your dinner.

453
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,628
That was my dinner?
That was my dinner, Shirley Temple.

454
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,330
I don't care. Get in.
- You don't...

455
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,302
Got a license to drive on the steps?
- I don't need one. I'm Eric Bates.

456
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,805
You'll learn the hard way, laddie.

457
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:18,433
I'm U.S. Bates' son.
- You got a jail around here?

458
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,378
A jail?
- Yes.

459
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:24,048
On the left.
- I'm Eric Bates. Put me down.

460
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,312
In the slammer, mammer.

461
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:37,586
Jack. Let me out of here.
Barkley, you're fired.

462
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,031
Well-played. Congratulations.

463
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,935
Could you fix me a cheeseburger?
- What's going on?

464
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,804
I didn't hear anything.
- What's going on?

465
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,135
He was driving down the steps.

466
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:54,078
I don't want this job.
I'm gonna lose it anyways.

467
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,047
Dad. Dad.

468
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,082
Calm down, calm down. Calm down.

469
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,619
What's going on?
- It's my fault.

470
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,654
My fault, sir.
- No, my fault.

471
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,423
Yes, it's his fault.

472
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,492
No, now Jack...
Daddy, we were...

473
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,218
...just playing.

474
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:15,923
Right, Jack?
- Yeah, we were just playing a game.

475
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,968
Just playing, Daddy.

476
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,996
Come on, Jack. Let's go play
some more games.

477
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,374
Come on, Jack.

478
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,546
Clean this up.
- Yes, thank you.

479
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:32,386
There's a party about to happen.
- Thank you.

480
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,837
Why did you stick up for me?
- I want you to stay.

481
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:38,723
Why did you stick up for me?
- I want you to stay.

482
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:43,728
Why? Does it mean anything to you
that I don't want to stay?

483
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,832
Lf you're paid enough, you'll stay.
- That's not the question.

484
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,822
Daddy's giving you a lot of money.

485
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,397
That has no significance here.
Understand?

486
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,907
I am talking about, I have pets.
I have friends.

487
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,774
I got 16 plants, and my lady.

488
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:07,251
Your old lady won't mind.
- My old lady? No.

489
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,649
My lady.
- Put this on.

490
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,999
A costume?
This is for a short person.

491
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,865
I need something that fits.
- I bought some for Barkley.

492
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,624
Maybe they'd fit you.
- Maybe.

493
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,867
Let's go play a game.
- 'Let's go play a game.'

494
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,967
Come on.
- 'Come on.'

495
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,027
'Got some for Barkley.'

496
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,970
<i>Keep your hands up.
Protect yourself at all times.</i>

497
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,180
Box the robot.

498
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,105
This is better than Disneyland.
You know that?

499
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:48,288
<i>Keep your hands up.
Protect yourself at all times.</i>

500
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,901
<i>Keep your hands up.
Protect yourself at all times.</i>

501
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,770
Come on. Get up.

502
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,087
Are you all right?

503
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,246
Let's go play the game.

504
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,016
<i>Foul. Foul. Foul.
- What game?</i>

505
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,690
The air hockey game. Come on.

506
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,894
You ready? I'm gonna win, right?

507
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:32,603
You're not gonna win.
- Lf you win, you can go home with pay.

508
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,703
For the week?
- Sure.

509
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:39,837
$2500 for a couple of hours?
- Sure. Why not?

510
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,749
What's Money Bucks gonna think?
- I can deal with my daddy.

511
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,852
You can't deal with me.
I was very good.

512
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,587
I'm pretty good.

513
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:54,158
Let's say every goal I get,
you have to stay another year.

514
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,994
For every goal? Okay.
- That's one year.

515
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,664
I wasn't ready.
- So? I make the rules.

516
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,144
That's one year.
- You cheat.

517
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,665
Two years.
- I wasn't ready.

518
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:10,026
I'm the king of ghetto hockey.
You ain't gonna beat me.

519
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:16,290
Watch it, watch it, watch it.
Tricker. One year. That's one.

520
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,218
Come back. The game's not over.
- I'm not playing.

521
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:25,623
You're gonna quit because
I was winning? You hate to lose?

522
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,225
I don't feel like playing anymore.

523
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,228
What if I tell your dad?
- He doesn't care.

524
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,298
He doesn't care his son is a quitter?

525
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:39,413
He doesn't care what I am,
as long as I stay out of his way.

526
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,439
My little dove, it's bath time.
- I'm busy.

527
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,703
Come on now. The water's ready.
- No.

528
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,211
Hello, Mr. Brown.

529
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,079
Now. This minute.
- Not without my toy.

530
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:58,042
Good boy. You want your submarine?

531
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:03,091
No. Jack.
- Oh, no. I'll tell your father.

532
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,197
Does everybody around here say that?

533
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,762
I'm not gonna say it anymore.

534
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:16,307
Not you. You can take a bath
in my room and I'll wash you.

535
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,944
Meet you later.
- My room is the second door...

536
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:24,913
What are you doing?
- Wow, this is... Are you kidding me?

537
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,620
I wanted a pool
but Dad said it was dangerous.

538
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,690
It's great. Look at all...
- Don't touch.

539
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,993
It's Mr. Bates' collection and I'm in charge.

540
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,824
Now, Eric, you get in the tub.
And you, out.

541
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,467
Eric, you're too big to bathe
with another naked man.

542
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,439
She's right.
You shouldn't bathe with a naked man.

543
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,133
I forbid you. Oh, God.

544
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,110
Here we go.

545
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,202
Oh, my God.
- Do my back.

546
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,847
Mr. Bates.

547
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:04,247
<i>It Came from the Tub,
starring Eric Bates as 'It.'</i>

548
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,455
I like you.

549
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,997
No, you don't.

550
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:23,407
Let me guess. You're the new
second-floor sprinkler system.

551
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:27,672
I'm Jack Brown.
I'm sorry I messed up your carpet.

552
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:31,215
I wouldn't think this would
tickle a grown man.

553
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,315
Amazing.

554
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,982
What people will do for money.

555
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,929
Who do they think they are?

556
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,787
I'll kill him.
I'll pull his head off. I'll get him.

557
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,557
Well, here they are now.
- Hi, U.S. How are you?

558
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,857
I'm fine. How are you?

559
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,638
Fancy, you look so good tonight.
- Hi, sugar-pie.

560
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:32,810
I'm glad to see you. Look at those
bracelets. Where did you get them?

561
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,478
These old things?

562
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:38,682
The word I get is that
they're going to indict you.

563
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,410
Oh. State or federal?

564
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:46,647
Federal. Now where's that
limey of yours with the bourbon?

565
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,857
Barkley.

566
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:52,028
Your bourbon, my lords.

567
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,154
Thank you, my lords.

568
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:04,375
A federal case? Maybe we ought to run
a little party for the senator.

569
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:09,647
I always thought that they conducted
their proms in an excellent manner.

570
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:13,784
It used to be my pleasure
to buy the band uniforms.

571
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,054
And each year,
we'd have a different color.

572
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,791
Do you know why they're
having a party downstairs?

573
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:24,156
Because it's goodbye for you guys.

574
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,265
It's called a 'wrap party.'
This is all for you guys.

575
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,434
They're not selling you anymore.

576
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:34,171
They got a new toy to sell
called the 'Jack Brown.'

577
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:37,141
Me, the wind-up asshole.
Yes, that's me.

578
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,178
I'm taking over all of the stores
next Christmas.

579
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:46,517
Kids will holler for me. They won't
want no teddy bears like you.

580
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:50,421
And they won't want no sad pandas.
And no camels.

581
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,324
No tigers, leopards, lions, rabbits.

582
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:58,596
And orangutans. You understand?
Kids will want a Jack Brown wind-up.

583
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:04,051
'Mommy, I want a Jack Brown wind-up.
Suzy's can play basketball.

584
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,896
Otto's can drive a Cadillac.

585
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:10,574
He's real cute too
and I want to pinch his nose.'

586
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:16,113
That's what I've done to myself.
I sold out to Morehouse, you know?

587
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:21,823
I'll end up in this room with
all you toys for the rest of my life.

588
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,825
What the hell is that?

589
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,459
Jesus. What the...

590
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,034
Why...

591
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:44,408
You think that's funny?
What do you think of this?

592
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:48,000
Goodbye. I want my clothes.

593
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,340
'Goodbye. I want my clothes.'

594
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,548
I want my clothes.

595
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:55,717
I want my clothes.

596
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:02,163
I'm not kidding.
- 'I want my clothes. I'm not kidding.'

597
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:11,333
I want my clothes.
- Mr. Brown. Now sit down for a minute.

598
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:15,020
They're in the dryer,
and they're all wet.

599
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,542
Now tell me something.
Are you brown all over?

600
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:23,978
You can talk dirty, if you like.
I'll jump on top of you.

601
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:29,386
How disgusting for him to force
himself into my room. Go to bed.

602
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,688
Jack.
- What?

603
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,189
Where you going?
- Home.

604
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,656
Why?
- Are you that dumb, kid?

605
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,762
Jesus.
- Aren't we full of surprises?

606
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:44,095
<i>I'm looking for the laundry room.
Fräulein's got my clothes.</i>

607
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,205
Yes, the laundry room.
Why don't you just follow me?

608
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:52,470
See you, Eric. Thanks very much.
- You're welcome.

609
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,922
Excuse me. May I have your attention?

610
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:02,419
I just wanted you all to see
what U.S. Bought his boy today.

611
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,156
It doesn't even need batteries.
Isn't that sweet?

612
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:10,694
I hope it'll start a trend
to solve the unemployment situation.

613
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:14,932
If y'all want one for your children,
we're taking orders...

614
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:18,268
We gotta talk.
- U.S., can't you take a joke?

615
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:22,363
I'm embarrassed.
- That wasn't remotely amusing.

616
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,944
Not remotely amusing.
- You're marking my arm, sugar.

617
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:30,581
I thought three weeks
with that shrink would do.

618
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,084
You gotta spend some quiet time
at the hospital.

619
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:39,114
I'm sorry. I was bragging.
You liked for me to brag on you.

620
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,258
Let loose of me.

621
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,763
You gonna deal with what happened?
Your wife embarrassed me.

622
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,903
So? You're getting paid.

623
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:51,935
It's your bedtime.
Put your toy away and go to sleep.

624
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:56,285
You, come with me.
- You can't pay me enough money.

625
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,473
You'll get yours.

626
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,546
Son of a...
- You can't leave.

627
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,018
I can't?
- In your pajamas?

628
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,557
<i>Fräulein's got my clothes.
- You won't get your money.</i>

629
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:18,927
Money? You're not hearing me.
I was embarrassed and humiliated.

630
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:22,071
You acted like money was important.

631
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:25,259
I was wrong.
- Was I bad?

632
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:30,207
Were you bad? What you were gave
a new meaning to the word 'bad.'

633
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,798
Stop. Don't go out that door.

634
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,345
There's parking people out front,
and they'll laugh.

635
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,683
Go out the side door.

636
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:46,757
You sure? Listen to me,
you're something else, man.

637
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,926
You never cease to amaze me.

638
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:54,551
Each time I think you're a rotten kid,
you do something real nice.

639
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,531
Thanks, pal. Take it easy.
- So long.

640
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,735
Bye.
- Bye-bye, Eric.

641
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,604
Eric. Open this door, you little shit.

642
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,585
Should we do something?
- What else can go wrong?

643
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:18,425
Probably a short-circuited
wire or something.

644
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,252
Open the door, you bastard.

645
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,377
He might be armed and dangerous.
- Negro.

646
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,155
Grab him. Probably on drugs.
- Bet he got out of prison.

647
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:55,137
Hey. Watch my car.
- He's high on marijuana, I bet.

648
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:29,442
It's only a fault
in the electrical system, I'm sure.

649
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:51,707
Well, Rasputin, what's next?
- I want to go back to school.

650
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:55,519
Before the end of spring vacation?
- Tonight.

651
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:59,784
But this is my week.
- I knew you wouldn't let me.

652
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:04,194
What's wrong? What happened?
Are you disappointed...

653
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,319
...that I didn't drown?

654
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,667
It's always my fault.
Well, it wasn't. It was Fancy's.

655
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:14,905
She didn't have to take him down
and get him embarrassed.

656
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,041
Now he won't come back
no matter how much you pay.

657
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:23,080
I don't want to stay because
I don't have anyone to play with.

658
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,776
Don't, Dad. I want him back.
Don't. I want Jack back.

659
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:33,251
Please, Daddy. Please get me
Jack back. Please.

660
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,732
They've come for the pajamas.

661
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,539
Just a minute.

662
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,227
Please, Mr. Brown.
- No.

663
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,563
The kid needs a shrink.
- I agree with you.

664
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:19,124
I take a little something so I
can sleep, and tonight I took two.

665
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,837
And he told me...

666
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:25,575
...that I either do what he wants
or I can look for another job.

667
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,745
Please, open this envelope.
Just look at it.

668
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,845
Come on. No.

669
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,748
Please.

670
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,282
No. This is my house.

671
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,556
Let me say something.

672
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,293
It doesn't matter the compensation.
The answer is no.

673
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:47,898
Can I say something to you?
I admire your moral fiber.

674
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,700
Ten thousand dollars.

675
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,399
$10,000?
For a week or the rest of my life?

676
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:05,096
He only has the kid for a week.
- $10,000?

677
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,748
Jack, now we can buy the house.

678
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,457
Come in. We'll discuss moral fiber.

679
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,960
Yes, Mr. Morehouse.
Jack, we're gonna buy a house.

680
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,029
Want to take a nap?
- Yes.

681
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:22,784
We were about to make love.
You can join in.

682
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,622
Welcome home.

683
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:58,602
Mr. Brown, I'll make it pleasant.
I will scrub your back.

684
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:01,705
I will draw a bath for you.
- Get it ready.

685
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:06,480
I'll see you in 10 years.
- 10 years? Who needs it then?

686
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:28,532
Morning, Barkley.

687
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:33,403
You're up early this morning.
Or didn't you go to bed last night?

688
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,472
I went to bed.
Is this Jack's?

689
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,741
Yes, this is his breakfast.

690
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,810
One, two, one, two...
Thank you.

691
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,613
Come in.

692
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:49,719
Here's your breakfast.
How are you this morning?

693
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,310
Fine, sir. Good.
Wonderful.

694
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:56,593
Better than the dinner I gave you
on the floor last night.

695
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,693
Oh, this is great.

696
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,499
Where would you like it?
Near the window?

697
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,467
Anybody seen the little monster
this morning?

698
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,862
Do you want me to find him?

699
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:10,874
He's a pain in the derrière,
I can tell you that.

700
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,864
Yes, well, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, sir.

701
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,464
What the....

702
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,925
I've had it. I've had it with you.

703
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,261
This is it.
- Put me down.

704
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,174
This is it.

705
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:47,437
No. No.
- Put me down.

706
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,143
What the hell is this?

707
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,215
Let me go.
Don't spank me, Jack.

708
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:56,417
Please don't.

709
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,657
What's wrong?

710
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:04,352
What's wrong?
Why the hell did you pick me?

711
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:08,198
You made me laugh.
I wanted a friend who made me laugh.

712
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,567
Of all the things in the store,
you wanted a friend?

713
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,837
If you want a friend,
you don't buy a friend.

714
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:18,017
You earn a friend. You know,
with love and trust.

715
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,781
I mean, you don't throw
firecrackers at them.

716
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,814
You don't dump stuff on their head.

717
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,817
You don't throw their food on the floor.

718
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,986
I've had enough of your routine.

719
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:34,079
You love a friend, you know?
You earn a friend.

720
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:36,626
Come see my train.

721
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,024
Didn't you listen to me?

722
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,831
You don't order your friends around.

723
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,601
If you have a friend,
you ask them.

724
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:45,802
Sorry.

725
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:49,557
Would you like to
come see my train, friend?

726
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,015
I'm gonna kill you.

727
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,115
I love you, Jack.

728
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,185
We've got four more days.
What'll we do?

729
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,433
Oh, I don't know.
Play?

730
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:30,944
Let's do something interesting.
- Watch this.

731
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:44,928
Hey, I know what. We'll start a
newspaper. You can be a reporter.

732
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,796
Boring.

733
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,465
Come on, man.

734
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:51,701
Listen, I'll be the editor
and you be the reporter.

735
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,928
I'll call you 'Scoop.'

736
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,239
Yeah, and you can take pictures.

737
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:00,419
You got a Kodak you haven't
taken out of the box.

738
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:05,354
Heaven forbid you might learn
something useful.

739
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:07,448
Boring.
- Boring?

740
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,950
All this is not boring?
All this garbage?

741
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,382
Look around.
You kidding me?

742
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:18,180
I mean, all these people
kissing your ass isn't boring?

743
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:22,592
I have an idea.
You want to go fishing?

744
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,665
For fish?

745
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:29,916
We used to have all the hoi polloi
from town in this stream.

746
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:35,078
Swimming, picnicking, leaving
their beer cans all over the place.

747
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,313
So Daddy bought some piranhas.

748
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:41,440
The first week, a cow
went in there. All gone.

749
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,353
Somebody's cow got eaten.

750
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:46,055
I gotta pull my boots up real high.

751
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:49,092
Because the bullshit's
getting thick. Piranhas?

752
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,860
I'm not kidding.

753
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,697
Piranhas are South American.
- I'm not going in there.

754
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,966
I'm going in there because...

755
00:58:57,066 --> 00:59:00,069
...you put a whoopee cushion under me.

756
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:04,071
There's nothing here.
No piranhas.

757
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:08,178
I'm not kidding you.
There are piranhas in there.

758
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,473
Come on. Get out.

759
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,672
Damn you.
Do you see any piranhas?

760
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,690
Come on, Jack. Get...

761
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:30,595
Come on.
You don't believe me?

762
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,100
You didn't believe me, right?

763
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:40,210
I'll never doubt your word again.
They're murderers.

764
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,972
Shut up.
- What?

765
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:46,919
Hold the noise down.
- Who the hell was that?

766
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,587
Mr. Morehouse.

767
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:01,397
I came down to do a little
fishing this afternoon...

768
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:03,166
...because I had a...

769
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:07,601
...difficult morning.
- You had a difficult morning?

770
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,099
I had to let Mr. Geffran...

771
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,416
...head of accounting, go.

772
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:18,248
He was pushy, Eric. He insisted on
shaking hands with your father.

773
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,050
So what?
- He has very sweaty hands.

774
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,150
Very sweaty hands.

775
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,416
Your father said...

776
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,622
...get rid of him.

777
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:32,195
He fired a man
because he had sweaty hands?

778
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,490
No, he made me do it.

779
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:38,732
Good man. Father and husband.
Mortgage.

780
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,604
Mr. Morehouse,
you gonna be all right?

781
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,339
Yeah.

782
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,439
We gotta go.

783
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,635
Good luck, Mr. Morehouse.

784
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:55,318
You know, we could tell.
We could get even.

785
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:57,518
Who we gonna tell, God?

786
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:01,257
What are you gonna say?
'Hey, God. Life's unfair.'

787
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,460
You know what he's gonna say?
'Tough titty.'

788
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,560
No, in our newspaper.

789
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:10,333
We're not doing a newspaper,
remember?

790
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:14,995
We could interview Fancy, Barkley
and everybody.

791
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:18,808
They wouldn't talk to us.
They work for your dad.

792
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,908
You can make them talk.

793
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,480
<i>Didn't you see All the President's Men?</i>

794
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,051
Reporters make people talk,
if they're any good.

795
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,853
You told me you were good.
I believe you...

796
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:35,373
...so we're gonna start a
newspaper. Let's shove off.

797
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,095
I want to be the editor.

798
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,493
I wanna call you 'Scoop.'

799
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,900
Shut up before I let you go.

800
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Don't let go.

801
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,840
You don't know anything about
running a newspaper.

802
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,575
You got that, Scoop?

803
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,177
Quit calling me 'Scoop.'

804
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,613
Just because your dad owns one...

805
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,616
...doesn't mean you can run one,
does it?

806
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,351
I hate typing.

807
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:05,688
I hate you calling me 'Scoop.'
I want to be the editor.

808
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,763
You're doing it by yourself, champ.

809
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,194
I'm doing it myself.

810
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:17,525
I'm doing it myself.
I'm doing it myself.

811
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,294
Jack... Jack...
I'm gonna fall.

812
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,205
I got you. I got you.
I got you.

813
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,973
I got you.
You give up?

814
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:30,911
One, two, three, that's all.
I was robbed. This guy is...

815
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,628
You're nuts, but I love you.

816
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:41,119
Eric. Come on, Scoop. Get up.
Time to go to work.

817
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:45,234
Come on, I just...
- Come on, Scoop. Hey, wait.

818
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:50,133
Just a minute, my friend. I'm gonna
take your picture for the paper.

819
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,428
All right.
Say 'cheese.'

820
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,840
Jack, I'm gonna get you for this.

821
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,042
You're in for it.

822
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,954
Couldn't we get these in a 40-Iow?

823
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:14,791
Come on, Jack.
I'll race you for a beer.

824
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:17,160
The last one in is a rotten egg.

825
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,063
Come on, Jack.
You gotta let me win this.

826
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,543
Come on.
Don't do that to me.

827
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:26,047
Let's go up there, man,
and take a rest.

828
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,310
Careful. It's hot.

829
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,580
Race you up to the top of the hill.
- Okay.

830
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,145
First one up is a rotten egg.

831
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,789
If my father's rotten,
does it mean I'll be rotten too?

832
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,391
Probably.

833
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:52,061
What if I don't want to be?
- You can't do much about it.

834
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,932
You're hopelessly locked in.
You can't avert it.

835
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:59,092
If you're hopeless too,
I don't mind.

836
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:00,970
What's Angela like?

837
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:05,200
I thought we were talking about your father.

838
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,708
What's she like?

839
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,480
She's like America.

840
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,674
She loves to fight. A good fighter.

841
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:17,153
She loves to take on
chemical companies. Like that.

842
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:22,098
Stuff that pollutes the world.
And she loves the underdog.

843
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:26,496
And she loves to be filled with
righteous indignation.

844
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:31,134
She's pretty wonderful. Probably
what your father would call a pinko.

845
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:33,498
Do you mate a lot?

846
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,536
What? Animals mate.

847
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,442
Well, you know, go to bed...
Make it.

848
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:43,179
It's none of your damn business.
- What's it like?

849
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:46,082
Doesn't anybody talk to you,
like your father?

850
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:49,049
What do you do with your...

851
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:50,386
...thing?

852
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,021
What do you do...

853
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:57,136
Is this a hypothetical question or
is there a lady involved?

854
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,495
Somebody going to your school?

855
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:02,231
There's only boys in my school, dummy.

856
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,331
What's her name?

857
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:11,534
Megan.
- Megan. You like her?

858
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:13,876
Yeah. She goes to St. Mary's.

859
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:17,801
We have stupid parties with them
all the time.

860
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:21,250
Know what to do next time
you have a party?

861
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:25,488
You go up to her, very gently.
Take her by the hand...

862
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:30,726
...gently. You kinda pull her to you
and you jump on her bones.

863
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,461
Oh, come on, Jack.

864
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:36,361
Are you serious? No kidding around?
- No.

865
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,735
Why don't you call her?

866
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:41,928
Play bingo or something.

867
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:46,342
Buy her a puppy. Get her some ice
cream. Play tiddlywinks.

868
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,639
Jack, you're asking for it again.

869
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:54,819
Show her how much money you have.

870
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:58,654
Tell her you're from the
Bates Millionaire Club.

871
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,348
Why won't anybody tell me?

872
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,651
I was just kidding, man.

873
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:14,534
Listen, you gotta be nice to her.

874
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:19,874
Tell her how you really feel.
Take a chance.

875
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:23,045
Stop being so tough.
They don't like that.

876
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:26,782
Women like it when you're
sincere. They respond too.

877
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,785
She'll look in your face,
check out your eyes.

878
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:33,589
She'd really like you if you'd
show her what you're made of.

879
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,729
Do you know what I mean?

880
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,596
And don't worry about your thing.

881
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,889
Plenty of time for that.

882
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:44,667
Just show her some of your heart,
what you're made of.

883
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,402
You're made of a lot, you know.

884
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,175
Yeah, but the guys at school say...

885
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:56,913
...if you don't make it with
a girl a week, you'll go nuts.

886
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,013
They're nuts.

887
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,115
Don't you know that?

888
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:05,221
Don't you know that physical love
is the easy part?

889
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:09,849
The hard part is loving somebody
with your heart.

890
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,028
That's the hard part.

891
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:15,273
Yeah, but...
I love her with my heart.

892
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:19,969
Well, do you ever tell her,
'I love you with all my heart'?

893
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:25,274
No. But I'm definitely gonna tell
her that I love her with all my heart.

894
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,910
And then you're gonna jump her bones?

895
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:32,600
You gonna jump her bones?
Are you gonna jump her bones?

896
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:37,353
Eric and I are gonna
start a newspaper tomorrow.

897
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,918
I just love educational toys.

898
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:44,160
I'll show him how to do an interview...

899
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,963
...and put it into newspaper form.

900
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,967
Use his camera.
He has a photocopier in his room.

901
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,836
It's a shame to waste that equipment.

902
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,961
Wonderful. Splendid.

903
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:59,875
I was wondering if you'd
tell us how you and your wife met.

904
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:02,812
And we'd sorta do a practice run on you.

905
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,848
You'll have to practice on someone else.

906
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:08,584
Daddy?
- It's just for your son, sir.

907
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:12,424
It's not like everybody
doesn't know already.

908
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,456
Around here.
But the boy...

909
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,790
Are you ashamed of me?

910
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:23,361
It's just the sweetest story.

911
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:24,633
I love it.

912
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:27,600
It's exactly like Cinderella.

913
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:31,273
Off the record?

914
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:35,708
You give me your word?
- Absolutely. Off the record.

915
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,854
Go ahead, sugar.

916
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:51,961
Well, U.S. Was on his way home from
Colorado, visiting Numero Two.

917
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:54,730
She's in a loony bin in Colorado Springs.

918
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:58,334
What I was doing in Colorado is irrelevant.

919
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:03,279
It's where I might be shortly.
I think it's real relevant.

920
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:08,029
You know, I don't believe
you know how to tell a story.

921
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,845
She was a little-bitty thing.

922
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,046
Scrawny, scared...

923
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:16,882
...wobbling on platform sandals.

924
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,987
She was the newest, the youngest...

925
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:25,490
...and the worst waitress in the bar.

926
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,831
It was a little bar outside of Amarillo, Texas.

927
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,990
Right next to a motel.

928
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,064
I remember she was...

929
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:38,840
...wearing some kind of rayon-like uniform.

930
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,271
It hardly covered her.

931
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:45,081
With some kind of metal things on the front.

932
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,181
Propellers.

933
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,847
Propellers?
Is that what they were?

934
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,780
You didn't know that?

935
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:59,361
The place was called the Fly-By-
Nite. The motif was airplanes.

936
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:04,266
All this time you didn't know
my metal things were propellers?

937
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:08,701
You're the one
who doesn't know how to tell a story.

938
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,855
U.S. Came through that door...

939
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:15,601
...like the archangel Gabriel.

940
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:19,338
And he lifted me out of all that misery.

941
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,588
And he gave me new hair.

942
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:24,551
And then he gave me new boobs.

943
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:26,388
And a mink coat.

944
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,615
And a pink Continental.

945
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:31,657
And a charge card at Neiman's.

946
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:36,398
And I swear, if you don't believe
in prayers and miracles...

947
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:38,934
...all you gotta do is look at me.

948
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,102
I mean...

949
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,261
...I am living proof.

950
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:49,120
What did your boobs look like before?

951
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:57,215
Don't touch that table.

952
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,157
Now get the camera ready.

953
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,025
Stand over here.

954
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,528
And don't forget to focus.
Okay?

955
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:07,229
Sit in Daddy's chair.

956
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:10,644
Why? I don't want to be in the picture.

957
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,606
What did you turn the light on for?

958
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:21,191
Hit the button on the left of the drawer.

959
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:30,017
I'm waiting.

960
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,267
Spoilsport.

961
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,912
Your father is very strange.
Now take the picture.

962
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,012
Okay, duck.

963
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:05,408
Now turn out the light.
Let's get out of here.

964
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,267
I can't take you anywhere.

965
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,533
Be careful of the table.

966
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,696
Let's get out.

967
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,301
Why did you stop?
- My dominoes just went down.

968
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:34,950
He says, 'You're responsible for
the lunchroom.' You know him.

969
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:39,021
I said, 'Sure, yes. What'd you think?
You know that.'

970
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:42,784
And he said,
'You let that black man serve.'

971
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:46,984
I said, 'Mr. Bates,
Mr. Morehouse hired him.

972
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,196
I didn't hire him.'

973
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:53,068
Two more months, my pension
would've taken care of my kids.

974
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:54,570
Can I take your photo?

975
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,965
Why, sure.
Let me get fixed.

976
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:00,009
I was employed...
What was I talking about?

977
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,659
When you were in England, sir.

978
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:05,614
I'm so sorry.
Thank you very much.

979
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:09,018
I was employed by an English lord.
- Lord who, sir?

980
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:13,355
A fellow called Lord Cavendish.
He met this fellow Bates.

981
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,725
Met him in a theater queue or somewhere.

982
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:20,562
I don't know. It turned out
they were both gamblers.

983
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:23,565
So they arranged to play
a game of billiards.

984
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:27,202
Billiards. Take a pole,
hit the balls into pockets.

985
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:30,787
At any rate my friend,
my lord, my boss...

986
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:34,543
...had a bit of luck
and he won a herd of cattle.

987
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:37,946
Herefords or something.
About 700 of them.

988
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:42,949
And Bates sent them over on a 747,
first class.

989
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:47,987
And that was 1978.
Good heavens, time goes quickly.

990
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,920
Well, '79, it must have been.

991
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:54,163
Well, Bates came over again
and he won me.

992
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,666
Maybe Lord Cavendish
should get better at pool.

993
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,891
God bless. God bless you.

994
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:03,878
Here's to Cavendish.
May his pool game improve.

995
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:07,476
What'll we call it?
- Paste this down there.

996
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:10,145
Don't move that over here.
- Why not?

997
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:12,372
It doesn't balance out.

998
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:15,584
You put it across the top.
Big headline.

999
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,086
That's a good idea.

1000
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,855
You know, the morning crew comes in at 8.

1001
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,523
What morning crew?

1002
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,955
<i>At the Bugle.
- So what?</i>

1003
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:28,330
Well, we need a press.
It's the only press in town, isn't it?

1004
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:31,934
You wanna use your father's press
to print our newspaper?

1005
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,034
Yeah, it'll irk him.

1006
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,536
I think.

1007
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,409
Got it, I got it.

1008
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,179
Were you ever a thief?

1009
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,417
Well, were you?

1010
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:53,362
Don't you know it's part of the
black cultural imperative?

1011
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,681
Come on. Grab this.

1012
01:14:58,293 --> 01:14:59,928
I've got the key.

1013
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:03,862
You've got the key?
Why didn't you tell me?

1014
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,234
You didn't ask.

1015
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,334
I didn't ask, huh?

1016
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:14,767
Evening.
- Evening. Have a nice evening.

1017
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,216
We really could put out a paper every week.

1018
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:25,906
Not just about Daddy, but
everything else that's wrong.

1019
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:30,025
Best of all, I wouldn't have to
go back to that school.

1020
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,261
Don't worry about that now.

1021
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,194
The next phase is the press.

1022
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:40,327
No, gotta make a plate.
- Is there anything you don't know?

1023
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,836
Police department?

1024
01:15:57,019 --> 01:16:00,182
<i>The Toy.
Oh, man. All right.</i>

1025
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:02,591
That's it.
- That is great.

1026
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,818
That's it.
- That's it.

1027
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,963
Police. Hands up.
- Let's get out of here.

1028
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,273
Freeze. Put your hands up.

1029
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,302
You can't arrest me.
My name is...

1030
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:17,899
Take them in and book them.

1031
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,182
What is he saying?

1032
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:31,153
And one of his gang came up
and stuck a gun in my ribs.

1033
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,253
That dirty sucker.

1034
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:37,449
Pointing at me.
What's he telling them?

1035
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:40,795
I've got some friends.
- Wait.

1036
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:51,565
Wait a minute. Those aren't my
friends. Is there a problem?

1037
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:58,273
Yes, there is.
- You're in big trouble.

1038
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:20,375
Can you give me $10 for a cab?
All I need is 10. Just $10.

1039
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,853
Here you go.
Read this paper.

1040
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:41,116
Sir? Sir?
Did you read that paper?

1041
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,660
Get your paper.
Read all about it.

1042
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,760
Here you go.

1043
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:54,469
Read about how U.S. Bates
found his wife one day...

1044
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:56,696
Holy shit.

1045
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,005
Get your paper.

1046
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:01,410
Paper. Free paper.

1047
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:04,060
What do you think,
Mr. O'Brien?

1048
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:06,379
Forget you know me.

1049
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:09,777
Jack, I gave out my last one.

1050
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:12,852
Me too.
Let's go fishing.

1051
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:16,710
Oh, man, am I tired.
Thank God this is over.

1052
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,267
Mr. Bates, sir...

1053
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,304
Morning.
- Good morning.

1054
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:34,740
Take a look at the newspaper
distributed by Eric and Mr. Brown.

1055
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:45,282
Eric is responsible for this?
- And Jack Brown, sir.

1056
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,921
I want them both here...

1057
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:52,184
...in my office, now.

1058
01:18:57,466 --> 01:19:00,235
<i>Attention, Jack Brown and Master Bates.</i>

1059
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:05,170
<i>Report immediately to the office.
Repeat, immediately.</i>

1060
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,740
<i>Yes, you two.
- Okay.</i>

1061
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,978
Would you have me stay or go?

1062
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,587
Come in.

1063
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,460
Take a seat.

1064
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:36,937
Eric, how many of those papers
did you hand out?

1065
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:39,139
About a thousand.

1066
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:42,466
I want each paper accounted for.

1067
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:45,646
And then I want them shredded.

1068
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:49,077
Let Carter do it.
I want you back here.

1069
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:52,888
We'll make even more tomorrow
and sell them...

1070
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:57,448
That's one trick you won't manage.
- You wanna bet?

1071
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:01,697
I assume, Brown, you know
the penalties for libel?

1072
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:06,632
Everyone knows it's true.
- They're lies if I say so.

1073
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:09,497
But it's the truth.
- The truth?

1074
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:15,652
Truth has nothing to do with reality.

1075
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:18,405
You have to deal with reality.

1076
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:24,119
In reality, any one of these people,
with a little persuasion...

1077
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:27,155
...will say what I want them to say...

1078
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:29,917
...because I am reality.

1079
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,822
Take your pants down.

1080
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:44,829
I said, take your pants down.
Right here. Right now.

1081
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:52,544
I have to?
- Well, if you value your job.

1082
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:02,422
That's reality.

1083
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,498
Get dressed.

1084
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:17,658
<i>Mr. Brown, maybe I could use
your talents on The Bugle.</i>

1085
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:22,177
Cleaning lady get fired?
- Start Monday, in the newsroom.

1086
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:25,474
A press card, salary, everything.

1087
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:32,685
Your hand?

1088
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,614
It's that bad out there?

1089
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,410
Worse.

1090
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:20,675
I got a job.
I guess I can be happy about that.

1091
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,519
Why are you so happy about it?

1092
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:29,215
My father will tell you to drop
your pants, and you're gonna do it.

1093
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:33,782
He treats people like nothing.
Didn't you read our paper?

1094
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:35,882
I can see the headline:

1095
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:40,055
'Jack Brown Sold Out Today
to U.S. Bates, as Expected.'

1096
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:42,817
You want me to starve to death?

1097
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:46,795
I can't feed myself
on high ideas and principles.

1098
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:49,530
I thought you were world-class.

1099
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:54,369
Your head's in this American dream,
but it doesn't work for me.

1100
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:59,805
Truth, justice and the American way
do not work for me, okay?

1101
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,878
I gotta play in the grownup world.

1102
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:06,581
You could've come to Houston with me.
- As your toy?

1103
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,979
No, as my friend.

1104
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:17,590
Damn, man. I am your friend, Eric.

1105
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:32,022
It's the senator.
- Senator Newcomb. Congratulations.

1106
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:46,953
Senator Newcomb.

1107
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:59,964
Who's that?
- Angela. Jesus H. Christ.

1108
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:01,569
That her full name?

1109
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:03,669
Greetings, senator.

1110
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:06,705
Oh, U.S., it's good to see you.

1111
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:10,645
You remember Terry Gay? My secretary.
- I sure do.

1112
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:14,816
You look good enough to eat.
- Say, what is all this?

1113
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:18,954
I think it's the orchestra.
Come in. Party's in the back.

1114
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,249
Senator, darling.

1115
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,159
My wife.

1116
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:27,490
We're not getting back in the bus.

1117
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:31,256
Now, we can legally protest. We are...

1118
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:33,301
You're Mr. Brown's...

1119
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:36,461
He's raising money for the KKK fund.

1120
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,274
The auction is tomorrow.

1121
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:45,146
Let's talk.
- What are you doing here?

1122
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,916
What's going on? Where you going?

1123
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:51,286
What are you doing?
Somebody could get hurt.

1124
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,989
I'm trying to help.
- You're not.

1125
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:58,660
They're raising money for the KKK.
- Lf you ever loved me, trust me.

1126
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:03,350
I'll take care of it. This is Eric.
- Nice to meet you.

1127
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:06,534
Nice to meet you. You better be right.

1128
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:10,714
You'd better be right.
Let's get back in the van.

1129
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:23,882
Nobody throws a garden party
like U.S. Bates.

1130
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:31,216
I appreciate you throwing this party for us.

1131
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:35,096
Old Democrats don't usually
support young Liberals.

1132
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:40,133
Senator, we agreed to keep this
under our hats, remember?

1133
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:43,738
If they knew it was a fundraiser,
we'd be alone.

1134
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:47,578
We wouldn't want that, would we?
- Pardon me.

1135
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:52,680
You remember my pal
and fellow Klan member, Clancy.

1136
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:55,316
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

1137
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:57,976
The Klan really thanks you.

1138
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:01,623
Democrats don't normally
support us in the open.

1139
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:05,659
We agreed to keep that
under our hat, remember?

1140
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:09,831
If they knew this was a fundraiser,
we'd be all alone.

1141
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:12,821
Come on over and meet the senator.

1142
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,163
Meet my friend Clarence.

1143
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:20,569
This is the senator. Photographer.

1144
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:24,090
Take a little picture.
And make it good.

1145
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:28,214
Hang on to your seat.

1146
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:37,290
Hi, Dad.

1147
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:40,829
What are you doing here, you asshole?

1148
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:44,754
The question is,
what the hell you doing here?

1149
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,034
You're fired.

1150
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:49,070
You know who you're taking a photo with?

1151
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,438
No. Who?

1152
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:53,683
The Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

1153
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:57,212
That'll surprise a lot of your voters.

1154
01:26:57,312 --> 01:27:01,249
Mr. Bates'll get a lot of mileage
out of that photo.

1155
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:06,548
You're fired.
- Are the FCC, IRS, or FBI after you?

1156
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:12,527
He doesn't know what he's saying.
Music. Everybody dance.

1157
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:15,460
Let's get him.
- Holy shit.

1158
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:29,395
Go for the tents.
- I'll get the other side.

1159
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,577
Get the tents.

1160
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,915
Duck, you suckers.

1161
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:40,844
Senator...
- Later, Bates.

1162
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:45,593
Fair-weather friend, the bastard.
I told you to dance.

1163
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:46,794
Yes, sir.

1164
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:48,930
Don't jump her. Just dance.

1165
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:53,535
Let's get them again.
- Let's go back for another try.

1166
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:57,223
Here they come again.
- Do your thing, Jack.

1167
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:01,966
All right, war has been declared.

1168
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,579
You show them, Jack.

1169
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:10,923
Angela, this is for you.

1170
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:19,561
What's the matter? I'm in the back.

1171
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:23,859
Hang on, wizard. Let's go to Oz.
- Let me off.

1172
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:26,260
You want to get off here?

1173
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:30,428
Way to go, Jack. All right.

1174
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:38,079
You look like an Eskimo Pie.
No, I've got it. Al Jolson.

1175
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:41,883
Jack, look out.
- I'll give you an Eskimo Pie.

1176
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,278
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1177
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:57,963
<i>Fräulein, this is for you.</i>

1178
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:02,095
I've had enough of this.

1179
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:06,207
Put that pie down.
- I didn't throw the first pie.

1180
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:08,307
Klansman, let's go.

1181
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:20,686
Why, you nitwit.

1182
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,023
Let's get out of here.

1183
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:32,699
Move it.
- I'll get you.

1184
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:37,639
You trying to kill the kid?
- No. I'm trying to kill you.

1185
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,779
Come on, Jack. Hurry up.

1186
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:47,712
I'll get you.
There's no way to get away.

1187
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:51,112
Can't you go faster?
- I'm hurrying.

1188
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:58,489
Look out.
- You can't get away.

1189
01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:00,693
Look out.

1190
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:10,594
Holy cow. It works.

1191
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,539
Daddy.

1192
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:16,939
He's in trouble.

1193
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,648
But I can't swim.

1194
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,645
You dirty son of a bitch.

1195
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:32,514
What? I can't hear you, Mr. Bates.

1196
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:37,029
Come on. Get out.

1197
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:41,798
Daddy, are you okay?

1198
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:44,331
Thank you, Jack. Thank you.

1199
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,617
Mr. Bates, please don't shoot me.

1200
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:08,561
Come in.

1201
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:19,024
You saved my life.
So I guess I owe you one.

1202
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:32,016
After what I did to your party,
I think we're even, okay?

1203
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:35,485
You know, that kid loves you.

1204
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:38,023
He never loved me.

1205
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:41,460
Sorry to hear that.
Try talking to him.

1206
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:45,723
Yeah, I talk to him.
But he won't talk to me.

1207
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:51,632
Your son loves you.
You gotta hug him.

1208
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:53,906
You mean, physically?

1209
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:57,944
Have you ever let your son sit on your lap...

1210
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:01,482
...and put your arms around him
and talk to him?

1211
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:04,819
Pretend I'm Eric,
and I'm home for a week.

1212
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:09,657
'Dad, I haven't seen you in a while.
I wanna sit on your lap.'

1213
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:12,527
Are you crazy?
- Yes, but trust me.

1214
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:15,994
'Come on, Dad, let's sit down.
Come on.'

1215
01:32:16,397 --> 01:32:21,072
'Pops, how you doing?
Boy, I had a great time all year.'

1216
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:25,173
I'll sit in your lap.
'How you doing?' Hug me. Come on.

1217
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:28,936
Hug me and say, 'I love you.'
- I love you.

1218
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:31,475
Say it louder.
- I love you.

1219
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,211
You kinky little devil, you.

1220
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:33,680
I want you to understand something.

1221
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:38,145
Whenever I drill an oil well,
buy a cable system...

1222
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:41,442
...open a store, it's for you.

1223
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:46,420
When you grow up, you'll control
South Central Louisiana.

1224
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,520
And that's some trick.

1225
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:52,593
Jack says life's about people,
not about your power.

1226
01:33:52,693 --> 01:33:56,397
He has no power.
Of course it's people for him.

1227
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:58,497
He has nothing else.

1228
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:01,874
He says friends are most important.

1229
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:04,267
I'm trying to talk to you.

1230
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:09,977
He says you don't have any friends
and that you know two kinds of people:

1231
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:14,849
Ones that owe you and ones you owe.
- I've heard enough about Jack.

1232
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:16,949
That's it.

1233
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:25,357
Eric, I'm trying. Give me a chance.

1234
01:34:28,095 --> 01:34:31,997
How about you and me
going to Europe together?

1235
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:35,670
There's no reason for you
to go back to camp.

1236
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:39,001
We'll go to London, Paris, Rome.

1237
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:48,081
It might have been a nice trip.

1238
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:02,305
Good to see you.
How are things going?

1239
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,999
The storm is moving southwest...

1240
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:09,349
...so there's really no problem...
Mr. Bates. Eric.

1241
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:17,477
Jesus. Come on,
follow that kid.

1242
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:33,185
Put it on my dad's bill.
- Okay, kid.

1243
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:39,700
No. Running away, what is that?

1244
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,460
I wanna stay with you.
- No.

1245
01:35:47,508 --> 01:35:51,679
I don't like this mean game
you're playing with your dad.

1246
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:56,484
He's reaching out to you.
He's making an effort. You're not.

1247
01:35:56,584 --> 01:36:01,174
You're a better person than that.
Give the man a break.

1248
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:06,792
Please.

1249
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:14,399
Come here, man.

1250
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:19,403
I love you, Jack.
- I love you too, Eric.

1251
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,330
But I want you to do what's right.

1252
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:27,682
You, your father and me gotta be
the strangest people on earth.

1253
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:29,782
Do you know that?

1254
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:47,115
I want you to do what's right.

1255
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:05,911
If you love him and if you need him,
you gotta tell him so.

1256
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:10,470
If ever two people needed
each other, it's you two.

1257
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,700
You know...

1258
01:37:22,236 --> 01:37:24,236
...he's right.

1259
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:28,670
I do need you. And I love you.

1260
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:34,278
I love you, Daddy. I really love you.

1261
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,813
I really love you.

1262
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:47,359
Get in the car, son.

1263
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:53,834
You know that job I offered you?
- On the newspaper?

1264
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:55,934
It's for real.

1265
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:00,790
You won't be sorry, U.S.
- 'You ass.' You're allowed.

1266
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:05,412
Next year, he'll have two weeks.

1267
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:08,382
One week with me, one week with you.

1268
01:38:08,482 --> 01:38:10,507
All right.

1269
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:13,921
Take it easy.
- See you later.

1270
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:15,990
To the airport, Mr. Bates?

1271
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:18,893
You're okay, 'us.'
- I'm okay, me too.

1272
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:21,883
All right, I'll see you next year.

1273
01:38:22,129 --> 01:38:25,826
Hey, Jack. You got some rich friends.

1274
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:33,097
That's all right, Roberts.
Oh, Mr. Brown.

1275
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:37,812
You want to talk to me?
- I don't know if you remember me.

1276
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:40,581
I'm Honey Russell, the D.A.'s wife.

1277
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:44,718
We met at the Bates' party.
I want to talk to you a bit.

1278
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:48,345
Fancy and I were talking the other day...

1279
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:52,560
...about the wonderful job
you've done with U.S.'s son.

1280
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:57,231
Is it possible for you to come
and spend a few weeks with us...

1281
01:38:57,331 --> 01:39:00,986
...and sort of help us
with our son, Eugene?

1282
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:03,302
Up yours, you mother.

1283
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:10,157
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. Gosh.
He'll never do that again. Please.

1284
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:15,072
Mr. Brown, please.
