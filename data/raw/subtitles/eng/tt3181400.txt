00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,210
Cu?

5
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,515
Holt, Quito, looking for me?

6
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,783
Cuzco, you should be at the circus.

7
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,819
"Cuzco, you should be at the circus."

8
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,753
Don't you ever just want
to have fun, Quito?

9
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:33,894
- Uh-uh.
- Sure you do. Watch this.

10
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,963
- Oh, no, I'm late again!
- Oh, man, gotta hurry or I'll miss it.

11
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,513
- Last one home is a rotten egg.
- Come on! Come on!

12
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,895
Uh-oh. I hope I'm not going to be late.

13
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:50,997
I hope I'm not late.

14
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,400
You mean late for work, right?

15
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,335
Nah, not that.

16
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,269
Your dad needs you.

17
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,306
You have to be responsible.

18
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,941
Okay, Quito, I'm going
to say this only once,

19
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:05,645
so you have to listen
very carefully, all right?

20
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,814
I know that I'm meant
to do something else.

21
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,949
All my life I've heard something inside me

22
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:18,158
calling for me to go out there
and live an adventure, like on TV.

23
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,994
You know exactly what I mean, right?

24
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,762
You're late for your job.

25
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,165
I know I'm late to do my job,
but I made it on time

26
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,768
<i>to watch El American, the TV series!</i>

27
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,170
But-- but-- but the divas need
their pink hats,

28
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,972
- and Divine needs--
- Hold that thought.

29
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:32,812
See ya-

30
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,699
- Holt, Cuzco.
- Oh, hi, Mom.

31
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,336
- Shouldn't you be at the circus?
- They don't really need me.

32
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,137
They can get their own props.

33
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:07,073
Well, your father needs you.

34
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,109
Soon you'll be ready
to be part of the show,

35
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,710
and I know you'll do great.

36
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,047
But Mom, I don't want to do old stuff.

37
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,182
I want to do something different.

38
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,151
Oh, your time will come.
Don't worry, liftoff-.

39
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:23,456
You don't know how lucky you are
for being part of the Generation Circus.

40
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,359
It's a dream, and you get to live it.

41
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,261
Please don't disappoint your father.

42
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,031
- And-ale! Let's go.
- In a minute.

43
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,866
I... I just need to...

44
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:37,237
change my underwear. Yeah, that's it.

45
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,137
- Ramos, vamps.
- I'm right behind you.

46
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,055
<i>- El Americana, the TV show.
- Go, go go!</i>

47
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:02,863
<i>In a cold moonlit night, El American
is looking for Centaur, his arch...</i>

48
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,296
Yeah!

00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:06,199
<i>wallpaper-</i>

50
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,449
Cape.

51
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,256
- Centaur!
- Oh, yeah!

52
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,846
Holy guacamole!

53
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,223
Look out! He-- he's right behind you!

54
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,627
- Cuzco!
- Dad! I was just going to, uh...

55
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,829
How many times do I have to tell you,

56
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:40,000
this cape is not a plaything.

57
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,369
It's a symbol for all of us at the circus.

58
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,571
It's an honor to wear it.

59
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,073
Instead of trying to understand,

60
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,976
prepare yourself to follow
our rules and traditions.

61
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,611
You're late!

62
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,315
And you waste your time watching this.

63
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,317
Dad, traditions need to change.

64
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:01,521
The circus needs to be more spectacular,
like El Americana.

65
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,821
What a waste.

66
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:06,459
But Dad, our circus is so boring.

67
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,662
Everyone's seen the same already.

68
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,430
If I did some super flips,
then you could--

69
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,166
Enough! You think circus stars
hatch overnight?

70
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,470
If you wanna be a star,
you first need to learn respect.

71
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,941
Until then, you'll continue to assist
everyone with the props in the circus.

72
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,578
The divas need their pink hats.
Come on, kimonos.

73
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,528
<i>Oh, no! Is this the end of El American?</i>

74
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:32,045
Garza Garcia, come on!
We need to practice.

75
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:36,716
Yes, Divine, yes. Here it goes!

76
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:41,554
- Here it goes. Oh...
- Garza, you dork stork.

77
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:46,893
Sorry, mighty Divine.
Hey, I'm a stork, not a dork.

78
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,573
Come on, chew!

79
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,234
Tacos! Sorta!

80
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,370
- Ara--
- Abracadabra.

81
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,472
L- I- I did it?

82
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:03,109
Where did he go?
Where did he go?

83
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:07,180
I'm up here, you cuckoo, Cuzco.

84
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,048
Hey, you found the divas' pink hats.

85
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:15,288
Bravo! Bravo, El Gran Divine! Bravo!

86
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:19,926
Why? What have I done to deserve this?

87
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:26,266
You guys should put
this comedy in the act.

88
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:30,804
I've heard this song 1,000 times
and still love it.

89
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,273
Man, this is older than old school.

90
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,907
Ancient history.

91
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,143
Ah, my son, you're just
watching and hearing,

92
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,113
not looking and listening.

93
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,149
You must feel the excitement.

94
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,085
The circus, the props,
the show, the colors.

95
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,455
Soon little birds will be here laughing

96
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,323
and entire families cheering.

97
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,825
It is our life.

98
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,505
<i>dermatological</i>

99
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:27,460
Buenas nos-hes, my fine feathered friends.
Welcome to you all.

100
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,997
Our next act is
a personal favorite of mine,

101
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:38,138
and I must say my wife, Laurie,
makes a most lovely assistant.

102
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:46,346
Put your wings together
for our very own mystic, El Gran Divine.

103
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,382
<i>Shoe the begging of tins,
the mystic owls</i>

104
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,385
<i>have been the greatest magicians of all,</i>

105
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:57,857
<i>making possible the impossible.</i>

106
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,657
Behold, behold.

107
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:04,937
<i>begging</i>

108
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,119
<i>that will leave you with
your beaks wide open.</i>

109
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:34,394
The spirit of chicken fajitas,
abracadabra, Michiganite, chaparral.

110
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,354
I said--

111
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,371
What's going on?

112
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,378
For those of you who don't know,

113
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:04,449
I am Martin the Kingfisher.

114
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:12,858
- Martin, where's Laurie?
- Goya, my old friend.

115
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,695
I will take over your petty little circus

116
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:22,001
with my electrifying Como Extreme!

117
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:28,340
I am here to challenge you for the cape.

118
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,277
You should give it to me now,

119
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,880
or shall I take what is mine by force?

120
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,282
It'll take more than flash and threads

121
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,618
to take over the honorable tradition.

122
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:42,487
<i>As bearer of the cape, it is I who
sets the time for a new challenge.</i>

123
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:47,093
- Fair enough.
- The full moon is coming.

124
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,695
I will meet you again.

125
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:52,565
Fate will determine who has
the right to wear the cape.

126
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,102
Never tempt fate, old friend.

127
00:13:56,102 --> 00:14:07,013
As the full moon shines for all to see,
the cape shall be mine.

128
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,550
Goya! Goya! Goya!

129
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,152
- Laurie.
- What happened?

130
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:15,252
Trouble with a capital

131
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,361
Oh, Goya, what are we to do?

132
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,529
If Martin wins the cape challenge,

133
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,866
we are all certainly done for.

134
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,002
- No more circus for you.
- Or you.

135
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:32,839
Or for anybody.

136
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,107
Which might not be a bad thing.

137
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,842
Hold on friends, hold on.

138
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:40,613
As you may know,
Martin and I go back many years.

139
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,549
He holds a grudge and wants the cape.

140
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,452
But with it, goes the Generation Circus
as we know it.

141
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:50,656
Our feud started in this very tree,

142
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,927
a long, longtime ago.

143
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,897
<i>Generations of birds have
come to witness the passing</i>

144
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:03,136
<i>of the cape in a tradition
that continues to this day.</i>

145
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:07,006
<i>Don Quetzalcoatl was the first of
many Quetzalcoatl that followed.</i>

146
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,742
<i>But their numbers dwindled.</i>

147
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:15,081
<i>Soon it came time to pass
the cape to a new family of birds.</i>

148
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,984
<i>Martin and I were both considered</i>

149
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,553
<i>to be the new bearer of the cape.</i>

150
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,222
<i>Martin had flash, no doubt.</i>

151
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,660
<i>He had the most outrageous act
anyone had ever seen.</i>

152
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,664
<i>My act was daring, yet simple.</i>

153
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,267
<i>But that night beneath the full moon,</i>

154
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,671
<i>the cape was passed to me.</i>

155
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,809
<i>Martin was crushed. His loss unbearable.</i>

156
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,814
<i>Vowing revenge, the Kingfisher flew away.</i>

157
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,550
Martin was never seen again.

158
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,118
Until rig ht now.

159
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,653
I don't get it.

160
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,657
If that guy was so hot,
why didn't he win the cape?

161
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:01,027
Don Quetzalcoatl awarded tradition and respect.

162
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,162
And the bird with the biggest heart.

163
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,399
<i>Okay, but what are we going to do now'?</i>

164
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,799
Let's walk, just you and me.

165
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,008
What is it, Dad?

166
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,045
Everyone starts at the bottom, Cuzco.

167
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,447
That's how we learn.

168
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,485
In time, I'm sure that you
will go to the very top.

169
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,888
I know, I know.
I have to be patient, Dad.

170
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,191
The Generation Circus
is all about tradition,

171
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,827
and that's important, Cuzco.

172
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:40,131
But you know,
sometimes change can be good.

173
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:41,901
What do you mean?

174
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,003
I need you for something bigger,

175
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:49,208
something new for the circus if we want
to win Martin's challenge.

176
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,510
Oh, yeah?

177
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,345
You've been talking about a new act.

178
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,680
How 'bout you and I try some
of those El Americana moves?

179
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,184
- You really mean it?
- Of course.

180
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,934
Awesome! Check out this super flip.

181
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,363
Whoops! I didn't mean to do that.

182
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,200
You teach me your El Americana moves,

183
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,435
I'll teach you some neat
old school juggling.

184
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:18,804
Deal!

185
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,154
Oh, Dad, we're gonna have
the best new act ever!

186
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,656
Oh, yeah.

187
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,093
Wow, the Tower of Challenges
looks amazing.

188
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,995
- Awesome!
- This is impressive!

189
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,763
Challenging for sure.

190
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:24,403
- You ready, h’m]'o?
- I was born ready.

191
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:28,341
Good evening and welcome to
the new Generation Circus.

192
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,191
Behind this curtain, a story unfolds.

193
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,458
The famous street artist
on his biggest performance yet.

194
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,162
When over the city tonight,
he will juggle not three,

195
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:55,401
but five golden eggs at once.

196
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:59,738
Look at him, so in control.

197
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:06,177
Oh, no, the evil thieves are here
to steal the golden eggs.

198
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:09,914
They try to take the street performer
down with giant fireballs.

199
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:10,664
EH]

200
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,387
They're our main bad guys.

201
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,721
Disaster strikes! A lady in trouble.

202
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:24,029
Luckily for her, the street performer
can carry her to safety.

203
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,466
But wait! What is this?
There's also a baby in danger!

204
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,870
The brave citizen must carry him, too.

205
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,820
More guns, more fireballs, more danger!

206
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:48,988
And the baby's grandma is in trouble, too!

207
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:56,595
Fireballs are menacing the Angelita.

208
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:01,200
But our fearless citizen
is an open target.

209
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,767
But wait? Could this be?

210
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:03,717
It is El Americana!

211
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,547
Oh, no! The lava ball cannon!

212
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,383
Whoa! What is that?

213
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,083
This is your finish act, bad guys.

214
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,613
<i>Bravo!</i>

215
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,896
Bravo! Bravo!

216
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,696
So, time to tell the boss what's up.

217
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,627
Martin! Martin!

218
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,636
Stop talking so fast.

219
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,538
I can't understand a word you said.

220
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:17,842
The birds at the circus
are preparing a new, big act.

221
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:19,812
Toys are popping everywhere.

222
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:24,183
It's big. It's new. It's fresh.

223
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:29,321
It's never going to be seen.

224
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,792
What do you mean?

225
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,760
Oh, nothing, Traitor.

226
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,528
I have to take care of something,

227
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:40,199
so Goya can suffer like I suffered.

228
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,102
A little humiliation.

229
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:51,610
Time for Plan X. Stage one: sabotage.

230
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,481
What is this Plan X?
Why didn't anyone tell me?

231
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,716
Oh, it's just me getting my cape back.
That's all.

232
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:01,419
Nothing to worry your
pretty, little head about.

233
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:07,593
My pretty, little head can
take it, thank you very much.

234
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:11,530
If this has anything to do with
anybody getting hurt, I'm out!

235
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,400
Ay, my lost child, do not fear.

236
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,573
This simply about getting back
what is rightfully mine, remember'?

237
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:21,907
Dove? Volvo?

238
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,709
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

239
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:24,509
Commence Plan X.

240
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,533
- Sabotage.
- Sabotage.

241
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:07,052
Come on, Dad, one more pass.

242
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,955
- Ready!
- Okay

243
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,759
Good evening and welcome
to the new Generation Circus.

244
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:19,565
Behind this curtain, a story unfolds.

245
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,767
Oh, no!

246
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,270
- Huh?
- Watch out, Cuzco!

247
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,270
- Cu col
- Cuzco, no.

248
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,260
No!

249
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,581
Gay Cu col

250
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:44,089
<i>- Papa!
' Gay!</i>

251
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,926
My good leg.

252
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,128
Papa!

253
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:49,978
<i>Oh, Gay, mi amir.</i>

254
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,804
We must take him home right away.

255
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:04,842
Carefully! Please, carefully!

256
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:05,742
Dad, I'm so sorry.

257
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,792
Look, Volvo, the cape!

258
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,801
Martin's gonna be so happy.

259
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,401
He might even be nice to us now.

260
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:46,218
I want a ranch with horses, and cows,
and chives, and a live chicken.

261
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,454
Oh, yes, a lot of chicken.

262
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,404
Quick, Volvo, hide!

263
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:13,412
It “was just a little yellow canary,
and he took the cape.

264
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:20,919
What are we gonna tell Martin now?

265
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,869
No, no. No way. This is all your fault.

266
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:50,749
He's waking up! He's waking up!

267
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,018
- Laurie, where's Cuzco?
- I'm okay.

268
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,554
You saved me.

269
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,689
Little one...

270
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,025
The cape. Where's the cape?

271
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,261
Don't worry. I got it.

272
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:09,267
Poor Goya! His legs must be killing him.

273
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,503
I wonder why on earth did he let anyone

274
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:15,140
change his routine in the first place.

275
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,144
All this trouble because
of that El Americana hoopla.

276
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,648
Hoopla, plaza-

277
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,998
Please stop, you cockatoos.

278
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:52,678
The divas are right. It's all my fault.

279
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,513
Don't listen to them, Cuzco.

280
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:58,317
Yeah, the divas will always
complain about something.

281
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:01,320
But now, my dad won't be able to stand
to Martin's challenge.

282
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,157
- We really need help now.
- Yes, Quito, but who?

283
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:12,131
Who can help us? Who?
I can't think of anybody.

284
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,500
Garza Garcia, you're a genius.

285
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,968
I am?

286
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,403
We've gotta find
our superhero, El Americana,

287
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,738
and bring him back to help.

288
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:24,076
But-- but who? What? Where?

289
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:24,926
There! Hollywood!

290
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,684
I haven't a clue. What in the
world are you talking about?

291
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,154
Who would know how to get to...

292
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,489
Garcia, get Divine, pronto!

293
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,593
Divine? Let me see.

294
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:48,233
Tacos, torts, tamales,
Michiganite, cheese.

295
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:48,953
<i>torts-</i>

296
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,038
What? What's going on? Wait...

297
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,140
Sorry to disturb you, oh, great one.

298
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,011
But you are the one that knows everything.

299
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,912
Well, yes, I don't like to brag,

300
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:04,249
but I'll force myself to say, "Yes, I do."

301
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,819
Please tell us,
how do you get to Hollywood?

302
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,856
Hollywood? Are you serious?
Hollywood?

303
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,759
Why would you want to go
to Hollywood, my dear boy?

304
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,394
El American lives in Hollywood.

305
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,864
We need help to save the circus from
Martin and his gang of bad birds.

306
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,034
Whenever you're in trouble,
who will help you on the double?

307
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,204
El Americana...

308
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,039
That's very nice of you, Cuzco.

309
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,074
But let me just say it's very, very nice.

310
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,976
- It's moving, it's touching, but--
- Every bird in and out

311
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,411
of the circus will be in danger
if Martin takes over.

312
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,081
We gotta do something,
and we don't have much time.

313
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,116
Yes, I'm afraid that's
an unfortunate truth.

314
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,086
But listen, Quito, I must warn you,

315
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,422
according to the sacred scrolls,

316
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:47,192
written a long time ago
before you were an egg,

317
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:50,529
Hollywood is a place
where dreams do come true,

318
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:54,366
but not always as expected,
with a little change.

319
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:59,371
But more often than not,
that results

320
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:04,810
of heartache and suffering.

321
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,411
- Cool, how do I get there?
- Is it far'?

322
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:10,482
Let us see now.

323
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,332
Chin Abracadabra.

324
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,860
Chin Chaparral. Cheek and Chung.

325
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,930
I feel it coming, and there it is.

326
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,932
I still got it, baby.

327
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,302
The secret scrolls.
It'll show you the way to Hollywood.

328
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,638
If anyone asks you
where you got 'em from,

329
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,373
you did not get 'em from me.

330
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:37,042
Thanks, Divine.
I will take good care of it.

331
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,811
<i>vamooses para Hollywood!</i>

332
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,014
Are you sure you want to come along?

333
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:46,817
Hey, it was my great idea, remember?

334
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:49,788
You're right about that.

335
00:29:49,788 --> 00:30:00,499
- Knossos!
- Be careful, thoughtful... and hurry.

336
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,939
Wait for me!

337
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:12,144
Fly like the wind! Fly! Fly, boy!

338
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,479
And, hey, bring me something, anything.

339
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:21,687
No t-shirts, no t-shirts.
I'll get you for that.

340
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,489
Did the sabotage go according to my plan?

341
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,091
Like a charm, boss.

342
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:30,095
And Goya won't be flying
or walking anytime soon.

343
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,775
<i>magnification!</i>

344
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:42,841
Hey! The boss doesn't
need to know all that.

345
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,378
The important thing is that
Aye’s legs are broken.

346
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,714
But you promised no one would get hurt.

347
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:53,718
My dear, Traitor, those birds
are the real villains here.

348
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:57,556
They stole the cape from me, remember'?

349
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,890
And you got my cape back, right?

350
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,993
Well, you see we almost had it.

351
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:09,234
But Volvo right here, he started talking
about pueblos, and I don't know what.

352
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,669
- You wanted a ranch.
- Enough!

353
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,237
There's no time to lose.

354
00:31:13,237 --> 00:31:14,587
Time to get that cape back.

355
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,184
Rest, sweet Gay, lest.

356
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:44,102
I hear my old friend,
Goya, had a bad break.

357
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,605
Martin, you fiend.

358
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,174
- No, Goya, don't.
- This is an outrage.

359
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:52,009
You have no right for this intrusion.

360
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,312
You have not won the right to be here.

361
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,915
HE ; .-";;e- I' -3 g.Fiji

362
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,751
I have no need for petty rules.

363
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:03,321
It is plain to see that poor Goya

364
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:07,792
cannot defend the cape from his bed.

365
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:11,997
Poor, poor, Goya.

366
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:16,735
And now the cape, where is it?

367
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:20,906
Well, don't just stand there.

368
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:21,866
Find it!

369
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,945
What?

370
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,549
Well, we saw the yellow canary
take it, boss.

371
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:33,485
The one that's always with
the little green parrot.

372
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,554
Fine, where are they then?

373
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,959
Where? Where is your scheming son
and that thieving canary?

374
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,827
Cuzco! Where's Cuzco?

375
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:56,975
Traitor, ransack this dump
and flush out that... Cuzco boy.

376
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,711
So the old owl knows something after all.

377
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:04,783
Yo? Me? I know Dada.

378
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:13,992
Ash, squeeze the truth out
of this petty magician.

379
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,042
Where... are... they?

380
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:23,567
- I'll never tell you.
- Stop it! Don't hurt him!

381
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:26,036
<i>He's going to PP'-!</i>

382
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:29,741
Martin, this is enough.

383
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:34,012
Ash, get him again.

384
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,715
I can't! I can't! I can't!

385
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:39,251
I know the parrots plan.

386
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:43,288
- Divine, is Cuzco all right?
- Tell me! What did you find?

387
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:47,125
They went to Hollywood
to look for El American.

388
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,127
They went for a coffee?

389
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:55,132
No, you fool.
He's a famous superhero from TV.

390
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:58,403
<i>"Mom, Dad, I??? going to get help-
Don't you worry. "</i>

391
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,038
Oh. Cuzco.

392
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,275
Traitor, we need to-- to find
a plan to stop

393
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:08,178
that blasted circus parrot
before he finds this superhero.

394
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:09,514
El Espresso?

395
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,015
No, is El Cappuccino!

396
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,551
El Americana!

397
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:19,624
He is El Americana, the most powerful
superhero there has ever been.

398
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:23,561
Ha! Cuds gonna bring him back
and kick your tail feathers.

399
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,261
Shut up! I want my cape right now!

400
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:38,108
Honestly, Garcia? A fear of heights?

401
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:40,979
We need to speed up!

402
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:44,015
We might as well walk.

403
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:48,586
- What a great idea.
- I was joking.

404
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,489
How about this?
We can just fly across this canyon,

405
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,091
and then we can walk, okay?

406
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,041
Okay, but I'm doing this under protest.

407
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:16,080
Keep up, Garcia.
We can't fly for you, you Knopf?

408
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,982
Slow down.

409
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:22,320
I'm seriously about to lose it.

410
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,623
Okay, let's find a place to rest.

411
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,926
Yes, rest my nerves.

412
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:32,396
Ay, ay, ay. You cw baby.

413
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,546
Hey, Quito, down there.

414
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:47,345
- Finally, firm ground.
- Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.

415
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,315
- Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.
- Seems a little cushy to me.

416
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:57,721
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy,
bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy...

417
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,992
Huh, this scroll is very puzzling.

418
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,393
Hey, guys, come here.

419
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:06,898
It says we need to keep heading North
until we find the Eagle's Rock.

420
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,669
"Where the eagle looks you must go."

421
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,803
Then what?

422
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:15,540
Seems that then we'll arrive at a place
with a tall, silver arch.

423
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,210
It says, "At the top look
for a big, blue strip."

424
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,847
"Follow it North, and you
can get to Hollywood."

425
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,416
Hollywood! Ay!

426
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,319
That shouldn't be hard.

427
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:32,557
Good. Oh, I want to get back to
the safety of our whistles tree.

428
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,758
I hope Hollywood is nice, at least.

429
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:38,696
- What do you think it's like?
- It must be a magical place.

430
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,701
A little birdie told me once,
that there all dreams come true.

431
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,371
After all, El Americana
became a hero there.

432
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,740
Okay, guys, let's rest.

433
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,809
Tomorrows going to be a pretty busy day.

434
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,777
- Goodnight.
- Night.

435
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:54,617
Good...

436
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,460
What's that noise?

437
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,352
What? What?

438
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:22,313
No way!

439
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,742
Wow!

440
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,953
Quito, where's Garcia?

441
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:40,091
- I don't know.
- Garcia!

442
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:40,941
- Garlic
- Amalgam

443
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:56,040
I need to pee-pee.

444
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,943
He's up there! He's up there,
and he needs to pee-pee.

445
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,093
Quick, Quito! Let's go!

446
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,756
Wow! What a view.

447
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,125
I can't believe you two
are enjoying the view

448
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,362
- when I'm about to die.
- Well, if you want to get off here,

449
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,332
- you have to fly.
- Hey, those rocks look like an eagle!

450
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,201
Wow, Quito, you're right.

451
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,102
It's the first sign from the scroll.

452
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:28,106
Find the Eagle Rocks
overlooking the yellow canyon.

453
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:31,776
- But-- but-- but--
- We're going the wrong way.

454
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,479
Get up, Garcia. We've got to fly now!

455
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:41,219
Listen, nothing is gonna budge me
from this spot right here!

456
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,069
- Fly, Garcia, fly!
- Flap your wings.

457
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:14,986
I am alive.

458
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,488
I can't believe it.
Thank you. Thank you, Cuzco.

459
00:39:18,488 --> 00:39:19,824
I'm so alive.

460
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,194
That was amazing! Incredible!

461
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,495
- Aw, come on.
- Pantsuits right.

462
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:28,233
I'll bet El Americana would be impressed.

463
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,101
- You really think so?
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:38,076
Let's keep moving. Clock is ticking.

465
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:40,745
Listen up. We don't have much time.

466
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,312
The full moon is upon us.

467
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:45,282
And without the cape,
all our hard work is for nothing!

468
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,952
Ash and I shall continue
with Plan X here at my lair.

469
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:51,723
Dove, Volvo, you two go north
and nab that pipsqueak parrot

470
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,657
before he reaches El Espresso.

471
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:58,663
- El Americana.
- Latte, Mocha» it's whatever!

472
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:02,567
- And what about me?
- Traitor, you're in charge.

473
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:06,237
Just find that little runt
and cut him off at the pass.

474
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,940
Do whatever it takes to get my cape!

475
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,478
And once you have your cape,
you will let everyone go, right?

476
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:16,414
But of course, my dear.

477
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,974
Now, be gone.

478
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:30,328
Palomar, you know what
to do if she goes soft.

479
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,878
Don't you worry about it, boss.

480
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:55,019
You lay back down right now.
You need time to heal.

481
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:59,290
How can I rest when my son
is out there, who knows where?

482
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,328
I just gave him an old mystic scroll
and showed the kid the way.

483
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:06,731
Look, I-- I hope you can forgive me.
It's all my fault.

484
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:09,232
You meant well, old friend.

485
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:18,476
Cuzco is our best chance now.
He's our only hope.

486
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,378
And we need to get something for Divine.

487
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:23,314
What is this place?

488
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:31,189
Wow! Wow! It looks like
a place for Lucia lire!

489
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,723
Let's take a shortcut through here.

490
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:39,464
It will be faster than
going around and more fun!

491
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,532
It seems like a bad idea.

492
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:48,406
Quito, can you please get
him down? We gotta keep going.

493
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,841
Wow! I love Lucas.

494
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:55,846
When I was a stork ling,
my nickname was El Disequilibrium!

495
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,646
Careful, Garcia.

496
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,074
Guys! Guys!

497
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:14,031
<i>Coming directly from Tijuana,</i>

498
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:18,769
<i>we present you the pride of Baja!</i>

499
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:24,574
<i>The most terrifying Colorado still alive!</i>

500
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,744
<i>Feast your eyes on</i>

501
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,094
Sancho El True no Gonzales!

502
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:41,058
It's been a long time
since I was challenged.

503
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:46,364
I can see you are brave
or fool enough to do so.

504
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:51,401
Now, I will have to crush you
and break your ind--

505
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:54,172
Perfect, we-- I mean, I should get going.

506
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:56,007
We need to find a city
with a tall, silver arch, and--

507
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,942
I've got my eyes on you.

508
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:02,279
I'm not easily fooled, and--
Oh, oh, the silver arch.

509
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,948
I know where the silver arch is,

510
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,851
and I would gladly share
that information with you.

511
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:10,855
- Oh, really, thanks.
- But first, you will have to

512
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:12,455
<i>defeat me in a Lucia lire match.</i>

513
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:32,477
The champ is in great shape,
ladies and gentlemen.

514
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:34,745
But-- but I don't want to fight.

515
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,080
What?

516
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:44,789
You come here to my place,
the legendary...

517
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,825
- ...and you don't want to fight?
- What?

518
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:51,395
You have offended me, and worst of all,

519
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:59,303
you have disrespected my audience.

520
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,840
As you can all see, True no is in control

521
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,378
and looking great this evening.

522
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:12,048
Let's see if his new opponent
has what it takes.

523
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:17,687
You are insignificant,
and you will be crushed!

524
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:19,537
But now you will witness my famous...

525
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,571
Could it be,
such a tiny opponent so strong?

526
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:38,409
Our broken Charolais giving
the champ a rough time.

527
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,079
Not on this lifetime, amigo.

528
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,179
I think True no is going for the diving...

529
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,430
Ladies and gentlemen,

530
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,400
this is truly a sad, historic moment.

531
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,774
The champ has lost,
and he must give up his mask.

532
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:14,212
I cannot bear to watch!

533
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:26,591
It is the greatest humiliation
for any member of the...

534
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:31,127
My mask now belongs to you,

535
00:45:31,127 --> 00:45:34,298
- my brave opponent.
- Wait.

536
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,433
Excuse me, Mr. Gonzales?

537
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:40,137
I couldn't have defeated you
unless it was simply dumb luck.

538
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,273
And besides, I can't take your mask.

539
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:45,042
- I'm not even a wrestler.
- Oh, I think you are right.

540
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:48,246
I'm the champ, and you are not a Colorado.

541
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:54,318
All this was a show for my beloved fans.

542
00:45:54,318 --> 00:46:00,258
I'm sorry to lie, but you know,
it is a very sensitive audience.

543
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,926
Right, but between you and me,

544
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,096
you should really check out
your eye doctor, champ.

545
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:09,033
Listen to the crowd happy.

546
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:13,604
Oh, young fighter, I can see
your heart is as big as your punch.

547
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,374
<i>You are truly like a Colorado iconic!</i>

548
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,676
Now, can you tell us
where the silver arch is?

549
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:22,012
Yes of course, my friend.
You are very near.

550
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:26,750
You must head for north.
I-- I-- I mean north.

551
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,819
I mean north.

552
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,587
That's right!

553
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,523
You will beam down to Tijuana,

554
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,993
and there you will get to see
the great silver arch!

555
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:43,868
Thanks, champ. I hope we
can fight again one day.

556
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:47,638
I will keep an eye on you,
fierce Colorado.

557
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,807
Bye, True no.

558
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:55,478
Oh, I should wear my glasses
more often. That's why I was defeated.

559
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:57,848
There were three of them.

560
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:03,521
<i>And that's it for today, Lucia lire fans!</i>

561
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:07,057
See you loons

562
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:10,227
Those three birds should
be around here by now.

563
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,862
And there's an old mine here.

564
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:22,440
This is the spot where
we'll stop them and take--

565
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:29,547
Yes, we have everything ready,
and we've even brought disguises.

566
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:37,755
- Question. Why wear disguises?
- They make us look good.

567
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:48,199
Well, at least the disguises
will fool the parrot and distract him.

568
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,869
Whatever. Just make sure
that nobody gets hurt.

569
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:57,273
We're only after the cape.

570
00:47:57,273 --> 00:48:01,979
No, no. No cake. Cape.

571
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,059
The Cape!

572
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:09,753
I need water.
I need a cold dip in the ocean.

573
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,455
I need water.
I need a cold dip in the ocean.

574
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,625
I need a rasp ado.
I need some ice cubes. I need--

575
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,160
IQALUIT';?

576
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,328
We can rest in the cool shade
there for a little while,

577
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:23,601
but we can't stay long.

578
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:26,804
Hey, be careful, guys!

579
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:31,208
Finally, a little shade.

580
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,058
Take a look at this place.
It's so dark and so mysterious.

581
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,728
<i>checkout.</i>

582
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:51,578
<i>Three one for you</i>

583
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,482
That was easy.

584
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:15,819
So you two are brave fellas.

585
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:21,125
But I really need to end this.

586
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,993
I need that cape.

587
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,493
Why are you making it so hard?

588
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:13,793
I... just... want the cape.

589
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,790
<i>' Traitor?
" Quito?</i>

590
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,590
No. No, no, no.

591
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,042
Can we do it again?

592
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,292
It's a cave-in! Let's go!

593
00:50:57,955 --> 00:50:59,056
What in the world?

594
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:05,129
Wait, Cuzco! It's too dangerous!

595
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,129
HIRE

596
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:13,070
Where are you?

597
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,607
Here! Down here!

598
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,457
I need your help.

599
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,046
Hey, Wait!

600
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:55,545
Is everybody okay?

601
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:01,184
Hey, you two, you wouldn't--

602
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:04,655
Leave her. She's with them now.

603
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:08,192
Hey, I know you. You're that girl
that's with the bad guys.

604
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:12,529
Is your name Traitor?

605
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:13,831
I'm dangerous.

606
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:16,667
Hey, wait! Wait! Come back!

607
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,636
She's no good.

608
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,236
Come on, Cuzco. We must move on.

609
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:33,217
Traitor the hummingbird.

610
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,586
That girl-- bad news.

611
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:38,422
I don't think so, Quito.
She's not like Martin.

612
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:40,724
She tried to steal your dad's cape.

613
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,559
Really? All this because of the cape?

614
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,631
It must really mean something then, huh?

615
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,300
I just want to go back to our circus.

616
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,671
Hey! Now, that looks like a
smart and sophisticated fellow.

617
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,073
Let me go ask him for directions.

618
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:57,523
No, wait! He's just a donkey.

619
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:19,930
Come on, Quito.
Let's take a look from up there.

620
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,265
Let's see---

621
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:30,107
We need to find the arch.
True no said it was near here.

622
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:34,545
Hey, guess what? The zebra
speaks perfect donkey.

623
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,879
He just told me where the arch is!

624
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:41,984
Wow, Garcia, that's great! Where?

625
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:42,704
There!

626
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:50,728
Come on, Garcia! Let's fly to the top.

627
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,963
You go. I'll just stay
here with my new friend

628
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,098
for a little while.

629
00:53:55,098 --> 00:54:02,206
Let's go, Quito.
To the top of the world!

630
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,308
- Whoa!
- Wow!

631
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:08,077
Wow, it's amazing!

632
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:10,881
Hey, Quito, look that's
the big, blue stripe.

633
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:11,981
We are getting closer!

634
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,924
Whoa! It's a rocket?

635
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:28,866
Who will help you on the double?

636
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:30,701
Whoa! Bravo!

637
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:33,437
That's a super EA move, bro.

638
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:37,141
Uh, thanks. So you're a fan, too?

639
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,443
Saw him at Comic Con once.

640
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:42,712
El Americana...

641
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,715
Cool! My name's Cuzco.

642
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,483
We're going to meet with him
and ask for his help.

643
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:49,987
Surf rat Karl, at your service.
Whatever you need, brag.

644
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,955
I'm afraid we need
a real superhero, amigo.

645
00:54:52,955 --> 00:54:55,859
I might just be
a plain and lowly surf rat,

646
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:59,496
but I do know someone
who knows EA, brag.

647
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,498
Good! Because this zebra
doesn't know anything else

648
00:55:02,498 --> 00:55:04,101
except for where the arch is.

649
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:08,272
- Garcia, this is Karl.
- Hey, what's up, Garcia?

650
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:11,175
- What's up, bro?
- Hows it going, dude?

651
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:13,776
So, you have a friend
who knows El Americana?

652
00:55:13,776 --> 00:55:17,748
- Wow, can you take us to them?
- Her, brag. Of course.

653
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:22,419
Her name is Lucille. She was one of
the biggest bird stars back in the day.

654
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,388
Well, then what are we waiting for?

655
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:26,156
- Go, go!
- Hold on, homes.

656
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:30,561
First, we guts to cross over
to the other side.

657
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:35,998
- Oh, no, I'm too young to die!
- Dude, we gotta cross the line.

658
00:55:35,998 --> 00:55:38,535
I'm talking about crossing the border.

659
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:42,539
Can you show us? We've never
crossed the border before.

660
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,942
You birds are a long
way from Kansas, ain't ya?

661
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:48,645
No problem, bros. I'm happy
to help out some surfing birds.

662
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:51,715
UN-freaking-believable, man!

663
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,183
I'm stoked.

664
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,554
Whoa, you're a natural, bro. I like you.

665
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,890
Surfs up, my fair feathered friends.

666
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,240
Hitch a ride to the border.

667
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:14,605
What do you think, guys?

668
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:17,674
It might be safer to fly!

669
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:20,410
I'll have to take you
surfing for real sometime.

670
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,479
You'll love the big blue stripe.

671
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:31,955
Wow, at this speed, we'll get to
the other side in no time.

672
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,957
Oh, no!

673
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,260
Ha... What's happening?

674
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,829
Oh, it's nothing. Happens all the time.

675
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:43,266
Oh, no! This line's gonna take forever.

676
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,801
That line's for humans.

677
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:50,139
There it is. The animal border crossing.

678
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:54,311
- Surfs up.
- Giddy up!

679
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:56,813
Poor humans. They must be roasting.

680
00:56:56,813 --> 00:57:00,117
This place is unbelievable!

681
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:06,323
Lots of pretty cool stuff, huh?

682
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:09,493
I'm so getting this for Divine.
What do you think?

683
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:13,597
- Almost there, amigos-
- Goodness, I'm starving.

684
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,400
Starving!

685
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,200
I've got it all.

686
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:25,828
Yahoo!

687
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,848
Oh, my! Oh, my! What to choose?

688
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,952
- What to choose?
- What exactly are you looking for'?

689
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,720
We're here to find El Americana.

690
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,722
<i>I am American.</i>

691
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:41,024
- Really?
- Well, well, well...

692
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:47,797
I am Mexican, but because
I am from America, I am American, no?

693
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,834
Yeah, I guess you're right,
but we meant the hero from TV.

694
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:55,604
Oh, that El American.
So you are going to Hollywood?

695
00:57:55,604 --> 00:57:58,308
I'm very popular also in the U.S.

696
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:04,613
You know, for us Mexicans,
anythings possible.

697
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:05,982
I really hope so.

698
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,452
Is it possible for some Mexicans

699
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:14,724
- to eat something delicious?
- Of course, my horse.

700
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,326
Hey, dudes, hurry, hurry.

701
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,662
- We're next.
- Hey, wait, no, no, no.

702
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:23,266
- Bye, Americana.
- You will find El Americana, Paris.

703
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:24,466
Good luck.

704
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:34,745
Welcome citizens of Mexico.

705
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:37,079
What's your business in the U.S.?

706
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:40,182
Are you bringing in
anything usual from Mexico?

707
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:43,620
I sincerely hope you have your I-94 form

708
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,523
correctly filled out, signed, and ready.

709
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,792
These procedures require precision

710
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:51,061
and must be done in a certain way.

711
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,697
But you already know that, don't you?

712
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,765
Aw, come on, dude. Do they really need it?

713
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:58,769
Hey, I ask the questions around here.

714
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:02,072
- Hey, how 'bout a statement?
- Okay, shoot.

715
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:04,174
Today's your lucky day, Officer Installing.

716
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:07,110
You can be part of making
a heroic dream come true.

717
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,613
Hmm. I like that. Go on.

718
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:12,182
What we have here is an emergency.

719
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:15,719
We're here to ask help from El Americana.

720
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,689
El Americana! Wow.
He is the greatest, isn't he?

721
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,558
He's actually Mexican, you know?

722
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:26,162
No kidding. Talk about
a success stow. Who knee?

723
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:30,267
Wonderful, but we still
need your documentation.

724
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,836
Oh, man, why does this
have to be so difficult?

725
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:35,671
What do my bros need to
cross the animal border?

726
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:37,674
First, we do a security check.

727
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:41,411
Are you, or have you ever been,
a cannibal species,

728
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,346
transporting illegal hay?

729
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,583
Are you a worm dealer'? Predatory bird?

730
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,152
Oh, no, I'm just Cuzco. That's all.

731
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:53,190
What do you mean "just Cuzco"?
You are the Cuzco!

732
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,492
You are even more amazing
than El Americana,

733
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:57,159
as far as I'm concerned.

734
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:59,429
You should have seen him
with the giant balloons.

735
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,164
He saved me!

736
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:04,334
And then he faced off
with this massive Colorado.

737
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,969
He has incredible skills.

738
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:09,773
Okay, Mr. Skills, show me a nice trick.

739
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:10,973
Show him the super flip.

740
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:23,953
Pretty good, not bad.
And what about the little pinata?

741
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:27,324
- What's inside?
- Who are you calling pinata?

742
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:31,061
I'm not a fiat! I'm a canary,
and my name is Francisco.

743
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,463
I've never been so insulted in my life!

744
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:37,967
Okay, okay. The talking pinata
goes in the x-ray machine right now.

745
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:38,967
Please, step lively.

746
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:45,494
No problem.

747
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,716
Um, is this radioactive?

748
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:53,566
Sombrero, please.

749
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:59,222
Map, check.

750
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,626
Cape, check. Tuba, check.

751
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:05,128
Radio, TV alarm clock, check.

752
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:08,465
Burrito with salsa. Oh, no,
that will have to stay with me.

753
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:14,203
Thank you, have a nice day.
Come on, next!

754
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:17,806
Whoa! I had no idea it would be that easy.

755
01:01:17,806 --> 01:01:19,576
You do know that they're birds.

756
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:22,879
They could just fly over
and not come through here.

757
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:27,584
That's honesty, mister.
And we appreciate that around here.

758
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:30,085
Welcome to the United States of America.

759
01:01:30,085 --> 01:01:33,723
- Gracious. I mean, thank you.
- Yes.

760
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:36,359
Fly straight. Fly right.

761
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,628
Great job, Ash.

762
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:42,299
Now, we're ready for
the explosive finale of Goya

763
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:46,870
and his pitiful, old show
once and for all.

764
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:52,309
But all of this is pointless
unless I have... the cape.

765
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,259
The cape. Give it to me! Give it to me!

766
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:04,721
Slow down! Slow down!

767
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,022
Boss, boss, let me explain it to you.

768
01:02:07,022 --> 01:02:14,063
We caught Cuzco and his friend
in this old, abandoned mine.

769
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,765
That it! I'm done with these two!

770
01:02:16,765 --> 01:02:20,103
Ash, make some pigeon fricassee.

771
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:27,477
Well, we had the cape,
but we were betrayed by Traitor.

772
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,779
Wow, you finally agree with me!

773
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:30,579
Really? Traitor?

774
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,759
What is it with you two?
I thought we were a team.

775
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:48,465
- You! You betrayed me!
- But-- but-- but... But, I...

776
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:50,967
You want me to fail, don't you, Traitor?

777
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:54,537
You know that if I don't have that cape
all my plans will be for nothing.

778
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:56,538
What are you talking about, Martin?

779
01:02:56,538 --> 01:02:58,508
I don't have the stupid cape,

780
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:01,778
but I almost died
trying to get it for you.

781
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,648
Liar! I knew you would
betray me some day,

782
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,817
ever since I saw that rage in your eyes

783
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:11,621
the night you lost your parents.

784
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,157
- My parents?
- That's right.

785
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:16,992
I took care of them
for not obeying my orders.

786
01:03:16,992 --> 01:03:25,835
And now it seems
history repeats itself. Ash.

787
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,837
Traitor. She's escaped!

788
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:31,707
Get her and all of her pathetic friends.

789
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:36,546
Do whatever it takes.
Make them pay. Take no prisoners.

790
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:40,416
And bring me that cape!

791
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:40,482
Yeah! Yeah!

792
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:42,852
Yeah! Yeah!

793
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,652
I love the zoo!

794
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,591
My dude, whoa!
There's Lucille over there.

795
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,151
Hey, Lucille!

796
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:31,034
- Hey, beautiful.
- Karl, you old surf rat.

797
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:35,004
Give me a hug, you hippie.
Oh, my old friend!

798
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,773
Oh, excuse me a sec.

799
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:38,808
Lava, Christa, chatty time?

800
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,945
- Get to work already!
- Isn't she the sweetest?

801
01:04:41,945 --> 01:04:45,114
Lucille, meet my new best buds from MO,

802
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,716
- Garza Garcia, Quito...
- Hi!

803
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:48,952
...and my home, Cuzco.

804
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:52,489
Welcome to the San Diego Zoo.

805
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:54,924
<i>Seriously, boys, m' case es sew case.</i>

806
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,292
How long can you stay?

807
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,994
Actually, we need to
get to Hollywood, pronto.

808
01:04:58,994 --> 01:05:02,298
Well, soon, it will be too dark to travel.

809
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:06,002
I could use a rest.

810
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:09,272
No. No rest for the wicked

811
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:13,109
because tonight is party time.

812
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,109
Wow!

813
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:22,285
So Karl tells me you were
a big star in Hollywood.

814
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:25,955
Yes, well, I had
the acting bug back in the day.

815
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:29,559
Oh, I was the toast of Hollywood...

816
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:33,163
before becoming the queen
of the roost here at the zoo.

817
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:37,233
Did you ever meet El Americana?

818
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:40,969
Oh, yes. I used to know him... well.

819
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:44,374
In fact, his real name is Eddie Navarro.

820
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:48,977
Wow, that's amazing. I bet he's
super incredible in person.

821
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:50,213
Incredible?

822
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:54,349
Hmm. Let's just say
El Americana might not be

823
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:59,122
- what you imagine him to be.
- I'm sure he's even better!

824
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,522
Cuzco, dear, it's time for
the skate competition.

825
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,378
<i>And the speed of the light</i>

826
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,813
<i>Come on, let's go for a ride</i>

827
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:24,763
<i>I'll be your rocket</i>

828
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:36,558
<i>I come from outer space
with a magical taste</i>

829
01:06:36,558 --> 01:06:37,608
<i>I am your bright spot</i>

830
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,512
<i>Right, right,
right come on with me</i>

831
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,716
<i>Right, right,
right we can be free</i>

832
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,752
<i>Right, right,
right come on with me</i>

833
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:06,523
<i>Right, right,
right we can be free</i>

834
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,224
<i>Right, right,
right come on with me</i>

835
01:07:09,224 --> 01:07:10,624
<i>Right, right,
right we can be</i>

836
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:28,745
<i>Right, right,
right come on with me</i>

837
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:31,781
<i>Right, right,
right we can be free</i>

838
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:40,790
<i>Come with me, we'll go as
far as we see to the horizon</i>

839
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,993
<i>Right, right,
right we can be free</i>

840
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:47,296
Cuzco, brag, it's your turn, man.
Show 'em what you got.

841
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,998
Really? You think I should join them?

842
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,099
- Yeah.
- Sure.

843
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,569
Go show these whirl
birds how it's done, dear.

844
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:53,819
Okay-

845
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,109
Go, Cu col

846
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:18,127
Whoa!

847
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:23,900
- Your boy is incredible!
- Totally!

848
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:29,739
Here goes the super flip on wheels.

849
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:31,439
<i>Right, right,
right come on with me</i>

850
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,023
Glad you're up.

851
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:51,327
But let's go. You'll need an
early start to catch your train.

852
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,329
Karl, are you coming with us?

853
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:54,797
You know you're more than welcome.

854
01:08:54,797 --> 01:09:00,202
Aw, I'd love to, but I've got
some major surfing to do here in SD.

855
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:03,405
Gotta work off my party belly.

856
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:08,478
Plus, the swells today
are supposed to be swimming!

857
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:11,581
- Thank you, brag.
- You're gonna need some grub.

858
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:15,051
This should stick to your ribs.
Mm-hmm. Yum, yum.

859
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:22,492
Don't worry, darling. I packed it myself.

860
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:26,462
Thank you for making my party so special.

861
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:30,032
Cuzco, I want you to have this.

862
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:35,004
You mean you and El--
I mean Eddie Navarro were...?

863
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,874
Yes, well, of course
he wanted to marry me,

864
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:39,976
but we weren't right for each other then.

865
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,411
Once in a while, sure.

866
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:43,712
He's just below the Hollywood sign.

867
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,148
That's right.

868
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:47,383
Gracious, Lucille.

869
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:49,385
Come on, guys.

870
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:53,189
Goodbye, dear friends from Mexico.

Do-- do we have to fly all the way there?

873
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:08,404
Farewell, San Diego. Hello, Hollywood.

874
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:12,975
- Uh-oh. Look!
- What is it, Quito?

875
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:19,248
No! It's-- it's
that horrible hummingbird again.

876
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,250
Traitor, what are you doing here?

877
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,586
Don't listen to her. It's a trick.

878
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:27,223
Look, I don't expect you to believe me.

879
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,727
Just hear me out, okay?

880
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:34,964
Yes, I worked for Martin.
I didn't want to, but I had to.

881
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:38,134
He raised me. He adopted me.

882
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:42,537
But I've since learned
that he was the one who---

883
01:10:42,537 --> 01:10:45,441
who separated me from my parents.

884
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,909
I didn't come here to
tell you my sob story.

885
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:51,747
L-- I came to thank you for saving
my life back at the old mine.

886
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:54,917
- I owe you now.
- You don't owe me anything,

887
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,153
but you did try to steal my dad's cape.

888
01:10:57,153 --> 01:10:58,353
I'm sorry.

889
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:03,359
I guess I can't blame you
for not trusting me.

890
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,163
But I'll tell you everything,
so you know that I'm truly on your side.

891
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:09,365
- Like what?
- Well, you should know

892
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:12,935
that Martin had the Paloma brothers
sabotage the structure you built.

893
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,670
And now, he's holding your
circus family prisoner.

894
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:20,109
- Oh, no, we have to go back.
- I feel for you, I really do.

895
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,445
- But you can't go back now.
- Why?

896
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:25,114
Martin is crazy. Who knows what he'll do.

897
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,749
Well, I do.

898
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:29,584
We must hurry and get to El Americana.

899
01:11:29,584 --> 01:11:33,321
- Martin seems afraid of him.
- Can we trust her'?

900
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:36,959
It's okay. She's one of us now.
Right, Traitor?

901
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:42,832
- Right.
- Go ahead, Quito. Show her the map.

902
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:46,001
Okay. It looks easy enough to find, and--

903
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,837
What's that?

904
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:51,207
- Who's Lucille?
- Long story.

905
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:52,287
It's Ash!

906
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:55,493
Eat this, mosquito brain.

907
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:38,187
That surely left him
seeing little birdies.

908
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:44,861
- We're okay.
- Yes, we are.

909
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:45,611
No!

910
01:12:59,642 --> 01:13:03,578
Cuzco, go and we'll distract him.

911
01:13:03,578 --> 01:13:06,816
You... must... leave.

912
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:07,966
Go! Find the Americana!

913
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,245
Oh, my! I-- I'm finally here!

914
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,495
Excuse me? Americana?

915
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:58,033
Who dares to enter
Eddie Navarro's fortress?

916
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:01,503
I am a friend of Lucille, sir, and a fan.

917
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:04,173
A fan? Really?

918
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,073
Coming right down.

919
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,641

I am Eduardo Tiberius Navarro

921
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:49,685
But you can call me... Eddie Navarro.

922
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,620
You're El Americana?

923
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:57,059
Well, there is no real
El Americana, my boy.

924
01:14:57,059 --> 01:15:02,865
But I was the star of that
old show way back when.

925
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:07,036
I have so many successful roles,
and El Americana

926
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:10,905
was just one of the little ones.

927
01:15:10,905 --> 01:15:17,413
But enough about me, you are here
for my autograph, aren't you?

928
01:15:17,413 --> 01:15:18,514
What's your name, my boy?

929
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,517
But what about all the bad guys
you defeated?

930
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:25,855
That's movie magic, my boy.

931
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,123

932
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:30,626
What about the super flip
and all your amazing moves?

933
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:34,563

934
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:38,400
Oh, yeah! I remember that one.

935
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,036
My stunt double came up with that one.

936
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:45,840
You are El Americana?

937
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,045
I did some stunts myself here and there,

938
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:52,748
but all the handsome close ups?

939
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,550

- Excuse me. What?

966

Saved everyone.
