1
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:08,204
The world is full of complainers.

2
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,443
But the fact is:
nothing comes with a guarantee.

3
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:16,844
I don't care if you're the Pope,

4
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:20,764
President of the United States,
Man of the Year.

5
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,239
Something can all go wrong.

6
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:25,647
Go ahead and complain,

7
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:29,041
tell your problems to your neighbor,
ask for help,

8
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:31,201
and watch them fly.

9
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:37,964
In Russia they map it out so that
everyone pulls for everyone else.

10
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,600
That's the theory anyway.

11
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,885
But what I know about is Texas.

12
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,687
And down here,

13
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,681
you're on your own.

14
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:02,848
He gave me a pearl-handled 38
for our first anniversary.

15
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,880
Think I better leave
before I use it on him.

16
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:15,318
I don't understand
how you can use it on him.

17
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:18,482
I'm only an employee.
I ain't married to him.

18
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,886
It's just...

19
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,245
I don't know.

20
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,203
Sometimes I think
something's wrong with him.

21
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:33,281
Maybe he's sick?

22
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,088
Mentally?

23
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:40,198
Or is it maybe me, do you think?

24
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:44,359
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor.

25
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:47,560
I don't know what goes on.

26
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,449
And I don't wanna know.

27
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:54,958
But I like you.

28
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,845
I've always liked you.

29
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,644
What're you gonna do in Houston?

30
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll figure something out.

31
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:18,480
How come you offered to drive me
in this mess?

32
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,244
I told you I like you.

33
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,246
I never knew that.

34
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,048
Well, now you do.

35
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,678
Hell!

36
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:39,958
Stop the car, Ray!

37
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,488
You know that car?

38
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:18,798
No.

39
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,248
What's the matter?

40
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:25,841
I don't know.

41
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:31,127
I just think maybe
I'm making a mistake.

42
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,522
What was that back there?

43
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,202
Back where?

44
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,561
That sign.

45
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:45,559
I don't know.

46
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,522
A motel.

47
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,407
Did you mean what you said?
Were you just being a gentleman?

48
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:59,280
Abby, I like you.

49
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,364
But there's no point
starting anything now.

50
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:10,167
I ain't a marriage counselor.

51
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,328
What do you wanna do?

52
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:22,280
What do you wanna do?

53
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:57,443
Hello.
- Having a good time?

54
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:02,402
Who is this?
- I don't know. Who is this?

55
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,961
You still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

56
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:30,837
Who was it?

57
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,488
Your husband.

58
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:19,157
I know
where you can get those framed.

59
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,159
Why'd you take these?

60
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:26,959
What d'you mean?
Just doing my job.

61
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,758
I knew they were there.
Why'd you take 'em?

62
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:34,727
I don't know.
Call it a fringe benefit.

63
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:38,200
How long were you watching them?

64
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:41,961
Most of the night.

65
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:47,087
They'd rest every few minutes
and get started again.

66
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,242
Quite something.

67
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:04,243
You know, in Greece

68
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:11,043
they'd cut the head off the messenger
that brought bad news.

69
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:19,879
Now that don't make much sense.

70
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,638
No.

71
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:25,127
It made them feel better.

72
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,518
First off,

73
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,443
Julian,

74
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:33,488
I don't know
what the story is in Greece,

75
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,244
but in this state

76
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:39,686
we got very definite laws about that.
Second,

77
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:41,761
I'm not a messenger,

78
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:44,046
I'm a private investigator.

79
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,477
And third, and most important,

80
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,959
it ain't such bad news.

81
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,283
I mean, you thought he was colored.

82
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:57,408
You're always assuming the worst.

83
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:58,958
Anything else?

84
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,801
Don't come around here anymore.

85
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:06,485
If I need you,
I'll know what rock to turn over.

86
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:14,724
That's good.

87
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,565
"What rock to turn over..."

88
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:20,197
Very good!

89
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:29,165
Give me a call
whenever you wanna cut off my head.

90
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:34,924
I can always crawl around
without it.

91
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:02,966
We'll be back
after a short intermission...

92
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:17,082
Hold it!

93
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,922
Where was I?

94
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:39,720
You were telling me
about the ring of fire. - Right.

95
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:41,926
You got all these volcanoes, right?

96
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:45,799
Now every time one goes pop,
you got the equivalent of...

97
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:48,848
...20, 30 megatons of TNT.
- Meurice!

98
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,201
I know, Marty. Pour 'em short.

99
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:57,598
Is Ray in yet? - No, it's his night off.
Where was he last night?

100
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,159
I don't wanna know where he was.

101
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:02,480
Didn't he call?

102
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,120
This is

103
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,121
an old friend of mine, Debra.

104
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,042
Debra, this is Julian Marty.

105
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,440
Deuce in the corner needs help.
- Right.

106
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:23,483
How long you know Meurice?
- About ten years.

107
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,198
10 years?
What are you doing tonight?

108
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:30,245
Going out with Meurice.

109
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:36,004
Tell him you have a headache.

110
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:38,488
He'll pass.

111
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,761
We don't seem
to be communicating...

112
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,648
Look, you wanna hustle me?

113
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,721
I don't wanna be hustled.
- Oh, you don't?

114
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,120
It's as simple as that.
- Oh, as simple as that.

115
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,404
I'm not here if they come, okay?
- Right.

116
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,206
Nice guy.
- Not really.

117
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,687
What's your last name?

118
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:48,802
Good old boy.

119
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,368
Let's get outta here.

120
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:44,679
You get what you wanted?
- Yeah. Let's get outta here.

121
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:49,679
Drive me to a motel?
- You can stay at my place.

122
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:52,605
I'll drop you there.
- Where you goin'?

123
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:54,328
See a guy.

124
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,201
Don't go to the bar.
I know him. It ain't a good idea.

125
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,522
I just gotta see a guy.

126
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,042
So what's the deal?

127
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:18,566
None if your colleagues could harness
this volcanic energy?

128
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:23,520
And I just sit back and watch
these shit kickers go broke.

129
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,566
Sorry about last night.
- No sweat. Wasn't too busy.

130
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:29,322
But you missed a good one.

131
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:33,642
A white guy walks in and asks
do we have a discount for alcoholics.

132
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,448
I tell him to get lost.

133
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:39,888
But Marty's sitting here
thinking that maybe ain't a bad idea.

134
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,044
Well?

135
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:09,802
What?

136
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:13,083
What, what?
- Am I fired?

137
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,725
You wanna hit me or what?

138
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:19,159
I don't particularly
want to talk to you.

139
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:22,843
Well!

140
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:27,244
If you aren't gonna fire me,
I'll quit.

141
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:28,638
Fine!

142
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,647
Suit yourself.

143
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,041
Having a good time?

144
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:42,879
I don't like this kind of talk.
- What'd you come here for?

145
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:46,124
You owe me for two weeks.

146
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:49,318
Nope.

147
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:53,518
She's

148
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,806
an expensive piece of ass.

149
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,765
Who else has she been sluicing?

150
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:03,323
I want money! You gotta talk? Fine.
- Are you a fucking marriage counselor?

151
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:05,203
What're you smiling at?

152
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:08,564
I'm funny? I'm an asshole?

153
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:10,325
No.

154
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:15,447
That's not what's funny.
What's funny is her.

155
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,726
And that I had you two followed.

156
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:21,361
If it's not you she's sleeping with,
it's someone else.

157
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,646
And what's really gonna be funny is

158
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,768
when she gives you
that innocent look and says,

159
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:30,002
"I don't know
what you're talking about, Ray.

160
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,604
I ain't done anything funny."

161
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:34,722
The funniest thing

162
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:37,040
for me right now

163
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:40,805
is that you think
she came back here for you.

164
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,404
That's what's fuckin' funny!

165
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:04,239
Come on this property again
I'll be forced to shoot you.

166
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:12,403
Fair notice.

167
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:30,006
I thought you were dead.
You goin' home?

168
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,724
No.

169
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,199
I'm stayin' right here in hell.

170
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:41,083
Kind of a bleak point of view,
isn't it?

171
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:48,841
I don't want the asshole
near my money.

172
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,040
And I don't want him in the bar.

173
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:56,724
You get a lot of assholes in here.

174
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,318
Hello.

175
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,278
Who was it?

176
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:34,838
What?

177
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,807
On the phone.

178
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:40,764
Was it for you?

179
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:44,525
I don't know. He didn't say anything.

180
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,487
How did you know it was a "he?"

181
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,160
You got a girl?

182
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:55,004
Am I screwing something up
by being here? - No.

183
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:57,078
Am I?

184
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:05,721
I can find a place tomorrow, and I'll
be outta your hair. - If you want to,

185
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:07,357
then do it.

186
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:28,280
You want the bed or the couch?

187
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:30,558
Well...

188
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:33,882
The couch'll be all right.

189
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:35,961
You can sleep on the bed.

190
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,362
I'm not putting you outta your bed.
- You wouldn't be putting me out.

191
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:47,962
I'll be all right here.

192
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:36,683
Opal?

193
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:43,205
Lover boy oughta lock his door.

194
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,322
Lot of nuts out there.

195
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:02,961
Let's do it outside, in nature.

196
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:35,802
I'd like to have seen his face
when he found the dead end.

197
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:53,927
Hey, mister!
How'd you break your pussy finger?

198
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,361
I want it! I want it!

199
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:06,882
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
My date's here.

200
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:11,518
She saw me rollin' a cigarette
and thought it was marijuana.

201
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:14,807
Thought I was a swinger, I guess.

202
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,406
Isn't that wild?

203
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:51,720
Stick your finger
up the wrong person's ass?

204
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:58,881
A friend of mine broke his hand,
and it was put in a cast.

205
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,725
Next day he falls,
protects his bad hand,

206
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:07,008
then he breaks his good one.
He breaks that one, too.

207
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:11,084
So now he's got two busted flippers,
so I said to him,

208
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:15,927
"Creighton, I hope
your wife really loves you,

209
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:21,164
'cause for the next five weeks
you can't even wipe your own ass."

210
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:28,729
That's the test, ain't it?
Test of true love.

211
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:30,528
I got a job for you.

212
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:39,799
If the pay's right and it's legal,
I'll do it.

213
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:42,246
It's not strictly legal.

214
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:48,846
If the pay's right, I'll do it.

215
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:53,963
It's in reference to that gentleman
and my wife.

216
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:56,888
The more I think about it,

217
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,403
the more irritated I get.

218
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:06,208
Could you tell me what you want me
to do, or is it a secret?

219
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:08,327
This is no joke.

220
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:17,761
You want me to kill 'em.

221
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:25,965
Well?

222
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:27,718
Well, what?

223
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:32,120
What do you think?

224
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,440
You're an idiot.

225
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:37,964
So, this wouldn't interest you, huh?

226
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:42,362
I didn't say that. All I said was
you're an idiot.

227
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:46,879
You've been thinking about it so much
it's driving you simple.

228
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,206
I'll give you 10,000 dollars.

229
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:56,806
I'm supposed to do a murder,

230
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:59,600
or two murders,

231
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,079
and trust you
not to go simple on me

232
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,605
and do something stupid.
I mean

233
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:06,567
really stupid.

234
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:10,365
Why should I trust you?

235
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,248
For the money.

236
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:14,159
The money.

237
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:21,362
That's a right lot of money.

238
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:26,843
In Russia,

239
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:30,964
they make only fifty cents a day.

240
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:46,728
I want you...

241
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:49,478
to go fishing.

242
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:53,885
What?
- Go down to Corpus for a few days.

243
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:55,768
Get yourself noticed.

244
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:58,319
I'll give you a call when it's done.

245
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:03,286
You just find a way
to cover that money.

246
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,321
I'll take care of the money.
You make sure

247
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:29,845
those bodies aren't found.

248
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:37,441
There's a big incinerator
behind my place.

249
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:47,038
Do you want

250
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:50,043
like a townhouse?
Or your own apartment?

251
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:59,126
I'll show you around.

252
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,963
Are you sure this apartment is vacant?

253
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:04,519
Yes! I was just explaining to him

254
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:06,248
that he moved out yesterday.

255
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:10,324
Don't mind Mr. Garcia.
He used to be my brother-in-law.

256
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:14,888
Looks like the state legislature
is out of session.

257
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:19,239
I thought this was where they met.
- You're gonna help me.

258
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:23,324
I am? - Keep an eye on Mary and Ray.
Make sure nothing happens.

259
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:26,243
Let's show our appreciation
for Lorraine.

260
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:30,608
A registered nurse from Bolton, Texas.
How about it, gentlemen?

261
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:34,039
Alright, see you, Meurice.
Any time.

262
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:38,522
You don't have to worry for a while.
Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.

263
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:43,247
He's in the house!

264
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:47,087
He's in the house.

265
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:48,478
What's the matter?

266
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:52,564
I could have sworn I heard something.
- Door's locked.

267
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:54,243
Nothin' there.

268
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:57,887
Well,

269
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:02,919
we wouldn't have heard anything,
if it'd been him. He's real careful.

270
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,561
Fact is...

271
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,047
he's anal.

272
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:14,119
He told me himself. He said,

273
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:17,248
"In here,

274
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:21,525
in here I'm anal."

275
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:27,838
I'll be damned!

276
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:30,399
I couldn't believe it myself.

277
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:37,041
Me, on the other hand,
I got lots of personality.

278
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:42,282
Marty always said I had too much.
He was never big on personality.

279
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:46,600
He sent me to a psychiatrist
to see if he could calm me down.

280
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:47,998
Yeah?

281
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:50,966
What happened?
- Psychiatrist said

282
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:54,122
I was the healthiest person
he ever met. Marty fired him.

283
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:56,840
I don't think
you can fire a psychiatrist.

284
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:00,241
I never saw him again,
I can tell you that. I said,

285
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:05,805
"Marty, how come you're anal
and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?"

286
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:08,163
What did he say?

287
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:12,357
Nothing.
He's like you. He doesn't say much.

288
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:13,963
Thanks.

289
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:17,167
Except when he doesn't say things,
they're usually nasty.

290
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:20,561
When you don't,
they're usually nice.

291
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:28,525
You ever get tired?
- Oh yeah, I guess.

292
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,559
Hello?
- Marty?

293
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,282
Catch any fish?

294
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:40,718
What?

295
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:42,960
Catch any fish?

296
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:48,403
What kind of fish?
- Listen, is it done?

297
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:50,959
Yes, sir. You owe me some money.

298
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:54,088
If you're fucking with me,
you'll regret it.

299
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:04,603
They look good.

300
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,718
Why? You want a couple?

301
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:11,642
Just the 10,000 will be fine.

302
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:19,243
You got something to show me first?

303
00:35:58,329 --> 00:35:59,364
Dead?

304
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:01,122
So it seems.

305
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:10,443
What'd you do with the bodies?
- Taken care of.

306
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:13,883
The less you know about it,
the better.

307
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:20,798
Jesus!

308
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:23,482
I don't believe it.

309
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:30,241
I'm gonna be sick.

310
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,239
I'm gonna want that picture back.

311
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,440
You did say something about the money.

312
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:15,328
Yeah, the money.

313
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:18,362
Something I gotta ask you.

314
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:22,398
I've been very, very careful.

315
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:25,609
Have you been very, very careful?

316
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:29,644
Of course.
- Nobody knows you hired me?

317
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:31,926
Don't be stupid.

318
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:34,680
I'm not about to tell anyone.

319
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,164
We have to learn to be discreet.

320
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:44,728
Trust each other.

321
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:57,722
For richer, for poorer.

322
00:37:58,129 --> 00:38:02,486
Don't say that. Your marriages
don't turn out so hot.

323
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:07,480
How did you cover the money?
- It's been taken care of.

324
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:11,121
The less you know about it,
the better.

325
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:15,239
I made a call.

326
00:38:15,649 --> 00:38:17,048
It'll be all right.

327
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:19,679
I must've gone money simple.

328
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,125
A murder like this...

329
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:23,928
...too risky.

330
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:27,238
You shouldn't have done it.

331
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:30,127
Can't have it both ways.

332
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:46,482
Count it

333
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:48,838
and go.

334
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:53,607
I trust you.

335
00:40:09,129 --> 00:40:11,245
Who looks stupid now?

336
00:41:58,769 --> 00:41:59,884
Damn!

337
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:35,120
What's the matter? You deaf?

338
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:51,638
You home?

339
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:05,920
What night is tonight?

340
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,557
What night is it?

341
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:09,880
Tuesday?
- Tuesday night is ladies' night.

342
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:13,122
What?
- Tuesday night is ladies' night.

343
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:15,042
All your drinks are free.

344
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:21,086
...increased over 80%

345
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:24,128
in the last three years.
What's more,

346
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:29,679
in two years' time we'll be
experiencing the Jupiter effect.

347
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:36,883
Then all the planets in the universe
will cause this unbelievable...

348
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:51,448
...and these will be the sons
of which we shall know.

349
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,725
Although real good people
disagree with me,

350
00:47:59,449 --> 00:48:00,848
I believe

351
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:04,965
that this Antichrist
is alive today

352
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:10,045
living in the ten nation alliance
I was talking about...

353
00:48:11,729 --> 00:48:13,685
This is WKLJ,

354
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:15,488
"Through the Night."

355
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:18,919
I'm John Lievsay.

356
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:23,800
I'll be with you till six this morning
when Mike Miller will be stepping in.

357
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:29,239
Here's a request
we really had to dig for.

358
00:57:55,209 --> 00:57:57,484
Abby, you all right?

359
00:57:57,889 --> 00:57:59,880
Ray? What time is it?

360
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:02,757
I don't know. It's early.

361
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:06,688
I love you.

362
00:58:09,249 --> 00:58:11,001
You all right?

363
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:13,127
I don't know.

364
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:14,928
I better get off now.

365
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,206
I'll see you.

366
00:58:18,649 --> 00:58:20,128
Thanks, Ray.

367
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:17,478
Shit!

368
01:01:17,689 --> 01:01:19,168
Why didn't you get into bed?

369
01:01:20,169 --> 01:01:23,286
I didn't think I could sleep.

370
01:01:23,689 --> 01:01:25,486
I'm surprised you could.

371
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:29,880
You called me this morning.

372
01:01:32,969 --> 01:01:35,767
I wanted to let you know
that everything was all right.

373
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:38,479
I took care of everything.

374
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:40,880
All we have to do is keep our heads.

375
01:01:41,809 --> 01:01:44,642
What do you mean?
- I know about it.

376
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:49,283
I went to the bar last night.
- What happened?

377
01:01:49,689 --> 01:01:52,078
Was Meurice there?
- Yeah.

378
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:55,686
But he didn't see me though.

379
01:01:57,409 --> 01:01:58,922
Nobody saw me.

380
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:02,117
Is it cold in here?

381
01:02:02,729 --> 01:02:03,718
What happened?

382
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:09,842
I cleaned it all up.

383
01:02:10,249 --> 01:02:13,639
But that ain't important.
What we do now is important.

384
01:02:14,049 --> 01:02:16,279
We can't go around half-cocked.

385
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:22,124
We need time to think about this.

386
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:24,928
Figure it out.

387
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:26,842
We got some time now,

388
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:29,408
but we gotta be smart.

389
01:02:30,969 --> 01:02:33,324
Never point a gun at anyone
unless you mean to shoot him.

390
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:36,243
And if you shoot,
make sure he's dead.

391
01:02:36,649 --> 01:02:38,480
'cause if he ain't,
he's gonna kill you.

392
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:42,359
It's the only thing we learned
in the service that's worth a goddamn.

393
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:49,277
Where the hell's my windbreaker?

394
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:55,561
Tell me what happened.

395
01:02:58,329 --> 01:02:59,921
That ain't important.

396
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:03,758
What's important is that we did it.
Only that matters.

397
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:06,322
We both did it for each other.

398
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:10,688
That's what's important. - Don't know
what you're talking about.

399
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:15,843
I mean,

400
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:18,046
what are you talking about?

401
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:20,926
I haven't done anything funny.

402
01:03:23,529 --> 01:03:24,678
What was that?

403
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:27,080
You're not even acting like yourself.

404
01:03:27,489 --> 01:03:30,322
First, you call me at 5 a.m.,
saying all kinds of nice things,

405
01:03:30,729 --> 01:03:35,519
then you come chargin' in, scaring me
half to death without telling me why.

406
01:03:38,129 --> 01:03:39,164
I mean,

407
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:43,084
if you two had a fight...
I don't care,

408
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:45,603
just as long as...

409
01:03:53,089 --> 01:03:54,647
Pick it up.

410
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:06,598
What?

411
01:04:22,369 --> 01:04:24,007
Well, it's him.

412
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:27,118
Who?

413
01:04:42,489 --> 01:04:44,480
What's going on with you two?

414
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,168
All right.

415
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:07,557
You can call him back,
whoever it was.

416
01:05:09,849 --> 01:05:11,726
I'll get out of your way.

417
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:23,768
You left your weapon behind.

418
01:05:40,289 --> 01:05:42,598
Hi, Meurice, this is Helene Trend.

419
01:05:43,009 --> 01:05:46,160
What the hell does that remark
you made about Sylvia mean?

420
01:05:46,569 --> 01:05:49,641
She says you're full of shit.
I believe her, and I love you, too.

421
01:05:50,049 --> 01:05:54,201
Call me soon, 'cause I'm goin'
to South America tonight, to Uruguay.

422
01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:55,928
Listen, asshole, it's Marty.

423
01:05:56,329 --> 01:06:00,527
I just got back from Corpus Christi.
A lot of money's missing.

424
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:04,080
I'm not saying you took it,
but the place was your responsibility.

425
01:06:04,489 --> 01:06:06,957
I told you to keep an eye
on your asshole friend.

426
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:09,803
Don't come to the bar tonight...

427
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:11,642
What is this?

428
01:06:12,049 --> 01:06:15,928
The bar's gonna be closed tonight.
I got business to do. But tomorrow

429
01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:20,208
I wanna have a word with you and Ray,
if you can find him.

430
01:06:53,889 --> 01:06:56,005
I hope you're planning
on leaving town.

431
01:06:56,409 --> 01:06:57,762
You got a problem?

432
01:06:58,169 --> 01:07:02,924
No, but you do, cowboy.
- Have you been to the bar? - Why?

433
01:07:03,329 --> 01:07:05,718
You shouldn't have taken
the fuckin' money! Look at me!

434
01:07:06,129 --> 01:07:09,405
I'm serious! You broke in the bar
and ripped off the fuckin' safe!

435
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:12,482
Abby warned me about you.
Know what your problem is?

436
01:07:12,889 --> 01:07:17,121
You're too fuckin' obvious. Only you
and me know the combination, and Abby,

437
01:07:17,529 --> 01:07:19,804
maybe.
These fuckin' things are coffin nails!

438
01:07:22,249 --> 01:07:23,238
Hey, look.

439
01:07:23,649 --> 01:07:28,325
I don't give a shit. Marty is
a hard-on, but you gotta do somethin'.

440
01:07:28,729 --> 01:07:33,325
Say you're sorry. Give the money back.
Get the fuck outta here... something!

441
01:07:35,209 --> 01:07:36,198
Shit!

442
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:42,044
It's very humiliating
preaching about this bullshit!

443
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:47,162
But I'm not laughin'.
So you know it's no fuckin' joke!

444
01:08:10,649 --> 01:08:12,048
Damn!

445
01:12:53,009 --> 01:12:55,159
Lover boy oughta lock the door.

446
01:12:57,849 --> 01:12:59,168
I love you.

447
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:03,440
Stupid thing to say, right.

448
01:13:06,569 --> 01:13:08,366
I love you, too.

449
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:10,641
No.

450
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:15,084
You're just saying that,
because you're scared.

451
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:22,200
You left your weapon behind.

452
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:27,486
He'll kill you, too.

453
01:14:19,529 --> 01:14:22,168
Where is everything?

454
01:14:24,889 --> 01:14:26,288
In the trunk.

455
01:14:29,569 --> 01:14:30,843
In the car.

456
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:37,123
You leavin'?

457
01:14:37,529 --> 01:14:39,167
Isn't that what you want?

458
01:14:42,929 --> 01:14:44,044
Wanna come with me?

459
01:14:45,409 --> 01:14:47,764
I gotta know what happened first.

460
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:03,001
What d'you wanna know?

461
01:15:05,129 --> 01:15:07,597
You broke into the bar.
You wanted to get your money.

462
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:10,807
You and Marty had a fight.
And something happened...

463
01:15:12,889 --> 01:15:15,084
I don't know...
Wasn't it you?

464
01:15:17,769 --> 01:15:20,761
Maybe a burglar broke in...
- With your gun.

465
01:15:22,289 --> 01:15:24,245
Nobody broke in.

466
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:27,961
I'll tell you the truth.

467
01:15:34,889 --> 01:15:36,368
Truth is...

468
01:15:39,329 --> 01:15:42,401
I've been feelin' sick
the last couple of days.

469
01:15:45,449 --> 01:15:47,041
Can't sleep.

470
01:15:48,889 --> 01:15:50,766
Can't eat.

471
01:15:52,969 --> 01:15:56,962
When I try...

472
01:16:09,969 --> 01:16:11,368
Truth is,

473
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:16,165
he was alive when I buried him.

474
01:16:33,809 --> 01:16:36,084
Yeah, just a second!

475
01:16:41,569 --> 01:16:45,562
What's the matter? - I think
Marty's dead. Can I come in?

476
01:16:47,209 --> 01:16:50,724
That's bullshit! Marty called me
after he was jacked up.

477
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:15,769
I don't know where Marty is,
but he's not dead.

478
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:18,000
You relax, and I'll go find him.

479
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:21,446
And stay away from Ray.
The guy's gone nuts.

480
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:02,280
Turn it off.

481
01:19:10,969 --> 01:19:12,402
Just turn it off!

482
01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:16,642
Why?

483
01:19:18,889 --> 01:19:20,766
No curtains on the windows.

484
01:19:22,129 --> 01:19:23,244
So?

485
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:28,887
I think someone's watchin'.
- So what'll they see?

486
01:19:29,289 --> 01:19:30,642
Leave it off!

487
01:19:32,209 --> 01:19:33,847
If you do anything
the neighbors'll hear.

488
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:43,247
You think...

489
01:19:45,049 --> 01:19:47,005
I meant it...

490
01:19:48,209 --> 01:19:49,722
when I called.

491
01:19:52,089 --> 01:19:53,920
I love you, too.

492
01:19:54,329 --> 01:19:56,524
You're scared.

493
01:21:49,249 --> 01:21:50,568
All right.

494
01:21:50,969 --> 01:21:53,767
You got some of my personal property.

495
01:22:05,449 --> 01:22:07,007
One of you do.

496
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:20,927
I don't know what the hell you two
thought you were gonna pull off.

497
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:13,401
I'm not afraid of you, Marty.

498
01:28:31,969 --> 01:28:32,958
Well, ma'am.

499
01:28:33,929 --> 01:28:38,320
If I see him,
I'll sure give him the message.
