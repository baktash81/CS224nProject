<i>Why, it's Maleficent.</i>

84
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,327
What does she want here?

85
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:58,423
Shhh.

86
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,058
Well...

87
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:03,264
Quite a glittering
assemblage, King Stefan.

88
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:09,436
Royalty, nobility,
the gentry, and...

89
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:12,537
ah ha ha ha ha...
how quaint.

90
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,445
<i>Even the rabble.</i>

91
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:15,540
Ooooh.

92
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,448
I really felt
quite distressed...

93
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:19,419
at not receiving
an invitation.

94
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:20,545
You weren't wanted.

95
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:23,785
Not wa... ah ha.

96
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:26,885
Oh, dear,
what an awkward situation.

97
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:29,055
<i>I had hoped</i>
<i>it was merely due...</i>

98
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:30,757
<i>to some oversight.</i>

99
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:33,562
Well, in that event,
I'd best be on my way.

100
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:34,795
And...

101
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:37,236
you're not offended,
Your Excellency?

102
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:40,866
Why, no, Your Majesty...

103
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:43,502
and to show I bear
no ill will...

104
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:49,346
I, too, shall bestow
a gift on the child.

105
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:51,943
Listen well, all of you.

106
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:59,183
The Princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty...

107
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:03,561
beloved by all
who know her.

108
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:06,226
But...

109
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:09,498
before the sun sets
on her sixteenth birthday...

110
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:12,005
she shall prick her finger...

111
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,564
<i>on the spindle</i>
<i>of a spinning wheel...</i>

112
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,509

Oh, no!

114
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:19,205
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

115
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,374
<i>Seize that creature!</i>

116
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,110
Stand back, you fools!

117
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:37,396
Don't despair,
Your Majesties.

118
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:40,229
Merryweather still has
her gift to give.

119
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:43,965
Then she can undo
this fearful curse?

120
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:45,768
Oh, no, sire.

121
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:48,741
Maleficent's powers
are far too great.

122
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:51,301
But she can help.

123
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:54,073
But...

124
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:55,912
<i>Just do</i>
<i>your best, dear.</i>

125
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,939
<i>Yes, go on.</i>

126
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:00,749
Sweet Princess...

127
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:03,482
<i>If through this</i>
<i>wicked witch's trick...</i>

128
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:05,752
<i>a spindle should</i>

129
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,522
<i>a ray of hope</i>
<i>there still may be in this...</i>

00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:12,189
<i>the gift I give to thee.</i>

131
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:15,166
<i>Not in death,</i>

132
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,566
<i>this fateful prophecy</i>

133

<i>"that every spinning wheel</i>

Oh, silly...

143
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:13,291
Now, come have a nice
cup of tea, dear.

144
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:15,555
I'm sure it will
work out somehow.

145
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:18,791
Well, a bonfire won't
stop Maleficent.

146
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,094
Of course not,
but what will?

147
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,998
<i>Perhaps if we</i>
<i>reason with her...</i>

148
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:24,059
Reason?

149
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:25,296
With Maleficent?

150
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:27,032
Well, she can't be
all bad.

151
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:29,006
<i>Oh, yes, she can.</i>

152
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:33,705
Oooh. I'd like to turn her
into a fat, old hop toad.

153
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:36,976
Now, dear, that isn't
a very nice thing to say.

154
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:38,346
<i>Besides, we can't.</i>

155
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,578
You know our magic
doesn't work that way.

156
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,280
it can only do good, dear...

157
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:44,312
to bring joy and happiness.

158
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:46,347
Well, <i>that</i> would
make me happy.

159
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:46,525
But there must be some way.

160
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:50,086
But there must be some way.

161
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:51,356
There is!

162
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:53,921
There is?
What is it, Flora?

163
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,763
I'm going to...

164
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:57,462
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

165
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:59,800
[QUIETLY
Even walls have ears.

166
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,299
Follow me.

167
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:22,823
I'll turn her into a flower.

168
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,294
Maleficent?

169
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,729
No, no, dear, the Princess.

170
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:29,290
Oh, she'd make
a lovely flower.

171
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,301
Don't you see?

172
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,802
A flower can't prick its finger.

173
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:32,804
it hasn't any.

174
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,066
That's right.

175
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:36,301
<i>She'll be perfectly safe.</i>

176
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:38,707
Until Maleficent
sends a frost.

177
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:40,507
Yes. Er...

178
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:42,376
Oh, dear.

179
00:12:42,414 --> 00:12:45,815
She always ruins
your nicest flowers.

180
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,409
You're right...

181
00:12:47,452 --> 00:12:50,512
and she'll be expecting us
to do something like that.

182
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:51,954
Oooh.

183
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,753
Well, what won't she expect?

184
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,453
She knows everything.

185
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,325
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.

186
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:00,263
Maleficent doesn't know
anything about love...

187
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,030
or kindness or the joy
of helping others.

188
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:06,765
<i>You know, sometimes</i>
<i>I don't think...</i>

189
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:08,830
<i>she's really very happy.</i>

190
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:10,136
That's it.

191
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:11,733
Of course.

192
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,904
It's the only thing
she can't understand...

193
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:15,606
and won't expect.

194
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,773
Oh!

195
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:17,873
Now, now, now...

196
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,474
we have to plan it carefully.

197
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:21,782
<i>Let's see,</i>
<i>the woodcutter's cottage.</i>

198
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,549
<i>Yes, yes, yes,</i>
<i>the abandoned one.</i>

199
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:26,113
Of course, the King and Queen
will object...

200
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:28,786
<i>but when we explain</i>
<i>it's the only way...</i>

201
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:31,796
<i>Explain what?</i>

202
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,028
About the three peasant women
raising a foundling child...

203
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,865
deep in the forest.

204
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:39,302
Oh?

205
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:41,363
Well, that's very nice of them.

206
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:42,373
Who are they?

207
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:44,341
Turn around.

208
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:49,707
- Why, it's us!
- Uh-huh.

209
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:51,238
You mean we us?

210
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:52,250
Uh-huh.

211
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:54,047
Take care of the baby?

212
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:55,246
<i>Why not?</i>

213
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,585
<i>Oh, I'd like that!</i>

214
00:13:57,622 --> 00:14:00,022
Well, y-yes, but we'd have
to feed it...

215
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:03,755
And wash it and dress it
and rock it to sleep.

216
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:04,921
Oh, I'd love it.

217
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:06,624
You really think we can?

218
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:08,826
If humans can do it,
so can we.

219
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,267
And we'd have
our magic to help us.

220
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:12,770
<i>That's right.</i>

221
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:14,032
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

222
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:15,664
No magic.

223
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:18,039
I'll take those wands
right now.

224
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:20,772
Oh, better get rid
of those wings, too.

225
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:22,871
You mean live like mortals?

226
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:24,848
For sixteen years?

227
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:26,282
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

228
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:28,582
But now... now
we don't know how.

229
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,611
We've never done anything
without magic.

230
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,249
And that's why Maleficent
will never suspect.

231
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,350
But who'll wash and cook?

232
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:37,294
Oh, we'll all pitch in.

233
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:38,796
I'll take care of the baby.

234
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,025
Let me have it, dear.

235
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,931
Come along, now.

236
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:46,426
We must tell
Their Majesties at once.

237
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:50,231
<i>Flora.</i>

238
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:52,266
<i>Flora.</i>

239
00:14:57,282 --> 00:14:59,477
<i> "So the King</i>
<i>and his Queen watched...</i>

240
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:01,042
<i>"with heavy hearts...</i>

241
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:04,317
<i>"as their most precious</i>
<i>possession, their only child...</i>

242
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:06,824
<i>"disappeared into the night."</i>

243
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:22,372
<i>"Many sad and lonely years</i>

244
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:25,376
<i>"for King Stefan</i>

245

246
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,776

247
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:33,512
<i>"the entire kingdom</i>

248
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:35,349
<i>"for everyone knew...</i>

00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:37,514
<i>"that as Long</i>

<i>"her evil prophecy</i>

253
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,203
It's incredible!

254
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:03,738
Sixteen years,
and not a trace of her!

255
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:06,751
<i>She couldn't have vanished</i>
<i>into thin air!</i>

256
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:10,915
Are you sure
you searched everywhere?

257
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:12,787
Yeah, yeah, uh...

258
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:14,917
Everywhere... we all did.

259
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,257
Yeah! Yeah!

260
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:19,328
And what about the town?

261
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:20,797
The forest? The mountains?

262
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:22,766
Uh, we check mountains...

263
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,268
uh... uh, forest...

264
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:28,101
Uh, houses and, uh,
let me see, uh...

265
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:29,800
and all the cradles.

266
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:31,138
Cradles?

267
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:33,474
Uh, yep, yep.
Ha ha ha ha.

268
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:35,480
Every cradle.

269
00:16:35,514 --> 00:16:37,778
Cradle?!

270
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:40,341
Did you hear that, my pet?

271
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:42,819
All these years...

272
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:45,550
<i>they've been looking</i>
<i>for a baby.</i>

273
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,285
Oh, ha ha ha!

274
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:58,631
Fools!

275
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,305
<i>Idiots!</i>

276
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:02,966
<i>Imbeciles!</i>

277
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:04,498
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

278
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:12,809
Ooh! Ooh!
Ouch! Ouch!

279
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:14,478
Ahhh.

280
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:20,256
Oh, they're hopeless...

281
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:24,490
a disgrace
to the forces of evil.

282
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:27,828
Oh, my pet.

283
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:30,357
You are my last hope.

284
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:33,496
Circle far and wide.

285
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:38,635
Search for a maid of sixteen,
with hair of sunshine gold...

286
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:41,168
and lips red as the rose.

287
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:45,205
Go, and do not fail me.

288
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:52,721
<i>"And so,</i>
<i>for sixteen Long years...</i>

289
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:54,725
<i>"the whereabouts</i>

290
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,226

<i>"and something extra special</i>

299
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:25,590
Well, now,
how about this one?

300
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:26,989
This is the one I picked.

301
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:29,050
Ooh, she'll look
beautiful in that.

302
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:30,891
Now, I thought
a few changes here.

303
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:31,953
Uh-huh.

304
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:33,089
Don't forget a pretty bow.

305
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:35,224
Yes, and raise
the shoulder line.

306
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,699
We'll make it blue.

307
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:37,827
Oh, no, dear, pink.

308
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:39,302
Of course, we'll need
a few pleats.

309
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:41,066
<i>Yes, but how are</i>
<i>we going to get her...</i>

310
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:42,198
<i>out of the house?</i>

311
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,265
<i>I'll think</i>
<i>of something.</i>

312
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:45,776
Well.

313
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,244
<i>And what are you</i>
<i>three dears up to?</i>

314
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,712
- Up to?
- Up to?

315
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:51,909
Up to? Er, er...

316
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,952
We... we want you
to pick some berries.

317
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:59,081
That's it... berries.

318
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:01,217
- Berries?
- Lots of berries.

319
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:03,227
But I picked berries yesterday.

320
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:05,729
Oh, we need more, dear.

321
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:07,698
Lots, lots more.

322
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:09,222
<i>Yes.</i>

323
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,701
<i>Now, don't hurry back, dear.</i>

324
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:13,260
But don't go too far.

325
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:14,635
And don't speak to strangers.

326
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:16,231
<i>Good-bye, dear.</i>

327
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:19,368
<i>Good-bye!</i>
<i>Good-bye!</i>

328
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:22,770
I wonder if she suspected.

329
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:24,247
Of course not.

330
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:25,306
Come on.

331
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,944
Oh, will she be surprised.

332
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:29,920
A real birthday party...

333
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:31,888
with a real birthday cake.

334
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:34,858
Yes, and a dress
a Princess can be proud of.

335
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:36,656
I'll get the wands.

336
00:19:36,695 --> 00:19:37,992
<i>Yes, you g...</i>

337
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,155
the wands?

338
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:40,357
Oh, no!

339
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:41,956
<i>No magic.</i>

340
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,525
But the sixteen years
are almost over.

341
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:46,594
We're taking no chances.

342
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:49,766
But I've never baked
a fancy cake.

343
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:51,833
Oh, you won't have to, dear.

344
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,037
I'm going to bake the cake.

345
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,046
You?

346
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,980
Oh, she's always
wanted to, dear...

347
00:19:57,015 --> 00:19:58,277
and this is her last chance.

348
00:19:58,316 --> 00:19:59,305
Well...

349
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,011
I'm going to make it
fifteen layers...

350
00:20:01,052 --> 00:20:03,179
with pink and blue
forget-me-nots.

351
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:05,086
And I'm making the dress.

352
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:08,820
But you can't sew,
and she's never cooked.

353
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,418
Oh, ho, ho, it's simple.

354
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:12,453
All you do is follow the book.

355
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:14,124
Up here, dear.

356
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:16,793
You can be the dummy.

357
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:20,293
Well, I still say
we ought to use magic.

358
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,503
<i> La la</i>
<i>la da da da da</i>

359
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,803
Dee dee dee deedle um

360
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:26,037
La da da

361
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:29,410
"Flour, 3 cups."

362
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:32,814
Cups, cups, cups, cups,
cups, cups, cups.

363
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:33,818
Oh.

364
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:35,376
Dee da dee da da dum

365
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,821
1, 2, 3.

366
00:20:38,857 --> 00:20:40,290
What's that for?

367
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:43,021
Well, it's got to have
a hole in the bottom.

368
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:45,359
<i>That's for the feet</i>
<i>to go through.</i>

369
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:49,731
It's pink.

370
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:51,998
Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?

371
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:53,936
But I wanted it blue.

372
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:55,303
Now, dear...

373
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,774
we decided pink was her color.

374
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,572
<i>You decided.</i>

375
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:15,919
"Two eggs, fold in gently."

376
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,518
Fold?

377
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:18,790
Oh, well.

378
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,894
I can't breathe!

379
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:27,901
Get me out of here!

380
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:32,074
it looks awful.

381
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,941
That's because
it's on you, dear.

382
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:36,970
"Now yeast, 1 tsp."

383
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:37,982
Tsp?

384
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:39,813
One teaspoon.

385
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:42,081
One teaspoon! Of course!

386
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,213
<i>Hmm.</i>

387
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,121
Oh, gracious!

388
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:52,754
How that child has grown!

389
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:56,665
Oh, it seems only yesterday
we brought her here.

390
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:59,465
Just a tiny baby.

391
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,437
Why, Merryweather!

392
00:22:03,474 --> 00:22:05,840
Whatever is the matter, dear?

393
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:08,675
After today,
she'll be a Princess...

394
00:22:08,713 --> 00:22:11,181
and we won't have
any Briar Rose.

395
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:12,843
Oh, Flora!

396
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:14,146
Now, now, now, now.

397
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:17,518
W-we... we all knew
this day had to come.

398
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:20,786
But why did it have
to come so soon?

399
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:22,156
After all...

400
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:24,559
we've had her for sixteen years.

401
00:22:24,596 --> 00:22:27,429
Sixteen wonderful years.

402
00:22:30,568 --> 00:22:32,001
Good gracious!

403
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:34,197
We're acting like
a lot of ninnies!

404
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:37,367
Come on! She'll be back
before we get started.

405
00:24:24,448 --> 00:24:27,212
Do you hear that, Samson?

406
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:28,275
Beautiful!

407
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:35,116
What is it?

408
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,490
Come on. Let's find out.

409
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:41,087
Aw, come on.

410
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:43,600
For an extra bucket of oats?

411
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:45,966
And a few... carrots?

412
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:48,628
Hup, boy!

413
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:20,836
<i>Whoa!</i>

414
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:36,783
No carrots.

415
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:51,498
<i>I wonder</i>

416
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:55,130
<i>I wonder</i>

417
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:59,108
<i>I wonder why</i>
<i>each little bird</i>

418
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:02,271
<i>Has a someone</i>

419
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:05,282
<i>To sing to</i>

420
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:08,513
<i>Sweet things to</i>

421
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:15,788
<i>A gay, little lark melody</i>

422
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:19,853
<i>I wonder</i>

423
00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:22,866
<i>I wonder</i>

424
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,529
<i>If my heart</i>
<i>keeps singing</i>

425
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,131
<i>Will my song</i>
<i>go winging</i>

426
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:33,632
<i>To someone</i>

427
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:37,477
<i>Who'll find me</i>

428
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:48,653
<i>And bring back</i>
<i>a Love song to me</i>

429
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:54,054
Oh, dear.

430
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:56,896
Why do they still
treat me like a child?

431
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,328
Whoo!

432
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:04,301
Aunt Flora, Aunt Fauna...

433
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:05,831
<i>Aunt Merryweather.</i>

434
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:09,770
They never want me
to meet anyone.

435
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:16,779
But you know something?

436
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:19,289
Whispering]
I fooled them.

437
00:27:19,323 --> 00:27:22,019
I have met someone.

438
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:23,185
Whoo!

439
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:28,163
Whoo! Whoo!

440
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:32,358
Oh... a Prince.

441
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:38,508
Well, he's tall
and handsome and...

442
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:40,635
and so romantic!

443
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:48,110
Oh, we walk together
and talk together...

444
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:51,212
and just before
we say good-bye...

445
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,314
he takes me in his arms...

446
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:55,619
And then...

447
00:27:57,461 --> 00:27:58,655
I wake up.

448
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,468
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>it's only in my dreams.</i>

449
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:08,904
<i>But they say if you dream</i>
<i>a thing more than once...</i>

450
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,169
it's sure to come true.

451
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:14,507
And I've seen him
so many times.

452
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,549
<i>You know, Samson...</i>

453
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:02,320
there's something strange
about that voice.

454
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:04,293
Too beautiful to be real.

455
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:08,326
<i>Maybe it was</i>
<i>some mysterious being...</i>

456
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:10,230
a... a wood sprite or a...

457
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:14,666
<i>Here! Stop!</i>

458
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:48,038
<i>Why,</i>
<i>it's my dream Prince!</i>

459
00:29:51,408 --> 00:29:53,876
Your Highness.

460
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,341
You know, I'm really
not supposed...

461
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,080
to speak to strangers...

462
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,054
but we've met before.

463
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:08,286
<i>I know you</i>

464
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:13,854
<i>I waked with you</i>
<i>once upon a dream</i>

465
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:16,422
<i>I know you</i>

466
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:22,064
<i>The gleam in your eyes</i>
<i>is so familiar a gleam</i>

467
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:25,872
<i>And I know it's true</i>

468
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:30,573
<i>That visions are seldom</i>
<i>all they seem</i>

469
00:30:30,614 --> 00:30:33,310
<i>But if I know you</i>

470
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,784
<i>I know what you'll do</i>

471
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:39,050
<i>You'll Love me at once</i>

472
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:47,554
<i>The way you did once</i>
<i>upon a dream</i>

473
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,638
<i>But if I know you</i>

474
00:30:57,675 --> 00:31:00,371
<i>I know what you'll do</i>

475
00:31:00,411 --> 00:31:03,812
<i>You'll Love me at once</i>

476
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:10,275
<i>The way you did</i>
<i>once upon a dream</i>

477
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,221
Oh!

478
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:14,451
Oh!

479
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:15,822
I'm awfully sorry.

480
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:18,020
I didn't mean to frighten you.

481
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:20,496
Oh, it... wasn't that.

482
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:23,261
It's just that
you're a... a...

483
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,733
A stranger?

484
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:25,792
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

485
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:26,928
<i>But don't you remember?</i>

486
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,437
<i>We've met before.</i>

487
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:29,564
We... we have?

488
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:30,595
Well, of course.

489
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:31,835
You said so yourself.

490
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:34,070
"Once upon a dream."

491
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:36,545
<i>I know you</i>

492
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:42,075
<i>I walked with you</i>
<i>once upon a dream</i>

493
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,282
<i>I know you</i>

494
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,347
<i>The gleam in your eyes</i>

495
00:31:47,391 --> 00:31:51,259
<i>Is so familiar a gleam</i>

496
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:57,825
<i>And I know it's true</i>

497
00:31:57,868 --> 00:32:03,306
<i>That visions are</i>
<i>seldom all they seem</i>

498
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,276
<i>But if I know you</i>

499
00:32:07,311 --> 00:32:10,212
<i>I know what you'll do</i>

500
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:13,444
<i>You'll Love me at once</i>

501
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:17,215
<i>The way you did once</i>

502
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:26,253
<i>Upon a dream</i>

503
00:32:30,768 --> 00:32:32,463
Who are you?

504
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:33,936
What's your name?

505
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:36,231
Hmm?

506
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,566
Oh. My name.

507
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,339
Why, it's...

508
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:42,811
it's...

509
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:44,177
Oh, no, no! I can't! I...

510
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:46,816
Good-bye!

511
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,112
But when will I see you again?

512
00:32:48,152 --> 00:32:50,017
Oh, never! Never!

513
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,816
<i>Never!</i>

514
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:54,323
Well... maybe someday.

515
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:55,791
When? Tomorrow?

516
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:58,556
<i>Oh, no. This evening.</i>

517
00:32:58,595 --> 00:32:59,653
<i>Where?</i>

518
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:02,096
At the cottage, in the glen.

519
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:12,002
There.

520
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:13,304
Whoop!

521
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:20,613
Well, what do you think of it?

522
00:33:20,651 --> 00:33:22,278
Why, it...

523
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,254
it's a very unusual
cake, isn't it?

524
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:27,018
Yes.

525
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:29,855
Of course, it will be
much stiffer after it's baked.

526
00:33:29,893 --> 00:33:31,360
<i>Of course, dear.</i>

527
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:33,886
Um... what do you
think of the dress?

528
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:35,865
Well, it... it's...

529
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:37,764
<i>It-it's not exactly...</i>

530
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,530
<i>the way it is in</i>
<i>the book, is it?</i>

531
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,470
Oh, I improved it.

532
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:44,338
But perhaps if I added
a few more ruffles...

533
00:33:44,374 --> 00:33:46,433
uh, what do you think?

534
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:49,377
Um... I think so.

535
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:51,005
What do you think,
Merryweather?

536
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:55,075
I think we've had enough
of this nonsense!

537
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:56,949
I think we ought
to think of Rose

538
00:33:56,987 --> 00:34:00,081
and what she'll
think of this mess!

539
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,751
I still think what
I thunk before.

540
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,818
<i>I'm going to get those wands!</i>

541
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,963
You know... I think
she's right.

542
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,534
Here they are!
Good as new!

543
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,901
<i>Uh, uh, tut,</i>
<i>tut, tut, tut...</i>

544
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:17,736
C-c-careful, Merryweather.

545
00:34:17,774 --> 00:34:18,763
Quick!

546
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:20,902
Lock the doors.

547
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:22,707
<i>Fauna,</i>
<i>you close the windows.</i>

548
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:25,715
<i>Oh, plug up every cranny.</i>

549
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:27,717
We can't take any chances.

550
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:31,778
Now, you take care
of the cake.

551
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:32,789
<i>While I...</i>

552
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:34,256
Clean the room, dear.

553
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:36,953
And I'll make the dress.

554
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:37,961
<i>Now, hurry!</i>

555
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,087
Ooh!

556
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:43,392
Come on,
bucket, mop, broom.

557
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:46,231
<i>Flora says,</i>
<i>"Clean up the room."</i>

558
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,779
And now, to make a lovely dress

559
00:34:57,814 --> 00:35:00,112
fit to grace a fair Princess.

560
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:04,512
<i>Eggs, flour, lemon</i>

561
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:08,190
Just do it like it
says here in the book.

562
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:10,125
I'll put on the candles.

563
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:04,348
Oh, no! Not pink!

564
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:06,316
Oh, no! Not pink!

565
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,817
Make it blue!

566
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:10,813
Merryweather!

567
00:36:10,854 --> 00:36:11,946
Make it pink.

568
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:17,052
Whispering]
Make it blue.

569
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:21,423
Oh! Pink!

570
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,392
Blue!

571
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:20,582
<i>Oh, now look</i>
<i>what you've done!</i>

572
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,025
Shh! Shh! Listen!

573
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,494
It's Rose!

574
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:26,928
She's back!

575
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:28,328
Enough of this foolishness!

576
00:37:32,135 --> 00:37:33,227
Make it pink.

577
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,033
Now hide! Quick!

578
00:37:37,941 --> 00:37:39,568
Whispering]
Blue!

579
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:41,270
Aunt Flora!

580
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:45,143
Good gracious!

581
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,412
<i>Who left the mop running?</i>

582
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:49,783
Stop, mop!

583
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:53,651
Aunt Flora!

584
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,181
Fauna! Merryweather!

585
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:00,752
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

586
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:03,459
Oh!

587
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,593
<i>Surprise! Surprise!</i>

588
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:07,626
Happy Birthday!

589
00:38:07,671 --> 00:38:09,070
Oh, you darlings!

590
00:38:09,106 --> 00:38:11,973
This is the happiest day
of my life!

591
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:14,476
Everything's so wonderful!

592
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:16,342
Just wait till you meet him!

593
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:17,607
Him?

594
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:19,012
Rose!

595
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:21,142
You've met some stranger?

596
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,584
Oh, he's not a stranger.

597
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,247
We've met before.

598
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:26,255
You have?

599
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:27,415
Where?

600
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:29,652
Once upon a dream.

601
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:32,321
<i>I know you</i>

602
00:38:32,362 --> 00:38:38,028
<i>I walked with you</i>
<i>once upon a dream</i>

603
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,831
She's in love!

604
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,668
- Oh, no!
- This is terrible!

605
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:44,571
Why?

606
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:46,166
After all, I am sixteen.

607
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:48,268
it isn't that, dear.

608
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:50,336
You're already betrothed.

609
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,472
Betrothed?

610
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:53,210
Since the day you were born.

611
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,184
To Prince Phillip, dear.

612
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:57,345
But that's impossible.

613
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:59,048
How could I marry a Prince?

614
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,317
<i>I'd have to be...</i>

615
00:39:00,357 --> 00:39:01,381
A Princess.

616
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:02,755
And you are, dear.

617
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:04,316
Princess Aurora.

618
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:08,957
<i>Tonight, we're taking you back</i>
<i>to your father, King Stefan.</i>

619
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,433
But... but I can't!

620
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:13,197
He's coming here tonight.

621
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:14,498
<i>I promised to meet him.</i>

622
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:16,028
<i>I'm sorry, child.</i>

623
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:20,168
But you must never see
that young man again.

624
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,303
Oh, no! No!

625
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:24,643
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

626
00:39:24,681 --> 00:39:27,582
No! No!

627
00:39:32,255 --> 00:39:35,315
And we thought
she'd be so happy.

628
00:39:50,374 --> 00:39:52,342
No sign of her yet, Hubert.

629
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:55,311
Of course not.

630
00:39:55,345 --> 00:39:57,540
It's a good half-hour
till sunset.

631
00:40:01,785 --> 00:40:03,412
Ah, excellent bird.

632
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:05,717
Mmm!

633
00:40:05,756 --> 00:40:08,247
Aw, now, come, man!

634
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,485
Buck up!

635
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:11,084
Battle's over.

636
00:40:11,128 --> 00:40:13,028
<i>Girl is</i>
<i>as good as here.</i>

637
00:40:13,063 --> 00:40:14,394
I'm sorry, Hubert...

638
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:17,491
but after sixteen years
of worrying...

639
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:18,796
never knowing...

640
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:21,702
The past! All in the past!

641
00:40:27,544 --> 00:40:31,742
<i>Tonight,</i>
<i>we toast the future...</i>

642
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:34,114
with something I've
been saving for sixteen years.

643
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:39,077
Here!

644
00:40:39,122 --> 00:40:40,419
To the future!

645
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:41,754
<i>Right, Hubert.</i>

646
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:43,316
<i>To the future!</i>

647
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,963
Skumps! Skumps!

648
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:49,260
Skumps!

649
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:51,267
<i>A toast to this night</i>

650
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:53,201
<i>The outlook is rosy</i>

651
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:54,999
<i>The future is bright</i>

652
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:56,835
<i>Our children</i>
<i>will marry</i>

653
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:58,670
<i>Our kingdoms unite</i>

654
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:04,613
<i>Skumps, skumps,</i>
<i>skumps</i>

655
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:10,712
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>Excellent vintage!</i>

656
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:18,216
And now, to the new home, eh?

657
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:19,250
New home?

658
00:41:19,296 --> 00:41:20,888
Children need a nest
of their own, what?

659
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:24,292
<i>A place to raise their</i>
<i>little brood, eh?</i>

660
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:27,662
<i>Well,</i>
<i>I suppose, in time.</i>

661
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:30,002
<i>Of course! To the home!</i>

662
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,031
- Skumps!
- Skumps!

663
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,043
<i>A toast to the home</i>

664
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,544
<i>One grander, by far</i>

665
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,570
<i>Than a palace in Rome</i>

666
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:39,309
Uh, let me fill up your glass.

667
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:41,408
Ha! Ha! That last
was all foam.

668
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:46,753
<i>Skumps, skumps, skumps</i>

669
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:55,622
The plans!

670
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:03,037
<i>Weir,</i>
<i>what do you think?</i>

671
00:42:03,073 --> 00:42:05,132
Nothing elaborate, of course.

672
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:07,302
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.

673
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:09,039
Honeymoon cottage, really.

674
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,307
You... you mean...

675
00:42:10,347 --> 00:42:12,372
you're building it already?

676
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:14,280
Built, man! Finished!

677
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:16,148
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.

678
00:42:16,186 --> 00:42:17,551
Tomorrow?

679
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:20,351
But, Hubert, they're
not even married yet!

680
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,255
I'll take care of that tonight.

681
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,554
To the wedding!

682
00:42:23,593 --> 00:42:24,992
Now, hold on, Hubert.

683
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:27,326
<i>I haven't even seen</i>
<i>my daughter yet...</i>

684
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:29,298
<i>and you're taking her</i>
<i>away from me.</i>

685
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:30,731
<i>Getting</i>
<i>my Philip, aren't you?</i>

686
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:31,995
<i>Yes, but...</i>

687
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:34,196
<i>Want to see our</i>
<i>grandchildren, don't we?</i>

688
00:42:34,237 --> 00:42:35,397
Of course, but...

689
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:36,962
Well, there's no time to lose.

690
00:42:37,007 --> 00:42:38,406
Getting on in years.

691
00:42:38,441 --> 00:42:39,533
Ha! Ha! Ha!

692
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:41,407
To the wedding!

693
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:43,469
<i>Now,</i>
<i>be reasonable, Hubert.</i>

694
00:42:43,513 --> 00:42:47,609
<i>After all, Aurora knows</i>
<i>nothing about all this.</i>

695
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:49,482
- Well?
- Well, it... it...

696
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,079
may come as quite a shock.

697
00:42:53,356 --> 00:42:54,550
Shock?!

698
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,684
My Phillip a shock?!

699
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:59,661
What's wrong with my Phillip?

700
00:42:59,696 --> 00:43:02,290
Nothing, Hubert.
I only meant...

701
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,893
Why doesn't your daughter
like my son?

702
00:43:05,936 --> 00:43:07,062
Now, now...

703
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:11,369
I'm not so sure my son
likes your daughter!

704
00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:12,568
Now, see here...

705
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:14,804
I'm not so sure
my grandchildren...

706
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:17,574
want you for a grandfather!

707
00:43:17,614 --> 00:43:20,606
Why, you... you unreasonable...

708
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,642
pompous, blustering,
old windbag!

709
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,450
Unreasonable? Pompous?

710
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:27,046
En garde, sir!

711
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,523
I warn you, Hubert!

712
00:43:28,558 --> 00:43:29,684
This means war!

713
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:30,818
Forward!

714
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,794
For honor! For country! For...

715
00:43:42,305 --> 00:43:44,000
What's this all about, anyway?

716
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,769
Nothing, Hubert.

717
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:47,800
Absolutely nothing.

718
00:43:47,844 --> 00:43:50,745
The children are bound
to fall in love with each other.

719
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,111
Precisely.

720
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:53,615
And as for grandchildren...

721
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,880
I'll have
the royal woodcarvers...

722
00:43:55,919 --> 00:43:57,819
start work
on the cradle tomorrow!

723
00:43:57,854 --> 00:43:59,082
Splendid!

724
00:43:59,122 --> 00:44:00,817
King size, of course?

725
00:44:00,857 --> 00:44:01,824
Certainly.

726
00:44:01,858 --> 00:44:04,019
To the Woodcarver's Guild!

727
00:44:17,474 --> 00:44:19,806
<i>His Royal Highness...</i>

728
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:21,868
<i>Prince Philip!</i>

729
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:22,935
Phillip!

730
00:44:28,518 --> 00:44:30,611
Oh, Phillip!

731
00:44:30,654 --> 00:44:31,951
Phillip!

732
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:35,216
Phillip! Hold, Phillip!

733
00:44:41,464 --> 00:44:42,931
H-hurry, boy!

734
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:45,867
Hurry! Change into
something suitable!

735
00:44:45,902 --> 00:44:48,166
Can't meet your future bride
looking like that.

736
00:44:48,204 --> 00:44:49,831
But I have met her, Father.

737
00:44:49,873 --> 00:44:51,738
You have? Where?

738
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:52,901
Once upon a dream.

739
00:44:54,544 --> 00:44:56,774
Phillip!
Stop! Stop that!

740
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:59,805
Phillip! P-put me down!

741
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:03,046
Now... what's all
this dream nonsense?

742
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:04,576
it wasn't a dream, Father.

743
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:05,883
I really did meet her.

744
00:45:05,922 --> 00:45:07,253
The Princess Aurora?

745
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,417
Good heavens!
We must tell Stefan!

746
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:10,483
Why, this is the most...

747
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,461
I didn't say it was Aurora.

748
00:45:12,495 --> 00:45:14,486
You most certainly did!
You... you said that...

749
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:16,726
I said I met the girl
I was going to marry.

750
00:45:16,766 --> 00:45:18,256
I don't know who she was.

751
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:19,666
A peasant girl,
I suppose...

752
00:45:19,703 --> 00:45:21,466
A peasant g-girl?

753
00:45:21,504 --> 00:45:23,529
You're... you're going
to marry a...

754
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:25,564
Why, Phillip!

755
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:26,905
You're joking!

756
00:45:29,946 --> 00:45:31,538
Uh... isn't he?

757
00:45:33,383 --> 00:45:37,046
No! Y-you can't
do this to me!

758
00:45:37,087 --> 00:45:39,351
Give up the throne?
The kingdom?

759
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:42,153
For some... some nobody?

760
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:44,683
By Harry, I won't have it!

761
00:45:44,728 --> 00:45:46,059
You're a Prince!

762
00:45:46,096 --> 00:45:48,462
And you're going
to marry a Princess!

763
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:50,398
Now, Father, you're
living in the past.

764
00:45:50,433 --> 00:45:52,424
This is the 14th century.
Nowadays...

765
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:54,994
Nowadays,
I'm still the King!

766
00:45:55,038 --> 00:45:57,199
And I command you to come
to your senses!

767
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,571
And marry the girl I love.

768
00:45:58,608 --> 00:45:59,870
- Exactly!
- Good-bye, Father.

769
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:01,843
"Good-bye, Father.
Marry the girl you..."

770
00:46:01,878 --> 00:46:02,845
No, no!

771
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:04,540
No, no, Phillip, stop!

772
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:05,707
Come back!

773
00:46:05,749 --> 00:46:06,909
<i>Oh, Philip!</i>

774
00:46:12,288 --> 00:46:14,688
Phillip!

775
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:34,335
Oh!

776
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:38,575
Oh, how... how will
I ever tell Stefan?

777
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:26,788
Whispering]
Come along, now.

778
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:41,801
All right, in here, dear.

779
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:48,406
<i>Bolt the door,</i>
<i>Merryweather!</i>

780
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:50,385
<i>Fauna, pull the drapes!</i>

781
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:55,857
And now, dear,
if you'll just sit here.

782
00:47:55,892 --> 00:47:58,122
This one last gift...

783
00:47:58,161 --> 00:48:00,152
dear child for thee...

784
00:48:00,196 --> 00:48:03,757
the symbol of thy royalty.

785
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,759
A crown to wear
in grace and beauty,

786
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:11,035
as is thy right and royal duty.

787
00:48:15,378 --> 00:48:17,676
Now, dear.

788
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:18,874
Whispering]
Come.

789
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:23,450
Let her have
a few moments alone.

790
00:48:24,721 --> 00:48:26,916
It's that boy she met.

791
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:28,856
Whatever are we going to do?

792
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:14,634
Oh, I don't see why she has
to marry any old Prince.

793
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:18,003
Now, that's not
for us to decide, dear.

794
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:32,876
Maybe we should tell King Stefan
about the boy.

795
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:34,354
Well, why don't we?

796
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:35,583
Listen!

797
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:38,354
Maleficent! Rose!

798
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:39,917
Rose! Rose! Aah!

799
00:49:39,962 --> 00:49:42,487
<i>Oh, why did</i>
<i>we leave her alone?</i>

800
00:49:42,531 --> 00:49:44,556
Rose! Rose!

801
00:50:04,987 --> 00:50:06,648
Here.

802
00:50:06,688 --> 00:50:08,349
Rose! Rose!

803
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,517
Rose, where are you?

804
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,151
Where are you?

805
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:21,926
Rose!

806
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:35,741
Rose!

807
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:37,081
Rose!

808
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:49,621
Rose!

809
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:04,039
Rose, don't touch anything!

810
00:51:06,048 --> 00:51:08,380
<i>Touch the spindle.</i>

811
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:10,476
<i>Touch it, I say!</i>

812
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:18,884
You poor, simple fools.

813
00:51:18,927 --> 00:51:20,895
Thinking you could defeat me.

814
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:24,421
<i>Me, the mistress</i>
<i>of all evil!</i>

815
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,061
Well, here's your
precious Princess.

816
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:36,811
Rose!

817
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:39,439
Oh, Rose!

818
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:44,316
Oh, I'll never forgive myself.

819
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:46,547
<i>We're all to blame!</i>

820
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,120
Stefan, there's...

821
00:51:57,165 --> 00:51:59,759
there's something important
I have to tell you.

822
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:01,928
Not now, Hubert.

823
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:04,097
But it's about Phillip.

824
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:05,106
Phillip?

825
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,165
Oh, yes, of course, Phillip.

826
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:09,074
Why, where is the boy?

827
00:52:09,111 --> 00:52:11,409
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

828
00:52:11,446 --> 00:52:13,004
Well, send for him immediately!

829
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:14,276
- But...
- Shh!

830
00:52:16,985 --> 00:52:19,613
<i>The sun has set!</i>

831
00:52:19,654 --> 00:52:23,488
<i>Make ready to welcome</i>
<i>your Princess!</i>

832
00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:27,078
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.

833
00:53:27,122 --> 00:53:30,614
They'll be heartbroken
when they find out.

834
00:53:33,161 --> 00:53:35,288
They're not going to.

835
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,797
<i>They aren't?</i>

836
00:53:36,831 --> 00:53:38,594
We'll put them all to sleep...

837
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,965
until Rose awakens.

838
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:48,833
Come!

839
00:53:57,686 --> 00:54:05,024
<i>Sleeping beauty fair</i>

840
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,053
<i>Gold of sunshine</i>

841
00:54:09,097 --> 00:54:14,399
<i>In your hair</i>

842
00:54:14,436 --> 00:54:17,428
<i>Lips that shame</i>

843
00:54:17,472 --> 00:54:22,808
<i>The red, red rose</i>

844
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:26,109
<i>Dreaming of true Love</i>

845
00:54:26,147 --> 00:54:32,086
<i>In slumber repose</i>

846
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:40,459
<i>One day he will come</i>

847
00:54:40,495 --> 00:54:49,164
<i>Riding out of the dawn</i>

848
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:52,196
<i>And you'll awaken</i>

849
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,234
<i>To Love's first kiss</i>

850
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:02,444
<i>Till then,</i>
<i>Sleeping Beauty</i>

851
00:55:02,484 --> 00:55:07,319
<i>Sleep on</i>

852
00:55:07,355 --> 00:55:11,792
<i>One day you'll awaken</i>

853
00:55:11,826 --> 00:55:16,695
<i>To Love's first kiss</i>

854
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:24,866
<i>Till then,</i>
<i>Sleeping Beauty</i>

855
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:30,139
<i>Sleep on</i>

856
00:55:38,486 --> 00:55:41,751
Well, just been
talking to Phillip.

857
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:44,623
Seems he's fallen in love
with some...

858
00:55:44,659 --> 00:55:46,786
Peasant girl.

859
00:55:46,828 --> 00:55:49,023
Peasant girl?

860
00:55:49,064 --> 00:55:50,861
Yes? Yes?

861
00:55:52,734 --> 00:55:54,725
The peasant girl...
who is she?

862
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,236
Where did he meet her?

863
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:59,468
Just some peasant girl he met.

864
00:55:59,507 --> 00:56:01,236
Where?! Where?!

865
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:05,679
Once upon a dream.

866
00:56:05,714 --> 00:56:07,648
Once upon a dr...

867
00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:09,673
Rose! Prince Phillip!

868
00:56:09,718 --> 00:56:11,276
Oh! Oh!

869
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,552
Come on.

870
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:18,616
We've got to get back
to the cottage.

871
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,572
Whistling
<i>Once Upon a Dream]</i>

872
00:57:06,073 --> 00:57:07,267
<i>Come in!</i>

873
00:57:37,605 --> 00:57:39,800
Well...

874
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,298
this is a pleasant surprise.

875
00:57:43,344 --> 00:57:47,110
I set my trap
for a peasant, and lo,

876
00:57:47,147 --> 00:57:48,910
I catch a Prince!

877
00:57:52,486 --> 00:57:53,544
Away with him.

878
00:57:54,688 --> 00:57:56,349
But gently, my pets...

879
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,857
gently.

880
00:57:59,293 --> 00:58:03,491
I have plans
for our royal guest.

881
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:38,059
Maleficent!

882
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:39,759
She's got Prince Phillip!

883
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:42,391
At the forbidden mountain.

884
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:46,467
But we can't!
We can't go there!

885
00:58:46,507 --> 00:58:49,874
We can, and we must!

886
01:01:11,385 --> 01:01:13,353
What a pity Prince Phillip...

887
01:01:13,387 --> 01:01:16,686
can't be here to enjoy
the celebration.

888
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:20,860
Come.

889
01:01:20,894 --> 01:01:23,863
We must go to the dungeon
and cheer him up.

890
01:02:17,718 --> 01:02:20,243
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.

891
01:02:20,287 --> 01:02:22,255
Why so melancholy?

892
01:02:23,423 --> 01:02:26,517
A wondrous future lies
before you.

893
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,358
You, the destined hero...

894
01:02:29,396 --> 01:02:32,957
of a charming fairy tale
come true.

895
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:38,531
Behold...

896
01:02:38,572 --> 01:02:41,336
<i>King Stefan's castle...</i>

897
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,843
<i>And in yonder</i>
<i>topmost tower...</i>

898
01:02:43,877 --> 01:02:46,846
<i>Dreaming of her true Love...</i>

899
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,976
<i>the Princess Aurora.</i>

900
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:54,249
<i>But see the gracious</i>
<i>whim of fate.</i>

901
01:02:54,288 --> 01:02:57,724
<i>Why, 'tis the selfsame</i>
<i>peasant maid...</i>

902
01:02:57,758 --> 01:03:00,056
<i>who won the heart</i>
<i>of our noble Prince...</i>

903
01:03:00,093 --> 01:03:01,560
<i>but yesterday.</i>

904
01:03:04,731 --> 01:03:10,067
<i>She is indeed</i>
<i>most wondrous fair.</i>

905
01:03:10,103 --> 01:03:13,004
<i>Gold of sunshine</i>
<i>in her hair.</i>

906
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:17,500
<i>Lips that shame</i>
<i>the red, red rose.</i>

907
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,978
<i>In ageless sleep...</i>

908
01:03:20,013 --> 01:03:22,106
<i>she finds repose.</i>

909
01:03:24,284 --> 01:03:26,718
The years roll by...

910
01:03:26,753 --> 01:03:29,916
but a hundred years
to a steadfast heart...

911
01:03:29,957 --> 01:03:31,891
are but a day.

912
01:03:31,925 --> 01:03:35,725
<i>And now the gates</i>
<i>of a dungeon part...</i>

913
01:03:35,762 --> 01:03:40,426
<i>and our Prince</i>
<i>is free to go his way.</i>

914
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:44,870
<i>Off he rides</i>
<i>on his noble steed...</i>

915
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,463
<i>a valiant figure...</i>

916
01:03:46,506 --> 01:03:48,940
<i>straight and tall...</i>

917
01:03:48,976 --> 01:03:51,137
to wake his love...

918
01:03:51,178 --> 01:03:54,875
with love's first kiss...

919
01:03:54,915 --> 01:04:00,080
<i>and prove that true Love</i>
<i>conquers all.</i>

920
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,081
Why, you... you...

921
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,154
Come, my pet.

922
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:13,428
Let us leave our noble Prince...

923
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:15,935
with these happy thoughts.

924
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,599
A most gratifying day.

925
01:04:28,482 --> 01:04:31,508
For the first time
in sixteen years...

926
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:33,951
I shall sleep well.

927
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,064
Shh! No time to explain.

928
01:05:01,782 --> 01:05:03,511
Wait, Prince Phillip.

929
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,518
The road to true love
may be barred...

930
01:05:05,552 --> 01:05:07,679
by still many more dangers...

931
01:05:07,721 --> 01:05:10,349
<i>which you alone</i>
<i>will have to face.</i>

932
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:11,857
So arm thyself...

933
01:05:11,892 --> 01:05:15,157
with this enchanted shield
of virtue...

934
01:05:15,195 --> 01:05:18,460
<i>and this mighty sword</i>
<i>of truth.</i>

935
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,625
<i>For these weapons</i>
<i>of righteousness...</i>

936
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,567
<i>will triumph over evil.</i>

937
01:05:22,602 --> 01:05:24,593
Now, come. We must hurry.

Whinnies]

939
01:06:12,686 --> 01:06:14,017
Phillip, watch out!

940
01:07:10,744 --> 01:07:12,974
Silence!

941
01:07:13,013 --> 01:07:15,413
You, tell those fools to...

942
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,417
No! No!

943
01:07:22,522 --> 01:07:24,456
Watch out, Phillip!

944
01:07:32,432 --> 01:07:33,763
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!

945
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:47,213
A forest of thorns
shall be his tomb.

946
01:07:47,213 --> 01:07:50,979
A forest of thorns
shall be his tomb.

947
01:07:51,016 --> 01:07:54,747
Born through the skies
on a fog of doom.

948
01:07:54,787 --> 01:07:58,052
<i>Now go with the curse</i>
<i>and serve me well...</i>

949
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,081
<i>Round Stefan's castle...</i>

950
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:02,320
<i>Cast my spell!</i>

Whinnies]

953
01:08:52,678 --> 01:08:55,112
No, it cannot be!

954
01:09:01,353 --> 01:09:05,187
Now shall you deal
with me, o Prince...

955
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:10,025
and all the powers of hell!

956
01:09:37,723 --> 01:09:39,054
Whinnies]

957
01:09:53,405 --> 01:09:55,373
Up! Up this way!

958
01:10:11,757 --> 01:10:14,521
Now, Sword of Truth,
fly swift and sure...

959
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,155
that evil die and good endure!

960
01:12:00,265 --> 01:12:03,860
Oh, oh, uh, forgive me, Hubert.

961
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:05,199
The wine.

962
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:08,502
Now, uh, you were saying?

963
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,531
Huh? I was?

964
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,669
Oh, oh, yes.

965
01:12:12,711 --> 01:12:15,646
Well, after all, Stefan...

966
01:12:15,681 --> 01:12:17,546
this is the 14th century.

967
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:18,880
Yes. You, uh...

968
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,885
you said that a moment ago.

969
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:23,717
Well, to come right
to the point...

970
01:12:23,755 --> 01:12:26,952
my son Phillip says
he's going to marry...

971
01:12:52,518 --> 01:12:54,952
It's Aurora. She's here!

972
01:12:59,725 --> 01:13:01,625
And... and... and Phillip!

973
01:13:16,575 --> 01:13:19,203
What does this mean, boy?

974
01:13:19,244 --> 01:13:20,768
I... I don't...

975
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:26,913
But, but, but...

976
01:13:33,759 --> 01:13:35,590
I don't understand.

977
01:14:00,986 --> 01:14:03,318
Why, Fauna,
what's the matter, dear?

978
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:07,917
Oh, I just love happy endings.

979
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,155
Yes. I do, too.

980
01:14:11,797 --> 01:14:12,957
Blue?!

981
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:18,266
Pink!

982
01:14:18,303 --> 01:14:23,639
<i>I know you,</i>
<i>I walked with you once...</i>

983
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:24,664
Blue!

984
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,769
<i>... upon a dream</i>

985
01:14:26,812 --> 01:14:29,406
<i>I know you</i>

986
01:14:29,448 --> 01:14:31,439
<i>The gleam in your eyes</i>

987
01:14:31,483 --> 01:14:34,782
<i>Is so familiar a gleam</i>

988
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:37,983
<i>And I know it's true</i>

989
01:14:38,023 --> 01:14:42,756
<i>That visions</i>
<i>are seldom all they seem</i>

990
01:14:42,794 --> 01:14:45,319
<i>But if I know you</i>

991
01:14:45,364 --> 01:14:47,229
<i>I know what you'll do</i>

992
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:49,290
<i>You'll Love me at once</i>

993
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:51,734
<i>The way you did once</i>

994
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,238
<i>Upon</i>

995
01:14:54,272 --> 01:14:56,240
<i>A
