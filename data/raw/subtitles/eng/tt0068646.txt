1
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,138
I believe in America.

2
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,224
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:01,562
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:06,358
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,905
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:15,576
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,244
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:23,000
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,587
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:31,175
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:35,429
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,558
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:46,607
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,028
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,575
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,206
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,252
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,839
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,638
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,521
Sorry.

21
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:38,492
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,203
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,040
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,292
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:53,465
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

26
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,013
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

27
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,683
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

28
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:09,523
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,324
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,539
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,249
What is that?

32
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,179
I want them dead.

33
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,192
That I cannot do.

34
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,488
I'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:05,370
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,627
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,548
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

38
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:21,637
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,432
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

40
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,810
I didn't want to get into trouble.

41
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,771
I understand.

42
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,983
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:41,949
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,701
You didn't need a friend like me.

45
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,957
But now you come to me and say,

46
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,584
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

47
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,256
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:02,010
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:10,811
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,355
I ask you for justice.

51
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,275
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,779
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

53
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,284
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:43,802
Bonasera, Bonasera.

55
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:48,015
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,852
If you'd come in friendship,

57
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:56,231
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,613
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

59
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,285
And then they would fear you.

60
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,832
Be my friend?

61
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,837
Godfather?

62
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:24,885
Good.

63
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:32,309
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,938
But until that day

65
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,818
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,446
- GrÃ zie, Godfather.
- Prego.

67
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,122
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,878
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

69
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:04,132
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,036
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

71
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,873
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

72
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,966
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

73
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,142
Don Barzini.

74
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,037
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

75
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,414
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:06,213
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,632
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,643
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,062
You watch yourself, all right?

80
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,587
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

81
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,757
In that little silk purse.

82
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,636
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

83
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,012
Hey, Paulie!

84
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,891
I got two gabagool, capocol,
and a prosciut.

85
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,059
Stupid jerk!

86
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,112
What's the matter?

87
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,918
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

88
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,089
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,142
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,025
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

91
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,029
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

92
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,455
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

93
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,878
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:28,688
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,107
so for six months
he's worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,110
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,738
Now that the war is over,

98
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,825
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:45,705
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

100
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,835
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

101
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,923
You understand everything.

102
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,176
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

103
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:05,141
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

104
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,186
The bride, the groom and the angel...

105
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,946
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

106
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:23,201
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

107
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,751
Hey, Michael!

108
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,066
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

109
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,158
Is this necessary?

110
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:07,996
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

111
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:14,711
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me

112
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,589
on the wedding day of your daughter.

113
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,342
May their first child
be a masculine child.

114
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,719
Michael...

115
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,932
That man over there
is talking to himself.

116
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,852
See that scary guy over there?

117
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,022
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

118
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:39,152
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

119
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,907
Michael, he's coming over here!

120
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,163
You look terrific!

121
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,333
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

122
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,420
Your father's been asking for you.

123
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,256
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

124
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,844
Why does your brother
have a different name?

125
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,640
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

126
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:12,769
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

127
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,524
He's been with us ever since.

128
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,609
He's a good lawyer.

129
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:25,198
Not a Sicilian. I think
he's going to be consigliere.

130
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,201
- What's that?
- That's a,

131
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,996
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

132
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,166
You like your lasagne?

133
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,589
Don Corleone.

134
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,259
I'm honored and grateful

135
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:48,388
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

136
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,563
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

137
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:01,526
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

138
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:08,158
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

139
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,081
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

140
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:20,628
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

141
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,547
Thank you.

142
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,516
Signora Corleone!

143
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,561
No!

144
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,552
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

145
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,931
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

146
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,352
What is that outside?

147
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:54,782
Johnny! Johnny!

148
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,660
I love you!

149
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,382
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

150
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,844
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

151
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:20,224
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

152
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,576
You never said
you knew Johnny Fontane!

153
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,747
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

154
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,626
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

155
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,835
How?

156
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,299
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

157
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,668
Please, Michael. Tell me.

158
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:37,343
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

159
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,346
with a big bandleader.

160
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,726
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

161
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,438
Johnny is my father's godson.

162
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,691
My father went to see this bandleader.

163
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,695
He offered him $ 10,000
to let Johnny go,

164
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,573
but the bandleader said no.

165
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:04,037
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

166
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,082
Within an hour,

167
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:13,755
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1,000.

168
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,510
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

169
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:26,184
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

170
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:31,564
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

171
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,112
That's a true story.

172
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,293
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

173
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,557
Beautiful!

174
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,800
I'll take care of it.

175
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,760
Tom...

176
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:46,764
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

177
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:56,691
How are you, Fredo?

178
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,485
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.

179
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,780
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

180
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:09,412
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

181
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,914
Yeah. This is your friend?

182
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:16,836
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

183
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:24,886
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

184
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:30,433
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

185
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,644
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

186
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,899
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

187
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,529
Sonny?

188
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,199
Sonny?

189
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,831
Sonny?

190
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,460
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

191
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,170
The old man wants you.

192
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,465
One minute.

193
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:21,859
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seller.

194
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:25,696
The main character
is a guy just like me.

195
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,324
I wouldn't even have to act.

196
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,119
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

197
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:37,917
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

198
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,589
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?

199
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:47,593
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

200
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,512
Ridiculous.

201
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,311
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

202
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,896
Good.

203
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,859
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

204
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,743
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

205
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:18,249
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

206
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,544
It's too late,
they start shooting in a week.

207
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,797
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

208
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:32,596
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

209
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,893
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

210
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:08,049
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

211
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:11,719
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

212
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:17,224
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

213
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:20,061
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

214
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:24,732
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

215
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:29,195
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

216
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,658
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

217
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:39,997
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

218
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,127
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

219
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,922
Wait a minute.

220
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,424
No, Michael. Not me.

221
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,890
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

222
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,253
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

223
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:54,507
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

224
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,385
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr. Woltz,

225
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,347
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.

226
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,807
Woltz is listening.

227
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:08,020
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

228
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:18,697
And what favor would your friend
grant Mr. Woltz?

229
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,201
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

230
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:26,413
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

231
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:30,918
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

232
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,504
Let me lay it on the line.

233
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,631
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie!

234
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:40,177
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

235
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:44,139
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

236
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:48,644
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

237
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,231
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

238
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,734
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

239
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,653
I'll wait for your call.

240
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,449
By the way,
I admire your pictures very much.

241
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,831
Check him out.

242
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,897
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

243
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:38,402
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

244
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,030
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

245
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:45,451
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

246
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,704
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

247
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,166
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

248
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,960
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

249
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,008
There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs.

250
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,803
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

251
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,555
Khartoum.

252
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:08,432
Khartoum.

253
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:14,355
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

254
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,483
Thanks, Tony.

255
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,195
Let's get something to eat.

256
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,782
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

257
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:29,203
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

258
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,165
I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.

259
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,751
This favor I can't give him.

260
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,254
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

261
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:45,260
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

262
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:49,264
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

263
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,227
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

264
00:30:55,229 --> 00:31:00,109
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protÃ©gÃ©s.

265
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:05,447
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

266
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:10,327
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

267
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,205
Let me be even more frank.

268
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:18,252
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

269
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,922
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

270
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:27,261
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

271
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:33,600
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

272
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,269
And she runs off.

273
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:40,858
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

274
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:46,155
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

275
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,449
You get the hell out of here!

276
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:52,953
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

277
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,291
Yeah, I heard that story.

278
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:02,254
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

279
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,132
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

280
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,844
Mr. Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

281
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:05,419
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

282
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,380
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

283
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,798
Now...

284
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,137
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

285
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,930
He's supposed to be very good
with a knife,

286
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,977
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

287
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,397
His business is narcotics.

288
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,692
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

289
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:32,613
In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.

290
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:36,408
He needs cash,
he needs protection from the police.

291
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,412
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

292
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:45,500
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

293
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:51,340
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

294
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:54,092
He's known as a top narcotics man.

295
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:59,097
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

296
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,726
Tom?

297
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:07,064
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

298
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:11,860
If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

299
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:16,531
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

300
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,533
Then they come after us.

301
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:25,290
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

302
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:30,504
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

303
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:38,011
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

304
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,643
Don Corleone.

305
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,898
I need a man who has powerful friends.

306
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,693
I need a million dollars in cash.

307
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:58,782
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

308
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:04,204
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.

309
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,250
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

310
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,335
And then it would go up.

311
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,840
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

312
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,635
My compliments.

313
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:25,809
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

314
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:30,230
So I receive 30% for finance,

315
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,567
political influence and legal protection?

316
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,485
That's right.

317
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,574
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

318
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:46,038
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

319
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,373
te salud, Don Corleone.

320
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:04,014
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

321
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,433
to be treated with respect.

322
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:14,441
But, I must say no to you.

323
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,986
And I'll give you my reason.

324
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,281
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

325
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,912
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

326
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:32,584
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

327
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:37,631
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

328
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:43,053
But your business is... a little dangerous.

329
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:47,265
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

330
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,228
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

331
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:03,323
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

332
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,743
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

333
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:12,082
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

334
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,752
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

335
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:20,674
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

336
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,029
Santino.

337
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,990
Come here.

338
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,286
What's the matter with you?

339
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:53,915
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

340
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,128
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

341
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:00,922
Go on.

342
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,637
Tom, what's this nonsense?

343
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,432
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

344
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,896
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

345
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,940
And

346
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,902
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

347
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,578
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

348
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,372
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

349
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:39,252
Go to the Tattaglias.

350
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:43,757
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

351
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,427
and find out what you can.

352
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:08,156
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

353
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,827
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

354
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:16,248
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

355
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,073
Andiamo, Fredo.

356
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,702
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

357
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:57,706
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

358
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,752
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

359
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,258
Buon natale, Caro. GrÃ zie.

360
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:55,138
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

361
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,191
You know who I am?

362
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,692
I know you.

363
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,405
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

364
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:17,410
I think you and I can do business.

365
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,040
I need someone strong like you.

366
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,377
I heard you are not happy...

367
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,046
...with the Corleone family.

368
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,632
Want to join me?

369
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,802
What's in it for me?

370
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,139
$50,000 to start with.

371
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,685
Not bad!

372
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,897
Agreed?

373
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:49,085
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

374
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:54,090
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

375
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:57,218
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

376
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:03,516
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

377
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,143
Get in.

378
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,782
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

379
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,334
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

380
00:45:57,005 --> 00:46:01,050
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

381
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,054
No.

382
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:09,559
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

383
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,813
Michael.

384
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:17,567
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

385
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,110
What's the matter?

386
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,129
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

387
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,613
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

388
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:06,407
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

389
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:10,536
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

390
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,917
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

391
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:20,880
-Where have you been? I was worried
-Didn't Tom tell you I called?

392
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:24,967
No. Look, come home, kid
You should be with Mama, you hear?

393
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,060
My God.

394
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,315
Sonny!

395
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:50,535
Stay back there.

396
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,246
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

397
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,085
There's more news about your old man.

398
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,379
Word is out that he's already dead.

399
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:05,550
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

400
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:09,137
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

401
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:11,514
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

402
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,351
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

403
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:20,273
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

404
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:23,443
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

405
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,664
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

406
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,794
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

407
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,672
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

408
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:48,384
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

409
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,971
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

410
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:56,601
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.

411
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:58,311
I'll wait.

412
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,786
Your boss is dead.

413
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,126
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

414
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:27,048
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

415
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:35,389
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

416
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,267
Drink it.

417
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:46,150
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

418
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,491
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

419
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:57,578
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

420
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:03,835
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

421
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:11,092
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

422
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:17,056
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

423
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:22,395
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

424
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,401
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

425
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:36,200
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

426
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:43,791
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

427
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:50,089
It's good business, Tom.

428
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:57,096
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

429
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,893
Yeah, well...

430
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,147
Let me worry about Luca.

431
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,237
You just talk to Sonny.

432
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,156
And the other two kids.

433
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:21,662
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

434
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:26,375
Now you can go.

435
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:37,762
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

436
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:40,473
Blood is a big expense.

437
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,579
He's still alive.

438
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:07,541
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

439
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:12,380
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

440
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:01,846
Your mother is at the hospital with your
father. Looks like he'll pull through.

441
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:10,438
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

442
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:13,816
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

443
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,485
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

444
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,656
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

445
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,535
If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

446
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:28,414
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

447
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:32,501
- Hey, do me a favor...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

448
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:39,633
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

449
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:47,099
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

450
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:52,563
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

451
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:57,526
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

452
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,153
If your father dies

453
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,074
you make the deal.

454
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:08,037
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

455
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,543
What is it?

456
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:21,300
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

457
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,511
Tessio, go see what it is.

458
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:29,016
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

459
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,853
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

460
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:36,649
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

461
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,276
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

462
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:47,076
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

463
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,371
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

464
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:54,917
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

465
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:58,879
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

466
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:04,927
Hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help.

467
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,930
Try Luca again.

468
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:19,650
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

469
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,319
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

470
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,502
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

471
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:40,171
Probably late.

472
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:46,468
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:53,142
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

474
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,105
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

475
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:04,069
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

476
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:07,823
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

477
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:11,619
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

478
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,370
Watch the kids.

479
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:30,012
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

480
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,639
Yeah, all right.

481
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:36,018
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

482
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:40,439
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

483
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:44,443
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

484
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,744
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

485
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,831
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

486
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,893
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

487
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,647
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

488
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:11,905
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

489
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:18,871
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

490
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,789
He's going to make it.

491
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,083
I love you.

492
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,003
I love you!

493
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,757
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

494
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,760
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

495
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,678
Can't you say it?

496
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,681
I'll see you tonight.

497
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,685
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

498
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:46,523
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

499
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:52,488
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

500
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:56,241
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

501
00:58:56,325 --> 00:59:01,830
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

502
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:06,043
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

503
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,963
Add a little bit of wine.

504
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,805
And a little bit of sugar.
That's my trick.

505
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:22,059
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

506
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,478
You won't see him no more.

507
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,399
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

508
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:30,651
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

509
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:35,406
He'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

510
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,491
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

511
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,871
Send somebody with him anyway.

512
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:14,153
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

513
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:20,117
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

514
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,327
I'll wait in the cab.

515
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,624
I don't want you to get involved.

516
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:32,004
When will I see you again?

517
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:43,098
Go back to New Hampshire,
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

518
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:49,563
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

519
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,616
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

520
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:09,119
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

521
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,663
What happened to the guards?

522
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:17,210
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

523
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:20,505
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

524
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:29,097
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

525
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,935
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

526
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:42,819
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

527
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:47,240
No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.

528
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:49,743
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

529
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:54,164
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

530
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,586
We're going to move him
to another room.

531
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:02,756
Can you disconnect the tubes?

532
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,218
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

533
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:10,764
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

534
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,766
Help me, please.

535
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:33,388
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

536
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,475
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

537
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,728
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

538
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:44,399
If there is trouble, I'll stay here
to help you. For your father.

539
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:50,614
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

540
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,741
I'll be out in a minute.

541
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,383
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

542
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:14,387
I'm with you now.

543
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:17,349
I'm with you.

544
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,136
Get rid of these. Come here.

545
01:06:56,096 --> 01:07:00,600
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun. You'll be all right.

546
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,612
You did good.

547
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,330
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

548
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:50,001
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

549
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:53,880
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

550
01:08:54,130 --> 01:09:00,011
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

551
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:04,224
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

552
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:08,061
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

553
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:16,069
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

554
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,196
Stand him up straight.

555
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:46,307
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

556
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,685
They're licensed to carry firearms.

557
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:53,314
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

558
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,358
Let him go.

559
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:31,603
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

560
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:34,230
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

561
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:37,484
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

562
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,904
Jesus Christ.

563
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,163
Looks like a fortress around here.

564
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:57,670
Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

565
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:01,341
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

566
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,386
Mike, let me look at you.

567
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:12,685
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

568
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:18,274
The Turk wants to talk!
Imagine the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

569
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,152
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

570
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:25,990
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

571
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:29,619
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

572
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,705
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

573
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:37,043
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

574
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:40,380
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

575
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:43,842
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

576
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:47,011
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

577
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:50,056
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

578
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:52,725
This is business, not personal!

579
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:56,896
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

580
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:01,818
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

581
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:05,864
No more advice on how
to patch things up. Just help me win.

582
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:15,915
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

583
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,420
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

584
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:24,507
McCluskey has agreed
to be The Turk's bodyguard.

585
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:28,303
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

586
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:32,015
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

587
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:38,021
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

588
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:41,816
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

589
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:47,071
Do me a favor.
Take this into consideration.

590
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:52,827
All right, we'll wait.

591
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:01,127
We can't wait. We can't wait.

592
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:06,549
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

593
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:10,470
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

594
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:14,724
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

595
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:19,479
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

596
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,528
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

597
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:32,951
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

598
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,871
Let's set the meeting.

599
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:42,752
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

600
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:48,341
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

601
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:52,095
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

602
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:57,850
They'll search me
when I meet them, right?

603
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,311
So I can't have a weapon on me.

604
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:08,778
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me

605
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,952
then I'll kill them both.

606
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:32,760
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

607
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:36,431
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

608
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:42,937
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

609
01:14:43,021 --> 01:14:46,149
You're taking this very personal.

610
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:49,777
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

611
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:53,448
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

612
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:59,662
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

613
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:04,375
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

614
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:09,297
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

615
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:14,761
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

616
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:21,934
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

617
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:26,773
It's as cold as they come.

618
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:30,276
Impossible to trace,
so you don't worry about prints.

619
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:34,447
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

620
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,920
Is the trigger too tight?

621
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,383
My ears!

622
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:58,054
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

623
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,100
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

624
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:08,231
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

625
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:11,943
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

626
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:16,322
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

627
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,283
so walk out fast, but don't run.

628
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:22,745
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

629
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:26,207
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

630
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:32,839
You'll be all right. You'll take
a vacation, nobody knows where,

631
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,966
and we'll catch the hell.

632
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:39,303
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

633
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:42,515
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

634
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:48,104
These things have to happen every five,
10 years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

635
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:52,775
Been 10 years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

636
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:58,406
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

637
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:04,495
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

638
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:06,164
Your father too.

639
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:47,788
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

640
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:53,044
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

641
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,379
How much time do we have?

642
01:17:56,172 --> 01:18:01,219
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

643
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:07,016
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

644
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:13,022
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

645
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:17,944
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

646
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:21,614
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

647
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:25,660
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

648
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:29,038
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

649
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,665
I'll get it.

650
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,067
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

651
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,153
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

652
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:07,285
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

653
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:12,164
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

654
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:17,295
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

655
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:23,217
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

656
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,389
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

657
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:32,643
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

658
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:36,606
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

659
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:42,111
Then you go to take a leak. No,
better still, you ask permission to go.

660
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:46,699
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

661
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,870
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

662
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:54,290
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

663
01:19:54,415 --> 01:20:00,129
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

664
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,756
Let's move.

665
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,348
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

666
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:12,308
Yeah, a million times.

667
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:21,275
Don't forget. Two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out.

668
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:31,494
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

669
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,497
At least a year.

670
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:39,335
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

671
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,423
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

672
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:52,181
Take care.

673
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:56,602
Take care, Mike.

674
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:33,305
I'm glad you came. I hope
we can straighten everything out.

675
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:39,603
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

676
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:44,024
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

677
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:47,445
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

678
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:51,615
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

679
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:56,245
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

680
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,623
He's a good kid.

681
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:07,256
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

682
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:11,469
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

683
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:21,187
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

684
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:26,484
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

685
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:29,695
He's clean.

686
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,933
Going to Jersey?

687
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,062
Maybe.

688
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,130
Nice work, Lou.

689
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:12,756
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

690
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:14,633
I'll have it.

691
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,339
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

692
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,712
What I want...

693
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,631
What's most important to me

694
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:24,596
is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

695
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,976
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

696
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:32,646
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

697
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:35,065
I'm not that clever.

698
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,777
All I want is a truce.

699
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:49,079
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

700
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,292
When you got to go, you got to go.

701
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,090
He's clean.

702
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,593
Don't take too long.

703
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,681
I've frisked a thousand punks.

704
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,182
Okay, you take over.

705
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,368
I love you, Grandpa.

706
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:24,915
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

707
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:29,503
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

708
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:35,926
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

709
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,014
Go with your mother.

710
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,308
Take them downstairs.

711
01:32:49,398 --> 01:32:51,441
Go on, Carlo, you too.

712
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,028
Go on.

713
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:19,469
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

714
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:41,032
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

715
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:47,622
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

716
01:33:47,873 --> 01:33:51,209
They hit us, so we hit them back.

717
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:56,798
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

718
01:33:56,882 --> 01:34:01,011
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

719
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:03,180
So things are loosening up.

720
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:09,269
And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,

721
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:12,105
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

722
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:16,610
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

723
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:26,703
Where's Michael?

724
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:41,510
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

725
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:47,641
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

726
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:11,540
I want you to find out
where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

727
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:13,583
I want him now.

728
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:17,128
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

729
01:35:17,254 --> 01:35:22,133
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

730
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:28,139
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

731
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:32,185
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

732
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:37,232
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

733
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:43,154
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

734
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,574
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

735
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,496
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

736
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:55,584
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

737
01:35:56,543 --> 01:36:01,006
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

738
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:05,093
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

739
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:08,597
That's because
they've started making big money.

740
01:36:08,722 --> 01:36:12,058
Papa never talked business
at the table.

741
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:16,021
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

742
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:17,772
Don't interfere.

743
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:24,112
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

744
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,948
We don't discuss business at the table.

745
01:37:14,204 --> 01:37:16,665
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

746
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,422
Why are you so far
from the house?

747
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,592
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

748
01:37:27,676 --> 01:37:29,052
The bodyguards are here.

749
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,971
It's still dangerous...

750
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:35,266
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

751
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:37,769
Your enemies know you're here.

752
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:42,065
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

753
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:44,025
Not yet.

754
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,069
It's out of the question.

755
01:37:49,406 --> 01:37:51,032
Where are you going now?

756
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:53,576
To Corleone.

757
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,412
Take my car.

758
01:37:58,832 --> 01:37:59,874
I want to walk.

759
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:03,837
Be careful.

760
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:39,497
Where have all the men gone?

761
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,834
They're all dead from vendettas.

762
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:46,838
There are the names of the dead.

763
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:07,275
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

764
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:11,780
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

765
01:39:11,905 --> 01:39:17,202
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

766
01:39:35,053 --> 01:39:37,180
Mamma mia what a beauty.

767
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,483
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

768
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:58,451
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

769
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:23,476
Did you have a good hunt?

770
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,646
You know all the girls
around here?

771
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:28,690
We saw some real beauties.

772
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,069
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

773
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:39,075
She would tempt the devil himself.

774
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:48,835
Really put together.

775
01:40:48,918 --> 01:40:50,003
Right, Calo?

776
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:56,092
Such hair, such mouth!

777
01:40:58,011 --> 01:41:01,681
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

778
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:04,267
This one had a purple dress...

779
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,644
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

780
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,690
A type more Greek than Italian.

781
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:14,611
Do you know her?

782
01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:22,285
There's no girl like that
in this town.

783
01:41:24,913 --> 01:41:26,164
My God, I understand!

784
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:31,336
What's wrong?

785
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:34,839
Let's go.

786
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:38,384
It's his daughter.

787
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:40,053
Tell him to come here.

788
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:44,682
Call him.

789
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,163
Fabrizio, you translate.

790
01:42:11,334 --> 01:42:13,211
I apologize if I offended you.

791
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:17,507
I'm a stranger in this country.

792
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:20,718
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

793
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:29,143
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

794
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:32,772
My name is Michael Corleone.

795
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:38,987
There are people who'd pay
a lot of money for that information.

796
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:44,325
But then your daughter
would lose a father

797
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:48,246
instead of gaining a husband.

798
01:42:56,421 --> 01:42:58,715
I want to meet your daughter.

799
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:03,761
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

800
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,180
With all respect.

801
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:16,274
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

802
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:23,281
What's her name?

803
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:20,875
I'll knock you dizzy.

804
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:28,716
Save it for the library.

805
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:34,847
We've got to pick up my sister.

806
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:54,784
What's the matter?

807
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,913
What's the matter?

808
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:03,000
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

809
01:47:03,084 --> 01:47:05,962
It was my fault. I hit him.

810
01:47:06,045 --> 01:47:09,924
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

811
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:18,349
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

812
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:21,018
Sonny, please don't do anything.

813
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,897
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

814
01:47:24,981 --> 01:47:27,858
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

815
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:35,324
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

816
01:47:35,908 --> 01:47:38,411
Tell them to stop taking in action.

817
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:41,080
We lost enough money last week.

818
01:47:48,004 --> 01:47:50,089
Come here, come here!

819
01:48:46,979 --> 01:48:50,441
If you touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

820
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:47,970
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

821
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:52,266
Yes, I have.
I've tried writing and calling.

822
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:56,145
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

823
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:58,939
All we know is that he's all right.

824
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:05,154
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

825
01:53:06,322 --> 01:53:10,159
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

826
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:17,124
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

827
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:19,752
He'll get in touch with you.

828
01:53:19,918 --> 01:53:23,714
I let my cab go,
so can I call another one, please?

829
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,591
Come on. Sorry.

830
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:47,488
- Hello?
- Is' Carlo there?

831
01:53:48,197 --> 01:53:50,824
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

832
01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:54,411
Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.

833
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:01,418
Bitch!

834
01:54:03,462 --> 01:54:06,173
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

835
01:54:06,256 --> 01:54:09,426
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

836
01:54:09,551 --> 01:54:13,013
- You just told me to make you dinner!
- Vafangool!

837
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:15,432
I'll vafangool you!

838
01:54:20,229 --> 01:54:22,981
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

839
01:54:27,361 --> 01:54:31,573
That's it, break it all,
you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

840
01:54:40,833 --> 01:54:44,002
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

841
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:46,588
Maybe I will.

842
01:54:53,303 --> 01:54:56,515
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

843
01:54:56,598 --> 01:55:00,519
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

844
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:05,190
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

845
01:55:05,357 --> 01:55:10,154
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

846
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:15,075
Clean it!

847
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:19,455
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

848
01:55:19,538 --> 01:55:22,958
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

849
01:55:23,041 --> 01:55:24,668
Come on, kill me!

850
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:27,880
Get out of here!

851
01:55:27,963 --> 01:55:31,341
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

852
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:34,261
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

853
01:55:44,605 --> 01:55:47,566
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

854
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:51,779
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

855
01:55:51,862 --> 01:55:54,782
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

856
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:57,826
Yeah, Connie.

857
01:56:02,456 --> 01:56:04,416
You wait there.

858
01:56:07,211 --> 01:56:09,630
No, you just wait there.

859
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,134
Son-of-a-bitch.

860
01:56:14,259 --> 01:56:17,471
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

861
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:24,520
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

862
01:56:32,528 --> 01:56:33,862
Sonny!

863
01:56:40,452 --> 01:56:42,454
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

864
01:56:43,539 --> 01:56:45,374
Go after him, go on!

865
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:17,155
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

866
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:07,724
Give me a drop.

867
01:59:16,066 --> 01:59:18,402
My wife is crying upstairs.

868
01:59:20,612 --> 01:59:23,281
I hear cars coming to the house.

869
01:59:27,828 --> 01:59:30,706
Consigliere of mine,

870
01:59:30,831 --> 01:59:34,292
tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

871
01:59:34,543 --> 01:59:36,795
I didn't tell Mama anything.

872
01:59:37,713 --> 01:59:41,049
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

873
01:59:44,678 --> 01:59:46,680
But you needed a drink first.

874
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:50,434
Yeah.

875
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:56,148
Well, now you've had your drink.

876
02:00:01,611 --> 02:00:05,699
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

877
02:00:22,758 --> 02:00:25,177
I want no inquiries made.

878
02:00:29,765 --> 02:00:32,184
I want no acts of vengeance.

879
02:00:33,852 --> 02:00:36,646
I want you to arrange a meeting

880
02:00:37,647 --> 02:00:40,442
with the heads of the five families.

881
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:44,446
This war stops now.

882
02:01:06,343 --> 02:01:08,762
Call Bonasera.

883
02:01:08,887 --> 02:01:11,098
I need him now.

884
02:01:23,568 --> 02:01:28,532
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling
for Vito Corleone, at his request.

885
02:01:28,657 --> 02:01:31,159
You owe your Don a service.

886
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:34,746
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

887
02:01:34,871 --> 02:01:39,209
He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour. Be there to greet him.

888
02:02:00,438 --> 02:02:05,193
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

889
02:02:05,318 --> 02:02:08,405
Yes. What do you want me to do?

890
02:02:16,830 --> 02:02:21,209
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

891
02:02:25,422 --> 02:02:28,341
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

892
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:47,485
Look how they massacred my boy.

893
02:03:16,598 --> 02:03:19,893
It's safer to teach you English!

894
02:03:20,602 --> 02:03:21,853
I know English...

895
02:03:21,978 --> 02:03:26,942
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

896
02:03:33,907 --> 02:03:35,909
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

897
02:03:36,534 --> 02:03:38,536
How are things in Palermo?

898
02:03:44,626 --> 02:03:48,672
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

899
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:53,134
How are things in Palermo?

900
02:03:53,677 --> 02:03:56,846
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

901
02:03:57,889 --> 02:04:01,101
times are changing for the worse.

902
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:06,940
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

903
02:04:09,567 --> 02:04:14,864
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

904
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:21,997
What's wrong?

905
02:04:22,914 --> 02:04:25,166
Bad news from America.

906
02:04:27,752 --> 02:04:31,464
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

907
02:04:37,929 --> 02:04:39,973
Let's go... you promised.

908
02:04:58,825 --> 02:04:59,909
Fabrizio!

909
02:05:00,201 --> 02:05:01,494
Get the car.

910
02:05:02,454 --> 02:05:06,374
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

911
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:10,045
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

912
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:12,339
Okay, anything you say.

913
02:05:18,303 --> 02:05:19,929
Calo, where is Apollonia?

914
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:24,309
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

915
02:05:26,603 --> 02:05:28,730
She'll make a good American wife.

916
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:32,817
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

917
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:44,954
Fabrizio!

918
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:47,040
Where are you going?

919
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,585
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

920
02:05:56,966 --> 02:05:58,593
No, Apollonia!

921
02:06:21,574 --> 02:06:27,163
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

922
02:06:27,497 --> 02:06:32,252
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

923
02:06:34,003 --> 02:06:37,173
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

924
02:06:37,257 --> 02:06:40,635
and from Brooklyn

925
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:44,305
Philip Tattaglia.

926
02:06:46,015 --> 02:06:48,935
And from Staten Island

927
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:52,397
we have with us Victor Strachi.

928
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:58,278
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

929
02:06:58,361 --> 02:07:02,240
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

930
02:07:08,872 --> 02:07:12,208
How did things ever get so far?

931
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:14,085
I don't know.

932
02:07:16,129 --> 02:07:19,507
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

933
02:07:22,677 --> 02:07:26,014
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

934
02:07:28,516 --> 02:07:31,895
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

935
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:36,065
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

936
02:07:37,484 --> 02:07:41,029
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

937
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:46,659
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

938
02:07:46,743 --> 02:07:50,872
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

939
02:07:50,955 --> 02:07:55,001
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

940
02:07:55,084 --> 02:07:57,962
He refused to share them.

941
02:07:58,046 --> 02:08:02,008
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

942
02:08:02,133 --> 02:08:04,302
All of you know me.

943
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:10,475
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

944
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:18,107
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

945
02:08:18,191 --> 02:08:22,278
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

946
02:08:22,362 --> 02:08:28,368
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

947
02:08:28,493 --> 02:08:33,081
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

948
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:37,502
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

949
02:08:37,585 --> 02:08:42,715
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

950
02:08:42,799 --> 02:08:45,134
Times have changed.

951
02:08:45,218 --> 02:08:49,931
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

952
02:08:50,014 --> 02:08:52,892
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

953
02:08:52,976 --> 02:08:58,273
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

954
02:08:58,356 --> 02:09:03,111
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

955
02:09:04,153 --> 02:09:07,699
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

956
02:09:07,782 --> 02:09:10,618
After all, we're not communists.

957
02:09:13,371 --> 02:09:16,583
I also don't believe in drugs.

958
02:09:16,708 --> 02:09:21,254
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

959
02:09:21,588 --> 02:09:24,757
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

960
02:09:24,841 --> 02:09:28,303
"If you put up
3-4,000 dollar investment,

961
02:09:28,386 --> 02:09:30,972
we can make 50,000 distributing."

962
02:09:32,223 --> 02:09:37,979
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

963
02:09:38,354 --> 02:09:43,109
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

964
02:09:43,192 --> 02:09:45,194
That's an infÃ mia.

965
02:09:46,362 --> 02:09:50,241
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

966
02:09:50,366 --> 02:09:53,369
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

967
02:10:00,251 --> 02:10:03,713
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

968
02:10:05,256 --> 02:10:11,763
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

969
02:10:12,347 --> 02:10:16,768
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

970
02:10:16,851 --> 02:10:21,314
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

971
02:10:21,397 --> 02:10:25,109
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

972
02:10:25,193 --> 02:10:28,571
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger,

973
02:10:28,655 --> 02:10:31,199
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

974
02:10:31,324 --> 02:10:36,537
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

975
02:10:36,621 --> 02:10:39,082
You talk about vengeance.

976
02:10:39,582 --> 02:10:42,460
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

977
02:10:43,002 --> 02:10:45,380
Or my boy to me?

978
02:10:45,463 --> 02:10:48,216
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

979
02:10:51,219 --> 02:10:53,388
But I have selfish reasons.

980
02:10:55,682 --> 02:10:59,185
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

981
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:03,690
because of this Sollozzo business.

982
02:11:05,191 --> 02:11:09,028
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

983
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,906
Cleared of all these false charges.

984
02:11:13,241 --> 02:11:16,494
But I'm a superstitious man.

985
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:21,916
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

986
02:11:23,209 --> 02:11:26,921
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

987
02:11:27,046 --> 02:11:29,841
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

988
02:11:31,217 --> 02:11:34,679
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

989
02:11:36,264 --> 02:11:38,683
And that I do not forgive.

990
02:11:41,269 --> 02:11:43,479
But, that aside,

991
02:11:46,607 --> 02:11:49,068
let me say that I swear

992
02:11:50,528 --> 02:11:53,698
on the souls of my grandchildren,

993
02:11:53,865 --> 02:11:58,286
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

994
02:12:23,686 --> 02:12:29,275
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

995
02:12:29,358 --> 02:12:31,486
Mention it. Don't insist.

996
02:12:33,488 --> 02:12:38,367
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

997
02:12:39,911 --> 02:12:41,871
Tattaglia's a pimp.

998
02:12:42,955 --> 02:12:46,125
He could never have outfought Santino.

999
02:12:48,336 --> 02:12:54,091
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1000
02:13:09,398 --> 02:13:11,526
Come on, Nancy.

1001
02:13:12,777 --> 02:13:15,530
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1002
02:13:16,697 --> 02:13:18,533
Okay, all right.

1003
02:13:31,337 --> 02:13:33,381
How long have you been back?

1004
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:36,384
I've been back a year.

1005
02:13:37,635 --> 02:13:39,804
Longer than that, I think.

1006
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:44,809
It's good to see you, Kay.

1007
02:13:55,820 --> 02:13:58,489
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1008
02:14:00,867 --> 02:14:03,870
He's been sick. Very sick.

1009
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:07,498
But you're not like him.

1010
02:14:07,582 --> 02:14:11,586
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1011
02:14:13,296 --> 02:14:17,425
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1012
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:21,178
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1013
02:14:22,388 --> 02:14:24,682
Like a senator or president.

1014
02:14:24,807 --> 02:14:27,393
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1015
02:14:27,476 --> 02:14:30,229
They don't have men killed.

1016
02:14:33,357 --> 02:14:35,359
Who's being naive, Kay?

1017
02:14:36,611 --> 02:14:40,907
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1018
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:46,662
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1019
02:14:48,623 --> 02:14:52,585
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1020
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:57,256
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1021
02:14:58,424 --> 02:15:03,471
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1022
02:15:03,554 --> 02:15:06,933
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1023
02:15:07,058 --> 02:15:10,853
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1024
02:15:12,438 --> 02:15:15,232
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1025
02:15:16,859 --> 02:15:20,738
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1026
02:15:22,531 --> 02:15:26,869
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1027
02:15:28,537 --> 02:15:31,624
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1028
02:15:33,334 --> 02:15:35,962
That we have children. Our children.

1029
02:15:37,588 --> 02:15:39,548
Kay, I need you.

1030
02:15:41,509 --> 02:15:43,260
And I love you.

1031
02:16:05,366 --> 02:16:09,161
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1032
02:16:09,286 --> 02:16:12,832
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1033
02:16:12,915 --> 02:16:16,085
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1034
02:16:16,168 --> 02:16:19,338
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1035
02:16:19,463 --> 02:16:22,758
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1036
02:16:22,883 --> 02:16:26,721
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1037
02:16:28,347 --> 02:16:30,433
Don Corleone...

1038
02:16:30,516 --> 02:16:34,562
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1039
02:16:34,687 --> 02:16:38,733
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1040
02:16:39,734 --> 02:16:42,445
Michael is now head of the family.

1041
02:16:42,528 --> 02:16:46,699
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1042
02:16:46,782 --> 02:16:49,410
After we make the move to Nevada

1043
02:16:49,535 --> 02:16:53,748
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1044
02:16:53,873 --> 02:16:58,127
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1045
02:16:58,377 --> 02:17:01,464
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1046
02:17:01,547 --> 02:17:04,592
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1047
02:17:04,717 --> 02:17:10,306
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1048
02:17:10,389 --> 02:17:13,309
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1049
02:17:13,392 --> 02:17:16,312
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1050
02:17:16,437 --> 02:17:19,774
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1051
02:17:24,612 --> 02:17:29,825
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1052
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:32,328
That's all I can tell you now.

1053
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:35,623
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1054
02:17:35,748 --> 02:17:38,959
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1055
02:17:39,251 --> 02:17:44,006
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1056
02:17:44,131 --> 02:17:46,675
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1057
02:17:46,801 --> 02:17:51,555
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1058
02:18:11,492 --> 02:18:15,121
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1059
02:18:15,204 --> 02:18:18,290
Mike... Why am I out?

1060
02:18:19,667 --> 02:18:22,628
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1061
02:18:23,754 --> 02:18:26,465
Things may get rough with the move.

1062
02:18:27,174 --> 02:18:28,509
Tom.

1063
02:18:33,722 --> 02:18:38,686
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1064
02:18:38,811 --> 02:18:42,982
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1065
02:18:44,525 --> 02:18:47,820
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1066
02:18:48,737 --> 02:18:53,742
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1067
02:18:54,827 --> 02:18:57,997
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1068
02:19:46,921 --> 02:19:51,342
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1069
02:19:51,467 --> 02:19:55,888
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1070
02:19:55,971 --> 02:20:00,142
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1071
02:20:00,267 --> 02:20:02,686
Let me open the door, all right?

1072
02:20:08,901 --> 02:20:14,198
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1073
02:20:14,323 --> 02:20:16,784
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1074
02:20:20,746 --> 02:20:23,791
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1075
02:20:25,125 --> 02:20:28,754
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1076
02:20:30,005 --> 02:20:33,509
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1077
02:20:34,927 --> 02:20:39,765
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1078
02:20:39,848 --> 02:20:42,434
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1079
02:20:48,232 --> 02:20:51,318
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1080
02:20:51,777 --> 02:20:53,862
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1081
02:20:55,572 --> 02:20:57,658
Hey, come on! Scram!

1082
02:20:59,326 --> 02:21:02,788
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1083
02:21:02,913 --> 02:21:04,290
Sorry.

1084
02:21:06,166 --> 02:21:08,836
I don't know. He's tired.

1085
02:21:15,843 --> 02:21:18,762
What happened to Moe Greene?

1086
02:21:18,846 --> 02:21:23,267
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1087
02:21:23,392 --> 02:21:25,269
Well, give him a call.

1088
02:21:26,687 --> 02:21:29,898
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1089
02:21:30,024 --> 02:21:32,026
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1090
02:21:32,151 --> 02:21:35,904
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1091
02:21:36,030 --> 02:21:38,032
Well, I owe it all to him.

1092
02:21:39,241 --> 02:21:40,909
He knows how grateful you are.

1093
02:21:40,993 --> 02:21:44,204
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1094
02:21:44,288 --> 02:21:46,206
Mike, what can I do?

1095
02:21:47,416 --> 02:21:49,960
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1096
02:21:50,044 --> 02:21:53,130
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1097
02:21:53,714 --> 02:21:58,969
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1098
02:21:59,053 --> 02:22:01,722
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1099
02:22:01,847 --> 02:22:04,850
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1100
02:22:04,975 --> 02:22:07,853
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1101
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:11,482
See, Johnny...

1102
02:22:11,607 --> 02:22:15,736
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1103
02:22:15,861 --> 02:22:19,573
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1104
02:22:22,534 --> 02:22:27,081
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1105
02:22:28,415 --> 02:22:30,542
We're counting on you.

1106
02:22:32,544 --> 02:22:36,131
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1107
02:22:36,256 --> 02:22:37,633
Good.

1108
02:22:39,259 --> 02:22:43,931
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1109
02:22:44,056 --> 02:22:46,517
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1110
02:22:46,642 --> 02:22:51,730
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1111
02:22:51,855 --> 02:22:55,317
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1112
02:22:57,903 --> 02:23:00,781
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1113
02:23:02,449 --> 02:23:03,742
Buy me out?

1114
02:23:04,451 --> 02:23:06,912
The casino, the hotel.

1115
02:23:07,037 --> 02:23:09,331
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1116
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:15,546
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1117
02:23:15,671 --> 02:23:18,924
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1118
02:23:19,049 --> 02:23:23,137
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1119
02:23:27,808 --> 02:23:30,185
You Guineas make me laugh.

1120
02:23:30,310 --> 02:23:35,023
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1121
02:23:36,191 --> 02:23:39,820
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1122
02:23:39,945 --> 02:23:44,992
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1123
02:23:45,117 --> 02:23:48,036
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

1124
02:23:48,162 --> 02:23:50,497
You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1125
02:23:50,581 --> 02:23:54,918
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1126
02:23:55,002 --> 02:23:59,047
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1127
02:23:59,173 --> 02:24:03,969
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1128
02:24:04,094 --> 02:24:07,723
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1129
02:24:07,806 --> 02:24:12,478
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1130
02:24:12,561 --> 02:24:16,982
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1131
02:24:17,065 --> 02:24:21,778
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1132
02:24:21,862 --> 02:24:25,741
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1133
02:24:25,824 --> 02:24:28,619
You straightened my brother out?

1134
02:24:28,744 --> 02:24:33,040
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1135
02:24:33,165 --> 02:24:35,042
What's wrong with you?

1136
02:24:40,005 --> 02:24:43,133
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1137
02:24:43,759 --> 02:24:45,427
Son-of-a-bitch!

1138
02:24:45,886 --> 02:24:51,099
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1139
02:24:51,225 --> 02:24:53,602
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1140
02:24:54,686 --> 02:24:58,232
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1141
02:24:58,357 --> 02:25:03,820
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1142
02:25:03,904 --> 02:25:07,074
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1143
02:25:10,911 --> 02:25:15,707
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1144
02:25:17,668 --> 02:25:18,919
Fredo...

1145
02:25:20,212 --> 02:25:22,881
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1146
02:25:24,216 --> 02:25:28,220
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1147
02:25:29,846 --> 02:25:30,847
Ever.

1148
02:25:38,939 --> 02:25:43,110
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1149
02:25:44,945 --> 02:25:49,741
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1150
02:25:57,207 --> 02:26:00,002
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1151
02:26:00,127 --> 02:26:02,254
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1152
02:26:02,379 --> 02:26:05,340
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1153
02:26:05,424 --> 02:26:07,217
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1154
02:26:07,342 --> 02:26:09,678
Let me think about it. Come on.

1155
02:26:18,562 --> 02:26:21,481
Barzini will move against you first.

1156
02:26:21,565 --> 02:26:26,111
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1157
02:26:26,194 --> 02:26:28,280
Guaranteeing your safety.

1158
02:26:29,323 --> 02:26:32,367
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1159
02:26:37,122 --> 02:26:40,125
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1160
02:26:41,585 --> 02:26:45,213
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1161
02:26:50,344 --> 02:26:51,720
I don't know.

1162
02:26:53,764 --> 02:26:56,600
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1163
02:26:57,601 --> 02:27:00,395
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1164
02:27:02,189 --> 02:27:07,110
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1165
02:27:07,194 --> 02:27:10,155
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1166
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:14,701
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1167
02:27:16,161 --> 02:27:19,748
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1168
02:27:23,126 --> 02:27:25,337
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1169
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:28,340
He looks more like you every day.

1170
02:27:31,009 --> 02:27:35,305
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1171
02:27:37,432 --> 02:27:39,518
Read the funny papers.

1172
02:27:46,817 --> 02:27:52,406
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

1173
02:27:52,531 --> 02:27:56,118
I did it already.
I took care of that, Pop.

1174
02:27:56,201 --> 02:27:57,869
That's right. I forgot.

1175
02:28:01,873 --> 02:28:03,583
What's the matter?

1176
02:28:04,459 --> 02:28:06,545
What's bothering you?

1177
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:14,594
I'll handle it. I told you
I can handle it, so I'll handle it.

1178
02:28:28,024 --> 02:28:32,404
I knew that Santino
would have to go through all this.

1179
02:28:32,487 --> 02:28:34,281
And Fredo...

1180
02:28:36,908 --> 02:28:38,910
Fredo was, well...

1181
02:28:40,829 --> 02:28:43,623
But I never wanted this for you.

1182
02:28:46,001 --> 02:28:51,089
I worked my whole life. I don't apologize
for taking care of my family.

1183
02:28:51,214 --> 02:28:55,093
And I refused to be a fool,

1184
02:28:55,218 --> 02:28:59,347
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1185
02:29:01,308 --> 02:29:04,603
I don't apologize. That's my life,
but I thought that,

1186
02:29:06,438 --> 02:29:11,443
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1187
02:29:13,361 --> 02:29:19,034
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1188
02:29:19,117 --> 02:29:22,120
Another pezzonovante.

1189
02:29:22,245 --> 02:29:23,747
Well...

1190
02:29:27,042 --> 02:29:30,962
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1191
02:29:31,087 --> 02:29:34,466
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1192
02:29:39,513 --> 02:29:43,850
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1193
02:29:43,934 --> 02:29:46,853
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1194
02:30:03,787 --> 02:30:05,956
Can I hold it, please?

1195
02:30:21,096 --> 02:30:24,975
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1196
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:27,769
Over here, over here.

1197
02:30:29,604 --> 02:30:32,232
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1198
02:30:38,488 --> 02:30:40,407
Anthony!

1199
02:30:40,532 --> 02:30:42,158
Come here, come here.

1200
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:49,916
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1201
02:30:55,213 --> 02:30:57,632
I'll show you something. Come here.

1202
02:30:59,759 --> 02:31:01,595
Stand there.

1203
02:31:05,473 --> 02:31:07,225
Give me an orange!

1204
02:31:25,410 --> 02:31:27,370
That's a new trick.

1205
02:31:28,413 --> 02:31:30,582
You run in there. Run in there.

1206
02:31:44,262 --> 02:31:46,181
Where are you?

1207
02:34:43,733 --> 02:34:46,194
Mike, can I have a minute?

1208
02:34:56,329 --> 02:34:58,623
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1209
02:34:58,748 --> 02:35:02,127
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1210
02:35:02,710 --> 02:35:04,963
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1211
02:35:06,381 --> 02:35:10,135
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1212
02:35:13,221 --> 02:35:15,849
- All right?
- All right.

1213
02:35:33,241 --> 02:35:36,244
Do you know
how they're going to come at you?

1214
02:35:38,872 --> 02:35:42,458
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1215
02:35:44,669 --> 02:35:46,546
Where I'll be safe.

1216
02:35:58,683 --> 02:36:02,187
I always thought it would be Clemenza,
not Tessio.

1217
02:36:02,270 --> 02:36:06,065
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1218
02:36:08,318 --> 02:36:09,694
But I'm going to wait.

1219
02:36:10,862 --> 02:36:11,946
After the baptism.

1220
02:36:15,074 --> 02:36:17,911
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1221
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:23,249
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.

1222
02:36:24,584 --> 02:36:27,128
All the heads of the five families.

1223
02:38:48,561 --> 02:38:53,608
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1224
02:38:53,691 --> 02:38:54,859
I do.

1225
02:38:54,984 --> 02:38:58,237
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1226
02:38:58,363 --> 02:38:59,447
I do.

1227
02:38:59,572 --> 02:39:03,659
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

1228
02:39:03,785 --> 02:39:05,078
I do.

1229
02:40:10,518 --> 02:40:14,939
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1230
02:40:21,028 --> 02:40:22,321
I do renounce him.

1231
02:40:32,165 --> 02:40:33,458
And all his works?

1232
02:40:47,305 --> 02:40:48,347
I do renounce them.

1233
02:40:50,057 --> 02:40:51,350
God!

1234
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:58,107
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1235
02:41:13,789 --> 02:41:18,044
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?

1236
02:41:18,169 --> 02:41:19,212
I will.

1237
02:41:26,344 --> 02:41:31,974
Michael Rizzi, go in peace,
and may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1238
02:41:46,239 --> 02:41:48,074
Kay!

1239
02:41:48,199 --> 02:41:50,159
Kiss your godfather.

1240
02:42:14,433 --> 02:42:18,563
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1241
02:42:18,646 --> 02:42:20,231
Everybody has to leave without us.

1242
02:42:20,356 --> 02:42:23,359
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1243
02:42:23,442 --> 02:42:27,071
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1244
02:42:28,197 --> 02:42:30,408
I'll only be a couple of days.

1245
02:42:46,799 --> 02:42:49,051
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1246
02:42:51,262 --> 02:42:54,932
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1247
02:43:02,690 --> 02:43:08,154
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1248
02:43:08,237 --> 02:43:11,741
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1249
02:43:11,866 --> 02:43:14,076
I can't go either, Sal.

1250
02:43:26,047 --> 02:43:29,884
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1251
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:34,263
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1252
02:43:40,269 --> 02:43:42,897
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1253
02:43:44,106 --> 02:43:47,318
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1254
02:44:32,571 --> 02:44:35,116
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1255
02:44:40,246 --> 02:44:44,333
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1256
02:44:45,209 --> 02:44:49,296
That little farce
you played with my sister.

1257
02:44:49,380 --> 02:44:54,260
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1258
02:44:54,343 --> 02:44:57,263
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1259
02:44:59,849 --> 02:45:02,184
Don't do this to me, please.

1260
02:45:11,277 --> 02:45:13,154
Barzini is dead.

1261
02:45:15,322 --> 02:45:17,491
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1262
02:45:18,784 --> 02:45:20,369
Moe Greene.

1263
02:45:21,328 --> 02:45:25,082
Strachi. Cuneo.

1264
02:45:27,001 --> 02:45:32,131
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1265
02:45:32,256 --> 02:45:34,175
Admit what you did.

1266
02:45:38,137 --> 02:45:39,722
Get him a drink.

1267
02:45:46,103 --> 02:45:47,480
Come on.

1268
02:45:48,564 --> 02:45:51,150
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1269
02:45:51,275 --> 02:45:54,111
Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

1270
02:45:55,196 --> 02:45:57,907
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1271
02:46:04,747 --> 02:46:06,791
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1272
02:46:11,545 --> 02:46:15,341
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1273
02:46:16,467 --> 02:46:20,387
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1274
02:46:20,513 --> 02:46:22,306
Tom.

1275
02:46:26,435 --> 02:46:29,939
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1276
02:46:30,022 --> 02:46:32,566
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1277
02:46:33,818 --> 02:46:38,197
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1278
02:46:42,451 --> 02:46:44,328
Who approached you?

1279
02:46:45,621 --> 02:46:47,957
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1280
02:46:55,798 --> 02:46:57,424
It was Barzini.

1281
02:47:01,595 --> 02:47:03,347
Good.

1282
02:47:09,353 --> 02:47:13,440
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1283
02:47:13,566 --> 02:47:17,194
I'll call your wife
and tell her what flight you're on.

1284
02:47:21,490 --> 02:47:23,993
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1285
02:47:50,102 --> 02:47:51,687
Hello, Carlo.

1286
02:48:51,538 --> 02:48:54,667
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1287
02:49:03,175 --> 02:49:05,260
Michael!

1288
02:49:05,344 --> 02:49:07,388
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1289
02:49:09,682 --> 02:49:14,853
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1290
02:49:14,937 --> 02:49:19,066
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1291
02:49:19,149 --> 02:49:22,194
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1292
02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:28,075
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1293
02:49:28,158 --> 02:49:29,702
Connie.

1294
02:49:31,996 --> 02:49:34,665
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the Mall?

1295
02:49:34,748 --> 02:49:37,584
He knew he was going to kill him.

1296
02:49:37,710 --> 02:49:43,090
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1297
02:49:43,215 --> 02:49:47,302
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1298
02:49:47,386 --> 02:49:50,139
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1299
02:49:59,732 --> 02:50:03,944
No! No, no...

1300
02:50:04,028 --> 02:50:07,531
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1301
02:50:28,552 --> 02:50:30,262
She's hysterical.

1302
02:50:34,808 --> 02:50:36,685
Hysterical.

1303
02:50:38,395 --> 02:50:39,813
Michael, is it true?

1304
02:50:42,316 --> 02:50:45,903
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1305
02:50:46,028 --> 02:50:48,697
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1306
02:51:08,842 --> 02:51:10,469
All right.

1307
02:51:13,222 --> 02:51:14,890
This one time.

1308
02:51:18,811 --> 02:51:21,605
This one time
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

1309
02:51:28,237 --> 02:51:29,571
Is it true?

1310
02:51:33,742 --> 02:51:35,410
Is it?

1311
02:51:37,121 --> 02:51:38,580
No.

1312
02:51:52,511 --> 02:51:55,389
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1313
02:52:26,753 --> 02:52:28,380
Don Corleone.
