(music) I'd like to be you
for a day (music)

00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,249
(music) I'd like to climb
into the dreams you hide (music)

7
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:53,664
(music) To know the grown-up
and the child inside (music)

8
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:58,082
(music) Whatever makes you smile (music)

9
00:00:58,156 --> 00:00:59,530
(music) I'd like to see it (music)

10
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:03,239

(music) I'd like to be you

(music) I'd like to be you

13
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:24,964
(music) Are you excited
by electric trains? (music)

14
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:28,167
(music) And kind of lonely
every time it rains? (music)

15
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:32,644
(music) To stare out
through your eyes (music)

16
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:38,312
(music) Would start revealing
all the things you're feeling (music)

17
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:52,967
(music) What's on your mind
when you hear a tune (music)

18
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:57,378
(music) Or ride a toy balloon? (music)

19
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,418
(music) Just let me look,
let me read your book (music)

20
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:03,208
(music) And learn it (music)

21
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:08,491
(music) Loving every page

22
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,186

(music) I'd like to be you
for a day (music)

24
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:32,103
(music) There's so much more
I need to understand (music)

25
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:35,466
(music) It's not enough
to simply hold your hand (music)

26
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:39,787
(music) And hear
the words you say (music)

27
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:41,378
(music) I want to touch you (music)

28
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,459
(music) I want to reach you (music)

(music) I'd like to be you
for a day (music)

31
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,321
(music) To put you back
on the track (music)

32
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:56,518
(music) When you go astray (music)

33
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,595
(music) I'd like to be you
for a day (music)

34
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:00,162
(music) To know your aims (music)

35
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:04,196
(music) And to share the games
that you play (music)

36
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,196
(music) I'd like to be you
for a day (music)

37
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:16,779
(music) I'd like to be you
for a day (music)

38
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,957
(music) I'd like to be you
for a day (music)

39
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,593
ANNABEL:
You're not gonna believe me.

40
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,179
Nobody in their right minds
could believe me.

41
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:23,877
But it's true.
Really, it is.

42
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:27,143
At exactly 8: 15 this morning...
No, wait.

43
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,837
Let me start back further.

44
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:31,395
My name is Annabel Andrews.

45
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,093
This is my room.

46
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,545
I like it this way.

47
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,961
You don't have to look
for anything.

48
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:38,921
[Alarm buzzing]

49
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:40,231
MAN:
Good morning.

50
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:41,728
It's Friday the 13th.
Ready?

51
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,396
ANNABEL:
No way.

52
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,074
And this is me.

53
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:49,449
Born in Mountview Hospital
13 years ago.

54
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:50,693
Give or take a month.

55
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,935
Female, blond.
Natural, of course.

56
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:55,654
Blue eyes.
Height about 5'2".

57
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:57,731
I don't remember what I weigh,
but I'm watching it.

58
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:59,494
Which my mother says
is ridiculous

59
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:03,273
because I'm not mature
in my figure yet.

60
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:04,485
Mmm...

61
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,465
Maybe by summer, though.

62
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:11,299
[Sighs]

63
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:12,353
Gross.

64
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,399
I have one little brother.
Look at him.

65
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,573
Gorgeous hair,
gorgeous teeth,

66
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:20,491
gorgeous eyes,
gorgeous eyelashes.

67
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:22,213
He's what you call neat.

68
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,934
Not neat terrific.
Neat neat.

69
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:27,491
He is so neat it's revolting.

70
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:29,385
He only does it to show me up.

71
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:31,012
A goody-goody, you know?

72
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:33,058
A perfect person and a creep.

73
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,854
His name is Ben,
but I call him...

74
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:37,411
Ape Face!
Will you get out of here?

75
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:39,817
Don't come busting in
without knocking.

76
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:41,410
It's time for breakfast.

77
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:44,266
So? Come on, beat it.
Get out of here.

78
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:45,280
I am.

79
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,948
You'll be late for school.

80
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,393
So what do I care?

81
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,307
Actually, I care.
I mean, school is okay.

82
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,713
I got friends, sports.

83
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:56,074
Yesterday I was made captain
for today's playoff game.

84
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,732
Kind of neat, huh?

85
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:04,736
I'm also pretty good on water.

86
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:08,074
We got a super water-ski club.

87
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,652
And we're gonna put on
a real aquacade for my dad.

88
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:13,828
Oh, yeah, about my parents.

89
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,616
William Waring Andrews.
45.

90
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,782
6 feet tall.
Well, 5' 11. 5".

91
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,990
The hair's too short,
but I've seen worse.

92
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:24,394
All in all,
a fantastically cool person.

93
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,401
(music) My, oh, my
what a wonderful... (music)

94
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:29,158
He's with Joffert and Jennings.
Public relations.

95
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:32,642
And the most beautiful person
in the world.

96
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,209
Almost.

97
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:40,069
That's Boris Harris.
What a fox!

98
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,179
I mean, he's really
something else.

99
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:43,909
Mm-hmm.

100
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,216
Unfortunately,
ever since a little incident

101
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:49,130
that happened a while ago,
Boris leaves me alone.

102
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:50,177
ELLEN:
Annabel!

103
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:51,364
Time!

104
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,217
Which is more than I can say
for her.

105
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:56,901
Mom and I haven't been
hitting it off well.

106
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,946
It's not that
I don't love her. I do.

107
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:00,448
Why shouldn't I?

108
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:02,913
Everybody knows mothers
are sweet and kind

109
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,126
and lovely and gentle and...

110
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:06,569
Annabel!

111
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:07,529
And loud.

112
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:08,489
- [Yelps]
- Ahh!

113
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:11,622
Max, you big hamburger.

114
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:14,179
Annabel, where are you going?

115
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,697
I thought we had this
all out last night.

116
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:18,719
Who? Me?

117
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,486
I'm not very hungry.

118
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:24,003
I don't go for that
eggs and bacon stuff.

119
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,602
I want you to be healthy.

120
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,050
That's all, Annabel.

121
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:29,286
I'm gonna grow up
and be a blimp.

122
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,697
I'm already late.

123
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:32,170
What about your room?

124
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:33,609
Perfect.

125
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:36,642
And your bed?
That's made, right?

126
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:40,327
I forgot, Mom.
It just slipped through my mind.

127
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:42,500
I got a lot of things
to think about.

128
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:43,945
Mmm.

129
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:46,183
Annabel,
I don't want to be preachy.

130
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,994
But childhood is the best time
in a person's life.

131
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,466
Sure. I'm all for it.

132
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,051
But I got a lot of worries.

133
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,716
Name one.
Just one.

134
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:57,382
All right.

135
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,873
Worry number one.

136
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:01,376
I'm late to meet Virginia.

137
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:02,345
Wish me luck.

138
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:03,942
Bye-bye.

139
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:06,978
Bye. Good luck.

140
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,702
Good luck to me, too.

141
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,298
Annabel.
Wait a minute.

142
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:12,319
Annabel!

143
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,739
Don't forget the orthodontist!

144
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,437
Don't forget the aquacade!

145
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:20,416
How much you
want to bet she does?

146
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:23,622
- Forget the aquacade?
- Forgets the orthodontist.

147
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,098
It'll serve her right.

148
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:28,097
Today Dr. Basinger's
gonna take her braces off.

149
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:31,302
It was gonna be a surprise.
You think I should've told her?

150
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,030
About the aquacade?

151
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,298
Oh, Bill, honestly.

152
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,931
What do you think of this?

153
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:37,962
What?

154
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:43,046
"Friends, respected clients,
and future developers,

155
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:45,766
we are, indeed, honored
that you could be present

156
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:47,176
for this formal announcement

157
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:51,399
of our luxurious,
new Oceana Marina."

158
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:54,151
It's good.
I don't think the name is good.

159
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:56,837
It should be
the Isle of Whispering Winds.

160
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:58,729
- It's interesting.
- Helen, please.

161
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,835
No more help.

162
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:03,874
You just show up
looking beautiful, as usual.

163
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:06,249
I'll take care of the rest.

164
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:08,420
Certainly.

165
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:12,805
Turkey, where you been?

166
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,501
Where have I been?

167
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:16,514
I've been waiting for hours.

168
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:18,595
You and me both, kid.

169
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,154
Give me the usual
and shake the lead out.

170
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:25,024
Well, I got quiz number 2A
about my room.

171
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:26,026
It's my room.

172
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,775
I should be able to keep it
the way I want to.

173
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:32,356
All due to
the extraordinary efforts

174
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:33,921

She's also on my back

Don't be fresh with me,
young man.

You're terrific, Annabel.

357
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:57,696
You ought to be in Drama class.

358
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:00,771
Hurry along, children.
You'll miss the bus.

359
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:03,494
There's only one thing wrong
with this routine.

360
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:06,879
Our mothers couldn't get through
the day like we put in.

What did you say?

- Right on, Annabel.
- Our mothers couldn't hack it.

363
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:13,600
Your mother wouldn't make it
through first period, Bambi.

364

For sure.

365

trying to handle Miss McGuirk.

"Daddy" before.

of wardrobe for tonight.

- Blue blazer.

It might need a trip
to the cleaners.

That shirt with
the ruffles down the front?

Be careful when you press it.

I'd appreciate it.

Oink, oink, Daddy.

Well, maybe Mom will enjoy
being in my shoes.

432
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:53,951
ELLEN: No wonder Annabel
runs around barefooted.

These sneakers feel
like they're full of marbles.

434

You're right about your hair.
My mom had mine all hacked off.

And now look at me.

to you short.

to sympathize

mean mother?

more change on you.

00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:55,516
Honey, I got to go!

886
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,018
No, look, no.

887
00:41:57,093 --> 00:41:59,810
I'll see you
at the marina at 5:00.

888
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:02,496
Don't forget my clothes.
Yeah, goodbye.

889
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:11,515
What do you think, Max?

890
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:13,956
At least there's no ring
around the collar.

891
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:16,354
Okay.

892
00:42:17,957 --> 00:42:19,648
Oh, great.

893
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,724
He's gonna kill me.

894
00:42:24,997 --> 00:42:26,011
I quit!

895
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,263
I really quit.

896
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,155
ANNABEL:
I'm with Mrs. Schmauss.

897
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:31,326
I don't do personal
maiding either.

898
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:34,496
Everybody around here
has had breakfast but me.

899
00:42:37,477 --> 00:42:40,127
Rotten Ape Face!
I'll clobber him!

900
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:45,091
All right,
macaroni and cheese.

901
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:46,913
Breakfast at last.

902
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:55,964
What a morning.

903
00:42:56,037 --> 00:42:59,517
I'm bored.
Really bored.

904
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:01,564
Hmm. Bored.

905
00:43:01,637 --> 00:43:03,459
I wonder if Boris is home.

906
00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:08,513
Hey, Annabel.
Now's your chance.

907
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:10,948
I can make a pitch for me
when I'm not gorgeous.

908
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:13,053
I mean, when I am gorgeous
and not me.

909
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,532
What'll I say?
Let's see.

910
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:16,059
What's happening, man?

911
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:17,659
Hi, lover boy.

912
00:43:17,733 --> 00:43:19,424
Hello, Boris?

913
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:22,460
This is Mrs. Andrews
across the street.

914
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,868
I was wondering,
could I borrow a cup of...

915
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:27,038
Sugar's too corny.

916
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:31,262
...kibble?

917
00:43:31,332 --> 00:43:33,820
Kibble. K-l-B-B-L-E.

918
00:43:33,893 --> 00:43:36,479
You know, the stuff dogs eat?

919
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:39,451
Yeah, cat kibble.
That'll be fine, too.

920
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:42,143
When Max is hungry,
he'll eat anything.

921
00:43:42,213 --> 00:43:44,701
He's not a kibble quibbler.
Not he.

922
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:46,627
So I wonder, could...

923
00:43:46,692 --> 00:43:48,219
No.

924
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,432
Annabel's not home.

925
00:43:52,452 --> 00:43:54,624
Terrific.

926
00:43:54,693 --> 00:43:55,587
See you.

927
00:43:55,653 --> 00:43:57,344
Oh, wow.
He's coming over.

928
00:43:57,413 --> 00:43:59,267
I can't let him see me
like this.

929
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,504
I've got to
find something devastating.

930
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,801
Sexy, slinky.
Velvet maybe.

931
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:12,799
[Doorbell rings]

932
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:14,145
ELLEN:
Door's open!

933
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:16,896
- Come in, Boris!
- [Barking]

934
00:44:18,885 --> 00:44:23,969
[Imitating British accent]
I'll only be a moment, Boris.

935
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:28,193
Do make yourself
extremely comfortable.

936
00:44:28,261 --> 00:44:29,952
[Barking continues]

937
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:32,443
[Normal voice]
Shut up, Max!

938
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:33,924
[Barking stops]

939
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:43,261
ANNABEL:
No, that'd be overdoing it.

940
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,044
Boris!

941
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,117
Oh, this is good of you.

942
00:44:53,188 --> 00:44:55,261
Do come in.
Come in.

943
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,275
[Congested]
Hi, Mrs. Andrews.

944
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:58,559
Far out!

945
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,963
"Catty Kibbles with horsemeat."

946
00:45:01,061 --> 00:45:04,225
And a ten-cent coupon
for a little flea collar.

947
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:06,650
I can only stay a minute.
I got homework.

948
00:45:06,724 --> 00:45:09,180
Oh, Boris.
I'll treasure it for life.

949
00:45:09,252 --> 00:45:10,332
I got to go.

950
00:45:10,405 --> 00:45:14,180
Yum-yum. Oh, Boris, that's
a dreadful cold you have.

951
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:17,376
Oh, no, no. Let me get you
some vitamin "C."

952
00:45:17,445 --> 00:45:18,754
You don't have to.

953
00:45:18,821 --> 00:45:20,250
I'll put this away.

954
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:21,535
You don't have to.

955
00:45:21,605 --> 00:45:23,612
In the jewelry box.

956
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:28,157
You know, Boris,
this, I believe,

957
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:30,334
is the first time
you've had a chance,

958
00:45:30,405 --> 00:45:32,576
to see our lovely, lovely home!

959
00:45:32,644 --> 00:45:34,335
It's simple but elegant!

960
00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:36,609
Boris? Boris?
Where are you?

961
00:45:36,677 --> 00:45:38,171
Who lives in here?

962
00:45:38,245 --> 00:45:39,871
My son, Ben.

963
00:45:39,941 --> 00:45:41,948
With a canopy bed
and a dollhouse?

964
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:43,744
With a canopy bed
and a dollhouse.

965
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:45,700
He's a peculiar boy.
He's liberated.

966
00:45:45,765 --> 00:45:48,001
I'll say.
He's also a slob.

967
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:49,181
Excuse me, Boris.

968
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:51,773
Boris, here.
Vitamin "C."

969
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:53,306
Take two.
They're chewable.

970
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:54,329
Thank you.

971
00:45:54,405 --> 00:45:55,681
Hmm. They're good.

972
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:57,374
- Delicious.
- Mmm, mmm.

973
00:45:57,477 --> 00:45:59,844
I don't really have a cold.
It's adenoids.

974
00:45:59,877 --> 00:46:01,885
Or an allergy to my mother.

975
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:03,712
Anyway, it comes and goes.

976
00:46:03,781 --> 00:46:06,115
It keeps me home from school.

977
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:08,348
Well...

978
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,388
Boris! You want to hang around
outside for a while?

979
00:46:11,461 --> 00:46:14,722
Being cooped up in here
just gets me crazy.

980
00:46:14,788 --> 00:46:16,195
Sure.

981
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:20,483
But aren't you dressed kinda
funny to be hanging around?

982
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,931
You're right.
I'm gonna put on some shoes.

983
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:29,949
You and your boy
have the same size feet?

984
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,410
Yeah, I told you he's peculiar.

985
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:35,681
Okay.

986
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:37,026
Let's go.

987
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:42,788
...Which indirectly led
United States intervention

988
00:46:42,853 --> 00:46:44,194
into what, class?

989
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:45,505
Korean Conflict.

990
00:46:45,573 --> 00:46:46,555
Yes.

991
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:49,181
And that took place when,
children?

992
00:46:49,252 --> 00:46:50,845
In June or July of 1950

993
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:53,404
with the naval air and ground
forces leading the way.

994
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,971
Precisely.

995
00:46:55,077 --> 00:46:57,727
Didn't anyone else do
their preparation for today?

996
00:46:57,765 --> 00:46:59,805
Go on, Annabel.

997
00:46:59,877 --> 00:47:02,211
ELLEN:
Brownie points coming right up.

998
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:06,303
Well, in order to fully
comprehend the Korean Conflict,

999
00:47:06,372 --> 00:47:08,641
it is necessary to review
all the events.

1000
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,748
Is that very hard to throw?

1001
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,526
Not if you know how.

1002
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:16,091
Want me to show you?

1003
00:47:16,165 --> 00:47:17,310
Mm-hmm.

1004
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:19,834
Come here.

1005
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:21,119
Okay.

1006
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:24,443
Okay.

1007
00:47:24,516 --> 00:47:25,564
Excuse me.

1008
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:28,539
Okay, you just swing
your arm back.

1009
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,336
- Then bring it forward.
- Mm-hmm.

1010
00:47:30,405 --> 00:47:31,998
- Swing it back.
- Mm-hmm.

1011
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:33,563
Then you bring it forward.

1012
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:35,360
- Then you swing it back.
- Mmm...

1013
00:47:35,428 --> 00:47:37,054
Then you bring it...

1014
00:47:38,885 --> 00:47:39,899
Try it by yourself.

1015
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:41,085
Okay.

1016
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:47,267
Say, I bet you do
great for a lady.

1017
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:50,878
If you think I'd be good,
you should show Annabel.

1018
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:52,028
She'd be so good.

1019
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,791
I'd rather show you.

1020
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:57,025
ANNABEL:
Not Mom. Me, dum-dum.

1021
00:47:57,093 --> 00:48:02,014
Actually, Boris, lately,
Annabel is completely changed.

1022
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:05,794
She's no longer the same person
who cut your head open

1023
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:08,675
with a tin shovel in the
playground five years ago.

1024
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:11,228
Four.
I've still got the scar.

1025
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,729
Okay, four.

1026
00:48:12,805 --> 00:48:14,692
Anyway, if you'd seen
her lately,

1027
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:16,699
you wouldn't recognize her.

1028
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:18,496
Does she still have braces?

1029
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,315
'Cause if she still has braces,
I'd recognize her.

1030
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:25,407
I mean, now Annabel is so nice.

1031
00:48:25,477 --> 00:48:26,884
She's nice-nice nice.

1032
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:29,338
- Well, I'm sure she is.
- Extremely nice.

1033
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:32,096
But, Miss Andrews,
to be perfectly frank,

1034
00:48:32,164 --> 00:48:33,408
that's not saying much.

1035
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,517
Boris, you turkey.
I can't bear it.

1036
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,049
Split!

1037
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,082
It didn't turn around
and come back.

1038
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:46,782
Did it ever do that with you?!

1039
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:48,446
No, I just got it today.

1040
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:49,978
I never thrown it.

1041
00:48:50,085 --> 00:48:54,395
The responsibility fell on
the Eisenhower administration.

1042
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,083
ELLEN:
"Open me"?

1043
00:48:58,148 --> 00:48:59,130
[Laughter]

1044
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:01,954
"Clam up and"...Hmm.

1045
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:03,548
Very cute.

1046
00:49:05,764 --> 00:49:08,098
Go ahead, Annabel.
You're doing just fine.

1047
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:10,783
Responsibility fell on
the Eisenhower administration,

1048
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:13,820
which was the first Republican
administration in 20 years.

1049
00:49:13,893 --> 00:49:18,170
The most salient characteristic
of the Eisenhower years was...

1050
00:49:18,244 --> 00:49:19,771
What's going on back there?!

1051
00:49:19,845 --> 00:49:24,001
I'm sorry, Miss Benson.
I seem to have dropped a book.

1052
00:49:24,068 --> 00:49:25,694
[Bell rings]

1053
00:49:25,765 --> 00:49:27,740
I gotta get some books
at the locker.

1054
00:49:27,812 --> 00:49:29,373
I'll meet you after class.

1055
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:31,136
I have an even better idea.

1056
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:32,382
Come on.
I'll show you.

1057
00:49:32,452 --> 00:49:35,234
You're too much!
I just can't believe it.

1058
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:36,348
What's wrong?

1059
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:38,428
One day you don't know
about history.

1060
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:40,803
Today you made us all
look like dummies.

1061
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:42,429
I don't understand, Virginia.

1062
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,988
I was just doing
what I was supposed to do.

1063
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:47,614
What do you want me to do?
Pretend I didn't know?

1064
00:49:48,516 --> 00:49:50,971
- See you later, Annabel.
- Let's get out of here.

1065
00:49:51,044 --> 00:49:54,492
Bye-bye, Brains.

1066
00:49:54,565 --> 00:49:55,710
ELLEN:
How do you win?!

1067
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:57,275
One bunch thumps you
if you don't do well.

1068
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:00,251
The other bunch snubs
you if you do!

1069
00:50:00,325 --> 00:50:02,430
Oh! What a zoo!

1070
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,736
Sorry about that accident.

1071
00:50:04,805 --> 00:50:08,601
My fault. I just owe Mary Kay
a hair drier and a window.

1072
00:50:08,676 --> 00:50:10,432
Yeah, well, anyway, thanks.

1073
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,224
Okay.

1074
00:50:12,293 --> 00:50:13,275
It's really nice.

1075
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:15,105
Maybe we should do it again.

1076
00:50:15,173 --> 00:50:17,442
I mean, we could play Monopoly,
something.

1077
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:19,778
- Well, I'd like that.
- Yeah?

1078
00:50:19,844 --> 00:50:21,819
Most grown-ups
don't want to play games.

1079
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,129
They're always too busy
or something.

1080
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:27,230
But, then, you're not
the same as most grown-ups.

1081
00:50:27,301 --> 00:50:28,959
ANNABEL:
Go on. I love it.

1082
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:30,556
You're...

1083
00:50:30,629 --> 00:50:32,516
- Yeah?
- Well.

1084
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,035
Did you notice
my allergy is completely gone?

1085
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:35,839
Yeah.

1086
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,730
Maybe I'm allergic to my mother.

1087
00:50:37,796 --> 00:50:40,699
But I'm certainly
not allergic to you.

1088
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:43,936
In fact, I kinda wish
I was 20 years older.

1089
00:50:44,004 --> 00:50:46,688
And I wish I were
20 years younger,

1090
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:49,952
or something like that,
I guess.

1091
00:50:51,909 --> 00:50:56,927
Oh, well, see you, Boris.

1092
00:50:56,996 --> 00:50:58,655
- And Mrs. Andrews?
- Hmm?

1093
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,994
Well, you shouldn't
blame yourself.

1094
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:04,127
It's not your fault
that Annabel's the way she is.

1095
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:07,099
I mean, she's probably what
they call a bad seed.

1096
00:51:07,173 --> 00:51:09,278
Oh!

1097
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:16,794
I wish I was dead!

1098
00:51:22,981 --> 00:51:24,671
Team, listen up!

1099
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:28,479
[Whistle blows]

1100
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:30,207
Listen up!

1101
00:51:30,276 --> 00:51:32,993
I don't have to tell you
what this game means.

1102
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,100
They're out to kill us!

1103
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:38,587
I want you guys to get out there
and hit 'em high! Hit 'em low!

1104
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,049
ELLEN: I don't believe this.
I've joined the Marines.

1105
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,586
TOGETHER:
Yeah!

1106
00:51:42,693 --> 00:51:44,154
Can we beat these cream puffs?

1107
00:51:44,197 --> 00:51:45,244
TOGETHER:
Yeah!

1108
00:51:45,317 --> 00:51:46,494
Are we gonna beat 'em?

1109
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:47,579
TOGETHER:
Yeah!

1110
00:51:47,652 --> 00:51:50,369
Let's get out there
and knock their blocks off!

1111
00:51:50,436 --> 00:51:52,346
[Indistinct cheering]

1112
00:51:54,565 --> 00:51:56,452
Where's your team spirit,
Annabel?

1113
00:51:56,516 --> 00:51:58,305
Never seen you so down before.

1114
00:51:58,372 --> 00:51:59,933
You haven't?

1115
00:52:00,004 --> 00:52:02,143
I guess I'm just
a little nervous.

1116
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:03,325
Don't be silly.

1117
00:52:03,397 --> 00:52:04,738
All you gotta do

1118
00:52:04,804 --> 00:52:08,220
is make your usual zillion
goals, and we got it made.

1119
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,885
ELLEN:
Oh, yeah? No problem.

1120
00:52:09,956 --> 00:52:11,069
COACH BETS Y:
Andrews!

1121
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:12,035
Uh-oh.

1122
00:52:12,101 --> 00:52:14,272
Andrews, why aren't
you changed yet?

1123
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,355
Get on the stick!

1124
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:17,283
Sure, but which one's
her locker?

1125
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:20,196
Andrews, move, move, move!

1126
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,340
My locker's stuck.

1127
00:52:21,412 --> 00:52:23,485
You'll just have
to perform without me.

1128
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,596
Perform without you?

1129
00:52:25,668 --> 00:52:27,261
What's with the big words?

1130
00:52:27,332 --> 00:52:28,510
Here!

1131
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:33,731
Don't you ever take
anything home to be washed?

1132
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:35,040
Never!

1133
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:39,581
Now, suit up and get out there
on the double.

1134
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,023
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1135
00:52:49,092 --> 00:52:51,067
Shut up, you guys,
and listen!

1136
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,693
Now, remember our game plan.

1137
00:52:53,764 --> 00:52:55,226
Get the ball to Annabel!

1138
00:52:55,301 --> 00:52:58,018
If anybody's gonna win it
for us, it's our tough,

1139
00:52:58,084 --> 00:53:00,637
rock-'em, sock-'em,
superjock Annabel Andrews!

1140
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:01,756
[All cheering]

1141
00:53:01,828 --> 00:53:06,236
Get your butts out there
and kill, kill, kill!

1142
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:08,218
[Cheering continues]

1143
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:09,666
Now, listen, girls.

1144
00:53:09,732 --> 00:53:11,555
I taught you to play fair,

1145
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:14,436
to play clean,
and with good sportsmanship.

1146
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:17,567
Still, the name of
the game is winning.

1147
00:53:17,637 --> 00:53:20,703
And we can only win this one
if you remember one thing.

1148
00:53:20,772 --> 00:53:23,455
Get Annabel Andrews
and get her good!

1149
00:53:23,524 --> 00:53:25,347
[All cheering]

1150
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:29,281
Look, I'm gonna try
my best today,

1151
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:31,356
but if anything
should go wrong...

1152
00:53:31,429 --> 00:53:32,574
Well, why should it?

1153
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:35,295
Well, I told you.
I'm not the same person today.

1154
00:53:35,365 --> 00:53:37,918
So I've noticed.
You have to snap out of it.

1155
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,257
This is a real important game.

1156
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:41,503
I'll try.

1157
00:53:41,573 --> 00:53:44,322
But I mean it.
I'm not the same person.

1158
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,428
[Whistle blows]

1159
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,573
Forward in the "centa"!

1160
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:49,538
Center.

1161
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:50,498
Oh!

1162
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:51,993
Hey, that's you.

1163
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:54,043
Go get 'em, Annabel.

1164
00:54:00,548 --> 00:54:02,555
ELLEN: I played this once
in eighth grade.

1165
00:54:02,628 --> 00:54:04,603
Ready to bully!

1166
00:54:08,324 --> 00:54:09,534
Bully!

1167
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:11,360
Come on, let's go!

1168
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:18,879
Ow! Ow! Oh!

1169
00:54:18,948 --> 00:54:21,796
Don't worry. I'm all right.
Don't worry about me.

1170
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,834
Go get it!

1171
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,010
How come you didn't bring
the car?

1172
00:54:43,077 --> 00:54:45,498
How come I didn't bring
the car?

1173
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:46,914
Quit griping, will you?

1174
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,889
I thought we could use
the exercise.

1175
00:54:48,964 --> 00:54:51,004
We'll never make it home
for lunch.

1176
00:54:51,076 --> 00:54:54,175
Sit here. It just happens
I brought lunch with me.

1177
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:56,797
It's a pickup lunch.
Pick up anything you want.

1178
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,974
Throw the rest
back in the bag.

1179
00:55:00,484 --> 00:55:01,859
- Gin?
- Aaah!

1180
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,379
That's the wrong bag, honey.

1181
00:55:04,452 --> 00:55:06,940
No lamb chops, baked potato,
and string beans?

1182
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,314
Not unless you want to
cook it yourself.

1183
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,558
I fired Mrs. Schmauss.

1184
00:55:10,628 --> 00:55:12,057
Yahoo!

1185
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:13,855
You didn't like her either.

1186
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:16,412
Like her?
Mom, I hate her!

1187
00:55:16,484 --> 00:55:18,589
She talks cross
and smells funny.

1188
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,089
But mostly I hate her

1189
00:55:20,164 --> 00:55:23,197
because she says Annabel's
a spoiled brat and a pig.

1190
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:26,334
I heard that once today.
I don't have to hear it again.

1191
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:28,346
Besides, does it make sense?

1192
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,268
You hate Mrs. Schmauss because
Mrs. Schmauss hates Annabel.

1193
00:55:31,332 --> 00:55:33,154
But Annabel hates you.

1194
00:55:33,252 --> 00:55:35,707
By rights, the person
you should hate is Annabel.

1195
00:55:35,748 --> 00:55:37,439
I know.

1196
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:39,679
I try, but I just can't.

1197
00:55:39,748 --> 00:55:40,642
Why not?

1198
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:41,788
Well, for one thing.

1199
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,194
Let's see.
She gets neat ideas.

1200
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:46,595
Like the time we filled up
balloons with water

1201
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,154
and threw them out the window.

1202
00:55:48,228 --> 00:55:50,399
Oh, that was really neat.

1203
00:55:50,468 --> 00:55:53,785
Want to tell Mommy some other
neat things Annabel thinks up?

1204
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:56,130
There's Billy and John!
Can I go play with them?

1205
00:55:56,196 --> 00:55:58,203
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1206
00:55:59,716 --> 00:56:02,083
ANNABEL:
He's not as finky as I thought.

1207
00:56:07,268 --> 00:56:09,210
Don't just lie there, Annabel!

1208
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:11,423
Get up and hit 'em back!

1209
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,143
We're gonna lose if she
don't get off her duff.

1210
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:29,630
Time-out. Time-out.

1211
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:31,772
I gotta tie my shoelaces, here.

1212
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:37,760
No, hold on!

1213
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,577
Who did that?

1214
00:56:43,652 --> 00:56:45,856
You're gonna get it this time.

1215
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:49,791
[Whistle blows]

1216
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,591
Foul!

1217
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,594
Yes, definitely a foul.
Questionable.

1218
00:56:53,668 --> 00:56:56,450
ELLEN: Two years and $2, 000 to
get these teeth straightened,

1219
00:56:56,517 --> 00:56:58,883
and they want to knock them out
in one afternoon.

1220
00:56:58,948 --> 00:56:59,896
I quit!

1221
00:57:01,508 --> 00:57:02,719
Annabel, come on back!

1222
00:57:02,788 --> 00:57:04,413
Annabel, where are you going?

1223
00:57:04,484 --> 00:57:05,629
The game's not over.

1224
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,610
The score is tied.
We can still win.

1225
00:57:07,684 --> 00:57:10,237
Where are you going, Annabel?
Can't you take it?

1226
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:12,829
She's probably changing
from blue to yellow.

1227
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,656
Annabel, yellow?

1228
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:16,098
Sloppy, yes.

1229
00:57:16,164 --> 00:57:17,920
Yellow, never!

1230
00:57:18,724 --> 00:57:20,579
All right, give me
that broomstick,

1231
00:57:20,644 --> 00:57:22,749
and get out of my way!

1232
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,381
We're gonna win this game!

1233
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:27,069
[Whistle blows]

1234
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:34,077
I got this!

1235
00:57:34,147 --> 00:57:35,041
I got it!

1236
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:36,056
Ahh!

1237
00:57:38,052 --> 00:57:39,099
BOYS:
Yeah!

1238
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:40,830
Wow!

1239
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,558
BO Y:
No way!

1240
00:58:03,588 --> 00:58:04,995
Yay!

1241
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:34,524
You're out!

1242
00:58:34,596 --> 00:58:36,003
What do you mean, I'm out?

1243
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:37,497
- You're out!
- No, I'm not.

1244
00:58:37,572 --> 00:58:39,165
- I was safe.
- You're out!

1245
00:58:39,236 --> 00:58:40,664
What do you mean, I'm out?

1246
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:41,633
Go take a walk!

1247
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:43,423
Okay. Mmm!

1248
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,256
Strike three!
You're outta there!

1249
00:59:38,147 --> 00:59:39,129
Whoo!

1250
00:59:39,203 --> 00:59:40,381
All right!

1251
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,154
No, no.
That's the wrong goal!

1252
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,976
Come back, Annabel!

1253
00:59:51,044 --> 00:59:52,734
Don't do this to me!

1254
00:59:52,803 --> 00:59:54,658
Hey, way to go, Annabel!

1255
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:56,611
Good move!

1256
00:59:56,675 --> 00:59:58,879
No, Annabel.
No! No!

1257
00:59:58,947 --> 01:00:00,474
No! No! No!

1258
01:00:00,548 --> 01:00:02,239
[Whistle blows]

1259
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:04,602
Oh!

1260
01:00:04,675 --> 01:00:06,170
Time!

1261
01:00:06,243 --> 01:00:09,560
Winning goal by blue captain,
Annabel Andrews!

1262
01:00:09,636 --> 01:00:11,097
Final score.

1263
01:00:11,171 --> 01:00:15,743
Reds, eight.
Blues, Seven!

1264
01:00:17,763 --> 01:00:19,073
Where did I go wrong?

1265
01:00:20,804 --> 01:00:22,778
I know it's hard for you
to remember.

1266
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:24,444
I'm Jo-Jo, and you're Annabel.

1267
01:00:24,515 --> 01:00:27,385
And we both play
for the same team.

1268
01:00:27,459 --> 01:00:30,688
ELLEN: Oh, good grief.
I've goofed again.

1269
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:32,730
Boy, Mom, that was terrific.

1270
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:36,032
That's even better than Annabel.
She's a super ballplayer.

1271
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,506
Really?

1272
01:00:38,627 --> 01:00:40,962
- And she's beautiful.
- She's what?

1273
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:44,061
I think she's beautiful.
And I love her braces.

1274
01:00:44,131 --> 01:00:46,881
I hope when I get that old,
I'll have braces, too.

1275
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:49,467
With your luck,
you won't need braces.

1276
01:00:49,539 --> 01:00:51,547
That's what I'm afraid of.

1277
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:54,783
Then Annabel's gonna hate me
more than she does now.

1278
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:57,088
Well, why does she
hate me so much?

1279
01:00:57,155 --> 01:00:59,708
Because there's nothing
more annoying

1280
01:00:59,779 --> 01:01:02,365
than a little blue-eyed saint
with perfect teeth

1281
01:01:02,436 --> 01:01:05,752
who's always on time,
never has a messy room.

1282
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,453
Do you hate me, too?

1283
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:08,636
Don't be a jackass.

1284
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:10,878
I'm trying to tell you
why Annabel hates you.

1285
01:01:10,915 --> 01:01:12,955
But I can't help those things.

1286
01:01:13,027 --> 01:01:14,969
I can't help what I look like.

1287
01:01:15,043 --> 01:01:18,426
And about being neat.
I can't help that, either.

1288
01:01:18,499 --> 01:01:20,866
Listen, if I thought
she'd like me better,

1289
01:01:20,932 --> 01:01:22,525
I'd be messy.

1290
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,897
I've even tried being messy.

1291
01:01:24,963 --> 01:01:27,232
Once I took all
my piled-up blocks

1292
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,826
and the books on the shelves

1293
01:01:28,899 --> 01:01:32,576
and the big bag of marbles
and the LEGOs and threw them

1294
01:01:32,643 --> 01:01:36,866
so Annabel wouldn't be
the only one getting in trouble.

1295
01:01:36,931 --> 01:01:38,753
That stinky old Mrs. Schmauss

1296
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,529
said I was too young to know any
better and picked everything up.

1297
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:45,978
So no matter what I do,
Annabel keeps on hating me.

1298
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:48,419
Well, why don't you
hate her back?

1299
01:01:48,484 --> 01:01:49,793
That's a good idea.

1300
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:51,168
I told you before.

1301
01:01:51,235 --> 01:01:52,163
I tried.

1302
01:01:52,227 --> 01:01:54,845
But you can't hate someone
and love them.

1303
01:01:54,915 --> 01:01:56,770
Can you, Mom?

1304
01:01:56,835 --> 01:02:00,316
No, I didn't use to think so.

1305
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,111
ANNABEL:
But maybe you can.

1306
01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:06,074
Now blow.

1307
01:02:06,147 --> 01:02:07,576
- Feel better now?
- Uh-huh.

1308
01:02:07,651 --> 01:02:09,539
Come on, let's go home.

1309
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,421
Honey, where have you been?!

1310
01:02:15,491 --> 01:02:17,401
Never mind.
We've got problems.

1311
01:02:17,476 --> 01:02:21,054
That rat-fink Mary Kay.
She called you?

1312
01:02:21,124 --> 01:02:24,320
Told you about the boomerang
through the window, did she?

1313
01:02:24,387 --> 01:02:25,729
I've got a real problem.

1314
01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:27,770
Will you listen
for half a minute?

1315
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,659
We have no buffet
for the marina tonight.

1316
01:02:30,724 --> 01:02:33,593
Mrs. White thought Mrs. Matthews
was gonna handle this.

1317
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,449
Mrs. Matthews thought Mrs. White
was gonna handle this.

1318
01:02:36,515 --> 01:02:37,443
Who's gonna handle it?

1319
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:39,296
- You are!
- Me?!

1320
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:41,087
There's only gonna be 25 people.

1321
01:02:41,155 --> 01:02:44,451
I've already told them
what a great cook you are.

1322
01:02:44,516 --> 01:02:46,207
- No! But I...
- Honey.

1323
01:02:46,276 --> 01:02:47,869
You got three whole hours.

1324
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,827
Thanks, love.
Goodbye.

1325
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:50,785
Whew!

1326
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,509
Bah!

1327
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:56,290
Male chauvinist pig.

1328
01:02:56,355 --> 01:03:00,152
Mommy, why did you call Daddy
a male chauvinist pig just now?

1329
01:03:00,228 --> 01:03:01,657
Because that's what he is.

1330
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:03,041
But what is one?

1331
01:03:03,108 --> 01:03:06,937
A male chauvinist pig is a
husband who spends three months

1332
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:09,182
taking bows for a shindig
he's gonna throw,

1333
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:13,180
and he gives his wife
three hours to save his skin.

1334
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:16,219
Oh.

1335
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:18,975
[Intercom buzzes]

1336
01:03:19,043 --> 01:03:20,287
Yes, Mr. Andrews?

1337
01:03:20,355 --> 01:03:21,249
ELLEN:
Uh-oh.

1338
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:22,941
Where did she come from?

1339
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:25,565
Uh-huh.

1340
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,708
Oh, could you hold on
a minute, please?

1341
01:03:27,779 --> 01:03:28,673
May I help you?

1342
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:30,146
Could you tell Mr. Andrews

1343
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:32,764
that his daughter
would like to see him?

1344
01:03:32,835 --> 01:03:34,329
Mr. Andrews?

1345
01:03:34,403 --> 01:03:36,345
Your daughter is here.

1346
01:03:38,372 --> 01:03:40,226
Fine.

1347
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:42,681
Would you walk this way, please?

1348
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:48,514
You've got to be kidding.

1349
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:51,133
You're the new secretary,
I suppose.

1350
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:52,218
Enjoying your work?

1351
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:53,665
Oh, very much.

1352
01:03:53,732 --> 01:03:55,422
How is Mr. Andrews to work for?

1353
01:03:55,491 --> 01:03:57,018
Oh, he's just a doll.

1354
01:03:57,091 --> 01:03:59,066
We get along.

1355
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:07,327
He's pleasant
and very professional.

1356
01:04:07,395 --> 01:04:08,955
I can't complain.

1357
01:04:09,027 --> 01:04:10,816
I can.

1358
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:13,306
You know, Miss...

1359
01:04:13,379 --> 01:04:14,623
Gibbons.

1360
01:04:14,691 --> 01:04:15,837
Miss Gibbons, yes.

1361
01:04:15,907 --> 01:04:18,690
My father is an extremely
devoted family man.

1362
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,380
Extremely devoted.

1363
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:21,978
Oh, I know he is.

1364
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:25,826
He talks about you and
your mother all the time.

1365
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:29,437
She must be a lovely person.

1366
01:04:29,508 --> 01:04:32,442
Darn tootin'.
She's quite a doll, also.

1367
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:36,028
Dangerous lady to lock horns
with, if you know what I mean.

1368
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:46,205
- Hi.
- Huh?

1369
01:04:46,275 --> 01:04:48,545
Oh, hi, Honey.
What brings you here?

1370
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:49,887
Oh, nothing much.

1371
01:04:49,955 --> 01:04:52,377
Why didn't you tell Mom
about your secretary?

1372
01:04:52,451 --> 01:04:53,596
What's there to tell?

1373
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:57,147
But, darling,
you always used to tell me.

1374
01:05:00,035 --> 01:05:03,712
Too late, Miss Gibbons.
I've already seen your action.

1375
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:06,943
Mr. Andrews, you wanted to sign
this as soon as it was ready.

1376
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:08,799
Thanks.

1377
01:05:08,868 --> 01:05:11,585
Lucille, you're
not going somewhere?

1378
01:05:11,651 --> 01:05:12,545
Oh, no.

1379
01:05:12,611 --> 01:05:15,480
It's just a bit chilly
in here, don't you think?

1380
01:05:15,555 --> 01:05:17,017
Oh, yeah.

1381
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,450
Hadn't noticed.

1382
01:05:21,123 --> 01:05:22,749
Thank you.

1383
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:24,226
Mm-hmm.

1384
01:05:28,068 --> 01:05:30,042
Now, what can I do for you?

1385
01:05:30,115 --> 01:05:32,701
Look at me.
Aren't I revolting?

1386
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:35,007
You look like
a typical teenager to me.

1387
01:05:35,075 --> 01:05:37,050
And I think
it's time for a change.

1388
01:05:37,123 --> 01:05:38,716
You came to ask me that?

1389
01:05:38,787 --> 01:05:40,161
Well, no, not exactly.

1390
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:44,002
You know, I'm getting my braces
off this afternoon.

1391
01:05:44,067 --> 01:05:46,588
I thought I'd get my hair done
and my nails.

1392
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,383
What's left of them.

1393
01:05:48,451 --> 01:05:50,753
You don't need
my permission for that.

1394
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:51,517
Oh, I know.

1395
01:05:51,587 --> 01:05:53,081
But I thought I'd go out

1396
01:05:53,155 --> 01:05:55,675
and get some new clothes
to go with the new me.

1397
01:05:55,747 --> 01:05:58,049
I wondered if I could borrow
your credit cards

1398
01:05:58,115 --> 01:06:00,319
with a note of authorization.

1399
01:06:00,387 --> 01:06:01,631
I think we can do that.

1400
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:03,325
Miss Gibbons
can take care of it.

1401
01:06:03,395 --> 01:06:04,802
I'll bet she can.

1402
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:07,103
I think I hate Miss Gibbons.

1403
01:06:14,339 --> 01:06:15,452
Yes, Mr. Andrews?

1404
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:16,767
Yeah.

1405
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:27,993
Would you take
a short note, please?

1406
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:30,626
Yes, sir?

1407
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:34,106
To whom it may concern.

1408
01:06:35,747 --> 01:06:38,081
"To whom it may concern."

1409
01:06:38,147 --> 01:06:40,733
Please allow my daughter,
Annabel Andrews,

1410
01:06:40,803 --> 01:06:42,559
whose signature appears below,

1411
01:06:42,627 --> 01:06:45,344
to use my credit cards,
et cetera, et cetera.

1412
01:06:45,411 --> 01:06:46,905
Sincerely yours.
Got that?

1413
01:06:46,979 --> 01:06:48,801
Certainly.

1414
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:51,005
Have it ready for you
in a jiffy.

1415
01:06:58,979 --> 01:07:01,400
Ugly-looking thing, isn't she?

1416
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:04,257
I'll tell you the truth.
I've seen her look better.

1417
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:05,600
She's got a lot on her mind.

1418
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:07,391
She better not have.

1419
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:08,636
Such as?

1420
01:07:08,707 --> 01:07:10,496
Husband's out of a job,
sick kid,

1421
01:07:10,563 --> 01:07:12,189
and a difficult mother-in-law.

1422
01:07:12,259 --> 01:07:15,226
Annabel, I don't have time
to spend on this.

1423
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:16,760
Anything else I can do?

1424
01:07:16,835 --> 01:07:18,591
No, nothing.
This is fine.

1425
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,034
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot, Dad.

1426
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:25,249
Ellen Andrews, you are a
conniving, suspicious old bat.

1427
01:07:25,315 --> 01:07:27,071
Thanks a lot, Daddy.

1428
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:31,710
Okay.
Preheat oven to 325.

1429
01:07:31,779 --> 01:07:32,727
How do you do that?

1430
01:07:32,803 --> 01:07:35,585
Turn it to preheat, stupido.
Sweetie.

1431
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,025
Preheat on our stove

1432
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:39,196
is when the oven
and the broiler are on.

1433
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:40,674
It gets hot faster.

1434
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:42,594
Oh.

1435
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:47,264
For a 20-pound bird,
that will take 61/2 hours.

1436
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:48,279
Do we have time?

1437
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,322
Only if you double everything.
Turn it up full blast.

1438
01:07:53,251 --> 01:07:55,706
- [Telephone rings]
- Answer that, will you?

1439
01:07:55,779 --> 01:07:57,819
Hello?

1440
01:07:57,891 --> 01:07:59,963
Hang on.
It's for you.

1441
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:02,457
Can't you see I'm up
to my armpits in gunk?

1442
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:04,538
Who is it?
What do they want?

1443
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:07,775
Who are you,
and what do you want?

1444
01:08:07,843 --> 01:08:09,730
Okay, I'll tell her.

1445
01:08:10,723 --> 01:08:12,446
That was
the principal's office.

1446
01:08:12,515 --> 01:08:17,054
He says you're 15 minutes late
for the conference with him.

1447
01:08:17,123 --> 01:08:18,912
Mr. Dilk?

1448
01:08:20,323 --> 01:08:21,784
What does he want?

1449
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:23,485
Wow!

1450
01:08:23,555 --> 01:08:25,245
What does he want?!

1451
01:08:25,315 --> 01:08:26,493
Oh!

1452
01:08:26,563 --> 01:08:28,734
Male chauvinist pig!

1453
01:08:28,803 --> 01:08:30,014
Mr. Dilk, too?

1454
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:33,050
No, still your father
for getting me into this mess.

1455
01:08:33,123 --> 01:08:34,912
Who are you calling?

1456
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:36,986
Hello, Boris?

1457
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:38,750
This is Mrs. Andrews.

1458
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:43,074
How would you like to babysit
a small boy and a turkey?

1459
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,849
Let's see, what else
can I tell you?

1460
01:08:45,923 --> 01:08:47,265
The bird's in the oven.

1461
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:49,698
Just don't touch it,
whatever you do.

1462
01:08:49,763 --> 01:08:51,868
And, Boris, you don't say

1463
01:08:51,939 --> 01:08:54,590
you could whip up a dessert
for about 25?

1464
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:57,081
Oh, you know, Jell-O,
something like that.

1465
01:08:57,155 --> 01:08:59,097
I made a chocolate mousse once.

1466
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,480
Do that again.

1467
01:09:00,547 --> 01:09:01,561
He's gonna cook?

1468
01:09:01,635 --> 01:09:03,708
Isn't that sort of
a sissy thing to do?

1469
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:05,273
Look who's talking.

1470
01:09:05,347 --> 01:09:07,900
The kid with the canopy bed
and the dollhouse.

1471
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:10,142
- I don't have a...
- Your nose is runny!

1472
01:09:10,211 --> 01:09:11,837
I wouldn't mention that.

1473
01:09:11,907 --> 01:09:13,761
He's sensitive on the subject.

1474
01:09:13,827 --> 01:09:14,906
I can imagine.

1475
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:17,313
Everything fine?

1476
01:09:17,379 --> 01:09:19,135
Okay, I'm off and running, kids.

1477
01:09:19,203 --> 01:09:21,275
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.

1478
01:09:21,347 --> 01:09:23,235
- Got your car keys?
- Car keys?

1479
01:09:23,299 --> 01:09:24,477
For the car, you mean?

1480
01:09:24,547 --> 01:09:27,481
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

1481
01:09:27,555 --> 01:09:28,504
In the state I'm in,

1482
01:09:28,578 --> 01:09:33,434
I'd probably kill
myself if I drove.

1483
01:09:33,507 --> 01:09:35,034
I can take the bus.

1484
01:09:35,107 --> 01:09:37,081
I've got bus fare.

1485
01:09:37,155 --> 01:09:39,522
I'll put this on in the bus.

1486
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:08,651
Annabel!
Where have you been?!

1487
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,217
We've been looking all over!

1488
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:11,719
I got some new clothes.

1489
01:11:11,795 --> 01:11:13,224
Come on.
We have to hurry.

1490
01:11:13,299 --> 01:11:14,859
Come on, Annabel!
Hurry up!

1491
01:11:14,931 --> 01:11:17,549
Why didn't you tell us
where you were going?

1492
01:11:17,618 --> 01:11:18,633
You look different.

1493
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:20,332
Your dad's gonna be mad.

1494
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:22,672
Let's get this hearse moving.

1495
01:11:25,331 --> 01:11:28,560
How could you come up
with a grade like that?

1496
01:11:28,627 --> 01:11:30,383
Doesn't she talk up in class?

1497
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,399
All the time.

1498
01:11:31,475 --> 01:11:33,329
Doesn't that add up
to something?

1499
01:11:33,395 --> 01:11:35,816
It does. 37.

1500
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,313
But Annabel has
an extraordinary I.Q.,

1501
01:11:38,386 --> 01:11:41,550
and her verbal aptitude is
higher than a college freshman.

1502
01:11:41,618 --> 01:11:43,407
Nobody ever told me that.

1503
01:11:43,475 --> 01:11:45,035
Why didn't you tell me that?

1504
01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:46,513
ANNABEL:
I'm really a whiz?

1505
01:11:46,579 --> 01:11:49,034
I admire and love
your little girl.

1506
01:11:49,107 --> 01:11:50,186
She's the child

1507
01:11:50,258 --> 01:11:53,128
every teacher dreams of
discovering in her classroom.

1508
01:11:53,203 --> 01:11:56,334
When you finally do and can't
get through to her at all,

1509
01:11:56,403 --> 01:12:00,112
then you have to face the fact
that perhaps I am the failure.

1510
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:02,699
And that Annabel,
in more capable hands,

1511
01:12:02,771 --> 01:12:05,771
would learn to implement the
gifts that God gave her.

1512
01:12:05,843 --> 01:12:07,915
But I don't have that ability,
I guess.

1513
01:12:07,987 --> 01:12:10,605
And it just breaks my heart.

1514
01:12:10,674 --> 01:12:13,227
Come now, Miss McGuirk.
Don't cry.

1515
01:12:13,298 --> 01:12:14,640
It's not your fault.

1516
01:12:14,707 --> 01:12:18,056
She's sometimes a bit
of a flaky chick, that's all.

1517
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:20,367
This is your daughter
we're discussing.

1518
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:21,383
Yes, I know.

1519
01:12:21,459 --> 01:12:23,826
She's suddenly changed
from a model student

1520
01:12:23,891 --> 01:12:27,087
to a flaky chick.

1521
01:12:27,155 --> 01:12:28,845
Yes, flaky. That's it.

1522
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:31,249
There has to be a reason
for her behavior.

1523
01:12:31,315 --> 01:12:33,519
A variation in her environment?

1524
01:12:33,587 --> 01:12:37,809
The emergence of a heretofore
suppressed sibling rivalry?

1525
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:40,809
Will you run that by me
in plain English, please?

1526
01:12:40,883 --> 01:12:43,501
Does your family favor
your son over your daughter?

1527
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:45,959
Ape Face?
No, he's just a kid.

1528
01:12:46,035 --> 01:12:49,810
Well, she's obviously
rebelling at something.

1529
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:53,356
I think she just wants to do
her own thing, that's it.

1530
01:12:53,426 --> 01:12:55,630
Naturally, that's
the normal teenage...

1531
01:12:55,698 --> 01:12:57,160
Could it possibly be you?

1532
01:12:57,235 --> 01:12:59,122
Are you an attentive mother?

1533
01:12:59,186 --> 01:13:01,009
Too darned attentive, I'd say.

1534
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:02,635
Are you understanding?

1535
01:13:02,707 --> 01:13:03,601
Never.

1536
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:04,911
Overdemanding?

1537
01:13:05,523 --> 01:13:06,450
You bet.

1538
01:13:06,514 --> 01:13:08,457
ANNABEL:
Hey, this is fun!

1539
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:10,897
With all due respect,
Mrs. Andrews,

1540
01:13:10,963 --> 01:13:13,712
do you consider yourself
an able parent?

1541
01:13:13,778 --> 01:13:14,672
Yeah.

1542
01:13:14,738 --> 01:13:16,713
I'm not number one
on the charts,

1543
01:13:16,787 --> 01:13:18,609
but I'd say I'm in the top ten.

1544
01:13:18,675 --> 01:13:21,163
You are loving to
your daughter, aren't you?

1545
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:23,788
Of course I am.
What kind of question is that?

1546
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:25,386
That's a dumb question.

1547
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:28,241
Yeah, what kind of
a dumb question is that?

1548
01:13:28,307 --> 01:13:32,365
This is going to be a little
more difficult than I...

1549
01:13:32,434 --> 01:13:36,591
Tell me, is there trouble
between you and your husband?

1550
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:39,081
Now, hold on, Charlie!

1551
01:13:39,154 --> 01:13:40,234
Charles, please.

1552
01:13:40,306 --> 01:13:42,543
Charles, this is
getting out of hand.

1553
01:13:42,611 --> 01:13:45,709
We're here to talk about grades,
not my father.

1554
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:49,040
Oh, ho ho! Mrs. Andrews.
Did you hear what you said?

1555
01:13:49,106 --> 01:13:51,495
Yes, I called my husband
my father.

1556
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:52,715
Big deal!

1557
01:13:52,786 --> 01:13:54,193
Revealing, don't you think?

1558
01:13:54,258 --> 01:13:56,430
I think you have
an awful lot of nerve

1559
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:58,604
prying into people's
personal affairs.

1560
01:13:58,675 --> 01:14:00,104
Attaway to go, Mom.

1561
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:03,245
We're interested in getting at
the root of Annabel's problem.

1562
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:04,525
She needs help.

1563
01:14:04,595 --> 01:14:07,344
And she's not the only one.

1564
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:10,128
Besides, I think
she just got that help.

1565
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,307
Come Monday morning,

1566
01:14:11,378 --> 01:14:13,745
you're going to see
a brand-new Annabel.

1567
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:16,265
We mustn't expect her
to change just like that.

1568
01:14:16,338 --> 01:14:19,950
Stranger things have happened,
McGuirk.

1569
01:14:20,018 --> 01:14:20,912
[Sizzling]

1570
01:14:20,978 --> 01:14:22,702
BEN: You think
we ought to turn it off?

1571
01:14:22,771 --> 01:14:24,745
Sounds like it's gonna explode!

1572
01:14:24,818 --> 01:14:26,825
Your mother said
not to touch it.

1573
01:14:26,898 --> 01:14:28,360
Now what happens?

1574
01:14:28,435 --> 01:14:31,730
The chocolate gets blended
with the egg whites and brandy.

1575
01:14:31,794 --> 01:14:32,842
I'll do it!

1576
01:14:32,914 --> 01:14:33,863
No!

1577
01:14:34,834 --> 01:14:36,361
Turn it off!

1578
01:14:38,835 --> 01:14:41,006
Creep!

1579
01:14:41,075 --> 01:14:43,496
Oh, man! Now I gotta
start all over again.

1580
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:44,464
Sorry!

1581
01:14:45,907 --> 01:14:47,313
Hey, that's kinda good.

1582
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:50,224
Boris, look!

1583
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,941
Yeah, yeah, I see you're a mess.

1584
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,570
Come on.
You need a bath.

1585
01:14:54,642 --> 01:14:55,536
But, Boris...

1586
01:14:55,602 --> 01:14:56,530
Come on!

1587
01:14:59,315 --> 01:15:00,744
Hi, guys.

1588
01:15:00,819 --> 01:15:03,120
Ape Face. Ape Face.

1589
01:15:03,187 --> 01:15:05,041
It's nice to see you
looking dirty.

1590
01:15:05,107 --> 01:15:06,568
Making mud pies?

1591
01:15:06,643 --> 01:15:07,887
- Mousse pies.
- Yeah?

1592
01:15:08,563 --> 01:15:09,675
It blew up by mistake.

1593
01:15:09,746 --> 01:15:11,153
Blew up?
You're joking.

1594
01:15:11,218 --> 01:15:12,462
The turkey's about to...

1595
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:13,479
That's enough, Max.

1596
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:15,922
Let the chocolate soldier
go get washed up.

1597
01:15:15,987 --> 01:15:17,165
Ooh, great.

1598
01:15:17,235 --> 01:15:18,544
Come on, you two.

1599
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:21,742
You clean up the walls.
You clean up the body.

1600
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:22,704
To the showers.

1601
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,232
Go, go to the showers.

1602
01:15:24,306 --> 01:15:26,379
You to the kitchen.

1603
01:15:26,451 --> 01:15:27,912
What's that smell?

1604
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:33,007
Oh, no.

1605
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:35,661
Open a window,
if you can find it.

1606
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:38,152
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, a vent.

1607
01:15:38,227 --> 01:15:40,169
I can't breathe.

1608
01:15:47,571 --> 01:15:50,866
Exploded mousse
and burnt turkey!

1609
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:52,938
Boris, how could you
do this to me?

1610
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:55,018
- Sorry.
- [Telephone ringing]

1611
01:15:55,091 --> 01:15:57,295
What now?
Get myself together.

1612
01:15:57,363 --> 01:15:58,508
Just pretend.

1613
01:15:58,579 --> 01:15:59,473
Hello?

1614
01:15:59,539 --> 01:16:01,164
[Coughs] Yes?

1615
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:04,082
Ellen, where are you?!
Where's the food?!

1616
01:16:04,147 --> 01:16:06,929
Right here.
It's all around me, actually.

1617
01:16:06,994 --> 01:16:09,067
Where's Annabel?
I need her help now.

1618
01:16:09,139 --> 01:16:11,822
She's getting ready
for the aquacade.

1619
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:13,865
What?
She's going to water-ski?

1620
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:15,084
She'll be killed!

1621
01:16:15,155 --> 01:16:18,155
She's one of the best
water-skiers in the state.

1622
01:16:18,227 --> 01:16:21,096
She may have been this morning,
but she isn't now.

1623
01:16:21,171 --> 01:16:22,993
You've got to stop her, Bill.

1624
01:16:23,058 --> 01:16:26,058
Honey, you just let me handle
this end of it, will you?

1625
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:27,886
You get down here
with that food!

1626
01:16:27,954 --> 01:16:29,481
Counting on you both.

1627
01:16:29,555 --> 01:16:31,889
But you're counting
on the wrong both!

1628
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:33,865
I want my Mommy!

1629
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:35,313
It's all right.

1630
01:16:35,378 --> 01:16:37,451
Let's make this
a creative enterprise.

1631
01:16:37,522 --> 01:16:40,206
Boris, let's start all over.
Forget this thing.

1632
01:16:40,275 --> 01:16:42,380
We have some Catty Kibble left,

1633
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:44,621
some green noodles,
Tabasco sauce.

1634
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:46,545
We'll make a New Orleans
casserole.

1635
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:48,715
We'll sprinkle
a little bread crumbs.

1636
01:16:48,786 --> 01:16:52,015
I think I have some olives.
It'll be wonderful.

1637
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:53,708
Parsley!

1638
01:16:53,778 --> 01:16:55,753
Let's get going, Boris.

1639
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:21,390
Come on, Annabel.
Get your skis on.

1640
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:23,367
I'm not going through
with it, Bill.

1641
01:17:23,442 --> 01:17:26,093
Don't start that.
I've been bragging for weeks.

1642
01:17:26,162 --> 01:17:27,340
Don't let me down now.

1643
01:17:27,411 --> 01:17:29,615
I'm not the same person
you think I am.

1644
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:33,512
You sound just like your mother.
Let's get into your skis.

1645
01:17:33,586 --> 01:17:35,561
You don't care whether
I live or die.

1646
01:17:35,635 --> 01:17:37,577
We'll talk about that
after the aquacade.

1647
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:39,985
I'll help you.
Come on, into the skis.

1648
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:41,097
There we are.

1649
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:42,763
First the foot.

1650
01:17:43,635 --> 01:17:45,610
Have we got everything?

1651
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:47,111
Where's the turkey?!

1652
01:17:47,186 --> 01:17:48,713
You're gonna eat that thing?

1653
01:17:48,787 --> 01:17:51,787
You ever heard of smoked turkey?
Go get it, tiger!

1654
01:17:51,859 --> 01:17:54,793
Listen, Boris.
I haven't got much time.

1655
01:17:54,866 --> 01:17:57,452
There are a few kooky things
you should know.

1656
01:17:57,523 --> 01:18:00,240
Try and understand.
I need your help desperately.

1657
01:18:00,307 --> 01:18:01,201
You name it.

1658
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:03,089
Well, to begin with,

1659
01:18:03,154 --> 01:18:06,667
I know it's hard to believe,
but I don't know how to drive.

1660
01:18:06,738 --> 01:18:08,560
You're right.
I don't believe you.

1661
01:18:08,626 --> 01:18:10,536
Do you drive, Boris?

1662
01:18:10,611 --> 01:18:13,360
Kinda, but I don't got a
license. I can get arrested.

1663
01:18:13,426 --> 01:18:16,329
It's better than getting killed.
I can't drive.

1664
01:18:16,402 --> 01:18:18,824
I'm only 13 years old.

1665
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:21,484
Oh, sure, and I'm only 38.

1666
01:18:21,554 --> 01:18:23,659
Please, Boris,
don't you believe me?

1667
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:24,875
I'm not my mother.

1668
01:18:24,946 --> 01:18:28,459
I'm Annabel Andrews
in my mother's body.

1669
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:31,116
You understand?
Don't ask me how it happened.

1670
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:32,844
You don't believe me, do you?!

1671
01:18:32,914 --> 01:18:34,223
I think you're crazy.

1672
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:37,771
Boris, I can't argue that.
Not in the very least.

1673
01:18:37,843 --> 01:18:39,053
I am a fruitcake.

1674
01:18:39,122 --> 01:18:41,391
But what kind of
irresponsible person are you

1675
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,630
to let me, a fruitcake,
drive a car?

1676
01:18:43,699 --> 01:18:44,713
I might get killed.

1677
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:45,801
Don't you care?

1678
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:47,533
Well, yeah, I care.

1679
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:48,847
All right.

1680
01:18:48,915 --> 01:18:52,712
If you care, get into this car
and drive me to the marina

1681
01:18:52,786 --> 01:18:56,234
so I can save my Dad's neck
and my Mommy's life.

1682
01:18:56,306 --> 01:18:57,899
I don't care that much.

1683
01:18:57,970 --> 01:18:59,628
Boris, buzz off.

1684
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:01,608
Go ahead! Go away.
Who needs you?

1685
01:19:01,682 --> 01:19:03,690
I got the turkey, Mom!
Let's go!

1686
01:19:03,763 --> 01:19:06,184
Wait a minute! 'Cause I
don't want to go to jail

1687
01:19:06,258 --> 01:19:07,949
doesn't mean I don't
want to help.

1688
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:08,912
Creep, get in.

1689
01:19:10,066 --> 01:19:12,750
Onward and upward!

1690
01:19:36,978 --> 01:19:38,985
Listen, let me put it this way.

1691
01:19:39,058 --> 01:19:41,033
Number one,

1692
01:19:41,107 --> 01:19:43,343
I'm not gonna make
a fool out of myself,

1693
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:44,839
let alone break every bone.

1694
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:46,670
Annabel, you can't
do this to me.

1695
01:19:46,738 --> 01:19:48,560
My job may depend on this deal.

1696
01:19:48,627 --> 01:19:51,245
I'm sorry.
But I just can't do it.

1697
01:19:51,315 --> 01:19:53,486
Okay, okay, I give up.

1698
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:55,725
Here, sit down.
We'll talk about it.

1699
01:19:55,794 --> 01:19:57,736
Here, hold this.

1700
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:59,818
Hit it, Charlie!

1701
01:20:02,706 --> 01:20:04,332
I'm sorry, honey!

1702
01:20:04,403 --> 01:20:06,824
I had to do it!

1703
01:20:06,898 --> 01:20:10,640
ELLEN:
Bill, you dirty louse!

1704
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:16,047
Oh! Help!

1705
01:20:19,058 --> 01:20:21,425
- Which way do I turn here, left?
- Right.

1706
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:22,734
- Right?
- No, left.

1707
01:20:22,802 --> 01:20:23,696
- Left?
- Right.

1708
01:20:23,762 --> 01:20:25,169
- Right?
- Left's that way.

1709
01:20:37,139 --> 01:20:38,415
Uh-oh.

1710
01:20:38,482 --> 01:20:40,871
Hey, I think we got company.

1711
01:20:51,698 --> 01:20:54,381
I wish I had my own body back!

1712
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,141
[Mysterious music plays]

1713
01:20:58,515 --> 01:21:02,126
Right body, wrong place!

1714
01:21:02,194 --> 01:21:03,950
Annabel, where'd you come from?

1715
01:21:04,019 --> 01:21:05,742
- Where did Mom go?
- Don't ask me.

1716
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:07,337
How'd you do that?

1717
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:09,995
- Could you do it again?
- I hope not.

1718
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:27,025
Wait, wait, wait!

1719
01:21:34,706 --> 01:21:36,942
Andrews, isn't that
your wife out there?

1720
01:21:37,011 --> 01:21:37,904
Yeah. What?

1721
01:21:39,986 --> 01:21:42,474
Yes, sir, yeah.
I believe it is.

1722
01:21:43,346 --> 01:21:45,069
What is she doing out there?

1723
01:21:45,138 --> 01:21:47,113
What? Well...

1724
01:21:47,186 --> 01:21:49,390
It's a mother-and-daughter
act, Jennings.

1725
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:50,865
Yeah, that's it.

1726
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:53,745
That's exactly it.
[Laughs]

1727
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,468
Where's the daughter?

1728
01:21:55,538 --> 01:21:57,327
Huh?

1729
01:21:57,394 --> 01:21:59,598
Hey, Annabel,
what are you doing?

1730
01:22:02,098 --> 01:22:04,749
Why don't you stop
before somebody gets killed?!

1731
01:22:04,818 --> 01:22:05,963
Mom needs us.

1732
01:22:06,034 --> 01:22:08,423
And if I'm here,
she's worse off than we are.

1733
01:22:08,498 --> 01:22:10,440
I find that hard to believe.

1734
01:22:45,714 --> 01:22:48,943
Oh, oh, oh!
Whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo!

1735
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,908
Hey, what are you doing?

1736
01:23:04,978 --> 01:23:06,156
No!

1737
01:23:08,466 --> 01:23:09,961
Hey, where'd everybody go?

1738
01:23:10,035 --> 01:23:11,344
Coming through.

1739
01:23:11,442 --> 01:23:12,522
No, no, right.

1740
01:23:12,563 --> 01:23:14,351
- No, the other way.
- No!

1741
01:23:15,762 --> 01:23:17,769
BORIS:
Look out, Mister!

1742
01:23:17,842 --> 01:23:19,435
Look out, everybody!

1743
01:23:29,266 --> 01:23:32,649
Get your mitts off the wheel.
Take this thing off my head.

1744
01:23:42,738 --> 01:23:44,843
- They're getting closer!
- More of them!

1745
01:23:44,914 --> 01:23:46,124
Yeah, I see 'em.

1746
01:23:49,746 --> 01:23:50,892
Whoa, whoa!

1747
01:23:50,963 --> 01:23:52,588
Whatcha doing?

1748
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:54,032
Wait a minute!

1749
01:23:54,098 --> 01:23:57,131
Hold it!
No, no, no!

1750
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:00,519
Why aren't you driving the boat?

1751
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:15,214
She's amazing, Andrews.

1752
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:17,616
Why didn't you tell us
about her?

1753
01:24:17,682 --> 01:24:19,722
Well, I want it to be
a surprise, sir.

1754
01:24:19,794 --> 01:24:22,347
Well, it sure is to me.

1755
01:24:22,418 --> 01:24:23,880
That makes two of us.

1756
01:24:23,954 --> 01:24:25,034
Three of us.

1757
01:24:25,106 --> 01:24:26,317

1758
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:35,822
Good show!

1759
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:37,613
Would have been better at night.

1760

Nonsense.
You had it planned that way.

1761
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:41,872
Yes, I did.

01:24:41,938 --> 01:24:43,367
What's next?
What's next?

1763
01:24:43,442 --> 01:24:48,112
Well, I think the
next trick's out there

1764
01:24:48,178 --> 01:24:49,585
somewhere in the water.

1765
01:25:14,706 --> 01:25:16,048
Road hog!

1766
01:25:16,114 --> 01:25:18,602
Neat wheelie, Mrs. Schmauss!
Don't lose it!

1767

Stop this thing!
I want to get off!

Excuse me!

Pardon me!

Oh, no! No! No!

1774
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,635
- Pardon me, young man.
- Whoa!

1775
01:26:38,706 --> 01:26:40,048
Can you help me, please?

1776
01:26:40,114 --> 01:26:42,187
Watch out, lady.
What are you doing?

1777
01:26:42,258 --> 01:26:44,429
Let go of me!

1778
01:26:44,498 --> 01:26:45,643
C'est bizarre!

Don't take your eyes
off him, folks.

1783
01:28:44,881 --> 01:28:46,769
He's the daredevil of Bay City.

1784

I believe you've got
your sexes mixed up.

1785

Beg pardon?

1786
01:28:50,129 --> 01:28:51,984
It's not a he.

It's not a he.
She's my wife!

1788

She's up in the air!
She's on a kite!

1789
01:28:58,162 --> 01:29:00,267
She's so young!

1790
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,985
Ellen!

1791
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:05,806
Honey!

1792

Don't "honey" me!

1793
01:29:21,298 --> 01:29:23,949
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the kiteflyer.

Look out!

Really gross!

Uh-oh!

1798
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:56,783
Yippee!

1799
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,224
Stop!

1800
01:29:59,634 --> 01:30:03,016
Quick, Annabel.
Put it in reverse!

1801
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:13,319

- Mom?

I thought you were gonna
wipe out.

1805
01:30:31,122 --> 01:30:31,951
So did I.

1806
01:30:32,018 --> 01:30:33,708
It's nice to know
you care, my darling.

1807
01:30:33,778 --> 01:30:35,054
It's nice to know I do.

1808
01:30:35,122 --> 01:30:36,202
Believe me, I do.

1809
01:30:36,274 --> 01:30:38,216
Oh, Mom, I really love you.

1810
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:39,817
I love you, too, darling.

1811
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:42,672
Hey, Mom, can I take
driving lessons from Annabel?

1812
01:30:43,634 --> 01:30:45,227
Not on my street, you're not.

1813
01:30:45,298 --> 01:30:46,639
We'll see, Benji.

1814
01:30:46,705 --> 01:30:49,771
Right now, I'm so glad
to be me again.

1815
01:30:49,841 --> 01:30:51,696
Hey, right on, Mom.

1816
01:30:51,794 --> 01:30:53,354
How do you like yourself?

1817
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:54,288
I don't know.

1818
01:30:54,354 --> 01:30:56,721
Annabel, about your hair.

1819
01:30:56,786 --> 01:30:58,957
They only took off
an inch and a half.

1820
01:30:59,025 --> 01:31:02,025
I bought you a new outfit.
You don't have to wear it.

1821
01:31:02,098 --> 01:31:04,520
Your teeth.
Don't you like your new teeth?

1822
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:05,968
Not the way I look.

1823
01:31:06,034 --> 01:31:08,685
I was talking about
the way I am.

1824
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:11,023
I am so much smarter
than I thought.

1825
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:12,464
And so much dumber.

1826
01:31:12,529 --> 01:31:16,272
Oh, my darling, aren't we all?

1827
01:31:16,338 --> 01:31:18,705
Oh, Annabel.

1828
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,297
Your family is
a bunch of comedians.

1829
01:31:24,370 --> 01:31:27,239
That's one of the funniest
shows I have ever seen.

1830
01:31:27,314 --> 01:31:30,031
Yeah.
I guess it was, wasn't it?

1831
01:31:30,097 --> 01:31:31,079
You bet it was.

1832
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,182
No way to top it.
Right, Jennings?

1833
01:31:35,249 --> 01:31:38,315
I think we should have held out
for professional...

[Laughter]

1835
01:31:45,394 --> 01:31:47,761
That doesn't quite
explain it for me, Ellen.

1836
01:31:47,826 --> 01:31:50,509
I don't quite understand
how you got on the kite.

1837
01:31:50,609 --> 01:31:53,576
Darling, all's well
that ends well.

1838
01:31:53,618 --> 01:31:55,952
Yeah, but that doesn't...

01:31:56,017 --> 01:31:58,122
- You look great, Annabel.
- Thanks.

1840
01:31:58,193 --> 01:32:01,292
Yeah, you're not the same way
you used to be at all.

1841
01:32:01,362 --> 01:32:02,442
Is that good or bad?

1842
01:32:02,514 --> 01:32:04,040
Well, no.
What I mean is,

1843
01:32:04,113 --> 01:32:06,480
you're a completely
different person.

1844
01:32:06,545 --> 01:32:09,644
Well, maybe not completely yet,
but I'm working on it.

Stew, stew, stew.

1846
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,679
You're being less
than direct with me.

1847
01:32:13,746 --> 01:32:15,818
I'm a little worried
about your mom.

1848
01:32:15,889 --> 01:32:17,712
She's acting kind of weird.

1849

You don't think she's what they
call a bad seed, do you?

1850
01:32:21,393 --> 01:32:23,401
Well, I think
you'll be noticing

some changes in her, too.

Sure.
That's very nice.

on my Japanese motorcycle campaign.
