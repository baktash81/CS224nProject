1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,154
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phoney emotions.

2
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,319
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,640
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit. -

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,435
- There's nothing fake
about Truman himself.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,518
No scripts, no cue cards.

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,953
It isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine. It's a life.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,315
I'm not gonna make it. You're
gonna have to go on without me.

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,469
No way, mister.

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,389
You're going to the top of
this mountain, broken legs and all.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,716
Many viewers
leave him on all night, for comfort.

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,356
You're crazy, you know that?

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,872
For me there's no difference between
private life and public life.

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,234
My life is The Truman Show.
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,788
It's a noble life.
It is... a truly blessed life.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,595
Tell me something I don't know.

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,315
All right.
Promise me one thing, though.

17
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,390
If I die before the summit, use me
as an alternative source of food.

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,556
You're gross.

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,195
It's all real.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,474
Nothing you see on the show is fake.
It's merely controlled.

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,676
THE TRUMAN SHOW

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,152
Eat me, dammit. That's an order.

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,712
Maybe just your love handles.

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,515
I have love handles?
Yeah, little ones.

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,077
- Truman, you're gonna be late.
- Okay!

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,717
DAY 10,909

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,310
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

28
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,674
And in case I don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,835
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer. Hey, Pluto.

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,272
- He won't hurt you.
- I know. It's just me.

31
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,074
Come on, Pluto.

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,519
What is it?

33
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,109
An aircraft began shedding parts
as it flew over Sea haven -

34
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,108
- A few moments ago.
Luckily, no one was hurt.

35
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,392
How do you feel today...?
That's good.

36
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,717
- Thinking of flying somewhere?
- Nope.

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,630
This is classical Klyne.
Forget about the perils of flying -

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,037
- And let this music calm you down.

39
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,998
"Dog Fancy', please.
Thank you very much.

40
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,478
Get me a paper, will you, Errol?

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,992
And one of these for the wife.
Loves her fashion mags.

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,352
- That be all for you, Truman?
- That's the whole kit and caboodle.

43
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,913
- Hank!
- Good morning, Truman.

44
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,319
Good morning, Truman.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

45
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,830
- Hows your lovely wife?
- Good. Yours?

46
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,838
Couldn't be better.

47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,397
- Nice talking to you.
- You too. Think about that policy.

48
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,639
Two for one. That's a good deal.
Doppelganger special.

49
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,035
Hey, fellas.
Going in? Go ahead.

50
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,756
- Go ahead.
- I'm not that anxious to get there.

51
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,755
Could I have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji Islands.

52
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,838
Truman, did you see this?

53
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,270
I'm sorry, ma'am. If he's in a coma
he's probably uninsurable.

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,152
Yes, Fiji. Do you have a listing
for Lauren Garland?

55
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,235
Nothing listed...

56
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,514
Do you have a Sylvia Garland?
S for Sylvia.

57
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,912
Nothing...
Okay, thank you.

58
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,952
- Lawrence.
- I've got a prospect in Wells Park.

59
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,794
Wells Park?
On... Harbour Island?

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,199
- You know another one?
- I can't. I have an appointment.

61
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,550
Dentist, or... yeah.

62
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,636
You'll lose more than your teeth
if you don't meet your quota.

63
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,197
Theyre making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

64
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,350
You need this. Besides, a half hour
across the bay will do you good.

65
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,596
Thanks.

66
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,436
Hello. Ferry’s still here, huh?
Thought I might have missed it.

67
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,599
- One way or return?
- Return.

68
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,871
There you go, sir.

69
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,394
- Do you need any help, sir?
- You go ahead, I'll be fine.

70
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,274
Hi, honey.

71
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,156
Look what I got free at
the checkout. It's a "Chef’s Pal".

72
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,070
It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in
one. No sharpening, dishwater-safe.

73
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,875
Wow... that's amazing.

74
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,313
Truman... you missed a spot.

75
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,991
That is a beer.

76
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,238
- I'm thinking about getting out.
- Yeah? Out of what?

77
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,479
Out of my job. Out of Sea haven.
Off this island. Out.

78
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,118
What the hell's wrong with your job?
You've got a great job. A desk job.

79
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,551
I'd kill for a desk job.

80
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,036
You should try stocking vending
machines. Now there's excitement.

81
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,360
- Don't you ever get antsy?
- Where's there to go?

82
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,395
- Fiji.
- Where's Fiji? Near Florida?

83
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,158
See here? This is us...

84
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,797
And all the way
around here... Fiji.

85
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,596
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

86
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,830
There's still islands in Fiji where
no human being has ever set foot.

87
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,799
So when are you gonna go?

88
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,992
It's not that simple.

89
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,113
It takes money, planning...

90
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,916
- You can't just up and go.
- Right.

91
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,635
I'm gonna do it,
don't worry about that.

92
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,516
Bonus time
is just around the corner.

93
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,309
- Are you coming for a drink?
- No, I can't tonight.

94
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,475
I don't like that weather, son.
We should head back.

95
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,638
Just a bit farther. Please?

96
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,673
- Okay.
- Yes!

97
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,789
Daddy!

98
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,112
You're soaked.
Where have you been?

99
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,393
- We can scrape together 8,000...
- You and Marlon...

100
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,276
- We can bum around the world.
- And then what?

101
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,996
- You're talking like a teenager.
- Maybe I feel like a teenager.

102
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:08,878
We have mortgage payments. Do we
just walk away from our obligations?

103
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,915
- It would be an adventure.
- We were going to try for a baby.

104
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,238
- Isn't that enough of an adventure?
- That can wait.

105
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,116
I want to get away.
See some of the world. Explore!

106
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,756
You want to be an explorer...

107
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,556
This will pass.
We all think like this now and then.

108
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,158
Let's get you out
of these wet clothes. Come to bed.

109
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,833
You never see anything. They always
turn the camera and play music.

110
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,033
The wind blows, the curtain moves.
You don't see anything.

111
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,792
"Dog Fancy', please.
Thank you.

112
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,959
Paper, Earl, please.

113
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,118
I might as well get one of these.

114
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,915
- For the wife?
- She's got to have them.

115
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,511
- Anything else, Truman?
- That's the whole ball of wax.

116
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,914
Dad?

117
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,276
Hey, what are you doing?

118
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,597
Get out of the way!

119
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,711
Stop those people!
Stop! Stop!

120
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,516
Open the door! Somebody
stop the bus! Stop the bus!

121
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,669
Somebody stop it!
Stop the bus!

122
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,198
It doesn't sound insane at all.

123
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,870
I see him ten times a week.

124
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,834
I almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon...

125
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,476
It was Dad.
Dressed like a homeless man.

126
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,869
And a businessman and a lady
with a dog forced him onto a bus.

127
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,108
It's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown.

128
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,596
They never found Dad's body.

129
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,875
If it wasn't him, it was his twin!
Did Dad have a brother?

130
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,029
You know perfectly well
that your father was an only child.

131
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,516
Just like you.

132
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,790
Sweetie... You're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

133
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,992
You sailing off into that storm...

134
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,314
But I've never blamed you.
And I don't blame you now.

135
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,948
Truman...?

136
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,870
What are you doing down here?

137
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,197
Fixing the mower.

138
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,109
- I saw my father today.
- I know.

139
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,312
Your mother called.

140
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,193
You shouldn't upset her like that.

141
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,269
- What did you want?
- I made macaroni.

142
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,517
- I'm not hungry.
- You know...

143
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,030
We ought to throw out that mower.

144
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,631
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

145
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,790
What's he doing?

146
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,152
They got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

147
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,511
10,910
NUMBER OF DAYS RUNNING

148
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,874
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me. Sorry I fell on you.

149
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,518
I've been such a klutz all day.
I must have sprained this ankle.

150
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,475
- I'm so sorry to fall on you.
- Don't worry about it.

151
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,958
- I'm Meryl.
- Hi, I'm Truman.

152
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,112
- Truman, you've studied enough.
- I've got to commit this to memory.

153
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,551
Come on, an ice-cold brew sky.

154
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,514
You're gonna have to copy off me,
so be careful.

155
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,508
You're a better person than I am.

156
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,712
- See you later.
- Bye.

157
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,673
See you later, loser.

158
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,519
Hi.

159
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,037
- Konnichi-wa.
- What?

160
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,756
- You take Japanese.
- Oh, yes...

161
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,829
Lauren, right?

162
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,113
- It's on the...
- Lauren, right.

163
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,519
- I'm Truman Burbank.
- Yeah, I know.

164
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,510
- I'm not allowed to talk to you.
- Really?

165
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,879
- I'm a pretty dangerous character.
- I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

166
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,598
Girls have got to be careful.

167
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,190
- You have a boyfriend, right?
- It's not that.

168
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,315
Was it Meryl, the girl I was with?
We're not... We're just friends.

169
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,399
- It's nothing like that.
- It's how I look? Not your type?

170
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,674
No.

171
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,757
HOW'S IT GOING TO END?

172
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,475
I was wondering that myself.

173
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,676
Would you maybe, possibly
sometime go out for some pizza?

174
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,668
- Like, Friday? Saturday?
- I can't.

175
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,440
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

176
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,676
NOW

177
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,715
- We have finals tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

178
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,710
If we don't go now,
it won't happen. Do you understand?

179
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,390
So what do you want to do?

180
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,672
Please keep your hands
inside the car!

181
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,477
This is my favorite pizza place.
Tony, one large, extra plankton!

182
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,753
We have so little time.
Theyll be here any minute.

183
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,795
- They don't want me talking to you.
- Then don't talk.

184
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,400
Theyre here.

185
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,354
- What do they want?
- Listen to me.

186
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,634
Everybody knows everything you do.
Theyre pretending. Understand?

187
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,278
- My name's not Lauren, it's Sylvia.
- Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

188
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,472
- Who are you?
- Her father.

189
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,719
I've never seen him before.
Truman, don't listen to him.

190
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,469
Everything I've told you
is the truth.

191
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,754
It's fake. It's all for you. The sky
and the sea. Everything is a set!

192
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,829
Please, don't listen to him.
He's gonna lie to you.

193
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,670
- I want to know what's going on.
- Schizophrenia. We've tried it all.

194
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,273
Hypnotism, shock therapy...
Don't worry, you're not the first.

195
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,076
- She brings all her boys down here.
- Truman, he's lying!

196
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,953
Get out of here. Come and find me.

197
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,870
- I'll see you in school.
- We're moving to Fiji.

198
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,756
Sylvia! Hey!

199
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,189
- Why didn't he just follow her?
- His mother got really sick.

200
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,473
He couldn't leave her.
He's kind. Maybe he's too kind.

201
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,559
I can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

202
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,880
Come on, Sal. We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

203
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,990
HOW'S IT GOING TO END?

204
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,789
Close, but no cigar.

205
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,470
Another beautiful day in paradise.
But don't forget to buckle up.

206
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,793
He's heading west on Stuart.
Stand by, all extras.

207
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,436
He's turning onto Lancaster Square.

208
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,032
My God, he nearly hither! Something
is wrong. Change frequencies.

209
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,633
Sorry about that, folks. I guess
we picked up a police frequency.

210
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,437
It's classical Klyne, and we've
still got some great music ahead.

211
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,668
But buckle up. Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.

212
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,237
CRACKDOWN ON HOMELESS
City Fathers: "Enough is Enough"

213
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,518
- Can I help?
- I have an appointment.

214
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,118
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

215
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,074
- Just tell me what's happening.
- We're remodeling.

216
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,875
- It's none of your business.
- Tell me, or I'll report you!

217
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,753
You're trespassing.

218
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,835
- Marlon!
- Truman, what are you doing here?

219
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,114
I've got to talk to you.
I'm on to something big!

220
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,029
- You look like shit.
- I think I'm mixed up in something.

221
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,631
A lot of strange things
have been happening.

222
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,279
The people on the elevator,
there was no backing on it...

223
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,112
And the radio starts following me,
talking about everything I'm doing.

224
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,836
- This is one of your fantasies.
- I think this is about my dad.

225
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,478
I think he's alive. I'll tell you
about it later. I'm being followed.

226
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,433
Who?

227
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,349
It's hard to tell.
They look like regular people.

228
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,315
- How about those two?
- Could be.

229
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,833
It's when I'm unpredictable.
That's when they can't...

230
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,749
Anything happen...?
We have to get out of here.

231
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,952
- You ready to go?
- I can't.

232
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,550
- You're gonna get us both fired.
- Okay then, let's do it.

233
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,312
Whatever you say, I'm game.
Your birthday comes but once a year!

234
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,477
Maybe I'm being set up
for something.

235
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,117
You ever think that your whole life
has been building toward something?

236
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,709
No.

237
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,600
When you were hauling chickens,
how far did you get off the island?

238
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,157
I went all over. Never found
a place like this, though.

239
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,035
Look at that sunset. It's perfect.

240
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,236
That's the big guy.
Quite a paintbrush he's got.

241
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,710
Just between you and me, Marlon...

242
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,596
- I'm going away for a while.
- Really?

243
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,029
My little clown...
Old carrot-top.

244
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,228
The best photos...

245
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,877
- We should be getting you home.
- Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

246
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:57,269
Do you remember, Truman?
You slept the whole way there.

247
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,996
- It looks so small.
- Things do, when you look back.

248
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,512
Look, Truman.
The happiest day of our lives.

249
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,396
- Look! Jean, Jodie, Joanne...
- Doesn't she look beautiful?

250
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,354
Well, she still does.

251
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,874
There's room for baby photos. I want
to hold a grandchild before I go.

252
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,119
We really should get you home.
No, you stay. Relax.

253
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,758
- Your favorite show is coming on.
- And we have something to discuss.

254
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,397
- A certain person's birthday.
- Oh, I see.

255
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,948
There’ll be another "Lucy" tomorrow.
Now it's time for Golden Oldies.

256
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,836
Tonight we present the classic:
"Show Me the Way to Go Home".

257
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,433
You don’t have to leave home to
discover what the world is about.

258
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,428
We learn that no one is poor
who has friends.

259
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:04,557
Full of laughter, love, pain,
sadness, but ultimately, redemption.

260
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,552
The cherry scene will have you
split ting your sides with laughter.

261
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,356
There’ll be tears, too, when
David and Jennifer are reunited.

262
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,553
Let’s join the Abbots
in Camden Village.

263
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,028
Thank you, Sweetie.

264
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,719
I need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

265
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,835
- I'd love to, but I'm really late.
- What's your rush?

266
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,431
There was that elevator disaster.
It was on the news.

267
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,033
The cable just snapped.
The elevator plummeted ten flights.

268
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,598
Right next door to where you work.
What if you had been in there?

269
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,828
Anyway, I have an amputation on
one of the women from the elevator.

270
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,192
She's very young. It's sad.
Wish me luck.

271
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,359
I'll cross my fingers for you.

272
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,591
Excuse me. May I help you?

273
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,032
I'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. It's very important.

274
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,550
That's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

275
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,517
Sure... Okay, fine.
Can you pass along a message?

276
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,235
I had to go to Fiji.
I'll call when I get there.

277
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,637
- When you get to Fiji?
- You got it.

278
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,071
- Fine. I'll tell her.
- Thank you so much.

279
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,069
Sorry.

280
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,793
Let me help you with that.

281
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,279
He's here.

282
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,075
Scalpel.

283
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,519
I'm now making
my primary incision. -

284
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,156
- Just above the right knee.

285
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,988
- Nicely done.
- Unless you're family...

286
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,594
- It's just a beautiful job.
- I'll let someone else tidy up.

287
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,953
TRAVELLERS BEWARE

288
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,359
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!

289
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,956
- I'm sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

290
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,109
- How can I help?
- I'd like a flight to Fiji.

291
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,279
- When would you like to leave?
- Today.

292
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,036
I'm sorry. I don't have anything
for at least a month.

293
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,915
It's the busy season.

294
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,078
Do you want to book the flight?

295
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,397
I'll make other arrangements.

296
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,309
Last call for Chicago!
All aboard!

297
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,911
Thank you.

298
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,596
Windy City, here we come.

299
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,189
Hi!

300
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,790
Hello...

301
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,994
- Mom, isn't that you know you?
- Face the front.

302
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,117
Everybody off, we've got a problem.

303
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,317
I'm sorry, son.

304
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,910
- Wasn't his father from Chicago?
- His father was from Des Moines.

305
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:47,150
- Why does he want to go to Chicago?
- He's not going anywhere.

306
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,398
Truman?

307
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,632
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get in.

308
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,637
- Truman...
- Look.

309
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:31,755
I predict that, in just a moment,
we'll see a lady on a red bike -

310
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,273
- Followed by a man with flowers and
a Volkswagen with a dented fender.

311
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,517
- Truman, please...
- Look!

312
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,635
Lady...

313
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,990
Flowers...

314
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,395
- And...?
- And...

315
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,840
- Truman, this is silly.
- There's the dented Beetle! Yes!

316
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,879
You know how I did that?
Theyre on a loop.

317
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,393
They go around the block, they
come back, they go around again.

318
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,912
- I invited Marlon to barbecue...
- I won't be here.

319
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,588
We need more charcoal.

320
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,237
Are you listening
to a word I'm saying?

321
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,035
You're upset
because you want to go to Fiji?

322
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,754
Okay, go.

323
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,037
I think you should save
for a few months, and then go.

324
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,834
I'm going to take a shower.

325
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,672
Let's go now.
I'm ready. Why wait?

326
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,476
Early bird gathers no moss,
rolling stone catches the worm.

327
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,275
Truman, what are you doing?

328
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,714
- Truman...
- Where shall we go?

329
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,471
- Truman, where are we going?
- I guess I'm being spontaneous.

330
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,992
Somebody help me!
I'm being spontaneous!

331
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,955
Forget Fiji.
We can't drive to Fiji, can we?

332
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,551
- What about Atlantic City.
- No, you hate to gamble.

333
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,753
That's right, I do.
But I never have.

334
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,872
And that's why people go places.

335
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,959
- I think I'm going to throw up.
- Me, too.

336
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,875
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully
synchronized, don't you think?

337
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,198
- You're blaming me for the traffic?
- Should I?

338
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,474
Truman, let's go home.

339
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,116
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

340
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,950
It'll be like this all the way
to Atlantic City. Let's go back.

341
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,119
I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.

342
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,278
- Can you please slow down?
- Yes, I can.

343
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,392
- That's our turn-off.
- I changed my mind.

344
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,752
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardis Gras!

345
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,557
Look, Meryl. Same road, no cars.
It's magic.

346
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,629
Let me out. If you want to
destroy yourself, do it on your own.

347
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,719
I think I'd like a little company.

348
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,876
Oh, Truman...
You knew this would happen.

349
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,231
You know you can't drive over water.

350
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,319
Let's go home,
where you'll feel safe.

351
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,710
Give me your hand...
You drive!

352
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,471
We shouldn't be doing this.
We're breaking the law!

353
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,037
- Oh, my!
- You can do it! You can make it!

354
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,308
We're over! We're over the bridge!

355
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,195
- We're over the bridge!
- We're over!

356
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,556
FOREST FIRE WARNING
EXTREME DANGER

357
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,435
- What about that sign?
- They exaggerate. We'll be fine.

358
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,993
Do you believe that?

359
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,232
Truman, we're on fire!

360
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,796
- It's just smoke. You okay?
- Yes.

361
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,958
- Wanna do it again?
- No!

362
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,674
Truman, stop!

363
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,354
What do we do for money
when we get to New Orleans?

364
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,472
I have my Sea haven bank card.

365
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,719
So we're just going to
eat into our savings, is that it?

366
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,040
I'll have to call your mother.
I don't know how she'll take this.

367
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,997
What now?

368
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,589
SEAHAVEN
NUCLEAR POWER STATION

369
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,190
- Looks like a leak at the plant.
- Back up.

370
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:53,839
Leak at the plant.
The whole area is being evacuated.

371
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,999
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome, Truman.

372
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,952
Truman...

373
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,557
Truman, come back!

374
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,755
Stop him!

375
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,235
Truman!

376
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,550
Stay away!

377
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,878
- Thank you both for your help.
- Next time he'll be charged.

378
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,631
I understand.
Thanks again. Good night.

379
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,431
Let me get you some help, Truman.
You're not well.

380
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:26,789
Why do you want to have a baby
with me? You can't stand me.

381
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,912
That's not true.

382
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:39,118
I'll fix you some Mococoa. Natural
cocoa beans from Mt. Nicaragua.

383
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:45,190
- No artificial sweeteners.
- What are you talking about?

384
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,870
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

385
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:53,198
What the hell does this
have to do with anything?

386
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,951
- Tell me what's happening!
- You're having a nervous breakdown.

387
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,913
You're part of this, aren't you?

388
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,716
Truman, you are scaring me.

389
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,549
No, you're scaring me.
What are you gonna do?

390
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,038
Dice me, slice me or peel me?
There's so many choices.

391
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,672
Do something!

392
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,509
What? What did you say?

393
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,315
- Who are you talking to?
- I didn't say anything.

394
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,355
- I wasn't talking to anybody.
- Talk to me!

395
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,111
- I don't know anything!
- Stay where you are.

396
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,276
Truman...?

397
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,914
Thank God!

398
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,469
How can anyone expect me to
carry on under these conditions?

399
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,353
It's unprofessional!

400
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,914
Everything's gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be fine.

401
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,953
I don't know what to think, Marlon.

402
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,719
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

403
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,590
It feels like the whole world
revolves around me.

404
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,918
That's a lot of world for one man.

405
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,911
Is it wishful thinking? Wishing
you'd made more out of yourself?

406
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:43,639
Who hasn't sat in the john and
had an imaginary interview on TV?

407
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,153
This is different.
Everybody seems to be in on it.

408
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,839
I've been your best friend
since we were seven.

409
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,160
We got through school by cheating
off each others test papers.

410
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,069
Jesus, they were identical.

411
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,590
But I always felt safe knowing that.

412
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,590
Because whatever the answer was,
we were right or wrong together.

413
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,712
I stayed up all night in your tent
so you could play North Pole.

414
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,957
And I got pneumonia.

415
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,310
Remember that?

416
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,080
You were out of school for a month.

417
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,119
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

418
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:49,109
Things haven't worked out for us
like we used to dream they would.

419
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,118
I know what that feeling's like.
Everything slipping away...

420
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,552
You don't want to believe it, so you
look for answers somewhere else.

421
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,309
But the point is, I'd gladly
walk in front of traffic for you.

422
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,756
But the point’s, I'd gladly
step in front of traffic for you.

423
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,157
And the last thing I'd ever do
is lie to you.

424
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:33,754
And the last thing that
I would ever do... is lie to you.

425
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,957
I mean, think about it.

426
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,393
If everybody is in on it...
I'd have to be in on it, too.

427
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,836
I'm not in on it, Truman,
because there is no "it".

428
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,958
- You were right about one thing.
- What's that?

429
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,595
The thing that started all this.

430
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,913
I found him for you, Truman.
That's why I came by tonight.

431
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,159
I'm sure he's got
quite a story to tell.

432
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,080
Go to him.

433
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,314
Easy on the fog.

434
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,598
Stand by, crane-cam...
Crane-cam.

435
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,957
Button-cam three.

436
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,558
I never stopped believing.

437
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,671
Go wide. Curb-cam eight.

438
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,474
My son.

439
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,389
- Move in for close-up?
- No, no...

440
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,238
Stay back.
Fade up music.

441
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,630
Now go for the close-up.

442
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,992
All those years wasted.
I’ll make it up to you, son.

443
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,951
I swear.

444
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,754
Dad...

445
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,831
Bravo!

446
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,918
Congratulations.

447
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:16,671
- Okay, quiet down. Concentrate.
- That was great television.

448
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,239
- Christ of, it was brilliant!
- It broke my heart.

449
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,713
Well done! Congratulations!

450
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,597
Truman drinks Mococoa,
world's finest cocoa beans -

451
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,633
- Grown on the upper slopes
of Mt. Nicaragua.

452
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,993
1. 7 billion were there
for his birth.

453
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,997
220 countries tuned in
for his first step.

454
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,159
The world stood still
for that stolen kiss.

455
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,353
And as he grew, so did the
technology. A human life. -

456
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,395
- Recorded on a network of
hidden cameras and broadcast live -

457
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,754
- 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
to an audience around the globe.

458
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,796
From Sea haven, enclosed in the
largest studio ever constructed. -

459
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,791
- One of only two man-made
structures visible from space. -

460
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,199
- Now in its 30th great year,
it's The Truman Show!

461
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:43,358
What a week! I was on
pins and needles the entire time.

462
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,279
I'm your host, Mike Michelson.

463
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,790
Welcome to True-Talk, our forum for
issues growing out of the show.

464
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,310
Tonight, something very special:

465
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,593
An exclusive interview
with the show's creator.

466
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:04,319
Let's go live to the 221stfloor
of the Omni-Cam Ecosphere.

467
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,069
There we'll find
the world's greatest tele-visionary.

468
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,115
The designer of the world within
a world that’s Sea haven: Christ of.

469
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:18,155
I'd like to thank you
for granting this interview.

470
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:23,593
We know your schedule is demanding,
and how you guard your privacy.

471
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,679
- This, sir, is indeed an honor.
- Don't mention it.

472
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,156
The catalyst
for the recent dramatic events -

473
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,071
- Has been Truman's father, Kirk,
and his attempt at in filtration.

474
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,274
This is not the first time someone
has tried to reach Truman, is it?

475
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,631
We have had our close calls.

476
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:51,234
It's television!
I did it! I'm on The Truman Show!

477
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:58,551
But now, the first intruder
to be a former cast member.

478
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,675
- A dead one at that.
- Writing Kirk back in, brilliant.

479
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:09,352
Kirk started this whole crisis. He
was the only one who could end it.

480
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,074
Truman, no!

481
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,795
- That's off limits!
- Why? What's over there?

482
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,278
Nothing. It's dangerous, that's all.
You have to know your limitations.

483
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,473
Let's remind viewers why Dad was
written outin' the first place.

484
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,435
As Truman grew up, we manufactured
ways to keep him on the island.

485
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:36,159
- I'd like to be a great explorer.
- There's nothing left to explore.

486
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,192
- Then I thought up Kirk's drowning.
- He's feared the water ever since.

487
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:52,794
When Kirk read the synopsis, he was
disappointed, to say the least.

488
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,117
I'm sure
that's why he broke onto the set.

489
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,677
But how do you intend to explain
his 22-year absence?

490
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,474
- Amnesia.
- Brilliant.

491
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:09,630
Let's take some viewer calls. North
Carolina, you're on with Christ of.

492
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,868
Hi, Christ of. I was wondering how
many cameras you got in that town.

493
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,392
Somewhere in the vicinity of5,000.

494
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,479
Remember, we started with just one.

495
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:29,835
He was two weeks premature, as if
he couldn't wait to get started.

496
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:34,875
And his eagerness to leave the womb
was the reason he was selected.

497
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,789
In competition with five other
unwanted pregnancies -

498
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,472
- For a show determined by an air
date, only Truman arrived on cue.

499
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,791
I believe Truman is the first child
to be adopted by a corporation.

500
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,879
- That's correct.
- The show's made enormous revenue.

501
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,117
Equivalent to the GNP
ofa small country.

502
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,438
It takes the population ofan
entire country to keep it running.

503
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:10,273
Since it's on 24 hours, revenues are
generated byproduct placement.

504
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,270
Everything on the show is for sale,
down to the very homes they live in.

505
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,439
All of tin the Truman catalogue.
Operators are standing by.

506
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:24,998
Christ of, why has Truman
never come close to discovering -

507
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,795
- The true nature of his world
until now?

508
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,834
We accept the reality of the world
with which we're presented.

509
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,152
The Hague for Christ of. Hello.
The Hague...

510
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,836
All right,
let's go to Hollywood, California.

511
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:48,637
You're a liar and a manipulator, and
what you've done to Truman is sick.

512
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:54,870
Well, we remember this voice,
don't we? How could we forget?

513
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,312
- Let's go to another call.
- No, no. It's fine, Mike.

514
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,832
I love to reminisce
with former members of the cast.

515
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:09,797
Sylvia, as you announced so
melodramatically to the world...

516
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,391
Do you think because you batted
your eyes at Truman once. -

517
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,673
- Flirted with him,
stole a few minutes of air time -

518
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,998
- To thrust your politics into
the limelight, that you know him?

519
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,910
That you know what's right for him?
Are you in a position to judge him?

520
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:32,796
What right do you have to
turn a baby’s life into a mockery?

521
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,879
Don't you ever feel guilty.

522
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:41,870
I have given Truman
the chance to lead a normal life.

523
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,868
The world, the place you live in. -

524
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,279
- Is the sick place. Sea haven
is the way the world should be.

525
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:56,474
- He's a prisoner, not a performer.
- He can leave at any time.

526
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:01,595
If his was more than a vague
ambition, if he was determined -

527
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,511
- To discover the truth, there's
no way we could prevent him.

528
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,998
I think what distresses you,
really, caller. -

529
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,832
- Is that, ultimately, Truman
prefers his cell, as you call it.

530
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:23,114
That's where you're so wrong.
And he'll prove you wrong.

531
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:29,475
These heated comments aside, it's
been a very positive experience.

532
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,434
For Truman and for the viewers.

533
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:39,715
Thank you for your time.
Now that this crisis is behind us. -

534
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,038
- Can we look forward
to some exciting new developments?

535
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:49,598
The big news is: Meryl will leave
Truman in an upcoming episode.

536
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,792
A new romantic interest
will be introduced.

537
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,357
I'm determined that TVs first
on-air conception will take place.

538
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:00,472
Another television milestone.

539
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:06,949
It has been a singular honor
and a pleasure. Christ of, thank you.

540
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,149
Hey, Simeon.

541
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,515
- Is he looking at us?
- You think he knows?

542
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,110
- Hello...
- Better call Christ of.

543
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,118
Come in, Major Burbank.

544
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,275
He's back to his old self.

545
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,635
That's an unusual cat, my man.

546
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,873
I hereby proclaim this planet...

547
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,716
...Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.

548
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:28,239
- Is he gonna go?
- Hallway camera ready.

549
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:33,878
- That one's for free.
- Stand by, all house cameras.

550
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,359
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

551
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,236
- In case I don't see you...
...good afternoon and good night.

552
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:50,029
Good afternoon, good night...

553
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:56,469
- Morning, Truman. Hows it going?
- I'll check. Vital signs are good.

554
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,795
Hey, Pluto!

555
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,117
- Good morning!
- Look who's here.

556
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:09,110
Beautiful day, isn't it? We thought
about the policy, and we'll take it.

557
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:13,518
Great! Let's go up to my office
and sign the papers.

558
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:18,111
- Next week would be better.
- I knew it. See you guys.

559
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,995
- See you next week.
- Looking forward to it!

560
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:26,273
This isn't about insurance.
This is about the great variable.

561
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:31,634
When will death occur?
Could be a week, a month, a year...

562
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,513
Could be today.

563
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:40,477
Innocent sunbather, stabbed by
the tip of a runaway beach umbrella.

564
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,797
No way to guard against that.

565
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,829
- Excuse me.
- Truman, this is Vivian.

566
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,396
The two of you
are going to be neighbors.

567
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:00,553
I guess what I'm saying
is that life is... fragile.

568
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,192
- Vivian, your office.
- Sorry.

569
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:09,234
I'm sorry... You do?

570
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,752
Oh, great.
Let me take your information.

571
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,233
Ready, two. Go to two.

572
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,075
Back to medium... and wide.

573
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,278
I was just trying
to train the kid to... never mind.

574
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:59,150
- What's he doing in the basement?
- He moved in there when Meryl left.

575
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:04,275
Why wasn't I told? Unpredictable
behavior has to be reported.

576
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,190
- He's just sleeping. I thought...
- This is the best shot we've got?

577
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,075
- What's on the clock-cam?
- Obstruction.

578
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,751
- What happened?
- He was tidying up his garbage.

579
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,999
I was gonna call you,
but he gave up and fell asleep.

580
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:27,274
- I want to check the set-ups...
...for the insurance convention.

581
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,948
Nice move.

582
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,714
There you go.

583
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,958
Isolate the audio.
Give me a close-up on his torso.

584
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,554
Still breathing.

585
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:04,548
Where's Chloe? Call him.
Tell him it's a wrong number.

586
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,919
- What took you so long?
- I had to wait for it.

587
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:17,956
- They were busy. What's going on?
- I don't know.

588
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:22,870
- He did nothing but stand around.
- Shut up and watch.

589
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:26,789
Then we went to night vision.
He's asleep.

590
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,156
There! Stop it.
Zoom in under the chair.

591
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:41,758
- Enhance it.
- Is it...? My God...

592
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:48,718
- He didn't go up the stairs.
- Get Marlon over there!

593
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,553
Truman... Surprise party!

594
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:13,390
I got a six-pack of cold brew skies
with our name on them.

595
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,990
Come on, pal.
Come on, buddy.

596
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,715
Shit!

597
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:27,318
Marlon, find him.
He's still in the room.

598
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,875
- Come out, wherever you are.
- Good. Keep it light.

599
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,310
I know you’re in here.

600
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:45,877
Check under the table.
The closet, behind you.

601
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,558
Gee, I wonder where
he could possibly be.

602
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,469
Lawn-cam!

603
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,035
- Say something. Keep it going.
- He's gone.

604
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,312
- Cut transmission!
- Cut transmission?

605
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:27,589
- God in heaven!
- Give me the phone!

606
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,872
TECHNICAL FAULT
PLEASE STAND BY

607
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:54,710
We've got every available extra
looking for him. The crew, too.

608
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:58,515
- What about prop cars?
- Accounted for.

609
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,872
He has the world's most recognizable
face, he can't disappear.

610
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,911
Go find him, Pluto. Good dog.

611
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,591
All this fuss!
If he could just hear my voice.

612
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,839
Truman! Truman!

613
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,749
Let me try.
Truman!

614
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,954
It's me, Dad!
Let's talk!

615
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,112
Yeah, I know. We're just about
done with the square.

616
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,393
We've got to go back to Barrymore,
check the interiors.

617
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:18,470
Who's watching the college?
Send someone over there.

618
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,513
- Take another man, get down there.
- Find the son of a bitch!

619
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:31,235
Get some batteries.
He's not gonna glow in the dark.

620
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:38,278
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.

621
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,798
- What time is it?
- It's way too early for that.

622
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,996
Cue the sun.

623
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,395
What time is it?

624
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:08,038
Christ of, what's going on?
There's rumors that he's dead.

625
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,754
The media's having a feeding frenzy.

626
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,478
Every network has a pirated shot
of Marlon making an ass of himself.

627
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:21,879
- The sponsors are threatening us.
- We're getting our highest ratings.

628
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,913
- No sign of him.
- Go back to town, join the others.

629
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:35,956
Everyone else at first positions.
Everyone is at first positions?

630
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,957
He's got to be there somewhere.

631
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:01,917
- We're not watching the sea.
- Why would we watch the sea?

632
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:06,910
- Sweep the harbour.
- Bring up the harbour cameras.

633
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,875
- Aren't some of those out?
- Yeah, but we have the lighthouse.

634
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,755
All buoy-cams, please.

635
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,873
- Long lens, short-base cameras.
- Why are we looking at the water?

636
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,992
Truman, where are you going?

637
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:36,558
- Sailing? He's afraid of the water.
- Resume transmission.

638
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,157
I got 2-1 he doesn't make it.

639
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,432
Just leave them in the car.

640
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,550
Get off this mast-cam. You can't
see his face. Go to the cabin-cam.

641
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,396
Perfect.
That's our hero shot.

642
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:43,395
- Let's get another boat out there.
- I need to talk to the ferry guys.

643
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,036
Come on, get it moving!

644
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:54,430
- I'm just the bus driver.
- They can't sail. Theyre actors!

645
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,518
How do we stop him?

646
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:17,471
Okay... We're going to access
the weather programme' now.

647
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,798
So hold on to your hats.
You got that?

648
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,312
No, I think we'll want to
localize the storm over the boat.

649
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,029
Get the co-ordinates.

650
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:36,758
- There's no rescue boat.
- He'll turn back. He'll be afraid.

651
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,676
There she blows.

652
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,314
Come on.

653
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,200
Give me some lightning.

654
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,675
Hit him again!

655
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:38,595
- He can't die on television!
- He was born on television.

656
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,515
Hold on!

657
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,837
Is that the best you can do?

658
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,952
You're gonna have to kill me!

659
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,753
What should we do
with a drunken sailor...

660
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:53,876
- I demand you cease transmission.
- Keep running.

661
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,799
Increase the wind!

662
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,832
- For the last time...
- Capsize him, tip him over.

663
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:08,397
- He's tied himself to the boat!
- He'll drown, and he doesn't care.

664
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,068
Do it... Do it!

665
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,869
That's enough.

666
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,958
I want to talk to him.

667
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,796
EXIT

668
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:28,833
Truman... You can speak.

669
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,071
I can hear you.

670
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:40,269
- Who are you?
- I'm the creator of a TV show.

671
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,711
It gives hope
and inspiration to millions.

672
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,469
- Then who am I?
- You're the star.

673
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:01,077
- Was nothing real?
- You were real.

674
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,353
That's what made you so good
to watch. Listen, Truman.

675
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:11,271
There's no more truth out there
than in the world I created for you.

676
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:17,910
The same lies, the same deceit.

677
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:23,990
But in my world,
you have nothing to fear.

678
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:31,510
- I know you better than you do.
- You never had a camera in my head.

679
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:37,196
You're afraid.
That's why you can't leave.

680
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,195
It's okay, Truman.
I understand.

681
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:51,669
I have been watching you
your whole life.

682
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:55,668
I was watching when you were born.

683
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,475
I was watching
when you took your first step.

684
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:07,710
I watched you
on your first day of school.

685
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,152
The episode
when you lost your first tooth.

686
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,234
You can't leave, Truman.

687
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,512
- Please, God.
- You belong here.

688
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,756
You can do it.

689
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,671
With me.

690
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,274
Talk to me.
Say something.

691
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:41,515
Say something, damn it! You're
on TV. You're live to the world!

692
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:03,113
In case I don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

693
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,110
He made it!
All right, Truman!

694
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,551
Cease transmission.

695
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:03,153
- You want another slice?
- No. Let's see what else is on.
