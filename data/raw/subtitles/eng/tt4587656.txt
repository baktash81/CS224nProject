Ooh!

11
00:01:58,253 --> 00:01:59,921
Don't think I don't
see you, little one.

12
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,489
I think there's enough
for both of us, though.

13
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,515
<i>Mary.</i>

14
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,539
Fear not,

15
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:23,078
for you have been favored by God
to conceive and bear a son.

16
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,813
A... A son?

17
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:27,449
But how?

18
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,451
The Holy Spirit will
overshadow you,

19
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,985
and the child will be called
the Son of God.

20
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,288
For nothing is
impossible with God.

21
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,591
Thank you.

22
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:40,028
Do I say thank you?
I mean, yes.

23
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:41,997
Let it be done, just as you say.

24
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:05,520
Guys! Guys!

25
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,190
You're not gonna believe this!

26
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,342
Whoa!

27
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,545
Huh?

28
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:34,115
Whoa.

29
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,651
Whoa.

30
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,386
Whoa.

31
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,088
Whoa.

32
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,495
Whoa!

33
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:49,196
Okay. You are not
gonna believe this,

34
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,566
but I think a new star
just appeared in the sky...

35
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,967
No, no, no.

36
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,403
What have I said about
looking through that thing?

37
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:56,804
Come on. Wait.

38
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:58,239
This doesn't happen every day.

39
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:06,280
There's nothing out
there for you, kid.

40
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,681
Things are changing.

41
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,416
That star means something.

42
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,919
And I'm not gonna
be here forever.

43
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:25,433
Yeah-yeah! Hoo!

44
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,337
I love the smell of freshly
ground grain in the morning.

45
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,074
Hey, kid, your unemployed
bird friend's here.

46
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,776
Dave!

47
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,812
Hey, pal.
What's new out there today?

48
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:40,748
Mmm. Oh, um, you know,
not a whole lot.

49
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:41,983
I mean, it's Nazareth.

50
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,861
That rooster on Fifth Street
overslept again.

51
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,086
And, uh, that horse, uh...

52
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,255
What is his name?
Jeremiah? Hezekiah?

53
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:48,665
There's an &quot;Lah&quot; In there.
I know that.

54
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,724
He lost a shoe.

55
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:51,459
And then, well...

56
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:53,161
I mean, it's barely
worth mentioning,

57
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,529
but the, um, royal caravan is
rolling through town today.

58
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,164
What? The royal caravan?

59
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,444
Are you kidding?
No, buddy! For real!

60
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,803
I spotted them outside of town

61
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:03,672
and had to come
straight here to tell you.

62
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,415
Today's the day
we've been waiting for.

63
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,176
Nazareth can kiss my gleaming
white tail feathers good-bye.

64
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,113
See? I told you
that star was a sign.

65
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:13,967
We're meant for something
greater than this.

66
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,584
This is our job,
and once you accept that,

67
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,853
you'll be a glowing
picture of happiness.

68
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,588
Like me.

69
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,191
Uh, we're talking about
the royal caravan here.

70
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,893
It's the ultimate job.

71
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:31,665
<i>You get to go from town to town, see
the world, visit important people,</i>

72
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,035
<i>and you get to march
with the biggest, strongest,</i>

73
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,003
<i>greatest horses in the world.</i>

74
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,571
Dave! Dave! Dave! Dave!

75
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,649
<i>All the animals in every town
watching us go by.</i>

76
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,075
Dave! Dave! Dave!

77
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,310
<i>And we'll finally be doing
something important.</i>

78
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,679
Huh?

79
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,282
A miniature donkey
in the royal caravan?

80
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:48,533
That'll be the day.

81
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:49,650
Don't listen to him.

82
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:53,053
And what's a dove gonna do,
carry one grape at a time?

83
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,656
Hey, at least he's not
locked up in a mill like us.

84
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,359
I'm telling you, folks in
this town just don't get it.

85
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:00,028
And, I could carry two grapes,

86
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,521
one in each talon, thank you very much.

87
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,696
Bells.

88
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:04,999
Wait. Bells.

89
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
That's them.

90
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:14,676
It's time to activate
Operation Prison Break.

91
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,012
Okay.

92
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:21,024
All I have to do is kick
this sharp metal killer stick

93
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,483
towards my head and duck.

94
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:23,684
It'll cut your harness...

95
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:24,885
And I'll finally be free.

96
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,955
Oh, I love Operation
Prison Break.

97
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,890
Such a good idea.
Here we go.

98
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,324
Oh...

99
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,198
Okay, that's not good.

100
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,235
Oh, boy.

101
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,544
See? I knew that would work.

102
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,414
Just like we planned.

103
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,850
With a momentary
near-death hiccup.

104
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:57,719
Well, old-timer,
it's been real.

105
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,486
Good luck to you.
Wait, Dave.

106
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,755
We can't just leave him.

107
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,432
Buddy, I get where
you're coming from,

108
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,092
but it's the royal caravan,
not the retirement caravan.

109
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:06,927
Look at him.
He's like 300 years old.

110
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:09,564
All right. What's going
on in...

111
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,070
Oh...

112
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,438
Uh...

113
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,744
Mmm. Now, this ought
to keep you where you belong.

114
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,714
Hyah!

115
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:29,517
You're nothing
but a great big, rotten...

116
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,355
Oh, boy.

117
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:38,592
Good-for-nothing bully!

118
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:40,595
Yeah, you better walk away.

119
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,464
Ah. Who needs
the royal caravan?

120
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,000
There's plenty of excitement
here in Nazareth.

121
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,104
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm very upset right now.

122
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,141
I'm gonna go find
someone to poop on.

123
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:56,411
If that miller thinks
this yoke is gonna stop me...

124
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,680
Ooh, boy, do I have
a surprise for him.

125
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:03,218
I'll be riding with kings
any day now. You'll see.

126
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:15,962
Huh. Still no Mary.

127
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:17,699
Okay. Just a little late.

128
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:20,076
It's normal to be late to your
wedding feast. Totally normal.

129
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,835
Just like it's normal
to talk to yourself.

130
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,003
There he is!

131
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,171
Hey.
Hi, Joseph.

132
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:25,306
Looking good!

133
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,746
Mary. You made it.

134
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:36,050
You look beautiful.

135
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,318
So do you.

136
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,586
Uh, well, handsome.

137
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,089
I've missed you.

138
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:43,366
You're a little late, you know.
I was starting to worry.

139
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,525
Oh, sorry.

140
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,661
That's our fault.
We're always late.

141
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:49,863
&quot;We&quot; Who? You were driving.

142
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:53,568
She was such a big help to us
these past several months.

143
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,986
Wasn't she, John?

144
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:56,271
Sorry, big guy.

145
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,349
I know how great she is,
but I'm taking her back.

146
00:08:58,373 --> 00:08:59,706
Joseph?

147
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,875
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

148
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,243
Of course.

149
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,847
And, just warning you,
it might be a lot to take in.

150
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,350
Mary, it's our wedding feast.

151
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,085
Of course. You can
tell me anything.

152
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:13,487
She's here!

153
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,093
Sorry, uh, what did you want
to talk about?

154
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,761
Oh, it can wait.

155
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,196
Let's enjoy the party.

156
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,904
So, any new escape plans, kid?

157
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,872
What's the point?

158
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,809
I'm always gonna be stuck on the same
old wheel with the same old view.

159
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,411
What's wrong with the view?

160
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,886
I know it feels like
we're just going in circles.

161
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:46,787
We are.

162
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:47,788
Look, kid.

163
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,290
We're mill donkeys.

164
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,926
We grind grain.
We don't carry kings.

165
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,594
Yeah.

166
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,130
Should've listened to you
and given up a long time ago.

167
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,448
What is happening?

168
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:16,951
Kid, it's my leg. Go get help.

169
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,555
These good-for-nothing
animals.

170
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:22,824
What is it now?

171
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,445
Just what I needed.

172
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,798
Are the gates open?
What?

173
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,002
Yeah.
You!

174
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,504
What are you doing...

175
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,940
Kid, get out of here.

176
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,609
Wait, but I thought you said...

177
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:42,860
What about you?

178
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:43,978
I'll be fine.

179
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,447
I just hope you find
what you're looking for.

180
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,150
I don't know what to say.

181
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:50,618
You're welcome, kid.

182
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,953
Now, get going.

183
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,324
Oh, no, you don't!

184
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,460
You're free, kid.
Make it count.

185
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,670
What?

186
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,805
Hey!
Huh?

187
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,049
Where do you think you're going?

188
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,875
Oh!
Get back here!

189
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,289
Look, I'm not gonna
be here long.

190
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,212
Runaway donkey!
Somebody grab him!

191
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,123
Sorry, hon. Looks like I'm
leaving sooner than I thought.

192
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,982
Never forget me!

193
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:25,386
You broke out! Yes, the
dream is back on. Whoo-hoo!

194
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,653
See, not free yet.

195
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,165
The miller!
The miller's on my tail!

196
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,157
Yeah, and he does
not look happy.

197
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,626
I am not happy!

198
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,826
Follow me.

199
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,795
This way. Up here.
No, no, not up.

200
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,397
No, donkey don't like up!

201
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,672
Sorry. Sorry.

202
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,508
I'm a really nice guy.

203
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,012
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

204
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,414
Oh!

205
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,286
What now?
Jump.

206
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,089
Jump? What, are you crazy?

207
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,691
Just jump!

208
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,096
A flying donkey!

209
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,000
Ah! Well, greetings, ladies.

210
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,877
Wait a second.
Are they eating chicken?

211
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,679
Ladies, run!

212
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,684
Other way. Other way!

213
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:35,890
No, no. Where'd you go?

214
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,394
Dave? Dave? Where are you?

215
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,331
I got you now.

216
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:49,637
Oh, no.

217
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,906
No, no, no.
There's no way out of this.

218
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,243
Here we go!

219
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,094
Okay. Here goes.

220
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:17,164
He's a good man.
He'll understand.

221
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:18,299
Thanks.

222
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:19,765
Mmm.

223
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,969
Zechariah! Party's over.

224
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,471
Let's go.

225
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,740
Great party, guys.

226
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,075
Bye, now.
Joseph,

227
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,144
You must be the happiest
man in the world.

228
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,079
Or second happiest.

229
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,015
Clearly, I'm the happiest.

230
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,910
You know, I think I liked
you better when you couldn't talk.

231
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,154
Wow.

232
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,889
Our place is a mess.

233
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:44,324
&quot;Our place.&quot;

234
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,526
I like the sound of that.

235
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:47,962
Me, too.

236
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,964
Well, this place
isn't gonna clean itself.

237
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,299
I'm starting with the dishes.

238
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,336
Okay.
And I'll start down here.

239
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,237
Where I figure out
how to tell him about you.

240
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,909
It's all good news. Promise.

241
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,344
All good news.

242
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:05,679
Yep.

243
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,248
Hmm?

244
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,633
I'm caught again.

245
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,636
There's gotta be
a better hiding place.

246
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,071
Okay, maybe not here.

247
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,874
Nope, not that one, either.

248
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:35,341
Why couldn't I be smaller?

249
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:37,578
The one time
I wish I was smaller.

250
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,346
Oh, no.

251
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,462
You poor thing.

252
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,266
You're hurt.

253
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,706
What is she doing?

254
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,277
That can't be good.

255
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,614
If I'm going to help you, you're
gonna have to let me, okay?

256
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,051
Okay.

257
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:23,291
Huh.

258
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:24,926
Better?

259
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:32,767
Good. Nice to meet you.

260
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,368
I'm Mary.

261
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,974
Hey. You gonna bring
me up any more dishes?

262
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,643
You didn't tell me you had a donkey.
Huh?

263
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:45,546
I don't.

264
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,853
No, he must be a stray.

265
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,488
Go on, boy. Shoo!

266
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,026
You're scrappy.
Scrappy little donkey.

267
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,661
Come on.

268
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,098
All right, that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

269
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,940
Oh!

270
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,860
Are you okay?

271
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,645
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
It's just a...

272
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:20,614
Oh, well, I'm glad to see
that the donkey survived.

273
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:22,282
Poor little guy is hurt.

274
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,084
Give him a break.
Hello!

275
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,719
Has anyone lost a donkey?

276
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,764
Because, if you have, he's here!
What should we call you?

277
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:29,089
And I do not want him!

278
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,124
How about...

279
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,658
Wait, what are you doing?
Boaz.

280
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:33,826
You're naming it?

281
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,995
What do you think, Bo?

282
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,663
Bo? Ugh. No way.

283
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,700
Bo's a good name
for you. Isn't it?

284
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,302
Isn't it?

285
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:42,770
Oh, yeah,
Bo's great. Love it.

286
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,704
Mary, no.

287
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,416
No, if you name him, you're gonna start
feeling affectionate toward him.

288
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,485
And once you feel affectionate,
you're gonna want to keep him.

289
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,812
And if there is one thing we are
definitely not going to do...

290
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,001
Do you think he'll be
warm enough down here?

291
00:16:58,552 --> 00:16:59,820
That's my workshop.

292
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,724
Let's just let him stay here
till he's all better.

293
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:05,298
Don't you think
we should at least...

294
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,162
Uh...

295
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,162
Uh...

296
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:11,699
Mmm.

297
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,100
Um...

298
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,270
Mary?

299
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,374
Come on.
Let's go talk upstairs.

300
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,749
Okay...

301
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:33,186
Finally. They are gone,
and I am out of here.

302
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,231
Oh! There you are.

303
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,034
I am so glad you're okay.

304
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,978
Do you know how much flying around
I have done looking for you?

305
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,980
I thought that maybe the miller
caught you and was gonna eat you.

306
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,807
Eat me? Yeah, I don't think
he was gonna do that.

307
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,610
You don't know!
He had crazy in his eyes.

308
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:59,312
So keep it down. He's still
out there someplace.

309
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:00,514
Do you think he heard?

310
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:01,581
Nah. I think we're good.

311
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,150
This is the last
place he'd check.

312
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,953
Nothing special ever happens
in an old shack like this.

313
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,056
The Messiah?

314
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,960
You're saying that baby
is the actual Messiah?

315
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,562
Like from the prophets? I do
need to sit down, actually.

316
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,233
I know. I know how
it sounds, but yes.

317
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:22,803
And God wants you
and me to raise him.

318
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,273
Me? Are you sure, uh...

319
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,943
I mean, did
the angel mention me?

320
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,044
Well, no, but it's...

321
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,946
Look, I can't raise
the Son of God.

322
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,247
He's a king.
I'm just a carpenter.

323
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,917
He needs someone with a little
more experience being...

324
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,586
I don't know, king-ish?

325
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,821
I mean, who am I?

326
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,226
You're my husband.

327
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,797
I am so sorry.

328
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,932
This is just so much
to take in right now.

329
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,969
Can I have a little time?

330
00:18:57,738 --> 00:18:59,373
Okay. We got it this time.

331
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,680
We're making progress,
though, right?

332
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,782
Hate to say it,
but even if we got you out,

333
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,384
you're never gonna make it to
the royal caravan on that leg.

334
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,687
Dave, look,
I don't want to hold you back.

335
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,356
You fly ahead without me.

336
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,157
I'll catch up once my leg heals.

337
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,235
No. We're in this together, and
I'm not gonna leave you here.

338
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,804
Friends don't do that.
Are you sure?

339
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:23,463
Yeah, and besides, you'd
never make it without me.

340
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,265
I am a bird of the world.

341
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,434
I know how things
work out there.

342
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,636
You are a donkey of a barn.

343
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,504
A very small,
ill-smelling barn.

344
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,206
You need me.
Okay.

345
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,441
So, now what?

346
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,509
Hide out here
until your leg heals,

347
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,311
and then just get
yourself kicked out.

348
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,313
And we'll be back on track, pal.

349
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,049
Bo, actually.

350
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,151
My name is Bo now.
Mary named me.

351
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,619
&quot;Bo.&quot; Hmm.

352
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,721
That's got a nice
ring to... Wait.

353
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,556
That lady person named you?

354
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,324
I said hide here,
not settle in and get a name.

355
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,261
Have I taught you nothing?

356
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:56,062
No one is settling in, okay?

357
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,199
Once my leg is healed, it's
time for Operation Kick Me Out.

358
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:02,545
Good. Now, I'm an expert at this
type of thing, so listen up.

359
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,905
Things I found that tend
to tick people off.

360
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,506
Jumping out and scaring them.

361
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,608
Singing really loudly
early in the morning.

362
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:11,045
Staring at them while they eat.

363
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:14,281
At the risk of stating the
obvious, a well-placed number two.

364
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,615
Breaking things.

365
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:17,184
Setting things on fire.

366
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,037
Licking things that
don't want to be licked.

Come on, guys! Wait up!

392
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,583
I expected a left turn
two deserts ago.

393
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:57,918
I'm dying back here!

394
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,462
I can't believe
we passed that last oasis.

395
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:00,937
I'm getting thirsty.

396
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:02,388
Lost!

397
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,124
These wise guys are lost.

398
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:06,125
Wise men don't get lost, Felix.

399
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,628
So you're saying they know
where this birthday party is?

400
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,031
And what makes you so certain
it's a birthday party?

401
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,499
Oh, here we go.

402
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,834
Have you seen the presents
these guys are bringing?

403
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:17,402
Gold, myrrh, frankincense.

404
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:18,839
Could be a baby shower.

405
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:21,475
You bring gifts to a baby shower.
Baby shower?

406
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:24,244
What is a baby gonna do with
frankincense, silly camel?

407
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,845
It's a birthday party.

408
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:27,247
Mmm. Baby shower.

409
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,691
Birthday party.
Baby shower.

410
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:29,817
Birthday party.

411
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,094
Baby shower.
Birthday party!

412
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,586
What if it's not a party at all?

413
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,555
What if we're on our way
to do something important

414
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,525
like, I don't know,
meeting the Son of God?

415
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,864
Uh-oh. Deborah's crazier
than a box of rocks.

416
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:47,801
I believe the expression is,
&quot;Dumb as a box of rocks.&quot;

417
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,412
You ever shake a box of rocks?

418
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:50,670
They sound crazy.

419
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,907
<i>♪ You're westward leading ♪</i>

420
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,643

421
00:22:56,776 --> 00:23:00,346
<i>♪ Guide us to the light ♪</i>

422
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:09,356
So floridly written.

423
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,291
It makes one wonder
how the emperor

424
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:14,394
has so much time for counting
his subjects.

425
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:20,200
But if Caesar decrees a census,
then a census he will get.

426
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,468
Send the royal guard to round
up every man and woman.

427
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:24,420
Sire.

428
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:26,238
Let the counting
of the sheep begin.

429
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:30,310
Your Majesty, three magi
bearing gifts for the king.

430
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,016
Hold it right there, camels.

431
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,085
I bet they can play
that game we made up.

432
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,688
That was fun.
What was it called again?

433
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:43,689
&quot;How High.&quot;

434
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,642
On three. One, two...

435
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:48,695
Three!

436
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,402
How high?
Camel high.

437
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,274
Ah.

438
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:04,276
Your gifts are unexpected,
though not unwelcome.

439
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:07,447
Um, Your Majesty,
these gifts are not for you.

440
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:10,116
Yes, they're for the new king.

441
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,752
What new king?

442
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:13,253
The one foretold by the star.

443
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,421
I knew it.

444
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,133
It's a birthday party
for the new king.

445
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:19,092
No, no. I'm pretty certain
it's a baby shower.

446
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:21,661
Or maybe they're referring
to the coming Messiah.

447
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,163
The Son of God.

448
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,833
Okay, now I'm starting
to worry about her.

449
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,770
Deborah, are you okay?

450
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,172
How many hooves am I holding up?

451
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,309
Now bring in my scribes.

452
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:37,611
There is a prophecy.

453
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,612
What are they saying?
Shh.

454
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:43,181
I can't make it out, but it's something
about the king of the... Shoes?

455
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,418
King of the shoes?
That's what this is about?

456
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:47,454
Mmm-mmm. That can't be right.
Whoa! Look!

457
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:50,257
Look! Dude has gold slippers.
King of the shoes, no doubt.

458
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,691
That, Felix, is money
and no taste.

459
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,094
Can we move past the shoes?

460
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:55,696
I think...
Yo, look at that guy.

461
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,640
You see him?
He's just the royal dog walker.

462
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,365
Trust me. Felix,
I know these things.

463
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,034
What? Dog walker?

464
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,936
He's like a nightmare
wearing a helmet.

465
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:07,640
We must find this king at once.

466
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,010
I will set my scribes
to the task.

467
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:15,148
In the meantime, I invite you to stay
in the palace as my royal guests.

468
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,917
No, no, that's
not necessary, sire.

469
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,487
Oh. But, I insist.

470
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:22,589
Okay. That was sinister.

471
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,324
Yep. We're leaving.

472
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:27,593
We're not gonna do any slumber
parties with any evil shoe kings.

473
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,138
No, thank you.

474
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:31,983
Too late.

475
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:43,877
This new king is a problem.

476
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,416
Get rid of the problem.

477
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,012
The room was filled
with magical light.

478
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:09,769
And then the angel said that the
child would be the new king.

479
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,705
New king?

480
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:15,108
And I thought,
&quot;I'm not ready to be a Mom.&quot;

481
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,711
But then I realized the angel
was talking to the lady.

482
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:21,582
Wait, wait. I'm not done.

483
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:23,382
That's usually everyone's
favorite part.

484
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,120
Whoa, whoa!

485
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,426
Nice story, rat.
Here's how it ends.

486
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,103
The end.

487
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:36,062
Rufus, spit it out.

488
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:37,663
We need that rat to talk.

489
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,299
Ho! I am not a rat.

490
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,500
I'm a Pygmy Jerboa.

491
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,568
What's a Jerboa?

492
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:45,405
It is in the rodent family but
an entirely different species.

493
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:47,006
Rufus, enough. Spit it out.

494
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:51,611
Aw! I was just starting to get
a little bit of the flavor.

495
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:56,783
You've been telling this story
to every critter in Galilee.

496
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,252
Now it's our turn to hear it.

497
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:00,954
From the beginning.

498
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,890
From the beginning?

499
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,926
Okay. Uh, well...

500
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,429
I was born in a sack of barley
somewhere in Capernaum.

501
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,798
Skip to the end!
Who's the woman?

502
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,934
Her name is Mary.
She lives in Nazareth.

503
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,770
But, please, don't hurt her.

504
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,288
She's really nice.

505
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:19,672
Don't worry.

506
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,474
We're harmless.

507
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,176
Hey! That's mine!

508
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,491
Oh, no.

509
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:40,994
Mary!

510
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,498
Looks like you're healed up.

511
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,268
Feeling better?

512
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:50,637
All I'm saying is
it's unfair, you know,

513
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,807
to make all these people drop
everything for the census.

514
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,710
And for us to travel to Bethlehem,
especially in your condition.

515
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,643
Joseph, I'm not dying.

516
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:00,847
It's just a little road trip.
We'll be fine.

517
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,551
This feels right.

518
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,296
You know, Mary,
most donkeys have to work.

519
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,355
You are spoiling him.

520
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:09,990
She is spoiling you.

521
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,694
Hey, look at you.

522
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:15,946
Your leg's all better.

523
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:17,063
Hey, Dave.

524
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,699
All right, time to activate
Operation Kick Me Out.

525
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,368
What's your plan of attack?

526
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:24,905
Uh, first, I thought I'd let
her finish this belly rub.

527
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,172
Snap out of it!

528
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:28,141
A little bird named Methuselah

529
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,652
told me the royal caravan will be
passing through not too far from here.

530
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,946
We can catch them
if we leave soon.

531
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,748
All right, let's get
kicked out of here.

532
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,525
All packed up.
Is the donkey ready?

533
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,251
Yes, his leg looks good as new.

534
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,019
Finally. Time for him
to earn his keep.

535
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:42,231
All right, Bo, let's get you
hitched up to this cart

536
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:44,357
so you can take us to Bethlehem.

537
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:46,258
Bethlehem?
Bethlehem?

538
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,727
Not good, not good.

539
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:50,563
The royal caravan
is nowhere near Bethlehem.

540
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:53,366
Don't worry.
He's gotta catch me first.

541
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,042
Joseph, maybe if you just...

542
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:04,111
Don't worry, Mary.
I've got this.

543
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,424
Well, looks like you got me.

544
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,227
Come here!

545
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,395
Ha-ha!

546
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:26,299
Ooh!

547
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,334
That looked like it hurt.
It did.

548
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:29,636
How was that?

549
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:30,804
Bo, look out!

550
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,008
Come on. See?

551
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,810
Under control.

552
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:40,647
Joseph!

553
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,582
No, no, I'm okay.

554
00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:45,251
You know what?
We can walk to Bethlehem.

555
00:29:45,385 --> 00:29:46,620
No problem.

556
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:47,854
Useless donkey.

557
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:50,757
Nicely done.

558
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:51,824
I thought so.

559
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,826
Did you see how I laid him
out on the ground?

560
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,296
Those caravan horses
have nothing on you.

561
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:57,463
Okay, so now what?

562
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,497
Easy.

563
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,800
All we have to do
is slip through the gate

564
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:02,468
when they're on their way out.

565
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,336
No, no, no,
don't close the gate!

566
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,574
Don't worry.
We'll be back soon.

567
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:20,386
I guess that was good-bye?

568
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,189
You're not gonna cry, are you?

569
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,725
Come on, we gotta figure
out a way to open this thing.

570
00:30:37,637 --> 00:30:40,673
This is what I get for
having a friend who can't fly.

571
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:43,810
You know what? Gates were never
a problem before I met you.

572
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,645
There's gotta be something
we can use here.

573
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:48,147
There's that table,
that lumber, those tools.

574
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,016
A giant knife.

575
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,151
Hide!

576
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:02,695
Hmm.

577
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,665
Okay, Bo. What haven't you told me?

578
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:07,967
You been making some new friends?
No.

579
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:11,537
I bet the miller sent them
to bring me back to the mill.

580
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:14,240
They left the gate open.
I'll make a run for it.

581
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,675
Dave, you jump out
and create a distraction.

582
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,911
What? No. Terrible plan.

583
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,247
Why don't you make the
distraction and I run for it?

584
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:24,217
Because I'm the one trapped
in here, and you can fly,

585
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,519
as you like to keep telling me.
All valid points.

586
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,788
I got a scent.

587
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,790
I smell a dog!

588
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,759
Thaddeus, there's
definitely a dog here.

589
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,260
Oh, yeah! Yeah! Oh...

590
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,979
I smell me.

591
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,564
Hey! Scary dogs!

592
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:39,866
You guys here for the show?

593
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:41,700
What show?
What...

594
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:45,938
&quot;What show?&quot;
The silly dog asks.

595
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,238
You're adorable.

596
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:51,277
&quot;The Dance of the Royal
Dove, &quot; Of course.

597
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,279
Played in Rome six years.

598
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,680
Great reviews.

599
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:56,548
Caesar saw it twice.
Made him cry.

600
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,160
He won't admit that because,
you know, he's Caesar and all.

601
00:31:58,184 --> 00:31:59,585
But he definitely cried
like a baby.

602
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,721
But I digress.
We don't have time for this.

603
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:04,390
No! Wait! The show
is about to start.

604
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,292
Okay. You can...

605
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,995
What are you doing? Don't watch me.

606
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:28,681
Aw, yeah.
This bird can dance.

607
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:36,465
No, guys. Guys, guys, guys,
no, this is the best part.

608
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:37,790
Okay, there you go.
They're gone.

609
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,041
Where's your owner?

610
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,159
Yeah! Where's your owner?

611
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:42,527
Who, the miller?
I don't know a miller.

612
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:45,965
My owner's a nice pregnant lady.
You would love her.

613
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,116
That's her.

614
00:32:47,117 --> 00:32:48,133
Where is she?

615
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:52,505
Wait, you're looking for Mary?
Did I say &quot;Pregnant lady&quot;?

616
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,039
I meant &quot;Miller.&quot;

617
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,342
I'm just a mill donkey
on vacation.

618
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,394
Who's Mary?

619
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,313
Keep talking.

620
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,326
Okay, that was pathetic.
Let me handle this, Bo.

621
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,449
Guys, donkeys are stubborn.
Yeah.

622
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,528
He's not gonna tell you anything.
Sorry, guys.

623
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,063
You would have to
torture it out of him.

624
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:09,456
Wait, what?

625
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,878
He didn't bandage himself.

626
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:16,195
That's her scent.

627
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,364
Now we just gotta figure out
which way she went.

628
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,499
We'll tell her you said hello.

629
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:32,477
Whoo! They left the gate open.

630
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,518
Okay. The royal caravan
is right this way.

631
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:40,854
We'll catch it in no time.

632
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:43,355
Wait. Where you going?
Dream is that way.

633
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:44,691
Right, but Mary is this way.

634
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:45,892
No, no, no, no.

635
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,192
Royal caravan cannot wait
for a rescue mission.

636
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:52,031
Especially when that guy is after her.
He is major bad news.

637
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,100
I'm not gonna just
let her get hurt, Dave.

638
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:55,335
She was nice to me.

639
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:56,436
Aw, come on, Bo.

640
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,037
We've been waiting for this.

641
00:33:58,038 --> 00:33:59,505
It'll just take a second.

642
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:01,574
Once Mary's safe,
we'll turn right around

643
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,285
and join the royal caravan.

644
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,178
Deal?

645
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:07,047
Fine! Deal.

646
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,882
So we turn right around.

647
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:12,886
Okay, leave this to me.
I know a shortcut.

648
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:26,399
He'll lead us right to her.

649
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,683
And then what?

650
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:28,833
Then we find the baby.

651
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:30,803
Oh. That baby messed
with the wrong dogs.

652
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:34,607
Nothing scares us. Not even a baby.
Right, partner?

653
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,375
Just stop.

654
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:39,245
Thaddeus, do you think
I'm bad at being bad?

655
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,226
I got it.

656
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,131
Okay, Dave, be honest.
Are we lost?

657
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,733
No.

658
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,644
'Cause this doesn't exactly
look like the beaten path.

659
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,870
It's a shortcut. Trust me.

660
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,147
Bo? Bo, right here. Look at me, buddy.

661
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,314
Just breathe. Breathe.

662
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,984
Breathe.

663
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:21,754
Nope. That's it.

664
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:24,891
No more of your terrible
shortcuts. We are... Huh?

665
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,661
Hey, look. It's Mary.
That's them.

666
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,930
Guess we'll have to take
my terrible shortcut.

667
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:32,532
You're welcome.

668
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:35,334
Whoa, whoa.
Wait. No, no, no, no. Okay.

669
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,969
Come on. Really?

670
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:38,279
Which way am I supposed to go?

671
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,973
It's a cliff.
You go down.

672
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,627
Hi.
Could you help me get down, please?

673
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:03,763
Just let go.

674
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:06,416
Here, let me.

675
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:07,600
Wait, no, no, no.

676
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,506
I'm Ruth.

677
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,108
Hi, Ruth. I'm Bo.

678
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:22,982
Hey, Ruth?
You're a little close.

679
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,467
You know, personal space?

680
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:25,818
Oh! Sorry.

681
00:36:25,952 --> 00:36:28,053
Flocking. It's a sheep thing.

682
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:30,989
So, what are you doing all
alone on a cliff like this?

683
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:36,261
Well, actually,
I'm here with my friend, Dave.

684
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,640
I'm meeting him at the bottom.
We're on the road to Bethlehem

685
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,932
so we can catch up with
my friend Mary and save her.

686
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:45,271
And once we do, we will be
joining the royal caravan.

687
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,489
Ooh! Sounds exciting.

688
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,573
Huh?

689
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,175
Well, I guess I'll get back
to following the star.

690
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,243
The star? You mean the...

691
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,613
You mean that super bright one?
Yeah, that one.

692
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,558
Have you noticed how
it's been getting brighter?

693
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,850
Totally. And the weird way
it kind of pulsates.

694
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,186
Yes! It's like it's...

695
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,337
Like it means something.

696
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:02,354
Exactly.

697
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:05,858
Okay, come on. We're almost down.
One more chasm.

698
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:09,662
This is really easy
for you, isn't it?

699
00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:12,598
You got it, Bo.
Just don't look down.

700
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,566
Ooh...

701
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:18,937
Okay, great.
Now, just... Ooh!

702
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:20,940
Just try to get
your hooves in...

703
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,943
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Spread-eagle.
We're going for a wedge thing here.

704
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:28,014
That's it. You got it.
You're a wedge.

705
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:29,165
How does that feel?

706
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,182
Fantastic.

707
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:34,051
Great. Okay. Next, just lift
that hoof and take a step down.

708
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:36,122
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No, no, no.

709
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,925
You can do it.
Just one hoof at a time.

710
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:40,093
That's it.

711
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,932
What is taking him so long?

712
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:51,003
Well, didn't exactly stick the
landing, but that was good.

713
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,139
You're a fast learner.

714
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:55,074
Dave? Dave?

715
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:58,678
I'm under you
and in a lot of pain.

716
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:01,280
Dave?
Yeah. Right here. On your butt.

717
00:38:01,414 --> 00:38:03,182
Come on. Let's get moving.

718
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:12,925
You must be Dave. I've heard
great things about you.

719
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,927
I'm Ruth.
Pleasure.

720
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,330
Well, we've got places to be,
people to save, caravans to join.

721
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,532
See you around.

722
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:20,600
Thanks, Ruth.

723
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,007
Have you, uh, ever been
to Bethlehem before?

724
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:29,775
We've never been
anywhere before.

725
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:31,477
Oh, well, you're in for a treat.

726
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,813
The Samaritan Mountains are
beautiful this time of year.

727
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:37,650
Deadly steep, but great views.

728
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:40,186
You've been to Bethlehem?

729
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,687
Are you kidding?

730
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,022
I grew up around there.
I know all the ins and outs,

731
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,358
how to avoid predators
and treacherous high cliffs.

732
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:49,827
The treacherous cliffs.

733
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:51,682
You're not really considering
this, are you?

734
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:54,000
Come on, Ruth. Lead the way.

735
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:57,903
Sheep are usually better at
following, but I will do my best.

736
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,371
Let's go, flock.

737
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:00,573
Yippee.

738
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,056
Felix, come on.

739
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,691
Shouldn't we be sneaking out?

740
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:21,294
Why are we sneaking in?

741
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,134
King Herod is up to something.

742
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:30,202
And we are gonna find out what.

743
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:32,738
With the help of a little
well-placed distraction.

744
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:36,309
Ooh!

745
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,578
Come on,
fellas. Hurry.

746
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:42,681
Still no report from my hunter?

747
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:43,950
Has he found the child?

748
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,551
No, sire.

749
00:39:45,685 --> 00:39:47,886
But your scribes are ready
to present their findings.

750
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,522
Well, finally,
someone's doing their job.

751
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:52,391
Ah, so tell me where he is.

752
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:54,393
According to the prophecy,
Your Majesty,

753
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:56,629
the new king is to be
born in Bethlehem.

754
00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:59,898
And? That's all?
To what family?

755
00:40:00,032 --> 00:40:02,535
Who are they? I am the king.

756
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,542
Huh. I am the king of Judea.

757
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:11,843
If you people can't
find this one child,

758
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:14,079
then I'll just have
to kill them all.

759
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,581
See? I told you.

760
00:40:15,715 --> 00:40:18,084
Shall we send soldiers
to track him down?

761
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,921
Um, no.

762
00:40:22,054 --> 00:40:24,556
You three, come.

763
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:25,734
It's the wise men.

764
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:26,758
Hide, quickly.

765
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,629
So, any word of the new king?

766
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:31,130
Yes.

767
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:34,066
Look for him in Bethlehem.
You're free to go.

768
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,468
Our humblest thanks,
Your Majesty.

769
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:40,105
When you find him,
send word to me.

770
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,009
I dearly wish
to know where he is

771
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:45,778
so that I, too, may honor him...

772
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,515
With a gift.

773
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,323
You know, I think
he might be up to something.

774
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,326
He's using the wise men
to track down the new king.

775
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:03,629
Yeah! Plus, did you see him
crumple that flower?

776
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,131
Shush!

777
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:06,516
We have to warn the new king.

778
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:07,767
Pack your bags, boys.

779
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,769
Looks like we're
going to Bethlehem.

780
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,606
And now our tour will continue
past these pebbles on the path.

781
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,442
Watch your step. Watch your step.
And watch your step.

782
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,310
I blame you for this.

783
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:20,646
There they are.

784
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:23,449
Come on.

785
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:35,995
Mary.

786
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:37,572
Are you sure you don't want
to sit in the cart?

787
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,798
No, it's hard enough
for you as it is.

788
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:42,468
Just let me fix my boot.

789
00:41:42,602 --> 00:41:43,869
I don't believe it.

790
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,136
Really, I'm fine.

791
00:41:45,271 --> 00:41:47,138
No, not that. That.

792
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,141
Bo?

793
00:41:51,143 --> 00:41:52,911
Mary. You're in danger.

794
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:55,882
You need to listen to what I'm
about to say extremely carefully.

795
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:01,352
You ever feel like he's
trying to talk to us?

796
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:03,823
Why is he here?
Where did he come from?

797
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:05,157
She's not getting it.

798
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,359
Okay, uh, new plan.

799
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:08,894
Can you two act like dogs?

800
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,780
What do you think?

801
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,531
Uh, yes. I do a great dog.

802
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:14,233
Dogs are my fourth best animal.

803
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:15,734
Great. Just follow my lead.

804
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:22,908
&quot;Look at me.
I'm Mary. I'm so pregnant.&quot;

805
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:26,511
&quot;I'm Joseph.
I'm in a bad mood.&quot;

806
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:29,382
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that supposed to be me?

807
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,617
It's totally you.

808
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:33,928
&quot;Oh, no!
Look! Here come the dogs!&quot;

809
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,163
That's you guys.

810
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:36,222
Oh. Oh! Uh...

811
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:39,591
Woof! Woof, woof, woof.

812
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,060
Throw me a stick,
and I'll bring it right back.

813
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:43,662
Oh, what's this?
It's a tail?

814
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:45,040
I'm gonna get you.
Seriously?

815
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,475
We're doing this
instead of the royal caravan?

816
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:49,901
No, Ruth, you're a scary dog.
Just be meaner.

817
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:53,805
Oh. Oh? Meaner? You mean like...
this!

818
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:57,585
Oh, no! They got me!

819
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:00,613
If only a certain donkey
had warned me.

820
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:07,486
There is something seriously
wrong with those animals.

821
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,654
I think Bo's trying
to tell us something.

822
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,324
Come on, come on.

823
00:43:14,193 --> 00:43:19,430
I think he wants a belly rub.

824
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:23,401
What? No. I mean, yes,
always, but not now.

825
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:24,904
Ugh. This is not working.

826
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:27,205
Guys, I hate to break this up,
but we've got trouble.

827
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,219
Mama!

828
00:43:31,243 --> 00:43:32,878
Those guys?

829
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:34,422
Yeah, they've been following us
since we came down the cliff.

830
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,086
Couldn't you have pointed
that out sooner?

831
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,983
Oh, no. They followed
us right to her.

832
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,752
Well, why don't we hide
in that big flock over there?

833
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:42,621
That's what a sheep would do.

834
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,223
Yes. Great idea.

835
00:43:45,257 --> 00:43:46,425
Bo, what are you...

836
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:48,227
Joseph?
Right behind you.

837
00:43:50,262 --> 00:43:51,464
Oh, okay.

838
00:43:51,597 --> 00:43:52,964
Wow, you must be really thirsty.

839
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:54,875
I'm gonna grab some water.
Do you want some?

840
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:58,204
Sure. Yeah, I guess I'll just
take a look at that wheel, then.

841
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:02,458
Don't carry too much, okay?

842
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:03,943
I won't.

843
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:06,012
Oh! Sorry.

844
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:14,220
Fresh figs! Get your fresh
figs here. I got them.

845
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:19,191
Hello, Sir. You look like a man
who appreciates fine pottery.

846
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:20,393
I...

847
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:25,331
Hurry up. We need
three buckets of water.

848
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:28,934
Do you see anything?

849
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:30,111
What are we looking for?

850
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,602
What...

851
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:33,606
Here we are, minutes away
from being chopped

852
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,341
into tiny little pieces
by a knife-wielding psycho.

853
00:44:36,475 --> 00:44:38,210
We could've been
riding with royalty.

854
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:39,979
Look! They're here.

855
00:44:40,112 --> 00:44:41,680
Dave, let's try
and lead them away.

856
00:44:41,814 --> 00:44:43,515
Ruth, you stay here
and guard Mary.

857
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,217
If they find her,
get our attention.

858
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,219
Yeah. We should
have a secret signal.

859
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:48,721
Sounds great.

860
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:56,862
Help me.

861
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:00,165
Oh.

862
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:03,335
Oh, gosh. The signal. Okay.

863
00:45:09,475 --> 00:45:10,576
Huh?

864
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:23,288
Hmm.

865
00:45:23,422 --> 00:45:24,890
Oh, no.
I'll take care of this.

866
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:31,997
Looks like it's up to me.

867
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:33,832
Ha-ha!

868
00:45:33,966 --> 00:45:35,768
Nope,
too big. Too big.

869
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:38,337
Ruth, looks like it's up to you.
Me?

870
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,538
I knew this day would come.

871
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:43,075
For the flock!

872
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:51,917
Huh?

873
00:45:58,023 --> 00:45:59,792
Look out!

874
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:03,071
No!

875
00:46:03,095 --> 00:46:04,096
Get back! Get back!

876
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:11,836
Watch out!

877
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:14,940
Hold it up!

878
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,175
No!

879
00:46:18,911 --> 00:46:19,912
Yes!

880
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:22,698
Bo, are you okay?

881
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,483
What has gotten into you?

882
00:46:25,484 --> 00:46:26,651
That donkey did it.

883
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,153
He destroyed everything.

884
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,621
Did you do this?

885
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:31,340
It was the donkey.

886
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:32,925
Who owns that?

887
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:34,660
Oh, boy.

888
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,828
We stopped him!

889
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:38,430
That went great, right?

890
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:40,464
Hey, you big mutts!

891
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,834
Come here.
Hope your boss knows how to swim.

892
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,336
You want some of this?

893
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:47,806
What's the matter,
guys? All tied up?

894
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,178
That's it, you're dead.

895
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,347
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

896
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,517
I hate that dancing bird.

897
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,486
I know. He's so talented.

898
00:47:03,422 --> 00:47:04,465
Huh?

899
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,464
Joseph.
No, no.

900
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:14,966
I do not want that donkey
near you or the baby.

901
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:19,471
Go! Get out of here!

902
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:20,622
Joseph, it's fine.

903
00:47:20,623 --> 00:47:21,640
Fine?

904
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:24,008
Mary, this is not
going well, all right?

905
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:27,846
I just promised four people I'd
repair the carts that he smashed.

906
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,948
Yeah, trying to save her life.

907
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:33,218
Maybe if you pulled the cart,
Joseph would want you to stay.

908
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:34,829
No, he is just
too much to deal with.

909
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,354
He's just a donkey.

910
00:47:36,488 --> 00:47:39,723
&quot;Just a donkey&quot;? Yeah, he is.
Just a good-for-nothing donkey

911
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,161
that has only ever
brought us trouble.

912
00:47:45,464 --> 00:47:48,567
Come on, Dave. Let's go.

913
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,380
Where are we going?
Where do you think?

914
00:47:50,502 --> 00:47:52,070
To join the royal caravan.

915
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,241
Where we'll finally
do something important.

916
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:03,115
Hey, Bo, wait a minute.
What about the star?

917
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,684
It means something.
You said so yourself.

918
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:08,086
You follow the star.
I'm done with that.

919
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,423
But what about our tiny flock?

920
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,759
Flocks stick together.

921
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:15,560
We're not a flock.

922
00:48:15,694 --> 00:48:17,396
I never should
have followed you.

923
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:33,712
Bo?

924
00:48:34,313 --> 00:48:35,781
Bo!

925
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:49,028
Hmm...

926
00:49:04,043 --> 00:49:05,778
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die!

927
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:09,648
We're gonna live.
We're gonna live!

928
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,086
Someone's gonna die.

I can see them!

939
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:45,711
Whoa!

940
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:00,526
Huh?

941
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:05,196

caravan-van-van-van-van!

942
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:08,600
The royal caravan! Whoo-hoo!

943
00:51:08,734 --> 00:51:10,468
Dave?

944
00:51:10,602 --> 00:51:13,271
I don't think I can go with you.

945
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:15,272
Of course you can.
What do you mean?

946
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,041
Look, um...

947
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:21,213
I know we've always talked about
joining the royal caravan,

948
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:23,214
being a part
of something important,

949
00:51:23,348 --> 00:51:27,419
but now that we're here,
I don't think this is it.

950
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,822
You know, Mary may
not be big and royal,

951
00:51:30,956 --> 00:51:33,158
but she's important.

952
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,926
She's important to me.

953
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,595
I know this was our dream,

954
00:51:36,728 --> 00:51:40,032
and even though I can't come,
I think you should go.

955
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,868
Say hi to the horses for me.

956
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,805
Oh, come on.
No, really, I mean it.

957
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,773
Bo, yes, you're right.

958
00:51:48,907 --> 00:51:51,209
The royal caravan was our dream.

959
00:51:51,343 --> 00:51:54,879
But the best part was
that it was gonna be us.

960
00:51:55,013 --> 00:51:57,582
If all I wanted was to flap
around a bunch of fancy wagons,

961
00:51:57,715 --> 00:51:59,717
I could have gone and done
that a long time ago.

962
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:03,121
I mean, I can fly, you know?
You realize that?

963
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:05,423
Yeah. I guess so.

964
00:52:05,557 --> 00:52:08,059
Look, you lead the way,
and wherever you go,

965
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:10,996
your best friend Dave
will be right behind you.

966
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,207
You ready?

967
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:36,788
No, no, no, no, no.

968
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:38,123
Let me help.

969
00:52:38,257 --> 00:52:39,958
Mary, you're in
no condition to help.

970
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:41,626
Stop saying that.

971
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,627
I'm fine.
No, you are not fine.

972
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:45,197
None of this is fine.

973
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,032
Joseph, God chose us.

974
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:49,167
But why? Why us?

975
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,202
Look at us. We'll be lucky
just to make it to Bethlehem.

976
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:55,440
And we're supposed
to raise the Son of God?

977
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:59,277
Uh, this must be
part of God's plan.

978
00:52:59,411 --> 00:53:01,680
Well, so far,
this plan is going great.

979
00:53:01,813 --> 00:53:03,715

All right? I am not
the father of a king.

987
00:53:31,176 --> 00:53:33,745

991
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:50,562
Hey.

992
00:53:50,696 --> 00:53:52,831

Hi, Ruth.

996
00:54:08,547 --> 00:54:10,748
Look, I'm sorry
for what I said back there.

997
00:54:10,882 --> 00:54:13,184
It was mean, and...

998
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:14,919
I'm glad we followed you.

999
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:19,256
You know, that night
I saw the star,

1000
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,960
I tried to get my old flock
to follow me,

1001
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,627
but they wouldn't.

1002
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:26,298
And so I struck out on my own,

1003
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:30,235
which has been hard
'cause, well, I'm a sheep.

1004
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,105
Thank you for coming back.

1005
00:54:35,107 --> 00:54:36,474
Can you help me with these?

1006
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,944
Of course! You're back!

1007
00:54:40,078 --> 00:54:42,280
Oh, sorry, personal space.

1008
00:54:42,414 --> 00:54:43,515
Ah, come here.

1009
00:54:51,423 --> 00:54:53,091
Mary.

1010
00:54:53,225 --> 00:54:55,326
Are you okay? I am so sorry.

1011
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,731
No, Joseph.
You were right.

1012
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:02,466
I was? About what?

1013
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,769
This is hard.

1014
00:55:04,569 --> 00:55:07,672
Trust me, I know it is.

1015
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:11,643
Just because God has a plan doesn't
mean it's going to be easy.

1016
00:55:12,711 --> 00:55:14,513
And that scares me.

1017
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,348
Hey. I'm scared, too.

1018
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:20,986
But I'm here. And I am yours.

1019
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,721
And I will give
everything that I have

1020
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:26,058
to keep you and the baby safe.

1021
00:55:33,932 --> 00:55:36,700
I mean, I may not have a lot...

1022
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:42,307
Oh. Speaking of which, what
happened to all our stuff?

1023
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,675
Oh. Uh...

1024
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:47,778
Bo!

1025
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:49,446
I always liked that donkey.

1026
00:55:49,581 --> 00:55:52,216
I always did. I didn't say
it enough. That's true.

1027
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,452
Ah. Ooh! Hello.

1028
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:55,653
Did the baby kick?

1029
00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:57,789
No, that was
something different.

1030
00:55:57,923 --> 00:56:00,992
Different? What &quot;Different&quot;?
Like, baby's coming now?

1031
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:04,662
We've got some time,
but, yeah, I think so.

1032
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:07,665
Okay! Nobody panic! I've got the clothes.
I've got the bag.

1033
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:10,001
I've got the sheep.
Why do I have the sheep?

1034
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,904

00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:04,415
All right. Shall we?

1059
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:05,850
<i>♪ What I've done ♪</i>

1060
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,286
Ooh!

1061
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:11,756
All right, buddy,
just wait here,

1062
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,424
and we'll be back
out in a second.

1063
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:15,593
And they're inside.

1064
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:18,641
Thank goodness.
This has been so stressful.

1065
00:58:18,763 --> 00:58:20,798
I don't know
how we held it together.

1066
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:22,200
Well, we made it.

1067
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,803
Safe and sound in Bethlehem.

1068
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,708
Something's not right.

1069
00:58:31,376 --> 00:58:32,743
Oh! Excuse me.

1070
00:58:33,311 --> 00:58:34,645
Huh?

1071
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:37,048
You.

1072
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:38,283
No, no, no.

1073
00:58:38,284 --> 00:58:39,384
Easy. Easy, boy.

1074
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,718
It's okay.

1075
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,220
Just hold still.

1076
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:44,022
Let me go!

1077
00:58:44,155 --> 00:58:46,591
No, you don't, crazy-eyed,
donkey-eating miller.

1078
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:48,084
That's my best friend!

1079
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,495
Move on!
Dave!

1080
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:52,531
Dave, are you okay?

1081
00:58:53,632 --> 00:58:55,567
Where did they go?
Who was that?

1082
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,501
Bad news.

1083
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:59,403
I'm sorry. The inn is full.
What?

1084
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:01,640
But, no, can't you see
she's about to have a child?

1085
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:04,009
What can I do?
Blame the census.

1086
00:59:04,142 --> 00:59:06,210
Uh... You know what?
We will pay double.

1087
00:59:06,344 --> 00:59:07,711
Just hold that thought.

1088
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:09,245
I'll be right back.

1089
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,316
Um, I left the money with Bo.
Joseph?

1090
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:13,251
Bo?

1091
00:59:13,951 --> 00:59:15,186
Where's Bo?

1092
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:19,591
Joseph, we're running
out of time!

1093
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:20,725
Mary.

1094
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:21,993
Bo...

1095
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:23,894
Bo, where are you?

1096
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:26,096
Ruth, I know we have had
our personal issues,

1097
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,632
but we need to set them
aside and find Bo.

1098
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:30,768
We have personal issues?

1099
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:33,304
Dave, I think you are a delight.

1100
00:59:33,438 --> 00:59:35,974
I am a delight.
Thank you for noticing.

1101
00:59:36,107 --> 00:59:39,144
Okay, time to activate
Operation Rescue Bo.

1102
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:49,988
She's here.

1103
00:59:53,224 --> 00:59:54,792
Down the street. Try them.

1104
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:57,629
You don't understand.
We just came from there.

1105
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:00,465
Sorry.

1106
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,038
Where do we go now?

1107
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:04,569
We will find a place.
We just have to keep looking.

1108
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:10,374
So this is Bethle-ham.

1109
01:00:10,508 --> 01:00:12,410
It is pronounced... Bethlehem.

1110
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:14,521
That's what I said. Bethle-ham...
Bethlehem.

1111
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:16,256
Bethlehem. As if you're
clearing your throat.

1112
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,725
Boys.
That's what I've been saying.

1113
01:00:17,749 --> 01:00:19,660
You need to get your ears checked.
Boys, focus.

1114
01:00:19,684 --> 01:00:21,051
The new king's in danger.

1115
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:22,454
Right. Let's go find him.

1116
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:24,961
They've secured our restraints.

1117
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:26,391
Yeah, and they tied us up, too.

1118
01:00:26,524 --> 01:00:28,092
We have to find the new king.

1119
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:29,660
Wise men indeed.

1120
01:00:29,794 --> 01:00:32,030
Okay, okay, think.
What do kings look like?

1121
01:00:32,163 --> 01:00:34,832
In most cultures, a king is
set apart from the plebeians

1122
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:36,434
with an ornamental headdress.

1123
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:37,635
A Ornamel what?

1124
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:39,104
They wear hats.

1125
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:41,806
Ooh?

1126
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:44,175
They're coming
for you, Your Majesty!

1127
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:45,810
Run for your life!

1128
01:00:47,779 --> 01:00:49,547
Run like the wind!
Will you cut that out?

1129
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:51,048
We'll never find
him tied up here.

1130
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,983
We have to go out and search.
That's it.

1131
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:54,618
I'm biting through the reins.

1132
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:55,786
Don't you dare.

1133
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,622
That is fine Corinthian leather.

1134
01:00:57,755 --> 01:00:59,657
Do you have any idea
how much that cost?

1135
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:01,292
You kidding me?
No, he's right.

1136
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,304
Well, we'll have to untie
these knots ourselves.

1137
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,496
Just follow my instructions.

1138
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,274
First, Felix, we'll need
you in he middle.

1139
01:01:07,298 --> 01:01:08,800
Deborah, on the left.

1140
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,267
Excuse me. Pardon me.
No.

1141
01:01:11,402 --> 01:01:12,522
Let me... Move.
No. Over.

1142
01:01:12,637 --> 01:01:14,014
Would you move?
The other way.

1143
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:15,449
Sorry about that. Sorry. My bad.
I got it.

1144
01:01:15,473 --> 01:01:16,473
Move.
No, around.

1145
01:01:16,574 --> 01:01:17,708
No, the other...

1146
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:18,943
The other left.
Stop!

1147
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:20,712
Would you stop pinching me?

1148
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,647
Come on. Come on.

1149
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:28,186
No, no, no.
Don't do this. Please!

1150
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:35,694
I can't let them down.

1151
01:01:39,731 --> 01:01:42,066
I could try praying.

1152
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,267
Let's see, um...

1153
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,036
Okay, how did Mary do this?

1154
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,072
Never mind.

1155
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:48,339
It's fine.

1156
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,777
God? Hello?

1157
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:55,546
Um, I don't really
know how this works

1158
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,415
or if You listen
to prayers from donkeys,

1159
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,084
but I've seen Mary
do this many times,

1160
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,655
and I don't know
what else to do.

1161
01:02:03,788 --> 01:02:05,389
My friends need help.

1162
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:07,025
I thought,
if I followed the star,

1163
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:09,426
it would lead me to
where I'm supposed to be,

1164
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,228
but I failed them.

1165
01:02:11,362 --> 01:02:12,997
What do you want me to do?

1166
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:18,703
Begone! Away with you!

1167
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:20,188
God?

1168
01:02:20,189 --> 01:02:21,539
Huh! Now it's talking back.

1169
01:02:21,673 --> 01:02:22,873
There's nothing to fear, Zach.

1170
01:02:23,007 --> 01:02:24,642
It's all a figment
of your imagination.

1171
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:27,244
This really realistic vision of
a donkey who's talking to God

1172
01:02:27,378 --> 01:02:28,578
and won't stop eyeballing you.

1173
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:30,081
Zach.

1174
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:32,016
Pull yourself together.

1175
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:33,469
Ow!
What's your name, sweetie?

1176
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:35,185
Bo.

1177
01:02:35,286 --> 01:02:36,988
Bo is a funny word.

1178
01:02:37,121 --> 01:02:38,389
Bo, Bo, Bo.

1179
01:02:38,523 --> 01:02:39,924
Bo, Bo.
What?

1180
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:41,368
Bo, Bo!
He has a name?

1181
01:02:41,392 --> 01:02:43,103
And she's singing him a song?
I'm doomed.

1182
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:44,495
Bo!
I kind of like that.

1183
01:02:44,629 --> 01:02:45,996
They're not usually like this.

1184
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,565
You caught us at a bad time.

1185
01:02:47,698 --> 01:02:50,635
We haven't slept in nine months.

1186
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:52,603
Nine months?
Not a wink.

1187
01:02:52,737 --> 01:02:54,639
Oh! So that
explains your eyes.

1188
01:02:54,773 --> 01:02:56,641
What? What's wrong
with my eyes?

1189
01:02:57,175 --> 01:02:58,475
Nothing.

1190
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:01,312
Yep, no sleep at all

1191
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,914
since that giant
night light turned on.

1192
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:05,482
Light?

1193
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,986
All you can do is lie awake
and listen to the crickets.

1194
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:09,721
Ta-da.

1195
01:03:14,859 --> 01:03:15,893
Oh.

1196
01:03:16,027 --> 01:03:17,762
Sorry. So excited.

1197
01:03:17,896 --> 01:03:20,064
Zach and Edith don't
like the spotlight,

1198
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:22,233
but I think it's beautiful.

1199
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:24,635
It's here.

1200
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:25,903
I can't believe this.

1201
01:03:26,037 --> 01:03:27,305
Me, neither.

1202
01:03:27,438 --> 01:03:30,074
You don't understand.
That light, that's the star.

1203
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:32,677
This is where it's
been leading me.

1204
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,845
But Mary... Joseph...

1205
01:03:34,979 --> 01:03:36,548
Guys, I gotta get out of here.

1206
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:39,483
Can you help me?

1207
01:03:39,616 --> 01:03:41,286
I got you.
I'm gonna chew him free.

1208
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:47,290
Woody.
No. Try biting the...

1209
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:49,160
I know! I'll sing you free.

1210
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:57,535
That was beautiful,
but not helpful.

1211
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,903
I think I got
a splinter in my tongue.

1212
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,641
Step aside.

1213
01:04:07,612 --> 01:04:09,947
Yes, yes! That's perfect.

1214
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,150
Now I just gotta
get past that gate.

1215
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:17,788
Uh...

1216
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:20,124
Has that ever worked for you?

1217
01:04:20,258 --> 01:04:21,658
No, actually.

1218
01:04:23,528 --> 01:04:25,462
Come on. Up you go.

1219
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:27,231
Thanks, guys.

1220
01:04:27,365 --> 01:04:29,633
Gotta run.
Mary's having a baby!

1221
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:31,635
A baby?
I love babies.

1222
01:04:31,769 --> 01:04:34,338
Bring 'em back here. There's
plenty of room in the stable.

1223
01:04:34,472 --> 01:04:36,774
Great. Now we'll never sleep.

1224
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:40,845
Huh? What?

1225
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,447
No, no, no, no.

1226
01:04:43,981 --> 01:04:45,616
Bo, buddy, where are you?

1227
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:47,785
Bo, are you there?

1228
01:04:48,386 --> 01:04:50,755
Bo? Bo!

1229
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,757
Bo! Oh, hey, Bo.

1230
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:54,424
Bo!

1231
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,027
Ruth.
You're here.

1232
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,905
Dave.
We've gotta help Mary and Joseph.

1233
01:04:57,929 --> 01:04:58,930
I know. Where are they?

1234
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:00,965
Yeah, we hadn't gotten that far.

1235
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:03,468
The dogs are here.
We can't take them on our own.

1236
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:04,768
We need to find help.

1237
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:05,920
You can count on us!

1238
01:05:05,921 --> 01:05:06,938
We won't let you down!

1239
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,946
They went that way.

1240
01:05:18,716 --> 01:05:20,627
What are we doing? We're not gonna
stop those giant, scary dogs

1241
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:22,131
with a fluffy sheep
and a tiny donkey.

1242
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,455
Even with a very masculine
and brave dove.

1243
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,022
We need backup.

1244
01:05:26,157 --> 01:05:28,425
Where do you find a dog-eating
hippopotamus in Bethlehem?

1245
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:37,968
A three-headed camel? Nice.

1246
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,970
Help! Help!

1247
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:42,006
Help! Anybody!

1248
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,108
Oh, look, a flock of sheep.

1249
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:47,311
That kind of looks like my...
Oh.

1250
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,646
That's my flock.

1251
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,915
Help.

1252
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,950
Is there anybody else?

1253
01:05:55,653 --> 01:05:57,789
No? Okay.

1254
01:05:58,555 --> 01:05:59,990
Bo needs my help.

1255
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:01,959
Okay, you can do this.
Here we go.

1256
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:03,261
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1257
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:05,330
Hey, everybody.

1258
01:06:05,463 --> 01:06:06,698
What's up?

1259
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:08,933
It's me, Ruth.

1260
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:13,471
Okay.

1261
01:06:13,604 --> 01:06:16,573
I know you guys think I was crazy
to leave and follow the star,

1262
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:20,077
but you wouldn't believe all the
adventures I've had out there.

1263
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,579
And the biggest one of all
is happening tonight.

1264
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:25,249
I've made new friends,
and they need our help.

1265
01:06:25,383 --> 01:06:28,118
So, this time,
you gotta follow me.

1266
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,487
Guys?

1267
01:06:30,621 --> 01:06:32,290
This is important!

1268
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:46,236
Fear not.

1269
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:48,638
I bring good tidings
of great joy.

1270
01:06:48,773 --> 01:06:51,976
For unto you is born
this day a savior,

1271
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:53,411
Christ, the Lord.

1272
01:06:56,814 --> 01:06:59,016
Told ya it was important.

1273
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:01,319
I'm sorry. There's no room.

1274
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:02,920
Sorry.

1275
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:04,188
I'm... I'm sorry.

1276
01:07:05,723 --> 01:07:08,659
Joseph, I can't go any further.

1277
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,672
All right, all right, Mary, here.

1278
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:12,663
Just...

1279
01:07:13,364 --> 01:07:14,699
Here. Lay here.

1280
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:18,970
Mary? Mary, look at me.

1281
01:07:19,804 --> 01:07:20,838
You're doing great.

1282
01:07:20,972 --> 01:07:23,240
Remember, God chose
us for a reason.

1283
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:24,908
This must be part of His plan.

1284
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,717
Help us. Help us.

1285
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:35,219
Please, God, help us.

1286
01:07:35,353 --> 01:07:37,255
Mary! Joseph!

1287
01:07:43,694 --> 01:07:45,029
Not good.

1288
01:07:47,165 --> 01:07:49,200
No, no, no, no,
that's not good at all.

1289
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,742
Bo?
Bo? You're back!

1290
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,152
Buddy, we need somewhere to go.

1291
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,959
Mary, let's go.

1292
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,533
Guys, guys.

1293
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:57,601
I found them.
We're all set.

1294
01:08:57,735 --> 01:09:00,037
It's not much, but
there's plenty of light.

1295
01:09:04,275 --> 01:09:06,377
No, no, no,
this isn't gonna work.

1296
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:07,630
We can't have the baby here.

1297
01:09:07,745 --> 01:09:09,056
Mary, we need stronger bedding.

1298
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,781
You know, we need warmer...
Joseph.

1299
01:09:12,783 --> 01:09:14,218
It's time.

1300
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,269
Thank you.

1301
01:09:36,307 --> 01:09:38,175
Well, well...

1302
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,176
Look who it is.

1303
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:42,623
We should've eaten him
the first time we met him.

1304
01:09:42,647 --> 01:09:45,549
But, Rufus, if we had eaten him,

1305
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,818
he would never have led us here.

1306
01:09:47,952 --> 01:09:50,020
We've been meaning to thank you.

1307
01:09:50,154 --> 01:09:53,656
Now, be a good little donkey
and run along.

1308
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,859
You've served your purpose.

1309
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:57,860
You guys are...
You guys are pretty scary.

1310
01:09:57,994 --> 01:10:00,063
Yeah. And you might be
stronger than I am.

1311
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:01,698
But if you wanna
get to my friends,

1312
01:10:01,832 --> 01:10:04,335
you're gonna have
to get past me first.

1313
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:05,569
No problem, donkey!

1314
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,872
Getting past you
is my middle name.

1315
01:10:08,906 --> 01:10:10,508
What is that?

1316
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:13,043
What's what? I wasn't
supposed to look, was I?

1317
01:10:13,177 --> 01:10:14,579
Donkey kick!

1318
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,715
You just made a big mistake.

1319
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,922
You're mine!

1320
01:10:49,013 --> 01:10:50,915
Not gonna let you do this!

1321
01:10:57,855 --> 01:10:59,323
No, no, no, no, no.

1322
01:11:07,097 --> 01:11:09,500
No. Mary! Joseph!

1323
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:12,470
Mary.

1324
01:11:12,603 --> 01:11:13,938
I'm sorry.

1325
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:16,106
Huh?
Huh?

1326
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,975
For the flock!

1327
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:29,787
Whoo-hoo!

1328
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:33,090
Coming at you, bro!

1329
01:11:49,273 --> 01:11:50,391
I don't wanna die!

1330
01:11:50,392 --> 01:11:51,509
Somebody, help.

1331
01:11:55,746 --> 01:11:57,148
It's just another cliff.

1332
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,488
Grab hold of this.

1333
01:12:05,956 --> 01:12:07,190
Come on.

1334
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:38,689
Bo?

1335
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:42,493
Bo, you're doing it.

1336
01:12:47,498 --> 01:12:49,734
Excellent climbing form, Bo.

1337
01:12:49,867 --> 01:12:51,469
Be the wedge.

1338
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:14,024
We're bad dogs.

1339
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:16,894
You don't have to be.

1340
01:13:17,594 --> 01:13:19,029
You're free now.

1341
01:13:21,432 --> 01:13:22,932
Bo, where are you going?

1342
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:24,401
We've got a baby to meet.

1343
01:13:24,535 --> 01:13:26,136
Come on.

1344
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,839
After all that,
it is a baby shower.

1345
01:13:28,973 --> 01:13:30,607
You were right the whole time.

1346
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,843
You had it right as well.
It is a birthday party.

1347
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:35,446
Literally, it's the day
of his birth.

1348
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:38,516
Mmm-hmm. I'm gonna let 'em
have this one.

and if we don't do something now,
then the baby's not gonna...

1365

Oh. Looks like...

1366
01:15:01,799 --> 01:15:03,167
Looks like you guys handled it.

1367
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,368
Sweet.

1368
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,505
This seat taken?

1369
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:10,040
Everyone,

1370
01:15:10,174 --> 01:15:11,674
this is Mary and Joseph.

1371
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:13,643
And that's their new baby.

1372
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:15,212
The flock is growing.

1373
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:21,051
No. Not happening.
Don't even think about it.

1374
01:15:31,295 --> 01:15:32,896
It's okay. Let them in.

1375
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,409
Look with your eyes.

1376
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:49,879
See?

1377
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:51,648
He's just a baby.

1378
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:53,717
Aw. Look at him.

1379
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,854
Thaddeus, are we good dogs now?

1380
01:15:56,987 --> 01:15:58,756
We have to try.

1381
01:16:12,035 --> 01:16:13,203
Um...

1382
01:16:13,336 --> 01:16:14,404
Is...

1383
01:16:14,538 --> 01:16:16,974
Uh, I'm sorry.
Is this your stable?

1384
01:16:18,108 --> 01:16:19,385
No, no, no.

1385
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:22,079
We've come to
honor the new king.

1386
01:16:22,212 --> 01:16:23,256
I'm sorry.

1387
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,449
King? Where? What, uh...

1388
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:27,084
What is he talking
about? A king?

1389
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:30,686
What's his name?

1390
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,456
His name is Jesus.

1391
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,059
For Jesus, gold.

1392
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:36,960
Myrrh.

1393
01:16:37,094 --> 01:16:38,862
Do you guys like frankincense?

1394
01:16:38,996 --> 01:16:40,931
I never know what to get.

1395
01:16:41,064 --> 01:16:42,266
Thank you.

1396
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:43,900

Guys, I carried

1403
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:12,962
We're never gonna hear
the end of this, are we?

1404
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:15,866
And I hope we never do.

1405
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:19,002
You know, I think people
are gonna remember this night.

1406
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,037
What happened here
around this manger

1407
01:17:21,171 --> 01:17:23,874
will be celebrated
for thousands of years.

1408
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:25,875
Families will come together

1409
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:28,511
and exchange presents
and sing carols.

1410
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:33,717
All to remember the grace of this moment
that we are witnessing right now.

1411
01:17:35,485 --> 01:17:37,154
