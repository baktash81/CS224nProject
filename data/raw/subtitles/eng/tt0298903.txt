00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,210
[wind blowing]

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,750
[peaceful music]

3
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,220
[train whistle blows]

4
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,570
[bell rings]

5
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,180
[indistinct chatter]

6
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,180
There you are!

7
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,450
MEOWW!

8
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,750
Oh no, you don't.

9
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,860
What are you doing out in the
market place all by yourself?

10
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,730
I'm old enough to look
after myself too.

11
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,660
That's what Aunt Dete says.
Anyway.

12
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,200
(Aunt Dete)
Bridget, have you
seen Heidi?

13
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,870
[gasps]
Shhh.

14
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,730
(Woman)
She was around earlier.
But...

15
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,440
(Woman)
She's an independent
little thing isn't she?

16
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,470
(Aunt Dete)
Hmmph. You wouldn't say that
if you had to look after her.

17
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,810
It's cost me a fortune
bringing her up.

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,380
I tell you, the last five
years I've had to

19
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,680
live like a pauper
because of that girl.

20
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,420
New hat?
Special occasion?

21
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,920
Yes.I've been offered
a position as a

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,150
lady's maid up
in Frankfurt.

23
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,490
Ooh Frankfurt is it?

24
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,290
Well I'm sure Heidi
will like it there.

25
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,730
Heidi! I'm not dragging
that millstone with me.

26
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,670
Ha. No. I've made other
arrangements for her.

27
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,970
[gasps]

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,670
[lively music]

29
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,010
Come back!

30
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,480
[screeches]

31
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,220
[gasps]

32
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,150
WHOA!

33
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,050
SMACK!

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
[screeches]
[Aunt Dete screams]

35
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,630
[coughs and sputters]

36
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,530
Ugh!

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
HA! AUNT DETE!

38
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,810
MY HAT!

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,010
[gasps]

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,420
(Aunt Dete)
HEIDI!!

41
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,320
Home. Now!

42
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,290
(Sighs ruefully)

43
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,930
My grandfather?

44
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,600
Yes, now keep still.

45
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,560
We'll miss the train
if we don't hurry.

46
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,670
And he lives up
a mountain?

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,170
I told you already.

48
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,300
With goats?

49
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,100
YES!

50
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,140
It sounds wonderful!

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,840
Oh, thank
you Aunt Dete!

52
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,080
[in disgust]
Oh!

53
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,110
Come on!

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,700
[adventurous music]

55
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,800
[train wheels clank]

56
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,570
What's my
Grandfather like?

57
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,740
He's... erm... well, I haven't
seen him for long time.

58
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,650
But he does know we're
coming doesn't he?

59
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,550
Amm... Not exactly.

60
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,780
Is it a surprise!

61
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,560
Yes that's it. It's a lovely
surprise for him.

62
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,390
[train whistle blows]

63
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,130
It's beautiful!

64
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,170
Much smaller than I
remember. And smellier.

65
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,880
Turk! Come back here!

66
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,480
Dete?

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Oh, Barbel.

68
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,350
How lovely to see you.

69
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,020
Oh! You look like
a proper lady!

70
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,620
(Barbel)
Oh, that can't
be Heidi!

71
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,930
Oh! She was just
a baby when you

72
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,430
left, and look
at her now!

73
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,170
Takes after her father more than
your sister, don't you think?

74
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,610
Oh, he was a
handsome man.

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,580
Poor little thing, losing
both parents so young.

76
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,250
Yes, yes, yes... well,
if you don't mind,

77
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,220
we have a long
climb ahead of us.

78
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,790
[gasps]
You're not taking her to
her GRANDFATHER

79
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,220
Why not? I can't waste my
life looking after her.

80
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,360
It's the old man's turn.
I've had her long enough.

81
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,460
[giggles]

82
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,930
But you don't know
what he's like now.

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,430
As unpleasant as ever I should
imagine.

84
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,930
Oh yes!

85
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,970
He never comes down
from the mountain

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,900
and if anyone goes
near his hut...

87
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,640
he chases
them away.

88
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,640
He won't speak
to anyone!

89
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,810
You can't leave a child with
someone like that!

90
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,340
It's none of your business.

91
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,080
(boy)
Turk, no!

92
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,280
Ah! My hat!

93
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,850
Heidi! Come back here!

94
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,290
[chuckles]
Uh, nice to see
you again.

95
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,030
[Turk's bell ringing]

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,340
[breathing heavy]

97
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,670
Wait for me!

98
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,340
[exhales]

99
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,410
[struggles]

100
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,350
[panting]

101
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,420
Heidi!

102
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,190
Ohh!

103
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,730
[giggles]

104
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,830
That's Aunt Dete's
favorite hat!

105
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,530
(giggles)

106
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,640
Turk likes it too.

107
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,500
[laughs]
I'm Heidi.

108
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,270
Peter.

109
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,740
[giggles]
They're tickly.

110
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,150
They're just goats.

111
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,450
Come on now shoo.

112
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,850
Sorry, I've got to get going.
Work, you know.

113
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,550
Where are you taking them?

114
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,620
To the pasture up there.

115
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,820
That's where I'm going.

116
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,660
I've come to live with my
grandfather.

117
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,130
Not the Old Man?

118
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,700
Yes. What's wrong with that?

119
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,970
Everyone round here is a bit
scared of him.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,330
Scared of him?

121
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,900
Yeah. Apart from me of course.

122
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,600
I look after his goat.

123
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,240
He's alright when you
get to know him.

124
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,440
He just doesn't
like talking much.

125
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,380
Well that doesn't
sound so bad.

126
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,050
We'd better go.

127
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,480
Come on now.

128
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,180
Come on.

129
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,950
Hmm?

130
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,060
Come on TURK!

131
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,190
[bleats]

132
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,000
TURK, NO!

133
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,400
Oof.

134
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,430
[chuckles]

135
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,240
[panting]

136
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,840
My hat!

137
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,450
I hate this mountain.

138
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,360
[grunts]

139
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,960
[Peter whistles]

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
[whistles]

141
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,030
Peter, where have
you been?

142
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,270
I've waited
half the day...

143
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,740
What's this girl
doing here?

144
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,970
Hello... You must be my
Grandfather.

145
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,340
Huh, wha-?!

146
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,610
(Aunt Dete)
Hellooooo!

147
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,680
Ugh...
Good morning old man.

148
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,650
What are you
doing here?

149
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,390
I have a job
in Frankfurt.

150
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,320
I can't take the
child with me.

151
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,220
I've looked after
her since...

152
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,230
Well, it's your turn.

153
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,690
My turn, is it?

154
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,760
I don't want her here!
Take her back!

155
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,530
Don't want her?

156
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,570
She's your flesh
and blood.

157
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,700
I can't raise
a little girl!

158
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,900
Look at her.

159
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,640
She's the spitting
image of her father.

160
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,810
I don't want to
look at her.

161
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,350
You wouldn't want to see her
in an orphanage, would you?

162
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,080
Your own
son's child.

163
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,590
I... She's your
sister's child too.

164
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,730
Yes and I have done my duty
by her. Now you do yours.

165
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,030
(OS)Goodbye, Heidi!

166
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,760
Goodbye... Aunt Dete.

167
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,870
I... er... well.

168
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,470
I, uh... have to get
up to the meadow.

169
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,070
See you later, Heidi.

170
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,710
Maybe.

171
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,840
I... I... Won't be any
trouble grandfather.

172
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,250
[disgusted]
Ah...

173
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,130
That's for you.

174
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,670
[yawns]

175
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,150
Thank you Grandfather.

176
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,080
[grumbles]
Eh...

177
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,890
Mmmmm... that's the best
milk I ever tasted!

178
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,620
Goat's milk. Best
thing for you.

179
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,530
Why aren't you eating?

180
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,500
[yawns]
I'm just not very
hungry, Grandfather.

181
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,870
That's the best cheese
on the mountain!

182
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,750
You can't sleep there.

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,800
[distant low rumble]
Huhh?!

364
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
Head for the trees!
RUN!

365
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,940
What?

366
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,110
[rumbling]

367
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,490
HELP!

368
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,760
[shrieks]

369
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,330
[rumbling]

370
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,040
Heidi!

371
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,010
Heidi???

372
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,030
[sputtering]

373
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,830
Heidi?

374
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,440
[sighs in relief]

375
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,140
Whoa!

376
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,740
Oh Grandfather.

377
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,640
Oh...
You're safe now.

378
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,950
(Peter)
Heidi!

379
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,230
Yes.

380
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm here about the ad
in the paper.

381
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,310
Pleased to meet you.
Please take a seat.

382
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,050
I'm worried that my
daughter is missing out

383
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
by not having friends
her own age.

384
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,920
Oh yes of course
Herr Sesemann.

385
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,090
I completely understand.

386
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,490
I'm sure you'll find my
niece the perfect

387
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,560
companion for your daughter.

388
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,830
Yes, yes indeed.

389
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,560
Klara is a delicate girl,

390
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,500
I want to make sure I
find her a gentle,

391
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,530
kind child, some one
who can make her laugh,

392
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,770
(Aunt Dete)
Ugh...

393
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,040
(man continues)
be her friend.

394
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,340
I think she finds life here
rather dull and stuffy.

395
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,510
Yes, as I said,
I understand.

396
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,180
Now. The ad mentioned a fee.

397
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,650
How much money would we
be talking about exactly?

398
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:39,520
[grandfather chuckles]
Now keep your
eyes closed.

399
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,630
And open!

400
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,100
OH! She's so sweet!

401
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,270
She belongs to you.

402
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,600
For my very own?

403
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,940
Your very own.

404
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,640
But you must learn how to
care for her properly.

405
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,540
I will. I promise, I will.

406
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,850
There's just, er one matter
still to be settled.

407
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,650
That's, her name.

408
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,920
[baaas]
Her hair is so soft --

409
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,390
I think I'll call
her Silky.

410
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,490
You like that,
don't you?

411
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,890
[grunts]

412
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,470
[clears throat]
Uh... I think she's hungry.

413
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,370
Take Little Swan back to her
stall so she can feed her.

414
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,740
Hey.

415
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,140
[giggles]
Stop that!

416
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,880
[sinister music]

417
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,710
What are you
doing here?

418
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,820
Don't worry I'm not stopping.

419
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,290
I just want the child.
Where is she?

420
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,450
She belongs here now.

421
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,090
What? That's ridiculous!
You didn't even want her.

422
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,360
Anyway it's all arranged.

423
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,830
She's to be the
companion for a

424
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,760
wealthy little girl
in Frankfurt.

425
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,660
It's a wonderful
opportunity for her.

426
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,370
Er, what's in it for you?

427
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,770
Nothing! My only concern
is Heidi's future!

428
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,540
Which isn't going to amount to
much if she stays here with you!

429
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,010
After all, you didn't
give her parents

430
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,950
much of a future
did you?

431
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,080
Er, that wasn't my fault!

432
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,890
That's not what they
say in the village.

433
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,090
I don't care
what they say!

434
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,160
You built the house.

435
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,430
I didn't start the avalanche.
The mountain took them.

436
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,130
Well that's my point! Heidi's
not safe here.

437
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,870
Can you protect HER
from the mountain?

438
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,370
The Sesemann's can provide her
with things you never could.

439
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,910
Why she might even get
some education.

440
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,710
That's enough!

441
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,350
I'll pack her things while
you say your goodbyes.

442
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,490
I can't say goodbye.
Just take her.

443
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,030
[gasps]
Aunt Dete!

444
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,700
Where's Grandfather?
What's wrong?

445
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,910
Nothing's wrong. You're going
to the city with me.

446
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,840
But I don't want to
go to the city!

447
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,280
Grandfather!
GRANDFATHER!

448
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,910
[struggling]

449
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,780
Your Grandfather
agrees with me.

450
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,150
It's for the best,
you'll love Frankfurt.

451
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,720
You're going to live
in a big house

452
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,420
and you'll have
a new friend.

453
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,590
I've got friends, I've got
Peter and Granny and...

454
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,790
A goat boy and
an old woman!

455
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,160
Mr. Sesemann's daughter
is a lady.

456
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,900
She'll teach you manners.
Now COME ON!

457
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,730
But Grandfather! I haven't
said goodbye.

458
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,700
He said he was too
busy to say goodbye.

459
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,740
Too busy?
Oh.

460
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,120
All aboard for
Frankfurt!

461
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,120
[blows whistle]

462
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,530
[train chugs]

463
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,100
HEIDI!
HEIDI!

464
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,370
Open the window.

465
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,440
I knew they wouldn't let me go
without saying goodbye.

466
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,640
GRANDFATHER! PETER!

467
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,940
Heidi! Here take this.

468
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,080
(Peter)
So you don't forget us.

469
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,920
I'll never forget you!

470
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,390
Oh, spare me please.

471
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,590
Oh!

472
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,790
HEIDI!

473
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,330
Auf weidersehen!

474
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,490
AUF WIEDERSEHEN!

475
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,400
GRANDFATHER! PETER, take
care of Silky for me!

476
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,000
I will, bye Heidi!

477
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,070
Bye, Peter!

478
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,340
Bye, bye!

479
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,010
[train whistle]

480
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,350
[honking]

481
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,850
[city sounds]

482
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,200
Good morning Madam
can I help you?

483
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,840
I'm here to see Fraulein
Rottenmeir. I have the child.

484
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,440
So I see Madam.

485
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,220
Stop that and stand
up straight!

486
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,360
And smile!

487
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,700
[coughing]

488
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,470
This is the child I
promised Herr Sesemann.

489
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,370
As you can see she
will make a most

490
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,480
charming companion for
young... erm, his daughter.

491
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,710
Klara.

492
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,550
That's a nice name.
I'm Heidi.

493
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,320
Heidi? What a
silly name.

494
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,350
She's rather young.

495
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,720
What books has
she read?

496
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,590
None. I don't know
how to read yet,

497
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,260
Aunt Dete said I
would learn here.

498
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,290
Oof!

499
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,990
(Fraulein Rottenmeir)
She can't read?

500
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,000
That's not what we agreed
on. Take her away.

501
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,500
Herr Sesemann asked
me to find a simple,

502
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,070
unsophisticated
child, and Heidi

503
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,270
fits that description
perfectly.

504
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,240
(Fraulein Rottenmeir)
She is a country
bumpkin!

505
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,410
What on earth could she
and Klara have in common?

506
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,640
That's your problem.

507
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,810
Herr Sesemann paid
me to find him

508
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,250
a child and
here she is.

509
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,550
Good day!

510
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,460
Sebastian?!

511
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,430
Tinette, take her "things"
to her room

512
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,270
and find her something
decent to wear!

513
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,170
Yes Fraulein.

514
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,710
Sebastian! Put her in the
parlour until dinner.

515
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,360
[clock ticking]

516
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,270
[bell chimes]

517
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,450
[bell rings]

518
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,890
[giggling]
Weeee!

519
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,560
Huh?

520
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,130
I'm sorry! I didn't
see you there.

521
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,630
I'm Heidi. Are you
my new friend?

522
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,930
I don't have friends. Just
people who work for papa.

523
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,600
Your chair!

524
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,800
It's horrible
isn't it?

525
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,140
No! It's wonderful.

526
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,910
You don't have to
sit in it all day.

527
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,180
I hate it.

528
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,750
Oh.

529
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,850
I like your book.

530
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,750
You may read it to
me if you like.

531
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,090
Oh no. I
can't read.

532
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,690
I don't
know how.

533
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,960
Ha, you're not going
to be a very good

534
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:27,190
"new friend"
then, are you?

535
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,660
Achem. Dinner is served,
Miss Klara.

536
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,800
Come on, you do know
how to push don't you?

537
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,250
[slurps]

538
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,050
Has no one taught you the
proper way to eat girl?

539
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,660
No Fraulien Rottenmeier.
I taught myself!

That much is obvious!

543
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,940
In this house we do not tear
our meals apart with a fork.

544
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,570
We cut them into small, ladylike
mouthfuls with a knife.

545
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,610
Like so.

546
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,850
A fish knife.

547
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,450
This child has no table
manners whatsoever.

548
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,690
She is a most
unsuitable companion.

549

[with mouthful]
Sorry Fraulein Rottenmeier.

550
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,470
And we don't talk
with our mouthful.

551
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Especially when we
are eating fish.

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,600
Sorry Fraulein Rottenmeier.

554

Why do we not talk with
our mouthful

555
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,680
when we are eating
fish, Klara?

556
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,810
Because we may get a fishbone
stuck in our throat.

557
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,550
Precisely.

558
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,180

562
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,230
Stop that child.

563
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,460
Are you alright
Fraulein Rottenmeier?

564
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Yes I'm fine.

565
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,030
Was it a fishbone?

566
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,270
No it was not.
It was just...

567

[cough]

568
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,210
Actually I'm feeling
a little faint.

569
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,740
Maybe Madam would like me
to call Doctor Reboux.

570
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,450
That will not be
necessary, Sebastian.

571
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,450
Although I think I may
go and lie down.

572
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,560

of me. She has to go.

(Sebastian)
Ahem. I hope dinner was
to your liking ladies.

575
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,540
Oh yes it was lovely,
thank you.

576
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,210
Yes I enjoyed it too.

577
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,340
I enjoyed it very much.

dressed yet?

Hurry up!

585
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,980
Klara's waiting.

586

Hmm...

587
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,720
There you are. Where
have you been?

588
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,790
Where could I go to see across
the whole city?

589
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,430
How would I know? When do I go
to the city?

590
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,430
Well, what's the tallest
building?

591
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,500
Oh, the church tower, I suppose.
The one with the golden dome.

592
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,270
Oh, thank you Klara.

Have you heard anything
from Heidi?

Granny's been asking
after her again.

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,860
I apologize, Dr Reboux.

610
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,230
I had wanted you to inspect
Klara's new [sniff] companion.

611
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,140
We don't want her
infecting Klara

612
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,970
with some
mountain illness.

613
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,240
However, the wretched
urchin has disappeared.

Very badly
indeed.

I'm sorry. It was
an accident.

out! Is that clear?

Where did you go
this morning?

(Heidi)
To the church.

662
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,910
I climbed all the way to
the top of the tower

663
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,510
but I couldn't find my
mountain anywhere.

664

We're a long way from
Switzerland.

That's where you're
from isn't it?

It's this chair, I can't
even chase a kitten!

00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,460
[sighs]
It's nothing like the mountain.

720
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:12,000
No grass, no goats, no...

721
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,970
...Listen, sometimes we do this.

722
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,600
KLAAAAAAARRRRRRRR-AAAAAA!

723
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,070
[coughs]

724
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,810
You shout at the person
next to you?

725
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,810
There's supposed to be an echo.

726
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,450
Are you alright?

727
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,220
[sighs]

728
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:37,890
How could you leave Klara
alone outside with that,

729
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,520
that wild
creature?

730
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,400
Please, allow me...

731
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,640
I'm fine, Fraulein Rottenmeier.

732
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:57,010
Go to your room and
pack your things.

733
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,380
I don't want you in this
house another minute!

734
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:01,980
(Klara)
NO!

735
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:07,120
As for you, Klara, we will
discuss your behaviour later.

736
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,290
Take her to the parlour.

737
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,490
I said NOOO!

738
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,900
I'm sick of the way you
keep me prisoner here.

739
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,470
I'm sick of the way you've
arranged my life...

740
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,900
For your own good!

741
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,240
Because it's easier for you!

742
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:28,210
Klara! How could you
think that?

743
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,780
Nothing interesting ever
happened until Heidi came.

744
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,850
That child is a threat
to your health.

745
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,310
The sooner she
leaves the better.

746
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:42,420
Heidi stays. Or I'll tell my
father how upset you've made me.

747
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,620
You know how delicate I am.

748
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,760
The slightest little thing
can set me back...

749
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,800
Ah!

750
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,400
Hmph.

751
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:09,050
Heidi? What are you doing?

752
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,210
Oh! Klara!

753
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:13,650
I was just coming to say
goodbye. I'm going home.

754
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,020
Oh no, you're staying!

755
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,890
Don't worry about Rottenmeir,
I've taken care of her.

756
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,060
We are going to have so
much fun together...

757
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,500
You can take me out
everyday and...

758
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,730
Heidi, what's
wrong?

759
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,170
I... I want to
go Klara.

760
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,300
I need to go back
to the mountains.

761
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,270
But what about me? You
can't leave me now.

762
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,840
I'll miss you
terribly.

763
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,340
But I miss Grandfather
and Peter and...

764
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,980
...everyone!

765
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,010
Go then.

766
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,480
Everyone else I
love leaves me,

767
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,620
why should you be
any different.

768
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:49,450
Oh Klara, I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings. I'm sorry.

769
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:56,160
No I'm sorry. It's just... I was
so lonely before you came...

770
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,930
Can't you just stay a little
while longer?

771
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,600
Just until Papa comes
to visit next month.

772
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,830
I think I could
bare it then.

773
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:07,240
I know! In return I can teach
you to read and write.

774
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,140
Then when I go back I'll be able
to read to Peter's Granny.

775
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,180
She'll be so happy.

776
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,980
I'll stay.

777
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,550
That's settled then.

778
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,780
Now tell me about all your
friends on the mountain.

779
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,350
Let's see there's Peter
and his Grandma,

780
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,520
your Grandfather...

781
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,060
...And Silky and Turk.

782
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,490
Turk's a naughty goat.
You'd like him.

783
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,830
Then there's Silky.

784
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,160
She's my goat. Grandfather
gave her to me.

785
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,440
But... up...
the... stairs!

786
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:41,940
[giggles]

787
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,880
[devious music]

788
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,040
I named the kittens.

789
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,910
One's called Red and
one's called Blue.

790
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:49,850
Red and Blue

791
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,550
[laughing]

792
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,350
BANG!
BANG!

793
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,570
[wind starts to
blow heavily]

794
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,900
[thunder cracks]

795
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,070
Ah!
Uh! Ah!

796
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,740
Oh Sebastian!

797
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,170
What are you doing
lurking there?

798
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,380
Apologies Fraulien I was just
going to close the window.

799
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,950
I fear that the latch
needs replacing.

800
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,680
Or we have intruders!

801
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,790
I would think that
unlikely in such

802
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,360
inclement
conditions madam.

803
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,120
[screaming]

804
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,730
[stairs creak]

805
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:43,370
I... I... It... It....

806
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,940
What is it girl?

807
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:48,310
THE GHOST! Haa!

808
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,340
Ghost indeed.

809
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,240
SLAM!
SLAM!

810
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,680
SLAM!

811
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,690
As I said madam, just
a loose window.

812
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,850
All the same,

813
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,190
I think you should check the
house from top to bottom.

814
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,730
An intruder could easily have
climbed in through there.

815
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,560
We could have all been
murdered in our beds.

816
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,730
Oh!

817
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,670
KLARA!

818
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,970
Ha! Oh it's just you.

819
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,440
I heard a
scream.

820
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,710
Oh that girl Tinette.

821
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,140
She thought she
saw a ghost.

822
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,510
A ghost!

823
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,350
There are no such
things as ghosts.

824
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,320
There is a ghost.
Behind you!

825
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,020
[gasps]

826
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,620
[thunder cracks]

827
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,600
Klara!

828
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,800
Hmm, very peculiar!

829
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,710
I've never seen
anything like it!

830
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,740
Wait, now I know
what it is...

831
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,210
It's a smile!

832
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,580
[giggles]
Oh Papa!

833
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,020
And you must be HEIDI.

834
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,390
Are you responsible for all
this terrible grinning?

835
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,450
[laughs]

836
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,420
I hear you've been taking
Klara out into the town

837
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,120
and bringing flea-ridden
animals into the house.

838
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,730
They're not flea-ridden!

839
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,760
I'm sure they're not.

840
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,630
Well whatever you two
have been up to,

841
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,930
it's had a marvellous
effect on you Klara.

842
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,700
[both chuckle]

843
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,170
Now what's all this
about... a ghost?

844
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,710
It comes in through
the upstairs window.

845
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,410
Everybody in the
house is too afraid

846
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,280
to leave their
rooms at night.

847
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,710
Fraulein Rottenmeir
locks herself in.

848
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,250
Does she indeed.

849
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,120
And have you been visited by
this mysterious phantom Heidi?

850
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,650
No, Herr Sesemann.

851
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:43,390
And I don't
want to be.

852
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,390
Well ladies do not fear.

853
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,390
Sesemann the ghost
hunter is here.

854
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,890
With my fearless assistant
Dr. Reboux, I will confront

855
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:53,800
the ghoul this very evening
and banish it forever!

856
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,310
Quite a mystery, eh doctor?

857
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,240
But surely you don't think...

858
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,280
That the house is actually
haunted?

859
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,250
No of course not,
but something

860
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,810
strange is going on.

861
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:13,120
(Dr Reboux)
Indeed, but I'm sure
it will have a

862
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,620
perfectly rational
explanation.

863
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:19,890
(Herr Sesemann)
Only time will tell doctor.
Only time will tell.

864
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,090

865
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,930

00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,330
Ha!
Dr Reboux.

867
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,530
Where?

868
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:29,670
Shhh!
Huh!

869
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,600
That came from the street!

870
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,640
CRASH!

871
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,850
It is a ghost.

872
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,520
No...

873
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,950
It's Heidi!

Isn't there anything you
can do for her doctor?

901
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,520
If you mean a medicine or
treatment...

902

No I'm afraid not.

903
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,250
I think what we
have here is a

904
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:32,190
simple case of
homesickness.

905
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,160
Then she must return home
to the mountain.

906
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,060
Klara won't be happy
about that.

No... No she won't.

But why? I want her
to stay here.

If Heidi goes I shall...
I shall DIE!

910
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:52,810
There, there. Heidi nearly
did die tonight.

911
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,880
You wouldn't want
that would you?

912
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:57,480
No, of course not but...

913
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,690
I'll tell you what, Klara. You
can visit her anytime you like.

914
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,620
Visit her? Really?

915
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,990
Yeah.

We have a little present
for you, Heidi.

918
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:19,240
No. Wait until you get
back your Grandfather.

919
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,240
He'll know what to
do with it.

00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,540
Ha!

922
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,510
Thank you very much,
Herr Sesemann.

923
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:30,310
I thought your Grandfather
might be interested in this.

924
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,450
It's a book!

925
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,250
You've all been
so kind to me.

926
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,450
I haven't got anything to
give you. Oh wait.

927
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,920
Here, you'd better have this. So
you don't forget me.

I'll never forget YOU Heidi.

You will come and visit soon
won't you Klara?

The good Doctor here will
accompany Klara

Once the snows have melted.
Now come on Heidi.

00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,610
We'd better get going if we're
going to catch that train.

Goodbye Klara.

What's this?

00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,170
Herr SESEMANN said you'd
know what to do with it.

952
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:05,880
Hmmph. Is there anything
you'd like to buy with it?

like to do now?

Peter a surprise.

see Herr Sesemann.

Herr Sesemann is
away on business.

Where's my money? I thought this
was a respectable household.

If you don't pay up,
immediately,

00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,210
I will take legal
action.

Heidi is no longer in
employment here.

00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,380
What about
my money?

child has returned

976

where she belongs.

you off to everyone.

There. Now who shall
I meet first?

1008
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,730
I know! What about
Silky and Turk?

1009
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:47,230
It was most kind of you to
agree to our visit.

1010
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:51,200

the change that's come over her!

I think young Heidi might have
something to do with it too.

She's a remarkable child.

1015
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,450
Now, perhaps you
could identify

1016
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,850
some of these beautiful
flowers for me...

1017
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,320
Are you sure she'll
be all right?

1018

Don't worry, Peter's nearby.

much about you

I feel like I know
you already.

Shall we go and
have lunch?

likes lunch!

Come on help me set it out.

1041
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,790
You'll have to move
my chair closer.

1042
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:24,590
You're so much stronger since
you arrived on the mountain.

1043
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:27,830
Why don't you try to
stand up? I'll help you.

1044
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,330
Even if you fall
down, so what? Ugh.

1045
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,740
The grass is nice and soft.

1047
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,250
All right.

01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,330
You did it!

01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,500
[laughs]
I did it!

1052
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,030
You did it!

1053
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,400
Let's have lunch!

[laughing]

1055
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,070
We'll have you running up
and down the mountain

1056
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:07,100
like Little Swan before
you know it.

1057
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,770
I think it might take a
little longer than that.

1058
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:14,010
We've got the whole spring. It's
going to be the best time ever.

1059
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,950
Nothing is going
to spoil it.

1060
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:19,720
That's right! Nothing is going
to spoil it. Uh, um good.

1061
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,460
Wooo a wo arrgh!

I can't believe how strong and
healthy Klara looks.

1067
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,480
It's not just the
mountain air.

1068
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,650
Ha ha. Goat's milk.

1069
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,120
It's not just the milk either.
What's your secret?

1070
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:30,450
You already know, Doctor. Simple
remedies from nature.

1071
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:32,490
It's what the goats eat
that makes

1072
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,460
their milk so
good for her.

1073
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,490
Go on,
I'll show you.
