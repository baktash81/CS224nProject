<i>Honey,
why don't you make us some coffee?</i>

3
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,608
<i>Yeah?</i>

4
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,610
<i>I will be right there.</i>

00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:12,544
I will be right there.

00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:14,751
I will be right there.

7
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:19,052
<i>Jamie, you be careful.</i>

8
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:23,590
Jamie, you be careful.

9
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:25,528
You be careful.

10
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:28,495
<i>Hey, how you doin'?</i>

11
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:30,663
Hey, how you doin'?

12
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:32,499
<i>Hey, how you doin'?</i>

13
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,501
Hey, how you doin'?
How you doin'?

14
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:38,037
<i>That's fine.
I'll take a cab.</i>

15
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:41,007
<i>Okay. Okay, then.
I'll see you later.</i>

16
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:42,110
Okay, then.

17
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,745
<i>Hey, how you doin'?</i>

18
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:48,281
Hey, how you doin'?
How you doin'?

19
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:52,786
<i>Hey, how you doin'?</i>

20
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:54,721
<i>Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.</i>

21
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:57,857
<i>What did you do?
What did you do?</i>

22
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:00,192
<i>Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.</i>

23
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:01,995
<i>What did you do?</i>

24
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,631
Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
What did you do?

25
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:07,202
What did you do?

26
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:12,506
<i>Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
What did you do?</i>

27
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,743
<i>Dinner's ready, honey.</i>

28
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:22,451
Mom.

29
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:28,223
<i>You hear me, honey?</i>

30
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:46,209
I will be right there.

31
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,901
- Hello, Bart.
- Hey, how you doin'?

32
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:56,336
Well, I'm fine.
How are you doin'?

33
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:59,639
Well, that's
a very complicated question.

34
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,808
- Right.
- Could take a while to answer.

35
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,743
Yeah, let it go.

36
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:05,611
Yeah, good choice.

37
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:07,147
Well, you take it easy.

38
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:09,718
It should be pretty quiet.
We're pretty empty.

39
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:13,654
But things
are improving.

40
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:14,921
- Are they?
- Yes.

41
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:17,289
The summer
travel season's here.

42
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,026
Wow. That's certainly
good news, Bart.

43
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:22,228
- Yes, it is.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

44
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,098
- You have a good night.
- You have a good night.

45
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,156
Hello?

46
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:25,226
- Boo! How you doin'?
- Oh, my God!

47
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:27,594
You scared me.

48
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,762
What were you doing
under the...

49
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:32,764
Oh, there was
a connection that I...

50
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,601
I wasn't expecting...

51
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,469
It's very late.

52
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,639
Yes. Is that a problem?

53
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,440
Oh, no, no.

54
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:42,608
So, can I help you?

55
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,012
Um, yeah, thanks.

56
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:47,680
You have a reservation
for, uh, Perretti?

57
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:49,382
I think that's the name
it's under.

58
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:53,719
Yes. King suite,
non-smoking, garden view.

59
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,924
One night, $219 with tax.

60
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:57,791
Yeah.

61
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:59,558
That sounds right.

62
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,161
Is it a nice room?

63
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:04,764
"The king suite is a modern,
light, and spacious room

64
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,800
with a view of
the green surroundings

65
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:08,368
and a luxurious rain shower.

66
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,702

by its modern and spacious feel.

68
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,906
An eye for design
goes hand-in-hand

69
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,909
with its light and bright
elegant effect.

70
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,478
Air conditioning,

74
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,023
Well, sounds perfect.

75
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,824
Thank you.

76
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:34,526
Room 109.

77
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:35,695
One key or two?

78
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:37,763
One. Uh, two.

79
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:39,168
Thanks.

80
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:54,446
- Wait. Uh, wrong room.
- What?

81
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:56,949
Room 124. Nicer.

82
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:59,219
French doors provide
access to the pool area.

83
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,023
Swell.

84
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:05,624
Straight down the hall
to the right.

85
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:09,228
Checkout is at noon, so...

86
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,563
Thank you.

87
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:12,802
You be careful.

88
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:21,300
- <i>Surprise.</i>
- <i>Jesu.</i>

89
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:23,402
<i>You are surprised,
aren't you?</i>

90
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:27,239
<i>A little disappointed,
I would imagine.</i>

91
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,077
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

92
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,012
What are you doing here?

93
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:34,314
<i>You left your cell phone.</i>

94
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:36,483
<i>That isn't mine.</i>

95
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,051
<i>Yes, it is.
Your other phone.</i>

96
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,923
- <i>Don't lie. It's insulting.</i>
- Hey, Bart.

97
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:48,027
What is that? Porn?

98
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,829
No. No, no, no. Just...

99
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:53,398
Looked like one of our rooms.
They shooting porn here now?

100
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,968
No.

101
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,036
- You're early.
- Yeah.

102
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:59,140
You can take off
if you want.

103
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,575
How are you, Bart?

104
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,777
That's a very complicated
question,

105
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,078
and it could take me a long...

106
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,479
Take a long time
to answer, right.

107
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:09,714
So unless
you really wanna know...

108
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:10,983
Yeah, forget it.

109
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:12,185
I'll see you around.

110
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:15,157
Yes, okay, then.

111
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:22,061
See you tomorrow.

112
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:23,128
See you tomorrow.

113
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,765
That's what I said.

114
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,135
Yeah.

115
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:35,977
Go on, get out of here.

116
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,681
See you tomorrow.

117
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:12,581
That shirt
is really annoying.

118
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,081
The colors are very bright,

119
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,619
and the stripes are
making me really dizzy.

120
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,555
So...

121
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:24,824
Okay, well...

122
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,295
fuck you.

123
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,362
Thank you.

124
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:33,199
<i>I sent her a text from you.
She isn't coming.</i>

125
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,667
- <i>She isn't?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

126
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:38,070
<i>Told her
you couldn't make it.</i>

127
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:40,042
<i>Had to cancel.</i>

128
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:44,045
<i>This is our date.</i>

129
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,682
This is our date.

130
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,419
<i>We could pretend that...</i>

131
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:55,057
<i>that you love me.</i>

132
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,360
<i>That I love you too.</i>

133
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:06,100
<i>Okay. We're not in love.</i>

134
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,837
<i>We could pretend
like I'm just some...</i>

135
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:15,407
<i>easy piece of ass
that you meet in a hotel.</i>

136
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:17,576
<i>Regularly. Secretly.</i>

137
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:20,313
<i>A fuck buddy,
whatever they call it.</i>

138
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:22,047
- <i>Is that what she is?</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

139
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:25,350
<i>Shut up.</i>

140
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:42,638
<i>Mercer Hotel.
Can I help you?</i>

141
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:46,104
<i>Hello?</i>

142
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,509
<i>Hello?</i>

143
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:50,745
Uh, uh...

144
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,718
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

145
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,322
I'm okay. I'm okay.

146
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,258
Come on. come on.

147
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,294
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

148
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:11,100
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

149
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:06,855
Bart!

150
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:10,292
I think this person
might be dead.

151
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:13,761
Jesus.

152
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:17,698
All right.

153
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,367
All right, uh...

154
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:25,103
Don't touch anything.

155
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:27,341
I'll call 911.

156
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:54,459
Bart was a good
candidate for the job.

157
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:56,963
The company has
a policy of hiring,

158
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:59,198
well, whenever they can.

159
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,032
He's not Mr. Personality,
okay?

160
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:02,835
I mean, he has kind of
an odd way about him,

161
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:04,204
you know,
with people, but...

162
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:05,738
So how long
has he been here?

163
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,977
Uh, two, three years.
Almost three now.

164
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,978
Any trouble?

165
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,083
No, no, he's very smart
and very capable.

166
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:18,150
Thanks.

167
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:19,554
You're welcome.

168
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:29,831
I forgot my wallet.

169
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:33,533
Excuse me?

170
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,199
I finished my shift.
It was 4:00 a.m.

171
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:38,103
Well, actually around 3:45 a.m.
because Jack was early.

172
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:40,739
My shift is eight to four.
Jack is my relief.

173
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:43,042
But this morning he was early.
I don't really know why.

174
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:45,544
You'd have to ask him about that
because I didn't ask him,

175
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,846
so I don't really know
the reason why he was early,

176
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:49,547
but he was.

177
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,051
And so I left 15 minutes
before my shift was over,

178
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,018
and I drove home by way
of Reynolds Boulevard

179
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,321
and Arena Drive,

180
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:56,756
and I took a right
on Eighth Avenue

181
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:59,290
and then a left
on Jay Street to number 433,

182
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:00,927
which is where I live.

183
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:02,594
Bart, right? Bart?

184
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:05,030
And I stopped and got
some ice cream on the way home.

185
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,365
And when I got there,
I ate the ice cream,

186
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:10,303
and I watched...
I watched...

187
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:12,305
I watched TV.

188
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,707
And I realized
I didn't have my wallet,

189
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:16,843
that I must have left it
here at the hotel,

190
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,577
so I had to come back
and get my wallet

191
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,013
because a wallet
is a very important thing

192
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,785
that you should never lose
or leave or forget.

193
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:27,085
- Wow.
- Yeah.

194
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:28,789
So I did.

195
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,790
So did you find it?

196
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,895
Near the vending machines,
right where I left it.

197
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,703
Such a terrible thing, huh?

198
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,106
This is a terrible thing.

199
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,241
- How old are you?
- 23.

200
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,543
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

201
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:53,746
Ever had a girlfriend?

202
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:54,915
No.

203
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,182
Boyfriend?

204
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:58,953
No.

205
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,625
Do you think about sex?

206
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,564
That is also
a very complicated question.

207
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:13,600
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I know, believe me.

208
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,500
And it could take me
a long time to answer it,

209
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:18,571
but in case you are inquiring
for your own personal reasons,

210
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:21,643
you should know that
I am not interested.

211
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:24,910
In what?

212
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:28,917
In any sexual activities
that involve older men like you.

213
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:32,684
Got it, got it.

214
00:19:32,686 --> 00:19:35,723
What about older women?

215
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:39,627
Does that
get you going, huh?

216
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:44,831
Okay so, um...

217
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,632
so you went home, and you
came back for the wallet.

218
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:49,200
That's the story?

219
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:50,769
Yes.

220
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:55,440
Well, your coworker says
that he never saw you leave.

221
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:56,642
- Jack?
- Yeah.

222
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:58,978
As a matter of fact,
he even said

223
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,247
your car was
still in the parking lot

224
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:02,715
before he heard the gunshot,

225
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:06,017
and that it's possible
that you never left.

226
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,688
I went home early,
around 3:45 a.m.,

227
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,124
and then I came back
through the side entrance.

228
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:14,293
But why, Bart, why?

229
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,730
Why not just come in
through the front door?

230
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:22,537
Because the side entrance is
closer to the vending machines.

231
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:26,007
Okay. Okay, I buy that.

232
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:31,179
Hey, Bart, you know you got
blood on your hands, right?

233
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:35,581
Yes, I was interested
in the blood, so I touched it.

234
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:39,117
Her blood? The blood
is interesting to you?

235
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,821
Yes.

236
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,226
Look, I know you got issues.

237
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:48,693
Yes. Yes, I do.

238
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:50,796
I know you do, I know it,
and it's called...

239
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,465
Asperger's. I'm an Aspie.

240
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:55,100
That's a psychological condition

241
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:57,870
that is normally
or abnormally characterized

242
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:01,673
by abnormalities of social
communication and interaction.

243
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:03,875
An Aspie tends to
approach others awkwardly

244
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:07,613
and may engage in frequent
one-sided long-winded speeches,

245
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:09,949
such as this one,
about a specific topic,

246
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:11,918
while misunderstanding
and not recognizing

247
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,019
the listener's
feelings or reactions.

248
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:15,720
- Hey, Bart.
- ...thinks the person will stop talking.

249
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:18,857
Bart. Bart, please.
Can you just take a breath?

250
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:21,794
- Can you take a breath for me?
- And then...

251
00:21:21,796 --> 00:21:24,330
Bart, you're a very smart guy,

252
00:21:24,332 --> 00:21:27,333
and yet what you're saying
to me doesn't make sense.

253
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:28,734
Why not?

254
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:31,004
Why not? Because...

255
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,738
Because why would you
leave your wallet

256
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,007
near the vending machine,

257
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:37,776
and if you didn't
have your wallet,

258
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:40,015
how did you pay
for the ice cream?

259
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:47,556
I'm gonna need you to come
down and identify your wife.

260
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,892
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's routine.

261
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:57,196
But, you know,
it's important.

262
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:59,765
Maybe it's not her.

263
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,199
No, no, no, no, look.
I don't...

264
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,102
I don't wanna give you
any false hope.

265
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,606
It is her.
It's your wife.

266
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:09,341
Okay.

267
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:11,876
And, uh...

268
00:22:11,878 --> 00:22:14,682
And then I'm gonna have
to ask you some questions.

269
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,750
That kid...

270
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,786
Does he know something?

271
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:24,789
Well, you know, it's...

272
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,694
She owned a gun.

273
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:29,631
Karen owned a gun.

274
00:22:30,564 --> 00:22:33,768
A handgun for protection.

275
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,711
The hell is she doing at a hotel
in the middle of the night?

276
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,083
The next time you speak with
him, it will be with a lawyer.

277
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:52,384
All right? You understand?

278
00:22:52,386 --> 00:22:54,053
Ma'am, we just asked him
a few questions.

279
00:22:54,055 --> 00:22:57,623
No, no, no.
You don't ask him anything!

280
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,958
You cannot keep him here,

281
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,861
and you cannot bother him
with questions

282
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:03,796
because this is a fragile boy,

283
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:05,530
and you need
to understand that

284
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:06,864
and respect that.

285
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:08,700
Ma'am, look,
we do understand that,

286
00:23:08,702 --> 00:23:11,103
- but you need to...
- No, no, no. No buts.

287
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:14,976
You stay away from my boy!

288
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:35,696
Honey?

289
00:23:44,905 --> 00:23:48,039
You know you can
tell me anything, honey.

290
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,142
You can tell me
anything in the world,

291
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:53,682
and I will always
be on your side.

292
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,970
I love you.

293
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,022
<i>Okay, we're not in lov.</i>

294
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:11,958
<i>We could pretend
like I'm just some...</i>

295
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,896
<i>easy piece of ass
that you meet in a hotel.</i>

296
00:25:16,897 --> 00:25:18,896
<i>Regularly. Secretly.</i>

297
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:21,467
<i>A fuck buddy,
whatever they call it.</i>

298
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:22,968
- <i>Is that what she is?</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

299
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:26,104
<i>Shut up.</i>

300
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:29,607
- <i>The rough stuff, huh?</i>
- <i>Is that what you wan?</i>

301
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:32,510
<i>Is that what she liked?
Did she like it rough?</i>

302
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:34,148
<i>Shut up!</i>

303
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,498
Look,
I don't wanna let you go.

304
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,669
You know, fire you.
That wouldn't be right.

305
00:25:56,671 --> 00:26:00,842
So I think moving you
to a different location...

306
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:03,308
Okay.

307
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,777
It's a similar layout,
a little smaller.

308
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:07,145
Not so busy.

309
00:26:07,147 --> 00:26:08,413
Same shift for you.

310
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:10,815
Um, same routine.

311
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,584
Pretty much same everything.

312
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:14,422
Okay.

313
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,922
Okay.

314
00:26:16,924 --> 00:26:18,459
Okay.

315
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,544
Three, two, one.

316
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:13,778
There you are.

317
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,080
Hi.

318
00:27:15,082 --> 00:27:16,815
Hey, how you doin'?

319
00:27:16,817 --> 00:27:18,784
I'm good. Uh, checking in.

320
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:20,153
Yes.

321
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:24,890
Can I have your name, please?

322
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:26,461
Rivera.

323
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:28,997
Andrea Rivera.

324
00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:33,166
Thank you.

325
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:36,504
You're new here, right?

326
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:40,706
Have you stayed with us
before, Miss Rivera?

327
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,243
Yeah.

328
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:47,179
So what's your name?

329
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:49,815
- My name?
- Yeah.

330
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:52,851
Oh. Bartholomew Bromley.

331
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:55,056
My name is Bart.

332
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:58,056
Well, it's very nice
meeting you, Bart.

333
00:27:58,058 --> 00:27:59,460
What?

334
00:28:00,861 --> 00:28:02,494
It's nice to meet you.

335
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:05,300
Oh. Yes, it is.

336
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,534
So, room 107.

337
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:10,201
Just down towards
the elevators.

338
00:28:10,203 --> 00:28:12,270
Turn left, and it's
the seventh door on your right.

339
00:28:12,272 --> 00:28:16,176
Yeah, I'll find it. Thanks.

340
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:50,441
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Hey, how you doin'?</i>

341
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:53,411
- <i>Good. Just checking i.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

342
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:55,080
Can I have your name?

343
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:57,185
<i>Uh, can I have your name?</i>

344
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:02,988
<i>Rivera. Andrea Rivera.</i>

345
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,724
Andrea?
That's a very nice name.

346
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:08,396
I don't think
I've ever met an Andrea.

347
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,163
Seven nights?

348
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:14,999
<i>Yeah, a week, maybe longer.</i>

349
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:17,201
<i>I'm not sure yet.</i>

350
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:18,671
Well, that's great.
The room's available,

351
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,538
and you can stay
as long as you like,

352
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,243
and we'd love
to have you here.

353
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,413
<i>So you're new here, right?</i>

354
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:32,151
Yes, I am. Well, I was working
at the Mercer location,

355
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:35,086
which is also part of
the Suites hotel chain.

356
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:37,555
And I transferred
to Hamelton last week.

357
00:29:37,557 --> 00:29:39,959
And I work the night shift,
8:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.

358
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,494
And I'm usually here alone,

359
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:42,961
unless we have
a large party checking in.

360
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:45,764
In that case, we put on
an extra person to help out.

361
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:50,204
But usually it's just me here,
so unless...

362
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:54,375
Well, if you need anything...

363
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:58,813
So, if you need anything...

364
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,348
anything...

365
00:30:09,823 --> 00:30:11,559
Talk too much.

366
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:16,228
Never mind.

367
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,663
<i>So you're new here, right?</i>

368
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:20,865
Yes, I am.

369
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:23,035
And if there's anything
I can help you out with,

370
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:24,369
please let me know.

371
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:26,138
See? That's it.
That's all you have to say.

372
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,039
That's better, see?

373
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:31,678
So now you say...

374
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,612
Right.

375
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,814
Would you like one key or two?

376
00:30:35,816 --> 00:30:38,086
<i>Just one.</i>

377
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:40,885
Okay, perfect.
It's room 107.

378
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:43,323
Would you like me to show you
where that is?

379
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:46,057
<i>I'll find it.</i>

380
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,327
<i>Thanks, Bart.</i>

381
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:04,711
Andrea.

382
00:31:08,682 --> 00:31:11,786
Andrea, Andrea, Andrea, Andrea.

383
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:31,239
<i>Dinner's ready, honey.</i>

384
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:35,039
<i>I made rice and beans.</i>

385
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:40,179
Shredded pork.

386
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:42,283
Very tasty.

387
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,209
Hey.

388
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:45,710
Hi. How you doin'?

389
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:50,681
Good. I'm just picking up
some things for the room.

390
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:52,150
- Coffee and milk...
- Coffee's supplied

391
00:32:52,152 --> 00:32:54,419
free of charge
in the queen suites,

392
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:57,088
as well as sweeteners
and nondairy creamer.

393
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,891
Yeah.

394
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,427
But it's not
the best coffee, is it?

395
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:03,696
And God knows what's
in those nondairy things.

396
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:06,730
Vegetable fats replicate
the feel of milk fats.

397
00:33:06,732 --> 00:33:09,067
Other common ingredients
include corn syrup, sweeteners,

398
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:11,702
flavorings such as
French vanilla and hazelnut,

399
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:13,705
and sodium caseinate,
a milk protein

400
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:16,844
that is derivative from casein
that does not contain lactose.

401
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:20,045
Well, now I know.

402
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:21,446
Yes.

403
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:24,415
I talk too much.

404
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,150
No, you don't.

405
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:28,620
And then I don't talk.

406
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:31,655
Hey, it's okay, really.

407
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:34,325
I'm socially awkward.

408
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:37,365
Yes, you are.

409
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:39,965
My brother had it.

410
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:44,669
Yeah, only his was worse.

411
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:47,873
He couldn't really
function at all.

412
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:51,876
He couldn't hold a job.
Nothing.

413
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:54,281
You do pretty well.

414
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:56,748
I have to practice.

415
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,219
I have to prepare
what to say, how to behave.

416
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:04,588
I watch people,
and I imitate.

417
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,991
- You watch people?
- Yes.

418
00:34:06,993 --> 00:34:10,028
Well, I study them.

419
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,398
Yeah, well, I guess you have
a lot of people to watch.

420
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,532
- At the hotel.
- Yes.

421
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:19,637
Because otherwise I just
feel like I don't belong.

422
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,409
Yeah, I know what you mean.

423
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:31,148
He had it? You said
your brother, he had it?

424
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,019
What happened to him?

425
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,329
Um...

426
00:34:44,364 --> 00:34:47,500
He was institutionalized
for a long time.

427
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:51,068
I used to visit him.

428
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,842
And every time he would beg me
to get him out of there.

429
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:58,978
But we just couldn't.

430
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,483
And then he passed away.

431
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,653
Yes. People die.

432
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,590
And that's the end.

433
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,191
So...

434
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:14,661
Yeah.

435
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:18,865
Okay, bye.

436
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:23,168
Bye.

437
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,872
<i>I sent her a text
from you. She isn't coming.</i>

438
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:29,273
- <i>She isn't?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

439
00:35:29,275 --> 00:35:33,110
<i>Told her you couldn't make it.
Had to cancel like that.</i>

440
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:37,715
<i>So guess you'll have to
settle for me.</i>

441
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:39,684
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

442
00:35:39,686 --> 00:35:40,988
One, two, three, four.

443
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:45,892
One, two, three, four.

444
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:48,629
One, two, three.

445
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:54,702
Is this anything?

446
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:00,639
What does this mean?

447
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:02,643
That there was a camera
in the room?

448
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:06,713
Look, I can't even tell
if it's her.

449
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:09,479
Okay.

450
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,583
It's okay.

451
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:14,554
Look, turn it off, please.

452
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:23,128
It's that kid.
It's that kid, isn't it?

453
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,795
Possibly. You know,

454
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:27,699
he's very savvy
with this technological shit.

455
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:30,969
You know, and these kids,
these kids on the spectrum,

456
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:33,470
you know, they could also be
very violent.

457
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:35,139
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him!

458
00:36:35,141 --> 00:36:37,309
For what? For what?
For what, for spying?

459
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:39,811
Come on. That's all I have,
and I barely have that.

460
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:41,311
Well, he might have
seen something.

461
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:42,981
Yeah? Yeah, you know what?

462
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:44,851
He could have seen
everything.

463
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,989
But you know, that doesn't
mean he did anything, does it?

464
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,690
Look, I don't wanna
cause him any trouble.

465
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:55,059
Yeah, well, he's already
in a lot of trouble.

466
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:57,762
Well, more trouble.

467
00:36:57,764 --> 00:37:00,097
He's a nice enough guy.

468
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:01,266
Little weird.

469
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:05,003
So, um, what did you see?

470
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:09,474
What I think I saw.
It looked like one of our rooms.

471
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:11,876
- From the hotel.
- Yeah, on his iPad.

472
00:37:11,878 --> 00:37:14,979
I thought it was a movie,
maybe some porn.

473
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:16,947
I don't know
how someone like that gets off,

474
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:21,084
but it seems like
porn would be the answer.

475
00:37:21,086 --> 00:37:25,423
- And why would you say that?
- Because it was creepy.

476
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:26,958
The way he was
just sitting there

477
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,226
when I found him in the room
that night.

478
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:31,429
- Just sitting.
- Right.

479
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:33,831
Like he was waiting
for a bus.

480
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,169
It's fucking weird,
you know?

481
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,307
Hi there.

482
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:18,746
Hey.

483
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:26,550
I haven't seen you
for a while.

484
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:28,021
How are you?

485
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:32,192
Well, that's a very
complicated question.

486
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:36,196
Yeah, I bet it is.

487
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:42,733
Anyway, it's good
to see you now.

488
00:38:42,735 --> 00:38:44,971
Nice to see you too.

489
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,941
Oh, they did some work in
your room today on the A/C unit,

490
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:55,079
so if anything has moved...

491
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:57,350
Sure. Okay.

492
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:44,255
<i>You got a light?</i>

493
00:40:44,257 --> 00:40:45,824
Excuse me?

494
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:48,059
A match.

495
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:50,162
Cigarette? A light?

496
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:53,632
Smoking's not permitted
on the premises.

497
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:56,133
Yeah, I know that.

498
00:40:56,135 --> 00:40:58,503
Yeah, due largely to studies
that have shown

499
00:40:58,505 --> 00:41:01,037
that when you have smoking
and nonsmoking rooms,

500
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,840
nicotine residues
and other chemical traces

501
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:04,742
end up in hallways
and other rooms,

502
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:07,815
including
nonsmoking rooms, so...

503
00:41:11,784 --> 00:41:13,953
Bart, I know that.

504
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:17,891
I'm going outside
by the pool.

505
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,791
I just need a match.

506
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:22,362
Oh.

507
00:41:24,664 --> 00:41:26,800
I couldn't sleep.

508
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:29,368
That's too bad.

509
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:34,842
Yeah, it happens
when I drink too much.

510
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:37,809
People drink too much.

511
00:41:37,811 --> 00:41:40,177
Yeah, they do.

512
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:41,815
Yeah.

513
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,292
Thanks.

514
00:41:56,829 --> 00:41:59,398
I'll be outside
if you want some company.

515
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,360
This is a towel.

516
00:42:31,597 --> 00:42:33,097
What are you doing?

517
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:35,536
You can't just...
Turn around!

518
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:40,972
- Goddamn.
- We don't have a lifeguard.

519
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:42,374
A what?

520
00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:43,977
A lifeguard.

521
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:47,677
Right. You don't have one.

522
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,947
No.

523
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:50,648
You should.

524
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,985
Yes, in the water.

525
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,755
Come.

526
00:42:57,757 --> 00:42:59,557
Come here. Sit.

527
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:02,996
Keep me company.
You scared the hell out of me.

528
00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:07,731
I'm sorry.

529
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,268
That's okay.

530
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:15,075
You were kissing a man
in that car.

531
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,943
Yeah, well...

532
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,711
Okay, you saw us.

533
00:43:21,713 --> 00:43:23,615
Yeah. Who was that?

534
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:25,983
And why were you kissing him?

535
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:28,288
That's a very
complicated question.

536
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:30,223
Oh.

537
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:35,059
I guess so.

538
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:37,297
You don't have someone?

539
00:43:38,697 --> 00:43:40,299
A girlfriend...

540
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:42,900
like that?

541
00:43:42,902 --> 00:43:45,005
No.

542
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:47,273
It's difficult, huh?

543
00:43:49,742 --> 00:43:51,309
Yes.

544
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:52,880
I bet.

545
00:43:57,215 --> 00:43:59,851
And there's the problem
of being perceived as odd

546
00:43:59,853 --> 00:44:01,889
or unsophisticated.

547
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:05,958
Naive, clueless.

548
00:44:06,626 --> 00:44:08,362
Unfashionable.

549
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:11,498
Or just plain stupid.

550
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:15,234
Which you're not.

551
00:44:16,402 --> 00:44:19,906
You're not stupid, are you?

552
00:44:20,672 --> 00:44:22,241
No.

553
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:25,911
But that's the perception.

554
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,579
So it's very difficult
for people to know

555
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:31,916
what's going on
inside that head.

556
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:34,719
Yes, that's correct.

557
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:37,023
Well, I wanna know.

558
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,494
What is going on inside, Bart?

559
00:44:51,103 --> 00:44:54,037
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
What did you do?

560
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:55,539
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

561
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:57,206
- Bart, it's okay.
- Bart, what did you do?

562
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,641
What did you do, Bart?

563
00:44:58,643 --> 00:45:00,144
Bart, it's okay.

564
00:45:00,146 --> 00:45:01,612
I'm sorry.

565
00:45:01,614 --> 00:45:03,613
Was that wrong to do that
like that?

566
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,517
Because if that was wrong
to do that like that,

567
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:07,851
I apologize,

568
00:45:07,853 --> 00:45:10,920
and I'll never do anything
like that ever again.

569
00:45:10,922 --> 00:45:13,057
Bart, it's okay.

570
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:14,391
Come here.

571
00:45:14,393 --> 00:45:16,963
Why don't you come here
and sit with me?

572
00:45:39,117 --> 00:45:41,554
It's loneliness, Bart.

573
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:51,497
Loneliness
makes us do things.

574
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,753
He's married.

575
00:46:48,253 --> 00:46:50,489
The man I was with.

576
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:54,061
He's a married man.

577
00:47:00,398 --> 00:47:03,402
We've been seeing each other
for a very long time.

578
00:47:06,806 --> 00:47:08,407
Secretly.

579
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:15,849
Now...

580
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:23,490
things have got
confusing between us.

581
00:47:24,623 --> 00:47:26,559
So I don't know.

582
00:47:29,628 --> 00:47:33,432
Before,
I knew what we were doing.

583
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:36,202
But now...

584
00:47:42,842 --> 00:47:45,611
I have no idea
what you're trying to say.

585
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,751
Neither do I.

586
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:57,324
"A Nerkle, a Nerd,
and a Seersucker too."

587
00:47:58,157 --> 00:47:59,590
A what?

588
00:47:59,592 --> 00:48:00,691
Nerd.

589
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:03,594
First documentation of the word.

590
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:06,867
1950. Dr. Seuss.
<i>If I Ran a Zoo.</i>

591
00:48:08,068 --> 00:48:11,702
Used to label persons as odd

592
00:48:11,704 --> 00:48:15,876
or who are thought of
as sexually unattractive.

593
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:19,510
But more recently,

594
00:48:19,512 --> 00:48:21,545
technological proficiency
is highly prized,

595
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:23,748
so the nerd
is often celebrated

596
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:28,621
as a technosexual
or even a sexy love god.

597
00:48:31,925 --> 00:48:35,394
Now I don't know
what you're trying to say.

598
00:48:38,597 --> 00:48:39,930
Oh, boy.

599
00:48:39,932 --> 00:48:41,501
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

600
00:48:44,336 --> 00:48:46,206
Are we talking about you?

601
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:52,177
Yes.

602
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,878
And what are you
trying to say about you,

603
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,384
besides being
that you're a love god?

604
00:49:01,152 --> 00:49:03,255
I could be your lifeguard.

605
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:22,574
Yeah, maybe you could.

606
00:49:23,342 --> 00:49:25,711
I don't know.
I've never had one.

607
00:49:29,014 --> 00:49:30,750
Maybe you could.

608
00:49:40,226 --> 00:49:41,561
Bart.

609
00:49:44,262 --> 00:49:47,063
I need to get some sleep.

610
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:48,900
I need to sleep, okay?

611
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,101
Okay.

612
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:51,938
Okay, good night.

613
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:10,581
These are very close
to the picture.

614
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:12,581
And very well-made.
Nice fit.

615
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,284
Would you wear those?

616
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:15,885
Why, yes, I would.

617
00:51:15,887 --> 00:51:18,856
I don't want something
you would wear.

618
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:20,157
Why not?

619
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:21,795
Because you're old.

620
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:33,135
Insurance looks okay.
Registration, pink slip.

621
00:51:33,137 --> 00:51:36,108
Try this one. This has been
a very popular scent.

622
00:51:38,945 --> 00:51:40,945
Are you okay?

623
00:51:40,947 --> 00:51:42,845
I mean, this is
a really good deal.

624
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:44,717
You know,
if there's something...

625
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:47,517
Wha...

626
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:48,719
What's the matter?

627
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:50,724
You need to lose weight.

628
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:52,657
I'm sorry?

629
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:55,258
Please don't touch my skin.

630
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,795
I wanna smell like this.

631
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:00,130
- Well, that's a picture.
- Yes.

632
00:52:00,132 --> 00:52:02,632
Obesity is not just
a cosmetic problem.

633
00:52:02,634 --> 00:52:04,401
It's a health hazard.

634
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:06,603
You can touch my hair,
but please just don't touch my skin.

635
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:08,572
My skin is mine.

636
00:52:08,574 --> 00:52:10,807
Also, you're at a very high risk
of heart disease,

637
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:12,775
diabetes, stroke,
high blood pressure,

638
00:52:12,777 --> 00:52:16,380
cancer, gallstones,
osteoarthritis and gout.

639
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:18,916
It doesn't smell.
Pictures don't smell.

640
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:20,420
Why not?

641
00:52:21,753 --> 00:52:23,623
Because it's a picture.

642
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:26,657
I'm not obese.

643
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:29,528
Well, you are very,
very fat.

644
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:38,771
Okay, bye.

645
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:45,844
Wow.

646
00:53:11,804 --> 00:53:14,405
<i>Hello, Hamelton Hotel.
How can I help you?</i>

647
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:18,909
Yes, Andrea Rivera,
107, please?

648
00:53:18,911 --> 00:53:20,146
Thank you.

649
00:53:26,117 --> 00:53:27,953
Okay, hold on.

650
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,554
Hello?

651
00:53:31,556 --> 00:53:33,091
<i>Hello?</i>

652
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,464
Who does that?

653
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:03,121
Easy with that.

654
00:54:04,423 --> 00:54:05,990
Honey, I couldn't stop them.

655
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,923
They have a search warrant.
There was nothing I could do.

656
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:10,626
- Hey, Bart. How you doin'?
- You don't have to talk to him.

657
00:54:10,628 --> 00:54:12,262
Quite the setup
you got here, my man.

658
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:14,030
- You don't have to say anything to him.
- Well, hello.

659
00:54:14,032 --> 00:54:16,233
He has no right to ask you
anything, do you understand?

660
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:17,534
Mrs. Bromley, I could either

661
00:54:17,536 --> 00:54:19,068
talk to him here
or take him downtown.

662
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:22,572
- Look, it's up to you.
- All right, talk, talk.

663
00:54:22,574 --> 00:54:24,041
Thank you.

664
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:26,876
So, Bart, this is where
you spend your time, huh?

665
00:54:26,878 --> 00:54:28,711
- Yes.
- Kind of dark.

666
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:30,748
You see, that's what you
don't understand, you see?

667
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,816
This is his way
of seeing the world.

668
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:35,918
- No, no, no!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

669
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,291
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

670
00:54:43,128 --> 00:54:47,164
Hey, Bart, um,
your hard drive's empty.

671
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:48,532
Yes. I wiped it.

672
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:49,733
They were on
your computer, honey.

673
00:54:49,735 --> 00:54:50,900
There was nothing I could do.

674
00:54:50,902 --> 00:54:53,135
And you wiped everything?

675
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:54,237
Yes.

676
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:56,106
And you didn't think
of backing it up

677
00:54:56,108 --> 00:54:58,911
or maybe putting it on
an external hard drive, maybe?

678
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,110
No.

679
00:55:01,112 --> 00:55:03,746
Well, see, Bart,
I don't believe that.

680
00:55:03,748 --> 00:55:05,347
I don't believe you.

681
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:06,749
Well, that's too bad.

682
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,452
Belief systems
can be very tricky.

683
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,289
Yeah, they can be, Bart.

684
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,655
But you're hiding something.

685
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:14,992
That's what
I really believe, Bart.

686
00:55:14,994 --> 00:55:16,592
So what are you hiding?

687
00:55:16,594 --> 00:55:19,731
He's not hiding anything.
Please.

688
00:55:20,932 --> 00:55:22,967
Bart, you get a lot of sympathy

689
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:24,901
for being like this,
don't you, huh?

690
00:55:24,903 --> 00:55:27,003
You get a little free pass.

691
00:55:27,005 --> 00:55:29,240
And what happens when
your mom's not around?

692
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,173
What happens when she's
not there to fix it for you?

693
00:55:31,175 --> 00:55:33,010
How bad does it get when
you get that lonely, Bart?

694
00:55:33,012 --> 00:55:35,545
What happens when you
get that frustrated, Bart?

695
00:55:35,547 --> 00:55:37,914
- Does it just explode, Bart?
- All right, that's enough!

696
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:39,215
- Stop it!
- Please, Mrs. Bromley.

697
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:40,319
Please sit down!

698
00:55:45,824 --> 00:55:47,724
Now, I'm done fucking around
with you, Bart.

699
00:55:47,726 --> 00:55:49,459
You know why? Because
we found your fingerprints

700
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:50,526
all over the room.

701
00:55:50,528 --> 00:55:52,563
So what happened, Bart?

702
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:54,264
What happened?
Did she invite you up?

703
00:55:54,266 --> 00:55:55,333
No.

704
00:55:55,335 --> 00:55:57,101
Well, maybe she was lonely.

705
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,735
Maybe you were lonely.
Maybe you went up.

706
00:55:58,737 --> 00:56:00,436
Maybe you thought
you could have sex with her

707
00:56:00,438 --> 00:56:02,572
and maybe things got
a little frustrating for you.

708
00:56:02,574 --> 00:56:05,041
Maybe got a little out of hand.
Maybe you hit her, Bart.

709
00:56:05,043 --> 00:56:07,443
And then what, hmm?
And then what happened?

710
00:56:07,445 --> 00:56:09,412
Well, Bart, you tell me.

711
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:11,347
Then I guess I just pulled
a gun from my pocket

712
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:13,784
because I always have
a gun in my pocket,

713
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:15,552
- and I shot her.
- Bart.

714
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:16,920
But where did I get the gun?

715
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:18,354
That's what I
would like to know.

716
00:56:18,356 --> 00:56:20,289
- Bart.
- Did I buy it?

717
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:21,958
Did I steal it?

718
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,860
Maybe I purchased it online,

719
00:56:23,862 --> 00:56:25,862
and then when I went
to have sex with her,

720
00:56:25,864 --> 00:56:27,331
I brought the gun
because, you know,

721
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,066
it's always a good idea
to take a gun

722
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:31,702
when you go to have sex
with someone because...

723
00:56:31,704 --> 00:56:34,070
Just in case you suffer
from impotence

724
00:56:34,072 --> 00:56:35,472
or performance anxiety,

725
00:56:35,474 --> 00:56:37,641
and you get frustrated,
and you can't do it,

726
00:56:37,643 --> 00:56:39,708
then you have a gun
in your pocket,

727
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,543
and, by golly,
you just take it out

728
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:42,813
and shoot that person!

729
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:44,650
Bang, bang!

730
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:47,253
And then the problem
is solved.

731
00:56:51,123 --> 00:56:53,990
So where's
that gun now, Bart?

732
00:56:53,992 --> 00:56:56,492
That was a joke.
What's the matter with you?

733
00:56:56,494 --> 00:56:59,229
He doesn't have a gun.
He was making a joke.

734
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:04,001
Yeah, that was a good one, Bart.
That was real good.

735
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,704
But you know what, ma'am?
We have a dead woman here,

736
00:57:06,706 --> 00:57:08,706
and I think Bart knows
something about it.

737
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:11,077
That's why I'm not laughing.

738
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,220
<i>Is he sick?</i>

739
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:32,623
No, I don't think so.

740
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,860
<i>I have Jack
covering for him.</i>

741
00:58:35,862 --> 00:58:38,128
<i>He's not answering his cell.</i>

742
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,463
Thank you for your concern,
really.

743
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:43,599
I'm sure he's okay.
I'm sure he's fine.

744
00:58:43,601 --> 00:58:45,036
Thanks.

745
00:58:58,717 --> 00:59:00,418
Bart?

746
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,222
Bart, honey, are you down there?

747
00:59:05,556 --> 00:59:08,994
Bartholomew, I'm coming down.
Okay, here I come.

748
00:59:16,768 --> 00:59:19,171
Oh, honey,
there you are.

749
00:59:21,507 --> 00:59:24,708
You didn't touch your supper.
Aren't you hungry?

750
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,445
I'm fine.

751
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:31,517
Mr. Benson called.
He was worried about you.

752
00:59:32,918 --> 00:59:36,154
I worry too, Bart.
I worry all the time.

753
00:59:39,724 --> 00:59:41,891
Life is hard, honey.

754
00:59:41,893 --> 00:59:45,430
Even for the best of us,
life is very hard.

755
00:59:47,465 --> 00:59:49,800
When your father passed,
that was very hard.

756
00:59:49,802 --> 00:59:53,604
I know it was hard for you.
It was hard for me too.

757
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:55,438
And never mind the pain.

758
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,041
I know there was
a lot of pain.

759
00:59:58,043 --> 01:00:00,610
And how much it hurt.

760
01:00:00,612 --> 01:00:06,251
That was bad, very bad,
but not the worst part.

761
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,054
The worst part was
waking up in the morning

762
01:00:10,056 --> 01:00:13,059
and forgetting he was gone.

763
01:00:13,824 --> 01:00:15,393
Did you do that?

764
01:00:16,762 --> 01:00:19,065
You forget,
and then you remember.

765
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:24,834
You remember, and the world ends
all over again.

766
01:00:24,836 --> 01:00:26,802
But you still have
to get out of bed

767
01:00:26,804 --> 01:00:28,438
and make the coffee
and the toast,

768
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,173
'cause the world
doesn't really end.

769
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:33,346
It just seems that way
sometimes.

770
01:00:34,846 --> 01:00:36,246
The world is still there.

771
01:00:36,248 --> 01:00:38,184
It doesn't go away.

772
01:00:42,253 --> 01:00:44,489
It's still waiting for you.

773
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:48,427
It's waiting for you too, honey.

774
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,302
That's all.

775
01:00:58,403 --> 01:01:00,003
Okay?

776
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:01,974
I'm going.

777
01:02:58,623 --> 01:03:02,460
I've thought this through
so many times.

778
01:03:05,764 --> 01:03:09,101
It's the only way. It's...

779
01:03:10,635 --> 01:03:12,637
It's the only way.

780
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:26,352
Do you love me?

781
01:03:28,052 --> 01:03:30,255
Do you care what happens to me?

782
01:03:33,092 --> 01:03:34,527
I do.

783
01:03:36,827 --> 01:03:38,329
You know I do.

784
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:40,632
We deserve this.

785
01:04:29,614 --> 01:04:31,117
Yes?

786
01:04:31,815 --> 01:04:33,518
I'm looking for Bart.

787
01:04:34,351 --> 01:04:35,751
It's Bart, um...

788
01:04:35,753 --> 01:04:37,086
Bromley?

789
01:04:37,088 --> 01:04:38,755
Yes. Sorry.

790
01:04:38,757 --> 01:04:41,057
I'm his mother.

791
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:43,191
Hi.

792
01:04:43,193 --> 01:04:44,864
And who are you?

793
01:04:46,398 --> 01:04:48,331
Andrea.

794
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,668
I'm a friend of his.

795
01:04:51,369 --> 01:04:54,239
Really?
You're his friend?

796
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:59,041
Well, I know him
from the hotel.

797
01:04:59,043 --> 01:05:01,813
He doesn't work there anymore.

798
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:05,949
Oh, I'm sorry.

799
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:07,784
Yeah.

800
01:05:07,786 --> 01:05:09,820
I thought...

801
01:05:10,755 --> 01:05:13,889
I thought he was out sick
or something.

802
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:15,426
No.

803
01:05:16,594 --> 01:05:18,429
That's what they told me.

804
01:05:23,969 --> 01:05:25,871
Is he home?

805
01:05:42,186 --> 01:05:43,688
Hi, Bart.

806
01:05:46,724 --> 01:05:48,226
I'm fine.

807
01:05:48,827 --> 01:05:50,894
I've missed you.

808
01:05:50,896 --> 01:05:52,829
Yes?

809
01:05:52,831 --> 01:05:55,197
At the hotel.

810
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,468
I was wondering where you were.

811
01:05:58,603 --> 01:06:00,371
Yes.

812
01:06:02,373 --> 01:06:04,542
How are you?

813
01:06:06,978 --> 01:06:08,177
That's a...

814
01:06:08,179 --> 01:06:10,345
Complicated question.

815
01:06:10,347 --> 01:06:12,985
- Yeah, I know.
- Yes.

816
01:06:23,161 --> 01:06:24,963
I have a broken heart.

817
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:27,396
You do?

818
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:29,801
Yes, it's very painful.

819
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:33,005
I bet.

820
01:06:35,373 --> 01:06:36,905
In a 1993 study,

821
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:38,907
individuals who said
that they were in love

822
01:06:38,909 --> 01:06:41,978
had their brains scanned
to show neural activity.

823
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,680
The map showed vivid colors
over the gray matter,

824
01:06:44,682 --> 01:06:47,751
indicating clearly that this
romantic love phenomenon

825
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,418
activates a flood of dopamine

826
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,987
in the caudate nucleus
in exactly the same way

827
01:06:50,989 --> 01:06:53,757
that cocaine and nicotine
affect the brain,

828
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:56,825
meaning that love
is not an emotion,

829
01:06:56,827 --> 01:06:59,896
as is usually thought.
Rather, it's an addiction.

830
01:06:59,898 --> 01:07:02,632
When these chemicals
are released in our brains,

831
01:07:02,634 --> 01:07:06,536
we feel giddy and euphoric,

832
01:07:06,538 --> 01:07:08,970
so much to the point
that we can be so in love

833
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:12,277
that we don't have the desire
to eat or to sleep.

834
01:07:13,644 --> 01:07:16,014
So it feels good
when you have...

835
01:07:17,215 --> 01:07:19,816
the drug or the love,

836
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:22,354
but when it's taken away,
you hurt.

837
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,856
Heartbreak.

838
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:29,394
Yes.

839
01:07:32,396 --> 01:07:33,597
I'm sorry.

840
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,468
Addiction is
a very dangerous thing.

841
01:07:37,168 --> 01:07:39,503
Yeah, I know.

842
01:07:39,505 --> 01:07:40,972
Believe me.

843
01:07:43,074 --> 01:07:45,910
People die from it.
People die from love.

844
01:07:47,945 --> 01:07:49,244
Yeah.

845
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:52,583
And then that's the end.
They die, and that's the end.

846
01:07:57,056 --> 01:07:58,523
Bart.

847
01:08:08,065 --> 01:08:09,932
Fuck this.

848
01:08:09,934 --> 01:08:11,668
Bart, I'm sorry.

849
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,606
I'm very sorry
for everything.

850
01:08:16,841 --> 01:08:19,409
Because you're a nice person.

851
01:08:19,411 --> 01:08:21,611
You're very special.

852
01:08:21,613 --> 01:08:24,115
And if things were different,
you know, I...

853
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:30,152
But they aren't.
They just...

854
01:08:30,154 --> 01:08:32,457
They just aren't, so...

855
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:36,595
Listen.

856
01:08:42,734 --> 01:08:45,867
I'm just very happy
to have met you.

857
01:08:45,869 --> 01:08:48,070
And I won't bother you anymore.

858
01:08:48,072 --> 01:08:50,406
I promise.

859
01:08:50,408 --> 01:08:51,810
No more.

860
01:08:56,113 --> 01:08:57,548
Take care.

861
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,833
<i>I don't understand.</i>

862
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:26,902
<i>So you're in love with me,
but you don't love me enough?</i>

863
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:29,104
<i>Oh, my God. Just...
Nick...</i>

864
01:10:29,106 --> 01:10:32,275
<i>You don't understand.</i>

865
01:10:32,277 --> 01:10:35,745
- <i>That's not what I mea.</i>
- <i>What do you mea?</i>

866
01:10:35,747 --> 01:10:37,679
- <i>Just don't!</i>
- <i>What?</i>

867
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:39,281
<i>Don't what?
Don't be mad?</i>

868
01:10:39,283 --> 01:10:43,253
- <i>Don't be upset? Don't...</i>
- <i>Let go of me.</i>

869
01:10:43,255 --> 01:10:45,657
<i>Just fucking let go of me!</i>

870
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:48,157
<i>Wha...</i>

871
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,492
<i>Do you think
that I'm stupid?</i>

872
01:10:50,494 --> 01:10:53,196
<i>You think I'm fucking stupid?
Where are you fucking going?</i>

873
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:55,063
<i>I can't do this!
I need to go!</i>

874
01:10:55,065 --> 01:10:56,898
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>I have to go.</i>

875
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,767
No!

876
01:10:57,769 --> 01:10:59,168
<i>I can't do this!</i>

877
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:00,736
No!

878
01:11:05,644 --> 01:11:08,577
<i>Damn, Nick, you're crazy.
I have to go.</i>

879
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:09,912
- <i>Don't, don't.</i>
- <i>I can't do this!</i>

880
01:11:09,914 --> 01:11:11,214
<i>Don't be a fucking...</i>

881
01:11:11,216 --> 01:11:12,851
No!

882
01:11:13,318 --> 01:11:14,686
No!

883
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,788
<i>Just leaving, huh?</i>

884
01:11:20,891 --> 01:11:22,625
I'm okay! I'm okay!

885
01:11:22,627 --> 01:11:24,393
I'm okay! I'm okay!

886
01:11:24,395 --> 01:11:26,362
I'm okay! I'm okay!

887
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:29,331
I'm okay!
I'm okay! I'm okay!

888
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,769
I'm okay.

889
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,107
Andrea, it's Bart.

890
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:40,843
It's just me.

891
01:11:40,845 --> 01:11:42,911
Bart, what are you doing here?

892
01:11:42,913 --> 01:11:45,647
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

893
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:48,117
Okay. Okay, first...

894
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:49,552
First, there's...

895
01:11:49,554 --> 01:11:51,187
There's blood
on that towel.

896
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:54,190
- It's okay.
- He hit you. I saw him.

897
01:11:54,192 --> 01:11:55,558
You saw what?

898
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,093
Boy. Oh, boy, Oh, boy. Oh...

899
01:11:57,095 --> 01:11:58,626
- Okay, just...
- What did you do?

900
01:11:58,628 --> 01:11:59,695
Calm down!

901
01:11:59,697 --> 01:12:01,164
I can show you.
You can see.

902
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:03,635
See what? Show me what?
What are you talking about?

903
01:12:07,506 --> 01:12:09,007
Bart!

904
01:12:24,689 --> 01:12:26,755
I saw him.

905
01:12:26,757 --> 01:12:28,993
Oh, my God.

906
01:12:30,094 --> 01:12:31,693
I can show you.
You can see.

907
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:33,364
You saw him with me?

908
01:12:34,231 --> 01:12:35,697
Yes. I'm sorry.

909
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:38,233
What are you saying?

910
01:12:38,235 --> 01:12:40,135
What is this?

911
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:41,903
Bart?

912
01:12:41,905 --> 01:12:43,305
- Bart!
- I can show you.

913
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:46,041
You fucking recorded this?

914
01:12:46,043 --> 01:12:48,044
I'm sorry.

915
01:12:48,046 --> 01:12:50,248
What is the matter with you?

916
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:52,882
Oh, my God.

917
01:12:52,884 --> 01:12:54,717
Please, you need to see.
Come with me. Come with me.

918
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,221
You need to see,
and you'll be safe.

919
01:12:58,088 --> 01:12:59,256
Please.

920
01:13:13,637 --> 01:13:15,103
You need to see.

921
01:13:15,105 --> 01:13:17,975
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you!

922
01:13:22,313 --> 01:13:24,914
<i>We can pretend
like I'm just some...</i>

923
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:28,951
<i>easy piece of ass
that you meet in a hotel.</i>

924
01:13:28,953 --> 01:13:30,218
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

925
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:32,153
<i>Regularly. Secretl.</i>

926
01:13:32,155 --> 01:13:35,090
<i>A fuck buddy,
whatever they call it.</i>

927
01:13:35,092 --> 01:13:37,059
- <i>Is that what she is?</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

928
01:13:37,061 --> 01:13:39,327
<i>Shut up.</i>

929
01:13:39,329 --> 01:13:42,430
<i>The rough stuff, huh?</i>

930
01:13:42,432 --> 01:13:45,000
- <i>Is that what you want?</i>
- <i>Is that what she liked?</i>

931
01:13:45,002 --> 01:13:46,902
- <i>Did she like it rough?</i>
- <i>I said shut up!</i>

932
01:13:46,904 --> 01:13:50,106
<i>She like it...
Bastard! You bastard!</i>

933
01:13:54,645 --> 01:13:56,745
I can't...
I can't watch this.

934
01:13:56,747 --> 01:13:57,847
- See?
- I can't.

935
01:13:57,849 --> 01:14:00,182
See? I didn't mean to...

936
01:14:00,184 --> 01:14:03,119
- I just watch to learn what people do.
- I can't think.

937
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:04,454
But I didn't mean
to do anything bad.

938
01:14:04,456 --> 01:14:06,224
Stop, Bart. Stop, stop!

939
01:14:09,493 --> 01:14:11,095
Oh, my God.

940
01:14:14,966 --> 01:14:16,968
Did you show this
to the police?

941
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:20,739
No.

942
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,574
Anybody?
Has anybody seen this?

943
01:14:24,576 --> 01:14:26,811
No, just you.

944
01:14:27,945 --> 01:14:29,312
It's all here.

945
01:14:29,314 --> 01:14:32,548
- And they don't know I have it.
- Oh, my God.

946
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,849
Oh, my God, Bart.

947
01:14:34,851 --> 01:14:36,921
- Bart.
- Wait, wait.

948
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:42,924
This is a very bad man,
and he could hurt you.

949
01:14:42,926 --> 01:14:44,794
He did hurt you.
He already hurt you.

950
01:14:44,796 --> 01:14:47,365
- I can't.
- And...

951
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:51,000
we could go
to the police together.

952
01:14:51,002 --> 01:14:53,872
I would do that
if you were with me.

953
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,705
I would do anything for you.

954
01:14:56,707 --> 01:14:59,009
You don't even know me.

955
01:15:01,244 --> 01:15:03,014
Yes, I do.

956
01:15:04,815 --> 01:15:06,050
I do.

957
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:09,585
What am I gonna do?

958
01:15:09,587 --> 01:15:11,757
What am I gonna do?

959
01:15:12,856 --> 01:15:15,092
What am I gonna do?

960
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,930
Fix my heart.

961
01:15:24,735 --> 01:15:26,238
I can't.

962
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:30,572
I can't.

963
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:37,903
Good morning,
sleepyhead.

964
01:17:41,404 --> 01:17:42,673
Hey.

965
01:17:44,442 --> 01:17:47,279
I was just going
to wake you up.

966
01:17:49,078 --> 01:17:50,916
What are you...

967
01:17:51,582 --> 01:17:54,152
I'm ready to go.

968
01:17:58,055 --> 01:17:59,456
Wait.

969
01:18:00,457 --> 01:18:02,092
Come here.

970
01:18:48,104 --> 01:18:49,974
It's so easy.

971
01:18:55,779 --> 01:18:57,280
It's so easy.

972
01:18:57,282 --> 01:18:58,682
I was thinking...

973
01:18:59,684 --> 01:19:02,253
that maybe we could
go to the city.

974
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:09,226
Spend some time together.

975
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:19,104
It's so easy to touch you.

976
01:19:20,203 --> 01:19:22,206
To talk to you.

977
01:19:22,672 --> 01:19:24,274
To look at you.

978
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,680
Kiss me.

979
01:21:01,104 --> 01:21:03,071
All done?

980
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,446
- <i>♪ Sleep, my child ♪</i>

982
01:22:21,618 --> 01:22:25,786
<i>♪ All through the night ♪</i>

983
01:22:25,788 --> 01:22:27,555

Maybe she was...

984
01:22:27,557 --> 01:22:29,791
- Bang, bang!

<i>♪ All through the night ♪</i>

988
01:23:19,176 --> 01:23:20,809
Bart?

989
01:23:20,811 --> 01:23:22,380
Bart!

990
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,960
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me go in, let me go in.

991
01:23:37,962 --> 01:23:40,329
Look, I need to know.
Is he here or not?

992
01:23:40,331 --> 01:23:41,530
- Hold her.
- Let me go in first!

993
01:23:41,532 --> 01:23:43,965
Hold her, please.
Bart?

994
01:23:43,967 --> 01:23:45,636
There was a gun.

995
01:23:52,644 --> 01:23:54,308
I don't wanna know!
I don't wanna know!

996
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,509
- I don't wanna know.
- Bart?

997
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:56,878
I don't wanna know.

998
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,549
Hey, look,
it's Detective Espada here.

999
01:24:00,551 --> 01:24:04,355
We just came down
to ask you a few questions.

1000
01:24:10,461 --> 01:24:13,698
<i>Okay.
We're not in love.</i>

1001
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:17,766
<i>We can pretend

<i>easy piece of ass

1003
01:24:29,779 --> 01:24:34,018
<i>Regularly. Secretly.
A fuck buddy...</i>

1004
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:36,019
Bart!

1005
01:24:37,421 --> 01:24:39,524
I think this person
might be dead.

1006
01:24:43,027 --> 01:24:45,863
<i>Okay.
We're not in love.</i>

1007
01:24:47,164 --> 01:24:48,964
<i>Dear Detective,</i>

1008
01:24:48,966 --> 01:24:51,266
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
give these to you sooner</i>

1009
01:24:51,268 --> 01:24:53,602
<i>because it would show you</i>

1010
01:24:53,604 --> 01:24:57,339
<i>that I'm not the person
you're looking for.</i>

1011
01:24:57,341 --> 01:24:59,107
Oh, son of a bitch.

1012
01:24:59,109 --> 01:25:01,041
- <i>Whatever they call it.</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

1013
01:25:03,046 --> 01:25:04,178
<i>Shut up.</i>

1014
01:25:11,087 --> 01:25:12,523
Oh, Bart.

1015
01:25:13,724 --> 01:25:17,462
What did you do?
What did you do?

1016
01:25:56,266 --> 01:25:57,734
How you doin'?

1017
01:25:59,502 --> 01:26:01,139
Hey, how you doin'?

1018
01:26:03,106 --> 01:26:05,773
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
