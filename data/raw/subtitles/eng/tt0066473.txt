343
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:42,223
...that decisive naval engagements
must be fought between battleships.

344
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,475
unless we dispel this myth...

345
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,894
...we'll never get their approval.

346
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:52,191
They are not the only believers
in the "battleship theory."

347
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:57,196
Many officers here today
also support the idea.

348
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:03,327
I'm one of them. We'll soon have
two new unsinkable battlewagons...

349
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:08,249
...each with a displacement of
64,000 tons and huge guns.

350
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,878
Anything that floats can be sunk!
The "unsinkable" ship is a myth.

351
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,340
The war in Europe is being
decided by the airplane.

352
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:21,011
There can be no victory on land or sea,
without control of the air!

353
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,598
I have been chosen to command
this task force.

354
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,893
And I consider this operation risky.

355
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:32,398
How can we travel 3500 miles
to Hawaii without being detected?

356
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,569
This mission will fail unless
we achieve complete surprise.

357
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,613
My ships can't carry fuel
for a trip there and back.

358
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,868
Stopping to refuel increases
the possibility of detection.

359
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,542
I am confident that our ships
will reach Hawaii safely.

360
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:56,881
You are too cautious. The case
for using six carriers is sound.

361
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,426
To criticize the plan is defeatist!

362
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:23,949
No more bickering! As long
as I am Commander-in-Chief...

363
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,953
...Pearl Harbor will be attacked!

364
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,752
I am aware that this is
a dangerous gamble.

365
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,505
But we can't afford the luxury
of playing it safe now!

366
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,516
Gentlemen, whether we adopt this
plan or not is no longer an issue.

367
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,771
Let us now decide how best
to carry it out.

368
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,081
Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back!

369
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,881
Fuchida! What a surprise!

370
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,551
I'm your new Air Commander,
so treat me well.

371
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:29,139
You're joking. How did you
rate another promotion?

372
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,060
Well, exceptional people get
exceptional treatment!

373
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,907
This ship is crawling with Admirals.

374
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,411
Something important
must be happening.

375
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,206
We have called you here...

376
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:58,085
...to explain the purpose of
a new training program.

377
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,756
This, of course, is a matter
of strictest secrecy.

378
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,263
It looks just like Pearl Harbor,
doesn't it?

379
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,059
And that area down there
looks like Ford Island, eh?

380
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,764
Beautiful!

381
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:00,833
Navy pilots attract geisha girls
but they frighten the fish.

382
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,308
It's not an ideal radar sight,
but at least we got a permit.

383
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,394
Let's get the other units working.

384
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,895
Easier said than done.

385
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,147
What do you mean?

386
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:27,776
We have to get all six units adjusted
and link them by phone to headquarters.

387
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,029
That means training men to operate
an information center...

388
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,574
...so they know what to do
with the information.

389
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,159
Take it easy, Murph.

390
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:40,330
- You'll figure it out.
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.

391
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:44,918
Don't just stand there.

392
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,045
You know how to operate this thing.

393
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,255
We know the theory.

394
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,424
Let's put that theory into practice.

395
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,343
- Switch on.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,432
Stay put and keep watching the screen.

397
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:02,394
In two hours, close down.
I'll send a truck to pick you up.

398
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,439
Excuse me, sir,
but what are we watching for?

399
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,815
Anything unusual.

400
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,234
Any large blip coming from the sea.

401
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,237
Colonel, if we do spot something,
what do we do?

402
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,032
Report it to headquarters, damn it.

403
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,575
LOCKARD: How, sir?
- What?

404
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,619
We haven't got a telephone, sir.

405
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:22,080
There's a gas station
a mile down the road.

406
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,749
They must have a phone.

407
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,931
We got 183 combat planes
on this base, general.

408
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,143
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed
monkey hanging from a balloon...

409
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,063
...could scatter them to hell
with one hand grenade.

410
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,981
General Short gave the order.

411
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,316
[KNOCKING]

412
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:50,734
Come in.

413
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:55,864
- Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch.
- Okay, send them in.

414
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:05,499
You two men get in your planes
and fly over to Haleiwa.

415
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,502
Yes, sir.

416
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,671
What are our orders when we get there?

417
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,756
Just sit tight.

418
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:15,384
Listen for the phone. That's all.

419
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,885
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

420
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:28,021
Haleiwa is one
of the subsidiary fields.

421
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:31,900
We send those two up there,
two more here.

422
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,029
Only way I know to disperse
a few of the planes.

423
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,786
If I'd get away with it, I'd send
all to the neighbor islands.

424
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:47,040
- You know why we're being transferred.
- Them poker games.

425
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:50,419
- Been winning too often.
- Yeah.

426
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,171
Some sucker loses his shirt,
so he bitches to the general.

427
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,381
That's it.

428
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,972
It's hard to believe
the Emperor agreed...

429
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,058
...to fix a date by which the
final decision must be made...

430
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,352
...between war and peace.

431
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:12,065
His majesty's signature
is a mere formality.

432
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:17,362
The cabinet is responsible for
all matters of national policy.

433
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:23,452
The Emperor recently read a poem
to his Ministers to show how he feels.

434
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,872
"If all people are brethren...

435
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,252
...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

436
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,717
"If all people are brethren...

437
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,596
...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

438
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:50,020
This clearly shows how much
the Emperor wants to avoid a war.

439
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:56,443
Yes, he has urged us to solve our
differences with Washington.

440
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:02,908
But, sir, the deadline is October.
Can a solution be found by then?

441
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,578
Perhaps. But if we fail...

442
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,749
...if war does come...

443
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:15,128
...tell me frankly,
from the Navy's viewpoint...

444
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,465
...what are our chances
against the Americans?

445
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:23,387
If we must, we can raise havoc
with them for a year.

446
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,140
After that, I can guarantee nothing.

447
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,774
Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you
will continue the negotiations.

448
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,319
Please remember, there is
no last word in diplomacy.

449
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,462
Tokyo has ignored
my repeated inquiries...

450
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:02,050
...and still has made no reply...

451
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:07,347
...to the compromise proposals
offered by Secretary Hull.

452
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,193
The war that I have dreaded
for so long...

453
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,573
...may soon become a reality.

454
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,704
Nomura has offered
his resignation several times.

455
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,206
But Tokyo won't let him quit.

456
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:39,629
Instead they're sending a second
ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out.

457
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:45,302
Do you really think
this Kurusu can do any good?

458
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,221
Well, I doubt it, Frank.

459
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,807
He's hardly the most tactful choice.

460
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,185
When he was ambassador in Berlin...

461
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:56,229
...he signed the Axis Pact
on behalf of Japan.

462
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:02,152
You will sail from Hittakopu Bay
on November 26 under my strict orders.

463
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,739
The code, "Climb Mt. Niitaka"
will be confirmation to go on.

464
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:10,202
We have tentatively set
the date for the attack...

465
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,581
...on Sunday, December 7th,
Hawaiian time.

466
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:22,881
But you must understand that we
are still negotiating in Washington.

467
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,052
If a peaceful solution is found...

468
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,931
...the fleet will be recalled at once.

469
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,773
Once at sea, to turn back
would be a disgrace!

470
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,901
It would destroy the morale of the men!

471
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,072
They're in a high state of readiness,
physically and psychologically.

472
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:54,287
Enough! If any commander is inclined
to reject an order to return...

473
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,957
...when the path for peace is open...

474
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,960
...let him resign now!

475
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,682
Finally, gentlemen...

476
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,436
...many misinformed Japanese...

477
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,983
...believe that America is a
nation divided, isolationist...

478
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,987
...and that Americans are
only interested...

479
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,949
...in enjoying a life of luxury...

480
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:35,495
...and are spiritually
and morally corrupt.

481
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,748
But that is a great mistake.

482
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,836
If war becomes inevitable...

483
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:50,635
...America would be the most formidable
foe that we have ever fought.

484
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,644
I've lived in Washington
and studied at Harvard...

485
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:04,316
...so I know the Americans are
a proud and just people.

486
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,368
- You sick or something?
- No.

487
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,789
I've been piecing together this
batch of new intercepts.

488
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,793
- A frightening picture is taking shape.
- Oh?

489
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:27,464
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu
asked their government...

490
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:32,636
...to extend a deadline for suspending
negotiation between Japan and America.

491
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,679
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

492
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:38,892
Now, according to this latest
intercept...

493
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:42,646
...Tokyo wants to conclude
negotiations with us...

494
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:45,815
...no later than November 29...

495
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,568
...after which, and I quote:

496
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:51,529
"Things are automatically
going to happen."

497
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,073
Now...

498
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:56,201
...look at this intelligence report
from the British.

499
00:49:57,286 --> 00:50:00,330
Five Japanese troop transports
with naval escort...

500
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,917
...were sighted off Formosa,
heading south.

501
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:08,380
We've been monitoring their fleet.
Most of it seems to be on home waters.

502
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,715
I'm not so sure.

503
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,350
I'd make a bet they're going to attack us.

504
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,564
Japan is going to attack us.

505
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,069
The 29th is only four days off.

506
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,781
The 30th is on a Sunday.

507
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,537
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday,
the 30th of November.

508
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,253
The pieces fit together.

509
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:53,466
But can you prove it?

510
