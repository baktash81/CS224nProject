1
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,584
Ben.

2
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,053
Ben.

3
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,390
Ben!

4
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,424
Ben!

5
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,961
What?

6
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,963
What?
What's the matter, huh?

7
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,365
Can't you hear me?

8
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,600
- Are you deaf?
- Stop it, Robbie.

9
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,002
Go to sleep, boys.

10
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,604
Sorry, Mom.

11
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:45,872
Sorry, Aunt Jenny.

12
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,575
Shut up.

13
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,433
Hey, guess what.
We forgot a present.

14
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,803
What's that?

15
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,640
Constellations.

16
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,007
Catch.

17
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,977
Ca... Oh...

18
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,952
You really do live
in a museum.

19
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,390
Why do you always look so sad,
Benjamin Wilson?

20
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,429
Hmm. Neat.

21
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:53,433
It's like the one
we saw on the trail.

22
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,469
Thanks, Mom.

23
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,471
Sure, handsome.

24
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,007
So?

25
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,177
Yes?

26
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,046
Was my dad an astronomer?

27
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:15,555
Maybe that's why I like
outer space so much.

28
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,424
Makes sense.

29
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,965
Happy birthday,
Mr. 12-Year-Old.

30
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,741
Don't stay up too long.

31
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,898
Mom?

32
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,740
Mom!

33
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,074
Geez... God, you scared me.

34
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,043
What are you doing out of bed?

35
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,212
Why won't you ever
talk about him?

36
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,850
Other kids know their dads.

37
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,519
Not now, Ben.
Go back to bed.

38
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,688
It's what I wished for,
you know?

39
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,724
When I blew out the candles.

40
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,594
Another time, okay?

41
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,129
When it's the right time.

42
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,031
It's never the right time.

43
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,805
What does this mean?

44
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,707
What, Ben?

45
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,308
This quote.

46
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,843
"We are all in the gutter,

47
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,279
but some of us are
looking at the stars."

48
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,615
You said it the night
we saw the shooting stars,

49
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,251
and now it's on your wall.

50
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,287
Well, what do you think
it means?

51
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,625
That's what you always say.

52
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,141
"We are all in the gutter,

53
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,877
but some of us are
looking at the stars."

54
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,248
Mom.

55
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,083
Are you...?

56
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,337
- Ben!
- Janet?

57
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,972
What are you doing here?

58
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,474
No, what are you doing here?

59
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,185
This isn't your house.
Those aren't your clothes.

60
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,649
I shouldn't have
turned the light on.

61
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:52,946
- Benji, I...
- You smoke?!

62
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,248
No. I-I mean...

63
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,926
God, please don't tell my
parents, they're gonna kill me.

64
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,017
I don't understand.

65
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,919
You're wearing my mom's
clothes!

66
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,420
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

67
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,356
I-I just...
I needed somewhere.

68
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,100
This was supposed to be
my secret place, I just need...

69
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,093
I can't look at you like that.

70
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,161
Oh, gosh.

71
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,262
A-Are you okay?

72
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,097
Yes, I'm fine.

73
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,966
Sorry.

74
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,544
Are your parents
gonna sell this house?

75
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,280
I heard them
talking about it.

76
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:32,051
Why can't I just move back in?

77
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,187
- It's my house.
- I know.

78
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,190
And Robbie's kind of a pest.

79
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,326
If I knew where my dad was,
I could just...

80
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,465
Are you still having
those nightmares?

81
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,669
Not...

82
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,938
Sometimes.

83
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,111
Come on, we should...

84
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,278
We should go home, probably.

85
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,414
- I am home.
- I know, but...

86
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,649
You go.

87
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,551
I just want to stay here
a little longer.

88
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,620
That's, that's really not
a good idea.

89
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,323
There's supposed to be storms.

90
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,125
I won't tell your parents.

91
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,392
What?

92
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,162
That you were smoking.

93
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,366
Just let me stay
a little longer.

94
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,003
You really won't tell?
Seriously.

95
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,005
Yeah, I swear.

96
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,608
Oh, my God, then I completely
owe you a favor, Benji.

97
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,610
For real.

98
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,484
We all miss her, you know.

99
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,158
Don't stay too long. Okay?

100
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,495
Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no.

101
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,867
Uhh!

102
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,863
"A curator's job
is an important one,

103
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,333
"for it is the curator
who decides

104
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,701
what belongs in the museum."

105
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,774
"In a way,
anyone who collects things

106
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,945
in the privacy of his own home
is a curator."

107
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,451
"But how did
the very first curators

108
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,853
"store their collections?

109
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,522
"They were kept
in pieces of furniture

110

"called Cabinets of Wonder.

111
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,996
"Eventually, some collections
grew beyond the confines

112
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:15,268
"of a single cabinet

Where am I?

129
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:02,087
What's wrong?

130
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,089
Hello?

131
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,185
I can't talk!

I can't... I can't talk!

133
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,535
"Sorry" is unacceptable,

134
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,546
and you need to get the police
on the phone right now

135
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,405
and they need
to be coming here!

136
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,307
And you have security
that you can call

137
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,076
- that can close the doors!
- I understand.

you want a blow?

Hey,
I'll catch up with you later!

Hey! Stop!

165
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,793
Give that back!

166
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,547
Hey, taxi!

167
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,188
Yeah. Go through,
go through, go through.

168
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,170
What you looking at?

169
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:30,687
- Ahh!
- Watch it.

170
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,127
Sorry.

171
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,561

for the bookstore,

- ¿Qué pasa?
- A few blocks down.

174
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,734
- On 74th.
- Vamos, Jamie.

175
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,102
Llego tarde.

176
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,537
- I was just telling him.
- Come on.

177
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,639
Hey.

178
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,218
Wait. Espera.

Okay.

180
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,421
Ahora.

181
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,776
Okay, Jamie. Entonces...

182
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,678
3:00 en punto en mi oficina.
Okay?

183
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,248
- Sí, Papa.
- No se meta en problemas.

184
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,684
- I don't want another call from security.
- Okay.

188
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,007
"thousands of years ago.

189
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,511
"It was brought
to the museum in 1902.

190
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,746
"All meteorites begin
their journeys to Earth

191
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,485
as shooting stars,
burning across the night sky."

192
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,758
Mm-hmm, and look.

193
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,326
This is, like, the outside.

194
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:17,634
In the nighttime.

195
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:39,823
Anyway...

196
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:43,894
I thought you would like
this one over here.

197
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,267
This one here.

198
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,738
Since you have it on your...

199
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,807
Over here.

200
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,167
Oh, my...

201
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,469
What's going on?

202
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,708
Are you... are you okay?

203
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:36,246
What's happening?

204
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,314
Are you sick?

205
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:46,189
Why did you stop here,
in front of this?

206
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:48,224
Shh.

207
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,963
I thought you liked wolves.

208
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:56,900
You dropped it in the rotunda.

209
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,069
I can't hear you.

210
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,772
Why?

211
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:03,273
Because I'm deaf.

212
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,375
Really?

213
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:08,979
Oh.

214
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,782
That's... I thought
you were ignoring me

215
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:14,851
when I was calling for you,
and you didn't answer.

216
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,987
- Makes sense now.
- Here.

217
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,824
Oh.

218
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,127
I didn't know you were deaf.

219
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,264
Me... Jamie.

220
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,905
Jamie.

221
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,439
I'm Ben.

222
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:38,775
Shh.

223
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,950
I learned it in school.

224
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,352
I don't know sign language.

225
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:50,486
Why?

226
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,924
I've only been deaf for...

227
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,861
Actually, it just happened.

228
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:59,429
How?

229
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:03,433
- Lightning.
- Lightning?

230
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,236
I thought lightning kills you.

231
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:10,306
Oh.

232
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,344
Lightning... kills you.

233
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:18,982
Not always.

234
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,992
Being hit by lightning?

235
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,026
Uh-uh.

236
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:40,570
Oh. Not...

237
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:44,140
Sometimes.

238
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:47,277
Mostly it's just quiet.

239
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,287
See that lady over there?

240
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,621
What?

241
01:00:58,654 --> 01:01:02,125
She's always here.
It's so weird.

242
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,829
You... runaway?

243
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,133
Mm-hmm.

244
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,169
- From where?
- What?

245
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,909
Where... are you from?

246
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,931
Really?

247
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,734
Shh.

248
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:57,473
Up here.

249
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,147
Shh.

250
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,309
Huh.

251
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,147
What is this place?

252
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,015
My secret room.

253
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:50,760
My secret... room.

254
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,697
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

255
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:57,167
You can stay here.

256
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,039
This can be...

257
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:06,109
your hideout.

258
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,215
Thanks.

259
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:14,584
So...

260
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:17,453
- why run...
- "Why..."

261
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:20,156
- ...away?
- "...run away?"

262
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,724
Oh.

263
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,530
Um...

264
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,367
My mom.

265
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:35,371
Oh.

266
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,207
Yeah.

267
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,345
Sorry.

268
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:47,150
What about your dad?

269
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,423
That's who I came here to find.

270
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,194
Are your parents... divorced?

271
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,765
No.

272
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,500
Mine are.

273
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:07,370
Hmm. Oh.

274
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,343
You know, I thought
he might be here, but...

275
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,344
Oh.

276
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:18,148
I tried to tell you before.

277
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:19,582
Kincaid's...

278
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,786
isn't clo...

279
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,523
What?

280
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,525
...open now.

281
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:34,497
Yeah, obviously.

282
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,466
Hey, I didn't know
you were deaf.

283
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,901
I didn't know you were
looking for your father.

284
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:40,470
Otherwise, I wouldn't have...

285
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:43,373
What are you saying?
Write it down.

286
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:45,375
Yeah. Sorry.

287
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:48,644
So, I still don't understand

288
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:53,849
how you... got here alone.

289
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,786
My cousin Janet helped me.

290
01:05:56,819 --> 01:06:00,856
She owed me a favor,
so she brought my bag

291
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,692
and some things,

292
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,927
with some money
from my mother's

293
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,729
rainy-day fund.

294
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:11,501
So she... knows

295
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,604
where you are?

296
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,707
No.

297
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,609
No one knows where I am.

298
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,815
I do.

299
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:32,355
Oh...

300
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,789
I'm starving.

301
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,491
Oh.

302
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,531
Ta-da!

303
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:47,903
There you go.

304
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,372
Thank you.

305
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:02,918
- "A."
- "A."

306
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:06,489
- "B."
- "B."

307
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,324
"C."

308
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:12,928
- "D."
- "D."

309
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:15,931
"E."

310
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:17,700
"F."

311
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:21,571
- "F."
- Mm-hmm.

312
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,239
"G."

313
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,976
- "G."
- Mm-hmm.

314
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,879
Mm... "H."

315
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:34,284
"I."

316
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,687
"J."

317
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,821
"J."

318
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:41,624
Mm...

319
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:44,660
"U."

320
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:47,430
Um... "V."

321
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,599
"V." "W"?

322
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,801
"W."

323
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,969
"X."

324
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,371
"Y."

325
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,406
"Z."

326
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:00,876
Mm-hmm.

327
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,812
Good.

328
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:03,879
Oh!

329
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,748
I almost forgot.

330
01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:13,656
Huh.

331
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,959
Hmm. Remember her?

332
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:18,728
Mm.

333
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,764
My mom. Mi madre.

334
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,066
She works a lot.

335
01:08:24,099 --> 01:08:28,304
We live in...

336
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:29,972
Queens.

337
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:33,709
Queens?

338
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:35,911
- Mm-hmm.
- You don't live in New York?

339
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,516
Queens is in New York.

340
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,455
What?

341
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,423
- Forget it.
- Oh.

342
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,925
And this.

343
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,461
Whoa.

344
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,729
I found it in my mom's room.

345
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:56,766
It's from here.

346
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,703
Except a long time ago.

347
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:05,541
It's where I found
the bookmark from Kincaid's.

348
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,011
It's why I'm here.

349
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,685
Hey, you okay?

350
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:20,823
Sorry, I'm just really tired.

351
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:27,797
Well, take a nap.

352
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,599
Okay.

353
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,741
Hmm?

354
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,747
Ooh.

355
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:51,521
- Um, I'll be back later.
- Thanks, Jamie.

356
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:50,740
Ben!

357
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:52,074
- Ben!
- Ow.

358
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:54,677
Wake up!
Come on, I told my father

359
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,622
- I was staying over at a friend's house...
- What?

360
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,757
- So we have the whole museum to ourselves!
- I can't hear you.

361
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:02,251
Follow me, come on, come on!

362
01:12:31,781 --> 01:12:33,783
Shh. Come on.

363
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,606
Wow.

364
01:12:57,907 --> 01:12:59,174
Hey, look.

365
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,976
- See?
- Hmm.

366
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,211
The light goes through.

367
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,721
Neat.

368
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:14,757
Look at this.

369
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:15,991
Look.

370
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,097
This is cool. Ha.

371
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:27,236
Wow.

372
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,813
- Hey.
- Hmm?

373
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:39,581
Check this out.

374
01:13:40,415 --> 01:13:41,784
Hey, little guy.

375
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,686
Ben.

376
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:51,093
- Huh?
- Ben.

377
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,028
Come on.

378
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:54,897
Let's go.

379
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:17,853
Jamie, what is all this stuff?

380
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:19,789
Shh.

381
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,658
Secrets.

382
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:25,160
Come on.

383
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:08,137
- Open it!
- What?

384
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,238
Come on, the file.

385
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:11,774
- Hmm?
- Open it up.

386
01:15:14,509 --> 01:15:16,245
- The wolves.
- Whoa.

387
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,983
That is so cool.

388
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:24,920
"February '65."

389
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:26,956
That's the year
before I was born.

390
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,231
Whoa.

391
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,432
Whoa.

392
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:40,035
Yeah. Wow.

393
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:45,775
- Aurora.
- Nice.

394
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:47,943
Hmm.

395
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:49,311
Look at this one.

396
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,384
What? What is it?

397
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:56,919
It's my house.

398
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:15,537
"Miss Elaine Wilson."

399
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:18,307
That's my mom.

400
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,542
"Dear Miss Wilson,

401
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,845
"I will be spending
a few months in Gunflint Lake,

402
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:26,115
"researching a new diorama
for the museum.

403
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,482
"As the town librarian,

404
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:30,853
"I hope you can help me
with this research.

405
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:34,256
"Please contact me
at the address above.

406
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:36,792
"Thank you very much,

407
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:39,528
Daniel Lobel."

408
01:16:41,864 --> 01:16:43,866
Daniel Lobel.

409
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:48,938
This has to be my dad.

410
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,942
Your father,
maybe he still remembers him.

411
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,145
You have to ask him
in the morning.

412
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,480
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

413
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:20,870
"I've... never... shown...

414
01:17:20,903 --> 01:17:23,438
"anyone... the museum...

415
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,341
...before."

416
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,609
Hmm.

417
01:17:27,642 --> 01:17:30,980
- Hmm.
- But I like it here.

418
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:33,382
I don't have a room
at my dad's place.

419
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:37,152
Oh, hold on.

420
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:40,022
I think you'll like this.

421
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,966
Oh.

422
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,302
I forgot.

423
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,039
It's okay, keep it on.

424
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:59,408
My mom had one like this.

425
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:02,577
I can feel the vibrations.

426
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,880
I...

427
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:07,917
Don't want to know your name

428
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:11,286
'Cause you don't look the same

429
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,487
- "F."
- The way you did

430
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,958
- "R."
- Before

431
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:18,427
- "I."
- Okay, okay

432
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,229
- Hmm.
- You think you got a pretty face

433
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,596
"E."

434
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:22,998
"N."

435
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,934
Mm...

436
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,368
"D." "Friend." Cool.

437
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:30,005
You looked all right before

438
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,243
Fox on the run

439
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,644
You scream

440
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:39,314
And everybody comes a-running

441
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:42,351
Take a run and hide...

442
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,535
Ahh!

443
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,452
Ben, Ben.

444
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:05,354
Ben.

445
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:07,856
Wake up!

446
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:09,791
Come on.

447
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:11,593
Come on.

448
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,628
- What?
- Look.

449
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:19,801
It's the same.

450
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:22,337
It's the same.

451
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:25,907
We're in
the Cabinet of Wonders.

452
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,443
How did this happen?

453
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,846
Why did my father
have this book?

454
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:37,186
Why was there a picture
of my house

455
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:38,853
in that file?

456
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:42,791
What's going on?

457
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,228
What?

458
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,533
What?

459
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,742
The bookstore? It's gone.

460
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,317
"I tried to tell you.

461
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:11,520
"It just moved.

462
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:13,622
"I didn't know...

463
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,358
you were deaf yet."

464
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,195
What do you mean?

465
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:23,898
You knew I was trying
to find my father.

466
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:26,768
That's why I went to Kincaid's
in the first place.

467
01:23:28,637 --> 01:23:30,605
Why would you wait until now?

468
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,475
Because
I don't have any friends.

469
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:34,909
What?

470
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:37,412
What?!

471
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:42,651
"I wanted...

472
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:43,852
"to show...

473
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:46,588
you stuff."

474
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,958
"I wanted to show you stuff"?

475
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:51,493
What does that mean?

476
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:52,803
- I was afraid if you found your father
- What?

477
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:54,372
- He would take you away.
- I can't hear you.

478
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,006
- And if you didn't find him,
- I don't understand!

479
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,408
You'd just go back
to Gunflint Lake.

480
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:00,435
I was going to tell you.

481
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:02,404
You were going to tell me?

482
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,972
Yes, I swear.

483
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:06,941
How long were you going
to take?

484
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,415
I'm sorry, okay?

485
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:14,649
Please.

486
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:16,785
Just...

487
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,396
Yeah.

488
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,963
Well, if you wanted
to be my friend,

489
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:31,666
you would've helped me
find my father.

490
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,269
But... I'm helping you.

491
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:35,604
I'm helping you!

492
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,406
I'm helping you now!

493
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:00,955
I turn to the right

494
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:06,895
A little white light

495
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:10,365
Will lead you to my...

496
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:13,768
Blue heaven.

497
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:15,404
- I'll be right with you.
- Hello?

498
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:02,684
I'm sorry,

499
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:04,837
she's a little high-strung
first thing in the morning.

500
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:08,857
Hello?

501
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:14,095
You're scaring off
the customers!

502
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:06,307
Hello, Kincaid's.

503
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:07,776
Yes, of course.

504
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:09,678
We have lots of Dickens.

505
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:12,781
Oh, yes, we have four or five
copies, I believe.

506
01:29:12,814 --> 01:29:14,248
Yup.

507
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,250
Um, yeah.
We're open till 5:00.

508
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:17,652
Ask for me. Walter.

509
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:40,675
Hello.
I-I didn't see you there.

510
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:42,176
Are you...

511
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,912
Did-did I wake you?

512
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:49,651
You can't hear?

513
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:52,053
I don't know sign language.

514
01:29:58,026 --> 01:30:00,762
- You can hear?
- Yes.

515
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:02,697
But she's deaf?

516
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,733
Yes.

517
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:09,270
I had an accident.

518
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:11,105
Recently.

519
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:13,041
That's why I can't hear.

520
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:22,784
You s-s... you scared us.

521
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:30,391
Are you okay?

522
01:30:30,424 --> 01:30:32,761
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

523
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:34,929
Thanks.

524
01:30:34,963 --> 01:30:38,166
I, uh, I just fell asleep
for a second.

525
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:30,719
How do you know my name?

526
01:31:58,212 --> 01:32:00,214
Did you know her?

527
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:42,256
I came here
trying to find my father.

528
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:47,361
He's looking for his father.

529
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:49,497
Who are you?

530
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:51,732
How do you know my name?

531
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:12,821
I saw you

532
01:33:12,854 --> 01:33:15,389
at-at the wolf diorama
in the museum.

533
01:33:20,228 --> 01:33:23,064
What is going on?

534
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,099
Tell me!

535
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:43,985
Where?

536
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:46,888
Come.

537
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:45,733
Whoa.

538
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:52,573
Wow.

539
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:59,147
What is this?

540
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:03,117
Where are we?

541
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:36,284
"I need you to be patient with
this story and read it slowly.

542
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:41,355
"I've worked in the Queens
Museum of Art for 15 years now,

I need to tell you

"begins a long time
before that.

01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:52,133
"When I was
a little girl in 1927,

I didn't even know
such a school existed."

"My parents divorced

01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:03,204
"everyone worried about us
raising a hearing child,

564
01:39:03,237 --> 01:39:04,805
"but our boy managed to handle

565
01:39:04,838 --> 01:39:07,508
his lack of deafness
just fine."

566
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:13,481
"Soon after I'd married,
Walter helped me get a job

567
01:39:13,514 --> 01:39:16,484
at the museum
in the Exhibitions Department."

568
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:22,556
"I'd always loved making
models, so it suited me well."

569
01:39:26,727 --> 01:39:30,564
"I worked there for many years
alongside my son."

570
01:39:32,566 --> 01:39:34,235
"But soon

571
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:39,407
planning began
for the 1964 World's Fair."

572
01:39:41,409 --> 01:39:42,676
The Unisphere

573
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:44,278
would have to withstand

574
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:46,214
the ever-changing forces
of nature,

575
01:39:46,247 --> 01:39:47,848
as well as its own
enormous weight.

576
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:49,383
"One of the attractions

577
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:51,452
"was going to be the panorama,

578
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:54,622
"a scale model of the
entire city of New York,

579
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:58,259
"the largest architectural
model ever built.

580
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:00,628
"It was an opportunity
I couldn't pass up,

581
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:03,531
"so I left the Museum
of Natural History

582
01:40:03,564 --> 01:40:06,867
"to work on the panorama
in Queens.

583
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:10,638
"Sadly, my Bill had
passed away by then,

584
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:14,542
"so it was just my son and me.

585
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:18,679
"When the world's fair ended,
the panorama was so popular,

586
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:20,548
"they decided to keep it open.

587
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:22,483
"But they needed someone
to maintain the model,

588
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:24,718
so they hired me for the job."

589
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,490
"Around that time,
our son was appointed

590
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:31,892
"the lead designer
for a new diorama

591
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:34,428
"at the Museum
of Natural History,

592
01:40:34,462 --> 01:40:37,931
"the youngest person
ever to have that honor.

593
01:40:37,965 --> 01:40:41,769
"But you already
know this part.

594
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:46,707
The job would send him up
to Gunflint Lake."

595
01:40:50,944 --> 01:40:53,681
Your son...

596
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:55,316
is Danny?

597
01:41:08,496 --> 01:41:10,931
You're my grandmother.

598
01:41:15,503 --> 01:41:17,771
Where is he?

599
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:22,042
I came all the way
from Minnesota to find him.

600
01:41:22,075 --> 01:41:24,745
Where is he?

601
01:41:56,009 --> 01:42:00,047
"The librarian he'd contacted
to help him with his research

602
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:03,351
"happened to own a small cabin,

603
01:42:03,384 --> 01:42:05,018
and he rented it from her."

604
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:08,822
Miss Wilson, is that you?

605
01:42:08,856 --> 01:42:09,990
Am I in the right place?

606
01:42:10,023 --> 01:42:12,025
You are indeed, Mr. Lobel.

607
01:42:12,059 --> 01:42:13,827
The cabin is right over there.

608
01:42:13,861 --> 01:42:16,397
It's Danny.

609
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,399
Whoa!

610
01:42:18,432 --> 01:42:19,967
I don't like the ice.
I don't trust it.

611
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,802
Come on, Danny,
it's not gonna break.

612
01:42:21,835 --> 01:42:23,671
It's two feet thick.

613
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:25,573
- Don't you trust me?
- I'm not sure right now.

614
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:29,009
"Dear Mom,
the research is going well.

615
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:34,047
Very helpful staff,
especially this librarian."

616
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,056
"Eventually, he completed

617
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:46,494
"the diorama of the wolves.

618
01:42:46,527 --> 01:42:49,029
"I still go to visit it
whenever I can.

619
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:52,065
It's the only one
he got to make."

620
01:43:24,632 --> 01:43:27,735
"Your dad was ill, Ben.

621
01:43:27,768 --> 01:43:31,605
"He had a heart condition,
the same one his father had.

622
01:43:31,639 --> 01:43:34,007
"It kept him out of the war,

623
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:37,110
"but a few years after
he returned from Gunflint Lake,

624
01:43:37,144 --> 01:43:39,146
his heart..."

625
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:47,247
"This panorama is not just
a model of New York City.

626
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,884
It's also the story
of your father's life."

627
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:57,658
"When I took the job,

628
01:44:57,691 --> 01:44:59,259
"I thought it would be fun

629
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:02,563
to secretly personalize
the panorama."

630
01:45:04,598 --> 01:45:07,535
"I hid little mementos
from your father's life

631
01:45:07,568 --> 01:45:09,903
inside the buildings."

632
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:47,575
We're gonna miss him.

633
01:45:47,608 --> 01:45:48,709
There's nobody like him.

634
01:45:48,742 --> 01:45:50,043
So, to Danny.

635
01:45:50,077 --> 01:45:52,212
- To Danny.
- Hear, hear.

636
01:45:52,245 --> 01:45:54,848
"I knew everyone
at Danny's funeral

637
01:45:54,882 --> 01:45:56,750
"except for two people,

638
01:45:56,784 --> 01:45:59,052
"a woman and a little boy.

639
01:45:59,086 --> 01:46:01,221
"She introduced herself,

640
01:46:01,254 --> 01:46:04,725
"and I recognized her name
from Danny's letters.

641
01:46:04,758 --> 01:46:09,096
"She told me she'd
brought her son earlier

642
01:46:09,129 --> 01:46:12,265
and showed him the diorama
Danny had made."

643
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:20,841
I don't remember any of this.

644
01:46:27,314 --> 01:46:29,617
That's why I dreamed of them.

645
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:31,218
The wolves.

646
01:46:31,251 --> 01:46:33,987
I saw them.

647
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,205
What happened?

648
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,975
- Help.
- Come.

649
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:40,320
Jamie?

650
01:47:40,353 --> 01:47:43,223
Wait, how did you get here?

651
01:47:43,256 --> 01:47:44,391
I followed you.

652
01:47:54,902 --> 01:47:56,837
Wait.

653
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:58,005
I don't understand.

654
01:47:58,038 --> 01:47:59,940
- What?
- She's the lady from...

655
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,174
Oh, she...

656
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:12,052
This special
radio red alert news report.

657
01:48:12,085 --> 01:48:15,055
A major power blackout
has hit New York City

658
01:48:15,088 --> 01:48:17,124
and surrounding communities.

659
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:19,793
Well, George,
there are individuals

660
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:21,829
directing traffic
at the intersection.

661
01:48:21,862 --> 01:48:24,097
Uh, I-I assume many of them
are policemen.

662
01:48:24,131 --> 01:48:25,866
Uh, some of them...

663
01:49:23,891 --> 01:49:25,893
Oh.

664
01:49:29,462 --> 01:49:31,999
My...

665
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:45,879
Friend.

666
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:42,289
Ground Control to Major Tom

667
01:52:45,758 --> 01:52:50,163
Ground Control to Major Tom

668
01:52:54,001 --> 01:52:56,169
Take your protein pills

669
01:52:56,203 --> 01:52:59,672
And put your helmet on

670
01:53:02,475 --> 01:53:08,115
- Ten, nine, eight
- Ground Control to Major Tom

671
01:53:08,148 --> 01:53:11,384
Seven, six

672
01:53:11,418 --> 01:53:16,256
- Commencing countdown, engines on
- Five, four

673
01:53:16,289 --> 01:53:19,226
Three, two

674
01:53:19,259 --> 01:53:21,161
- Check ignition
- One

675
01:53:21,194 --> 01:53:25,565
- And may God's love go with you
- Liftoff

676
01:53:31,604 --> 01:53:36,543
Ground Control to Major Tom

677
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:40,013
You've really made the grade

678
01:53:41,714 --> 01:53:45,118
And the papers want to know

679
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:49,322
Whose shirts you wear

680
01:53:49,356 --> 01:53:53,160
Now it's time
to leave the capsule

681
01:53:53,193 --> 01:53:56,063
If you dare

682
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:01,134
Ground Control to Major Tom

683
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:04,704
Your circuit's dead,
there's something wrong

684
01:54:04,737 --> 01:54:08,541
Can you hear us, Major Tom?

685
01:54:08,575 --> 01:54:12,412
Can you hear us,
Major Tom?

686
01:54:12,445 --> 01:54:16,149
Can you hear us, Major Tom?

687
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:20,753
Can you hear?

688
01:54:23,156 --> 01:54:27,760
Am I floating in a tin can

689
01:54:29,862 --> 01:54:34,767
Far above the moon

690
01:54:36,836 --> 01:54:39,706
Planet Earth is blue

691
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:43,776
And there's nothing I can do

692
01:54:49,882 --> 01:54:55,188
Though I'm past
a hundred thousand miles

693
01:54:55,222 --> 01:55:00,660
I'm feeling very still

694
01:55:00,693 --> 01:55:03,796
And I think my spaceship knows

695
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:08,135
Which way to go

696
01:55:08,168 --> 01:55:12,439
Tell my wife
I love her very much

697
01:55:12,472 --> 01:55:14,641
She knows

698
01:55:16,676 --> 01:55:19,746
Ground Control to Major Tom

699
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:23,583
Your circuit's dead,
there's something wrong

700
01:55:23,616 --> 01:55:27,354
Can you hear us, Major Tom?

701
01:55:27,387 --> 01:55:30,857
Can you hear us,
Major Tom?

702
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:34,727
Can you hear us, Major Tom?

703
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:40,167
Can you hear?
