1
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:34,200
Corey! Corey!

2
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,880
Hey. I'm so glad
you made it to town.

3
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,120
Didn't I tell you
I'd set you up?

4
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,200
Where am I supposed to put
all this stuff, anyway?

5
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,640
Right back here.
It's the new guest house.

6
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,800
Pretty cool, huh?

7
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,720
- Rad.
- What?

8
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,080
Is this where Corey's
gonna reside now?

9
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,360
No, man.
He's just gonna live here.

10
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,560
Hey, Tyler,
where's the new ramp?

11
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,440
I got to train
for the pool competition.

12
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,960
Whoa. Nice ramp, guys.

13
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,120
All right.

14
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,320
All right! Yeah.

15
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,200
- Come on, Bozy.
- Come on, Boze.

16
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,800
Yeah! Come on. Come on!

17
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,960
Come on, Boze.

18
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
Get it, Boze. Get up.

19
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah! Get it!

20
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,960
Come on, Bozy.

21
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,200
You got it.

22
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,640
All right. Way to go.

23
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,640
Come on, Tyler. You first.

24
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,680
Yeah. You designed it.

25
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,200
Nope. Nope.

26
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,200
You guys go first.
Someone else.

27
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,160
Oh, man. Come on.

28
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,760
You mean, Mr. Studly
is giving up...

29
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,320
first shot at a virgin ramp?

30
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,240
- That's right.
- Really?

31
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,720
So who's first?

32
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,840
Webster

33
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,200
No way, man. You guys built it.
You guys go first.

34
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,400
- Come on, Webster.
- Look. We need your opinion.

35
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,880
- You want my opinion?
- That's right.

36
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,360
OK. You got my opinion.

37
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,880
Tear it up.

38
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,160
All right!

39
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,320
Great!

40
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,880
All right!

41
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,720
Tequila

42
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,520
Tequila

43
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,760
- Cool quad-rubbers, Boze.
- Sit back and shut up.

44
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,160
Hey, I got shotgun next.
I'm tired of sitting bitch.

45
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,360
All right. It's all right.

46
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,720
Let's just get
to the beach, huh?

47
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Oh, God, Tyler.

48
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,640
Look, fellas. Look.
12 o'clock high...

49
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
tasty skatebetties, boy.

50
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,520
Oh, God, I love California.

51
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,840
- Come on.
- Hot pink.

52
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,720
Yo, baby! Hi.
You love me, right?

53
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm classy. I swear.
I know him.

54
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,560
Hey, guys. Guys. Check it out.
It's Hook and the Daggers.

55
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,120
- Thinks he's such a badass.
- Yeah.

56
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,320
What are those guys
trying to prove, anyway?

57
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,320
Man, the guy's
a killer, you know?

58
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,840
- I heard he actually...
- Hey, look. Monk's with him.

59
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,200
So what? He smells.

60
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,600
Yeah? Well, I caught him
spying on our ramp...

61
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,040
when we were trying to build it.

62
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,280
Yeah. Well, I knew him
when he was Ralph...

63
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,800
and he lived in the valley, man.

64
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,000
Now he's Monk,
and he thinks he's cool.

65
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,600
Breaking is a memory.

66
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,560
For wimps.

67
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,440
Wild, man. Acid rock.

68
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,560
Gnarly.

69
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,240
Hey, let's check it out.

70
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,200
Come on, Webster.

71
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,440
Let's me and you
shred the path, huh?

72
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,600
Gotcha.

73
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,480
Come on, man.

74
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,400
Damn, man.

75
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,440
- Hold it, Corey.
- What's wrong, man?

76
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,160
Look. I don't think
we should be here.

77
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
- Why not?
- This is the Daggers' place.

78
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,040
Daggers, huh?

79
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,920
Corey...

80
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,520
Beat it, you Val jerk.

81
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,400
All right, Per.

82
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,160
Hey, Chrissy.

83
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
Hi, Velvet. How are you?
Watch this guy.

84
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,640
Freestyle. Come on.

85
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,560
No, wait.
He's almost finished.

86
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,280
Hey, Chrissy,
your brother's waiting.

87
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,080
- Corey! Dude!
- Hey, Per. How you doing?

88
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,160
What are you doing in Dogtown?

89
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,560
Just here for the summer...

90
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,640
and I'm doing the L.A. Massacre
next week...

91
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,840
a pool competition tomorrow.

92
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,680
Chrissy, don't waste your time.
He's no Dagger.

93
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,800
Hey, come on.
Stop messing around.

94
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,040
This is serious.
Be cool, you guys.

95
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,400
Come here. Velvet, come here.

96
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,480
All right. Chrissy.
Chrissy, get in here.

97
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,920
Come on. Hurry up.

98
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,720
Get a picture of me
and my brat sister here.

99
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
She's visiting for the summer
from Indiana, man.

100
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,960
Tommy. Come on.

101
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,440
We're gonna make her
a movie star, aren't we?

102
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah, right.

103
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,720
- That's great. One more.
- Yeah! Daggers!

104
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,960
- Boze, it's so hot in here, man.
- We're not gonna make it.

105
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,160
Hey, Bozo, man...

106
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,720
where's the air conditioning
in this car, huh?

107
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,600
My father said
I wouldn't need it.

108
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,320
I don't know. I wanted
to get the convertible...

109
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,640
but he talked me
into this model.

110
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,640
I knew I should have gotten
that ragtop.

111
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,880
You really want a convertible?

112
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,600
Yeah.

113
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,440
Definitely?

114
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,280
Sure. Why not?

115
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,080
My brand-new car.
My father's gonna murder me.

116
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,600
What are you talking about, man?

117
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,400
You tell your father that this
was professionally done, Boze.

118
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,360
Come on, fellas.

119
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,200
Help me take the top off
this thing.

120
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,480
Aw, man.

121
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,560
Yeah. I got it.

122
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,680
- All right. Good work, Radster.
- Thank you.

123
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,120
He's gonna murder me.

124
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,080
Well, if my shop teacher
saw me doing this...

125
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
instead of them stupid ashtrays
he had me doing...

126
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,240
But it looks like an ashtray.

127
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,640
No, it does not.
You know what you've got here?

128
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,080
- This is a cabri-o-lette, man.
- What's that?

129
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,440
That's Hungarian for "fast car."

130
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,560
- Really?
- Yeah.

131
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Hey, let's paint the sucker.

132
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,160
Boze, you just got yourself
a skate cruiser.

133
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,040
Oh, this car drives funny.

134
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,560
- Yeah?
- Tommy? It's me.

135
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,280
- Hey. Come on in.
- Hi.

136
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,520
Where have you been?
It's late.

137
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,680
I went to the mall to get
a dress for tonight.

138
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,480
Look.

139
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,160
You're gonna be the most
beautiful girl at the club.

140
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,160
I liked Venice today.
It was fun.

141
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,600
Yeah. Wild scene, huh?

142
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,320
You don't see those kind
of freaks in Indiana.

143
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,680
I like the skaters
and those break dancers.

144
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Breakers?
What do you think?

145
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,480
Should I wear this
skull and the dagger...

146
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,280
or the hoop and the dagger?

147
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,600
Nah. Just wear the dagger...
and a bone for your nose.

148
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,560
Don't be a smart ass.
It's important to me.

149
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,360
- A bone, huh?
- Tommy.

150
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,800
Hey, Corey!

151
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,680
Come on.
You'll miss the girls.

152
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,560
Yeah. I'm coming!
I'm coming, all right?

153
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,760
- All right.
- Radley.

154
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,240
Yo. What's up, man?

155
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,000
All right, Corey. Let's go.

156
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,000
Hey. Wait a minute.

157
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,400
Hey. Hey, Engledork...
out of the car, huh?

158
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,080
Yeah, buddy.
This is where we separate...

159
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,000
the men from the boys.

160
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,080
Hit it, Boze.

161
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,720
Hey, come on. Look.
It makes me taller.

162
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,600
- Ah, no.
- Sorry.

163
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,680
I hope you don't get laid!

164
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,120
- Yo.
- Stay right there, brother.

165
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,640
What's this shit?

166
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,600
It's called a bottle
in my lang...

167
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,000
- Got any more?
- No.

168
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Maybe one.

169
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,560
- That the last one?
- Yeah.

170
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,720
Hey! Ouch.

171
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,680
Gargantua, please.
Don't touch my Elvis.

172
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,000
- That's cute.
- Yeah. Later.

173
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,160
Hold on.

174
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,400
What, are you starting
your own bar inside, man?

175
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,360
Take a hike.

176
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,320
Chicks, man.
There's chicks here.

177
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,160
- Wild.
- Long time, no see, buddy.

178
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,640
Hey, Radley, give me
some of that jet fuel, man.

179
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,600
The dude at the door
scammed all my bottles, man.

180
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,760
I don't have nothing.

181
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,320
- Hey, Boze, buddy. You thirsty?
- Yeah.

182
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,800
Boze is thirsty.
Hey, man, you want a drink?

183
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,760
Yeah.

184
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,600
- Hey, drinks on the Bozeman.
- Hey, all right, Boze, man.

185
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,760
Let's rock.

186
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,120
This is raw!

187
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,880
- Hey, Rocky.
- All right, Hook.

188
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,080
My little sister Chrissy, bro.

189
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,480
All right, bro. Yeah.

190
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,800
At this time,
ladies and gentlemen...

191
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,080
you're going to hear
from a band...

192
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,640
a quartet of patented
gentlemen...

193
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,800
to rival those faces
even on Mount Rushmore.

194
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,080
Ladies and gentlemen...

195
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,600
will you please give
your most warm welcome?

196
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
The fabulous
Red Hot Chili Peppers...

197
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,880
the band that gets
your pulses pounding...

198
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,040
your senses reeling,
and sets your mouth on fire...

199
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,960
but right now,
ladies and gentlemen...

200
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,000
it's time for the Thrash Bash.

201
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,880
Pumpin' the blood through
the heart of New Orleans...

202
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,200
Radster!

203
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,320
Bourbon Street dream

204
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,600
She's just made
out of flesh and bone

205
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,840
But let me tell you, little boy,
you better leave her alone

206
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,120
Yeah, Leroy Brown
thought he was bad, too

207
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,040
Till she left him floatin'
in the old bayou

208
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,480
She's the kind of girl,
she's built like a bomb

209
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,440
She's the black eyed,
black eyed, black eyed blonde

210
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,400
Get down

211
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,680
Get it straight

212
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,560
She's black

213
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,320
She's blonde

214
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,200
That black eyed beauty
with the golden crotch

215
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,880
French electric sex cock
shocking swamp fox

216
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
Heathen queen of sleaze,
she's hot to box

217
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,800
But let me tell you, little boy,
she'll clean your clock

218
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,240
A slick and sly spy
stuck in the muck of the moat

219
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,840
Oh, blew his mind to find
a diamond in the boat

220
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,520
Double-o doomsday
for Mr. James Bond

221
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,440
She's the black eyed,
black eyed, black eyed blonde

222
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,440
Get down

223
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Black eyed "b," go

224
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,240
She's blonde

225
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,000
God, those kids
are crazy in there.

226
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,000
Back home in Indiana you don't
see that kind of stuff.

227
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
Oh, yeah?

228
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,680
Just frat parties
and homecoming dances.

229
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,680
They're just thrashers.
They're all right.

230
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,120
Thrashers.

231
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,160
That sounds like vandals
or juvenile delinquents...

232
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,120
troubled youth.

233
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,880
No. Thrashing, man.

234
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,400
It's just an aggressive
style of skating.

235
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,040
You know, we thrash.

236
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,120
Well, what do you thrash?

237
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,040
What do you got?

238
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,560
Oh, God.

239
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,080
What do you think,
you're a wild one or something?

240
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,200
Maybe.

241
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,720
What are you hanging out
with those clones for?

242
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,520
Daggers, why are you
hanging out with them?

243
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,320
I just met most of those guys,
but you know Tommy?

244
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,440
Everyone around here
calls him Hook?

245
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,720
Yeah, yeah. I know of Hook.
Punk poseur.

246
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,440
That's my brother.

247
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,480
And I'm a jerk.

248
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,840
Nah. You're OK.

249
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,840
Leroy Brown
thought he was bad, too

250
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
Till she left him floatin'
in the old bayou

251
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
She's the kind of girl,
she's built like a bomb

252
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,080
She's the black eyed,
black eyed, black eyed blonde

253
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,520
Get down

254
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
Spiders, skulls, and bones?

255
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,280
It's just the scene.
You want to try it?

256
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,080
No, no, no.
Those are dangerous.

257
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
Oh, come on.
I'll show you how to do it.

258
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,080
- Don't be afraid, all right?
- I'm not afraid.

259
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,200
Try it.

260
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,320
Put your foot right there.
You got it.

261
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,920
You got me?

262
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,880
Yeah, I got you.
Don't worry about it.

263
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,000
- You ready?
- Yeah.

264
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,960
All right.

265
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,760
Yeah. It's kind of fun.

266
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,920
Yeah, if you like
living dangerously.

267
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,840
- So do you skate every day?
- Training right now.

268
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
Training for a meet
called the L.A. Downhill.

269
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,000
- You wouldn't know of it.
- Sure. The downhill.

270
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,160
- How do you know of it?
- My brother's doing that one.

271
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,120
Oh, your brother, huh?

272
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,200
Yeah. He's been talking about it
ever since I got here.

273
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,920
He says they pay $1,000
to the winner of some race.

274
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,760
It's no little race.
It's a downhill.

275
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,080
You never been
to a downhill, have you?

276
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,200
25, 30 guys racing at speeds
of 40, 50 miles an hour.

277
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,360
Can't imagine the energy
of it, you know?

278
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,280
It's intense, and sometimes
they're racing on the boards...

279
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,800
and the board starts
to shake and wham!

280
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,760
Need a spatula to peel
you off the street.

281
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,720
Sounds like fun.

282
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,440
- You should try it sometime.
- OK.

283
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,200
Oh, my God.
Look how late it is.

284
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,160
We better go.

285
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,800
Come on. I got that pool
competition in four hours.

286
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,960
Come on.

287
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,960
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

288
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,640
I wish I could be there.
Good luck.

289
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,680
- Where have you been?
- God, you scared me.

290
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,880
Good because you scared me.
Where were you?

291
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,800
- Out.
- What do you mean you were out?

292
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,800
I go to the club last night
with my kid sister...

293
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,640
and I'm going... hey,
don't drink that.

294
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,800
Oh! It's foul.

295
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,960
- So where were you?
- You're not my boss, Tommy.

296
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,560
Hey, I'm the older brother.
I'm the one in charge.

297
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,000
You're the one in charge, huh?

298
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,360
You send Mom a picture...

299
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,720
of you looking
like some wild Indian...

300
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,040
and you're the one in charge?

301
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,920
That wild Indian picture
happens to be styling.

302
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,080
You don't know what you're
talking about.

303
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,840
Don't you think Mom's
concerned about you, Tommy?

304
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,840
Maybe I'm out here
looking after you.

305
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
That's a joke.

306
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,280
If this is the way
it's gonna be, Chrissy...

307
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,480
I don't even want you here.

308
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,800
You can just go back to Indiana.

309
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,440
Fine.

310
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Look, Tommy. I'm sorry, OK?

311
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,200
I should have come home.
I lost all track of time.

312
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,360
I'm sorry.

313
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,520
So where were you, huh?

314
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,320
Well, I met this guy.

315
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

316
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,920
- What's his name?
- Corey.

317
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,360
Does he live around here?

318
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,240
Not too far away.
Somewhere over the hill.

319
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,040
- He's from the valley?
- I think so.

320
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,320
Chrissy, how many times
have I told you...

321
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,320
you hang around here,
you hang out with Daggers.

322
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,920
If not, just go home, OK?
That's it.

323
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,000
- Fine.
- Fine.

324
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,160
Hey, Scarface,
want to come to bed now?

325
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
We still need our skaters that
made the final cut...

326
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
to get their safety gear on...

327
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,760
and check in with our starter
in the officials' area.

328
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,520
At this reading, it looks
like any of our finalists...

329
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,240
have a shot
at winning this thing.

330
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,560
Among those skaters
shooting at the trophies...

331
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,440
are Mark McCarthy,
Corey Webster...

332
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,560
Timmy Hanks, Vincent Haloy,
and Lou Range.

333
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,480
We still need Corey and Vincent
to check in.

334
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,560
The big question is...

335
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,880
who can pull off the McTwist
here in the final round?

336
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,240
Took a nice backside turn,
an extended handplant.

337
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,520
540 air. He follows it
with a backside air.

338
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,200
There's that backside carve.
Here it is.

339
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,120
Backside carve.

340
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,120
He uses that speed for an
incredible bionic backside air.

341
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,080
Boy, this vertical skating
is risky business.

342
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,480
Hal Luccio is out of the running
in the first round...

343
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,880
due to an injury.

344
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,040
Skaters can grab
another warm-up run.

345
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,560
Boy, Hal Luccio is hurt.

346
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,480
Corey Webster is on deck
to follow that...

347
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,560
but it's going to be
a tough act to follow.

348
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,560
Hal Luccio is
still grabbing his ankle.

349
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,760
Corey Webster is up.
We'll see what he does.

350
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,680
This young man,
under a lot of pressure.

351
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,600
It's hard to come right
straight ahead into a heat...

352
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,920
after the guy in front of you
has taken a bad wipeout.

353
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,560
Here's the countdown for Corey.

354
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,280
The pressure is on.

355
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,800
One second. Corey drops in.

356
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,720
He starts with
a nice backside carve...

357
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,160
sets it up into
an El Gario tail tap.

358
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,480
What a maneuver!

359
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,040
Connects it with
a finger flip handplant.

360
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,280
Setting it up
with another backside air.

361
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,000
Webster is ripping
this pool apart.

362
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,120
Here's a difficult judo air.

363
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,640
What a maneuver.
What a strong run.

364
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,440
Webster, with another handplant.

365
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,720
Let's see what he does next.

366
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,000
It's a 360 handplant.

367
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,520
This guy is tearing it apart.

368
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,520
And here comes his next trick.

369
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
It's going to be
a hot frontside grind.

370
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
What a routine!

371
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,960
A couple more maneuvers
from Webster...

372
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,920
before he runs out of time.

373
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,120
A backside air.

374
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,280
He must have taken it because...

375
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,640
Oh, Webster is down.

376
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,080
Oh, Webster is hurt!

377
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,080
Medics, please report
to the pool immediately.

378
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,680
Corey Webster, at the bottom
of the transition...

379
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,120
not able to hang on to his board
and unexplainably falls off.

380
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,720
This kid is in pain.

381
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,520
Medics, please...
your attention please...

382
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,480
to the poolside.

383
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,840
Boy, what a tough break
for Corey Webster.

384
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,000
Our judges still have to give
Corey a score for his run...

385
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,640
but that fall will
cost him dearly.

386
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,160
What a shame.

387
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,120
Our next skater up
is going to be Timmy Hanks...

388
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,400
Daggers.

389
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,680
Assholes.

390
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,360
Webster, you just got snaked,
man, that's all.

391
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,080
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

392
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,800
Those Daggers are vile, bro.

393
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,320
They think they rule L.A.

394
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,080
Hey, who's the geeze?

395
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,080
What are you, Bozo,
out of your blazing skull, man?

396
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,360
That's Sam Flood.

397
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,160
Bozo, he owns Smash Skateboards.

398
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,640
I mean, they say he
invented skateboarding.

399
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,000
Wow.

400
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,320
I'm going to go talk to him.
I'll see you guys later.

401
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,280
- All right.
- Good luck.

402
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,520
- Get an autograph for me.
- Yeah, a free... t-shirt.

403
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,560
Hey, Mr. Flood.

404
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,840
Thank you.

405
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
Mr. Flood.

406
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
- I know you.
- Yeah.

407
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,720
You're Webster, right?
Corey Webster?

408
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,160
I like your style, kid.

409
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,600
Thanks.

410
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,800
Hey, you want to see something?

411
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,920
- Sure.
- Look at that.

412
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,200
- Oh, Mondo.
- Yeah.

413
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,120
I signed him five minutes after
he won the Tahoe Downhill.

414
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,960
You know, he's going
to make two bucks...

415
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,440
off of each board I sell.

416
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,280
You know, he'll probably make
twenty thousand this year...

417
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,440
and I understand...

418
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,520
he's also going to go
on tour with the Beach Boys.

419
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,720
You win the L.A. Downhill...

420
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,560
and you'll skate
for Smash Skates.

421
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,760
If you're not doing
anything tomorrow, drop by.

422
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,000
I'll give you
a tour of the factory.

423
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,160
All right. Definitely.

424
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,520
OK, kid!

425
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,920
- Thanks a lot, Mr. Flood.
- Good seeing you, kid.

426
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,960
OK, and then the application...
and... way to go.

427
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,840
Hey, that's how it's done,
huh, Webster?

428
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,120
- Like it?
- Yeah.

429
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,280
Thank you, Paul.

430
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,240
You know, Webster, I always like
to meet the new skaters.

431
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,960
You did Del Mar, didn't you?

432
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,920
Yeah, I did that one.

433
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,800
Yeah. You know, a couple
more meets like that...

434
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,040
you'll be skating Smash Skates.

435
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,520
You know, I only
sign the winners...

436
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,120
guys that are hot.

437
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,200
Here. Take a look at this.

438
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,680
See that?

439
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,640
That's seven-ply...

440
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,560
seven layers of a thin veneer...

441
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,120
that are bonded
together, cross-grain...

442
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,400
to form a board that's
practically indestructible.

443
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Go ahead. Bite that.

444
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,560
Sink your teeth into it.

445
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,480
This is a new secret
thermoplastic resin.

446
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,200
In the event
of an atomic attack...

447
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,120
this would be the only
thing that would survive.

448
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,360
Call for Mr. Flood
on line three.

449
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,800
Excuse me a second.

450
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,600
I'm going to skate
for these guys.

451
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,920
All right.
Hollywood Boulevard.

452
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,080
Let's hit it, girls.

453
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,440
All right. Coming through.
Watch out!

454
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,200
Guys, get into it!

455
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,400
Look out!

456
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,280
Grab on to his bike.

457
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,320
All right.

458
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,200
That was great!

459
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,400
Hey, Bozo. Bozo, come here.

460
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,120
You see that really raw
chick over there, man?

461
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,160
She came up to me inside.

462
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,520
She told me that she thought
you were real, real, real fine.

463
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,720
Yeah. So I thought maybe
if you got down in...

464
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,120
like, a surf-two position,
you know...

465
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,080
like this on the board...

466
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,560
you know, as you go by,
they would really dig you.

467
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
So put your board down.

468
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,000
Get in, like,
a surf-two position.

469
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
Here. Wait. Hold on.

470
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,160
Come on. Go back
over there, Bozo.

471
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,400
Hi. Nice eyes.

472
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,920
Hello, Chrissy, is that you?

473
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,840
Who may I ask
is speaking, please?

474
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,920
This is Corey Webster.
Why? Who's this?

475
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,680
Corey Webster. How you doing?

476
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,600
I heard you had a little
accident yesterday.

477
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,360
It was no accident,
Hook, and you know it.

478
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,680
Now put Chrissy on the phone.

479
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,640
Well, Chrissy's busy,
man, and, uh...

480
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,160
she'll be busy for
the rest of the summer...

481
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,680
so why don't you
not call back here?

482
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,560
- Put her on the phone!
- Oh, and, Corey...

483
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,040
you come near Chrissy again,
and you're dead meat.

484
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,920
Oh, yeah?
Well, after the L.A. Massacre...

485
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
you're dead meat, Hook.

486
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,320
You'd just better make sure...

487
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,760
I don't see your ass
before then.

488
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,800
And, Corey, one more thing.

489
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,040
Shit.

490
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,120
Now, isn't this a coincidence?

491
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,240
I come outside...

492
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,720
at the same time you're
hanging out in my tree.

493
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,480
Can I see you
for a few minutes?

494
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,080
Just a few minutes?
Is that all it's going to take?

495
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,840
- Hey, Chrissy.
- Hi, Velvet.

496
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,800
Come on in. Chiffon's
ready to paint your face.

497
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,200
OK. I'll be in in a second.

498
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,560
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

499
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,600
Velvet, wait.
Don't tell Tommy, OK?

500
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,080
OK, but get him
out of here now.

501
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,680
- Come on. Hurry up.
- I'm coming.

502
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,520
I thought you could fly.

503
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,400
I can.

504
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,360
I don't believe it.

505
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,720
I'm proud of you, kid.
You did pretty good.

506
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,640
- Where did you get that?
- What?

507
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,600
Oh, I made it in art class
a while back.

508
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,520
Why, you like it?

509
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,800
Oh, yeah?

510
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,480
Here. It's yours.

511
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,640
Looks pretty on you.

512
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,280
Thanks. I like it.

513
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,360
There's something
I've got to show you.

514
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,720
I've got to show you
the new graphics...

515
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,880
I designed for
my new skateboard...

516
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,520
and, Chrissy, when I
get pro sponsorship...

517
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,040
I'm going to have
the hottest model.

518
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,560
- Just wait till you see it.
- What's the design look like?

519
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,280
- OK. There's this web, right?
- Yeah.

520
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,520
And there's
this tarantula on it.

521
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,360
Well, there's this girl
on the tarantula...

522
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,680
with the spider on...

523
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,920
- What's wrong?
- Look.

524
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,480
Come on. Let's go.

525
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,720
We're not leaving
because of those guys.

526
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,840
Come on. Let's just go.

527
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,000
Chrissy, what's
the big deal with...

528
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,440
You don't understand.
If my brother finds out...

529
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,800
I'm with you tonight,
he'll kill me.

530
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,880
Chrissy, he's not
going to kill you.

531
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,840
Come on. I'll explain outside.
Let's just go.

532
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,800
Come on.

533
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,000
We'll go. OK.
You want to go, we'll go.

534
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,440
Money. Got to pay
the money, then we'll go.

535
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,760
It's around here somewhere.
Here it is.

536
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,200
Still a little rough,
but what do you think?

537
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,600
I don't know.
It seems a little aggressive...

538
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,560
don't you think?

539
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,760
Yeah, aggressive, and that's
what sells skateboards.

540
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,800
You'd like to be held like that?

541
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,800
Oh, yeah.

542
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,400
- You would?
- Yeah, I'd love it.

543
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,320
You'd like to be
grabbed like that?

544
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,840
You'd like to be held
like that, huh?

545
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,240
I'll call you this week.

546
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,520
No. Tomorrow.

547
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,560
Hey, look. Look, man. Webster.

548
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,920
Come on.

549
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,480
There he is! Get him!

550
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,720
Come on! Don't let him get away.

551
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,880
Oh, shit.

552
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,840
Go!

553
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,240
Come on!
Run him over to the side!

554
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,320
Good job, man.

555
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,400
Hurry up!

556
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,280
Just hang on.

557
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,920
Come on!

558
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,240
Follow that bus. Go!
Move this rice burner! Go!

559
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,640
Will you let me in the door?
Hey, driver!

560
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,920
Driver, hey, open the door!

561
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,320
Seventy-five cents.

562
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,520
Where is he?

563
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,000
Come on.

564
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,440
Hey, I said seventy-five cents.

565
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,720
- What happened to him?
- I guess he got away.

566
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,520
I know where their ramp is.

567
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,280
Come on! Yeah!

568
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,320
Look at that thing!
Whoa! Come on!

569
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,280
Look at it burn!

570
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,920
Come on. Let's go.

571
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,960
Daggers!
I'm going to get Monk.

572
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,080
I'm OK.

573
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,600
Hey, I want to see
Monk out here...

574
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,280
and I want to see him right now!

575
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,440
Come on out here, Monk!

576
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,600
Stay back, Radley. This is mine.

577
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,920
- Hey! Good morning!
- Yeah, I want to see Monk.

578
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,720
Hey, if it isn't
the Ramp Locals.

579
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,920
Hey, Monk, you got
some guests out here.

580
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,960
What's the commotion?

581
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,960
Oh, it's the Ramp Locals.

582
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,960
It's Monk the punk!

583
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,920
Hey, why don't you
come off the porch, man?

584
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,600
- How's the ramp, you guys?
- Yeah. Come down here!

585
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,480
Check this guy out.

586
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,560
Kick his ass, Monk.

587
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,560
This is gonna be funny.
Watch this.

588
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,000
Hey, man, I want
money for my ramp!

589
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,760
Money? How much?

590
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,960
This enough?

591
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,240
Hey, man.

592
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,440
Come on, Monk, kick his butt.

593
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,840
Oh, man.

594
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,800
Look out. Hey!

595
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,440
All right!

596
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,880
Ah, he's trying to...

597
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,680
he's trying to get up.
Come on!

598
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,880
You liked that, didn't you?
Yes, you did.

599
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,000
You're not coming
around here no more, are you?

600
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,720
Coming around here again?
No. No, you're not.

601
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,440
Your fight's with me, Hook.

602
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,120
Come on!

603
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,280
Get out of the way.

604
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,920
- Let's go.
- Tommy, stop it.

605
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,560
Come on! All right.
All right. Hey!

606
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,840
It's just a game,
right, Valley Boy?

607
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,520
You like games,
right, Valley Boy?

608
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,520
He loves games.

609
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,320
Tonight, meet me at
Bronson Canyon Halfpipe.

610
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,520
9:00. Joust.

611
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,520
Be there.

612
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,840
- No, YOU be there!
- You shut up, you little punk.

613
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,520
- Take your friend out of here.
- Big bad Dagger.

614
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,160
Go back to the Valley, man.

615
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,640
How's your lip feel, buddy?

616
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,840
Come on.
My cereal's getting wet.

617
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,960
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

618
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,960
Don't, Tommy!

619
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,080
Damn!

620
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,440
Get your hands off me.

621
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,440
Corey, whatever this fight
thing is about tonight...

622
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,400
you can't do it.

623
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,320
You think it's a little late
for that now, Chrissy?

624
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,840
Why? Corey, you have nothing
to prove to them.

625
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,120
If you do it...

626
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,320
you're not gonna be any better
than Tommy and his friends.

627
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,520
Chrissy, I'm going, OK?

628
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,840
But the downhill
is only three days away.

629
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,680
Corey, if you get hurt, just
forget about pro sponsorship.

630
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,560
Did you ever think your brother
might get hurt?

631
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,160
Think about it.

632
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,440
I don't want either one of you
getting hurt, Corey.

633
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,160
Corey, please don't go.
Please don't do it.

634
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,840
- Think fast, bro.
- I got it.

635
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,360
- I'm gonna cream that mother.
- I know, man.

636
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,280
Tonight we're gonna joust.
Tonight, man.

637
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,200
- Those boys are out.
- I'm psyched!

638
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,280
Tommy, can I talk to you?

639
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,160
Tonight, man!

640
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,600
Tommy. Tommy,
what is this joust?

641
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,360
- Not now, OK, Chrissy?
- Yes, now!

642
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,120
What are you gonna do to him?

643
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,200
I told you before
to stay out of this.

644
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,640
I could have creamed
that mother out there...

645
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,240
but I'm giving him
a fair chance.

646
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,040
Let's go, man.

647
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,960
Velvet.

648
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,240
Velvet, what is this jousting?

649
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,360
What are they
gonna do to him?

650
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,680
The joust is just a game...

651
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,560
the boys are gonna
play tonight, Chrissy.

652
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,520
Don't worry.

653
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,480
Velvet, it's not a game.
I know it's not.

654
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,920
Are they gonna hurt him?
Is Corey gonna get hurt?

655
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,320
Hey! That's your brother, OK?

656
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,280
And this guy comes over here...

657
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,200
and he tries to start a fight
with your brother.

658
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,120
You'd better learn
who you're with, Chrissy.

659
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,280
I mean, are you with us,
or are you against us?

660
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,040
You figure that out.

661
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,040
Come on, Corey.

662
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,480
Skate!

663
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,800
Let's go!

664
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,280
- Come on, wake up. It's a bust!
- Hey, he ain't moving, Radley.

665
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,480
Look out! Get up, bud.

666
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,960
- Come on!
- My arm!

667
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,160
His arm... it's broke, man.

668
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,120
Hi.

669
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,600
I brought you a new friend.

670
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,440
I think I've had enough new
friends for a while, Chrissy.

671
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,040
You know?

672
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,040
Corey, I'm really sorry
about what happened last night.

673
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,600
Chrissy, don't
worry about it, OK?

674
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,520
I don't want
to talk about it.

675
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,920
I feel that I should
be alone for a while, you know?

676
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,960
Maybe I'll go back home.
I don't know.

677
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,320
Yeah. I kind of
know how you feel.

678
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,520
I've been thinking maybe
I should go home, too.

679
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,920
By "home," Corey, I mean "home"
as in Indiana home...

680
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,080
and never coming back.

681
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,720
Yeah? Well...

682
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,360
No way you can do
the downhill on Saturday?

683
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,400
Chrissy, look at my arm.
It's broken.

684
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,720
How do you expect me
to do a downhill with this, huh?

685
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,560
Why can't you just
use your good arm?

686
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,440
Jeez. l... I could.

687
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,600
Yeah, I could, and you want to
know what would happen?

688
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,600
That is what would happen.
That is me.

689
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,640
You're the one
who wanted to do the joust...

690
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,560
in the first place, Corey.

691
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,960
And you're the one who wasn't
there after I got hurt.

692
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,880
Monk pulled me away.
I tried to get to you.

693
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,680
Sure, Chrissy. Sure.

694
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,960
Wait a minute.

695
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,760
You didn't have
to fight him, you know.

696
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,160
You screwed up.

697
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,920
But you had to go up
against my brother...

698
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,320
didn't you, Corey?

699
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,840
Don't blame me
for your broken arm.

700
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,960
You did that to yourself. Later.

701
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,640
Come on!

702
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,440
Hey, Chrissy,
you just missed my show.

703
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,280
I didn't know it ever stopped.

704
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,320
Hey. What happened?

705
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,320
Velvet, if you could take me
to the bus station...

706
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,560
in the morning,
I'd really appreciate it.

707
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,680
Where do you think you're going?

708
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,840
Home.

709
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,800
You're not going anywhere.
You're staying right here.

710
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,120
Tommy, I'm going.
That's what you wanted, right?

711
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,680
- It was just a game.
- Yeah, just a game.

712
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,600
My friend's lying
with a broken arm right now.

713
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,040
He's lost everything
he's worked for...

714
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,080
just so you could have fun
playing your game.

715
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,400
What's the matter with you?
Can't you take a joke?

716
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,480
I can't take you.

717
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,520
What do you want me to do?
Kid sisters, huh?

718
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,320
I don't need any help, OK?

719
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,200
This damn lock.

720
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,360
Hey, I've got
an elastic cord in my trunk...

721
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,240
that'll keep that thing shut.

722
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,680
You can have it.

723
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,000
Are you OK?

724
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,520
I just shouldn't
have come here.

725
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,080
I mean, anytime
I talk to somebody...

726
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,520
it seems like it ends up
in an argument.

727
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,880
Your brother doesn't
mean to hurt you.

728
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,760
Doesn't matter. He's been
that way since we were kids.

729
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,000
Hey, you sure you
don't want to stay?

730
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,560
Come on, come to
the downhill with us.

731
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,760
Your friend Corey
will probably be there.

732
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,280
Don't you want
to see him again?

733
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,520
I do...

734
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,320
but he doesn't
want to see me.

735
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,960
I just want to go home
as soon as possible.

736
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,160
You understand, don't you?

737
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,520
Yeah.

738
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,200
Thanks, Velvet.

739
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,040
- Hi.
- I need to talk to Chrissy.

740
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,360
- You're Corey, right?
- Yeah.

741
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,360
God, Corey, that's too bad.
You just missed her.

742
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,880
What do you mean,
I just missed her?

743
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,800
I just took her
to the bus station.

744
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,960
She's on her way
back to Indiana.

745
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,400
You know, Corey, she really
liked you a lot.

746
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,560
What did you do to her?

747
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,280
She came back here
crying hysterically...

748
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,840
saying you were
screaming at her.

749
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,320
Listen. Do you have
her number back in Indiana?

750
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,800
- Because I got to call her.
- I haven't got it.

751
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,080
Good-bye, Corey.

752
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,240
- Hey, forget about her.
- She went back to Indiana.

753
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,800
- Oh, boo-hoo.
- So forget it.

754
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,880
Yeah. You got us, Corey.

755
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,440
Thanks, Boze.
Thanks a lot.

756
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,480
Yeah, man.
She... caused this.

757
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,840
Get it? You're the king, bud.

758
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,320
Just... man, just forget her.

759
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,120
She ruined it for everybody.

760
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,120
You were supposed
to come down here.

761
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,960
We were gonna rule L.A.
Now you can't even c...

762
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,280
Hey. Stevie.

763
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,640
Hey, you'll get him
next season, Corey.

764
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,280
No way, man.
I'll get him now.

765
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,560
You're gonna do
the L.A. Massacre, bud?

766
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,320
That's right, the Massacre.
I'm gonna win this race, guys.

767
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,800
Then I'm gonna get you money
for a new ramp, you know?

768
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,760
Well, all right.

769
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,320
All right, Corey.
All right.

770
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,760
Tommy, why isn't Velvet
taking me to the bus station?

771
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,400
Because I'm your brother,
so I'm taking you.

772
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,920
What?

773
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,920
I hope you understand that, uh,
I was only looking out for you.

774
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,960
Yeah?

775
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,080
You sure have a funny way
of showing it.

776
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,680
Maybe I don't show it
sometimes, or, uh...

777
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,760
I don't know how to show it.

778
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,640
What?

779
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,840
Sometimes I get
a little crazy...

780
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,440
when guys come around
and hassle you...

781
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,240
but it's only because
I care for you.

782
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,240
I mean, you're my kid sister.

783
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,000
I understand
how you feel...

784
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,960
but you have to realize I don't
need a bodyguard anymore.

785
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,000
I'm not a little girl.

786
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,080
Damn!

787
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:46,000
...bus to Chicago
departing in five minutes.

788
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,880
Connections in Fort Wayne
and Indianapolis.

789
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,600
All passengers please board now.

790
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,240
T.A., give me
a hand with this, will you?

791
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,840
Sure. You're gonna scare
the hell out of those guys.

792
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,400
Daggers are gonna
rule the L.A. Massacre.

793
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,600
The legend lives. Yeah.

794
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,280
$1,000 to the winner, boys.

795
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,040
- We're covered for the summer.
- That's right.

796
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,080
Daggers!

797
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,360
I don't know where Webster's at.

798
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,760
Do you think
maybe he didn't show up?

799
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,720
He'll be here.

800
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,920
If I know Webster,
he will be here.

801
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,680
Maybe Corey went home.

802
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,440
Hey, Boze, he'll show up, OK?

803
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,880
Yeah, buddy.

804
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,400
He's raw. You know he'll show.
Be a happy camper.

805
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,560
Yeah, exactly.

806
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,680
It's our friends.

807
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,320
Great. Hand me that shirt.

808
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,240
Well. Where's your little hero
today, boys?

809
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,840
He'll be here.

810
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,600
- Soon enough to kick your ass.
- Don't count on it.

811
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,160
The L.A. Massacre will begin
in five minutes.

812
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,640
All racers, please report
to the start immediately.

813
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,120
Well, that's us.

814
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,840
Meet you at the top,
nickel necks.

815
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,120
See you at the bottom, man.

816
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,000
Come on, man. Let's win.

817
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,800
Hey, we'd better go
to the finish line.

818
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,760
Get our place.

819
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,680
Yeah, look, I'm gonna stay here.
You guys go on.

820
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,320
- I got to strap up.
- Yeah. Corey will show, buddy.

821
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,640
You go out there and kick ass.
Good luck.

822
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,960
All right, Radley.

823
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,120
- Good luck, partner.
- Thanks, Boze.

824
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,320
Hey, there's Corey.

825
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,200
About time, Webster!

826
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:09,160
- I knew he'd show.
- Mr. Reliable.

827
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,760
Well, holy shit, Webster.

828
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,280
I thought you
weren't gonna make it.

829
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,240
I still may not,
but I'm gonna get Hook.

830
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,200
- You ready?
- Let's get out.

831
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,440
We got a race.

832
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,640
Take it to them.

833
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,600
Boy, I hope they waste Hook.

834
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,520
Yeah, well, I hope the mountain
doesn't waste them.

835
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,200
Welcome, race fans.
This is Kenny Taylor...

836
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,440
high above our 20-mile course
in our official helicopter...

837
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,160
bringing you race coverage...

838
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,280
of the longest downhill
skateboarding race...

839
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,520
in the world, the L.A. Massacre.

840
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,120
Our competitors are
at the top of Tuna Canyon...

841
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,240
getting their equipment ready...

842
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,000
for the steepest and gnarliest
course on the circuit.

843
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,680
I'm guessing over 100 entries
in this winner-take-all event.

844
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,120
For those of you
new to downhilling...

845
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,760
in a word, it's dangerous.

846
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,000
These skaters will be
hitting speeds...

847
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,160
of over sixty miles per hour
on this windy, twisty road.

848
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,800
Right now, they're in
the pit area, getting ready.

849
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,080
All right. Tighten it down.

850
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,440
That's good.

851
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,320
I'm linked up
with a walkie-talkie...

852
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,760
to our race officials.

853
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,320
I understand that they have
just given the first call...

854
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,280
for our racers to report
to the starting line.

855
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,680
So it won't be long now.

856
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,720
From where I am...

857
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,200
overlooking this long river
of empty roadway...

858
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,200
it's kind of serene.

859
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,560
I can see traffic
starting to back up...

860
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,960
along Pacific Coast Highway
at the finish line.

861
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,320
Our course is
completely clear...

862
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,360
and ready for head-to-head
racing.

863
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,040
Skaters come from all parts
of the country...

864
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,600
Colorado, Washington state...

865
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,800
northern California...

866
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,320
and although there are
some teams...

867
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,760
it's pretty much
every man for himself.

868
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,840
Competitors are lining up now
on the starting line...

869
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,960
and we're just moments away...

870
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,960
from the official start
of the L.A. Massacre.

871
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,120
Come on, man, you can do it.

872
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,880
Hey, Webster.

873
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,360
Racers are set.

874
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,080
And they're off!

875
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,680
All right. I'm coming after you.

876
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,840
Hey, get out of the way!

877
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,720
Coming through!

878
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,080
Come on!

879
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,760
Hey, come on, man.

880
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,480
Look out! Look out!

881
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,480
On the right.

882
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,480
- Come in!
- On your left.

883
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,760
Go! Go! Go!

884
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,400
- Come on, man.
- Come on!

885
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,640
They're coming for you.

886
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,040
And it's Webster all along...

887
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,760
our new champion
of the L.A. Massacre.

888
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:10,600
Unreal! Our prize money, bud...
one thousand frogskins!

889
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,200
Yeah, right, man,
we got our ramp back.

890
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,320
Yeah! We smashed those Daggers!
The Ramp Locals rule!

891
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,760
We did it!

892
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:25,400
- Hey, Corey, congratulations.
- Thanks a lot, Mr. Flood.

893
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,480
Hey, welcome
to Smash Skates, kid.

894
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,400
I made it! I did it!

895
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,800
I don't believe it.
How did you get back?

896
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,600
- Don't ask.
- Oh, my God.

897
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,160
Hey, Webster.

898
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,160
Man, that was insane.

899
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,800
Chrissy, I'm really glad
to see you're back.

900
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,840
Your boyfriend here
is a lunatic.

901
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,360
Good race.

902
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,360
All right.
