You just never know.

30
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:53,272
One time,

31
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,985
the company I work for transferred me
to an island in the Pacific.

32
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:59,325
Fantastic place.

33
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:01,396
I invited my girl to visit me.

34
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:04,352
I sent her a postcard
every day

35
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,000
with a single word
on each card.

36
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,390
I wrote...

37
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:10,647
"Found a virgin paradise...

38
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,147
"It's yours...
Matthew."

39
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,812
Naturally, they were delivered
in the wrong order.

40
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,752
The message she got was...

41
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:18,899
"Found a virgin.

42
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,885
"It's paradise.
Yours, Matthew."

43
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:23,899
I never heard from her again.

44
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,039
Vacations are full of surprises,

45
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:27,664
to say nothing of virgins,

46
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,327
which brings me to last year.

47
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,811
It had been a really mixed-up time.

48
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,191
Just when I got to wear
a smaller retainer,

49
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,585
my parents filed for divorce.

50
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:39,427
Kinda took the fun out of smiling.

51
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:42,308
I'd been working in Brazil
out of Sao Paulo,

52
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:44,102
the New York of Brazil.

53
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,376
Sao Paulo is where
all the work gets done.

54
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:48,789
Where all the fun gets done
is in Rio.

55
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:50,742
Which is where my wife,
Karen, and I

56
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,169
decided to spend
our last vacation.

57
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,509
Somehow, I'd never made it there.

58
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,462
By all accounts,
it's the most exciting,

59
00:02:57,502 --> 00:02:59,829
the most sensuous city in the world.

60
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:01,719
I didn't know
if this was actually true,

61
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:03,664
but after 20 years of marriage,

62
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:05,370
any fantasy helps.

63
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:07,415
Victor was coming along,
of course.

64
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:09,463
That's my friend,
Victor Lyons.

65
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,929
He was going through
a bad patch at the time.

66
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:14,836
This divorce is going to kill me.

67
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,723
Phone calls, letters.

68
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,716
Look at this.
From her lawyers.

69
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:19,930
Every day something.

70
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,966
If I don't get a letter,
I get a telegram.

71
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:24,966
We're in more contact apart
than we ever were together.

72
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:26,052
Who knows?

73
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,369
Maybe, the divorce
will save the marriage.

74
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,477
Bite your tongue.

75
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:32,328
Just one day in Rio,
you'll forget all about it.

76
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,615
- I promise you.
- Tell you the truth,

77
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,539
if it wasn't for Jennifer,
I wouldn't even go.

78
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,379
I don't have to leave town
to be miserable.

79
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,985
It's much cheaper
doing it at home.

80
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,221
When does she get in?

81
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:42,277
She's on a 3:00 flight.

82
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,326
Imagine what all this
is doing to the kid.

83
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:47,376
She'll be all right.
Kids are survivors.

84
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:50,070
Pays to survive, huh?

85
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:51,203
Half.

86
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,790
That's all she wants.
Half of everything I got.

87
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,726
Wish I had herpes.

88
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,519
♪ I say to myself
she likes 'em ♪

89
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:02,446

93
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:14,145
- Jennifer!
- Hi.

94
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:17,104
Let me look at you.
You-you're gorgeous.

95
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,650
- So are you.
- Yeah.

96
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:21,999
Well, what happened?
You... You're almost a woman.

97
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:25,279
I'm strong, too, Daddy.
I won't break.

98
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,326
Oh, yeah.
Right. Sure.

99
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,288
Look, let me take your things.

100
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:30,528
- Did they feed you?
- Uh-huh.

101
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,602
You must be beat.

102
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:33,588
Give...
Give me your purse

103
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:34,781
This is some radio.

104
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,761
You can get a hernia
from rock and roll.

105
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,830
Poor Daddy.

106
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:40,890
I wanted to tell him
he didn't have to feel so guilty.

107
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:43,750
But, I just couldn't take
that happiness away from him.

108
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:46,844
My folks were married
almost 50 years.

109
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:48,757
Never said a harsh word.

110
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,077
Never said a kind word.

111
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:52,224
They just didn't speak
is what it was.

112
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,445
And I swore it would be
different for Karen and me.

113
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:58,645
But, something was happening
to our marriage.

114
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,702
Nothing earth-shattering.

115
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:04,331
Just small signs
that a husband can detect.

116
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:08,737
Karen...

117
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,271
Karen, what's wrong?

118
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:15,505
Nothing is wrong.

119
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:17,901
Read your book.

120
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:20,068
But you're crying.

121
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:23,153
I'll try to do it softly.

122
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:26,926
Is it something I did?

123
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,287
It's nothing you did.

124
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:34,094
You would have to do something
for it to be something you did.

125
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:40,239
Hold it, hold it.

126
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,049
Do you have room for these, mom?

127
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,302
Put them in dad's.

128
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:45,378
Wait a minute.
You've got more room than I.

129
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:46,674
Don't be such a baby.

130
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,200
Nicole is my daughter.

131
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,307
She also acts as
a sort of branch wife.

132
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:51,459
This bag's a mess.

133
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:52,559
Thank you,
darling.

134
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:54,559
Would you like me
to teach you how?

135
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,865
Jennifer!

136
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,297
- Can I put these in one of yours?
- Better not.

137
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:02,883
No problem.
They're perfectly flat.

138
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:03,937
Then put them in yours.

139
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,013
I can't.
Nicky's gear is in there.

140
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,913
Matthew, if you want to use them,
don't put them in here.

141
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,917
You mean,
if I put these in your bag,

142
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,668
you won't let me
use them in Rio?

143
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:13,770
No, Matthew.

144
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,305
I mean, you won't get
to use them,

145
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,652
because you and i
are not going to Rio.

146
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:18,938
What do you mean?

147
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,465
Exactly what I said.

148
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,972
But we're packing
for Rio.

149
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:25,639
You're packing for Rio.
I'm packing for Bahia.

150
00:06:26,188 --> 00:06:27,189
What?

151
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:28,975
How we doing?

152
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:30,052
Jennifer.

153
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:31,692
- Hello.
- Aunt Karen.

154
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,496
Aw, you look
marvelous.

155
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,401
How's school?
How's Connecticut?

156
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:36,824
Nice.
Thanks.

157
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,288
Hi, Uncle Matthew.

158
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,435
Hi.

159
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:42,587
You want some help?
I got 2 taxis downstairs.

160
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,969
Well, I-I-I'll be right with you.

161
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,042
Everything ok?

162
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:46,629
Yeah. Just-just give us
a few minutes.

163
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:49,958
Help Nicky take her bags downstairs.

164
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:54,429
What do you mean, Bahia?

165
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:56,689
Club Med.
For a month.

166
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:58,169
When did you decide all this?

167
00:06:58,202 --> 00:06:59,482
Weeks ago.

168
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:00,606
And you didn't tell me?

169
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,106
I didn't want to upset you.

170
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,722
Oh, not until
just the right moment, eh?

171
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:05,337
I mean, when you're
gonna upset someone,

172
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:06,838
you're gonna do
a proper job of it, right?

173
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:08,438
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

174
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,892
W-What do you expect?
We're supposed to be going on vacation.

175
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:13,387
We are going on vacation.
Just 2 different ones. That's all.

176
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:14,635
But why?

177
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,406
You haven't a clue?

178
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:18,212
Why, am I boring
when we're together?

179
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:19,519
Close.

180
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,135
I'm boring
when we're together.

181
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,629
- Who said?
- You.

182
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,902
- Never.
- Haven't you said

183
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:25,825
that there were time
you'd rather be without me?

184
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,532
Ah, that's only
when I'm with you.

185
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,212
Most of the time,
we're too together.

186
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:30,385
Sometimes we're so us,

187
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,232
I forget what it's like
just to be me.

188
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:35,543
But when we're apart,
I-I miss you terribly.

189
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:37,770
Karen...

190
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,876
The truth.

191

Is there someone in your life?

192
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,633
There's no one in my life.

193
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,853
No one.

194
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:51,091
Well, I thought I was.

195
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:52,811
Barely, Matthew.

196
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:55,370
Just a little bit more
than I'm in yours.

197
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:57,304
Look, I'm-I'm sorry.

198
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:58,737
I-I know I was wrong.

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,817
About what?

200
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:01,617
About whatever you think
I was wrong about.

201
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,910
I admit it.

202
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,733
I didn't say you'd done
anything wrong.

203
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:06,037
All right.
Then I deny it.

204
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:07,160
Whatever works here.

205
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:08,610

Victor's waiting.

206
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:10,207

207
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:11,752
Hola!

208
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:13,712
Hey, guys,
we got a plane to catch.

209

She's not going.

210
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:16,868
What do you mean
you're not going?

211
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:18,248
What happened?

212
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:20,261
What, did you have a fight?
What?

213
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,148
I don't have to answer
to you too, Victor.

214
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,883
I don't get it.
Who packs not to leave?

215
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,600
She's going to Bahia.

216
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:28,207
But, we're going to Rio.
Didn't we say Rio?

217
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,433
Victor, this is
between me and Matthew.

218
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,619
- We did say Rio, didn't we?
- We did.

219
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,092
Then what the hell is in Bahia?

220
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,883
Not me.
That's the big attraction.

221
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,143
That's not fair.

222
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,536
What's going on?

223
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:40,572
Matthew will explain it all,
I'm sure.

224
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:41,729
What do I tell Nicky?

225
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,904
I'll talk to Nicky.

226
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:47,760
She's serious.

227
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,024
We're not going
until I change her mind.

228
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:53,252
The flight without her
was awful.

229
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:55,579
She was all
I could think about.

230
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,572
I was up to my ears
in my marriage.

231
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:59,965
Victor was up to my ears
in his divorce.

232
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:01,452
How you doing?

233
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:02,640
It's the lawyers.

234
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:04,525
They think I cheated on them.

235
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,439
They feed on misery.

236

Show me 2 people breaking up,
and I'll show you

At all?

357
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,750
Yes, dear,
I miss you at all.

358
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:24,005
How much is that?

359
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,852
How's Nicky?
Jennifer?

360
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:28,442
They're fine.

361
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:29,767
What are you doing there?

362
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,000
Nothing.

363
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:32,547
It's lovely.

364
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,160
Can you take a month of that?

365
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,467
It'll give me a good chance to think.

366
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:39,053
Now, what's all this thinking
that you have to do?

367
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,203
I don't want to shock you, Matthew;
but, I have been thinking, for years.

368
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:44,896
We miss you here.

369
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,280
The girls.
Victor, too.

370
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:49,710
Tell Victor to play with
his settlement papers.

371
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:51,910
I miss you, Karen.

372
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,657
A lot more than "at all."

373
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:57,724
Take care, Matthew.

374
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,749
You, too.

375
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:03,949
Matthew!

376
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,196
This is our neighbor.

377
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,279
Uh, Eduardo Marques.

378
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:08,499
Marques.

379
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:10,659
Marques.
This is Matthew Hollish.

380
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:11,732
Hollis.

381
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:14,720
Eduardo owns a restaurant in the town.
And I said we'll try it.

382
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,133
You ok?

383
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:18,500
Yeah.
I just spoke to Karen.

384
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:20,706
Everything
, uh, all right?

385
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,580
I guess so.
She seems fine.

386
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:24,488
What the hell's
she doing there, anyway?

387
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:26,188
- Thinking.
- Thinking?

388
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:27,275
Thinking.

389
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:30,273
That's exactly
how I lost my wife.

390
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:33,004
Uh, no offense.

391
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,281
Thinking about what?

392
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,689
What's there to think about?

393
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,880
Listen, we came here
for a good time.

394
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,073
Let's have a good time.

395
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:40,378
I'm gonna forget
about your wife.

396
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:41,880
I'm gonna forget
about my wife.

397
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,143
And you can forget
about my wife, if you like.

398
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:47,064
What do you say, Matthew?

399
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:48,183
I'll try.

400
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:49,489
What do you mean,
you'll try?

401
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:52,163
This is all your idea.
This is Rio, remember?

402
00:18:30,212 --> 00:18:33,299
I don't know if
I can take a week of this.

403
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:35,459
Matthew!

404
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:36,606
Victor!

405
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,096
Hello, Peter.
Helaine.

406
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,603
What a nice surprise.

407
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:40,734
Where are you staying?

408
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,121
We're at the Verde Oro.

409
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,061
The Oro Verde.

410
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:45,398
We've got a house.

411
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:47,038
Oh!
Lovely.

412
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:48,232
We'll give you
a call.

413
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,352
- Do.
- Yes.

414
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:53,499
I've always had
a feeling about her.

415
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:55,629
You've got a feeling
about everybody.

416
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:57,476
I didn't know
they were back together.

417
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,556
He had a thing
with his secretary.

418
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:02,279
Looks like he brought
his thing back home.

419
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,159
They smiled.

420
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:30,724
Maybe, we should talk to them.

421
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:33,065
We can't.
They're practically naked.

422
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,311
Try to picture them
with clothes on.

423
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:44,059
I hope I don't step on anything.

424
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,004
I've always had a problem
handling nudity.

425
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:51,810
I-I like it, mind you.

426
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,354
But, it is troubling.

427
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,750
Anybody's.
Even my own.

428
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:58,200
Sometimes,
when I'm getting undressed,

429
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:00,629
I almost wish
I could leave the room.

430
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:02,217
You know what I mean?

431
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,800
This place can make you crazy.

432
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,624
I think the monkey likes you.

433
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:16,871
Hey, those are the girls.

434
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:18,445
Hi!

435
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:20,245
Hi!

436
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:27,126
Isn't it a fabulous day?

437
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,406
Fabulous.

438
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:30,733
Aren't you a little chilly, Jennifer?

439
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:31,913
Chilly?

440
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:32,959
I am.

441
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,898
I-I-I feel a little chill.

442
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:36,144
No, really.

443
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,584
Why don't we all get dressed
and go in for a swim?

444
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,809
You're embarrassed.

445
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:41,429
No, I'm not embarrassed.

446
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:44,836
Oh, Daddy.
Help me, Nicky.

447
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:47,153
Come on, come on.
Hey! Ah, come on.

448
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,207
All right.
Come on.

449
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:49,872
Stop pushing.
Come on.

450
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,899
Hey, what are you looking at?
Hey!

451
00:20:51,973 --> 00:20:53,223
Come on.
Hey, that's cold.

452
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,369
Come on.
Stop. Whoa!

453
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:56,903
Aah!

454
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:59,409
Come on in, Uncle Matthew!

455
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:01,276
Poor Uncle Matthew.

456
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:03,938
I don't know why
some people can get older

457
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:05,932
without getting old.

458
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:09,590
- You didn't dry your hair.
- It'll dry.

459
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:10,923
Sure, it will.
But if you dry it,

460
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,150
you won't have
to wait for it to dry.

461
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:13,203
Where's your towel?

462
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:15,511
- I don't need it, Daddy.
- You need a cold, right?

463
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:17,100
- Ow!
- Don't "ow" me.

464
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:20,851
You catch a cold, your mother's lawyers
will turn it into double pneumonia.

Come on, Nicky!

477
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,508
What about dinner?

478
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:05,801
They'll have lots of food.

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,301
Remember, 1:00 O'Clock!

480
00:22:07,318 --> 00:22:08,318
2:00 the latest!

481
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:09,583
They'll be all right.

482
00:22:09,616 --> 00:22:10,973
They're good girls.

483
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,080
Yeah.

484
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:14,615
Let's go find some bad ones.

485
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:47,380
They're alone.

486
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,178
There's probably a reason.

487
00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:53,304
They keep looking over at me.

488
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:55,237
Maybe, they're lawyers.

489
00:22:55,356 --> 00:22:56,630
My luck...

490
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,211
Waiter.

491
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:00,076
What are you doing?

492
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:02,103
I'm gonna send them a drink.

493
00:23:03,736 --> 00:23:05,643
Think they'll be easier
to get than the waiter.

494
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:08,539
Uh, Victor, let's not
start something here.

495
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:09,852
A drink is fine.

496
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:11,852
But after that,
you're on your own.

497
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,986
I didn't come to Rio to cheat.

498
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,953
Don't ever use that word.

499
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:17,504
Is tasting life,

500
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:19,137
creating a little magic...

501
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:21,051
Is that
cheating?

502
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:23,978
We're a long time dead.

503
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:26,636
And being unfaithful
will get me that way fast.

504
00:23:26,678 --> 00:23:29,004
You're faithful out of fear,
is that it?

505
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,851
Maybe out of fear,
maybe out of habit.

506
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:34,193
But it's been so long,
I'm definitely out of practice.

507
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:38,721
Look at that.

508
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:40,401
The one with the cigar?

509
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:41,661
You like that?

510
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,817
That lady
is my kinda guy.

511
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:48,383
Don't wait up.

512
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,647
Reckless, impulsive, unthinking...

513
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,527
Not Victor.
Me...

514
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:02,114
As I was about to find out.

515
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:20,975
I'm on the groom's side.

516
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,686
Hi, Uncle Matthew!

517
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:53,546
Hi!

518
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:55,651
Nicky!

519
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,839
Where's Daddy?

520
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:02,460
Uh, he's...
he's not here.

521
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,413
He's, uh, making a friend.

522
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:06,581
That's my dad.
Want to dance?

523
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,335
No, thank you.
It's not my kind of music.

524
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:09,928
But listening is fine.

525
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:11,481
Come on.
The beat's wonderful.

526
00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:13,971
No, it's just that I can't
do any kind of dancing

527
00:25:13,997 --> 00:25:15,288
where you have
to use your body.

528
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,583
- I'll wait here.
- No.

529
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:18,077
You've got to see
the newlyweds.

530
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,343
Her mother's a macumba lady.

531
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:22,963
May I kiss the bride?

533
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:25,371

00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:38,077
Because her prayers are
responsible for this marriage.

537
00:26:58,057 --> 00:26:59,317
Let's go in.

538
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,264
Go in?
Are you kidding?

539
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,431
I bet that water's freezing.

540
00:27:09,592 --> 00:27:10,730
This is crazy.

541
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:13,592
Crazy's wonderful.
Crazy's the best.

542
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,056
I'm too old for crazy.
Can't we settle for silly?

543
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,396
- It's too cold!
- No, it's not.

544
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:21,736
It's not too cold,
and you're not too old.

545
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:32,334
It's... it's warmer than I thought
it was going to be.

546
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:51,523
Uh...

547
00:27:57,213 --> 00:27:59,199
Jennifer!

548
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,653
Jennifer.

549
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,519
Jennifer!

550
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,613
Jennifer...

551
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,114
Look!

552
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,081
A shell.

553
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:49,580
Make love to me.

554
00:28:50,404 --> 00:28:52,875
I'm 20 years older than you.

555
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,035
Twenty eight.

556
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:55,695
T-T...
Twenty five.

557
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:11,321
I was wrong.

558
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:13,661
You're never too old
to be crazy.

559
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:43,081
- I loved that ceremony.
- I'm so glad.

560
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,808
- I thought it was super.
- Lovely.

561
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,062
Much better than
the royal wedding.

562
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:49,876
Definitely.

563
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:52,776
I think we're having just about
the best holiday we've ever had.

564
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,869
I think I love this place.

565
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:57,082
- It's lovely.
- It's so different from Brighton.

566
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:58,381
Oh, look at these rocks.

567
00:29:58,406 --> 00:29:59,576
Talking about Brighton,

568
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:00,659
- look at these rocks.
- Oh, yes.

569
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:03,282
They're extremely craggy, aren't they?

570
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:04,648
How are your...?

571
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,456
- It is a craggy place.
- It is?

572
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:08,812
Matthew!
Is that you?

573
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:10,784
That's right.
This is me.

574
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,377
I-it's Peter
and Helaine.

575
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,222
Yes, yes. Of course.
I-I know.

576
00:30:15,286 --> 00:30:16,653
Are you all right?

577
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:18,410
Yes, I'm fine,
thank you.

578
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:20,237
How are you?

579
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:22,630
Here for the month?

580
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,788
Uh, what-what month is that?

581
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:26,022
This month.

582
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:27,720
Oh. Oh, this month.
Yes, yes.

583
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:30,406
This is the month
that I'm here for.

584
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:32,366
We were just at the ceremony.

585
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,091
Delightful,
wasn't it?

586
00:30:34,157 --> 00:30:36,400
Is that, uh,
Karen over there?

587
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,373
No.
That's not Karen.

588
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:40,575
Karen couldn't come.
She's dead.

589
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,858
Not really.

590
00:30:41,913 --> 00:30:44,123
No, no.
She's not really dead.

591
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,616
Not in the sense
that she's not alive.

592
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:48,899
Matthew,
you are all right?

593
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,925
Yeah. Yes, I'm fine.
Fine, thank you.

594
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,983
I-I just came out for a walk.

595
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,452
And-and to bury yourself
in the sand?

596
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:57,567
Yeah.
Yes, I did, didn't I?

597
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,841
Well, do give us a call if you like.

598
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,008
Yeah, we're at the,
uh, Verde Oro.

599
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,743
Oro Verde, dear.

600
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,477
Yes. Yes, of course.

601
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,197
Wherever.

602
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:09,019
God bless.

603
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,109
Jennifer, wake up.

604
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,934
Wake up, Jennifer.

605
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:22,754
You fell asleep.

606
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:24,561
You've been dreaming.

607
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:26,938
You had a very bad dream.

608
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:28,791
That we were making love.

609
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:31,365
Probably. Yes.
Probably that was it.

610
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:33,025
How would you know?

611
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:34,105
Uh...

612
00:31:34,141 --> 00:31:37,037
I... I must've had
the same dream, too.

613
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:39,237
Don't feel guilty.

614
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:41,610
I don't know what to feel.

615
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:46,776
I'm ready for another
dream if you are.

616
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,019
Mmm.

617
00:31:56,994 --> 00:31:58,494
Excellent.

618
00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:01,730
My ex-husband,
he hated the smell of cigars.

619
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:04,296
My wife couldn't stand them.

620
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:08,522
So, um...

621
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,948
How long have you and
your husband been split up?

622
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,797
12 days.

623
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:14,968
Can I tell you something?

624
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:18,336
You are my 12th lover
in 12 days.

625
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:19,789
Really?

626
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:22,142
I don't hurt your feelings?

627
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,332
Nah, I've always been
a team player.

628
00:32:30,034 --> 00:32:34,011
It is better making love to someone
when you're not married.

629
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,932
Lets you be a little kinky.

630
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,104
What is kinky?

631
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,157
I'll show you in a minute.

632
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,580

I had to do something.

642
00:33:14,838 --> 00:33:16,444
You're not sick, are you?

643
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,018
What is it, your stomach?
Did you eat something?

644
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,531
You caught a cold, didn't you?
I told you your hair was wet.

645
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:24,491
Daddy, did you have
a good time?

646
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,737
Fair.

647
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,851
You?

648
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,984
Fair.

649
00:33:28,044 --> 00:33:29,580
Well, good night, sweetheart.

650
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,627

The way we felt.

657
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,879
Nothing's perfect, though.

658
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:53,410
It'll take a month to get
all the sand out of my bellybutton.

659
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:58,189
Three.

660
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:01,996
Ready to hear about last night?

661
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:03,156
Fifty.

662
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:05,043
First of all,
her name is Isabella,

663
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:07,741
which has to be Portuguese
for "perpetual motion."

664
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,299
It was fantastic.

665
00:34:09,353 --> 00:34:10,579
Where'd you wind up?

666
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,501
Aha!

667
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:14,996
You got milk all over
your whiskers, pussycat.

668
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:17,194
Who was the lucky girl?
Where'd you meet her?

669
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:18,694
I didn't meet anybody.

670
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,257
Ok, ok.
We'll talk at breakfast.

671
00:34:20,317 --> 00:34:22,318
I want to know
all the details about her.

672
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,801
You can start at the bottom
if you like.

673
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:32,615
So did you kids have fun
at the wedding?

674
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:35,748
Oh, yeah. Us kids had fun
at the wedding.

675
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,553
Ow!

676
00:34:38,586 --> 00:34:39,639
Let me kiss it.

677
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:40,699
Are you crazy?

678
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:42,653
They're outside
having breakfast.

679
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:44,210
Kiss me.

680
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:51,565
- Jennifer, about last night.
- Kiss me first.

681
00:34:51,605 --> 00:34:54,198
- Kiss you? I ought to spank you.
- Oh, please, and bite me, too.

682
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:55,757
Now stop that.

683
00:34:56,539 --> 00:34:58,077
Did you get my sand flower?

684
00:34:58,112 --> 00:34:59,666
Oh, was that yours?
I did.

685
00:34:59,692 --> 00:35:00,965
It was lovely.
Thank you.

686
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,540
- You're lovely.
- No, I'm not.

687
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:04,260
You're a fantastic lover.

688
00:35:04,307 --> 00:35:05,340
Don't talk like that.

689
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,397
Why? Will you tell
my father on me?

690
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:09,885
There's nothing to tell.
Last night never happened.

691
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:11,875
I know.
I was there when it didn't.

692
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:15,329
No, no, I mean it.
It was just one wild moment.

693
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,360
That's all it was.
You've got to forget it.

694
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:18,908
We've both got to forget it.

695
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:20,436
I was just a one-night stand?

696
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:23,641
No, no, no, no.
You're more than that.

697
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,161
Am I?

698
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:26,607
Jennifer, don't.

699
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,234
What's the matter?

700
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:31,132
You're...
You're too next to me.

701
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:32,765
You want me to go?

702
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,265
You'd better.

703
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:36,270
One kiss, and I will.

704
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:39,878
All right.

705
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:40,985
A little one.

706
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,540
A little one.

707
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:57,440
Good morning, Daddy.

708
00:35:57,468 --> 00:35:59,969
What happened to my coffee
in bed this morning?

709
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,462
I forgot.

710
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,831
We're here one night,
and already I've lost you.

711
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:06,195
Maybe you've gained a son.

712
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:08,741
What does that mean?

713
00:36:08,828 --> 00:36:10,296
Should I know
what that means?

714
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,722
That's just Nicky.

715
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,256
"Just Nicky" what?

716
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,921
Being Nicky.

717
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:17,295
What's on your face?

718
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:21,839
Oh!
Whipped cream.

719
00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:25,345
Tell me the truth, Jennifer.

720
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:27,914
Are you having fun so far?

721
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:31,752
I want this to be the best
time we ever had together.

722
00:36:33,146 --> 00:36:34,152
I love you no matter

723
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:36,432
what rotten things
your mother says about me.

724
00:36:36,483 --> 00:36:38,484
She doesn't say anything
bad about you.

725
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:40,502
Yeah, but you can't
always believe her.

726
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:43,749
Hey, not too many grapes.
They're hard to digest.

727
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:45,302
Good morning, everyone.

728
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:46,843
Sleep well, Uncle Matthew?

729
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:48,391
Yes, I slept fine,
thank you.

730
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:51,399
Hey, another egg.

731
00:36:51,424 --> 00:36:53,734
We really struck fertility
around here.

732
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:55,887
Must be something
in the water.

733
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,987
Nicky tells me
the wedding was fun.

734
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:00,220
It seemed all right
the few minutes I was...

735
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:01,927
I was there.

736
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:03,803
You meet any nice boys?

737
00:37:03,844 --> 00:37:05,900
I wasn't there long enough.

738
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:07,550
I asked Jennifer.

739
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:08,905
Eh?

740
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:10,574
Oh, yeah.

741
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:12,917
One.
One nice boy.

742
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,827
Ah, terrific.

743
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,516
What the hell's
the matter with you?

744
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:23,667
I-I-I'm sorry.
I'm just a little jumpy.

745
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:25,701
What are you jumpy about?

746
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:27,150
I don't know.

747
00:37:27,187 --> 00:37:28,523
I didn't sleep very well.

748
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:30,136
You said you slept fine.

749
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:32,130
Then that must be it.

750
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:34,505
You started smoking again, too.

751
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:36,345
Me?
No.

752
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:50,767
I think I'll make
a fresh watercress salad.

753
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:52,367
Pick me out a couple
of nice bunches.

754
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:53,447
No droopy ones.

755
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:54,591
Right.

756
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:57,044
You sure you won't change
your mind about after dinner?

757
00:37:57,076 --> 00:37:58,306
I'm sure.

758
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:01,031
Isabella's friend's just
been separated, too.

759
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,573
You can't miss.

760
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:05,008
Victor, I am not
looking not to miss.

761
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:06,435
You know what these are?

762
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:07,684
Fruta de caja.

763
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:09,135
Supposed to be an aphrodisiac.

764
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,328
It's all in the mind.

765
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:12,492
- Want to find out?
- No, thanks.

766
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,555
You're not seeing that little lady
from last night again?

767
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:16,842
No, no, no.

768
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:18,972
And I won't be seeing
Karen for a month.

769
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,905
Just eat one and
put yourself on hold.

770
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:22,104
Hello, hello.

771
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:23,455
- Hi.
- How nice!

772
00:38:23,494 --> 00:38:25,128
You are buying
groceries together.

773
00:38:25,155 --> 00:38:27,535
You are, how you say,
the queer couple?

774
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:29,355
Odd couple.
Odd.

775
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,416
Yes. May I present
senhor Hollis,

776
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,643
senhor Lyons.

777
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:34,790
Hello.

778
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:35,916
Shopping for
the restaurant?

779
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:38,412
No.
Just a few things for myself.

780
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:40,692
Good day, my friends.

781
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:43,533
I wonder if you can freeze these.

782
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,907
I love doing this.

783
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:56,716
I haven't fixed dinner
for Jennifer in years.

784
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,803
Hmm?

785
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,626
Gonna put some meat
on her bones this trip.

786
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:02,793
I think she's too thin,
don't you?

787
00:39:02,866 --> 00:39:04,233
What?

788
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:07,218
Don't you think, uh,
Jennifer's too skinny?

789
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:09,538
She looks just fine to me.

790
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,580
You um...

791
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,094
Maybe that's why Karen backed out.

792
00:39:14,331 --> 00:39:16,887
So you and Nicky could spend
some time together.

793
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,584
I don't think so.

794
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:21,429
I don't know.

795
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:23,923
Maybe, huh?

796
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,418
I bet a son's easier.

797
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:32,740
Do you really know
what's going on with Nicky?

798
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:34,606
I mean, like, with boys.

799
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,207
Well, she did ask permission
to go on the pill.

800
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,535
Oh, yeah?
What did you say?

801
00:39:39,642 --> 00:39:41,042
We said yes.

802
00:39:41,284 --> 00:39:43,786
Think of the possible
consequences otherwise.

803
00:39:43,941 --> 00:39:45,727
Not me.

804
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,540
What?

805
00:39:48,629 --> 00:39:50,500
I said no.

806
00:39:51,735 --> 00:39:53,088
No?

807
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,681
Jennifer asked me last summer.

808
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:57,908
She asked you about the pill?

809
00:39:58,001 --> 00:39:59,148
Right.

810
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,080
And you said no?

811
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:04,212
I told her it's up to her
whether she takes it or not.

812
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:06,932
Oh, I see.

813
00:40:07,918 --> 00:40:10,697
If she does,
it's without my blessing.

814
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:13,577
All I care is that she tell me.

815
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,492
Tell you what?

816
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:18,646
Well, uh, we have a pact.

817
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:20,999
Pact?

818
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,712
What sort of pact?

819
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:25,331
Well, if she and some boy
are at that point

820
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:28,382
in their relationship where
they're gonna... you know...

821
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:30,413
She's gonna tell me first.

822
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,566
- First?
- Well, before, really.

823
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:34,886
How the hell
is she gonna do that?

824
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:37,221
She'll give me a call.

825
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,105
You're not serious?

826
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:42,988
You don't really think she's gonna
stop right in the middle of

827
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:45,141
whatever it is they're doing
and give you a call?

828
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:46,675
Not in the middle.
Before.

829
00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:49,598
But, suppose there's
no phone on the beach.

830
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:53,998
What beach?

831
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:55,439
Any-Any beach.

832
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:57,447
If-If, by chance,
it happened on a beach.

833
00:40:57,494 --> 00:40:59,314
Happens on a beach.

834
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,187
And I don't say
that it did or will.

835
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:05,533
- Hey.
- What?

836
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,687
We made a pact.

837
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:09,957
I trust her not to break it.

838
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:26,881
What's all this?

839
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:27,955
Surprised.

840
00:41:27,984 --> 00:41:29,601
Fantastic.

841
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,608
So romantic.

842
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:34,142
No, it's not.
We're just loving fathers.

843
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:35,876
I love loving fathers.

844
00:41:35,937 --> 00:41:37,376
Ah, good evening,
mademoiselle.

845
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:38,538
Dinner is served.

846
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:40,272
Oh, I don't want any.

847
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,948
It's chateaubriand.

848
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:44,008
No steak for me.
I'm a vegetarian.

849
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:45,061
Since when?

850
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,541
I am no longer a carnivore.

851
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:48,472
I don't eat anything
that's ever had parents.

852
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:50,892
We have artichokes.
They're orphans.

853
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,609
Where are you going?

854
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:54,421
Out.
I need my sweater.

855
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:56,476
- With him?
- Yes.

856
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:57,669
What's his name?

857
00:41:57,714 --> 00:41:58,889
Diego.

858
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:01,961
You're not going anywhere
till I meet him.

859
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:07,441
You, come here.

860
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:10,795
Diego,
this is my father.

861
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:13,707
- Does he speak?
- He's a drummer.

862
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,870
Can he beat out "hello"
on the table?

863
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,567
Daddy, he's an artist.

864
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:19,667
He's also
a carnivore.

865
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:22,002
Come on.

866
00:42:26,285 --> 00:42:29,672
Good.
I have you both to myself.

The 2 people who
make me feel that, uh...

Well, I must be worth something,
because if uh...

883
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:33,240
they love me,
then I, uh

884
00:43:33,283 --> 00:43:35,826
can't be as bad as someone who's...

885
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,726
the mother of one
of those 2 people thinks I am.

886
00:43:38,772 --> 00:43:40,346
Worthy or not,
I um...

887
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:42,650
I love you both.

888
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:45,143
- I gotta run.
- Wait.

889
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:46,236
I'm late already.

890
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:48,801
You-You're not gonna leave
Jennifer here alone, are you?

891
00:43:48,862 --> 00:43:50,165
Why?

892
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,372
You coming with me?

893
00:43:51,404 --> 00:43:52,432
No, no, no.

894
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:54,316
- I-I just...
- Well, then you'll baby-sit.

895
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:55,349
If she misbehaves,

896
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:58,122
I want you to put her
over your knee, ok?

897
00:43:58,491 --> 00:43:59,892
Good night, uh, sweetheart.

898
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:01,487
Good night, Daddy.
Have fun.

899
00:44:01,518 --> 00:44:03,051
Ok.
You, too.

900
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:10,793
There's nothing to smile about.

901
00:44:10,974 --> 00:44:13,757
This will give us a chance to straighten
this thing between us out

902
00:44:13,843 --> 00:44:15,650
once and for all.

903
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:18,624
Jennifer.

904
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:21,793
Are you listening to me?

905
00:44:30,255 --> 00:44:31,643
What?

906
00:44:32,638 --> 00:44:35,630
I was just remembering
the first time I kissed you.

907
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:38,993
It was at your christening.

908
00:44:39,946 --> 00:44:42,332
Your mother was powdering your bottom,

909
00:44:42,895 --> 00:44:46,091
and I said I wanted to be
the first man to kiss it.

910
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:50,485
And I leaned over,
and I did.

911
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:54,080
How dare you drive
a tiny baby wild with desire.

912
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,432
Oops!

913
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,438
They happen to use these
for birth control.

914
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,228
Which one of us wears it?

915
00:45:04,216 --> 00:45:08,721
♪ I must be doing something right ♪

916
00:45:17,874 --> 00:45:20,548
You should wear
your hair like this.

917
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,624
- What time is it?
- About 1:00.

918
00:45:23,744 --> 00:45:25,370
I like it like this.

919
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:27,390
It makes you look older.

920
00:45:27,457 --> 00:45:28,817
It's almost 3:00.

921
00:45:28,866 --> 00:45:30,542
Pretend it's 1:00.

922
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,522
We've done too much
pretending lately.

923
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:33,786
You have to go.

924
00:45:33,837 --> 00:45:35,466
Let me stay.

925
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,693
We don't have
to make love again.

926
00:45:37,808 --> 00:45:39,809
I promise not to get you excited.

927
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,779
I'll just bite
your neck a little.

928
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:42,946
Jennifer.

929
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,499
Meanie.

930
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,006
I've never spent the whole night

931
00:45:47,096 --> 00:45:49,170
Nicky must be home by now.

932
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:52,241
You always have to
worry about something.

933
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:54,599
Your father told me
about your pact.

934
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:58,199
Which pact?
My father just loves pacts.

935
00:45:58,307 --> 00:46:01,357
He said you'd tell him
that if you and a boy

936
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:02,851
ever, um...

937
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:04,406
"Ever, um?"

938
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:06,949
Do you think I'd "um"
with a boy?

939
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,711
Do you think
I'm that kind of girl?

940
00:46:10,614 --> 00:46:13,331
I just promised Daddy
to make him feel better.

941
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:15,978
I never meant
to really tell him.

942
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:19,505
You've got us both wrapped around
your little finger, haven't you?

943
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:21,292
I love you.

944
00:46:21,397 --> 00:46:24,338
I can't think of a time
when I ever didn't.

945
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,883
Jennifer, it's late.

946
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:30,071
And I love it when
your glasses steam up.

947
00:46:30,192 --> 00:46:32,146
Only when I'm with you.

948
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,208
You know what I used to
pretend when I was little?

949
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:37,568
I'm afraid to guess.

950
00:46:37,701 --> 00:46:39,575
That we were married.

951
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:40,910
You and me?

952
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,235
When I was 10.

953
00:46:42,278 --> 00:46:44,135
And I was only 90.

954
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,915
It would be lovely,
being married.

955
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,470
Jennifer?

956
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,450
Married people do not
go around getting married.

957
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:55,020
Then maybe just a honeymoon.

958
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:57,394
Off you go.

959
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:59,367
Off to bed.

960
00:47:03,027 --> 00:47:06,153
It took whatever strength I had
to send her away.

961
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:08,434
That's not altogether true.

962
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:11,548
If I really had any strength,
she never would've been there at all.

963
00:47:12,441 --> 00:47:13,831
Jennifer.

964
00:47:15,237 --> 00:47:17,991
- You all right?
- I'm fine, Daddy.

965
00:47:18,154 --> 00:47:19,647
How come you're up so late?

966
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:21,627
How come you are?

967
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:23,068
Touché.

968
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:26,521
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

969
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,768
P-u!
Cigar!

970
00:47:38,305 --> 00:47:39,811
Nicky?

971
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,826
Do you hate me?

972
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:43,953
No.

973
00:47:44,218 --> 00:47:45,476
Him.

974
00:47:50,324 --> 00:47:52,310
Does he tell you
he loves you?

975
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:54,283
No.

976
00:47:55,144 --> 00:47:57,050
You'll get used to it.

977
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:09,563
If you want a man
to love you,

978
00:48:09,645 --> 00:48:11,683
you must light many,
many candles

979
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:14,463
and give gifts
to the goddess Iamanja.

980
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,240
The goddess Iamanja?

981
00:48:16,302 --> 00:48:18,086
Throw flowers into the sea.

982
00:48:18,172 --> 00:48:19,340
White ones.

983
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,399
If they come back,

984
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:22,454
it means she has rejected them.

985
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:25,838
If not, she has listened
to your prayer.

986
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:27,585
I'll do it.

987
00:48:27,612 --> 00:48:28,637
And here...

988
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,755
Have him wear this always.

989
00:49:02,185 --> 00:49:03,492
You love me!

990
00:49:03,529 --> 00:49:04,839
The flowers didn't come back.

991
00:49:04,879 --> 00:49:07,532
You love me.
I want to tell the whole world!

992
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:10,599
I'm so happy.
The flowers didn't come back.

993
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:11,666
You love me!

994
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:14,153
You love me!
You love me!

995
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,157
Jennifer,
for God's sake.

996
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:22,491
Here.

997
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:26,608
- What's this?
- It means you're mine.

998
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:29,521
You know what love really is?

999
00:49:29,562 --> 00:49:32,515
It's like you swallowed
a great big secret.

1000
00:49:32,626 --> 00:49:34,604
A warm, wonderful secret

1001
00:49:34,687 --> 00:49:36,311
that nobody else knows about.

1002
00:49:36,395 --> 00:49:37,957
And that's how it should be.

1003
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,217
Other times, though,
it's more like a song.

1004
00:49:41,485 --> 00:49:43,651
A song you want to sing
at the top of your voice

1005
00:49:43,683 --> 00:49:45,198
for everyone to hear.

1006
00:49:45,244 --> 00:49:47,734
Uh, no, no, no.
It's more like a secret.

1007
00:49:47,773 --> 00:49:50,775
Believe me, it is better
as a secret than a song.

1008
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,327
Matthew...

1009
00:49:52,418 --> 00:49:53,948
Yes?

1010
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:56,302
I've never called you
Matthew before.

1011
00:49:56,388 --> 00:49:57,948
No "uncle".

1012
00:49:58,317 --> 00:50:00,310
Just plain Matthew.

1013
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:04,470
Do you love me, Matthew?

1014
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:05,897
I do.

1015
00:50:05,978 --> 00:50:07,294
Honestly?

1016
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:08,366
Yes.

1017
00:50:08,428 --> 00:50:10,194
Secretly but honestly.

1018
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:11,777
No more secrets.

1019
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,086
- You have to tell daddy.
- I can't!

1020
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,673
It would, it would kill him
if he didn't kill me first.

1021
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:19,979
What's killing is you can
feel one way and love another.

1022
00:50:20,122 --> 00:50:21,350
There is just no way

1023
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,236
we can bring this
out into the open.

1024
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:24,749
Who would understand?

1025
00:50:24,794 --> 00:50:26,629
I'm not sure I do.

1026
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:29,464
It's over, Jennifer.

1027
00:50:29,681 --> 00:50:31,182
It has to be.

1028
00:50:31,471 --> 00:50:33,417
I won't let it be.

1029
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:35,466
Lunch, everyone!

1030
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:41,807
It was just what I needed.

1031
00:50:41,845 --> 00:50:44,097
A one-inch god
with a 2-inch penis.

1032
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:03,843
Aahhh!

1033
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,016
Ohhh!
Ohhh!

1034
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:06,549
Are you all right?

1035
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:09,808
Somebody has put
these candles outside my...

1036
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:13,086
Jennifer,...

1037
00:51:13,452 --> 00:51:15,932
I don't know what witchcraft
brought us together,

1038
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:17,759
but it won't keep us that way.

1039
00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:19,792
Can't you give it a little time?

1040
00:51:19,835 --> 00:51:22,062
I'm lying to enough people now.

1041
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,859
I don't want you
to be one of them.

1042
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,263
It's not easy for me, either.

1043
00:51:26,936 --> 00:51:29,383
So, please, let us both
accept that it's over

1044
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:31,428

Hmm...

1058
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:18,995
Why does coffee always taste better
when somebody else makes it?

1059
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,615
Daddy...

1060
00:52:21,077 --> 00:52:22,577
That's me.

1061
00:52:22,952 --> 00:52:25,996
You always said
we could talk about anything.

1062
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:28,656
Anything and everything.

1063
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:31,982
What is it?
Is it a boy?

1064
00:52:32,678 --> 00:52:34,178
Sort of.

1065
00:52:35,244 --> 00:52:38,283
Hey, that's nothing
to cry about.

1066
00:52:39,562 --> 00:52:41,944
I'm trying not to.

1067
00:52:42,772 --> 00:52:44,304
Oh, Daddy.

1068
00:52:44,374 --> 00:52:45,917
Something happened.

1069
00:52:45,956 --> 00:52:48,512
Something happened?
With a boy?

1070
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:50,479
Sort of.

1071
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:52,412
What do you mean, "sort of"?

1072
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:55,311
Sort of a boy or
something sort of happened?

1073
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:57,704
What are you saying?

1074
00:52:57,826 --> 00:53:00,196
More than sort of.

1075
00:53:02,392 --> 00:53:05,070
- How much more?
- I slept with him.

1076
00:53:08,317 --> 00:53:10,267
You slept with someone?

1077
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:14,900
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did!

1078
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:17,604
Now you tell me?
What good does it do me now?

1079
00:53:17,646 --> 00:53:19,444
What good is it
supposed to do you?

1080
00:53:19,477 --> 00:53:21,437
Jennifer, Jennifer,
we had a pact!

1081
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:23,830
You were gonna tell me first.
At least call.

1082
00:53:23,853 --> 00:53:25,816
I know, Daddy.

1083
00:53:27,963 --> 00:53:30,116
Don't cry. I'm sorry.
Please, don't cry.

1084
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:32,403
I couldn't call you first.

1085
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,103
He took you by surprise?

1086
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:36,339
I didn't have the money.

1087
00:53:37,787 --> 00:53:40,059
You didn't have the money.

1088
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:43,796
What about collect?

1089
00:53:43,842 --> 00:53:45,776
You ever hear of
calling a person collect?

1090
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,982
We were on the beach.

1091
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:49,979
On the beach.

1092
00:53:50,169 --> 00:53:53,552
Is that where he, uh...
forced himself on you?

1093
00:53:53,905 --> 00:53:56,589
I wanted him, Daddy.

1094
00:53:58,925 --> 00:54:00,542
Where on the beach?

1095
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,056
When?

1096
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:05,154
- I want to know everything.
- The other night.

1097
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:07,836
After the wedding.

1098
00:54:08,544 --> 00:54:10,200
There was a wedding?

1099
00:54:10,732 --> 00:54:11,806
Whose wedding?

1100
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:13,848
Those people the other night.

1101
00:54:14,006 --> 00:54:16,319
Oh, those people's wedding.

1102
00:54:18,454 --> 00:54:19,879
There's something else.

1103
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:21,312
You're pregnant.

1104
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:23,016
Illegitimate pregnancy.

1105
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:25,489
It's something you think
only happens to the other guy.

1106
00:54:25,518 --> 00:54:27,496
I'm not pregnant.

1107
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:29,215
I'm on the pill.

1108
00:54:29,258 --> 00:54:30,905
I thought I told you
not to use the pill.

1109
00:54:30,952 --> 00:54:32,712
Is that how you
listen to me?!

1110
00:54:34,457 --> 00:54:37,138
Thank god you don't listen to me.

1111
00:54:39,419 --> 00:54:42,158
Well, look,
what's done is done, right?

1112
00:54:42,962 --> 00:54:44,438
So, uh...

1113
00:54:45,443 --> 00:54:47,245
Tell me about him.

1114
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:48,698
What's his name?

1115
00:54:48,761 --> 00:54:50,024
Who is he, um...

1116
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:52,426
some kid like you
just out of diapers?

1117
00:54:52,552 --> 00:54:53,952
He's older.

1118
00:54:54,046 --> 00:54:55,352
Oh, an older guy.

1119
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:57,452
What, 19, 20?

1120
00:54:57,524 --> 00:54:58,912
Older.

1121
00:54:59,024 --> 00:55:00,646
21?

1122
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:02,304
43.

1123
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,129
43!

1124
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,249
You made love to a man of 43?

1125
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:10,049
It's not that old.

1126
00:55:10,193 --> 00:55:12,685
It's obscene.
Believe me.

1127
00:55:12,882 --> 00:55:14,938
I'm that old,
and it's obscene!

1128
00:55:15,124 --> 00:55:16,625
It was beautiful!

1129
00:55:16,753 --> 00:55:18,111
Oh, yeah?

1130
00:55:18,423 --> 00:55:19,743
And now what?

1131
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:22,196
What's the next beautiful
thing that happens?

1132
00:55:22,296 --> 00:55:23,863
- Nothing.
- Really?

1133
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:26,006
You go right from
beautiful to nothing.

1134
00:55:26,053 --> 00:55:27,269
Now why is that?

1135
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:28,845
Because he's married.

1136
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:31,272
Close, you bastard, close.

1137
00:55:31,387 --> 00:55:32,574
He's married?

1138
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,801
I'll tell you what else he is.
He's dead!

1139
00:55:34,907 --> 00:55:37,314
I love him, Daddy!

1140
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:43,210
My poor baby.

1141
00:55:49,273 --> 00:55:50,779
Just tell me who he is.

1142
00:55:50,826 --> 00:55:53,019
That's all I want to know.

1143
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,174
Who is he, Jennifer?

1144
00:55:56,212 --> 00:55:59,047
It doesn't matter.
It's over.

1145
00:56:02,031 --> 00:56:03,601
- Matthew!
- What?

1146
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,374
- Where are you going?
- Sao Paulo.

1147
00:56:05,427 --> 00:56:06,854
- Now?
- I-I-I have to.

1148
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:08,114
Something came up.

1149
00:56:08,141 --> 00:56:09,160
You can't.

1150
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,544
No, I... I'll be back,
but I have to go first.

1151
00:56:11,591 --> 00:56:12,744
Matthew!

1152
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:13,858
I need you.

1153
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:15,670
I-I couldn't refuse.

1154
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:18,792
I... I was his best friend,
and he needed my help.

1155
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:19,992
My help.

1156
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:22,698
It was like asking an arsonist
to become the fire chief.

1157
00:56:22,738 --> 00:56:24,371
It's my fault.

1158
00:56:24,744 --> 00:56:26,424
The whole thing.

1159
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,925
If I'd been around more,

1160
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,865
if not for the divorce,
it never would've happened.

1161
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:35,145
The guy's a father figure.
That's all.

1162
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:37,152
It's classic. You know
what I'm talking about?

1163
00:56:37,197 --> 00:56:38,212
Yep.

1164
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:40,292
The kid's got such good instincts.

1165
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:43,160
She feels she's gonna
protect the son of a bitch.

1166
00:56:43,348 --> 00:56:45,473
Oh, I have to admire that.

1167
00:56:45,553 --> 00:56:46,573
Yeah.

1168
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:48,602
But, I can't leave it like this.

1169
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:50,862
I've gotta know who he is.

1170
00:56:52,272 --> 00:56:54,214
It's gotta be you, Matthew.

1171
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,460
What?

1172
00:56:55,778 --> 00:56:58,625
She loves you.
She trusts you.

1173
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:00,765
Take her out, will ya?

1174
00:57:00,914 --> 00:57:02,554
Maybe she'll
tell you something.

1175
00:57:02,825 --> 00:57:04,147
This was it.

1176
00:57:04,186 --> 00:57:05,807
The moment had come.

1177
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:07,928
I summoned all my courage.

1178
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,348
- Victor...
- What?

1179
00:57:11,914 --> 00:57:13,787
Where shall I take her?

1180
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,508
First he said it was over,

1181
00:57:15,637 --> 00:57:17,095
then he asked me to lunch.

1182
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:19,575
It was like taking crazy 1 and 2.

1183
00:57:19,618 --> 00:57:21,128
But I didn't care.

1184
00:57:21,183 --> 00:57:24,215
I was so happy, I wanted
to give him a present.

1185
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:27,185
something no one else
in the world could give him.

1186
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:29,857
♪ What if we both went
a little bit crazy? ♪

1187
00:57:29,899 --> 00:57:31,437

1194

It's for you.

1195
00:57:58,671 --> 00:58:00,837
Are you mad?
I can't keep this.

1196
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:02,504
Don't you like it?

1197
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:04,524
I think it's pretty.

1198
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:05,971
Get outta there.

1199
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:07,517
Maybe I'll sell it at school.

1200
00:58:07,603 --> 00:58:10,157
Better put it away before
they're selling it all over Tokyo.

1201
00:58:10,217 --> 00:58:11,657
Yes, Uncle Matthew.

1202
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,323
I wish that's all I was again.

1203
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:14,417
I truly do.

1204
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:17,277
No, you don't, or you would've
never asked me out for lunch.

1205
00:58:17,322 --> 00:58:18,804
Do you know why we're here?

1206
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:20,926
I'm supposed to find out
who your lover is,

1207
00:58:20,986 --> 00:58:23,079
before it drives
your father crazy.

1208
00:58:23,186 --> 00:58:24,321
Poor daddy.

1209
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,726
Yours or Nicole's?

1210
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:27,574
- Mine.
- Oh, that poor daddy.

1211
00:58:27,621 --> 00:58:30,560
You can't swing a dead cat around here
without hitting a poor daddy.

1212
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,287
What are you
going to tell him?

1213
00:58:32,347 --> 00:58:33,660
He's my friend.

1214
00:58:33,715 --> 00:58:34,916
I'll have to lie.

1215
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,883
I'll say that you
wouldn't tell me

1216
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:39,040
who your decrepit
married old man is.

1217
00:58:39,107 --> 00:58:41,293
But, you promised
it was all over between you.

1218
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:42,900
Then you would be lying.

1219
00:58:42,951 --> 00:58:44,727
It's never going to be over.

1220
00:58:44,793 --> 00:58:46,294
Can't you understand?

1221
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:48,300
I'm going to love you forever.

1222
00:58:48,357 --> 00:58:50,044
You have got
to stop using words

1223
00:58:50,077 --> 00:58:51,757
like "forever" and "married."

1224
00:58:51,807 --> 00:58:53,744
- Why?
- Because I happen to be one.

1225
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:56,157
And we can never be the other.

1226
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:12,656
Jennifer, darling,

1227
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:14,587
even if it was possible for us...

1228
00:59:14,629 --> 00:59:16,630
I mean,
everyone else aside...

1229
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:18,162
You keep forgetting
the difference...

1230
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,590
I know, you're a thousand years old.

1231
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:21,943
It doesn't matter.

1232
00:59:21,977 --> 00:59:22,983
Jennifer...

1233
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:25,037
You can call me
darling if you like.

1234
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:26,633
It doesn't matter now,

1235
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:29,632
but when you're my age,
do you know what I'll be?

1236
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:30,899
Dead, I suppose.

1237
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,399
Dead and a half.

1238
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:35,476
Chaplin and Picasso married
much younger women.

1239
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,142
Who, in turn, became
much younger widows.

1240
00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:40,952
I'd rather spend a few years
with the man I love

1241
00:59:40,992 --> 00:59:43,151
than a lifetime
with someone I don't.

1242
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:46,513
Well, if you're going to use logic,
I'll lose my advantage

1243
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:49,867
I like it when
you treat me like a woman.

1244
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:52,267
I mean, outside of bed.

1245
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:54,961
Eat your meat.

1246
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,121
So much for that treatment.

1247
00:59:57,281 --> 00:59:59,634
Don't you know any boys
your own age you like?

1248
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:01,182
I don't like boys.

1249
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,553
You would if
you gave them a chance.

1250
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,233
You said "hello" to him before.

1251
01:00:05,293 --> 01:00:07,066
He looks a decent sort.

1252
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:08,480
Clean-cut.

1253
01:00:08,682 --> 01:00:10,696
The kind that calls
your father "sir"

1254
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:13,069
and tries to chew
the rivets off your jeans?

1255
01:00:15,034 --> 01:00:18,159
Age doesn't matter.
I'm going to die young anyway.

1256
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,154
Look how short my life line is.

1257
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,240
That's all rubbish.

1258
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,676
I practically don't have one at all.

1259
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:26,597
That's not your life line.

1260
01:00:27,135 --> 01:00:29,433
That's your heart line.

1261
01:00:32,942 --> 01:00:35,219
Teeny little thing, isn't it?

1262
01:00:52,446 --> 01:00:54,999
You used to hold my hand
before we were lovers.

1263
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:57,193
See how it works?

1264
01:01:00,017 --> 01:01:01,732
Bernardo!

1265
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,340
He's 19.

1266
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:04,747
Is that what you had in mind?

1267
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,288
19 is perfect.

1268
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:09,501
I've been 19 a couple
of times myself.

1269
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,028
Do you really
want me to?

1270
01:01:12,343 --> 01:01:13,674
Go ahead.

1271
01:01:26,732 --> 01:01:28,901
He was just what
I said she needed.

1272
01:01:29,094 --> 01:01:32,037
Young, uninvolved,
uncomplicated.

1273
01:01:32,102 --> 01:01:34,103
I couldn't have been happier.

1274
01:01:34,198 --> 01:01:37,701
Except for a sudden throb
in my temple...

1275
01:01:37,783 --> 01:01:40,373
that went all the way
down to my heart.

1276
01:01:45,013 --> 01:01:47,271
She wouldn't tell you
anything about him?

1277
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:49,031
I'm sorry, Victor.

1278
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,417
Not a hint?

1279
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,903
Not a clue to who
the guy might be?

1280
01:01:53,348 --> 01:01:56,124
All she said was that
he was confused.

1281
01:01:56,327 --> 01:01:57,871
About what?

1282
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:00,084
Between his feelings for Jennifer

1283
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:02,084
and his feelings for his wife.

1284
01:02:02,374 --> 01:02:04,431
Now he thinks of his wife, right?

1285
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:08,070
I don't think the poor bastard ever thought
he'd get so emotionally involved.

1286
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,263
Poor bastard, huh?

1287
01:02:09,304 --> 01:02:11,555
If I get my hands on him,
I'll beat him to death.

1288
01:02:11,596 --> 01:02:13,303
That'll unconfuse him.

1289
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:15,897
A beating is not
the way, my friend.

1290
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,335
He's right, you know.

1291
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:20,428
Personally, I prefer torture.

1292
01:02:37,872 --> 01:02:39,195
What's the matter?

1293
01:02:39,232 --> 01:02:41,815
I think I'm getting strep throat.

1294
01:02:42,457 --> 01:02:45,288
I have to get in early.
Thanks for tonight.

1295
01:02:57,936 --> 01:02:59,735
Did you tell him?

1296
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,255
Nope.

1297
01:03:01,555 --> 01:03:03,548
Well, good night.

1298
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:11,428
Is that Jennifer?

1299
01:03:11,536 --> 01:03:13,245
Uh, yeah.

1300
01:03:13,432 --> 01:03:15,065
Is she all right?

1301
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,785
How'd she look?

1302
01:03:16,969 --> 01:03:19,645
Quite beautiful, actually.

1303
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,475
She is, isn't she?

1304
01:03:21,991 --> 01:03:23,441
I think so.

1305
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,633
Just like her mother.

1306
01:03:26,982 --> 01:03:29,206
Another one of my screwups.

1307
01:03:29,904 --> 01:03:31,723
It takes two, Victor.

1308
01:03:31,999 --> 01:03:33,658
Not to screw up.

1309
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:38,058
First my marriage,
now my kid.

1310
01:03:38,323 --> 01:03:41,236
What do I blow next,
our friendship?

1311
01:03:42,464 --> 01:03:44,282
If I ever lost that...

1312
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,563
I mean, if I ever blew it
between you and me,

1313
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:49,089
that'd be it.

1314
01:03:49,157 --> 01:03:52,276
Victor, there-there's something
I've got to tell you.

1315
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,358
I can't bear
to see you this way.

1316
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:57,218
- Me, neither.
- No, no. Let me finish.

1317
01:03:57,304 --> 01:03:59,113
We came here
to have a good time.

1318
01:03:59,194 --> 01:04:01,696
And all I've done is
burden you with my problems.

1319
01:04:01,742 --> 01:04:02,927
Oh, that's not true.

1320
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:04,073
You're a rock.

1321
01:04:04,134 --> 01:04:07,017
My whole crappy life is
in chaos as a storm.

1322
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,517
And you're the one rock right
in the middle of it I can cling to.

1323
01:04:10,571 --> 01:04:12,224
You're a rock.

1324
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:14,629
Not entirely, Victor.

1325
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:17,549
I mean,
I'm not all rock.

1326
01:04:17,765 --> 01:04:19,907
I'm not worthy of you.

1327
01:04:20,714 --> 01:04:22,850
I'm not worthy of anybody.

1328
01:04:23,711 --> 01:04:25,794
Victor, Victor,
you can't.

1329
01:04:26,714 --> 01:04:28,422
This isn't for me.

1330
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:30,607
What do you think I'm crazy?

1331
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:32,574
This is for him.

1332
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:35,123
I'm gonna find him.
And whoever he is,

1333
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,956
he's gonna get this
right up the doodah.

1334
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,532
Ciao, baby.

1335
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,062
Nicky? Nicky?

1336
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:50,355
Where have you been tonight?
Last night?

1337
01:04:50,588 --> 01:04:51,858
What do you care?

1338
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,711
I'm your father.

1339
01:04:54,077 --> 01:04:55,695
Do I ask where you go?

1340
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:57,158
I have been here.

1341
01:04:57,201 --> 01:04:59,834
Sure, this is
where the action is.

1342
01:05:00,121 --> 01:05:02,787
I've played dumb
so often with you,

1343
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:05,457
I know when you're
playing dumb with me.

1344
01:05:06,424 --> 01:05:10,027
I hope I'm as smart as you are
when I get to be your age.

1345
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:14,440
You always said that honesty
should never be painful.

1346
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:16,374
I was wrong.

1347
01:05:17,731 --> 01:05:19,248
She's in love, you know.

1348
01:05:19,397 --> 01:05:20,821
She thinks so.

1349
01:05:20,892 --> 01:05:23,175
If you think so,
you are.

1350
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:25,229
The first is always the hardest.

1351
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:26,882
You're not the first.

1352
01:05:26,995 --> 01:05:28,788
Well, I know.

1353
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:31,037
They're all hard in a way.

1354
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:34,423
She'll get over you.
Just be yourself.

1355
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:37,450
I had to admit,

1356
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:39,930
Jennifer had gotten
under my skin.

1357
01:05:40,044 --> 01:05:42,370
I had no one
to turn to for advice.

1358
01:05:42,687 --> 01:05:46,250
What I needed was
objective professional help.

1359
01:05:53,654 --> 01:05:56,334
The more trouble
in heart and mind,

1360
01:05:56,384 --> 01:05:59,888
the more candles you must burn
for the help of the gods.

1361
01:06:00,087 --> 01:06:01,574
How young is the girl?

1362
01:06:01,627 --> 01:06:03,440
Uh, uh, she's quite young.

1363
01:06:03,517 --> 01:06:05,220
Half your age?

1364
01:06:05,272 --> 01:06:07,154
Less than half.

1365
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:09,528
How many do I take?

1366
01:06:09,668 --> 01:06:11,928
take the whole box.

1367
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:15,739
A-ha!

1368
01:06:27,689 --> 01:06:29,142
- Matthew!
- What?

1369
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,468
In here.

1370
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:34,940
Come in here!

1371
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,045
- What's wrong?
- Close the door.

1372
01:06:43,944 --> 01:06:46,111
- What is it?
- Come over here.

1373
01:06:46,365 --> 01:06:47,884
Quiet.
Wait.

1374
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:50,939
- Shit!
- What's going on?

1375
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:53,366
Jennifer's diary.

1376
01:06:54,905 --> 01:06:55,995
Her diary?

1377
01:06:56,073 --> 01:06:59,028
That's not all.
Look at this.

1378
01:07:02,377 --> 01:07:04,530
You can't look at that.
He took pictures of her.

1379
01:07:04,595 --> 01:07:05,984
Oh, I'm sure he wouldn't.

1380
01:07:06,037 --> 01:07:07,557
He wouldn't, huh?

1381
01:07:07,671 --> 01:07:10,807
He forced himself on her
at the beach, didn't he?

1382
01:07:13,514 --> 01:07:14,794
- Victor!
- What?

1383
01:07:14,885 --> 01:07:16,728
You can't read that.

1384
01:07:16,842 --> 01:07:19,648
That is someone's private
personal property.

1385
01:07:19,697 --> 01:07:22,500
Are you nuts?
Whose side are you on?

1386
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,494
Listen to this.

1387
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:29,812
"Last night
it finally happened.

1388
01:07:29,965 --> 01:07:33,515
"We lay in the sand together,
my body next to his.

1389
01:07:33,825 --> 01:07:36,361
"My legs, his legs,
each of us the other."

1390
01:07:36,434 --> 01:07:37,734
Disgusting.

1391
01:07:37,816 --> 01:07:40,002
- She said that?
- I said that.

1392
01:07:41,633 --> 01:07:43,133
It goes on and on.

1393
01:07:43,387 --> 01:07:46,750
Come on, Jennifer,
what's his name? What's his name?

1394
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,798
- A-ha!
- Victor, I can explain.

1395
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:53,458
"He's all I ever dreamed of.

1396
01:07:53,504 --> 01:07:56,307
"He's a much better
lover than moose."

1397
01:07:58,129 --> 01:07:59,647
Moose?

1398
01:08:00,992 --> 01:08:02,404
Who the hell is moose?

1399
01:08:02,494 --> 01:08:03,994
Must be some kid at school.

1400
01:08:04,044 --> 01:08:05,571
She never told me about him, either.

1401
01:08:05,611 --> 01:08:08,941
How can you send her to a school
where the guys are called "moose"?

1402
01:08:09,107 --> 01:08:11,074
- Explain what?
- What?

1403
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,982
You said you could
explain something.

1404
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:15,422
I can.
Yes.

1405
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:18,645
This... this.
I can explain this.

1406
01:08:18,819 --> 01:08:21,299
It's youth.
That's all.

1407
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:22,899
Kids exaggerate.

1408
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:25,748
They make things up.
They make people up.

1409
01:08:26,034 --> 01:08:27,628
Oh, yeah?

1410
01:08:27,769 --> 01:08:29,781
Did she make this up?

1411
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,410
"I go to sleep with
his smile on my lips.

1412
01:08:33,464 --> 01:08:36,804
"I love his sweet mouth.
His funny little teeth.

1413
01:08:36,914 --> 01:08:38,729
"I love looking
deep into his soul

1414
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:41,395
"through his lovely blue eyes,

1415
01:08:41,876 --> 01:08:45,554
"eyes that seem
to see the real me

1416
01:08:45,716 --> 01:08:48,785
"for the very first time."

1417
01:08:49,059 --> 01:08:50,705
Why are you wearing those?

1418
01:08:50,745 --> 01:08:52,839
- I'm getting a sty.
- Just like that?

1419
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:54,252
How else?

1420
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:02,896
I don't believe this.

1421
01:09:03,053 --> 01:09:04,666
She doesn't say
who he is anywhere.

1422
01:09:04,728 --> 01:09:06,213
Nowhere?

1423
01:09:06,703 --> 01:09:08,393
The hell with it.

1424
01:09:09,134 --> 01:09:10,431
We got enough clues.

1425
01:09:10,454 --> 01:09:12,198
- Come on.
- Where?

1426
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,752
You and I are gonna
find that bastard.

1428
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,591

1429
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:22,751
Try to think.

1430
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,031
Didn't she tell you anything?
You're her best friend.

1431
01:09:25,102 --> 01:09:27,902
Sometimes, even best friends
keep secrets from each other.

1432
01:09:27,962 --> 01:09:30,429
A nickname, a pet name.
Where he lives.

1433
01:09:30,755 --> 01:09:33,199
Who can remember
everyone she goes out with?

1434
01:09:33,247 --> 01:09:34,732
There's more than one?

1435
01:09:34,856 --> 01:09:37,856
Well, there's the dancer
at the club we were at.

1436
01:09:37,902 --> 01:09:38,996
The singer, too.

1437
01:09:39,115 --> 01:09:40,263
She's seeing all of them?

1438
01:09:40,316 --> 01:09:41,923
Well, you know how it is, Dad?

1439
01:09:41,973 --> 01:09:43,473
When you're hot, you're hot.

1440
01:09:43,561 --> 01:09:45,599
Any of these guys
own a polaroid?

1441
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:47,212
What?

1442
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:50,457
Never mind.
Let's go.

1443
01:09:53,597 --> 01:09:54,833
Be careful, Nicky.

1444
01:09:54,865 --> 01:09:56,407
You're not really gonna
go up on that, are you?

1445
01:09:56,441 --> 01:09:59,893
I like to live dangerously.
Runs in the family.

I really appreciate
you not saying anything.

1449
01:10:12,028 --> 01:10:14,424
My father's had
a lot of experience,

1450
01:10:14,465 --> 01:10:16,466
but he'd never understand this.

1451
01:10:16,589 --> 01:10:18,002
I wish he knew, though.

1452
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:20,835
- Why don't you tell him?
- I want your dad to.

1453
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:22,342
He won't.
He's a coward.

1454
01:10:22,406 --> 01:10:23,907
Mine's blind.

1455
01:10:24,009 --> 01:10:26,236
- I'll trade you.
- I sort of have.

1456
01:10:26,549 --> 01:10:28,522
Who'd you send him to look for?

1457
01:10:28,606 --> 01:10:30,756
Just a couple of guys
to throw them off the track.

1458
01:10:30,815 --> 01:10:32,816
That's hysterical.
Who?

1459
01:10:32,858 --> 01:10:34,771
Like the singer
at the club.

1460
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:36,402
He's gross!

1461
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,248
That's why I picked him.

1462
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:40,508
You think your Dad will get jealous?

1463
01:10:40,618 --> 01:10:42,408
It's the least I could do for him.

1464
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,347
Come up and dance!
Somebody! Anybody!

1465
01:10:51,396 --> 01:10:53,787
Don't be shy!
Come up and dance!

1466
01:11:05,977 --> 01:11:07,681
Uh, no.
No, no, no.

1467
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:10,051
Not me.
I'm with my friend.

1468
01:11:12,657 --> 01:11:14,658
No, I... I can't dance.

1469
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:16,465
I can't!

1470
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,041
I can't. I... I don't
know how to dance.

1471
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,416
Hi, Uncle Matthew.

1472
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:26,276
It won't work, you know?

1473
01:11:26,498 --> 01:11:28,490
Trying to make me jealous.

1474
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:31,164
You think you're
playing with a kid.

1475
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,038
You think you are?

1476
01:11:34,408 --> 01:11:37,772
Please, I'm-I'm getting
over a bereavement.

1477
01:11:39,859 --> 01:11:41,752
Your father is out of his mind.

1478
01:11:41,803 --> 01:11:42,879
What else is new?

1479
01:11:42,917 --> 01:11:44,417
And I'm not much better.

1480
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:45,726
Really?

1481
01:11:46,047 --> 01:11:47,962
I need time to think things over.

1482
01:11:48,022 --> 01:11:51,009
You don't have that much time
at your age, do you?

1483
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:57,984
Did you really go out
with this android?

1484
01:11:58,029 --> 01:11:59,597
I think he likes you better.

1485
01:11:59,647 --> 01:12:00,944
See you later.

1486
01:12:10,742 --> 01:12:13,243
Well, what do you think?
Is it him? Is he the guy?

1487
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,333
I don't know.

1488
01:12:14,412 --> 01:12:15,660
You don't know?

1489
01:12:15,715 --> 01:12:17,771
What? You want one
more dance with him?

1490
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:26,174
That guy's singing right to her.

1491
01:12:26,233 --> 01:12:27,734
It doesn't mean anything.

1492
01:12:27,809 --> 01:12:30,488
What are the words?
What's he singing?

1493
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:38,111
He says...

1494
01:12:38,492 --> 01:12:40,493
"His love is the sea

1495
01:12:40,615 --> 01:12:42,701
"that goes on forever more."

1496
01:12:42,824 --> 01:12:44,081
Yeah?

1497
01:12:44,273 --> 01:12:46,442
"He lives to return to her

1498
01:12:46,614 --> 01:12:48,516
"again and again..."

1499
01:12:48,749 --> 01:12:50,069
Yeah?

1500
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:52,724
"And-and beat against her shore."

1501
01:12:52,859 --> 01:12:55,065
I'll give him "beat against her shore."

1502
01:12:55,202 --> 01:12:56,251
Victor!

1503
01:12:56,297 --> 01:12:58,131
Victor, don't!

1504
01:12:58,452 --> 01:12:59,629
Daddy!

1505
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,089
No!

1506
01:13:03,664 --> 01:13:05,691
Victor, stop it!

1507
01:13:07,168 --> 01:13:08,711
Victor, don't!

1508
01:13:14,328 --> 01:13:15,996
Victor, stop!

1509
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,656
Ohh!

1510
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:19,270
Victor!

1511
01:13:24,531 --> 01:13:27,018
He's got brown eyes.

1512
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:30,201
Welcome, my friends.

1513
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:34,681
It's all yours: The night,
the sky, my city, my restaurant.

1514
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:37,549
Claudio, champagne.

1515
01:13:39,001 --> 01:13:41,301
This is not a night to celebrate.

1516
01:13:41,499 --> 01:13:43,295
You did not find him?

1517
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:44,893
Not yet.

1518
01:13:45,366 --> 01:13:47,113
But he can't hide forever.

1519
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,686
Give it a rest, Victor.

1520
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,283
You can make yourself
sick over this.

1521
01:13:51,956 --> 01:13:53,223
Gold.

1522
01:13:53,316 --> 01:13:54,843
The man is gold.

1523
01:13:54,899 --> 01:13:57,010
As a friend should be.

1524
01:13:57,462 --> 01:14:00,045
Now we look at the menu, yes?

1525
01:14:00,244 --> 01:14:02,985
The stomach also has a heart.

1526
01:14:03,384 --> 01:14:04,944
Daddy?

1527
01:14:06,884 --> 01:14:08,407
I've gotta talk to you.

1528
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:10,446
Of course, sweetheart.
You want to be alone?

1529
01:14:10,494 --> 01:14:12,210
This is fine.

1530
01:14:15,906 --> 01:14:18,802
I love you, daddy,
very much.

1531
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,102
I can't let you go around
beating people up...

1532
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:26,222
Getting hurt yourself...

1533
01:14:30,084 --> 01:14:31,775
What happened...

1534
01:14:32,392 --> 01:14:34,196
happened out of tenderness,

1535
01:14:34,268 --> 01:14:36,520
out of beautiful feelings.

1536
01:14:36,801 --> 01:14:38,181
Don't think of it as ugly.

1537
01:14:38,342 --> 01:14:40,215
I don't want to.

1538
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:42,248
Just tell me who it is,
sweetheart.

1539
01:14:42,287 --> 01:14:45,362
Just tell me so we can
get this all behind us.

1540
01:14:56,113 --> 01:14:57,223
You!

1541
01:14:57,341 --> 01:15:00,090
Eu? El... Ela louca!

1542
01:15:01,713 --> 01:15:03,796
I'll give you "Ela louca!"
Come here!

1543
01:15:03,997 --> 01:15:05,082
Why didn't you tell him?

1544
01:15:05,107 --> 01:15:06,583
You wanted me to?

1545
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:07,834
Yes.

1546
01:15:07,898 --> 01:15:09,398
Then you'll tell him.

1547
01:15:09,486 --> 01:15:11,488
You'll speak for both of us.

1548
01:15:18,576 --> 01:15:20,112
It-It could not be me.

1549
01:15:20,177 --> 01:15:21,239
No, huh?

1550
01:15:21,285 --> 01:15:22,733
I-I am impotent.

1551
01:15:22,765 --> 01:15:24,679
I've seen you in the market
with young women.

1552
01:15:24,736 --> 01:15:26,453
Shopping is no problem.

1553
01:15:26,491 --> 01:15:28,133
Victor, does he look 43 to you?

1554
01:15:28,172 --> 01:15:29,539
I am 57!

1555
01:15:29,607 --> 01:15:31,565
- Horseshit!
- All right.

1556
01:15:31,664 --> 01:15:32,751
61.

1557
01:15:32,804 --> 01:15:35,035
He's too old.
He's not married.

1558
01:15:35,086 --> 01:15:36,915
He's not anything
that diary said.

1559
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:39,298
You said kids invent things.

1560
01:15:39,643 --> 01:15:41,172
And you saw her.

1561
01:15:41,266 --> 01:15:43,238
She stared right at him.

1562
01:15:43,926 --> 01:15:46,652
- It's him!
- It's not anyone we've seen!

1563
01:15:46,691 --> 01:15:48,112
How do you know?

1564
01:15:48,165 --> 01:15:50,121
Because it's me.

1565
01:16:00,838 --> 01:16:02,253
You?

1566
01:16:02,913 --> 01:16:03,966
Me.

1567
01:16:06,693 --> 01:16:08,673
Say something, Victor.

1568
01:16:11,687 --> 01:16:13,270
Hit me.

1569
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:17,484
Hit him.

1570
01:16:21,576 --> 01:16:24,388
Not hitting me feels
worse than if you did.

1571
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,435
How'd it happen?

1572
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:31,135
It was my fault.

1573
01:16:35,515 --> 01:16:37,471
I take full
responsibility.

1574
01:16:37,524 --> 01:16:38,710
That's big of you.

1575
01:16:40,283 --> 01:16:42,124
It was the night
of the wedding.

1576
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:44,325
Ah, romance was in the air.

1577
01:16:44,598 --> 01:16:47,725
Birds, music,
dancing, drums.

1578
01:16:47,802 --> 01:16:49,105
Everything at once.

1579
01:16:49,136 --> 01:16:51,338
Blame it on Rio, eh?

1580
01:16:51,932 --> 01:16:54,479
I wasn't thinking
what I was doing.

1581
01:16:55,222 --> 01:16:56,426
You understand.

1582
01:16:56,471 --> 01:16:59,316
It's only when a man is not
thinking of what he's doing

1583
01:16:59,366 --> 01:17:02,363
that you can be sure
he's doing what he's thinking.

1584
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:03,634
Thanks.

1585
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:07,526
You were by my side the whole time
we were looking for him.

1586
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:11,277
What a horse's ass
you must have thought I was.

1587
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:13,737
I-I didn't have the courage.

1588
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:16,405
Who asked you
for the courage now?

1589
01:17:18,442 --> 01:17:20,605
Why'd you have to tell me?

1590
01:17:21,442 --> 01:17:23,323
In spite of it all,...

1591
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:25,483
I'm your friend.

1592
01:17:25,609 --> 01:17:26,857
If you were really my friend,

1593
01:17:26,896 --> 01:17:29,393
you would've kept quiet
about what you did.

1594
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,183
Which you never would've done
if you were really my friend.

1595
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:35,957
Hit me.

1596
01:17:37,005 --> 01:17:38,211
Please.

1597
01:17:38,516 --> 01:17:40,599
Will you really
feel worse if I don't?

1598
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:42,203
Terrible.

1599
01:17:42,401 --> 01:17:44,418

1621
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:06,463
I want to talk to you.

1622
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,857
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

1623
01:19:07,903 --> 01:19:09,062
Oh!

1624
01:19:11,135 --> 01:19:12,659
Why aren't you in bed?

1625
01:19:12,771 --> 01:19:14,531
I was just going.

1626
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:19,031
Go to sleep.

1627
01:19:24,436 --> 01:19:25,843
Come on.

1628
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,599
Come on down!

1629
01:19:31,092 --> 01:19:33,419
Careful!
Careful!

1630
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,417
Quick, get in the car.
Come on.

1631
01:19:36,491 --> 01:19:39,637
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere. Get in.

1632
01:19:46,294 --> 01:19:49,283
You really told him?
I'm so proud of you.

1633
01:19:49,429 --> 01:19:51,114
You're probabl
y the only one who is.

1634
01:19:51,171 --> 01:19:52,181
Oh, Matthew.

1635
01:19:52,232 --> 01:19:53,713
Wait, wait.

1636
01:19:53,757 --> 01:19:56,287
It's got to stop.
Really.

1637
01:19:56,509 --> 01:19:59,010
We can't go on.
Not a minute longer.

1638
01:19:59,135 --> 01:20:00,294
But now that he knows...

1639
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:03,154
But, it only makes our relationship
even more impossible.

1640
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:06,643
Stop hiding behind words
like "relationship."

1641
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,196
We're in love.
You said.

1642
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:11,740
I was hoping,
in my usual dumb fashion

1643
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,207
that whenever it ended,

1644
01:20:13,264 --> 01:20:15,315
it would be without
your father ever knowing.

1645
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,280
But now he does...

1646
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:21,363
Must be Nicky.

1647
01:20:21,803 --> 01:20:23,516
I'm too old for this.

1648
01:20:23,936 --> 01:20:26,716
Hiding in front seats
like a teenager.

1649
01:20:27,085 --> 01:20:29,646
Next thing you know,
my skin'll be breaking out.

1650
01:20:30,733 --> 01:20:32,734
If this doesn't kill
your respect for me...

1651
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:34,406
Nothing can.

1652
01:20:34,862 --> 01:20:37,246
You didn't really
mean what you said.

1653
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:39,104
Please, don't.

1654
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:41,637
That's only going to work...

1655
01:20:41,919 --> 01:20:43,277
And it can't.

1656
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:44,444
Matthew...

1657
01:20:46,763 --> 01:20:48,153
Good night!

1658
01:20:56,723 --> 01:20:58,224
Matthew...

1659
01:20:58,599 --> 01:21:00,209
I love you so.

1660
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:01,615
Jennifer...

1661
01:21:01,735 --> 01:21:03,458
You know you love me.

1662
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:05,491
Don't you understand?

1663
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,878
That doesn't matter.

1664
01:21:07,064 --> 01:21:09,266
That's all that matters.

1665
01:21:29,021 --> 01:21:31,014
I just think you ought
to come right away.

1666
01:21:31,062 --> 01:21:32,921
Are you all right?

1667
01:21:33,029 --> 01:21:34,474
Nicole?

1668
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:36,447
Dad needs you.
He's in real trouble.

1669
01:21:36,497 --> 01:21:38,480
What's happened?
Is he hurt?

1670
01:21:38,559 --> 01:21:41,306
He's going to be, Mom,
and not just him.

1671
01:21:43,447 --> 01:21:45,550
Jennifer!
Get your stuff out here!

1672
01:21:45,593 --> 01:21:46,623
10 minutes!

1673
01:21:46,637 --> 01:21:48,943
We're getting the hell out
of this goddamn paradise!

1674
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:50,326
Up yours!

1675
01:21:50,416 --> 01:21:52,449
Jennifer!
Let's go!

1676
01:22:04,789 --> 01:22:06,714
- Victor...
- Out of my way, blue eyes.

1677
01:22:06,754 --> 01:22:09,208
You think I'm leaving my share
of the groceries here, you're nuts.

1678
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,814
- Give me a minute.
- A minute?

1679
01:22:10,888 --> 01:22:12,484
I'd like to give you life!

1680
01:22:12,593 --> 01:22:14,157
Stop shouting!

1681
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:16,964
I just want you to know
that I'm not somebody

1682
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:18,858
who hangs around
schoolyards in a raincoat.

1683
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:20,521
Try it.
You'd be very good.

1684
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:22,241
I'll give you a letter
of recommendation.

1685
01:22:22,283 --> 01:22:24,034
I felt very deeply for Jennifer.

1686
01:22:24,078 --> 01:22:25,860
- Real affection.
- Touching.

1687
01:22:25,893 --> 01:22:27,747
Even so, I made up
my mind to give her up.

1688
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,242
I told her
I was giving her up.

1689
01:22:29,287 --> 01:22:31,023
You bet your ass you are!

1690
01:22:31,077 --> 01:22:32,576
But I can't.

1691
01:22:32,796 --> 01:22:34,496
I care for her too much.

1692
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,081
Why the hell wouldn't you?

1693
01:22:36,183 --> 01:22:39,332
She's adorable, she's sweet,
 she's smart,  she's innocent.

1694
01:22:39,424 --> 01:22:40,433
Mostly!

1695
01:22:40,473 --> 01:22:43,452
You'd have to be even more senile
than you are not to care for her.

1696
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:44,991
I am not senile.

1697
01:22:45,139 --> 01:22:46,851
I'm crazy about her.

1698
01:22:47,006 --> 01:22:49,598
What the hell are you doing,
asking for her hand?

1699
01:22:49,682 --> 01:22:51,958
With this teething ring,
I thee wed?

1700
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,152
Is that it?

1701
01:22:53,193 --> 01:22:54,509
You want permission to marry?

1702
01:22:54,567 --> 01:22:56,856
If you ask your wife first,
I think that's better manners.

1703
01:22:56,884 --> 01:22:58,289
- Victor.
- Hey, but wait a minute.

1704
01:22:58,329 --> 01:23:01,711
If she says no, maybe you
and Karen could adopt Jennifer.

1705
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:04,181
I could still see her, of course.
I could baby-sit for you.

1706
01:23:04,228 --> 01:23:07,173
She is a woman, Victor.
She's very mature.

1707
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,187
Too bad we can't say
the same thing about you!

1708
01:23:09,233 --> 01:23:11,694
I love her.
It's as simple as that.

1709
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:13,743
sure, you do!
What else can you say, huh?

1710
01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:14,835
I'm serious!

1711
01:23:14,881 --> 01:23:16,887
I never thought I could
care this much again!

1712
01:23:16,947 --> 01:23:19,201
You say that one more time,
I'll take your head off!

1713
01:23:19,248 --> 01:23:20,284
Victor!

1714
01:23:20,344 --> 01:23:22,295
Karen.
What are you doing here?

1715
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:23,624
Let Matthew go.

1716
01:23:23,664 --> 01:23:25,758
Why did you leave Bahia?
Are you all right?

1717
01:23:25,799 --> 01:23:27,871
Nicky called.
She said you were in trouble.

1718
01:23:27,918 --> 01:23:29,591
Me, in trouble?

1719
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,198
There's no trouble here?

1720
01:23:31,278 --> 01:23:32,631
Is that what
you're telling me?

1721
01:23:32,673 --> 01:23:34,611
Victor is choking you
just for laughs?

1722
01:23:34,675 --> 01:23:37,539
Victor, stop it!
Stop acting like a maniac!

1723
01:23:37,566 --> 01:23:38,572
- Me?
- Yes.

1724
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:39,807
Me?
You want to hear maniac?

1725
01:23:39,853 --> 01:23:41,456
Ok, here you go.
Tell her!

1726
01:23:41,496 --> 01:23:43,036
- Hold it!
- I know it's tough for you.

1727
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:44,743
You can tell her later.
I'll tell her now.

1728
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:45,796
- Tell me what?
- Wait!

1729
01:23:45,829 --> 01:23:48,129
- Brace yourself.
- Stop preparing me!

1730
01:23:48,161 --> 01:23:50,445
Karen,
I've been unfaithful.

1731
01:23:50,575 --> 01:23:52,045
Matthew!

1732
01:23:52,326 --> 01:23:53,584
Is this a joke?

1733
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,437
Wait till you hear the punch line.

1734
01:23:55,509 --> 01:23:56,965
Matthew?

1735
01:23:57,047 --> 01:23:58,458
It's true.

1736
01:23:59,065 --> 01:24:00,245
Ask him with who.

1737
01:24:00,288 --> 01:24:01,358
Shut up, Victor!

1738
01:24:01,405 --> 01:24:03,458
Karen, can we be alone?

1739
01:24:03,727 --> 01:24:06,320
I think you have been
alone long enough.

1740
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:07,887
Who is she?

1741
01:24:08,342 --> 01:24:10,687
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer who?

1742
01:24:11,285 --> 01:24:12,969
Jennifer?

1743
01:24:13,347 --> 01:24:15,196
Cute little sweet little Jennifer?

1744
01:24:15,252 --> 01:24:16,256
Yeah.

1745
01:24:16,296 --> 01:24:17,350
That little bitch.

1746
01:24:17,416 --> 01:24:19,359
Hey, wait a minute.
Jennifer's my daughter.

1747
01:24:19,412 --> 01:24:21,808
Exactly!
How could you let this happen?

1748
01:24:21,855 --> 01:24:23,438
Me?
How could I let it happen?

1749
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:24,748
He had no idea.

1750
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:25,820
Does Nicky know?

1751
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:28,380
- Nicky who?
- You bastard.

1752
01:24:28,453 --> 01:24:30,287
I-I didn't mean
to be a bastard.

1753
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:33,360
Oh, I know.
It's just a gift.

1754
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:36,161
Is that your composition, dear?

1755
01:24:36,187 --> 01:24:38,054
"What I did on
my summer vacation."

1756
01:24:38,122 --> 01:24:40,267
- Karen.
- I came here as fast as I could

1757
01:24:40,307 --> 01:24:42,041
because I thought
you needed me.

1758
01:24:42,126 --> 01:24:43,962
You didn't need me.
You were fine.

1759
01:24:43,994 --> 01:24:45,569
A fantasy come true.

1760
01:24:45,629 --> 01:24:47,416
Gidget goes to Rio.

1761
01:24:47,758 --> 01:24:50,482
And what the hell
is wrong with you?

1762
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:52,440
- Were you blind?
- I had no idea.

1763
01:24:52,486 --> 01:24:54,100
They were alone.
I was out every night.

1764
01:24:54,162 --> 01:24:55,686
Oh, really?

1765
01:24:56,166 --> 01:24:58,280
No big deal.
Just uh for dinner.

1766
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,415
I'm sure.

1767
01:24:59,463 --> 01:25:01,404
Why do you have
to explain to her?

1768
01:25:01,645 --> 01:25:02,983
I don't.
Really.

1769
01:25:03,033 --> 01:25:05,534
Exactly. What you do
is none of my business.

1770
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:06,758
What you do is.

1771
01:25:06,798 --> 01:25:08,458
But it's important
that you understand...

1772
01:25:08,491 --> 01:25:10,465
Victor! Victor,
this is between Matthew and me.

1773
01:25:10,514 --> 01:25:12,043
I'm not just an outsider here.

1774
01:25:12,083 --> 01:25:13,102
Right now you are.

1775
01:25:13,137 --> 01:25:15,020
Victor, you have
every right to be hurt.

1776
01:25:15,065 --> 01:25:17,293
I-I know how much
you love her.

1777
01:25:17,467 --> 01:25:18,666
Who said I love her?

1778
01:25:18,766 --> 01:25:20,093
Victor!

1779
01:25:20,267 --> 01:25:22,217
Are you saying
you don't love Jennifer?

1780
01:25:22,301 --> 01:25:25,190
Of course I love Jennifer.
What do you take me for?

1781
01:25:25,905 --> 01:25:28,028
Who did you think I meant?

1782
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:32,848
What's going on here?

1783
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:35,873
I've wanted to tell you, Matthew.

1784
01:25:36,016 --> 01:25:37,633
It's what I went away
to think about.

1785
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:38,748
Tell me what?

1786
01:25:38,804 --> 01:25:40,576
- We're in love.
- No, we're not!

1787
01:25:40,614 --> 01:25:42,180
What do you mean,
"we're in love"?

1788
01:25:42,227 --> 01:25:43,547
What do you mean we're not?

1789
01:25:43,604 --> 01:25:45,560
Quiet, both of you!
I can't lead a double life.

1790
01:25:45,606 --> 01:25:47,874
You had that kind of marriage, Victor.
I don't.

1791
01:25:47,928 --> 01:25:49,429
Are you two
having an affair?

1792
01:25:49,474 --> 01:25:50,516
Were.

1793
01:25:50,557 --> 01:25:52,307
Were having an affair?

1794
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,927
You and Victor?

1795
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:56,080
What's even worse,
Victor and you?

1796
01:25:56,272 --> 01:25:58,427
He's offended,
Mr. clean.

1797
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:01,656
No wonder you were so upset
she wasn't coming.

1798
01:26:01,716 --> 01:26:03,110
More upset than you.

1799
01:26:03,146 --> 01:26:06,496
So preoccupied all the time.
So injured. So self-righteous.

1800
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:09,085
Sleeping with someone else's wife
doesn't count, it's that it?

1801
01:26:09,213 --> 01:26:11,556
At least your wife isn't
anybody's daughter.

1802
01:26:11,629 --> 01:26:12,723
Matthew, how could you?

1803
01:26:12,769 --> 01:26:13,976
How could I?

1804
01:26:14,017 --> 01:26:15,629
Mom?

1805
01:26:16,135 --> 01:26:17,682
Nicky, darling.

1806
01:26:17,808 --> 01:26:18,832
How could you?

1807
01:26:18,872 --> 01:26:21,292
We were in love. That makes
the hell of a difference, buddy.

1808
01:26:21,341 --> 01:26:23,917
- Love?
- We weren't just looking for a thrill.

1809
01:26:24,643 --> 01:26:26,511
Is that why you did it?

1810
01:26:26,693 --> 01:26:28,537
Listen to this...

1811
01:26:29,066 --> 01:26:31,509
"Matthew dearest,
I don't want to go on without you.

1812
01:26:31,568 --> 01:26:33,569
"I'll dream of you eternally."

1813
01:26:48,475 --> 01:26:50,476
The last time we were
together like this,

1814
01:26:50,524 --> 01:26:52,928
we were waiting
for her to be born.

1815
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:54,754
Victor?

1816
01:26:55,589 --> 01:26:57,602
As strange as it may sound,

1817
01:26:58,655 --> 01:27:00,045
I love you.

1818
01:27:03,684 --> 01:27:06,430
- Senhor Lyons?
- Yes.

1819
01:27:09,362 --> 01:27:11,465
We've done all we can.

1820
01:27:13,594 --> 01:27:15,459
She's out of danger.

1821
01:27:21,066 --> 01:27:22,615
Thank God.

1822
01:27:23,073 --> 01:27:25,842
I had no idea
she had any sleeping pills.

1823
01:27:26,172 --> 01:27:27,941
How many did she take?

1824
01:27:28,068 --> 01:27:29,128
None.

1825
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:30,328
None?

1826
01:27:30,389 --> 01:27:32,390
Your daughter took
an overdose of...

1827
01:27:32,558 --> 01:27:34,395
birth control pills.

1828
01:27:41,554 --> 01:27:42,913
That's not a problem, is it?

1829
01:27:43,046 --> 01:27:45,060
She's not gonna grow a beard
or anything like that?

1830
01:27:45,127 --> 01:27:46,413
No.

1831
01:27:46,546 --> 01:27:48,493
Is she allowed visitors, doctor?

1832
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:51,191
One, perhaps, and...

1833
01:27:51,571 --> 01:27:53,511
For just a moment.

1834
01:27:56,286 --> 01:27:58,442
Hello, Aunt Karen.

1835
01:27:59,849 --> 01:28:01,959
The doctor said
you're going to be fine.

1836
01:28:02,051 --> 01:28:03,699
They pumped my stomach.

1837
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:05,192
Mmm.

1838
01:28:05,651 --> 01:28:08,041
I'm not on any kind
of machine, am I?

1839
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:09,387
Believe me, Jennifer,

1840
01:28:09,447 --> 01:28:11,756
there's not a plug
in here worth pulling.

1841
01:28:11,848 --> 01:28:13,529
All you need is rest.

1842
01:28:13,677 --> 01:28:16,214
I've got some sleeping pills
if you'd like.

1843
01:28:16,654 --> 01:28:17,973
You're angry.

1844
01:28:18,008 --> 01:28:19,101
No.

1845
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:21,134
It'll take a while
to be angry.

1846
01:28:21,331 --> 01:28:24,687
I've got to get over furious first,
you little shit.

1847
01:28:25,047 --> 01:28:26,621
When you get older,
and obviously

1848
01:28:26,653 --> 01:28:28,741
you're going to get
a second chance at that,

1849
01:28:28,772 --> 01:28:31,273
you'll find you can't have
whatever you want.

1850
01:28:31,688 --> 01:28:33,626
And there's a price
for everything you get.

1851
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:36,613
And sometimes,
other people have to pay it.

1852
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:39,973
He loves you.

1853
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,830
He told me.

1854
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:44,927
That you talked together
bothers me more than anything.

1855
01:28:45,241 --> 01:28:47,416
It's all my fault, really.

1856
01:28:47,483 --> 01:28:49,544
He never had a chance.

1857
01:28:49,593 --> 01:28:51,591
Men seldom do.

1858
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,815
Please...

1859
01:28:54,281 --> 01:28:56,783
Don't hate me.

1860
01:28:57,024 --> 01:28:59,026
It's more like envy.

1861
01:29:06,935 --> 01:29:09,249
- Karen?
- Go away.

1862
01:29:14,743 --> 01:29:15,966
Nicky?

1863
01:29:16,061 --> 01:29:18,599
Go away.
This is a recording.

1864
01:29:26,263 --> 01:29:28,010
What do you want?

1865
01:29:28,187 --> 01:29:29,997
There's no other bed.

1866
01:29:30,313 --> 01:29:32,246
- Bastard.
- Prick.

1867
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:33,844
And to think
I said I love you.

1868
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,734
- To who?
- To you.

1869
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:37,720
You love anything
that stands still.

1870
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:39,672
Unlike some people I know.

1871
01:29:39,712 --> 01:29:40,881
Screw you.

1872
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:42,748
Bloody hypocrite.

1873
01:29:42,994 --> 01:29:45,214
I used to feel guilty
about me and Karen.

1874
01:29:45,317 --> 01:29:49,105
Just don't think that my being
with Jennifer lets you off the hook.

1875
01:29:49,825 --> 01:29:50,872
Move over.

1876
01:29:50,901 --> 01:29:52,821
You don't deserve her.
You know that, don't you?

1877
01:29:52,848 --> 01:29:54,488
- Which one?
- Both.

1878
01:29:54,528 --> 01:29:56,295
- Either.
- Neither do you.

1879
01:29:56,394 --> 01:29:58,064
Tough.
Karen's not going back.

1880
01:29:58,124 --> 01:29:59,264
Like hell she isn't!

1881
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:01,430
I thought
you wanted Jennifer!

1882
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:03,783
Give me some!
Give me half!

1883
01:30:03,864 --> 01:30:05,127
Half?
You want half?

1884
01:30:05,154 --> 01:30:06,321
Who are you?
My goddamn wife?

1885
01:30:06,347 --> 01:30:07,914
What, you wanna be
Jennifer's mother, too?

1886
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,327
Stop throwing
Jennifer up to me!

1887
01:30:09,369 --> 01:30:10,553
And you can stop pretending

1888
01:30:10,602 --> 01:30:12,603
you've got some kind
of moral superiority

1889
01:30:12,653 --> 01:30:14,217
because you are a fraud!

1890
01:30:14,293 --> 01:30:16,294
No wonder you wouldn't
hit me when you found out!

1891
01:30:16,376 --> 01:30:17,812
Still want me
to hit you? Huh?

1892
01:30:17,878 --> 01:30:19,786
Yeah?
How about now?

1893
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,026
Fine!

1894
01:30:21,147 --> 01:30:23,663
Get up so I can kill you!
Come on, you don't...

1895
01:30:23,799 --> 01:30:24,830
Aah!

1896
01:30:24,941 --> 01:30:26,328
No biting!

1897
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:28,050
Come...
Hey! Come here!

1898
01:30:28,117 --> 01:30:29,600
- Come...
- Aah!

1899
01:30:29,667 --> 01:30:30,850
Jeez!
No kicking!

1900
01:30:30,891 --> 01:30:32,507
You can't get rabies from kicking!

1901
01:30:32,549 --> 01:30:34,173
Aah!

1902
01:30:34,407 --> 01:30:35,793
Let go!

1903
01:30:35,872 --> 01:30:38,415
- I'll kill you!
- Why don't you shut up!

1904
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:39,922
Aah!
Ohh!

1905
01:30:39,962 --> 01:30:41,978
- Watch it! Those are my balls.
- Are you kidding?

1906
01:30:42,012 --> 01:30:44,505
I couldn't find them
with a magnifying glass!

1907
01:30:50,273 --> 01:30:53,553
It was quite simply
the worst night of my life.

1908
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:55,713
My embarrassment
compounded by the fact

1909
01:30:55,906 --> 01:31:00,249
that Victor had now slept with 2
out of the 3 members of my family.

1910
01:31:45,776 --> 01:31:47,409
Jennifer, I was just
gonna pick you up.

1911
01:31:47,477 --> 01:31:49,316
I got a ride.
Lorenzo drove me.

1912
01:31:49,356 --> 01:31:50,856
You all right?
How do you feel?

1913
01:31:50,896 --> 01:31:52,322
Fine.

1914
01:31:52,411 --> 01:31:53,691
Where'd you meet Lorenzo?

1915
01:31:53,753 --> 01:31:56,185
At the hospital.
Lorenzo!

1916
01:31:56,309 --> 01:31:58,225
He took
wonderful care of me.

1917
01:31:58,272 --> 01:31:59,845
He's studying to be a doctor.

1918
01:31:59,926 --> 01:32:01,427
I want you
to meet my father.

1919
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:02,975
Oh.

1920
01:32:03,223 --> 01:32:05,039
It's a great pleasure, sir.

1921
01:32:05,331 --> 01:32:06,806
Him.

1922
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,864
Get your stuff.
We're going.

1923
01:32:09,906 --> 01:32:11,626
That's what
I wanted to ask you.

1924
01:32:11,665 --> 01:32:12,743
What?

1925
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,007
Can I stay?

1926
01:32:14,053 --> 01:32:15,793
- Stay where?
- Here.

1927
01:32:15,913 --> 01:32:18,313
We still have the house
for another week.

1928
01:32:18,573 --> 01:32:20,773
Nicky'll stay with me,
wouldn't you?

1929
01:32:20,907 --> 01:32:22,359
Could I?

1930
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:24,253
Are you staying?

1931
01:32:24,499 --> 01:32:26,706
- No.
- Then you can stay.

1932
01:32:26,779 --> 01:32:28,393
You don't mind
leaving them alone?

1933
01:32:28,448 --> 01:32:30,949
You mean they might not
behave as well as we did?

1934
01:32:30,997 --> 01:32:34,114
Lorenzo will look out for us.
He said he would.

1935
01:32:35,194 --> 01:32:37,211
What the hell do I know
about Lorenzo?

1936
01:32:37,269 --> 01:32:38,769
He's 21.

1937
01:32:38,974 --> 01:32:41,211
He's perfect.
I love him.

1938
01:32:41,382 --> 01:32:44,197
Ok, ok, I better go call
the airlines and tell them.

1939
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:45,824
Victor!

1940
01:32:46,108 --> 01:32:48,045
Come see the house.
It's beautiful.

1941
01:32:48,085 --> 01:32:49,105
Nicky?

1942
01:32:49,172 --> 01:32:51,173
It all worked out
very neatly...

1943
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:54,232
Except for me,
the odd man out.

1944
01:32:54,364 --> 01:32:57,367
Well, no complaints.
I made my own bed.

1945
01:32:57,466 --> 01:33:00,144
I just never thought
I'd wind up in it alone.

1946
01:33:04,273 --> 01:33:06,849
Uncle Matthew,
you were right, you know.

1947
01:33:06,992 --> 01:33:09,363
I can't imagine about what.

1948
01:33:10,036 --> 01:33:12,714
That was a dream
I had on the beach.

1949
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:14,668
A beautiful dream.

1950
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:24,207
Will you forget me?

1951
01:33:25,025 --> 01:33:26,754
The minute I die.

1952
01:33:37,941 --> 01:33:39,559
I'm serious.
I don't know when.

1953
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:42,307
Your own divorce and
you don't know when?

1954
01:33:42,501 --> 01:33:45,080
I can get it tomorrow if
I want to cave in to her lawyers.

1955
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,208
Otherwise,
it's gonna take months.

1956
01:33:47,282 --> 01:33:48,701
Months?

1957
01:33:48,961 --> 01:33:50,621
At least.

1958
01:33:52,328 --> 01:33:53,825
And then?

1959
01:33:54,941 --> 01:33:56,832
It'll be over.
I'll be free.

1960
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,308
Mmm.

1961
01:33:59,154 --> 01:34:01,408
Just about the time
I could be.

1962
01:34:02,725 --> 01:34:03,782
Yeah.

1963
01:34:03,842 --> 01:34:04,942
Careful, Victor.

1964
01:34:04,994 --> 01:34:07,542
Don't let your enthusiasm
run away with you.

1965
01:34:07,891 --> 01:34:10,701
Karen, we don't want
to rush into anything.

1966
01:34:10,781 --> 01:34:12,887
Not a second time,
certainly.

1967
01:34:13,441 --> 01:34:16,210
Don't panic, Victor,
i have no demands.

1968
01:34:18,045 --> 01:34:21,341
We helped each other
through a bad time.

1969
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:24,003
Can I still see you?

1970
01:34:24,218 --> 01:34:25,741
I don't think so, Victor.

1971
01:34:25,821 --> 01:34:27,102
Why not?

1972
01:34:27,553 --> 01:34:29,321
Your fly is open.

1973
01:34:29,809 --> 01:34:31,310
Not now.

1974
01:34:31,537 --> 01:34:33,539
Just most of the time.

1975
01:34:44,427 --> 01:34:46,429
You going to Sao Paulo?

1976
01:34:46,516 --> 01:34:47,933
I guess.

1977
01:34:48,304 --> 01:34:50,305
I'm going to Bahia.

1978
01:34:50,487 --> 01:34:52,173
It figures.

1979
01:34:52,464 --> 01:34:54,798
My hotel room's paid for the month.

1980
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:56,431
Right.

1981
01:34:56,991 --> 01:34:58,498
What's Victor up to?

1982
01:34:58,572 --> 01:35:00,294
He's packing.

1983
01:35:00,397 --> 01:35:02,048
Mm-hmm.

1984
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:06,227
Have you got room
in your bag for these?

1985
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:09,393
Don't you want them in Bahia?

1986
01:35:09,445 --> 01:35:11,147
They're going to Bahia.

1987
01:35:12,555 --> 01:35:13,879
I don't understand.

1988
01:35:13,997 --> 01:35:15,952
You're going to Bahia.

1989
01:35:20,229 --> 01:35:22,192
We've got a lot
to talk about, Matthew.

1990
01:35:22,265 --> 01:35:23,606
Do you want to talk?

1991
01:35:23,663 --> 01:35:25,792
You think I want
to throw 20 years away

1992
01:35:25,852 --> 01:35:27,986
just because of
your foolishness?

1993
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,709
Or mine?

1994
01:35:30,156 --> 01:35:31,176
Karen...

1995
01:35:31,224 --> 01:35:33,903
It's going to be
a long haul, Matthew.

1996
01:35:33,947 --> 01:35:36,530
There's an awful lot
for both of us to forget.

1997
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:38,530
Let alone forgive.

1998
01:35:38,881 --> 01:35:39,984
Mm-hmm.

1999
01:35:40,072 --> 01:35:42,470
No more "mmms," Matthew.

2000
01:35:42,549 --> 01:35:44,550
I want you to talk to me.

2001
01:35:44,616 --> 01:35:46,170
Reach down
in your feelings

2002
01:35:46,219 --> 01:35:47,884
and tell me what
you're thinking,

2003
01:35:47,967 --> 01:35:49,223
what you're afraid of.

2004
01:35:49,343 --> 01:35:52,090
I want you to stop
bottling it all up.

2005
01:35:52,164 --> 01:35:53,270
I'll do my best.

2006
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:56,536
I'll take your worst, too.
Just share with me.

2007
01:35:56,703 --> 01:35:58,160
I'll do my worst.

2008
01:36:02,609 --> 01:36:04,162
We better hurry.

2009
01:36:08,737 --> 01:36:11,246
Victor... wait.

2010
01:36:13,252 --> 01:36:15,009
Come on.

2011
01:36:16,302 --> 01:36:18,093
I'm so glad we got to stay.

2012
01:36:18,154 --> 01:36:20,656
Look, they're coming.
I'm gonna talk to my Mom.

2013
01:36:20,755 --> 01:36:22,071
What's happening?

2014
01:36:22,158 --> 01:36:23,691
We're leaving.

2015
01:36:23,939 --> 01:36:26,098
You and Mom,
as in together?

2016
01:36:26,225 --> 01:36:28,738
We'll be at club med
in Bahia.

2017
01:36:38,187 --> 01:36:39,914
Goodbye, Jennifer.

2018
01:36:40,142 --> 01:36:41,974
Goodbye, Uncle Matthew.

2019
01:36:49,028 --> 01:36:50,618
Nicky,...

2020
01:36:50,898 --> 01:36:52,101
um...

2021
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:54,074
I love you, too.

2022
01:36:58,197 --> 01:36:59,698
We've got a lot
to talk about.

2023
01:36:59,813 --> 01:37:01,314
I know.

2024
01:37:01,481 --> 01:37:03,817
I'm so glad you're leaving.

2025
01:37:03,954 --> 01:37:05,994
I'll see you back
in Sao Paulo.

2026
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,202
Goodbye, Uncle Victor.

2027
01:37:16,262 --> 01:37:17,989
Goodbye, Nick.
And uh...

2028
01:37:18,182 --> 01:37:20,122
thanks for whatever you did.

2029
01:37:20,246 --> 01:37:21,748
I didn't do anything.

2030
01:37:21,927 --> 01:37:23,765
Thank god
somebody didn't.

2031
01:37:28,321 --> 01:37:29,921
Goodbye, Aunt Karen.

2032
01:37:29,976 --> 01:37:32,381
Goodbye, Jennifer.
Take care of yourself.

2033
01:37:32,501 --> 01:37:35,161
Try not to play
with anything sharp.

2034
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,040
We gotta move.

2035
01:37:42,404 --> 01:37:43,557
What's that?

2036
01:37:43,677 --> 01:37:45,417
- Sunglasses.
- The other thing.

2037
01:37:45,468 --> 01:37:47,877
Uh, I... I don't know.

2038
01:37:48,023 --> 01:37:49,370
Nothing.

2039
01:37:49,472 --> 01:37:52,119
And I've heard
all I want out of you.

2040
01:37:53,446 --> 01:37:54,879
Go.

2041
01:37:56,148 --> 01:37:58,283
Terrific.
I wind up being your driver.

2042
01:37:58,411 --> 01:38:00,647
I hope you're better at that
than being a friend.

2043
01:38:00,701 --> 01:38:01,707
You're kidding.

2044
01:38:01,761 --> 01:38:04,241
After what you've done, I don't know
how you can look me in the face.

2045
01:38:04,286 --> 01:38:05,380
Which one, Victor?

2046
01:38:05,411 --> 01:38:06,981
Which face did you
have in mind?

2047
01:38:07,056 --> 01:38:10,155
It's hard to realize, a whole year
has gone by since then.

2048
01:38:10,393 --> 01:38:12,442
Victor finally got his divorce.

2049
01:38:12,662 --> 01:38:14,295
Then he and his wife
turned around

2050
01:38:14,328 --> 01:38:16,028
and married each other again.

2051
01:38:16,264 --> 01:38:18,551
Victor said it's because
she wanted to get the other half

2052
01:38:18,597 --> 01:38:20,517
of everything he owned.

2053
01:38:20,971 --> 01:38:22,011
With Karen and me,

2054
01:38:22,051 --> 01:38:24,553
it wasn't really a case
of happily ever after.

2055
01:38:25,124 --> 01:38:28,067
We were lucky to get
any kind of ever after at all.

2056
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:29,874
I figure...

2057
01:38:30,147 --> 01:38:32,387
we're a few months
away from happily.

2058
01:38:32,565 --> 01:38:33,848
But we'll make it.

2059
01:38:33,915 --> 01:38:35,034
You only live once,

2060
01:38:35,078 --> 01:38:37,579
but it does help if
you get to be young twice.
