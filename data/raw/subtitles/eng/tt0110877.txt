1
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, there's no water, Dad.

2
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's all gone,
since this morning.

3
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I wanted to rinse
my hands, too.

4
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
All gone.

5
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is it stllI warm?

6
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've got the sniffIes
this morning!

7
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It must have been the dampness
on the boat.

8
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I onIy have to set foot
on that boat--

9
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Perhaps I'm allergic.

10
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Even if the boat's not moving,
the dampness gets to me.

11
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know how you can
stay on it all night...

12
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and not catch a thing.

13
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The minute I get on--

14
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've received a postcard
from America, Dad...

15
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
from Gaetano and AIfredo.

16
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is America
around the outside...

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and this is an American car.

18
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They say they're
going to buy one, too.

19
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's written here:
''We're buying one.''

20
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But I think they're joking...

21
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
because they cost
a Ioad of money.

22
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But they say
it's a rich country...

23
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
where there's work, a country--

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And we're stllI here...

25
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
without water...

26
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
whlle they're--

27
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Forget it, never mind.

28
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Listen, Mario,
you've never llke fishing.

29
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I've caught a chllI.

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go to America or Japan
if you want to...

31
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
but get yourseIf a job.

32
00:04:44,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're not a kid anymore.

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
''The poet, PabIo Neruda, in Rome.''

34
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
CentraI Station.

35
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
A group of rowdy peopIe
has inconvenienced the travellers...

36
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
who crowd the station pIatforms
every day.

37
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
These protesters...

38
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
are not drunkards...

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
nor the usuaI hotheads
who protest just for the fun of it.

40
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They are a group of intellectuaIs,
writers and journallsts.

41
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why have they joined
together, shouting...

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
disturbing the pollce
and Carabinieri?

43
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The mystery is reveaIed
when the train arrives.

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
PabIo Neruda gets out
at Rome station...

45
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the Chllean poet known throughout
the worId for his poetry...

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and his communist ideas which
have often got him into troubIe...

47
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and for which
he has now been exlled.

48
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The poet appears to be
well-Ioved in ItaIy...

49
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and, judging by the enthusiastic
embrace of this woman...

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
not onIy for his moraI gifts.

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Women go crazy for his poetry...

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
maybe because Neruda
writes Iove poems...

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
a topic which appeaIs
to the femaIe sensibllity.

54
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But Iet's go back
to our noisy crowd.

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The Home Office
has accepted their protest...

56
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
by suspending the measures
against Neruda...

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
requested by
the Chllean government.

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The poet wllI remain
in ItaIy...

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
on a wonderfuI isIand.

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He wllI not be abIe to Ieave
without pollce authority...

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but the isIand's beauty
wllI make exlle easier.

62
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's me!

63
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The poet wllI have happy memories
of ItaIy and her government...

64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
which is hosting him in a pIace
which wllI remind him of home.

65
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This cozy house
surrounded by nature...

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:32,000
wllI certainIy make him
feeI at home.

67
00:07:32,000 --> 00:08:00,000
''Wanted: Temporary Postman
with BicycIe''

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You, Anita Scotto,
are the sender.

69
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is your son's name, right?

70
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I've come about the job.

71
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right, wait.
And this is the city.

72
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you sending him capers?

73
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He'll be pIeased.

74
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you llllterate?

75
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
No, I can read and write.

76
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Not very fast, but--

77
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Sit down.

78
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I need someone to dellver mall
to CaIa di Sotto.

79
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's great.
I llve there.

80
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There's onIy one addressee.

81
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
OnIy one?

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Everyone eIse there is llllterate.

83
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm not llllterate, but stllI--

84
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, then.

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's all mall
for signor PabIo Neruda.

86
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The poet Ioved by women?

87
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The poet Ioved by the peopIe!

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
By the peopIe, but aIso by women.

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I heard it on the newsreeI.

90
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
All right, but most of all
by the peopIe. He's a communist.

91
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right?

92
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The poet has received a mountain
of mall these Iast two days.

93
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Pedalling with the bag is llke
carrying an eIephant on your back.

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll wait here.

95
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll be right with you.

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The wage is a pittance, you know.

97
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Postmen make do with their tips.

98
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But with onIy one house...

99
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
at most it'll pay for
your cinema once a week.

100
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
- That's fine.
- It suits you anyway.

101
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
My name's Giorgio.

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm your superior,
and you shouId call me sir.

103
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But I won't hoId you to it,
because I'm a communist, too.

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And remember...

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
the poet...

106
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is a great and kind person.

107
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He deserves respect.

108
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You say hello, you thank him.

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If he tips you,
you thank him again.

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
- Right?
- Yes, right.

111
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is your hat.

112
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is your bag.

113
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Today's the 15th.
Your first payday's the 27th.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
When do you start?

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Monday morning.
6:45, I open the shutters.

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Then the publlc comes Iater.

117
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Are you in uniform aIready?

118
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No, I'm just wearing the hat.

119
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That way it'll
take its shape better...

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
or I'll get a headache
wearing it all day.

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The boss toId me
it's a postman's trick.

122
00:11:12,000 --> 00:12:05,000
A llttIe trick of ours.

123
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Good morning.

124
00:12:08,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Your mall.

125
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Thank you.

126
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Another one from a femaIe.

127
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
FemaIe.

128
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Maria Conchita, femaIe.

129
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
AngeIa, femaIe.

130
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Jean Marie, is that
maIe or femaIe?

131
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
- FemaIe!
- I knew it!

132
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This one, too.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Even the women are interested
in polltics in Chlle!

134
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I know, but all femaIes--

135
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How come?

136
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Listen...

137
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
but what's Don PabIo...

138
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
llke?

139
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
- Is he normaI?
- As a person, as--

140
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
NormaI. Of course,
he taIks differentIy.

141
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You can tell immediateIy from--

142
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Know what he calls his wife?
''Amor''!

143
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Even if he's standing far away...

144
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
they call each other ''amor.''

145
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
- Really?
- He's a poet.

146
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's how you can tell.

147
00:14:34,000 --> 00:15:12,000
FemaIe.

148
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Excuse me...

149
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
if you happen to need anything...

150
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
mllk, bread, I can--

151
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No, thank you.

152
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Matllde goes shopping every day.

153
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If ever she doesn't want to go out,
you can ask me. I come and go.

154
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We don't need anything.
Thanks anyway.

155
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I mean, if by any chance--

156
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And remember, Mario...

157
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
you mustn't bother him
with a Iot of questions.

158
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's forbidden to annoy customers
with strange requests.

159
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I know, I won't annoy him.

160
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll onIy ask him
to sign this book, that's all.

161
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So when I get paid,
I'll go to NapIes...

162
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and show all the girIs...

163
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
that I'm a friend of Neruda,
the poet of Iove!

164
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The poet of the peopIe!

165
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Excuse me, couId you sign it?

166
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:47,000
PIease, couId you sign it?

167
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
WouId you make
it unique, maestro?

168
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:10,000
WouId you make
it unique, maestro?

169
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
My name's Mario Ruoppolo.

170
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:31,000
- And my mall?
- There isn't any.

171
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Come on, Mario, you shouId be happy.

172
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Happy?

173
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I toId him quite cIearIy,
Mario RuoppoIo.

174
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
''Regards, PabIo Neruda.''

175
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It means nothing.

176
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You don't think he can cross
it out and write it better...

177
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
so you can see it's for me,
that we're friends?

178
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you think he'd cross it out
because you don't llke it...

179
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and write you another?

180
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Perhaps he did it on purpose
because you bothered him.

181
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No, I asked him.
He was staring at the mountain.

182
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
- ExactIy, you see?
- No, I know the mountain...

183
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
but he was hoIding an onion.

184
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So you think a poet can't think
when he's hoIding an onion, eh?

185
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
When am I supposed
to ask him then...

186
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
if I can't ask him
when he's peellng an onion?

187
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He's a busy man.

188
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He can't be running after peopIe
to make them happy.

189
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes, but he's a communist.

190
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So what?

191
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Didn't you say that
communists Iove the peopIe?

192
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Mario, don't make me annoyed!

193
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I bought a copy of the book.

194
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
When you have the chance...

195
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
with extreme tact...

196
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
ask him if he wouId sign it for me.

197
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Sign it?

198
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Take this one then.
''Regards, PabIo Neruda.''

199
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, this is yours.
He signed it for you.

200
00:19:21,000 --> 00:20:02,000
- I'm happy to Iet you have it.
- No!

201
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Mr. Di Cosimo, shall
I empty all the water?

202
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
All of it, all of it.

203
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
'Morning.

204
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Mr. Di Cosimo...

205
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
what can I do to thank you?
Your wreath was the nicest.

206
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Nothing, Donna Rosa.
Just vote and get others to vote.

207
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Remember to use
that llttIe pencll of yours.

208
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And hopefully some
of your customers wllI, too.

209
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
''...happens that I go into the
tallors' shops and the movies...

210
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
all shriveIed up...

211
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
impenetrabIe, llke a feIt swan...

212
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
navigating on a water
of origin and ash.

213
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The smell of barber shops
makes me sob out Ioud...

214
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I am tired of being a man...''

215
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Mall.

216
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What's the matter?

217
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Don PabIo?

218
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You're standing
as stiff as a post!

219
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Nalled llke a spear?

220
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No, immoblle llke the castIe
on a chess board.

221
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
StllIer than a porceIain cat.

222
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
EIementary Odes isn't
the onIy book I've written.

223
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I've written much better.

224
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's unfair of you to shower me
with simlles and metaphors.

225
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Don PabIo?

226
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Metaphors.

227
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What are those?

228
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Metaphors?

229
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Metaphors are--
How can I expIain?

230
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
When you taIk of something,
comparing it to another.

231
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Is it something...

232
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
you use in poetry?

233
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes, that too.

234
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
For exampIe?

235
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
For exampIe...

236
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
when you say, ''the sky weeps,''
what do you mean?

237
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That it's raining.

238
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes, very good.

239
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
- That's a metaphor.
- It's easy then!

240
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Why has it got such
a compllcated name?

241
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Man has no business with...

242
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
the simpllcity
or compIexity of things.

243
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Excuse me, Don PabIo,
then I'll go.

244
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I was reading something
yesterday:

245
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
''The smell of barber shops
makes me sob out Ioud.''

246
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is that a metaphor, too?

247
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
No...

248
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
not exactIy.

249
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I llked it, too, when...

250
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
when you wrote:

251
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
''I am tired of being a man.''

252
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's happened to me, too...

253
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
but I never knew how to say it.

254
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I really llked it when I read it.

255
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Why ''the smell of
barber shops makes me sob''?

256
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You see, Mario...

257
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I can't tell you...

258
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
in words different
from those I've used.

259
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
When you expIain it,
poetry becomes banaI.

260
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Better than any expIanation...

261
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
is the experience of feellngs
that poetry can reveaI...

262
00:24:28,000 --> 00:25:23,000
to a nature open enough
to understand it.

263
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
WllI you open this, pIease?

264
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
- Who, me?
- Yes.

265
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
- Shall I open it?
- Yes!

266
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:46,000
My hands are dirty.

267
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's written in--

268
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's foreign.

269
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Is it more important
than the others?

270
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes, it's from Sweden.

271
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What's so speciaI about Sweden?

272
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The NobeI Prize for Literature.

273
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
A prize then?

274
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
If they give it to me,
I won't refuse.

275
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Why?

276
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
How much money is it?

277
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
171,135 Swedish krona.

278
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I've no idea, is that a Iot?

279
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Lots and Iots!

280
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Then you'll get it.

281
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
There are candidates with
a better chance than me this year.

282
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Why?

283
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Because they've
written important works.

284
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
No...

285
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
you'll get it, I'm sure.

286
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Thank you.

287
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Shall I open the other Ietters?

288
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
No, I'll read them Iater.

289
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Are they Iove Ietters?

290
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What a question!
Don't Iet Matllde hear you.

291
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm sorry, Don PabIo.
I onIy meant--

292
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'd llke to be a poet, too.

293
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
No, it's more originaI
being a postman.

294
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You get to waIk a Iot
and don't get fat.

295
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We poets are all fat.

296
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yes, but...

297
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
with poetry...

298
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I couId make women fall for me.

299
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
How--

300
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
How do you become a poet?

301
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Try and waIk sIowIy aIong
the shore as far as the bay...

302
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and Iook around you.

303
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And wllI they come to me,
these metaphors?

304
00:27:51,000 --> 00:29:13,000
CertainIy.

305
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Mario, can you send someone to see
about this probIem of water?

306
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Have you got water?

307
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
No, that's exactIy the probIem.

308
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That's no probIem at all!

309
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Why? Is it normaI?

310
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's normaI.

311
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You've run out of water...

312
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
up at the cistern.

313
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Do you use a Iot of water?

314
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
No, just what I need.

315
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Then that's too much.

316
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Because...

317
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
it runs out all of a sudden
because the water-suppIy ship...

318
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
comes onIy once a month,
so the water gets used up.

319
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
We've got-- They've been saying
we'll get running water...

320
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
for ages.

321
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
''You'll have running water.'' But--

322
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And you don't protest?

323
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
What do we say?

324
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
My father swears every so often...

325
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
but... onIy to himseIf.

326
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
There are peopIe who, with a strong
wllI, manage to change things.

327
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's a pity.

328
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
This pIace is so beautifuI!

329
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Think so?

330
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yes. Sit down.

331
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Here on the isIand, the sea...

332
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
so much sea.

333
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It spllIs over from time to time.

334
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It says yes, then no...

335
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
then no.

336
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
In bIue, in foam, in a gallop...

337
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
it says no, then no.

338
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It cannot be stllI.
My name is sea, it repeats...

339
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
striking a stone
but not convincing it.

340
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Then with the seven green tongues
of seven green tigers...

341
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
of seven green seas...

342
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it caresses it, kisses it, wets it...

343
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and pounds on its chest,
repeating its own name.

344
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Well?

345
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
What do you think?

346
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's weird.

347
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
What do you mean, weird?

348
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
- You're a severe critic.
- No, not your poem.

349
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Weird...

350
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Weird...

351
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
how I feIt whlle
you were saying it.

352
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
How was that?

353
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I don't know.

354
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The words went back and forth.

355
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
- Like the sea then?
- ExactIy.

356
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
- Like the sea.
- There, that's the rhythm.

357
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I feIt seasick, in fact.

358
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Because...

359
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I can't expIain it. I feIt llke...

360
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
llke a boat tossing
around on those words.

361
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Like a boat tossing
around on my words?

362
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Do you know what you've done, Mario?

363
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
- No, what?
- You've invented a metaphor.

364
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
- Yes, you have!
- Really?

365
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But it doesn't count
because I didn't mean to.

366
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Meaning to is not important.

367
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Images arise spontaneousIy.

368
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You mean then that...

369
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
for exampIe,
I don't know if you follow me...

370
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
that the whoIe worId...

371
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
the whoIe worId,
with the sea, the sky...

372
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
with the rain, the cIouds--

373
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Now you can say etc., etc.

374
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Etc., etc.

375
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The whoIe worId is
the metaphor for something eIse?

376
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
- I'm taIking crap.
- No, not at all.

377
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Not at all.

378
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You pulled a strange face.

379
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Mario, Iet's make a pact.

380
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'll have a nice swim...

381
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and ponder your question.

382
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Then I'll give you
an answer tomorrow.

383
00:33:34,000 --> 00:35:59,000
- Really?
- Yes, really.

384
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Don PabIo, good morning.

385
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I've got to taIk to you.

386
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It must be very important.
You're snorting llke a horse.

387
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's very important.

388
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
- I've fallen in Iove.
- Nothing serious. There's a remedy.

389
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
No, no remedy!

390
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I don't want a remedy.
I want to stay sick.

391
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm in Iove,
really, really in Iove.

392
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Who are you in Iove with?

393
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Her name's Beatrice.

394
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Dante.

395
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Dante Allghieri.

396
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
He fell for a certain Beatrice.

397
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Beatrices have
inspired boundIess Iove.

398
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
What are you doing?

399
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Writing down the name Dante.

400
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Dante I know, but Allghieri--

401
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
- Has it got an ''h'' in it?
- Wait, I'll write it for you.

402
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Thank you.

403
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm madIy in Iove.

404
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You've aIready toId me that,
but what can I do about it?

405
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I don't know, if you can heIp--

406
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But I'm an oId man.

407
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I don't know, because...

408
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I suddenIy saw her in front of me.

409
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I stared at her,
but I couIdn't utter a word.

410
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
What, you didn't
say anything to her?

411
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Not much.

412
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
- I watched her and fell in Iove.
- Just llke that? In a fIash?

413
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
No, I stared at her
for ten minutes first.

414
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And she?

415
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And she said...

416
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:14,000
What's up,
never seen a woman before?

417
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
What's your name?

418
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Beatrice Russo.

419
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And you?

420
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I couIdn't think of anything to say.

421
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Nothing at all?

422
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
- You didn't say a word?
- Not exactIy nothing.

423
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I said five words to her.

424
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Which were?

425
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I said, ''What's your name?''

426
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
- And she?
- And she: ''Beatrice Russo.''

427
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
''What's your name?'' are three words.
And the other two?

428
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Then I repeated Beatrice Russo.

429
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Don PabIo, if--

430
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't want to bother you, but...

431
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:35,000
can you write me
a poem for Beatrice?

432
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I don't even know her!

433
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
A poet needs to know
the object of his inspiration!

434
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I can't invent something
out of nothing.

435
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I've got this llttIe ball...

436
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
which Beatrice put in her mouth.
She's touched it.

437
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So what?

438
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It might heIp you.

439
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Look, Poet...

440
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
if you make all this fuss
over one poem...

441
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
you're never going
to win that NobeI Prize!

442
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Mario, pinch me and wake me
from this nightmare!

443
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
What am I supposed to do?

444
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
No one eIse can heIp me.
They're all fishermen here!

445
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
What am I supposed to do?

446
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Fishermen fall in Iove, too!

447
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
They are abIe to taIk
to the girIs they Iove...

448
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
to make them fall in Iove, too,
and marry them.

449
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
- What does your father do?
- He's a fisherman.

450
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Naturally!

451
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
He must have spoken to your mother
to get her to marry him.

452
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I don't think so.
He doesn't taIk much.

453
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Come on, give me my mall.

454
00:41:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Thank you, but I don't want it.

455
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
- Do you want something eIse?
- No, thanks.

456
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Beatrice, your smlle
spreads llke a butterfIy.

457
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Fallen out of bed this morning?

458
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I came earller because...

459
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I saw this.
It Iooks important.

460
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You're right, it is important.

461
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And then...

462
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
there's something eIse...

463
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I've been meaning to give you
but kept forgetting.

464
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
- I'll put it here. Good-bye.
- Wait a minute.

465
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I've got something for you, too.

466
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Here.

467
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It might be usefuI
for your metaphors.

468
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Is it a radio?

469
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
No, but it's a kind of radio.

470
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You speak into here...

471
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and this repeats what you say.

472
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You speak into it
and it repeats what you say?

473
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yes.

474
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
- How many times?
- As many times as you want.

475
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But you mustn't exaggerate.

476
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Even the most subllme idea
seems foollsh if heard too often.

477
00:44:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Listen.

478
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Good news?

479
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
When I was Senator
of the Republlc...

480
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I went to visit Pampa...

481
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
a region where it onIy rains
once every 50 years...

482
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
where llfe
is unimaginabIy hard.

483
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I wanted to meet the peopIe
who had voted for me.

484
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
One day...

485
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
at Lota, there was a man
who had come up from a coaI mine.

486
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
He was a mask
of coaI dust and sweat...

487
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
his face...

488
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
contorted by terribIe hardship...

489
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
his eyes red from the dust.

490
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
He stretched out
his calloused hand and said:

491
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
''Wherever you go...

492
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
speak of this torment.

493
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Speak of your brother
who llves underground...

494
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
in hell.''

495
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I feIt I had to write something
to heIp man in his struggIe...

496
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
to write the poetry
of the mistreated.

497
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That's how ''Canto GeneraI''
came about.

498
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Now my comrades...

499
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
tell me they have managed to
get it publlshed secretIy in Chlle...

500
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and it's selling llke hot cakes.

501
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That makes me very happy.

502
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
My dear comrades...

503
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
...I have recently listened to your recording
and it has made very happy.

504
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I was very pleased to have a book published in Chile.

505
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Now I want you to listen
to a man who has become...

506
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:24,000
...my dearest friend here - Mario Ruoppolo.

507
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I told them I'm here with
a friend who wishes to say hello.

508
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And tell them something nice
about this beautifuI country.

509
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yes.

510
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,000
- Good morning.
- No, in there.

511
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Something nice about the isIand?

512
00:47:45,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yes, one of the wonders
of your isIand.

513
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Now Iet's go to the inn...

514
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
and meet this famous
Beatrice Russo.

515
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Are you joking?

516
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
No, I'm serious.

517
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Let's have a Iook at this girIfriend.

518
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Mamma mia!

519
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
PabIo Neruda and Mario RuoppoIo
at the inn.

520
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
She'll faint!

521
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Well? What is it now?

522
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Don PabIo, when I get married
to Beatrice Russo...

523
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
wllI you be my best man?

524
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Listen...

525
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:57,000
first Iet's have a drink,
then we'll decide.

526
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Gennarino, wait! I'm coming, too!

527
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Domenico, come here
or I'll thrash you!

528
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Look who's here. Neruda!

529
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Good morning.

530
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What wllI it be?

531
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
A gIass of red wine, pIease.

532
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And the pinball king?

533
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
- Do you want red wine, too?
- Red wine, yes.

534
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Two gIasses of red wine
and a pen to write with.

535
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:02,000
He's here for your niece.

536
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Give me the notebook.

537
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Notebook? Why?

538
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Just a moment.

539
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:50,000
''To Mario, my intimate friend
and comrade - PabIo Neruda''

540
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
There you are.

541
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You aIready have your poetry.

542
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
If you want to write it down,
here's your notebook.

543
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Thank you.

544
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:48,000
What is it?

545
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Go home. It's cIosing time!

546
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I won't make you pay for the bottIe,
but go home. We're cIosing.

547
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinking.

548
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
With the window open?

549
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Yes, with the window open.

550
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Be honest with me.
What did he tell you?

551
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Metaphors.

552
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Metaphors?

553
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Never heard such big words
from you before.

554
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
What metaphors did he do to you?

555
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Did? He said them!

556
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
He said my smlle spreads
across my face llke a butterfIy.

557
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
- And then?
- I Iaughed when he said that.

558
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Your Iaugh is a rose...

559
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
a spear unearthed, crashing water.

560
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Your Iaugh is
a sudden sllvery wave.

561
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Then what did you do?

562
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I kept quiet.

563
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And he?

564
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
- What eIse did he say?
- No, what did he do?

565
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Your postman, as well as a mouth,
has two hands!

566
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
He never touched me.

567
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
He said he was happy
to be next to a pure young woman.

568
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Like being on the shores
of the white ocean.

569
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I llke it--

570
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I llke it when you're sllent...

571
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
because it's as though
you're absent.

572
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And you?

573
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And he?

574
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
He Iooked at me, too,
then he stopped Iooking at my eyes...

575
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
and began to Iook at my hair...

576
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
without a word,
as though he were thinking.

577
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Enough, my chlld!

578
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
When a man starts
to touch you with words...

579
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
he's not far off with his hands.

580
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
There's nothing wrong with words.

581
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Words are the worst things ever.

582
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I'd prefer a drunkard
at the bar touching your bum...

583
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
to someone who says,
''Your smlle flles llke a butterfIy''!

584
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It ''spreads'' llke a butterfIy!

585
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Flles, spreads,
it's the same thing!

586
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Just Iook at you!

587
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
One stroke of his finger,
and you're on your back.

588
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
You're wrong.
He's a decent person.

589
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
When it comes to bed,
there's no difference...

590
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000
between a poet, a priest
or even a communist!

591
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
''Naked...

592
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
you are as simpIe
as one of your hands...

593
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
smooth, terrestriaI, tiny...

594
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
round, transparent.

595
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
You have moon-llnes, appIe paths.

596
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Naked, you are as thin
as bare wheat.

597
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Naked, you are bIue
llke a Cuban night.

598
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
There are vines and stars
in your hair.

599
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Naked, you are enormous
and yellow...

600
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:21,000
llke summer in a gllded church.''

601
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Good morning, Father.

602
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I found this in her brassiere.

603
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I want you to read it to me.

604
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I'm not Ietting her
out of the house for now.

605
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Well?

606
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It's a poem.

607
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Read it to me!

608
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
''Naked...

609
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Madonna!

610
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
What are the nets llke?
Mario, I need an adjective.

611
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Nets-- Which nets?
Fishing nets?

612
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yes.

613
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Sad.

614
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Sad.

615
00:56:32,000 --> 00:58:20,000
All right?

616
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Good morning, signora.

617
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
- WouId you llke--
- Yes.

618
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
PIease, sit down.

619
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
No. What I want to say is
too serious to say sitting down.

620
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
What is it about?

621
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
For over a month...

622
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Mario RuoppoIo has been
hanging around my inn...

623
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
and he has seduced my niece.

624
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
- What did he say?
- Metaphors.

625
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Well?

626
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
He's heated her up
llke an oven with his metaphors.

627
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
A man whose onIy capitaI
is the fungus between his toes!

628
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And if his feet are full of germs,
his mouth is full of spells.

629
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
It started off innocentIy enough:
''Her smlle was llke a butterfIy.''

630
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:31,000
But now he's saying her breast
is llke a fire with two fIames.

631
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
But do you think...

632
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
that these images are onIy
his imagination or that--

633
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yes, I think he's had
his hands on her.

634
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Read this.
It was in her brassiere.

635
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
''Naked--

636
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
As beautifuI as--

637
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Naked, you're as dellcate
as nights on an isIand...

638
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
and stars in your hair--''

639
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's beautifuI!

640
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So he's seen my niece naked!

641
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
No, signora Rosa!

642
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Nothing in this poem
Ieads us to think that.

643
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The poem's telling the truth.

644
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
My niece naked is just
as the poem describes her.

645
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
So do me a favor
and tell Mario RuoppoIo...

646
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
who's Iearnt a Iot from you...

647
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:47,000
that he must never see my niece
again for the rest of his llfe.

648
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And tell him that if he does,
I'll shoot him.

649
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
- Is that cIear?
- Yes.

650
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Good day.

651
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You're as white as a sack of fIour.

652
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I might be white outside,
but inside I'm red.

653
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You won't save yourseIf
from the widow's fury with adjectives.

654
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
If she harms me, she'll go to jall.

655
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
She'll be out in a coupIe of hours.

656
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
She'll say she acted
out of seIf-defense.

657
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
She'll say you threatened
the virginity of her damseI:

658
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
with a metaphor
hissing llke a dagger...

659
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
as sharp as a canine,
as Iacerating as a hymen.

660
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
The poetry wllI have Ieft
the mark of its seditious sallva...

661
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
on the virgin's nippIes.

662
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
The poet Francois VllIon
was hung from a tree for much Iess...

663
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
and his bIood gushed
from his neck llke roses.

664
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I don't care. She can do
what she wants. I'm ready.

665
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Good Iad! It's a reaI shame
we haven't got...

666
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:25,000
a trio of guitarists to go...

667
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
My dear poet and comrade...

668
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
you got me into this mess,
you've got to get me out of it.

669
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You gave me books to read...

670
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
you taught me to use my tongue
for more than llcking stamps.

671
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
It's your fauIt if I'm in Iove.

672
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
No, this has nothing to do with me.

673
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I gave you my books...

674
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
but I didn't authorize you
to steaI my poems.

675
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
If you think you gave Beatrice
the poem I wrote for Matllde--

676
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Poetry doesn't beIong to those
who write it, but those who need it.

677
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I appreciate that highIy
democratic sentiment.

678
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Now go home and get some sIeep.

679
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:27,000
You've bags under your eyes
as Iarge and deep as soup bowIs.

680
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
This is for you.
Vote for Di Cosimo.

681
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
They promised us running water...

682
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
on the isIand two years ago, too.

683
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Two years ago, it wasn't
Di Cosimo who promised you.

684
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
What's written on that paper
is a pIedge, not a promise.

685
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:49,000
An oath, and God is my witness.

686
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Hey, Mario!

687
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Aren't you interested
in what I'm saying?

688
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I'm voting communist.

689
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
What?

690
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I'm voting communist.

691
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I hear you've
gone crazy about poetry.

692
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I hear you're competing
with PabIo Neruda.

693
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:21,000
But remember, poets can do
a Iot of damage to peopIe.

694
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
- How much do these cIams cost?
- 300 llre to you.

695
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
For that price you'll have to
guarantee me a pearI in each one.

696
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,000
- Give me a good price.
- I'll give you a discount, all right?

697
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Fishermen are expIoited
enough as it is.

698
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
He said 300 llre.
Why shouId he give you a discount?

699
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I don't mean to expIoit anyone.
Good-bye.

700
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Why don't you mind
your own business?

701
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I was trying to heIp.

702
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Mario...

703
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
as your superior I must order you
to dellver the undellvered mall.

704
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yes, yes, yes.

705
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
But you're stllI
moping after that girI.

706
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Beatrice is pretty now...

707
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
but in 50 years
she'll be as ugIy as the rest.

708
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Beatrice wllI never be ugIy.

709
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I heId the spIendor of your eyes...

710
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,000
secretIy within me,
bllssfuI Beatrice.

711
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
What's Beatrice got to do with it?

712
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It's a poem.

713
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Dante Allghieri--

714
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
No, GabrieIe D'Annunzio, my poet.

715
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Your poet wrote something
for Beatrice?

716
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I don't llke it.

717
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Strange, I thought you'd
appreciate a hymn to Beatrice.

718
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Thank you. Good-bye.

719
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
- SIeeping Beauty...
- Good evening.

720
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Good evening. Give the MarshaI
his usuaI, and pour one for me, too.

721
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Thank you.

722
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Your niece gets
more and more beautifuI.

723
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
If you onIy knew how difficuIt
it is to keep a hoId on her.

724
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Young peopIe today
aren't what they used to be.

725
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
They have everything
and want the moon.

726
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I remember my poor departed mother.
I'd trembIe whenever she spoke.

727
01:06:59,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Good night, Aunt.
Good night, MarshaI.

728
01:08:21,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Good night, MarshaI.

729
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Find yourseIves a decent person
who isn't a communist.

730
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
If Neruda doesn't belleve in God,
why shouId God belleve in Neruda?

731
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
What sort of witness wouId he be?

732
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:42,000
God never said a communist
can't be a witness at a wedding.

733
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I'm not getting married then.

734
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
You're more interested in Neruda
as a witness than me as your wife.

735
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
My darllng...

736
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Neruda's a Cathollc.

737
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I know he's a Cathollc.

738
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
In Russia, communists eat babies.
How can he be Cathollc?

739
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
He doesn't Iook the type.

740
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Neruda has a pretty wife.

741
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
He's getting on
and he has no chlldren.

742
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
How do you expIain that?

743
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
So according to you,
Don PabIo ate his kids?

744
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Who knows?

745
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Anyway, my answer's no,
for your sake, too.

746
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,000
He inspired your bridegroom
to write that fllthy naked stuff.

747
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
That was onIy a poem.

748
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Not to mention the rest.

749
01:10:40,000 --> 01:11:24,000
He's not worthy of being witness
to your happiness.

750
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
She'd say:

751
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
''I ask Jesus to Iet me llve
to see my son with a job...

752
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
a wife and chlldren in his arms.''

753
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
UnfortunateIy, she didn't make it...

754
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
because when the Lord
called her to Him...

755
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
he didn't even have a job.

756
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Today, from heaven my poor wife
wllI see that he's made her happy...

757
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
because at Ieast he's got
a wife and a llttIe job.

758
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Even if it's not the job
she'd have wanted for him--

759
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:11,000
All the best!
Well done, Dad!

760
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,000
What are you doing, drinking wine?

761
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I'm sorry, Comrade, I forgot.
This came for you.

762
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Thank you.

763
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:57,000
- Good news?
- To the newIyweds!

764
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
With a chaste heart...

765
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
with pure eyes...

766
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I ceIebrate your beauty...

767
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
hoIding the Ieash of bIood
so that it might Ieap out...

768
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and trace your outllne...

769
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,000
where you lle down in my ode
as in a Iand of forests, or in a surf:

770
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:25,000
in aromatic Ioam or in sea music.

771
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Now...

772
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I'd llke to toast my friend...

773
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Mario...

774
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
and say what a pIeasure it was for me
to participate, in a small way...

775
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,000
to his happiness.

776
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And IastIy, I'd llke to say
that on this very speciaI day...

777
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I have received
some wonderfuI news.

778
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
The warrant for our arrest...

779
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
has been revoked...

780
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,000
and therefore
Matllde and I can now...

781
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
return to the country
we Iove so much:

782
01:14:11,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Chlle.

783
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
No, Don PabIo.

784
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
But you'll be unempIoyed tomorrow.

785
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:13,000
No, I don't want anything.

786
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I'll miss you.

787
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I'll miss you.

788
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
But you wllI write to me?

789
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Of course.

790
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Things change
all the time in my country.

791
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Today they'll Iet me go back.

792
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Tomorrow something eIse wllI happen
and I'll have to fIee again.

793
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I'll Ieave some things
here anyway...

794
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
if you couId keep
an eye on it for me.

795
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I'll Iet you know where to send them.

796
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Perhaps I'll bring them
to Chlle myseIf.

797
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:11,000
That'd be wonderfuI.

798
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Do you need this?

799
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Yes.

800
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Thank you.

801
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I've discovered another poet
who wrote about Beatrice...

802
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
called D'Annunzio.

803
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I know.

804
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So you couId have written one, too.

805
01:17:41,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Good-bye.

806
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
- What is it?
- Look at this.

807
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
He's in Russia, giving an award.

808
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
In Russia? If he's over here,
he might pay a visit.

809
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
He's a very busy man, Mario!

810
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
He must meet the peopIe
he didn't see when he was in exlle.

811
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And he's aIso well-Ioved in Chlle.

812
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
He won't have time to come here.

813
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
It's a good picture.

814
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
- The young poet, Mllovan--
- Perkovic.

815
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Awarded a poetry prize
by the maestro.

816
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
- Can I keep it?
- No, you can't.

817
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I'll put it in here
with all the rest.

818
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
You can Iook at it
whenever you llke.

819
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Vote for Di Cosimo.

820
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,000
The candidate promises
to Iead us on a new path!

821
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Vote for Di Cosimo!
For a new way of llfe!

822
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:24,000
For the sake of our isIand!

823
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Did that fellow come here?

824
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
- Who?
- Di Cosimo.

825
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Yes.

826
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Why are you smlling?

827
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Di Cosimo has served us
a fortune on a sllver pIatter.

828
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Really?

829
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
20 famllies wllI be coming here
to work on the new water mains.

830
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Di Cosimo asked us if we can
provide them with two meaIs a day.

831
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And we can't.

832
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,000
We toId them we couId.
They'll be here for two years.

833
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:05,000
- Without asking me?
- Just add it all up.

834
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Money.

835
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
All you can think about is money.

836
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Where wllI we put 20 famllies?

837
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
We'll do two or three servings
if necessary!

838
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
PIease yourseIves.

839
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
No, we'll do as we pIease.

840
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:26,000
WouId you be prepared to work
in the kitchen, ''signor'' husband?

841
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
In the kitchen?

842
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Yes.

843
01:21:37,000 --> 01:22:11,000
A toast to Beatrice,
the prettiest girI in town!

844
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Look!

845
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
- What does it say?
- He's in Paris.

846
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
''Whereas I really Ioved ItaIy...

847
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:29,000
where I Ied a happy llfe
in compIete solltude...

848
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:36,000
and among the most simpIe
peopIe in the worId.''

849
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
''What things are you
most nostaIgic about?''

850
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
''NostaIgia is an emotion I can feeI
onIy for my own country...

851
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
but I wllI never forget...

852
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
my strolls aIong the beach
and among the rocks...

853
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
where tiny pIants and fIowers grow...

854
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:05,000
exactIy the same way
as in a Iarge garden composition.''

855
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Go on.

856
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
That's it.

857
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
He doesn't mention us.

858
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Why shouId he mention us
in an interview?

859
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
He's a poet.
Poets taIk about nature...

860
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
not about the peopIe they meet.

861
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
The bird that has eaten flles away!

862
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I bet he doesn't even remember
what we Iook llke.

863
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
The Christian Democrats have been
victorious in every region.

864
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
The party chairman
has expressed his satisfaction.

865
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Satisfaction!

866
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
They haven't managed it.

867
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
What? They've taken
every region in ItaIy.

868
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
They can't do anything
with a handfuI of votes!

869
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
They've won a battIe,
but not the war.

870
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So we'll win the war?

871
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Who eIse?

872
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
But we have to fight,
and we wllI fight!

873
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It's the onIy way to break
our chains and set ourseIves free!

874
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Yes, but here...

875
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
when we've broken our chains...

876
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
what do we do then?

877
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
If Don PabIo couId hear you,
he wouIdn't approve.

878
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Don PabIo.
Don PabIo can't hear me.

879
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Who knows where he is,
what he's doing?

880
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
What's with these Iong faces?

881
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Mr. Di Cosimo,
this is a tragedy for us.

882
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
We were counting on
those two years of work.

883
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
We'd made pIans,
run up debts even.

884
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I know, it's a shame to Ieave
the work haIf-compIeted...

885
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
but we hope to start again soon.

886
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Soon? When?

887
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I don't know.

888
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
It depends.

889
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
But I assure you it won't be Iong.

890
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Anyway, I can't wait
to try out your cooking.

891
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
What does it depend on?

892
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Company probIems
are very compllcated.

893
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I don't know much
about company probIems...

894
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
but I'm not daft.

895
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
We all knew that
as soon as you got eIected...

896
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
the work wouId come to a haIt.

897
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
That's true.

898
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:51,000
The husband's hot-bIooded.

899
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
If Don PabIo had been here...

900
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,000
maybe the eIections
wouId have gone better.

901
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Mario, I have something
to tell you.

902
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I'm pregnant.

903
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
- Really?
- Yes.

904
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
- You're really pregnant?
- Yes.

905
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
We have to Ieave here.

906
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
No one understands us here.

907
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
They're all too ignorant.

908
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,000
We'll go to Chlle, so Pabllto
wllI grow up there, breathe poetry.

909
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Pabllto?

910
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Don't you llke it?

911
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:59,000
After Neruda. It'll be
a good omen for our son.

912
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:06,000
- Mario?
- No. He's in front.

913
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Mario, is that you?
There's a Ietter from Chlle.

914
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Put it in my pocket, pIease.

915
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
- Open it!
- Wait.

916
01:27:52,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Mario RuoppoIo. It's the first
Ietter I've ever received.

917
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:25,000
''Santiago, 15th October, 1953.

918
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Dear Sir...

919
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I ask you to send me...

920
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,000
some objects beIonging to...

921
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
signor PabIo Neruda...

922
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,000
which are to be found
in the house where he llved...

923
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
during his...

924
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
stay in ItaIy.

925
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Address encIosed...

926
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
and a llst of...

927
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
the above-mentioned objects.

928
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
The secretary... the secretary...

929
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:19,000
of PabIo Neruda.''

930
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
And for you?

931
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Not a word, not a greeting,
and he Ieft over a year ago.

932
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I toId you, the bird
that has eaten flles away!

933
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
PeopIe are kind onIy
when you're usefuI to them.

934
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Not again with that
''bird that has eaten.''

935
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
And usefuI for what?

936
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
What did I do for this person?

937
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
In fact, it was aIways me...

938
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
who wouId ask, ''Don PabIo,
wllI you check this metaphor?''

939
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
''Don PabIo,
wllI you read me a poem?''

940
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I'm the one who bothered him.

941
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And you say I was usefuI.

942
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
What did I do?

943
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And yet he knew
I was no good as a poet.

944
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
He knew, you know?

945
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
But instead he treated me
llke a friend.

946
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Like a brother.

947
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It's not true that you're no good.

948
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And I'm not calling him Pabllto.

949
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
What has the baby
got to do with it?

950
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Why, do you think I'm a poet?

951
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Am I a poet? Have I ever
written anything, any poems?

952
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
No, Mario, but--

953
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Then ''No, Mario'' nothing.

954
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Admit it.

955
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Why shouId he remember me?

956
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
As a poet, I'm not much good.

957
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
As a postman--
He wouId hardIy remember...

958
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
a postman who took him
his mall when he llved in ItaIy.

959
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
As a communist?

960
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Not even that. I wasn't very--

961
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I think it's...

962
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:27,000
quite normaI that he--

963
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
All right.

964
01:31:29,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Tomorrow, we'll go there
and send his things off.

965
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I toId them I'm here with
a friend who wishes to say hello...

966
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,000
and tell them something nice
about this beautifuI country.

967
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
- No.
- Yes.

968
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Good morning.

969
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
No, there.

970
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Good morning.

971
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Something nice about the isIand?

972
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Yes, one of the wonders
of your isIand.

973
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Are you sure
it works outdoors, too?

974
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,000
If it works inside,
it'll work outside.

975
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
It works here.

976
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
One, two, three.
Is the red llght on?

977
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Yes, it's llt.

978
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
One.

979
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Number one.

980
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Waves at the CaIa di Sotto.

981
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Small ones.

982
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Go on!

983
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Number two.

984
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Waves. Big ones.

985
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Go on!

986
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Number three.

987
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Wind on the cllffs.

988
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Number four.

989
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Wind through the bushes.

990
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Number five.

991
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Sad nets beIonging to my father.

992
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Number six.

993
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Church bell...

994
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
of Our Lady of Sorrows...

995
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:52,000
with priest.

996
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
It's beautifuI.

997
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I never reallzed
it was so beautifuI.

998
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Number seven.

999
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Starry sky over the isIand.

1000
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Number eight.

1001
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Pabllto's heartbeat.

1002
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
You can hear everything!

1003
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Really?

1004
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
You can hear it!

1005
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:40,000
You can hear Pabllto's heart!

1006
01:38:40,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I'm not calling him Pabllto.

1007
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Come here, Pabllto!

1008
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:07,000
There was
a communist demonstration.

1009
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Pabllto never saw him.

1010
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
He was born
a few days after Mario died.

1011
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I didn't want him to go,
but he wouIdn't llsten.

1012
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
''Don PabIo wouId be proud,''
he'd say.

1013
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
A riot began, and the pollce
moved in on the crowd.

1014
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
He was trapped.

1015
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
This is something
Mario made for you.

1016
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I shouId have sent it to you,
but I kept it instead.

1017
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Dearest Don PabIo...

1018
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
this is Mario.

1019
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I hope you haven't forgotten me.

1020
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Anyway...

1021
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:02,000
do you remember that
you once asked me...

1022
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
to say something nice
about my isIand...

1023
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
and I couIdn't think of anything?

1024
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Now...

1025
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I know.

1026
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
So I want to send you this tape...

1027
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
which, if you want to,
you can pIay to your friends.

1028
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,000
If not, you can llsten to it.

1029
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Then you'll remember me...

1030
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:36,000
and ItaIy.

1031
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
When you Ieft here...

1032
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I thought you'd taken all
the beautifuI things away with you.

1033
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
But now...

1034
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
now I reallze...

1035
01:41:51,000 --> 01:42:04,000
that you Ieft something
behind for me.

1036
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
I aIso want to tell you
that I've written a poem...

1037
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
but you can't hear it
because I'm embarrassed.

1038
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
It's called
''Song for PabIo Neruda.''

1039
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Even if it's about the sea...

1040
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
