1
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,818
Mmm.

2
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,807
You know, I thought 
I maybe drive into town.

3
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,338
You want something?

4
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,436
No.

5
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,039
A hunter?

6
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,809
No, they would travel in pairs, 
I think.

7
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,743
Come on.

8
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,117
Come on!

9
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,951
What's going on?

10
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,555
You have a gun?

11
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,391
Why would you have a gun?

12
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:32,768
Jack?

13
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,405
Jack?

14
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,652
Jack?

15
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,467
Is he dead?

16
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,199
Jack?

17
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,100
Go to the house
and call the police.

18
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,337
Go!

19
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,470
<i>Yeah?</i>

20
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,309
It's Jack. I'm here.

21
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,080
<i>What do you mean, "here"?</i>

22
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,243
Rome.

23
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,449
<i>There is a bar near the main station.</i>

24
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,651
<i>Caffè Ligeti, Via Volturna.</i>

25
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,016
<i>Wait there.</i>

26
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,276
Jack.

27
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,511
Pavel.

28
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,381
It's been a while.

29
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,758
Who was the girl?

30
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,089
A friend.

31
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,526
A friend?

32
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,262
Who were the Swedes?

33
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,133
I'm working on that. 
It's going to take some time.

34
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,168
Did she set you up?

35
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,640
She had nothing to do with it.

36
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,975
Pity.

37
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,117
You can't stay here.
I've made arrangements

38
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,986
for you to leave town
while I sort this out.

39
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,957
Take a right outside the bar.

40
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,500
Then second left.
Via Magenta.

41
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,994
You'll find a dark blue Fiat Tempra 
with Pescara plates.

42
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,465
I've marked a small town on the map.

43
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,337
Castelvecchio.

44
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,840
Stay there. 
Lay low, till you get my call.

45
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,115
Don't talk to anyone.

46
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,787
And above all, 
don't make any friends, Jack.

47
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,922
You used to know that.

48
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,496
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

49
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,236
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

50
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,869
America.

51
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,108
<i>Ah, I'americano.</i>

52
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,308
<i>Si, il americano.</i>

53
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,452
Can I help you?

54
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,493
I'm no good with machines.

55
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,760
- You are American.
- <i>Sì.</i>

56
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,029
You speak Italian?

57
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,161
<i>Poco.</i>

58
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,903
On vacation?

59
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,170
A working vacation.

60
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,036
I'm a photographer.

61
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,638
- <i>Fotografia?</i>
- <i>Sì.</i>

62
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,746
<i>Che genere di fotografia?</i>

63
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,983
Pictures of architecture,
landscape...

64
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,115
- People?
- No people.

65
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,021
Just for publications, for magazines.

66
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,389
Magazines. Which magazines?

67
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,992
Different ones. Uh...

68
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,593
<i>Va bene.</i>

69
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,795
You must share a glass of wine with me.

70
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,996
- Come tonight.
- Very kind. No.

71
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,835
You want to know the truth 
about Abruzzo?

72
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,233
A priest sees everything.

73
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,863
<i>Yeah?</i>

74
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,064
It's Jack.

75
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,765
You don't answer the cell I gave you.

76
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,968
<i>I'm no good with machines.</i>

77
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,473
You don't make this easy for me, Jack.

78
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,850
<i>I've got a job for you.</i>

79
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,880
<i>It's a custom fit.</i>

80
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,051
<i>You don't even have
to pull the trigger.</i>

81
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,888
I'll think about it.

82
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,741
The quality of the brandy is good.

83
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,606
Smooth.

84
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,150
The only good thing to come 
from the <i>francesi.</i>

85
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,829
You study our history?

86
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:56,725
No.

87
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,099
You come to Italy
to make a guide book

88
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,841
and you don't care about history?

89
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,238
I take pictures.

90
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,348
Of course.

91
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,613
You are American.

92
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,751
You think you can escape history.

93
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,985
You live for the present.

94
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,357
I try to, Father.

95
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,977
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

96
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,829
<i>Grazie.</i>

97
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,836
<i>Grazie.</i>

98
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,218
<i>Grazie.</i>

99
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,557
<i>Prego.</i>

100
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,221
You're welcome.

101
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,231
<i>Ecco, suo caffè.</i>

102
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,395
<i>Grazie.</i>

103
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,598
<i>Signore, desidera?</i>

104
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,930
<i>Sì. Caffè lungo...
Caffè americano.</i>

105
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,064
<i>Un americano.</i>

106
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,710
<i>Grazie.</i>

107
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,680
I'm Edward.

108
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,274
Mathilde.

109
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,653
Range?

110
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,119
150-175 meters.

111
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,090
Time?

112
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,532
Five seconds.
Seven at the most.

113
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,164
Targets?

114
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,629
One.

115
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,303
Firing rate?

116
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,534
Rapid.

117
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,033
Magazine capacity?

118
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,636
Large. Preferably a 5.56.

119
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,949
The weapon must be
fairly light and compact.

120
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,545
How compact?

121
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,518
As compact as possible.

122
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,119
You want an automatic rifle
to fit inside a woman's purse?

123
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,085
A small vanity case
would be permissible.

124
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,560
A small briefcase would be possible.

125
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,357
Noise?

126
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,027
Silencer.

127
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,096
I can only give you a suppressor.

128
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,200
It'll dampen the decibels

129
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,862
and dislocate the sound source

130
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,768
and reduce the muzzle flash.

131
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,404
I can't make you silent,
but I can make you invisible

132
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,844
as long as you're willing
to lose some range.

133
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,546
Two o'clock.

134
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,752
Light blue shirt, sunglasses. 
Is he with you?

135
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,384
I didn't see him.

136
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,492
In any case, I'm alone.

137
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,493
<i>Ecco, il suo americano.</i>

138
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,232
<i>Grazie.</i>

139
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,596
I can accept a slight loss of range.

140
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,170
You want a weapon
with the firing capacity

141
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,178
of a submachine gun
and the range of a rifle.

142
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,473
Can you do it?

143
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,008
Clarke.

144
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,845
<i>Un pacchetto.</i>

145
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:54,913
Clarke.

146
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,743
<i>Grazie.</i>

147
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,441
See you tonight.

148
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,690
All the sheep in my flock
are dear to me,

149
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,993
but some are dearer than most,

150
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,466
especially those that
have lost their way.

151
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,632
Fabio. <i>Meccanico.</i> 
"Car doctor."

152
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:15,111
But I think his work
is not always legal.

153
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,593
Did you ever want to be 
anything but a priest?

154
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:43,902
Have you ever wanted to be
anything other than a photographer?

155
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,407
I do what I'm good at.

156
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,112
You have the hands of a craftsman,

157
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,572
not an artist.

158
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,920
You are good with machines,

159
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,320
yet you told me just the opposite 
when we first met.

160
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,719
Hmm?

161
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,831
Journalism

162
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,425
cannot make you a rich man.

163
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,231
Perhaps you are rich already?

164
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,072
A man can be rich

165
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,248
if he has God in his heart.

166
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,517
I don't think God's 
very interested in me, Father.

167
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,264
Fabio.

168
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,035
I've got some damage to my car.

169
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,970
<i>Sì.</i>

170
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,013
I'm taking photographs in the mountains.

171
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,720
Okay, okay.

172
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,539
No, I need tools 
for a broken drive shaft.

173
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,810
My garage,

174
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,322
your garage.

175
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,261
<i>Sì, grazie.</i>

176
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,264
<i>Quanto costa?</i>

177
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,034
<i>Grazie.</i>

178
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,054
Hello again, Edward.

179
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,342
Does this place get many visitors?

180
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,350
This is the only way
to get here.

181
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,317
Did you check it for
footprints and tire tracks?

182
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,451
Three days ago I walked the river,
both sides.

183
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,224
Let's check again.

184
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,759
Rounds?

185
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:35,171
I prepared two kinds,
10 jacketed, 10 expanding.

186
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,770
I'd like 20 of each.

187
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,467
And 10 explosive.

188
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,910
Not a problem. Will mercury do?

189
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,811
Mercury will do very nicely.

190
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,677
I brought my own target.

191
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,227
Right there.

192
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,633
Muzzle velocity?

193
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,839
About 360 miles an hour.

194
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:53,815
That's including 20 miles an hour off 
for the sound suppression.

195
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,609
Ruger?

196
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:56,744
M14.

197
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,283
I've not had one before.

198
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,682
You'll find it easy.

199
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,452
I've re-balanced it 
for the weight of the suppressor.

200
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,521
The fulcrum's two centimeters forward 
from the grip,

201
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,226
but that shouldn't matter
if you're firing,

202
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,860
I'm assuming you are,
from a fixed position.

203
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,302
There's no major recoil issues.

204
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,170
You should be able to hold any target, 
even the smallest.

205
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,575
Go to the flower.
Fire into these reeds,

206
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,945
say, two steps away from me.

207
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,315
Two bursts, five seconds apart.

208
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,233
The sound suppression is superb.

209
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,608
I couldn't place the direction of fire.

210
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,414
I shall require the rounds and the weapon 
by the first of next month.

211
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,511
In the meantime,

212
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,351
could you tighten 
the adjusting screws on the sight?

213
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,221
They're too loose.
What about the case?

214
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:20,024
It's a briefcase. Samsonite.
Black. Combination locks.

215
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,291
You have a number you prefer?

216
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,862
- 014.
- 014.

217
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,128
What do you want done with these?

218
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,609
How thoughtful.

219
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,384
"Asprinio." I don't know it.

220
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,151
It's like Moscato,
only <i>frizzante.</i>

221
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:51,160
It wouldn't look right
if the picnic wasn't touched.

222
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,259
You chilled the wine, I thought...

223
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,390
Had to be chilled.
Italian cops.

224
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,172
Don't move.

225
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,980
So beautiful.

226
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,016
It's endangered.

227
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,154
You like coming here.

228
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,051
It serves a purpose.

229
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,395
You've never taken a woman
here before?

230
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,660
No.

231
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,134
Perhaps you do not have
a woman in your life?

232
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,495
Thank you, for a lovely day, 
Mr. Butterfly.

233
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:53,742
Sergio Leone.

234
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,273
<i>Italiano.</i>

235
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:15,764
No.

236
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,240
<i>Sì.</i>

237
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,681
It's like you can't stop 
thinking about something.

238
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,264
Or someone.

239
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,886
You don't have to act.

240
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,526
Act?

241
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,853
You might have to with other clients,

242
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,592
but you don't have to with me.

243
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,892
I want you to be exactly 
who you are.

244
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,398
I came here to get pleasure,
not to give it.

245
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,646
Maybe I pretend very well.

246
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,392
You give me more tips
than the other girls get.

247
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,504
I don't sleep with the other girls.

248
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,088
<i>Ciao, Signor Farfalla.</i>

249
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,150
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

250
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:44,017
This is my friend Anna.

251
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,386
Hi.

252
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,759
<i>Piacere, Anna.</i>

253
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:50,028
Do you want to join me
for some coffee?

254
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,195
We're going to see an American movie. 
Anna's learning English.

255
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,068
I would love to go to America.

256
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,834
But perhaps we can
see each other soon?

257
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,903
On Wednesday I'm free.

258
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,640
Okay, I'll be there.

259
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,911
Where?

260
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,383
Our usual place?

261
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,917
Our usual place.

262
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,087
I forgot.
Where is our usual place?

263
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,605
Let's go someplace new.

264
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:33,041
You can decide.

265
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,239
- Locanda Grapelli?
- Great!

266
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,510
Locanda Grapelli, good food.

267
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,182
Mmm-hmm. Grapelli.

268
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,484
- See you there?
- I'll see you there.

269
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,555
- At 8:00?
- At 8:00.

270
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,192
<i>Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla.</i>

271
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,628
Anna, it's nice to meet you.

272
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,162
Fuck.

273
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,273
Yeah?

274
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,320
<i>The Swedes found me.</i>

275
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,248
Stay put.

276
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:14,985
<i>Finish the job.</i>

277
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,082
How the fuck did they know
I was here?

278
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,229
Because you've lost your edge, Jack.

279
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,803
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

280
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,479
You're up early!

281
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,541
I needed some air.

282
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,380
I walk here to meditate.

283
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:57,518
I thank God for certain favors 
he has granted me,

284
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:03,621
and I ask him to look after those 
of my friends who are sinners.

285
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:08,736
All men are sinners.

286
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,338
Some are greater sinners than others.

287
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,842
But those who seek peace

288
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,778
have much sinning in their history.

289
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,774
Maybe.

290
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:25,452
Forgive me, this is the priest 
in me speaking, but

291
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:29,620
you have done much sinning, 
<i>Signor</i> Clarke.

292
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,221
And you still do.

293
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:39,358
Something happened here last night.

294
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,802
Everything I've done,
I've had good cause to do.

295
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:46,307
Do you wish to tell me?

296
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,740
- To confess?
- Yes.

297
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,077
For what reason?

298
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,171
For your own sake.

299
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:53,909
Perhaps I can pray for you?

300
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,245
Perhaps.

301
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:01,083
I wonder how many bastards 
have been made here.

302
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:06,458
You work in metal.

303
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:11,188
You were given some steel by Fabio, 
the car doctor.

304
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:15,297
Where was he conceived, Father?

305
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,039
Fabio, the car doctor.

306
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,776
Why do you ask me that?

307
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:26,142
You have each other's photos.
You have each other's eyes.

308
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:31,580
Was he conceived here, under the trees at night, 
like all the other bastards?

309
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,782
I do not remember, <i>Signor.</i>

310
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,693
It was many years ago.

311
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,663
In the end it is I
who confesses to you.

312
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,161
Do you want me to do the same?

313
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,672
For your own good.

314
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:56,772
You cannot doubt the existence of Hell. 
You live in it.

315
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,179
It is a place without love.

316
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:04,282
Perhaps I have no right
to wear these robes.

317
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,889
But I do have a heart
full of a father's love.

318
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:13,523
Something close to his heart!

319
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:19,090
And for that I am
both grateful and happy.

320
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:28,365
What do you have, my friend?

321
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,079
<i>Ciao.</i>

322
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:20,984
I was not sure you were coming.

323
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,621
I wasn't sure you meant me to.

324
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,063
<i>Certo che sì.</i>

325
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,733
- <i>Buonasera. Buonasera.</i>
- <i>Buonasera.</i>

326
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:33,866
<i>Grazie.</i>

327
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,668
- <i>Prego.</i>
- <i>Grazie.</i>

328
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:38,402
<i>Grazie.</i>

329
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,418
<i>No, grazie.</i>

330
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:23,148
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

331
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:28,691
Are you married?

332
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,899
No.

333
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,736
I was sure this was your secret.

334
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:41,071
Why do I have to have a secret?

335
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,873
You're a good man, but...

336
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:49,649
you have a secret.

337
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,053
<i>Mi scusi.</i>

338
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,654
<i>No, no, davvero.</i>

339
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,493
<i>Grazie. No.</i>

340
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,422
He thinks we are a couple.

341
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:01,622
That's okay.

342
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,686
<i>Grazie.</i>

343
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:03,787
<i>Grazie.</i>

344
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:33,357
<i>Pronto.</i>

345
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:34,694
I need some more time.

346
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:38,864
You're testing my patience.

347
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,535
Just give me a few more days.

348
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,910
You'll get two days,
then you make a drop.

349
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,252
<i>Ciao.</i>

350
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,019
<i>Ciao.</i>

351
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,033
Where we go?

352
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,433
Someplace beautiful.

353
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,910
A picnic.

354
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,883
Yeah. A picnic.

355
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:00,955
I have to practice my English.

356
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:05,119
Today, we are going to have a picnic.

357
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:07,253
It is a beautiful day.

358
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:39,659
Where we go?

359
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,453
You'll see.

360
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,374
I think it's good
we stay close to the road.

361
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:58,309
Don't worry. I've been this way
many times taking photographs.

362
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,454
Only you come here?

363
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:18,257
Yes.

364
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,007
Wow.

365
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,229
I'm going to swim in the water.

366
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:50,559
You come?

367
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:52,065
It's cold.

368
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:54,426
Maybe.

369
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,108
Come!

370
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:12,020
Come, Mr. <i>Farfalla.</i>

371
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,747
It's beautiful, no?

372
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:24,956
We make love in the water?

373
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,068
What's wrong?

374
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,133
We should have our lunch.

375
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:35,833
Ah! Ah.

376
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:41,247
Look. It's a bullet.

377
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:43,716
Maybe the hunters are here.

378
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:45,047
I don't think so.

379
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,286
I'm cold.

380
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,314
Edward.

381
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,790
Is that your real name?

382
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:48,942
Will you put this behind me?

383
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,386
What?

384
01:19:58,627 --> 01:19:59,992
What?

385
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:06,656
Nothing.

386
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,640
<i>Grazie.</i>

387
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,681
I just don't understand what the hell 
you're doing with a gun.

388
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,715
A friend of mine give to me.

389
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:30,280
The two prostitutes 
were killed in Pescara, right?

390
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,326
Did you see what they do to them?

391
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,424
The police showed me the photographs.

392
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:36,263
I want to feel safe with clients.

393
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,923
Does it make you feel safe with me?

394
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,159
You're not a client.

395
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,462
Then why is it in your bag?

396
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:42,435
Because I work tonight.

397
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:58,809
There's a <i>processione.</i>

398
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:00,813
A procession?

399
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,684
Yes. Tomorrow.

400
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,923
In Castel del Monte.

401
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,497
We go to this together?

402
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:12,998
Maybe.

403
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:14,662
Really?

404
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:17,970
And after...

405
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,499
After that, after tomorrow,

406
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,574
and the next day...

407
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:25,939
I can't stay forever, Clara.

408
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,252
It's time to go home.

409
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:39,293
- Take me home with you.
- I can't.

410
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,054
Stay forever.

411
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:30,967
<i>Yeah?</i>

412
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:34,979
I'll make the delivery
and then I'm out.

413
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:40,547
Pavel?

414
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:47,823
Okay, Jack.

415
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,522
You're out.

416
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:30,362
<i>Hello?</i>

417
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,770
Now, you listen to me carefully.

418
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:26,946
<i>Un caffè.</i>

419
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:29,213
<i>Due.</i>

420
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,720
I see you've brought it in with you.

421
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,924
Everything's here as we agreed.

422
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:47,900
What's this?

423
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:50,803
Candy for your trip.

424
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:59,602
I thought you might have 
a sweet tooth.

425
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:05,781
That's very kind of you.

426
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:17,389
I guess I'll be reading
about this in the <i>Tribune.</i>

427
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:21,527
Yes.

428
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:24,236
I expect so.

429
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:45,683
I'm just going to the ladies, 
wait here.

430
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:53,217
Okay?

431
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:54,886
I'm fine. You?

432
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:56,327
Just fine.

433
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:58,899
You won't need your gun.

434
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:00,490
You never know.

435
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,440
Final payment.

436
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:24,420
Buy yourself a retirement clock.

437
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:52,118
Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.

438
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:47,097
Hello?

439
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:49,499
What happened?

440
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:51,903
<i>There wasn't the opportunity.</i>

441
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:54,209
Find one.

442
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:56,280
<i>I'm following him now.</i>

443
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:42,850
Boo!

444
01:32:49,997 --> 01:32:52,090
I was looking for you.

445
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:54,596
I'm here.

446
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,333
What are you doing tonight?

447
01:32:57,471 --> 01:32:58,995
I work tonight.

448
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:00,596
Don't.

449
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:08,672
If I ask you to come away with me, 
would you?

450
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:11,646
Come away with you?

451
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:14,419
Why not?

452
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:21,359
- Together?
- Together.

453
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:23,093
Forever?

454
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:24,391
Forever.

455
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:31,137
<i>Io ti amo.</i>

456
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:32,229
<i>Ti amo.</i>

457
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:33,330
<i>Ti amo.</i>

458
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,810
I want you to take this
and meet me at the river.

459
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,477
- Eduardo.
- Go! Go!

460
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:06,970
Who do you work for?

461
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:10,034
Who?

462
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:12,744
Same man

463
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:16,114
as you,

464
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:18,679
Jack.

465
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:46,640
I'm sorry, Father.

466
01:38:59,533 --> 01:39:01,091
Eduardo!

467
01:39:01,969 --> 01:39:03,197
Eduardo!

468
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:05,266
Eduardo!
