1
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,475
(jaunty music)

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,348
- [Voiceover] Since the 
earliest days of cinema,

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,517
Jules Verne has been one of 
the most prominent authors,

4
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:22,188
whose works have been 
adapted for the screen.

5
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,723
It was the great Georges Méliès

6
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,292
who produced the first of these.

7
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,828
(jaunty music)

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,215
In 1907 the Spaniard 
Segundo de Chomón

9
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,417
directed the first version of

10
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,086
Journey to the 
Center of the Earth.

11
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,355
The film which you are 
about to see is a tribute

12
00:00:55,355 --> 00:01:00,160
to these pioneers of the film 
world of science fiction.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,562
(drum music)

14
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,745
(gentle music)

15
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,391
(lighthearted orchestral music)

16
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:05,758
(moves to dramatic 
orchestral music)

17
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,399
(organ music)

18
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,455
- Mom!

19
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,925
(organ music)

20
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,671
- If you've come to sell, 
you're in the wrong shop.

21
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,411
We've enough stock on 
hand, up to our necks.

22
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,013
- But these are bargains indeed.

23
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:38,952
Wisdom bound, a distraction 
for the most jaded intellect.

24
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,322
All for only three 
Groschens the lot.

25
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:45,925
Sir.

26
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,395
- Hm, no no.

27
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,764
They're only fit to 
light fires with.

28
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:56,035
Look at those dog-eared 
pages and rotten bindings.

29
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,273
Don Quixote by the 
Spaniard who's name

30
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,975
is practically 
impossible to pronounce.

31
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,377
- Cervantes man, Cervantes.

32
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,447
And you're the only person I 
know who can't pronounce it.

33
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,616
- Just look at this 
Professor Lindenbrock.

34
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,718
A penny dreadful called

35
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,920
The Fantastic Journey 
of Arne Saknussemm.

36
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,788
- Two grochens, that's 
hardly a loaf of bread

37
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,790
and a flask of wine in 
these difficult times.

38
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,726
- Stick to your price 
man, three's fair.

39
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,361
Three it shall be.

40
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,498
- A transaction sir, 
you will long remember.

41
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,033
And never forget.

42
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,601
- Or an act of pure charity.

43
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,969
That's what I should call it.

44
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,071
- Charity is it's own reward,

45
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:36,876
for those who can read 
the writing on the wall.

46
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,779
- And what on earth do you 
suppose he meant by that?

47
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,515
- What a strange story.

48
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,983
By a man who claims to have made

49
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,453
a journey to the 
center of the earth.

50
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,354
- Humbug.

51
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,993
- I agree, we are 
scientists, not adventurers.

52
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,930
The most fruitful theories about 
the structure of the earth,

53
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,533
have come from sitting 
in a quiet room,

54
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,468
using one's brain.

55
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,337
Not from poking about inside

56
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,373
some damp and evil 
smelling cavern.

57
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,943
- You are quite right.

58
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,746
- Such as your own 
idiotic theory,

59
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,748
that the core of the 
earth is composed

60
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:19,552
of an incandescent 
ball of liquid fire?

61
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:23,823
- Now, it has more validity 
than your inane notion,

62
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,094
that the earth's 
center is a solid rock

63
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:32,031
all covered with layers of 
lava like the skin of an onion.

64
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,734
(laughter)

65
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,436
- The fact is you're both wrong.

66
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,938
All recent studies indicate 
that the core of the earth

67
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,840
can only be gaseous.

68
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,544
- Gentlemen, the truth 
is that all our theories

69
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,612
are just that, theories.

70
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,616
None of us has the least idea of

71
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,419
how the earth was really formed.

72
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,693
Because the distance between 
the earth's crust and it's core

73
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,130
is over 6,500 kilometers.

74
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,167
And no man has ever 
descended to a depth

75
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,503
of more than three miles.

76
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,673
So it's obvious, we'll 
never have a glimmer

77
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,744
of true knowledge until we 
are able to reach a depth

78
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,646
of at least 100 leagues.

79
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,784
- What is your opinion 
Professor Lindenbrock?

80
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,487
- Well gentlemen, on one 
point at least I agree

81
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,789
with Professor Kristoff.

82
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,858
The materials of the 
geologist are not

83
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,093
charts, chalk and chatter,

84
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,895
but the earth itself.

85
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,563
Now this little book I'm reading

86
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,832
describes a decent through 
the mouth of a volcano,

87
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,001
into the very 
bowels of the earth.

88
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:46,572
But with an imagination that 
puts all our theories to shame.

89
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,007
It's only a work of 
fiction of course

90
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,943
but it's very existence 
buttresses Kristoff's argument

91
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,146
that we shall never 
know the truth

92
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,047
until we are able to make

93
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,483
that journey and 
see for ourselves.

94
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,952
- Only six more to go.

95
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,088
- Why am I the one who 
has to crawl around

96
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,656
after those wretched 
little rocks,

97
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,491
when you're the one 
that spilled them.

98
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,826
- They are not little rocks.

99
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,795
This is the collection 
of Otto Lindenbrock

100
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,463
and the long and 
the short of it is

101
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,000
I know how to classify 
them and you don't.

102
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,169
- I had some good news today

103
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,004
they're going to let 
us cadets participate

104
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,939
in the summer maneuvers 
between Prussia and Austria

105
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,107
in the Bavarian forest.

106
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,608
- How thrilling.

107
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,812
- It occurred to me 
that if you're still

108
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,213
going to Salzberg on that

109
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,549
ridiculous cave crawling 
expedition with your uncle,

110
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,917
perhaps we could all meet 
later and take a trip

111
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,885
down the Danube.

112
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,655
- That depends on when your 
ridiculous maneuvers are over.

113
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,089
- Maneuvers are not ridiculous.

114
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,225
They are an essential 
part of military training.

115
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,860
And as Bismarck said,

116
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,696
a nation's army is 
a nation's backbone.

117
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,164
- Little boys who never grew up,

118
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,233
playing silly little 
war games so they can

119
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,068
sleep outdoors in tents.

120
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,003
And hide behind trees.

121
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,940
- [Axel] Well it's not 
as silly as climbing

122
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,909
in and out of caves and 
collecting worthless rocks.

123
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,779
- You'd better get the soup 
ready Marta, he's coming.

124
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:04,817
- Oh dear, oh dear, he's at 
least 10 minutes early today.

125
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,586
- Well what does that matter?

126
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,887
- You know what a 
fanatic uncle Otto is

127
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,255
about having lunch on the table

128
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,124
the moment he gets in the door.

129
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,626
And give me the last one,

130
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,163
before he sees that we 
spilled them, quick.

131
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,664
- Stupid stones.

132
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,801
Professor, I was just--

133
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,603
- Yes, yes Axel, I understand.

134
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,071
If it's alright with my niece

135
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,740
then it's perfectly alright 
with me, congratulations.

136
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,975
- Did you hear that,

137
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,244
he accepted my proposal 
even before I made it.

138
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,012
- Yes, but I haven't.

139
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,615
After all, why should I 
want to marry a soldier.

140
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,216
- And why not?

141
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,685
- Tell your uncle the soup 
is served miss Glauben.

142
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,787
- Because if there's a 
war you might get killed.

143
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,990
And if there's no war 
you'll never be promoted.

144
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,593
All in all, I call that 
a silly profession.

145
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,829
- That's a treasonous remark!

146
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,131
(giggling)

147
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,837
- Lunch is ready uncle Otto.

148
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,306
- Ah, splendid, I've a 
very good appetite today.

149
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,142
Good heavens, what's this?

150
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,244
- It's in old English.

151
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,114
And what looks to be a map.

152
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,917
- It is a map, of Iceland.

153
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,752
- You can examine 
it after lunch,

154
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,953
the soup is getting cold.

155
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,655
- Yes yes darling, 
you run along.

156
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,223
I'll be right there.

157
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,666
- We'll go ahead 
and start Marta.

158
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,366
No no.

159
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,340
(bells chime)

160
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,852
- I don't see what he 
can find so interesting

161
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,120
in an old map.

162
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,288
- It's not the map, 
it's some kind of

163
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,923
coded text printed below it.

164
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,391
- A coded text?

165
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,927
- [Glauben] Yes, he's going 
crazy trying to decipher it.

166
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,096
- Then why didn't you tell 
me that in the first place?

167
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,297
I could have done them for him,

168
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,232
and saved him from 
missing lunch.

169
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,902
- What do you know 
about unraveling codes?

170
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,104
- [Axel] Only slightly 
more than Champollion.

171
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,405
- Who is he?

172
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,240
- The Frenchman who 
solved the mystery

173
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,943
of the Egyptian hieroglyphics.

174
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,113
Do you think the only 
thing they teach us

175
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,384
in the military academy is 
how to hide behind trees?

176
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,391
- Oh dear dear, dear me.

177
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,296
Seven hours and all 
we've managed to decipher

178
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,365
is the signature.

179
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,866
- If only we could 
establish what language

180
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,335
this message is written in.

181
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,104
- Well since the book is 
written in old English,

182
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,073
I feel sure the code 
must be in English also.

183
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,775
- It could take us 
weeks to go through

184
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,178
every possible combination 
of these letters.

185
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,815
- Not weeks, months the 
way you're going about it.

186
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,151
Champollion, look over here.

187
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,724
- Why didn't we 
think of that before?

188
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,338
- This doesn't work either.

189
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,942
- Now wait Glauben.

190
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,980
Go back to the series 
you had before.

191
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,881
Ah.

192
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,419
- Now it looks like Russian.

193
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,222
- Yes, yes, I'm afraid 
it's a hopeless task.

194
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,162
(dramatic music)

195
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,263
Well I'll be.

196
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,100
In the words of my 
distinguished colleague Darwin,

197
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,968
I'll be a monkey's uncle.

198
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,103
Look at this!

199
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,506
(gentle music)

200
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,208
- It even rhymes!

201
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,811
- Well I'll be dashed.

202
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,446
- Mount Sneffels you will see

203
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,047
provides the master key

204
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,449
and Scartis indicates

205
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,317
the entrance to the gates

206
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,219
for the tale I told is true

207
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,354
the rest I leave to you.

208
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,291
(gentle music)

209
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,926
- The writing on the wall.

210
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,495
That strange old man was right.

211
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,031
- What does it all mean?

212
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,299
- It means Axel that you and I

213
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,267
are in the privileged 
position of having made

214
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,502
one of the most 
important discoveries

215
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,004
in the entire 
history of science.

216
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,074
But we can't do anything 
about it until next year.

217
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,876
- Uncle Otto, you're 
being obscure again.

218
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,146
- Oh Glauben my dear child 
can't you understand.

219
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,948
This account of 
Saknussemm's journey

220
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,483
into the center of 
the earth is all true!

221
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,818
He actually did it, 
he found a way in!

222
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,286
- That's fantastic.

223
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,322
- And this coded message 
contains the only information

224
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,791
he concealed in the whole book,

225
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,526
Managed in the end to reach 
the earth's inner crust

226
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,162
which is Sneffels we 
now know and the peak,

227
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,297
which by a shadow cast on 
a certain day of the year

228
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,833
indicated the actual 
mouth of the cave

229
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,034
through which we 
have to descend.

230
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,970
- Scartis peak atop 
mount Sneffels.

231
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,339
They really do exist.

232
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,374
But why wait another 
year before following

233
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,077
in Saknussemm's footsteps?

234
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,912
- Follow in his footsteps?

235
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,914
The very thought 
of it is absurd.

236
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,383
- Ah, unfortunately 
according to the book

237
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,819
the only day of the 
year on which the sun

238
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,054
casts a meaningful 
shadow on Scartis peak

239
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,390
is June the 19th at 11:29am.

240
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,162
- Oh, and today 
is June the 20th.

241
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,329
- [Otto] Exactly.

242
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,564
- What a pity.

243
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,467
I can't bear to wait 
another whole year.

244
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,202
- Haven't you forgotten?

245
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,538
This book was written at the 
time of the Julian calendar.

246
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,006
- What do you mean?

247
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,507
- But of course!

248
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,276
And now we're using 
the Gregorian calendar

249
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,611
which differs from 
the Julian by 10 days.

250
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,346
- Which means it's 
really June the 10th.

251
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,315
- And we can still make it!

252
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,251
But only if we catch that 
morning train from (mumbles).

253
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,053
Marta, come at once!

254
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,591
- I can't believe all this.

255
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,161
- Now let's start collecting 
everything we may need.

256
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,629
- You wanted to 
see me Professor?

257
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,499
- Ah Marta, please pack 
our bags immediately,

258
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,000
we shall be leaving first 
thing in the morning.

259
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,936
- Is the journey 
short or is it long?

260
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,971
I mean how shall I 
know what to pack?

261
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,607
- Marta, we are 
going on a journey.

262
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,276
A journey to the 
center of the earth.

263
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,613
- In that case, I won't 
need to pack your umbrella.

264
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,915
- I should bought new boots.

265
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,952
- I forbid it Glauben, 
I absolutely forbid you

266
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:16,121
to go with your uncle 
on this foolhardy trip.

267
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,624
The bowels of the earth is 
not a fit place for a woman.

268
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,359
- I'm afraid Axel 
is right my dear.

269
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,528
A journey like this could 
prove far too hazardous,

270
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,164
even for a girl as brave as you.

271
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,266
- But you can't go 
alone uncle Otto,

272
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,668
who would look after you 
if you fell and broke a leg

273
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,104
or something of the sort.

274
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,040
- I shall of course, 
even though it means

275
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,309
I shall miss the war maneuvers.

276
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,346
- Oh Axel, that's 
so noble of you.

277
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,581
Very well, if I 
must stay at home,

278
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,550
I just have to make 
the best of it.

279
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,518
- That's a most sensible 
attitude Glauben.

280
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,419
Thank you.

281
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,194
- Poor Glauben,

282
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,396
she looked so forlorn 
waving goodbye to us

283
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,699
there at the station, 
I miss her already.

284
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,303
- Yes, I know exactly 
how you feel my dear boy.

285
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,605
But you're perfectly right in 
forbidding her to come along.

286
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,174
After all, what possible 
use could a woman be

287
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,043
on an arduous trip like this.

288
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,444
- Tickets, tickets please.

289
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,146
- Give him the tickets Axel.

290
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,116
- But I don't have the 
tickets, you must have them.

291
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,418
- What, Glauben always looks 
after things like that,

292
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,420
didn't she give them to you?

293
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,157
- But I, mister, I don't 
think we bought any.

294
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,358
- Good heavens, I 
think I've forgotten

295
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,427
to bring the money as well.

296
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,363
- Never mind, I have enough for.

297
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,599
Well I'll be dashed,

298
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,268
I left my wallet in the 
pocket of my uniform.

299
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,537
- Oh dear, this is indeed 
a complicated situation.

300
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,473
- No, there's nothing 
complicated about it.

301
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,310
You either pay me now, or you 
get off at the next station.

302
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,511
- We can't do that man,

303
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,247
we'll miss the 
boat to Reykjavik.

304
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,983
Glauben!

305
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,684
- Glauben!

306
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,254
- You two would forget 
your own two heads

307
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,423
if they weren't screwed on.

308
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,024
- Oh my child.

309
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,760
(graceful music)

310
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,006
- What do you call this.

311
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,508
- It's a (mumbles), to measure 
the density of certain gases.

312
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,143
- Do you know how to use it?

313
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,080
- Nobody is as familiar with 
the instruments as I am.

314
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,048
You Axel, a more important task.

315
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,384
You are going to keep a 
diary of our daily events.

316
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,619
- You can rely on me 
for that professor.

317
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,356
- The first problem is 
where to find a porter.

318
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,291
We don't know 
anybody in Iceland.

319
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,160
- Oh yes we do, my 
old friend Fredrikson.

320
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,596
We studied together 
30 years ago.

321
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:41,133
I haven't seen him since, but 
I'm quite sure he'll help us.

322
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,569
- But where on earth 
are we going to find him

323
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,471
after all these years?

324
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,339
- Oh that's easy, 
he haunts museums

325
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,741
the was ghosts haunt houses.

326
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,109
Unless he's changed 
his ways he'll be

327
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,744
at the Museum of 
Natural History.

328
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,446
(piano music)

329
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,281
- [Axel] While the 
two colleagues were 
recalling old times

330
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,384
and discussing subjects 
of mutual interest,

331
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,553
Glauben and I passed a 
very instructive morning

332
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,189
going through the exhibits.

333
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,359
(gentle piano music)

334
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,820
- Is anything wrong, sir?

335
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,758
- He's lost his monocle, 
could you please help us?

336
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:43,495
- But of course, that's 
what I'm here for.

337
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,800
- Display cases are 
magnificently mounted.

338
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,368
Everything is.

339
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,770
- My God, what's he 
doing on the floor?

340
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,672
- He lost his monocle.

341
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,740
- Ah monocle?

342
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,346
And here you see the crown 
jewel of our collection.

343
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,749
- Trilophodon (mumbles).

344
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,152
A delight to the eye 
my dear Frederikson.

345
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,155
- But surely you haven't come 
all the way from Germany,

346
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,424
just to inspect our museum.

347
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,260
- No, actually we've come 
to explore Mount Sneffels.

348
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,862
There's no better example 
of a dormant volcano

349
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,564
in the northern hemisphere.

350
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,132
- A capital idea.

351
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,902
If it weren't for 
this blasted count,

352
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,371
I'd make the climb with you.

353
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,674
- Now friend, I 
must ask a favor.

354
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,209
The address of a good store

355
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,211
that can outfit us for 
climbing and the like,

356
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,612
and the name of a good porter

357
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,581
who can guide us 
up the mountain.

358
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,216
- The first is easy enough,

359
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,384
but the second is next 
to impossible I'm afraid.

360
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,819
- Impossible?

361
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,621
- It's herring season you know.

362
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,590
And every able bodied 
man in Iceland is either

363
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,526
out in the boat or 
home mending the net.

364
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,161
Can't you wait for 
a couple of weeks?

365
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,396
- No, it must be without 
fail no later than tomorrow.

366
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,865
- Oh.

367
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,367
(giggling)

368
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,203
- [Otto] Well we've no 
use for tents any way

369
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,272
so it doesn't matter.

370
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,273
- Where do you want it?

371
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,474
- Over there. 
- Over here.

372
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,609
- Make up your minds, 
this weighs a ton.

373
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,510
- Here.

374
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,548
- Now let me see, we shall want

375
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,582
some cases for our instruments.

376
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,483
- Boo!

377
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,951
- Glauben, please.

378
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,621
- What's that?

379
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,890
- A gas mask, you can 
breathe through it

380
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,726
under almost any circumstances.

381
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,895
- I see, it might very 
well come in handy,

382
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,363
we'll take four.

383
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,731
What can you show me 
in the way of lamps?

384
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,232
The more portable the better.

385
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,334
- I have just the thing.

386
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,704
Now where'd I put it?

387
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:36,708
Ah yes, Hans, would you 
move that barrel away.

388
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,346
If it's lamps you're after 
if was sheer good luck

389
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,749
that brought you into 
the only shop in town

390
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,685
with a complete 
line of high quality

391
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,721
imported merchandise 
and the finest native--

392
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,591
- [Woman] Just shut up 
and show him the lamps.

393
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,561
- Here, this is the 
Blumdorf lantern.

394
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,461
- Blum Ka.

395
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,299
- Ah yes, yes, that 
shall do very well.

396
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,434
We'll take four of 
those also, Axel.

397
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,671
That man over there, 
does he work for you?

398
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,705
- Hans?

399
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,740
Oh no, he's my cousin.

400
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,710
He comes down here once 
a month to help me out.

401
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,713
But he refuses to take 
a steady job in town

402
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,281
or on the boats.

403
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,784
- And once a month isn't much.

404
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,588
- He's a mountaineer, 
a shepherd.

405
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,990
And they are very proud.

406
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,759
- Then why isn't he 
out tending his flock?

407
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,861
- Now that's a sad thing sir.

408
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:33,632
Last winter his entire flock 
was struck by lightning

409
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,402
in a thunderstorm, and he's 
been sitting around ever since.

410
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,673
Doing little else but whittle 
and play his mouth organ.

411
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,345
- Hans, my friends and I 
are making an expedition

412
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,548
to Mount Sneffels, if 
I pay you a fair price,

413
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,018
are you prepared to 
come along and help us?

414
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,853
- I don't use money.

415
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,425
- What's a sheep 
worth in this country?

416
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,960
- Three rigsdalers.

417
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,931
- Supposing I pay you 
one sheep per week,

418
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,434
with a bonus of two 
rams on our safe return?

419
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,802
- When do we leave?

420
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,904
- At dawn, as soon as 
we pack our equipment.

421
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,506
- Isn't that wonderful,

422
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,476
we finally found work for Hans.

423
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,443
- Imbecile.

424
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,882
(dramatic orchestral music)

425
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:59,117
(moves to joyful 
orchestral music)

426
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,651
(moves to dramatic 
orchestral music)

427
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,679
- My word, Mount Sneffels, 
look at that view.

428
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,181
- It's a lovely sight.

429
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,484
This view alone makes 
our journey worth while.

430
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,719
- See those white vapors

431
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,621
rising from the 
floor of the crater?

432
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:46,792
If an eruption were imminent, 
they'd be twice that size.

433
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:50,462
- How long, professor, 
do we stay down there?

434
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,030
(fluttering music)

435
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,800
- Hans I was going to 
tell you this later.

436
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,967
Fact is we're going much deeper

437
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,537
than the floor of the crater.

438
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,606
We're going to descend into 
the very bowels of the earth.

439
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,176
Now you can come with 
us, or you can go home.

440
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,777
But I must warn you,

441
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,648
we may be down there 
some considerable time.

442
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,217
- Days or weeks?

443
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,920
- More like weeks.

444
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,825
- Weeks means sheep, I'll come.

445
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,060
- Thank you.

446
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,931
(dramatic orchestral music)

447
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,206
Down you go.

448
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,587
- It's deeper than I thought.

449
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,589
- Then don't look down.

450
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,259
- [Axel] As soon as we 
located Scartis peak

451
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,861
in the bottom of the crater,

452
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,629
Hans began the descent,

453
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,998
followed by the 
professor and Glauben.

454
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:04,269
I brought up the rear, in case 
anyone might need assistance.

455
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,140
- Here it is.

456
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,209
Hans, bring the baggage!

457
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,715
The line of the shadow, perfect.

458
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,316
(dramatic music) 
- Look, A S

459
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:22,020
Arne Saknussemm, this proves 
he's telling the truth.

460
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,890
- Hm, I never had the 
slightest doubt dear boy.

461
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,925
Never the slightest doubt.

462
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:30,095
Hans, the ladder 
here just here fine.

463
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,299
(dramatic music)

464
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,572
Check your lamp Axel, check it.

465
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,708
Slowly Hans, slowly.

466
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,946
Right Axel, you 
descend first Hans.

467
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,815
(dramatic music)

468
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,101
- [Axel] For the first 
time, I'm beginning to think

469
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,804
that Arne Saknussemm's 
story could be true.

470
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,606
And that what had seemed 
to be in principal

471
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,141
only a routine excursion

472
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,777
has now turned into 
an exciting adventure.

473
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,212
Although a bit risky, especially 
for those who have not

474
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,281
had the good fortune 
to receive adequate

475
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,317
physical and mental preparation.

476
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,987
(dramatic music)

477
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,822
- Alright Professor!

478
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,725
(dramatic music)

479
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,871
- It's deeper than it looks.

480
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:51,042
When your turn comes you 
must be very careful Glauben.

481
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,945
(dramatic music)

482
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,428
Right, stand by darling, 
right, come on down.

483
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:13,331
(dramatic music)

484
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,007
Easy does it now, easy.

485
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,909
(dramatic music)

486
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,853
Your turn Axel!

487
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:35,887
- Professor!

488
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,024
Are you absolutely 
certain that there's

489
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,959
no possibility of 
Sneffels erupting

490
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,360
in the near future?

491
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,062
- Stupid question!

492
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,931
(dramatic music)

493
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,940
- [Axel] Well, once more 
unto the breach dear friends.

494
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,910
(dramatic music)

495
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,345
Thanks to the careful 
selection and packing

496
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,047
of the most essential equipment,

497
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,183
we had been able to reduce our 
load to the minimum necessary

498
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,886
we have on hand, 
instruments, tools, weapons,

499
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:12,757
ropes, provisions for 60 days 
and drinking water for 10.

500
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,993
The quantity of water 
seems to me insufficient,

501
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,895
although according 
to the professor,

502
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,797
we will find what we need 
once we have gone down

503
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,331
deep enough into the earth.

504
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,834
(screaming)

505
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,737
(dramatic music)

506
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,314
- Hans, you lead the way.

507
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,184
(dramatic music)

508
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,035
- Professor, there are 
three possibilities here.

509
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,571
How do we know 
which one to take?

510
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,406
- All of them look endless.

511
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,975
- Nothing could be simpler.

512
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,145
We'll let Saknussemm 
be our guide there.

513
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,012
Once again.

514
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:44,048
(orchestral music)

515
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,185
This is where he mentions it.

516
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,088
Cave descending to the left.

517
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,257
Now lead on Hans.

518
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,992
Come.

519
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,928
(dramatic music)

520
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,070
(screaming) 
- Careful!

521
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,206
Now we've lost the water!

522
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,444
- That's bad luck.

523
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,216
Still, I'd rather it be the 
water than the instruments.

524
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,152
I feel sure we'll find 
some good water later on.

525
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,153
Right my dear?

526
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,054
- Yes uncle.

527
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,022
- Good girl.

528
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,025
Come on then, Hans lead on.

529
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,928
(dramatic music)

530
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,132
- How much do we have 
left in our canteens?

531
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,100
- Only enough for 
the rest of the day.

532
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,370
I was going to fill 
them this evening.

533
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:45,043
I should think it must 
be sundown by now.

534
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,348
- No wonder I'm so tired.

535
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,218
- [Axel] No wonder 
I'm so hungry.

536
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,461
- It's bad.

537
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,899
- Ah, well, don't 
be too downhearted.

538
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,570
We'll find good water 
soon I feel sure of it.

539
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,206
Now then Glauben, 
some readings please.

540
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,109
Temperature, 
barometric pressure.

541
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,012
- Humidity, 95%.

542
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,950
The thermometer reading, 
seven degrees centigrade.

543
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,919
- No wonder I feel chilly.

544
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,654
- What does the 
compass indicate Axel?

545
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,489
Saknussemm says here 
we should be heading

546
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,224
in a westerly direction.

547
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,325
- Dead west.

548
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,927
- Good old Saknussemm.

549
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,929
- Right, let's lead on.

550
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,365
Hans, come.

551
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,933
- If only he'd tell us 
when we're going to find

552
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,568
some drinkable water.

553
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,972
(dramatic music)

554
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,541
(wind howling)

555
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,451
If this keeps up we'll 
never get through!

556
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,054
- Saknussemm has a 
word to say about this.

557
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,055
Let me see.

558
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,624
(wind howling)

559
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,194
Oh, we've lost the book!

560
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,730
(wind howling)

561
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,668
Get your masks on.

562
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,437
(wind howling)

563
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,554
(muffled shouting) 
(wind howling)

564
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,753
(screaming)

565
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:13,224
(muffled shouting) 
(wind howling)

566
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,331
(wind howling)

567
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,314
- Are you alright?

568
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,583
- I will be when I can 
get my hair washed.

569
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,686
You look as though you might 
have been struck by lightning.

570
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,422
(wind howling)

571
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,300
- I know what you're 
thinking Axel.

572
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,304
We're out of water, we've 
lost our guide book.

573
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,575
The only sensible thing 
would be to turn back

574
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,378
while we can still 
find a way out.

575
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,781
- I must admit the thought 
had crossed my mind professor.

576
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,383
- You'd be a fool if it hadn't.

577
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,852
Bear in mind that 
just ahead of us lie

578
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:18,523
millions of years of 
unrecorded history.

579
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,858
Are we going to ignore 
that and turn back,

580
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,627
or do we go on?

581
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,695
- I propose that we take a vote.

582
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,231
- Alright Glauben, you start.

583
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,167
Do we go forward, like 
civilized creatures,

584
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,602
or do we turn back like cowards?

585
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:35,173
- You know I wouldn't ruin 
your picnic uncle Otto!

586
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,241
I say forwards.

587
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,676
- Thank you, Axel?

588
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,650
- A man who wears the 
uniform of Imperial Prussia

589
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,187
can have but one 
answer, unfortunately.

590
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,655
I say forward too.

591
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,790
- Hans?

592
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,498
- Forward means sheep, 
backwards means nothing.

593
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,134
I say sheep.

594
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,236
- That settles it 
then, thank you.

595
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,572
We go on, lead the way Hans.

596
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:14,645
- Uncle Otto, suppose the 
votes had gone against you?

597
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,614
- I should have 
ignored them my dear.

598
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,849
What possible progress 
could there be

599
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,786
if science were a slave 
to democracy, come on.

600
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:31,162
(wondering orchestral music)

601
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,483
- How lovely, uncle 
Otto, is that you?

602
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,656
(dramatic music)

603
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,259
Who's there?

604
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,928
(dramatic music)

605
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,572
Who's there?

606
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,475
(dramatic music)

607
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:47,638
Uncle Otto?

608
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,575
Axel?

609
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,477
Hans?

610
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,612
(dramatic music)

611
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,646
Who is that?

612
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,382
Who's there?

613
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,751
Axel?

614
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:04,755
(screaming)

615
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,324
Axel!

616
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:06,991
Help!

617
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,962
- Professor, what's that? 
(screaming)

618
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,730
- Glauben! 
(screaming)

619
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,633
(dramatic music)

620
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,916
- Glauben where are you?

621
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,020
Glauben!

622
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,922
- Here I am, in here!

623
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,826
- What happened to you?

624
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,628
- I lagged behind to 
look at those icicles,

625
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,730
and then stumbled 
into this muck.

626
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,665
- That much I can see.

627
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,601
- Then the most 
incredible thing happened.

628
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,036
Just as I was about to go under,

629
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,305
someone appeared 
and pulled me out.

630
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,907
- That's absurd, there's 
nobody here but us.

631
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:57,942
- [Glauben] I tell you, 
I felt a human hand

632
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,944
pull me out of there.

633
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,881
- Fantasy my dear child, some 
sort of tactile illusion.

634
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,317
You saved yourself by 
clinging to that rock,

635
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,386
which has the rough 
shape of a human hand.

636
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,655
- And the figure I saw 
hiding behind a rock,

637
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,791
I suppose you'll tell me 
that was an illusion also.

638
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,559
- Undoubtedly.

639
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,928
With the disorientation, 
the lack of water,

640
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,498
all of us are under 
considerable strain.

641
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,669
- Uncle Otto, I tell 
you I saw someone.

642
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,605
- A common illusion, known 
to geologists the world over.

643
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,907
From now on, you must 
stick close to us.

644
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:33,678
(anxious orchestral music)

645
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,783
- [Axel] I told you not 
to come on this trip,

646
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,618
didn't I, didn't I?

647
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,853
- [Glauben] Oh do shut up.

648
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,627
Which way now?

649
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,733
- We're confronted 
with another choice.

650
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,468
- Yes, now what?

651
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,570
- Frankly my dear 
Glauben at this point,

652
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,039
your guess is as good as mine.

653
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,943
- Frankly I'm getting sleepy.

654
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,912
- That's partly because 
it's been growing warmer

655
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,915
in the past couple of hours.

656
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,583
- The trouble is, if 
we stop to rest now,

657
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,552
before we find water,

658
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:19,023
when we wake we may be 
to weak to continue.

659
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,791
How do you feel about Axel.

660
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,393
- I could go on for miles.

661
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,628
- [Hans] Professor.

662
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,063
- What is it Hans?

663
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:30,000
- Letters, like the other ones.

664
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:35,973
- Ah, old Saknussemm coming 
to our aid once again.

665
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,513
Come on all you cheer up.

666
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,882
He must have had the same 
problem with water as we have.

667
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,685
- Maybe he didn't spill his.

668
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:48,853
(chattering)

669
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,955
- Listen, did you hear that?

670
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,656
(chattering)

671
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:55,893
- It sounds like 
voices, human voices.

672
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,129
- What could it be?

673
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,463
- I've no idea.

674
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,765
- It must be voices.

675
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:01,766
- Nonsense.

676
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,569
- Isn't it at least 
possible that somebody else

677
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,573
might have found a path into 
the earth the way we did?

678
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,677
- It's a possibility of course, 
but an extremely remote one.

679
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,013
- I suppose that's known to 
geologists the world over

680
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,949
as an acoustical illusion.

681
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:22,553
- Perhaps they're 
animals of some sort.

682
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,523
They could even be dangerous.

683
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,124
- Quiet, all of you.

684
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,928
Try not to make any 
noise, Hans, you lead.

685
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,563
Glauben, here, shh.

686
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,965
(chattering)

687
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,909
- Quiet, you hear anything now?

688
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,678
(voice echoes)

689
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,880
- So it wasn't animals 
after all, it was us.

690
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,950
(voice echoes)

691
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,952
- We must be squarely 
in the center

692
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,253
of an acoustical field.

693
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:59,023
(voice echoes)

694
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,495
- [Glauben] Alright, 
that'll do do do do.

695
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,031
(voice echoes)

696
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,201
Let's get out of here.

697
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,235
- No wait, Glauben.

698
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,904
(voices echo)

699
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,248
(screaming)

700
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,892
- Alright, alright.

701
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,862
We should be safe enough here.

702
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,663
- I'm thirstier than ever,

703
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,166
and I can't go on 
another step uncle Otto.

704
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,735
- Well, there's 
nothing else for it.

705
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:48,706
We shall have to rest here, 
try to get some sleep.

706
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:49,940
Alright, alright, alright.

707
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,042
- I still say I saw a 
real face back there,

708
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,244
not an illusion.

709
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,847
- Shh little one, try 
to get some sleep.

710
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,685
(tapping)

711
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,634
(tapping)

712
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,141
- Hans, where are you?

713
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,024
(tapping)

714
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,159
Hans, what are you doing?

715
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,061
- Listen, water.

716
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:44,962
- Water?

717
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,765
- Shh.

718
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,700
- I'll get the others.

719
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,939
Wake up, we found water!

720
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,006
- What?

721
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,041
- Water!

722
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,842
- Where?

723
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,813
- Just ahead, Hans 
has discovered an 
underground stream.

724
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,281
- Thank God.

725
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,651
Come on Axel, let's 
go and see about.

726
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,225
- Here, right here.

727
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,698
- Yes, no doubt about 
it, there's water.

728
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,838
Right here I think.

729
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,139
- No, over here.

730
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,876
- No no no, this is where I 
can here the noise best Hans.

731
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,979
Give me the pick.

732
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:39,183
- Professor, I know 
mountains and I know caves.

733
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,820
Here is a good place, 
that is a bad place.

734
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,189
- Hans, as a 
professor of geology,

735
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,791
I also know about 
caves and mountains,

736
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,661
and how to break through them 
when necessary to find water.

737
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:51,395
Stand back.

738
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,411
- [Axel] Careful professor.

739
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,381
(screaming)

740
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,016
- Have you lost your mind?

741
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,984
Another inch to your 
right this entire cavern

742
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,753
would have collapsed 
on our heads.

743
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,354
This simple mountain man 
has more common sense

744
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,257
than you with all your 
diplomas professor Lindenbrock.

745
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,259
- Who are you?

746
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,994
- How do you know 
my uncle's name?

747
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,929
- Because I have read his books,

748
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,264
and also because I've 
had to listen to your

749
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,133
incessant chatter 
during the last 10 miles

750
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,101
of this tedious decent.

751
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,803
- You followed us 
into the earth?

752
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,738
- Hardly, since I began 
my descent two months ago.

753
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,140
- Through Sneffels?

754
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,009
- I prefer to find 
my own way in,

755
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,878
just as I expect to find 
my own way out again.

756
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,414
- Why, you've burned your hand.

757
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,719
- A mere trifle young lady.

758
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,988
Quench your thirst.

759
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,322
- You're doing scientific 
research mister?

760
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,725
- Olsen, simply call me Olsen.

761
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,927
Like any civilized man, I 
include the natural sciences

762
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,196
among my hobbies.

763
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,031
But naturally I refuse to 
let their so called laws

764
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,399
limit my outlook.

765
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,769
- Well now that our 
paths have crossed

766
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,738
it would be sensible 
to travel together.

767
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,740
- You are welcome to the 
benefit of my experience.

768
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,175
- I think it should be 
made perfectly clear,

769
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,944
that this expedition is led 
by professor Otto Lindenbrock

770
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,846
and none other.

771
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,148
- My dear boy, my 
own interest lies in

772
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,150
the acquisition of 
knowledge itself.

773
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:24,455
And not the accumulation 
of dusty academic honors.

774
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,092
- Did you ever hear 
such insolence?

775
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,060
How I'd love to have 
him for just one day

776
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,429
in my (mumbles) platoon.

777
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,997
- Don't be pompous Axel.

778
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:37,468
Now at least we have 
something to drink at last.

779
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,303
- Why don't you wait 
until it gets cool?

780
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,805
(laughing)

781
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,876
- [Axel] Apart from the fact 
of calling himself Olsen,

782
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,145
and that he obviously 
belongs to the human race,

783
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,480
we have learnt very 
little else concerning

784
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,049
this particular individual.

785
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,052
All that we have determined 
that his only equipment

786
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,387
consists of a 
mysterious metal box.

787
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,189
This strange and 
startling materialization

788
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,924
was largely forgotten however,

789
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,326
in the general delight 
resulting from the

790
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,461
discovery of water, which 
from this moment on,

791
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,898
we encountered in 
great quantity.

792
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,534
(anxious music)

793
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,037
Glauben appears to be 
the one most affected

794
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:17,908
by the annoying 
presence of this Olsen.

795
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,410
I'm afraid we've taken a wrong 
turn and lost the others.

796
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,079
- How tedious.

797
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,115
- At least we're 
alone for a change.

798
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,484
- If you're referring to 
the absence of Mr Olsen,

799
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,853
I must say I find 
that no great comfort.

800
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,490
- Well I think he's 
boring conceited and rude.

801
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,425
- Yes but who cares anyway.

802
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:38,962
Who cares what he's like when 
he has such interesting eyes.

803
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,865
- Well, if that's 
all you can say.

804
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,934
(screaming)

805
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:46,937
- Axel! 
(screaming)

806
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:54,478
- What happened?

807
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,113
- It's alright my dear boy.

808
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,548
The worst is over.

809
00:46:58,615 --> 00:46:59,883
- Glauben?

810
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,151
- Not a scratch on her.

811
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,988
In fact she's out there 
having a swim, come on.

812
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,963
- I must be having 
hallucinations.

813
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,298
- My boy.

814
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,234
- It looks like an ocean!

815
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,468
- One of nature's 
apologies my dear boy.

816
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,270
And ocean below the 
surface of the sea.

817
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,439
Fresh water, too.

818
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,208
- I can hardly believe my eyes.

819
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,643
- The enclosure you see above 
us is nearly a mile high.

820
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:30,180
(orchestral music)

821
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,882
Steady now, steady.

822
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,987
Never in my whole life, 
not even above the earth,

823
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,522
have I seen a mineral 
formation that could

824
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,425
retain and project 
so much light.

825
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,360
It's incredible.

826
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,963
- It's breathtaking.

827
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,497
- Axel, come on in!

828
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,236
Axel, come on, the 
water's beautiful.

829
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,239
- Go on in the water, go 
on, it'll do you good.

830
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:58,208
Do you know you've been 
unconscious for nearly two days.

831
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,409
Mind your head.

832
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,081
- No wonder I feel groggy.

833
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,255
- How's the raft 
coming along Hans?

834
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,924
- Soon be finished.

835
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,926
- I hope that fossilized 
wood floats alright.

836
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,327
- It'll float.

837
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:21,465
- Well if it doesn't, I scarcely 
know what course to take.

838
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,635
(joyful orchestral music)

839
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,103
- Here I come!

840
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,405
- You do look 
silly, come in Axel!

841
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,109
(joyful orchestral music)

842
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,278
- Coming to get you!

843
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:35,279
- It's cold in here.

844
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,080
- It's not that cold come on,

845
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,682
I'm gonna get you.

846
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:41,318
Look out now, here 
I come, here I come.

847
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:45,055
(joyful orchestral music)

848
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,073
(dramatic music)

849
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,104
- May I have my clothes back?

850
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,005
- Sorry.

851
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,041
- Olsen, who are you really?

852
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,444
Where do you come from?

853
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:41,311
Your hand!

854
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,747
- What about my hand?

855
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,316
- Why, it's completely healed.

856
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,685
How is that possible 
in so short a time?

857
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,288
- But it is possible you see.

858
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:55,025
- It was your hand that 
pulled me out of there,

859
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:55,726
wasn't it.

860
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:01,631
- I don't know what you're 
talking about Glauben.

861
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:09,806
- Do you really think 
it's going to be

862
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,408
safe enough to sail in?

863
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:14,478
- Hans assures me 
that it will float.

864
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,114
I simply can't get over 
this strange light.

865
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,182
It's uncanny, fantastic.

866
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,786
- Yes, but no more so 
than the Aurora Borealis

867
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:26,256
and caused by the same 
sort of simple ionization.

868
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,792
- Look what I found, 
what a pretty shell.

869
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,761
- Oh my dear child, 
treat that very gently.

870
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,829
- Oh, it turned to sand.

871
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,600
- All these things 
you see are fossils,

872
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,535
not shells Glauben.

873
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,437
- Does that mean there are still 
living creatures out there?

874
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:44,174
- I should be very surprised 
to learn the contrary Axel.

875
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,243
- Where are you going Hans?

876
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:47,577
- I need a rudder.

877
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,312
- Well you carry on working,

878
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:52,149
we'll go and look for something.

879
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,624
- [Glauben] Good heavens.

880
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,792
- They look just 
like giant mushrooms.

881
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,694
(dramatic music)

882
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,772
They look like wooden mushrooms.

883
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:18,308
- They are mushrooms.

884
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:19,342
Millions of years 
ago they flourished

885
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,311
above the earth as well.

886
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,713
Now you stay here 
while I investigate.

887
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,616
These could be dangerous.

888
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:27,884
- Extraordinary.

889
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:31,288
(electronic noise)

890
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,490
- [Glauben] As perfectly 
preserved as in a greenhouse.

891
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,192
- [Axel] I wonder how many of 
these you get to the pound.

892
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,261
Where could your 
uncle have got to?

893
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,264
- Uncle Otto?

894
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,136
- Professor!

895
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,805
(dramatic music)

896
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:52,909
- Uncle Otto!

897
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:56,780
- Alright Axel, Glauben, 
you can join me now.

898
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,150
But take great care, 
I'll explain presently.

899
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:00,884
Come on.

900
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:03,787
(dramatic music)

901
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:05,889
Walk gently.

902
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,591
- Why?

903
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,292
It looks innocuous enough.

904
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,360
- Innocuous it is not.

905
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,163
That pollen can be fatal.

906
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:14,865
If it falls on you it 
can cause histoplasmosis.

907
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,933
You see that red dust 
on the top of them?

908
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,401
- It's dangerous?

909
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,171
- Ha, as I've already 
said, it can be fatal.

910
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,472
Now we must get away from here 
in case a breeze springs up

911
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,407
and loosens it, now 
whatever you do,

912
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:27,310
don't touch the 
mushrooms, ready?

913
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,181
Run for your lives!

914
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,621
- Hurry!

915
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,895
(dramatic music)

916
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,666
- What was that?

917
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,401
- Explosion.

918
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,802
- A second earlier,

919
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:56,640
we'd have been underneath 
that poison dust,

920
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,241
- Olsen, come on.

921
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,318
Good lord.

922
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,321
Are you out of your mind man?

923
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,589
You of all people 
who criticized me

924
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,424
for knocking a small 
whole in the cave wall!

925
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,860
The vibrations you're causing

926
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,994
you'll bring this whole 
structure down on our heads!

927
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,362
- I have my 
experiments to perform

928
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,964
just as you have 
yours professor.

929
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,399
- Your so-called experiments are

930
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:25,335
putting all our 
lives in jeopardy.

931
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:26,369
- Our lives?

932
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,506
Do you really think the 
sort of work you're doing

933
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,941
is going to make and 
difference to any ones life

934
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,375
on this planet?

935
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:34,945
- There there uncle Otto,

936
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,580
none of this is 
worth arguing about.

937
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,981
- Who does he think he is?

938
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:41,952
Putting all our lives in danger 
with his ridiculous games.

939
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:46,289
- Let's go and see how 
the raft is coming along.

940
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:48,992
Hello Hans.

941
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,395
- I found a rudder.

942
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,597
- Well done Hans, 
how soon do you think

943
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,432
you'll be ready to launch her?

944
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:56,533
- Soon enough.

945
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:58,835
- Splendid, you work very well.

946
00:53:58,835 --> 00:53:59,903
- I'll get our gear together.

947
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,638
- I'll go with you.

948
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:07,377
How do you feel?

949
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:08,712
- Much better now.

950
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:09,613
- What are you doing?

951
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,615
It's incredible.

952
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,283
- What?

953
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,884
- Yesterday you had a deep 
gash on your forehead.

954
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,921
Wounds apparently 
heal much faster here.

955
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,956
- Then what a fine 
battleground it would make.

956
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:21,424
- Idiot!

957
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,994
(laughing)

958
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,963
(wondering music)

959
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,306
- [Axel] From the moment 
of it's launching,

960
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,575
the raft had proved that 
it could sail beautifully.

961
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,977
To the great 
satisfaction of everyone.

962
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:43,079
(wondering music)

963
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,548
We are maintaining a steady 
south easterly course

964
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:47,584
of one four five degrees.

965
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,786
And according to the 
calculations of the professor,

966
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:54,057
we should be sailing directly 
underneath the British Isles.

967
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,728
The only noticeable 
inconvenience

968
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,797
has been the discomfort 
produced in those persons

969
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,767
not trained to rise above 
every type of difficulty.

970
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,736
(wondering music)

971
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,612
Today we received 
a welcome surprise.

972
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:16,479
I think its alight?

973
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,947
- I got it, I got it.

974
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,349
- Axel!

975
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,352
- [Axel] Give it to 
me, give it to me!

976
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:23,820
- Good girl.

977
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,524
- It's a shark, watch 
it doesn't bite you.

978
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,828
What a strange looking fish.

979
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,430
- Do you think it's edible?

980
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,632
- I don't see why not.

981
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,933
- We'll cook it.

982
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,737
- [Glauben] I'm so hungry.

983
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,872
- [Axel] Come on Hans, come on.

984
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:43,907
- Be careful it's hot.

985
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:45,575
- What about Olsen?

986
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,977
- If he wants some, let 
him come here and get it.

987
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,579
- How does it taste Glauben?

988
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:50,780
- Like a dream.

989
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,551
- Thank you Hans.

990
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,853
- I'd say more like sturgeon.

991
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,858
- [Glauben] Delicious, I still 
think we should invite Olsen.

992
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:02,859
- [Axel] He gets more 
nourishment from his books.

993
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,161
- Be quiet, he'll hear you.

994
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,066
It's growing warmer here.

995
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,805
- 32 degrees.

996
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,576
- Well, that's not 
excessive considering

997
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,478
we're 100 miles 
beneath the surface.

998
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,447
- It's excessive enough for me.

999
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:28,118
I'm going for a swim, 
don't anybody look.

1000
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,487
- You'll get indigestion!

1001
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,692
(dramatic music)

1002
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,803
- Axel, the water's wonderful.

1003
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,205
- Glauben, don't get 
too far from the raft.

1004
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:52,842
- Stone cold, Axel, come 
on in it's wonderful.

1005
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,511
- I've work to do!

1006
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,985
- Take down this sounding Axel.

1007
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,058
Oh!

1008
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:09,959
- Quick, grab him!

1009
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,895
- Axel, Hans, help me.

1010
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,138
- Teeth marks.

1011
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:26,476
- Good heavens, steel 
bitten right through.

1012
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,844
- Look!

1013
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,246
(roaring)

1014
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:31,114
- Monster.

1015
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,482
(roaring)

1016
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:33,950
Glauben, come back!

1017
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,152
(roaring)

1018
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,089
(gunshot)

1019
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,958
- [Otto] Glauben!

1020
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,227
- Come in Glauben!

1021
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,095
- Come on Glauben!

1022
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:50,600
(screaming) 
(roaring)

1023
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:58,741
Another one Hans!

1024
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,010
- Glauben, grab on!

1025
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,012
- Glauben, hurry, hurry!

1026
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:05,648
- [Otto] Try and get 
the rope Glauben!

1027
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:09,118
(roaring) 
Come on, swim girl.

1028
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:12,155
(roaring)

1029
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,023
Take my hand.

1030
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:14,924
- Alright?

1031
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,226
- I think so.

1032
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,628
(roaring)

1033
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:27,770
- Just look at them, two 
mythical enemies face to face.

1034
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,839
They existed on earth 
over a million years ago,

1035
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,574
and here we are seeing them.

1036
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,776
(roaring)

1037
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:37,614
- I'll bet you two gold 
mounts on the one on the left.

1038
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,282
- You'd lose Axel.

1039
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:43,586
It'll end in a draw, 
with both of them dead.

1040
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,788
(roaring)

1041
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,242
Give me the rifle Hans.

1042
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:07,710
We've gotta get out of 
here before the blood

1043
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,746
attracts other monsters.

1044
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,248
Pull the sail down, quickly. 
(roaring)

1045
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:16,185
Put the oars out, hurry. 
(roaring)

1046
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,155
Come on! 
(roaring)

1047
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,868
Get the oars out!

1048
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,945
(dramatic orchestral music)

1049
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,299
Professor, look over there!

1050
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,635
Looks like a giant whale!

1051
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:09,305
(dramatic orchestral music)

1052
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,076
- Looks like an 
island of some sort.

1053
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,344
- Shall we go and visit it?

1054
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:15,812
- Indeed, perhaps 
we could find some

1055
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:17,146
significant fossils there,

1056
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:18,848
Hans, steer towards it.

1057
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,918
(orchestral music)

1058
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,343
- Axel, pass that 
object to someone.

1059
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:50,346
(orchestral music)

1060
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,049
- Axel, help me.

1061
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:56,152
- Coming (mumbles).

1062
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,094
- Somebody must stay 
with the raft, you Hans.

1063
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,964
- Look at that smoke 
rising out of the ground.

1064
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,399
- Thermal heat 
escaping, no doubt.

1065
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,868
- And over there, 
looks lifeless.

1066
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:12,969
Olsen seems to 
take most interest

1067
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,404
in what seems least interesting.

1068
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:15,972
- I think he's quite 
a fascinating man.

1069
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,940
- And I think he doesn't 
know half as much

1070
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,242
as he thinks he does.

1071
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:20,743
- Neither do we.

1072
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,446
- I still haven't 
decided whether he's

1073
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,715
a man of method or madness.

1074
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:30,119
- Whatever his secret is, he 
keeps it in that metal box.

1075
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,422
- What I can't figure out is 
how he caused those explosions.

1076
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,258
- That's been 
puzzling me as well.

1077
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:38,995
Must keep a closer eye 
on him in the future.

1078
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:42,098
(electronic noises)

1079
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:45,368
- What strange rocks!

1080
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,937
- Look over here professor!

1081
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:50,073
A battalion of giant tortoises.

1082
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,141
- What an incredible sight.

1083
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:54,143
Fossils of a giant tortoise.

1084
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:57,313
They must have been here 
for centuries, amazing.

1085
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,015
- What a pity they're all dead.

1086
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,017
- It's better they are, 
could be dangerous.

1087
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,186
(strange noise)

1088
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,388
- What's that noise?

1089
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,090
You know I've never 
seen a dangerous turtle.

1090
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,025
- They must have been man 
eating, but they died of hunger.

1091
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,960
They were too slow 
to catch their prey.

1092
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,528
- Can you imagine what would 
happen if they surrounded us

1093
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:13,763
to attack us?

1094
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:14,363
- [Axel] Coward, 
after (mumbles).

1095
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:17,166
(strange noise)

1096
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:20,369
Huh, it moved, I swear it did!

1097
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,905
- Why, it seems to be alive!

1098
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,245
- (mumbles) They're not 
fossils, they are alive!

1099
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,247
They must sense a 
natural catastrophe.

1100
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,784
Back to the others, quickly, 
come on Glauben, quickly!

1101
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,420
(strange noise)

1102
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,157
Fast, come on!

1103
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,992
Quick as you can, come on!

1104
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:47,363
(anxious orchestral music)

1105
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,498
Get aboard Olsen!

1106
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:52,301
(anxious orchestral music)

1107
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,908
Get the oars out.

1108
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:02,512
(anxious orchestral music)

1109
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,419
Keep her steady now.

1110
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:13,556
(anxious orchestral music)

1111
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:16,592
(orchestral music)

1112
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,933
- [Axel] The weather 
has changed completely.

1113
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:25,434
The wind is blowing 
harder than ever,

1114
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,070
but the while atmosphere is 
saturated with electricity.

1115
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,306
I feel that some 
catastrophe is approaching.

1116
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,342
(orchestral music)

1117
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,198
Careful with the mast!

1118
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,333
Try and keep (mumbles).

1119
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,234
- Axel!

1120
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,037
Hold on to my arm!

1121
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,578
- Careful! 
(shouting)

1122
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,952
(screaming) 
Hold on, hold on!

1123
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,387
(wind howls)

1124
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,606
- You on those lines, 
shore those lines.

1125
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:40,943
(howling wind drowns out speech)

1126
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:36,966
- Hide your eyes.

1127
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:41,170
(howling wind drowns out speech)

1128
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:51,480
Get down!

1129
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,618
(howling wind drowns out speech)

1130
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,109
- Look out!

1131
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:24,347
(howling wind drowns out speech)

1132
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,788
- What's that?

1133
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,525
- A giant wave, here it comes.

1134
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,033
(screaming)

1135
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,047
Hans?

1136
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,356
Glauben, my dear child.

1137
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:10,559
Are you alright?

1138
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,098
- Axel, how is Axel?

1139
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,370
- We'll soon see.

1140
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,111
How do you feel lad?

1141
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:31,380
- Glauben, where's Glauben?

1142
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,617
- If the first thing you 
think about is each other,

1143
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,385
you must be alright.

1144
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,323
- Where are we?

1145
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,493
- Yes, where are we?

1146
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,430
- A rough calculation 
would put us somewhere

1147
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,565
beneath the surface of 
the Mediterranean Sea.

1148
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,101
Axel, if any of our instruments 
have survived intact,

1149
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:56,372
we'll soon know for sure, so 
we'd better start looking.

1150
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,243
- What about Olsen?

1151
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,180
- Yes, I forgot all about him.

1152
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,415
Have any of you 
seen him, anywhere?

1153
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,818
- Nowhere, but I found these.

1154
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,556
- Look at this, smashed!

1155
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,293
- What's the matter uncle Otto?

1156
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,862
- Look at this mess.

1157
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:21,797
Raft all smashed to pieces,

1158
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,300
my precious instruments broken,

1159
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,735
we don't even know where we are!

1160
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,571
It's enough to make 
any man despair.

1161
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:31,140
- It's not your 
fault uncle Otto,

1162
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:35,811
under the earth you have 
to expect the unexpected.

1163
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,780
- Yes you're right 
my dear child,

1164
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,515
as always, you're 
perfectly right.

1165
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,750
Nothing is going to prevent me

1166
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,920
making this appointment 
with history.

1167
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:49,492
- That's more like your 
old self uncle Otto.

1168
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:50,826
- Look professor.

1169
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:54,563
Olsen's books about the storm.

1170
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:59,401
- That's peculiar, 
it's in Attic Greek.

1171
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,439
All about time and space.

1172
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,342
- Never mind the book, let's 
go look for it's owner.

1173
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:10,613
- Well for heaven's sake 
don't get lost, be careful.

1174
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,953
(grunting)

1175
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,625
(anxious music)

1176
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:43,479
- How strange, there's nothing 
but bones all around us.

1177
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,483
- We've discovered a 
prehistoric cemetery for animals

1178
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:49,552
apparently, what's that?

1179
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,522
- The femur of some kind 
of primate I should think.

1180
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,424
- Prehistoric graveyard or not,

1181
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,560
how do we know that 
some of these animals

1182
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:02,498
might not have a few living 
descendants around here?

1183
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:05,601
- Look over there, 
dinosaur's teeth.

1184
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:10,272
We must take samples 
back for uncle Otto.

1185
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:13,542
- It's a molar, with a cavity.

1186
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,612
(orchestral music)

1187
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:22,351
Glauben, look, what 
a strange forest.

1188
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:24,987
(orchestral music)

1189
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:28,557
- Everything we 
encounter now is strange.

1190
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,326
And the further on we go,

1191
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:31,794
the stranger it will get.

1192
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,797
(orchestral music)

1193
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:50,679
- Like a dream.

1194
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:52,281
- Yes.

1195
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,350
- I think we've come far enough.

1196
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,885
- I just knew you were 
going to say that.

1197
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:59,788
- Now look, we've come deeper,

1198
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,757
and stayed longer than 
anyone else in history.

1199
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,892
We've more than paid 
our dues to science.

1200
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:06,662
- Axel, what do you want?

1201
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,430
- I want to convince your uncle

1202
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,300
that we should look 
for a way out of here.

1203
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,769
- But why, it's unlikely 
we'll come back you see.

1204
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:17,673
- Because I want to 
marry you, that's why.

1205
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,308
- Oh Axel.

1206
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:20,643
- And a prehistoric bone 
yard is no fit place

1207
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,311
to bring up babies.

1208
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:22,978
- Babies?

1209
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,581
Oh Axel.

1210
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:31,720
(roaring)

1211
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:35,024
- Monkey!

1212
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:40,629
(roaring) 
- It's our only chance!

1213
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:51,674
(roaring) 
(dramatic music)

1214
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:57,012
- Axel!

1215
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:00,416
(roaring)

1216
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:08,657
(screaming) 
(roaring)

1217
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,903
- Put us back on the roots!

1218
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:25,407
(screaming) 
(roaring)

1219
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:37,920
Now, get out.

1220
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:44,927
(anxious music) 
(roaring)

1221
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:57,773
- Axel, Glauben, over here!

1222
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:03,879
(roaring)

1223
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,414
Into the cave!

1224
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,616
(roaring)

1225
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:17,793
That way.

1226
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,995
(roaring)

1227
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,701
Back through here.

1228
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:26,869
- Where are we going?

1229
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,036
- Just follow me.

1230
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,572
(roaring)

1231
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:34,042
(anxious music)

1232
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:36,578
- What in the world is that?

1233
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,529
- Why Olsen, all those--

1234
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,565
- Better not to ask Glauben.

1235
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,467
Certain concepts are 
not yet within the range

1236
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,469
of human comprehension.

1237
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,472
- I simply can't believe it.

1238
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,007
- Just a moment,

1239
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,609
now look, you must say a 
promise not to say a single word

1240
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,845
to your uncle, about 
what we've seen here.

1241
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:12,581
Because then he'd 
never want to leave.

1242
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,850
- I promise, I promise.

1243
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,051
- Alright.

1244
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:16,952
- Come along.

1245
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:19,788
(anxious music)

1246
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,063
(roaring) 
(screaming)

1247
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:29,665
- Out!

1248
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:31,867
(roaring)

1249
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,274
Dinosaurs!

1250
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,876
- I can't believe my eyes!

1251
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,078
(roaring)

1252
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:48,550
We'll have to return 
the way we came.

1253
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,752
(roaring)

1254
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:02,865
(roaring)

1255
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,236
Professor!

1256
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,238
- Uncle Otto we've got Olsen!

1257
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,606
- Come on!

1258
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:11,707
Olsen, hurry!

1259
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:20,315
Come on!

1260
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:35,797
- [Axel] And thus we 
continued our adventure,

1261
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:38,667
on the subterranean sea.

1262
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,769
The professor does not wish 
to leave one single stone

1263
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:43,272
unturned in his 
quest for knowledge

1264
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,073
of this strange universe.

1265
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:48,644
However, I perceived a 
subtle change in him,

1266
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,580
from the moment he began 
to real Olsen's book.

1267
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:52,881
- Olsen!

1268
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,349
- Yes sir?

1269
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:57,686
- This book of yours that 
was washed ashore with us.

1270
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:00,822
It claims that time is 
relative, not absolute.

1271
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:02,658
- The claim 
unfortunately is true.

1272
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,761
I've tested the theory 
myself, somewhat to my regret.

1273
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,163
I learned that under 
certain circumstances,

1274
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,364
one can indeed 
move through time,

1275
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:12,301
as easily as one 
can through space.

1276
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,036
- A year ago I might 
not have believed you

1277
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:17,139
but after the mysteries and 
experiences of this voyage.

1278
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,974
- Even in your normal 
world on the surface,

1279
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:22,077
there are mysteries 
you've never dreamed of.

1280
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,746
- One thing still puzzles me.

1281
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,815
We're living in the 
year '98 are we not?

1282
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,050
- Indeed you are.

1283
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:31,286
- Yet the publication 
of this book is 1914.

1284
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,755
That's nearly 20 years 
ahead in the future.

1285
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,390
How do you account for that.

1286
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:38,026
- Why, proof of the 
pudding professor.

1287
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:40,228
Or could it be a misprint?

1288
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:45,033
- I only know I'd give my soul 
to own a device like that,

1289
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,635
with all it's secrets.

1290
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:49,905
- It's the only one in 
existence my dear Lindenbrock.

1291
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:52,274
And you've no idea 
of it's capabilities.

1292
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,143
It could even transport 
one to the moon.

1293
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:57,913
- Professor, the sea has ended.

1294
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:09,124
- What is it?

1295
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,681
Look, we can't go any further!

1296
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,316
- Let's go.

1297
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,717
- Looks like some 
sort of grotto.

1298
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,786
- Keep us straight Hans.

1299
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,789
- There's no way out.

1300
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,859
Look how dark it is.

1301
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:48,263
We'll never find 
our way out of here.

1302
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:49,798
- Then we'll have to turn back.

1303
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:51,299
- Turn back, never.

1304
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:53,935
Try and secure it 
to that rock Hans.

1305
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:57,005
Take the lamp thank you Glauben.

1306
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,474
These rocks are very slippery.

1307
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:06,148
- Professor, look at this.

1308
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:10,152
- Saknussemm, once again 
showing us the way forward.

1309
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:14,389
Now we must try and force our 
way through this wall of rock.

1310
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:18,827
- But suppose there's 
nothing behind it,

1311
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:20,295
but another endless sea.

1312
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:22,497
- Then it's our 
duty to find out.

1313
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:25,133
We must get ahead 
as far as possible.

1314
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,069
- It's useless professor.

1315
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:29,137
You're not even 
making a dent in it.

1316
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:30,939
- Then I'll try even harder.

1317
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,374
We must get ahead.

1318
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,344
- Be reasonable uncle Otto.

1319
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,080
The task is impossible.

1320
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,848
- In the search for 
truth my dear child,

1321
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:41,883
(mumbles) nothing is impossible.

1322
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:43,819
Now please stand back.

1323
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,803
- Uncle Otto, uncle Otto.

1324
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,110
Can't you stop him.

1325
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:10,912
- What can I do?

1326
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,923
- Olsen, only you can get 
us out of this plight.

1327
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:23,024
Do something.

1328
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,494
- If you wish.

1329
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,831
Professor, professor.

1330
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,168
Your dedication is admirable,

1331
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:35,504
but this is a task that 
I alone can accomplish.

1332
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:37,339
Get back on the raft.

1333
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,910
- What are you going to do?

1334
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,080
- Keep the raft as far back 
as you can from this point.

1335
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,915
This will only 
take a few moments.

1336
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:49,885
- Olsen, what about you?

1337
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,420
- I told you long ago.

1338
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,022
I found my own way in,

1339
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:57,092
I'll find my own way out again.

1340
01:19:57,092 --> 01:20:00,128
(melancholy music)

1341
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:25,620
Godspeed, never forget.

1342
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:29,524
(melancholy music)

1343
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,565
- I'll remember you Olsen.

1344
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,601
(melancholy music)

1345
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:50,979
(dramatic music)

1346
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:16,538
- I don't see anything 
strange happening.

1347
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:21,676
(shouting) 
(water roaring)

1348
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:07,255
- [Glauben] We're 
rising up above!

1349
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:10,058
(water roaring)

1350
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:26,641
(coughing)

1351
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,645
- Glauben, what's the matter?

1352
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:32,013
- I'm choking.

1353
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:36,318
- So am I, so let's build fast.

1354
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:39,487
- Get the gas 
masks, sulfur fumes!

1355
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:42,223
(wind howling)

1356
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,769
- Hurry, that's an 
earthquake warning

1357
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,338
if ever I heard one!

1358
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:59,107
(wind howling)

1359
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,225
- That way professor!

1360
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:19,794
(wind howling)

1361
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,235
- Professor!

1362
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:01,369
Like a sheep.

1363
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:04,572
- Shoo, shoo.

1364
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:06,174
- Hey little boy.

1365
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:11,579
Where are we, he 
doesn't understand.

1366
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,782
Where are we, tell us!

1367
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,550
- Try other languages.

1368
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,720
(speaks foreign language)

1369
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,656
- Listen, listen little 
boy, where are we?

1370
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,191
Answer me!

1371
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:24,692
Answer!

1372
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,661
(speaking foreign language)

1373
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:29,364
(speaking foreign language)

1374
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:30,765
(speaking foreign language)

1375
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:33,501
- Somebody, somebody, somebody!

1376
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:46,347
- Hans, we've lost Hans!

1377
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:48,283
Hans!

1378
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:58,760
Come on Hans, we're 
(mumbles) Glauben.

1379
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:04,532
(shouting)

1380
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:07,902
Boy!

1381
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,241
- Hurry!

1382
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,723
(screaming)

1383
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,953
(melancholy music)

1384
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:16,464
- [Axel] And thus ended 
our fantastic voyage.

1385
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:18,733
Hans went back to Iceland,

1386
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,803
where his flock now 
numbers more than 100 head.

1387
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,905
(orchestral music)

1388
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,274
He is a respected man, 
and is often visited

1389
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,909
by his loving cousins.

1390
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,945
(orchestral music)

1391
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,850
Glauben and I have 
undertaken a new adventure.

1392
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:37,352
That of matrimony.

1393
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:38,920
(orchestral music)

1394
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,889
A woman cannot do without the 
support of an experienced man,

1395
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,459
a man with foresight.

1396
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:47,061
(orchestral music)

1397
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:50,398
As for the professor, 
he continues to

1398
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:51,833
visit the old book shop.

1399
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,768
With who knows what remote 
expectations in mind.

1400
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:54,802
- Morning.

1401
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:56,738
- Good day professor.

1402
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:59,974
Somebody left this 
parcel for you.

1403
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:01,643
- Me, when?

1404
