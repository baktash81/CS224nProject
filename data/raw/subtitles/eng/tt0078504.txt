1
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Oh, hello there, honey!

2
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,760
- Nice to see you!
- This is my son.

3
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,160
How do you do?
Dorothy, this here's Gil Warren.

4
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,760
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you.

5
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,160
Don't worry, Gil.
She's just shy.

6
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,960
I brought you some tea.

7
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,480
Look! Here they come.
Come on, they're coming!

8
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,240
Shh.

9
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,920
We're getting ready
to set the table.

10
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,680
Take these checkers someplace else.
Here, you take these.

11
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,720
Come on, Henry, be careful.

12
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,120
Come on.

13
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,720
- Oh, man, you always drop the checkers when I'm...
- That's the way you win!

14
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,080
Toto! Toto! Toto baby!

15
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,960
# Put your arms around me, child #

16
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,120
# Like when you bumped your shin #

17
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,200
# Then you'll know
I love you now #

18
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,000
# As I loved you then #

19
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,040
# Though you may be
trying sometimes #

20
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,600
# And I need you
and you're not there #

21
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,640
# You know I may get mad #

22
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,000
# And turn away #

23
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,120
# But you know that I still care #

24
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,080
# Don't lose the feeling that we have #

25
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,920
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

26
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,640
# Though you're growin' older now #

27
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,240
# And I'm watching you grow #

28
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,120
# I know I make you
sad sometimes #

29
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,800
# And I see your feelings show #

30
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,280
# But one day I'll look around #

31
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,400
# Yeah #

32
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,360
# And you will be grown #

33
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,520
# You'll be out in the world
such a pretty girl #

34
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,080
# But you'll be on your own #

35
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,360
# And I'd like to know it's there #

36
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,360
# The feelin' that we have #

37
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,120
# Knowing that you
can come to me #

38
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,920
# Whenever you are sad #

39
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,160
# Child, I'd like
to know it's there #

40
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,720
# The feeling that we have #

41
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,840
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

42
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,320
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

43
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,760
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

44
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,880
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

45
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,800
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

46
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,880
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

47
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,640
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

48
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
# Don't lose the feeling ##

49
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,560
# Lose it #

50
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,680
# Lose it #

51
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,320
# I don't even know
the first thing #

52
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,320
# About what they're feelin' #

53
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,640
# What am I afraid of #

54
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,400
# Don't know what I'm made of #

55
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
# Can I go on #

56
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,040
# Not knowin' #

57
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,960
# Feelin', feelin' #

58
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,120
# Somethin' tells me
that it's more than I #

59
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,240
# Can deal with #

60
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,280
# Though I never knew the song #

61
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,680
# Some words still catch on #

62
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,400
# Like carin' #

63
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,120
# And sharin' #

64
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,720
# Being together #

65
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,440
# No matter #

66
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,040
# Can I go on #

67
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,200
# Not knowin' #

68
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,320
# Don't know what I'm made of #

69
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,200
# Why am I afraid of #

70
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,680
# Feelin' #

71
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,200
# Feelin' #

72
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,080
# If I dared to take a chance #

73
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,360
# Would someone #

74
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:05,920
# Lead me ##

75
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Emergency snow alert is now in effect.

76
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,400
No automobiles are to be driven
without snow tires or chains.

77
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,080
Winds up to 45 miles per hour...

78
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,280
That was a great dinner, Emma.

79
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,280
- That baby!
- You're a grandpa!

80
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,600
- Our daughter's fine.
- Mmm.

81
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,120
But Dorothy.

82
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,880
Give her time, honey.

83
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,360
Give her time.

84
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,400
Those dishes
ain't gonna wash themselves.

85
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,520
Mrs. Warren's son
looks real fine, don't he?

86
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Aunt Em, please,
no more matchmaking.

87
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,000
Did you make the decision
about that new school yet?

88
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,440
It's no decision to make.

89
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,280
But, honey, it's a chance
to teach in high school.

90
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
Get away from that kindergarten
once and for all. It's more money.

91
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,120
But besides the money, it's a chance
for you to be with older students.

92
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Almost adults.

93
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,280
- I like it with the kids, Aunt Em.
- I know you do, honey.

94
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
And you're a fine teacher.

95
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,440
But that's why I think you'd
enjoy teachin' high school.

96
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,160
Have a chance to be with
the students for four years...

97
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,280
...such an important time
in their development.

98
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm really happy
with the kids, Aunt Em.

99
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,680
But you been there
for three years already.

100
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,520
It's time you got out of that sandbox and
into some new people, new neighborhood.

101
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,400
Girl, do you know you're
24 years old and you've...

102
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,600
Never been south of 125th Street?

103
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,880
Well, you haven't.

104
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,480
Oh, here we go again.
You get me so worked up...

105
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
...that I'm beginning
to sound like a Jewish mother.

106
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,200
I can't see how goin' south of 125th
Street ever made anybody's life better.

107
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,920
And you're never gonna know
unless you try, are you?

108
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,600
And you're never gonna know
unless you try, are you?

109
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,560
Come on, Aunt Em, let me do that.

110
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,280
Why don't you go in and relax?
I can do... Let me do that.

111
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,840
Listen, I know gettin' out
in that world ain't easy...

112
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,360
...leaving Uncle Henry and me.

113
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,400
But we'll always be here
for ya, Dorothy.

114
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,800
And whatever your fears are, well...

115
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,920
...they'll be defeated just
by facing up to 'em.

116
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,400
Now, you take that new job
and find a place for you and Toto.

117
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,880
It's time for you
to make a home of your own.

118
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,680
Toto! Oh! Toto!

119
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,640
Toto! Toto!

120
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,640
Toto!

121
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,800
Toto! Oh! Toto!

122
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,200
Toto!

123
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Toto!

124
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,560
Toto!

125
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,200
Toto! Toto!

126
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,200
# La, la, la, la, la #

127
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,360
# La, la, la, la #

128
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,440
Toto! Where are you?

129
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,600
Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto!

130
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,640
Oh!

131
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,200
Toto, Toto.

132
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,200
- Toto, Toto.
- To... To... Toto!

133
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,240
- Toto, Toto. Toto, Toto.
- To... To... To...

134
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,800
- Toto! -
Toto! - Toto!

135
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,120
- Toto! -
Toto! - Toto!

136
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,040
God, where am I?

137
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,440
Toto! Toto!

138
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,200
Toto! Toto!

139
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,720
Two, two, two, two,
two, two, two, two!

140
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,920
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?

141
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,080
No! No!

142
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,400
- Relax, Mama!
- We just wanna lay a little thanks on ya.

143
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,880
- What?
- You know, heavy on the gratitude department.

144
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,240
- Gratitude? For what?
- For curling the curse.

145
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,560
- For leveling the leech.
- For killing our oppressor.

146
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,920
Uh! I never killed
nothin' in my life.

147
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,320
- Never killed the point?
- A pint?

148
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,640
- A good story?
- The umpire?

149
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,200
- No!
- Never killed no time?

150
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,800
No, I told you!
I never killed nothin'!

151
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,800
Well, then, I think you graduated...

152
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
...from the bush leagues
into the majors, girl.

153
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,560
Toto?

154
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,880
Can you dig this?

155
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,760
- Who is it?
- Ain't no more "is"!

156
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,800
Thanks to you, it's a "was"!

157
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,640
- She was Evermean.
- The Wicked Witch from the East.

158
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,680
And they didn't
call her Evermean for nothin'!

159
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,880
She was the parks department
commissioner!

160
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,000
Caught us paintin' on
her playground walls.

161
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,240
- Turned us into graffiti!
- And there we stayed.

162
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,640
- Flat, splat and stuck like that!
- Doomed as cartoons forever.

163
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,320
'Til you burned alphabet
through the sky and ended the curse.

164
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,160
- And the "curseress. "
- Givin' a new lease on life to us...

165
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,440
The Munchkins, most recently
referred to as the "cursees. "

166
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Toto.

167
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,120
Let's hear it for
Super Witch and her Wonder Dog!

168
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,120
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?

169
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,840
Miss One!

170
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,640
Come to Mama,
you hot little digits!

171
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Let me lay my 20-20s on ya!

172
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,120
Oh, how I love you!
Let me... Mmm!

173
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,120
Count the ways!
Oh, mmm! Mmm!

174
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,040
Innumerable blessings,
countless felicitations.

175
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,960
Thank you beyond number
and additional good stuff!

176
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,560
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to kill her.

177
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,400
Oh, don't be
all sixes and sevens, honey.

178
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,880
You did the world a multitudinous
service by 86ing ol' Evermean.

179
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,080
Bottom line, honey,
this chick put the "ugh" in ugly.

180
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,920
But she sure had pretty shoes,
didn't she? Yah!

181
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,560
I don't want these shoes.
I wanna go home.

182
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,320
I wouldn't discount
those shoes, honey.

183
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,920
And don't ever take 'em off
until you do get home.

184
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,760
Remember Miss One told ya.
Oh, pardon me.

185
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,280
Miss One's the name
if you haven't guessed by now.

186
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,080
Numbers is my game
and now that you've freed us...

187
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,920
we can all go back to
runnin' our business, ahem.

188
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,840
We can all go back to
runnin' our business.

189
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,920
We can all go back to
runnin' our business.

190
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,440
But where am I?
Where am I?

191
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,520
You're in Munchkin Land!

192
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,440
- The indivisible Land of Oz!
- Oz?

193
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,240
But where's my home?
Where's Aunt Em? Where's New York?

194
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
- New York?
- 433 Prospect Place.

195
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,920
Ooh! Four, three, three.

196
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,040
You wanna play more than
one number today, honey?

197
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,560
I got a freedom special,
three numbers for the price...

198
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,160
No, I don't wanna play any numbers.
I just wanna get home!

199
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,200
Oh, well, now that ol'
Evermean's number's up...

200
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,680
...that leaves only
three witches in Oz.

201
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,000
One, myself, but my powers
don't amount to much.

202
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,040
And number two, Glinda,
the Good Witch of the South.

203
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Oh, she's a real star,
but you can hardly catch her in.

204
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,640
And number three, the multi-horrored
Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West.

205
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,320
Evermean's even uglier sister!

206
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,320
But I don't think it'd be
a good time to ask her for a favor.

207
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
So I figured the odds are only the Wiz
could cipher how to get you back to...

208
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,360
So I figured the odds are only the Wiz
could cipher how to get you back to...

209
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,000
- Where'd you say that place was?
- The Wiz?

210
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,360
What's a Wiz?

211
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,840
What's a... What's a Wiz?

212
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,200
Oh, darlin', he's the ultimate.

213
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,800
The "X" quotient, the new math.

214
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,200
The common denominator,
the main man.

215
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,840
The head honcho!
Bottom line, honey.

216
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,000
Numero uno!

217
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,240
- Where is he? How do I find him?
- Catch this number, honey.

218
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,280
# Sweet thing
let me tell you about #

219
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,240
# The world and
the way things are now #

220
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,360
# You've come from
a different place #

221
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,600
# And I know you've
traveled far #

222
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,520
# Now that you've told me
what it is #

223
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,920
# I better point you
towards the Wiz #

224
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,240
- # He's the Wiz #
- # He's the man He's the only one #

225
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,560
# Who can give your wish
right to ya #

226
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,120
# He'll send you back
through time #

227
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,560
# By runnin' magic through ya #

228
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,480
# All of his super power's his #

229
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,880
# Dot dot da dot da #

230
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,120
# Listen and I'll tell you
where he is #

231
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,640
# He's the Wiz and he lives #

232
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,240
# In Oz #

233
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,960
- # He's the Wizard #
- # There's the way #

234
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,040
# To the Emerald City
That's not too far, is it #

235
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,920
- # He's the Wizard #
- # Just take your dilemma, child #

236
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,280
# And lay it on the Wizard #

237
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,760
# He'll fix you a drink
that'll bubble and foam #

238
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,240
# Dot dot da dot da #

239
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,200
# And in a flash
you will be home #

240
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,400
- # He's the Wiz #
- # He's the Wiz He's the Wizard of Oz #

241
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,600
- # He's got magic up his sleeve #
- # He's the Wizard #

242
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,080
# And you know without his help #

243
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,040
# It would be
impossible to leave #

244
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,080
# Fantastic powers
at his command #

245
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Whoo!

246
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,440
# And I'm sure
that he will understand #

247
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,560
# He's the Wiz and he lives #

248
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,400
# In Oz #

249
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,720
# Sweet thing, let me tell you about #

# And I'd better point ya

252
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,280
Whee! Ooh!

253
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,760
Whee!

254
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,760
He's the Wiz!

255
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,160
# Fantastic powers at his command #

256
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,280
# I'm sure that

257
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,800
# He's the Wiz and he lives #

258
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,000
# In Oz #

259
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,360
# Sweet thing
let me tell you about #

# I'd better point you

264
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,880
# Dot dot da dot da
dot dot da dot da #

265
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
# He's the Wiz ##

266
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
But how do I get
to the Emerald City?

267
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,720
Count your blessings, cut your losses
and follow the Yellow Brick Road.

268
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,720
- The Yellow Brick Road?
Yeah! The Yellow Brick Road!

269
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,840
Yellow Brick. Toto!

270
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,640
Remember, don't ever take those shoes
off and watch out for the poison poppies!

271
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,760
Wait.

272
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,480
Miss One?

273
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Miss One?

274
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,640
Miss One!

275
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,440
Miss One!

276
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,920
# There's a feeling #

277
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,120
# Here inside #

278
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,720
# That I cannot hide #

279
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,760
# And I know I've tried #

280
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,440
# But it's turning me #

281
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,480
# Around #

282
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,960
# I'm not sure that I'm aware #

283
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,240
# If I'm up or down #

284
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,000
# Or here or there #

285
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,960
# I need both feet
on the ground #

286
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,440
# Maybe I'm just goin' crazy #

287
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,440
# Lettin' myself get uptight #

288
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,000
# I'm actin' just like a baby #

289
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,440
# But I'm gonna be #

290
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,040
# I'm gonna be all right #

291
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,160
# Soon as I get home #

292
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,040
# Soon as I get home #

293
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:14,360
# Soon as I get home #

294
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,240
# In a different place #

295
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
# In a different time #

296
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,200
# Different people around me #

297
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,840
# I would like to know #

298
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,760
# Of their different world and how #

299
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,200
# Different they find me #

300
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,000
# And just what's a Wiz #

301
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,240
# Is he big
Will he scare me #

302
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,040
# If I ask to leave #

303
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,080
# Will the Wiz even hear me #

304
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,680
# How will I know then #

305
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,080
# If I'll ever get home again #

306
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,680
# Here I am alone
though it feels the same #

307
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,320
# I don't know where I'm goin' #

308
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,480
# I'm here on my own
and it's not a game #

309
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,160
# And a strange #

310
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,960
# Wind is blowin' #

311
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,880
# I'm so amazed at the things
that I see here #

312
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,880
# Don't wanna be afraid
I just don't wanna be here #

313
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,680
# In my mind this is clear #

314
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,440
# What am I doin' #

315
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,320
# Here #

316
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,480
# I wish #

317
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,160
# I was home #

318
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,000
# I wish, I wish #

319
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,240
# I wish I was ##

320
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Wait! Mister, please wait!

321
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Succulent and divine!

322
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,400
- Delicious and nutritious.
- Brother crows, this is good stuff!

323
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,480
I'm glad you fellows
are enjoying your breakfast.

324
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,720
Is today the day you're gonna
help me get down from here?

325
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,880
Help you down?

326
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,240
What is goin' down in
that hayloft you call a head?

327
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,600
Didn't we tell you yesterday
and the day before that...

328
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,440
- And the day before that...
- That you can't get down?

329
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,600
This is your life,
buddy, all hung up!

330
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,920
Besides, Clyde...

331
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,800
...us crows are just thinkin' of you.

332
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,920
There ain't nothin'
to get down for!

333
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,440
But I was
just thinkin', just once, fellas...

334
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,360
...for a little while to walk in my garden,
wouldn't that be terrific?

335
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,160
- Walk!
- You can't walk!

336
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,440
Why, you just
a straw paper dummy!

337
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,720
You're right, fellas.
I was just bein' selfish.

338
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,320
And stupid as usual!

339
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,000
- But I was readin' this morning that most people...
- Oh, man!

340
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,840
Look, didn't we tell you
readin' was a waste of time?

341
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,680
- But Bacon here said...
- Bacon? Once over lightly, please!

342
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,040
"Knowledge is power. "

343
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,320
- See, and, uh, Cicero, he said...
- Cicero-ro-row!

344
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,880
"More men are ennobled
by study than by nature. "

345
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,640
And over here, especially
apropos in my situation...

346
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,000
...i. E., stuck up on this here pole:

347
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,040
"Do not accept any situation.
Question, argue and explore. "

348
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,840
Now who you gonna believe?

349
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,400
- Mr. Nobody on that paper?
- Fellas, please!

350
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,440
Or your good friends, the crows?

351
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,320
Yeah, who have dedicated
their lives to educatin' you.

352
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,760
- Yeah!
- Sounds to me, fellas...

353
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,040
...like ol' garbage guts here done forgot
the crow commandments again.

354
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,840
Fellas, I did not forget
the crow commandments. Please!

355
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,120
Run 'em by me!
Run 'em by me.

356
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,520
- Thou shalt honor all crows.
- Right on!

357
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,520
- Proceed!
- Thou shalt stop readin' all bits of paper and literature.

358
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,520
- Trash! Trash!
- And the most important one!

359
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,400
Thou shalt never, never get down
off of this here pole!

360
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,120
You got it, Clyde!

361
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,480
And the crow anthem!

362
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,040
I gotta sing that thing again?

363
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,520
# You gotta libretti it
'til you get it #

364
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
- # Elucidate #
- # Reiterate #

365
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,160
# And syncopate #

366
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,240
# You can't win
You can't break even #

367
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,720
# And you can't get
outta the game #

368
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,360
# People keep sayin' #

369
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,160
# Things are gonna change
but they look just like #

370
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,400
# They're stayin' the same #

371
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,760
# You get in way over your head #

372
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,000
# And you only got yourself
to blame #

373
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,840
- # You can't win, child #
- # You can't win, child #

374
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,200
# You can't break even #

375
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,600
# You can't get outta the game #

376
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,960
# You can't win
The world keeps movin' #

377
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,400
# And you're standin' far behind #

378
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,920
# People keep sayin' #

379
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,200
- # Things'll get better #
- # Just to ease your state of mind #

380
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,120
# So you lean back #

381
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,280
# And you smoke that smoke #

382
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,040
# And you drink
your glass of wine #

383
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,160
# Sayin' you can't win
child #

384
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,320
# You can't break even #

385
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,520
# And you can't get
outta the game #

386
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
# You can't win #

387
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,720
# You can't win no way
if your story stays the same #

388
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
- # You ain't winnin' #
- # Oh, no #

389
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,360
# But I'd like to see you
I'm awfully glad you came #

390
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,360
# Better cool it
'cause it ain't about losin' #

391
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,760
# Then the world
has got no shame #

392
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,840
# You can't win, child #

393
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,040
# Can't break even
Can't get outta the game #

394
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,320
# You can't win
You can't break even #

395
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,920
# Ain't the way
it's supposed to be #

396
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,600
- # You'll be spendin' your little bit of money #
- # Oh, no #

397
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,200
# While someone else
rides for free #

398
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,760
- # Learned your lesson #
- Ooh!

399
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,720
# Refuel your mind before some turkey
blows out your flame #

400
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,920
- # And you can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #

401
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,560
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #

402
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,720
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #

403
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,240
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #

404
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,640
# You can't win, child
Can't break even #

405
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,240
# And you can't get
outta the game #

406
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,760
# You can't get outta the game #

407
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,080
# You can't get out #

408
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
Ooh!

409
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,840
# Of the game #

410
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,080
# No, no, no ##

411
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,840
- I'll, I'll help you down.
- What?

412
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,280
You will?

413
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,400
What's she doing here?

414
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,000
- Get her outta here.
- Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

415
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,800
Shoo, shoo,
go on about your business.

416
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,600
Shoo!

417
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,560
Ooh!

418
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,040
- Just hold on.
- This is just an experiment.

419
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,120
The results of
the first experiment:

420
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,320
Subject is a hopeless failure.

421
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,640
- You are not.
- I am.

422
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,320
You're just a product
of some negative thinking.

423
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,160
First thing we have to do
is get rid of these crows.

424
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,680
Come on, Toto, sic 'em!
Shoo! Shoo!

425
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,840
Shoo! Before I call
the taxidermist, you turkeys!

426
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,920
Get off me, dog!

427
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,680
Good boy, Toto.

428
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,680
We can go now.

429
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,320
You okay?
Come on! Hey!

430
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,440
Ooh!

431
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,920
I think I'm gonna
make it this time.

432
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,920
You sure are.

433
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,040
Just a little self-confidence...

434
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,400
...and coordination.

435
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,960
You're gonna be fine.

436
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,080
You mean, all this time
the only thing standing between...

437
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,000
...hangin' up there
and livin' it up down here...

438
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,640
were those crows?

439
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,000
Well, they told you you couldn't do it
and you believed them.

440
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,800
If I only had a brain, I would have
figured that out a long time ago.

441
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,040
There you go with that
negative thinkin' again.

442
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,720
- Everybody has a brain.
- Uh-uh.

443
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,520
Not me, look.

444
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,760
Oh.

445
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,040
Garbage?

446
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,960
"Lgnorance is the night
of the mind...

447
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,400
...a night without moon or star. "

448
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,920
Confucius said that.

449
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,280
I'm on my way to find the Wiz.

450
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,240
He's gonna get me back home.

451
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,840
That's nice. Thank you.

452
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,600
Good luck.

453
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,480
I thought maybe he
could get you a brain.

454
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,120
You think that he could...

455
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,920
And Toto and me,
we could sure use some company.

456
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,440
Besides, you have nothin' to lose.

457
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,080
I don't, do I?
That was so smart of you!

458
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,040
I wish I thought of that.

459
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,800
Indications are it would be
very advantageous for me to join you.

460
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
Good.

461
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,200
Um, we only have one problem.

462
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,880
The Munchkins said to follow the Yellow Brick
Road, but I haven't been able to find it.

463
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,480
- Yellow Brick Road?
- There it is!

464
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,560
Hey, wait! Wait!

465
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,200
Did you say, "Yellow Brick Road"?

466
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,640
- Yes!
- Look over here!

467
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,560
We don't need no cabs.

468
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,880
- Say, what's your name?
- My name is... Dorothy.

469
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,800
Dorothy and Toto?
What intelligent names!

470
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,360
Okay, Dorothy and Toto, we're gonna have
to find our own Yellow Brick Road.

471
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,080
# Ease on down
Ease on dow... #

472
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,560
- Down the road!
- There it is!

473
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,400
# Ease on down #

474
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,640
- Oh!
- # Ease on... Down #

475
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,080
- Down the road!
- Oh!

476
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,960
# Don't you carry nothin' #

477
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,640
- # That might be a load #
- There it is!

478
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,640
Dorothy! Look! Dorothy!

479
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,400
Aaah!

480
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,080
Ta-da!

481
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,400
Whoo! Come on, Dorothy!
Come on!

482
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,600
Whoo!

483
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,240
# Come on and ease on down
ease on down the road #

484
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,240
# Come on, ease on down

# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

487
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,480
# Pick your left foot up
put your right one down #

488
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
# Come on, legs
keep movin' #

489
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,560
# Don't you lose no ground #

490
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,280
# Just you keep on keepin'
on the road you choose #

491
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,600
# Don't you give up on walkin'
'cause you gave up shoes #

492
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,960
# Ease on down
Ease on down the road #

493
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,840
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

494
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,000
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

495
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,240
# Come on, ease on down
down, down #

496
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,440
Whoo!

497
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,600
Whoo!

498
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,560
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

499
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,600
# Ease on down, ease on down

# Ease on down
ease, ease on down #

508
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,720
- # Down the road ##
- Help!

509
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,480
Help!

510
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,800
Help?

511
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,240
Help? Where?

512
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,160
Help! Help!

513
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,680
Over here!

514
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,240
Help!

515
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,040
Hurry! Hurry!

516
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,200
- Where are you?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

517
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,400
Step right up and save a life!

518
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,800
Ooh! Ooh!

519
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,440
I'm in a little bit of a squeeze,
brother. Can you give me a hand?

520
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,160
Dorothy?

521
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,600
Oh, how terrible.

522
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,280
- Don't move.
- Don't worry, I wasn't planning any promenades.

523
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,560
We'll be right back.

524
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,800
Oh, he's so brave.

525
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,960
He's probably in shock.

526
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,400
Oh, what I wouldn't
give to be in shock... Just once.

527
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,080
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

528
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,560
No apology necessary. I told you
nothing hurts me. I have no feelings.

529
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,880
The genius who created me only
took care of my dashing good looks...

530
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,400
...my razor sharp wit and my irresistible
attraction to the wrong women.

531
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,400
What he forgot to add...

532
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,640
was a heart.

533
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,840
But... Everyone has a heart.

534
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,480
Alas, everyone but yours truly.

535
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,040
Hello!

536
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,080
Nobody home in Soulville.

537
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,960
Rid of you!
Free from your posterior prison!

538
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,800
You hulking she devil!

539
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,200
Don't hear ya laughing now.

540
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,520
We were abandoned here when
this park went "el foldo. "

541
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,320
Ah, it was a sad day.

542
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,840
There's not much amusement to
the closing down of an amusement park.

543
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,840
But yours truly is an old trooper!

544
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,200
I quickly made plans
for the future.

545
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,000
But alas, I was felled
by my 4th wife, Teenie.

546
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,440
Crushed in my prime!

547
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,080
There, how does that feel?

548
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,920
But that's the whole
tragic point, my friends.

549
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,960
# What would I do #

550
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,160
# If I could suddenly feel #

551
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,640
# And to know once again #

552
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,440
# That what I feel is real #

553
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,200
# I could cry
I could smile #

554
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,800
# I might lay back
for a while #

555
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,120
- # Tell me what #
- # What #

556
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,960
# What would I do #

557
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,960
# If I could feel #

558
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,520
# What would I do #

559
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,000
# If I could
reach inside of me #

560
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,800
# And to know
how it feels to say #

561
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,320
# I like what I see #

562
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,600
# And I'd be more #

563
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,640
# Than glad to share #

564
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,680
# All that I have
inside of here #

565
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,720
# And the songs
my heart might bring #

566
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,360
# You'd be more
than glad to sing #

567
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,800
# And if tears should
fall from my eyes #

568
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,320
# Just think of all the wounds
they could mend #

569
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,200
# And just think of all the time
I could spend #

570
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,600
# Just being vulnerable again #

571
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,040
- # Tell me what #
- # What #

572
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,880
# What would I do #

573
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,640
- # Oh, tell me what #
- # What, what would I do #

574
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,320
- # Oh, tell me what #
- # What #

575
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,280
# What would I do #

576
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,240
# If I could feel ##

577
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm just a miserable
hunk of junk.

578
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,960
Me!

579
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,000
Once the fastest
metal mouth on the midway.

580
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,640
Frozen... ironically in a position
I had assumed all too often.

581
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,680
A seat cushion for Teenie!

582
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,960
Teenie!

583
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,360
Teenie!

584
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,800
- Teenie!
- Dorothy!

585
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,320
- Teenie! Teenie!
- Are you thinkin' what I am?

586
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,080
- Teenie!
- You're so smart!

587
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,440
Teenie! Teen...

588
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,720
You could come with us
to see the Wiz.

589
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,320
He's gonna get me back home...

590
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,880
...and he's gonna get
the Scarecrow some brains.

591
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,080
Maybe he could get you a heart.

592
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,080
You're not just flimflammin'
an ol' flimflammer, are ya?

593
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,320
Could I come with ya?

594
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,080
- Of course.
- "A threefold cord is not quickly broken. "

595
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,360
What's wrong?

596
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,240
He rusted himself cryin'.

597
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,440
Oil! Oil!

598
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,920
- What?
- Oil!

599
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,560
- Find some oil!
- Some oil!

600
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,600
Oil!

601
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,000
# Slide some oil to me #

602
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,440
# Let it trickle down my spine #

603
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,680
# If you don't have STP #

604
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,800
# Crisco will do just fine #

605
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,160
# Slide some to my elbow #

606
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,240
# And to my fingers
if you would #

607
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,040
# Slide some oil
to me, girl #

608
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,680
# Whoo, don't that
feel good #

609
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,280
# Slide some oil
to my feet #

610
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,160
# Look-a there
I got toes again #

611
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,960
# Come on
slide some oil to my knees #

612
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,160
# And let me see
if I can bend #

613
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,920
# Slide some oil to me #

614
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,800
# I'm beginnin' to feel just fine #

615
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,200
# Slide some oil
down my throat #

616
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,400
# And let me lubricate my mind #

617
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,080
# Slide some oil to me #

618
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,240
# Go ahead
hit my shoulder blades #

619
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,000
# Those who don't have
to lubricate #

620
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,160
# Sure got it made #

621
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,400
# Slide some oil to me #

622
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,760
# Let it slip down my side.

623
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,840
# Laying there in one position #

624
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,720
# Sure done made me tired #
Now watch me dance.

625
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,800
Come on, you metal metatarsals,
don't fail me now.

626
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,480
Ah-ha! Fall in line
and get left behind.

627
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,240
Two bits!

628
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,920
Let me show you my
Saturday night finish!

629
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,520
Oh! Music man!
Let me hear that band!

630
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,920
# Don't turn the water on me #

631
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,360
# Just let me burn
and let me lubricate #

632
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,680
# My mind ##

633
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,640
Come on!

634
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,760
# There may be times you think
you've lost your mind #

635
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,800
# These steps you're takin'
leave you steps behind #

636
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,360
# The road you're walkin'
might be long sometimes #

637
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,760
# But you keep on steppin'
and you'll be just fine #

638
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,080
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

639
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,360
# Come on and ease on down
ease on down the road #

640
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,360
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

641
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,960
# Come on, ease on down
down the road #

642
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,960
# Come on, ease on down
down the road #

643
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,120
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

644
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,200
# Ease on down
ease on down ##

645
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,760
Hey! Look at me walkin'!

646
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,480
- Stop the music!
- What's the matter? You need more oil?

647
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,160
No! That beast!

648
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,200
He's checkin' us out.

649
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,320
Oh, it's just a statue.

650
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,600
Made of stone, see?

651
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,600
Now even a dummy like me
knows a stone lion...

652
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,520
...can't... Check you out.

653
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,880
# Say what you wanna
but I'm here to stay #

654
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,720
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #

655
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,800
# Now you can go
where you're gonna #

656
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,280
# But don't get in my way
I'm a mean ol' lion #

657
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,760
# You'll be standing in a draft #

658
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,960
# If you don't hear me laugh #

659
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,360
Ha-ha!
# If you have to come around #

660
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,960
# You best not make me frown #

661
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,640
# Or I just might
knock you down #

662
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,920
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #

663
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,760
# You know I'm ready to fight
and turn your day into night #

664
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,200
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #

665
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,880
# If you're half bright
you'll detour to the right #

666
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,520
# From a mean ol' lion #

667
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,560
# And all you strangers
got to beware #

668
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:03,480
# This is the king
of the jungle here #

669
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,200
# And if I happen
to let you slide #

670
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,800
# Don't stand there
run and hide #

671
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,880
# You just, you just
caught my better side #

672
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,440
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion #

673
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,200
# Look, you better beware #

674
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,840
# This is the, the king
of the jungle here #

675
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,280
# And if I happen
to let you slide #

676
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,040
# Don't stand there
run and hide #

677
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,720
# You just done caught
my better side #

678
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,080
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion #

679
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,160
Toto!

680
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:56,960
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion ##

681
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,440
How dare you touch...

682
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,080
...the personage of a king?

683
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,880
You tacky package of horse fodder.

684
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,160
Begone, you overexcited slot machine.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

685
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
Oh! You mangy mutt! Oh!

686
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,880
Toto!

687
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,400
Oh!

688
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,880
He bit my paw!

689
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,400
King of the jungle?

690
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:46,360
- King of the cowards.
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself, scaring us like that.

691
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,720
You big scaredy-cat!

692
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,560
I can't scare anything.
I can't even scare a scarecrow...

693
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,520
...a tin man or
a little puppy, anything.

694
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,560
It's no wonder they drummed me
out of the jungle.

695
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,840
- I.O.B.K.!
- I.O.B.K.?

696
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,240
Incapable Of Being King!

697
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,280
No! Wait, wait! Wait!

698
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,400
I was exiled in disgrace.

699
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,240
I thought I'd be safe here.

700
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,920
No one would...
discover my terrible secret.

701
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,480
Uh, that I'm...

702
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,720
...a lion without any courage!

703
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,320
"Uneasy lies the head...

704
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,640
...that wears a crown. "
W. Shakespeare.

705
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,640
Well, I thought
I'd seen 'em all.

706
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:16,080
But never, never have I seen...

707
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:22,320
...a lion... without courage.

708
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,160
Lion!

709
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:39,040
Lion!

710
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,800
Maybe the Wiz could give you
some courage.

711
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,680
- It's a good idea.
- Capital suggestion.

712
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,040
- Capital! He's gonna get me a heart.
- And me some brains.

713
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,720
Come with us to Emerald City.

714
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,600
I'd love to, but I can't.

715
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,040
But why?

716
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,680
Because... I'm scared!

717
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,760
Oh.

718
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,440
# Oh, there #

719
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,760
# May be times #

720
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:29,120
# When you wish
you wasn't born #

721
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,240
# And you wake one morning
to find your courage gone #

722
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,800
# But just know that feelin'
only lasts a little while #

723
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,680
# You just stick with us
We'll show you how to smile #

724
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,160
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

725
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,960
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

726
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,160
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

727
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:57,280
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down, down the road #

728
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,840
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

729
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,280
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

730
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,280
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

731
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,360
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

732
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,560
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

733
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,440
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

734
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,880
# I gotta get down
gotta get, gotta, gotta #

735
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,440
# Gotta, gotta, gotta
getta, getta, getta #

736
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,880
# Ease on down the road
ease on down the road ##

737
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,560
Ah, my ma would be so proud.

738
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,800
Going to see the Wiz!

739
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,840
My mama used to
always say to me, Fleet!

740
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,120
Fleet?

741
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,480
That's my name,
Fleetwood Coup de Ville.

742
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,720
- Mama had high ideals.
- Yeah!

743
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,760
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah!

744
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,040
I ain't too happy
underground, you all.

745
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,760
- How does he do that?
- It's just a hoax, my friend.

746
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,480
He's got a little motor
in his... Pocket.

747
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,160
- Lion! Lion!
- Help!

748
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,360
- Oh, my... Please, somebody!
- Shh!

749
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,960
Lion! Lion!

750
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,080
Owww! Lion!

751
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,680
Li...

752
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,120
Lion!

753
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,080
Aaah!

754
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,800
Lion, save me!

755
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,440
Dorothy!

756
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:18,120
Toto! Toto, Toto, Toto.

757
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,960
Hey!

758
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,680
Oh! Wait!

759
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,040
- Where's the lion?
- I'm coming!

760
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,240
- Wait, wait!
- Lion!

761
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,720
Come on! Let's go!

762
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,720
- Hurry up!
- This way, this way! Wait for me!

763
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,280
Hey!

764
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,560
Sssss!

765
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,760
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

766
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,040
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

767
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:43,680
My queen, if you'll allow me,
like I say...

768
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,120
...you stick with the big kitty
and you'll be in heaven.

769
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,240
Sssss!

770
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,520
Outta the frying pan, into the...
This is like a setup.

771
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,200
Stay away! Dorothy! Lion!

772
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,800
Stay away! Dorothy! Lion!

773
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,520
Don't follow them! Don't!

774
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,920
Oh, please! It's a setup!

775
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,960
- Stop!
- Come back!

776
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,960
Jump! Don't go in there!

777
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,280
Whoo, whoo!

778
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,920
Oh! Dorothy! Lion!

779
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,080
- I can't move him! I can't move him!
- Dorothy?

780
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,040
- Get Toto, we'll come back for him.
- Toto!

781
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:52,840
Oh, look, poor little Toto!

782
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,120
Sweet little Toto.
What are we going to do?

783
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,760
- All is lost!
- Dorothy!

784
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,520
Dorothy, please.

785
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,640
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, please, don't be dead.

786
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,320
Oh, all is lost.

787
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:25,560
# How high the moon #

788
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,720
What's happenin', babe?

789
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,120
Hey, Lion's okay!

790
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,360
- Hey, baby!
- Come and cry over here!

791
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,680
- Teenie! Think of Teenie!
- Dor... Dorothy?

792
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:47,000
- Think of Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie, uh, Teenie!

793
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,600
- Uh, Teenie!
- It's all my fault!

794
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:56,000
Uh, Teenie! Uh, Teenie!

795
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh, mighty Zeus!

796
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,440
And gods of the universe!

797
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,720
Why have you cursed
this low, mangy animal so?

798
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,840
Once I was a king,
a lion amongst lions!

799
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,800
Ruler of a beautiful
kingdom by a waterfall.

800
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,800
Attended by butterflies
and sparrows.

801
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,960
And now banished for lack of courage...

802
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,200
I cannot even protect these
friends who have been so kind.

803
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,280
Oh, I was strong and brave...

804
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,880
...in the subway only to be
foolish and weak again.

805
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,160
I led us into
the very jaws of death!

806
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,280
Oh, let me end it all!

807
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:48,200
- Lion, Lion!
- No!

808
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,400
No, let me splatter
to the four winds!

809
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,080
It's all right, Lion.
It's all right.

810
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,160
Everything's all right.

811
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,720
- The worst is over, my furry friend.
- No!

812
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,480
Would you lay an appropriate quote
on this poor beasty brother?

813
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,760
"Showers expected late tomorrow. "

814
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,280
Lion?

815
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
# There is a place #

816
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,360
# We'll go #

817
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,720
# Where there is mostly quiet #

818
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:44,040
# Flowers and butterflies #

819
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:52,960
# A rainbow lives beside it #

820
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:03,000
# And from a velvet sky #

821
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:09,520
# The summer storm #

822
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,400
# You can feel #

823
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,200
# The coolness in the air #

824
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,160
# But you're still #

825
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:28,840
# Warm #

826
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:37,440
# And then a mighty roar #

827
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,480
# Will start the sky #

828
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,680
# To cryin' #

829
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,320
# But not even lightning #

830
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,880
# Will be frightening #

831
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,440
# My lion #

832
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:13,920
# And with no fear inside #

833
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:19,120
# No need to run #

834
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:23,960
# No need to hide #

835
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,160
# You're standing strong #

836
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,040
# And tall #

837
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,960
# You're the bravest #

838
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,480
# Of them all #

839
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:46,040
# If on courage #

840
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,640
# You must call #

841
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,800
# Then just keep on tryin' #

842
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,640
# And tryin' #

843
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:59,760
# And tryin' #

844
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,520
# You're a lion #

845
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,680
# In your own way #

846
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:12,320
# Be a lion #

847
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,680
Come on, be a lion.

848
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:23,120
# I'm standing strong #

849
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,280

# I'm a lion ##

862
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,280
- How do we get in?
- And how do you do?

863
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,280
- Good evening there, brother.
- This place is nice.

864
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,320
The service entrance
is at the side.

865
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,560
We're here to see the Wiz.

866
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,760
This is where the Wiz lives,
isn't it?

867
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,440
May I welcome you to the Emerald City.

868
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,240
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

869
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,720
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

870
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,440
# I want to be seen green #

871
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,680
# Wouldn't be caught dead red #

872
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:51,160
# 'Cause if you are seen green #

873
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,360
# It means you've got mean bread #

874
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,160
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

875
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:14,120
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

876
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,760
# You've got to be seen in green
to show that your stuff's laid #

877
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,160
- # If you're not seen green #
# You'd better be wearin' jade #

878
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,840
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

879
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,280
# You've got to be seen green #

880
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:53,160
# Don't tell him
your cupboard's bare #

881
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:57,080
# That you gave up
one week's feed #

882
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:01,080
# To pay for your colored hair #

883
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,960
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

884
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,720
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

885
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,480
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

886
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,160
An announcement
from the great and powerful Oz.

887
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,400
Oz.

888
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,920
I thought it over
and green is dead.

889
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,560
'Til I change my mind,
the color's red.

890
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,880
# I wouldn't be seen green #

891
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:20,600
# Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ah, ah #

892
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:25,280
# I wouldn't be caught dead #

893
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:33,080
# And if I'm caught at all #

894
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:36,600
# Then catch me in dead red #

895
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,240
# Ooo #

896
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,400
# You've got to be dead red #

897
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:53,280
# You've got to be real hot #

898
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,560
# So throw away those green gems #

899
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:02,880
# And wear rubies
on your yacht #

900
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,560
# You've got to be dead red #

901
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:15,640
# You've got to have
flash and flair #

902
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:20,880
# And if you're not seen red #

903
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,640
# Then you shouldn't be seen #

904
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:33,360
# Nowhere #

905
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,840
How quick fashion
goes down the drain.

906
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,840
Last week when
you all was wearin' pink...

907
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,480
...already for me, red was old.

908
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,560
The ultimate yellow brick is gold.
That's the new color, children, hit it.

909
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,320
# Golden gold #

910
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:03,880
# Golden gold #

911
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,480
# Golden gold #

912
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:13,080
# Golden gold #

913
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,480
# You've got to be seen gold #

914
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,080
# Watch out for the new kind
you've got to have old gold #

915
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,720
# Like some from a gold mine
You've got to be wearin' gold #

916
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,160
# The 24 karat kind
and once you've shined it up #

917
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,720
# It should ought
to make you blind #

918
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,760
# You've got to be seen in gold
to show you're super slick #

919
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,040
# It helps to pay tips and tolls
It's the ultimate yellow brick #

920
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,680
# It's the ultimate #

921
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:26,200
# Gold #

922
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:30,080
# Gold #

923
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,720
# Gold, gold #

924
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,520
# Gold, gold #

925
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,000
# Gold, gold #

926
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,720
# Gold, gold #

927
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,360
# Gold, gold #

928
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:52,360
# Gold, gold #

929
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,840
# Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold ##

930
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:07,160
An announcement
from the great and powerful Oz.

931
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:11,400
Send up the one
with the silver slippers.

932
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,280
Do you know how lucky you are?

933
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,080
I've been trying to get
an appointment for two years!

934
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,840
No one sees the Wiz!

935
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,960
- I knew you'd make it.
- Who does your hair?

936
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,000
Can you come
for dinner next Wednesday?

937
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,800
- Can I give you my card?
- Can I take you home?

938
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,280
And...

939
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,920
Only the one with
the silver slippers!

940
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,240
You go ahead, Dorothy.
"He who hesitates... "

941
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,280
Etcetera, etcetera.

942
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,360
Uh, I'd like to speak
to the Wiz.

943
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,760
Hey, Mike!

944
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,920
Excuse me...

945
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,040
Excuse me, sir, Mr. Wiz?

946
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,080
Speak!

947
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:50,760
I'm not alone, sir. I'm here with
my three companions and my dog, Toto.

948
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,080
Forget it.
No riffraff.

949
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:58,920
Uh, they're not
riffraff, sir.

950
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,520
They're my friends
and they've traveled far to see you.

951
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,440
I said, forget it!

952
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:12,840
Then, then, I'm not
comin' up there.

953
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:25,200
What?

954
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:37,560
Either you see my friends, sir,
or you forget it.

955
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,440
Send up the riffraff.

956
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:12,800
What's happening?

957
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,360
Step forward.

958
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:32,200
Sure wish I was back
at the library.

959
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:51,120
So! You wanted
to meet the Wizard!

960
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,120
What do you snivelling
deadbeats want?

961
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,960
That's close enough!

962
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,200
My name is Dorothy and...

963
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,760
And I'm, I'm
tryin' to get home.

964
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,200
And these, these
are my friends.

965
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,600
This is the Scarecrow.

966
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,480
He, he wants...
Tell him.

967
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,360
A brain, Your Majesty.

968
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:38,720
Some of your great "Wiz... Dom. "

969
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:45,600
Uh, and this is the Tin Man.

970
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,760
I been a two-bit,
carny hustler all my life.

971
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:06,600
And I want a heart,
O mighty and powerful Wiz.

972
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:12,720
A heart... So I can love...

973
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,240
...all humanity.

974
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:19,880
And what do you want,
you overstuffed animal cracker?

975
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,720
I wanna get the hell outta here!

976
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,000
He wants some courage, sir.

977
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:34,320
So he can go back to his old job...
of being king of the jungle.

978
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,400
Is this so, Lion?

979
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:40,120
Anything she says.

980
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,400
Can you help us, sir?

981
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:49,960
- What's in it for me?
- We'd be very grateful.

982
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:01,200
How about your pretty
silver slippers?

983
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,960
No!

984
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,680
No! You dare say no...

985
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:10,440
...to the great Wizard of Oz?

986
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:15,440
I, I can't take these off 'til I get
back home, but I'll send 'em to you.

987
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,280
The great Oz has decided...

988
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,840
...not to grant any of your wishes!

989
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,840
Unless, unless...

990
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:32,520
...you, Dorothy, kill Evillene...

991
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,920
...the Wicked Witch of the West!

992
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:41,640
The great Oz has spoken!

993
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:46,640
Oh, Mr. Wiz, please!

994
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,760
Come in.

995
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,480
I'm sorry I dragged you all here.

996
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,960
And look how it turned out.

997
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,880
Have you made
your decision yet, Dorothy?

998
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,800
I don't think
there's any choice.

999
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,000
Dorothy, you don't
have to do it!

1000
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:18,160
We could stay right here!
The Emerald City's not a bad place.

1001
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:22,240
Get a small apartment,
chip in together.

1002
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,240
Hey, I bet in no time
we'd fit right in.

1003
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:28,960
But I could never
be happy here.

1004
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:33,040
Besides, I'd... Never get home.

1005
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:41,920
I have to go all the way,
even if it means to Evillene.

1006
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,440
Come on, Toto, good boy.

1007
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:50,160
Then I'm going with you.

1008
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:53,480
Likewise!

1009
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,520
Me too.

1010
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:10,560
Come on.

1011
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,920
Which road do we take?

1012
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,360
Road? This one...

1013
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,840
...and you may be sorry.

1014
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,160
- Then how do we find Evillene?
- Don't worry.

1015
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,280
She'll find you.

1016
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,760
Owww!

1017
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,800
# Now when I wake up
in the afternoon #

1018
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:44,520
# Which it pleases me to do
don't nobody bring me no bad news #

1019
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,560
# 'Cause I wake up
already negative #

1020
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:52,080
# And I've fired up my fuse
so don't nobody bring me no bad news #

1021
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:56,440
# If we're gonna be buddies
you better bone up on the rules #

1022
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,600
# 'Cause don't nobody
bring me no bad news #

1023
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,640
# You can be my best of friends
as opposed to payin' dues #

1024
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:08,200
# But don't nobody bring me
no bad news #

1025
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,360
- # Well, no bad news #
- # No bad news #

1026
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,840
- # No bad news #
- # No bad news #

1027
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:16,720
- # Now don't you ever bring me no bad news #
- # No bad news #

1028
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,640
# 'Cause I'll make you an offer, child
that you cannot refuse #

1029
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:24,400
# So don't nobody bring me
no bad news #

1030
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,600
# Now when you're
talkin' to me #

1031
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,800
# Don't be cryin' the blues #

1032
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,760
- # 'Cause don't nobody bring me no bad news #
- # No bad news #

1033
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,800

1038
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,760

- # No bad news #

1043
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,720
# 'Cause I'll make you an offer, child
that you cannot refuse #

1044
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,120
# So don't you bring me
no bad news #

1045
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,480
Right!

1046
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:44,720
# Don't nobody bring me

1047
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,840

1059
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:40,400
Work! Work! Work! Work!

1060
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,400
Work, work, work, work!

1061
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,920
And...

1062
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,800
...all lunch hours are cancelled!

1063
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:54,680
Oh, please, O beautiful one!

1064
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:58,040
We haven't had a lunch hour
in six months!

1065
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:02,560
Well, suffering
is food for the soul.

1066
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,920
Now suffer!

1067
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:13,480
So, no one stopped Dorothy, eh?

1068
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,640
All right!

1069
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:20,880
Amateur night is over!

1070
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,280
I'm summoning my flying monkeys!

1071
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:28,520
No, no, not the flying monkeys!

1072
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,840
Yes, yes, the flying monkeys!

1073
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:37,160
I hate to have to do this myself,
because I can't stand the smells...

1074
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:41,560
...but these are
red alert conditions!

1075
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:45,640
Hot... Fire.

1076
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,880
Peee-uu! Aaah!

1077
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,680
- What's happenin'?
- Don't come any closer!

1078
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,480
I got a little job
for you, Cheetah.

1079
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:16,400
Bring me Dorothy, the Scarecrow,
the Tin Man, the Lion and the dog too.

1080
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,640
How do you want 'em?
White bread or rye?

1081
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,920
You get smart with me and I'll
send you back to your cages!

1082
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,560
Now get Dorothy and don't damage
those silver slippers!

1083
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:43,520
Peee-uu!

1084
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:47,600
War is hell!

1085
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:50,360
Hit it, Morris!

1086
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:54,080
# Don't nobody bring me
Don't nobody bring me #

1087
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:58,200
# Don't nobody bring me
no bad news ##

1088
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:03,200
# Ease on down #
I ain't scared.

1089
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,640
Aaah!

1090
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,080
- Hey, brother!
- Not now!

1091
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:53,000
Lion! Wait for me!

1092
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,760
Get back, I told you!

1093
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,400
Psst! Psst! Psst!

1094
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,120
Psst!

1095
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,600
Psst, psst, psst!
We're over here!

1096
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,480
- Psst! Lion!
- Psst!

1097
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,560
Hey, brother!

1098
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:55,120
You better get
outta the way for me!

1099
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,480
Toto! Where's Toto?

1100
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,880
Toto! Oh!

1101
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,080
Toto!

1102
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:08,600
- Toto! Toto!
- Hey, there he is.

1103
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:12,320
- Toto.
- I think we're safe.

1104
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:26,240
So, you're Dorothy, huh?

1105
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,760
You murdered my sister!

1106
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,760
A saint she was.
And stole her shoes!

1107
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,200
- Give them to me!
- No.

1108
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:42,920
- What?
- No!

1109
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,840
All right, you!

1110
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,160
Don't worry, Dorothy.
It doesn't hurt.

1111
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,880
It's just a little rough
on my filing system.

1112
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,240
Never fear, my little flower.

1113
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:44,560
I'm just a hollow shell!

1114
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,160
Don't give up the shoes!

1115
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:19,720
Would you like
sauerkraut or mustard, my dear?

1116
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:25,040
On your hot dog!

1117
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,680
Toto! Toto! No! Don't!

1118
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:38,320
No, don't!
Don't you dare! Toto, Toto!

1119
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:43,520
- Will you give me those shoes?
- Yes, yes, yes.

1120
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,360
That's what I thought.

1121
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:55,320
Toto.

1122
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,960
Psst! Psst!

1123
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:05,880
Hurry up with those shoes!

1124
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,040
No! Don't touch that! No!

1125
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:25,720
- No! No!
- Toto!

1126
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:30,360
I'm allergic to water!
It makes me melt! No! No!

1127
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:46,880
Please, please, help me
with my friends!

1128
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,880
Oh, no!
Here it is, I got 'em!

1129
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,560
Oh, put him together.
I don't care what you do.

1130
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,000
Just put him down.
Put him together.

1131
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:06,120
Where's his arm?
His arm, oh!

1132
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:09,520
Okay, okay, do something!

1133
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,600
Get some tools, get something!

1134
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:15,800
A crowbar, a hammer!
Don't hurt him!

1135
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:45,200
# Everybody look around 'cause there's
a reason to rejoice, you see #

1136
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:48,920
# Everybody come out and let's

Whee!

1193
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:34,840
Hello?

1194
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,200
- Where are we?
- This must be the back door.

1195
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:39,800
I don't think the killers of
the Wicked Witch of the West...

1196
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:42,200
...should be using the back door.

1197
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:44,280
You know what I mean?

1198
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:47,000
Cheetah says it's a shortcut.

1199
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:53,280
- Good-bye, Cheetah.
- Good-bye, Dorothy.

1200
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,040
Bye. Whew!

1201
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:02,440
It's open.

1202
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:04,880
Hello? Hello in there!

1203
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:16,720
Wait!

1204
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:21,120
- Wait a minute.
- Does this look familiar?

1205
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:25,480
Guess who got had?

1206
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:32,520
Barnum said
there's a sucker born every minute.

1207
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:34,840
I was there when he said it...

1208
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:38,080
...but I never thought
I'd be one of 'em.

1209
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,680
Phony!

1210
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,120
You're nothing but a phony!

1211
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:54,120
The Wizard's out!
He's not here!

1212
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:58,480
Lies! No more lies.

1213
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:01,000
You charlatan!
I've seen men shot for less.

1214
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:04,520
- You're a terrible man!
- I'm sorry!

1215
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:09,680
- Sorry?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1216
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,680
Phony!

1217
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,640
Everything they say about me is true.
I'm a phony!

1218
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:19,240
I got no right to be pretending
to be the Wiz!

1219
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:23,000
I've got nothin'.
Hocus-pocus.

1220
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:26,760
I'm just plain old Herman Smith
from Atlantic City.

1221
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:33,000
Atlantic City?
Atlantic City?

1222
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,920
You mean, you're from New Jersey?

1223
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,760
Mm-hmm.

1224
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:40,680
I'm just a second-rate
politician from District Seven.

1225
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:44,480
"Public office is the last refuge
of the incompetent. " Penrose!

1226
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,000
Incompetent?
Ha-ha-ha!

1227
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:52,920
That's me.
I'm incompetent.

1228
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:57,360
So much so, I could never
get elected to public office.

1229
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:02,000
Not because I didn't try.
I tried everything.

1230
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:04,640
Look, look!
I ran for everything.

1231
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:09,240
Alderman, councilman,
assembly leader!

1232
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:13,520
I became a laughingstock.
I couldn't even get on the ticket!

1233
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:19,280
Finally, in desperation,
I ran for dogcatcher!

1234
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:24,120
I like animals.
Don't get me wrong.

1235
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,720
I was at the end of my rope.

1236
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:32,760
I plunged myself into the campaign.

1237
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:36,200
One desperate grandstand play.
You know what I did?

1238
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:39,520
I rented a hot-air balloon!

1239
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:42,600
Hot air!
That's a perfect vehicle for you.

1240
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:45,040
No, no, no!

1241
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,920
It was a beautiful
Fourth of July day!

1242
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,320
I planned to fly over
the boardwalk and the beach...

1243
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,880
...and throw my...
Aaah!

1244
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:00,920
Throw my leaflets to
the astonished crowds below.

1245
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,920
My motto was...

1246
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:06,360
"Vote for Smith,
your best bet to catch that pet. "

1247
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,840
But just when I got
up in the balloon...

1248
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:14,160
A terrible storm came up...

1249
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:17,240
...and blew me into the clouds.

1250
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:19,800
I got lost.

1251
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,440
I landed here in Oz.

1252
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:33,400
They'd never seen a hot-air
balloon like mine before.

1253
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:36,240
And I know I should have
told them the truth...

1254
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,880
...but they proclaimed me
the Wizard...

1255
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,160
...and I needed the job.

1256
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:45,200
And you mean...

1257
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:48,520
...you sent us to kill Evillene...

1258
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:52,640
...knowing... we might
never come back?

1259
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:55,520
She would've killed me.

1260
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:59,000
She would've found out
I had no power, and took over Oz.

1261
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:02,040
That's no excuse.

1262
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:03,640
Come on.

1263
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:07,040
Please, please don't go.

1264
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:11,280
I live...
I live here all alone...

1265
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:15,240
...in terror...

1266
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:21,240
...that someone will find out...

1267
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:24,000
...that I'm a fraud.

1268
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,760
Please...

1269
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,760
...just stay with me for
a little while and talk.

1270
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:34,400
You can talk to me crazy...

1271
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:38,280
...call me names.

1272
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:50,200
What's the matter?

1273
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:55,400
Now I'll never get my brain.

1274
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:57,200
Nor my heart.

1275
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,800
Or my courage.

1276
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:08,440
But you don't need them now...

1277
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,960
...because you've had them all along.

1278
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,440
Scarecrow. Scarecrow?

1279
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,960
You're the one who figured out
how to find the Yellow Brick Road...

1280
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,600
...and how to destroy Evillene...

1281
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:23,240
...and every smart move we've made.

1282
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:25,240
Didn't you?

1283
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:28,400
Didn't you?

1284
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:31,280
And, Lion...

1285
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:35,160
...you wouldn't even give up when
Evillene strung you up by your tail.

1286
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:42,480
And, Tin Man...

1287
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:46,960
...you have more heart
than anyone I've ever known.

1288
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,120
Honest?

1289
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,640
Yes.

1290
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:58,520
You never needed anything
from the fake Wizard anyway.

1291
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:03,840
# If you believe #

1292
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:10,240
# Within your heart
you'll know #

1293
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:17,000
# That no one can change #

1294
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:21,040
# The path that you must go #

1295
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:27,240
# Believe what you feel #

1296
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:33,240
# And know you're right because #

1297
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:39,160
# The time will come around #

1298
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:45,480
# When you say it's yours #

1299
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:52,520
# Believe there's
a reason to be #

1300
01:58:53,960 --> 01:59:00,160
# Believe you can
make time stand still #

1301
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:04,480
# You know from
the moment you try #

1302
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:09,400
# If you believe #

1303
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:13,320
# I know you will #

1304
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:19,360
# Believe in yourself #

1305
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:22,720
# Right from the start #

1306
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:25,480
# You'll have brains #

1307
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:28,040
# You'll have a heart #

1308
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,080
# You'll have courage #

1309
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:36,960
# To last your
whole life through #

1310
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:43,640
# If you believe
in yourself #

1311
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:49,760
# If you believe
in yourself #

1312
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:53,760
# If you believe
in yourself #

1313
01:59:53,840 --> 02:00:05,600
# As I believe in you ##

1314
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:21,480
What about you, Dorothy?

1315
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,600
You'll never get home.

1316
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:28,440
Me?

1317
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:35,920
I guess you're stuck
with Toto and me.

1318
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:08,880
It's Glinda,
the Good Witch of the South!

1319
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,440
She has great powers.

1320
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:33,680
Hello, Dorothy.

1321
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:39,480
Please, is there a way
for me to get home?

1322
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:42,280
Dorothy, you were wise
and good enough...

1323
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:46,320
...to help your friends find
what was inside them all the time.

1324
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,520
That's true for you, also.

1325
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:54,080
Home?

1326
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,880
Inside me?
I don't understand.

1327
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,760
Home is a place
we all must find, child.

1328
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:04,160
It's not just a place
where you eat or sleep.

1329
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:06,720
Home is knowing.

1330
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:11,280
Knowing your mind,
knowing your heart...

1331
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:14,720
...knowing your courage.

1332
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:19,560
If we know ourselves,
we're always home, anywhere.

1333
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:28,560
# If you believe #

1334
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:34,200
# Within your heart
you'll know #

1335
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:41,040
# That no one can change #

1336
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:45,680
# The path that you must go #

1337
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:51,880
# Believe what you feel #

1338
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:57,840
# And know you're right because #

1339
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:03,520
# The time will come around #

1340
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:10,640
# When you'll say it's yours #

1341
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:16,520
# Believe that you
can go home #

1342
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:21,200
# Believe you can
float on air #

1343
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:27,960
# Yes, click your heels
three times #

1344
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,560
# If you believe #

1345
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:36,680
# And then
you'll be there #

1346
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:41,160
# That's why I want you
to believe in yourself #

1347
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:44,000
# Yes, right
from the start #

1348
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:46,000
# You've got to believe #

1349
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:49,960
# Believe in the magic
right there in your heart #

1350
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:53,000
# Go ahead
believe all these things #

1351
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:58,760
# Not because
I told you to #

1352
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:02,360
# Now, go ahead
and believe #

1353
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:05,040
# Believe in yourself #

1354
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:08,080
# Ooh, yeah, believe #

1355
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:11,640
# Believe in yourself
Ooh, yeah #

1356
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:16,280
# Yeah, yeah
believe in yourself #

1357
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:29,760
# As I believe in you ##

1358
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:37,080
You mean,
I could have gone home...

1359
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:39,600
...by clicking my heels three times?

1360
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:41,840
Uh-huh.

1361
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:43,880
Dorothy.

1362
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:53,840
Can you do something for me?

1363
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:59,960
They've had what they've been
searching for in them all along.

1364
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:02,200
I don't know what's in you.

1365
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:05,960
You'll have to find
that out for yourself.

1366
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,160
But I do know one thing.

1367
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:10,800
You'll never find it
in the safety of this room.

1368
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,840
I tried that all my life.

1369
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:16,400
It doesn't work.

1370
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:19,840
There's a whole world out there.

1371
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:21,880
And you'll have to begin...

1372
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:25,760
...by letting people see
who you really are.

1373
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:36,960
Success...

1374
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:40,200
...fame and fortune...

1375
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:43,960
...they're all illusions.

1376
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:47,200
All there is that is real...

1377
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:52,440
...is the friendship...

1378
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:55,640
...that two can share.

1379
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:59,480
That's beautiful.
Who said that?

1380
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,480
I did.

1381
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:07,880
Oh, Dorothy.

1382
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:13,600
I'll think of you all the time.

1383
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:16,760
And I will miss you...

1384
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:19,360
...every day.

1385
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:23,000
Even if I had to
go back to that junk pile...

1386
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:28,400
...even as Teenie's seat cushion,
I wouldn't mind...

1387
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:32,120
...because I have known real love.

1388
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:34,840
Oh, don't rust yourself, now.

1389
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:50,600
Oh, Dorothy.

1390
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:56,080
If it hadn't been for you...

1391
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:59,440
I'd still be back
on that pedestal...

1392
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:02,960
...afraid to live.

1393
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:06,360
Me, too.

1394
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:12,160
Thank you.

1395
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:14,800
Thank you.

1396
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,320
Thank you for
being my friends.

1397
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:17,760
Thank you for
being my friends.

1398
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:22,320
I'm ready now.

1399
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:25,280
Think of home.

1400
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:30,880
Home.

1401
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:40,800
# When I think of home #

1402
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:43,040
# I think of a place #

1403
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:49,440
# Where there's
love overflowin' #

1404
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:51,760
# I wish I was home #

1405
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,360
# I wish I was
back there #

1406
02:07:54,440 --> 02:08:00,080
# With the things
I've been knowin' #

1407
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:03,040
# Wind that makes
the tall trees #

1408
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:05,840
# Bend into leaning #

1409
02:08:05,880 --> 02:08:11,160
# Suddenly the snowflakes
that fall have a meaning #

1410
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:16,600
# Sprinkling the scene #

1411
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:21,920
# Makes it all clean #

1412
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:29,840
# Maybe there's a chance
for me to go back #

1413
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:34,840
# Now that I have
some direction #

1414
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:40,560
# It would sure be nice
to be back home #

1415
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:46,880
# Where there's
love and affection #

1416
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:52,720
# And just maybe I can
convince time to slow up #

1417
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:57,880
# Givin' me enough time
in my life to grow up #

1418
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:03,160
# Time, be my friend #

1419
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:09,160
# Let me start again #

1420
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:15,640
# Suddenly my world's gone
and changed its face #

1421
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:21,560
# But I still
know where I'm goin' #

1422
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:25,680
# I have had my mind
spun around in space #

1423
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:30,600
# And yet I've
watched it growin' #

1424
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:33,800
# And if you're
listenin', God #

1425
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:35,800
# Please don't
make it hard #

1426
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:40,680
# To know if we should believe
the things that we see #

1427
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:43,360
# Tell us
should we run away #

1428
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:45,360
# Should we try and stay #

1429
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:50,680
# Or would it be better
just to let things be #

1430
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:55,960
# Livin' here
in this brand-new world #

1431
02:09:56,040 --> 02:10:00,760
# Might be a fantasy #

1432
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:05,680
# But it taught me to love #

1433
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:10,760
# So it's real
real to me #

1434
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,760
# And I've learned #

1435
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:16,960
# That we must
look inside our hearts #

1436
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:21,320
# To find #

1437
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:25,360
# A world full of love #

1438
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:30,760
# Like yours, like mine #

1439
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:42,440
# Like home ##

1440
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:30,680
# Come on and ease on down
ease on down the road #

1441
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:34,440
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

1442
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:38,360
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

1443
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:42,120
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down, down the road #

1444
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:46,240
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

1445
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:50,240
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

1446
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:54,000
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

1447
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:57,880
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down, down the road #

1448
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:01,920
# Pick your left foot up
when your right one's down #

1449
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,680
# Come on, let's keep movin'
Don't you lose no ground #

1450
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:09,720
# You just keep on keepin'
on the road that you choose #

1451
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:14,320
# Don't you give up walkin'
'cause you gave up shoes #

1452
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:17,360
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

1453
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:21,560
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

1454
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:25,400
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

1455
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:29,200
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down, down the road #

1456
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:33,280
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

1457
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:37,080
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

1458
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:40,960
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

1459
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:44,920
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down, down the road #

1460
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,040
# 'Cause there may be times
when you wish you wasn't born #

1461
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:53,120
# And you wake one mornin' just to find
that your girl is gone #

1462
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:56,760
# You know that feelin'
only lasts a little while #

1463
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,760
# You just stick with us #

1464
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:01,520
# And we'll show you
how to smile again #

1465
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:04,120
# Get 'em up, goin' down #

1466
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,440
# Ease on down #

1467
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:08,120
# Get 'em up, goin' down #

1468
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:09,320

# Get 'em up, get 'em up
ease on down #

1472
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:19,800
# Get 'em up, goin' down #

1473
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:21,320

1474
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:23,760

# Ease on down #

1478
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:32,880
# I'd like that
I want to ease on down #

1479
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:35,480
# Get 'em up, goin' down
down the road #

1480
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:37,000
# Ease on down #

1481
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:40,680

# Ease on down
ease on down #

1489
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:04,480
# Get 'em up, get 'em up
ease on down the road ##
