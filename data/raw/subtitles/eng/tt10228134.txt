1
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,730
What makes
a person extraordinary?

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,025
Everyone wants to be normal.

3
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,986
But no one wants to be ordinary.

4
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,448
And what is normal?

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,534
We all see the pretty
pictures on our feeds.

6
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:38,914
Normal party, normal family,
normal adorable little girl.

7
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:43,878
But, there's always
more behind the facade.

8
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,298
Most of the time
Lindy seems quite normal.

9
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:52,303
But buried deep in
her DNA she has a gift.

10
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:56,932
Some call it a condition,
or even worse, a disorder,

11
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,935
that's just
waiting to be activated

12
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:03,564
and it makes
her anything but normal.

13
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,651
When people do bad things,

14
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,196
Lindy cannot control herself.

15
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,408
Maybe if she'd had
that normal loving family,

16
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:17,203
she could have
been extraordinary.

17
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:23,626
But, just like Lindy, mommy
and daddy had their own demons.

18
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,962
Whether it was that mummy's
pills made her so sleepy,

19
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:31,634
or that daddy got so
angry when he drank too much,

20
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,428
we'll never know.

21
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:39,892
But whatever it was, Lindy
never got the love she needed.

22
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,604
Instead, she got
angrier and angrier,

23
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,358
and her disorder
got worse and worse.

24
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:53,280
And then her parents
got her diagnosis.

25
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:57,785
The doctors called it
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

26
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,000
She could not
live safely in the world,

27
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:09,505
and no one would
be safe around her.

28
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:13,509
So to live at all,
she would have to live alone,

29
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,638
isolated from others
till the cure could be found.

30
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,725
The huge amount of cortisol
coursing through Lindy's body,

31
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,646
made her faster than
normal, stronger than normal,

32
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,732
which made her
incredibly attractive

33
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,235
to certain interested parties.

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,784
But her condition also
made her extremely volatile

35
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:48,085
and far, far
angrier than normal.

36
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:54,633
Lindy had a hair trigger.
Once provoked, she would snap.

37
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,306
Until she could gain control,
she was no use to anyone.

38
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,059
Her life as
a human lab rat began.

39
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:07,021
The results were mixed.

40
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,610
So they thought,
maybe the military

41
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,028
would give her the structure

42
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,947
to channel her unique gifts.

43
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,577
Or maybe not.

44
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,387
All right, stop!

45
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,680
Get off!

46
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,143
Get off him, now!

47
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,437
Stop means, stop!

48
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,442
They were
so kind and supportive.

49
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,861
It's a wonder it didn't help.

50
00:03:55,945 --> 00:04:00,783
Of course, all these
cures only made it worse.

51
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,036
You would think they'd
learn not to piss her off.

52
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:11,210
It was looking more and more
like they would just lock her up

53
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,003
and throw away the key.

54
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,092
Lindy would be alone, forever.

55
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:23,931
And then a breakthrough,
a chance to be normal.

56
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,768
The treatment was
brutal, barbaric, outrageous

57
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,063

Hi. I'm Lindy.

83
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:21,882
Hey!

84
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,944
Yeah, actually I'm
not staying so... um,

85
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,512
I thought a date might be fun,

86
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,906
but I'm not in
the right head-space,

87
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,389
so I didn't want to bail,

88
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,409
without saying something,
'cause I'm not a total bitch.

89
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,434
- Okay.
- So...

90
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,811
You know it's funny? Uh...

91
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,538
This isn't even
the worst date I've ever had.

92
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,856
Yeah. I feel bad...
I'm sorry about that...

93
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,941
Herpes!

94
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,401
Yeah, herpes,
chlamydia and, um, warts.

95
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,778
Uh...

96
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,946
Okay.

97
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,447
This girl just kept listing off,

98
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,158
all the sexually transmitted
infections she had. It was...

99
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,743
it was unexpected.

100
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,205
Yeah, I mean, warts
generally are, aren't they?

101
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,541
You don't have
a disaster date story?

102
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:59,586
Uh, me? No,
I don't date that much. No.

103
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,965
Oh, is that 'cause you're always
leaving before they start?

104
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,738
No, you're doing quite well.
I normally don't even come in.

105
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,180
Oh, why not?

106
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,765
Uh...

107
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,600
I hate people.

108
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,395
Like who?

109
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,982
I don't know. People who...
who talk with their mouth full

110
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:24,444
and... and, uh, people who, who
chew too loudly, people who hum.

111
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,864
Um, men who wear
jeans with flip-flops...

112
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,466
I can't stand
people who walk too slow.

113
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,491
Yeah. Exactly.

114
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,951
Or tell you to have a nice day.

115
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,929
Yeah! Like, fuck off
I might not want a nice day.

116
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,621
Or, uh, people
that talk in elevators.

117
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,165
Yeah, that's bad.

118
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,767
Yeah, aside from people
that fart in elevators.

119
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,501
That's... That's worse.

120
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,752
Do you fart in elevators?

121
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,880
Do you fart?

122
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,965
No, I'm from
England, we don't...

123
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,258
Are we ready to order?

124
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,178
I'm actually not
staying, so I don't know.

125
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,141
Sir, I'm afraid if
she won't be dining with you,

126
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,681
we will need the table back.

127
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,516
Okay.

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,934
Now.

129
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,478
Uh...

130
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,772
Okay, um...

131
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,025
Okay, I'll just, um...

132
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,985
I'll just have the chicken
really quickly then.

133
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,528
Uh...

134
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,488
Fish please,
without the pine nuts.

135
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,032
We don't do substitutions.

136
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,284
Oh, no. I'm... I'm...
I'm allergic, so...

137
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,286
It's restaurant policy.

138
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,041
Uh, okay. The pasta, please.

139
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,500
There is a walnut sauce.

140
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,544
Uh,
how about the pork chop?

141
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,962
Pistachio crust.

142
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,107
Fuck me. Perhaps you can suggest
something that might work.

143
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,442
Please don't
take that tone with me.

144
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,551
- No, I'm not.
- Sir. You are.

145
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,715
You're making it impossible
for me to impress my date

146
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,639
and it's embarrassing.

147
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,140
How about the chicken?

148
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:40,896
Sure.

149
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,439
Thank you.

150
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,650
Let me know if
you need anything else.

151
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,734
Thank you.

152
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,547
You know, if you were planning
to stab her with that knife,

153
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,739
it'd be totally cool with me.

154
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,535
Look, I have to pee actually.

155
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,204
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

156
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,962
I know, right?

157
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,506
A guy just told
his wife he is having an affair.

158
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,802
Some old woman's
dentures got stuck in her steak.

159
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,055
But hold up, you should see
the first date I just served.

160
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,473
I gave the guy some attitude

161
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,059
and he practically
cried into his napkin.

162
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,853
Yeah. And his date just sat
there and watched him squirm.

163
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,232
Oh, my God.
It was so embarrassing.

164
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,377
I mean, screwing with the
customers isn't fun anymore.

165
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,278
It's like my own
private freak show.

166
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,947
The guy had, like,

167
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,158
allergies to pretty much
everything on the menu.

168
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,327
It was pathetic.

169
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,497
I know.

170
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,124
Total losers.

171
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,542
Anyway...

172
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,553
She'll call you back.

173
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,268
Fuck!

174
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,587
Oh! Ain't you
a fine little piece...

175
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,755
Ow!

176
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,757
Fuck!

177
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,099
It's not working.

178
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,018
Okay. Fix it!

179
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,955
You're probably just
building up a tolerance.

180
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,231
No, I'm not.

181
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,566
Look, this is cutting-edge,
avant-garde treatment.

182
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,859
Okay. Well,
I'm sure you'll get

183
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,319
the Nobel Prize once
you're dead.

184
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,779
Is that a threat?

185
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,364
Can you fix it or not?

186
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,029
- All right.
- Okay.

187
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,745
Here.

188
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,958
Your emotions must
be running pretty high,

189
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,043
in order for you
to override the system.

190
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,671
Yeah. I have an unnaturally
high level of cortisol,

191
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,215
so my emotions are
running high all the time.

192
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,552
But you cannot keep
using biochemistry as an excuse,

193
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,636
all the time.

194
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,558
So, I'm assuming that the date
was a disappointment then?

195
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,892
I mean...

196
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,394
Given that its primary function,

197
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,522
was to test if I could partake
in a customary social situation

198
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,041
without beating
the shit out of someone,

199
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,185
then yeah, I would say yeah.

200
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,901
It was a... it was
a real disappointment.

201
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,278
How badly did you hurt him?

202
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,488
I didn't
even get round to him.

203
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,908
Who did you get around to?

204
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,787
A waitress. Look, it doesn't
matter. Your thing failed.

205
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,624
Lindy, this is not
a cure. I've told you that.

206
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,348
The only way we're
going to make progress,

207
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,171
is if you begin to
reconcile with your past.

208
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,505
I've told you my story.

209
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,884
But there's a difference,
between talking about your past,

210
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,094
and actually working through it.

211
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
Asphyxiation?

212
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,656
Jugular bleed.

213
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,949
Classy.

214
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,034
Here you go.

215
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,745
I've upped the voltage,

216
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,997
but there's only so much

217
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,832
that the human body can take.

218
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,627
You don't care about
me. I'm just an experiment.

219
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,088
Why would I risk my
life's work if I didn't care?

220
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,299
And why won't you admit
that you really like this guy?

221
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,926
Because I didn't.

222
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,385
Okay.

223
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,595
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

224
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,930
I think last night proved that

225
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,015
your exposure therapy
didn't work.

226
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,643
What... what... what
would you like me to do? Hmm?

227
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,526
Would you like me to
put leeches on your skin?

228
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,230
Would you like me to drill
a hole,

229
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,315
in your head to release
the demons?

230
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,567
Would you like me to
make you drink your own urine?

231
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,652
Actually tried that.

232
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,237
That's disgusting.

233
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,864
Anyway, I think
that really you need to admit,

234
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,658
that the answer to all of
your problems

235
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,369
is close,
human connection.

236
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,163
Penis is not
gonna fix me, Dr. Freud.

237
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,414
Um, I just...

238
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,791
And I've tried that as well.

239
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,727
You like this guy, so
for once have a relationship.

240
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,752
Oh, please fuck off.

241
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm talking about love.

242
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,880
No, I don't want a boyfriend!

243
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,192
We both know I'd end up knocking
his teeth down his throat.

244
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,236
Maybe you won't, but I don't
know why you would walk away,

245
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,053
from somebody
who made you feel something.

246
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,263
Ugh!

247
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,639
Okay, I'm walking away
from you,

248
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,033
'cause you're getting on
my nerves.

249
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,058
Thank you.

250
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,181
See you next week.

251
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,686
Yeah, I can't wait.

252
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,916
Looks so good.

253
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,167
Thank you so much.

254
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,919
- Not bad, huh?
- Well...

255
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,838
Not a shitty waitress in sight!

256
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,965
No.

257
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,383
I'm glad you called.

258
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,261
I'd hate to miss a second chance
to disappoint a pretty face.

259
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,054
How are you planning
on doing that?

260
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,473
I don't know.

261
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,059
Depends if you find lame-ass
accountants cool or not.

262
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,312
Well, that depends.
Who do you work for?

263
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,523
I work for a private
company. This guy named Barry.

264
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,608
You? What do you do?

265
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,193
I used to work in Security.

266
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:06,114
Okay. So you know your way
around a pair of handcuffs?

267
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:10,702
Less BDSM, more...
bouncer in a crappy bar.

268
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,163
You're not
a bouncer!

269
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,497
Yeah! What?

270
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,100
What do you weigh?
Like a Buck-O-Eight?

271
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,484
- It's not about size Justin.
- No?

272
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,877
Don't know what you've heard...

273
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,961
Then what's it about?

274
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:23,006
Other things,
like speed and endurance,

275
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,674
fearlessness, things like that.

276
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,551
Okay. What happened?

277
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,636
Mmm...

278
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,804
You crazy bitch!

279
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,849
Um...

280
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,934
I'm currently
seeking a new career path.

281
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,353
Oh, you got fired.

282
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,021
Yes. Well, it wasn't my fault.

283
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,984
It... I mean, it was
actually entirely my fault.

284
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,025
I don't know.
My heart wasn't in it.

285
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,069
No?

286
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,696
What is your heart in?

287
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,408
I like photography.

288
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,619
Yeah? What do
you take pictures of?

289
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,579
Mostly, naked accountants.

290
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,583
I don't know, just
people going about their lives.

291
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,628
I... I just... I take pictures
on my phone sometimes for fun.

292
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:02,754
It's not really...

293
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,106
It sounds kinda
voyeuristic to me.

294
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,674
Oh, I am wanking, constantly.

295
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:12,013
Well, uh... I'm sorry if
I can seem kind of boring.

296
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,766
Thank you for
apologizing. I am quite bored.

297
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,578
There's nothing
I can do about it.

298
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,372
There are a couple of
things that you could do.

299
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,605
What can I do?

300
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,201
Maybe this is a mistake.

301
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,163
I have to warn you,
I'm really crap at dating.

302
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,416
How bad could you be?

303
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:49,968
Very bad.

304
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,303
I'm not scared of you.

305
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,889
Well, maybe you should be.

306
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,297
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Hold...

307
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,384
It's, um...

308
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,179
They're... they're...

309
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,764
They're a...

310
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:36,931
Is that like a...

311
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,184
Like a kinky thing or?

312
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,603
No. No.

313
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,605
Okay.

314
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,695
Uh, look,
the thing is Justin, I...

315
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,030
- Hey.
- Um...

316
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,576
Hey...

317
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,829
It's not...

318
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:02,916
a big...

319
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,210
deal.

320
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,902
- It's okay.
- Yeah?

321
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,693
Good morning.

322
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,862
More like afternoon.

323
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,345
You look so cute
when you're asleep,

324
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,698
and I didn't wanna wake you up.

325
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,033
Not really used
to being called cute.

326
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,785
No? Well, you are.

327
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,996
When you let your guard down.

328
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,414
Your place is weird.

329
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,293
Ah, it's...
you know, it's good weird.

330
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,503
What's with all
the plastic plates and cups?

331
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,880
You just move in?

332
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,966
No, uh, just,
I... I hate washing up.

333
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,095
Well, in addition to the world's
most expensive Danish,

334
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,347
I got you a little something.

335
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,142
Wow. Am I amazing in bed?

336
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,894
Yeah.

337
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,194
Oh, my God!

338
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,781
Oh, no. That's too much.

339
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,325
No, it's not.

340
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,119
Wow!

341
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,079
- You like it?
- Love it!

342
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,247
Thank you.

343
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,170
Oh, um,
by the way, last night...

344
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,755
I... I never do that.

345
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,089
No?

346
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,257
No. I mean, never.

347
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,677
Well, I'm... I'm glad you did.

348
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,138
You are...
you're full of surprises.

349
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,266
The least of which is,
um, this whole situation.

350
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,851
You, uh, you wanna elaborate?

351
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,770
Now that we know
each other better.

352
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:32,273
Yeah. Um...

353
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,859
You know what?
You don't have to. I'm sorry.

354
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:40,865
No! I will. Uh, it's a new
treatment for this... thing.

355
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,343
You're not gonna
die on me, are you?

356
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,534
No. No, no, no.

357
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:44,803
That'd be just
my luck, you know?

358
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,621
I meet the most
amazing woman in the city

359
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,206
and you got six months to live?

360
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,124
No, I've got, um...

361
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,711
an impulse control problem.

362
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,838
And that helps
me to not have it.

363
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,507
Like Tourette's?

364
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,762
No. Um, just
tiny bit more intense.

365
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,055
Okay.

366
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:07,100
Uh, well, I mean,
have you tried meditation

367
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,184
or something?

368
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,268
Yeah, sort of.

369
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,190
Yoga...

370
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,235
Medication...

371
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,779
Extreme sports...

372
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,953
You know, I've tried
like, a whole lot of things,

373
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,162
picked up lots of useless skills

374
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:32,417
and, um, that's
the thing that... that helps.

375
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,545
Well, I don't see
anything wrong with you.

376
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,016
Mm-mmm. No, no,
no. I gotta go to work.

377
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,339
Well, can't
you say you're sick?

378
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,686
No, I can't. Barry
will totally bust my balls.

379
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,062
Oh, okay. Well, no, leave...

380
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,481
leave the balls exactly
as they are, they were good.

381
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,899
Um, but can't you say

382
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,293
that something came
up with another client?

383
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,069
Well, I only have one...

384
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,405
and he pays for
my exclusivity, so...

385
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:04,490
- Okay?
- Okay.

386
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,492
Come to my place tonight.

387
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,202
Yeah? I'll cook.

388
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,955
I'm a fucking ninja
with a piece of halibut.

389
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,587

It's fine. It's fine! Relax.

399
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,239
You're early!

400
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,425
Yes, I was excited to see you!

401
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,575
Why?

402
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,993
Because you're a genius.

403
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,621
You're a bald
and burnished genius.

404
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,747
I'm cured.

405
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,373
Oh, you saw him again?

406
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,209
And, I had an impulse, but...

407
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,752
it wasn't a
breaking his legs,

408
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,035
smash his face in, slamming...

409
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,272
Actually, there
was a bit of slamming.

410
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,966
But it was warm
and romantic and...

411
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,718
and filthy.

412
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,220
This is progress.

413
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,514
Very good.

414
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:10,973
Very good?

415
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,350
It's brilliant!

416
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,018
Listen, I took the vest off.

417
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,394
Wow! Wow.

418
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,646
A couple more weeks,

419
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,415
- I'm not even gonna need this.
- That's great!

420
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,274
But I think it's
temporary euphoria.

421
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,776
I can't stop thinking about him.

422
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,904
His hands, his face,
his hair smells really amazing...

423
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,030
Oh, my God! The penis!

424
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,508
I almost called
you in the middle of it.

425
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,617
It, like,
unfurled itself, like...

426
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,078
to ten times its length,
like... like a travel umbrella!

427
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,871
- I've only ever heard of that.
- Yeah!

428
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,206
- Never actually seen it!
- No.

429
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,600
- Grower. Amazing!
- I wouldn't know...

430
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,376
Yeah. Wow.

431
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:40,920
I didn't know those existed.

432
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,481
Oh, and he's
cooking me dinner tonight.

433
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,757
- Stop it.
- Hmm. Fish.

434
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:47,260
Fish! But you don't like fish.

435
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,095
No, but people change.

436
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,364
- They do.
- I've changed.

437
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,032
It's true.
Okay, why don't we sit down

438
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,575
and let's have
a little chat about this?

439
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,560
- Because... Okay, all right.
- Boring and snooze.

440
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:56,894
Because I want to celebrate!

441
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,396
Can we open
a bottle of something?

442
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,565
No, it's ten
o'clock in the morning.

443
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:01,875
Okay, you're being a bad friend.

444
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,360
I'm not your friend.
I'm your psychiatrist.

445
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,321
I finally want
to talk about dick,

446
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,031
you should be salivating.

447
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,118
Gross. No, look,
sit down, please, all right?

448
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,345
No, I don't
need a session today.

449
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,871
Yes, you do,
because you're manic

450
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,789
and it's making
me incredibly anxious.

451
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,475
- And I'm worried about you.
- Don't be anxious.

452
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,709
- I am though.
- I love you.

453
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,711
Okay. Uh, love you too.

454
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,671
- I love you more!
- Oh, boy.

- Justin?

460
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:19,185
No. This is Detective Vicars.

461
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,561
Homicide.

462
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,526
But how do
you know it was murder?

463
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,153
His body was
found in a dumpster,

464
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,072
with two gunshot
wounds to the head.

465
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,828
Were you together very long?

466
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:41,624
Tonight was
gonna be our third date.

467
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:45,378
He was... was
gonna cook me dinner.

468
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,256
Fish.

469
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,507
Salmon?

470
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,217
Halibut.

471
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,927
Hmm.

472
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,971
You know any of his friends,
family or coworkers?

473
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,015
No. I... I know
he's an accountant.

474
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,935
He... was an accountant.

475
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,187
But he only had one client.

476
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,189
Some guy named Barry.

477
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,524
We're gonna find who did this.

478
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,126
Let's not give
the lady false hope.

479
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,694
Statistically, it's unlikely.

480
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,213
I'm not giving her anything.

481
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,673
I'm reassuring
her we're gonna do our best.

482
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,156
Some people prefer honesty.

483
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,300
Some people prefer compassion.

484
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,826
Can I see him?

485
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,244
No. Family only right now.

486
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,620
Can I talk to his family?

487
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:20,973
We haven't been
able to find anyone yet.

488
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,391
But then who's
gonna mind if I see him?

489
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,708
Policy's gonna mind.

490
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,793
- Those are the rules.
- She loves rules.

491
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,838
Look, we really are
very sorry, for your loss.

492
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,882
Aah!

493
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,913
Sounds like
your guy was involved

494
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,355
in some pretty sketchy business.

495
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,775
Dodged a bullet or two.

496
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,736
All right, listen.
Just give us a call,

497
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,279
if you remember anything else.

498
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,156
Thanks.

499
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,538
What the fuck-hell was that?

500
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,582
She was upset.

501
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,685
She's grieving, I'm... I'm
just trying to comfort her.

502
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,336
I think she's angry.

503
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,046
I don't think so.

504
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,548
That's why you like her.

505
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,675
You like 'em with
a little rage bottled up inside.

506
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,385
Better in bed,

507
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,055
until it blows up in
your stupid-ass face.

508
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:23,225
"I'm a big strong policeman."

509
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,812
"Let me embrace you, and
comfort your grieving vagina."

510
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,982
I don't
wanna comfort a vagina.

511
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:01,263
It's not a big deal.

512
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,374
Stop!

513
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,209
You fixed me, now he's dead!

514
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,003
Ah! It's not working.

515
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,606
I'm going to get you a sedative.

516
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,215
Now, you have
to stop shocking yourself.

517
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,300
Lindy? Lindy?

518
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,352
I'm not scared of you.

519
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:04,785
Lindy?

520
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:07,621
Lindy?

521
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,209
Lindy?

522
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,128
Where is it?

523
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,380
You're holding it.

524
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:21,594
How do you feel?

525
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,474
I want to crush
your skull with my bare hands.

526
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,478
I'm sorry about Justin.

527
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,231
I mean, they acted
like it was no big deal.

528
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:35,983
Who?

529
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,318
The police.

530
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,161
Well, don't focus on
them. Focus on yourself.

531
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,197
It's obvious
they thought his boss

532
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,907
had something to do with it.

533
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,576
Which, I mean, of course.
Right? He only had one client.

534
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,911
That's a bit weird, isn't it?

535
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,413
I am sure they'll figure it out.

536
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,748
Fuck them!

537
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,167
No, I need to
find out who did this.

538
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,294
I have to talk to Justin's boss.

539
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,712
What if
you just took a moment,

540
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,835
- and you felt...
- What if

541
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,881
I just snapped your neck?

542
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,342
I'm gonna find
the fuckers who did this.

543
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,052
If you go down that path,

544
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,346
you are never,
ever going to get better.

545
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,139
Fuck.

546
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,641
You're gonna kill somebody.

547
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,601
- You're fucking right I am.
- Wait!

548
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,870
I have to
tell you something...

549
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,521
Look! Some people cry. Some
people drink.

550
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,524
Some people write
shit poetry. I hurt people.

551
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,108
Might as well
put it to good use.

552
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:40,756
Vicars.

553
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,508
Hi,
Detective Vicars?

554
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,009
I need to talk to you.

555
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:48,180
I... I think I have more
information but I'm scared.

556
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,849
Can you come
meet me at my place?

557
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,768
Yeah. Yeah,
we'll be right there.

558
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,970
Hello?

559
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,057
Hi, Lindy,
it's Detective Vicars.

560
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,183
Lindy?

561
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,645
Hello Detective. You're
angry, right?

562
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,188
Why are you stealing evidence?

563
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,190
Because I want to
find out what happened.

564
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,775
That's my job.

565
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,444
Uh-huh. How's
that going for you?

566
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:08,821
I found you, didn't I?

567
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,989
- What?
- My partner wants to bring you

568
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,784
in for interfering with an
investigation, and robbery and

569
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,261
probably a whole
bunch of other stuff

570
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,745
'cause she's
ridiculously thorough.

571
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,498
But I wanted to give you the
chance to come in on your own

572
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,375
and clear up this
misunderstanding.

573
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,419
Without all the, you know, jail.

574
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,837
She's on her way up now.

575
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,214
- Fucking balls. Where are you?
- I'm parked out front.

576
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,716
She's not going
to shoot me, is she?

577
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,800
No, of course not.

578
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,885
- Freeze!
- Fuck!

579
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,054
Then again, she might...

580
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,681
So here's what's gonna happen.

581
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,118
You're gonna put your arms over
your head, I'm gonna cuff you,

582
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,893
I'm gonna take
you down to the station,

583
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,163
- and then I'm gonna book you.
- What if I have other plans?

584
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,480
I'll fucking shoot you.

585
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,774
And then waste a bunch
of time writing up a report,

586
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,026
instead of hunting
down your boyfriend's killer.

587
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,737
Wasn't actually
my boyfriend yet.

588
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,863
Commitment issues?

589
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,448
It was early days.

590
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,426
As if dating in
the city wasn't hard enough.

591
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,285
You finally find a good man,

592
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,579
and boom,
two bullets to the brain.

593
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,164
Your partner is a trip, Vicars.

594
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,832
Hey, Nevin...

595
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,292
Is that?

596
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,128
Are you fucking kidding me?

597
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,963
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

598
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:18,849
Please don't tell me,

599
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,768
you just called
this murder suspect...

600
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,689
Sorry. Having a bad day.

601
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,941
- Freeze!
- I didn't kill him!

602
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,110
Bitch.

603
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,537
- Hello?
- Oh. Hi, Detective.

604
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,874
Lindy, is everything
okay up there? Is Nevin okay?

605
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,793
Little
busy at the moment.

606
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,127
Busy doing what?

607
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,340
Remembering
how to drive stick.

608
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,424
What?

609
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,472
- Stupid motherfucker.
- Ow, ow, ow.

610
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,809
Holy shit! I know that sound.

611
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,811
That's a McLaren 600LT Spider?

612
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,270
It's a car.

613
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,025
A really fast one.

614
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,194
Are you still on the phone
with that kooky cuntcicle?

615
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,326
Fucking go! Go! Go!

616
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,874
Where did you learn to drive?
You even trying to catch her?

617
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,209
I'm flooring it!

618
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,895
Guys, it's
quite hard to concentrate

619
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,087
with you two bickering.

620
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,930
Oh!

621
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,766
Oh, crap!

622
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,186
- Come on, Lindy.
- Ooh.

623
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,206
I think I'm starting to get
the hang of this stick shift.

624
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,607
Oh, shit. Reverse!

625
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,161
Damn it!

626
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,500
Lindy, please stay on the phone.
I'm trying to help you.

627
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,003
Okay. I really
have to concentrate now,

628
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,963
so, it's been
really nice catching up.

629
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,049
No, wait! You go
through with this and you're...

630
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,593
You're on your own.

631
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:18,677
Same as always.

632
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,471
Lindy!

633
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,182
Damn it!

634
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,434
Shit!

635
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,251
I'm trying to help you. You're
going to get somebody killed.

636
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,395
If you think I had anything to
do with Justin's death,

637
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,130
then you're shitter at your
jobs than I thought.

638
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,339
We don't think you killed
Justin...

639
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,364
Speak for yourself!

640
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,873
Whoa! Argh!

641
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,153
- Get 'em!
- Yeah!

642
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,079
Ah! The fuck...

643
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,790
- I'm not doing it.
- Don't bitch out!

644
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,958
Fine! Fine! Fine!

645
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,178
Fuck.

646
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,767
If you
can't ascertain the cause,

647
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,376
of the outbreak,
then you have no idea,

648
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,187
how many zombies
you'll have to kill over time.

649
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,380
A lightsaber
would solve both problems.

650
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,924
We specified
a real-world scenario.

651
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,218
Yeah, a real zombie apocalypse.

652
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,341
Besides, there's no way
to recharge the lightsaber's

653
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,056
Diatium power cell
after it ran out.

654
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,267
Diatium power cells
don't run out of energy.

655
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,518
They recycle it.

656
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,064
Who's in charge around here?

657
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,026
I'm... I... I'm the manager.

658
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,235
If you're the manager

659
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,879
then you're the last person,
I want to talk to.

660
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,881
I need someone who actually
knows what they're doing.

661
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,785
Who's the biggest
geek you've got in this place?

662
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:47,868
- Andy.
- Andy.

663
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,952
Andy.

664
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,049
Okay, so what? Forget
your password or something?

665
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,175
No.

666
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,052
It's more, the man
I loved was murdered

667
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,803
and I stole
his phone from the police,

668
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,239
and now I've got to
track down the bad guy

669
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,307
before they do, so
I can kill the shit out of them.

670
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,184
Oh! Cool.

671
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,399
And... we're in.

672
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,525
Oh, wow. You're good.

673
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,069
Obviously.

674
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,238
Not much here, no
history. This must be a burner.

675
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,883
Your boyfriend
a drug dealer or something?

676
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,158
No, accountant.

677
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,703
I mean, he wasn't...
We weren't... yet. You know.

678
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,372
Yeah. Right, right. I get it.

679
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,583
- I don't.
- Did your mouth just fart, Doug?

680
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,834
Sorry.

681
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,688
The last seven calls,

682
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,340
came from
an abandoned building downtown.

683
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,509
- Shady.
- What does that mean?

684
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,511
I'm not sure.
Lets see who owns it.

685
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,892
Barry Kasparzki. Whoa!

686
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,353
FBI files showed
ties to arms dealers.

687
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,313
Holy shit!

688
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,856
That's the guy.

689
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,109
How much do I owe you?

690
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,361
Trust me, you can't afford me.

691
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,529
Thanks.

692
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,739
Oh.

693
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,554
Boys, boys, boys!

694
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,031
Whatever it is
you're fighting over,

695
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,599
I'm sure we can all talk it out.

696
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,933
Money...

697
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:19,477
Yeah. You know, like bets?

698
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,646
Oh! Duh.

699
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,332
Is it too late to put
a dollar on the other one?

700
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,584
Just 'cause
you're a bit of a bleeder

701
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:25,835
and you drop
your left when you hook.

702
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,027
What's going on?

703
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,405
Oh, are you Barry? I guess so.

704
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,656
Just, you seem like,

705
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,050
you have
the biggest dick in here, so...

706
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,075
What do you want?

707
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,577
Well, I wanted
to pick your brains,

708
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,454
about the phone
calls you have with the...

709
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,289
accountant that works for you.

710
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,415
Did you kill him?

711
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,627
What are you? Cop? Fed?

712
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,545
Oh no, girlfriend.

713
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:46,922
I mean, I say girlfriend.

714
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,965
We went on,
like, two dates but...

715
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,468
you know, I was really
hopeful, I was crossing fingers.

716
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,719
I didn't kill any accountant.

717
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,262
- But you know who did.
- Probably!

718
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,722
Well, amazing!

719
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,058
I mean, that saves me
a massive headache. Barry!

720
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,684
You're a sweetheart.

721
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,561
I didn't say I'd tell you.

722
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,623
Oh, seriously? Are you gonna
make me go through the whole,

723
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,982
face-stomping,
bone-breaking routine?

724
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,526
Okay, fine.

725
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,570
I tell you what.

726
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,614
How about I beat
three of your best guys,

727
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,241
and you tell me the name?

728
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:15,992
Sounds like fun.

729
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,703
You, you and you.

730
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,539
But not three in a row.

731
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,041
All at the same time.

732
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,210
I like a man who challenges me.

733
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,714
Okay, so what
are the, like, rules?

734
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,132
No rules.

735
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,385
Oh.

736
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,887
All right.

737
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,570
Oh!

738
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,637
Aah!

739
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,396
Lucky guess.

740
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,945
That's enough!

741
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,613
Fight's over!

742
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,825
Everybody out!

743
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,702
If he had a bigger Adam's apple,

744
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,846
this'd be really working for me.

745
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:58,136
You don't mind, do you?

746
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,472
I'm just a bit
parched after that.

747
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,100
Oh! I needed that.

748
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,269
Okay, you were gonna
tell me who killed Justin?

749
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,232
Those men back there,

750
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,109
they work for me,

751
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:16,029
they respect me and
they pay tribute to me.

752
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,697
They do this,

753
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:20,533
because they know,
that I am a man of my word.

754
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:21,743
Now...

755
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:25,622
Business like this,
I like to keep private.

756
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,332
'Cause the truth is,

757
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,502
all that I have is
because of one thing,

758
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,504
and one thing only.

759
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:33,797
And that is...

760
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,800
that I have never
been a man of my word.

761
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,679
So, if you'll excuse me,

762
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,182
I don't like to
get business on my suit.

763
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,266
Okay.

764
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,726
What is it about gross old men

765
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,354
always underestimating women?

766
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,862
Interesting ball color.

767
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,364
What we calling that? Ox-blood?

768
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,824
Claret?

769
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,451
Just like a woman,
straight for the nuts!

770
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,221
No. I only do
that when I'm in hurry.

771
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,539
Although, evolution hasn't
really been kind to you guys,

772
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,125
putting the on-off switch,
dangling around in front

773
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,085
for any predator
to come by and flick.

774
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,003
Now, who killed him?

775
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,088
I don't know.

776
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,339
Don't be silly!

777
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:17,882
Gareth Fizel!

778
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,300
Gareth Fizel!

779
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,844
Yeah, he's my boss.

780
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,929
Why would
he kill his accountant?

781
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,681
Maybe he was skimming the books.

782
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,850
Look, even the government,

783
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,185
ain't dumb
enough to go after Fizel.

784
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,479
Are you really that stupid?

785
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:34,315
You know what? I think
I am exactly that stupid.

786
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,828
You enjoying that?

787
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,457
Mmm. Background check came in.

788
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,251
Your li'l girlfriend,
she's got a history of violence.

789
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,712
Assault. Harassment.

790
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,882
Interesting job history
too. Classified-type shit.

791
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:01,634
So she's got skills
and an anger issue.

792
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:02,927
Not a great combo.

793
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,655
I still don't think,
she's the type to blow

794
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:05,680
her boyfriend's head off.

795
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,432
Hope not, or else you're next.

796
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,561
She's got a short fuse.
Doesn't make her a murderer.

797
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,688
That's what happens
when you don't follow protocol.

798
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,691
Sometimes common
sense trumps protocol.

799
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,570
Nah. I'm good being the superior
one in this relationship.

800
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,365
Wha... Hey! What
am I supposed to eat?

801
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,785
I'll see what I can swipe from
the gunshot victim next door.

802
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:32,290
Always taking such good
care of me. Thank you, partner.

803
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,631
Aw, allergic to latex?

804
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,257
You're no fun.

805
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:45,345
Wow! Impressive
urine output. Good for you.

806
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,763
Oh, don't bother.

807
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,324
I'll run away and
you'll get yourself all

808
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,475
emasculated trying to catch me.

809
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,935
Here. I did get a bouquet,

810
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,853
but I gave it to
this woman in the elevator.

811
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:55,188
She was...

812
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,190
Just been diagnosed
with something horrible

813
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,153
and couldn't stop
crying. It was really awkward.

814
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,027
Glad to see you're all right.

815
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,196
I wanted to say thank
you for warning me and...

816
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,489
I wasn't warning you.

817
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,452
I was giving you a chance
to do the right thing.

818
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,368
Well, thank you for
giving me the chance.

819
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,162
Look, I found
out who killed Justin.

820
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:12,664
Who?

821
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:13,998
Gareth Fizel.

822
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,960
You got any proof?

823
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,212
Well, obviously
not the sort of person

824
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,005
who gives a fuck about proof.

825
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,007
What do you know about him?

826
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,425
Billionaire recluse

827
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,403
with his fingers in a bunch
of different illegal pies.

828
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,054
He's pretty much untouchable.

829
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:29,305
Oh, I'm gonna touch him.

830
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:31,015
Hard.

831
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:33,268
And a lot. And not in
a way he's gonna enjoy.

832
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,520
Where can I find him?

833
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,438
Why you doing this?

834
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:40,483
Is this Justin really
worth you risking your life for?

835
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,819
Yeah, it was early
days. I didn't know him.

836
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,862
I didn't know half
the shit he was caught up in.

837
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,699
But I do know,
he was a decent guy.

838
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,492
He didn't
deserve to die like that.

839
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:50,577
Nobody does.

840
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,036
Well, no, but...

841
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,539
Most people make me
want to run away screaming,

842
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,708
or snap their fingers
off. He was...

843
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:58,918
He was nice.

844
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:01,212
He was... He was really nice.

845
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,839
There's lots of
nice guys out there.

846
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,299
Yeah.

847
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,175
They're all frightened of me.

848
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:07,885
He wanted to cook me fish.

849
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,558
The Imperion Tower. Downtown.

850
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,852
Thank you.

851
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,395
I can't let you go there.

852
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,814
You're not in a great
position to stop me, are you?

853
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,107
But I am.

854
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:24,027
Get back!

855
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,579
Get back here right now!

856
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,390
Stop!

857
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,228
Sorry.

858
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,647
Bitch, get back here!

859
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:54,409
Fuck.

860
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,541
Shh!

861
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:06,796
Shh!

862
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:10,550
Shh!

863
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,561
Shh!

864
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:28,735
Ow!

865
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:29,819
Fuck!

866
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:36,576
Shh! Stop it. Stop it.

867
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:40,955
Freeze!

868
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,417
Don't move, don't
breathe, don't fucking fart!

869
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,543
Oh, come on.

870
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,854
You're not
gonna start shit in here.

871
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:47,920
I will shoot you.

872
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:49,839
Put the gun down.

873
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,174
Why would I do that?

874
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,550
Because I want you to be ready.

875
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,010
Ready for what?

876
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:55,970
This!

877
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,848
Catch!

878
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,727
Freeze!

879
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,103
Don't you dare!

880
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:06,272
Don't do it.

881
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,523
- Seriously?
- I trust you!

882
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:13,613
Aah!

883
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,907
Oh.

884
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,870
Can I help you?

885
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:05,373
Gareth Fizel.

886
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,458
There's no one
here by that name.

887
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,668
Okay.

888
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,312
It's gonna be a lot
less painful for you,

889
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,980
if you just point me
in the right direction.

890
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:13,005
Good evening.

891
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:15,925
Can I be of assistance?

892
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,053
Mr. Delacroix, this woman...

893
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,514
is asking for a Mr. Fizel.

894
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,307
And she threatened me.

895
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,435
You're fired.

896
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,520
For what?

897
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,105
Your tone. Miss?

898
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,024
Right this way.

899
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,824
That was some
pretty epic dick swinging.

900
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,199
That's strange.
I would've thought,

901
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,017
the big cheese
would be on the top floor.

902
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,186
He is.

903
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,271
Aah!

904
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,653
Ow!

905
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:22,533
Clean blow to my brachial
plexus nerve group. Good one.

906
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:26,412
Um...

907
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,706
You must be Security,

908
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:31,250
unless this is some
really fucked up date.

909
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:32,627
Head of. And you are?

910
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,045
About to pee my pants.

911
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,631
I had, like, four
Red Bulls on the way here.

912
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,799
Is that what
the drain in the floor is for?

913
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,761
What are these for?

914
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,804
That is a really
bad idea to take those.

915
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,307
- I need them.
- What for?

916
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,934
A bad heart.

917
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:50,061
Well, they're mine now.

918
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,729
Why are you here?

919
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:52,956
I need to see your boss.

920
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,273
Regarding what?

921
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:55,608
He killed Justin.

922
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:56,734
Justin who?

923
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,653
His accountant.

924
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,571
Why would
he have killed your Justin?

925
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,658
Oh, I don't know.
Boring everyday, bean counter

926
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,993
who's cooking the books
for a shady arms dealer,

927
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:08,537
suddenly assassinated
and tossed in a dumpster.

928
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:11,290
Sounds like he had
information to disclose.

929
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:13,584
Seemed like a solid lead.

930
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:15,628
I mean, that and Barry told me.

931
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:18,506
Are you a relation
of the deceased?

932
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,675
No. I was...

933
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,844
- Not, we were...
- I see.

934
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,513
- Do you?
- No.

935
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,515
Nor do I desire to.

936
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,977
I am going to give you a chance
to vacate the premises,

937
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,937
peacefully.

938
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,480
What if I don't?

939
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,900
You will find out what
the drainage system is for.

940
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,903
And I will be keeping those.

941
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:11,183
My life vest...

942
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,022
I need my vest.

943
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:05,946
Apologies for the disturbance.

944
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,656
We've had a visitor, a woman.

945
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,701
She's peculiar.

946
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,205
I need to get out of the car.

947
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,501
Can you let me out of the car?

948
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,170
Look, miss, I don't
want to seem overly familiar,

949
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,421
but I gotta take you home.

950
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:24,465
Unlock this door and let me out!

951
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,384
Asking about an accountant.

952
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,138
A concern?

953
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,891
Let me out of
the car for your sake!

954
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,559
- Miss!
- Let me out!

955
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:37,019
Let me out!

956
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:38,646
I wasn't sure
who may have been aware,

957
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,273
of her presence
here, so I opted to let her go.

958
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:46,362
But enough of
a concern to bother me with.

959
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,207
I'm sorry.

960
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,416
I'm sorry!

961
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,552
More like an unknown variable.

962
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:15,099
You know... I don't
like unknown variables.

963
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,433
Deal with her.

964
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,445
Please help me?

965
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:29,905
Oh, fuck!

966
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,700
What are you doing here?

967
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,493
I lost my device.

968
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,954
Do you have another
here? I really need it. Please?

969
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,792
What happened to the lamp?

970
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,378
I figured, if things
got really bad, I could

971
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,796
bite down on both ends.

972
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,174
Don't do that.

973
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:56,932
Sorry.

974
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,643
Thanks.

975
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:02,104
Have you seen
that movie Old Yeller?

976
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:03,355
Uh, yeah. It's a classic.

977
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:05,691
I've never seen it,
but I know how it ends.

978
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:08,861
So if I... try anything,

979
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:10,738
kill me.

980
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,329
If I make this thing for you,

981
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,830
will you stop
going after this guy?

982
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,667
No.

983
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:26,295
But I can promise more
innocent people won't get hurt

984
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,546
along the way.

985
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:30,799
Okay.

986
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,556
Do you want some Chinese food?

987
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,684
There's Kung Pao chicken
and sweet and sour... something,

988
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:43,604
and some... egg
rolls and all that.

989
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,105
You should eat something.

990
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,941
Don't touch
the shrimp fried rice.

991
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,027
That's mine.

992
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,199
I'll get the vest.

993
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,918
Je... Jesus!
What are you doing?

994
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:31,479
I'm hiding from
the beat cops down the street.

995
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:32,504
What are you doing?

996
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:34,131
Is sitting outside my apartment,

997
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,109
some kind of police foreplay?
Are you wearing my knickers?

998
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,134
I'm doing my job.

999
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,510
Oh.

1000
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:41,430
I see we've taken down
another major drug kingpin.

1001
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:45,059
He got sent home from school
for setting the class pet free.

1002
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,560
Hmm. Hamster?

1003
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,104
Rabbit. Hey, listen to me.

1004
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:51,940
There's some pretty nasty guys
in the hospital, you know, and

1005
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:54,026
their description of
the deranged psycho

1006
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,295
who put them there matches you.

1007
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,946
What? Come on. Little old me?

1008
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,132
How could you possibly think

1009
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,300
I could do anything like that?

1010
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,242
Don't fuck
around with me, Lindy.

1011
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:05,371
Okay, but not now,
I need you to look after this.

1012
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,598
I'm not dumping
evidence for you!

1013
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,123
I'm not asking you to.

1014
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:10,376
Look, I'm... I'm
giving you the chance

1015
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,710
to turn yourself in here.

1016
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:14,463
Okay, I will! Just not yet.

1017
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,715
Hey, listen to me.

1018
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,218
Fizel's not some
dickbag gangster, okay?

1019
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:20,445
He's going to be looking for you

1020
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,012
and he's going to kill you.

1021
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:23,931
Right. Well, he already tried.

1022
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,533
I think someone has
been in my apartment...

1023
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,184
Right, that's it.

1024
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,353
- It ain't your choice anymore.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1025
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,772
That's a very
bad idea. I've got...

1026
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,399
this condition. Okay?

1027
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:36,443
It makes me snap. I can't
control it and I hurt people.

1028
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,946
I wear this thing,
that gives me electric shocks,

1029
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,531
so that I can stop it happening.

1030
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,491
But, really, I really
don't want to hurt you

1031
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,618
or anybody else.

1032
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,739
I don't think you'd hurt me.

1033
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,455
- No?
- No.

1034
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,083
Would you leave
me on my own with him?

1035
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,294
- Yeah.
- Bollocks!

1036
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,130
Well, I don't think
you'd hurt him either.

1037
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,297
You sure?

1038
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,093
What that thing feel like?

1039
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,143
Come on?

1040
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,440
- What are you...
- Here.

1041
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:26,410
Okay, you know
what that tells me?

1042
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,537
I'm way more
screwed up than you thought.

1043
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,789
No. No, it tells me
that you'd rather hurt yourself

1044
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:32,082
than somebody else.

1045
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:35,127
Nevin says
I treat you different

1046
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,378
because you're a woman.

1047
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:37,838
She says...

1048
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:38,922
I'm going easy on you.

1049
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:40,757
Is she right?

1050
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:42,885
I treat you different
because you are different.

1051
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:53,395
Nobody is looking for me now.

1052
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:54,730
Lindy!

1053
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,067
Whoa!

1054
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:00,444
What's that?

1055
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,987
Dad?

1056
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:04,281
fuck!

1057
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,044
Lindy, listen to me!

1058
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,046
I'm a little
busy at the moment.

1059
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,173
Look, Lindy I don't
wanna play games anymore.

1060
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,509
You have to stop
looking for Justin's killer.

1061
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:24,718
You're gonna get hurt.

1062
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,720
I know what you're capable of.

1063
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,163
I read all
about it in your file...

1064
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,450
Okay. Are you done looking me up
on some bullshit database?

1065
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:31,934
'Cause, listen, Detective.

1066
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,353
I'm gonna do what I need to do.

1067
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,438
Lindy I don't wanna
see you wind up dead.

1068
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:37,856
Just let us do our job.

1069
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,067
So, what?

1070
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,945
Does that mean you are gonna
go in and arrest Fizel?

1071
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:45,155
Yes, thought not.

1072
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:20,649
Fuck.

1073
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,572
I was hoping to see you.

1074
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:52,264
You like lobster?

1075
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:58,270
Uh, I always thought
it was overrated and overpriced.

1076
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,398
Most people don't realize

1077
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:06,528
that lobster's belong in
the same biological phylum

1078
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,030
as cockroaches.

1079
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:14,870
They are both anthropods
with segmented bodies.

1080
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:19,416
They both have the same compound
eyes and jointed legs.

1081
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,461
Even their meat is the same.

1082
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,963
Lobsters must be boiled alive.

1083
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:27,299
Cockroaches poisoned.

1084
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,468
Wow.

1085
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:33,180
Ugly and boring.
What a winning combination.

1086
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,098
What the fuck has
this got to do with me?

1087
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,018
You are an odd specimen.

1088
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:45,734
Not sure what, uh,
phylum you belong in.

1089
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,277
Me neither.

1090
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:49,946
That's something my therapist
and I are really delving in to.

1091
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:53,200
I understand
you are here to kill me.

1092
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:56,536
Something about an accountant?

1093
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,749
Your... boyfriend?

1094
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:04,503
We hadn't put a label on
it, but he was pretty special.

1095
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,755
I kill a lot of people,

1096
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:11,468
I suppose some of them
may be accountants. I'm...

1097
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,182
I'm sorry I killed yours.

1098
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,642
Well, apology not accepted...

1099
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,185
You creepy fuck.

1100
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,521
Rude...

1101
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:30,195
You are certainly
a... a rare species.

1102
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:36,076
I'm glad I took this
opportunity to get one good,

1103
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,745
long, hard look at you.

1104
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:41,915
Okay, but can you do it...

1105
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:50,090
Without,

1106
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,718
whacking me on
the head this time.

1107
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:53,802
Fuck.

1108
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,180
Fuck.

1109
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,851
Balls!

1110
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,936
Fuck balls indeed.

1111
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:05,856
I'm getting the feeling

1112
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,316
there's no cookie
and juice after this.

1113
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,609
Not for you.

1114
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,194
Wait, wait, wait!

1115
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,155
Justin...

1116
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:15,449
Did you pull the trigger?

1117
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:20,036
No. I didn't.
Though I wish I had.

1118
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:25,000
This is going
to take a sec so...

1119
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,836
- Sit back, relax.
- Fuck!

1120
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:29,679
- Enjoy the ride.
- What are you doing to me?

1121
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,717
Do you know what
exsanguination means?

1122
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,762
The drainage of one's blood.

1123
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:43,310
Aah!

1124
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:10,545
Aah!

1125
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:13,507
Aah!

1126
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,612
I have a few questions.

1127
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,615
How do I get to Fizel?

1128
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,301
Hey! Where
do you think you're going?

1129
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,596
Get ready to die, you sick fuck!

1130
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:46,451
Justin!

1131
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,662
Bravo. Well done!

1132
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,666
You know,
I gotta admit Lindy, uh...

1133
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:53,893
Right toward the end there I...

1134
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,835
I didn't think you had it in ya.

1135
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,837
So, my apologies.

1136
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:00,256
I decided to take
care of Fizel myself.

1137
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:03,843
What are you covered in?

1138
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:05,220
Is it that time of the month?

1139
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,931
But you...

1140
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:11,184
I saw you. How?

1141
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,310
The guy in the casket?

1142
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:14,312
No.

1143
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:16,189
Aah, some bum off the street.

1144
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,440
Jesus Christ!

1145
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,912
Yeah, I just paid
off the coroner, you know?

1146
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:22,988
Why?

1147
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:24,948
I had to
get Fizel out of the way.

1148
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,200
But the CIA can't
operate on US soil.

1149
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,411
Even the government,

1150
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,538
wouldn't be dumb
enough to go after him.

1151
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,289
Exactly.

1152
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:35,017
Yeah! I needed someone
from the outside, you know?

1153
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,752
Someone to draw
the attention away from myself.

1154
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:40,338
Someone who couldn't
be traced back to me.

1155
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:41,756
So you chose me?

1156
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,384
Why?

1157
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,053
A glowing
recommendation from Dr. Munchin.

1158
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:48,430
I mean, who do you think funds

1159
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,306
his batshit crazy experiments?

1160
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,808
But see, I...

1161
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:54,644
I knew you
were something else. Yeah.

1162
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:57,022
My little kamikaze K-9.

1163
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,399
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1164
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:02,277
Well, in the
Second World War, uh...

1165
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,279
they strapped bombs to dogs

1166
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,448
and they would train
them to run into enemy tanks.

1167
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:07,824
Right?

1168
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,719
The puppies thought they were
just gonna get a treat

1169
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:12,579
or something, but they got
detonated into dog-burger.

1170
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:13,955
Yeah.

1171
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,582
So I just had
to figure out what treats

1172
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,335
I needed to use
to train you to take out Fizel.

1173
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,259
And if you failed or
got killed in the process,

1174
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,131
well, you know? Cost me nothing.

1175
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,133
That's why you were perfect.

1176
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,551
Where's my car by the way?

1177
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:29,054
Who the fuck are you?

1178
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:30,346
Who am I?

1179
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,308
I'm the only one
keeping this old shitbag

1180
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:34,851
from killing innocent people!

1181
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,103
Fizel was an asset
that became a liability.

1182
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:38,271
Everybody wanted him dead,

1183
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,397
but nobody can touch him.

1184
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:43,151
And you think this masochistic

1185
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:46,446
piece of shit
was ever gonna stop?

1186
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:51,117
Not so untouchable
anymore, are ya handsome?

1187
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,535
Huh?

1188
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:55,080
You lowlife piece of shit.

1189
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:57,040
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1190
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:02,170
You could try. Or
we just... fuck instead.

1191
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:17,519
What? We had fun, right?

1192
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:20,855
I mean,
you did all this for me?

1193
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,109
You must really be into me.

1194
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,154
What the fuck?

1195
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:29,739
Was that too strong for ya?

1196
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:33,451
Oh, sorry. I did a bit of
tinkering.

1197
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:35,745
Ow!

1198
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:37,681
You know what though?
It's gonna turn out to be,

1199
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,707
a really beautiful story, Lindy.

1200
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,584
Desperate, little

1201
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:43,753
broken princess

1202
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:46,714
avenges the death
of her lover and then...

1203
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:48,216
takes her own life.

1204
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:52,470
Motherfucker!

1205
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,642
Oops.

1206
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,147
You know what's funny?

1207
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:04,150
I thought you'd be
harder to crack. I really did!

1208
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,860
'Cause you seemed
pretty messed up.

1209
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:10,405
You know, in... in
an interesting way, but...

1210
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,990
No, you're easy.

1211
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:19,539
Well, it turns out all
you needed was to be fucked.

1212
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:46,357
You know what?

1213
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:48,109
It is actually
that time of the month.

1214
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:51,070
Unlucky for you, fuckface.

1215
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:55,658
What the fuck is this?

1216
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:57,619
A parting gift!

1217
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:03,499
Eat shit!

1218
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,079
I'm sorry.

1219
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,956
- You backstabbing fuck!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1220
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,999
I had no idea what
they were going to do with you.

1221
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,627
I'm assuming that both
Justin and Fizel are dead?

1222
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,128
Uh-huh. Guess who's next.

1223
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,965
No, no, no. Wait,
wait. Remember, we set you free.

1224
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:53,928
Well, yeah I didn't
think your exposure therapy,

1225
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:55,301
would be quite
so fucking extreme.

1226
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:57,637
Yeah, but look,
it... it was able to show you

1227
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,180
how extraordinary you are.

1228
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:01,516
You served me up
like a lamb to the slaughter.

1229
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:03,309
I had no idea!

1230
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:05,061
But look at you. Lindy.

1231
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,689
You're so special.

1232
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,232
I'm a freak. Are
you gonna shoot me?

1233
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:10,441
What?

1234
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:11,669
No, I don't
think so. I don't know...

1235
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,569
- What have you got that for?
- Sorry.

1236
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:16,030
You're not
a freak. You're magnificent.

1237
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:18,449
Now, we can
really start to work.

1238
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:19,701
Now.

1239
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,470
Think about the things
that we can do together...

1240
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,664
Are you out of
your mind? You betrayed me!

1241
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:26,600
I helped you more than
anybody else in the world.

1242
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,625
Fuck you!

1243
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,263
- Stop fucking moving.
- Lindy, drop the gun!

1244
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:41,848
- Hold on!
- You're hurting me!

1245
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,725
- Drop the gun! Okay.
- I'm not done!

1246
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,229
- Ah, fuck! You shot me!
- Fuck.

1247
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:49,999
Sorry, I thought
you were trying to kill him.

1248
01:16:50,023 --> 01:16:51,983
No, you twat! I was
doing your job for you,

1249
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,234
- again.
- Don't call me twat!

1250
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:55,038
Ivan Marcellus Munchin,
you are under arrest

1251
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,380
for practicing medicine
without a license.

1252
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:57,488
- Ow!
- All right.

1253
01:16:57,572 --> 01:16:58,781
I'm gonna keep pressure on it.

1254
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,825
Take your finger
off my leg hole.

1255
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:02,869
Little help?

1256
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,371
And the security guards?

1257
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:08,916
Uh, self-defense.

1258
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,794
And the incident
with the jumper cables?

1259
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:14,339
Also self-defense.

1260
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:15,923
Self-defense.

1261
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:18,384
And the maternity ward?

1262
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:19,886
Mistaken identity.

1263
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,724
What happened
to "living by the rules"?

1264
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,976
Some rules are
better than others.

1265
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,604
What, does this
mean I'm not going to jail?

1266
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,147
You're going to jail.

1267
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,231
You attacked me.

1268
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:34,650
You drove around
the city like a lunatic,

1269
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:37,111
in a car that costs
more than my yearly pay.

1270
01:17:37,195 --> 01:17:38,529
You're going to jail, sweetie.

1271
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:40,323
I see you out front.

1272
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,576
- And I'll see you in court.
- Look forward to it, Detective.

1273
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,661
This is every day for me.

1274
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,836
They took it off
you in the ambulance.

1275
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,673
So, what's next?

1276
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:00,718
Um, I don't know,
I start over I guess.

1277
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:03,554
Just... no more blind dates.

1278
01:18:03,638 --> 01:18:06,349
Hmm, that's
probably a good idea.

1279
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:07,809
Lots of creeps out there.

1280
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:10,186
I mean, there are...

1281
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,688
some nice guys too.

1282
01:18:13,815 --> 01:18:15,233
Yeah.

1283
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,365
Here you go.

1284
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,951
Thank you.

1285
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,470
I'm not gonna find
a bunch of pictures,

1286
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:27,694
of your bumhole on this, am I?

1287
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:29,747
Of my bumhole? No.

1288
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:33,918
What kind of
sleazeball do you think I am?

1289
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:36,212
I mean, the kind
that shoots a woman in the leg.

1290
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:39,340
Yeah.
Well, sorry about that.

1291
01:18:39,424 --> 01:18:42,552
Well, you know, I could
always make it up to you.

1292
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:43,719
Dinner sometime?

1293
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:47,765
Um, I'll...
I'll think about it.

1294
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:50,643
I'm an excellent cook.

1295
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:53,396
Double down on the halibut.

1296
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,731

Can I help you?

1313
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,594
I was just
checking it out, you know?

1314
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:50,429
It looks so
beat up from outside.

1315
01:20:50,513 --> 01:20:51,806
Who are you?

1316
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:55,184
It's like
a bomb went off in here.

1317
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:57,103
Yeah, I had a tricky boiler.

1318
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:00,731
But why have you come back?

1319
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:03,401
It's my apartment.

1320
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,736
Well, most people,
when their lives blow up,

1321
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,029
would just keep on running.

1322
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,783
It is so nice
that you wanted to come home

1323
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,285
to try all over again.

1324
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,078
Sorry, do I know you?

1325
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,372
- Have you been following me?
- Yeah.

1326
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:17,790
What do you actually want?

1327
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:22,503
You are just as
spunky as Munchin described.

1328
01:21:22,587 --> 01:21:24,672
You've done well under our care.

1329
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,549
Okay, I've done
enough messing around,

1330
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,844
with psychotic therapists
and the fucking CIA,

1331
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:31,679
or whatever you are.

1332
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:34,557
I totally understand.

1333
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:38,060
You've spent years being
forced to repress your anger.

1334
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:39,645
I'm sorry about Justin.

1335
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:41,731
What he did was unsanctioned.

1336
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,983
But now...

1337
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:46,402
Now Lindy,

1338
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,738
you have seen
how powerful you can be

1339
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,448
when you embrace your rage.

1340
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,491
I'm okay as I am. Thanks.

1341
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:53,576
Really?

1342
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,370
Well, how are you?

1343
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:58,497
You're not normal.

1344
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,207
You really think you'd be happy,

1345
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:02,084
living without a purpose?

1346
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:03,711
Through our work, you'll learn

1347
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,589
to harness your rage
and target the right people.

1348
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:11,093
Humans, are the most
powerful, undetectable weapon.

1349
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:56,926
Holy shit!
