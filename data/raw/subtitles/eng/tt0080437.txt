1
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,487
- Permission to enter?
- Come.

2
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,160
Where's the rest of
the company, captain?

3
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,872
Where do you think?
Moved out with the battalion.

4
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,786
I've been waiting here for you.

5
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,249
- You took your time getting back.
- I got lost in the smoke.

6
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,963
What happened to your gun?

7
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,675
Have you ever seen a
shell-shocked horse?

8
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,142
He stomped all over me and got my
rifle, knocked it to smithereens.

9
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:43,646
Well, I suppose horses have as much right
to go crazy in this war as men have.

10
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,355
Oh.

11
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,234
What do you think?

12
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,361
What the hell is it?

13
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,993
It's a "one." First
Infantry Division.

14
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,496
The Red One. You think General
Pershing will like it?

15
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,831
- Oh, sure.
- Got the idea from a cap of a Hun I killed.

16
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,625
- When?
- Oh, about an hour ago.

17
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,386
Did he yell out anything?

18
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,720
Well, the same old kaiser stuff, you
know, "The war is over," all that junk.

19
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,094
- Finish it.
- Sir?

20
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,637
Finish it.

21
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,818
The armistice was signed
at 11:00 this morning.

22
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,071
The war's been over for four hours.

23
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,531
Well, you didn't know it was over.

24
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,532
He did.

25
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,538
A quarter of a century later,
that piece of red cloth...

26
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,129
from the dead Hun's hat had
become famous all over the world.

27
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,261
It was the insignia of the
1st Infantry Division.

28
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,719
The Fighting First,
the Big Red One.

29
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,030
Twenty-four years later, the Big Red
One was fighting the Krauts again.

30
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:22,369
It was World War II this time.
We were invading North Africa.

31
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,742
Hey, Griff.

32
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,286
Great! Thanks, sergeant.

33
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,580
We were his rifle squad.

34
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,967
First Squad, 1st Platoon,
I Company, 16th Infantry.

35
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,628
He called us his wet-noses.

36
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,390
Griff, he was a hell
of a sharpshooter.

37
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,598
Johnson was a pig farmer
with hemorrhoids.

38
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:54,780
Vinci was a street kid who played hot jazz
on the saxophone, and that's me, Zab.

39
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,441
I thought I was the
Hemingway of the Bronx.

40
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,277
You really a book writer?

41
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,121
- Yeah.
- What book did you write?

42
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,248
The Dark Deadline.

43
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,285
- Never heard of it.
- Never read it.

44
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,752
It's an unpublished mystery novel.
I left it with my mother.

45
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,425
Why's a book writer a rifleman?

46
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,930
To come out with a war novel,
meathead. Why else, huh?

47
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,091
What about you, Griff?
You gonna be a cartoonist...

48
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,386
- ...for a big newspaper or something?
- Mm-hm.

49
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,021
Say, Griff. You do
everything left-handed?

50
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,228
Everything but shoot.
And play with my pecker.

51
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,152
"Watch out, Vichy.

52
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:44,280
Here comes the Big Red One."

53
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,118
Vichy?

54
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,747
I always thought Vichy was
some kind of soda pop.

55
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,754
No. Vichy's the French,
fighting on Hitler's side.

56
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:57,718
Yeah, that's why we're wearing these
so they don't shoot Americans, huh?

57
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,425
We dropped leaflets so
they know we're coming.

58
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,386
But if they start a fight,
we'll have to kill them.

59
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,722
We were in this war to fight
Germans, not Frenchmen.

60
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,436
We were kind of hoping they
were feeling the same way.

61
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,570
Put your rubbers on and
keep the salt water out.

62
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:17,775
Thanks, Griff.

63
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,533
I'll bet the guy that
invented these...

64
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,697
- ...never figured they'd be used on a rifle.
- I never could screw with them.

65
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,161
- How about you, Johnson?
- Not me.

66
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:39,001
Over on the Algerian beach, French
soldiers were reading our leaflets...

67
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,046
and also wondering if
they were gonna fight.

68
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,265
The colonel is stupid not
to believe these leaflets.

69
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,520
We are no good. You,
me, all of us here.

70
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:02,442
Defending this miserable Algerian beach
for Marshal PÃ©tain and Adolf Hitler.

71
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,035
I can't kill an American.

72
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,094
There were four things you
could hear on the boat:

73
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,132
The waves, the engines...

74
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,050
an occasional muffled prayer...

75
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,438
and the sound of 50 guys all
heaving their guts out.

76
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,953
French troops, don't shoot.
We are Americans.

77
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:59,081
Don't shoot. We come to fight Hitler,
not to fight with you. Don't shoot.

78
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,642
Hold your fire!

79
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,181
- Yes, colonel.
- Open fire.

80
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,979
Not on Americans.

81
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,236
Medic! Medic!

82
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,042
Nail him, Griff!

83
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,470
How the hell could you miss him?

84
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,226
Hell, he was close enough
to kiss on both cheeks.

85
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,650
What the hell's the matter with you?
I never saw you miss.

86
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,156
Medic! Over here.

87
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,847
Sixteenth Infantry, hold your fire!

88
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,430
Americans, this is Captain Chapter.

89
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,387
General Tavernier is dead.

90
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:23,233
Americans! I surrender
my troops to your hands.

91
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,358
Frenchmen, we do not
accept your surrender.

92
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,568
You surrender only to the enemy.

93
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,861
If you're Vichy, fight us.
If you're Frenchmen, join us!

94
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,022
We were feeling cocky as hell.

95
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,774
Except Griff.

96
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,281
In the middle of the
battle, he froze.

97
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,380
It got to Griff.

98
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,463
He kept away from the rest of us.

99
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,638
Nobody wanted to use the
word "coward," not yet.

100
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,559
How come we're not pushing inland?

101
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:45,270
Red Company's carrying the ball.
Take your malaria pills.

102
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,034
I wonder what they gave you in the
other war not to get a hard-on?

103
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:02,241
The same stuff you're wolfing
down now. It has saltpeter.

104
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,512
Griff's back.

105
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,369
I can't murder anybody.

106
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,585
We don't murder, we kill.

107
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,508
It's the same thing.

108
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,543
The hell it is, Griff.

109
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,180
You don't murder
animals, you kill them.

110
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:21,779
The truth is, none of us had the
faintest idea what war was all about.

111
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,739
We hadn't met the Krauts yet.

112
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,750
Communications Center
caught an American bomb.

113
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:17,042
These wet-noses found the phonograph
and one record undamaged.

114
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,045
Look at the faces of these
puppies, Schroeder.

115
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,723
They think the Horst
Wessel song is so...

116
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:31,102
Horst Wessel was a pimp who supplied
Hitler with baby faces like you.

117
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:35,189
He was killed in a brawl,
over a whore in Berlin.

118
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:42,408
A poem by a pimp became the
hymn of Hitler's party.

119
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,694
Is that right, Schroeder?

120
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,117
Don't want to disillusion
these infants, huh?

121
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,785
You're getting soft.

122
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:58,295
Schroeder used to be tough. In Libya,
I saw him murder a German officer.

123
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,632
I didn't murder him,
Gerd, I killed him...

124
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,217
when he ran from a fight
with the British.

125
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,260
Murder. Killed.
It's the same thing.

126
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,849
We don't murder the enemy, we kill.

127
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,190
Everything is on the move.

128
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,942
Battalion is sending us
to the Kasserine Pass.

129
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,196
- We're going to choke on panzer fumes.
- Not me, Schroeder.

130
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,574
Let Rommel's panzer grenadiers
march behind those tanks.

131
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,945
But not me. I want no more.

132
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,364
I'm no damn Nazi fanatic like you.

133
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,831
Germany is through
singing for Adolf Hitler.

134
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,935
Our brilliant generals
had figured...

135
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,230
that Rommel's push would come
at a place called Speava...

136
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,271
so they massed most of the
Allied forces over there.

137
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,986
But they sent our regiment
around the back way...

138
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,072
through a shit-hole called
the Kasserine Pass.

139
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,239
Our squad was on point.
We got an eyeful, all right.

140
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:14,079
The whole damned Afrika Korps was
coming through the Kasserine Pass.

141
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,745
Rommel had caught us
with our pants down.

142
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,560
We got tanks, boys, and
infantry with them.

143
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,652
They'll be looking behind the rocks
for antitank guns, so let's go!

144
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,983
- Oh, shit.
- Let's go.

145
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,085
Sergeant, where are we gonna run to?
They'll spot us out in the open.

146
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,299
We're not running,
we're digging in.

147
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,463
Digging in?
Are you crazy, sergeant?

148
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,635
All right. Dig in and let
them roll over our heads.

149
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,665
Hey, they're going
off to the right!

150
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,327
Guess again, jerk-off.
Look over there.

151
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,829
Jeez.

152
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,621
Tanks! They're all over the place!

153
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,030
The war is over for you.

154
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,197
We won.

155
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,952
You lost.

156
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,244
You are in a temporary German
hospital in Tunis, sergeant.

157
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,665
Our doctors are very impressed
with your recovery.

158
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,916
You should be dead.

159
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,324
We'd better get out of here.

160
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,035
You heard what that orderly said.

161
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,331
This is an unmarked hospital,
and they'd just as soon blast us.

162
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,593
Anybody here from the Big Red One?

163
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,851
Sixteenth.

164
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,522
Eighteenth!

165
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,115
Where's that Big Red One man?

166
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,872
What happened at the pass?

167
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,874
You with the 16th?

168
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,414
You one of them goons?

169
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,046
I Company, 3rd Battalion.

170
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,834
What are you doing wrapped
up in that Arab bed sheet?

171
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,221
- What happened at the pass?
- We counterattacked after you jokers ran.

172
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:47,556
We took Kasserine, Gafsa,
El Guettar, Tunis.

173
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:52,895
- We ran Rommel right out of Africa.
- You mean the Big Red One took Tunis.

174
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,604
We sure as hell did.

175
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,113
This is Tunis.

176
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,972
You're right.

177
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,678
We took Tunis.

178
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,035
The old bastard just couldn't
face being left behind.

179
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,746
He heard we were shipping
out to invade Sicily.

180
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,795
Where's the 1st Squad?

181
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,714
Where's the 1st Squad?

182
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,526
Out of the original
12-man rifle squad...

183
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,691
the four of us were
the only ones left.

184
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,462
This invasion wasn't gonna
be like North Africa.

185
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,881
The beach would be
heavily defended.

186
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:34,894
So now at least, we could all go
to Sicily and get killed together.

187
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,025
I gave the supply
officer a Luger for it.

188
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,531
By the way, what were you
doing in that Arab bed sheet?

189
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,790
They were shanghaiing
all the combats...

190
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,453
and noncoms and training
replacements for those rebel devils.

191
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,628
Where'd you steal it, stupe?

192
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:10,797
My name's Shep, not "stupe." I got it
from the St. George Hotel in Algiers.

193
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,634
I understand you're
an Italian, Vinci.

194
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,553
How come they let a wop
in this man's Army?

195
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,849
I don't think a wop's
gonna fight a wop.

196
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:27,146
I think all you'll do is drink dago
red and sing "O Sole Mio."

197
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,375
I like "O Sole Mio."

198
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:48,018
The creepy thing about battle
is that you always feel alone.

199
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,734
All you can see are the
guys right next to you...

200
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,069
and the bodies you
keep tripping over.

201
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,684
Why are we always sent out?

202
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,061
It's the only damn squad
in the whole U.S. Army?

203
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,474
- Where's the rest of the Army?
- There are eight patrols...

204
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,143
checking the villages
for diehard snipers.

205
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,191
Anybody wants to transfer,
just let me know.

206
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,070
I want to transfer.

207
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,076
Okay, Vinci. You're
transferred to the point.

208
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,547
You know how you
smoke out a sniper?

209
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,260
You send a guy out in the open
and you see if he gets shot.

210
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,471
They thought that one
up at West Point.

211
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,857
- Are you okay, sergeant?
- Why?

212
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:13,567
- You just let Vinci walk into a sniper.
- That's why he's here.

213
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,733
We got plenty of
wet-noses here too.

214
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,777
You really want to finish
that book, don't you?

215
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,661
That's why I'm here.

216
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,348
Vinci made it.

217
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,806
Come on, Carlos, your turn.
Let's go. Come on!

218
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,667
- Hey, Vinci?
- Ho!

219
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,247
You know where he lives!

220
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,420
Work to your right,
I'll go left. It's your ball.

221
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,185
Bravo! Bravo!

222
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,065
- You had him in the sights all the time.
- All the time.

223
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,321
You just wanted to see me sweat.

224
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:24,485
It's punishment for transferring me to the
point. May I rejoin the rear echelon now?

225
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:28,201
You are transferred
back to the point.

226
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,670
Oh, my aching butt.

227
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,332
By now, we'd come to look
at all replacements...

228
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,968
as dead men who temporarily had
the use of their arms and legs.

229
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,471
They came and went so
fast and so regular...

230
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,849
that sometimes we didn't even
get to know their names.

231
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:52,764
Truth is, after a while we sort
of avoided getting to know them.

232
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,777
I... I brought some water.

233
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,289
Do you know what they call you
four guys down at Battalion?

234
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,951
Sergeant's Four Horsemen.

235
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,042
I don't get it. You guys
lived through North Africa.

236
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,715
You didn't even get a scratch.

237
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:24,674
That's because replacements
keep getting hit instead of us.

238
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,056
You think...? You think
maybe I'll get it?

239
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,563
Why not? You something special?

240
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,755
I'll go get some, all right?

241
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:08,218
I'll... Excuse me.

242
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,725
Water.

243
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:39,962
You'll live, Smitty. You
did tripwire the mine.

244
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,757
They're not designed to kill
you, just to castrate you.

245
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,466
Castrate me?!

246
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,886
Hey, here it is. I found it.

247
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,011
- Oh, my God!
- It's just one of your balls, Smitty.

248
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,764
You can live without it.
That's why they gave you two.

249
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,944
They're supposed to
be coming this way.

250
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,530
Hold it up.

251
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,121
I said, hold it up!

252
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,533
I'm eating.

253
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,712
Okay, let's try this.

254
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,669
Come on.

255
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,439
- Keep an eye peeled for snakes.
- Yeah, and bats.

256
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,316
Bats? I love bats.

257
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,597
Sergeant, what's the
word from Headquarters?

258
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,929
Yeah, what did the lieutenant say?

259
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:22,849
The lieutenant said that Hermann Goring's
panzers overran the 2nd Battalion.

260
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,528
If they break through
the division...

261
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,697
we're in the sea.

262
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,062
- Where are they headed?
- Right for us.

263
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,409
Our big guns will clobber them.

264
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,955
- They're still on the water.
- None of them have unloaded yet?

265
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,742
Not yet.

266
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,542
Patton's got tanks.

267
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,924
Still on the water.

268
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,804
Jesus. We're sitting
in our own coffin.

269
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,597
We knew he wanted to run for it...

270
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,648
but we knew he wouldn't...

271
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,480
way before he did.

272
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,488
Anyway, the sergeant would've
shot him if he tried it.

273
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,812
He's taking a piss.

274
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,787
Those American guns? I thought
they were still on the water.

275
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,039
It beats the hell out of me.

276
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,756
- Relays! Relays!
- Come on, relays!

277
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,351
Radio!

278
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,452
Lieutenant. Yeah, 1st
Squad, 1st Battalion.

279
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,501
You're kidding.

280
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,580
Yes, sir!

281
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,292
You know who fired that artillery?

282
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,004
The United States Navy.

283
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,925
That was the crews of Savannah
miles offshore, all right?

284
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:55,973
Right. Can you believe that?
The U.S. Navy saved our ass.

285
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,074
Hey, where's our planes?
Why can't they spot that gun?

286
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:15,584
I don't know, but Battalion's got 20 patrols
out looking for it in this quadrant.

287
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,291
- They think it's an SP.
- So why send us?

288
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,455
That's right. We got
a break coming.

289
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,091
The Army's made of the 1st Division
and 10 million replacements.

290
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,424
- Where the hell are they?
- Being stuffed with mattress covers.

291
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:31,763
Five to 10, when we get off this island,
we'll get our feet wet invading Italy.

292
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,144
You don't know geography well
for a writer. We're in Italy.

293
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:39,729
No, this is Sicily. Here they say,
"I'm a Sicilian," not an Italian.

294
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,814
My old man was bo... Whoa!

295
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:15,222
I figure close to 2500 bucks!
I'm sending every lira home.

296
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,271
Mussolini money's
good for one thing.

297
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,852
It's Victor Emanuel loot.
It's kosher.

298
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,313
- Who told you that?
- The captain.

299
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,941
Enlisted man can't send
home more than his pay.

300
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,483
- That's to discourage black marketing.
- But the lieutenant can.

301
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:30,901
It's for my old man.

302
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,819
Always wanted his own bagel shop.

303
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,864
- I didn't know bagels were Italian.
- Sure they are.

304
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,533
The pope eats gefilte
fish on Friday, don't he?

305
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,317
It's his mother. He's
hauling her to the beach.

306
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,230
- Tell him We'll bury her.
- I did.

307
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,898
He'll put her next to his father.

308
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,489
She's decomposing already.
The sun's blowing her up.

309
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,450
We've gotta find that SP.

310
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,790
Ask if he knows where the gun is.

311
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,631
- Hell, he doesn't know what an SP is.
- You Knucklehead.

312
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,296
Tell him it's a self-propelled
gun with wheels.

313
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,433
He knows where it is.

314
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,612
The smart aleck wants to
make a business deal.

315
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,496
Shell out some bagel money.

316
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,838
He'll take us to the gun...

317
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:18,508
we get an ambulance to take
her to the cemetery in Gela.

318
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:27,100
He wants a casket for
his mother to sleep in.

319
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,352
And it's gotta have four handles.

320
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,074
All right, he'll get it.

321
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:39,579
Tell him we'll leave her in the wagon in
the shade if he leads us to that gun.

322
00:45:56,963 --> 00:46:00,137
Either we take her with us or
we find that gun on our own.

323
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,810
Boy! I don't know how long I'm
gonna be able to take this stink.

324
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:14,197
Can it, Johnson, will you? Talking
about it only makes it worse.

325
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,405
Hey, sergeant.

326
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:21,161
Think this kid is leading
us into a bushwhack?

327
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,199
Well, we're getting closer
to some kind of gun.

328
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,606
Can you see what it is, sergeant?

329
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,776
Yeah, it's an 88 all right.

330
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,492
On a Tiger tank, in a house.

331
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,958
They got women working
in front of her...

332
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,957
under a Schmeisser.

333
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:19,425
Yeah, makes a nice, peaceful
picture from the air.

334
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,473
What's-your-name, you stay behind.

335
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,388
When you hear us fire, you
take out the Schmeisser.

336
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:30,779
Those Sicilian women
cooked us a terrific meal.

337
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,829
Too bad they were all over 50.

338
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,582
We were more horny
than we were hungry.

339
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,189
A little mothering is good in any
war, but this beats them all.

340
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,945
There's not a man in
the whole village.

341
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,743
- Hey, Vinci.
- Ho.

342
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,076
Tell Matteo the meat wagon
is on its way for his mother.

343
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:21,042
Oh, and that the general is sending up a
casket, silk-lined, with six handles on it.

344
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,086
Matteo! Matteo!

345
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,524
All right, Matteo,
it's okay. Thank you.

346
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:56,039
I told you, kid, a deal's a deal, right?
That's all right. That's okay.

347
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,450
No, no, no. I'm mucho gordo,
huh? That's okay.

348
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,291
Thanks a lot. You're
okay, Matteo, any time.

349
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:10,011
It was the first time in ages
that we had all felt really good.

350
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,422
It lasted about an hour.

351
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,803
Then we got our orders to move out.

352
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,443
Where's my helmet?

353
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,122
The Krauts are gonna spot
that garden a mile away.

354
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,966
I like the smell.

355
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,765
North Africa was sand and rocks.

356
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,437
Sicily was rocks and sand.

357
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,815
England was green.

358
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,114
We hung around England for seven
months getting ready for D-Day.

359
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,569
Give me back my doughnut.

360
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:16,194
Then one day, we were
in the boats again.

361
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,798
How about it, Johnson?

362
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,211
- Who are you?
- I'm Lemchek.

363
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:36,551
Lemchek, remember? We been on
dry runs for this invasion...

364
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,388
for seven months in
England. I'm Lemchek.

365
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,518
How about what?

366
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,599
Will you swap with me?

367
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,316
Nope. Eleven is my lucky number.

368
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,522
Try Vinci, he might do it.

369
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,028
- Do what?
- Hey, listen.

370
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,439
Swap numbers in the
Bangalore Relay with me.

371
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,448
My number two for your number 10.

372
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,076
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.

373
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,910
Ten thousand dollars! Where the
hell are you gonna get $10,000?

374
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:05,372
It's from my GI insurance.
I'll make you my beneficiary.

375
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:08,037
- Can you do that?
- Hey, I could put Eisenhower down...

376
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,672
for my beneficiary. I can
put down anybody I want.

377
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,835
Oh, Lumnuts, I am really shocked.

378
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,005
You know, you told me your
mother was your beneficiary.

379
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,549
What's the matter? Don't
you love your mother?

380
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,968
- I love my mother.
- Sure. I love my mother.

381
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,062
Sure, sure, I love my mother.

382
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,473
But she ain't number
10 on the relay.

383
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,108
Swap with him. He gets
hit, you get 10 grand.

384
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:34,864
- What if I get hit using number two?
- Ten thousand will buy a lot of bagels.

385
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:39,277
No, I like my number 10,
like Griff likes number eight.

386
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:42,367
Zab, nine. Johnson, 11.
The sergeant, 12.

387
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,037
It's bad luck to change numbers.

388
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,919
Don't worry, Lemchek,
you'll make it. You know why?

389
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,954
Only be dead Germans on that beach.

390
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,498
- Yeah.
- That's right.

391
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,168
- You sure? I mean, are you really sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.

392
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:59,088
You don't think I wanna
blow $10,000, do you?

393
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,006
He don't wanna blow 10,000.

394
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,510
Relax, Lemchek. You heard
what the captain said.

395
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:08,271
It's a couple of schnell battalions,
combat rejects defending the beach...

396
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,307
at Colleville-sur-Mer.

397
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,051
First Squad!

398
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,713
First Squad, over here.

399
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,489
Son of a bitch.

400
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:22,054
This beach hasn't been touched.

401
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,342
Either our shells and bombs fell too
far inland or in the English Channel.

402
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,569
Vinci!

403
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,818
It's Lemchek.

404
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,325
You just blew 10,000 bucks.

405
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,951
Hey, throw me his helmet.

406
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,096
Second Squad!

407
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:39,503
Those combat rejects sure
know how to lay down fire.

408
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:43,044
Those aren't rejects up there.
That's infantry.

409
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,435
We couldn't move forward,
we couldn't move back.

410
00:57:56,014 --> 00:58:00,440
Exit E-1 was blocked by a
huge barbed-wire tank trap.

411
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:04,903
Our Navy was supposed to shell it,
our planes were supposed to bomb it...

412
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:08,444
our bazooka teams were
supposed to blow it up.

413
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:12,949
If all else failed, we were the
last resort: the Bangalore Relay.

414
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,958
First Squad! First Squad!

415
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,334
Bangalore teams two and
three knocked out!

416
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:22,041
- What about our bazooka team?
- Dead.

417
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,261
- Bazooka team?!
- Killed.

418
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,932
- Break them out!
- Naturally, all else failed.

419
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:35,597
The Bangalore torpedo was 50 feet long
and packed with 85 pounds of TNT...

420
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,016
and you assembled it
along the way, by hand.

421
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,651
I'd love to meet the
asshole who invented it.

422
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,407
Ready!

423
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,154
Number one.

424
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,916
- Number two.
- Dead!

425
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,922
Number three.

426
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,065
Number four.

427
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,327
Number five.

428
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,545
Six.

429
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,409
- Number seven.
- Dead!

430
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,244
Number eight.

431
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,119
Number eight.

432
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:30,010
You'd better make it, Griff, you son of
a bitch, because my number's up next!

433
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,264
Nine!

434
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,685
Hang on.

435
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,699
Come on.

436
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,548
Zab, tell the colonel.

437
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:16,506
Tell the colonel his
Exit E-1 is open.

438
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:49,827
Hey! Layton, 2nd Division, right?

439
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:53,255
Denham, 29th. Get some
coffees, boys, doughnuts.

440
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,253
We'll chew the fat later.

441
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,639
Hey, come on. Throw the ball.

442
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,321
Just another buzz bomb
headed for London.

443
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:25,237
- Buzz bomb?
- Yeah, V-1 rocket.

444
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,181
How do you like the book?

445
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,393
- Damn good.
- Hey.

446
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,237
My mother sent it to
me for my birthday.

447
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,153
I'm Zab.

448
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:06,786
- Welcome to the 1st Squad.
- I'm Kaiser.

449
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,371
Nice to meet you, Kaiser.

450
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,211
That's my book.

451
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,380
- Your book?
- Yeah.

452
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:30,053
What do you mean, your book? I got
this from the Repple-Depple in St-Lo.

453
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,064
I wrote it, baby face.

454
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,023
And I printed it.

455
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,100
You, I don't want any
infantry around the panzer.

456
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:22,025
Put that dead panzer gunner
hanging halfway out the hatch.

457
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:36,417
Second radio man, here,
behind that man.

458
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,130
Put yourself in a good position.

459
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:14,323
As we slogged through the
hedgerows and across France...

460
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,959
the sergeant began keeping to
himself. It was a little spooky.

461
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:21,087
He told Vinci he fought
around here in the first war.

462
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:23,878
He kept ahead as if looking
for some old ghost...

463
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,168
to rise up out of the mist.

464
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,762
Kaiser, your turn at bat.

465
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,784
Would you look how fast
they put up the names...

466
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,790
of all our guys who got killed.

467
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,870
That's a World War I memorial.

468
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:04,706
But the names are the same.

469
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,874
They always are.

470
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,885
Enemy scout advancing.

471
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,968
Give him a round-trip ticket.

472
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:21,557
I don't want any of you to
be where I didn't plant you.

473
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,108
No fingers on triggers.

474
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:28,067
One shot in panic and
we've lost what I want:

475
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,231
A platoon of dead Americans.

476
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:31,900
Don't twitch any muscle.

477
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,364
Look dead or you will be dead.

478
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,822
Give him a round-trip ticket.

479
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,271
Nothing but a bunch
of dead Germans.

480
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,611
- No dead dogfaces?
- None.

481
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:58,028
Let's go.

482
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:01,702
Enemy scout returning with patrol.

483
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,515
These dead guys give me the creeps.

484
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:29,685
Shit, Kaiser, something's
always giving you the creeps.

485
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,604
How come there aren't any dead GIs?

486
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,693
Shut up. Keep your eyes open.

487
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:45,871
Just like I said, sergeant,
just three dead Germans.

488
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,327
But the sergeant wasn't satisfied.

489
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:51,548
He'd noticed something about the
piping on their collar patches.

490
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,958
They were different colors.

491
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,233
- What color is that piping?
- White.

492
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,608
White's infantry.

493
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,081
Radio.

494
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,170
Get me the lieutenant.

495
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,764
- Lieutenant? Lieutenant.
- Yeah, go ahead.

496
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:45,177
- Yeah, this is Sergeant Possum.
- Possum, right. Where are you?

497
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:48,308
We're at point 33,
Christ on the Cross.

498
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,015
You're in an ambush, huh?

499
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:53,560
Nothing here. Just a bunch of dead
Krauts and a knocked-out tank.

500
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:58,110
All right, sir, we'll wait for you.

501
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:01,116
Wish we could help, sergeant,
but you're on your own.

502
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,494
- What's that?
- Good luck. Over and out.

503
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,121
What?

504
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,540
Yes, sir.

505
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:13,496
Well, I'll be damned.
To hell with all officers.

506
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:17,629
He's afraid the platoon's gonna
get lost coming up here...

507
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:21,763
so we gotta go back and handhold
them all the way right here.

508
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,549
Well, I'll be a son of a gun.

509
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,217
Let's go.

510
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:33,809
Don't panic. Live
people are watching us.

511
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,648
It's a bushwhack.

512
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,341
I'm hit!

513
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,574
Check for wounded Krauts.

514
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:13,328
You're pretty good at that, Johnson,
you should have been in the Medics.

515
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,876
Yeah, I was one...

516
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:18,083
in Indiantown Gap.

517
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,668
- Where?
- Back in Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania.

518
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,878
Never heard of it.

519
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,604
Is he dead?

520
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:46,487
Johnson, you ever notice how no one
talks about home anymore, or women?

521
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,651
Yeah, I noticed.

522
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,750
On the double, boys.
There's a woman in there.

523
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,767
- Is she wounded?
- Easy.

524
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,837
Wounded, hell, she's pregnant.

525
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,094
Christ, she looks like
she's about to pop.

526
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:07,970
That's what the man said.

527
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,633
Jesus, sergeant, what
are we gonna do?

528
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,057
Get the dead Krauts out of
the tank and get her in it.

529
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,313
Johnson, you're gonna
deliver a baby.

530
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,815
- What baby?
- Her baby.

531
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:23,069
Her husband said she's got labor
pains five minutes apart.

532
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:26,822
- Why me?
- You're qualified. Let's go.

533
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,292
Hey. Her legs gotta
be propped up higher.

534
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,678
- Higher?
- Higher! And spread them apart.

535
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:50,930
Wide apart. Give me
some room, okay?

536
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,555
Face the bullets the other
way, away from her.

537
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,356
Relax, would you?

538
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,068
Okay.

539
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,480
Okay. Go to work.

540
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,490
- We need some hot water.
- What are you talking about?

541
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,072
- No time for hot water.
- Some rubber gloves.

542
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,613
Hey, Griff, break out the condoms.

543
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,496
I need a mask. I can't
get germs on the baby.

544
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:23,379
- There's more germs in this tank than...
- No mask, no baby.

545
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,925
That's fine. That's fine.

546
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,640
Give me a diaper pin.

547
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,890
Oh, the rubbers, the rubbers.

548
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:45,151
Easy, easy...

549
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,783
That's the United
States Army for you.

550
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:55,904
- Take it easy, would you?
- Put them together.

551
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:00,291
Hey, look. Lady...

552
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:03,495
I'm a hell of a lot more
scared than you are, okay?

553
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,914
Just take it easy.

554
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:08,291
Get her hands away.

555
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,296
Okay?

556
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,965
Hey, Johnson, your dog tags.

557
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,138
Come on.

558
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,108
I don't see the head yet.

559
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:28,645
You're never gonna see
it if she don't push.

560
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,064
- She gotta push, I think.
- What do you mean?

561
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,824
- I think she's gotta push.
- You don't know?

562
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:36,031
- I know. She's gotta push.
- You're sure?

563
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,695
- I'm sure.
- You're sure?

564
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,114
- Yeah.
- Then do it.

565
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,453
Come on, damn it, push.

566
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:42,992
Push...

567
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:47,585
It's no use. She ain't gonna push.
We might as well write this kid off.

568
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,215
- Can't you push for her?
- No, she's gotta...

569
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:53,844
Look, how do you say
"push" in French?

570
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,689
Hey, Johnson, look. You get the
head, I'll do the poussez-ing.

571
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,100
All right.

572
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,736
Easy, lady. Hey, we all love you.

573
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:23,411
Hey, hey. I can see it.
I can see his head.

574
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,082
That's it. That's it.

575
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:31,169
Don't stop, lady.
Come on. Don't stop.

576
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,917
Keep it up. You're
doing great. Push.

577
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,718
Push. Push.

578
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:39,511
He's coming out. Great.
He's out! He's out!

579
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:42,517
It's a boy. A boy!

580
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,520
Look at that.

581
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,155
We got a bunch of medals...

582
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:59,535
not for delivering the kid,
just for killing Krauts.

583
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:08,126
The whole German army was on the run now.
We were right on their heels.

584
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:50,374
In September, we slipped across
the Meuse River into Belgium...

585
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,709
ahead of the main American push.

586
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,900
The regiment figures there's a
railway gun chopping them up.

587
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:23,444
Forward observers in a
monastery right here.

588
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,614
- Why don't we shell it?
- Throw a couple of bombs on it.

589
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,624
There's an underground
fighter living in there.

590
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:32,787
It's a woman, she's a killer.
Her name is Walloon.

591
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,580
She has a squad plan...

592
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:38,422
to wipe out the Krauts without firing
a shot or killing one civilian.

593
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,302
A woman in a monastery?

594
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:44,637
It's really not a monastery. It's an
asylum for retards and insane people.

595
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,510
I say division should bomb it.

596
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,805
Killing insane people is not
good for public relations.

597
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,107
Killing sane people is okay?

598
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,144
That's right.

599
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:58,858
Let's go.

600
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,978
The Americans are coming

601
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:24,156
The Americans are coming

602
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,376
Two men in the tower.

603
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:17,974
Squad. Come on.

604
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,100
Bayonets.

605
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,603
Bayonets.

606
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,492
Beautiful...

607
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:45,816
I am one of you.
I am sane. I am sane!

608
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:52,652
For a minute there before I dropped him,
I remembered thinking he might be right.

609
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:57,490
Now, when you're in a situation where
you can't tell crazy from sane...

610
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:01,783
that's pretty confusing for a soldier, but
it's good stuff for an aspiring novelist.

611
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:04,292
I mean, at least that's
what I kept telling myself.

612
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:22,511
I'll be a son of a bitch.

613
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,682
My mother sold my
novel to Hollywood.

614
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:29,184
For Humphrey Bogart and
Edward G. Robinson.

615
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:33,197
Hey, hey. For how much?

616
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:34,948
For 15,000 bucks.

617
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:39,654
We got another Rockefeller
in the company here.

618
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,323
So, what you gonna do
with all the moola?

619
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:47,498
Well, first, I think I'm gonna
blow 1000 bucks on a squad party.

620
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:51,757
Only you guys gotta think of the damned
things you wanted to do to a girl.

621
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:56,048
Hey, Griff.

622
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,380
I'm working on it.

623
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:00,925
- Vinci?
- Hey...

624
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,557
Come on.

625
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,936
- I'll tell you in a minute.
- Hey, Johnson.

626
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:12,565
I think I'd like the
most beautiful...

627
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,230
I know what I want.

628
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,694
Who the hell are you?

629
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:20,907
Kaiser. You patched me up
behind that tank in France.

630
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:24,198
- What tank?
- I was the one that liked your book, Zab.

631
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:28,039
Yeah, baby face. Yeah, so, what do
you want? What do you wanna do?

632
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,704
I want a big, zaftig girl...

633
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:35,213
stick her plump butt against
an ice-cold window...

634
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:36,672
Yeah?

635
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,674
And just hold it there.

636
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:41,969
What are you gonna do
with a frozen butt?

637
01:27:42,132 --> 01:27:43,554
Thaw it out.

638
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,892
It may take a while.

639
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:05,447
Three bursts. Making millions
of splinters, lieutenant.

640
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:08,458
- They spot your position?
- They're not aiming at us.

641
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,335
They're just hitting the trees.

642
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,413
They've got us pinned down.
Take them out for us.

643
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:17,130
- But watch out, they've got snipers too.
- Yeah.

644
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,976
Let's go.

645
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:22,323
Watch yourself, they still
got snipers out there.

646
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:46,590
I can't see a goddamned thing.

647
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:31,893
- Griff.
- Ho!

648
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,565
- Zab.
- Ho.

649
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,519
- Vinci.
- Ho.

650
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:44,565
- Johnson.
- Ho!

651
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:48,076
Kaiser.

652
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:52,539
Kaiser?

653
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,290
I'm hit.

654
01:30:58,078 --> 01:30:59,830
Where are you?

655
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:02,799
Find me...

656
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:48,761
Did I kill that guy...

657
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:51,180
that killed me?

658
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:54,217
Yes.

659
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,204
We thought we'd push through...

660
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,661
but the Krauts regrouped
and counterattacked...

661
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:20,452
and bumped us back into France.

662
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:23,751
Lieutenant, we got tanks and
infantry coming at us...

663
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:26,166
at point 33. Three-three.

664
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:51,650
We spent the whole winter freezing our
asses off just to take back Belgium.

665
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:04,914
Kaiser, I'm beginning to see
what you like about big butts!

666
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:12,592
Sergeant, can you come here so we
can, uh, talk about it, you know?

667
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:15,515
I'm gonna like winning
this Purple Heart.

668
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:23,311
He was that close, that's where he
was. Easy target. Easy target.

669
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,228
So he asked me why
I didn't get him.

670
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:33,317
Everything's gonna be
okay. I guarantee it.

671
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:41,825
Okay, Zab, you know it's
time to take the hill.

672
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:47,213
- Take the hill.
- Wait a second. Excuse me, my dear.

673
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:50,751
Would you help the young
lady down, please, sergeant?

674
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:55,882
Okay, now let's see.

675
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,890
I...

676
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,392
I paid for this party...

677
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:04,478
so the hill will be took
when I say it's to be took.

678
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,688
- I beg your pardon.
- Well, okay, sir.

679
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:10,104
- Now, move.
- Yes, sir.

680
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:16,736
Come on, let's get on with it. Don't
forget your pieces. Let's go.

681
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:21,824
Keep your front sight covers on,
or else you'll get a rusty bore.

682
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:24,084
Let's go. Move it.

683
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,040
Come on. Come on.

684
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:40,133
Come on.

685
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,890
The party was kind of a
last big blowout for us.

686
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:24,645
The war was almost over and we were sure
we'd be sent back to the rear pretty soon.

687
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:27,146
As usual, we were wrong.

688
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:34,981
The sergeant hadn't told us yet, but we
were being sent to a place called Falkenau.

689
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:38,320
He knew what that meant. We didn't.

690
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:51,905
I think you got him.

691
01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:02,654
Jew?

692
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:05,994
Polish.

693
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:48,033
Czech?

694
01:44:49,241 --> 01:44:50,834
Russian?

695
01:48:43,517 --> 01:48:45,394
He walked around
for half an hour...

696
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:48,064
before he could bring himself
to put the kid down.

697
01:48:56,655 --> 01:48:58,828
That night, he buried
him in the woods.

698
01:49:29,021 --> 01:49:30,819
Sergeant!

699
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:32,525
Sergeant!

700
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:36,161
- Sergeant!
- Sergeant?

701
01:49:40,532 --> 01:49:42,284
Over here.

702
01:49:44,661 --> 01:49:46,629
Where the hell have you been?

703
01:49:48,373 --> 01:49:50,341
I'm not gonna tell you again.

704
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:53,004
- No lights at night.
- Sergeant, the war's over.

705
01:49:54,213 --> 01:49:57,012
Look, nobody's firing at us.

706
01:49:58,092 --> 01:50:00,891
One minute after
midnight, official.

707
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,020
The war's been over for four hours.

708
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:08,732
Hey, sarge, the dead
Kraut, he's still warm.

709
01:50:16,193 --> 01:50:19,413
- You didn't know it was over.
- He did.

710
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:29,506
He's still alive!

711
01:50:39,883 --> 01:50:41,100
Sulfa.

712
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,978
Come on.

713
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:50,395
- Pills?
- Right here.

714
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,671
Live, you son of a bitch.

715
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:11,924
You're gonna live if I have
to blow your brains out.

716
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:36,108
Saving that Kraut was the final
joke of the whole goddamned war.

717
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:38,025
We had more in common with him...

718
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:42,163
than with all our replacements who got
killed whose names we never knew.

719
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:45,245
We'd all made it through.
We were alive.

720
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:49,586
I'm gonna dedicate my book to those
who shot but didn't get shot...

721
01:51:49,745 --> 01:51:51,964
because it's about survivors.

722
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:56,127
And surviving is the only glory
in war, if you know what I mean.
