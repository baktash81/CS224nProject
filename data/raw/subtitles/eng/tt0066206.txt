00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:45,758
...and come up with the appropriate
badge of rank.

177
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:50,806
Anyway, congratulations.
Premature congratulations.

178
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:53,522
You know...

179
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:57,976
I think those stars look better
on a green shirt.

180
00:21:58,237 --> 00:22:02,898
Did I ever tell you about the time I
designed a uniform for tank crewmen?

181
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,152
It was green leather,
it had red stripes...

182
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:12,198
...and sort of a row of brass buttons
down across here.

183
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,413
And topped off
by a gold football helmet.

184
00:22:16,338 --> 00:22:18,959
The Army rejected it, of course.

185
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:20,544
Goddamn, it was beautiful.

186
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,879
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

187
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:24,377
Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving.

188
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:03,586
George, there's one other thing I put
in my Kasserine report.

189
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,755
Some of our boys
were just plain scared.

190
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,636
That's understandable.

191
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,640
Even the best foxhound is gun-shy
the first time out.

192
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,599
I can remember...

193
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,388
...when nothing frightened me
as much as the idea of...

194
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,105
...a bullet coming
straight for my nose.

195
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:23,437
I don't know why, but the image of a
bullet coming right for my nose...

196
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,984
...was more horrible
than any other possibility.

197
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,648
Well, I can understand that,
with such a handsome nose.

198
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,864
You want to know why this outfit
got the hell kicked out of it?

199
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,157
Blind man could see it in a minute.

200
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,334
They don't look like soldiers.
They don't act like soldiers.

201
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,163
Why should they fight like soldiers?

202
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,706
You're absolutely right.
The discipline's pretty poor.

203
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,718
ln about 15 minutes we're going
to start turning these boys...

204
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,591
...into fanatics, razors.

205
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,297
They'll lose their fear
of the Germans.

206
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,846
I hope to God they never lose
their fear of me.

207
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:22,209
Up bright and early, general?
Breakfast?

208
00:24:22,418 --> 00:24:24,541
Have all my officers
finished breakfast?

209
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,835
We're open from 6 till 8.

210
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:29,544
Most of the officers are
just coming in, sir.

211
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:32,255
Please inform these officers
the mess hall is closed.

212
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:35,253
But, sir! It's only a quarter to 8.

213
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:40,177
From now on, you will open at 6
and no one will be admitted after 6: 15.

214
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:41,846
Where are your leggings?

215
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:45,852
Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir,
I'm a cook.

216
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,103
You're a soldier.

217
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:51,101
$20 fine.

218
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:57,450
Gentlemen...

219
00:24:58,285 --> 00:25:00,362
...from this moment any man...

220
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,700
...without leggings, without a helmet,
without a tie...

221
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:07,785
Any man with unshined shoes
or soiled uniform...

222
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:11,672
...is going to be skinned.

223
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,626
This is a barracks.
It's not a bordello.

224
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,155
(CHATTERING)

225
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:25,532
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

226
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:27,402
Doctor.

227
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:28,695
Sir.

228
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:33,168
I understand you have two cases
of self-inflicted wounds.

229
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,747
Yes, sir, we do.

230
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:36,498
Get them out of here.

231
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:39,129
One has developed a serious infection.

232
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:42,551
I don't care if he dies,
just get him out of here.

233
00:26:42,804 --> 00:26:46,172
Doesn't belong in the same room
with men wounded in battle.

234
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:49,308
- I'll see that they're moved.
- One more thing.

235
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:52,847
There'll be no "battle fatigue. "
That's an order.

236
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:56,392
Battle fatigue is a free ride
to the hospital.

237
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,725
I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.

238
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,148
Yes, sir.

239
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:03,696
Doctor...
Where's your helmet?

240
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:07,650
I don't wear a helmet
in the hospital.

241
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:09,782
Start.

242
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:13,039
I can't use my stethoscope
when I'm wearing my helmet.

243
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:17,032
Well...

244
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:22,039
...then cut two holes in your helmet
so that you can.

245
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,800
And get those yellow-bellies
out of here, today.

246
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:35,591
Hold it.

247
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:37,718
Turn right, here.

248
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:39,975
The battlefield is ahead.

249
00:27:40,193 --> 00:27:42,481
Don't argue.
I can smell a battlefield.

250
00:27:42,737 --> 00:27:44,361
He was out here yesterday.

251
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:47,282
It's over there. Turn right, damn it.

252
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,276
It was here.

253
00:28:34,494 --> 00:28:36,285
The battlefield was here.

254
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,375
The Carthaginians
defending the city...

255
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:51,919
...were attacked by three
Roman legions.

256
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:57,974
They were brave, but they
couldn't hold. They were massacred.

257
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,138
Arab women...

258
00:29:02,855 --> 00:29:06,723
...stripped them of their tunics
and their swords and lances.

259
00:29:08,403 --> 00:29:10,360
The soldiers lay naked in the sun...

260
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:15,692
...2000 years ago.

261
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:21,741
I was here.

262
00:29:27,003 --> 00:29:28,414
You don't believe me.

263
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:33,836
You know what the poet said:

264
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:37,378
"Through the travail of ages

265
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:42,182
It's the pomp and toils of war

266
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:47,181
Have I fought and strove and perished

267
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,311
Countless times upon the star

268
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:58,032
As if through a glass and darkly

269
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,787
The age-old strife I see

270
00:30:03,121 --> 00:30:05,956
Where I fought in many guises
Many names

271
00:30:07,668 --> 00:30:09,293
But always me. "

272
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:18,251
You know who the poet was?

273
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:22,219
Me.

274
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:34,551
There's an opportunity
for us to mount an offensive.

275
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:36,850
We've concentrated on the flank...

276
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:39,013
...draw strength from the British.

277
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:41,519
It appears now that we could...

278
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:43,642
...split the African corridor.

279
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:45,360
Drive through Rommel to the sea.

280
00:32:45,611 --> 00:32:48,649
I'm sorry, but that territory
has been reserved...

281
00:32:48,907 --> 00:32:51,150
...for General Bernard Law Montgomery.

282
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,280
We're supposed to let him win this one
no matter what.

283
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:56,993
They're entitled to have their hero.

284
00:32:57,248 --> 00:33:00,498
Montgomery did push Rommel
clear across North Africa.

285
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:03,996
What about the Americans?
Don't they need a hero too?

286
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:06,581
You have anybody in mind?

287
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:12,171
Air Vice-Marshal Coningham
is here with General Buford.

288
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,841
Excuse me, gentlemen...

289
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:19,050
...while I ask our British friends
what's happened to our air cover.

Harry.

291
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:23,310
How are you?

292
00:33:23,524 --> 00:33:25,731
George. Good to see you.

293
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:29,732
- You know Arthur Coningham.
- Sir Arthur.

294
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:31,482
Delighted to see you.

295
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:34,691
I've heard so much about you.

296
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:44,290
Gentlemen, it appears there's been a
slight misunderstanding here...

297
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:46,620
...and Ike thought we should fix it.

298
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,919
No, no. No misunderstanding.

299
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:52,009
We're supposed to have Allied
air cover and we don't.

300
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,963
German planes are strafing my troops.

301
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,384
If I may say so, general, I'm afraid
your operation reports are inaccurate.

302
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:03,261
Report? Three days ago, the crowds
took off after my command car...

303
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,223
...ran my ass into a ditch.

304
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,605
My staff has assured me,
we have complete air supremacy...

305
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:10,567
...everywhere in the Mediterranean.

PATTON:
When I complained about air cover...

307
00:34:13,114 --> 00:34:15,901
...you said our troops
were not battleworthy.

308
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:20,985
You spoke of the discredited practice
of using air force as an alibi...

309
00:34:21,246 --> 00:34:24,163
...for lack of success on the ground.

310
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:28,117
I have to wet-nurse Montgomery,
I don't have to stand for that.

311
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:31,996
I sincerely apologize for that remark,
whoever made it.

312
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,789
And I promise you one thing, general:

313
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:38,299
You will see no more German planes.

314
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:48,978
(CHICKEN SQUAWKS)

315
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:53,645
We were discussing air supremacy,

Damn door won't open!

By God, that's enough!

320
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,468
Get that thing out of here!

321
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,675
Come on, you bastards,
take a shot at me on the nose!

322
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:14,431
Get back in here, George! We need
a corps commander, not a casualty.

How'd you manage to stage that?

324
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:45,541
I don't know...

325
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,838
...but if I could find
the Nazis flying those things...

326
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:51,131
...I'd give them each a medal.

327
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:15,114
PATTON: Can't get over how cold
it gets in the desert.

328
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:17,623
Awfully cold, sir.

329
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:50,610

waiting for me.

Yes, sir.

PATTON:
You know...

332
00:37:56,704 --> 00:38:00,997
...if I had my way, I'd send
that genius son of a bitch...

333
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:04,958
...an engraved invitation
in iambic pentameter:

334
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:09,082
A challenge in two stanzas
to meet me alone in the desert.

335
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:11,212
I'll deliver it.

336
00:38:14,763 --> 00:38:17,468
Rommel in his tank and me in mine.

337
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,058
We'd stop about 20 paces.
We'd get out, we'd shake hands...

338
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:26,015
...then we'd button up and do battle,
just the two of us.

339
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:30,394
That battle would decide
the outcome of the war.

340
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:34,358
It's too bad jousting's
gone out of style.

341
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:37,324
It's like your poetry, general.

342
00:38:37,577 --> 00:38:40,199
It isn't part of the 20th century.

put around this area.

If we don't, the Arabs will dig
them up for their clothes.

348
00:38:58,014 --> 00:38:59,390
Yes, sir.

349
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,966
Our graves aren't gonna disappear
like everybody else's who fought here.

350
00:39:04,478 --> 00:39:08,772
The Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians.

351
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,980
God, how I hate the 20th century.

352
00:41:39,378 --> 00:41:40,623
General.

353
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:42,332
General?

354
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,081
We intercepted a German radio message.

355
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:50,175
Rommel's 10th Panzer is going
to hit us near El Guettar.

356
00:41:56,102 --> 00:41:57,894
Rommel, huh?

358
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:50,294
All my life...

359
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:55,502
...I've wanted to lead a lot of men
in a desperate battle.

360
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,265
Now I'm going to do it.

361
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,566
Look.

362
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,480
Battalion strength at least.

363
00:46:16,437 --> 00:46:18,976
They haven't spotted our positions yet.

364
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:23,018
They'll get an education
in about 10 seconds.

365
00:46:23,278 --> 00:46:26,028
Wait till they get a dose of
that artillery fire.

366
00:46:41,085 --> 00:46:43,292
Commence firing.
Fire at will.

367
00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:49,426
Commence firing. Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.

368
00:47:49,485 --> 00:47:52,105
What a hell of a waste
of fine infantry.

369
00:48:10,172 --> 00:48:12,628
- Get General Bradley on the radio.
- Yes, sir.

370
00:48:31,317 --> 00:48:33,061
Sir, I can't raise him.

371
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:36,812
Go tell him to hit them hard. Here's
where we hold them by the nose...

372
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:38,905
...and kick them in the ass.
Go on.

373
00:49:54,147 --> 00:49:55,855
Put him in my car.

was a fine boy.

378
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:28,876
Loyal, unselfish and efficient.

379
00:52:32,051 --> 00:52:34,292
I am terribly sorry.

380
00:52:43,478 --> 00:52:46,810
There are no coffins here
since there is no wood.

381
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:50,560
We will have a trumpeter
and an honor guard...

382
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:55,148
...but we will not fire the volleys as
people would think an air raid was on.

383
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:15,798
I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair
in a letter to his mother.

384
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,594
He was a fine man...

385
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:21,890
...and a fine officer.

386
00:53:22,724 --> 00:53:24,966
And he had no vices.

387
00:53:33,651 --> 00:53:35,607
I shall miss him a lot.

388
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:49,993
I can 't see the reason
such fine young men get killed.

...continues to lead his
victorious British 8th Army...

...in a relentless drive against
Rommel's vaunted Africa corps.

398

General Bradley's done
a tremendous job with 2nd Corps.

399
00:56:44,586 --> 00:56:47,871
He's moved into Bizerte
and taken over 41,000 prisoners.

400
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:49,541
Good. Very good.

401
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:54,342
You're not surprised, are you?
After all, you trained that outfit.

402
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,678
- Excuse me, general.
- Hm?

403
00:57:00,935 --> 00:57:05,596
This is interesting. We've discovered
Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar.

404
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:08,519
- Who says so?
- G2, sir.

405
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:14,151
When we took 10th Panzer,
Rommel was in Berlin with an earache?

406
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:16,522
Severe nasal diphtheria, sir.

407
00:57:16,783 --> 00:57:19,487
Also, Hitler probably
retained Rommel in Berlin...

408
00:57:19,744 --> 00:57:22,069
...because things were going badly
for the Africa Corps.

409
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,000
He didn't want his favorite general
to lose face.

410
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,783
I'm my favorite general,
and I don't like to be told...

411
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:31,662
...that some second-stringer
is up against me. Then I lose face.

412
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,047
Who the hell are you, anyway?

413
00:57:41,431 --> 00:57:44,801
CARVER: General, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Codman. Your new aide.

414
00:57:45,019 --> 00:57:48,768
Codman. I pulled your name off
the list because I know your family.

415
00:57:49,024 --> 00:57:50,138
I'm glad you did, sir.

416
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,064
Rommel is the best the krauts have,
and I kicked the hell out of him.

417
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,237
Now my own G2 section is telling
me he wasn't even there.

418
00:57:57,489 --> 00:58:01,701
But, general, he undoubtedly
planned the German battle.

419
00:58:02,328 --> 00:58:07,119
If you defeat Rommel's plan, you've
defeated Rommel. lsn't that true?

420
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,828
Codman...

421
00:58:11,962 --> 00:58:14,631
- Have a drink with me tonight.
- Yes, sir.

422
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,758
I have a plan
for the invasion of Sicily.

423
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:21,923
I want to make sure I get it approved.
You can help me.

424
00:58:22,138 --> 00:58:24,807
I want to give a dinner
for General Alexander.

425
00:58:25,016 --> 00:58:26,510
Get to him before Montgomery does.

426
00:58:26,768 --> 00:58:32,009
This will be strictly a formal affair,
Codman, but purely social.

427
00:58:32,356 --> 00:58:33,815
By that I mean...

428
00:58:34,024 --> 00:58:36,183
- ...purely political.
- Yes, sir.

429
00:58:36,444 --> 00:58:39,231

available. Everything, comme il faut.

00:59:22,196 --> 00:59:26,574
Sir Harold, I think it was Alcibiades
in the Peloponnesian War...

438
00:59:26,785 --> 00:59:28,445
...415 B.C.

439
00:59:28,661 --> 00:59:32,610
He said, "If Syracuse falls, all
Sicily falls, and then Italy. "

440
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:36,372
He knew that Syracuse was the
jugular of the island.

441
00:59:36,626 --> 00:59:39,414
Old Alcibiades always went
for the throat.

442
00:59:39,672 --> 00:59:41,748
I propose to take Sicily
in the same way.

443
00:59:41,966 --> 00:59:45,168
- How's it going?
- The old man has them in his pocket.

00:59:55,146 --> 00:59:57,636
I'll hit the beaches here,
take Palermo.

00:59:57,856 --> 01:00:01,271
Monty will drive north on the coast,
I'll come due east...

448
01:00:01,526 --> 01:00:04,195
...take Messina and cut off
the German escape route.

449
01:00:04,529 --> 01:00:06,153
Yes...

450
01:00:06,364 --> 01:00:08,605

marshal for Napoleon...

...if you'd lived in the 18th century.

456
01:00:22,921 --> 01:00:26,206

- Monty.

thought to the Sicily operation.

01:01:22,438 --> 01:01:23,551
Yes?

462
01:01:24,522 --> 01:01:26,064
I assume we're alone.

463
01:01:26,274 --> 01:01:29,690
Georgie Patton has already
discussed his plan with Alexander.

464
01:01:29,945 --> 01:01:31,059
I realize that...

465
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:35,235
...but I have an idea that his plan
may lead to an absolute disaster.

466
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:36,695
Oh?

467
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,576
Bedell, look.

468
01:01:41,789 --> 01:01:44,078
This is Sicily.

469
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,750
Now then, according to Patton's plan...

470
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:50,453
...I will attack Syracuse here.

471
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,164
And he would attack Palermo up here.

472
01:01:53,426 --> 01:01:55,751
Now, obviously our forces would be
divided.

473
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,717
And obviously, they
could be chopped up piecemeal.

474
01:01:58,973 --> 01:02:03,634
Now then, what I propose, and what
I shall insist on, by the way...

475
01:02:03,852 --> 01:02:05,097
...is this.

476
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,976
(MONTGOMERY EXHALES)

477
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:10,107
I will land at Syracuse as planned.

478
01:02:10,317 --> 01:02:14,017
But the Americans-
The Americans will land here, at Gela.

479
01:02:14,237 --> 01:02:19,279
I will advance north to Messina,
the Americans protecting my flank.

480
01:02:19,493 --> 01:02:22,447
After all, Messina is the key.

481
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,277
It's the reason for invading Sicily.

482
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,031
I'll discuss your plan with Ike.

483
01:02:30,003 --> 01:02:32,790
I'm sure he'll give it
serious consideration.

484
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:39,385
- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?

485
01:02:39,637 --> 01:02:41,345
That the plans for the
invasion of Sicily...

486
01:02:41,597 --> 01:02:44,468
...should have been put forward
in an Algerian lavatory.

487
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:48,226
George, I have bad news for you
about your Sicily plan.

488
01:02:48,479 --> 01:02:50,518
Ike has turned it down.

489
01:02:50,897 --> 01:02:55,311
Since the Italians will be defending
their native soil for the first time...

490
01:02:55,528 --> 01:03:00,106
...and the German resistance is
stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.

491
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:04,863
- Well, where do my people land then?
- In the Gulf of Gela.

492
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:06,702
There's nothing there
but a beach.

493
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:10,953
Yes, but it puts you in a good
position to support Montgomery.

494
01:03:12,044 --> 01:03:13,751
Where does Montgomery land?

495
01:03:14,004 --> 01:03:18,250
He'll land in Syracuse and drive north
to Catania. Possibly even Messina.

496
01:03:18,675 --> 01:03:21,794
And you'll be alongside,
protecting his left.

497
01:03:22,303 --> 01:03:23,466
I see.

498
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:29,802
ln other words, we get the burden again
while good old Monty gets the glory.

499
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,848
Ike had to consider all points of view.

500
01:03:33,064 --> 01:03:36,398
He made his decision not as an
American, but as an Ally.

501
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,775
Had it been the other way around,
I assure you, Monty would protest.

502
01:03:42,113 --> 01:03:43,276
No...

503
01:03:44,784 --> 01:03:47,025
...I've been in the Army 30 years.

504
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:51,823
When I get an order, I say, "Yes, sir. "
And I do my best to carry it out.

505
01:03:55,918 --> 01:04:00,047
This is what happens when your
commander stops being an American...

506
01:04:00,466 --> 01:04:02,458
...and starts being an Ally.

507
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:15,778
I don't think I've made
myself clear, sir.

508
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:19,620
It's true, Montgomery met the
toughest resistance there at Catania.

509
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:20,782
However, if we're-

510
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,454
Perfectly clear.

511
01:05:22,712 --> 01:05:26,756
Old Monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper.

512
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,713
But this order from
General Alexander...

513
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:33,799
...directing you to turn over the
Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery.

514
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:37,556
Well, then, old Bradley will have to
slug- slug, mind you...

515
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:42,560
...his way up center of the island over
those tough mountain roads, won't he?

516
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,012
Yes, sir.

517
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,314
Messina, Bell.

518
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:47,974
Messina...

519
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:52,064
...is the heart of it. If they'd
followed my plan, I'd be there by now.

520
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,697
I'd cut off the retreat of every
German on this island!

521
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,701
Now, you know what I'm gonna do?

522
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:00,284
I'm gonna go to Palermo.

523
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,538
I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina
if it's the last thing I ever do!

524
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:09,247
Hey, what's all this talk about taking
the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?

525
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,505
General Alexander's orders.
Road goes to Montgomery.

526
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:18,431
Now, that road was assigned to me.

527
01:06:19,182 --> 01:06:21,969
How can I get north without it?
You know the terrain there.

528
01:06:22,184 --> 01:06:26,349
I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run
into tough opposition. Very tough.

529
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:32,523
You wouldn't be taking advantage of
this situation, would you?

530
01:06:32,779 --> 01:06:34,273
I don't know what you're talking about.

531
01:06:34,531 --> 01:06:37,697
Without that road, your army,
except for my 2nd Corps...

532
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:39,284
...would be out of a job.

533
01:06:39,827 --> 01:06:41,903
Free for you to go into Palermo.

534
01:06:42,163 --> 01:06:44,285
Who said anything about Palermo?

535
01:06:45,749 --> 01:06:47,623
I can read a map.

536
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,161
Does Alexander know
you've pushed out this far?

537
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:54,092
That's a reconnaissance in force.

538
01:06:57,052 --> 01:06:58,250
George...

539
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,506
...are you saying I've got to slug
it out in those mountains...

540
01:07:02,767 --> 01:07:04,925
...with heavy resistance?

541
01:07:05,477 --> 01:07:08,477
Just so you can make
a bigger splash than Monty?

542
01:07:09,063 --> 01:07:10,344
General...

543
01:07:11,274 --> 01:07:13,397
...I just follow my orders.

544
01:07:13,652 --> 01:07:16,190
Like the simple old soldier I am.

545
01:07:17,155 --> 01:07:18,698
General Bradley.

546
01:07:19,783 --> 01:07:22,867
Sir, General Alexander has heard
we're moving west.

547
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,448
He says here, "Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.

548
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:30,577
Repeat. Stop, immediately. "

549
01:07:31,335 --> 01:07:33,493
That's what you think it says.

550
01:07:33,879 --> 01:07:36,833
I think it was garbled
in transmission.

551
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:39,629
Ask them to re-transmit the message.

552
01:07:39,886 --> 01:07:42,044
That'll take half a day at least.

553
01:07:42,263 --> 01:07:43,342
Yes, sir.

554
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:49,143
Now, Brad.

555
01:07:51,856 --> 01:07:53,314
Where were we?

556
01:07:55,192 --> 01:07:57,896
We were talking about a simple...

557
01:07:58,111 --> 01:07:59,770
...old soldier.

558
01:08:30,226 --> 01:08:31,685
Look at that, gentlemen.

559
01:08:34,021 --> 01:08:35,847
Compared to war...

560
01:08:36,314 --> 01:08:39,601
...all other forms of human endeavor
shrink to insignificance.

561
01:08:40,444 --> 01:08:42,733
Let's go, sergeant.
Move out!

562
01:09:32,411 --> 01:09:34,450
Give me that helmet.

563
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:38,831
Come on, let's get out of here!

564
01:09:51,137 --> 01:09:53,426
What silly son of a bitch
is in charge of this operation?

565
01:09:53,681 --> 01:09:56,350
I don't know, but they
ought to hang him.

566
01:10:08,446 --> 01:10:09,857
PATTON:
Afternoon, Padre.

567
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:12,693
PADRE: These men are here from the
States, looking over our program...

568
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:14,741
...for the spiritual welfare
of the men.

569
01:10:14,951 --> 01:10:16,659
We'll take you right into Palermo.

570
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:19,071
Col. David toured us around
your quarters...

571
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:24,039
...and I saw a Bible by your bed.
Do you actually find time to read it?

572
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:26,081
I sure do.

573
01:10:26,337 --> 01:10:28,246
Every goddamn day.

574
01:10:51,195 --> 01:10:53,686
Sir, Patton's taken Palermo!

575
01:10:54,866 --> 01:10:55,696
Damn!

576
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,524
(CHEERING)

577
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:08,669
(BAND PLAYS)

578
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,754
Palermo's the most conquered city
in history.

579
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:18,920
First the Phoenicians...

580
01:11:19,348 --> 01:11:22,882
...the Romans,
Carthaginians, Byzantines.

581
01:11:23,143 --> 01:11:24,887
Then came the Arabs...

582
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:27,682
...Spaniards, Neapolitans.

583
01:11:27,897 --> 01:11:29,356
Now comes...

584
01:11:29,566 --> 01:11:31,439
...the American Army.

585
01:11:41,619 --> 01:11:43,611
This is from General Alexander, sir...

586
01:11:43,872 --> 01:11:47,075
...reminding you that you are
not to take Palermo.

587
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:49,790
Send him a message, Cod.

588
01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:52,327
Ask him if he
wants me to give it back.

589
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,459
PATTON: Let me ask you a question
for a change.

590
01:12:40,717 --> 01:12:42,626
You've just come from Washington.

591
01:12:42,928 --> 01:12:45,384
How do they feel about our boys
taking Palermo?

592
01:12:45,639 --> 01:12:49,851
The general impression is, your army
barreled through token resistance...

593
01:12:50,102 --> 01:12:52,473
...while Montgomery faced the brunt
of the fighting.

594
01:12:52,728 --> 01:12:55,480
Don't they know we took on
the Hermann Göring division?

595
01:12:55,731 --> 01:12:57,142
Toughest outfit in the German Army.

596
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,477
The people at home
are interested in you.

597
01:12:59,694 --> 01:13:01,937
They're curious about your
pearl-handle revolvers.

598
01:13:02,156 --> 01:13:05,275
They're ivory. Only a pimp
from a New Orleans whorehouse...

599
01:13:05,533 --> 01:13:07,158
...would carry a pearl handle.

600
01:13:07,368 --> 01:13:09,028
What about your language?

601
01:13:09,287 --> 01:13:12,371
When I want it to stick,
I give it to them loud and dirty.

602
01:13:12,623 --> 01:13:14,450
What do your troops feel about that?

603
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:18,076
I don't want these men to love me.
I want them to fight for me.

604
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:22,591
Ernie Pyle says you have a secret
weapon here: General Bradley.

605
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:24,674
Ernie calls him "The GI General. "

606
01:13:24,886 --> 01:13:28,006
Omar Bradley is no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.

607
01:13:28,264 --> 01:13:30,505
MAN:
What's your feeling about Montgomery?

608
01:13:30,765 --> 01:13:32,924
PATTON:
He's the best general the English have.

609
01:13:33,184 --> 01:13:36,768
He seems more concerned with not
losing than he does about winning.

610
01:13:37,022 --> 01:13:40,107
He's not aggressive enough,
is that correct?

611
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:43,437
Look, I've been getting into
a lot of trouble lately.

612
01:13:43,694 --> 01:13:46,648
Yesterday, the office told me
that my Italian prisoners...

613
01:13:46,907 --> 01:13:48,698
...didn't have enough latrine.

614
01:13:49,284 --> 01:13:52,321
They didn't know what a
latrine was till I showed them.

615
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:55,948
If I've said anything too critical
of my British colleague...

616
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,494
...let's forget about it.

617
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,751
I will tell you one thing, though.
Off the record.

618
01:14:01,546 --> 01:14:03,253
I'm gonna beat that...

619
01:14:03,464 --> 01:14:05,337
...gentleman to Messina.

620
01:14:13,558 --> 01:14:17,009
Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what
this madman Patton is saying?

621
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:19,510
He's going to save our skins
by taking Messina.

622
01:14:19,771 --> 01:14:21,811
This report might interest you.

623
01:14:22,065 --> 01:14:25,649
Here I am in these bloody marshes,
fighting malaria and Germans...

624
01:14:25,903 --> 01:14:29,236
...while he's taking Palermo
and getting all the glory.

625
01:14:31,074 --> 01:14:32,236
Well!

626
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:36,199
Now he's up against three good
German divisions and he's stuck.

627
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:38,198
He's not going to get Messina.

628
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:41,826
That's reserved for the
British 8th Army and me.

629
01:14:43,002 --> 01:14:44,829
(BOMBS EXPLODING)

630
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:52,676
It's time for a move, Lucian. Terry
Allen's 1 st Division is bogged down.

631
01:14:52,929 --> 01:14:54,552
You're bogged down too.

632
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:58,091
What we need is another end run
just to break things loose.

633
01:14:59,601 --> 01:15:02,687
- Lucian. How's my fighter?
- Fine, George.

634
01:15:03,022 --> 01:15:07,268
Come in, come in. We need another
one of your amphibious specialties.

635
01:15:10,487 --> 01:15:14,651
Lucian, I want you to send a
reinforced battalion by sea...

636
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:18,324
...to make a landing up here at Brolo
behind the kraut lines.

637
01:15:18,579 --> 01:15:20,950
You want me to do a land-based attack.

638
01:15:21,205 --> 01:15:24,491
Right. I want a coordinated
attack the morning of the 11 th.

639
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,958
I don't think we can make it
by the 11 th.

640
01:15:27,212 --> 01:15:32,087
- Hell, it's only 15, 20 miles.
- My boys have been dying for yards.

641
01:15:33,092 --> 01:15:34,290
Hm.

642
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:37,636
Maybe you better kick a few butts
if you have to.

643
01:15:38,639 --> 01:15:41,593
I recommended you for your DSM
in your last promotion.

644
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:44,299
I know what you can do when
you put your mind to it.

645
01:15:44,894 --> 01:15:46,603
Excuse me, sir.

646
01:15:47,898 --> 01:15:50,983
I'm sorry, but I can't
do the impossible.

647
01:15:52,237 --> 01:15:55,984
You're too old an athlete to think
you can postpone a scheduled match.

648
01:15:56,198 --> 01:15:59,780
You're an old athlete yourself.
You know matches are postponed.

649
01:16:00,035 --> 01:16:04,329
If we can't back Lucian up by land,
our end run could be a disaster.

650
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:08,488
Those men might get caught
on the beach and cut to pieces.

651
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:11,283
- What's the matter?
BRADLEY: All we're saying is...

652
01:16:11,504 --> 01:16:14,173
...not to rush in until we're ready.

653
01:16:14,423 --> 01:16:16,216
Give him an extra day.

654
01:16:16,426 --> 01:16:17,837
Just one more day.

655
01:16:18,219 --> 01:16:20,178
The landing is on.

656
01:16:20,638 --> 01:16:21,836
We're going to Messina.

657
01:16:22,223 --> 01:16:25,592
We're going to get there before
Montgomery does.

658
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:30,306
- What's so important about that?
- General Truscott...

659
01:16:30,565 --> 01:16:34,264
...if your conscience won't permit
you to conduct this operation...

660
01:16:34,484 --> 01:16:36,145
...I'll find somebody who can.

661
01:16:36,362 --> 01:16:41,439
General, it's your privilege to
relieve me anytime you want to.

662
01:16:41,659 --> 01:16:44,779
This match will not be postponed.

663
01:16:46,997 --> 01:16:48,195
Any questions?

664
01:16:54,004 --> 01:16:55,167
No, sir.

665
01:16:55,589 --> 01:16:58,126
You're a very good man, Lucian.

666
01:16:58,382 --> 01:17:01,253
You want to guard against
being too conservative.

667
01:17:01,469 --> 01:17:03,711
Remember what
Frederick the Great said:

668
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:08,593
''L 'audace, I'audace!
Toujours I'audace!''

669
01:17:10,603 --> 01:17:12,512
Go on, have a drink.

670
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:18,766
Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking
for the next couple of days.

671
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:25,905
If anything happens to those men,
I'd like to be there with them.

672
01:17:28,913 --> 01:17:31,285
You're not going, so forget about it.

673
01:17:32,959 --> 01:17:35,449
You believe Truscott's right?

674
01:17:36,294 --> 01:17:37,575
No.

675
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,836
But you're gambling
with those boys' lives...

676
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:44,624
...just to beat Montgomery
into Messina.

677
01:17:45,804 --> 01:17:49,219
If you pull it off, you're a hero,
but if you don't...

678
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:54,014
What happens to them?
The ordinary combat soldier.

679
01:17:54,813 --> 01:17:58,811
He doesn't share in your dreams
of glory, he's stuck here.

680
01:17:59,567 --> 01:18:04,443
He's living out every day, day-to-day,
with death tugging at his elbow.

681
01:18:08,326 --> 01:18:11,528
There's one big difference
between you and me, George.

682
01:18:13,414 --> 01:18:16,331
I do this job because I've been
trained to do it.

683
01:18:17,084 --> 01:18:18,828
You do it because...

684
01:18:20,964 --> 01:18:22,588
...you love it.

685
01:18:38,688 --> 01:18:41,475
The men on the beach are
catching hell, general.

686
01:18:41,732 --> 01:18:45,351
The men are doing their best.
We have no replacements.

687
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:48,109
I can't break through to the coast.

688
01:18:48,364 --> 01:18:50,322
I'm going down there myself.

689
01:19:05,381 --> 01:19:06,792
PATTON:
Colonel!

690
01:19:07,884 --> 01:19:09,627
How did he get over there?

691
01:19:09,928 --> 01:19:11,801
PATTON:
What the hell are you waiting for?

692
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:15,546
Looking for a place to ford, general.

693
01:19:15,765 --> 01:19:17,758
I sent a patrol to reconnoiter.

694
01:19:17,976 --> 01:19:22,437
PATTON: I've done that. Down there
this sewer's no more than 3 feet deep.

695
01:19:22,648 --> 01:19:25,767
Get that outfit cranked up
or you'll be out of a job!

696
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:30,980
- And put that helmet on.
- Yes, sir.

697
01:19:46,045 --> 01:19:48,168
Move it! Let's go!

698
01:19:58,057 --> 01:20:01,557
- What's holding up this column?
- I don't know, sir.

699
01:20:01,769 --> 01:20:02,883
Planes!

700
01:20:07,273 --> 01:20:08,733
Come on, move it!

701
01:20:32,048 --> 01:20:33,542
Pull up over there.

702
01:20:39,846 --> 01:20:41,471
- Come on.
- What's going on here?

703
01:20:41,682 --> 01:20:42,595
Sir, these mules-

704
01:20:42,808 --> 01:20:43,839
Jackasses!

705
01:20:44,226 --> 01:20:48,688
You let a column get stalled and
strafed on account of two jackasses?!

706
01:20:51,525 --> 01:20:52,853
(GUNSHOT)

707
01:20:53,068 --> 01:20:54,811
No. No.

708
01:21:02,536 --> 01:21:05,452
Now, dump them over the side
and clear this bridge!

709
01:21:52,668 --> 01:21:55,537
We're pinned down because
we can't get air support!

710
01:21:55,795 --> 01:21:57,871
Nobody's getting any air support!

711
01:21:58,089 --> 01:22:01,293
Put fire into this battalion,
or I'll get somebody who can.

712
01:22:01,509 --> 01:22:02,790
Major!

713
01:22:03,262 --> 01:22:04,922
- You the executive officer here?
- Yes, sir.

714
01:22:05,138 --> 01:22:06,466
- Your name?
- WaIker.

715
01:22:06,681 --> 01:22:08,389
You're now commanding officer.

716
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,007
You've got 4 hours to break through
that beachhead.

717
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:13,220
If you don't make it, I'll fire you.

718
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:27,239
50,000 men on this island would
like to shoot that son of a bitch.

719
01:23:02,481 --> 01:23:05,820
Please take me home.
Take me home.

720
01:23:06,694 --> 01:23:09,364
Please take me home.
Take me home.

721
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:38,310
- There he goes, "Old Blood and Guts. "
- Yeah, our blood. His guts.

722
01:23:45,694 --> 01:23:47,111
Hi, how are you, son?

723
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:56,786
Where are you from, Gomez?

724
01:23:58,163 --> 01:24:00,080
California, sir.

725
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:01,918
Me too.

726
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:06,295
- Where were you hit?
- In the chest, sir.

727
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,174
Well...

728
01:24:08,633 --> 01:24:13,762
...this might be interesting to you.
The last German I saw had no chest.

729
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:16,097
Didn't have any head either.

730
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:20,060
You get well quickly, son.

731
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:31,422
(INDISTINCT)

732
01:26:14,422 --> 01:26:16,633
(SOLDIER CRIES)

733
01:26:16,885 --> 01:26:18,511
What's the matter with you?

734
01:26:22,473 --> 01:26:25,393
I guess I just can't take it, sir.

735
01:26:29,397 --> 01:26:30,815
What did you say?

736
01:26:34,318 --> 01:26:36,237
It's my nerves, sir.

737
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:40,617
I just can't stand
the shelling anymore.

738
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:44,995
Your nerves?

739
01:26:46,831 --> 01:26:49,793
Hell, you're just a goddamn coward.

740
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:53,547
Shut up!

741
01:26:55,798 --> 01:26:58,133
I won't have
a yellow bastard crying...

742
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:00,845
...in front of these
brave, wounded men.

743
01:27:04,223 --> 01:27:05,641
Shut up!

744
01:27:08,394 --> 01:27:12,105
Don't admit this yellow bastard.
Nothing wrong with him.

745
01:27:12,356 --> 01:27:17,069
I won't have sons of bitches afraid to
fight stink up this place of honor.

746
01:27:17,654 --> 01:27:20,239
You're going back to the front,
my friend.

747
01:27:20,447 --> 01:27:25,119
You may get shot, you may get killed,
but you're going up to the fighting.

748
01:27:25,704 --> 01:27:29,247
Either that or I'll stand you up
in front of a firing squad.

749
01:27:29,665 --> 01:27:33,794
I should shoot you myself,
you bastard! Get him out of here!

750
01:27:36,088 --> 01:27:37,549
Send him up to the front!

751
01:27:37,799 --> 01:27:41,928
You hear me? You goddamn coward!

752
01:27:51,019 --> 01:27:53,190
I won't have cowards in my army.

753
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:25,180
I had to kick a few butts...

754
01:28:25,388 --> 01:28:29,600
...but Truscott finally broke through
to those people on the beach.

755
01:28:29,851 --> 01:28:31,977
Have you seen the casualty lists?

756
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:34,271
Yes, I've seen them.

757
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:36,857
What's the word from the coast road?

758
01:28:37,067 --> 01:28:39,943
The 3rd Division's east of Brolo,
heading toward Messina.

759
01:28:40,152 --> 01:28:43,612
Let's get over there.
I want to go in with the troops.

760
01:28:43,822 --> 01:28:46,783
You go ahead, George.
I'm not very good at that.

761
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:50,121
General Bradley...

762
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:53,832
...it's time to consider how many
casualties we'd have...

763
01:28:54,039 --> 01:28:57,419
...if we were still crawling on
that goddamn road.

764
01:30:24,006 --> 01:30:26,049
Forward, march!

765
01:30:44,444 --> 01:30:46,403
Don't smirk, Patton.
I shan't kiss you.

766
01:30:47,572 --> 01:30:52,701
Pity. I shaved close this morning
to prepare for getting smacked by you.

767
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:03,378
Forward, march!

768
01:31:38,246 --> 01:31:40,291
You wanted to see me, George?

769
01:31:42,918 --> 01:31:44,878
Got a letter here from Ike.

770
01:31:53,554 --> 01:31:56,765
I was rereading Caesar's
Commentaries last night.

771
01:31:59,436 --> 01:32:04,231
In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to
distinguish him from his men.

772
01:32:04,438 --> 01:32:06,985
I was struck by that fact because-

773
01:32:09,736 --> 01:32:13,447
"Despicable. " First time anybody's
ever applied that word to me.

774
01:32:13,739 --> 01:32:18,037
Well, at least it's a personal
reprimand, it's not official.

775
01:32:18,286 --> 01:32:21,789
The man was yellow. He should've
been tried for cowardice and shot.

776
01:32:22,039 --> 01:32:26,421
People have taken a lot worse
than a little kick in the pants.

777
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:30,133
I ruffled his pride a bit.
What's that compared to war?

778
01:32:30,799 --> 01:32:34,886
Two weeks ago at Palermo they said
I was the greatest general...

779
01:32:35,094 --> 01:32:39,476
- ...since Stonewall Jackson.
- Now they draw cartoons about you.

780
01:32:39,682 --> 01:32:41,600
Dirty bastard!

781
01:32:42,061 --> 01:32:46,190
They got me holding a little Gl
and kicking him with an iron boot.

782
01:32:46,398 --> 01:32:48,899
You see that, what's on my boot?
A swastika.

783
01:32:49,149 --> 01:32:52,445
On my boot.
An iron boot with a swastika!

784
01:32:56,951 --> 01:33:00,370
"You will apologize to the soldier
you slapped...

785
01:33:00,997 --> 01:33:05,250
...to all doctors and nurses present
in the tent at the time...

786
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,546
...to every patient in the tent
who can be reached...

787
01:33:08,962 --> 01:33:12,341
...and last but not least
to the 7th Army as a whole...

788
01:33:12,717 --> 01:33:15,594
...through individual units,
one at a time. "

789
01:33:20,765 --> 01:33:22,266
God, I...

790
01:33:23,977 --> 01:33:25,604
...feel low.

791
01:33:32,653 --> 01:33:34,154
PATTON:
Oh, God...

792
01:33:34,403 --> 01:33:36,281
... Thou art my God.

793
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,367
Early will I seek Thee.

794
01:33:40,034 --> 01:33:43,120
My soul thirsteth for Thee.

795
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:47,833
My flesh longeth for Thee
in a dry and thirsty land.

796
01:33:48,082 --> 01:33:51,672
So as I have seen Thee
in the sanctuary.

797
01:33:51,879 --> 01:33:55,093
My soul followeth hard after Thee.

798
01:33:56,050 --> 01:34:00,095
But those that seek my soul
to destroy it...

799
01:34:00,304 --> 01:34:03,766
...shall go into the lower parts
of the earth.

800
01:34:04,434 --> 01:34:07,687
They shall fall by the sword.

801
01:34:07,896 --> 01:34:11,690
They shall be apportioned for foxes.

802
01:34:12,776 --> 01:34:15,861
But the king shall rejoice in God.

803
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:20,158
Everyone that sweareth by him
shall glory.

804
01:34:20,909 --> 01:34:25,247
But the mouth of them
that speak lies...

805
01:34:25,913 --> 01:34:28,208
...shall be stopped.

806
01:34:32,504 --> 01:34:34,755
Ten-hut!

807
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,176
PATTON:
At ease.

808
01:34:50,897 --> 01:34:54,235
I thought I'd stand up here
and let you people see...

809
01:34:56,109 --> 01:35:00,280
...if I am as big a son of a bitch
as some of you think I am.

810
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:07,789
I assure you I had no intention...

811
01:35:08,662 --> 01:35:12,585
...of being either harsh or cruel
in my treatment of the...

812
01:35:13,168 --> 01:35:14,838
...soldier in question.

813
01:35:19,843 --> 01:35:22,428
My sole purpose was to try
to restore in him...

814
01:35:22,636 --> 01:35:25,724
...some appreciation of his
obligations as a man...

815
01:35:27,309 --> 01:35:29,059
...and as a soldier.

816
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:33,147
If one can shame a coward...

817
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:39,277
...I felt one might help him
to regain his self-respect.

818
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,407
This was on my mind.

819
01:35:45,743 --> 01:35:48,246
Now, I freely admit...

820
01:35:48,455 --> 01:35:50,540
...that my method was wrong...

821
01:35:51,457 --> 01:35:53,709
...but I hope you understand
my motive...

822
01:35:55,128 --> 01:35:57,214
...and will accept this...

823
01:35:57,756 --> 01:35:59,507
...explanation...

824
01:36:01,174 --> 01:36:02,636
...and this...

825
01:36:04,721 --> 01:36:05,971
...apology.

826
01:36:08,223 --> 01:36:11,602
- Dismissed.
- Ten-hut!

827
01:36:17,691 --> 01:36:21,612
Good evening, general. I want to
report on a private poll I'm taking.

828
01:36:21,821 --> 01:36:22,864
What poll?

829
01:36:23,071 --> 01:36:24,239
The fan mail.

830
01:36:24,490 --> 01:36:27,286
Eleven percent con,
89 percent pro.

831
01:36:27,493 --> 01:36:32,038
And that 11 % of protest, in most
cases, is both obscene and anonymous.

832
01:36:32,288 --> 01:36:36,002
But the pro letters are mostly from
relatives and servicemen.

833
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:39,755
"I want you to know we're proud
our son is serving in your army.

834
01:36:40,004 --> 01:36:43,676
From the newspaper, we're not clear
exactly what you did and why...

835
01:36:44,136 --> 01:36:46,595
...but we want you to know
we're for you.

836
01:36:46,804 --> 01:36:48,639
Keep going, and God bless you. "

837
01:36:49,307 --> 01:36:51,059
Keep going, huh?

838
01:36:51,267 --> 01:36:52,686
Where?

839
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:00,733
I thought you might like a sip
of wine, general. It's New Year's.

840
01:37:00,944 --> 01:37:03,113
You didn't celebrate at all
last night.

841
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:13,332
I'm sick of sitting around this...

842
01:37:13,582 --> 01:37:15,791
...royal doghouse.

843
01:37:15,999 --> 01:37:18,961
We've taken Sicily.
I'm ready for a new assignment.

844
01:37:19,628 --> 01:37:24,383
Maybe you've got it.
Here's a radio message, just came in.

845
01:37:28,887 --> 01:37:30,014
Cod.

846
01:37:31,223 --> 01:37:32,641
I've been relieved.

847
01:37:35,018 --> 01:37:37,939
They've relieved me from command
of the 7th Army.

848
01:37:38,773 --> 01:37:40,650
I don't believe it.

849
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:44,653
Happy New Year.

850
01:37:51,077 --> 01:37:52,744
Just a minute, sir.

851
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:56,332
Since they're sure to give you
another command...

852
01:37:56,539 --> 01:38:00,043
...isn't it logical they'd
relieve you here first?

853

You mean command of all American
troops going into Europe?

854
01:38:04,673 --> 01:38:08,260
It's possible. I know it's been
discussed from time to time.

855
01:38:08,511 --> 01:38:12,974
The logic of it is so obvious,
it couldn't mean anything else.

this bottle of wine.

I'll help you drink it.

- Not bad, not bad at all.

860
01:38:35,955 --> 01:38:39,043
- Get me some writing paper, will you?
- Yes, sir.

861
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:42,587
Your wife ever give you the devil
for not writing?

862
01:38:42,795 --> 01:38:44,213
All the time, sir.

863
01:38:44,422 --> 01:38:48,426
Only I don't write as often as you
do. Don't seem to get around to it.

every time I come home, sir.

867
01:38:59,395 --> 01:39:01,064
Why are you up so late, George?

868
01:39:01,271 --> 01:39:03,984
Thought you'd like a nice hot bath
or something.

869
01:39:12,032 --> 01:39:15,535
I got this sleeping pill from the doc,
just in case you need it.

870
01:39:16,827 --> 01:39:18,455
Sleeping pill!

871
01:39:18,996 --> 01:39:22,043
- What's going on here?
- I heard the news, sir.

872
01:39:22,251 --> 01:39:25,546
- They announced it on the radio.
- What news?

873
01:39:26,421 --> 01:39:30,968
About General Bradley, sir. How they
gave him the top American command.

874
01:39:32,802 --> 01:39:34,096

feeling kind of low, sir.

Here on the desk, sir.

That's what done it.

- It's a hell of a job.
- I understand.

connected to the Normandy invasion.

That you're preparing to invade
at the Pas de Calais.

the German 15th Army there...

against us at Normandy.

will lead the main invasion effort.

Until today...

...my only experience
at welcoming has been...

987
01:54:07,069 --> 01:54:12,198
...to welcome Germans and Italians
to the infernal region.

01:54:13,701 --> 01:54:16,288
At this I have been
quite successful...

989

...since the troops, which I have had
the honor to command...

990

...have, to date, killed or captured...

991

...some 170,000 of our enemies.

992
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:40,232
I feel that such clubs as these
are of very real value...

993
01:54:40,605 --> 01:54:43,444
...because I believe
with Mr. Bernard Shaw...

994
01:54:43,653 --> 01:54:47,365
...that the British and the Americans
are two peoples...

995
01:54:47,617 --> 01:54:51,284
...separated by a common language.

996
01:54:53,955 --> 01:54:59,002
Since it is the destiny of the British
and Americans to rule the world...

997
01:55:00,547 --> 01:55:02,549
...the better we know each other...

998

The Russians,
don't forget the Russians.

1000
01:55:08,806 --> 01:55:10,516
I think that a club like this...

1001
01:55:10,766 --> 01:55:14,229
...is an ideal place
for promoting mutual understanding.

1002
01:55:15,061 --> 01:55:20,487
Because as soon as our soldiers meet
and get to know the English ladies...

1003
01:55:20,944 --> 01:55:26,325
...and write home and tell our women
just how lovely you truly are...

1004
01:55:30,996 --> 01:55:33,960
...then the sooner the American ladies
will get jealous...

1005
01:55:34,209 --> 01:55:37,129
...and force this war
to a quick termination.

1006
01:55:41,219 --> 01:55:46,139

to the Pacific and kill Japanese.

Congressional leaders like Senator
Clayburn Foss are quick to react.

1012
01:56:20,388 --> 01:56:23,097
This man has insulted

severely disciplined.

wouldn't be any reporters.

01:56:35,029 --> 01:56:37,281
I made a few remarks off the record.

1018
01:56:37,489 --> 01:56:39,952
Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.

1019
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:43,997
You know how suspicious the Russians
are of the British and us.

1020
01:56:44,205 --> 01:56:47,503
I was only trying to be polite
to the old ladies.

1021
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:53,175
If I'd seen the Russians there, I'd
have mentioned the sons of bitches.

1022
01:56:53,508 --> 01:56:56,470
Bedell, I don't know
anything about politics.

1023
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,638
I have no political ambitions.

1024
01:56:58,889 --> 01:57:01,892
All I want to do is
to command an army in combat.

1025
01:57:02,143 --> 01:57:04,188
Well, it's out of our hands now.

1026
01:57:04,438 --> 01:57:07,733
Ike sent a message last night
to the chief of staff.

1027
01:57:07,983 --> 01:57:13,156
Now it's up to General Marshall
whether you stay here as a decoy...

1028
01:57:13,405 --> 01:57:15,408
...or he sends you home.

1029
01:57:17,911 --> 01:57:19,581
He's a good man.

1030
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,291
At least he's a fair man.

1031
01:57:22,791 --> 01:57:24,585
I'll let it sit with him.

1032
01:57:39,686 --> 01:57:41,062
PATTON:
George...

1033
01:57:42,315 --> 01:57:44,609
...our war is over.

1034
01:57:44,817 --> 01:57:46,068
Over, sir?

1035
01:57:46,653 --> 01:57:50,034
It's just a question of waiting
for the orders now.

1036
01:57:57,583 --> 01:57:59,418
I feel I'm...

1037
01:58:01,086 --> 01:58:05,466
I'm destined to achieve some
great thing. What, I don't know.

1038
01:58:07,218 --> 01:58:11,306
But this last incident is...

1039
01:58:12,098 --> 01:58:16,104
...so trivial in its nature
and so terrible in its effect-

1040
01:58:16,687 --> 01:58:20,275
It can't be an accident.
It has to be the work of God.

1041
01:58:21,193 --> 01:58:22,567
Yes, sir.

1042
01:58:23,236 --> 01:58:25,779
The last great opportunity
of a lifetime...

1043
01:58:25,989 --> 01:58:30,492
...an entire world at war
and I'm left out of it?

1044
01:58:30,745 --> 01:58:32,121
No, sir.

1045
01:58:32,330 --> 01:58:34,415
God will not permit this to happen!

1046
01:58:34,873 --> 01:58:39,464
I am going to be allowed
to fulfil my destiny!

1047
01:58:44,426 --> 01:58:46,345
His will be done.

1048
01:58:58,945 --> 01:59:02,489
NARRATOR: In the greatest amphibious
operation ever attempted...

1049
01:59:02,696 --> 01:59:05,408
...a predawn naval bombardment
prepares the way...

1050
01:59:05,618 --> 01:59:08,663
...for allied soldiers to assault
the Normandy beaches...

1051
01:59:08,872 --> 01:59:12,460
...and claw out a desperate foothold
on the continent of Europe.

1052
01:59:27,602 --> 01:59:32,858
I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen
on D-day or D-plus-10. And I said so.

1053
01:59:33,105 --> 01:59:37,030
And here they are all hung up
in the hedgerow country.

1054
01:59:37,322 --> 01:59:41,409
They should pivot the way von
Schlieffen planned it in World War I.

1055
01:59:42,325 --> 01:59:45,996
Then we might get a chance to do
some real broken field running.

1056
01:59:46,997 --> 01:59:48,917
But they don't listen to me.

1057
01:59:52,089 --> 01:59:54,590
What a way to enter
the continent of Europe.

1058
01:59:54,839 --> 01:59:57,261
Along with all the rest
of the spare parts.

1059
01:59:57,885 --> 02:00:00,595
Sir, everything on this plane
is high priority.

1060
02:00:01,724 --> 02:00:05,520
Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you
unless he had something in mind.

1061
02:00:05,727 --> 02:00:09,357
I'll tell you, Cod.
I've learned my lesson.

1062
02:00:09,983 --> 02:00:13,529
If I ever do get another chance,
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

1063
02:00:15,364 --> 02:00:17,282
I'm gonna play the game.

1064
02:00:17,743 --> 02:00:19,787
If I forget, you remind me.

1065
02:00:20,535 --> 02:00:24,916
- I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs.
- Give me a swift kick in the ass.

1066
02:00:25,707 --> 02:00:27,001
Yes, sir.

1067
02:00:48,819 --> 02:00:50,363
Welcome to France, sir.

1068
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:53,033
Hope the war's still on.
Where's the boss?

1069
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:54,491
Right this way, sir.

1070
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:35,289
Patton, haven't seen you
since Messina.

1071
02:01:35,496 --> 02:01:36,539
How are you?

1072
02:01:36,747 --> 02:01:39,502
You're doing a splendid job
decoying the Jerries.

1073
02:01:39,709 --> 02:01:42,254
You'll forgive me,
I'm off to the front.

1074
02:01:42,464 --> 02:01:44,257
Best of everything, old boy.

1075
02:01:48,387 --> 02:01:49,889
By the way...

1076
02:01:50,348 --> 02:01:53,809
...intelligence confirms
that I'm against Rommel again.

1077
02:01:58,522 --> 02:01:59,900
Rommel.

1078
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:03,321
Hi, how are you, George?

1079
02:02:04,236 --> 02:02:07,617
- Pretty fair, Brad. How are you?
- Fine.

1080
02:02:11,454 --> 02:02:13,665
Well. My, my.

1081
02:02:13,873 --> 02:02:15,584
Isn't this plush?

1082
02:02:15,836 --> 02:02:18,795
Looks like you're
bucking for archbishop.

1083
02:02:19,006 --> 02:02:22,300
Chet Hansen had this rig built for me.
George, sit down.

1084
02:02:22,884 --> 02:02:26,848
Ike wanted me to talk to you
since we can level with each other.

1085
02:02:27,098 --> 02:02:28,264
That's right.

1086
02:02:29,142 --> 02:02:33,064
We're making 3rd Army operational
when I take over 12th Army group.

1087
02:02:33,272 --> 02:02:34,731
Do I get it?

1088
02:02:35,357 --> 02:02:37,025
I'll be honest with you.

1089
02:02:37,276 --> 02:02:38,945
I've had reservations.

1090
02:02:39,778 --> 02:02:42,865
You've been my senior ever since
I left the academy.

1091
02:02:43,117 --> 02:02:47,037
You were the boss in North Africa
and Sicily and I just thought...

1092
02:02:48,330 --> 02:02:50,498
...well, it might be a problem for us.

1093
02:02:51,041 --> 02:02:52,668
It wouldn't bother me.

1094
02:02:52,876 --> 02:02:54,880
There's one other thing.

1095
02:02:55,129 --> 02:02:57,090
We're different kinds of people.

1096
02:02:57,339 --> 02:03:00,178
Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right.

1097
02:03:00,385 --> 02:03:04,891
With your brains and my screwy ideas,
we make a great team, like in Sicily.

1098
02:03:05,265 --> 02:03:09,564
Truthfully, if I had been your senior
in Sicily, I would have relieved you.

1099
02:03:12,107 --> 02:03:13,317
Brad...

1100
02:03:15,067 --> 02:03:17,780
...I'm not crawling on my belly
to get a command.

1101
02:03:17,988 --> 02:03:20,618
For God's sake, get me in this fight.

1102
02:03:22,243 --> 02:03:25,706
The only way out of the doghouse
is to do something great.

1103
02:03:25,915 --> 02:03:27,582
I gotta get back in the war!

1104
02:03:27,791 --> 02:03:31,003
Hitler's own people tried
to kill him a few days ago.

1105
02:03:31,212 --> 02:03:33,549
First thing you know,
it'll be over and...

1106
02:03:36,927 --> 02:03:38,136
I'll...

1107
02:03:40,473 --> 02:03:43,350
...keep my mouth shut.
I'll behave myself.

1108
02:03:46,229 --> 02:03:47,941
I give you my word.

1109
02:03:51,779 --> 02:03:53,153
George...

1110
02:03:53,863 --> 02:03:56,492
...I've been working
on a plan called Cobra.

1111
02:03:57,075 --> 02:03:58,744
I'd like your opinion.

1112
02:03:58,951 --> 02:04:01,371
We've been slugging through
hedgerow country...

1113
02:04:01,579 --> 02:04:04,749
...half an acre a day
and we've got to find a way out.

1114
02:04:05,001 --> 02:04:06,544
I want to use this road.

1115
02:04:06,752 --> 02:04:08,547
The Saint Lô-Periers road.

1116
02:04:08,753 --> 02:04:11,466
Monty will pin down
the enemy forces at Caen.

1117
02:04:11,675 --> 02:04:15,345
We'll pulverize an area
31/2 miles wide with bombing.

1118
02:04:15,553 --> 02:04:17,556
Then seven divisions will follow.

1119
02:04:17,806 --> 02:04:22,978
The 3rd Army will swing around here, a
sweeping end run right across France.

1120
02:04:23,648 --> 02:04:25,022
What do you think?

1121
02:04:26,318 --> 02:04:31,737
I think you'll need a screwball old
cavalryman to command the 3rd Army.

1122
02:04:32,824 --> 02:04:34,452
George...

1123
02:04:36,536 --> 02:04:41,335
...Ike came to that conclusion
in London three months ago.

1124
02:04:41,919 --> 02:04:43,209
He what?

1125
02:04:44,045 --> 02:04:48,259
Why, that dirty-!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1126
02:04:48,509 --> 02:04:50,512
I promise to keep my mouth shut.

1127
02:04:51,637 --> 02:04:54,932
(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)

1128
02:06:47,143 --> 02:06:50,231
George could have the courtesy
to tell us where he's going.

1129
02:07:03,411 --> 02:07:07,001
Good God, look at that.
Where you going, general?

1130
02:07:07,293 --> 02:07:08,419
Berlin.

1131
02:07:08,668 --> 02:07:12,549
I'm going to personally shoot
that paper-hanging son of a bitch.

1132
02:07:12,756 --> 02:07:15,677
(CHEERING)

1133
02:07:53,929 --> 02:07:57,391
Hold it. Hold it!

1134
02:07:58,517 --> 02:07:59,894
This place isn't on the map.

1135
02:08:00,145 --> 02:08:03,020
You know why?
We've run clear off the map.

1136
02:08:14,788 --> 02:08:17,330
Give George a headline,
and he's good for another 30 miles.

1137
02:08:51,162 --> 02:08:53,538
(HONKING)

1138
02:09:16,731 --> 02:09:18,734
SOLDIER:
Atten-hut!

1139
02:09:19,735 --> 02:09:21,028
Hold it!

1140
02:09:25,281 --> 02:09:28,954
Pay attention. We're gonna clean
this mess up right now.

1141
02:09:29,246 --> 02:09:32,916
Let's move this vehicle out this way.
This one out this way.

1142
02:09:33,124 --> 02:09:36,046
Back that thing up there,
and we'll take this one here.

1143
02:09:36,254 --> 02:09:38,759
All right, get up off your ass.
Let's go now!

1144
02:09:50,521 --> 02:09:52,354
That's it.
That's the way to move.

1145
02:09:52,606 --> 02:09:55,442
Good boy. All right, come on.

1146
02:09:55,734 --> 02:09:58,945
Come on, now. Here we go. Come on.
That's it!

1147
02:09:59,153 --> 02:10:01,074
That's it! Gun it!

1148
02:10:01,659 --> 02:10:03,577
Gun that thing!

1149
02:10:03,868 --> 02:10:05,664
Okay, come on.

1150
02:10:07,290 --> 02:10:08,582
Watch it!

1151
02:10:09,292 --> 02:10:11,710
Go, go, go! Come on.
Hold it up.

1152
02:10:11,962 --> 02:10:14,214
Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah.
Come on.

1153
02:10:15,339 --> 02:10:16,926
That's it.

1154
02:10:17,551 --> 02:10:19,012
Come on, now.

1155
02:10:21,597 --> 02:10:23,599
- Chet.
- Yeah, will do.

1156
02:10:26,478 --> 02:10:30,148
Come on, keep coming. Keep coming.
Hold it up there.

1157
02:10:33,026 --> 02:10:34,488
Now come on! Hold it!

1158
02:10:34,736 --> 02:10:37,992
Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank!

1159
02:10:43,247 --> 02:10:44,706
That's it. Come on.

1160
02:10:44,957 --> 02:10:46,334
Good boy.

1161
02:10:49,129 --> 02:10:50,754
- Hold it up there.
- General!

1162
02:10:51,006 --> 02:10:53,340
General Bradley wants to have
a word with you.

1163
02:10:53,593 --> 02:10:56,471
Okay. Come on!

1164
02:10:57,637 --> 02:11:01,976
Okay. Hold it up. Take over.

1165
02:11:09,526 --> 02:11:12,197
George, you'd make a good traffic cop.

1166
02:11:13,948 --> 02:11:16,577
George this drive has been
magnificent...

1167
02:11:16,826 --> 02:11:19,705
...but I'm sorry to say
I have to slow you down.

1168
02:11:19,915 --> 02:11:24,084
- What the hell for?
- We'll have to cut off your supplies.

1169
02:11:24,333 --> 02:11:28,132
Gasoline, ammunition, everything.
We're up against new priorities.

1170
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:32,011
- I think I smell Montgomery.
- Take it easy, George.

1171
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:35,264
There are serious issues involved.
Political issues.

1172
02:11:35,516 --> 02:11:37,351
By God, it is Montgomery.

1173
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:41,521
The launching sites for the B-2 bombs
are all in his area.

1174
02:11:41,772 --> 02:11:43,816
Churchill wants those bases destroyed.

1175
02:11:44,275 --> 02:11:47,446
Hitler kills more civilians
in London than soldiers.

1176
02:11:47,652 --> 02:11:49,365
Expect Montgomery to do anything?

1177
02:11:50,115 --> 02:11:53,827
You give me gasoline and I'll gain
ground with it, kill Germans too.

1178
02:11:54,079 --> 02:11:55,997
Give me 400,000 gallons.
I'll go to Berlin.

1179
02:11:56,289 --> 02:11:57,876
George, I can't do it.

1180
02:11:58,124 --> 02:12:00,044
The Siegfried line
is an empty shell.

1181
02:12:00,293 --> 02:12:02,462
They stripped the equipment
and sent it east.

1182
02:12:02,711 --> 02:12:05,507
It's crawling with cows.
I can punch through in two days.

1183
02:12:05,759 --> 02:12:08,761
There's no use in arguing with me.
It wasn't my idea.

1184
02:12:08,968 --> 02:12:11,015
Why did you pick me to command?

1185
02:12:11,264 --> 02:12:13,305
I didn't pick you.

1186
02:12:15,143 --> 02:12:16,645
Ike picked you.

1187
02:12:20,025 --> 02:12:22,487
George, you have performed
brilliantly.

1188
02:12:22,861 --> 02:12:24,612
You are loyal, dedicated.

1189
02:12:24,863 --> 02:12:27,699
You're one of the best I've got,
but you don't know when to shut up.

1190
02:12:27,949 --> 02:12:31,663
George, you're a pain in the neck.

1191
02:12:35,376 --> 02:12:37,628
I have a lot of faults, Brad.

1192
02:12:37,877 --> 02:12:40,339
But ingratitude isn't one of them.

1193
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:42,091
I owe you a lot.

1194
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:46,889
Hell, I know I'm a prima donna.
I admit it.

1195
02:12:47,179 --> 02:12:50,432
What I can't stand about Monty is,
he won't admit it.

1196
02:13:02,614 --> 02:13:04,950
(TANK SPUTTERS)

1197
02:13:15,838 --> 02:13:19,049
Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas.

1198
02:13:19,509 --> 02:13:21,303
The point tank has run out too.

1199
02:13:22,972 --> 02:13:25,265
And there's a kraut column up ahead.

1200
02:13:25,681 --> 02:13:27,142
Yeah, I know.

1201
02:15:29,323 --> 02:15:31,244
PATTON:
Were you in command here, captain?

1202
02:15:32,744 --> 02:15:33,829
I was in command.

1203
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:38,666
My tank platoon was supporting
an infantry company.

1204
02:15:38,919 --> 02:15:43,756
Tanks ran out of gas,
so we had to fight it out.

1205
02:15:45,259 --> 02:15:47,929
We started 11:00 last night.

1206
02:15:49,347 --> 02:15:51,474
Finished a couple hours ago.

1207
02:15:53,643 --> 02:15:58,148
This morning the fighting
was hand-to-hand.

1208
02:16:46,536 --> 02:16:48,413
I had a dream last night.

1209
02:16:50,624 --> 02:16:53,836
In my dream it came to me...

1210
02:16:54,047 --> 02:16:57,382
...that right now the whole Nazi Reich
is mine for the taking.

1211
02:16:57,592 --> 02:17:01,972
Think about that, Cod.
I was nearly sent home in disgrace.

1212
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:05,308
Now I have precisely
the right instrument...

1213
02:17:05,516 --> 02:17:10,314
...at precisely the right moment of
history and exactly the right place.

1214
02:17:10,607 --> 02:17:11,941
The Saar?

1215
02:17:12,149 --> 02:17:14,277
This will change too, very quickly.

1216
02:17:14,485 --> 02:17:17,112
Like a planet spinning off
into the universe.

1217
02:17:17,364 --> 02:17:20,199
A moment like this won't come again
for 1000 years.

1218
02:17:20,408 --> 02:17:23,243
All I need is a few
miserable gallons of gasoline.

1219
02:17:23,622 --> 02:17:27,207
Right now, the weak spot is here.

1220
02:17:28,751 --> 02:17:32,214
In 10 days, we could be in Berlin.

1221
02:17:32,464 --> 02:17:35,966
What about the fortifications
that were done in Metz?

1222
02:17:37,804 --> 02:17:39,973
Fixed fortifications, huh?

1223
02:17:40,223 --> 02:17:43,267
Monuments to the stupidity of man.

1224
02:17:44,061 --> 02:17:47,564
When mountain ranges and oceans
could be overcome...

1225
02:17:47,815 --> 02:17:49,774
...anything built by man
can be overcome.

1226
02:17:54,573 --> 02:17:57,243
You know how I'm sure
they're finished out there?

1227
02:17:59,410 --> 02:18:00,788
The carts.

1228
02:18:02,541 --> 02:18:05,792
They're using carts to move
their wounded and the supplies.

1229
02:18:07,670 --> 02:18:11,635
The carts came to me in my dream.
I couldn't figure it out.

1230
02:18:12,968 --> 02:18:14,763
Then I remembered...

1231
02:18:16,596 --> 02:18:21,019
...that nightmare in the snow.
The agonizing retreat from Moscow.

1232
02:18:21,894 --> 02:18:23,731
How cold it was.

1233
02:18:27,151 --> 02:18:30,820
They threw the wounded and what was
left of the supplies in the carts.

1234
02:18:32,074 --> 02:18:33,952
Napoleon was finished.

1235
02:18:36,204 --> 02:18:38,956
Not any color left.
Not even the red of blood.

1236
02:18:40,208 --> 02:18:41,877
Only the snow.

1237
02:18:46,922 --> 02:18:48,342
Look at this, Cod.

1238
02:18:56,060 --> 02:18:57,519
I love it.

1239
02:19:01,522 --> 02:19:03,776
God help me, I do love it so.

1240
02:19:07,906 --> 02:19:09,448
I love it more than my life.

1241
02:19:18,669 --> 02:19:21,921
NARRATOR: Paris is liberated,
and French troops lead the way.

1242
02:19:22,715 --> 02:19:27,429
The Allies march into the city
after four years of Nazi occupation.

1243
02:19:27,846 --> 02:19:30,682
The hard-fighting French
2nd Armored Division...

1244
02:19:30,891 --> 02:19:33,269
...under Major General
Jacques Leclerc...

1245
02:19:33,478 --> 02:19:35,312
...gets an unforgettable welcome...

1246
02:19:35,771 --> 02:19:37,857
...as they enter their beloved Paris.

1247
02:19:42,948 --> 02:19:44,864
In a powerful drive to the north...

1248
02:19:45,074 --> 02:19:48,661
... General Montgomery cuts off and
bypasses the French coastal towns...

1249
02:19:48,911 --> 02:19:51,332
...of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.

1250
02:19:51,579 --> 02:19:54,835
Pushing on to capture the vital
Belgian port of Antwerp.

1251
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:02,592
Meanwhile, the main body
of Patton 's army...

1252
02:20:02,802 --> 02:20:07,139
...resupplied now and rolling like a
juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar.

1253
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:10,145
Nazi resistance appears to crumble.

1254
02:20:10,394 --> 02:20:15,108
It seems that nothing can stop our
troops from driving on into Germany.

1255
02:20:23,867 --> 02:20:26,997
- Sir, General Bradley on your line.
- Good, good.

1256
02:20:33,129 --> 02:20:35,881
Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead
across the Saar.

1257
02:20:36,132 --> 02:20:37,301
I'm on my way to Germany.

1258
02:20:37,592 --> 02:20:40,176
Wait a minute, George.
There's a lot of trouble up north.

1259
02:20:40,428 --> 02:20:45,559
I want you to transfer tank armor
to Middleton's 8th Corps right away.

1260
02:20:45,976 --> 02:20:47,521
Brad, you can't do that.

1261
02:20:47,895 --> 02:20:50,857
George, listen.
I don't have time to argue.

1262
02:20:51,107 --> 02:20:53,902
There's a lot of enemy activity
up around Ardennes.

1263
02:20:54,194 --> 02:20:56,446
No, I don't know how serious it is...

1264
02:20:56,696 --> 02:21:01,202
...but Ike wants us to meet
with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun.

1265
02:21:01,452 --> 02:21:02,662
Be there at 1100.

1266
02:21:03,163 --> 02:21:04,538
Yes, sir.

1267
02:21:45,504 --> 02:21:48,338
PATTON: There's absolutely no reason
for us to assume...

1268
02:21:48,548 --> 02:21:51,261
...that the Germans are mounting
a major offense.

1269
02:21:52,553 --> 02:21:56,683
The weather is awful
and their supplies are low.

1270
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:01,313
The Germans haven't mounted a winter
attack since Frederick the Great.

1271
02:22:04,023 --> 02:22:07,195
Therefore I believe that's exactly
what they're going to do.

1272
02:22:49,034 --> 02:22:51,953
I want you to start making
contingency plans...

1273
02:22:52,204 --> 02:22:53,915
...for pulling out
of our eastward attack.

1274
02:22:54,290 --> 02:22:57,084
Changing directions 90 degrees,
moving up to Luxembourg.

1275
02:22:58,876 --> 02:23:00,714
Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.

1276
02:23:01,423 --> 02:23:04,050
I want you to plan
for three possible axes of attack.

1277
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:06,178
From Diekirch, due north.

1278
02:23:06,430 --> 02:23:10,726
From Orléans to Bastogne.

1279
02:23:10,934 --> 02:23:14,478
From Neufchâteau against the German
left flank.

1280
02:23:34,793 --> 02:23:37,131
We've identified four German armies:

1281
02:23:37,379 --> 02:23:42,385
The 7th, the 5th Panzer,
6th SS Panzer and the 15th.

1282
02:23:42,930 --> 02:23:44,931
They've hit us with 26 divisions.

1283
02:23:45,181 --> 02:23:48,060
They've overran two regimens
of the 106th Division.

1284
02:23:48,308 --> 02:23:51,395
And 7500 of our men
were forced to surrender.

1285
02:23:51,772 --> 02:23:54,318
Our concern is that von Rundstedt...

1286
02:23:54,525 --> 02:23:58,488
...has the 101 st Airborne trapped
here at Bastogne.

1287
02:24:01,408 --> 02:24:05,579
Bastogne, by the way, is the key
to this entire area.

1288
02:24:06,372 --> 02:24:10,168
If we can hold it, we can break up
the entire German offensive.

1289
02:24:10,794 --> 02:24:13,505
If they take it,
we're in serious trouble.

1290
02:24:14,631 --> 02:24:17,009
Ike wants to know if anybody can go...

1291
02:24:17,218 --> 02:24:20,472
...and relieve the 101 st
before they're torn to pieces.

1292
02:24:22,723 --> 02:24:25,060
There's nothing Montgomery can do.

1293
02:24:25,309 --> 02:24:27,688
At any rate, not for some weeks.

1294
02:24:28,395 --> 02:24:30,399
What about you, George?

1295
02:24:31,318 --> 02:24:33,735
I can attack with three divisions
in 48 hours.

1296
02:24:37,738 --> 02:24:39,368
I'd give myself some leeway.

1297
02:24:39,951 --> 02:24:42,078
Ike wants a realistic estimate,
George.

1298
02:24:42,330 --> 02:24:46,460
You're in the middle of a fight now.
It's over a hundred miles to Bastogne.

1299
02:24:46,710 --> 02:24:49,046
My staff's already working
out the details.

1300
02:24:51,338 --> 02:24:54,385
Frankly, I don't see how
it's possible.

1301
02:24:54,846 --> 02:24:56,888
Not in this kind of weather.

1302
02:24:57,515 --> 02:25:00,348
I should have thought you'd want
to fall back and regroup.

1303
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:03,354
Not me. I don't like to pay
for the same real estate twice.

1304
02:25:03,604 --> 02:25:04,939
TEDDER:
But what about your men?

1305
02:25:05,274 --> 02:25:09,569
You can't cart them off 100 miles,
expecting them to attack without rest.

1306
02:25:09,987 --> 02:25:11,112
I trained these men.

1307
02:25:11,364 --> 02:25:13,281
They'll do what I tell them to do.

1308
02:25:13,532 --> 02:25:17,245
We hadn't realized you were
so popular with your troops, general.

1309
02:25:18,577 --> 02:25:22,542
I'm not. They'll do it
because they're good soldiers.

1310
02:25:22,791 --> 02:25:26,673
And because they realize, as I do,
that we can still lose this war.

1311
02:25:29,926 --> 02:25:32,678
Then I think I can speak
for Field Marshal Montgomery.

1312
02:25:33,552 --> 02:25:36,017
He'd say you're asking
the impossible of your men.

1313
02:25:36,266 --> 02:25:37,809
Of course he would.

1314
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:41,314
Cause he's never realized that's
what we're in business for.

1315

(BOMB EXPLODES)

1316
02:26:59,567 --> 02:27:02,032
General McAuliffe refused
a German surrender demand.

1317
02:27:02,281 --> 02:27:03,908
You know what he said?

1318
02:27:05,034 --> 02:27:06,287
What?

1319
02:27:06,661 --> 02:27:08,288
He said, "Nuts. "

1320
02:27:10,497 --> 02:27:11,750
Keep them moving, colonel.

1321
02:27:12,001 --> 02:27:14,336

This is where it pays off.

1324
02:29:34,872 --> 02:29:36,499
The training and discipline.

1325
02:29:37,583 --> 02:29:39,709
No other outfit in the world.

1326
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:44,091
Pulled out of a winter battle,
move a hundred miles.

1327
02:29:44,382 --> 02:29:48,471
Going to a major attack with no rest,
no sleep, no hot food.

1328
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:52,350
God! God, I'm proud of these men!

1329
02:30:18,005 --> 02:30:22,135
Sir, von Rundstedt's thrown another
panzer division against Bastogne.

1330
02:30:22,383 --> 02:30:24,595
101 st Airborne's barely holding on.

1331
02:30:24,804 --> 02:30:29,183
We need damned air cover. If we had
decent weather, we might make it.

1332
02:30:29,643 --> 02:30:31,688
CARVER:
General Mason, sir.

1333
02:30:46,288 --> 02:30:49,415
Hello, Mase?
Listen, we're short on foot soldiers.

1334
02:30:49,665 --> 02:30:53,377
Cannibalize your antiaircraft units
and turn them into riflemen.

1335
02:30:53,587 --> 02:30:55,464
Yes, every last one you can find.

1336
02:30:55,716 --> 02:30:57,006
Good evening, general.

1337
02:30:57,257 --> 02:31:00,469
I just got the weather report
for tomorrow. More snow.

1338
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:02,681
There goes our air cover.

1339
02:31:02,932 --> 02:31:05,601
We may have to wait
for better weather.

1340
02:31:05,847 --> 02:31:10,732
Brave men dying up there. I won't
wait, not an hour, not a minute.

1341
02:31:13,065 --> 02:31:14,485
Going to keep moving.

1342
02:31:14,735 --> 02:31:16,529
Is that clear?

1343
02:31:18,616 --> 02:31:22,162
We're going to attack all night
and attack tomorrow morning!

1344
02:31:23,204 --> 02:31:25,497
If we're not victorious...

1345
02:31:27,793 --> 02:31:29,793
...let no one come back alive.

1346
02:31:41,557 --> 02:31:43,268
You know something, general?

Sometimes, they can't tell when
you're acting and when you're not.

1348
02:31:49,566 --> 02:31:51,777
It isn't important for them to know.

1349
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:55,532
It's only important for me to know.

1350
02:32:02,582 --> 02:32:05,962
- You want to see me, general?
- Oh, yeah, chaplain.

1351
02:32:06,168 --> 02:32:08,796
I'm tired of 3rd Army
having to fight Germans...

1352
02:32:09,047 --> 02:32:11,383
...with supreme command,
no gasoline...

1353
02:32:11,593 --> 02:32:13,592
...and now this ungodly weather.

1354
02:32:13,845 --> 02:32:15,931
I want a prayer, a weather prayer.

1355
02:32:16,975 --> 02:32:18,308
A weather prayer, sir?

1356
02:32:18,559 --> 02:32:21,603
Yes, let's see if you can't get God
working with us.

1357
02:32:21,854 --> 02:32:24,316
Gonna take a thick rug
for that kind of praying.

1358
02:32:24,565 --> 02:32:26,820
I don't care if it
takes a flying carpet.

1359
02:32:27,026 --> 02:32:29,946
I don't know how this
will be received, general.

1360
02:32:30,196 --> 02:32:33,118
Praying for good weather
so we can kill our fellow man.

1361
02:32:33,366 --> 02:32:36,495
I assure you, because of
my relations with the Almighty...

1362
02:32:36,745 --> 02:32:39,958
...if you write a good prayer,
we'll have good weather.

1363
02:32:40,249 --> 02:32:42,878
And I expect that prayer
within an hour.

1364

by an oxcart.

1501
02:48:19,238 --> 02:48:23,869

for a professional soldier to die.

of the last battle of the last war.

At least the 3rd Army earned its pay.

1504
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:36,047

we liberated...

... 12,000 cities and towns...

1506
02:48:38,554 --> 02:48:41,430
...and inflicted a million and a half
enemy casualties.

1507
02:48:41,681 --> 02:48:45,434
I sense from now on, just being
a good soldier won't mean a thing.

1508
02:48:45,684 --> 02:48:50,482
I'm afraid we're gonna have to be
diplomats, administrators, you name it.

1509
02:48:50,732 --> 02:48:52,317
God help us.

1510
02:48:57,533 --> 02:49:00,660

1511
02:49:01,995 --> 02:49:04,832

here in Europe.

1512

1513
02:49:07,835 --> 02:49:12,966

win the war than any other private.

1514

Six-thirty?

02:49:36,118 --> 02:49:37,912
PATTON:
For over a thousand years...

1517
02:49:38,162 --> 02:49:41,165
...Roman conquerors
returning from the wars...

1518
02:49:41,415 --> 02:49:46,129
...enjoyed the honor of a triumph,
a tumultuous parade.

1519
02:49:46,962 --> 02:49:51,051
In the procession came trumpeters
and musicians and strange animals...

1520
02:49:51,301 --> 02:49:53,220
...from the conquered territories...

1521
02:49:54,096 --> 02:49:58,224
... together with carts laden with
treasure and captured armaments.

1522
02:49:59,476 --> 02:50:03,023
The conqueror rode
in a triumphal chariot...

1523
02:50:03,274 --> 02:50:06,569
... the dazed prisoners
walking in chains before him.

1524
02:50:07,486 --> 02:50:10,240
Sometimes, his children,
robed in white...

1525
02:50:10,490 --> 02:50:14,034
...stood with him in the chariot,
or rode the trace horses.

1526
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:18,081
A slave stood behind the conqueror...

1527
02:50:18,330 --> 02:50:20,963
...holding a golden crown...

1528
02:50:21,671 --> 02:50:24,505
...and whispering in his ear
a warning...

1529
02:50:25,089 --> 02:50:27,009
... that all glory...

1530
02:50:27,508 --> 02:50:29,346
...is fleeting.
