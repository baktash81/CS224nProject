1
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,718
Oh-oh!

2
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,678
Is that you on the beach?

3
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,479
- Oh, no, no, that's my, that's my mom.
- Oh.

4
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,296
Yeah. She came to this beach when
she found out she was pregnant with me.

5
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,835
I've never been, but, uh,
it's kind of our beach.

6
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,069
That's my little sister.

7
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,434
Ah.

8
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,599
Um, you want
to see more photos?

9
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
- I can...
- Um...

10
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,916
It's only for your eyes.

11
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,513
Real. Authentic.

12
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,794
You're right.

13
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,519
Thank you.

14
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,794
Sorry. I'm American.

15
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,357
Not too many gringos here.

16
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,670
- Yeah, bummer.
- Gracias a Dios.

17
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,796
She's not coming?

18
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,360
Uh, my-my friend.

19
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,078
You know, uh, mi amiga.

20
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,111
You know, the girl we left
back at the hotel?

21
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,077
You know,
she smelled like Don Julio...

22
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,673
and bad choices?

23
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,034
She always does this
to me, too.

24
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,599
She-she just,
she just disappears.

25
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,896
She's like
the-the-the fantasmo, no?

26
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,717
You know, you know fantasmo?

27
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,234
- Fantasma, con "A."
- Sí, con "A."

28
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,056
The whole reason I planned
to come on this trip,

29
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,355
con "A," was-was-was
to find the secret beach.

30
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,112
And now she's just stuck back
at Las Rocas

31
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,235
with the Irish flu.

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,918
Nursing a hangover.

33
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,111
Sí. Major hangover.

34
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,736
You-you don't like it
when someone

35
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,875
change your plans, do you?

36
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,757
No, I don't.

37
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,353
No, I don't,
it's just, you know.

38
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,509
It's not fair.

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,749
Ooh, you know why, though?

40
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,239
It's because I'm reliable.

41
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,594
- You know "reliable"?
- Uh...

42
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,032
"Reliable."
Bossy.

43
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,238
Um, I am re-li-able.

44
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,176
Yes, bossy.

45
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,111
- That's me.
- Very bossy.

46
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,189
Hey, um...

47
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,713
what is this beach called?

48
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,509
You're not gonna tell me.

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,158
Cool.

50
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,315
Cool. Frio.

51
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,793
Not possible.

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,313
It's too hot here.

53
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,516
No, no, you're cool.
You're being cool.

54
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Oh, never mind, that's good.

55
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,396
All right, I got it.

56
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,755
Is this the one?

57
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,352
Sí.

58
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,034
This is paradise.

59
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,315
Yeah. It's perfect.

60
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,788
Uh...

61
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,598
This is the island

62
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,478
of the pregnant woman. No?

63
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
La isla?

64
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
No.

65
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,119
Yes.

66
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,352
The nose... the breasts...
and her stomach.

67
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,668
No.

68
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,272
Yes, it is for me.

69
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,118
Gracias.

70
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Gracias, señor, um...

71
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,096
- No, no, no. Por favor.
- No, please.

72
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,394
Please. Please, I insist.

73
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,198
No, no, we were going
the same way.

74
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,316
I live close by,
so... don't worry.

75
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,879
Oh, are you sure?

76
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,076
- Yes.
- Okay. Well, thank you.

77
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,754
You're welcome.

78
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,353
I'm Nancy.

79
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,351
- Carlos. Charlie.
- Nice to meet you, Charlie.

80
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,714
Nice to meet you.

81
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,800
Um, you know,
have, high school.

82
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,154
You're in school?

83
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
No.

84
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,838
I mean,
I was in medical school,

85
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,876
but we didn't have
Spanish there, just cadavers.

86
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,394
I'll shut up now.

87
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,550
Okay, uh,
dark in a few hours, so...

88
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,517
Oh, I never surf at night.

89
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,158
And, uh, how you

90
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,719
getting out from here?

91
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,199
Uber.

92
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,759
Who is Uber?

93
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,831
Never mind.
Thank you, Carlos.

94
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,353
Thank you again
for taking me here.

95
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,396
It means a lot to me.

96
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,640
- Okay.
- Uh, what did you say

97
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,816
the name of it
was again, though?

98
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,115
I just forgot,
for some reason.

99
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,156
Careful.

100
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,514
Always.

101
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,668
Hey!

102
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,514
You speaking Spanish, guera?

103
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,592
I-I don't understand.
I'm sorry.

104
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
He say that it is hard
to paddle against the current.

105
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,799
Yeah, I wasn't expecting that.

106
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,348
I almost got caught
on the inside coming out.

107
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
- You American?
- Okay.

108
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,558
Sí. Sí, American.

109
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,709
Yeah!

110
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,836
California?

111
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,399
Uh, close.

112
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,356
Texas.

113
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,908
There's surf in Texas?

114
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,433
Yes, we have surf in Texas.

115
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,431
It's just not
like this, though.

116
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,232
Hey, this is a secret break.

117
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,878
How you find it?

118
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,991
Someone told me about it
a while ago.

119
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,195
What's it called?

120
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,508
If I tell you,

121
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,750
I would have to kill you!

122
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,552
Well, that would ruin my day.

123
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,030
Anything gnarly out here,
I should know about?

124
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,758
There's some rocks over there!

125
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,831
There's only one tide a day,

126
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,275
and when the tide gets low,
it becomes an island.

127
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,669
There's some nasty fire coral.

128
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,035
It stings like a jellyfish.

129
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,792
Okay! Gracias.

130
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,995
Sí...

131
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,398
Hey, guera...

132
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,030
Still have no idea
what you're saying.

133
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,197
He's saying that you should
come over here.

134
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,872
The wave breaks better.

135
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,274
Oh, I'm okay, I'm okay.

136
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,396
I'm cool here, thank you.

137
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,152
Careful, gringa.

138
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,630
It's rough out here
for a little girl from Texas.

139
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,312
I think I'll be all right.

140
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,315

Oh, my God. No way.

171
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,896
- Mom's beach, right?
- It's just as beautiful

172
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,753
as she said it was.

173
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,910
I wish you were here.

174
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,274
I wish she was here.

175
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,351
Does that mean you're alone?

176
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,159
Well, I wasn't gonna come all
this way just to wuss out

177
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,037
because I lost my plus one.

178
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,634
That's how you wind up
on Nancy Grace, okay?

179
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,233
Excuse me.

180
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,416
I am supposed to be the boring,
overprotective sister.

181
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,032
You are supposed
to be the fun one.

182
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,793
Sis, the surf here,
it's insane.

183
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,474
You would not believe
the perfect tube I just caught.

184
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,391
I could shoot tubes
just as good as you,

185
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,391
if you would just take me out!

186
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,675
I'll take you. I'll take you out
as soon as I get back.

187
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,316
I love you, sister-mama.

188
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,480
- I love you, too, short crop.
- Is that Nancy?

189
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,256
- It's Dad.
- Just tell him it's all fine, okay?

190
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,816
- Love you. Bye.
- Uh, no, it's, it's a friend.

191
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,016
Hey, Nance, don't hang up.

192
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,031
Give me the phone. Chloe.

193
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,030
Hey!

194
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,269
Hey, Papa.

195
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,475
Hey, sweet pea.

196
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,595
Where now?

197
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,318
Mexico.

198
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,038
I don't know
what to say, Nance.

199
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,712
I'm at a loss.

200
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,360
I don't, I don't,
I can't understand.

201
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,510
- I don't expect you to.
- Well, help me out, then.

202
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,696
I don't know. What do you, uh,
what do you want me to say?

203
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,119
Oh, say you're coming back.

204
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,872
Say you're not dropping
out of med school

205
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,110
after all this time,
after all this work.

206
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,816
- You know, just don't quit.
- Okay. Okay, Dad.

207
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,637
That's enough. Can we just

208
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,994
not do this right now, please?

209
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,798
It's what you love.
You help people.

210
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,472
Well, not everyone
can be helped, Dad.

211
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,788
You-you know that.

212
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,235
Don't do that.

213
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,360
Don't make this about her.

214
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,830
What else would it be about?

215
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,276
If you want to make this
about her, then you stay in it.

216
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,713
She was a fighter.

217
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,633
It's just she fought
too hard, Dad.

218
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,992
You know? And for what?

219
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,992
It all ended the same.

220
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,230
Just come back, Nancy.

221
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,673
Please.

222
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
I gotta go, okay?

223
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,956
- I'll see you soon.
- When?

224
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,678
- When?
- I don't know.

225
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,273
Nance.

226
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,998
I love you. Bye.

227
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,152
Yeah, girl, it's getting late.

228
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,798
Let's go in.

229
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,791
I'm gonna catch
one last one. Thanks.

230
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,552
Okay.

231
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,256
- Nice meeting you guys.
- See you later, guera!

232
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,430
Buenas noches.

233
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,235
Oh!

234
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,039
No!

235
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,359
Oh...

236
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,635
Help!

237
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,675
Help!

238
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,714
Hey!

239
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,358
Help!

240
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,396
Help me!

241
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,391
Help... me!

242
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,198
I'm here!

243
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,397
I'm here!

244
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,799
Help!

245
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,793
Yes. Yeah.

246
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,677
Here!

247
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,352
Here! Here!

248
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,799
No!

249
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,757
Help!

250
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,512
Please, help me!

251
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,113
Help!

252
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,909
Come back!

253
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,118
Oh, God...

254
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,510
Oh, no, no, no.

255
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,511
Where are you taking me?

256
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,239
Too far.

257
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,717
Okay...

258
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,155
Okay.

259
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,750
You're not gonna feel
a thing, ma'am.

260
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,879
I just put some
Novocain injections to, uh,

261
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,758
numb the area, so...

262
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,720
you're just gonna feel
a little pressure, but...

263
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,156
you're not gonna
feel the stitches, okay?

264
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,434
Okay?

265
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,796
Tie off the suture. Oh, yeah.

266
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,429
That's a nice...
that's a nice union.

267
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,469
One more, and then we'll
send you on your way.

268
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,596
Okay. Here we go.

269
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Oh!

270
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,838
Okay.

271
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,991
Okay, ma'am, nice clean wrap.

272
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,034
Get in line, buddy.

273
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,277
Just keep it elevated, ma'am.

274
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,590
Someone's coming.

275
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,036
Okay, okay...
you're gonna be fine.

276
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,709
There we go.

277
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,913
Gotta get some blood flowing.

278
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,195
Not enough flows
in this tourniquet for you.

279
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,674
Come on. Come on.

280
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,239
There we go.

281
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,753
There we go.

282
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,592
Okay.

283
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,830
Okay.

284
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,393
Okay, you get
two minutes of blood flow.

285
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,709
Okay... okay...

286
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,555
Compression bandage.

287
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,031
Oh!

288
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,598
Ew.

289
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,999
Are you still out there?

290
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,793
Stay!

291
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,195
Good bird.

292
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,475
Oh...

293
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,638
Hello!

294
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,349
Hey!

Help!

299
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,275
Turn around!

300
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,429
Come on!

301
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,314
Hello!

No, come back!

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,032
Come back, you can have it!

327
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,633
You can have it!

No, there's a shark!

335
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,554
A shark!

336
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,073
Wait! It's okay!

337
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,388
Just don't go!

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,958

Shark!

00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,188
Don't worry about it!

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,236
There's no sharks here!

353
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,114

Go back! Get help!

357
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,590
Come on.

358
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,874
Come on!

359
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,234
Come on, come on! Swim!

You're okay.

373
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,718
I'm helping you, little buddy.

374
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,989
Let me see you.

375
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,640
I'm not very good
at ortho, but...

376
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,591
it just looks
like a dislocation.

377
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,950
Like a separated shoulder.

378
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,589
I think it's the same.

379
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,796
We'll see, huh?

380
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,950
I'm just gonna
do this quick, okay?

381
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,996
It's gonna hurt just
for a second,

382
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,117
and then you're gonna be okay.

383
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,352
On three. Ready?

384
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,998
One...

385
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,672
two...

386
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,954
three.

387
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,634
I think we did it.

388
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,109
Ah! Ah! Hey, hey, hey!

389
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,395
That's a terrible way
to say thank you.

390
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,156
Now you've got a chance, huh?

391
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,708
And here comes the tide.

392
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,349
Camera.

393
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,070
That's the third time.

394
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,879
I got you.

395
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,436
32 seconds from
the whale to the rock.

396
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,953
Ah, ha, ha! Fuck!

397
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,638
iAyuda! iAyuda!

398
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,896
Come on, I got you!

399
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,016
I got you!

400
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,553
I got you! I got you!

401
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,755
Come on!

402
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,751
Hold on!

403
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,160
Oh.

404
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,555
Someone got you.

405
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,954
30, 40 yards.

406
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,076
One-minute swim.

407
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,590
I can make that.

408
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,356
I need a head start.

409
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,193
This is Nancy Adams.

410
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,236
It's April 26, 2016.

411
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,794
Uh, if you find this,
please send help right away.

412
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,552
I've been attacked by a shark.

413
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,676
He's killed three
other people since I got here.

414
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,193
He's still circling, so...

415
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,068
Uh, he's got this
big old whale over here,

416
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,434
but that-that's the problem.

417
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,936
I swam right up
onto his feeding ground.

418
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,155
I've been bitten pretty deeply

419
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,073
into my-my gastroc
and quad muscles.

420
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,799
I have a-a deep gash
running vertically

421
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,313
down my medial thigh,

422
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,311
and then it turns lateral,
just above my knee.

423
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,913
And right here,
there 's one going

424
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,195
across my, my posterior calf.

425
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,838
I'm losing a lot of blood.

426
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,319
Gangrene is setting in.

427
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,710
I feel like
I'm losing my strength.

428
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,392
I don't think
I have much time.

429
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,072
The-the island I'm on

430
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,799
is-is gonna be taken
by the tide in a few minutes.

431
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,075
I'm about 200 yards
off the shore.

432
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,957
On this beach.

433
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,716
I never found out
what it was called.

434
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,870
So...

435
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,709
Um...

436
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,912
This is useless.

437
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,353
There 's a buoy...

438
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,954
which I'm gonna try
to swim to...

439
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:05,319
about 30 or 40 yards away.

440
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,549
So, yeah.

441
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,153
That's...

442
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,878
that's the plan.

443
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,518
Um...

444
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,036
If you find this,
can you just, um...

445
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,678
can you just delete
that first part,

446
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,355
and, uh, and send it to, uh,

447
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,479
10231 Oliver Crescent Drive,

448
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,039
Galveston, Texas.

449
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,269
That's my home.

450
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,588
That's-That's where my, uh,

451
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,511
that's where my dad
and sister live.

452
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,830
Yeah.

453
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,029
Hey, Pop.

454
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,429
Hey, Chlo.

455
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,318
Um...

456
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,676
I finally got that alone time.

457
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,352
Super overrated.

458
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,558
Uh...

459
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,756
I mean I'm not,
I'm not totally alone.

460
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,319
I got this little dude.

461
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,356
Steven Seagull here,
keeping me company.

462
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,271
Show 'em your wing.

463
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,271
I fixed him for you, Chlo.

464
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,758
I just don't want
you guys to worry,

465
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,559
and I don't want you
to feel, um,

466
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,114
you know,
bad or anything, 'cause...

467
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,556
I love you so much,

468
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,790
and I miss you
more than I ever...

469
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,838
I ever even realized I could.

470
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,718
Dad, I gotta
get off this rock soon,

471
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,916
um...

472
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,913
but I want you to know
I'm gonna fight.

473
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,513
I am.

474
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,635
Just like she taught us.

475
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,154
You were right.

476
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,991
I love you.

477
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,516
I love you so much.

478
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,152
Time to go.

479
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,877
It's okay. It's okay.

480
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,030
You got it. Good job.

481
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,754
You're gonna make it, buddy.

482
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,591
You're okay.

483
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,879
Okay.

484
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,235
Okay.

485
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,390
Shit.

486
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,110
Oh, you're kidding me.

487
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,598
You didn't like that,

488
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,791
'cause it stings
like jellyfish.

489
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,675
This is my head start.

490
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,995
Come on...

491
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,640
Come on!

492
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,831
Okay...

493
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,671
No, no, no, come back.

494
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,751
Come back.

495
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,996
Oh... come back.

496
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,958
Come back.

497
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,910
Come on.

498
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,549
Come back.

499
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,511
This is Nancy Adams.

500
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,318
It's April 26, 2016.

501
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,360
Uh, if you find this,
please send help right away.

502
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,194
I've been attacked by a shark.

503
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,519
He's killed three other people
since I got here.

504
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,919
I'm losing a lot of blood.

505
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,230
I feel like I'm losing
my strength.

506
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,798
I love you more, short crop.

507
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,949
I'll be home soon.

508
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,073
No way.
Mom's beach, right?

509
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,896
Not everyone can be helped.

510
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,673
I don't want you to feel,
you know, bad or anything.

511
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,096
I gotta go, Dad.
I'll see you later.

512
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,236
Hey, sweet pea.
...she was a fighter.

513
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,554
I could shoot tubes...

514
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,755
I'm gonna fight,

515
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,558
just like she taught us.

516
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,511
Uh-uh.

517
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,633
Where are you?

518
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,110
Fuck you.

519
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:39,030
Oh, shit.

520
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,073
No... no!

521
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,472
No!

522
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,080
No!

523
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,594
iMiguel!

524
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,639
iPapá! iPapá!

525
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:53,960
iÓrale!

526
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,320
iÁndale! iÁndale!

527
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,557
Relax. Relax.

528
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,710
Breathe. Breathe!

529
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,914
I'm okay.

530
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,190
Ready to get wet, Dr. Adams?

531
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,271
Well, we'll see about that.

532
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,590
Nancy...

533
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,352
Ma would be proud of you.

534
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:58,558
Both of you.

535
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,312
Thanks, Papa.

536
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,316
