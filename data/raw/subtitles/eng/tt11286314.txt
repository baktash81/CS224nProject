00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,375
[exhales sharply] There'll be
magnitude 10 or 11 earthquakes...

339
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,375
You're breathing weird.
It's, uh, making me uncomfortable.

340
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to articulate the science.

341
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,125
I know. But it's so stressful.
I'm trying to, like, listen...

342
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,916
[Mindy] I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation.

343
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,875
I'm trying to articulate it
the best I can...

344
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:54,791
Madam President, this comet
is what we call a planet-killer.

345
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,333
[Mindy] That is correct.

346
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,875
Mmm-hmm.

347
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,333
So how certain is this?

348
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,541
There's 100% certainty of impact.

349
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,666
Please, don't say 100%.

350
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,333
Can we just call it
a potentially significant event?

351
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,458
- [Orlean] Yeah.
- Yes.

352
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,250
But it isn't<i> potentially</i> going to happen.

353
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,500
It <i>is</i> going to happen.

354
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,083
Exactly. 99.78% to be exact.

355
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,291
Oh, great. Okay, so it's not 100%.

356
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,250
Well, scientists never like to say 100%.

357
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,791
Call it 70% and let's just move on.

358
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,541
But it's not even close to 70%.

359
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,958
You cannot go around saying to people

360
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,791
that there's 100% chance
that they're gonna die.

361
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,791
[chuckling] You know? It's just nuts.

362
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,458
We should get some of
our scientists on this, you know.

363
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:44,250
No offense, but you're just two people
that walked in here with...

364
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,541
Dr. Oglethorpe.

365
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,166
Dr. Ov… Ogilvy. Yeah.

366
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,791
I've been head of planetary defense
at NASA for 15 years.

367
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:55,333
And Dr. Mindy is a tenured professor
of astronomy at Michigan State,

368
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,375
where Miss Dibiasky
is a doctoral candidate.

369
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,083
- [Orlean] Good.
- I'm sorry. Did you say Michigan State?

370
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,750
Exactly. They have
an excellent astronomy department.

371
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,250
- [Mindy] Yes.
- Come on, bro.

372
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,625
You kidding?
You wanna see my fucking SAT scores?

373
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,708
Okay, let's bottom line this.

374
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,666
What is this gonna cost me?

375
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,875
You know, what's the ask here?

376
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,041
There are government plans in place.

377
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,541
Um, actions we can take through NASA.

378
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,583
- [Mindy breathing heavily]
- Drones that can be outfitted with nukes

379
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:27,083
to deflect and hopefully
change the orbit of this comet.

380
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,916
We must act now.

381
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,583
[Orlean] Oh, hey.
All right, all right, all right.

382
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,000
- When are the midterms? Three weeks.
- Three weeks.

383
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,791
So, if this breaks before then,
we lose Congress.

384
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,833
Then there's nothing we can do about it.

385
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:39,833
It'll be gridlocked.

386
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,916
- The timing is just… It's atrocious.
- [drawer opens and closes]

387
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,125
Okay, at this very moment,
I say we sit tight and assess.

388
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,458
[Jason] Sit tight and assess.

389
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,625
[Orlean] Let's get some other people
on this. Some Ivy Leaguers.

390
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,458
And you and I will review the NASA plans.

391
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,291
- Okay?
- I'd greatly appreciate that.

392
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,583
Am I to understand correctly that,

393
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,333
after all of the information
you've received today,

394
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:12,291
the decision you're making
is to "sit tight and assess"?

395
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,625
- I'm sorry, who is she?
- Who the fuck are you? Aren't you her son?

396
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,416
I'm the fucking Chief of Staff,
Boy with the Dragon Tattoo.

397
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,791
So I'm doing fine.

398
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,541
[whispers] We gotta get out of here.
This place is a freak show.

399
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,208
[Mindy] I think what Miss Dibiasky
is trying to say

400
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:30,375
is that the idea of sitting tight
is an extremely, extremely dangerous...

401
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,125
Oh, oh! [laughing]

402
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,416
[sighs]

403
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,750
Thank you.
One good thing happened today. [chuckles]

404
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,916
Okay, funny story. [clears throat]

405
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,666
When I was running for president,

406
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,958
I had to sneak cigarettes for
the whole first month of the campaign

407
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,291
because, you know,
photographs of me smoking

408
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,333
went for, what, a hundred grand a pop?

409
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,500
[chuckles]

410
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,541
So, I'm always hiding, but,
you know, I just got sick of it.

411
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:56,208
And I just said, "You know what,
I'm gonna smoke whenever I want to."

412
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,416
[chuckles] Mmm…

413
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:01,791
Guess what happened?

414
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:06,500
- I went up three points in the polls.
- [Jason] They loved that she kept it real.

415
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,458
They love watching a smokeshow smoke.

416
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,583
I can't think of another president
that I'd ever wanna see in <i>Playboy.</i>

417
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:15,000
Do you know how many, uh,
"the world is ending" meetings

418
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,708
that we've had over the years?

419
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:20,833
Economic collapse, loose nukes,
car exhaust killing the atmosphere.

420
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,666
- Rogue AI.
- Drought, famine, plague…

421
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,958
- Uh…
- [Orlean] Everything.

422
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:28,833
[chuckles] Alien invasion,
population growth, hole in the ozone...

423
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:29,916
Jason, hey.

424
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,166
- Read the room for once in your life.
- Sorry, Mom.

425
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,000
Point is, I have a job to do.

426
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,833
You do understand
that this is an apocalyptic event.

427
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:43,250
This is a large celestial body
heading towards our planet at speeds...

428
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,333
Dr. Mindy, I hear you.

429
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,625
I hear you.

430
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,208
- You should be proud.
- [breathes deeply] Thank you.

431
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,666
I'm taking it very seriously.
I'm taking it straight in the heart.

432
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,875
I'm so glad to hear that.
You have no idea.

433
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey, gang, obviously everything we talked
about in here, super classified, right?

434
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,500
- [Oglethorpe] Yeah.
- Cool.

435
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,750
Thanks for dressing up.

436
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,291
[upbeat tense music playing]

437
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,041
[Mindy] You're saying
we're just gonna leak it to the press?

438
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,625
- Isn't that illegal?
- Hell yeah, we're going to leak it.

439
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,333
In case you didn't notice,
the White House just blew us off.

440
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,375
My boyfriend, Phillip,
says he knows a reporter

441
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,458
from the <i>New York Herald</i>
who will talk to us.

442
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,250
- Adul Grelio.
- Good. He's a heavy hitter.

443
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,541
And I'll reach out to more of
the scientific community on the down-low.

444
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:38,416
- I just feel like this isn't what I do.
- You're just telling a story.

445
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,750
Keep it simple.

446
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,583
No math.

447
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,166
But it's <i>all</i> math.

448
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,875
[music continues playing]

449
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,458
[uplifting electronic music playing]

450
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,333
[male voice on video] <i>It all started</i>
<i>with a connection.</i>

451
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:03,041

452
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,000

[man 2] We love you, Peter!

466
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,375
Hello, everyone.

467
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,833
All of my life's work,

468
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:57,416
really, I see has been driven
by an inexpressible need for a friend

469
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,416
who would understand and soothe me.

470
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,791
And you know, now all those years of work
have come to fruition with BASH LiiF,

471
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:10,375
our new BASH 14.3, uh, phone

472
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:14,750
is fully integrated
into your every feeling and desire

473
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:17,333
without you needing
to say one single word.

474
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,291
If I feel…

475
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,291
- Sad.
- [boy] Afraid.

476
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,458
Or alone.

477
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:25,750
The BASH 14.3 phone,
when set to the life setting,

478
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:28,958

through blood pressure…

479
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,541
- Uh, heartbeats and...
- [phone chimes]

484
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,416
[Peter laughing] Oh, that's wonderful.

485
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,666
That video. Um…

486
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,083
It also, seriously, uh, schedules

487
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,375
a therapy session
with a nearby professional,

488
00:26:55,458 --> 00:27:00,208
so we can make sure that
these sad feelings never ever ever return.

489
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,958
- May I say something, Mr. Isherwell?
- [Peter] No.

490
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:07,541
And to support, uh, BASH LiiF,
uh, I wanna officially announce…

491
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,041
Oh, give me the phones. They're not yours.

492
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:15,125
- [softly] Say bye.
- Bye, Mr. Isherwell.

493
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,458
Bye, Peter.

494
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:18,458
Um, I love you, Peter.

495
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,333
Are you sure the video
of the puppy on the rooster

496
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:25,416
is optimizing our prepubescent
sense memory consumer sector?

497
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,166
I find the bird quite threatening.

498
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,291
We will cross-check
the data on that, for sure.

499
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,958
Mr. Isherwell, Paul Debent
wanted me to give this to you.

500
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,791
He got it from
an astronomer friend of his in Mexico.

501
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, my.

502
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:43,000
What other confirmation
do we have on this, Adul?

503
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,416
[Adul] I've spoken to Dr. Oglethorpe in DC
and he confirmed it and all the math.

504
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Then I showed it
to Dr. Franks at Columbia,

505
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,833
and he almost fell out of his chair.

506
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,875
So, look, I have to admit.
I was very skeptical at first,

507
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,583
but this is all quite credible.

508
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,916
The calculations are credible.

509
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,250
Jesus.

510
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,750
And the president
really said to sit tight?

511
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,583
- [Mindy] Yes. That's correct.
- "Sit tight and assess."

512
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,708
She's probably worried about the midterms.

513
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,375
We need to move fast.

514
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,333
The feds will claim breach of security,

515
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:13,375
so make sure these two
get a pro bono attorney.

516
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,458
- [woman 1] You can use my attorney.
- You can certainly afford it now.

517
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,833
We're gonna hire a lawyer?

518
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:20,166
- [woman 1] That wasn't necessary.
- [woman 2] It was.

519
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,791
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

520
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,166
That was not called for.

521
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,083
[Mindy] I just have a question here.

522
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,625
How is it criminal if we just tell people,

523
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:31,000
like the public, you know,
what we saw, and tell them the truth?

524
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,166
Make sure this one gets media training
before he hits the shows.

525
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,875
He seems a step slow.

526
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:38,083
What does that mean,
I need media training?

527
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:41,791
They want us on a show
called <i>The Daily Rip</i>

528
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,500
first thing in the morning
before the article comes out.

529
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,416
You guys know what <i>The Daily Rip</i> is?

530
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,000
It's like the best show.
Everyone wants to be on it.

531
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,916
Brie and Jack have legendary chemistry.

532
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,250
They asked me to go on once.

533
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,500
I was so excited
I couldn't sleep for two nights,

534
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,916
but then they cut me for time.

535
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,750
Still hurts me to think about that.

536
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:01,583
I know what show you're talking about.
My wife loves that show.

537
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:04,458
Okay, can you just tell me
what this is all about? Okay?

538
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:07,916
'Cause you haven't read my article
on Conlon getting hard in the art class.

539
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,791
Now Adul Grelio has come down
from his mountaintop for your thing.

540
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,625
You won't even give me
a lousy pronoun? Come on.

541
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,708
A comet, bigger than the asteroid
that destroyed the dinosaurs,

542
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,166
is headed directly at Earth.

543
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,541
If it isn't deflected,
the entire planet dies.

544
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,625
Wait, what did you just say?

545
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,000
It's for a video game.

546
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,791
Are you being serious?

547
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,541
Yes.

548
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,083
Oh, my God.

549
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,833
- [pleasant piano music playing]
- [inaudible dialogue]

550
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,083
[gasping]

551
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,041
Oh, my God! What the fuck, man?

552
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,916
I love you too. All right. Yeah.

553
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,958
Hey, guys,
we gotta keep walking, all right?

554
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,208
Come on.

555
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,166
[pensive music playing]

556
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,458
- You must be Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky?
- Yes.

557
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,833
Jack and Brie are so excited
to have you on the show.

558
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,750
Really? They know who we are?

559
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,166
White House is denying
they even met with them.

560
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,791
Well, assholes will always be assholes.

561
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,625
Hi, I'm Thalia.

562
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:57,000
The <i>Herald</i> sent me
to help with your wardrobe.

563
00:30:58,416 --> 00:30:59,833
Oh, I'm not wearing that.

564
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:05,416
[woman 1] Yeah, you actually have
really great facial structure.

565
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,333
How 'bout if we trim
this beard down a little bit and...

566
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,833
I love your hair.

567
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,541
Thank you.

568
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:15,958
How are we gonna do this?
I talk about the discovery and you…

569
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,083
Talk about how urgent it is
that we take action.

570
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,416
[whispers] How do we say it? I mean…

571
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:26,125
- Shouldn't we practice it or write it out?
- [woman 1] Can I get you some water?

572
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,458
Yeah, water. Yeah, water would be nice.

573
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,416
You are here now.
You are here now. You are here now.

574
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,375
[repeating] Eleven benevolent elephants.
Eleven benevolent elephants.

575
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,041
- Just gonna take some Xanax.
- Hmm.

576
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,833
[Mindy] I take it sometimes when I…

577
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:46,625
Kate, not this time. Not this time.

578
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:56,291
[sighs] He just needs to breathe
and speak up. You know?

579
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,875
He's got this. I know he does.

580
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,250
[breathing heavily]

581
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,458
Oh, God. Come on.

582
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,125
[straining, exhales]

583
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:08,958
[straining]

584
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,208
You are here now.
You are here now. You are here now.

585
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,333
You're here now.

586
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:18,458
Oh, God!

587
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:20,375
[Jack] You gotta
stop drinking the cheap shit.

588
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,666
[Brie scoffs]

589
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,750
- It's only two glasses.
- Yeah, two and a half.

590
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,541
- [man] We're 20 out.
- Always running late.

591
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,541
[man] Let's make sure that our eye lines,

592
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,250
that we're not looking
at Jack and Brie, please, all right?

593
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,708
And cue the package.

594
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,333
Two glasses. Here we go again.

595
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:36,166
[theme music playing]

596
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,708
- Ladies okay?
- Yes. And we're live.

597
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:58,083
<i>Brie, I've got something for you today.
Listen to this.</i>

598
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,041
<i>President Orlean's Supreme Court nominee,
Sheriff Conlon,</i>

599
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:06,208
<i>has now been identified
as appearing in a softcore porn cable show</i>

600
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,791
<i>- from the early '90s…</i>
- Ridiculous.

601
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:10,833
<i>- …called</i> Satin Sheet Nights.
- [imperceptible]

602
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,750
<i>- This story just keeps going and going…</i>
- [Brie on TV] <i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

603
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,125
[whispers] Is that Riley Bina?

604
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,166
- [Brie] <i>Yes, well, it's a…</i>
- [Mindy] Really?

605
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:19,291
[Brie speaking indistinctly on TV]

606
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,208
[whispers] She looks a lot smaller
in person, doesn't she?

607
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,750
- [Brie] <i>Ride 'em, cowboy.</i>
- [laughing]

608
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:25,916
[purring]

609
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,333
- [Jack] <i>Good.</i>
- [Brie] <i>Hee-haw!</i>

610
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:30,083
Hey, everyone. I'm Sean from the show.

611
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:33,875
Uh, we're gonna do… Jack and Brie
are gonna do ten on the SCOTUS nominee.

612
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:37,250
- Riley Bina, you'll come on and...
- I get to talk about my single, right?

613
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,291
A portion of the profits
goes to the manatee sanctuaries.

614
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,375
Yes, but the, uh, breakup first.

615
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:45,083
And then Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky,

616
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,583
you'll come on and talk about
that planet you discovered.

617
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,458
Uh… Comet. We found a comet.

618
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:51,666
They know what we're here
to talk about, right?

619
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,458
Of course. Jack and Brie
love doing science segments.

620
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:56,375
Just remember, keep it light, fun.

621
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:58,875
- Jack and Brie love having a good time.
- [sighing]

622
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,500
That's not promising.

623
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,708
You guys discovered a comet?
That's so dope.

624
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,916
I have a tattoo
of a shooting star on my back.

625
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,833
- Oh.
- That's terrific. [chuckles]

626
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:08,916
[Riley chuckles]

627
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:17,750
We heard about your breakup too,
so we just wanna say…

628
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,333
We're very sorry, right?

629
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,291
We're real sorry.
You seem like a… great person.

630
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,583
Why don't you mind
your own business, you old fuck?

631
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:27,791
[girls chuckle]

632
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Okay.

633
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,291
Not gonna lie, but, um, my friends

634
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,750
and my Vroom Vroom Army
have been so amazing.

635
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:42,500
So, I'm really grateful for that.
But, yeah, I can't lie. It's been hard.

636
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,291
- You're an inspiration. It's incredible.
- To so many.

637
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,250
You're really owning that pain.

638
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:51,041
You know, Jack, I feel like
there's some kind of conversation

639
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,500
that we need to be having here.
Is there any message

640
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:58,750
that you would like
to send to your, uh, ex, DJ Chello?

641
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:01,083
You know, um…

642
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,625
[Jack] If there's something...

643
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,291
- Yeah.
- Right here in this camera.

644
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:07,666
Tell him. As if that was him.
You tell him exactly what you're thinking.

645
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,208
Okay, um… [clears throat]

646
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,500
[sighs]

647
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:12,666
Chell.

648
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,250
[sighs] I still love you,
and, um, after many sleepless nights,

649
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,833
three,

650
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:23,875
I wanna take you back.

651
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,708
I'm sorry. Whoa, uh…

652
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:26,875
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

653
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,875
- [Brie on TV] <i>He cheated on you.</i>
- Oh, my God. You guys…

654
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,666
Yeah. I do.

655
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,000
- Diddly just exploded.
- So did Vroom Vroom.

656
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,250
BASH News just sent me
eight push notifications.

657
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,166
- About this?
- Yeah, look.

658
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,708
My phone just purchased
DJ Chello's latest single.

659
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,875
What the… It just did that without asking.

660
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,791
I'm being told that
we have DJ Chello live on a Mugg link.

661
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,791
- What's he got to say for himself?
- I love the producers here.

662
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,125
<i>Hey, baby doll. Hey.</i>

663
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,083
- Hi. Hi, baby. [crying]
- [Jack] He's in tears.

664
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,083
<i>- Your kid messed up bad.</i>
- I know.

665
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,666
<i>Lady Baroque wasn't wearing
any panties in the club that night.</i>

666
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,416
- It's fine.
<i>- I just got all crazy.</i>

667
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,416
<i>I wasn't thinking straight.
I made a mistake.</i>

668
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,375
<i>But, look, it's always been you.</i>

669
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,791
Oh! I get it. It's okay.

670
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,583
<i>I hooked up with her too,
last year at the Music Globes</i>

671
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,000
<i>right before I ran off
with that power forward from the Nuggets,</i>

672
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,250
and none of that matters.

673
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,916
What about "Forget breakup sex.
Try breakup relationship"?

674
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,166
- That's good.
- Come on.

675
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,166
"Ten famous second chances
for two-timers," guys.

676
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,166
It's on a plate.

677
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,125
<i>I've been scared, but, honestly,
I'm not scared anymore.</i>

678
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,041
Okay.

679
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,958
<i>My little bumblebee, will you marry me?</i>

680
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,625
- [gasps] Oh, my God. Of course.
- [Jack] Oh, wow.

681
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,208
<i>- Chell, of course.</i>
- [DJ Chello] <i>Yes!</i>

682
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,416
<i>- Yes!</i>
- That's sick.

683
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,333
[DJ Chello] <i>Yes!</i>

684
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,791
All right, DJ Chello.

685
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,875
- [cell phones vibrating]
- What is happening?

686
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:41,916
Just bought another.

687
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,916
- Who are these people again?
- They're like the biggest names…

688
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,500
[Brie chuckles]

689
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:49,625
Well, the fireworks
have certainly gone off today.

690
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,875
- They have.
- What a zinger!

691
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,458
[Jack] Yes, they have.

692
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:55,250
From a wedding proposal
to a little science experiment.

693
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,250
I'll need a temple rub
and a martini later on.

694
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:02,041
[Brie] Our last guests today have made
a pretty big discovery in space.

695
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,041
Astronomer Dr. Randall Mindy

696
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:07,208
and PhD candidate
Miss Kate Dibiasky are here.

697
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,333
Welcome to the show.

698
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:11,583
Can I ask you one thing before we go
any further? I have to know this.

699
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:14,208
Is there life out there?

700
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:17,708
- Can you tell us? Yes or no, final answer.
- We don't have the data.

701
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,958
But sure, in the vastness
of space, why not?

702
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,541
Yes, aliens are real.

703
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,166
I knew I'd like this guy.
Didn't I tell? You owe me 50 bucks.

704
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,000
[Mindy] I'm not saying there's
little green men in flying saucers...

705
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,208
- Please don't encourage him, Dr. Mindy.
- That's what he's saying.

706
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,708
We'll never get out of here.

707
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,541
Now, Jack was having some fun here.

708
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,166
- Dad looks great.
- What did…

709
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,583
- Doesn't he look good?
- They did something with his beard.

710
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,583
[Brie] With the aliens…

711
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:41,458
[chuckling] Really… He really does.

712
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:43,625
- [Jack] So much.
- [Brie chuckles] Dr. Randall…

713
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:47,125
You'll regret it. Now, look,
Jack's just having some fun here

714
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,875
with the aliens or whatever,

715
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:53,250
but there's a <i>New York Herald</i> story
that's just come out that talks about…

716
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,375
Keep it right there. You're doing good.

717
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:57,833
- …the two of you have made.
- [Mindy] That's right, Brie.

718
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:00,958
Kate was, um, observing supernovas…

719
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,583
Yo, that's your girl?

720
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:05,083
- Yeah.
- Not bad.

721
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:09,625
…an absolutely shocking
and once-in-a-lifetime discovery.

722
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:13,000
I had no idea that Subaru made telescopes.

723
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,166
This has to be exciting.
Tell us what you found, Miss Diabasky.

724
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,250
Um, I was monitoring exploding stars

725
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:26,750
to help measure
the expansion of the universe and...

726
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,875
- For your PhD, right?
- Yeah.

727
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:33,125
[Kate] I saw something I didn't recognize.

728
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,041
<i>It was a comet.</i>

729
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:36,958
[sighs]

730
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,166
[Kate] <i>A big one.</i>

731
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:44,583
It's headed directly at Earth,
and it really likely will hit.

732
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:47,791
This sounds very, very exciting.

733
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,458
Exploding stars, like,
stars actually explode.

734
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,708
Um, how big is this thing?

735
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:54,083
Can it destroy someone's house?
Is that possible?

736
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,333
Well, Comet Dibiasky, which is
what it will officially be named...

737
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:58,833
- [Jack] After her?
- Yeah, after her.

738
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,583
- [Brie] Congratulations.
- [Jack] What an honor. Congratulations.

739
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:04,166
It's somewhere between
six and nine kilometers across.

740
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,583
- So...
- It's big.

741
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:08,875
It would damage the entire planet.

742
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,583
Not just a house, you know?

743
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,708
The entire planet.

744
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:14,708
Okay, as it's damaging,
will it hit this one house in particular

745
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:17,875
that's right on the coast of New Jersey?
It's my ex-wife's house.

746
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,208
Can we make that happen?

747
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,708
You and Shelly have
a great relationship. Stop.

748
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,125
You need to stop.

749
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:26,125
I will, but in all fairness,
I actually paid for the house.

750
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,500
[Brie] I'm so sorry.

751
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,583
I'm sorry, are we not being clear?

752
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:33,791
We're trying to tell you

753
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:37,291
that the entire planet
is about to be destroyed.

754
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,291
- [Jack] Okay, um…
- [Brie] Well, it's, you know…

755
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:43,625
It's something we do around here.
We just keep the bad news light.

756
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,625
Right. It helps the medicine go down.

757
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,666
Speaking of medicine, tomorrow we've got...

758
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,541
Well, maybe the destruction
of the entire planet

759
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,833
isn't supposed to be fun.

760
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,250
Maybe it's supposed to be terrifying.

761
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,333
<i>And unsettling.</i>

762
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,125
[Adul] No, please don't do that.

763
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,333
<i>- And you should stay up all night…</i>
- [Adul] Please.

764
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,250
…every night crying,

765
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:09,750
when we're all 100%
for sure gonna fucking die!

766
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,416
- [crying]
- Hey, Kate.

767
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
[Kate] <i>I'm sorry.</i>

768
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:15,708
Hey, man.

769
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,708
My brother has bipolar disorder.
So if you ever need anyone to talk…

770
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,583
- Uh… [inhales sharply]
- Okay.

771
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,583
Is she always like that?

772
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,083
- I...
- [Brie] Something I said?

773
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,083
- [Jack and Brie chuckle]
- [Jack] Right?

774
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:33,625
Maybe I should have given her
that extra Xanax that I had.

775
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:34,708
[Jack and Brie chuckle]

776
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:38,208
Listen, if you don't have enough,
we all have enough around here for her.

777
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:41,166
A spoonful of Xanax
makes the medicine go down, right?

778
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,916
[Jack] That's right. That's good.

779
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:47,166
- We're gonna have to get you back.
- [Jack] I knew I'd like this guy.

780
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,333
- Is he a plant? [laughing]
- [Jack] I knew it.

781
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,333
[Brie] Okay.

782
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,791
Well, the handsome astronomer

783
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:56,375
can come back anytime,
but the yelling lady, not so much.

784
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:59,416
[Jack] Not so much. Join us tomorrow
when our guest will be the man

785
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,083
that many say will challenge
President Orlean in two years.

786
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,166
Senator Jeff Lerner will be here.

787
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,000
And wrongly-convicted murderer,
Michelle Weems,

788
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:12,375
talks to us about her controversial
third-place finish on <i>Celebrity Dance Off.</i>

789
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,833
- I thought she would've won.
- Yes. I still think she's guilty.

790
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:18,083
- That's <i>The Daily Rip,</i> guys.
- [Brie] Have a great day.

791
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,583
- [producer] And we're out!
- The show's over?

792
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:21,958
- I mean, didn't…
- [Jack] Yeah.

793
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,500
- Did what we wanted to say come across?
- No, it's over.

794
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:28,500
You were great, but I think mullet girl,
she probably needs some media training.

795
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,291
- Really?
- Yeah, no, terrible, buddy.

796
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,916
[Brie] Oh… Thanks. Thanks, Billy.

797
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,500
Uh, we usually get drinks at Aundrine's
after our five o'clock staff meeting.

798
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:42,041
You know, it's fun. You should come.

799
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:45,041
Oh, I'll have to see.
Thank you for the invitation. Thank you.

800
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:46,583
Mmm-hmm.

801
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,291
Kate? Kate?

802
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,250
- Hey. You were awesome.
- Oh, thanks.

803
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,291
Can I get a photo of you for my portfolio?

804
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,666
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

805
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,083
- [camera clicks]
- Thank you.

806
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:59,166
[woman] You can see this spike here

807
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,375
is when Riley Bina
asked to take DJ Chello back

808
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,750
on the segment before you.

809
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:06,041
We saw engagement across
all social media platforms.

810
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,916
Hmm. And what about our story?

811
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,958
[woman] Randall and Kate,

812
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,750
{\an8}your TV appearance got some nice traffic
when Miss Dibiasky cursed.

813
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,041
{\an8}But, unfortunately,
there was an immediate backlash

814
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,833
{\an8}- that quickly became a meme.
- [Kate gasps]

815
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,208
Oh, Jesus.

816
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:26,250
- Oh, that's terrible.
- They just think I'm crazy.

817
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:29,333
I mean, look at that.
That's so unnecessary.

818
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:33,125
- You can move on, Erin.
- Yeah.

819
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,916
That is just so…
Is that even allowed on the Internet or…

820
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,625
I think that's Photoshop, Kate.

821
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:40,083
[Erin] The trick is
to not take it personal…

822
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:44,458
[chuckling] Dr. Mindy, on the other hand,
had some very high favorables.

823
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:49,125
Vegan♪Babe wrote,
"Meow! Me likey hunky Star Man."

824
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,208
Uh, some accounts called him
"The Bedroom Eyes Doomsday Prophet"

825
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:55,083
or A-I-L-F, which means
"astronomer I'd like to fuck."

826
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,041
[people] Oh…

827
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,666
I don't see what that has
to do with anything, do you?

828
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:02,500
And that's everything.

829
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,666
We did not feature or push on any sites,

830
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,083
and clicks overall were below
basic weather and traffic stories.

831
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:10,416
[scoffs]

832
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
So that… That… That's it?

833
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,333
- [Kate] I knew it.
- That's it.

834
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,833
- Thank you, Erin.
- [Erin] Yeah, no problem.

835
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,750
[Mindy] I don't… I don't understand.

836
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,666
I don't understand. There's no response.

837
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:27,375
There's absolutely no…
Why aren't people terrified?

838
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:29,458
What do we have to say?
What do we have to do?

839
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,916
There are scientists in Mexico and Spain
who are currently going through the data,

840
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,708
and, uh, South Korea has expressed...

841
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:36,500
- That's great. South Korea.
- Hey.

842
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:39,041
Let us not bullshit each other.

843
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:42,791
The bottom line is,
you guys told us the science was 100%.

844
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,625
It's not. Now we look like idiots.

845
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,291
- No. Who said the science is not 100%?
- Excuse me?

846
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,250
I wanna talk to this person.
You tell me who said the science...

847
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,333
Dr. Jocelyn Calder, the head of NASA,

848
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:56,625
just came out calling it
"more near-miss hysteria."

849
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:58,625
She's the one
who told us not to say anything.

850
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,083
"More near-miss hysteria."

851
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:01,291
Is she even an astronomer?

852
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:04,458
She's the head of NASA, but maybe
she doesn't know what she's talking about.

853
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,958
She's the head of NASA, but look,

854
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,875
she's a "former anesthesiologist
and a President Orlean super donor."

855
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:11,583
Let's not be dramatic here.

856
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:12,666
It's all corrupt.

857
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,416
Yes, but the point is that Adul's right.
There's still serious debate.

858
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,708
And now the <i>Herald</i> has egg on its face.

859
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,916
We've taken that story as far as it goes.

860
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:25,625
Ladies, gentlemen,
I wish you a very pleasant end of times.

861
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:27,708
[Mindy] It's not a goddamn story, okay?

862
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,916
We have precisely six months, ten days,

863
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,250
two hours, 11 minutes and 41 seconds,

864
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:39,000
until a comet twice the size of Chicxulub

865
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:41,833
tears through our atmosphere
and extincts all life on Earth.

866
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,833
[chuckles] When did you
do those calculations?

867
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,250
I put the moment of impact on a diet app.

868
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:51,958
So, impact is when my diet ends.

869
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:56,125
Only I'm not on a diet.
I'm just crying five times a day.

870
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,125
- I'm scared.
- Hey, come on. Come on.

871
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,416
Everyone should be
panicking right now, okay?

872
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,416
- Don't cry. Come on.
- [Kate] I know.

873
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,750
[cell phone chimes]

874
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:05,833
[sighs]

875
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,291
That prick!

876
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:09,791
[upbeat tense music playing]

877
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,666
[Mindy] What happened?

878
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,083
Guess my boyfriend just broke up with me.

879
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:24,500
- God, what a day. What a day…
- [crying]

880
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:35,958
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die! You're…

881
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,125
[slow rumbling]

882
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,708
[reporter on TV] <i>It started with</i>
<i>a photo many thought was an armpit</i>

883
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,458

884
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,833

885
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:57,833
{\an8}<i>President Orlean sent

886
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:00,583
{\an8}<i>a cell phone picture of her private parts.</i>

887
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:02,708
<i>- Holy crap!</i>
- [woman] <i>It's clickbait material.</i>

888
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:05,250
<i>Is this what you want
in your country as a leader?</i>

889
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,708
<i>Isn't she the same person
who told poor people</i>

890
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:11,833
<i>that if they don't wanna be poor,
they should pick better lottery numbers?</i>

891
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:12,958
<i>She actually said that.</i>

892
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,541
{\an8}<i>A source also confirmed to me that</i>

893
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:16,750

00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,583

<i>Janie Orlean…</i>

898

[Mindy] Oh, my God, honey.

899
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,791
This guy doesn't even know
what a heliocentric orbit is,

900
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,625
and he's calling me a crackpot. [chuckles]

901
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:33,708
He says that,

902
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:38,166
"Jewish billionaires
invented this comet threat

903
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,125
so the government
can confiscate our liberty and our guns."

904
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,500
"#DontBeScared." Unbelievable.

905
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:47,041
My God.

906
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:49,041
You've been on that site a lot lately.

907
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:54,833
Yeah. I mean, I… I have, like,
a quarter million subscribers, honey.

908
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:57,875
I gotta use my voice
to get the truth out there, right?

909
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,916
I'm, uh, going for a walk
if you wanna come.

910
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:07,750
[Mindy] It is called
the scientific method…

911
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:08,666
[doorbell rings]

912
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,666
…and it is what created the computer

913
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:16,666
that you are typing
your half-witted conspiracy theories on.

914
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,708
What do you think about that?

915
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,958
[Mrs. Mindy] Randall?

916
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,250
- Yeah, honey?
- Someone's here to see you.

917
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:28,083
Who? Oh, boy.

918
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:32,500
Oh, my gosh.

919
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:35,458
Oh, God, right. Okay.

920
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,375
Right.

921
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:39,166
Are you Dr. Randall Mindy?

922
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,416
[Mindy] <i>Yes, sir. I am.</i>

923
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,708
[pensive music playing]

00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,708
Fuck off, please.

00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,958
FBI! Freeze! Get on your knees right now!
Get on your knees!

927
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:55,500
You're under arrest
for breach of national security secrets.

928
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:56,458
Jesus Christ!

929
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:00,125
You could've just called me
or showed up to my apartment.

930
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:03,208
What are you, dressed up as a blind guy?

931
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:05,583
[siren blaring]

932
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:08,583
- [agent] Get on the ground!
- Okay. Now be cool.

933
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,083
I just have
more skin pigmentation than you.

934
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,083
'Cause your ancestors
migrated to Northern Europe

935
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,250
and developed lighter skin
so as to not get…

936
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,958
[Kate] Unless you assholes
are taking me to the Batcave,

937
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:24,791
fuck you for putting this hood on me.

938
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,541
Watch out for him.
He'll charge you for free shit.

939
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,583
[whispers] What's he doing here?
Is he here for us?

940
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,625
Gentlemen, you can come in.

941
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,541
[Orlean chuckles] I think
it was Winston Churchill who…

942
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:47,500
Or maybe it was Bobby Knight
who said, "The great labor of leadership

943
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:51,083
is to lay down one's yoke of pride

944
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,791
and admit that mistakes were made."

945
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:58,041
[Jason] You were deceived,
as was I, but the end result was,

946
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:01,791
we had our scientists who went to,
uh, the prestigious schools of Harvard,

947
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,000
Princeton, et cetera.

948
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,416
They confirmed the data.
So we would like to offer you a…

949
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,000
Presidential apology.

950
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,000
Really?

951
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,625
And we are fully prepared to mobilize

952
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:19,583
in historic fashion
in order to save this planet.

953
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,583
[laughing]

954
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:23,875
[man] The best news
we've heard in a long time.

955
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:27,541
So, basically, what you're saying is

956
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:31,458
you're about to lose the midterms
'cause you got caught

957
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:35,625
sending pictures of your cooch
to your porn-star sheriff boyfriend.

958
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:39,625
So now it's to your advantage
to act on the comet?

959
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:42,708
Right.

960
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:44,041
[Kate] Okay.

961
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:46,000
[chuckling] Okay. I'm just…

962
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:51,041
[sighs] God, I'm so relieved
that you guys are doing something.

963
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:54,708
- Hey, come on. Hey.
- This has been really…

964
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,958
- [crying] Really, really hard.
- Come here.

965
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:00,166
This has been really, really,
really stressful on all of us.

966
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,291
Yes, I will agree.

967
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,583
This will take some
heavy weight off all of us...

968
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:06,583
[laughing] Sorry, you just look
so bad when you cry.

969
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:08,458
[Orlean] Maybe, possibly.

970
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,458
People are gonna ask
why we didn't act earlier.

971
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,958
So you're gonna have
to take the hit on this one.

972
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:16,083
Yeah, but we'll take care
of you down the road, Jocelyn.

973
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,375
- We will.
- Of course, Janie.

974
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,500
I will resign in disgrace
first thing tomorrow.

975
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:24,291
- [Orlean] Good. Yeah, good.
- That's weird as hell.

976
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:26,458
[whispers] She's an anesthesiologist.

977
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:29,541
I'm going to make a statement,

978
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:32,166
presidential statement
to the American people.

979
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,041
And we're not gonna tell
the press about it ahead of time

980
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:37,916
because that way
it will have the appearance

981
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,666
of a breaking emergency sort of…

982
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,166

<i>come to those who wait.</i>

00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,666
{\an8}<i>So we have…</i>

997
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,958
We've drawn up a massive
Congressional spending bill…

998
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:31,791
I have already put together an emergency
spending package for Congress…

999
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:34,083
[Jason] …that the Senate
and the House have agreed upon.

1000
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,000
That's good to hear.

1001
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:39,166
<i>And that will enable NASA
and our great military</i>

1002
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,083
<i>to launch a preemptive strike,</i>

1003
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:46,250
using decommissioned
space shuttles and satellites

1004
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:49,041
loaded with nuclear explosives.

1005
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:53,333
We will blow Comet Dibiasky
off her course…

1006
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,458
But we're gonna need a hero.

1007
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:58,791
We're gonna need a pilot, real guns and…

1008
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:02,250
Shouldn't this mission be accomplished
using remote technology?

1009
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,541
Washington's always gotta have a hero.

1010
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,000
I have asked

1011
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Medal of Freedom recipient
and outspoken patriot, Benedict Drask,

1012
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:16,250
<i>to undertake this difficult and…</i>

1013
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,958
[Mindy] I'm sorry.
Isn't he the mercenary gentleman

1014
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:22,416
that was screaming at all those children
on the White House lawn?

1015
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,916
[Orlean] Yeah.
He was given the honor of leading

1016
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,333
the presidential initiative
in getting kids to exercise.

1017
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,250
Get a little air into it, you lard-ass…

1018
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,333
You look like a goddamn bunch of pussies.

1019
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:36,666
- [Mindy] I'm sorry.
- He's just of another generation.

1020
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,083
You know, I used to date him.

1021
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:41,375
Know what happened to the last pussy
I worked with in combat?

1022
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,250
You ever see inside a man's torso?

1023

<i>- Thank you for the…</i>
- He's gonna be fantastic.

1026
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,458
{\an8}He's got a great voice.

1027
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:58,166
{\an8}- We're gonna let him make a statement.
<i>- Some are saying this is a…</i>

1028
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,625
He's got a great body too.

00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:01,250
- [Calder] <i>He does.</i>
- [Orlean] <i>Yeah.</i>

1031
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:04,458
Well, all I ask is,

1032
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:06,875
if I get snuffed,

1033
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:11,458
that you all earn
the extra living my sacrifice gives you.

1034
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:14,000
The extra living
my sacrifice gives them. [gasps]

1035
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,500
{\an8}- Right?
- I wrote that.

1036
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:18,708
Isn't that from <i>Saving Private Ryan?</i>

1037
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:21,708
- Yes.
- No, that's something totally different.

1038
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:25,500
And special thanks should also go
to this team of scientists behind me…

1039
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:28,250
[Orlean] <i>We're gonna need</i>
<i>everybody's help on this.</i>

1040
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,208
Everybody.

1041
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,916
All have to pitch in
and push out this message.

1042

1045
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,458

and the mentally ill.

1047
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,125
- And other marginal groups.
- Thank you.

1048
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:51,500
- [Oglethorpe] We'll do whatever we can.
- As long as you do the right thing.

1049
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:52,916
We're there for you.

1050
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,250
Especially you, Dr. Mindy,
because you poll so much higher

1051
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,666
than your colleagues.
It's wild. [laughing]

1052

He will help us destroy
our common enemy, Dibiasky.

1053
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,041
Wonderful. Well, I think we're done.

1054
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:08,666
[Jason] Yep, okay. Let's go.

1055
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,291
[Kate] Can I say something?

1056
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,583
We've been dying to hear
what you gotta say.

1057
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,375
I didn't vote for you.

1058
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:22,708
But this is obviously
much bigger than my misgivings.

1059
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:27,125
So I will be 100% behind this effort.

1060
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,791
No matter how offensive I may find you.

1061
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:34,375
Hmm. Wow. That's great.

1062
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,291
[Jason] Yeah. That's really nice.

1063
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:39,208
You know, I did have the FBI
put that bag over your head.

1064
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:42,291
They don't do that.
The CIA does, but I made them do it.

1065
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,083
You know, I had a feeling. I really did.

1066
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:48,416
It's a good feeling
'cause that is what I did.

1067
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,291
- And it was very funny and cool. [laughs]
- [Orlean] Okay.

1311
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:19,750
are fast becoming those that are deployed

1312

of cell phones and, uh, computers.

1313

1315
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:31,916
Uh, and the problem
is exacerbated, of course,

1316
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,916
because China has her big panda paw
firmly on almost all the mines

1317
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,500
that produce
these valuable rare Earth assets.

1318

1322

and then determined that this comet,
hurtling towards us from deep space,

1323
01:09:57,083 --> 01:10:02,833
actually contains at least $32 trillion
of these critical materials.

01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:05,958
If we're to proceed...

1326
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:08,541
I'm sorry. Is that why
you aborted this entire mission,

1327
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,541
is because you're trying to mine
the comet for rare minerals?

1328
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,708
[Orlean] I think
we should hold all questions

1329
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:16,458
until the end of the presentation,

1330
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:20,125
and you might find
that your questions are answered.

1331
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:21,750
Yes, Madam President.

1332
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:24,875
When you…
When the other metals are factored in,

1333
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:27,333
the comet actually contains

1334
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:31,541
almost $140 trillion worth of assets.

1335
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:32,916
[Jason] Buck-forty trilli.

1336
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,291
- [Orlean] Yeah…
- [laughter]

1337
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:40,000
What do these trillions of dollars
even matter if we're all gonna die...

1338
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,458
[woman] I was about to ask
the same question, Janie.

1339
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,666
Why weren't we consulted?

1340
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,250
All due respect, Madam President…

1341
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:47,833
Oh, no! What if we're rich and we're safe?

1342
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,125
[Kate] I've gone over it
again and again and again in my head

1343
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,791
and I still can't make sense of it.

1344
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:03,791
He's a three-star general.
He works at the Pentagon.

1345
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:09,000
Why would he charge us for free snacks?

1346
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:12,750
One time, I met Sting,

1347
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:18,291
and I swear to God,
he farted right in front of me.

1348
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:24,458
Didn't break eye contact
and didn't even say "excuse me."

1349
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,083
And the thing is,
he actually pulled it off. [chuckles]

1350
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,875
'Cause I still found him
to be quite charming.

1351
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:40,333
[whispering] Guys, we have to talk.
Come on, let's go. Come on, now.

1352
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:44,625
It's insane. Like, completely insane.

1353
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,041
[Kate] It will never work.

1354
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:48,291
I had the exact same reaction.

1355
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:51,500
This is a nine-kilometer-wide
planet-killer we're talking about,

1356
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,041
not roaming charges.

1357
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:59,041
Look, I… I was confused and outraged
that they turned this mission around too,

1358
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:01,708
but they've got
Gary Talcamont from Stanford

1359
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,958
and Lisa Inez from Princeton
on their team.

1360
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:07,750
I mean, this is next-generation
cutting-edge technology.

1361
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:14,625
Obviously, one giant comet is a major
and existential, uh, threat to our planet,

1362
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:20,000
but 30 smaller meteoroids, we can handle.

1363
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:26,625
Our BEADS, that stands for
BASH, uh, Explore and Acquire Drones,

1364
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:28,083
that you see here,

1365
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:30,833
attach themselves to the comet

1366
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:33,375
and scan it with nanotechnology

1367
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:36,583
developed by
Nobel Prize-winning scientist,

1368
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:37,666
Dr. Gary Talcamont.

1369
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:40,500
And then we immediately deploy, don't we?

1370
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,833
Nobel and Polonsky prize-winning scientist

1371
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:48,250
Dr. Inez's micro-targeted,
quantum fission, uh, explosives.

1372
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:51,625
You see, deep into the object…

1373
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:54,458
Dr. Inez, would you like
to explain what's happening?

1374
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,416
Thank you, Peter.

1375
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,250
We've been developing
phase-fission reactions

1376
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,375
in the CERN particle accelerator

1377
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:03,125
that can splinter the comet
into smaller pieces

1378
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:05,333
with breathtaking accuracy.

1379
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:08,791
These segments are then steered
and decelerated by each BEAD

1380
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:13,625
into the Pacific Ocean for reclamation
by waiting US Navy ships.

1381
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:15,666
And when these… Thank you.

1382
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:19,875
And when these treasures
from heaven are claimed,

1383
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:23,916
poverty as we know it,
social injustice, loss of biodiversity,

1384
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,708
all these multitudes of problems

1385
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:30,125
are just gonna become relics of the past

1386
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:35,625
and humanity is gonna stride through
the Pillars of Boaz and Jachin naked

1387
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,250
into the the glory of a golden age…

1388
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:41,500
And is this nanotech work peer-reviewed?

1389
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,166
Well, I haven't reviewed the data,
but it's been modeled.

1390
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:47,125
Has any of this been peer-reviewed?

1391
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,833
Nope.

1392
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:51,250
Interplanetary, interstellar,

1393
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:56,125
intergalactic existence
for the human race.

1394
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:57,583
[applause]

1395
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:00,916
[Orlean] Your mouth to God's ear.

1396
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:05,041
I understand the wealth
that they can extract from this comet,

1397
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:06,291
it can end world hunger.

1398
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,166
- [Oglethorpe] Oh, I see.
- [Kate laughing]

1399
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,833
- Why are you laughing?
- [Oglethorpe] That's true. No, I see.

1400
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:15,333
So that's the pretty little bow they're
putting around this line of bullshit.

1401
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:17,250
I bet they'll say freedom and puppies too.

1402
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:18,166
- All right.
- Yeah.

1403
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,916
You want me to quit the mission?
I'll quit the mission. That's fine.

1404
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,708
But you have to understand,
this is now beyond our control.

1405
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:27,208
They have all the power.

1406
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:29,958
So who do you want
in the actual room to make sure

1407
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:33,000
this whole thing doesn't turn out to be
a complete goddamn disaster?

1408
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:35,708
Jason Orlean?
You want Jason Orlean in that room? Huh?

1409
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:40,125
I have news for you.
It's already a complete disaster.

1410
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:43,750
They're talking about letting
a comet the size of a mountain

1411
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:46,625
hit the planet to jack up
a cell phone company's stock!

1412
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:49,916
You better take that down
about four or five notches now.

1413
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,625
Were you yelling about that mission?
Why were you talking about cell phones?

1414
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:56,750
My friend was just theorizing
as to what's going on.

1415
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,291
We're confused too.

1416
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:01,458
That's an awfully official-looking
White House badge you got there.

1417
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:03,291
I don't know why I have this on.

1418
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,125
Listen, just tell us what's going on.

1419
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:07,625
I got three scared kids at home.
Just tell us something.

1420
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,333
I understand.
I wish I could share information, but...

1421
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:12,958
We're people just like you.
We deserve to know!

1422
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:13,916
They're right.

1423
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:16,083
They deserve to know.

1424
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,833
Do you really wanna know what's going on?

1425
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:20,041
- [woman] Yeah.
- [man] Please.

1426
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:22,583
- [Oglethorpe] Kate, don't. Kate.
- [Mindy] Kate.

1427
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:28,958
They found a bunch of gold and diamonds
and rare shit on the comet.

1428
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:29,875
[sighs]

1429
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,166
So they're gonna let it hit the planet

1430
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:36,416
to make a bunch of rich people
even more disgustingly rich!

1431
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:44,000
[woman] Fuck you!

1432
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:46,083
[people clamoring]

1433
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,250
[people shouting and screaming]

1434
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,500
[officer] No camera!

1435
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,541
…everything I could, they won't listen.

1436
01:15:58,625 --> 01:15:59,958
[Kate] Surprise, surprise.

1437
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:02,916
Now, I'm starting to think
you just like riling people up.

1438
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,958
I'm so sorry, Kate. Really, I am.

1439
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:07,041
[Kate] Oh, Randall. God.

1440
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:09,875
Where's Brie Evantee?

1441
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:12,375
Shouldn't you two
be playing footsie in a restaurant

1442
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,583
that only serves cubes and foam?

1443
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:18,083
Well, she ain't wrong.
You did lose the thread in a big way.

1444
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:21,375
And what do you suggest we do?
An online petition, huh?

1445
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:24,416
You want to hold…
Get a mob and hold up picket signs?

1446
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,958
You wanna overthrow the government?
I mean, look at this.

1447
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,875
[Kate] I can't! My head is in a bag!

1448
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:31,583
[agent] Sorry, Dr. Mindy.
White House wants her off the grid.

1449
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:33,166
- Come on, now. Look...
- [agent] Now.

1450
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,958
[Kate] Wait. What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

1451
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:38,416
- What does "off the grid" mean?
- [Mindy] Hey, Kate.

1452
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:42,416
Oh, gosh. Kate! Are you okay?

1453
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,458
[people shouting indistinctly]

1454
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:48,833
Teddy, come on!
What choice do I have here?

1455
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:53,541
A man's always got choices, Randall!

1456
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:56,458
Sometimes you just gotta
choose the good one!

1457
01:16:56,541 --> 01:16:57,791
[dog barking]

1458
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:00,041
[uneasy music playing]

1459
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:04,708
[man] Miss Katelyn Dibiasky,

1460
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:08,208
the charges against you are
violation of national security secrets,

1461
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,083
inciting a riot,
and destruction of private property

1462
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:13,666
owned by Bojo Mambo's Shrimp LLC.

1463
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,583
What? I didn't...

1464
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:17,583
However, the Attorney General
is willing to not pursue prosecution

1465
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,208
if you will agree to the following:

1466
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:21,958
"The suspension
of all public media appearances

1467
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:26,708
and incendiary language relating to
Comet Dibiasky and BASH Cellular."

1468
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:32,333
Fine. Give it to me.
I don't give a shit anymore.

1469
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:49,416
Mom. Dad.

1470
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:52,166
[sniffles] I'm so glad to be home.

1471
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:55,875
Unlock the door.

1472
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,750
No politics. None.

1473
01:17:58,208 --> 01:17:59,583
What are you talking about?

1474
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:02,791
Your dad and I are for the jobs
the comet will provide.

1475
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:05,041
[Kate scoffs]

1476
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:07,916
The divisions in this country
are bad enough.

1477
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:10,458
We don't want more of that in our house.

1478
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:14,208
- [serene music playing on TV]
- [laughing] <i>Whoa!</i>

1479
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:16,125
<i>- Slow down, kids.</i>
- [boy] <i>Sorry, Mom.</i>

1480
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:19,333
<i>I worry about my kids and their future.</i>

1481
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:22,500
<i>Sure, the jobs
the comet's gonna create sound great.</i>

1482
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:24,291
<i>What if it's not safe?</i>

1483
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:29,250
{\an8}<i>Right now, millions of you are having
these same doubts and questions</i>

1484
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:31,208
{\an8}<i>about the approaching comet.</i>

1485
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,708
{\an8}<i>That is why BASH Cellular</i>

1486
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,166
<i>in conjunction with
the United States Government</i>

1487
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:40,041
<i>is creating a new hotline, free of charge,

[Brie laughing] So, I thought he was
the ambassador. I was just flattering him.

1496
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,541
[chuckling] Well, he was a waiter.
Now he's got an ego the size of Texas.

1497
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:18,125
Oh, my God.

1498
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:22,875
June, what, uh…
What are you doing here, sweetie?

1499
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:27,458
Had a feeling
something was going on and just…

1500
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:31,958
[Mindy] Well, you know,
we're discussing important business.

1501
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:35,458
- That's what we're doing.
- Oh, yeah, that's really very important.

1502
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:37,750
Oh, can we just
skip past this part, please?

1503
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:39,500
Where you get to feel self-righteous

1504
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:43,041
and we put our tails between our legs.
It is just so boring.

1505
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:44,791
[sarcastically] Oh, it's "so boring"?

1506
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:49,291
You wanna skip the part where
you feel bad for screwing my husband?

1507
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:52,583
Oh… No, I don't feel bad.

1508
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:56,416
Randall and I are having a wonderful time.
So, I think the question is,

1509
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:01,791
do we keep having a wonderful time
or does he go back with you to Wisconsin?

1510
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:02,750
Or Montana.

1511
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,875
- Michigan?
- Michigan.

1512
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:08,041
[hesitates]

1513
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:12,500
You know, um… she is actually right.

1514
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:16,333
That's the only question. So…

1515
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:20,750
[Mindy] Well, June, sweetie…

1516
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:23,875
[breathing heavily]
Sometimes in life things are, you know,

1517
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:26,458
they're complicated and they just...

1518
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:27,666
[Mrs. Mindy] Oh, okay.

1519
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,666
Oh, that was fast, um…

1520
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:33,791
[clicks tongue]

1521
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:38,375
Well, before I go, um,

1522
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:41,375
let me just give you some instructions

1523
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:45,458
on how to take care of Randall.

1524
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:47,041
Uh…

1525
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:50,541
Yeah, here's the Xanax
he takes for his panic attacks.

1526
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:51,458
Oh, gosh.

1527
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:54,458
Here's the Zoloft he takes
for the crashing depressions.

1528
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:58,250
- Not so much recently. Okay, you know...
- Oh! Oh, good for you. Great.

1529
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:02,000
- Uh, this is for his blood pressure.
- Ow.

1530
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:04,708
- Restless leg syndrome, that's a fun one.
- God.

1531
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:10,875
Oh. Appetite suppressant to counteract
the weight gain from his other meds.

1532
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:15,875
And, uh, for America's sexiest scientist,
a bottle of goddamn Cialis!

1533
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:17,375
Ow! Gosh.

1534
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,041
Goodbye. Goodbye, Randall.

1535
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:29,916
I guess I'll just tell your sons

1536
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,375

June, I…

1538
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,458
I really thought for a second
that was gonna work out.

<i>Thirty-seven percent

1542
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:47,583
<i>That's actually down by three points.</i>

1543
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:50,791
<i>And 23%, they don't think
there's a comet at all,</i>

1544
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,666

1549

What the fuck?

1552
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:23,041
- Yeah, that's you. It's definitely you.
- Yep, that's me.

1553
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:26,833
Holy shit. You're a stone-cold legend.
Word is bond.

1554
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:29,583
I got a picture of you on my board.

1555
01:22:29,666 --> 01:22:31,041
Picture on his fucking board.

1556
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:33,125
[Kate] That's great. What's your purchase?

1557
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:36,416
If you don't have one, get out of line
and make room for other customers.

1558
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,791
Can I touch your hair in a non-sexual way?

1559
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,541
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Oh, dude, have some… Um…

Will you say hi to my friend?

1561
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:47,750
Dude, he's obsessed with you.
We love you. We don't like…

1562

No. You're free to go.

Well, we don't give a shit either.

1583

Not one single shit.

1584
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:40,291
We hang and board behind the abandoned
Burger Crown from 7:00 to whenever.

1585
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:41,208
Yeah, we do.

1586
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:43,750
You should come hang.
If you're not a fucking pussy.

BASH Explore and Acquire Drone.

1593
01:24:16,416 --> 01:24:17,500
It's incredible.

It's incredible, isn't it?

1595
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:22,833
I call this one Primo,
the first. [laughing]

1596

It's like my first child.

1597

Primo, my boy.
It's your father, Cronos. [laughing]

1598

Don't be shy. Come on.
You're gonna be a god in the sky.

[laughter]

1600
01:24:41,416 --> 01:24:46,583
Are you at all concerned about
the sync on the BEAD explosions?

1601
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:50,583
Oh, Doctor.
There are always questions and fears, and…

1602
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:54,500
I have a report here from a Dr. Inez.

1603
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:57,041
- If you'd just take a look at this study.
- Oh, thanks.

1604
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,333
Listen, a lot of my colleagues,

1605
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:01,875
they've either been removed
or resigned from this project,

1606
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:06,083
apparently for asking too many questions
about this mission here.

1607
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:08,750
So I just wanna make sure that you're…

1608
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:11,875
That you're open
to the scientific peer-review process

1609
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,583
and you're not approaching
this mission like a businessman.

1610
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:16,416
- You know? That...
- What did you say?

1611
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:20,208
- I wanna know if you're...
- Did you call me a businessman?

1612
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:23,916
- You do own a corporate...
- You think I'm just a businessman?

1613
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,791
Do you think you know me, Doctor?

1614
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:30,291
Business?

1615
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:35,125
This is evolution.
This is evolution of the human species.

1616
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:38,125
- What are you doing bringing this…
- [Orlean] Well...

1617
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:41,375
You know that BASH has
over 40 million data points on you,

1618
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:45,458
on every decision you have made
since 1994, Doctor?

1619
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:50,041
I… I know when you have colon polyps

1620
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,833
months before your doctor does.

1621
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,750
You got four or five
at the moment actually.

1622
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:57,375
You know, they're not of concern,
but I'd have a checkup as soon as you can.

1623
01:25:57,458 --> 01:26:01,916
But much more importantly than that,
I know what <i>you</i> are. I know who you are.

1624
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
My algorithms have determined
eight fundamental consumer profile types.

1625
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:10,791
You are a lifestyle idealist.

1626
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:15,125
You think you're motivated
by beliefs, high ethical beliefs.

1627
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:20,125
But you just run towards pleasure
and away from pain.

1628
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:25,000
Like a… Like a field mouse.

1629

[inhales deeply]

1631
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:32,875
I just wanna make sure
that the science is sound on this project.

1632
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:34,041
I hope you understand...

1633
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:38,250
Our algorithms
can even predict how you'll die.

1634
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:44,375
To 96… 96.5% accuracy.

1635
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:46,333
I looked you up after we met.

1636
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:52,000
Your death was so unremarkable and boring.

1637
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:56,750
I can't remember the details,
apart from one thing.

1638
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,750
You're gonna die alone.

1639
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:04,791
Alone.

1640
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:09,958

I've got some work to do.

that there is no comet,

a good thing or maybe it's a bad thing.

So, could you please help us out here,
you know, oh, wise scientist?

1693
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:45,416
Well, first and foremost, Brie, um…

1694
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,833
[sniffs] …there most certainly
is a comet.

1695
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:48,791
[Brie] All right.

1696
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:52,125
And we know that there is a comet
because we have the data.

1697
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:54,416
Um… [clears throat]

1698
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:58,666
There has been growing concern within
the scientific community as of late.

1699
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:02,875
You see, the peer-review process
is absolutely essential…

1700
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:05,583
- If BASH's stock…
- …for us to get to the facts of… Yes?

1701
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:07,333
If BASH's stock is any indicator,

1702
01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:09,333
we don't have to worry
about the peer review.

1703
01:30:09,416 --> 01:30:10,583
It is going gangbusters.

1704
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:13,125
And full disclosure.
I bought as many shares as I could.

1705
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,500

1713
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:33,291
No, Please, Brie. Don't cut away.
Let me say something.

1714
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:34,916
- Okay.
- You came to the right place.

1715
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,375
We like to say things.

Would you please

I'm sorry, but not everything
needs to sound so goddamn clever

1718

or charming or likeable all the time.

1719
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:50,583
Sometimes we need to just be able
to say things to one another.

1720
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:52,083
We need to hear things.

1721
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:57,125
Look, let's establish, once again,

1722
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:01,916
that there is a huge comet
headed towards Earth.

1723
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:05,291
And the reason we know
that there is a comet

1724
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:06,833
is because we saw it.

1725
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:10,208
We saw it with our own eyes
using a telescope.

1726
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:13,500
I mean, for God's sake,
we took a fucking picture of it!

1727
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:15,291
What other proof do we need?

1728
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:18,375
And if we can't all agree
at the bare minimum

1729
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:22,875
that a giant comet
the size of Mount Everest

1730
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:29,041
hurtling its way towards planet Earth
is not a fucking good thing,

1731
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:32,125
then what the hell happened to us?

1732
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,333
I mean, my God, how do...
How do we even talk to each other?

1733
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:41,208
What've we… What've we done to ourselves?
How do we fix it?

1734
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:44,791
We should have deflected this comet
when we had the fucking chance,

1735
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:48,083
but we didn't do it.
I don't know why we didn't do it.

1736
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:51,958
And now they're
actually firing scientists like me

1737
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:54,666
for speaking out, for opposing them.

1738
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:57,875
And I'm sure many of the people out there

1739
01:31:57,958 --> 01:31:59,958
aren't even
gonna listen to what I just said

1740
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:02,833
'cause they have
their own political ideology,

1741
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,916

1742

1745
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:15,250
that Isherwell and the president
have both said

1746
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:16,958
that there's benefits to be...

1747
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:21,750
Right, well, the president
of the United States is fucking lying!

1748

Look, I'm just like all of you.

1749
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:29,833
I hope to God, I hope to <i>God</i> that
this president knows what she's doing.

1750
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:33,750
I hope she's got us all taken care of,
but the truth is,

1751
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:36,875
I think this whole administration

1752
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:41,500
has completely lost their fucking mind!
