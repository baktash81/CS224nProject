1
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,716
The second star to the right.

2
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:53,585
Shines in the night for you.

3
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,048
To tell you that the dreams you plan.

4
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:01,388
Really can come true.

5
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,266
The second star to the right.

6
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:08,817
Shines with a light so rare.

7
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:12,817
And if it's Never Land you need.

8
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:16,952
Its light will lead you there.

9
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,907
Twinkle, twinkle little star.

10
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:24,161
So we'll know where you are.

11
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:28,249
Gleaming in the skies above.

12
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:31,044
Lead us to the land.

13
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:35,594
We dream of.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,891
And when ourjourney is through.

15
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:42,597
Each time we say.

16
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,641
Good night.

17
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:51,485
We'll thank the little star
that shines.

18
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:56,866
The second from.

19
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:00,402
The right.

20
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,123
All this has happened before.

21
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,331
And it will all happen again.

22
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:13,424
But this time
it happened in London.

23
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:20,556
It happened on a quiet street
in Bloomsbury.

24
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:25,469
That corner house over there is
the home of the Darling family.

25
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:28,054
And Peter Pan chose
this particular house...

26
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:31,814
because there were people
here who believed in him.

27
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:35,272
There was Mrs Darling.

28
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:39,362
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't
be late for the party, you know.

29
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:43,948
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan
was the spirit of youth.

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,990
- But Mr Darling...
- Mary, unless I find my cuff links...

31
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:50,208
we don't go to the party.

32
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:54,460
And if we don't go to the party, I can
never show my face in the office again.

33
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,460
And if I can never... Ouch!

34
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:00,420
Well, Mr Darling
was a practical man.

35
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:03,765
The boys, however,
John and Michael...

36
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,259
believed Peter Pan
was a real person...

37
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:09,972
and made him the hero
of all their nursery games.

38
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,105
Blast you, Peter Pan!

39
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:17,860
Take that! Give up,
Captain Hook? Give up?

40
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,068
Never! I'll teach you
to cut off me hand!

41
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,494
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.

42
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,703
Oh, yes. Thank you, Wendy.

43
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,836
Wendy, the eldest,
not only believed...

44
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,493
she was the supreme authority
on Peter Pan...

45
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,499
and all his
marvellous adventures.

46
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:39,340
Oh, Nana, must we always
take that nasty tonic?

47
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,762
Nana, the nursemaid,
being a dog...

48
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,340
kept her opinions to herself...

49
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:48,934
and viewed the whole affair
with a certain tolerance.

50
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,523
Take that!

51
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:00,900
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!

52
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,821
And I'll cut you to pieces.

53
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,402
- Aha!
- Ouch!

54
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:10,577
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry, John.

55
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,159
You'll never leave
this ship alive!

56
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:16,753
Oh, yes, I will. Take that!

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,594
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.

58
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,511
Oh, no, you won't.

59
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,888
Back, back, back, you villain!

60
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,231
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!

61
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:40,110
- Aha, I got ya.
- You didn't either. You never touched me.

62
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:43,946
Take that and that! And that!

63
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,241
Boys, boys, less noise, please.

64
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,249
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.

65
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,826
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael...

66
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:58,669
Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.

67
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,759
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.

68
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,514
Uh, have you seen my cuff...

69
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:07,515
Oh, Nana, for goodness sake!

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,269
Where are those cuff links?

71
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:14,682
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.

72
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:17,941
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?

73
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,150
- I don't know.
- The map then.

74
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:23,274
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.

75
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:26,569
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!

76
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:29,234
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.

77
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,616
And hereafter...
Don't paw me, Michael.

78
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:37,951
This is my last clean... No! No!

79
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,799
George, dear, we really must
hurry or we'll be late...

80
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,632
- Mary, look!
- George.

81
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,971
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.

82
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,975
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.

83
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,180
- And Wendy says...
- Wendy? Story?

84
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:59,017
I might have known. Wendy!

85
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,897
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?

86
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:05,072
- Would you kindly ex...
- Oh, Mother!

87
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:08,324
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.

88
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,653
- Wendy.
- Just my old gown made over.

89
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:14,162
- But it did turn out rather nicely, didn't...
- Mary, if you don't mind.

90
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,082
- I'd like...
- Why, Father, what have you done to your shirt?

91
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:22,085
What have I... Oh!

92
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:27,050
- Now, George, really. It comes right off.
- That's no excuse.

93
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:32,179
Wendy, haven't I warned you? Stuffing the
boys' heads with a lot of silly stories.

94
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:35,103
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are.

95
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:37,679
Captain Crook! Peter Pirate!

96
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:42,234
- Peter Pan, Father.
- Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!

97
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,359
- Oh, no, Father. Father, have you...
- Oh, you don't understand.

98
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:49,239
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous...

99
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:52,909
- Now, George.
- "Now, George. ".

100
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:55,120
"Now, George"!

101
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,959
Well, "Now, George,"
will have his say!

102
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:02,207
- Please, dear.
- Mary, the child's growing up.

103
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,623
It's high time she had
a room of her own.

104
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:07,042
- Father!
- George!
- What?

105
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:10,256
- No!
- I mean it!

106
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:14,048
Young lady, this is your
last night in the nursery.

107
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:17,228
And that's my last word
on the matter...

108
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:32,698
No!

109
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:36,241
No!

110
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,589
Oh!

111
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:52,051
Poor Nana.

112
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,714
"Poor Nana"?

113
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,098
This is the last straw!

114
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,512
Out! Out, I say!

115
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,523
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!

116
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,693
There'll be no more dogs
for nursemaids in this house!

117
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:08,856
Goodbye, Nana.

118
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:14,911
"Poor Nana."
Oh, yes, "Poor Nana. ."

119
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:18,946
But "Poor Father"? Oh, no!

120
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,532
Blast it! Where is that rope?

121
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:25,880
Oh, thank you.

122
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:32,761
Dash it all, Nana,
don't look at me like that.

123
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,219
It's nothing personal.
It's just that...

124
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,635
Well, you're not really
a nurse at all.

125
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:41,812
You're, well, a dog.

126
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:44,982
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.

127
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:49,148
And sooner or later, Nana,
people have to grow up.

128
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,156
But, Mother,
I don't want to grow up.

129
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:56,488
Now, dear, don't worry
about it any more tonight.

130
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:00,493
He called Peter Pan
"absolute poppycock."

131
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:05,328
I'm sure he didn't mean it, John.
Father was just upset.

132
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:10,083
Poor Nana, out there all alone.

133
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:13,212
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.

134
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,510
She'll be all right.

135
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:18,350
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?

136
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:22,266
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.

137
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,928
Don't judge your father
too harshly.

138
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:29,353
After all, he really
loves you very much.

139
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:32,067
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.

140
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:35,821
- "He"?
- Yes, uh, Peter Pan.

141
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,990
You see, I found something
that belongs to him.

142
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:43,865
- Oh? And what's that?
- His shadow.

143
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,411
- "Shadow"?
- Mmm, Nana had it.

144
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:50,541
But I... I took it away.

145
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:57,046
Oh? Yes, of course.

146
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,465
Good night, dear.

147
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:05,559
But, George, do you think the children
will be safe without Nana?

148
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,937
Safe? Of course
they'll be safe. Why not?

149
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,394
Well, Wendy said something
about a shadow, and I...

150
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,274
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.

151
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:17,948
Oh, Peter Pan... Peter Pan!

152
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:22,781
You don't say. Goodness gracious,
whatever shall we do?

153
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,913
- But, George... Really, I...
- Sound the alarm!

154
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:27,836
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.

155
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,336
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible,
childish fiddle-faddle.

156
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:36,087
Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the
children to grow up and be practical...

157
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:38,634
- George, dear.
- When you're as bad as they are.

158
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:41,593
- Please.
- No wonder Wendy gets these idiotic ideas.

159
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:15,207
Over there, Tink, in its den.

160
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,136
Is it there?

161
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,298
Must be here somewhere.

162
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:30,643
Tink! Shh!

163
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:34,813
Stop playing
and help me find my shadow.

164
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:38,071
Shadow. Oh, shadow.

165
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,352
Huh?

166
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,032
Aha!

167
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,760
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!

168
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,261
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.

169
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,424
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.

170
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,187
You know, you look exactly
the way I thought you would.

171
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,975
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then...

172
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:55,065
Oh, you can't stick it
on with soap, Peter.

173
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:58,068
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.

174
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:00,562
Although, come to think of it,
I've never thought about it before.

175
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:04,820
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean. Of course, I
knew it was your shadow the minute I saw it.

176
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:08,161
And I said to myself, I said, "I'll
put it away for him until he comes back."

177
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:12,245
Oh, he's sure to come back."
And you did, didn't you, Peter?"

178
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:16,463
After all, one can't leave his shadow lying
about and not miss it sooner or later.

179
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:21,755
Uh, don't you agree? But what I still don't
understand is how Nana got it in the first place.

180
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,929
She really isn't... Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.

181
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:28,015
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.

182
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,473
- Although Father says...
- Girls talk too much.

183
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:34,096
Yes, girls talk too... Hmm? Oh.

184
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,808
- Well, get on with it, girl.
- Uh, my name is Wendy.

185
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:40,938
- Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl...
- Wendy's enough.

186
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,695
Oh, uh, but how did
Nana get your shadow, Peter?

187
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:47,453
Jumped at me the other night
at the window.

188
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,114
Well, what were
you doing there?

189
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:53,203
- I came to listen to the stories.
- My stories?

190
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,618
- But they're all about you.
- Of course.

191
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,997
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.

192
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,960
The Lost Boys... Oh, I remember.

193
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,842
- They're your men.
- Uh-huh.

194
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:07,973
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.

195
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:10,465
- Why?
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.

196
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,763
- Grow up!
- Tonight's my last night in the nursery.

197
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:16,809
But that means no more stories.

198
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,390
- Mm-hmm.
- No!

199
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,644
I won't have it. Come on!

200
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,814
Bu-Bu-But where are we going?

201
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,824
To Never Land.

202
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,696
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.

203
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:34,248
Oh, Peter,
it will be so wonderful.

204
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,916
But wait.
What would Mother say?

205
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,913
Mother? What's Mother?

206
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:45,047
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who...
who loves and cares for you.

207
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:48,552
- And... And tells you stories...
- Good! You can be our mother.

208
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,549
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, I...

209
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,967
Let me see now.
I-I have to pack.

210
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,340
Oh, and I must leave a note when I'll be back.
Of course, I couldn't stay too long.

211
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,522
And then I'll have to...
Oh, but Never Land.

212
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:02,278
Oh, I... I-I'm so happy I...

213
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:06,027
I think I'll give you a... a kiss.

214
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,694
What's a... a kiss?

215
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:14,286
Oh, well, uh, I-I'll show you.

216
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,413
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop it, Tink!

217
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,709
John, John, wake up! He's here.

218
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:28,585
Huh? Jiminy!

219
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,968
Ooh, what in the world was that?

220
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,382
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.

221
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:35,765
Hello, Peter Pan. I'm Michael.

222
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,558
And my name is John.
How do you do?

223
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:41,649
- Hello.
- Oh, look, a firefly.

224
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:44,106
- A pixie.
- Amazing!

225
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,741
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.

226
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:52,826
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.

227
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:58,365
Oh. Well, I think she's lovely.

228
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:03,211
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?

229
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,504
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!

230
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,584
- Peter's taking us.
- "Us"?

231
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:11,093
Well, of course. I-I couldn't
go without Michael and John.

232
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,929
Oh, I should like very much to cross
swords with some real buccaneers.

233
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:19,098
Yes, and fight pirates too.

234
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,273
Well, all right,
but ya gotta take orders.

235
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,766
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.

236
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:27,441
But, Peter, how do
we get to Never Land?

237
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,282
- Fly, of course.
- "Fly"?

238
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:34,945
It's easy. All you
have to do is to... is to...

239
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:38,038
Is to...

240
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:40,959
- Ha! That's funny.
- What's the matter?

241
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,119
- Don't you know?
- Oh, sure.

242
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:46,628
It's... It's just that
I never thought about it before.

243
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:50,167
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.

244
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:53,013
- Any happy, little thought?
- Uh-huh.

245
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:56,300
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?

246
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:59,013
Yep! Watch me now. Here I go!

247
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,851
It's easier than pie.

248
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,645
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

249
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:08,356
He flewed!

250
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:12,693
- Now you try.
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon...

251
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,316
underneath a magic moon.

252
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:18,701
I'll think I'm
in a pirate's cave.

253
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,699
I think I'll be
an Indian brave.

254
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,701
Now everybody try.

255
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:26,079
One, two, three!

256
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:30,086
We can fly! We can fly!
We can fly!

257
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,715
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?

258
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:43,262
All it takes
is faith and trust.

259
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:47,306
Oh! And something
I forgot. Dust!

260
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,071
- Dust?
- Dust?

261
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:55,362
Yep, just a little bit
of pixie dust.

262
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:03,873
Now, think of
the happiest things.

263
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,293
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.

264
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,586
Look! We're rising off the floor.

265
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:13,422
- Jiminy!
- Oh, my! We can fly!

266
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:17,924
- You can fly!
- We can fly!

267
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:22,601
Come on, everybody. Here we go!

268
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,098
Off to Never Land!

269
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,107
Think of a wonderful thought.

270
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:35,902
Any merry little thought.

271
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:38,317
Think of Christmas
Think of snow.

272
00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:43,239
Think of sleigh bells
off you go like reindeer in the sky.

273
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:47,579
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly.

274
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,754
Think of the happiest things.

275
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,509
It's the same as having wings.

276
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,834
Take the path that moonbeams make.

277
00:18:55,928 --> 00:19:01,349
If the moon is still awake
you'll see him wink his eye.

278
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:05,266
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly.

279
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,598
Up you go with a heigh and ho.

280
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:10,897
To the stars beyond the blue.

281
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:14,603
There's a Never Land
waiting for you.

282
00:19:14,697 --> 00:19:19,324
Where all your
happy dreams come true.

283
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,950
Every dream that you dream
will come true.

284
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,247
Come on, Nana!

285
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:30,834
When there's a smile
in your heart.

286
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:36,508
There's no better time to start.

287
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:38,836
Think of all thejoy you'll find.

288
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,924
When you leave the world behind
and bid your cares goodbye.

289
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:47,185
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly.

290
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,643
You can fly.

291
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:03,072
There it is, Wendy. Second star to
the right and straight on till morning.

292
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:08,951
When there's
a smile in your heart.

293
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:13,504
There's no better time to start.

294
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:19,374
Think of all thejoy you'll find
when you leave the world behind.

295
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,088
And bid your cares goodbye.

296
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:26,385
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly.

297
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:29,015
You can fly.

298
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:31,726
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

299
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:49,451
oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life.

300
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:53,374
A-rovin'over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer.

301
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:56,748
It's the life
of a pirate for me, oh.

302
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:59,332
The life of a pirate for me

303
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,504
oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life.

304
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,472
They never bury your bones.

305
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,391
For when it's all over a jolly sea rover
drops in on his friend, Davy Jones

306
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,726
oh, my good friend Davy Jones.

307
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:20,060
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?

308
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:24,569
Here we are, collecting barnacles
on this miserable island.

309
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,492
While his nibs plays
ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.

310
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,372
Look out. It might go off.

311
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,743
We ought to be tending to
the business of looting ships.

312
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:38,297
Why, I've almost forgotten
how to slit a throat.

313
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:41,300
- Better hop it.
- And tell the captain...

314
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,090
we wants to put to sea, see?

315
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:50,510
Peter Pan...

316
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:56,183
Blast that Peter Pan!

317
00:21:56,275 --> 00:22:00,439
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.

318
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,606
But where is it?

319
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:05,272
Mermaid Lagoon?

320
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:08,285
No, we've searched that.

321
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:12,036
We've combed Cannibal Cove.

322
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,161
H-Here! No. No, no, no!

323
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:18,586
That's Indian terri...

324
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:20,582
But wait.

325
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:25,550
Those redskins know this island
better than I do me own ship.

326
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:27,547
Ah...

327
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,475
I wonder.

328
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,133
- Good morning, Captain.
- I've got it!

329
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:34,972
Tiger Lily, Smee!

330
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:37,472
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?

331
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:41,481
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.

332
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:44,572
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?

333
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:49,153
Oh, a little persuasion
might be in order.

334
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:51,451
Now let me see.

335
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,493
Boiling in oil?

336
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:58,628
Keelhauling? Marooning?

337
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:03,173
A pirate's life
is a wonderful l-life.

338
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:07,506
You'll find adventure and sport.

339
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:11,345
But live every minute
for all that is in it.

340
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:17,021
The life of a pirate is short

341
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:21,852
oh, the life...

342
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:29,949
Now let me see, where was I?

343
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:32,325
Oh, dear, dear,
dear Captain Hook.

344
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:35,663
Shooting a man in
the middle of his cadenza?

345
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,205
It ain't good form, you know.

346
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:42,755
"Good form, " Mr Smee?
Blast good form!

347
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,672
Did Pan show good form
when he did this to me?

348
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:51,470
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was
only a childish prank, you might say.

349
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:54,724
Aye! But throwing it
to the crocodile!

350
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:57,811
That cursed beast liked
the taste of me so well...

351
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:01,396
he's followed me ever since,
licking his chops...

352
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:04,105
for the rest of me.

353
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:06,567
And he'd have had
you by now, Captain...

354
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,063
if he hadn't swallowed
that alarm clock.

355
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:13,701
But now when he's about, he warns ya
as ya might say with his tick-tock...

356
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:15,827
tick-tock, tick-tock.

357
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:49,313
Smee? Smee!

358
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:51,527
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!

359
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:54,861
Please, don't let him
get me, Smee! Smee!

360
00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:58,453
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.

361
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:01,293
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!

362
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:04,828
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.

363
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:12,718
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, Captain, all clear.

364
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:15,842
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.

365
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:18,305
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.

366
00:25:18,394 --> 00:25:21,810
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.

367
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:24,353
What you need is a shave.

368
00:25:24,442 --> 00:25:29,151
A nice soothing shave.
There now.

369
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:32,863
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life.

370
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,284
A-sailing over the sea
Give me a career as a...

371
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,040
Captain, you know,
I can't help noticin'...

372
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:43,702
you just ain't been
your usual jolly self of late.

373
00:25:43,795 --> 00:25:45,787
Give me a career as a buccaneer.

374
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,371
And the crew's gettin'
a might uneasy, Captain.

375
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:50,791
That is, what's left of it.

376
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:57,511
Now, why don't we put
to sea, see? Leave Never Land.

377
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,514
Forget Peter Pan. There now!

378
00:26:01,604 --> 00:26:04,012
Give me a career as a buccaneer.

379
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:08,056
We'd all be a lot happier,
not to mention a lot healthier.

380
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:16,820
Captain? Oh, dear! I never
shaved him this close before.

381
00:26:20,623 --> 00:26:24,288
Now, don't worry, Captain.
I-It must be somewhere about.

382
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:28,249
Get up, you idiot!

383
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:30,795
Aye, aye, sir.

384
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,714
Ooh! I found it, Captain.

385
00:26:34,804 --> 00:26:38,718
- Good as new.
- Why, you blithering blockhead!

386
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:42,806
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?

387
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:46,264
Three points off
the starboard bow!

388
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:48,895
Swoggle me eyes! It is Pan!

389
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:52,188
Headed this way with
some more of those scurvy brats!

390
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,272
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!

391
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:57,070
A-Aye, aye, sir. Uh, pipe up
the crew. Uh, pipe up the crew.

392
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,781
All hands on deck!

393
00:26:59,871 --> 00:27:02,575
All hands on deck!

394
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:04,658
All hands on deck!

395
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:08,411
All hands on deck!

396
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,331
Look alive, you swabs!

397
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:17,258
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, Captain.

398
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:21,558
Man the Long Tom,
you bilge rats!

399
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:25,058
- I've waited years for this.
- That's not countin' the holidays either.

400
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:27,435
Double the powder
and shorten the fuse!

401
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,765
Shorten the powder
and double the fuse!

402
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:30,938
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.

403
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:33,600
We'll pot 'em
like sitting ducks.

404
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:37,943
- All right, men! Range 42.
- "Range 42. ".

405
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:41,450
- Elevation 65.
- "Elevation 65. ".

406
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:44,289
- Three degrees west.
- "Three degrees west. ".

407
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:49,712
Steady now! Steady!

408
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:53,627
Oh, Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.

409
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:56,172
Oh, look, John,
there's Mermaid Lagoon.

410
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,136
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!

411
00:28:01,224 --> 00:28:04,308
Oh, look, there's
Captain Hook and the pirates.

412
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:09,471
Look out!

413
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,559
Quick, Tink, take Wendy
and the boys to the island.

414
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:17,022
I'll stay here
and draw Hook's fire.

415
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:22,654
Hook! Hook! You codfish! Here!

416
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:33,630
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.

417
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,585
We can't keep up with you.

418
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:39,842
Tinker Bell! Wait!

419
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:03,743
Ouch!

420
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:08,415
So!

421
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:13,252
- Who ya shovin'? - Who ya shovin'?
- You! That's who!

422
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:15,710
I'll show you!

423
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:24,264
Huh? Orders from Pan?

424
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:27,302
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?

425
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:32,893
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird. - "Wendy Bird"?

426
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:36,814
- Flying this way?
- Uh, Pan's orders are...

427
00:29:36,903 --> 00:29:39,476
What? Smash it?

428
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:41,897
- Kick it? - Stomp it?
- Stomp it?

429
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:46,448
- Oh! Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down! - Yeah!

430
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,937
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink! - Follow Tink!

431
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:52,581
- Let's go! - Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!

432
00:30:09,352 --> 00:30:11,925
- I see it!
- Me too!
- Me too!

433
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:15,472
Ready, aim...

434
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,475
fire!

435
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:33,286
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.

436
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,871
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.

437
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:41,966
Good heavens, Wendy,
you might have been killed.

438
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:46,630
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!

439
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:52,675
- Hey, Pan, I got it with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!

440
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,973
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!

441
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,435
Attention! Well...

442
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:05,858
I'm certainly proud of you,
you blockheads!

443
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,995
- I bring ya a mother to tell ya stories...
- A mother?

444
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,408
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!

445
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,209
- Tink said what?
- Well, she said you said to shoot it down!

446
00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:23,425
Tinker Bell. Tink!

447
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:28,670
Come here. You're charged
with high treason, Tink.

448
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:32,548
Are you guilty or not guilty?

449
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:36,178
Guilty? But don't ya know
ya might have killed her?

450
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:41,146
Tinker Bell!

451
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:45,529
I hereby banish you forever.

452
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:48,106
Please, not forever.

453
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:52,115
Well, for a week then. Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.

454
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:54,956
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?

455
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,792
- Aw, let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?

456
00:31:57,877 --> 00:31:59,786
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.

457
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:02,538
Personally, I should prefer
to see the aborigines.

458
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:05,835
- And the Indians too.
- All right, men!

459
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:08,596
Go out and capture
a few Indians.

460
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:12,677
- John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.

461
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,724
Forward! March!

462
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:21,227
- Come on, bear.
- Oh, Michael, do be careful.

463
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:23,725
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

464
00:32:30,243 --> 00:32:33,576
Following the leader
The leader, the leader.

465
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:37,328
We're following the leader
wherever he may go.

466
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,785
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day.

467
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:44,627
Tee dum, tee dee
It's part of the game we play.

468
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:47,966
Tee dum, tee dee
The words are easy to say.

469
00:32:48,052 --> 00:32:51,801
Just a teedle ee dum
a teedle ee do tee day.

470
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:55,673
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee dum.

471
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:59,184
We're one for all
and all of us out for fun.

472
00:32:59,272 --> 00:33:02,522
We march in line
and follow the other one.

473
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,609
With a teedle ee do
A teedle ee di tee dum.

474
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:24,955
Following the leader
The leader, the leader.

475
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:28,748
We're following the leader
wherever he may go.

476
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:32,378
We're out to fight the Injuns
The Injuns, the Injuns.

477
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:35,971
We're out to fight the Injuns
because he told us so.

478
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:39,724
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day.

479
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:43,395
We march along and
these are the words we say.

480
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:46,483
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day

481
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:50,401
oh, a teedle dee dum
A teedle ee do tee day

482
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,941
oh, a teedle ee dum
A teedle ee do tee day

483
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:58,364
Indians! Oh, Blackfoot tribe.

484
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:02,995
Belongs to the Algonquin group.

485
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,493
- Quite savage, you know.
- Uh, let's go get 'em.

486
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:09,039
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

487
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:12,674
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- Uh, what's strategy?

488
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:18,136
A plan of attack. The initial phase
is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!

489
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:49,923
John! Indians! Indians!

490
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,296
Let me in!

491
00:34:55,138 --> 00:34:57,260
Now remember,
the Indian is cunning...

492
00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:59,471
- Hey...
- But not intelligent.

493
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:02,975
Therefore, we simply surround them
and take them by surprise...

494
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:38,592
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.

495
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:42,726
- Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
- Oh, we don't mind.

496
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,470
That's okay.

497
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:51,816
- How!
- Uh, h-how, Chief! - How!

498
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:56,363
For many moons red man
fight paleface Lost Boys.

499
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:59,948
- Ugh. - Ugh, ugh.
- Sometime you win.

00:36:00,036 --> 00:36:03,156
- Sometime we win.
- Okay, Chief.

501
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:06,165
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.

502
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,536
"Turn us loose"?
You mean this is only a game?

503
00:36:09,629 --> 00:36:11,787
Sure! When we win,
we turn them loose.

504
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:14,004
- When they win, they turn us loose.
- They turn us loose.

505
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,629
This time, no turn 'em loose.

506
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,628
- Huh?
- Huh?

507
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:22,422
- The Chief's a great spoof er.
- Me no spoof'em.

508
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:24,889
Where you hide
Princess Tiger Lily?

509
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:29,639
- Uh, Tiger Lily? - We ain't got your old princess.
- I've certainly never seen her.

510
00:36:29,732 --> 00:36:33,979
- Me neither. - Honest we don't.
- Heap big lie.

511
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,937
If Tiger Lily
not back by sunset...

512
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:41,483
burn 'em at stake.

513
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:04,334
Just imagine,
real live mermaids.

514
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,301
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Oh, Peter, I'd love to.

515
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,468
All right, come on.

516
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:15,186
- It's Peter. - Oh!
- Hello, Peter!

517
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,979
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter! - Hello!

518
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,192
Hello, Peter!

519
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,658
- Hello, girls.
- I'm so glad to see you.

520
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:31,205
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?

521
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,410
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.

522
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,788
Want to hear about the time I cut off
Hook's hand and threw it to the crocodile?

523
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,499
- Oh, I've always liked that one.
- Me too.

524
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,262
Well, there I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...

525
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,717
- Oh, Peter!
- By 40 or 50 pirates. - Who's she?

526
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,341
Huh? Her? Oh, that's Wendy.

527
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,973
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?

528
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,897
And in her nightdress too.

529
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,899
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.

530
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,061
- Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
- Oh, but you must!

531
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,897
- We insist!
- No, no, please!

532
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,903
- Too good for us, eh?
- Peter!

533
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,414
- If you dare to come near me again...
- Wendy! Wendy!

534
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,255
They were just having a little fun,
weren't you, girls?

535
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,587
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.

536
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,595
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute...

537
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,883
- that I'm going to put up with a...
- Shh. Hold it, Wendy.

538
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,437
- Yep, it's Hook, all right.
- Hook! - Hook!

539
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,484
Hook! Oh!

540
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,357
Quick, Wendy.

541
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,370
They've captured Tiger Lily.

542
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,465
Looks like they're
headin' for Skull Rock.

543
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,967
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.

544
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,781
Now, me dear Princess,
this is me proposition.

545
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:32,159
You tell me the hiding place
of Peter Pan...

546
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,154
and I shall set you free.

547
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:37,117
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.

548
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,162
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?

549
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,669
Oh, yes, always, Captain.

550
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:48,299
You'd better talk, me dear,
for soon the tide will be in...

551
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,343
and then it will be too late.

552
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,842
I'll show the old codfish. Stay here,
Wendy, and watch the fun. - "Fun"?

553
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,263
Remember...

554
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,520
there is no path
through water...

555
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,358
to the happy hunting ground.

556
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,773
This is your last chance,
Tiger Lily!

557
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:12,360
Manatoa, great spirit
of mighty seawater, speak!

558
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,913
Beware, Captain Hook!

559
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,536
Beware! Beware!

560
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:23,493
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, Captain.

561
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:27,716
Stand by, Smee,
while I take a look around.

562
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,216
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?

563
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,150
Psst! Wendy. Watch this.

564
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,239
- Mr Smee!
- Uh, yes, Captain?

565
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:59,570
Release the princess
and take her back to her people.

566
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,918
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess...

567
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:08,879
- But... But, Captain...
- Those are me orders, Mr Smee!

568
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,208
Aye, aye, sir.

569
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,181
- Well, at last Captain Hook's comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!

570
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,387
I told him all along you Indians
wouldn't betray Peter Pan.

571
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:26,022
And just what do you think
you are doing, Mr Smee?

572
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:30,272
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.

573
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:35,025
- My orders?
- Why, yes, Captain. Didn't you just say to go...

574
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,617
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!

575
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:44,410
- My orders. Of all the bumbling...
- Mr Smee!

576
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,705
Just exactly what do you
think you are doing?

577
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,335
Putting her back
like you said, Captain.

578
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,631
I said nothing of the sort!

579
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,673
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that...

580
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,803
For the last time, Mr Smee.

581
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,054
Take the princess
back to her people.

582
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:07,222
Understand? Understand?
Understand? Understand?

583
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:11,266
- Uh, aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and one more thing.

584
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,482
When you return to the ship,
tell the whole crew...

585
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,279
to help themselves
to me best rum.

586
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:22,908
- Peter!
- Here's your spirit, Smee!

587
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,075
Why, it's Peter Pan.

588
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,335
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, Captain.

589
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:35,338
Come down, boy,
if you've a taste for cold steel.

590
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,762
- Watch this, Wendy.
- Oh, Peter, do be careful.

591
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,905
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!

592
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:59,900
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!

593
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,532
Right here, Mr Smee.

594
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,789
Hold it, you fool! No! No!

595
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,047
Captain?

596
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,041
Oh, how dreadful.

597
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:19,045
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.

598
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,966
Captain!

599
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,803
In the back, Captain?

600
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,858
Give it to him, Captain!

601
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,733
Cleave him to the brisket.

602
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:53,244
I've got you this time, Pan.

603
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,596
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.

604
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:06,058
I'll get you for this, Pan,
if it's the last thing I do!

605
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:11,015
I say, Captain,
do you hear something?

606
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,349
No.

607
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,360
No!

608
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,192
No!

609
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:27,198
Mr Crocodile,
do you like codfish?

610
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,697
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!

611
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,711
No!

612
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,795
- Smee!
- D-Don't go away, Captain!

613
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,341
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.

614
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,388
Smee!

615
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,816
Smee!

616
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,739
Smee!

617
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,953
Ow!

618
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,743
Captain! Captain!

619
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,619
Smee! Smee!

620
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,623
- Give him back!
- Smee...

621
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:25,763
Row for the ship!
Row for the ship...

622
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,094
Whoa!

623
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,933
Smee!

624
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,696
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?

625
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,319
Tiger Lily? Oh, Tiger Lily.

626
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,527
Help...

627
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:58,662
Peter. Wait for me.

628
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:32,446
That cursed Peter Pan.

629
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,585
Making a fool out of me.

630
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,879
Oh, my head.

631
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:55,349
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life.

632
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,810
- Your hot water, Mr Smee.
- Shh!

633
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:00,769
The poor Captain
has a splitting headache.

634
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,063
We mustn't annoy him.

635
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:25,923
Well, Captain, it's nice
to see you smiling again.

636
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,506
Brings back the good old days when
we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.

637
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:33,967
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain...

638
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,468
why don't we put to sea again?

639
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,813
You know, there's trouble
brewin' on the island.

640
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,808
Women trouble.

641
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:45,187
I wouldn't want this
to go any farther, but...

642
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,147
the cook told me that
the first mate told him...

643
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:53,571
that he heard that Pan
has banished Tinker Bell.

644
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:56,664
Whoa!

645
00:47:56,749 --> 00:48:02,088
Why, you doddering imbecile, I...
Did you say Pan...

646
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,876
has banished Tinker Bell?

647
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,674
Aye, aye, Captain. That he has.

648
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,546
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.

649
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:13,682
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.

650
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:18,144
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, Captain.

651
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:21,349
This ain't no place
for a respectable pirate.

652
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:24,014
That's it, Smee! That's it!

653
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,067
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.

654
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:29,190
Quick, me coat.
Me best dress coat.

655
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:31,855
Aye, aye, sir. The sooner
we get going, the better.

656
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:36,245
Ah, yes, a jealous female
can be tricked into anything.

657
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,904
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.

658
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,787
Here you are, sir.
Your Sunday set, sir.

659
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:45,496
If we impress the pixie, convince her
we're eager to help her...

660
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,626
the wench may chart
our course to a...

661
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,553
certain hiding place.

662
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,211
Our best hiding place
is the Spanish main, sir.

663
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:56,549
I'll set our course...

664
00:48:56,643 --> 00:49:01,304
And where do you think
you are going?

665
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:04,564
T-To tell the boys
we sails with the tide, sir.

666
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:09,562
You will go ashore,

672
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:40,602
He's delivering an oration
in sign language.

673
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:44,269
- What's he saying?
- He says...

674
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:47,940

675
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,103
"Save Tiger Lily.

677
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,283
Well, he certainly
doesn't look "heap glad. ".

678
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:01,450
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.

Uh, what makes the red man red?

686
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:37,817
- When did he first say, "Ugh"?
- First say, "Ugh"?

687
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,152
Why does he ask you, "How"?

688
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:43,496
"Why does he ask you, 'How'?"

Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

What made the red man red.

708
00:51:54,988 --> 00:51:58,772
Let's go back a million years
to the very first Injun prince.

00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:02,235
He kissed a maid and start to blush

00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:13,337
No matter what's been
written or said, no matter what.

714
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:21,423
Now you know why
the red man's red.

715
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:34,775

Squaw go home.

720
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,000
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell...

721
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:03,012
but Captain Hook
would like a word with ya.

722
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:20,486
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.

723
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:27,029
Tomorrow I leave the island,
never to return.

724
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:30,490
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and...

725
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,204
And that's why I asked
you over, me dear...

726
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:41,799
to tell Peter
I bear him no ill will.

727
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:48,092
Oh, Pan has his faults,
to be sure.

728
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:51,102
Uh, bringing that Wendy
to the island, for instance.

729
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:53,096
Dangerous business, that.

730
00:53:56,651 --> 00:54:02,238
Why, rumour has it that already
she has come between you and Peter.

731
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:10,497
But what's this? Tears?

732
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:14,875
Then it is true. Oh, Smee.

733
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:18,045
The way of a man with a maid.

734
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:22,876
Taking the best years
of her life and then...

735
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:27,382
casting her aside
like an old glove!

736
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:30,391
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?

737
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:34,723
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear.

738
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:38,515
It's that Wendy who's to blame.

739
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:42,559
Mr Smee, we must
save the lad from himself.

740
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:45,146
But how?

741
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:48,824
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.

742
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,948
Sail! That's it, Smee!

743
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:58,545
- We'll shanghai Wendy.
- "Shanghai Wendy, " Captain?

744
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:04,086
Take her to sea with us. With her gone, Peter
will soon forget this mad infatuation.

745
00:55:04,177 --> 00:55:07,842
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home...

746
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:13,435
But, Captain, we...
we don't know where Peter Pan lives!

747
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,138
Great Scott,
you're right, Smee!

748
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,607
What's that, my dear?

749
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:25,274
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.

750
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:29,279
- Take this down, Smee.
- "Take this down, Smee. ".

751
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,445
Aye, aye, Captain.

752
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,794
- Start at Pegleg Point.
- "Start at Pegleg Point. ".

753
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:45,834
- Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
- "Blindman's Bluff. ".

754
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:51,170
Yes, yes. Hop, skip and
a jump across Crocodile Creek.

755
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:55,844
Then north by northeast,
one, two, three.

756
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:59,935
Well, get on with it...
Continue, my dear.

757
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,696
I mustn't harm Peter?

758
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:09,825
Madam, Captain Hook
gives his word...

759
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:12,696
not to lay a finger...

760
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:15,539
or a hook on Peter Pan.

761
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:22,378
Ah, Hangman's Tree.

762
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:26,924
So that's the entrance
to his hiding place.

763
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,842
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

764
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:41,013

- How! - Uh, how, Chief.
- How, Chief! How!

773
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:10,635
- How.
- How.

774
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,674
Big Chief greets Little Mother.

775
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:16,220
- How!
- Ugh!

776
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:19,559
Aw, Wendy, is that
all you have to say?

777
00:57:19,646 --> 00:57:23,180
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.

778
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:26,275
- Tiger Lily?
- John! Michael!

779
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:28,686
Take off that war paint
and get ready for bed.

780
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,531
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.

781
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:33,858
Go for days without sleep.

782
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:36,074
- But, boys, we're going home in the morning.
- Home!

783
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:39,946
- And...
- Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.

784
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:44,619
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.

785
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:47,464
Now, Peter, let's stop
pretending and be practical.

786
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:50,964
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.

787
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:54,302
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.

788
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:58,137
Do you want to stay here
and grow up like... like savages?

789
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:00,135
- Of course.
- But you can't.

790
00:58:00,228 --> 00:58:03,679
You need a mother. We all do.

791
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:05,931
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?

792
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:08,101
Why, Michael, of course not!

793
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:10,352
Surely you haven't forgotten
our real mother!

794
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:16,033
Did she have silky ears
and wear a fur coat?

795
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:19,867
Oh, no, Michael. That was Nana.

796
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:21,865
I think I had a mother once.

797
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:25,872
- What was she like?
- What was she like? - I forget.

798
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:28,916
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!

799
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:31,545
Hey, who ya shovin'?

800
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:37,471
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.

801
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:40,095
- Yeah, tell us.
- Yeah, tell us. - Please, Wendy.

802
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:43,471
Well, a mother,
a real mother...

803
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:47,146
is the most wonderful person
in the world.

804
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:50,816
She's the angel voice...

805
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:53,276
that bids you good night...

806
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:56,282
kisses your cheek...

807
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:58,656
whispers, "Sleep tight. ".

808
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:02,991
Your mother.

809
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:06,950
And mine.

810
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:11,956
Your mother.

811
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:16,094
And mine.

812
00:59:16,179 --> 00:59:22,264
The helping hand
that guides you along.

813
00:59:22,352 --> 00:59:29,434
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong.

814
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:33,274
Your mother.

815
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:37,443
And mine.

816
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:42,610
Your mother.

817
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:43,249
And mine.

818
00:59:47,377 --> 00:59:52,798
What makes mothers
all that they are.

819
00:59:52,882 --> 01:00:00,882
Might as well ask
what makes a star.

820
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:08,311
Ask your heart
to tell you her worth.

821
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:11,648
Your heart will say.

822
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:16,313
Heaven on earth.

823
01:00:16,406 --> 01:00:20,818
- Another word.
- Shh.

824
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:25,702
For divine.

825
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:31,663
Your mother.

826
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:34,755
And mine.

827
01:00:38,928 --> 01:00:43,839
- I wanna see my mother.
- Yes, Michael.

828
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:46,341
I propose we leave
for home at once.

829
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:49,390
- Could I go too? Huh, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy! - Come on! Let me go!

830
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,692
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.

831
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:56,730
Uh, that is,
if Peter doesn't mind.

832
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:59,692
Go on! Go back and grow up!

833
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,986
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up...

834
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:05,236
you can never come back!

835
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,663
- Never!
- Dear.

836
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,498
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!

837
01:01:12,587 --> 01:01:14,663
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.

838
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:18,166
They'll be back.

839
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:25,173
Peter.

840
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:31,009
Goodbye, Peter.

841
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,689
All right, men. Take them away.

842
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:48,370
And now, Smee, to take care
of Master Peter Pan.

843
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:54,245
But, Captain, wouldn't it
be more humane-like to slit his throat?

844
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:57,042
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.

845
01:01:57,131 --> 01:02:00,880
But I have given me word
not to lay a finger...

846
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:04,384
or a hook on Peter Pan.

847
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:10,468
And Captain Hook
never breaks a promise.

848
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:14,477
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho.

849
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,641
So try the life of a thief.

850
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,643
Just sample the life of a crook.

851
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:20,729
There isn't a boy
who won't enjoy.

852
01:02:20,822 --> 01:02:23,657
A-workin'for Captain Hook.

853
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:26,826
The world's most famous crook.

854
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:31,490
Crook, crook, crickety crockety, crickety,
crick the croc is after Captain...

855
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:34,826
A special offer for today

856
01:02:34,919 --> 01:02:37,042
I'll tell you what I'll do.

857
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,000
All those who sign without delay.

858
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:42,712
Will get a free tattoo.

859
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:45,375
Why, it's like money in the bank.

860
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:48,342
Come on
Join up and I'll be frank.

861
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:52,561
Unless you do
you'll walk the plank.

862
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:54,554
The choice is up to you.

863
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:56,854
The choice is up to you.

864
01:02:56,941 --> 01:03:00,725
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho.

865
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,729
You'll love the life of a thief.

866
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:04,945
You'll relish the life
of a crook.

867
01:03:05,033 --> 01:03:06,859
There's barrels
of fun for everyone.

868
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:10,569
And you'll get treasures
by the ton.

869
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:14,791
So come and sign the book.

870
01:03:14,876 --> 01:03:17,830
Join up with Captain Hook.

871
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,127
- Hey, I wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!

872
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:23,500
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!

873
01:03:23,593 --> 01:03:28,551
Boys! Aren't you
ashamed of yourselves?

874
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,806
But Captain Hook is
most insistent, Wendy.

875
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:35,226
Yeah! He says we'll walk
the plank if we don't.

876
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:38,812
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.

877
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,648
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.

878
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:46,147
Peter Pan will save them.

879
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:50,110
Oh, Captain, you did it.

880
01:03:50,203 --> 01:03:52,954
But a thousand pardons, my dear.

881
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,324
I don't believe you are
in on our little joke.

882
01:03:56,417 --> 01:04:00,664
You see, we left
a present for Peter.

883
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:03,590
Sort of a surprise package,
you might say.

884
01:04:03,675 --> 01:04:07,126
Why, I can see our little
friend at this very moment...

885
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:11,467
reading the tender inscription.

886
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:16,184
"To Peter, with love
from Wendy.

887
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:19,853
Do not open till 6 o'clock. ".

888
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:22,976
Huh. I wonder what's in it.

889
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:26,189
Could he but see
within the package...

890
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,658
he would find an ingenious
little device.

891
01:04:30,743 --> 01:04:33,661
Set, so that when
the clock is like this...

892
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:36,996
Peter Pan will be blasted...

893
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:40,867
out of Never Land forever.

894
01:04:40,962 --> 01:04:41,708
No!

895
01:04:46,426 --> 01:04:48,798
But time grows short.

896
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:53,430
We have but 18 seconds.

897
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:56,802
Fifteen seconds.

898
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:59,682
Thirteen seconds.

899
01:04:59,772 --> 01:05:01,682
Twelve seconds.

900
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:03,731
Well, I guess
I can open it now.

901
01:05:10,033 --> 01:05:12,784
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.

902
01:05:12,869 --> 01:05:16,285
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?

903
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:18,531
Hook? A bomb?

904
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:20,783
Don't be ridiculous!

905
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:33,296
And so passeth a worthy opponent.

906
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:35,298
Amen.

907
01:05:39,228 --> 01:05:42,146
Hook! It was a bomb!

908
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:46,644
Why, if it hadn't been
for Tink... Tinker Bell!

909
01:05:51,074 --> 01:05:53,991
Tink? Tinker Bell?

910
01:05:56,913 --> 01:05:58,905
Where are you, Tink?

911
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:02,332
Tink? Tinker Bell!

912
01:06:09,384 --> 01:06:12,669
Tink. Are you all right?

913
01:06:12,762 --> 01:06:16,629
Wendy? The boys?

914
01:06:19,394 --> 01:06:21,433
But I've gotta save you first.

915
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:23,644
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!

916
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:26,981
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?

917
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:30,651
You mean more to me than
anything in this whole world!

918
01:06:33,241 --> 01:06:38,366
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?

919
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:42,073
Captain Hook, we will
never join your crew.

920
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:45,500
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.

921
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:49,002
- Goodbye, boys. - Goodbye, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Wendy.

922
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:53,040
- Be brave, John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.

923
01:06:53,136 --> 01:06:56,670
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy. - Come on!

924
01:06:56,764 --> 01:06:59,434
- Get along over there!
- Get going, miss. Get going! Don't give us no trouble!

925
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:02,352
Go on! Go on! Get it over with!

926
01:07:02,437 --> 01:07:05,354
- Move along!
- The Captain's waitin'!

927
01:07:12,864 --> 01:07:15,615
Wendy! Wendy!

928
01:07:20,038 --> 01:07:24,201
- Captain, n-no splash.
- Not a sound.

929
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:27,542
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.

930
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:30,380
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.

931
01:07:30,465 --> 01:07:34,297
- Did you hear a splash?
- I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day.

932
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:36,876
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.

933
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:39,260
The ship is bewitched.

934
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:41,425
No splash, Captain.

935
01:07:41,517 --> 01:07:46,642
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.

936
01:07:46,731 --> 01:07:49,020
I'll give you a splash!

937
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:51,646
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!

938
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:55,645
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!

939
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,733
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!

940
01:07:57,825 --> 01:08:00,032
It's his blinkin' ghost
what's talkin'!

941
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,946
Say your prayers, Hook.

942
01:08:02,038 --> 01:08:06,451
I'll show you this ghost
has blood in his veins.

943
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:09,496
I'll run him through! Ooh!

944
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:11,580
Take that!

945
01:08:18,513 --> 01:08:20,137
Curse this hook!

946
01:08:21,933 --> 01:08:23,925
Come on, everybody!

947
01:08:27,355 --> 01:08:30,272
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!

948
01:08:30,358 --> 01:08:33,312
Don't stand there,
you bilge rats!

949
01:08:33,403 --> 01:08:36,487
Get those scurvy brats!

950
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:39,443
After the brats, men!

951
01:09:04,726 --> 01:09:06,765
This is no mere boy.

952
01:09:06,853 --> 01:09:10,471
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!

953
01:09:18,364 --> 01:09:20,440
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!

954
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:23,700
Steady, men. Steady.

955
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:25,779
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!

956
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:29,454
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!

957
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:32,163
Down, you blackguard!

958
01:10:08,373 --> 01:10:10,081
Hurray!

959
01:10:15,004 --> 01:10:19,832
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer! - Yea for Bear Killer!

960
01:10:19,926 --> 01:10:23,092
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!

961
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:24,887
Coward? Me?

962
01:10:25,056 --> 01:10:30,181
Ha-ha-ha! You wouldn't dare fight
old Hook man-to-man!

963
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:32,807
You'd fly away like
a cowardly sparrow!

964
01:10:32,897 --> 01:10:35,981
Nobody calls Pan
a coward and lives!

965
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:39,021
I'll fight you man-to-man,
with one hand behind my back.

966
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:45,364
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!

967
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:49,698
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!

968
01:11:10,351 --> 01:11:15,642
Now! Insolent youth,
prepare to die!

969
01:11:15,732 --> 01:11:18,436
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!

970
01:11:18,526 --> 01:11:22,606
No! I gave my word.

971
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:28,326
You're mine, Hook!

972
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:33,246
Cleave him to the brisket!

973
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:37,959
You wouldn't do old Hook
in now, would you, lad?

974
01:11:38,046 --> 01:11:42,542
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.

975
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:48,304
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.

976
01:11:48,389 --> 01:11:51,758
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!

977
01:11:51,851 --> 01:11:56,264
- I'm a codfish!
- Hurray!

978
01:11:56,356 --> 01:12:00,685
Hook is a codfish
A codfish, a codfish.

979
01:12:00,777 --> 01:12:05,024
- Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish.
- All right, Hook...

980
01:12:05,114 --> 01:12:09,326
you're free to go,
and never return.

981
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,823
Peter!

982
01:12:23,132 --> 01:12:25,670
Smee! Smee!

983
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,350
Smee!

984
01:12:43,111 --> 01:12:48,188
Smee! Smee!

985
01:12:48,282 --> 01:12:52,363
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!

986
01:12:52,453 --> 01:12:55,027
Captain!

987
01:12:55,123 --> 01:12:57,199
Captain! Captain!

988
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,204
Hurray!

989
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:04,795
Hurray for Captain Pan!

990
01:13:04,882 --> 01:13:08,133
All right, ya swabs,
aloft with ya!

991
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:12,264
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!

992
01:13:12,348 --> 01:13:16,298
But, but, Peter...
Oh, that is, Captain Pan.

993
01:13:16,394 --> 01:13:21,471
- At your service, madam.
- Could you tell me, sir, where we're sailing?

994
01:13:21,566 --> 01:13:25,480
- To London, madam.
- Oh, Peter.

995
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:29,484
Michael! John!
We're going home!

996
01:13:29,574 --> 01:13:32,325
Man the capstan!

997
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:35,162
Hoist anchor!

998
01:13:37,915 --> 01:13:39,955
Pixie dust!

999
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:23,159
George, I am so glad you changed your mind about Wendy.
After all, she's still a child.

1000
01:14:23,252 --> 01:14:27,464
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.

1001
01:14:27,548 --> 01:14:29,506
Do I, Nana?

1002
01:14:31,928 --> 01:14:35,344
Oh! Wendy!

1003
01:14:37,725 --> 01:14:40,975
Wendy, what on earth
are you doing there?

1004
01:14:41,062 --> 01:14:43,518
Mmm. Hmm?

1005
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,521
- Oh, Mother, we're back!
- Back?

1006
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:51,482
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.

1007
01:14:51,572 --> 01:14:54,028
- Lost Bo... Ready?
- To grow up.

1008
01:14:54,117 --> 01:14:56,442
That's why they went
back to Never Land.

1009
01:14:56,536 --> 01:14:59,620
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.

1010
01:14:59,706 --> 01:15:03,324
- Uh, "am"?
- Uh, ready to grow up.

1011
01:15:03,418 --> 01:15:05,659
Oh! Oh! Uh...

1012
01:15:05,753 --> 01:15:09,336
Well, my dear,
all in good time.

1013
01:15:09,424 --> 01:15:12,175
- After all, perhaps we were too...
- Oh, but, Mother...

1014
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:14,833
it was such a wonderful adventure.

1015
01:15:14,929 --> 01:15:17,681
Tinker Bell and the mermaids
and Peter Pan.

1016
01:15:17,765 --> 01:15:19,674
Oh, he was the most
wonderful of all.

1017
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:22,852
- Why, why, even when we were kidnapped, I...
- Kidnapped!

1018
01:15:22,937 --> 01:15:26,602
Mm-hmm. I knew Peter Pan
would save us, and he did.

1019
01:15:26,691 --> 01:15:29,526
And we all called him a codfish!

1020
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:31,687
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.

1021
01:15:31,779 --> 01:15:35,611
And then we sailed away
on a ship in the sky.

1022
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:40,196
Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed.

1023
01:15:40,288 --> 01:15:45,199
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?

1024
01:15:45,293 --> 01:15:48,460
See how well he sails the ship.

1025
01:15:48,546 --> 01:15:53,208
- George. George!
- Now what, Mary?

1026
01:15:56,054 --> 01:15:58,260
Nana, d-did you see...

1027
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:03,049
You know, I have
the strangest feeling...

1028
01:16:03,144 --> 01:16:05,552
that I've seen that ship before.

1029
01:16:05,647 --> 01:16:07,972
A long time ago...

1030
01:16:08,066 --> 01:16:10,604
when I was very young.

1031
01:16:10,693 --> 01:16:14,987
- George, dear.
- Father.

1032
01:16:15,073 --> 01:16:18,323
When there's a smile in your heart.

1033
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:23,652
There's no better time to start.

1034
01:16:23,748 --> 01:16:25,824
Think of all thejoy you'll find.

1035
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:27,826
When you leave the world behind.

1036
01:16:27,919 --> 01:16:31,418
And bid your cares goodbye.

1037
01:16:31,506 --> 01:16:34,175
You can fly.

1038
01:16:34,258 --> 01:16:36,666
You can fly.

1039
01:16:37,929 --> 01:16:42,674
You can fly
