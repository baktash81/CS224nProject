Jake.

364
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:14,882
Ranger, apparently.

365
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:16,549
Heard a lot about you,
Pentecost.

366
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:17,885
Yeah?

367
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:19,119
You know you still hold
the record?

368
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:20,588
- What record?
- Shut up.

369
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,856
JULES:
So how did they lure you back?

370
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:24,558
I mean, it couldn't have been
the pay, so...

371
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,026
Oh, yeah, it's a long story,
but if you,

372
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,095
if you want to talk about it,
we can meet up...

373
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:30,865
- She's busy.

380
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:46,113
- Sorry, man. Ooh!
- Oh!

381
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:47,050
Ah!

382
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:50,751
And raise you two shower chits.

383
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:52,485

384
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:53,887
You need all the showers
you can get, man.

385
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,556
I have a musk!

386
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:57,558

This is Amara Namani.

She'll be joining you in
sim training bright and early.

393
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:10,738
And this is Ranger Pentecost.

394
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,572
He will be helping me
instruct you

395
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:15,909
until I can find a new copilot
to replace Ranger Burke.

396
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:18,212

Nothing you want to hear.

398
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:26,619
Malikova, get Namani squared
away and prepped for training.

399
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:28,621
Yes, sir!

400
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:30,526
As you were.

401
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:35,729
Pentecost.

402
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,199
We're gonna be trained
by a Pentecost!

403
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:42,235
So? Not like he was the one who
died helping close the Breach.

404
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:44,672

Yo, Ilya, you see this? Ah!

407
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,678
Uh, hey.

408
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,780
So, where should I...?

409
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:55,215
Heard you built
your own little Jaeger.

410
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:57,217
Yeah, actually.

411
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,786
Uh, Scrapper.

412
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:00,954

Hey, come on. I got ya.

416
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,498
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

417
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,633

- Jinhai.

00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:18,239
- Vik?
- SURESH: It's short for Viktoriya.

421
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,706
But you don't want
to call her that.

422
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,608
Yeah, what's her problem?

423
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,676
- Took her three shots to pass the entrance test.
- Yeah.

424
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:25,044
Don't think she likes
how you landed here.

425
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:26,513
Yeah, well, it's not my fault.

426

Recruiters never
come around back home.

427
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,551

- No.

00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:33,953
I'll teach you some.

Kaiju to flatten a few cities

498

to wipe us all out.

499
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,745
All right, look, Nate, I don't
have a problem with you, man.

500
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:47,748
But I had to make a choice.

501
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,383
It was between
your pretty face and prison.

502
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:51,885
I chose your pretty face.

503
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:53,787
Oh, well, I'm touched.

504
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:55,789
And how many damn toppings
do you need?

505
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,057
Leave my toppings be, man.

506
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,492
Don't mess with
my damn toppings.

507
00:23:58,494 --> 00:24:01,994
So the cadets got, like, what,

508
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:03,396
couple of months
before they graduate?

509
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:06,200
- Six.
- Okay. I'll tell you what.

510
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:08,469
Every time you want to say
something soldiery to 'em,

511
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:11,472
I'll just nod, or like,
"Yep, what he said."

512
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:14,140
And then, before you know it,
they get to be pilots.

513
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:15,943
- And I get to get back to my life.
- Great.

514
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:18,145
Boom.

515
00:24:18,147 --> 00:24:20,313

sooner than you think.

516
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:22,849

00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,047
Guess it's better than
prison stripes. Barely.

537
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:29,049
(chuckles)
I-I'm sorry, is this him?

538
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:31,050
It-It's got to be him, right?
You're Stacker's kid.

539
00:25:31,052 --> 00:25:33,052
Hey, uh, I'm Newt.

540
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:34,988
I was, uh, I was a big fan
of your father's.

541
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,223
Amazing speech writer,
by the way.

542
00:25:36,225 --> 00:25:38,157
Did you ever hear his one where
he canceled the apocalypse?

543
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,126
- Newton.
- Hermann.

544
00:25:40,128 --> 00:25:41,595
I was hoping you'd be
tagging along.

545
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:44,130
I could use your help on
an experiment I'm working on.

546
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:46,066
Now, this will
only take a moment.

547
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:48,068
- I know how busy you are.
- Yeah.

548
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,037
Don't want to impose,
but, uh...

549
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,938
Aw, come on,
you can't impose on me.

550
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,209
I mean, we've been inside
each other's heads, right?

551
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:57,243
We've saved the world.

552
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:58,878
We've drifted with a Kaiju!

553
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,313
You know, if we hadn't
yanked that intel

554
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:01,482
out of that Kaiju's brain,

555
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:03,549
Raleigh would've never
been able to close the Breach.

556
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:05,418
Now, that was you
and that was me.

557
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,421
Technically more me,

558
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:09,356
but any chance we could
make this quick or...?

559
00:26:09,358 --> 00:26:11,992
- Um, deployment.
- Huh?

560
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:13,226
Of Jaegers.

561
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:15,028
Deploying them into battle,
it takes, takes too much time.

562
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,363
The amount of damage

563
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:18,632
a Kaiju can inflict
before they've ev...

564
00:26:18,634 --> 00:26:21,871
Ah, here.
I think I've found a solution.

565
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:28,107
Hermann, you know I can
never read your, uh...

566
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:30,644
Uh, rocket thrusters, huh?

567
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:33,079
Yeah. No.

568
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:34,982
No. There's no fuel
in the world

569
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,983
with that kind of
boost-to-mass ratio. (chuckles)

570
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:38,921
From this world.

571
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:43,656
No.

572
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:45,492
I-Is that Kaiju blood?

573
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:47,594
Exactly.

574
00:26:47,596 --> 00:26:50,329
I've discovered Kaiju blood
is highly reactive

575
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:53,066
when it's combined
with rare earth elements...

576
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:54,501
cerium, lanthanum, gadolinium.

577
00:26:54,503 --> 00:26:56,136
I realize that, pal. Okay.

578
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:57,637
Y-You can't be fooling around
with this stuff.

579
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:59,306
You're gonna blow yourself up.
Uh...

580
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:01,942
Now, no one knows more about
Kaiju morphology than you.

581
00:27:01,944 --> 00:27:03,609
- Okay.
- And if you could just take a look, please.

582
00:27:03,611 --> 00:27:06,914
No, Hermann, I got to stop you.
Look, none of this matters.

583
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,548
Once my boss' drones
are approved,

584
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,483
deployment time,
that's gonna be a non-issue.

585
00:27:10,485 --> 00:27:14,021
Within a year, buddy, we're
gonna have drones everywhere.

586
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:16,924
So you won't help me?

587
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,960
Look, why don't we talk about
it over dinner at my place?

588
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:21,595
Okay? You can
finally meet Alice.

589
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:22,762
I don't need
a hot meal, Newton.

590
00:27:22,764 --> 00:27:25,165
What I need is a solution
to a very specific problem.

591
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:26,700
- Hey.
- (watch beeps)

592
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:28,534
Ah, that's me, bud.

593
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:31,003
I'm sorry. Duty calls.
It's been nice catching up.

594
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:32,973
Newton.

595
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:34,610
I, um...

596
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,214
I still get nightmares
about what we saw

597
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:45,719
when we drifted with
that disgusting Kaiju brain.

598
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:47,721
Yeah.

599
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:52,061
But... it was a hell
of a rush, wasn't it?

600
00:27:54,026 --> 00:27:56,121
Dr. Geizler, time to go.

601
00:27:56,163 --> 00:27:58,896
Okay, okay.

602
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:04,404
You and Dr. Gottleib were close, weren't you?

603
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:05,071
During the war?

604
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:06,246
Oh, uh...

605
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:08,152
We shared lab yes okay-

606
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:11,011
Speak English, your Mandarin
makes you sound like an idiot.

607
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:12,311
I-I know, I'm terrible.

608
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:13,615
Uh, yes, we shared
a lab together.

609
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:15,749
What were you and Dr. Gottlieb talking about?

610
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:17,751
Oh, some crazy idea
he had about

611
00:28:17,753 --> 00:28:19,355
thruster pods
on a, on a Jaeger.

612
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:22,214
Until Secretary General Mori makes her
recommendation at the council summit,

613
00:28:22,315 --> 00:28:23,851
I can't afford a misstep.

614
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:26,079
No more contact with him...

615
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:27,956
until after the vote.

616
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:31,063
Oh. Well, (chuckles) the man's
completely harmless. Uh...

617
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:33,032
- (speaks Mandarin)
- Uh, okay.

618
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:37,604
Could you say that again,
and this time about 80% slower?

619
00:28:37,606 --> 00:28:41,707
I said don't make me question
your loyalty. Understand?

620
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:46,178
Ay. (chuckles)
What's to question?

621
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,283
I... look, I barely
talk to the guy anyway.

622
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:49,836
Then it won't be a problem.

623
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:52,007
And work on your Mandarin,

624
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,507
I do not like to repeat
myself.

625
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,055
In any language.

626
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:57,290
LIWEN:
<i>My drones are the next step</i>

627
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,791
in Jaeger evolution.

628
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:01,794
The system I designed
processes commands

629
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:03,730
through a quantum data core.

630
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,732
This means that a single pilot

631
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:10,369
can operate the drone remotely
from anywhere in the world.

632
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:13,473
As soon as the council
approves deployment,

633
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:16,809
based on Secretary General
Mori's final report,

634
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:19,346
the days of struggling
to find and train

635
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:23,082
drift compatible pilots
will be a thing of the past.

636
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:25,284
And you think a bunch of desk
jockeys are better than us?

637
00:29:25,286 --> 00:29:27,721
We are not here
to shut you down.

638
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:29,522
Cooperation between
our programs

639
00:29:29,524 --> 00:29:31,290
has never been more vital.

640
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:33,393
If there are any questions.

641
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:36,296
- Yeah, I got a question right over here!
- (clamoring)

642
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:38,464
We are pilots,
not a bunch of office workers!

643
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:41,201
And now we're shouting.
There's no need to shout.

644
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:43,506
(clamoring continues)

645
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:48,207
JAKE:
Well, that was slick.

646
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:51,411
So, how long until all this is
shut down so I can go home?

647
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:54,080
I don't trust the tech.
Not yet, at least.

648
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:56,148
Well, it looks
pretty good to me.

649
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,786
Remote systems can be
hacked or compromised.

650
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:01,788
No, you've got
the key vote, right?

651
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,790
So there you go.
It's your decision.

652
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:08,161
I wish I could just
go ahead and approve them.

653
00:30:08,163 --> 00:30:12,499
Nearly half the council
is backing Liwen.

654
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:15,101
They aren't going to like
my decision.

655
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:18,805
Who cares what they like
and what they don't like?

656
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:21,273
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna go with you.

657
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:22,608
For moral support.

658
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,810
Plus, I want to get
out of this place.

659
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:27,813
I'm glad you offered,
because I already requested

660
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:30,549
Gipsy Avenger as honor guard
at the Council Summit.

661
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:32,751
Look, you know
Gipsy's Nate's ride.

662
00:30:32,753 --> 00:30:35,688
His copilot works for
Liwen now. He needs a new one.

663
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,192
One that you already know
is drift compatible.

664
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:41,728
All right.

665
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,730
I'll do it.
I got your back.

666
00:30:43,732 --> 00:30:45,432
But I want to be there
when you tell Nate,

667
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:46,633
'cause I just want
to see his face.

668
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:47,901
He's gonna be so pissed.

669
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:49,703
He's just gonna
stand there like,

670
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:52,204
"Yeah, I don't think
you belong in a Jaeger, Jake.

671
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:55,474
Get out of my Jaeger.
I'm handsome and sexy."

00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:22,928
How about you stop thinking
about kicking my ass?

708
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,396
Not gonna happen either.

709
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:25,932
(Lambert scoffs)

710
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,270
Gonna be a long day.

711
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:29,398
Hemispheres are calibrated, sir.

712
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:33,349

Gipsy, this is Command.

721
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:40,540
Be advised,
we have a rogue Jaeger.

power down and exit
your Conn-Pod immediately.

00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:50,517
I repeat:

726
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,322
power down and exit
your Conn-Pods now.

727
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:55,557

00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,968
It's jamming our comms!

753
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,933
She's going down!
We've gotta move!

This is Mike, Mike, Charlie,

So, I'm not really good

00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:05,264
at emotional stuff, but...

780
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:07,603
I really am sorry
about your sister.

781
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:11,237
Half sister? I...

782
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:15,273
Yeah, her family died
during the Onibaba attack.

783
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:17,909
My dad took her in.

784
00:39:17,911 --> 00:39:19,244
And she was my sister.

785
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:20,582
My family.

786
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,116
Why are you out of uniform?

787
00:39:24,118 --> 00:39:26,018
(sighs)

788
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,154
Just had a lot on my mind
after Sydney.

789
00:39:29,156 --> 00:39:31,690
Guess I just wanted
to be comfortable.

790
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:33,393
Well, don't let Ranger Lambert
see you in that.

791
00:39:33,395 --> 00:39:36,094
He might take the stick out of
his butt and beat you with it.

792
00:39:36,096 --> 00:39:37,429
I think I'm safe.

793
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:39,032
It's wedged in there
pretty tight.

795
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:43,369
So they're still using Sarah.

796
00:39:43,371 --> 00:39:45,003
Yeah.

797
00:39:45,005 --> 00:39:47,873
And I can't drift with her
for some reason.

798
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,710
All the other cadets
have been training for years

799
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:52,011
and I just...

800
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:54,346
I hate feeling
like the slow kid.

801
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:56,882
You gotta relax.
Or you're just grinding gears.

802
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:59,018
- I'll help you out.
- Got it, coach.

803
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,953
- Don't call me coach.
- All right, sensei.

804
00:40:00,955 --> 00:40:03,056
Concentrate.

805
00:40:03,058 --> 00:40:05,358
You have to make
a good connection.

806
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,263
You can't do that
if you're yappin' your gums.

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
You ready?

808
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:15,802
Ready.

809
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:18,103
All right.

Remember,
the stronger your connection,

00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:44,496
the better you fight.

00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:45,056
(echoing): Amara!
We need to break the drift!

844
00:41:45,058 --> 00:41:46,893
Jump to me! Come on!

845
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,126
I'm scared!

846
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:49,962

Hey.

00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:05,047
Are you okay?

855
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:13,319
I was there.

856
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:14,520
(sniffles)

857
00:42:14,522 --> 00:42:16,556
I felt it.

858
00:42:16,558 --> 00:42:18,424
JAKE:
Yeah.

859
00:42:18,426 --> 00:42:20,362
I felt it, too.

860

Jake, it's me.

00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:25,331
You there?

862
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,233
Yeah, I'm here.

863
00:42:27,235 --> 00:42:29,201
Meet me in the lab right away.
Marshal wants to see us.

864
00:42:29,203 --> 00:42:30,203
All right.

865
00:42:30,205 --> 00:42:31,837
I'm on my way.

866
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,005
You okay?

867
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:35,276
(sniffles, sighs)

868
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:48,353
- What is it?
- A message. From Mako.

869
00:42:48,355 --> 00:42:49,855
GOTTLIEB: She was trying
to send it from her copter

870
00:42:49,857 --> 00:42:51,424
right before it went down.

871
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:53,625
It's a data package.
High density.

872
00:42:53,627 --> 00:42:55,594
Obsidian Fury
was jamming comms.

873
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:57,128
How could her signal
get through?

874
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,297
QUAN:
It didn't.

875
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:00,398
- At least not intact.
- So it's gone?

876
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,335
GOTTLIEB: Well, "gone" is
relative in the digital realm.

877
00:43:02,337 --> 00:43:04,904
By running a modified
fractal algorithm,

878
00:43:04,906 --> 00:43:07,042
I might be able to reconstruct
a few megabytes.

879
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:12,247
There.

880
00:43:14,248 --> 00:43:16,081
Is that a Kaiju?

881
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:20,087
I'm checking against
PPDC Kaiju archives.

882
00:43:22,924 --> 00:43:24,523

883

No match against the database.

884
00:43:26,493 --> 00:43:27,994
Keep looking.

885
00:43:27,996 --> 00:43:29,661
Whatever this is,
it was important to her.

886
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,463
I want to know why.

887
00:43:31,465 --> 00:43:34,268
And I want to know who was
piloting that rogue Jaeger.

888
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:47,950
(indistinct chatter)

889
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:53,418
Hey.

890
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,288
(chuckles)
Sorry I'm, uh, I-I'm late.

891
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,290
I-I thought you were
still in Sydney.

892
00:43:56,982 --> 00:44:00,159
The council has approved Drone deployment
in an emergency session.

893
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:01,661
Oh.

894
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,061
Uh...

895
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:04,563
that's great.

896
00:44:04,565 --> 00:44:06,465
Thought you'd be a little
more enthusiastic, Doc.

897
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:09,168
Yeah, no, I'm-I'm pumped.
This is great.

898
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,036
Uh, it's just
the timing of everything,

899
00:44:11,038 --> 00:44:12,371
with the attack and all,

900
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:14,005
- feels a little...
- I was there.

901
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:16,377
I know what happened.

902
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:18,984
And it wouldn't have...

903
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:20,996
if our Drones had been in the field.

904
00:44:21,281 --> 00:44:23,017
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Neural connection terminated.

905
00:44:23,736 --> 00:44:25,265
Now everyone sees that.

906
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:27,386
Yeah.

907
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:28,623
Uh, I guess they do.

908
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,644
Which means the attack was positive...

909
00:44:30,745 --> 00:44:32,345
all things considered.

910
00:44:34,362 --> 00:44:36,462
If you look at it sideways
and you squint,

911
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:38,063
then maybe you could say that.

912
00:44:38,065 --> 00:44:39,732
Uh, I'm sorry, what are you...

913
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:40,902
what... what's going on here?

914
00:44:40,904 --> 00:44:44,310
The council expects full deployment
within 48 hours.

915
00:44:44,605 --> 00:44:46,375
(inhales)
48 is a...

916
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,953
I've worked my whole life for this.

917
00:44:48,009 --> 00:44:49,541
Get it done.

918
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:50,643
Okay.

919
00:44:50,645 --> 00:44:52,177
Yeah.

920
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:53,915
Not a problem.
That-That'll be fine.

921
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:55,957
48 hours? No way we'll be ready.

922
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,416
Y-You don't think
there's a way?

923
00:44:57,418 --> 00:44:59,184
All right, well,
then you're fired.

924
00:44:59,186 --> 00:45:00,286
Okay? How about that?

925
00:45:00,288 --> 00:45:02,154
Or maybe you're promoted.

926
00:45:02,156 --> 00:45:03,221
I don't know.
We'll see how it goes.

927
00:45:03,223 --> 00:45:04,223
Just get it done!

928
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:05,358
(frustrated groan)

929
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,058
Give me this.

930
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,129
(sighs)

931
00:45:26,214 --> 00:45:28,146
- ("I Want to Know What Love Is" plays loudly)
- Hey, honey!

932
00:45:28,148 --> 00:45:29,715
I'm home!

933
00:45:29,717 --> 00:45:30,715
Sorry I'm late.

934
00:45:30,717 --> 00:45:33,284
(groans) God, things were...

935
00:45:33,286 --> 00:45:36,054
things were crazy today,
with what happened in Sydney.

My boss almost got killed.

939
00:45:42,764 --> 00:45:44,195
That could've been bad.

940
00:45:44,197 --> 00:45:46,065
Maybe.
I guess, I don't know.

941
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:48,067
That would've been great,
actually,

942
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:49,434
that one is all over me.

943
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:51,737
I mean, I can't get
a break from her!

944
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:53,706
I'm ranting.
Enough about work.

945
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:56,275
And enough about her, really,
I should be focused on you.

946
00:45:56,277 --> 00:46:00,212
How about we have
a little fun in the bedroom?

947
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:01,547

They're calling it
Obsidian Fury.

961
00:46:31,145 --> 00:46:32,578
There's never been a rogue
like this.

962
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,645
MEILIN:
News feed said

963
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:35,713
they were posting a dozen
Jaegers at the memorial.

964
00:46:35,715 --> 00:46:37,583
When I die, I want that many
to send me off.

965
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:40,351
Your pop's gonna make you work
with boobs when you wash out.

966
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:42,855
Jaegers do not show up
when the boob guy dies.

967
00:46:42,857 --> 00:46:44,056
Wait, your dad
works with boobs?

968
00:46:44,058 --> 00:46:47,425
He's a plastic surgeon.
He doesn't just work with...

I'm gonna be a pilot.

971
00:46:49,864 --> 00:46:51,297
Still. You die,

972
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:53,398
meh, I post one Jaeger
at your funeral.

973
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,233
(laughs)

974
00:46:54,235 --> 00:46:56,601
- Maybe half a Jaeger.
- (chuckles)

975
00:46:56,603 --> 00:46:58,804
I heard that's where
they found Amara.

976
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:00,505
In half a Jaeger.

977
00:47:00,507 --> 00:47:02,373
It was a whole Jaeger.

978
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:06,415
It just wasn't very big,
Viktoriya.

979
00:47:09,717 --> 00:47:11,817
Bigger is better.

980
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:13,087

981
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:18,692
What did you say?

982
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,726
Am I saying that right?

983
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:23,561
Yep.

984
00:47:23,563 --> 00:47:24,762
- Ah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

985
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:26,465
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Guys.

986
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:27,766
I worked every day of my life
to be here.

987
00:47:27,768 --> 00:47:28,866
You didn't do anything.

988
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:30,802
You were just picked up
off the street like garbage!

989
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:32,371
- (grunting)
- Guys, come on!

990
00:47:32,373 --> 00:47:34,639
Hey, hey.

991
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:37,675
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You know where I learned that?

992
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:39,578
On the streets,
you big, dumb...

993
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,681
Ranger on deck!

994
00:47:42,782 --> 00:47:44,250
- (coughs)
- She jumped me!

995
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:45,518
She doesn't belong here!

996
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,588
I don't care!

997
00:47:48,688 --> 00:47:52,424
You know, when I first joined
the Corps, I was just like you.

998
00:47:52,426 --> 00:47:55,596
Worse. I was nobody.

999
00:47:57,531 --> 00:47:59,498
But that woman
we laid to rest today,

1000
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,735
Mako Mori, she said,
"Whoever you are,

1001
00:48:03,737 --> 00:48:05,704
"the minute you enter this
program, you join a family.

1002
00:48:05,706 --> 00:48:08,407
"And no matter what they do,

1003
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:11,713
no matter how stupid
they may act sometimes..."

1004
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,283
"...you forgive 'em
and you move on."

1005
00:48:17,817 --> 00:48:22,721
So you start believing that.
In here.

1006
00:48:22,723 --> 00:48:25,424
And you'll start believing
in a Jaeger.

1007
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:26,791
JULES:
Hey.

1008
00:48:26,793 --> 00:48:29,195
Marshal's looking for you guys.

1009
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,199
Says Gottlieb found something.

1010
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:34,900
It isn't something.

1011
00:48:34,902 --> 00:48:36,367
It's somewhere.

1012
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:38,804
Severnaya Zemlya.

1013
00:48:38,806 --> 00:48:40,806
Off Siberia's Taymyr Peninsula.

1014
00:48:40,808 --> 00:48:41,607
What's in Zemlya?

1015
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:43,409
GOTTLIEB:
Well, nothing anymore.

1016
00:48:43,411 --> 00:48:45,476
A facility roughly
in this location

1017
00:48:45,478 --> 00:48:48,447
was used to manufacture Jaeger
power cores earlier in the war.

1018
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:50,983
- But it was decommissioned years ago.
- Why would

1019
00:48:50,985 --> 00:48:53,219
Mako be trying to tell us
about an abandoned factory

1020
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,221
in the middle of nowhere?

1021
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,989
Sir, permission

I don't think
there was a breach.

00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,866
modification techniques,
probably engineered

1064
00:53:33,868 --> 00:53:36,501
from Kaiju flesh left over
from the war.

1065
00:53:36,503 --> 00:53:38,572
Precursors didn't do this.

1066
00:53:40,507 --> 00:53:41,875
Humans did.

1067
00:53:46,779 --> 00:53:47,878
SURESH:
Oh, my God.

1068
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,782
That hunk of slimy crap
was piloting Obsidian Fury?

1069
00:53:50,784 --> 00:53:52,284
AMARA:
We got to get a look inside.

1070
00:53:52,286 --> 00:53:53,518
Inside?

1071
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,920
That thing's part Kaiju.

1072
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:58,523
Come on, guys. When are we
ever gonna get a chance

1073
00:53:58,525 --> 00:53:59,824
to see something
like this again?

1074
00:53:59,826 --> 00:54:00,826
Never.

1075
00:54:00,828 --> 00:54:02,661
Never would be good.

1076
00:54:02,663 --> 00:54:03,929
You guys can stay here.

1077
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:05,230
I'm going.

1078
00:54:05,232 --> 00:54:06,864
No, Amar... Amara.

1079
00:54:06,866 --> 00:54:10,936
Guys, guys,
we should not be in here.

1080
00:54:10,938 --> 00:54:13,771
(liquid dripping)

1081
00:54:13,773 --> 00:54:15,210
Whoa.

1082
00:54:17,744 --> 00:54:20,811
It's fused all the way
through the system.

1083
00:54:20,813 --> 00:54:26,050
Like... muscle tissue.

1084
00:54:26,052 --> 00:54:29,186
JINHAI: That's how it was able
to move like it did.

1085
00:54:29,188 --> 00:54:32,690
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.

1086
00:54:32,692 --> 00:54:35,561
Working with boobs is sounding
better and better.

1087
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:38,230
Shine your light over here.

1088
00:54:38,232 --> 00:54:41,266
SURESH: Oh, yeah, let's just
go yank on the guts

1089
00:54:41,268 --> 00:54:42,904
of the weird-ass Kaiju killbot.

1090
00:54:45,706 --> 00:54:47,605
What is it?

1091
00:54:47,607 --> 00:54:49,308
- I think it's some sort of...
- (sizzles)

1092
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:50,675
- (screams)
- Jinhai!

1093
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:52,344
I told you
not to yank on those.

1094
00:54:52,346 --> 00:54:54,645
Go get help! Go!

1095
00:54:54,647 --> 00:54:56,114
SURESH:
Man, we are so screwed!

1096
00:54:56,116 --> 00:54:58,317
(muffled): This goes way past
what she did.

1097
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,884
QUAN:
The decision has been made.

1098
00:54:59,886 --> 00:55:01,219
Security will take it
from here.

1099
00:55:01,221 --> 00:55:02,891
We're done!

1100
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:06,594
(lock beeps)

1101
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,695
Is Jinhai okay?

1102
00:55:10,697 --> 00:55:12,730
He's got some scarring,
but yeah, he'll live.

1103
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:14,065
Marshal put him on probation.

1104
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:15,833
Meilin and Suresh, too.

1105
00:55:15,835 --> 00:55:17,134
They blink wrong,
all of 'em are out.

1106
00:55:17,136 --> 00:55:18,804
No, it's not their fault.

1107
00:55:18,806 --> 00:55:20,237
- I talked them into it.
- I'm sorry, I tried to talk

1108
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:21,072
to the marshal, but...

1109
00:55:21,074 --> 00:55:23,545
you're dismissed
from the program.

1110
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:27,045
Never belonged here anyway.

1111
00:55:27,047 --> 00:55:29,648
Really?

1112
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:33,150
You know, I used to say
the same thing a long time ago.

1113
00:55:33,152 --> 00:55:37,054
But I actually didn't
want to be here.

1114
00:55:37,056 --> 00:55:38,889
Still don't.

1115
00:55:38,891 --> 00:55:40,692
Why'd you sign up?

1116
00:55:40,694 --> 00:55:43,128
We were at war.

1117
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,063
And my dad
was leading the charge

1118
00:55:45,065 --> 00:55:47,898
and I thought...
maybe I could see more of him.

1119
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,637
Maybe even drift with him.

1120
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,639
Well, one night,
me and Nate got into it.

1121
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,741
It was over something stupid.
I can't even remember what.

1122
00:55:56,743 --> 00:55:59,710
So I climbed in an old Mark 4

1123
00:55:59,712 --> 00:56:02,413
just to show him I didn't
need him to be a great pilot.

1124
00:56:02,415 --> 00:56:04,349
That's pretty dumb.

1125
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,784
- Yeah.
- How far'd you get?

1126
00:56:06,786 --> 00:56:10,054
- About seven steps, well, take or leave.
- How far did you get?

1127
00:56:10,056 --> 00:56:11,989
About two steps, then
I blacked out from the strain.

1128
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:15,694
And the first thing I saw
when I woke up was my dad,

1129
00:56:15,696 --> 00:56:18,329
just standing right
in front of me, looking stern.

1130
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:20,666
Wh-What'd he say?

1131
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,166
He said I was
out of the program.

1132
00:56:22,168 --> 00:56:24,235
He said I didn't deserve
to be in a Jaeger.

1133
00:56:24,237 --> 00:56:25,973
Look, he said a lot of things.

1134
00:56:28,042 --> 00:56:30,976
A year later, my dad was gone.

1135
00:56:30,978 --> 00:56:33,445
And I didn't get a chance
to prove him wrong.

1136
00:56:33,447 --> 00:56:38,382
More importantly, I didn't get
a chance to prove it to myself.

1137
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:40,152
You listen to me.

1138
00:56:40,154 --> 00:56:41,887
Don't let what other people
think of you

1139
00:56:41,889 --> 00:56:44,221
define who you are.

1140
00:56:44,223 --> 00:56:46,257
You won't like
where that takes you.

1141
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:47,995
Do you understand?

1142
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:54,398
And keep your head up.

1143
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,300
And you might just be
as good-looking as me

1144
00:56:56,302 --> 00:56:57,469
in this type of situation.

1145
00:56:57,471 --> 00:56:59,103
- (scoffs, laughs)
- Seriously.

1146
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:01,806
This face is, is set up well.

1147
00:57:01,808 --> 00:57:04,211
Beauty is a burden.
(chuckles)

1148
00:57:06,813 --> 00:57:08,850
You'll be all right.

1149
00:57:12,252 --> 00:57:15,387
Shao Industries.

1150
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:17,054
What?

1151
00:57:17,056 --> 00:57:21,393
Obsidian Fury has tech in it
made by Shao Industries.

1152
00:57:21,395 --> 00:57:23,862
That's impossible.
Jules and her team

1153
00:57:23,864 --> 00:57:25,262
scanned every centimeter
of that Jaeger.

1154
00:57:25,264 --> 00:57:28,099
Insulating metamaterials
wound counterclockwise

1155
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:30,735
in the shunt cabling.

1156
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:32,938
Shao's the only company
that winds them that way.

1157
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,407
Amara, are you sure about what
you're telling me right now?

1158
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:37,241
Yes.

1159
00:57:37,243 --> 00:57:38,777
Yeah.

1160
00:57:38,779 --> 00:57:41,715
I stole a ton to make Scrapper.

1161
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:45,349
I thought
it might be important.

1162
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:48,253
Yeah.

1163
00:57:48,255 --> 00:57:49,954
- (lock beeps)
- Thank you.

1164
00:57:49,956 --> 00:57:51,389
GOTTLIEB:
<i>Shao Industries?</i>

1165
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:53,759
They don't even have
a bio division.

1166
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,393
Yeah, not that we know of.

1167
00:57:55,395 --> 00:57:58,063
Cabling could have been stolen,
just like in Amara's Jaeger.

1168
00:57:58,065 --> 00:58:00,297
We're gonna need more than that
to connect Fury to Shao.

1169
00:58:00,299 --> 00:58:01,766
What about Newt?

1170
00:58:01,768 --> 00:58:03,335
He'd have access
to the internal records,

1171
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:05,469
- the shipping manifests...
- JAKE: All right.

1172
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:06,971
Go see him.
Keep a low profile.

1173
00:58:06,973 --> 00:58:09,775
I have a mission?
Finally.

1174
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,013
We'll take what we know
to the marshal.

1175
00:58:17,551 --> 00:58:21,755
(announcement over speakers
in Mandarin)

1176
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:26,551
The building is secure, ma'am.

1177
00:58:26,919 --> 00:58:29,754
No visitors without the proper credentials.

1178
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:31,955
I don't want anyone interfering
with deployment.

1179
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:36,760
What is it?

1180
00:58:36,939 --> 00:58:38,840
I'll be in my office.

1181
00:58:38,842 --> 00:58:40,778
Okay.

1182
00:58:45,578 --> 00:58:47,514
This isn't fair.

1183
00:58:50,217 --> 00:58:51,916
I'm sorry.

1184
00:58:51,918 --> 00:58:53,819
You don't deserve this.

1185
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:57,188
It was my fault.

1186
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:00,761
This is on me.

1187
00:59:10,136 --> 00:59:13,270
Amara.

1188
00:59:13,272 --> 00:59:16,440
The next Jaeger you build...

1189
00:59:16,442 --> 00:59:18,513
make it a big one.

1190
00:59:26,219 --> 00:59:28,156
(helicopter blades whirring)

1191
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:32,023
AUTOMATED VOICE:
System online.

1192
00:59:32,025 --> 00:59:35,994
And we have delivery
at 100%, people.

1193
00:59:35,996 --> 00:59:37,895
- System online.
- A hundred percent!

1194
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:39,898
That's the way
that it's done, okay?

1195
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,000
- I told you we could do it, and we did it!
- (beeping)

1196
00:59:42,002 --> 00:59:43,000
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Malfunction.

1197
00:59:43,002 --> 00:59:45,003
I'm losing uplink to drone 375!

1198
00:59:45,005 --> 00:59:45,938
- Why?
- Malfunction.

1199
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,505
- (Burke grunting)
- Why? Figure out why!

1200
00:59:48,507 --> 00:59:50,641
QUAN: We'll take what we know
to the council in person.

1201
00:59:50,643 --> 00:59:52,312
Prep a transport.

1202
00:59:54,147 --> 00:59:55,583
Give me a second.

1203
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:57,698
The Drones in the field are malfunctioning!

1204
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,461
Stop the ones coming in from deploying!

1205
01:00:02,022 --> 01:00:03,958
(electricity crackling)

1206
01:00:07,527 --> 01:00:09,530
- Get to Gipsy! Go!
- (alarm wailing)

1207
01:00:17,237 --> 01:00:20,938
(drone roaring)

1208
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,940
(over P.A.):
All pilots,

1209
01:00:22,942 --> 01:00:24,878
man your Jaegers
and engage hostiles!

1210
01:00:35,154 --> 01:00:36,089
(drone squeals)

1211
01:00:40,594 --> 01:00:42,460
Okay, you got this.
You cool?

1212
01:00:42,462 --> 01:00:44,658
Yeah, super cool.
Just, uh, just stay calm.

1213
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,387
Doctor Geiszler! Shao's looking for you?

1214
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:47,398
I-I know. I'm heading up!
I'm heading right...

1215
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,567
Hermann.

1216
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:52,369
Uh, what are you doing here?
How'd you get in here?

1217
01:00:52,371 --> 01:00:54,105
I do have PPDC credentials,
and besides,

1218
01:00:54,107 --> 01:00:55,540
everyone else seems
a little bit preoccupied

1219
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:57,478
with the killer drones
your boss just set off!

1220
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:05,653
(grunts)

1221
01:01:14,194 --> 01:01:16,130
- (amplified panting)
- (muffled shouting, screaming)

1222
01:01:26,706 --> 01:01:29,239
- She used you.
- No.

1223
01:01:29,241 --> 01:01:31,643
- She lured you with money and a fancy title.
- No. No way.

1224
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:33,511
And while you were
basking in the glow,

1225
01:01:33,513 --> 01:01:35,713
she took your research
and she twisted it.

1226
01:01:35,715 --> 01:01:38,116
Help me stop her, Newton.

1227
01:01:38,118 --> 01:01:40,085
Help me save the world
like old times.

1228
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:42,320
All right, technically, uh,
you were helping me last time.

1229
01:01:42,322 --> 01:01:44,489
- Let's get that straight.
- Fine.

1230
01:01:44,491 --> 01:01:46,324
Help me help you
save the world.

1231
01:01:46,326 --> 01:01:47,592
What do you say?

1232
01:01:47,594 --> 01:01:50,161
Well, I say, um, I say...
Don't shoot!

1233
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:52,396

1583
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:34,211
Hey, guys, we could use
a little help over here!

1584
01:21:34,213 --> 01:21:37,180
- Right now!
- Copy that, Saber.

1585
01:21:37,182 --> 01:21:39,248
Vik, take out Shrikethorn.

1586
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,719
On it.

1587
01:21:53,531 --> 01:21:55,899
Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo
coming to assist!

1588
01:21:55,901 --> 01:21:58,371
Activating arc whip!

Yeah, that's right!

1591
01:22:16,989 --> 01:22:18,421
You better run!

1592
01:22:18,423 --> 01:22:20,259
These things ain't that tough.

1593
01:22:30,569 --> 01:22:32,668
Bracer Phoenix, watch your six!

1594
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,804

1597
01:22:40,846 --> 01:22:42,378
Yeah!

01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:43,615
Whoo!

1600
01:22:54,526 --> 01:22:56,659
Okay, we're going
with giant robots again.

1601
01:22:56,661 --> 01:22:58,828
All right, real original, guys.

1602
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:00,564
I'm not impressed.

We've got movement!

1607
01:23:13,779 --> 01:23:15,845
Multiple hostiles,
three kilometers southeast.

1608
01:23:15,847 --> 01:23:17,014
Liwen!

1609
01:23:17,016 --> 01:23:17,948
Are you reading this?

1610
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:20,352
That's one of my automated

1611
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:23,819
It was Newt.

1612
01:23:23,821 --> 01:23:25,622
He's in Tokyo.

Copy, Guardian.

You just stay put,

1660
01:26:46,657 --> 01:26:48,824

JAKE: No time.
Can you locate the brains?

1677
01:27:25,129 --> 01:27:26,729
Hostile's central brain mass
is heavily armored.

1678

Your weapons
won't be able to penetrate.

1761
01:33:26,391 --> 01:33:30,092
Gottlieb, do you have enough
fuel left in your thrusters

1762
01:33:30,094 --> 01:33:32,095
- to launch us into the atmosphere?
- The atmosphere?

1763
01:33:32,097 --> 01:33:33,962
- Yeah.
- Possibly, but there won't be

1764
01:33:33,964 --> 01:33:36,299
- enough to slow your reentry.
- We don't need to slow down.

1765
01:33:36,301 --> 01:33:39,135
We're gonna drop Gipsy
right on top of that thing.

1766
01:33:39,137 --> 01:33:40,435
I just ejected my escape pod.

1767
01:33:40,437 --> 01:33:43,538
Yeah. We'll have to use mine.

1768
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:46,175
Jake, there's only one thruster
with enough fuel remaining.

1769
01:33:46,177 --> 01:33:48,010
- Sending location.
- All right, checking.

1770
01:33:48,012 --> 01:33:50,546
We're too far away.

1771
01:33:50,548 --> 01:33:52,916
We're not gonna make it.

1772
01:33:52,918 --> 01:33:55,018

Transport inbound!

1773

Move them little legs!

AMARA:
The thruster's way too strong.

1781
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,193
There's no way
we can hold on to it!

1782
01:34:37,195 --> 01:34:39,127
JAKE:
Liwen, what do you got?

1783
01:34:39,129 --> 01:34:40,997
I can weld it to your hand.

1784
01:34:40,999 --> 01:34:42,564
I upgraded Scrapper's weapons.

1785
01:34:42,566 --> 01:34:44,367
Nice. I was actually
gonna do that.

1786
01:34:44,369 --> 01:34:46,538
- No, you wasn't.
- Yes, I was.

1787
01:34:54,178 --> 01:34:55,444
We only got one shot at this.

1788
01:34:55,446 --> 01:34:57,482
Yeah! Then let's make it count.

1789
01:35:04,188 --> 01:35:06,025
(Amara shouting)

1790
01:35:12,163 --> 01:35:14,229
- I'm stuck!
- Stay there!

1791
01:35:14,231 --> 01:35:15,935
You're an extra ton
we can drop on that thing!

1792

Jake, Amara, you need to eject!

1810
01:36:33,812 --> 01:36:36,244
- (Amara grunts)
- Disconnect!

1811
01:36:36,246 --> 01:36:38,680
Amara, disconnect!

1812
01:36:38,682 --> 01:36:41,083

1827

Well, I had a lot of help.

1856
01:39:21,512 --> 01:39:23,815
- Nice work, Ranger Namani.
- Thank you, sir.

1857
01:39:28,886 --> 01:39:31,453

- So out of all the things

you're noticing snow?

Did everyone think it was dumb
or is that just your opinion...

1864
01:39:42,566 --> 01:39:44,332
Just be honest, how many times
did you practice that in front

1865
01:39:44,334 --> 01:39:45,268
- of the mirror?
- It was motivational.
