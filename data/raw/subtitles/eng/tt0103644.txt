1
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:07,794
Stasis interrupted
Fire in cryogenic compartment

2
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,381
Repeat.
Fire in cryogenic compartment

3
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,384
All personnel report to...

4
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,179
...emergency escape vehicle.

5
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:23,017
Launch of the escape lifeboat
will commence...

6
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,021
...in T-minus 20 seconds.

7
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,386
An E.E.V.'s come down.

8
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,539
Get down to the beach.
There may be others.

9
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,849
Now.

10
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,948
Talk to me.

11
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,952
Come on. Come on.

12
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,267
Hey, Frank. Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

13
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,352
Wait.

14
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,175
Get goin', Frank. Get in there.

15
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,152
Oh. Jesus Christ.

16
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,597
Hell of a way to make a landing.

17
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,199
Use the torch.

18
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:58,078
How many?
Don't know.

19
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,981
Three. Maybe four.

20
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:04,319
Hey, Frank. Can we hurry this up?
It's gonna be 40 below in five minutes.

21
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,094
All right, all right.
Let's get it going.

22
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,575
Keep it together.
Come on. Right.

23
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,210
Right. Here we go, Mr. Dillon.

24
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,922
Give us strength,
O Lord, to endure.

25
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:55,453
We recognize that we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry God.

26
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,831
Let the circle be unbroken...

27
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,015
...until the day.

28
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,022
Amen.
Amen.

29
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,974
Thank you, gentlemen.
This is rumour control.

30
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,617
Here are the facts.

31
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,203
As some of you know,

32
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,665
a 337 model E.E.V....

33
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,960
...crash-landed here at 0600...

34
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,629
...on the morning watch.

35
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,257
There was one survivor,

36
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,704
two dead and a droid that was
hopelessly smashed beyond repair.

37
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,389
The survivor is a woman.

38
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,044
That's what I saw.

39
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,713
I just want to say that I've taken
a vow of celibacy.

40
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,090
So have we all.
That also includes women.

41
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,301
Yes.
We've all taken the vow.

42
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,012
Shut your gob, Morse.
I'd like to say that I, for one,

43
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,598
do not appreciate company policy
allowing her to freely...

44
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,808
...intermingle with inmates
and the rest of the staff.

45
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:03,563
What brother means to say is we view
the presence of any outsider,

46
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,292
especially a woman,
as a violation of the harmony,

47
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,278
a potential break in the spiritual unity.

48
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,989
We are well aware
of your feelings in this matter.

49
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,702
You will be pleased to know
that I have requested a rescue team.

50
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,413
Hopefully, they will be here
inside of a week-

51
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,558
Oh, come on.
and evacuate her A.S.A.P.

52
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,642
Don't give us that.

53
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,505
What's her medical status?

54
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,507
She doesn't seem too badly damaged.

55
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,427
She's unconscious. Can't give you
a more specific diagnosis at the moment.

56
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,332
Will she live?
- I would think so.

57
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,642
Look. It's in everybody's interest...

58
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,010
...the woman doesn't come
out of the infirmary...

59
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,479
...until the rescue team arrives.

60
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,348
And certainly not without an escort, right?

61
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:49,901
Sir.

62
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:54,336
Gentlemen, we should all stick
to our set routine...

63
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,533
...and not get unduly agitated.

64
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,118
Right.
Correct?

65
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,096
All right.
Thank you, gentlemen.

66
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,477
All right.

67
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:14,111
Better get here soon
or there ain't gonna be much left.

68
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,061
What's that?

69
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,343
It's just a little cocktail of my own mix.
Sort of eye-opener.

70
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,861
You a doctor?

71
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,474
My name is Clemens.
I'm the chief medical officer here.

72
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,617
Here?
Fury 161.

73
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,064
It's one of Weyland-Yutani's
backwater work prisons,

74
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,164
it grieves me to say.

75
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,166
Do you mind?

76
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,797
This is basically a stabilizer.

77
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,800
I really ought to shave your head.

78
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,371
We have a big problem with lice here.

79
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,998
And when you're feeling better,
I'll give you some clippers,

80
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:31,093
and you can tend to
your private parts yourself.

81
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,545
How'd I get here?

82
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,231
You crash-landed in an E.E.V.

83
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,803
Evidently separated from your mother ship
before you hit our atmosphere.

84
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,223
You have any idea
how long you were in hypersleep?

85
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,975
'Cause coming out the way you did
can be quite a jolt to the system.

86
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,520
Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks.
Indeed.

87
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,360
Where are the others?
- They didn't make it.

88
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,545
What?
- They didn't survive.

89
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,635
I have to get to the ship.

90
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,789
Have to get to the ship.
- You're in no condition for that.

91
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,751
You want to get me some clothes,
or should I just go like this?

92
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,711
Given the nature of our
indigenous population,

93
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,851
I would suggest clothes.

94
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,841
None of them have seen a woman in years.

95
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,000
Neither have I, for that matter.

96
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,353
This used to be a 5,000 convict facility,

97
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,025
but it's been reduced
to a custodial staff of 25.

98
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,068
Why?

99
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,333
Keep the pilot light on.
The pilot light for what?

100
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,841
Blast furnace. Natural methane.

101
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,553
We have a foundry,
Lieutenant Ripley.

102
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:52,000
The inmates forge lead sheets
for toxic waste containers.

103
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,851
How do you know my name?

104
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,714
It's stencilled on the back of your shorts.

105
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,283
Release the cable.

106
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,912
Where are the bodies?
We have a morgue.

107
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,655
We put them there
until the investigative team arrives...

108
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:32,916
...in about a week, I think.

109
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,271
There was a droid.
Disconnected.

110
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,841
There were bits and pieces of him
all over the place.

111
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,010
We put what was left on the rubbish tip.

112
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,472
The corporal was impaled
by that safety support.

113
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,515
He never knew what hit him.

114
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,992
And the girl?

115
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,412
She drowned in her cryo-tube.

116
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,916
I don't think she was conscious
when it happened.

117
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,170
Um, I'm sorry.

118
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,815
What's the matter?

119
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,278
Where is she?
In the morgue.

120
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,363
I have to see her.

121
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,601
I have to see what's left of her.

122
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,652
Is there any particular reason
that you're so insistent?

123
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,880
Yes. I have to be sure how she died.

124
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,034
I hate to be repetitious
about such a sensitive subject,

125
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,262
but it is perfectly clear that she drowned.

126
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,560
Was she your daughter?

127
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,941
No. She wasn't.

128
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,816
Um-

129
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,303
C-Could I have a moment alone, please?

130
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,403
Yes, of course.

131
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,564
Forgive me.

132
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,382
What's she doing?

133
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,897
Okay?

134
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,191
No.

135
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,178
We have to do an autopsy.

136
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,972
What?
I told you,

137
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,962
we have to make sure how she died.

138
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,036
And I told you, she drowned.

139
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,667
I'm not so sure.
I-I have to see inside of her.

140
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,154
You're disorientated.
Half your system's still in-

141
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,239
I have a very,
very good reason.

142
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,164
Well, perhaps you'd like to
share that reason.

143
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,555
Possible contagion.

144
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,516
What kind exactly?

145
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,601
Cholera.
- Cholera?

146
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:55,369
There hasn't been a case of cholera
reported for 200 years.

147
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,825
Please.

148
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:41,323
Everything's in place.

149
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,784
There's no sign of infection.

150
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,579
No indication of disease.
Chest.

151
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,663
Open the chest.

152
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,133
Careful.

153
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,833
Lungs.

154
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,213
Flooded with fluid.

155
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,342
Ergo, she drowned.

156
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,311
Now, since I'm not a complete idiot,

157
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:58,071
would you like to tell me
what we're really looking for?

158
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,493
Mr. Clemens.

159
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,577
Superintendent.

160
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,568
I don't believe you've met
Lieutenant Ripley.

161
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,653
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

162
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,157
That's right, sir.
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

163
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,258
Well, first-...

164
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:28,164
...the lieutenant is feeling much better,
I'm happy to say.

165
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,750
Second, in the interest of public health,

166
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,502
I am performing an autopsy.
Without my authority.

167
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,005
Well, there didn't seem to be time.

168
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,007
But it's turned out all right.

169
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,509
There's no sign of contagion in the body.
Good.

170
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,278
But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley...

171
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:44,347
...didn't parade around in
front of the prisoners,

172
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,557
as I am told she did in the last hour.

173
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,559
It might also be helpful...

174
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,687
...if you kept me informed as to
any change in her physical status.

175
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,190
Or would that be asking too much?

176
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,135
We have to cremate the bodies.
- Nonsense. We'll keep the bodies on ice...

177
00:22:58,235 --> 00:22:59,654
...till the rescue team arrives.

178
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:04,132
On ice.
- There is the public health issue.

179
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:11,186
The lieutenant feels that there is still
a possibility of a communicable infection.

180
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,542
I thought you said
there was no sign of disease.

181
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,753
It would appear that the child drowned.

182
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,381
But without the benefit
of proper laboratory tests,

183
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,383
it's impossible to be absolutely certain.

184
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,718
I would consider it unwise...

185
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,555
...to tolerate even the possibility
of an unwelcome virus.

186
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:31,143
An outbreak of cholera
would look extremely bad on a report.

187
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,536
Would it not, sir?

188
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,608
We've 25 prisoners in this facility.

189
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,793
All double-y-chromos.

190
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:44,073
All thieves, rapists,
murderers, child molesters. All scum.

191
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:48,911
Just because they've taken on religion
doesn't make them any less dangerous.

192
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,414
I try not to offend their convictions.

193
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,234
I don't want to upset the order.

194
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,586
I don't want ripples in the water.

195
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:02,690
And I don't want a woman walking around
giving them ideas.

196
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,820
I see. For my own personal safety.

197
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,988
Exactly.

198
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:15,217
I will leave the details of the cremation
to you, Mr. Clemens.

199
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,068
They may use the furnace, but I want
everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours.

200
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,211
You called it, sir.

201
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,535
Ah, Christmas has come early, Murph.

202
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:52,725
What do you mean?

203
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,828
Any dead ox is a good ox.
- You're bloody right.

204
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,148
Smelly bastards, all covered in lice.

205
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:03,235
There's only seven of the friggin' things left,
and then we're done with them.

206
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,613
God, I hates hosin' these bastards down.

207
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,199
I always get shite all over me boots.

208
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,911
Talkin' of hosing things down, Frank-

209
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:11,410
Yeah?

210
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,079
You had the chance,
what would you say to her?

211
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,885
What do you mean,
if I got the chance?

212
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:16,415
You know.

213
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,293
If you got the chance.
You mean, casual like?

214
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,172
Yeah. I mean, how would you
put it to her if you bumped into her...

215
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,631
...in the mess hall or somewhere?

216
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,731
No problem.

217
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,762
I've never had any problem with the ladies.

218
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,765
I'd say to her, Good day, my dear.
How's it goin'?

219
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,476
Anything I can do to be of service?

220
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,521
Then I'd give her the look,
you know- up and down.

221
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:41,982
And I'd give her the wink,
the dirty smile.

222
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,527
She'd soon get the picture.
Yeah, right.

223
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:48,280
And then she'd say,
Kiss my ass, you horny old fucker.

224
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,049
I'd be happy to kiss her ass.

225
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,119
I'd be happy to kiss her
anywhere she wants.

226
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,493
Yeah, but treat 'em mean,
keep 'em keen. Right, Frank?

227
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:58,999
Told you before, Murph.

228
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,836
Treat a queen like a whore
and a whore like a queen.

229
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,772
Can't go wrong.

230
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:09,525
What do you think killed Babe?

231
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,245
Beats me. She just keeled over.

232
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,865
How old was she?
The charts say 1 1.

233
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,994
In her prime. Never mind.

234
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,285
We'll chop her up later
and throw her in the stew.

235
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:25,985
Right.

236
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,086
Hey, Frank.

237
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,673
What's this?

238
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,154
We commit this child...

239
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,824
...and this man to your keeping, O Lord.

240
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,077
Their bodies...

241
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:48,207
...have been taken
from the shadow of our nights.

242
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,755
They have been released...

243
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,967
...from all darkness and pain.

244
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,308
The child and the man...

245
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:09,979
...have gone beyond our world.

246
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,858
They are forever eternal...

247
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,152
...and everlasting.

248
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:28,831
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

249
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,669
Why?

250
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,464
Why are the innocent punished?

251
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,972
Why the sacrifice?

252
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,643
Why the pain?

253
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,024
There aren't any promises.

254
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,237
Nothing's certain.

255
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:04,450
Only that some get called,
some get saved.

256
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:09,330
She won't ever know
the hardship and grief...

257
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,049
...for those of us left behind.

258
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,795
We commit these bodies to the void...

259
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,339
...with a glad heart.

260
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,269
For within each seed,

261
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,988
there is a promise of a flower.

262
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:39,861
And within each death,

263
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:44,198
no matter how small,

264
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,534
there's always a new life.

265
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,249
A new beginning.

266
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,005
Amen.

267
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,218
Amen.

268
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,180
I'll tell you, it's fucking weird.

269
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,862
The only one to survive
that crash is a woman.

270
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,073
What trouble can she cause?

271
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,075
She's already changed everything.

272
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,920
What the fuck are we supposed to do-

273
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,022
I, for one-

274
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,651
I mean it.

275
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,233
Okay.

276
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:47,264
There's a lot of talk going around
that we've got some disharmony here?

277
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:51,101
Any you guys want to tell me
what the problem is?

278
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,046
Come on.
Speak to me, brothers.

279
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,501
All right. I'll tell ya.

280
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,032
I don't mind the dark.
I don't mind the bugs.

281
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:09,202
I don't mind wanderin' around in some
cold, wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time.

282
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,617
I don't mind anything.
But I mind Golic.

283
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,292
That the way you feel about it?

284
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:18,462
Yeah. The guy's crazy and he smells bad.

285
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:23,149
I ain't going out with him anymore.

286
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,864
You got anything to say for yourself?

287
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,328
Well, he's going with you.

288
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,575
Golic is just another poor, miserable,

289
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:41,360
suffering son of a bitch,
just like you and me.

290
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,612
'Cept he smells worse.
And he's crazy.

291
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,172
Knock off the shit.

292
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:50,301
You got a job to do.

293
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:54,210
I don't want to hear
another word about Golic.

294
00:32:55,891 --> 00:33:00,853
Okay?

295
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,455
Well, hello.

296
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,831
As I thought, Mr. Aaron.

297
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,126
As I thought.
You called it, sir.

298
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:17,075
I just wanted to, uh, say thanks
for what you said at the funeral.

299
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:18,623
It was, uh-

300
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,584
My friends would have appreciated it.

301
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,462
Yeah, well, you don't wanna know me, lady.

302
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:27,648
I'm a murderer and rapist of women.

303
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,777
Really?

304
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:37,324
Well, I guess I must make you nervous.

305
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:56,427
Do you have any faith, sister?
- Not much.

306
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:01,390
Well, we've got a lot of faith here.
Enough even for you.

307
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,086
I thought women weren't allowed.

308
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,088
Well, we've never had any before,

309
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:10,441
but we tolerate anybody.

310
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:15,154
Even the intolerable.
- Thank you.

311
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:19,909
That's just a statement of principle.
Nothing personal.

312
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,313
You see, we've got
a good place to wait here.

313
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:27,041
And until now, no temptation.

314
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,507
What are you waiting for?

315
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,057
Huh.

316
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,504
We're waiting for God to return...

317
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:51,440
...and raise his servants to redemption.

318
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:58,530
Dillon and the rest
of the alternative people...

319
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:03,205
...embraced religion, as it were,
about five years ago.

320
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,372
Tincture?
I'm on medication.

321
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,963
Hardly.
What kind of religion?

322
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:14,489
Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian,
Christian fundamentalist, uh-

323
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,924
Right.
Exactly.

324
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,828
Point is, when the company
wanted to close the facility down,

325
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:23,582
Dillon and the rest of the converts
wanted to stay.

326
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,810
And they were allowed
to remain as custodians...

327
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,813
...with two minders...

328
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,565
...and a medical officer.

329
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,734
And here we are.

330
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,304
How did you get
this wonderful assignment?

331
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,213
How do you like your new haircut?

332
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,245
It's okay.

333
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,959
Now that I've gone out on a limb
for you with Andrews,

334
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,296
damaged my already less-than-perfect
relationship with that good man,

335
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,814
and briefed you...

336
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,735
...on the humdrum history of Fury 1 61,

337
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,180
can you not tell me
what you were looking for in the girl?

338
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,324
You attracted to me?

339
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,492
ln what way?

340
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,663
ln that way.

341
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,001
Very direct.

342
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,680
I've been out here a long time.

343
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,050
So have I.

344
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:51,602
In the year 7510...

345
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,854
...If God's a-comin'...

346
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,608
...He oughta make it by then...

347
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,278
...Maybe he'll look around and say...

348
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,656
...Guess it's time for the Judgment-

349
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,556
Yech.

350
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,561
In the year

351
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:44,571
Hey, Spike.
Spike? Spikey.

352
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,058
Are you down there?
What are you doing?

353
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,519
I really appreciate your affections,

354
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:46,128
but I am aware that they...
deflected my question.

355
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,156
In the nicest possible way, of course.

356
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,809
You're spoiling the mood.

357
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,730
I have a job to do.

358
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,175
I just want to know why
we had to cremate the bodies.

359
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,652
And now that I'm in your cot,

360
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,098
you think I owe you an answer.

361
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,908
I think you owe me an answer.

362
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,186
Being in my bed's got nothing to do with it.

363
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:21,543
I had a terrible dream in hypersleep.

364
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,364
And I had to be sure what killed her.

365
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,715
Anyway, I made a mistake.

366
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,593
Possibly.

367
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:33,722
And now I've made another mistake.

368
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,806
Really? What's that?

369
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,435
Fraternizing with a prisoner.

370
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,770
Physical contact.
It's against the rules, isn't it?

371
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,902
Definitely. When was this?

372
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,571
l think you know.

373
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,912
I'm not a prisoner.

374
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,613
You have a bar code
on the back of your head.

375
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,186
That does deserve an explanation.

376
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,012
But I don't think now is the moment.

377
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:20,227
Sorry. We are rather
spoiling things, aren't we?

378
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,605
Mr. Clemens.

379
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,004
Mr. Aaron.
Superintendent Andrews...

380
00:41:28,104 --> 00:41:29,637
...would like you to report...

381
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,475
...to vent shaft 22
on the second quadrant- now.

382
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,602
We've had an accident.
Something serious?

383
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:41,039
You could call it that.
One of our prisoners has been... diced.

384
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,876
Sorry. I have to go.

385
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,256
Official duties.

386
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:21,121
Who was it?
- Murphy.

387
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,206
How do you know?

388
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,792
That's his boot.

389
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,240
I gave him the assignment, sir.
He was a wanker.

390
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,165
No apologies, Mr. Aaron.
It wasn't your fault.

391
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,714
Well, not much to say, is there?

392
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,858
Death was instantaneous.
No shit.

393
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,303
I take it he was pulled into the fan.

394
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,347
Sudden rush of air,
I'd imagine, except-

395
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,516
Right.
Almost happened to me once.

396
00:42:56,616 --> 00:43:01,036
I've told him so many times,
Stay away from the fans.

397
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,079
Nobody bloody listens.

398
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,208
Except the fan was blowing.

399
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,243
What's that?
- I don't know.

400
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:21,888
I want to see you in my quarters
in 30 minutes, if you'll please, Mr. Clemens.

401
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,522
Have you got any ideas?

402
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:17,138
Here you are. You know,
wandering around without an escort...

403
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:21,059
...is really gonna piss
Superintendent Andrews off.

404
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,478
Will you tell me about your accident?

405
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:27,205
One of the prisoners has been killed.

406
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,666
Really? How?
Hmm.

407
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,294
In the air shaft.

408
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,608
Poor soul backed into a nine-foot fan.

409
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,368
I found something at the accident site,

410
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:41,887
just a bit away from where it happened.

411
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:45,557
A mark. A burn.

412
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:51,564
Rather like the one you found
on the girl's cryo-tube.

413
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,238
Look. I'm on your side.

414
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:03,810
I want to help, but I need to know
what's going on...

415
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,715
...or what you think is going on.

416
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,900
lf you really wanna help,

417
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,152
find me a computer
with audio capabilities...

418
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,363
...so I can access this flight recorder.

419
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,615
We don't have anything like that here.

420
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,867
Well, what about Bishop?
Bishop?

421
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,453
The droid that crashed with me.

422
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,914
I can point you in the right direction.

423
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,015
I can't join you.

424
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,310
I have a previous engagement.

425
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,732
This'll top you up.
Golic, don't fidget.

426
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:40,695
What's all this shit?
It's not properly wrapped.

427
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,677
What the hell does he ever do right?

428
00:45:42,777 --> 00:45:42,932
Eat.

429
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,309
He's got that down pretty good.
Golic.

430
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,829
You light a candle for Murphy.
I'll light a thousand.

431
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,501
He was special.

432
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,879
Never complained about me once.

433
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,006
I loved him.

434
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,929
Is it true what they say?

435
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,374
His head split into a million pieces?

436
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,184
Okay. Who's got the matches?

437
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:18,024
Sit down, Mr. Clemens.
- Thank you.

438
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,861
Sugar?
Uh, no thanks.

439
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,448
Milk?
Just a little, please.

440
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,246
Thank you, Mr. Aaron.

441
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,242
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

442
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:47,371
You screw with me
one more time, I'll cut you in half.

443
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,499
I'm sorry.
I don't think I understand.

444
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,627
At 0700 hours, I received word
from the network.

445
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,546
I may point out this is the first
high-level communication...

446
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,759
...this installation has ever received,
to my knowledge.

447
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,761
They want this woman looked after.

448
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,182
They consider her to be very high priority.

449
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:04,555
Why?

450
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,948
l have no idea.

451
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:10,311
But why did you let her
out of the infirmary?

452
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,563
This accident with Murphy
is what happens...

453
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,470
...when one of these dumb
sons of a bitches...

454
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,650
...walks around with a hard-on.

455
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,470
I'm a doctor. You're the jailer.

456
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,840
We both know exactly what you are.

457
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,078
Sit down.
I think it might be better if I left.

458
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,889
I find you...
unpleasant to be around.

459
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,335
You do? Isn't that lovely?
Consider this, Mr. Clemens.

460
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:37,505
How would you like me to explain
your sordid history...

461
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,900
...to your newfound friend?

462
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,735
For her personal edification, of course.

463
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,446
Now sit the hell down.

464
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,229
I don't like you.
You're unpredictable.

465
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,046
Insolent. Possibly dangerous.

466
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,007
You question everything.

467
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:08,536
If I didn't need a medical officer,

468
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,871
I wouldn't let you within
light years of this operation.

469
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,166
I'm eternally grateful.
- Keep your sarcasms to yourself.

470
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:18,269
Now, is there anything I should know?

471
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,150
About what?
About the woman.

472
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:25,720
Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens.
You spend every second you can with her.

473
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:31,770
And I have my suspicions not all of
your concerns with her are medical.

474
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:35,999
Has she said anything to you- anything...

475
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:38,566
...about where she's
from, what her mission is?

476
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,818
What the hell she was doing in an E.E.V.?

477
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,696
She told me she was part of a combat unit
that came to grief.

478
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,282
Beyond that, I assume it's all classified.

479
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,718
I haven't pressed her for more.

480
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,803
That's all?
That's all.

481
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,972
You're sure?
Yes.

482
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:57,183
Nothing more?
No.

483
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,897
Get out of here.

484
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,050
Shut up, you fuckin' bitch.

485
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,495
Get in there.
- Shut up, you bitch.

486
00:50:56,595 --> 00:51:00,750
Nobody's gonna hear you.
- Goddamn it, let go of me.

487
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,434
Fuck you. No.

488
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,563
Hold still. Shh. Shh.

489
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,382
No. Goddamn it.

490
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,324
You okay?

491
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,620
No. Son of a bitch.

492
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:32,380
Take off. I gotta re-educate
some of the brothers.

493
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,374
We've gotta discuss
some matters of the spirit.

494
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,813
Cigarettes.

495
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,749
So let's do it.

496
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,591
This is like 1 0 city blocks.

497
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:25,099
How many?
This makes 1 76.

498
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,753
Can't you chew a little quieter?

499
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,005
I'm trying to figure out
how big this compartment is.

500
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,925
I can't think with all this
goddamn noise you're making.

501
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,845
You're not supposed to swear.
I'm sorry.

502
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:39,947
Now, we've encircled
this entire compartment once-

503
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:40,349
Hey.

504
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,909
What?

505
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,816
What the shit is doing that?

506
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,651
Swearing.
Shut up.

507
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,237
It's all right to say shit.
It ain't against God.

508
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:56,992
What the hell is going on with the candles?

509
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,997
Must be the wind
from one of the vent shafts.

510
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,875
Backwash from the closest circulating unit.

511
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,294
But if all the candles go out,
how the hell we gonna know...

512
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:08,961
...where we are?

513
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:12,339
Somebody will just have to
go back and relight them.

514
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,233
I guess I'm nominated.

515
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,578
Watch your step, brother.

516
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:40,466
Okay, who are the comedians?

517
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,513
Wait, wait, wait.

518
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,915
Quick, grab it. Here.
- Help me. Help me.

519
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,521
Go. Fuckin' go.

520
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,902
Go, go, go. Quick. Run.

521
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,121
Gimme that.

522
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,440
Get this fucking thing off me.

523
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,749
Oh, fuck.

524
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,834
Let me go.

525
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,895
Hey.

526
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:42,481
Ah, Ripley.

527
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:46,194
Hi, Bishop.
How you feeling?

528
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,278
My legs hurt.

529
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,531
Uh, listen, I'm sorry.

530
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:53,185
It's okay.
I'm just a glorified toaster.

531
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,286
How are you?

532
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,915
I like your new haircut.

533
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,235
Bishop, can you access data
on the flight recorder?

534
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,335
No problem.

535
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,322
Golic?

536
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:39,330
I'm home.
What happened on the Sulaco?

537
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,025
Why were our cryo-tubes ejected?

538
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,669
Stasis interrupted.

539
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:48,631
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

540
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:52,242
Repeat. Fire in cryogenic- What happened?

541
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,852
What started the fire, Bishop?

542
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,931
Can you hear me?

543
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,265
The fire was electrical.

544
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,562
lt was in the subflooring.

545
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,140
Did the sensors pick up anything...

546
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,217
...moving around on the
ship prior to separation?

547
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,762
It's very dark here, Ripley.
I'm not what I used to be.

548
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:15,241
Just tell me. Does the recorder
indicate anything?

549
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,785
Was there an alien on board?

550
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,287
Yes.

551
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:28,530
Is it on the Sulaco or did it
come with us on the E.E.V.?

552
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,924
It was with us all the way.

553
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,234
Does the company know?

554
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,513
The company knows everything
that happened on the ship.

555
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,976
It all goes into the computer
and gets sent back to network.

556
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,076
And they want it.

557
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:05,416
I hurt. Do me a favour.
Disconnect me.

558
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,571
I could be reworked,
but I'll never be top of the line again.

559
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,339
I'd rather be nothing.

560
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,925
You're sure?

561
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,305
Do it for me, Ripley.

562
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:37,323
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

563
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:41,535
It was- It was the dragon.

564
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,788
Feeds on minds. It was-

565
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:46,233
Nobody can stop it.
What about Boggs and Rains?

566
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,652
They got s-slaughtered like pigs.
It wasn't me.

567
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:53,506
It wasn't me.
- Stark raving mad.

568
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,243
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault,
but he should have been chained up.

569
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:59,663
You called it, sir.
Mad as a fucking hatter.

570
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:03,542
Keep him separated from the rest.
I don't want him causing a panic.

571
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,381
Clemens,
sedate this poor idiot.

572
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:05,794
Yeah?

573
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,296
Not until we know about the brothers.

574
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:12,259
Now, now. Pull yourself together.
Talk to me now.

575
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,220
Now, where are Boggs and Rains?
It wasn't me.

576
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,222
Hopeless. You're not gonna
get anything out of him.

577
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,252
It wasn't me.
We'll have to send out...

578
01:00:19,352 --> 01:00:20,142
...a search team.

579
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,561
I'm afraid we'll have to assume
there's a very good chance...

580
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:26,146
...this simple bastard has murdered them.

581
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,250
Now, you don't know that.

582
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:33,003
He's never lied to me.

583
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:36,828
He's crazy, he's a fool,
but he's not a liar.

584
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,719
He's telling the truth.

585
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:43,915
I'd like to talk to him about this- this dragon.

586
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,760
It was a dragon.
- You're not talking...

587
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,960
...to anyone, Lieutenant.

588
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,921
I'm not interested in your opinion,

589
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,132
because you are not
in full possession of the facts.

590
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:55,761
This man is a convicted multiple murderer,
known for particularly brutal crimes.

591
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,529
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon?

592
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,407
Yeah. That part's right.

593
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,313
Then I'll talk to you. lt's important.

594
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,815
When I have finished
with my official duties,

595
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:13,165
I will be quite pleased
to have a little chat, yes?

596
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,205
Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant.

597
01:01:19,305 --> 01:01:21,787
It's an eight-foot creature of some kind,

598
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:26,124
with acid for blood,
and it arrived on your spaceship.

599
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:29,711
It kills on sight and is generally unpleasant.

600
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,339
And, of course, you expect me to accept
all this on your word.

601
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,819
No, I don't expect anything.

602
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,737
Quite a story, Mr. Aaron.
- Right, sir. It's a beauty.

603
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,766
Never heard anything quite like it, sir.
- Expect not.

604
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:47,031
Tell me, Lieutenant,
what would you suggest we do?

605
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,731
Well, what kind of weapons have you got?

606
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,832
This is a prison.

607
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:54,361
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners
access to firearms.

608
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,238
What keeps them from killing you?

609
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,298
Fear. There's no way to escape.

610
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,328
With the arrival of the next supply ship,
the company would eliminate them.

611
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:07,306
This is a maximum security prison,

612
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,519
and you have no weapons of any kind?

613
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,073
We have some carving
knives in the abattoir.

614
01:02:17,173 --> 01:02:18,593
A few more in the mess hall.

615
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:22,097
Some fire axes scattered about the place.
Nothing terribly formidable.

616
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,473
That's all?

617
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,783
We're on the honor system.

618
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:35,542
Then we're fucked.
- No, you're fucked.

619
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:39,004
Confined to the infirmary.
Quarantined.

620
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,799
Mr. Aaron will escort you.

621
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:48,081
I think you'll be safe from any large,
nasty beast while you're there, right?

622
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,350
Yes, that's a good girl.

623
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:58,023
Let's all report to the mess hall.

624
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:02,095
Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting.
Mess hall, right away, people.

625
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:06,266
Isn't there any way off of this place?
Some way to escape?

626
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:10,119
No. Supply ship comes every six months.

627
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,204
And that's it?
Mm-hmm.

628
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,124
Fuck.

629
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:19,446
They are sending somebody
to pick you up quite soon, I gather.

630
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:22,339
Really.
What's soon?

631
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:27,694
I don't know. Nobody's ever been
in a hurry to get here before.

632
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,667
Do you want to tell me
what you and Andrews talked about?

633
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,019
No.

634
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:39,148
You'll just say I'm crazy.

635
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:45,195
That's a bit uncharitable.

636
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,366
How are you feeling?

637
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:54,538
Not so hot.

638
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,622
Sore throat.

639
01:03:56,624 --> 01:04:00,544
Sick to my stomach.
Pissed off.

640
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:04,491
Well, that's understandable
given the circumstances.

641
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:08,078
Perhaps I should give you
one of my special cocktails.

642
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,956
I don't know why everybody
blames everybody for everything.

643
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,521
Nobody's perfect, only human.

644
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,963
There's no such thing as a perfect human.

645
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:21,148
In an insane world,

646
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,692
a sane man...

647
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:28,238
...must... appear... insane.

648
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:31,909
That's very profound, Golic.
Thank you.

649
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,542
You married?

650
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,465
Me?
You should get married,

651
01:04:42,565 --> 01:04:43,196
have kids.

652
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:48,509
Pretty girl. I used to know
lots of 'em back home.

653
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,470
They used to like me.

654
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,933
For a while.

655
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,980
You're gonna die too.

656
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,701
Are you?
What?

657
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:17,037
Married.

658
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,540
Why?

659
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,876
Just curious.
- No.

660
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:31,051
How about levelling with me?
- Could you be more specific?

661
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:34,748
When I asked how you got assigned here,
you avoided the question.

662
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:38,043
And then when I asked about the prison I.D.
tattooed on the back of your head,

663
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,143
you ducked me again.

664
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,190
lt's a long, sad story...

665
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,720
...and more than a little melodramatic.

666
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,196
Try me.

667
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,701
If you insist.

668
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,749
After my student years,

669
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,821
despite the fact that I had become...

670
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,324
...secretly addicted to morphine,

671
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,659
I was considered to be most promising,

672
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,219
a man with a future.

673
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:22,663
And during my first residency,
I did a 36-hour stretch on an E.R.

674
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:26,299
So, I went out and I got
more than a little drunk.

675
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,567
Then I got called back.

676
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,804
Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,

677
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,989
and there were 30 casualties.

678
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:36,408
And 1 1 of them died.

679
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,645
Not as a result of the accident...

680
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:43,233
...but because I prescribed
the wrong dosage of painkiller.

681
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:48,348
I got seven years in prison
and my license reduced to a 3-C.

682
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:52,617
At least I got off the morphine.

683
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,885
l'm sorry.

684
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,790
l think I was let off lightly.

685
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,808
Did you serve your time here?

686
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,881
I got to know this motley crew quite well.

687
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:10,859
So when they stayed, I stayed.

688
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,658
Nobody else would employ me.

689
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,787
So, do you still trust me with a needle?

690
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,378
Magnificent.

691
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:00,411
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure.

692
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:05,041
We recognize that we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry God.

693
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:09,478
Let the circle be unbroken
until the day. Amen.

694
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:13,065
Amen.
What the fuck is happening here?

695
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,887
What the fuck is this
bullshit that's comin' down?

696
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,974
We got murder. We got rape.
We got brothers in trouble.

697
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:25,452
I don't want no more bullshit around here.

698
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:30,248
Now, we got problems,
we stand together.

699
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:33,152
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Dillon. All right.

700
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,380
Once again, this is rumour control.

701
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,007
Here are the facts.

702
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,760
At 0800 hours,
prisoner Murphy,

703
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,680
through carelessness on his part,

704
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,599
was found dead in vent shaft 1 7.

705
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:51,504
He seems to have been
sucked into a ventilator fan.

706
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,441
At about 2100 hours,

707
01:09:56,526 --> 01:10:00,654
prisoner Golic reappeared
in a deranged state.

708
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,016
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing.

709
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:07,770
There seems to be a good chance
that they have met with foul play...

710
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:11,123
...at the hands of prisoner Golic.

711
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:17,079
We need to organize
and send out a search party.

712
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,632
Volunteers will be appreciated.

713
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:27,373
I think it's fair to say
that our smoothly running facility...

714
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,293
...has suddenly developed a few problems.

715
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:36,257
I can only hope we are able to all
pull together over the next few days...

716
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:39,552
...until the rescue team arrives
for Lieutenant Ripley.

717
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,596
lt's here. It got Clemens.

718
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:45,391
Stop this raving at once. Stop it.
- I'm telling you, it's here.

719
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:48,394
Aaron, get that foolish woman
back to the infirmary.

720
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,706
Move it.

721
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,084
Out of my way.

722
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,965
Fuck.

723
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:11,766
We give you thanks, O Lord.

724
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:17,036
Your wrath has come,
and the time is near for us to be judged.

725
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:21,902
The apocalypse is upon us.

726
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:27,616
Let us be ready.
Let your mercy be just.

727
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,352
It was massive.
Amen.

728
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,979
And fast.
l was there. I saw it.

729
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:36,416
What the fuck do we do now?
Who's in fucking charge?

730
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,907
Organize. We gotta organize, right?

731
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,701
Right. Well, I guess I'm next in line.

732
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,343
85's gonna be in charge.
Jesus, give us a break.

733
01:11:48,443 --> 01:11:49,372
Don't call me that.

734
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,833
Okay, look. There's no way
I can replace Andrews.

735
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,627
He was a good man.
I know you guys didn't appreciate him.

736
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,880
Aaron, we don't want to hear that shit now.

737
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,008
Hey, sister, what about you?
You're an officer.

738
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,010
How about showing us a little leadership?

739
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,054
Forget fucking Shirley Temple.
You take charge.

740
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,390
Right.
- You run things here anyway.

741
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:12,494
No fuckin' way.
I'm not the officer type.

742
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,731
I just take care of my own.

743
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:19,231
Well, what does this fucking beast want?

744
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,230
Is this mother gonna try for us all?

745
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:29,052
Yeah.
- Well, ain't that sweet?

746
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,930
So how are we gonna stop it?

747
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,820
We have no weapons.
Is that correct?

748
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,254
Right.

749
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:42,094
I haven't seen one exactly like this before.

750
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:44,609
Moves differently.

751
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:49,182
But the others were afraid of fire-...

752
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,283
...not much else.

753
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,807
Can we seal off this area?
- No chance.

754
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,024
The installation's 1 0 miles square.

755
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,639
There's 600 air ducts
running to the surface.

756
01:12:59,739 --> 01:13:00,359
What about video?

757
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,580
I see these closed-circuit
monitors everywhere.

758
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,155
We could try to find it that way.

759
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:08,367
The video system hasn't worked in years.
Nothing much works here.

760
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,661
We got a lot of technology,
no way to fix it.

761
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,164
What 85 is trying to tell you is-
- Don't call me that.

762
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:16,334
we ain't got no entertainment center,
no climate control,

763
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:19,003
no video system,
no surveillance,

764
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:22,606
no freezers, no fucking ice cream,

765
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:25,483
no rubbers, no women, no guns.

766
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,652
All we got here is shit.

767
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,431
Oh, what the hell are we
even talking to her for?

768
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,950
She's the one that brought the fucker.

769
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:37,897
Why don't we just get her head
and shove it through the fucking wall?

770
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,248
That sounds good to me.

771
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,334
Hey, Morse.

772
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,890
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

773
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,551
Hmm.

774
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,348
Right.

775
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,393
Right. What are we going to do?

776
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:17,285
What's this?
Um,

777
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:20,439
that leads from the mess hall
to the infirmary.

778
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,525
It's a ventilation shaft.

779
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,960
Then we go in there, flush it out.

780
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:30,950
Hey. Hey, look, there's miles and miles
of tunnel through there.

781
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:33,051
It won't go far.

782
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,388
It'll nest in this area.

783
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,473
Right around...

784
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,977
...here.
How do you know that?

785
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,773
It's like a lion.

786
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:49,051
It sticks close to the zebras.

787
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,569
Zebras? Oh, right.

788
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,307
But, look. Running around down here
in the dark- Are you kidding?

789
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,809
Once you get out of this main shaft,
there's no overheads.

790
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,257
Don't we have flashlights?
We got thousands of 'em,

791
01:14:59,357 --> 01:15:00,062
but no batteries.

792
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,940
I told you, nothing works.
Torches?

793
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,027
Do we have the capacity to make fire?

794
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:10,406
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege
since the Stone Age.

795
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,757
No need to be sarcastic.

796
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:18,414
Never been used. They were gonna
dump a lot of nuclear crap in there.

797
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,626
Never got around to it.
It's clean as a whistle inside.

798
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:24,185
This the only way in or out?

799
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:28,007
That's right. Walls are
six feet thick, solid steel.

800
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,509
Really knew how to build these babies.

801
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:33,512
You're saying we get something in there,

802
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:36,057
there's no way it can get out?

803
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:39,409
That's right. No fucking way.

804
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,736
This is where we keep it.
I forget what the stuff's called.

805
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:52,338
Quinitricetyline.
l knew that.

806
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:55,660
Right. I've got to get these section
arrangements organized with Dillon...

807
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,386
...for the paintbrush, uh-

808
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,847
So, um- David.

809
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:04,215
Yeah. You can get these drums organized.

810
01:16:04,315 --> 01:16:05,002
Right, 85.

811
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:08,480
And, uh, don't call me that.

812
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:14,903
What's this 85 thing?

813
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:18,265
Couple of us sneaked a look at
his personnel file the day he arrived.

814
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,366
lt's his I.Q.

815
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,610
I saw a drum of this stuff...

816
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,862
...fall into a beachhead bunker once.

817
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:35,408
The blast put a tug
in dry dock for 1 7 weeks.

818
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,508
Great stuff.

819
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:45,099
All right.
Let me get this straight.

820
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:48,587
You want to burn it down
and out of the pipes,

821
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,840
force it in here,
slam the door...

822
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,566
...and trap its ass?
Right.

823
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:57,487
And you want help
from us y-chromo boys, huh?

824
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,432
You got something better to do?

825
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,309
Why should we put our ass
on the line for you?

826
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,562
Your ass is already on the line.

827
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:06,272
The only question is...

828
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,774
...what are you gonna do about it?

829
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,596
Look at this.

830
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:26,167
There's only one of these fucking batteries
in 2,000 that works.

831
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:28,081
Hey, it could have been a lot worse.

832
01:17:28,181 --> 01:17:28,461
Yeah?

833
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:33,106
We might have got the paintbrush detail.

834
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,861
Man, this stuff stinks.

835
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:55,071
This shit smells awful.
Then don't breathe...

836
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,322
...the fucking fumes.

837
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,366
I'm in a fucking pipe with it.
How can I keep from breathing it.

838
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:02,719
I mean,
don't breathe too hard.

839
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:06,264
You'll get high.
That's good for me.

840
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,025
So you miss Doc, right?

841
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:22,238
What makes you say that?

842
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,642
I thought you two got real close.

843
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:30,189
I guess you've been looking
through some keyholes.

844
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:34,917
That's what I thought.
Oh.

845
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:37,003
Oh.

846
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:43,134
You okay?
- Yeah. l'm fine.

847
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:48,318
Whatever you say, but, uh,
you don't look okay to me, sister.

848
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,476
l'm fine.

849
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:58,082
I hate this place.
I hate this place.

850
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,986
Well.

851
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:06,770
There's definitely
something in here with us.

852
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,729
Okay. Don't light the fire
until I give the signal.

853
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,414
This is the signal.

854
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:16,834
Got it?
Can you remember that?

855
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:23,215
Shit.

856
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:18,062
Buh-

857
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,990
Wait for the fucking signal.

858
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,122
Get down.

859
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,751
Aaah.

860
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:43,280
Come on, come on.
We gotta find the sprinklers.

861
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,185
Come on.
We gotta help these guys.

862
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,100
Come on. Move. Move.

863
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:01,298
Go to the waste dump.
Don't open the doors.

864
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,028
Oh, God.
It's all right.

865
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:09,450
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
We got you.

866
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,677
Fire's out.

867
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:25,966
Junior. Junior.
Get those sprinklers and turn them on.

868
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,693
We gotta get him out of here.

869
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,702
Come on.
We're walking you out.

870
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:48,212
Junior. Behind you.

871
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,382
Open the door.

872
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,386
Come on. Come on.

873
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,897
Come on. Come on.

874
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,021
Come and get me, fucker.

875
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:44,495
Even for those who have fallen,

876
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:48,416
this is a time of rejoicing.

877
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:54,046
We salute their courage.

878
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:57,800
They will live forever.

879
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:04,724
Those that are dead are not dead.

880
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:07,601
They have moved up.

881
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:11,355
They have moved to a higher place.

882
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,150
Crazy bastards.

883
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:17,690
Andrews used to call
them Dillon's God Squad.

884
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:19,765
Keeps 'em out of mischief.

885
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:22,616
You're not the religious type.

886
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:25,369
Shit, no. I've got a job.

887
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,998
Look, uh-

888
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:32,027
Figure the rescue team gets here in
four, five days-...

889
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,253
...six, tops.

890
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:39,352
They open the door, go in there
with smart guns and kill it.

891
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:45,723
What have you heard from them?
Nothing much.

892
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:48,309
We got a message received.

893
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:53,068
Later, we got something
that said you were top priority.

894
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:55,342
They don't cut us in on much.

895
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:58,637
We're the ass end of
the totem pole out here.

896
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:01,712
What if they don't want to kill it?

897
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:06,202
Take it back?
- Yeah.

898
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:10,539
They're not lunatics, you know?
Gotta kill it.

899
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,750
Right?

900
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:22,551
Morse, please, cut me loose.

901
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:24,371
No fucking way.

902
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,164
Come on, man. It hurts.

903
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,264
Oh, sorry.

904
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:31,477
Come on. I haven't done nothing.

905
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:36,148
Just don't talk to me.
Please, what did I do? Please.

906
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:38,544
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna sit...

907
01:26:38,644 --> 01:26:40,762
...here and guard your
ass like l'm supposed to.

908
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,473
I don't need any fucking trouble with Dillon.

909
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:47,394
All I did was tell 'em about the dragon,
what it did to Boggs and Rains.

910
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:51,122
I didn't lie. You saw it.

911
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,066
Fuckin' A I saw it.

912
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,584
Oh, please.

913
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:58,655
If this gets in here,
I'm dead. I can't run.

914
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:02,835
It's not going to get in here.
We got it trapped.

915
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:08,803
So what's the big deal?
Come on. Let me loose, man.

916
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:13,552
Don't I always give you cigarettes first?

917
01:27:13,652 --> 01:27:14,212
Yeah.

918
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:17,273
Aren't I your friend?

919
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:22,319
I love you, Morse.

920
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,906
Why not?

921
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:33,315
But behave yourself.
No fucking around...

922
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:36,135
...or I'll get nothing but shit.

923
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:47,511
So where they got it?
In the waste tank.

924
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:52,308
We got that sucker nailed.
I mean, tight.

925
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,935
Gotta see it again.

926
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,740
What the fuck you talking about?

927
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,776
No more cigarettes for you.

928
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:14,580
Right. We got the first part.
Now what do we say?

929
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:18,042
Tell them we trapped it.

930
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:22,296
What do we call it?
A xenomorph.

931
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,381
Right.

932
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:28,469
How do you spell it?

933
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,055
Here.

934
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:47,264
Hey, wait a minute.
We can't kill it.

935
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:50,169
We don't have any weapons, right?

936
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,250
Right.

937
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:57,708
See? That's all they ever tell us.
Treat us like shit.

938
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:26,553
Off and on me now?
- What the hell you talking about?

939
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,238
Talk to me, the beast.

940
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:35,442
You can't go in there, dickhead.
The big mothersucker will eat you alive.

941
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:46,672
Sorry.

942
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:49,800
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

943
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:17,075
Tell me what to do next.

944
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,969
So, you're telling me they're coming to
take this thing away?

945
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:52,347
Yeah, they're gonna try.
They don't wanna kill it.

946
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,933
We gotta figure out a way to do it
before they come here.

947
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:59,062
Why do we have to kill it?
You just said the company's coming for it.

948
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:02,190
That's right.
They wanna take it back.

949
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:05,068
Some sort of weapon.
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

950
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:08,738
They can't control it.
They don't understand. It'll kill them all.

951
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:10,657
Like I said,
what's wrong with that?

952
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:16,622
Nothing's wrong with that...
except a lot of innocent people will die.

953
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:21,850
I thought you were a religious man.

954
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,561
You don't understand, do you?

955
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:30,609
That world out there
doesn't exist for us anymore.

956
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,472
We've got our own little world out here.

957
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:38,242
It ain't much, but it's ours.

958
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:42,121
So fuck everybody else.

959
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:45,916
No. Fuck them.

960
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,504
Hey, Dillon?
- Yeah?

961
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:57,594
Uh, Dillon, we got a teeny-weeny problem.

962
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:16,321
Fucking great.

963
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:20,018
Miserable, crazy
son of a bitch let him loose.

964
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:22,583
Got what he fucking deserved.

965
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:26,039
Well, now what are we gonna do?

966
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:30,320
Andrews was right.
Should've kept the shithead chained up.

967
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,756
You okay?

968
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,933
Piss on her.
The fucking thing's loose out there.

969
01:32:37,033 --> 01:32:38,036
What are we gonna do?

970
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,762
l just said that.

971
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:43,351
And you're the dumb
prick that let Golic out.

972
01:32:43,451 --> 01:32:44,876
You miserable little shit.

973
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:46,711
Come on. Cut that shit out.

974
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:51,023
Tell your fucking bozo to shape up.

975
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:53,400
Wh-Wh-What do you think?

976
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:55,637
I think I have to get to the E.E.V.

977
01:32:55,737 --> 01:33:00,242
Why? What's up?
- I just have to use the neuroscanner.

978
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:03,603
You don't look so good.
- Who gives a shit how she looks?

979
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,343
What are we gonna do?
- Want a smack in the mouth,

980
01:33:06,443 --> 01:33:07,399
you stupid wanker?

981
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,401
Shut the fuck up and stop causing panic.

982
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,699
Panic- You're so fucking stupid,
you couldn't spell it.

983
01:33:11,799 --> 01:33:12,987
Don't talk to me about panic.

984
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,641
We ought to panic.
We're fucking screwed.

985
01:33:14,741 --> 01:33:15,448
Whose fault is that?

986
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:18,523
All right.
Now shut up, both of you.

987
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,678
Shut up.

988
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:41,472
Well, I'm out of ideas.
- Oh, surprise me.

989
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:46,085
What about outside?
Great idea.

990
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,682
Sun don't come up for another two days.

991
01:33:47,782 --> 01:33:48,440
It's 40 below zero.

992
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:51,151
The rescue team's 1 0 hours away.
So that makes a lot of sense.

993
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:54,571
Wonderful. You just want us to stay here
and let this thing have us for lunch.

994
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:58,283
I want you to get everybody
that's still left together.

995
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:02,636
Get 'em into the assembly hall.

996
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,888
Okay.

997
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,059
Where'd she go?

998
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:40,674
Need any help?

999
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:44,678
I don't mean to scare you.

1000
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,081
You shouldn't be wandering around alone.

1001
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:51,091
Do me a favour and run
this keyboard, will you?

1002
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:54,186
Okay.

1003
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:06,533
What do I do?
Hit B or C.

1004
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:08,311
What's C?

1005
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:11,046
Display biofunctions.
That's it.

1006
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:16,585
Okay, we're hot. Now what?

1007
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:19,254
Let it run a cycle.

1008
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,465
It's real fuzzy.

1009
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:24,635
Hit enhancement.

1010
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:45,071
Keep looking.

1011
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,190
I don't know how to read this stuff.

1012
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:57,793
Haemorrhaging will show as a dark patch.

1013
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:06,051
Look for...

1014
01:36:06,135 --> 01:36:08,997
...hairline fractures
through the base of the skull.

1015
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,223
Little white lines.

1016
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:21,482
What is it?

1017
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:26,339
I think you've got one inside of you.

1018
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:29,866
That's not possible.

1019
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:35,038
What does it look like?

1020
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:43,588
Horrible.
- I have to see it.

1021
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:48,036
Freeze it.
- You don't want to look at it.

1022
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:50,136
Freeze it.

1023
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:17,706
l'm sorry.

1024
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:25,823
All right. The fucking thing is loose.
It's out there.

1025
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:29,285
A rescue team is on its way
with guns and shit.

1026
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:33,206
Right now there isn't
any place that's real safe.

1027
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:35,249
But we stay here,
in the assembly hall.

1028
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:38,419
This place never had
any fucking air conditioning.

1029
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:40,713
If it comes in, it's gotta be through
one of these doors.

1030
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:43,675
Now we post a guard
to let us know if it's coming.

1031
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:49,029
In the meantime,
you lay low, be ready and stay right...

1032
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,448
...in case your time comes.

1033
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:56,703
Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon.

1034
01:37:56,788 --> 01:37:58,773
We're gonna be trapped in here like rats.

1035
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:02,610
You got a weapon? You got a blade?
Then you take it out and you fucking use it.

1036
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:07,448
Oh, right. So you think we're gonna
stab this mothersucker to death?

1037
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:10,217
No, I don't think shit. Maybe.

1038
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:13,204
Maybe you'll hurt it
before it takes you out, huh?

1039
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:17,809
Isn't that something?
Any of you got any better ideas?

1040
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:27,503
And I'll tell you, until the rescue team
gets here, we're fucked.

1041
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:31,154
So you better get prepared.

1042
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:40,956
Well, I ain't staying here.

1043
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:45,335
Well, then, suit yourself.

1044
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:53,676
Fire.

1045
01:38:57,974 --> 01:39:02,811
Furnace.
- Yeah. Let's make it to the furnace.

1046
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:07,983
Holy shit.

1047
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:11,903
Well, all right.

1048
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:14,072
Fuckin' A.

1049
01:39:14,156 --> 01:39:17,641
Fuckin' A.
- Too fuckin' right it's right.

1050
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:39,139
It's up. What do you want to say?

1051
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,543
Tell them the whole place has gone toxic.

1052
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:45,353
Are you kidding?

1053
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:47,924
Then they won't come here.
The rescue team will turn back.

1054
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:50,551
Yeah. I know.
What are you talking about?

1055
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:54,487
Our only hope is that they kill this fucker.

1056
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:57,809
And maybe they can do something for you.
I don't know, freeze you-

1057
01:39:57,909 --> 01:40:00,228
They can do an operation.
They've got the technology.

1058
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:04,106
If this organism gets off the planet,
it'll kill everything.

1059
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:06,484
The company doesn't care about that.

1060
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:09,529
They just want it for
their bioweapons division, okay?

1061
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:13,340
So we can't let them come here.

1062
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:15,508
Fuck you.

1063
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:19,330
Look, I'm sorry you've got this thing
inside you, but l'm getting rescued.

1064
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:22,834
I don't give a shit about these
stupid prisoners, but l've got a wife, a kid.

1065
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:25,920
I'll go home on the next rotation.
- I know. This is hard.

1066
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:29,674
I'm gonna send this message.
I need that fucking code.

1067
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:32,776
I'm sorry, babe. It's classified.

1068
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,680
Listen, you stupid little shit.
This has got to be done, okay?

1069
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:38,182
There are no alternatives.
No way.

1070
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:41,427
You're not getting it.
No fucking way.

1071
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:50,027
Look, it's nothing personal.

1072
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,629
Understand?

1073
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,798
I think you're okay.

1074
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,800
Ah.

1075
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:02,137
Thanks.

1076
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:13,525
Have you got any ideas?

1077
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:18,238
It won't kill me.

1078
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:20,740
I'm carrying the new queen.

1079
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:23,993
It won't kill its future.

1080
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:28,915
You really wanna bet
this thing's that smart?

1081
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:33,503
Maybe I'll go find it.
See how smart it is.

1082
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:36,383
You're gonna go and look for it?

1083
01:41:36,483 --> 01:41:36,907
Yeah.

1084
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:40,593
I have a pretty good idea of where it is.

1085
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:45,640
It's just down there... in the basement.

1086
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:49,310
This whole place is a basement.

1087
01:41:49,395 --> 01:41:54,065
It's a metaphor. Wanna come?

1088
01:41:56,861 --> 01:42:01,990
Fuck me.

1089
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:25,163
Where are you when I need you?

1090
01:43:57,147 --> 01:43:59,399
Don't be afraid.

1091
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,611
l'm part of the family.

1092
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:13,681
You've been in my life so long,

1093
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:16,401
I can't remember anything else.

1094
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:20,688
Now do something for me.

1095
01:45:22,524 --> 01:45:24,524
It's easy.

1096
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:27,362
Just-

1097
01:45:27,446 --> 01:45:30,281
Just do what you do.

1098
01:46:04,984 --> 01:46:07,402
Oh.

1099
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:16,709
It won't kill me.
- What are you doing out here?

1100
01:46:16,809 --> 01:46:18,397
You're supposed to be laying low.

1101
01:46:18,497 --> 01:46:22,083
I have one inside of me.

1102
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:23,819
Big one won't kill its own.

1103
01:46:23,919 --> 01:46:27,031
What are you talking about?
I just saw it,

1104
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:29,799
an hour ago.

1105
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:32,260
I stood right next to it.

1106
01:46:32,344 --> 01:46:36,347
I could've been lunch,
but it wouldn't touch me.

1107
01:46:36,432 --> 01:46:38,975
It ran away.

1108
01:46:40,102 --> 01:46:42,338
It knows I'm carrying its future.

1109
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:45,591
Aw, bullshit. How do you know
that thing's inside you?

1110
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:49,277
I saw it... on the CAT scan.

1111
01:46:49,361 --> 01:46:54,449
It's a queen- an egg layer.

1112
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:56,518
It can make thousands more
like the one we've got here.

1113
01:46:56,618 --> 01:47:00,329
Still sounds like bullshit to me.

1114
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:03,275
If that thing's inside you,
how'd it get there?

1115
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:07,587
I don't know.

1116
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:10,074
When I was in hypersleep, I guess.

1117
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:12,383
l was violated.

1118
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:16,804
Now I get to be the mother.

1119
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:23,936
I don't have much time,

1120
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:27,356
and I can't do what I should.

1121
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:31,819
I need you to help me.

1122
01:47:35,365 --> 01:47:38,409
I need you to kill me.

1123
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:42,106
What the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm dead anyway.

1124
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:45,792
I can't survive it.

1125
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:50,296
But the one inside of me
can generate thousands more,

1126
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:53,424
can wipe out the whole universe.

1127
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:56,010
lt has to die.

1128
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,554
So somebody's gotta kill me.

1129
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:03,184
Are you up to it?

1130
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:07,230
You don't have to worry about that.

1131
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:26,791
No speeches.

1132
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:32,255
No prayers.

1133
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:06,190
What's going on?
- I don't like losing a fight.

1134
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,525
Not to nobody, not to nothing.

1135
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:10,820
Fuck.
That damn thing out there...

1136
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,072
...has already killed half my men,

1137
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:14,990
got the other half scared shitless.

1138
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:18,160
As long as it's alive, sister,
you're not gonna save any universe.

1139
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:19,870
You said you were gonna kill me.

1140
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:24,140
You fucking coward.
- I want that thing.

1141
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:27,711
I want to get this thing,
and I need you to do it.

1142
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:32,007
And if it won't kill you,
then maybe that helps us fight it.

1143
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:35,985
Otherwise, fuck you.

1144
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:39,113
Go kill yourself.

1145
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:45,494
Dillon.

1146
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:48,872
We waste this thing,

1147
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:53,602
then you take care of me.
No problem.

1148
01:49:54,004 --> 01:49:57,673
Quick, easy and painless.

1149
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:04,597
This is the choice.

1150
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:08,585
You die sitting here on your ass,
or you die out there.

1151
01:50:08,685 --> 01:50:12,271
At least we take a shot.
We owe it one.

1152
01:50:12,356 --> 01:50:17,031
It's fucked us up.
Maybe we can get even for the others.

1153
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:20,764
Now how do you want it?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1154
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:23,475
I'm talkin' about killing
that big motherfucker.

1155
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:26,812
Hold it, hold it.
The rescue team's on its way.

1156
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:30,164
We could just sit this out.

1157
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:33,042
Rescue team for whom?
- For us.

1158
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,990
They just want the beast.
You know that.

1159
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,741
I don't give a damn what they want.

1160
01:50:39,841 --> 01:50:41,994
They're not gonna
pick us off one by one, are they?

1161
01:50:42,094 --> 01:50:43,745
I wouldn't be so sure.

1162
01:50:43,845 --> 01:50:46,081
Come on.
They're gonna take us home.

1163
01:50:46,181 --> 01:50:47,457
They're not gonna take us home.

1164
01:50:47,557 --> 01:50:49,459
Still doesn't mean we should
go out and fight it.

1165
01:50:49,559 --> 01:50:53,589
Jesus Christ. Give us a break.
- You guys have got to be fucking nuts.

1166
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:56,300
Look, I've got a wife and a kid.
- Nobody gives a shit about you, 85.

1167
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,886
You're not one of us.
You're not a believer.

1168
01:50:58,986 --> 01:51:01,638
You're a fucking company man.
- Yeah, okay.

1169
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:04,516
Okay, I'm a company man
and not a fucking criminal.

1170
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:07,102
You keep telling me how dumb I am.

1171
01:51:07,202 --> 01:51:09,396
Well, I'm smart enough not to have
a life sentence on this rock.

1172
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:11,315
Fuck you.
- Piss off, 85.

1173
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:14,654
Yeah, and I'm smart enough to wait
for some firepower to show up...

1174
01:51:14,754 --> 01:51:15,986
...before we fight this thing.

1175
01:51:16,086 --> 01:51:17,738
Right, Morse?

1176
01:51:17,838 --> 01:51:20,532
Right. Okay. Just sit here
on your asses. Fine.

1177
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:23,410
How about if I sit here on my ass?

1178
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:26,971
No problem. Oh, I forgot.

1179
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:28,999
You're the guy that's
made a deal with God...

1180
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:31,726
...to live forever, huh?

1181
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:36,105
And all the rest of you pussies
can sit it out too.

1182
01:51:36,189 --> 01:51:39,275
Me and her will do all the fighting.

1183
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:42,346
Okay. But I want the same thing as you.

1184
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:45,474
I want to see it dead. I hate the fucker.
It killed my mates too.

1185
01:51:45,574 --> 01:51:50,103
Why the fuck can't we wait for the company
and have some guns on our side?

1186
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:53,357
Why do we have to go
on some fucking suicide run?

1187
01:51:53,457 --> 01:51:53,774
Right.

1188
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:55,442
Because they won't kill it.

1189
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:59,071
They might kill you just for having seen it.
But they're not gonna kill it.

1190
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:03,846
That is crazy. That is horseshit.
They will not kill us.

1191
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,997
When they first heard about this thing,

1192
01:52:09,097 --> 01:52:11,390
it was crew expendable.

1193
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:16,171
The next time they sent in marines.
They were expendable too.

1194
01:52:16,271 --> 01:52:20,092
What makes you think they're
gonna care about a bunch of lifers...

1195
01:52:20,192 --> 01:52:24,111
...who found God at the ass end of space?

1196
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:26,515
You really think they're going to let you...

1197
01:52:26,615 --> 01:52:29,935
...interfere with their plans for this thing?

1198
01:52:30,035 --> 01:52:32,620
They think we're- we're crud.

1199
01:52:32,704 --> 01:52:36,024
And they don't give a fuck
about one friend of yours...

1200
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:38,334
...that's- that's died.

1201
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:40,418
Not one.

1202
01:52:44,257 --> 01:52:46,285
Have you got some sort of plan?

1203
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:49,178
This is a lead works, isn't it?

1204
01:52:49,262 --> 01:52:53,292
All we got to do is lure
the fucking beast into the mould,

1205
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:55,601
drown it in hot lead.

1206
01:52:55,685 --> 01:52:58,813
All right. So how do we do that?

1207
01:52:58,897 --> 01:53:02,191
Yeah. What are we gonna use for bait?

1208
01:53:08,532 --> 01:53:13,327
Oh, fuck.
- We're all gonna die.

1209
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:16,330
The only question is when.

1210
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:20,042
This is as good a place as any...

1211
01:53:20,127 --> 01:53:23,357
...to take your first steps to heaven.

1212
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:26,355
Only question is how you check out.

1213
01:53:28,051 --> 01:53:31,011
Do you want it on your feet...

1214
01:53:31,096 --> 01:53:34,890
...or on your fucking knees, begging?

1215
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:37,476
I ain't much for begging.

1216
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:40,396
Nobody ever gave me nothin'.

1217
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,880
So I say fuck that thing.
Let's fight it.

1218
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:52,241
Fuck it. Let's go for it.

1219
01:53:55,745 --> 01:53:59,483
Let's kick its fucking ass.
What if it runs at us?

1220
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:02,084
That's a fucking good idea.

1221
01:54:05,672 --> 01:54:09,675
Channel A, Door 1 open.

1222
01:54:09,759 --> 01:54:11,995
When was the last time
you used this place?

1223
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,331
We fired it up five, six years ago.

1224
01:54:14,431 --> 01:54:16,041
You sure the piston's gonna work?

1225
01:54:16,141 --> 01:54:18,418
There's nothing for sure in this place.

1226
01:54:23,231 --> 01:54:26,635
We trap it here first,
then you pull the lever, start the piston.

1227
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:29,221
Then the piston's gonna push
the mothersucker right into the mould.

1228
01:54:29,321 --> 01:54:33,016
Then one of the guys will pour the lead.
End of his ass. End of story.

1229
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:35,894
What if somebody screws it up?
- We're fucked. You got one chance.

1230
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:38,787
One shot at it. That's all.

1231
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:43,360
We'll never have time to reset it.
Now remember, when you pull the lever,

1232
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:47,697
for a few seconds you're gonna be
trapped in here with that fuckin' thing.

1233
01:54:47,797 --> 01:54:50,033
If you guys don't drop the ball, I won't.

1234
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:53,036
Well, you just better be right about
that thing not wanting you.

1235
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:56,081
Because if it wants out,
that's how it's gonna go.

1236
01:54:56,181 --> 01:54:58,875
Through that alcove, through you.

1237
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:01,461
Where are you gonna be?
I'll be around.

1238
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:04,537
What about the others?
Where are they?

1239
01:55:04,637 --> 01:55:05,215
Praying.

1240
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:15,115
You believe in this heaven shit?
Eh? I don't know.

1241
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,535
Me neither.

1242
01:55:19,162 --> 01:55:24,041
Fuck it, though.
What else have we got to believe in?

1243
01:55:24,125 --> 01:55:27,294
Say that for fucking sure.

1244
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:31,382
Well- Hey.

1245
01:55:33,134 --> 01:55:36,470
What the fuck, right?

1246
01:55:53,488 --> 01:55:56,865
Silence. I can't hear-

1247
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:04,373
Let's launch this thing.

1248
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:16,719
Channel B, Door 7.

1249
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:21,056
I don't know about this shit.

1250
01:56:21,141 --> 01:56:26,812
Hey, guys. My door ain't working.
- What the fuck's he saying?

1251
01:56:26,896 --> 01:56:30,211
I think we'd better rethink this thing.

1252
01:56:34,821 --> 01:56:38,157
Did anybody hear anything?

1253
01:56:48,918 --> 01:56:52,087
Come on.
Come and get me, you fucker.

1254
01:56:53,506 --> 01:56:55,506
It's behind me.

1255
01:56:56,092 --> 01:57:00,179
It's starting.
- Still behind me.

1256
01:57:00,263 --> 01:57:02,890
It's in Channel B.

1257
01:57:02,974 --> 01:57:06,477
Still coming. Shut the doors.

1258
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:09,451
Must be heading over to Channel A.

1259
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:16,638
This thing is really pissed off.

1260
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:19,156
Did you say B?
No, E.

1261
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:22,686
But you said we should stay here.
Move your fucking ass.

1262
01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:24,786
Morse?

1263
01:57:27,248 --> 01:57:29,500
Kevin.

1264
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:45,140
I think I found Vincent.

1265
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:51,730
Yoo-hoo. Hey, fuckface.

1266
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:56,193
Come and get me.
Take your best shot.

1267
01:58:01,282 --> 01:58:03,409
Kevin, where are you?

1268
01:58:03,493 --> 01:58:05,145
A-7 closed.

1269
01:58:10,041 --> 01:58:14,670
Open the east wing.
Door B-7 safe.

1270
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:29,445
You cool?
Yeah. Okay.

1271
01:58:29,545 --> 01:58:30,629
Over to E, everybody.

1272
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:33,194
Where the fuck is E?
This way.

1273
01:58:35,066 --> 01:58:37,985
Troy. Troy? Troy, help 'em.

1274
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:43,948
How did I get here?

1275
01:58:44,701 --> 01:58:48,271
Where the hell are they going?
What about the plan?

1276
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:53,131
Look, you're immune, they're not.
- So what are we doing?

1277
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,904
Improvising.
- We're improvising.

1278
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:58,004
Great.

1279
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:19,151
Here. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1280
01:59:19,235 --> 01:59:21,235
Here, kitty, kitty.

1281
01:59:22,614 --> 01:59:24,865
Oh, my God.

1282
01:59:24,949 --> 01:59:29,536
Oh, my- You bastard.

1283
01:59:29,621 --> 01:59:34,291
It's coming. It's coming, Dillon.
Geez, it's coming.

1284
01:59:34,375 --> 01:59:39,531
It's comin' after us. Shut the fucking doors.
That was the plan.

1285
01:59:39,631 --> 01:59:41,950
Geez, it's on the fucking ceiling.

1286
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:46,345
Dillon. Anybody. This is not a drill.

1287
01:59:46,429 --> 01:59:49,223
Kevin. Gregor.

1288
01:59:49,307 --> 01:59:51,084
Where the fuck are you?

1289
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,771
Now I'm back in A.

1290
01:59:58,983 --> 02:00:01,818
Shut. Come on.

1291
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:13,539
Door 3, F Channel closed.

1292
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:16,124
I hope.

1293
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:18,585
Fuck.

1294
02:00:18,711 --> 02:00:20,363
What the fuck are you doing?
What?

1295
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:22,432
Don't hold it like that.
Hold it like this.

1296
02:00:22,532 --> 02:00:23,283
What the fuck-

1297
02:00:23,383 --> 02:00:27,173
You'll fucking kill someone,
you fucking moron.

1298
02:00:27,273 --> 02:00:29,273
Ow.

1299
02:00:31,891 --> 02:00:36,603
Morse. Kevin.

1300
02:00:36,688 --> 02:00:38,423
Gregor.

1301
02:00:38,523 --> 02:00:42,302
All they have to do
is run down the damn corridor.

1302
02:00:42,402 --> 02:00:44,402
Stay here.

1303
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:49,992
Where the hell is it?

1304
02:01:26,904 --> 02:01:31,033
It's coming. Aw, Jesus.

1305
02:01:39,083 --> 02:01:41,752
No. Don't start the piston.

1306
02:01:41,836 --> 02:01:44,379
No. We have to trap it. No.

1307
02:01:44,505 --> 02:01:49,301
No. What are you doing?
It's gone. No. No.

1308
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:52,220
It's gone.

1309
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:54,305
Okay?

1310
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:58,727
Okay.

1311
02:02:32,095 --> 02:02:34,888
What the heck?

1312
02:02:34,972 --> 02:02:37,474
All right.

1313
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,143
Kevin. Don't struggle.

1314
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:42,938
Don't move. No. Don't struggle.

1315
02:02:44,732 --> 02:02:46,509
Come on. Come on, Kevin.
Come on.

1316
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:48,860
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1317
02:02:48,945 --> 02:02:51,780
The doors.
- It's coming.

1318
02:02:53,533 --> 02:02:55,533
Take the piston.

1319
02:02:56,994 --> 02:02:58,896
I got ya. It's all right.

1320
02:02:58,996 --> 02:03:01,631
It's okay. I got ya. It's okay.

1321
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:03,708
It's all right, Kevin.

1322
02:03:05,086 --> 02:03:07,086
Kevin.

1323
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:09,073
Kevin.

1324
02:03:14,846 --> 02:03:16,539
Leave him.

1325
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:19,359
Leave him. He's dead.
Lure it in.

1326
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:35,240
Shit. How much time?

1327
02:03:35,324 --> 02:03:37,101
I'm not sure.
Four or five minutes.

1328
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:41,230
But we've got to get it back in here
before the piston seals this place off.

1329
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:45,459
Now, let's move it.

1330
02:04:11,527 --> 02:04:14,362
Help me.
- Jude.

1331
02:04:16,616 --> 02:04:20,702
Dillon. Help me, Dillon.

1332
02:04:20,787 --> 02:04:24,164
It's coming at me.

1333
02:04:24,248 --> 02:04:27,360
Don't look back, Jude.
Run as fast as you fucking can.

1334
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,711
Help me.

1335
02:04:29,796 --> 02:04:32,380
God. Please. Help.

1336
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:54,528
Channel C, Door 3 closed.

1337
02:04:56,697 --> 02:05:00,200
Jesus Christ.
Thank God you're here.

1338
02:05:01,786 --> 02:05:04,188
Warder Aaron, sir.
1 -3-7-5-1 -2.

1339
02:05:04,288 --> 02:05:08,151
Not many of us left, sir.
- Where is Lieutenant Ripley?

1340
02:05:08,251 --> 02:05:13,181
Is she still alive?
- If she's alive, she's in the furnace.

1341
02:05:13,673 --> 02:05:15,742
She's in the lead works with the beast.

1342
02:05:15,842 --> 02:05:17,926
Wouldn't wait.

1343
02:05:32,525 --> 02:05:35,928
Jesus Christ. You fucker.
Scared me shitless.

1344
02:05:36,028 --> 02:05:40,240
I thought you were
the fucking beast. You fuck.

1345
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:49,457
Wanker.

1346
02:06:09,562 --> 02:06:13,273
Move. Come on, you bastard.

1347
02:06:19,447 --> 02:06:23,408
Come on. Come on,
get out of there.

1348
02:06:23,492 --> 02:06:25,827
Come here.

1349
02:06:27,580 --> 02:06:30,470
Ripley, we're running out of time.

1350
02:06:36,297 --> 02:06:39,966
Ripley, where are you?

1351
02:06:57,318 --> 02:06:59,318
No.

1352
02:07:08,412 --> 02:07:11,414
Come on. Get out of there.

1353
02:07:11,499 --> 02:07:13,359
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No. No.

1354
02:07:13,459 --> 02:07:15,794
Let it go. Let it go.

1355
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:18,672
Yes. It's working.
- Scream.

1356
02:07:18,798 --> 02:07:21,534
To the piston.
Scream. Let it follow us.

1357
02:07:21,634 --> 02:07:22,704
Come on.
We got to get it...

1358
02:07:22,804 --> 02:07:23,703
...in front of the piston.

1359
02:07:23,803 --> 02:07:27,055
Get back there. It's following us.

1360
02:07:27,181 --> 02:07:29,667
Motherfucker.
Come on. Come and get us.

1361
02:07:29,767 --> 02:07:31,767
Come on.

1362
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:34,062
Up to the door. Close it.

1363
02:07:34,146 --> 02:07:36,856
Come on, motherfucker. Come on.

1364
02:07:36,941 --> 02:07:40,110
Come on. Get the door.

1365
02:07:40,194 --> 02:07:43,196
Get the door.
- Morse.

1366
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:44,891
Now.
Shut it.

1367
02:07:44,991 --> 02:07:46,991
Shut it, Morse.

1368
02:07:47,201 --> 02:07:50,954
Morse, shut that door.

1369
02:07:51,038 --> 02:07:53,418
Now.
- Shut the fucking door.

1370
02:07:55,334 --> 02:07:58,420
I'm going for the lead.

1371
02:08:34,498 --> 02:08:36,916
Go. Now.
- What about you?

1372
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:38,927
I'm staying.
- Bullshit. There's gonna be...

1373
02:08:39,027 --> 02:08:40,363
...10 tons of hot lead in there.

1374
02:08:40,463 --> 02:08:43,532
I keep telling you, I want to die.
We got a deal.

1375
02:08:43,632 --> 02:08:46,160
Remember? It dies first, then you.

1376
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:50,085
I'm not gonna move without you.
Now get going.

1377
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:07,556
Dillon.
- I've got to hold it here.

1378
02:09:07,656 --> 02:09:10,601
What about me?
- God will take care of you now, sister.

1379
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:12,701
No.

1380
02:09:12,703 --> 02:09:14,703
Pour the lead.

1381
02:09:21,921 --> 02:09:23,921
Fuck you.

1382
02:09:26,217 --> 02:09:31,721
Go on. Pour it, Ripley. Go on. Damn it.

1383
02:09:31,806 --> 02:09:34,250
Pour that lead, Ripley.
Pour it now.

1384
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:37,461
Come on. Come on.
That's all you've got?

1385
02:09:37,561 --> 02:09:39,880
Is that all that you fight,
motherfucker. Come on.

1386
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:43,399
Morse. Morse, over here.

1387
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:47,862
Ripley.
- Pour the lead.

1388
02:09:49,115 --> 02:09:51,491
Pour the lead.

1389
02:09:51,575 --> 02:09:53,575
Pour it.

1390
02:10:48,591 --> 02:10:50,591
I hate bugs.

1391
02:11:16,744 --> 02:11:19,537
Ripley. It's burning hot.

1392
02:11:19,622 --> 02:11:23,082
Hit the sprinklers.

1393
02:11:23,167 --> 02:11:25,627
Douse the fucker.

1394
02:11:58,285 --> 02:12:00,285
Gotcha.

1395
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:02,913
Yes.

1396
02:13:07,730 --> 02:13:11,258
Don't come any closer.
- Wait. They're here to help.

1397
02:13:11,358 --> 02:13:13,358
Stay where you are.

1398
02:13:15,988 --> 02:13:19,324
Ripley.
- Bishop.

1399
02:13:19,408 --> 02:13:21,894
I'm here to help you.
No more bullshit.

1400
02:13:21,994 --> 02:13:24,579
I just felt it move.

1401
02:13:24,663 --> 02:13:27,999
You know who I am?
- You're a droid.

1402
02:13:28,083 --> 02:13:31,070
Same model as Bishop.
Sent by the fucking company.

1403
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:35,214
No. I'm not the Bishop android.

1404
02:13:35,299 --> 02:13:37,550
I designed it.

1405
02:13:37,634 --> 02:13:40,136
I'm very human.

1406
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:42,498
The company sent me here
to show you a friendly face,

1407
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:46,351
to demonstrate
how important you are to us,

1408
02:13:46,435 --> 02:13:48,045
to me.

1409
02:13:48,145 --> 02:13:51,382
You just want to take it back.
- We want to kill it and take you home.

1410
02:13:51,482 --> 02:13:54,060
Bullshit.
- You're wrong.

1411
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:55,970
We want to help.

1412
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:58,988
What does that mean?

1413
02:13:59,114 --> 02:14:03,284
We're gonna take that out of you.
And keep it.

1414
02:14:03,369 --> 02:14:08,724
Can't allow it to live.
Everything we know would be in jeopardy.

1415
02:14:09,458 --> 02:14:11,694
You don't want to take it back?

1416
02:14:11,794 --> 02:14:17,548
Ripley, time is important.
Let us deal with the malignancy.

1417
02:14:17,633 --> 02:14:21,704
We've got a surgical bay
set up on the rescue ship.

1418
02:14:21,804 --> 02:14:25,390
Come with me.
It's very quick.

1419
02:14:25,474 --> 02:14:30,770
Painless. A couple of incisions.
You'll be out for two hours.

1420
02:14:33,399 --> 02:14:35,399
And then it's over.

1421
02:14:40,656 --> 02:14:45,701
You still can have a life, children-

1422
02:14:47,413 --> 02:14:50,482
And most important,
you'll know it's dead.

1423
02:14:50,582 --> 02:14:52,959
Let me help you.

1424
02:14:54,002 --> 02:14:56,504
What guarantee do I have...

1425
02:14:58,465 --> 02:15:02,760
...once you've taken it out,
you'll destroy it?

1426
02:15:02,845 --> 02:15:05,638
You have to trust me.

1427
02:15:10,769 --> 02:15:14,021
Please? Trust me?

1428
02:15:18,735 --> 02:15:20,735
No.

1429
02:15:30,747 --> 02:15:33,458
What's this gonna achieve?

1430
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:36,461
Stop.
- Ow. Oh, Jesus.

1431
02:15:36,545 --> 02:15:39,714
Morse.

1432
02:15:42,176 --> 02:15:46,345
Will you help me?
What do you want me to do?

1433
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:52,878
It was a mistake.
There was no need for any of it.

1434
02:15:52,978 --> 02:15:54,978
Fucking android.

1435
02:16:12,915 --> 02:16:14,915
I'm not a droid.

1436
02:16:18,462 --> 02:16:22,924
Ripley, think of all we could learn from it.

1437
02:16:23,008 --> 02:16:26,135
It's the chance of a lifetime.

1438
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:31,224
You must let me have it.
It's a magnificent specimen.

1439
02:16:32,434 --> 02:16:34,977
Oh, Jesus.

1440
02:16:36,271 --> 02:16:38,271
No pictures.

1441
02:17:06,677 --> 02:17:08,928
You're crazy.

1442
02:17:09,012 --> 02:17:11,764
What are you doing?

1443
02:17:20,232 --> 02:17:22,608
No.

1444
02:18:22,878 --> 02:18:26,380
Come on, you. Get going.
Oh, fuck you.

1445
02:18:32,929 --> 02:18:36,265
Ash, Captain Dallas are dead.

1446
02:18:36,350 --> 02:18:40,144
Cargo and ship destroyed.

1447
02:18:40,228 --> 02:18:44,440
I should reach the frontier
in about six weeks.

1448
02:18:44,524 --> 02:18:48,220
With a little luck,
the network will pick me up.

1449
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:50,320
This is Ripley,

1450
02:18:50,364 --> 02:18:53,934
last survivor of the Nostromo,
signing off
