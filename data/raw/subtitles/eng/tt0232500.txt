1
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,320
Just packed up a real money load,
and it's coming your way.

2
00:01:03,537 --> 00:01:07,537
Look for "Rodgers" on the truck's side.
Don't forget my share of the deal.

3
00:03:57,717 --> 00:03:58,277
Shit!

4
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:42,916
- Tuna on white, no crust, right?
- I don't know. How is it?

5
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:47,885
Every day, for the last three weeks,
you've come here, asking how the tuna is.

6
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:51,744
Now, it was crappy yesterday.
It was crappy the day before.

7
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:54,662
And guess what? It hasn't changed.

8
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:57,202
- I'll have the tuna.
- No crust?

9
00:04:57,404 --> 00:04:58,444
No crust.

10
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,762
Thank you.

11
00:06:10,897 --> 00:06:13,177
Talk to me, Jesse.
This ain't working, brother.

12
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:15,878
It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.

13
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:19,043
- That's why you're unloading in third.
- Told you.

14
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:24,159
I lengthen the injector pulse a millisecond.
Just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.

15
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,731
What's up with this fool?
Is he sandwich-crazy?

16
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:39,362
- No. He ain't here for the food, dog.
- Chill out. He's slinging parts for Harry.

17
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:42,996
- I know what he's slinging.
- He's trying to get in Mia's pants, dog.

18
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:45,343
- What's up, guys?
- How you doing, Mia?

19
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:47,598
- How you living, girl?
- Hey!

20
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:50,591
Hey, Dom. You want something to drink?

21
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:04,701
- He's beautiful.
- I like his haircut.

22
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:08,541
Vince!

23
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,755
- What?
- Can I get you anything?

24
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:14,829
You look good.

25
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:21,653
- Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow.
- Sure.

26
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:26,562
- Tomorrow?
- I love this part.

27
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:35,837
Try Fatburger from now on. Get yourself a
Double Cheese with fries for $2.95, faggot.

28
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:39,471
- I like the tuna here.
- Bullshit. No one likes the tuna here.

29
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:41,058
Yeah, well, I do.

30
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:56,988
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out
there? I'm sick of this shit.

31
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,457
I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!

32
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:06,332
- What did you put in that sandwich?
- That's funny.

33
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,678
- Dom!
- All right.

34
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,049
- Hey, man. He was in my face.
- I'm in your face.

35
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:34,593
Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!

36
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,583
Get over there!

37
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:41,897
Jesse, give me the wallet.

38
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:48,049
"Brian Earl Spilner."
Sounds like a serial killer name.

39
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,072
- Is that what you are?
- No, man.

40
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,109
Don't come around here again.

41
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:56,409
Hey, man. This is bullshit.

42
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:00,449
- You work for Harry, right?
- Yeah. I just started.

43
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,261
You were just fired.

44
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,215
Hey, Dominic.
I appreciate what you did, in a big way.

45
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:20,324
Dominic, I owe you.

46
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:26,664
Brian, you're messing with my business.
When Dominic drives, he's golden.

47
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:31,415
Kids pour in. They want everything he has.
Every performance part. They pay cash!

48
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,787
- What did Dominic say?
- You don't want to know.

49
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:37,994
- What did Dominic say?
- He wants you out of here.

50
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,576
- He wants me out of here?
- Yes.

51
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,860
- And what did you say to Dom?
- What do you think I said?

52
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:46,687
I told him, "Good help is hard to find."

53
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,960
Relax.

54
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:55,913
I need NOS.

55
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:58,626
- I need NOS.
- No.

56
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:01,563
My car topped out at 140 miles per hour,
this morning.

57
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:05,961
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. I've
seen how you drive. You've a heavy foot.

58
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,935
- You'll blow yourself to pieces.
- I need one of these.

59
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:13,553
One of the big ones.
Actually, let's make it two.

60
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:16,272
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

61
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:31,304
Hold up, hold up.
Look at this snowman right here, man.

62
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:38,537
Sweet ride.
What you running under there, man?

63
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:44,167
- Going to make me find out the hard way?
- Hell, yeah.

64
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:47,128
You brave. You brave.
They call me Hector.

65
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:50,552
I got a last name, too,
but I can't pronounce it.

66
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,110
- Brian Spilner.
- Typical white-boy name.

67
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:55,344
Know what I'm saying?

68
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:02,395
See that over there? That's mine.
My baby. I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

69
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:04,607
- Why not?
- I'm going legit, homey.

70
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:07,366
Trying to get on the NIRA circuit.
Heard about that?

71
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:10,438
- Hell, yeah.
- So, what's up with you, man?

72
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,770
- I'm just waiting for Toretto.
- Shit. Better get in line. This yours?

73
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:18,469
- I'm standing next to it.
- That's funny.

74
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:21,296
You know,
Edwin happens to know a few things.

75
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,695
And one of the things Edwin knows is:
It's not how you stand by your car...

76
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,003
...it's how you race your car.
You better learn that.

77
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,887
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

78
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,118
- Dom.
- Marvin.

79
00:12:56,902 --> 00:13:00,342
- Hey, Dom. How you doing?
- Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?

80
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,668
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

81
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,545
I smell skanks.

82
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:17,056
Why don't you girls pack it up,
before I leave tread marks on your face?

83
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,219
Okay.

84
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:21,067
- Letty, I was just talking.
- Yeah. Whatever.

85
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,473
- Okay, Hector.
- Yeah? What's up, man?

86
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,787
- Yo. What's up?
- Edwin.

87
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,213
- How we doing this tonight?
- One race.

88
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,771
$2,000 buy-in. Winner takes all.
Hector, you're going to hold the cash.

89
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,321
- Why Hector?
- Too slow to make away with the money.

90
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:43,465
- Okay. Good luck, guys.
- Hey, wait. Hold up.

91
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:47,755
I don't have any cash.
But I do have the pink slip to my car.

92
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:52,093
You just can't climb in the ring with Ali,
'cause you think you box.

93
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,579
He knows I can box. Check it out.
It's like this.

94
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:59,674
I lose, the winner takes my car.
Clean and clear.

95
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:03,459
But if I win, I take the cash,
and I take the respect.

96
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:05,223
Respect.

97
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:09,922
To some people, that's more important.

98
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:13,427
That your car?

99
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:21,876
I see a cool air intake. It's got a NOS
fogger system and a T4 turbo, Dominic.

100
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:27,041
I see an AIC controller.
It has direct port nitrous injection.

101
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:30,175
Yeah. And a stand-alone
fuel management system.

102
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,251
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

103
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,779
You see that shit?

104
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:41,835
He's got enough NOS in there
to blow himself up. Period.

105
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:45,968
- So, what do you say? Am I worthy?
- We don't know yet.

106
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,527
But you're in. Let's go.

107
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:50,956
- All right.
- Let's go!

108
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:59,142
- What the hell is going on around here?
- Street's closed, pizza boy.

109
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,599
- Find another way home.
- Goddamn street racers.

110
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,590
<i>Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high.
They've blocked the street.</i>

111
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:55,259
Edwin.

112
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:59,699
This is yours, whether you win or lose.

113
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:03,216
But if you win, you get her, too.

114
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,314
You're going to win.

115
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:17,273
I'm going to win.

116
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:04,477
<i>We had a reported homicide.
187, at Barabian Liquors.</i>

117
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,879
I've got a 187 in Glendale.
Cops are all over it. We're good to roll.

118
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:11,128
- All right.
- Let's race!

119
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:12,229
Right.

120
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:22,792
Go!

121
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:38,044
Hell, yeah!

122
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:55,748
Damn, that guy's fast.

123
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,030
Let's go! MÃ©nage!

124
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:35,867
No! Monica!

125
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:53,148
Shut up!

126
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:49,371
Well done, baby!

127
00:20:58,818 --> 00:21:00,618
Come on. Come on. Back up.

128
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,729
Here's what you won, right here.
There you go.

129
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:07,709
You were racing a bunch of skateboards.
Know what I mean?

130
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:11,805
My sister holds the money. Count it.

131
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,480
And you're my trophy.

132
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:23,558
- Hey, Monica. What's up, baby?
- What's your problem? You didn't win.

133
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:27,922
Fuck you then!

134
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,520
Was that fun?

135
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:44,621
Got a problem there, buddy?

136
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:54,575
- What are you smiling about?
- Dude. I almost had you.

137
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:59,265
You almost had me?

138
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:02,366
You never had me.
You never had your car.

139
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:08,802
Granny-shifting.
Not double-clutching, like you should.

140
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,850
You're lucky that 100-shot of NOS
didn't blow the welds on the intake.

141
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:19,472
- Almost had me?
- You tell him, Dominic. Get out of here.

142
00:22:21,028 --> 00:22:23,988
Now, me and the mad scientist
got to rip apart the block...

143
00:22:24,198 --> 00:22:26,638
...and replace the piston rings you fried.

144
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,502
Ask any racer. Any real racer.

145
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:41,617
It don't matter if you win by an inch
or a mile. Winning's winning.

146
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:43,371
Yeah!

147
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:51,975
<i>All available units,
we have street-racing along Hawthorne...</i>

148
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:53,985
Oh, shit! We got cops. Cops!

149
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:55,596
Go!

150
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:09,088
Cops! Get in the car! Go!

151
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:35,535
<i>Toretto, stop right there!</i>

152
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:38,376
<i>Toretto!</i>

153
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:54,597
Get in!

154
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:44,394
You're the last person in the world
I expected to show up.

155
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:49,459
I thought if I got in your good graces,
you might let me keep my car.

156
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:53,069
You are in my good graces,
but you ain't keeping your car.

157
00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:56,962
You drive like you've done this before.
Are you a wheelman?

158
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:59,448
- No.
- You boost cars?

159
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:04,005
- No. Never.
- Ever done time?

160
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:06,709
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

161
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:10,476
What about the two years
in juvie for boosting cars?

162
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:15,042
Tucson, right?

163
00:26:15,813 --> 00:26:18,773
I had Jesse run a profile on you,
Brian Earl Spilner.

164
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:23,483
He'll find anything on the Web.
Anything about anybody.

165
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:25,682
So, why bullshit?

166
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,890
So, what about you?

167
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:32,853
Two years in Lompoc.

168
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,679
I'll die before I go back.

169
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:45,764
- Oh, great.
- What?

170
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:51,086
It's going to be a long-ass night.
That's what.

171
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,799
Follow us.

172
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:51,615
I thought we had an agreement.
You stay away. I stay away.

173
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:54,766
Everybody stays happy.

174
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:57,158
We got lost.
What do you want me to tell you?

175
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:00,176
- Who's "we"?
- My new mechanic.

176
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:02,391
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

177
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:05,512
The guy in the snakeskin pants.
That's his cousin. Lance.

178
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:09,238
So, when are you going to give me a shot
at that Honda 2000 of yours?

179
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:11,794
- This your ride?
- It was. It's his now.

180
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,710
No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

181
00:28:17,022 --> 00:28:20,542
Then, it's nobody's car.
But somebody put in the wrench time.

182
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:27,219
- What do you think, Lance?
- It's an amazing machine.

183
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,475
Yes, indeed.

184
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:33,106
Let's go.

185
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:39,533
I'll see you in the desert next month.
Be ready to have your ass handed to you.

186
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:43,684
- You'll need more than that crotch rocket.
- I got something for you.

187
00:28:57,773 --> 00:29:01,133
- What the hell was that all about?
- Long story. I'll tell you later.

188
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:02,961
Let's get out of here.

189
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:31,471
NOS!

190
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:47,017
- So, what the hell was that all about?
- It's a long story.

191
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:49,833
Well, we got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

192
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:52,993
A business deal that went sour.

193
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,000
Plus, I made the mistake
of sleeping with his sister.

194
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,519
Take care.

195
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:31,139
Yo, Spilner.

196
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:34,741
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

197
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,019
Oh, shit.

198
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,991
We were all there, right? Falling behind.

199
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,556
- With all that nitrous.
- Yeah.

200
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,818
Yo, Dom. We were just about to go
looking for you, brother.

201
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,123
Where were you?

202
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,379
There were mass cops there. They came in
from every direction. It was orchestrated.

203
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,917
- This your beer?
- Yeah, that's my beer.

204
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,461
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

205
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,711
You can't detail a car with the cover on.

206
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,410
- Can't even get that right.
- You all right?

207
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,457
- Am I all right?
- It was just a question.

208
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,529
Yo, Dom.

209
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,792
- Why did you bring the buster here?
- 'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!

210
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,890
He didn't just run back to the fort!
The buster brought me back.

211
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:11,528
You can have any brew you want,
as long as it's a Corona.

212
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,869
- Thanks, man.
- That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.

213
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,179
You.

214
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:29,282
- Hey, bro. You got a bathroom?
- Upstairs. First door on the right.

215
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:48,956
He's got no call being up in here.
You don't know that fool for shit.

216
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:52,539
- He's right, Dom.
- There was a time when I didn't know you.

217
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,650
That was in the third grade!

218
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,340
- Yeah. So, what girls are here?
- You name it. You want mine?

219
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:03,847
- You need to shut the...
- You want two?

220
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:06,755
- You don't have anything?
- You look a bit tired.

221
00:33:06,948 --> 00:33:09,628
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

222
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:13,026
- Look at all our guests.
- How about you give me a massage?

223
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,940
Crazy lady.

224
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:28,235
You know you owe me
a 10-second car, right?

225
00:33:32,974 --> 00:33:34,174
Oh, shit.

226
00:33:40,023 --> 00:33:41,583
Did you wipe the seat?

227
00:33:44,904 --> 00:33:48,104
Jesus Christ! Would you cut this shit?
Come on!

228
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,150
- Come on. Let's go get me a drink.
- We were just about to get along.

229
00:34:02,464 --> 00:34:05,504
- So, what do you want?
- Anything, as long as it's cold.

230
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,700
You know, my brother likes you.
He usually doesn't like anybody.

231
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:14,051
- He's a complicated guy.
- Yeah? What about you?

232
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:19,595
- I'm simpler.
- You're a shitty liar.

233
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:23,641
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

234
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:28,005
- But there's a problem.
- What's that?

235
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:30,318
You need to get some sleep.

236
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:34,753
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

237
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:38,115
Come on. I'll take you home.

238
00:35:00,023 --> 00:35:02,823
<i>Show me your hands.
Very good. Now open the door.</i>

239
00:35:03,444 --> 00:35:06,404
<i>Put your hands on your head.
Behind your head.</i>

240
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:10,554
<i>Face the front of the vehicle,
walk backwards towards the rear.</i>

241
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,110
<i>Take two steps to your right.
Stop right there.</i>

242
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:21,093
- What did I do?
- Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

243
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:34,256
Damn!
Muse, will you take these things off?

244
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:37,275
- Shit. You put them on so tight.
- I like realism.

245
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:40,221
You never know who's watching, Brian.

246
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:48,253
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer
than the last place you confiscated.

247
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:52,572
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house
for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

248
00:35:52,911 --> 00:35:55,711
You see, even the cops
are Hollywood in Hollywood.

249
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:02,785
Okay, here he is,
fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

250
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:05,205
That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer.

251
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:07,544
- You told him what happened?
- He knows.

252
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:11,478
- Send the bill to Johnny Tran.
- The kid's giving me attitude?

253
00:36:11,723 --> 00:36:14,363
It doesn't speak well
for police/FBI relations, Tanner.

254
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,999
- I walk in the door and the guy's already...
- All right, all right.

255
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:20,391
We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

256
00:36:20,565 --> 00:36:23,685
Muse, why don't you make us
four iced cappuccinos, please?

257
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:26,143
- Come on.
- Regular or decaf, Sarge?

258
00:36:27,864 --> 00:36:29,224
Decaf, I think.

259
00:36:29,616 --> 00:36:32,216
Four hijackings in two months,
and we have nothing.

260
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,370
The DVD players and digital cameras
are worth $1.2 million...

261
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,260
...which brings the grand total
to $6 million plus.

262
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:41,178
We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.

263
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:43,765
That's why you're undercover.

264
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:47,724
You want that detective badge fast, kid.
And you want to know something?

265
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,980
The FBI can help,
if you come through for us.

266
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:54,019
What does the truckdriver say?

267
00:36:54,183 --> 00:36:57,543
He gave us the same M.O.:
Three Honda Civics, precision driving...

268
00:36:57,812 --> 00:37:00,652
...the same green neon glow
from under the chassis.

269
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:05,137
Lab says the skidmarks came back
the same: Mashamoto ZX tires.

270
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:08,003
So, we know it's somebody
in the street-racing world.

271
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:12,478
If we don't make this case, the truckers
will take matters into their own hands.

272
00:37:12,744 --> 00:37:14,384
I tell them we're close.

273
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:17,464
Are you going to make me a liar?

274
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,146
Look, what do we know?

275
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:21,653
We know this world
revolves around Toretto, right?

276
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:24,839
I'm not saying that he's the one
that's popping these trucks...

277
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:29,169
...but I can guarantee he knows who is.
It's just a matter of time until I win...

278
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:33,229
You want time, buy the magazine.
We don't have time.

279
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:37,185
Just get me something I can use.

280
00:37:39,146 --> 00:37:40,706
Is Harry cooperating?

281
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:44,338
Like a guy that'll do time
for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

282
00:37:44,568 --> 00:37:46,608
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

283
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:49,739
He's scared of him,
but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks.

284
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:52,271
- He's too controlled for that.
- Wait.

285
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:55,412
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character...

286
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:59,023
...but Toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death.

287
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:02,252
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain.

288
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:04,304
Do not turn your back on him.

289
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,320
Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.

290
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:14,211
- What about parts and service?
- Hold off on it.

291
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:16,633
Dom, I don't know what to do with it.

292
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:23,536
All right, what the hell is this?
What do you got there?

293
00:38:25,445 --> 00:38:27,725
- This is your car.
- My car?

294
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,330
I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.

295
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:35,214
You could push this across the finish line,
or tow it.

296
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:39,464
You couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

297
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:41,454
No faith.

298
00:38:41,627 --> 00:38:43,907
I have faith in you,
but this isn't a junkyard.

299
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,250
- This is a garage.
- Pop the hood.

300
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:47,874
- Pop the hood?
- Pop the hood.

301
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:54,574
-2JZ engine. No shit.
- And what did I tell you?

302
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:57,448
- I retract my previous statement.
- You know what?

303
00:38:57,644 --> 00:39:02,004
This will decimate all
after you put about $15,000 in it.

304
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:05,916
Or more,
if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

305
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:09,129
- We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.
- Yes!

306
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:13,257
I gotta get you racing again
so I can make some money off your ass.

307
00:39:13,995 --> 00:39:16,595
There's a show down in the desert
called Race Wars.

308
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,989
That's where you'll do it.

309
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:22,659
When you're not working at Harry's,
you're working here.

310
00:39:23,046 --> 00:39:26,646
If you can't find the right tool
in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

311
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:29,335
...you don't belong near a car.

312
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:34,293
He owns you now.

313
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:03,389
Tell me what you think about this.
Koni adjustables.

314
00:40:04,297 --> 00:40:06,417
Gonna save us about 2 pounds.

315
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:09,916
And they're gonna give us
better traction for the hole shot.

316
00:40:10,136 --> 00:40:11,336
All right?

317
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:14,182
This is your basic layout of the car.

318
00:40:14,391 --> 00:40:18,071
And that's pretty much
what it could look like when it's finished.

319
00:40:18,979 --> 00:40:20,299
Red, green.

320
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:24,341
- You should be going to MIT or something.
- Yeah, right.

321
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:27,914
No, I got that... What's it called?

322
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:31,155
That attention disorder...

323
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:34,887
- ADD?
- Yes, that shit. Yeah.

324
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:39,965
You know, I was good in algebra
and like math and shit.

325
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:44,559
Everything else I failed.
Dropped out of school.

326
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,549
I don't know.
It's just something about engines...

327
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:51,761
...that calms me down, you know.

328
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:15,145
- I'm outta here.
- Come on, dog.

329
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:18,431
- Yo, Dom.
- Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

330
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:21,424
Looks like you got
all the help you need, brother.

331
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:38,185
- Mia! The chicken's dry.
- All right. I'm coming out already.

332
00:41:43,691 --> 00:41:45,131
Here you go.

333
00:41:47,111 --> 00:41:48,471
Hey, hold up.

334
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:54,030
Because you were the first to reach in
to get the chicken, you say grace.

335
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:02,892
- Dear heavenly...
- Spirit.

336
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:06,232
Spirit. Thank you.

337
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:11,882
Thank you for providing us
with a direct port nitrous injection...

338
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:16,735
...four core intercoolers
and ball-bearing turbos...

339
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,420
...and titanium valve springs.

340
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:21,873
- Thank you.
- Amen.

341
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:24,946
- Not bad.
- Amen.

342
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,230
He was praying to the car gods, man.

343
00:42:28,697 --> 00:42:30,177
He's not the best.

344
00:42:30,324 --> 00:42:32,364
- What do you want?
- Practice.

345
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:33,856
Thank you, girl.

346
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:37,434
Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us."

347
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:40,305
I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.

348
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:43,424
- You know, I gotta eat.
- He's always hungry.

349
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:45,588
All right, sit down.

350
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,855
How you doing, Mia?

351
00:42:58,143 --> 00:42:59,703
Here you go.

352
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:08,875
- Jesse, hand me that chicken.
- Let's eat some grub, man.

353
00:43:09,072 --> 00:43:12,032
- Want some of that chicken?
- What, you rent a movie or something?

354
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,091
Need a hand with anything else?

355
00:43:21,293 --> 00:43:24,573
No, I'm good. You can go join the boys
and watch the movie.

356
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:28,775
- The cook doesn't clean where I come from.
- I'd like to go there.

357
00:43:34,098 --> 00:43:38,138
- I think we should go out sometime.
- No, I don't date my brother's friends.

358
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,460
That sucks.

359
00:43:40,605 --> 00:43:43,805
- I'll have to kick his ass then.
- I'd love to see that one.

360
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:47,145
I would pay to see that one, actually.

361
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:02,891
Wash my car when you get done.

362
00:44:03,044 --> 00:44:06,564
- What was that?
- No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.

363
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:09,909
Wear your favorite dress,
'cause when you're done...

364
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:13,213
...I'm putting you on the street
where you belong, cutie.

365
00:44:16,683 --> 00:44:20,203
Is this thing broken?
What's wrong with this thing?

366
00:44:21,647 --> 00:44:25,487
What was that Cuban restaurant
you wanted to take me to?

367
00:44:25,818 --> 00:44:27,698
The one with the picadillo and...

368
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:31,504
- With red candles, wooden tables...
- The plantain, food all over the place.

369
00:44:31,783 --> 00:44:33,583
- What it's called?
- Cha Cha Cha.

370
00:44:33,743 --> 00:44:35,623
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah.

371
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:38,751
Well, you can take me there.

372
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:41,519
Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?

373
00:44:42,252 --> 00:44:44,212
- Yeah, it's perfect.
- Good.

374
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:54,478
- There's no popcorn.
- Make your own goddamn popcorn!

375
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:11,094
All right. Now that's valet parking.

376
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:17,361
- Harry. What's up, dog?
- Nice to see you.

377
00:45:17,538 --> 00:45:19,258
Excellent. Come on in, man.

378
00:45:19,457 --> 00:45:22,417
- Check it. It's yours.
- Damn. What do we got here?

379
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:26,071
- Hired some new help?
- Don't even think about it.

380
00:45:26,297 --> 00:45:28,657
- What's up?
- What's up, Brian? How you feeling?

381
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:31,642
- Pretty good. What do you need?
- What's up, man?

382
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:35,205
I need you to hook me up.
Three of everything. I made a list.

383
00:45:37,017 --> 00:45:38,897
Why don't you look that over?

384
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:42,309
- When do you need this stuff by?
- Tomorrow, today, now.

385
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:44,976
- Right.
- White boys work fast, don't they?

386
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:49,642
That's right.

387
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:55,935
- You said you need three of each?
- Yeah, three of everything.

388
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:59,430
What do you think about that?
Check this out.

389
00:48:07,673 --> 00:48:09,153
He moans like a cop.

390
00:48:18,517 --> 00:48:22,517
Brian, this is one of those times
you need to be clear about what you say.

391
00:48:23,439 --> 00:48:25,319
Nod if you understand me.

392
00:48:25,525 --> 00:48:26,725
Nod!

393
00:48:28,653 --> 00:48:30,013
Sit up.

394
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:38,888
Tell me what the hell you're doing
down here.

395
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:41,649
Shit. What I'm doing?

396
00:48:44,336 --> 00:48:45,656
Dom.

397
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:50,565
I owe you a 10-second car.

398
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:55,076
And what this is about,
this is about Race Wars.

399
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:02,114
I just went in there,
and Hector is gonna be running...

400
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:05,212
...three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.

401
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:08,161
And on top of that,
he just came into Harry's...

402
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,440
...and he ordered three T66 turbos,
with NOS...

403
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,202
...and a MoTeC system exhaust.

404
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,471
So, what are you saying?

405
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:27,111
You're gonna check everybody's shit out,
one garage after another?

406
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,575
Yeah.

407
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,231
Because, Dom, you know I can't lose again.

408
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,714
He's a cop.

409
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,146
He's a cop!

410
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:49,808
You a cop?

411
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,089
Let's go for a little ride.

412
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,528
Walk!

413
00:50:21,979 --> 00:50:23,619
Okay. You stand watch.

414
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:55,989
Yo, Dominic.

415
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,410
There's no engines.

416
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:03,284
What are they planning on racing with,
hopes and dreams?

417
00:51:03,481 --> 00:51:05,761
I don't know, but they're sneaky as shit...

418
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:08,703
...and they've got enough money
to buy anything.

419
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:14,871
What?

420
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:25,365
We got a wolf pack.

421
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,440
<i>It's Johnny Tran,
and he's coming your way really fast.</i>

422
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:32,569
All right, we got company. Spilner.

423
00:51:58,663 --> 00:52:00,863
Come on. Move!

424
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:03,167
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

425
00:52:04,752 --> 00:52:07,792
- Do you see anything wrong here?
- No.

426
00:52:11,843 --> 00:52:14,123
- We got no engines, do we?
- No.

427
00:52:14,345 --> 00:52:15,545
- Do we?
- No.

428
00:52:18,724 --> 00:52:21,164
A couple of Nissan SR20 motors
will pull a premium...

429
00:52:21,394 --> 00:52:24,274
- ...one week before Race Wars, huh?
- Yeah, probably.

430
00:52:24,814 --> 00:52:27,694
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

431
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:31,119
What are you feeling, Lance?

432
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:34,219
40-weight?

433
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:36,503
50-weight?

434
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:38,884
A 40-weight sounds nice.

435
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:56,034
Where are they, Ted?

436
00:52:56,264 --> 00:52:57,984
- Where are they?
- Enough!

437
00:52:58,266 --> 00:53:00,626
- Where are they?
- They're in a warehouse.

438
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,111
They're in a warehouse, man!

439
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,696
Ted.

440
00:53:20,872 --> 00:53:22,432
Kiss my shoes?

441
00:53:34,804 --> 00:53:36,604
Let's go get our engines.

442
00:53:37,556 --> 00:53:40,236
My superiors are flying in from D.C.,
in two days.

443
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:41,994
I want something to show.

444
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:44,505
We've got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth...

445
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:48,171
...automatic weapons,
priors on every one of these Asian punks...

446
00:53:48,443 --> 00:53:51,643
...a garage full of DVD players
and generally psychotic behavior.

447
00:53:51,863 --> 00:53:55,063
Tell me why we shouldn't move
on Tran now and figure it out later?

448
00:53:55,325 --> 00:53:56,965
Because all we have is behavior.

449
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,120
Let me get hard evidence,
because what we have now is just...

450
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,210
What we have is probable cause.

451
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:06,096
And truckers arming themselves for some
good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.

452
00:54:06,378 --> 00:54:10,298
- Tell us about Hector, Brian.
- Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

453
00:54:10,716 --> 00:54:14,156
Hector's still working on the engines,
but the tires don't match.

454
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:16,107
Will somebody give me a cigarette?

455
00:54:16,264 --> 00:54:18,304
- Get him a cigarette.
- Don't give him one.

456
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:21,001
- I thought you quit.
- I did. Just give me one.

457
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:22,825
- Get him a cigarette.
- No!

458
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:26,791
Tell me about Toretto.

459
00:54:27,108 --> 00:54:29,788
I told you,
I think he's too controlled for this.

460
00:54:29,986 --> 00:54:34,426
Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way.
Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it.

461
00:54:34,991 --> 00:54:38,511
- I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.
- What did you say?

462
00:54:38,745 --> 00:54:42,185
I don't blame you.
I'd get off on her surveillance photos, too.

463
00:54:45,127 --> 00:54:46,327
Knock it off!

464
00:54:47,546 --> 00:54:49,986
What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

465
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:56,882
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

466
00:54:57,264 --> 00:54:59,464
- Yeah. I memorized that file.
- Read it again.

467
00:54:59,684 --> 00:55:01,964
No, better still, take a look at these.

468
00:55:03,896 --> 00:55:07,096
Remember I told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death?

469
00:55:07,692 --> 00:55:10,812
Toretto did this
with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.

470
00:55:11,488 --> 00:55:13,368
He's a model of self-control.

471
00:55:16,368 --> 00:55:18,008
I need a few more days.

472
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,951
I need a few more days.

473
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:26,479
Got a TR7 here,
with a ball-bearing upgrade.

474
00:55:27,921 --> 00:55:31,601
What it's going to do is,
it's going to spool up really quick.

475
00:55:31,967 --> 00:55:34,327
- I got this set up for 24 psi.
- Got it.

476
00:55:37,973 --> 00:55:39,693
You got big plans tonight?

477
00:55:41,894 --> 00:55:43,934
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

478
00:55:45,648 --> 00:55:48,088
You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

479
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:50,299
That's not gonna happen.

480
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:57,253
I want to show you something.

481
00:56:11,633 --> 00:56:13,273
Me and my dad built her.

482
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:16,499
Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle.

483
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,090
It's a beast.

484
00:56:19,725 --> 00:56:22,485
- You know what she ran in Palmdale?
- No. What?

485
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,170
Nine seconds flat.

486
00:56:25,731 --> 00:56:27,771
- God.
- My dad was driving.

487
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,440
So much torque,
the chassis twisted coming off the line.

488
00:56:33,697 --> 00:56:35,577
Barely kept her on the track.

489
00:56:36,408 --> 00:56:39,208
- So, what's your best time?
- I've never driven her.

490
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:40,452
Why not?

491
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:45,129
It scares the shit out of me.

492
00:56:47,628 --> 00:56:48,828
That's my dad.

493
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:52,981
He was coming up
in the pro stock-car circuit.

494
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,150
Last race of the season.

495
00:56:56,346 --> 00:57:00,386
A guy named Kenny Linder
came up from inside, in the final turn.

496
00:57:01,393 --> 00:57:04,753
He clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120.

497
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:10,347
I watched my dad burn to death.

498
00:57:12,989 --> 00:57:14,949
I remembered hearing him scream.

499
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:22,604
But the people that were there
said he had died before the tanks blew.

500
00:57:29,172 --> 00:57:31,452
They said it was me who was screaming.

501
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:37,374
I saw Linder about a week later.

502
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:42,170
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

503
00:57:42,644 --> 00:57:47,164
And I didn't intend to keep hitting him,
but when I finished, I couldn't lift my arm.

504
00:57:52,738 --> 00:57:54,938
He's a janitor at a high school.

505
00:57:56,158 --> 00:57:58,598
He has to take the bus to work every day.

506
00:57:59,912 --> 00:58:02,512
And they banned me
from the tracks for life.

507
00:58:08,254 --> 00:58:10,614
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

508
00:58:12,592 --> 00:58:15,272
Nothing else matters.
Not the mortgage, not the store...

509
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:17,830
...not my team and all their bullshit.

510
00:58:19,683 --> 00:58:21,963
For those 10 seconds or less...

511
00:58:23,562 --> 00:58:25,122
...I'm free.

512
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:48,829
So, how is it, anyways,
that the gang came to be?

513
00:58:49,213 --> 00:58:50,253
- What?
- The gang.

514
00:58:50,422 --> 00:58:52,702
The gang?
No, they don't call themselves a gang.

515
00:58:52,925 --> 00:58:55,125
- What do they call themselves?
- They're a team.

516
00:58:55,344 --> 00:58:59,184
- They call themselves a team.
- All right. How did the team come to be?

517
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:02,007
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

518
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,040
- I've got time.
- Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.

519
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:11,151
Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up,
as you can tell.

520
00:59:11,403 --> 00:59:13,283
But they were friends as kids.

521
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:16,053
And Letty, she just lived down the street.

522
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:19,486
Always into cars, though.
Ever since she was, like, 10 years old.

523
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:23,143
So, naturally, you know,
my brother always had her attention.

524
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:27,478
- And then she turned 16...
- And then she had Dom's attention.

525
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,720
Yeah. It's funny how that works, isn't it?

526
00:59:31,591 --> 00:59:32,791
Yeah.

527
00:59:36,137 --> 00:59:38,497
How does Jesse fit into the whole thing?

528
00:59:38,764 --> 00:59:43,524
Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of
showed up one night and never, ever left.

529
00:59:44,562 --> 00:59:47,682
It's just the way my brother is, you know.
Dom's like...

530
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,280
He's like gravity.

531
00:59:52,487 --> 00:59:54,607
Everything just gets pulled to him.

532
00:59:56,324 --> 00:59:57,644
Even you.

533
00:59:59,911 --> 01:00:01,231
No.

534
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:02,733
No.

535
01:00:03,248 --> 01:00:05,968
The only thing that pulled me in was you.

536
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,888
Being friends with your brother
is just a bonus.

537
01:00:11,757 --> 01:00:13,237
That's good.

538
01:00:15,136 --> 01:00:18,496
That's good. It's nice to come first
every once in a while.

539
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,270
Want to go for a drive?

540
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:04,179
<i>- Yeah?
- The hijackers have hit again.</i>

541
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:09,235
<i>Bilkins has decided that we're gonna move
on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00.</i>

542
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:11,367
<i>Unless you say otherwise.</i>

543
01:01:11,527 --> 01:01:13,327
<i>If you agree, just say yes.</i>

544
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:15,910
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

545
01:01:18,284 --> 01:01:19,924
It's just a wrong number.

546
01:04:12,256 --> 01:04:14,296
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but...

547
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:17,194
Yeah. Yes, sir.

548
01:04:17,512 --> 01:04:18,872
Yeah. I got it.

549
01:04:23,309 --> 01:04:25,269
The DVD players were purchased legally.

550
01:04:25,437 --> 01:04:28,557
All we've got are a couple
of low-rent weapons charges...

551
01:04:28,774 --> 01:04:30,974
...and some outstanding speeding tickets.

552
01:04:31,151 --> 01:04:32,711
- So, they're out.
- Yeah.

553
01:04:33,028 --> 01:04:34,548
Father bailed them out.

554
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:39,339
Is this the kind of intelligence
I can expect from you, O'Conner?

555
01:04:44,332 --> 01:04:47,372
- You're gonna put this on me?
- I can put it on whoever I want to.

556
01:04:47,585 --> 01:04:50,185
- Perks of the job.
- No, you can't put this on me...

557
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,180
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.

558
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,380
I don't care if you have to aim at someone
and blow your cover to smithereens.

559
01:04:56,635 --> 01:04:59,075
You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard...

560
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:02,223
...or you might want to think
about another career.

561
01:05:13,403 --> 01:05:16,683
It's Toretto, Brian.
It always has been Toretto.

562
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,000
Tran and Hector are...

563
01:05:20,494 --> 01:05:22,214
They're just fumes.

564
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:28,141
I know you've been lying to me.
My question is this:

565
01:05:28,335 --> 01:05:31,855
Have you been lying to yourself
because you can't see past Mia?

566
01:05:34,633 --> 01:05:36,513
He won't go back to prison.

567
01:05:37,595 --> 01:05:40,355
Well, that's a choice
he's going to have to make.

568
01:05:44,561 --> 01:05:46,841
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

569
01:05:48,398 --> 01:05:51,078
And that's a choice
you're gonna have to make.

570
01:06:09,211 --> 01:06:11,091
You ready for this?

571
01:06:37,615 --> 01:06:40,335
Nice car.
What's the retail on one of those?

572
01:06:41,077 --> 01:06:43,517
More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

573
01:06:49,837 --> 01:06:51,277
Smoke him.

574
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,990
So, what's wrong, Brian?

575
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,663
Nothing, man, I'm fine.

576
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:54,312
Come on. Obviously something's off.

577
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:58,508
Look, I have my good days and bad days
just like anybody else.

578
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,807
Brian, don't lose that cool of yours.
That's your meal ticket.

579
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,634
My meal ticket?
I can't pay for my own shrimp?

580
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,317
I got the shrimp.

581
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,234
No, that's one thing about me
you don't understand.

582
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:15,983
I don't take handouts.
I earn my way, every step.

583
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,331
I need something extra on the side,
like you.

584
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,392
What do you mean, like me?

585
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:24,525
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what I mean.

586
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:27,326
- What does that mean, like me?
- Don't try...

587
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,529
I'm not stupid, all right?

588
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:33,943
I know that there's no way you paid
for all that shit you got under the hood...

589
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:37,394
There's no way you paid for
what's under the hood of those cars...

590
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:40,296
...by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.

591
01:08:41,244 --> 01:08:44,124
Whatever it is you're in on,
I want in on it, too.

592
01:09:07,104 --> 01:09:09,064
- Well, what is this?
- Read it.

593
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:12,181
- What is this for?
- It's directions.

594
01:09:14,277 --> 01:09:15,917
To Race Wars.

595
01:09:16,488 --> 01:09:18,208
We'll see how you go.

596
01:09:19,283 --> 01:09:20,843
Then we'll talk.

597
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:08,768
- How's it going?
- What's up?

598
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:11,478
- Welcome to Race Wars.
- Great. Thanks a lot.

599
01:10:34,986 --> 01:10:36,626
Baby. Hey, baby.

600
01:10:37,864 --> 01:10:39,584
You should watch from the side.

601
01:10:39,783 --> 01:10:42,143
I wouldn't want to get exhaust
on that pretty face.

602
01:10:42,327 --> 01:10:46,247
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- I'll race you for that sweet little ass.

603
01:10:46,498 --> 01:10:48,858
You want ass,
why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?

604
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:52,003
You want an adrenaline rush,
it'll be two large.

605
01:10:52,213 --> 01:10:55,093
Right here. Right now.
What's it gonna be?

606
01:10:57,885 --> 01:10:59,245
You got it.

607
01:11:19,324 --> 01:11:21,284
"Another one bites the dust"

608
01:11:24,663 --> 01:11:26,463
Come on. What you got?

609
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,690
See ya.

610
01:12:04,746 --> 01:12:07,586
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up, Jesse?

611
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:09,367
What's in your hand?

612
01:12:09,543 --> 01:12:11,823
Throwing down the pink slip, just like you.

613
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:14,524
- The pink slip to what? The Jetta?
- Yeah.

614
01:12:15,049 --> 01:12:17,489
- You can't bet your dad's car.
- It's all right.

615
01:12:17,677 --> 01:12:18,877
I ain't losing.

616
01:12:19,052 --> 01:12:22,412
This fool is running a Honda 2000.
I'll win.

617
01:12:22,723 --> 01:12:27,083
That way, me and my dad can roll
when he gets out of prison. It's all good.

618
01:12:27,353 --> 01:12:30,793
They're gonna throw him right back
in prison after he kills you.

619
01:12:38,614 --> 01:12:40,494
You visualize the win.

620
01:12:40,658 --> 01:12:44,178
Visualize the win, Jesse. I'm serious.
You got to listen to me, man.

621
01:12:44,412 --> 01:12:45,892
Who are you racing?

622
01:12:50,335 --> 01:12:52,455
Jesse, don't do it.

623
01:12:52,671 --> 01:12:56,191
I bet you he's got more than $100,000
under the hood of that car.

624
01:13:19,491 --> 01:13:21,011
Too soon, junior.

625
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:25,504
No!

626
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:29,828
Shit!

627
01:13:30,543 --> 01:13:31,663
Oh, God!

628
01:13:42,139 --> 01:13:44,699
Yo! Heads up, bro. We got problems.

629
01:13:44,891 --> 01:13:46,531
- What?
- Jesse.

630
01:13:48,145 --> 01:13:50,105
Where's Jesse going?

631
01:13:50,356 --> 01:13:53,716
- He just raced Tran for slips.
- Oh, shit.

632
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:08,498
- Where's he going?
- He went to the car wash.

633
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:10,755
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

634
01:14:11,419 --> 01:14:12,979
Go fetch your car?

635
01:14:14,005 --> 01:14:15,565
We're not on your block.

636
01:14:15,757 --> 01:14:18,277
You better watch who you talk to like that.

637
01:14:18,927 --> 01:14:19,967
Toretto!

638
01:14:23,349 --> 01:14:25,149
SWAT came into my house...

639
01:14:26,184 --> 01:14:30,264
...disrespected my whole family,
because somebody narked me out.

640
01:14:31,148 --> 01:14:33,508
And you know what? It was you!

641
01:14:57,967 --> 01:14:59,927
Get off of him, man.

642
01:15:09,354 --> 01:15:11,074
Dom, chill out, man. Come on!

643
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,951
I never narked on nobody!

644
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,510
I never narked on nobody!

645
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:55,691
Mia.

646
01:16:00,491 --> 01:16:02,771
I have respected you
and I haven't said shit.

647
01:16:02,951 --> 01:16:04,591
Now I am asking you not to go.

648
01:16:04,787 --> 01:16:07,547
- I'm doing this for both of us.
- Don't give me that crap.

649
01:16:07,748 --> 01:16:09,148
You're doing this for you.

650
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:13,251
Why are you insisting on doing this?
Dom, please, just don't.

651
01:16:25,392 --> 01:16:27,752
- Mia, what's going on?
- What?

652
01:16:27,978 --> 01:16:30,338
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, I don't.

653
01:16:30,564 --> 01:16:33,684
You always have tears in your eyes
when Dom drives away?

654
01:16:33,941 --> 01:16:35,421
What's the matter with you?

655
01:16:35,568 --> 01:16:38,008
What's he racing off
in the middle of the night for?

656
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:41,278
- You know about the trucks?
- No, Brian! What trucks?

657
01:16:41,491 --> 01:16:45,171
- Jesus Christ. What?
- Listen to me.

658
01:16:46,621 --> 01:16:48,021
Mia, I'm a cop.

659
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:52,185
What are you talking about, Brian?
What is this?

660
01:16:52,377 --> 01:16:55,657
Ever since the first time I met you,
I've been undercover.

661
01:16:57,091 --> 01:16:58,211
I'm a cop.

662
01:17:03,347 --> 01:17:04,907
Oh, you bastard.

663
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:09,010
You bastard.

664
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:13,201
- Mia.
- Get off of me, Brian!

665
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,040
Mia! Listen to me!

666
01:17:16,403 --> 01:17:18,843
Everything I ever said
I felt about you was real.

667
01:17:19,072 --> 01:17:21,592
I swear to God.
You have to believe me, Mia.

668
01:17:21,783 --> 01:17:25,223
But this isn't about you and me.
Your brother's out there to pull a job.

669
01:17:25,496 --> 01:17:28,776
We're running out of time. Those truckers
aren't laying down anymore.

670
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:32,641
Maybe they'll make it through tonight,
but every law enforcement agency...

671
01:17:32,878 --> 01:17:34,518
...is coming down on them.

672
01:17:34,672 --> 01:17:37,472
If you don't want anything to happen
to them...

673
01:17:37,674 --> 01:17:40,634
...you have to get in that car
with me right now and help me.

674
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:45,504
Mia, you are the only person
that can help me right now.

675
01:17:46,433 --> 01:17:49,633
Please, Mia. Please help me.

676
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:04,419
Civics are stashed somewhere
outside of Thermal.

677
01:18:04,619 --> 01:18:07,739
They wouldn't double back,
and Highway 10 is too well patrolled.

678
01:18:07,998 --> 01:18:10,838
- So, what does that leave us with?
- All this.

679
01:18:19,885 --> 01:18:22,645
<i>- Nextel.
- This is Officer Brian O'Conner.</i>

680
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:27,130
Serial number 34762.
I need a cell phone trace.

681
01:18:27,518 --> 01:18:30,398
<i>- Okay. What's the cell number?
- Mia, what is it?</i>

682
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:35,730
Come on, Mia.
She needs Dom's cell phone number now.

683
01:18:39,196 --> 01:18:43,716
323-555-6439.

684
01:18:44,994 --> 01:18:47,434
Thank you. Yeah, you get that?

685
01:19:13,774 --> 01:19:17,454
All right, we're one man short.
Letty, I need you on the left side.

686
01:19:19,906 --> 01:19:23,106
Your sister's right about this one.
This don't feel good.

687
01:19:23,368 --> 01:19:27,328
- Don't do that.
- Something's wrong.

688
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:30,300
- Stop.
- We shouldn't be doing this without Jesse.

689
01:19:31,543 --> 01:19:34,383
This is the mother lode.
We've been on this for three months.

690
01:19:34,588 --> 01:19:36,948
After this, it's a long vacation for everyone.

691
01:19:37,174 --> 01:19:39,054
- Let's go.
- I hope so.

692
01:19:42,679 --> 01:19:45,639
Listen, the other night I had a dream...

693
01:19:46,266 --> 01:19:48,866
...that you and I were
on the beach in Mexico.

694
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,312
- Really?
- Really.

695
01:19:54,566 --> 01:19:56,606
Come on. Let's make this happen.

696
01:19:59,822 --> 01:20:04,102
- Leon, keep on those scanners.
- Copy that.

697
01:20:07,872 --> 01:20:09,832
All right, let's go.

698
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:23,470
<i>Okay, we traced the number
to the northbound 86.</i>

699
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:27,960
<i>Mile 114, outside Coachella.
We'll keep the trace open, Officer.</i>

700
01:20:28,519 --> 01:20:29,879
Let me see this.

701
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:36,854
I think we're about 40 miles away.

702
01:20:37,403 --> 01:20:38,963
What are you gonna do?

703
01:20:40,323 --> 01:20:42,203
What are you gonna do?

704
01:21:14,608 --> 01:21:16,568
Okay! Go time!

705
01:21:32,377 --> 01:21:34,737
We're all good.
I got nothing on the scanners.

706
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:36,121
Keep going.

707
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:51,890
Vince!

708
01:21:52,605 --> 01:21:54,565
Vince, don't! Get back in!

709
01:21:56,276 --> 01:21:57,316
Vince!

710
01:22:03,033 --> 01:22:04,673
He's got a damn shotgun! Leon!

711
01:22:04,826 --> 01:22:07,026
Back off! Get him off of there!

712
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:10,990
Oh, shit!

713
01:22:22,136 --> 01:22:24,696
Get me off this thing! Pull up!

714
01:22:25,932 --> 01:22:29,132
Unhook yourself. Do it!

715
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:31,524
- Do it!
- I can't get...

716
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:33,050
You can do it!

717
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:35,549
Come on, Vince!

718
01:22:43,117 --> 01:22:45,557
Dom! I'm pulling up to distract him!

719
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:54,568
Come on, boy!

720
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,877
Shot doesn't get better than this.

721
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,212
Son of a bitch!

722
01:23:09,143 --> 01:23:11,343
Take me off here,
or I'll have to unhook the wire!

723
01:23:11,562 --> 01:23:15,642
Try it again. One, two, three!

724
01:23:27,829 --> 01:23:29,349
Unhook yourself!

725
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:32,966
I can't get my arm free!

726
01:23:33,127 --> 01:23:35,247
- Vince, grab my hand!
- My arm!

727
01:23:35,462 --> 01:23:37,182
Listen, give me your hand.

728
01:23:37,423 --> 01:23:39,783
I'm gonna pull you off the rig!

729
01:23:43,054 --> 01:23:44,614
Vince!

730
01:23:44,764 --> 01:23:46,644
Hold on!

731
01:23:46,849 --> 01:23:48,889
Give me your hand! Listen to me!

732
01:23:55,816 --> 01:23:56,776
Dominic!

733
01:23:56,901 --> 01:23:58,021
Shit!

734
01:24:01,656 --> 01:24:03,696
- Dominic!
- Hang on!

735
01:24:04,367 --> 01:24:07,167
Dom! Move out of the way.
I'm coming to get him.

736
01:24:32,396 --> 01:24:33,676
Letty!

737
01:24:34,524 --> 01:24:35,484
Leon!

738
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,690
Pull back for Letty.

739
01:24:36,818 --> 01:24:38,018
<i>Get her out of there!</i>

740
01:24:38,194 --> 01:24:39,554
I'm on it! Go!

741
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:51,349
I've got her! You get Vince off that truck.

742
01:24:56,797 --> 01:24:58,917
Letty! Come on, baby.

743
01:25:00,091 --> 01:25:01,131
You okay?

744
01:25:01,259 --> 01:25:03,539
Oh, shit. Come on, girl, you all right?

745
01:25:03,762 --> 01:25:07,202
Come on, let me look at you.
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

746
01:25:21,155 --> 01:25:22,595
Vince!

747
01:25:50,936 --> 01:25:52,056
Take the wheel.

748
01:25:52,188 --> 01:25:54,788
- What do you mean?
- Put your foot on the gas!

749
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,850
I'm gonna get him.
Put your foot on the gas!

750
01:25:58,027 --> 01:25:59,227
Okay!

751
01:26:02,656 --> 01:26:05,616
- Come on. Keep it steady.
- I got it!

752
01:26:07,286 --> 01:26:09,166
All right, hold on, Vince.

753
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:12,839
He's having a hard time holding on.
Get me a little closer.

754
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,242
All right.

755
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:17,209
- Closer.
- I'm moving in.

756
01:26:17,713 --> 01:26:19,233
Hold it right there!

757
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,173
Go!

758
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:25,826
You got to hang in here with me now!

759
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:28,096
We'll get you off. Give me your arm!

760
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:30,348
Vince, look at me! Don't let go!

761
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,879
Come on, Vince!
Throw this arm around me!

762
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:40,018
Vince, don't let go!

763
01:26:44,367 --> 01:26:46,327
Come on, Mia. Get closer!

764
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,640
Mia, get closer! Come on.

765
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:55,593
Come on, Vince. Here we go!

766
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:24,940
Shit.

767
01:27:28,662 --> 01:27:32,022
It's gonna be okay, Letty. I love you.

768
01:27:35,461 --> 01:27:37,021
- Watch her.
- I got her.

769
01:27:38,005 --> 01:27:40,445
Come on, Vince! Hang in there! Come on!

770
01:27:44,721 --> 01:27:47,761
If he doesn't get to an ambulance
in 10 minutes, he's dead.

771
01:27:47,974 --> 01:27:50,334
- Hold the pressure. Hold his arm up.
- I got it.

772
01:27:56,358 --> 01:27:59,198
Yeah. Yeah, this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

773
01:27:59,528 --> 01:28:01,888
I'm off-duty MAPD.

774
01:28:02,114 --> 01:28:04,794
I need a life flight roll out right away.

775
01:28:06,035 --> 01:28:10,155
My 20 is Highway 86, mile marker 147.

776
01:28:10,872 --> 01:28:13,752
I got one trauma victim,
about 24 years of age.

777
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:16,441
Six-foot, maybe 200 pounds.

778
01:28:16,753 --> 01:28:20,353
He's got a deep laceration to his right arm
with arterial bleeding.

779
01:28:20,591 --> 01:28:24,791
And he's got a shotgun wound
close range to his left flank.

780
01:28:26,889 --> 01:28:28,689
Yeah, he's going into shock!

781
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,670
Dom, put the gun down now!

782
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:15,095
- Move your car.
- No bullshit!

783
01:30:15,293 --> 01:30:17,653
Put it down now! No more running!

784
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:19,359
I'm not running!

785
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:24,831
- Where's Leon and Letty?
- They're long gone!

786
01:30:25,053 --> 01:30:27,933
Then it's over.
I didn't call the police, but don't push me!

787
01:30:28,181 --> 01:30:30,981
- Put the gun down. I swear to God!
- You are the cop!

788
01:30:31,185 --> 01:30:32,545
You're a cop!

789
01:30:34,188 --> 01:30:37,388
Brian, I got to find Jesse before they do.

790
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:40,410
- I'm all the kid's got.
- I'll call in the plates.

791
01:30:40,611 --> 01:30:44,131
PD will pick him up way before
Johnny even gets near him.

792
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:47,770
- Move your car.
- Dom, stop it! It's over. Please.

793
01:30:48,077 --> 01:30:49,717
Mia, stay out of it!

794
01:30:55,335 --> 01:30:58,375
Dominic, I am so sorry.

795
01:30:58,922 --> 01:31:01,042
I don't know what I'm doing, Dom.

796
01:31:01,216 --> 01:31:05,296
I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what's going on.

797
01:31:05,554 --> 01:31:08,194
What were you thinking, man?

798
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:10,750
I don't know! I panicked! I'm sorry.

799
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,776
I'm scared!

800
01:31:12,979 --> 01:31:15,939
I don't know what I'm doing!
Will you please help me?

801
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:22,051
Dom!

802
01:31:40,965 --> 01:31:42,245
Jesse!

803
01:31:42,384 --> 01:31:43,824
No, Jesse!

804
01:31:58,609 --> 01:32:00,169
No, Dom, no!

805
01:34:55,125 --> 01:34:58,325
Call 911. You call 911!

806
01:35:33,331 --> 01:35:35,971
I used to drag here back in high school.

807
01:35:36,793 --> 01:35:40,793
That railroad crossing up there
is exactly a quarter mile away from here.

808
01:35:42,132 --> 01:35:44,652
On green, I'm going for it.

809
01:38:19,337 --> 01:38:21,457
That's not what I had in mind.

810
01:39:08,137 --> 01:39:09,937
You know what you're doing?

811
01:39:10,515 --> 01:39:12,475
I owe you a 10-second car.

812
01:46:26,467 --> 01:46:29,027
<i>I live my life a quarter mile at a time.</i>

813
01:46:30,763 --> 01:46:32,323
<i>Nothing else matters.</i>

814
01:46:33,349 --> 01:46:35,949
<i>For those 10 seconds or less...</i>

815
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,720
<i>...I'm free.</i>
