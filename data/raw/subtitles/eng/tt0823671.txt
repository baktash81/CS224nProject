1
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:56,025
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>
<i>how nature gets its glow?</i>

2
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:03,067
<i>Who gives it light and color</i>
<i>as the seasons come and go?</i>

3
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:09,475
<i>Who helps all creatures,</i>
<i>great and small,</i>

4
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:12,170
<i>to walk, to swim, to fly?</i>

5
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:17,046
<i>Who crafts such tiny details?</i>

6
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,650
<i>You might see them if you try.</i>

7
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:29,959
<i>For it's all the work of fairies,</i>
<i>but they stay well out of sight.</i>

8
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:42,138
<i>And the first time that a baby laughs,</i>
<i>a fairy's life takes flight.</i>

9
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:44,933
<i>When the moon comes out</i>

10
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:47,171
<i>To shine her face</i>

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,044
<i>The birds are fast asleep</i>

12
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,521
<i>And the lanterns hang from every post</i>
<i>The fairies leave their keep</i>

13
00:01:56,623 --> 00:02:00,320
<i>They join their hands</i>
<i>and sing their songs</i>

14
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:03,328
<i>That nary a soul can hear</i>

15
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,331
<i>In the springtime</i>
<i>when the earth is new</i>

16
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,095
<i>To the fairies they draw near</i>

17
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:18,167
<i>To the fairies they draw near</i>

18
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:46,622
Hello.
- Hello.

19
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,223
- Hello.
- Hi.

20
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:49,961
- Hello.
- Hello.

21
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,830
Hello?

22
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:54,496
Queen Clarion.

23
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:08,912
Born of laughter, clothed in cheer,

24
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:11,820
happiness has brought you here.

25
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:16,795
Welcome to Pixie Hollow.
I trust you found your way all right.

26
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:18,958
I think so.

27
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,232
Now, let's see about those wings.

28
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,608
What are these things?

29
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:11,479
They will help you
find your talent, little one.

30
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:14,075
But how will I know which one is...

31
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:17,054
You'll know.

32
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:11,267
Hmm.

33
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:55,710
Whoa!

34
00:06:55,822 --> 00:07:00,020
Never seen one glow that much before,
even for Vidia.

35
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:01,920
You know,
I do believe you're right.

36
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:05,862
Little daisy top
might be a very rare talent indeed.

37
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:16,807
Come forward, tinker fairies,

38
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,903
and welcome the newest member
of your talent guild, Tinker Bell.

39
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,778
Glad we had a bath today, eh, Clank?

40
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,284
Excuse us!
- Coming through!

41
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,854
Sorry! Make way for tinkers!

42
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:34,823
Hady-hi, hady-ho, Miss Bell. I'm Clank.

43
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:38,225
Splinters, Clank. Say it, don't spray it.

44
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:41,823
Phineas T. Kettletree, Esquire,
at your service.

45
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,094
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

46
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:46,365
Oh, foo! He's Bobble, I'm Clank.

47
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,040
Clank, Bobble.

48
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:53,406
We're pleased as a pile of
perfectly polished pots you're here.

49
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:54,571
Uh...

50
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:55,781
Me, too.

51
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,043
Come on, Miss Bell.
There's so much to show you.

52
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:07,322
You've arrived
at a most wondrous and glorious time.

53
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:08,688
Really? Why?

54
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:12,094
Why, it's almost time
for the changing of the seasons.

55
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:16,498
You see, here in Pixie Hollow, there are
different realms for every time of year.

56
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:17,660
Well, there's one up ahead.

57
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:25,973
Winter Woods. It's always cold here.

58
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:29,673
Look there! Snowflake and frost fairies
returning home for...

59
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:32,444
For some well-deserved rest.

60
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:36,079
Aye. They've just finished
bringing winter to the world.

61
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,152
It's the off-season
for the autumn fairies, too.

62
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:43,558
Always practicing
that perfect shade of amber, eh?

63
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:45,460
And the fairies of Summer Glade

64
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:47,556
still have plenty of time to get ready.

65
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,862
But not as much
as the autumn fairies,

66
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:51,402
of course, because, well...

67
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:54,996
Yes, Clanky. Because
right now, fairies of every talent

68
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:58,406
are preparing for my favorite season,
springtime!

69
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:00,935
Oh!

70
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:07,008
Get along.
Get along, little sproutlings, and dig.

71
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:13,423
Hello, there!

72
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:18,126
Come on, Miss Bell.
You've got to see where we live.

73
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:26,664
Welcome to Tinker's Nook.

74
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:28,899
Oh, wow!

75
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,418
Oh.

76
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:43,615
Come on.
There's so much to show you.

77
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:07,838
Cute.

78
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,180
Just taking some supplies down...

79
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:14,014
They're taking supplies
down to the workshop.

80
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:18,187
Let her go.

81
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:19,813
Watch out for falling...

82
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:22,360
Watch out for falling maple seeds!

83
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:26,889
Wow!

84
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:40,771
And over here is where most of us live.
There's your house...

85
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,178
There's your house, Tinker Bell.

86
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,350
- It's mine?
- Sure is.

87
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,184
We were hoping the new arrival
would be one of us,

88
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,692
so we got the place all ready.

89
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:57,194
We rounded up some work clothes...

90
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,696
- We didn't know your size.
- Yes, our apologies, but...

91
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,427
- But they might be too big.
- Yeah, well, that's only...

92
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,696
'Cause you're so tiny.

93
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:06,271
That'll do, Clank.

94
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:08,738
Please come on down to the workshop
when you're ready.

95
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:10,604
Fairy Mary will want to meet you.

96
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,938
Goodbye.

97
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:20,919
Oh.

98
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:07,659
Stop! What?

99
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:12,135
A five-gauge twig for an axle?
Clank, I told you it took a seven.

100
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:13,432
Oh, you said five.

101
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:17,669
I said seven! Oh, Clank, I tell you,
sometimes you can be pretty,

102
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:19,039
pretty...

103
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:24,343
So pretty.

104
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:29,619
- Who's that, then?
- It's Tinker Bell, you snail brain.

105
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:35,122
Wow, everyone seems so busy.

106
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:37,718
Well, spring won't spring itself.

107
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,267
Indeed, my bellowing buddy.
And we tinkers are a big part of it.

108
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:44,768
Allow us to elucidate, Miss Bell.

109
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:48,573
- We fiddle and fix.
- We craft and create.

110
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:51,643
- We carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

111
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:54,542
- Weave saddles and satchels.
- For birdies, you see.

112
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:57,639
- Make baskets and bushels.
- To carry the seeds!

113
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,446
- When preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more!

114
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:04,717
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

115
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:07,384
That was great.

116
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:12,294
So you see, Miss Bell, we help fairies
of every talent with our creations.

117
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:16,129
Unfortunately, all those fairies
are out of luck this year.

118
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:18,863
Unless we can actually
deliver these things to them.

119
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:21,405
The wagon repairs are finished, I trust?

120
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,637
Yes, Fairy Mary.

121
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:29,881
- Tip-top shape.
- No wheels missing whatsoever!

122
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:32,784
Then let's see it.

123
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:35,319
- Ah, you see... Well...
- See,

124
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:38,652
- with your eyes?
- Define "see," actually...

125
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:41,622
- You have to meet Tinker Bell!
- What? Who?

126
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:44,625
- She's new, Fairy Mary.
- Nice to meet you.

127
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,597
Rapture! A new charge on whom
we can lavish

128
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,430
all our tinkering wisdom and expertise!

129
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,471
Let me see those hands.

130
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:58,276
Teetering teapots, so dainty.

131
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:02,672
Don't worry, dear. We'll build up those
tinker muscles in no time.

132
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:03,906
Okay.

133
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,644
- Now, boys, the deliveries?
- Aye, we're on it.

134
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:10,620
As a matter of fact,
we're heading out right this second.

135
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:14,591
- But we've only got one wheel.
- What was that?

136
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:19,061
Nothing really,
Clank was just asking...

137
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,531
If I can go as well!

138
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,629
- Yeah! Good one. Very nice.
- Yes! I wondered that,

139
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:29,197
- if you could go with us. Yes.
- That's exactly what he was saying.

140
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:31,572
Very well. Get on with it, then.

141
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,409
Slow down, Cheese, I can't keep up!

142
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:39,607
The mouse's name is Cheese?

143
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:42,551
Must be.
He always comes when we yell it.

144
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:13,875
Sprinting thistles!
Bobble! Bobble!

145
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:55,121
Easy. Easy, boy. It's all right.
Fawn's got you.

146
00:15:56,428 --> 00:16:00,831
Easy. Easy, girl. It's all right.
Silvermist's got you.

147
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:03,467
Oh, you all right, sugar cane?

148
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:04,862
Be careful, Rosetta, she may faint!

149
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:08,869
Elevate her legs. No, wait.
I mean her head.

150
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:10,805
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.
If she's red, raise the head.

151
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:13,070
If she's pale, raise the tail.

152
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:15,245
Does she look pale or red?

153
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:17,144
She looks squished.

154
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:19,043
Sorry.

155
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:22,413
Here, let me, raindrop.
So, what happened to you, anyway?

156
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:24,853
- Well, I...
- It was sprinting thistles!

157
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:28,219
Those weeds are an absolute menace.

158
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:31,763
Always trampling things,
poking people in the petunia.

159
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:34,756
Gather round, ladies.

160
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,266
We've brought some selections

161
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:39,531
from the new spring line
of tinker specialties!

162
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:41,230
- All right!
- Show us, show us!

163
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,366
- What'd you bring?
- Your rainbow tubes, Iridessa.

164
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:47,138
Finally! Silvermist,
could you help me?

165
00:16:57,723 --> 00:16:58,747
Oh.

166
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,425
What're you gonna do with that?

167
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:11,469
I'm gonna take it to the mainland.

168
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,764
What's the mainland?

169
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:14,896
It's where we're gonna go
change winter to spring.

170
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,635
The seasons change all the time there.

171
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,335
I'll get to apply my artistic sensibilities.

172
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:23,506
Yeah. And I'll have breakfast ready
for all the wittle fuzzies

173
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:25,606
coming out of hibernation.

174
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:29,518
We just follow the second star...

175
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:32,181
Ride the breeze, follow the waves...

176
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,259
All the way across the sea...

177
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,225
And then, there it is.

178
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,093
Wow! The mainland sounds flitterific!

179
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:48,103
Yes. The glamorous lives
of the nature-talent fairies, eh?

180
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:49,674
We'd love to stay and chat, but...

181
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:53,438
But we tinkers
have real work to do. Right?

182
00:17:53,545 --> 00:17:56,776
Don't get your wings in a bunch.
- Don't be like that.

183
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:58,315
Nice to meet you all!

184
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:01,648
You, too! Fly with you later!
- Fly with you later!

185
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,355
Right! Here we are.

186
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:07,618
A pretty large order of pollen pots
for the...

187
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,468
Last thing is berry bushels
to deliver to the glen...

188
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:26,806
Is it okay
if I just catch up with you later?

189
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:28,402
Oh, I suppose.

190
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,240
Can you find your way back?

191
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,484
- Yeah, yeah. Sure I can.
- Well, I...

192
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:37,246
- All right, then.
- Just be careful!

193
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:41,715
Hi, there!

194
00:18:44,563 --> 00:18:45,757
Sorry.

195
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,632
Vidia, right?

196
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:57,406
We didn't officially meet.
I'm Tinker Bell.

197
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,472
Oh, yes.

198
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,040
The new girl.

199
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:05,776
That's right! So, what's your talent?

200
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,653
What do you think it is?

201
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:15,750
You're a pollen-izer? Pollen-ator?
Pollen-picker? Pollen-plucker?

202
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:19,490
I am a fast-flying fairy,
a true rare talent.

203
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:22,433
And this is but a small part of what I do.

204
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:26,197
I make breezes in the summer,
blow down leaves in the fall.

205
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:29,103
My winds even brought you here, dear.

206
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,075
Fairies of every talent depend on me.

207
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:35,377
Hey, that's just like what I do.

208
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:37,771
Excuse me?

209
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,214
I mean, tinkers help fairies
of every talent, too.

210
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,844
So we're kind of the same, you know?

211
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:48,853
Sweetie, I make forces of nature.

212
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:51,056
You make pots and kettles.

213
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:55,429
I work up in the sky,
and you work down in a ditch.

214
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:57,159
Hey!

215
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,397
Don't get me wrong, sunshine.
Being a tinker is really swell and all,

216
00:20:00,506 --> 00:20:03,669
but I wouldn't go around
bragging about your talent.

217
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,073
It's not like spring depends on you.

218
00:20:06,178 --> 00:20:07,702
Of course it does!

219
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:11,408
And when I go to the mainland,
I'll prove just how important we are.

220
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:13,485
When who goes to the mainland?

221
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:16,418
Me, of course! For spring!

222
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:21,486
Oh, of course. You'll prove it, huh?

223
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:22,851
Yes, I will.

224
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:27,660
Well, I, for one,
am looking forward to that. Excuse me.

225
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:30,964
No. Excuse me.

226
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,533
"Mine is a rare talent."

227
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:39,801
Ugh.

228
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,845
Try and tell me tinkers don't matter.

229
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:46,440
I'll show her what a rare talent really is,
when I...

230
00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:58,380
Oh.

231
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:23,437
- Hey, Tink, what you got there?
- Oh, hi.

232
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:26,513
I don't know. I just found them.

233
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,386
Lost things.

234
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:32,050
- Lost things.
- Aye.

235
00:22:32,157 --> 00:22:36,116
Stuff gets lost and washes up
on Neverland from time to time.

236
00:22:36,228 --> 00:22:37,957
You know, from the mainland.

237
00:22:38,063 --> 00:22:40,190
These come from the mainland?

238
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:42,960
That place sounds
more fascinating all the time.

239
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:47,596
Berry bushels, check.
Pollen pots, check. Lost things, check.

240
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,307
Huh?

241
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:53,273
Lost things?
Why are you fiddling with that junk?

242
00:22:53,378 --> 00:22:54,709
Oh, um...

243
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:57,741
Well, they were just so unusual.

244
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:00,317
You mustn't be wasting your time
with that rubbish.

245
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,979
And I won't have it
cluttering up my workshop.

246
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:04,919
And as for you two,

247
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:08,090
no more dilly-dallying around.

248
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:10,593
And don't forget about
the Queen's review tonight.

249
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:13,563
Goodness, there's still
so much to be done!

250
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:18,634
Thank you.

251
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:21,397
Sorry about your trinkets, Miss Bell.

252
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:24,498
Well, we'd best be getting ready
for the review, anyway.

253
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:26,770
What is the Queen's review?

254
00:23:26,878 --> 00:23:30,814
You see, the Queen is going to
review all the preparations for spring!

255
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:34,909
Yeah, it's a good time for us tinkers
to show what we can do, eh?

256
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,783
- Oh, indeed.
- Really?

257
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:39,413
Like me. I can be a wheel.

258
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:41,216
Hmm.

259
00:23:42,294 --> 00:23:45,024
Perfect. That's my chance.

260
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:46,648
Okay, everybody, turn!
Ready for the base coat over here!

261
00:24:57,302 --> 00:25:02,205
Splendid, splendid. Stack those neatly,
plenty of time before the Queen arrives.

262
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:03,501
It's the Queen!

263
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:06,702
What? She's here? Now?
Play, music fairies.

264
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:09,076
Yes, play!

265
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:26,326
Queen Clarion, Your Illustriousness!

266
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:30,663
As Minister of Spring,
I welcome you to Springtime Square.

267
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,269
What? No fireworks, Minister?

268
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:36,397
Oh, well, yeah, that could be arranged.
Light fairies! Light fairies!

269
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:39,705
I'm teasing.
You always make such a fuss,

270
00:25:39,811 --> 00:25:42,678
and everything always
turns out wonderfully.

271
00:25:45,684 --> 00:25:48,380
Well, I think you'll find
that we have things well in hand.

272
00:25:48,486 --> 00:25:50,044
When the Everblossom blooms,

273
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:52,680
we'll be ready to bring
spring to the mainland!

274
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:55,021
Music to my ears.

275
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:58,357
I know you've all put in months
of practice and preparation,

276
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:01,661
but keep up the good work
these last few days,

277
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:03,791
- because just as fairies...
- Queen Clarion!

278
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,637
Huh?

279
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:08,505
Queen Clarion!

280
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:12,239
- Did I miss anything?
- No, no, no.

281
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,900
Phew! Good.

282
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,468
It's all right.

283
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,377
I came up with some fantastic things

284
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:20,042
for tinkers to use
when we go to the mainland.

285
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,787
What's she talking about?

286
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:25,481
Let me show you!

287
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:30,423
First, baby chipmunks
can't eat the whole nut, right?

288
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,860
Their little teeth can't chew big bites.

289
00:26:32,964 --> 00:26:36,422
So you just crank back this lever,
and it's...

290
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:47,171
Whoops.

291
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:51,210
- It's kind of a work in progress.
- Yes, yes, yes. Very clever.

292
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:54,474
Oh!

293
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:57,180
And I made this, too.
It's a flower-sprayer.

294
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:00,486
- Tinker Bell, I...
- Here, allow me to demonstrate.

295
00:27:10,302 --> 00:27:11,462
Sorry.

296
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,838
- But wait till you see this last one.
- Tinker Bell, sweetheart,

297
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:18,104
has no one explained?

298
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:21,368
Explained what?

299
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:24,680
Tinker fairies
don't go to the mainland, dear.

300
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,917
What?

301
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:29,612
All of those things
are done by the nature-talent fairies.

302
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:32,315
Your work is here in Pixie Hollow.

303
00:27:32,857 --> 00:27:36,054
- But I thought that...
- I'm sorry, Tinker Bell.

304
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:42,263
Oh, okay. No. No, that's good.

305
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:45,063
I mean,
I really couldn't make it anyway.

306
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:50,039
So, good. Yeah.
This actually works out good.

307
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:55,275
I mean, well...
So, I'm just gonna... Yeah.

308
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:14,164
Back so soon?

309
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:16,060
You didn't go?

310
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:19,762
Goodness, no.
Far too much work to do down here.

311
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:32,979
Vidia was right. Being a tinker stinks.

312
00:28:33,852 --> 00:28:35,649
Excuse me?

313
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:39,618
It's just, why don't we get to go
to the mainland?

314
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:45,059
The mainland? Who gives
a pile of pebbles about the mainland?

315
00:28:45,764 --> 00:28:48,289
But, Fairy Mary,
the other fairies get to go.

316
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,597
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you a garden fairy?

317
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:53,698
Well, no.

318
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:56,239
- Are you a light fairy?
- No.

319
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:59,105
Animal fairy? Water fairy, perhaps?

320
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,677
No and no.

321
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:04,977
No. You're not. You are a tinker.
It's who you are.

322
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:06,907
Be proud of it.

323
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:11,255
The day you can
magically make the flowers grow,

324
00:29:11,356 --> 00:29:15,156
or capture the rays of the sun
and whatnot, then you can go.

325
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:17,757
Until then, your work is here.

326
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:44,815
Good idea, Fairy Mary.

327
00:29:56,134 --> 00:29:57,101
Get your pixie dust yet?

328
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:58,169
Just did.

329
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,134
- Nice day for flying.
- Sure is.

330
00:30:00,238 --> 00:30:01,227
Here you go, Silvermist.

331
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,068
Thank you, Terence.

332
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:06,676
I hope Tinker Bell is okay.

333
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:09,144
I know. That poor little sapling.

334
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:12,040
She looked pretty wilted yesterday.

335
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,516
Well, I wouldn't blame her
if she stayed in bed all day.

336
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:16,143
Morning, girls!

337
00:30:16,254 --> 00:30:17,221
Tinker Bell?
- Tinker Bell?

338
00:30:17,322 --> 00:30:21,224
Guess what? I've decided I'm not
gonna be a tinker fairy anymore.

339
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,315
- What?
- What?

340
00:30:22,427 --> 00:30:25,590
Well, I was thinking.
Why do I have to be a tinker?

341
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:28,257
Just 'cause
some silly hammer glowed?

342
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:31,028
I mean, who's to say
it wasn't some big mistake?

343
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:33,434
Maybe I can just switch my talent.

344
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:36,939
Switch your talent?
I don't know, Tinker Bell...

345
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:39,703
If you could teach me your talents,
any of them,

346
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:42,678
maybe I could show the Queen
I can work with nature, too.

347
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:46,683
And then she'd let me go
to the mainland for spring.

348
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,981
Oh, Tinker Bell.
That's just not how it works.

349
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:52,886
- Well, maybe she could.
- She's right. She could.

350
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:55,721
Well, I've never heard of someone
switching talents before.

351
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:57,761
She's right. Me, neither.

352
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:04,425
Look. You all do things that are
beautiful and magical and important.

353
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:08,172
But me, well,

354
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:12,004
there's gotta be more to my life
than just pots and kettles.

355
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:15,744
All I'm asking
is that you give me a chance.

356
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:18,982
I'll help you, Tinker Bell.

357
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,744
Thank you, Sil.

358
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:22,717
Me, too. Could be fun.

359
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:26,890
Well, first time for everything, I guess.
What harm can come from trying?

360
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:29,653
Well, I still think this is a bad idea.

361
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:34,857
So, for your first day
of water fairy training,

362
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:37,161
I could show you
how to make ripples in the pond.

363
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:38,326
Okay!

364
00:31:38,436 --> 00:31:41,234
Or teach you how to talk
to the babbling brook.

365
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:43,068
Oh, that sounds fun, too.

366
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:46,405
Or wait, wait, wait.
I got it, I got it, I got it!

367
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:49,707
Dewdrops on spider webs!

368
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:52,545
Come on. I'll show you how to do it.

369
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,016
- Good luck, Tink!
- You can do it!

370
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:57,679
Oh, um...

371
00:31:57,789 --> 00:31:59,279
Go get 'em.

372
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,629
Just cup your hands like this,
reach into the water, and...

373
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,528
Okay, you've heard of a dewdrop?

374
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:14,571
This is a don't drop.
That's water fairy humor.

375
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,005
It's good.

376
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:18,576
Come on.

377
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:21,509
Okay, Tink, now,
this next part can be a little tricky.

378
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:24,377
It takes a very steady,
delicate hand to...

379
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:29,116
Where's your dewdrop?

380
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:30,354
Oh.

381
00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:33,585
Forgot my dewdrop.

382
00:32:37,528 --> 00:32:38,825
Hey! I did

383
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:40,753
it.

384
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:44,266
Shake that one off. Shake it off.
You can do this!

385
00:32:47,472 --> 00:32:50,805
That's it. That's it, Tink.
You're doing it! You're...

386
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:54,206
Now, Tink, try to...

387
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:57,743
No, no, sweetie, you need to...
Well, maybe if you...

388
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,680
Well, you have to admire
her persistence.

389
00:33:01,953 --> 00:33:02,977
Tinker Bell!

390
00:33:03,087 --> 00:33:05,385
Although, sometimes hammers glow

391
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:07,490
for a reason.

392
00:33:13,298 --> 00:33:14,390
Whoa.

393
00:33:26,978 --> 00:33:31,415
You know, you always struck me
as a light fairy kind of gal.

394
00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:45,988
<i>Here we go in the treasure...</i>

395
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:50,968
- Have you seen Tink?
- No, thank you. Not thirsty!

396
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:56,206
No, no. Not "drink," Tink!

397
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,203
Pink? I like purple meself!

398
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,040
Tink! Have you seen Tink?

399
00:34:02,146 --> 00:34:03,272
What?

400
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:06,908
I do not stink! Maybe it's you, eh?

401
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,988
Hey, have you seen Tink?

402
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:16,816
- Fairy Mary's gonna be cross.
- Aye, Clank.

403
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:19,158
We'd better take some of this
off Miss Bell's plate, so...

404
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:21,722
- All right, then.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, Clank!

405
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:30,498
What are...
Will you two stop mucking about?

406
00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:33,873
- What Clank did was, he took it off...
- Bobble told me that I should...

407
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:37,937
I see Tinker Bell has
got her work done, mysteriously.

408
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:39,948
Where is she, anyway?

409
00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:43,712
Well, you see, she's...

410
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:46,113
She went with Cheese to...

411
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,617
No, no. Clank means
she went to get cheese, you see,

412
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:53,720
- the food, for Cheese the mouse...
- Yes, the food, for Cheese the mouse.

413
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:56,459
...because he was whining.

414
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:57,556
Yeah. Like a baby.

415
00:34:57,668 --> 00:35:00,364
Like a wittle, wee baby, there.

416
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,319
Okay, what can I teach you that's
gonna do the least amount of damage?

417
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:22,382
Oh, I know. Follow me, Tinker Bell.

418
00:35:27,865 --> 00:35:32,063
The last light of day,
it's the richest kind of all!

419
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,038
Wait for it. Wait for it.

420
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,005
Okay, and now!

421
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:39,974
Oh, wow.

422
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:43,438
Huh?

423
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:46,814
It's incredible.

424
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:48,749
Now for the fun part.

425
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:53,420
- Do you think it's heavy?
- No. It's light.

426
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:06,501
Okay, okay.

427
00:36:38,836 --> 00:36:39,894
Stay.

428
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:43,030
- Here, Tink. Let me...
- No! I almost got it.

429
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,835
If I just get you started...

430
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:46,876
This is impossible!

431
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:51,543
Look out!

432
00:36:57,755 --> 00:36:59,017
Oh, no.

433
00:36:59,724 --> 00:37:01,453
Whoa!

434
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:06,697
I wonder how it's going.

435
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:09,430
Fly, Tink, fly!

436
00:37:10,101 --> 00:37:11,261
Uh-oh.

437
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:13,761
We'll save you, Tink!

438
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:15,839
Bob and weave!
Bob and weave!

439
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,170
Cover your tushy!

440
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:33,487
- We fiddle and fix.
- Craft and create.

441
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:35,718
- Carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

442
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:38,386
- Preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more.

443
00:37:38,496 --> 00:37:42,262
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

444
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:46,932
Tinker Bell,
I'd like a word with you.

445
00:37:47,038 --> 00:37:48,403
Fairy Mary!

446
00:37:49,073 --> 00:37:53,772
See, I was on my deliveries,
and it's actually kind of...

447
00:37:53,878 --> 00:37:57,143
Save it.
I know what you've been up to, missy.

448
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,851
And I had such high hopes for you.

449
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:15,188
- You'd do well to listen to her...
- Why?

450
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:17,233
So I can do this my whole life?

451
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:20,361
I don't wanna be just a stupid tinker!

452
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:25,708
No, no, not that you guys are...

453
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:30,875
I didn't mean that... Guys, I wasn't...

454
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,617
I have to go.

455
00:38:49,066 --> 00:38:53,935
Now, flap them. Flap them.
That's it! Have fun!

456
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:00,674
Hey, Tink! You ready?

457
00:39:01,112 --> 00:39:02,773
A little nervous, actually.

458
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,542
Oh, don't be silly.
Come on, you'll be fine.

459
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,380
We're teaching baby birds
how to fly.

460
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,748
First, you have to get their attention.

461
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:14,723
Smile and establish trust.

462
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:21,162
See? Okay, open your wings, honey,
and flap them up and down.

463
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:25,526
Up and down. That's the way.
Faster, faster.

464
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:29,538
That's right. Yes! You're doing it! Okay.
Come out this way a little bit.

465
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:35,501
You're okay. You're okay. You got it.
Keep flapping, keep flapping!

466
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,581
Hey, why don't you help
that last little guy?

467
00:39:43,554 --> 00:39:48,082
Okay, okay.
Just smile and establish trust.

468
00:39:48,526 --> 00:39:49,857
Hi, there!

469
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:54,687
Hey, little fella,
you wanna do some flap-flap today?

470
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:58,258
Oh, sure you do!

471
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:02,237
All you do is,
you just flap your wings, like this.

472
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:08,174
No, no, no. None of that.
Come on. All we got to do is...

473
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:09,268
Ow!

474
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:13,981
Look. I'm going to level with you, okay?

475
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:17,714
I kind of bombed out on
the whole water and light fairy things,

476
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:20,188
and I'm starting to
run out of options here.

477
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,816
If you could see fit
to flap your little wings

478
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:25,293
and take flight
for a few measly seconds,

479
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:28,797
I might be able to go to the mainland
and bring happiness to the world!

480
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:30,833
What do you say?

481
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:33,169
Wrong answer.

482
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:37,372
If I end up making acorn kettles
for the rest of my life,

483
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:39,466
I am holding you
personally responsible.

484
00:40:41,212 --> 00:40:43,112
Hey, hey. Look at this!

485
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:48,308
Okay, just stop squirming.
Would you just... Hey!

486
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:52,614
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm letting go. I am letting go.

487
00:40:57,394 --> 00:40:59,157
This is not working.

488
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:05,324
Hey, maybe that guy can help.
He's a really good flyer.

489
00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:08,304
Hey, up there!

490
00:41:11,842 --> 00:41:12,934
Hawk!

491
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:25,186
- What's happening?
- Quick, hide!

492
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:26,551
Look out!

493
00:41:32,296 --> 00:41:34,696
A hawk! Tinker Bell's in trouble!

494
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:50,175
- Hey!
- Vidia?

495
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:52,181
This is my hiding spot!

496
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:56,185
But it's all yours, now.

497
00:41:58,923 --> 00:41:59,947
No!

498
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:14,031
- Get him!
- Get him!

499
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:22,036
What?
- You all right?

500
00:42:23,681 --> 00:42:24,841
So scary.

501
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:34,186
Are you okay, Vidia?

502
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:39,722
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me! I'm fine!

503
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,095
- But I was only trying to help.
- Well, stop trying.

504
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:49,428
Tinker Bell...

505
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:53,535
I can't hold water. I can't hold light.

506
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:57,375
Birds hate me. I'm just so useless!

507
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:58,675
Tink.

508
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:14,530
Great.
I failed for the third time in a row.

509
00:43:15,532 --> 00:43:20,299
At this rate, I should get to
the mainland right about... Oh... Never!

510
00:43:22,506 --> 00:43:23,473
Huh?

511
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:18,319
Yes!

512
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:28,429
Sil!

513
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:14,881
Beautiful.

514
00:45:43,614 --> 00:45:45,081
You fixed it!
- Wow!

515
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:47,080
Beautiful!
- Amazing!

516
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:48,173
What are you guys doing here?

517
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:51,152
It might be
the sparkliest thing I've ever seen,

518
00:45:51,255 --> 00:45:52,779
and I've seen a lot of sparkly things!

519
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:57,224
It's a really pretty thingy. What is it?

520
00:45:57,561 --> 00:45:59,256
I don't know. I just found it.

521
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:03,766
Tinker Bell, don't you even realize
what you're doing? You're tinkering!

522
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:07,504
What? No, no, this isn't... I was just...

523
00:46:07,805 --> 00:46:11,969
Creating those gadgets,
figuring things out, fixing stuff like this,

524
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:14,039
that's what tinkering is, sweetie!

525
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:17,602
Don't you like doing this?
Isn't it what you really love?

526
00:46:17,714 --> 00:46:20,239
Yeah! Who cares about
going to the mainland, anyway?

527
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,682
Well, I do, remember?

528
00:46:23,353 --> 00:46:25,583
I want to see
where these things come from.

529
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:28,021
Why are you saying this?
Are you just giving up on me?

530
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:31,617
I mean, aren't you going to teach me
to be a garden fairy anymore?

531
00:46:31,728 --> 00:46:34,424
Sweet pea, I think this is your talent.

532
00:46:35,032 --> 00:46:37,262
Tink, we just want you to be happy.

533
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:40,302
If you really want me to be happy,
you'll help me get to the mainland

534
00:46:40,404 --> 00:46:42,065
like you promised.

535
00:46:43,373 --> 00:46:46,570
Please, Tinker Bell, just think about it.

536
00:47:24,982 --> 00:47:28,076
Will you teach me how to be
a fast-flying fairy?

537
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:32,682
Please? I know I could do it!

538
00:47:32,823 --> 00:47:36,554
With your help, I could be flying
as fast as you in no time.

539
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:40,957
Vidia, you're my last hope.
All my friends have given up on me.

540
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:46,197
Rosetta won't even try to teach me
to be a garden fairy now.

541
00:47:46,637 --> 00:47:51,404
I bet I could at least paint some flowers
or plant some sproutlings.

542
00:47:51,942 --> 00:47:54,775
I mean,
there must be something I could do.

543
00:47:57,548 --> 00:48:01,040
Or if you really want to be
a garden fairy...

544
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:14,193
Capture the sprinting thistles.

545
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:19,429
Well, okay. I can do this. Yeah!

546
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:23,368
Okay. Ready, Cheese?

547
00:48:26,143 --> 00:48:28,270
Come on. They're just weeds.

548
00:48:30,714 --> 00:48:34,411
Besides, there were only
seven or eight at the most, right?

549
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:40,315
Hyah!

550
00:48:45,095 --> 00:48:49,532
We can do this. I know we can do this.
What do you say?

551
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:54,698
Attaboy.

552
00:49:05,182 --> 00:49:07,047
This ought to be good.

553
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:20,521
Hey!

554
00:49:20,631 --> 00:49:23,191
Come on, you!
Oh, come on!

555
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:28,396
Just a bit this way!
It's working! It's working!

556
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,708
Come on!

557
00:49:45,222 --> 00:49:48,157
Wait, wait, wait.
Come back! Come back!

558
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:56,330
These things just won't listen!
Come on, Cheese. Go, go, go!

559
00:50:02,172 --> 00:50:04,572
Okay, definitely more than eight.

560
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:09,606
Please file into the corral
in an orderly manner!

561
00:50:12,582 --> 00:50:13,674
Wait!

562
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,285
Oh, no! Come on!

563
00:50:24,428 --> 00:50:25,895
Come on, now.

564
00:50:35,505 --> 00:50:38,303
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. So sorry.

565
00:50:38,475 --> 00:50:40,375
This is the last batch.

566
00:50:44,548 --> 00:50:45,810
Look out!

567
00:50:46,216 --> 00:50:47,843
Sorry. Sorry!

568
00:51:41,638 --> 00:51:42,832
Oh, no.

569
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:44,633
Tink. What happened?

570
00:51:44,741 --> 00:51:46,140
- I...
- Tinker Bell,

571
00:51:46,243 --> 00:51:47,642
what did you think you were doing?

572
00:51:47,744 --> 00:51:50,269
I was just... I was just trying to...

573
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,405
I thought if I could capture
the thistles, then...

574
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:56,179
There isn't a garden fairy alive
who can control those weeds!

575
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:58,982
- What were you trying to prove?
- I...

576
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:02,024
She's right, Tink.
This has all gone too far.

577
00:52:05,962 --> 00:52:07,953
By the second star!

578
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:13,931
All the preparations for spring...
How did this...

579
00:52:22,345 --> 00:52:27,339
Queen Clarion, it was me.

580
00:52:28,151 --> 00:52:30,517
I did it. It was all my fault.

581
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:32,920
Tinker Bell.

582
00:52:34,124 --> 00:52:35,591
I...

583
00:52:36,593 --> 00:52:37,924
I'm sorry.

584
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,944
I don't think we can
fix this in time.

585
00:52:56,046 --> 00:52:59,106
We're going to have to cancel spring,
or postpone it at the very least.

586
00:52:59,216 --> 00:53:01,480
What, and put my
snowflake fairies back to work? Oh, no.

587
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:03,177
But we can't! We can't do that!

588
00:53:03,286 --> 00:53:04,446
If the snow isn't melted,

589
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:06,647
the seedlings won't grow,
the fruit won't ripen in the summer...

590
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:09,156
And in the autumn,
there will be nothing to harvest.

591
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:10,624
Spring must happen on time,

592
00:53:10,727 --> 00:53:12,456
or the balance of nature
will be undone!

593
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:15,656
There must be something we can do!
Certainly this has happened before!

594
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:17,995
It has!
Did you ever hear of the Ice Age?

595
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:20,069
Settle down, all of you.

596
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:25,308
Fairy Mary, is it even possible to redo
everything in such a short time?

597
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:33,814
- No.
- Oh, no.

598
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:36,442
We were so close,
and now it's all gone.

599
00:53:36,553 --> 00:53:38,248
Who's going to paint
our leaves now?

600
00:53:38,355 --> 00:53:40,016
The apples and pumpkins
will never grow.

601
00:53:40,123 --> 00:53:42,114
No rolling hills
covered in daffodils?

602
00:53:42,225 --> 00:53:44,284
And it took months to harvest
all those seeds!

603
00:53:44,394 --> 00:53:45,827
Animals waking
from hibernation

604
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:47,897
will have nothing to eat!

605
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:17,149
You okay, Tink?

606
00:54:18,295 --> 00:54:20,388
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

607
00:54:21,364 --> 00:54:26,324
I just came hoping to get a quick refill.
I'm going away for a while.

608
00:54:27,137 --> 00:54:28,104
Oh.

609
00:54:28,572 --> 00:54:32,668
- Well, how long you going to be gone?
- Well, actually, forever.

610
00:54:34,511 --> 00:54:36,240
Forever? Well,

611
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:40,543
in that case,
a double scoop.

612
00:54:41,117 --> 00:54:43,779
Forever's a pretty long time, so I hear.

613
00:54:43,887 --> 00:54:45,377
Thanks, Terence.

614
00:54:45,488 --> 00:54:47,115
You know my name?

615
00:54:47,223 --> 00:54:49,589
Well, sure. Why wouldn't I?

616
00:54:49,926 --> 00:54:52,656
I don't know.
I'm just a dust-keeper guy.

617
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,724
I'm not exactly seen as the most
important fairy in Pixie Hollow.

618
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,733
Terence, what are you talking about?

619
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:01,269
You're probably the most important one
there is!

620
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:03,669
Without you,
no one would have any magic!

621
00:55:03,773 --> 00:55:06,469
Why, your talent makes you
who you are!

622
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:09,911
- You should be proud of it! I mean...
- I am.

623
00:55:18,688 --> 00:55:21,555
I'd better get going.

624
00:55:58,828 --> 00:56:00,227
Hey, Cheese.

625
00:56:02,565 --> 00:56:05,295
"Be proud of your talent." What talent?

626
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:08,862
I couldn't even get
these silly things to work.

627
00:56:22,085 --> 00:56:23,484
Lost things.

628
00:56:38,935 --> 00:56:40,266
That's it!

629
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:51,542
Attention, everyone!

630
00:56:53,249 --> 00:56:55,740
I'm afraid I have distressing news.

631
00:56:57,353 --> 00:57:00,151
There is no way spring
can come on time.

632
00:57:01,024 --> 00:57:03,322
Months of work was lost,

633
00:57:03,426 --> 00:57:05,986
and it will take us months
to restore it all.

634
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,358
So when the Everblossom
opens tomorrow,

635
00:57:09,733 --> 00:57:13,430
I'm afraid we will not be going
to the mainland for spring.

636
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:18,507
Wait! I know how we can fix everything!

637
00:57:19,976 --> 00:57:21,375
Tinker Bell?

638
00:57:24,047 --> 00:57:25,981
Tinker Bell, I don't think this is...

639
00:57:26,082 --> 00:57:29,017
Just hear me out. Please.

640
00:57:30,153 --> 00:57:31,211
You!

641
00:57:34,524 --> 00:57:37,220
How long does it take you
to paint a ladybug?

642
00:57:37,327 --> 00:57:40,228
I don't know. 10, 15 minutes, I guess.

643
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:01,747
See? We can build more.
I can show you how.

644
00:58:01,851 --> 00:58:05,548
Making paint, gathering seeds,
we can do it all in no time.

645
00:58:06,122 --> 00:58:08,090
We have to at least try!

646
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:11,985
Wait a...
Are we really gonna listen to her?

647
00:58:12,262 --> 00:58:14,822
She's the reason we're in this mess
in the first place!

648
00:58:14,931 --> 00:58:16,762
But I can fix it.

649
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:21,462
Yippee! Tinker Bell's going to save us
with her dopey little doohickeys.

650
00:58:21,971 --> 00:58:25,168
- Hide the squirrels!
- What is your problem, Vidia?

651
00:58:25,308 --> 00:58:27,037
Why do you think
you're so much better than me?

652
00:58:27,143 --> 00:58:30,601
I am better than you, sweetie.
I didn't ruin spring.

653
00:58:30,713 --> 00:58:32,806
At least now I'm trying to help.

654
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:35,350
Have you ever helped anyone
besides yourself?

655
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:37,248
Well, I tried to help you!

656
00:58:37,353 --> 00:58:39,253
Maybe I should have told you
to capture the hawk

657
00:58:39,355 --> 00:58:41,289
instead of the thistles!

658
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:52,119
Perhaps Tinker Bell was not
the only one responsible.

659
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:57,860
It seems to me that
your fast-flying talent is well-suited

660
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,368
to chasing down each and every one
of the thistles.

661
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,728
Me?

662
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,533
Yes. And I expect them all
to be returned to Needlepoint Meadow

663
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:07,631
as soon as possible.

664
00:59:07,743 --> 00:59:10,143
But that could take forever!

665
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,544
Then I suggest you get started.

666
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:26,695
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you sure you can do this?

667
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:30,757
Yes.

668
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:35,730
Because I'm a tinker. It's who I am.

669
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,640
And tinkers fix things.

670
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,212
But I can't do it alone.

671
00:59:46,682 --> 00:59:48,547
Command us, Miss Bell.

672
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:51,276
- I'll help.
- Show us how, Tink!

673
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,355
- I'll help you.
- Me, too!

674
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:59,323
Okay, gather up all the twigs you can,
all different sizes, and tree sap.

675
00:59:59,428 --> 01:00:02,795
We need lots of that.
But most importantly,

676
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:06,426
we need to find lost things.

677
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:16,906
Okay, what have you got?

678
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,004
- How about this?
- Will this do?

679
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,208
Can you use this fuzzy thing,
Miss Bell?

680
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:22,682
- Oh, yeah!
- It's not fuzzy.

681
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,219
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

682
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,752
Twig.

683
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,451
Hammer.

684
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,428
Magnification, please. Thank you.

685
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:38,600
And that's how you do it!

686
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,067
Now, what do you suppose the...

687
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,909
You smell funny.

688
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:58,576
Oh!

689
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,023
- I saw it first.
- I bumped into it.

690
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:05,850
Just tie this off here.

691
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:10,994
So, you just squeeze this,
then let it go, and...

692
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:14,064
See? Simple!

693
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,301
Now, just put the berries in,

694
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:20,466
and we'll have plenty of paint
in no time!

695
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:00,080
Six, seven and eight.

696
01:02:56,505 --> 01:02:59,997
You did it, Tinker Bell.
You saved spring.

697
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,775
We all did it.

698
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:06,041
Queen Clarion? Can't Tink
come with us to the mainland?

699
01:03:06,148 --> 01:03:09,174
Yeah, she's done so much
for everyone.

700
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,853
No, no, you guys, really.
I don't need to go.

701
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:15,613
Buttercup, it's what you wanted.

702
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:18,285
It's okay. My work is here.

703
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,362
And I still have so much to do. I gotta...

704
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,226
Not here, you don't!

705
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,161
Well... But I don't...

706
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:27,499
Surprise, Miss Bell.

707
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,572
We found your tiny dancer!

708
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,440
Actually, I ran across this myself
many seasons ago.

709
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:39,310
I didn't have a clue what it was
or how to fix it.

710
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:45,214
But you did, Tinker Bell.
You are quite a rare talent indeed.

711
01:03:46,288 --> 01:03:50,418
And I'd imagine there's a little girl
out there who's missing this.

712
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,128
What do you mean? How...

713
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,891
I think that perhaps
a certain tinker fairy

714
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,523
might have a job to do after all,

715
01:03:58,634 --> 01:03:59,931
on the mainland.

716
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:01,559
You mean, I...

717
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:06,604
I knew you'd get to go!
- Oh, Tink!

718
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,768
- We can help, Miss Bell.
- We can help. I'm strong.

719
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:12,109
I'm so happy for you.
Come on. We gotta go line up.

720
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,150
Thank you, Your Highness.

721
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,719
But how will I find who it belongs to?

722
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,720
You'll know. Now go!

723
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:29,330
Good heavens.

724
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,429
Thank you.

725
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:40,169
Tink. Hey,
something to help you on the mainland.

726
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,402
Terence, that's so sweet.

727
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,608
Good luck, Tink.

728
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:52,977
To the air, fairies! To the air!
The mainland awaits!

729
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:59,560
<i>Come away</i>
<i>with me now to the sky</i>

730
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:03,564
<i>Up o'er the hills and the sea</i>

731
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:08,069
<i>Far beyond where our memories lie</i>

732
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,470
<i>To a place where I'm free to be me</i>

733
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:18,678
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

734
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:23,480
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

735
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:28,353
<i>Let the stars fill your soul</i>
<i>when the moon cradles all</i>

736
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:33,360
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

737
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:39,530
<i>The blanket of snow is all gone</i>

738
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:43,503
<i>Each flower waits for the sun</i>

739
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:48,066
<i>And the whispering tears of the rain</i>

740
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:52,614
<i>Holds promise for everyone</i>

741
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:56,549
<i>Then come away with me friends</i>

742
01:05:56,652 --> 01:06:01,146
<i>No matter where you call your home</i>

743
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:05,023
<i>With a light in our hearts</i>
<i>We will never part</i>

744
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,992
Fairies to the north!

745
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,430
Fairies to the south!

746
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,395
To the east and west!

747
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:26,374
<i>Deep in the forest we go</i>

748
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,813
<i>The creatures are all fast asleep</i>

749
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:32,479
Wake up, sleepyheads!
Come on! There you go. Good squirrel.

750
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,351
<i>With a kiss and a wink</i>
<i>we will waken our souls</i>

751
01:06:34,456 --> 01:06:38,051
<i>While always their safety we'll keep</i>

752
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,960
<i>And then, then we'll dance</i>
<i>through the night</i>

753
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:46,295
<i>Till the sunbeams sparkle at dawn</i>

754
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:50,805
<i>And away we will go</i>
<i>Like last winter's snow</i>

755
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:54,467
<i>Soon our work will be done</i>

756
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:58,377
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

757
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,439
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

758
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:07,045
<i>Let the stars fill your soul</i>
<i>when the moon cradles all</i>

759
01:07:09,224 --> 01:07:13,422
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

760
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:30,834
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

761
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:34,973
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

762
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:39,714
<i>Let the stars fill your soul</i>
<i>when the moon cradles all</i>

763
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:44,225
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

764
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:57,795
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

765
01:09:54,289 --> 01:09:56,519
Mummy! Guess what, guess what!

766
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,024
Yes, Wendy.
What is it, darling?

767
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:07,498
<i>A fairy's work is</i>
<i>much more than,</i>

768
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:08,661
<i>at first, it might appear.</i>

769
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,136
You did it!

770
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:14,668
<i>Suppose your broken clock ticks,</i>
<i>though it hasn't in a year.</i>

771
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:20,338
<i>Perchance you find a toy you lost,</i>
<i>or jingling bells you hear.</i>

772
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:28,487
<i>It all means that</i>
<i>one very special fairy might be near.</i>

773
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:49,505
<i>Watch all the flowers</i>
<i>dance with the wind</i>

774
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:53,980
<i>Listen to snowflakes</i>
<i>whisper your name</i>

775
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:57,609
<i>Feel all the wonder lifting your dreams</i>

776
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:02,588
<i>You can fly</i>

777
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:06,855
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

778
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:11,023
<i>Climb upon your star</i>

779
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:15,467
<i>You believe you'll find your wings</i>

780
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:22,500
<i>Fly to your heart</i>

781
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:28,306
<i>Touch every rainbow painting the sky</i>

782
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:32,547
<i>Look at the magic glide</i>
<i>through your life</i>

783
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:36,317
<i>A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night</i>

784
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:41,260
<i>You can fly</i>

785
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:45,663
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

786
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:49,794
<i>Climb upon your star</i>

787
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:54,274
<i>When you believe</i>
<i>you'll find your wings</i>

788
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:57,937
<i>Fly</i>

789
01:11:58,046 --> 01:12:02,142
<i>You can fly</i>

790
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:06,449
<i>To your heart</i>

791
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:15,524
<i>Rise to the heights of all you can be</i>

792
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:24,268
<i>Soar on the hope of marvelous things</i>

793
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:28,742
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

794
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:32,905

797
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,786
<i>Everywhere you go</i>

798
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:50,228
<i>Your soul will find a home</i>

799
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:56,007
<i>You'll be free
to spread your wings</i>

800
01:12:56,705 --> 01:13:00,266
<i>Fly</i>

801
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:07,338
<i>You can fly</i>

01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:11,783
<i>To your heart</i>
