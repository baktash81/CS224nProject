1
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,191
All right, that's it.

2
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,959
One, two, three.

3
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,552
Are you sure you're 18?

4
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,068
Why, do I look older?

5
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,674
Alberta Scrubb?

6
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,753
That's a typographical error.
It's supposed to be Albert A. Scrubb.

7
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,035
Edmund...

8
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,077
you're supposed to be helping me
with the groceries.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,433
Better luck next time, eh, squirt?

10
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,354
Squirt!

11
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,670
He barely had two years on me.

12
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,231
I'm a king! I've fought wars
and I've led armies.

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,674
Not in this world.

14
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,718
Yeah, instead I'm stuck here,
doing battle...

15
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,110
with Eustace Clarence Scrubb.

16
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,794
If anyone so deserved a name.

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,989
What are you doing?

18
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,876
Nothing.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,274
Come on then.

20
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,032
Dear diary, it is now day 253...

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,636
since my wretched cousins
Edmund and Lucy invaded our house.

22
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,189
Not sure how much longer
I can cope living with them...

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,430
having to share my things.

24
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,070
If only one could treat relatives
like one treats insects...

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,992
all my problems would be solved.

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,550
I could simply put them in a jar
or pin them to my wall.

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,593
I'm home. Hello!

28
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,435
Note to self,
investigate legal ramifications...

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,670
of impaling relatives.

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,478
That concludes
the war news from the Western Front.

31
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,915
Hello, Uncle Harold.
I tried to find some carrots...

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,911
but all they had were turnips again.

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,672
Shall I start making soup?

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,751
Aunt Alberta's on her way home.

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,716
Uncle Harold?

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,476
Father. Edmund's making faces at you.

37
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,789
Why, you little...

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,109
Father, he's gonna hit me!

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,309
Edmund, look!

40
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,551
It's from Susan.

41
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,994
I do wish you were here with us.

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,996
It's been such an adventure,
but nothing like our times in Narnia.

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,751
America is very exciting...

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,396
except we never see Father.
He works so very hard.

45
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,436
I was invited...

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,717
"...to the British Consul's tea party
this week by a naval officer...

47
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,632
who happens to be very handsome.

48
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,951
I think he fancies me.

49
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,632
It seems the Germans have made
the crossing difficult right now.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,915
Times are hard.

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,197
Mother hopes you both won't mind
another few months in Cambridge."

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,673
Another few months?

53
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,558
How will we survive?

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,835
You're lucky...

55
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,510
at least you've got your own room.
I'm stuck with mullet mouth.

56
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,274
Susan and Peter are the lucky ones.

57
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,714
Off on adventures.

58
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,678
Yeah, they're the eldest
and we're the youngest.

59
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,796
We don't matter as much.

60
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,520
Do you think I look anything like Susan?

61
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,276
Lucy...

62
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,910
have you seen this ship before?

63
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,675
Yes. It's very Narnian-looking, isn't it?

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,273
Yeah.

65
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,795
Just another reminder
that we're here and not there.

66
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,033
There once were two orphans
Who wasted their time

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,598
Believing in Narnian nursery rhymes

68
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,352
- Please let me hit him.
- No!

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,318
- Don't you ever knock?
- It's my house. I'll do as I please.

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,435
You're just guests.

71
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,589
What's so fascinating
about that picture anyway?

72
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,909
It's hideous.

73
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,479
You won't see it
from the other side of the door.

74
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,830
Edmund, it looks like
the water is actually moving.

75
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,310
What rubbish!

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,629
See? That's what happens...

77
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,360
when you read all those fanciful novels
and fairy tales of yours.

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,431
There once was a boy called Eustace

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,989
Who read books
Full of facts that were useless

80
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,589
People who read fairy tales...

81
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,320
are always the sort who become
a hideous burden to people like me...

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,797
who read books with real information.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,989
"Hideous burden"?

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,593
I haven't seen you lift a finger
since we've been here.

85
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,918
I have a mind to tell your father
you stole Aunt Alberta's sweets.

86
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,433
- Liar!
- Oh, really?

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,113
Edmund, the painting.

88
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,840
I found them under your bed,
and you know what?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,353
I licked every one of them.

90
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,909
Ugh! I'm infected with you!

91
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,514
What's going on here?

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,671
- Lucy, do you think...?
- It's some kind of trick!

93
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,193
Stop it or I'll tell mother.

94
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,554
Mother!

95
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,835
Mother!

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,958
I'll just smash the rotten thing.

97
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,152
No, Eustace! No!

98
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,389
We can't stop it!

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,595
Get off me! Get off!

100
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,557
Let go of it, Eustace! Put it down!

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,551
- Get off it!
- Let go!

102
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,075
Edmund!

103
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,316
Edmund!

104
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,277
What's happening?

105
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,079
Where are we?

106
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,559
Eustace, swim!

107
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,388
What's going on?

108
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,879
Eustace, come on!

109
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,234
Come on, move!

110
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,470
Keep swimming!

111
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,993
Edmund!

112
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,513
It's all right. I've got you.

113
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,435
Caspian!

114
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,033
Lucy.

115
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,394
Edmund, it's Caspian!

116
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,949
It's all right, boys. You're safe now.

117
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,030
Are we in Narnia?

118
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,792
Yes, you're in Narnia.

119
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,109
I don't want to go!

120
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,273
I want to go back to England!
I'm going back to England!

121
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,988
Hold on.

122
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,519
That was thrilling!

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,591
How in the world did you end up here?

124
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,113
I have no idea.

125
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,508
Caspian.

126
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,795
Edmund.

127
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,949
It's great to see you.

128
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,190
- Great to see you.
- Didn't you call for us?

129
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,954
No. Not this time.

130
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,270
Well, whatever the case,
I'm just glad to be here.

131
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,918
- Now calm down, sir.
- Get that thing off me!

132
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,195
Get that thing off me!

133
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,434
Reepicheep!

134
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,953
Your Majesties.

135
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,031
Hello, Reep. What a pleasure.

136
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,918
The pleasure is all mine, sir.

137
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,152
But first, what to do
about this hysterical...

138
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,435
interloper?

139
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,828
That giant rat thing...

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,149
just tried to claw my face off!

141
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,594
I was merely trying...

142
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,113
to expel the water...

143
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,235
from your lungs, sir.

144
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,676
It talked! Did you see?
Did anyone just hear that? It just talked!

145
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,400
- He always talks.
- It's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

146
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,869
The moment there is nothing to be said,
Your Highness...

147
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,474
I promise you, I will not say it.

148
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,871
I don't know what kind of prank this is,
but I want to wake up right now!

149
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,117
Perhaps we could throw him back?

150
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,836
Edmund!

151
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,513
I demand to know,
just where in the blazes am I?

152
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,079
You're on the Dawn Treader...

153
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,800
the finest ship in Narnia's navy.

154
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,468
Was it something I said?

155
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,595
See to him, will you?

156
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,313
Your Majesty.

157
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,189
Men...

158
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,872
behold our castaways...

159
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,955
Edmund the Just
and Lucy the Valliant...

160
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,998
high King and Queen of Narnia.

161
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,989
Aslan.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,069
Look...

163
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,231
Susan's bow and arrows.

164
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,150
Lucy.

165
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,713
My healing cordial...

166
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,473
and dagger.

167
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,914
Oh, may I?

168
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,678
Of course, they're yours.

169
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,875
Peter's sword.

170
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,075
Yes.

171
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,076
I looked after it as promised.

172
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,310
Here, hold it if you wish.

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,072
No, no, it's yours.

174
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,153
Peter gave it to you.

175
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,954
I did save this for you though.

176
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,389
Thanks.

177
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,153
Since you left, the Giants of the North
surrendered unconditionally...

178
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,357
then we defeated the Calormen armies
at the Great Desert.

179
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,078
There is peace across all of Narnia.

180
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,275
Peace?

181
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,634
In just three years.

182
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,668
And have you found yourself a queen
in those three years?

183
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,393
No. Not one to compare with your sister.

184
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,357
Hang on.
If there are no wars to fight...

185
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,637
and no one is in trouble,
then why are we here?

186
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,439
It's a good question.
I've been asking myself the same thing.

187
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,194
So where are we sailing to?

188
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,591
Before I took back the throne
from my uncle...

189
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,435
he tried to kill my father's closest friends
and most loyal supporters.

190
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,432
The seven lords of Telmar.

191
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,188
They fled to the Lone Islands.

192
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,068
No one has heard from them since.

193
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,116
So you think something
has happened to them?

194
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,352
Well, if it has, it's my duty to find out.

195
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,839
Well, what's east of the Lone Islands?

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,274
Uncharted waters.

197
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,475
Things you can barely imagine.

198
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,870
Tales of sea serpents and worse.

199
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,389
Sea serpents?

200
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,675
All right, Captain...

201
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,880
that's enough of your tall tales.

202
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,675
Where sky and water meet

203
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,195
Where the waves grow ever sweet

204
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,114
Doubt not, you Reepicheep

205
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,308
To find all that you seek

206
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,199
There is the Utter East
Doubt not...

207
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,271
That's pretty.

208
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,953
Thank you.

209
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,392
A dryad sung it to me
when I was just a mouseling.

210
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,916
I can't divine the meaning,
but I've never forgotten the words.

211
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,116
What do you think is past
the Lone Islands, Reep?

212
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,234
Well, I've been told the furthest east
one can sail is to the end of the world.

213
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,594
Aslan's country.

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,752
Do you really believe
there's such a place?

215
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,550
Well, we have nothing, if not belief.

216
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,750
Do you think you could
actually sail there?

217
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,229
Well, there is only one way
of finding that out.

218
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,188
I can only hope I will one day
earn the right to see it.

219
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,397
Your Majesty.

220
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,673
Come on.

221
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,430
You've grown stronger, my friend.

222
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,352
Seems I have.

223
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,118
All right, back to work.

224
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,711
- Your Highness.
- Thank you.

225
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,435
Edmund...

226
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,874
do you think if we keep sailing...

227
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,155
to the end of the world...

228
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,517
we'll just... tip off the edge?

229
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,717
Don't worry, Lu,
we're a long way from there.

230
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,474
I see you're still talking nonsense,
the two of you.

231
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,709
Are you feeling better?

232
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,156
Yes, no thanks to you.
It's lucky I have an iron constitution.

233
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,799
As effervescent as ever, I see.

234
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,349
Find your sea legs?

235
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,954
Never lost them.
Simply dealing with the shock of things.

236
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,435
Mother says I have an acute disposition,
due to my intelligence.

237
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,950
I don't think he has a cute anything.

238
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
I'll have you all know,
as soon as we find civilization...

239
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,719
I'm contacting the British Consul.
Have you all arrested for kidnapping.

240
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,710
Kidnapping, is it?

241
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,835
That's funny.

242
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,589
I thought we saved your life.

243
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,034
You held me against my will!

244
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,796
Did I?

245
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,315
In, what I must say,
are the most unhygienic quarters.

246
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,708
It's like a zoo down there!

247
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,472
He's quite the complainer, isn't he?

248
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,914
He's just warming up.

249
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,833
Land ho!

250
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,555
The Lone Islands.
The port of Narrowhaven.

251
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,349
Strange, not a Narnian flag in sight.

252
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,436
But the Lone Islands
have always been Narnia's.

253
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,753
Seems suspicious.

254
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,233
I say we prepare a landing party.

255
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,479
Drinian?

256
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,752
Forgive me, Your Majesty...

257
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,390
but the chain of command starts
with King Caspian on this ship.

258
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,516
Right.

259
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,033
We'll use longboats.

260
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,713
Drinian, pick some men
and come ashore.

261
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,313
- Aye.
- Tavros.

262
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,390
Man the longboats, furl the sail
and prepare to drop anchor.

263
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,196
Onward!
The thrill of the unknown lies ahead.

264
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,592
Couldn't this have waited
till the morning?

265
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,073
There is no honor in turning away
from adventure, lad.

266
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,559
Listen.

267
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,749
Where is everyone?

268
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,353
Come on, jelly legs.

269
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,318
I'm capable of doing it myself.

270
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,712
And you're certain
he's related by blood?

271
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,759
Reepicheep, stay here with Drinian's men
and secure the place.

272
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,914
We'll head on.

273
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,072
If we don't come back by dawn,
send a party.

274
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,912
Yes, Your Majesty.

275
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,274
Yeah, looks like nobody is in.
Do you think we should head back?

276
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,758
Do you want to come here and guard...
something?

277
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,869
Yes.

278
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,915
Good idea, cousin.

279
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,160
Very logical.

280
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,511
I've got it. I've got it. Don't worry.

281
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,429
I'm ready to go when you are.

282
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,397
Who are all these people?

283
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,199
Why have they been crossed out?

284
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,797
It looks like some kind of fee.

285
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,109
Slave traders.

286
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,073
Look out!

287
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,557
Unless you want to hear this one
squeal like a girl again...

288
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,593
I'd say you should...

289
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,476
drop your weapons.

290
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,312
- Like a girl?
- Now!

291
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,149
Put it down.

292
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,115
Eustace.

293
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,034
Put them in irons.

294
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,553
Come on. Come here, you.

295
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,750
Get your hands off me!

296
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,638
Let's take these two to market.

297
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,630
Let go!

298
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,074
Send those two to the dungeons.

299
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,878
Listen to me, you insolent fool!

300
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,155
I am your king!

301
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,599
You're gonna pay for that.

302
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,239
Actually...

303
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,752
someone else is going to pay...

304
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,996
for all of you.

305
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,037
- No! Edmund! Edmund!
- Lucy!

306
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,710
No! Edmund!

307
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,879
You all right?

308
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,349
Yeah.

309
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,394
It's hopeless.

310
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,478
You'll never get out.

311
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,553
Who's there?

312
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,194
Nobody. Just a voice...

313
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,952
in my head.

314
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,990
Lord Bern?

315
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,678
Perhaps once, but I'm no longer
deserving of that title.

316
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,549
Is he one of the seven?

317
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,150
Your face...

318
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,710
You remind me of a king
I once loved well.

319
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,635
That man was my father.

320
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,877
Oh, my lord.

321
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,315
- Please forgive me.
- No, please.

322
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,755
Please.

323
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,075
No!

324
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,193
No!

325
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,230
Helaine!

326
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,230
- Mummy!
- No!

327
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,236
Helaine!

328
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,159
- Mummy!
- Please!

329
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,436
Mummy!

330
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,194
Get back!

331
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,269
- Mummy!
- Stay with Daddy!

332
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,715
Don't worry! I'll find you!

333
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,553
Mummy!

334
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,155
No!

335
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,754
Where are they taking them?

336
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,674
Keep watching.

337
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,434
What happened?

338
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,636
It's a sacrifice.

339
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,228
Where did they go?

340
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,869
No one knows.

341
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,036
The mist was first seen in the east.

342
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,676
Reports of fishermen and sailors
disappearing out at sea.

343
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,110
We lords made a pact...

344
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,828
to find the source of the mist
to destroy it.

345
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,673
They each set sail...

346
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,876
but none came back.

347
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,477
You see, if they don't sell you
to the slave traders...

348
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,312
you're likely to be fed to the mist.

349
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,674
We have to find Lucy...

350
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,509
before it's too late.

351
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,557
- I bid 60.
- I bid 80.

352
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,199
100 for the little lady.

353
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,679
120.

354
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,636
150.

355
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,550
Any more bids?

356
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,515
Sold!

357
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,838
Come on, move.

358
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,716
Move!

359
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,790
And now...

360
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,075
for this...

361
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,673
fine specimen...

362
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,235
who'll kick off the bidding?

363
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,317
Come on now...

364
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,552
he may not look like much
but he's strong.

365
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,948
Yeah, he's strong, all right.

366
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,350
Smells like the rear end of a Minotaur!

367
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,991
That is an outrageous lie!

368
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,353
I won the school hygiene award
two years running.

369
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,870
Come on, someone make a bid!

370
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,871
I'll take them off your hands.

371
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,837
I'll take them all off your hands!

372
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,989
For Narnia!

373
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,669
Narnia!

374
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,199
Guards! Guards! Move yourselves!

375
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,752
Thanks, Reep. I knew you'd come.

376
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,035
Your Highness.

377
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,990
Get the keys!

378
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,149
Keys!

379
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,917
Oh, you're a boat in a magical land.
Can't you row yourself?

380
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,030
Oh, God. I hope that wasn't
the British Consul.

381
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,438
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

382
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,476
Hold it!

383
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,636
My wife was taken just this morning.

384
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,710
It's all right, Drinian.

385
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,313
I beg you, take me with you.

386
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,435
Gael!

387
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,273
- I want to come.
- No, Gael, stay with your aunt.

388
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,876
I'm a fine sailor.
Been on the seas my whole life.

389
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,359
Of course, you must.

390
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,999
- Thank you.
- But, Daddy!

391
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,479
Have I ever not come back?

392
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,471
Now be good.

393
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,719
My king.

394
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,633
My king.

395
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,271
This was given to me by your father.
I hid it safely in a cave all these years.

396
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,908
That's an old Narnian sword.

397
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,792
It's from your Golden Age.

398
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,590
There are seven such swords,
gifts from Aslan to protect Narnia.

399
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,109
Your father entrusted them to us.

400
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,638
Here, take it.

401
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,873
And may it protect you.

402
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,109
Thank you, my lord.

403
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,872
And we shall find your lost citizens.

404
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,195
Edmund.

405
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,555
Dear diary, there has been
an extraordinary turn of events.

406
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,278
I've been abducted by my cousins...

407
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,194
and set adrift in uncharted waters
in some ridiculous-looking boat.

408
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,148
What's worse is I share quarters
with an obnoxious mouse thing.

409
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,312
And I thought bunking with
my cousin was bad enough.

410
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,914
So far, every person I've met
in this strange place...

411
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,988
suffers from the most florid delusions.

412
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,956
Chasing green mists
and looking for lost lords.

413
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,799
I can only assume that this is...

414
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,996
the result of poor diet.

415
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,112
Or they're all just barking mad.

416
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,475
Cousin Edmund is no exception.

417
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,518
He spends every spare second
rubbing that tin sword of his...

418
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,159
like it's some magic lantern.

419
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,878
Poor fool clearly needs a hobby.

420
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,952
It's going to be magnificent.
Do they come in a smaller size?

421
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,310
Peeving marmot!

422
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,513
He's even more deluded than my cousin.

423
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,800
In England, we have mouse traps
for that sort of thing.

424
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,872
Speaking of food, you don't know
where I could get any, do you?

425
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,030
Why are you talking to that bird?

426
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,838
I just naturally assumed you can...

427
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,595
He's talking to birds!

428
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,113
He's mad as a loon, that one.

429
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,156
Yeah!

430
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,071
Go on, get off!

431
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,996
Are you aware...

432
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,311
that stealing rations
is a capital offense at sea?

433
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,109
Up here.

434
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,869
Oh, you.

435
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,358
Men have been keelhauled for less.

436
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,396
For what?

437
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,515
For treason...

438
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,591
and sneakiness
and general nuisancery.

439
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,593
Look, just hand over the orange
and we'll let the matter pass.

440
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,079
I don't know what you're talking about.

441
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,832
Allow me to cla...

442
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,433
Look, I've had quite enough of you.

443
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,989
Unhand the tail.

444
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,356
The great Aslan himself
gave me this tail.

445
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,111
No one...

446
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,714
repeat, no one touches the tail.

447
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,830
Period.

448
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,069
Exclamation mark.

449
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,150
Sorry.

450
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,152
Now, I will have the orange...

451
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,117
then I will have satisfaction.

452
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,032
Please, I'm a pacifist.

453
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,996
En garde!

454
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,953
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

455
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,194
Trying to run away?

456
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,919
We're on a boat, you know.

457
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,672
Look, can't we just discuss this?

458
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,674
That was for stealing...

459
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,193
that was for lying...

460
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,033
and that was for good measure.

461
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,718
That's the spirit!
We have ourselves a duel.

462
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,154
Catch.

463
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,079
Now, come on.

464
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,673
Take your best shot.

465
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,432
Is that it? Come on, boy.

466
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,275
Focus! Focus!

467
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,149
Yes!

468
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,995
Stop flapping your wings
like a drunken pelican! Poise.

469
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,116
Keep your blade up.

470
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,156
Up, up! That's it.

471
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,957
Now...

472
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,434
Over here.

473
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,192
Now, lunge with your foot.

474
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,193
Not your left, your right.

475
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,954
Got it? Come on.
Be nimble! Be nimble!

476
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,917
It's a dance, boy, a dance.

477
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,798
Come on now, again and again.

478
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,109
That's right, that's right.

479
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,949
Oh, no!

480
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,675
And that...

481
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,595
is that.

482
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,309
Look.

483
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,515
Gael?

484
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,157
What are you doing here?

485
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,794
Here.

486
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,113
Looks like we have an extra...

487
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,713
crew member.

488
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,195
Welcome aboard.

489
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,475
Your Majesty.

490
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,595
Call me Lucy.

491
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,950
Come on.

492
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,238
Come on, look lively.

493
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,788
Back to work.

494
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,074
Good match.

495
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,078
I'll make a swordsman of you yet.

496
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,795
Yes, well, if the playing field
were a little more even...

497
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,678
it would've been
an entirely different result.

498
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,240
Indeed.

499
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,831
It looks uninhabited.

500
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,515
But if the lords followed the mist east,
they would have stopped here.

501
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,591
Could be a trap.

502
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,272
Or it could hold some answers.

503
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,358
Caspian?

504
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,392
We'll spend the night on shore.
Scour the island in the morning.

505
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,709
Aye, your Majesty.

506
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,915
Seems they've brought a pig.

507
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,831
This one, it's female.

508
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,635
So is this one.

509
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,638
This one reads.

510
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,189
Let's take her.

511
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,197
There is no escape.

512
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,952
- Well put.
- Scary.

513
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,519
- Yeah.
- What are you?

514
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,955
We are terrifying invisible beasts.

515
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,157
If you could see us,
you would be really intimidated.

516
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,471
You forgot to mention
that we are very large.

517
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,039
- Well, what do you want?
- You.

518
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,988
You'll do what we ask.

519
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,718
- She will.
- Very clear.

520
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,552
- Well put.
- Yeah.

521
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,356
Or what?

522
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,555
Or death.

523
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,153
Death? Death? Death?

524
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,392
Death. Death. Death.

525
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,191
Well, I wouldn't be much use
to you dead, would I?

526
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,634
I hadn't thought of that.

527
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,869
No, you hadn't.

528
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,234
Fair point.

529
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,836
All right,
then we'll just kill your friends.

530
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,719
Good idea.

531
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,871
What do you want with me?

532
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,235
You will enter the house...

533
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,753
of The Oppressor.

534
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,629
What house?

535
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,279
This one.

536
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,070
Upstairs, you'll find
The Book of Incantations.

537
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,630
Recite the spell
that makes the unseen seen.

538
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,518
Well put, Chief. Well put.

539
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,669
Yeah.

540
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,114
Yeah.

541
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,311
Well, go on. We haven't got all day.

542
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,072
Remember what will happen
to your friends.

543
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,793
You've been warned.

544
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,234
Yeah. Yeah.

545
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,674
- Yeah.
- Right.

546
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,949
Right.

547
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,075
Yeah.

548
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,673
Why don't you do it yourselves?

549
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,793
We can't read.

550
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,918
Can't write either, as a matter of fact.

551
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,308
Or add.

552
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,794
Yeah.

553
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,080
Why didn't you just say so?

554
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,833
Beware The Oppressor.

555
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,558
He's very oppressive.

556
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,868
"What makes the unseen seen," got it?

557
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,029
Don't forget.

558
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,634
- Don't forget that.
- Yeah.

559
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,749
Ed.

560
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,909
Ed, wake up.

561
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,072
Wake up, look.

562
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,873
Where's Lucy?

563
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,473
Lucy?

564
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,516
Lucy!

565
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,193
Everybody up!

566
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,150
Get up.

567
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,230
Get up, I said!

568
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,795
This way!

569
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,075
Move, you blackguards.

570
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,030
"With these words
Your tongue must sew

571
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,749
For all around there to be snow"

572
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,999
"An infallible spell

573
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,639
To make you she

574
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,631
The beauty you've always wanted to be"

575
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,191
Susan, what's going...

576
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,912
...on?

577
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,151
I'm beautiful.

578
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,795
No, wait!

579
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,477
"Make me she, whom I'd agree..."

580
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,634
Lucy!

581
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,953
Lucy.

582
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,916
Aslan?

583
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,033
Aslan?

584
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,750
"A spell to make the unseen seen."

585
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,158
"Like the 'p' in psychology

586
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,311
The 'h' in psychiatry

587
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,631
Invisible ink
And the truth in theology

588
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,074
Caspian, Lucy's dagger.

589
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,788
Stop right there or perish.

590
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,599
The spell is complete

591
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,274
Now all is visible"

592
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,990
- What sort of creatures are you?
- Big ones...

593
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,276
with the head of a tiger
and the body of a...

594
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,273
Different tiger.

595
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,278
You don't want to mess with us.

596
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,709
Or what?

597
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,235
Or I'll claw you to death.

598
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,755
And I'll ram my tusks right through you.

599
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,512
And I'll gnash you with my teeth.

600
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,399
And I'll bite you with my fangs.

601
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,790
You mean squash us
with your fat bellies?

602
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,915
Yes!

603
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,195
Fat bellies?

604
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,270
Tickle us with your toes?

605
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,119
What have you done with my sister,
you little pip-squeak?

606
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,994
Now, calm down.

607
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,036
Where is she?

608
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,350
- You better tell him.
- Go on, Chief, tell him.

609
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,475
In the mansion.

610
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,595
What mansion?

611
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,599
That mansion.

612
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,310
I'm really getting tired
of you all leaving me behi...

613
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,948
- It's the pig!
- The pig has come back.

614
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,118
This place just gets weirder and weirder.

615
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,360
- Weird?
- Him calling us weird?

616
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,029
The Oppressor!
The Oppressor! The Oppressor!

617
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,836
Lucy.

618
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,949
Your Majesty.

619
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,835
Caspian and Edmund.

620
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,719
This is Coriakin. It's his island.

621
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,359
That's what he thinks.

622
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,953
You have wronged us, magician.

623
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,278
I have not wronged you.

624
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,034
I made you invisible
for your own protection.

625
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,030
Protection?

626
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,872
- That's oppressive!
- Oppressor!

627
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,712
I have not oppressed you.

628
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,030
But you could've, if you'd wanted to.

629
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,230
Begone.

630
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,711
It's a spell!

631
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,519
What was that?

632
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,676
Lint.

633
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,394
But don't tell them.

634
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,589
What were those things?

635
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,352
Dufflepuds.

636
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,472
Right, of course. Silly me.

637
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,790
What did you mean when you said you
made them invisible for their own good?

638
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,520
It seemed the easiest way
to protect them...

639
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,676
from the evil.

640
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,191
You mean the mist?

641
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,713
I mean what lies behind the mist.

642
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,828
That's quite beautiful.

643
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,390
I mean, for a make-believe map
of a make-believe world.

644
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,879
There is the source of your troubles.

645
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,873
Dark Island.

646
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,469
A place where evil lurks.

647
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,150
It can take any form. It can make
your darkest dreams come true.

648
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,911
It seeks to corrupt all goodness...

649
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,635
to steal the light from this world.

650
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,035
How do we stop it?

651
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,433
You must break its spell.

652
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,309
That sword you carry...
there are six others.

653
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,993
- Have you seen them?
- Yes.

654
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,594
The six lords, they passed through here?

655
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,988
Indeed.

656
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,195
Where were they headed?

657
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,191
Where I sent them.

658
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,992
To break the spell...

659
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,430
you must follow the Blue Star...

660
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,750
to Ramandu's Island.

661
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,959
There, the seven swords
must be laid at Aslan's table.

662
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,680
Only then can their true
magical power be released.

663
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,994
But beware...

664
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,072
you are all about to be tested.

665
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,468
Tested?

666
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,030
Until you lay down the seventh sword,
evil has the upper hand.

667
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,594
It will do everything...

668
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,432
in its power...

669
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,670
to tempt you.

670
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,994
Be strong.

671
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,878
Don't fall to temptation.

672
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,438
To defeat the darkness out there...

673
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,716
you must defeat the darkness
inside yourself.

674
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,910
For reasons beyond my comprehension...

675
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,310
we've taken the advice
of a senile old coot...

676
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,439
who doesn't possess a razor
and dawdles around in a dressing gown.

677
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,390
So we're back in this tub
and lost in a tempest. Brilliant!

678
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,357
Hold!

679
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,317
Three spokes to starboard.

680
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,674
Aye-aye, sir.

681
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,875
More pails here.

682
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,553
Pass it down!

683
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,312
Heave!

684
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,238
Fourteen days of being tossed like a
pancake and not the slightest sign of land.

685
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,473
The only consolation is,
everyone is finally...

686
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,675
as miserable as I am.

687
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,278
Except for that show-off talking rat.

688
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,672
He's one of those annoying
glass-is-always-half-full types.

689
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,513
So we're stuck here...

690
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,190
at half-rations, with food and water
for two more weeks, maximum.

691
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,833
This is your last chance to turn back,
Your Majesties.

692
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,718
There's no guarantee we'll spot
the Blue Star anytime soon.

693
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,074
Not in this storm.

694
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,997
Needle in a haystack,
trying to find this Ramandu place.

695
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,549
We could sail right past it
and off the edge of the world.

696
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,472
Or get eaten by a sea serpent.

697
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,229
I'm just saying the men
are getting nervous.

698
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,468
These are strange seas we're sailing...

699
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,154
the likes of which
I've never seen before.

700
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,551
Then perhaps, Captain, you would like
to be the one to explain to Mr. Rhince...

701
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,551
that we're abandoning
the search for his family.

702
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,398
I'll get back to it.

703
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,514
Just a word of warning.

704
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,035
The sea can play nasty tricks
on the crew's mind.

705
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,033
Very nasty.

706
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,912
Transform my reflection

707
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,232
Cast into perfection
Lashes, lips and complexion

708
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,469
Make me she

709
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,792
Whom I'd agree
Holds more beauty over me

710
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,753
Ladies and gentlemen...

711
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,558
Miss Pevensie.

712
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,835
She's quite a looker. Swell.

713
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,876
Edmund!

714
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,519
You look beautiful, sister.

715
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,835
As always.

716
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,718
Peter!

717
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,071
Excuse me, miss, can I get a photo?

718
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,912
Mother's going to love this.

719
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,832
All her children in one picture.

720
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,115
Smile.

721
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,875
Hang on, where am I?
I mean, where's Lucy?

722
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,270
Lucy? Who's Lucy?

723
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,758
Susan, what's wrong?

724
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,435
Come on now, miss. Nice big smile.

725
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,114
Edmund, I'm not sure about all this.
I think I want to go back.

726
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,156
Go back where?

727
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,673
To Narnia.

728
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,796
What on earth is Narnia?

729
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,916
What's going on? Stop this!

730
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,549
Lucy.

731
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,239
Aslan?

732
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,189
What have you done, child?

733
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,514
I don't know.

734
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,879
That was awful.

735
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,550
But you chose it, Lucy.

736
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,399
I didn't mean to choose all of that.

737
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,597
I just wanted to be beautiful like Susan.

738
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,271
That's all.

739
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,719
You wished yourself away,
and with it much more.

740
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,589
Your brothers and sister wouldn't
know Narnia without you, Lucy.

741
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,991
You discovered it first, remember?

742
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,557
I'm so sorry.

743
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,993
You doubt your value.

744
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,879
Don't run from who you are.

745
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,193
Aslan!

746
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,878
Father! Father...

747
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,950
Edmund. Edmund.

748
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,956
Come with me. Join me.

749
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,195
Edmund.

750
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,191
Oh, Lucy.

751
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,794
I can't sleep.

752
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,835
Let me guess.

753
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,719
Bad dreams.

754
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,549
So either we're all going mad...

755
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,797
or something is playing with our minds.

756
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,870
I doubt the lords stopped here, my liege.

757
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,917
There's no sign of anything living.

758
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,876
Right.

759
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,157
Well, once we get ashore, take your men
and search for food and water.

760
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,958
The three of us will look for clues.

761
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,553
Hang on, you mean the four of us.

762
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,355
Come on, please don't
send me back to the rat.

763
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,112
I heard that.

764
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,676
Big ears.

765
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,592
I heard that too.

766
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,998
Go on, unload it all.

767
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,030
Look, we're not the first ones
on this island.

768
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,076
The lords?

769
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,551
Could be.

770
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,438
What do you think could be down there?

771
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,598
Let's find out.

772
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,753
What's that?

773
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,069
I don't know.

774
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,515
Looks like some sort of gold statue.

775
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,471
He must have fallen in.

776
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,435
Poor man.

777
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,473
You mean, "poor lord."

778
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,629
The crest of Lord Restimar.

779
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,035
And his sword.

780
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,189
We need it.

781
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,628
Be careful.

782
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,997
Your sword hasn't turned to gold.

783
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,434
Both the swords are magical.

784
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,353
Here.

785
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,678
He mustn't have known what hit him.

786
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,635
Maybe.

787
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,150
Or maybe he was onto something.

788
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,554
What are you talking about?

789
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,033
What are you staring at?

790
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,878
Whoever has access to this pool...

791
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,989
could be the most powerful
person in the world.

792
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,076
Lucy, we'd be so rich.

793
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,151
No one could tell us what to do...

794
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,833
or who to live with.

795
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,150
You can't take anything
out of Narnia, Edmund.

796
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,993
Says who?

797
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,955
I do.

798
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,952
I'm not your subject.

799
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,192
You've been waiting for this,
haven't you?

800
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,237
To challenge me?
You doubt my leadership?

801
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,753
You doubt yourself.

802
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,591
You're a child!

803
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,988
And you're a spineless sap!

804
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:43,876
Edmund.

805
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,792
I'm tired of playing second fiddle.

806
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,190
First it was Peter and now it's you!

807
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,556
You know I'm braver than both of you.

808
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,671
Why do you get Peter's sword?

809
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,356
I deserve a kingdom of my own.
I deserve to rule!

810
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,715
If you think you're so brave, prove it!

811
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,356
No!

812
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,592
Stop it!

813
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,715
Both of you!

814
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,312
Look at yourselves.

815
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,038
Can't you see what's happening?

816
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,599
This place has tempted you.

817
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,311
It's bewitching you.

818
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,752
This is exactly what Coriakin
was talking about.

819
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,430
Let's just get out of here.

820
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,475
Oh, yes, follow the imaginary Blue Star
to the island of Ramandoodoo.

821
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,109
Lay the seven steak knives
at the table of a talking lion.
