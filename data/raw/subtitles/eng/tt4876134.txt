00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:21,740
<i>In a five-year period, 19,000
bank robberies were reported to the FBI.</i>

3
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:27,412
<i>So, that means there were
19,000 bank robbers</i>

4
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,215
<i>who didn't do
their job correctly.</i>

5
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,417
<i>Who wants the FBI on their ass?</i>

6
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:39,058
<i>Nah, man. I say, if you gonna rob a
bank, make sure it ain't reported.</i>

7
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:45,797
<i>Funny thing about
safe deposit boxes...</i>

8
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,501
<i>ain't nothing safe about them.</i>

9
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,920
<i>None of the shit
in the boxes is insured.</i>

10
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:10,923
<i>Try reporting a loss to
the bank or the government,</i>

11
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:13,826
<i>you'll get the middle finger
in fine print.</i>

12
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,564
<i>So who would use
a safe deposit box?</i>

13
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,466
<i>Stupid people.</i>

14
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,170
<i>And criminals.</i>

15
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,973
<i>Now, I ain't got no problem
with stupid people,</i>

16
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:30,042
<i>as long as their stupidity
don't hurt nobody.</i>

17
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,981
<i>The owner of box 2504
is a deadbeat dad</i>

18
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:38,217
<i>who hides his income so he
doesn't have to pay child support.</i>

19
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:41,320
<i>How you gonna do that
to your own kid?</i>

20
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:46,258
<i>Let me be clear. I never steal
from people who don't deserve it.</i>

21
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:51,730
<i>And what I steal, always goes
back to those who've been harmed.</i>

22
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:57,103
<i>That handsome black man?
Yeah, that's me. Ringo.</i>

23
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,972
<i>Yeah, Ringo, like the Beatle.</i>

24
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,942
<i>And don't start with that
John, Paul, George shit,</i>

25
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,077
<i>'cause I ain't got time
to get into it.</i>

26
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:08,680
<i>What you need to pay attention
to is my masterful disguise.</i>

27
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:11,183
<i>I'm a black chameleon, baby.</i>

28
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:17,223
<i>And I'm empty-handed.</i>

29
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,193
<i>'Cause when those a-holes
discover their boxes are empty,</i>

30
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,928
<i>they'll get pissed.</i>

31
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:29,935
<i>They'll yell
at the bank manager,</i>

32
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:33,105
<i>the bank manager might even let
him see the security footage,</i>

33
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:39,979
<i>but he will also explain what I already
told you... That shit ain't insured.</i>

34
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:44,549
<i>One thing they will not do
is report it to the FBI,</i>

35
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:47,253
<i>'cause roaches hide
from the light.</i>

36
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:58,563
<i>And in about six months, I'll empty
my safe deposit box and close my account.</i>

37
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:06,072
<i>And I will write
a few wrongs, anonymously.</i>

38
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,242
Oh my God, David,
pack your things!

39
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:14,980
<i>Turns out I'm not the only
one who feels good about doing good.</i>

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,950
<i>That little dude,
his name is Wick.</i>

41
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:22,754
<i>As a kid he heard
some Chinese story</i>

42
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:25,324
<i>about firecrackers scaring
away evil spirits.</i>

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,795
<i>There's two things you need
to know about Wick.</i>

44
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:32,730
<i>First off...</i>

45
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,733
<i>He don't give up.</i>

46
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:41,073
<i>And eventually he got really
good at blowing shit up.</i>

47
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:46,611
<i>Dude made a mint in Vegas when
they decided to remodel the whole city.</i>

48
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:51,050
<i>Second, he's still the same
kid I first told you about.</i>

49
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,922
<i>He's still goofy as hell, still has the
same haircut, still looks like he's 12...</i>

50
00:04:56,989 --> 00:05:01,093
<i>and he still believes firecrackers
can chase away evil spirits.</i>

51
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:03,496
<i>This was a drug
manufacturing plant.</i>

52
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,466
<i>Wick made sure no drugs would
ever come out of here again.</i>

53
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:09,168
<i>Now I wasn't there,</i>

54
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:11,937
<i>but I think it went a little
something like this.</i>

55
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,500
<i>That there is Violet.</i>

56
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:46,906
<i>Right now she in a church in
some shitty Eastern Euro country.</i>

57
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:52,945
<i>She just recently freed a bunch of
young girls from a sex trafficking ring.</i>

58
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:57,715
<i>And those are some
shitty Eastern Euro thugs</i>

59
00:05:57,782 --> 00:06:03,322
<i>who are about to join a long list of men
who underestimated Violet's girl power.</i>

60
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:27,947
<i>Yo, it was like some
Matrix-style shit.</i>

61
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:32,017
<i>Now I ain't saying she
defied gravity or anything,</i>

62
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,054
<i>'cause I wasn't there.</i>

63
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:39,291
<i>But I do know only one person
walked out of there that day.</i>

64
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,865
<i>About a year ago,
we didn't know each other.</i>

65
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:51,837
<i>That all changed with a bouquet
of flowers. Three bouquets.</i>

66
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:56,741
<i>Seemed our good deeds landed on
the radar of some philanthropist.</i>

67
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,645
<i>It was an offer
to step up our game.</i>

68
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,984
<i>Why take down a street hustler when you
can go after international corruption.</i>

69
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:09,255
<i>We became a team. We tried
to come up with a cool name.</i>

70
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:10,755
<i>The Robin Hoods.</i>

71
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,094
<i>Nah, I ain't going for any
name calling us no damn hoods.</i>

72
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:19,565
<i>Wick even suggested the Motley
Crew, with a straight face.</i>

73
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:23,269
<i>Hell nah. But I like
the Misfits.</i>

74
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,905
<i>Not everyone agreed
on the name, but eff that.</i>

75
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,843
<i>I'm telling the story,
So the Misfits it is.</i>

76
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:39,685
<i>Anyway, the next chapter in our
story started a little while ago</i>

77
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:41,819
<i>in a prison in Los Angeles.</i>

78
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,398
<i>The FBI is here to extradite
inmate 272523 to Mr. Schultz's prison.</i>

79
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:54,166
- Where?
- England.

80
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,769
Mr. Schultz runs
a privatized prison there,

81
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,071
this particular inmate,
Richard Pace, broke out.

82
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:02,207
And you came all this way
just for a prisoner escape?

83
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,143
Wife issues.

84
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:07,046
<i>Wife issues is Latin
for this prisoner</i>

85
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,214
<i>was laying pipe
to Schultz's wife.</i>

86
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:14,253
<i>And for Schultz...
that caused some issues.</i>

87
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,222
Wish prisons here would
send wardens on vacation.

88
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:18,524
Mr. Schultz isn't a warden.

89
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:21,560
No, he's a senior partner
in a multinational company

90
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:25,297
which happens to own, among other
things, prisons all over the planet.

91
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:29,134
Coming up on the right here.
440, open 312.

92
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:31,003
<i>Copy 21, opening now.</i>

93
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,706
<i>Name's Richard Pace...
you should know.</i>

94
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:35,074
Come back 440?

95
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:37,643
<i>Well, we just got
paperwork for his immediate release.</i>

96
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,912
<i>The judge apparently
threw out the charges.</i>

97
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:49,154
That's not Richard Pace.

98
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,858
He is good, though.

99
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,164
This is Pace this morning from the
prison exercise yard. Look at this.

100
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,768
There. Right there.

101
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,805
Look. I'm just spitballing here,
but I think that was a drone.

102
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:09,174
All right, if that's the drone,
what's the payload?

103
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:12,344
Could have been key-cards, it could've
been a birthday cake with a hacksaw in it.

104
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:15,481
All we know is that we've searched
this installation from top to bottom.

105
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:17,082
Richard Pace isn't here.

106
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:20,319
I don't get it. If he was going
to be released in 24 hours,

107
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:21,253
why break out?

108
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,656
Probably because there was
something he needed to do today...

109
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,393
not tomorrow.

110
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:33,565
You are...

111
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,033
- Hanni.
- Hanni.

112
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,568
Hanni Abu Assad.

113
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:38,270
Right.

114
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:40,105
So...

115
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,975
where's Pace?

116
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:45,010
How would I know?

117
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:49,248
Well, you bunked with him
for three months.

118
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:52,618
It seems that he did
that intentionally

119
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:56,555
because you had something
to tell him, something...

120
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:59,258
valuable to tell him.

121
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:05,531
I don't know.

122
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:08,500
Right.

123
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,273
Well, maybe...

124
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:22,548
you will feel better...
talking to me in... private.

125
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,326
- Power went down.
- Damn it.

126
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:36,930
Now we got a foreign national
alone in a room with a felon.

127
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,102
What's going on?

128
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:47,506
Look at that.

129
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:51,243
I know where Pace is.

130
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,612
Excuse me.

131
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,815
<i>Hell yeah,
he know where Pace was.</i>

132
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:01,320
<i>He just beat the info out of poor
Hanni with a damn cell phone.</i>

133
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,197
<i>Turns out,
Hanni used to be the valet</i>

134
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:14,366
<i>of Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani.</i>

135
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,202
<i>Pace learned the prince
like to do stupid shit</i>

136
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,705
<i>like travel into Los Angeles
once a year</i>

137
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:21,373
<i>for a single day of shopping.</i>

138
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:31,283
- My usual.
- Next round on the house.

139
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,487
<i>He also never traveled without
his high-value collection of timepieces.</i>

140
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:38,156
<i>That's expensive-ass watches.</i>

141
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:43,362
Girard-Joseph Grand Ellava.

142
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:49,701
Gold, platinum, 23 carats,
D color, flawless diamonds.

143
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,805
One of only two ever made.

144
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:56,275
Whoo.

145
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:01,313
Richard Pace.

146
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:05,083
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

147
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:10,122
You're Kuwaiti, huh?

148
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:14,593
I have a daughter who works
in the Middle East, UNICEF.

149
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:21,767
Charitable work, children, refugees and...
something like that.

150
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:28,507
So, uh...

151
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,209
...how much does a watch
like that go for?

152
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,014
Four, five mill...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

153
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,548
- I do apolo... I'm so sorry.
- Really.

154
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:39,886
Please, please, please.
Just let me, there you go.

155
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,021
- It's fine.
- You got some right there.

156
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,522
Oops, I do apologize.

157
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,059
- If you don't mind.
- Yes, okay.

158
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:48,493
My fault, I've had
too much to drink

159
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:53,332
it's just one of those days.
Okay. Time to go.

160
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:05,677
Hello.

161
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,412
Hello.

162
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,849
What you got there?

163
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:14,453
Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani?

164
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:16,321
It's an old picture.

165
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:22,227
Do you want to go
and talk about this?

166
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,562
Hmm, no, not really.

167
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,999
Yeah, he wants to go
and talk about it.

168
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:27,232
Jesus.

169
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:47,219
It's an honest living.

170
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:58,530
- Penthouse.
- Hold up.

171
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:00,399
You don't have any
jurisdiction or authority here.

172
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:01,667
You let the FBI
handle this.

173
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,535
You heard him.
Knock yourself out.

174
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:10,208
Here you go.

175
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,380
- Go to the bedroom.
- Copy that.

176
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,350
I'm going to go wash up.

177
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,988
You go through the first door.
I'll go through the second.

178
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:35,761
My watches are gone!

179
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:39,798
How are we doing?

180
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,434
We had some company.

181
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:44,770
Almost there.

182
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:46,605
How we doing?

183
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:48,507
We are almost there. Yeah.

184
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,883
Clear.

185
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:01,353
- Hey!
- Hey!

186
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:12,965
- Gentlemen, I had a lovely stay.
- Your car is waiting for you.

187
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:20,039
Surprise!

188
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,743
Ah, thank you.

189
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:30,249
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you too, uh,

190
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:33,752
- Prince Al Zahrani?
- No, I made that up.

191
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,158
<i>This is the Prince. Not Prince
Al Zahrani. He made that shit up.</i>

192
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:42,527
<i>He claims to be a prince from some
country nobody's ever heard of.</i>

193
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:45,330
<i>But that don't matter.
What matters is...</i>

194
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:49,334
<i>remember the philanthropist who
sent the flowers? This is that dude.</i>

195
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:52,404
- Shall we?
- Let's roll. Like right now.

196
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,145
All right, bring the cars
around, let's go. Let's go.

197
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:17,629
Shit.

198
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:24,569
Thank you. These are mine.

199
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:29,008
So this is a con?

200
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:32,811
<i>Con seems pretty inadequate
to describe what we did.</i>

201
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:36,249
<i>We even hired the dude to
play Hanni as Pace's cellmate.</i>

202
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:39,584
<i>Yeah, we probably gon' have to
give that dude some worker's comp.</i>

203
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,288
Color me minorly
impressed, but why?

204
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:47,792
Simple. We need you, you don't need us.
For that, we needed leverage.

205
00:17:56,468 --> 00:18:00,639
You know what they call a serious
crime captured on multiple hotel cameras?

206
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:06,511
Leverage. Now,
you need us. Simple.

207
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,095
- Who exactly is us?
- Me and my friends.

208
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:36,042
You don't have to come with us.

209
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:44,449
Up to you.

210
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:54,860
What are we waiting for?

211
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:14,746
What the hell did Pace do to
Schultz's wife that was so bad?

212
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,852
Let's just say Mrs. Schultz
isn't the one upset by it.

213
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,088
Oh. Oh...

214
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:44,276
Here's to my kidnapping. Whoo!

215
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,812
Kidnapping requires a element
of force, no force here.

216
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:49,581
You're free to go
whenever you want.

217
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:51,350
There's an exit sign
right behind you.

218
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,986
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll
just pass on that one.

219
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:55,720
My man.

220
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:57,957
The name's Ringo.

221
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:01,327
That's Violet. That's my man
Wick over there.

222
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:05,563
You already had a chance to meet the
con artist formerly known as Prince.

223
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:10,602
- Is this some kind of criminal organization?
- Nah, not criminal at all.

224
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,238
Just a few people trying
to do what's right.

225
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:18,777
Well, you got the wrong guy here
because right is not what I do.

226
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:22,848
Oh, we know.
You got quite the reputation.

227
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,582
Yeah, the only thing that
you better at

228
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,886
than stealing
people's shit is getting caught.

229
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:30,423
And escaping.
You're a damn legend.

230
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,791
How many of Schultz's
prisons did he escape?

231
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:35,261
By my count, four, give or take.

232
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:38,297
Four prisons?
Built by the same guy?

233
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:43,035
I love it, man, we all love it.
But you know who don't love it?

234
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,370
- Schultz.
- Mm-mm.

235
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:45,838
He don't love it at all.

236
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:49,041
And that don't have nothing to do with
the rumors about you and his wife.

237
00:20:52,777 --> 00:20:55,548
Schultz didn't come to extradite
you back to his prison.

238
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,350
Those papers were forged.
He was there to kill you.

239
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,922
Judging by your contributions to society thus
far, I can't say it was the wrong choice.

240
00:21:03,022 --> 00:21:05,257
But we're giving you
a chance to turn things around.

241
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:07,126
Oh great, lucky me.

242
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:12,031
Look, all you have to know is we got
the same piece of shit on our shoes,

243
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:13,365
Werner Schultz.

244
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,502
<i>Shit doesn't even
start to explain.</i>

245
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,603
<i>He even owns prisons
in the Middle East.</i>

246
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:21,540
<i>Schultz saw dollar signs
and wanted to expand,</i>

247
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:23,576
<i>so he partnered
with the Muslim Brotherhood.</i>

248
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:27,645
<i>The local terrorist organization
in some country called Jazeristan.</i>

249
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:32,151
Well, you know Schultz does build
prisons and pretty good ones.

250
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:36,688
But terrorism? Well,
that's a bit of a stretch.

251
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:38,991
Yeah, you'd think
until Schultz realized

252
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:41,393
that he had a bargaining chip
in one of his cells.

253
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:44,964
Yeah. A hard-partying Arab
by the name of Jason Quick.

254
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:47,765
<i>They got him
for everything.</i>

255
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,936
<i>Drugs, possession,
weapon solicitation you name it.</i>

256
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:53,705
I am back, bitches!

257
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:55,773
<i>Schultz just up
and let him go.</i>

258
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,781
Turns out that Jason Quick is actually
Jasim bin something or something.

259
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:06,018
One of the top dogs
of Muslim Brotherhood's son.

260
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:09,622
And when Schultz released him,
it granted him favor with this man.

261
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:14,692
Abu Hirawa.
Real name is Am-jam...

262
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:18,631
What he had to say.

263
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:22,067
For all intents and purposes,
Bin Laden's successor.

264
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:27,339
So... ...Schultz
is in bed with this guy.

265
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,478
In bed, under the covers with some KY
Jelly doing all kinds of freaky shit.

266
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:35,780
- Why are you telling me?
- 'Cause you're a thief.

267
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:40,286
Let me stop you right there.
Yes, I'm a thief...

268
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:44,822
but I only steal from upstanding
citizens who pay insurance.

269
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:47,626
Nobody gets hurt.
Particularly me.

270
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,996
Besides... I only work alone.

271
00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:57,269
And if that changes, and it won't...
none of you will make the cut.

272
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:04,176
There's millions of dollars worth
of gold in one of those locations.

273
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:12,117
I like gold.

274
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:16,622
Terrorism generates
a lot of cash, kidnappings,

275
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:19,692
drugs, oil, theft,
but it's all dirty.

276
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:22,561
It's traceable. In order
to launder the money...

277
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,297
- Gold.
- Oh yeah. Gold.

278
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:29,134
Hidden in a place that no one
wants to dare step foot in,

279
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:30,903
unless they're forced to.

280
00:23:39,078 --> 00:23:39,979
A prison?

281
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:42,814
Oh, not just any old prison.
Your boy Schultz's prison.

282
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:45,817
We're goin' in.
You want to join us?

283
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,024
You want me to go
into a Middle Eastern country,

284
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:55,861
one that you've been explaining
for an ungodly amount of time,

285
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:58,864
that is filled with terrorists,
to steal their gold.

286
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:01,567
- Yeah.
- That's exactly what we want you to do.

287
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:05,204
In other words, something good,
for once.

288
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:15,681
Oh, that's rich. That's rich.

289
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:20,052
Let me see...
...how do I put this, I got it.

290
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:21,687
Nope.

291
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:23,722
And if it makes
you feel any better,

292
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,992
I'm pretty sure every
one of you is insane.

293
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,194
Especially this dude
sitting over here.

294
00:24:29,528 --> 00:24:33,465
Excuse me. We on descent.
Please fasten your seatbelts. Thanks.

295
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:39,038
You know, I guess I should
have asked this sooner,

296
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:40,973
descent to where?

297
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:43,842
To Abu Dhabi.

298
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:47,279
Abu Dhabi.

299
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:52,651
Hey man, Schultz's new besties,

300
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:56,889
the dudes in the grey suits,
Muslim Brotherhood.

301
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,591
They'll try to kill
you again, you know.

302
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,129
You change your mind,
there's a card in your left breast pocket.

303
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:08,000
- Call us.
- Arrivederci.

304
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,077
My, my, would you look at this?

305
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:21,447
Taxi?

306
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,454
Whoa.

307
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:31,223
Let's roll.

308
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:48,774
Why don't you take me to the best
five star hotel in... Abu Dhabi?

309
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:53,112
- I know just the place.
- Good man.

310
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:57,015
- First time here?
- Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is.

311
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:58,384
- You know what?
- What?

312
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:01,420
- I think I'm gonna like it here.
- Yeah, you will.

313
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:16,094
Hey there. Give us your best
single malt whiskey. Two ice cubes.

314
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,065
It's a good-looking watch.

315
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:26,338
Leon LaFleur Magnifique. 769
working parts,

316
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:31,577
each one created by a single craftsman
at an atelier in Switzerland.

317
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:35,849
I believe, only four of them
ever made in the world.

318
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:37,683
Huh. Impressive.

319
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:42,554
Wonder how this
wallet got down here?

320
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:45,959
Sorry.
Huh. Your wallet.

321
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:47,526
No, it's not.

322
00:27:48,227 --> 00:27:51,363
And I rather drink alone.
I actually insist on it.

323
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:54,399
Okay, fair play.

324
00:27:56,235 --> 00:28:00,672
All right. <i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>
Good luck to yourself.

325
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:09,248
Sorry.

326
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:17,489
Hi, gin and tonic, please.

327
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:27,232
I don't believe it.

328
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:31,938
Oh, excuse me.
I think you dropped this.

329
00:28:32,104 --> 00:28:35,942
Oh, thank you so much.
What a pleasure meeting you.

330
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,242
- Yes, you too.
- Where are you from?

331
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:40,512
- I'm from the states. Um, I travel...
- Ma'am.

332
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,315
I believe you
dropped your pocketbook.

333
00:28:43,582 --> 00:28:45,684
Thank you. You know what?
That is so funny.

334
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:48,253
- I literally just picked that up in the gift shop.
- I bet you did.

335
00:28:48,387 --> 00:28:52,892
But you know, you must be more careful the
world is rife with thieves and cutpurses.

336
00:28:53,091 --> 00:28:56,094
Don't I know it. Which is why I
bought the cheapest one I could...

337
00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:59,765
and keep my real one...
close to me heart.

338
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:03,502
Is there anything else you
keep close to your heart?

339
00:29:04,102 --> 00:29:07,372
Let me see, um...
the trials of the poor,

340
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:11,143
the downtrodden, tribulations
of the world's oppressed.

341
00:29:11,743 --> 00:29:13,980
Otherwise, no, not a thing.

342
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:15,747
Sounds like a lonely existence.

343
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:18,717
No, actually,
it's quite fulfilling and lacks little.

344
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:21,186
Sometimes...

345
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:25,090
things are missing in our lives
and we don't even know it.

346
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:29,062
Things tend to stay missing if
you don't actually look for them.

347
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:33,098
If you don't mind,
the lady and I were having a conversation.

348
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:34,533
Really now, that's very funny

349
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,903
because I thought you prefer
to drink alone.

350
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:39,538
In fact, if I recall,
you insisted.

351
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:44,610
Go. Find your own.
This one is mine.

352
00:29:44,776 --> 00:29:48,180
- Huh! What did you say?
- She's my new friend.

353
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:50,950
Really?

354
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,621
That's very interesting because actually...
she's my daughter.

355
00:29:56,555 --> 00:29:59,124
And I don't know you, friend.

356
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:07,967
The gentleman, he had
to run away there,

357
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:11,703
but he said for his drinks,
our drinks on his room. Thank you so much.

358
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,976
That was a very
swift move back there.

359
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:19,578
Yeah. Well, I had
quite the teacher.

360
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:25,484
It's good to see you, Hope.
It really is.

361
00:30:25,918 --> 00:30:27,219
You too, Dad.

362
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:30,689
So, how'd you end up
in Abu Dhabi?

363
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:35,293
Same way I ended up in prison.
Against my will.

364
00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:36,728
And you?

365
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,698
I'm... I'm here to meet
some philanthropist.

366
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:43,268
We're talking through new,
innovative ways to help the refugee crisis.

367
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:44,871
- That's good. Impressive.
- Yeah, it is.

368
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:49,207
And when I was in the hotel lobby,
I saw another crisis developing.

369
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:52,544
- Well, old habits.
- Yeah.

370
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:56,515
Hey, listen.

371
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:02,220
- Let's go for a walk, shall we? It's been a while.
- Yeah, okay.

372
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,757
Maybe on second thoughts...

373
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:08,995
- Very nice.
- Pay the bill here...

374
00:31:09,194 --> 00:31:11,864
Here you go.
Keep the change.

375
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:21,473
Have you seen your mother?

376
00:31:22,774 --> 00:31:24,242
She's my mom, so, yeah.

377
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:28,480
- How is she?
- Yeah, she's fine.

378
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:30,850
- Re-married.
- Hmm.

379
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:35,320
- Took her a long time, but she got over it.
- That's good.

380
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,621
Yeah.

381
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:38,057
That's really good.

382
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:41,861
How about you, how're you doing?
You... married yet?

383
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,797
No, I'm not married.
I, uh...

384
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:47,799
I have trouble trusting men.

385
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:50,769
Daddy issues.

386
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,775
Look, Hope, I know this
sounds like a cliche,

387
00:31:56,943 --> 00:32:00,179
but I did it for you and it was
the right thing to do at the time.

388
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:02,581
Why? Because you're
just so wrong?

389
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:07,452
Yeah.

390
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:08,754
It was.

391
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:12,424
You know what the sad thing, I mean the
real tragedy of this whole thing is?

392
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:14,894
You actually believe that.

393
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:18,463
But I know deep down,
under all that

394
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:21,767
urbane panache and capricious
thievery, you're good.

395
00:32:24,137 --> 00:32:25,838
Just gotta find that person.

396
00:32:30,442 --> 00:32:32,410
Yeah, well that's
easier said than done.

397
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,683
Perhaps, I could steal him.

398
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:48,828
I have to go. I'm sorry.
I have to go prepare for this meeting.

399
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:49,896
Okay.

400
00:32:51,797 --> 00:32:54,432
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, it's good to see you too, Dad.

401
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:56,601
- Bye.
- Bye.

402
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:28,287
Okay. I'm in.

403
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:32,258
But if I do this,
and this comes off,

404
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:35,261
it's because of what
I bring to the table.

405
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:39,031
I'm in charge.
What I say goes, no exceptions.

406
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:42,101
- We can live with that.
- It's why we picked you.

407
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:48,573
And the split? Tch. Not even,
not five ways. 50/50 boom, boom.

408
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:52,979
- Split of what?
- The money. The gold.

409
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:57,183
- There won't be any.
- What do you mean there won't be any,

410
00:35:57,249 --> 00:36:00,019
I thought that was the point
of the story. Steal the gold.

411
00:36:00,252 --> 00:36:03,889
It is. But that doesn't mean
they'll be any gold to split.

412
00:36:04,023 --> 00:36:06,558
- Well, why the hell not?
- Because it's not about us.

413
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:09,028
It's about preventing that gold
from financing terrorism.

414
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:13,899
Right, I get that. Steal
their gold, stop the terrorists.

415
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,501
To the victor goes the spoils.

416
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:18,603
There are no victors, Pace.

417
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:21,273
We're never going to be able
to stop the Muslim Brotherhood,

418
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:24,110
but we can try and stop
one bomb from going off.

419
00:36:24,176 --> 00:36:27,645
We do what we do to help
others, never ourselves.

420
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:32,952
Oh my God,
here we go again.

421
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:38,190
If this weren't so amusing...
it would be sad.

422
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:41,626
Ciao.

423
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:47,033
Pace.

424
00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:51,904
Pace. Pace!

425
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:55,740
Look, I'm not sure how you
got hold of your information

426
00:36:56,275 --> 00:37:00,346
or who told you I might even have any
interest in this act of compassion,

427
00:37:00,578 --> 00:37:03,249
- but they were wrong.
- I did.

428
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,352
I told them.

429
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:11,823
I told you had a meeting about the
refugee crisis. This is that meaning.

430
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:13,259
Oh, for God's sake.

431
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:18,030
- Don't tell me they brought you in, too.
- No, I pulled them.

432
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:20,433
This is my idea.

433
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:23,502
Hope, listen to me,
if any of this is true,

434
00:37:23,802 --> 00:37:26,272
contact the embassy,
talk to a congressman.

435
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:27,440
We tried.

436
00:37:27,672 --> 00:37:29,707
Jazeristan is
an important US ally.

437
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:33,179
U.S. Centcom uses Al Udeid
Air Base to launch assaults

438
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:36,549
in the Middle East. America doesn't
need to ask too many questions,

439
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:39,684
and Jazeristan doesn't
need to find any answers.

440
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:43,621
Do they know about this?

441
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:46,225
They know, but they
don't know, you know?

442
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:53,966
Come on, darling,
what am I gonna do here?

443
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:57,136
This. I want you to do this.

444
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:03,675
Look, Dad,
we need you.

445
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:07,146
I need you.

446
00:38:09,048 --> 00:38:12,784
Just this once, I'm asking
you not to walk out the door.

447
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:21,560
I must need my head examined.

448
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:25,564
Yeah, I feel like I should mention
something about Abu Hirawa.

449
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:28,300
I mean it's kind of his gold
we're after.

450
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:30,970
In Arabic,
Hirawa means cane.

451
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,994
And that was this gardener.

452
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:58,696
Oh well.
That's good to know.

453
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:03,502
Prison. Hard to get into,
even harder to get out of.

454
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:05,371
Especially with
a truckload of gold.

455
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:08,541
First question.
Where's the gold?

456
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:11,776
We got a couple of contacts on the
inside so we know the lay of the land,

457
00:39:11,877 --> 00:39:13,212
but we still don't know
where the vault is.

458
00:39:13,379 --> 00:39:15,314
Do you have surveillance
photos on this facility?

459
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:17,249
Yeah, we have. Come, I show you.

460
00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:21,420
Facility is state-of-the-art,
one of the most modern prisons on Earth.

461
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:24,590
And it's completely self-contained...
food, water, everything.

462
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:26,225
Wait. Go back.

463
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,996
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Left.

464
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:33,299
If the prison's self-sustained,

465
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:36,936
I would expect there's a fully
functioning laundry on the inside.

466
00:39:37,036 --> 00:39:40,439
Yeah. Right next to the kitchen.
Using the same venting system.

467
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:42,408
That's the steam in the photo.

468
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:45,144
Mm. Right, but it doesn't,
does it, really?

469
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:47,246
Because while my Arabic
is little bit rusty,

470
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:50,815
I'm pretty sure...
that's a laundry truck.

471
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:53,652
Meaning Schultz built the prison
without installing

472
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:55,354
an actual industrial laundry.

473
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:58,390
Just a system to generate
steam for appearances.

474
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:01,293
And built a vault instead.

475
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:03,896
Voila! Now we know
where the gold is.

476
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:07,099
- Right under the shitter.
- Let's go to prison, shall we?

477
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:12,504
Oh, and by the way,
I only fly first class.

478
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:15,074
- Me too!
- Oh-ho, congratulations.

479
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:17,910
Next time we'll be sure to book
your ticket on Princess Air.

480
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:19,411
Mm-hm. What do you
mean, next time?

481
00:40:19,612 --> 00:40:21,647
This entire region
is on high alert.

482
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:25,584
A group like this, landing at the
airport will attract attention.

483
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:27,553
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
point remains the same.

484
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,989
Trains, planes, automobiles.

485
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:33,825
I'm flexible...
as long as it's first class.

486
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:40,366
Hmm?

487
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,003
Why isn't anyone
saying anything?

488
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:50,009
Please, tell me you're joking!

489
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:53,746
We got to fit in.
Vehicles will be scrutinized.

490
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:55,881
Camels. Muhammad
will be our guide.

491
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:58,851
- Which one is Muhammad?
- All of them.

492
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:00,785
- Oh.
- My Muhammad.

493
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:04,456
There's about 30 miles of virgin
desert to the border of Jazeristan.

494
00:41:04,623 --> 00:41:05,624
Well..

495
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:08,894
this prison isn't going
to rob itself. Let's go.

496
00:41:09,061 --> 00:41:12,298
- By the way, you look great.
- Thank you. Don't be cheeky.

497
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:15,501
Which camel's mine. Can I get this guy?
He looks friendly.

498
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:31,150
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a desert like this?

499
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:33,552
Believe me, I'm not so nice.

500
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,889
They didn't ask me to join because
of my pleasant disposition.

501
00:41:37,022 --> 00:41:39,291
So it's not because
you couldn't find a date.

502
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,263
No, I'm very good
at finding dates.

503
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:46,398
Even better at losing them.

504
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:49,768
You might want to change
your line of work.

505
00:41:50,436 --> 00:41:54,073
- Could increase your odds.
- Says the thief.

506
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:58,344
No, I decided a long time ago

507
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,145
that if I can't be good
to someone,

508
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:02,881
I can at least try
and be good to everyone.

509
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,984
Good philosophy.

510
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:29,508
You know...

511
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,413
They say that people
on their deathbeds...

512
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:37,483
never regret
the things they did,

513
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:41,220
just... the things
they didn't do.

514
00:42:42,154 --> 00:42:45,257
This sounds like the start of
a conversation you may regret.

515
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:49,595
We're going to do something
very dangerous here soon.

516
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:52,931
If there's some
kind of connection, well...

517
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:55,667
It would be a shame
if we die

518
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:58,003
without
really saying our feelings.

519
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:03,108
Did you ever think saying how you
feel might be the reason you die?

520
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:07,212
Nope. Never crossed my mind.

521
00:43:09,982 --> 00:43:10,983
It's not you, Pace,

522
00:43:11,316 --> 00:43:13,585
from an empirical point of view,

523
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:15,621
you are a very attractive man.

524
00:43:17,891 --> 00:43:20,492
You see I don't... date men.

525
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:23,996
I kill them.

526
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:40,245
One can only try.

527
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:09,475
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:44:15,347 --> 00:44:16,448
You okay?

529
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:19,451
Yeah, I'm fine.

530
00:44:22,988 --> 00:44:25,557
- Just a little scared.
- Yeah.

531
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:29,661
Well, it certainly
will have its risks.

532
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:32,531
Uh, I don't mean the prison.

533
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:36,168
Dad, you're doing this
for the right reasons, right?

534
00:44:36,668 --> 00:44:41,573
I mean... you're not going to do
like you always do and...

535
00:44:42,074 --> 00:44:43,609
disappear in the final frame?

536
00:44:46,678 --> 00:44:47,713
Do you mean...

537
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:51,617
- The gold?
- No.

538
00:44:55,087 --> 00:44:58,023
I mean... disappear without me.

539
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:03,662
Oh, Hope...

540
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:09,234
I really would like to promise
you that, I really would.

541
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:16,408
There's a beautiful line
I once read in a poem.

542
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:21,346
"A man travels far to find out
who he really is."

543
00:45:23,615 --> 00:45:25,250
Same goes for you.

544
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:29,321
Hold steady.

545
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,493
Hold steady.

546
00:45:49,308 --> 00:45:52,077
Get some rest.
It's a big day tomorrow.

547
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:22,041
- We'll be fine here.
- Why can't I stay with my dad?

548
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:26,712
It's too risky. We don't want them to be
able to kill two birds with one stone.

549
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,883
- That's comforting.
- Really?

550
00:46:31,216 --> 00:46:33,385
No. It was a joke.

551
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,988
Hm.

552
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,189
Well, we usually don't
like to work with people

553
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:38,925
who have families
and loved ones.

554
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:43,195
Brings emotions into play.
And emotions cloud the mind.

555
00:46:48,968 --> 00:46:50,003
What are you doing?

556
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:52,304
You never know when you have
to improvise on weapons.

557
00:47:00,278 --> 00:47:02,280
All right.

558
00:47:04,316 --> 00:47:05,517
What do you want to do?

559
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:08,620
Hmm. What kind of drugs
do you have?

560
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:10,990
I don't drink or take drugs.

561
00:47:11,156 --> 00:47:12,992
Really? Maybe you should start.

562
00:47:13,258 --> 00:47:15,028
Just a little something
to take the edge off.

563
00:47:15,394 --> 00:47:17,096
If you want,
I could go score some.

564
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:19,264
Absolutely not,
that's dangerous.

565
00:47:19,698 --> 00:47:20,699
I was joking.

566
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:23,903
God, you really don't have
a sense of humor, do you?

567
00:47:24,202 --> 00:47:25,337
Don't really have time for it.

568
00:47:25,737 --> 00:47:27,739
Not much about what I do
is very funny.

569
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:32,845
Me neither.

570
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:42,754
You know what? Let's focus on
what we love about our work.

571
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:46,425
Okay. I like to beat people up.

572
00:47:47,994 --> 00:47:49,695
Okay, cool. Yeah.

573
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:56,002
Well, let's say I am a guy
and I'm coming at you.

574
00:47:56,368 --> 00:47:57,769
- A dumb guy.
- Right. Okay.

575
00:47:57,837 --> 00:47:59,872
But I have a bunch of friends
waiting to back me up. So,

576
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:02,674
you gotta take me down in one move.
What's your go-to?

577
00:48:02,942 --> 00:48:04,309
- One shot?
- Yeah, that's it.

578
00:48:04,576 --> 00:48:06,179
Easy. Punch to the throat.

579
00:48:06,344 --> 00:48:07,612
- Not the jewels?
- No.

580
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:10,582
Men vary in size and sensitivity
when it comes to their junk.

581
00:48:10,749 --> 00:48:13,485
What may bring one to his knees
might bring another one pleasure,

582
00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:15,654
but a solid punch
the Adam's apple.

583
00:48:16,722 --> 00:48:17,723
Down in a oner.

584
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:19,992
- Cool.
- Hmm!

585
00:48:21,194 --> 00:48:22,862
You must have one badass dad.

586
00:48:24,097 --> 00:48:25,464
Never knew him.

587
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:28,800
I'm sorry.

588
00:48:29,434 --> 00:48:31,570
Yeah, well, me too.

589
00:48:33,672 --> 00:48:37,743
Well, I for one,
would like to thank him.

590
00:48:38,077 --> 00:48:40,746
If he hadn't abandoned you
and made you hate men so much,

591
00:48:40,947 --> 00:48:42,481
you wouldn't taken up my fight.

592
00:48:45,218 --> 00:48:46,685
That's one way to look at it.

593
00:48:47,753 --> 00:48:49,554
You're lucky to have
a dad like yours.

594
00:48:49,956 --> 00:48:51,289
He loves you a lot.

595
00:48:52,257 --> 00:48:53,558
Yeah, I guess so.

596
00:48:55,161 --> 00:48:56,428
Still an asshole though.

597
00:48:59,264 --> 00:49:00,799
Yeah, he is.

598
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:03,970
Here.

599
00:49:05,604 --> 00:49:07,773
- I thought you didn't drink.
- I don't.

600
00:49:09,307 --> 00:49:12,611
Let's cheers to dads.
The good... and the bad.

601
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:24,190
All right, ladies
and gentlemen pucker up.

602
00:49:24,389 --> 00:49:26,825
Time to move, Ringo,
don't lose interest.

603
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:31,130
Up you get. Gather round,
ladies and gentlemen.

604
00:49:31,463 --> 00:49:32,999
Okay, take a seat.

605
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:37,270
The problem with gold is,
well, it's heavy.

606
00:49:37,435 --> 00:49:38,603
So we're gonna need a vehicle

607
00:49:38,703 --> 00:49:40,273
that can handle
that kind of weight.

608
00:49:40,338 --> 00:49:41,339
On it.

609
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:43,009
And to get it out
of the country,

610
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:44,911
camels aren't gonna cut it.

611
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,013
So, we're going to need
some kind of transport.

612
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,115
- I can.
- You can what?

613
00:49:49,414 --> 00:49:51,616
Some kind of transport,
my country can provide it.

614
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:54,020
Princey-poo claims
that he's royalty

615
00:49:54,086 --> 00:49:55,487
in a "country" in the Gulf.

616
00:49:55,654 --> 00:49:56,989
I thought you said
you weren't a prince.

617
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:01,160
I said I wasn't that prince
but I'm a prince in my country.

618
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,230
What country?
You ain't got no country.

619
00:50:05,198 --> 00:50:07,399
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Ringo.

620
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:09,467
By the way,
just off the topic here.

621
00:50:10,002 --> 00:50:10,870
Is that your given name?

622
00:50:11,137 --> 00:50:15,373
Yeah, given by me. In honor
of the greatest Beatle.

623
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,409
- Here we go again.
- What you mean here we go again?

624
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:18,978
What, a black man
can't like the Beatles?

625
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:21,613
See, he's a true visionary
with his instrument.

626
00:50:21,981 --> 00:50:24,649
You guys don't understand.
He was the first rock and roll drummer...

627
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:26,651
influenced every
rock drummer after him.

628
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:29,654
- Even the way that he held his sticks.
- Seriously?

629
00:50:30,589 --> 00:50:32,024
I don't joke about Ringo.

630
00:50:33,092 --> 00:50:35,962
It's better just to accept it
and don't karaoke with him.

631
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:41,934
You suck, you suck!

632
00:50:43,568 --> 00:50:46,873
<i>How you gonna say "Yellow
Submarine" ain't a real Beatles song?</i>

633
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:49,208
I'm just saying
he's an unappreciated singer.

634
00:50:49,275 --> 00:50:52,245
I'm so glad I asked.
Ringo, we're gonna need a list

635
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:54,947
of all the outside
prison contractors.

636
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:55,848
No doubt.

637
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:58,516
And you certainly can't
be drilling or tumbling.

638
00:50:58,617 --> 00:51:00,219
We're going to have
to blow the vault.

639
00:51:00,286 --> 00:51:01,653
Hope, you've had experience

640
00:51:01,786 --> 00:51:03,990
with phone boxes in
the Peace Corps, is that right?

641
00:51:04,156 --> 00:51:05,657
- Yeah?
- I need that skill set.

642
00:51:05,925 --> 00:51:08,693
And anything else I taught you
at a very inappropriate age.

643
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:11,063
Violet, we need to find
out where Schultz is

644
00:51:11,197 --> 00:51:13,232
when he isn't at the prison.
We need surveillance.

645
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:16,401
Already on it. And it looks like
you guys better grab your robes.

646
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:19,537
Schultz has a lunch
reservation in 45 minutes.

647
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:21,340
All right handsome, let's go.

648
00:51:21,606 --> 00:51:23,175
That's what I'm talking about!

649
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:30,082
Welcome, sir.

650
00:51:41,294 --> 00:51:44,030
There it is.
Watch that case.

651
00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:50,468
- You see how heavy that was?
- Like a fat lady.

652
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:53,505
Looks like Schultz
is making a withdrawal

653
00:51:53,605 --> 00:51:55,875
for our friend Abu Hirawa.

654
00:51:57,143 --> 00:51:58,177
<i>We have to stop him.</i>

655
00:51:58,878 --> 00:52:01,113
I'm sorry, Hope,
you can't win them all.

656
00:52:01,414 --> 00:52:05,384
We don't know who this guy is and by
now, he's just in the wind.

657
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:06,785
Jason Quick.

658
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:09,654
Jason Quick? He looks good.

659
00:52:10,522 --> 00:52:14,160
He got the drugs out of his system
and he put the jihad back in.

660
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,627
That other guy in the photo,

661
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,964
it's the Vice President
of the Bank of Jazeristan.

662
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,531
He's trading
the gold for cash.

663
00:52:19,698 --> 00:52:21,400
Yeah, and the bank
opens tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

664
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,669
After that, Jason boards
an afternoon flight...

665
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,473
at which point
he will be "in the wind."

666
00:52:30,742 --> 00:52:32,211
What you got there?
What are you reading?

667
00:52:32,711 --> 00:52:36,614
- I picked these up at the souk.
- Okay.

668
00:52:37,183 --> 00:52:40,019
- What?
- Nothing.

669
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,773
I gave your man gold,
it's not my fault he's a thief.

670
00:53:34,974 --> 00:53:36,775
- Was.
- I'm sorry?

671
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:38,978
<i>Was a thief. Except that...</i>

672
00:53:39,278 --> 00:53:42,348
- He wasn't.
- I'm sorry, I'm not following.

673
00:53:42,614 --> 00:53:46,352
On the journey from is to
was, all men tell the truth.

674
00:53:46,684 --> 00:53:50,322
<i>A man's eyes cannot lie.
Not to me.</i>

675
00:53:50,688 --> 00:53:52,925
Especially when
I hold them in my hand.

676
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:54,559
If I thought it was you,

677
00:53:54,692 --> 00:53:56,628
we would not be having
this conversation.

678
00:53:57,096 --> 00:54:00,099
Ah, right, well...
that's that then.

679
00:54:00,232 --> 00:54:03,035
If there's nothing else,
I've got a bit of company at the moment.

680
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:06,539
There is a very large
operation taking place in the near future,

681
00:54:06,671 --> 00:54:08,407
<i>but you may leave
your briefcase at home.</i>

682
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:11,911
<i>You need something much
larger for this transaction.</i>

683
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:15,147
Ah, right,
who's my contact this time?

684
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:17,649
- <i>Me.</i>
- You? Lovely.

685
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:20,219
- Three days.
- <i>All right, thanks.</i>

686
00:54:21,686 --> 00:54:23,222
Oh shit.

687
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:27,625
Agreed.

688
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:30,496
Hirawa's coming
here to get his gold.

689
00:54:31,564 --> 00:54:35,835
That's the bad news. The piss
in our punch bowl bad news...

690
00:54:36,535 --> 00:54:37,570
is this guy.

691
00:54:37,837 --> 00:54:39,972
Khairat Reda is
a London-based banker.

692
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:43,109
Top brass of the Brotherhood and
he arrives here in three days.

693
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:46,078
Hirawa is the finger puppet.
And this man is the hand.

694
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:48,514
So we accelerate the schedule.
Hit the prison before they get there.

695
00:54:48,613 --> 00:54:52,885
Uh-uh. We can't go into this thing
half-cocked. We're not ready.

696
00:54:53,486 --> 00:54:56,021
I'm ready. Are you ready?

697
00:54:58,491 --> 00:54:59,791
Huh! We are fully cock.

698
00:55:01,293 --> 00:55:04,330
- Cocked, not cock.
- Yes, cock.

699
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,299
Yes, cock for you,
no cock for me.

700
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,335
I need a drink.

701
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:14,206
Okay, here we go.

702
00:55:14,473 --> 00:55:17,709
The only way this operation
is gonna run smoothly

703
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:20,846
is if the prison
isn't running smoothly.

704
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,282
Fortunately, we got a few guys
on the inside.

705
00:55:24,383 --> 00:55:26,919
<i>And working in the place
where we have direct control</i>

706
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:29,588
over the prisoners'
physical well-being.

707
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:32,091
Any health issue that
needs more than ten beds...

708
00:55:34,326 --> 00:55:35,361
<i>Well...</i>

709
00:55:35,528 --> 00:55:37,695
We gotta get them out, now!

710
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:41,033
Let's just say they're going
to need more than that.

711
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,776
- And we walk out the front door.
- Well, maybe not.

712
00:55:52,677 --> 00:55:54,246
Let's play that one by ear,
shall we?

713
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:59,618
Abdullah, are you aware of how many
violations you have going on here?

714
00:55:59,751 --> 00:56:02,655
No, we just passed
inspection a few months ago.

715
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:07,860
Now, I'm asking, where are you buying
all of your refrigeration equipment from?

716
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,563
- Pacific Industries. Yes.
- They're still in business?

717
00:56:10,762 --> 00:56:12,331
Well, you need to get them
on the phone right away.

718
00:56:12,398 --> 00:56:15,434
We can get some new steamers
down here, get you up to code.

719
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:19,138
You're with the ministry
of Public Health, Mr., uh...

720
00:56:19,605 --> 00:56:22,675
- <i>Lionel L. Zagred?</i>
- <i>I am.</i>

721
00:56:22,774 --> 00:56:25,810
I have a friend there. Maybe I should
call him so I can sort this out.

722
00:56:25,945 --> 00:56:27,846
Are you aware of the GSO?

723
00:56:28,414 --> 00:56:31,350
<i>The Gulf Standard Organization.</i>

724
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:34,620
They're responsible for all
of the food development

725
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:36,788
and standards going on
here in the Gulf region.

726
00:56:36,956 --> 00:56:41,260
So you could only imagine how it'd
probably look if such a prized institution

727
00:56:41,427 --> 00:56:43,795
were to fail an inspection.

728
00:56:43,896 --> 00:56:46,764
Now, if you ask me personally,
Jazeristan shouldn't care

729
00:56:46,832 --> 00:56:48,667
about the opinions
of other countries, right?

730
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:50,402
So if you want... you want
to call your friend,

731
00:56:50,502 --> 00:56:54,006
- you get him on the horn, call them, right away!
- They're not friends.

732
00:56:54,173 --> 00:56:56,642
It won't be me that will be
upsetting the royal family.

733
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:59,178
<i>It's my friend's cousin,
and I don't even know him.</i>

734
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,681
<i>Pacific Industrial?</i>

735
00:57:02,747 --> 00:57:04,450
Would you happen to
have any of the...

736
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:07,486
Vanguard K2350.

737
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:11,190
Vanguard K2350 in stock, please?

738
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:15,394
You do? Great. I want two sent
as quickly as possible.

739
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:17,496
To the Dola Penal
Corrections Institute.

740
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:24,436
What do you mean you
don't have any at hand?

741
00:57:24,536 --> 00:57:26,605
You just literally two seconds
ago told me you had five.

742
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:28,674
This is not good.

743
00:57:29,008 --> 00:57:30,542
You do that!

744
00:57:31,277 --> 00:57:34,213
- What did they say?
- It seems they don't have any, at hand.

745
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,849
But they can rush order them to
us and have them to us in a week.

746
00:57:36,982 --> 00:57:39,018
Mm-Hmm!

747
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,022
Answer that phone, Abdullah.

748
00:57:44,356 --> 00:57:47,092
- Answer that.
- What if it's the royal family?

749
00:57:47,293 --> 00:57:48,327
Answer the phone.

750
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,170
Hello, sir. This is Pacific
Industrial here.

751
00:57:58,337 --> 00:58:02,141
I'd like to apologize for the
mix-up we had over here on our end.

752
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:06,811
<i>We do in fact have
the 2350 in stock.</i>

753
00:58:06,879 --> 00:58:09,715
<i>We had an unexpected
delivery cancellation.</i>

754
00:58:09,915 --> 00:58:13,452
In fact, one of our men
is in the field as we speak.

755
00:58:14,153 --> 00:58:16,355
Would tomorrow afternoon
be okay for you?

756
00:58:16,655 --> 00:58:20,326
That would be fantastic.
I can't thank you enough for this.

757
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:25,064
That's very kind of you, sir,
much appreciated, good day now.

758
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:28,534
Cup of coffee?

759
00:59:09,308 --> 00:59:12,411
All right. We go in
after lunch tomorrow.

760
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:15,814
Hey, Violet, couldn't have
found a small worker?

761
00:59:16,081 --> 00:59:19,752
No, it just so happened that the biggest
lush at the company was also very large.

762
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:23,322
- Is this blood on here?
- Good luck.

763
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:24,656
Violet!

764
00:59:29,995 --> 00:59:33,132
But I do need you to fill out a little
bit more information right here.

765
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:36,001
- But they haven't been cleared!
- Abdullah, focus!

766
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:38,537
- For your family.
- Oh yes, I'll get them cleared.

767
00:59:38,604 --> 00:59:41,140
- Sign. Sign. Right away.
- Please, yes, yes. Watch your step.

768
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:10,669
Whoa, whoa.

769
01:00:10,904 --> 01:00:13,972
Dude, you have anger issues.

770
01:00:14,139 --> 01:00:16,341
Started from childhood.
Come on.

771
01:00:21,346 --> 01:00:23,449
That ought to do it, let's go
check on their progress.

772
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:25,751
No, they will handle it.
They will let us know.

773
01:00:25,818 --> 01:00:28,153
I'm a soon-to-be captain,
you cannot keep treating me like this!

774
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,421
Let's go check
on their progress.

775
01:00:29,555 --> 01:00:32,090
Okay, Abdullah, you're
so angry, let's go.

776
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,401
Age before beauty.

777
01:00:42,668 --> 01:00:46,271
All these new steamers,
this has worked out famously!

778
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:51,109
Abdullah, K2350.

779
01:00:51,477 --> 01:00:53,779
They look the same.

780
01:00:54,313 --> 01:00:56,850
But how closely
have you examined?

781
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,984
- Not so much.
- Exactly.

782
01:00:59,418 --> 01:01:04,356
See, same chassis?
Internal component entirely different.

783
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,231
No.

784
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:18,303
What are you doing?
You have to break-in first.

785
01:01:19,004 --> 01:01:20,038
Right?

786
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:24,576
I mean... They are your steamers,
if you want to turn on,

787
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:26,980
you break, you buy,
you own the steamers!

788
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,114
No, no, I don't,
the royal family does.

789
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:32,584
- When can we use them?
- Eh... an hour or two.

790
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:35,687
Give the internal
component time to break in.

791
01:01:36,255 --> 01:01:38,290
I love that you
listen to me now.

792
01:01:38,423 --> 01:01:40,158
This is like we
build a relationship.

793
01:01:40,292 --> 01:01:43,095
I feel like I must hug. I hug.

794
01:01:43,863 --> 01:01:45,330
I'm... I'm sorry.

795
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:48,534
Part of my culture.
I'm... I'm European.

796
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,369
- You're European.
- Yes.

797
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:54,473
- Finnish. From... from Finland.
- Oh.

798
01:01:54,606 --> 01:01:58,644
We big on hugs. We are,
big hug. I love to hug.

799
01:01:58,912 --> 01:02:02,982
Oh yes, yes, yes...

800
01:02:03,148 --> 01:02:05,117
Oh yes, now I have one more
thing for you to do.

801
01:02:05,384 --> 01:02:08,353
For you to sign and then
I'm out of your hair, I finish!

802
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:16,695
Okay.

803
01:02:27,339 --> 01:02:28,373
Wow.

804
01:02:36,315 --> 01:02:38,317
Seemed like a good idea
a few days ago.

805
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,819
This is going to take
a bloody miracle.

806
01:02:42,087 --> 01:02:43,121
Indeed.

807
01:02:43,755 --> 01:02:47,092
Let's go. We've got
a busy morning ahead.

808
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:03,675
Bon Appetit.

809
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:05,777
Born up a tree.

810
01:03:43,116 --> 01:03:47,152
It's amazing the bacteria you can
find at a local university, huh?

811
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:49,454
They really should protect it
better, you know that.

812
01:03:49,655 --> 01:03:51,790
I hope there's
no harmful side effects.

813
01:03:52,424 --> 01:03:53,893
Sure, there shouldn't be those.

814
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,139
Get these people
to the infirmary immediately!

815
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:09,174
And for God sakes,
have someone clean this up. Now!

816
01:04:23,188 --> 01:04:24,756
- Well?
- We're not sure, sir.

817
01:04:24,924 --> 01:04:27,693
But a large number of prisoners
and staff start showing

818
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:31,831
some sign of poisoning,
acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.

819
01:04:32,031 --> 01:04:33,900
It could be
some sort of overdose.

820
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,435
So...

821
01:04:37,436 --> 01:04:40,639
All this is just a little
bit of bad weed?

822
01:04:41,606 --> 01:04:43,742
Should we, maybe,
call in the National Police?

823
01:04:45,845 --> 01:04:47,013
Are you high?

824
01:04:47,779 --> 01:04:51,550
Yes, sir... I mean no, sir.
That would be bad idea.

825
01:04:57,857 --> 01:05:01,460
Check every flight, hotel,
and taxi company. Find Pace.

826
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:13,472
<i>Sick or ill prisoners</i>

827
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:16,274
<i>please report to the infirmary
immediately,</i>

828
01:05:16,341 --> 01:05:19,411
<i>I repeat all sick
or ill prisoners.</i>

829
01:05:19,478 --> 01:05:22,414
<i>Please report to
the infirmary immediately.</i>

830
01:05:35,128 --> 01:05:36,361
Okay.

831
01:05:39,832 --> 01:05:42,267
- Steady, hold it.
- What?

832
01:05:43,802 --> 01:05:45,704
Oh come on, man,
it's not an autopsy.

833
01:06:04,422 --> 01:06:05,791
Let's go.

834
01:06:16,701 --> 01:06:20,672
- My calculation... due south.
- By my calculation...

835
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:25,744
Yep.

836
01:06:43,863 --> 01:06:48,633
Hammed Al-Zagreb, Office
of Poison and Noxious Gases.

837
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,003
Mm.

838
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:54,040
Who said anything
about noxious gases?

839
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:56,309
Nobody, yet.

840
01:06:56,808 --> 01:07:02,081
See I have to test every patient
and the source of contamination.

841
01:07:03,316 --> 01:07:06,085
Could be something
with simple explanation,

842
01:07:06,351 --> 01:07:09,421
or something much,
much more serious.

843
01:07:09,788 --> 01:07:12,624
As I said, will not be
able to determine that

844
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:14,726
until I properly
assess the situation.

845
01:07:15,061 --> 01:07:19,232
We're going to need
a Hazmat cleanup immediately.

846
01:07:19,397 --> 01:07:23,836
- I... I don't...
- Then, uh...

847
01:07:24,971 --> 01:07:27,706
...you do not want it
to become international crisis.

848
01:07:28,107 --> 01:07:31,911
No, no, no, no, no we don't.
W... what did you say you need?

849
01:07:32,211 --> 01:07:35,380
- Hazmat.
- Hazmat, in Arabic, who died?

850
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,285
Not Arabic "hazmat."
Hazmat! Hazmat!

851
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:41,854
Ah, Hazmat. Okay, okay.

852
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:44,756
I understand, yes, okay.
How many you want?

853
01:07:45,057 --> 01:07:47,860
- You know what? I will handle.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

854
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:19,025
You serious?

855
01:08:19,392 --> 01:08:21,994
With explosives?
I'm always serious.

856
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:23,628
How are we doing on time?

857
01:08:24,596 --> 01:08:25,630
Running out of it.

858
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:28,733
How in the hell are we going to
get explosives down that tiny hole?

859
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:33,973
We're not.
We're building the Hindenburg.

860
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:45,418
Hi. I have been looking for you.
I need to show you something

861
01:08:45,517 --> 01:08:47,420
this way, it's extremely
important and dangerous.

862
01:08:47,652 --> 01:08:48,888
<i>So, where to?</i>

863
01:08:49,454 --> 01:08:52,124
The El Amadi hospital,
emergency protocol, sir.

864
01:08:53,025 --> 01:08:57,562
Right, so...
half of the prison population

865
01:08:57,662 --> 01:09:00,333
are being taken
outside the prison?

866
01:09:00,532 --> 01:09:05,470
At least half, yes, but the hospital
has cleared open a wing for us.

867
01:09:05,905 --> 01:09:08,573
They'll be under 24-hour guard.
It's all under control, sir.

868
01:09:08,673 --> 01:09:10,809
All right. Sounds like Pace.

869
01:09:16,514 --> 01:09:20,785
Come on Wick. <i>Allez, allez.</i>
Talk to me.

870
01:09:21,786 --> 01:09:23,588
All right, that
should be enough.

871
01:09:25,157 --> 01:09:27,193
- Good.
- Lighter.

872
01:09:30,429 --> 01:09:31,663
Time?

873
01:09:32,398 --> 01:09:33,798
Five seconds.

874
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:36,002
- Four.
- In that case...

875
01:09:36,601 --> 01:09:38,703
- Three, two, one. Come on.
- ...make Daddy proud.

876
01:09:39,105 --> 01:09:40,206
Whoa.

877
01:09:55,653 --> 01:09:58,723
Are you crazy?

878
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:03,429
Yeah, according to authorities,
and all standardized tests.

879
01:10:04,296 --> 01:10:07,266
- There was a car bomb, sir!
- Car bomb, my ass.

880
01:10:11,303 --> 01:10:13,738
Whoop! Damn!

881
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:16,108
Wow!

882
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,647
- Pace.
- What?

883
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:25,217
Okay. Do your thing.

884
01:10:25,683 --> 01:10:28,854
I got you.
I just get excited.

885
01:10:34,592 --> 01:10:36,862
- Okay, take a picture.
- Looking great.

886
01:10:37,063 --> 01:10:37,897
Come on.

887
01:10:37,963 --> 01:10:39,965
- Beautiful.
- Takes my breath away.

888
01:10:43,536 --> 01:10:45,137
Smile.

889
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:47,639
That's a beautiful picture.

890
01:10:47,739 --> 01:10:49,008
- Not ready?
- Hold on.

891
01:10:49,075 --> 01:10:51,143
Come on, tick-tock, tick-tock.

892
01:11:00,752 --> 01:11:03,255
- Show me the vault.
- One moment, sir.

893
01:11:08,027 --> 01:11:11,729
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Got it!

894
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:13,631
There, sir.

895
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:21,073
- Looks all right to me.
- It looks good, sir.

896
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:23,943
All right.

897
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:26,378
Right.

898
01:11:28,848 --> 01:11:31,150
- Hang on a second, zoom in.
- Let me see.

899
01:11:36,555 --> 01:11:38,190
It seems frozen, sir.

900
01:11:40,692 --> 01:11:41,961
All right.

901
01:11:49,468 --> 01:11:50,836
Oh, bollocks.

902
01:11:53,638 --> 01:11:54,706
Total lockdown.

903
01:11:55,074 --> 01:11:57,109
Sir, we can't,
we possibly can't.

904
01:11:57,309 --> 01:11:59,545
<i>The prison is now
under lockdown.</i>

905
01:11:59,677 --> 01:12:02,647
<i>I repeat, the prison
is now under lockdown...</i>

906
01:12:20,432 --> 01:12:21,666
It's in the gurneys.

907
01:12:26,872 --> 01:12:28,340
<i>Allez, allez.</i> Oop!

908
01:12:44,857 --> 01:12:47,560
- You have to stop those ambulances.
- You have to step back.

909
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:53,765
Good news or bad news?

910
01:12:54,366 --> 01:12:57,002
Is Pace's daughter
good enough for you, Schultz?

911
01:12:57,469 --> 01:12:58,703
Oh.

912
01:12:59,572 --> 01:13:01,974
Lovely.
Keep her alive for an hour.

913
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,076
Thanks.

914
01:13:14,486 --> 01:13:15,487
Go, go, go!

915
01:13:15,955 --> 01:13:18,424
Check everything
in the ambulance. Find the gold.

916
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:20,326
Follow me.

917
01:13:22,695 --> 01:13:23,929
Clear.

918
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:31,070
Nothing in here.

919
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:34,039
Please don't shoot!

920
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,382
<i>We didn't find
anything, sir.</i>

921
01:13:55,461 --> 01:13:56,828
Oi.

922
01:13:58,097 --> 01:13:58,931
And you are?

923
01:13:59,164 --> 01:14:02,668
- Hazardous waste cleanup.
- What hazardous waste?

924
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:04,769
Look man, we're just
trying to do our job.

925
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:06,672
If you have any issues
talk to our boss.

926
01:14:06,972 --> 01:14:08,073
Eh, where's your boss?

927
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:10,976
Yeah, that's a crazy thing.
We have all this work to do

928
01:14:11,043 --> 01:14:14,546
and they're stacking up crates?
Pretty heavy, too.

929
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:19,752
There they go.

930
01:14:28,694 --> 01:14:31,830
Sir, we just got word,
Abu Hirawa has arrived for his gold.

931
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:35,100
Oh, don't worry about this. We won't
lose them. We've got men on every road.

932
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,436
Thanks for the thought of that,
but what have we got off road?

933
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:38,837
Sir?

934
01:14:42,508 --> 01:14:43,842
You know what?

935
01:14:44,076 --> 01:14:45,844
I like see what
you 'bout to do.

936
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:48,347
Mm-hm. Safety first.

937
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:53,152
Be driving this thing,
Prince, aight?

938
01:14:55,587 --> 01:14:59,325
Ay, look, okay, I get it.
You drive, you control the music.

939
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:01,427
I'm with that,
but we gotta do something

940
01:15:01,493 --> 01:15:04,029
about the two double
Darth Haters back there.

941
01:15:04,263 --> 01:15:06,565
Just...
I can't take it.

942
01:15:06,799 --> 01:15:10,035
Jus'
I need music, come on.

943
01:15:13,739 --> 01:15:15,974
Yeah.

944
01:15:17,609 --> 01:15:18,977
That's your shit, right?

945
01:15:19,878 --> 01:15:21,113
Yeah!

946
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:26,585
Do that shit! Yeah!
Let's go baby!

947
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:32,991
Yeah, baby.

948
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:42,534
Whoa! Shit!

949
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:47,373
Go, go, go, go!

950
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:50,409
Woo!

951
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:53,445
This ain't the road.
I'm wit' it though.

952
01:15:53,712 --> 01:15:56,048
Oh shit, let's do it!

953
01:15:58,817 --> 01:16:00,219
Ah, our reinforcements.

954
01:16:03,055 --> 01:16:04,289
Hello, friends!

955
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:24,910
Now it's a party,
turn that shit up! Whoo!

956
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:27,646
Woo-hoo

957
01:16:35,954 --> 01:16:38,257
You like that wild shit.
Let's go!

958
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,362
I'm not scared.
I ain't scared at all.

959
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,231
Brakes!

960
01:16:50,502 --> 01:16:51,603
Whoa!

961
01:16:52,438 --> 01:16:53,639
Oh, shi...

962
01:16:54,273 --> 01:16:56,308
Oh!

963
01:16:58,110 --> 01:16:59,945
Y'all all right back there?

964
01:17:01,013 --> 01:17:02,614
We good. We good?

965
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:15,294
Woo. Let's go. Come on,
we the Misfits, baby.

966
01:17:15,394 --> 01:17:17,931
Gonna mis-fit my foot
in your ass, yeah!

967
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,076
- Now!
- Now? Yeah!

968
01:17:32,211 --> 01:17:33,545
Oh shit!

969
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:44,189
Whoa!
Shit!

970
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:47,927
Golden showers, baby!

971
01:17:48,928 --> 01:17:52,397
You don't even know what that means.
You're nasty, man. Golden showers.

972
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:56,268
Go, go!

973
01:18:12,017 --> 01:18:13,485
Hello.

974
01:18:13,552 --> 01:18:16,088
<i>So here's where we're at.
None of us were armed.</i>

975
01:18:16,355 --> 01:18:18,423
<i>We wanted Schultz to think
he had the upper hand.</i>

976
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:20,626
<i>Plus we ain't want
to get shot at.</i>

977
01:18:21,026 --> 01:18:22,227
Hello.

978
01:18:32,839 --> 01:18:36,542
<i>It's about now that Schultz
realized he didn't really catch us.</i>

979
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:38,443
Fabulous.

980
01:18:42,314 --> 01:18:45,018
<i>Hold up, pay attention
to those white cars.</i>

981
01:18:45,317 --> 01:18:47,319
<i>How would anyone know
where we were gonna be</i>

982
01:18:47,386 --> 01:18:49,454
<i>before the chase even began?</i>

983
01:18:49,788 --> 01:18:51,723
<i>It's called an anonymous tip.</i>

984
01:18:51,925 --> 01:18:56,295
<i>We wanted to get caught
because we had a story to tell.</i>

985
01:19:36,535 --> 01:19:37,937
So, it's still in the prison,
then?

986
01:19:38,203 --> 01:19:39,471
Not exactly.

987
01:19:49,949 --> 01:19:51,216
Stop. What are you moving?

988
01:19:51,316 --> 01:19:54,620
We got a, uh, we got
a repair order right here.

989
01:19:55,654 --> 01:19:56,688
Here you go.

990
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:00,826
Right there.

991
01:20:04,129 --> 01:20:05,731
Still going to have
to take a look at it.

992
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:12,204
You betcha. Here you go.

993
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,340
Look at that.

994
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:17,175
See?

995
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:19,378
Dingdong.

996
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:22,748
I heard some
inmate damaged it.

997
01:20:22,949 --> 01:20:24,716
- Oh, yeah.
- Crazy bastard.

998
01:20:24,984 --> 01:20:27,586
- Crazy...
- The bullocks, huh?

999
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:30,689
- Mutt's nuts. Okay, have a good day.
- Yeah, yeah.

1000
01:20:42,401 --> 01:20:44,003
Put the gun down!

1001
01:20:44,403 --> 01:20:45,537
<i>I know
what you're thinking.</i>

1002
01:20:45,838 --> 01:20:48,141
<i>Who the hell are these dudes
and where did they come from?</i>

1003
01:20:48,573 --> 01:20:50,809
<i>Check it, Prince told us
he'd have his soldiers</i>

1004
01:20:50,943 --> 01:20:53,779
<i>just hiding and waiting for
Schultz to brandish a weapon.</i>

1005
01:20:53,913 --> 01:20:56,481
<i>And then these guys rolled up
dressed like extras</i>

1006
01:20:56,581 --> 01:20:59,052
<i>in a bad
Salvadorian action movie.</i>

1007
01:20:59,118 --> 01:21:01,720
<i>No way in hell
these are real soldiers.</i>

1008
01:21:01,954 --> 01:21:02,955
<i>But I played along.</i>

1009
01:21:03,588 --> 01:21:08,293
You can't be brandishing a weapon
around a foreign military aircraft,

1010
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,195
especially from
a sovereign nation of, uh...

1011
01:21:10,328 --> 01:21:12,031
- Salwa.
- Salwa.

1012
01:21:12,297 --> 01:21:13,933
- Your country.
- My country.

1013
01:21:14,266 --> 01:21:17,469
Just... just... just a sec,
just a sec.

1014
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:20,338
Get it done, yes.

1015
01:21:23,976 --> 01:21:27,713
Looks like your daddy dearest didn't
come through for you today, ho'.

1016
01:21:33,086 --> 01:21:34,386
Finish her off.

1017
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:38,757
Reservation's
under Hope Pace.

1018
01:21:40,592 --> 01:21:42,594
I've been waiting
for that call.

1019
01:22:28,273 --> 01:22:30,009
Fucking men.

1020
01:22:30,143 --> 01:22:31,343
Well, that's that then.

1021
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,848
We haven't been introduced.
I'm Hope.

1022
01:22:36,548 --> 01:22:40,019
<i>That punch was the least painful
thing that happened to Schultz that day.</i>

1023
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:42,955
<i>Inside of one of those
white cars I pointed out?</i>

1024
01:22:43,722 --> 01:22:44,991
<i>Was Abu Hirawa.</i>

1025
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:50,629
Not my fault.

1026
01:22:51,696 --> 01:22:54,066
It's okay. I believe you.

1027
01:22:56,035 --> 01:22:58,470
But there are those who are
not interested in the truth...

1028
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:02,607
Only in justice.
It won't come swiftly.

1029
01:23:07,013 --> 01:23:09,215
<i>The next day, some
talking head reported</i>

1030
01:23:09,314 --> 01:23:10,950
<i>the food poisoning
at the prison.</i>

1031
01:23:11,184 --> 01:23:13,986
<i>There was no mention
of any gold.</i>

1032
01:23:14,253 --> 01:23:15,453
<i>Like I said,</i>

1033
01:23:15,687 --> 01:23:19,058
<i>you're gonna rob a bank
make sure it ain't reported.</i>

1034
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:47,086
Leave any of them alive?

1035
01:23:47,153 --> 01:23:48,955
- Of course not.
- Good.

1036
01:23:54,492 --> 01:23:58,763
- Where's my dad?
- Sh... I don't know, he had to drive the truck here.

1037
01:24:02,034 --> 01:24:05,972
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no what? We got it. This is good news.

1038
01:24:06,172 --> 01:24:08,074
- No.
- He's around here somewhere.

1039
01:24:08,174 --> 01:24:09,075
No.

1040
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:12,510
I have a terrible
feeling he's not.

1041
01:24:20,452 --> 01:24:21,786
Oh, my God.

1042
01:24:23,256 --> 01:24:24,623
It's the original.

1043
01:24:26,758 --> 01:24:28,895
- Where's the gold?
- He took it.

1044
01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:31,364
And he's not coming back.

1045
01:24:31,496 --> 01:24:35,067
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, this can't be.

1046
01:24:35,167 --> 01:24:37,303
No, it can be,
it can so easily be.

1047
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:40,472
Shit, I am so, so sorry.
I'm the one who vouched for him.

1048
01:24:40,538 --> 01:24:41,740
I brought him into
this whole thing.

1049
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:44,409
After a lifetime of disappointment,
I should have known better...

1050
01:24:46,345 --> 01:24:47,646
Far better.

1051
01:25:08,868 --> 01:25:09,869
Dad?

1052
01:25:11,404 --> 01:25:12,671
Yes.

1053
01:25:14,673 --> 01:25:16,108
You stole the gold.

1054
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:20,445
I did.

1055
01:25:21,247 --> 01:25:22,781
From us?

1056
01:25:24,716 --> 01:25:25,517
Yep.

1057
01:25:25,817 --> 01:25:27,752
Then what the hell
you still doing here?

1058
01:25:28,586 --> 01:25:31,891
Hopefully... fixing things.

1059
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:37,229
I cleaned it up a little.

1060
01:25:39,832 --> 01:25:40,900
Oh.

1061
01:25:42,634 --> 01:25:43,869
Thank you.

1062
01:25:44,303 --> 01:25:46,504
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1063
01:25:50,443 --> 01:25:51,710
Uh, guys...

1064
01:25:52,111 --> 01:25:53,379
Shh...

1065
01:25:53,678 --> 01:25:55,547
What are you shushing me,
we got stuff to do.

1066
01:25:56,282 --> 01:25:58,884
You know what, this is
cute moment and everything

1067
01:25:58,985 --> 01:26:02,388
but we got a whole Sal,
big Sal... Sal-wa?

1068
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,521
Salwan.

1069
01:26:03,722 --> 01:26:06,624
Salwan cargo plane
revved up and ready to go.

1070
01:26:06,791 --> 01:26:09,929
Well, let's get the hell
out of Dodge. Grab the bird.

1071
01:26:10,196 --> 01:26:12,064
- My man.
- Yes.

1072
01:26:17,736 --> 01:26:19,972
<i>So, we grabbed the bird
and got the hell out of Dodge</i>

1073
01:26:20,072 --> 01:26:21,874
<i>on Prince's country's
cargo plane.</i>

1074
01:26:22,774 --> 01:26:25,077
<i>Having a cargo plane
almost made me believe</i>

1075
01:26:25,144 --> 01:26:26,811
<i>he was actually a prince.</i>

1076
01:26:27,246 --> 01:26:29,781
<i>I said almost.</i>

1077
01:26:30,983 --> 01:26:32,817
- Yo Ringo! Got your drink.
- Hey!

1078
01:26:32,918 --> 01:26:34,887
- Prince, for you.
- Thank you.

1079
01:26:35,354 --> 01:26:38,556
Hey, you all got umbrellas
where the hell is my umbrella?

1080
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:40,525
I want an umbrella,
what type of shit is this?

1081
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,763
This is the life. I mean,
this is always my life.

1082
01:26:44,864 --> 01:26:47,565
Man, I can't believe
you're actually a prince.

1083
01:26:47,665 --> 01:26:48,767
I mean, in the animal world,

1084
01:26:48,868 --> 01:26:50,903
your parents would have
left you. Or eaten you.

1085
01:26:51,003 --> 01:26:54,073
Mm. A little training,
some skintight leather,

1086
01:26:54,373 --> 01:26:56,108
I could see myself
being a Misfit.

1087
01:26:57,476 --> 01:26:59,111
Don't even think about it.

1088
01:27:00,146 --> 01:27:02,747
I'd like to start by
getting to know you again...

1089
01:27:03,315 --> 01:27:04,483
in my retirement.

1090
01:27:04,749 --> 01:27:07,186
Or maybe we can get to know
each other without retiring.

1091
01:27:09,587 --> 01:27:12,291
Yeah, Dad. What do you say?
Are you a Misfit?

1092
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:19,231
No, actually, I think...

1093
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,236
I think I fit in just fine.

1094
01:27:24,736 --> 01:27:26,906
Here's to us, guys.

1095
01:27:27,506 --> 01:27:28,974
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1096
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:32,011
- Cheers guys. Bottoms up.
- Cheers.
