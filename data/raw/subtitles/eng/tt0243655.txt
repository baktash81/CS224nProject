1
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:59,469
# Can't you see it's all over #

2
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:02,222
# For you and me, girl #

3
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:10,230
# There's a time for love and a
time for letting me be, baby

4
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:17,362
# Jane, you're playing
a game called #

5
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:21,456
# How hard you get by
its real name #

6
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:27,247
# Making believe that you
just don't feel the same #

7
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:30,367
# Ah, Jane #

8
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,289
Guys, we gotta get outta here.

9
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,571
You guys aren't supposed
to be out of your bunks.

10
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:43,573
You're in trouble.

11
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:52,699
Wake up!

12
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,335
# Standing in the
rain with his head hung low #

13
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,803
# Couldn't get a ticket
it was a sold-out show #

14
00:02:57,838 --> 00:03:01,591
# Heard the roar of the crowd
he could picture the scene #

15
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:05,595
# Put his head to the wall and like a
distant scream # - I'm up!

16
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,964
# He heard one guitar #

17
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:09,966
# It just blew him away #

18
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,472
You guys!

19
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:19,476
Let's go, girls!
You look hot.

20
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:23,980
The bunk 5 boys are gonna freak out
when they see you at kick ball. Let's go.

21
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:40,130
Ow!

22
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:54,644
All right, let's go.

23
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:10,527
Good morning, everybody.

24
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:12,744
Well, it's the last day of camp...

25
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:15,782
and it will be sad to shut down
WCFW for the summer.

26
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:19,286
But not to worry, because those of you in
the Bethesda/Chevy Chase area...

27
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:24,291
Can hear me all winter long on Jewish Day
School Radio 89.9 F.M...

28
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,293
"The Fox."

29
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:29,261
For those select few of you
who went all summer,

30
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:32,299
all eight weeks without finding
that special someone,

31
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:35,267
today is your day, 'cause you
don't wanna go back home...

32
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:38,805
and lie to your friends about a summer
romance that didn't even happen.

33
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:41,273
And you don't want to be
the one person...

34
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:45,312
who doesn't have anyone to kiss tonight
after the talent show.

35
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:49,065
So, seize the day, Camp Firewood,
because it's your last.

36
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:30,857
Coop, do you like watching
me and Andy make out?

37
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:35,327
No. What a weird thing to say.

38
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:38,865
- You look so sexy in this sweatshirt.
- Uh-huh.

39
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,832
- Your ass is so hot.
- Stop it!

40
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,119
- Do you want to be my boyfriend?
- No.

41
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,623
I get it. It's very funny. Stop.

42
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:52,629
Oh, Coop, you know I'm just kidding.

43
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:55,632
I know, and it's very, very funny.

44
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,600
Okay. I'm sorry.

45
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:02,103
- Want me to make it up to you?
- No, you've done enough already.

46
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:06,392
- I'm gonna find you a woman today.
- Honestly, don't worry about it.

47
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:10,612
No. And I'm not gonna rest until
my mission is accomplished, okay?

48
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:16,286
Okay. then I'll cancel that
order of onions and Limburger
cheese I made for lunch today.

49
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:20,005
- Ha-ha.
- Yeah.

50
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,794
- I want you inside me.
- What?

51
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,414
Hey, what's up? I was just...

52
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,049
from before.

53
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,639
Coop, were you just talking to Katie?
What was that?

54
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:42,178
That was, bar none, the
longest conversation I've had
with her in six years of camp.

55
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:45,181
Does she want to fuck me? Is that
what she was asking you about?

56
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:47,649
Because, tell her that I will. In fact...

57
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:50,151
no, don't tell her that I will.
Tell her that I might.

58
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:52,689
Victor, I hate to break it to you,
but your name didn't even come up.

59
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,656
She definitely wants to fuck me.

60
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:57,694
Why else would she be talking to you?

61
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:00,196
- No offense.
- None taken.

62
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:04,834
Hello. Hi.

63
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:07,419
- Uh, hi.
- Hi. I'm Beth.

64
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:09,456
Nice to meet you. I'm Henry.

65
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,342
I've been seeing you around, so I thought
I'd take a chance...

66
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:14,961
and introduce myself.

67
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:25,855
- Thank you.
- So...

68
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:30,226
So, you work at the camp?

69
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,362
- I'm the camp director.
How about yourself? - Me?

70
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:35,548
- I don't work over there.
- No, I know.

71
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,234
I'm the director. I would know...

72
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:40,870
- if you were...
- Right. You would know that.

73
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:46,242
I teach astrophysics over at the
college in the school year.

74
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:48,745
And I came here this summer
just to, you know,

75
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:50,747
relax and reflect.

76
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:54,000
Wow! You're a professor.
What do you teach?

77
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,503
Well, like I said before, astrophysics.

78
00:07:57,003 --> 00:08:02,008
I study space, stars, comets
and that kind of thing.

79
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:04,845
"Space...
the final frontier."

80
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,647
Right. Thanks for everything.

81
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:10,865
Hey! You know what?
It would be a great idea...

82
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,772
if you came by the camp and
taught the campers about space.

83
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,658
- No, I couldn't...
- They'd love it.

84
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,660
No, I couldn't possibly.

85
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,663
- It would be just...
- I said no!

86
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,782
Sorry. that was...

87
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:43,264
Oh, Coop. Look at Abby.

88
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,301
Oh, she wants to fuck me.
So help me God.

89
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:47,769
She wants to fuck me.

90
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:49,806
And this time, Victor, I'm sure it's true.

91
00:08:50,306 --> 00:08:54,811
I have to admit. Abby Bernstein
is one of the only berry bushes...

92
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:57,278
that I have yet to pollinate,
if you get my meaning.

93
00:08:57,313 --> 00:09:00,316
You mean, she's the only girl at camp
you haven't done it with yet?

94
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:02,283
That's exactly what I mean.

95
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:04,821
Hey, Gene. Any mashed potatoes?

96
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,828
Gary! Bring out the taters!

97
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,797
Here they are. Hey, Gary.

98
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:18,334
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Hey, guys.

99
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:21,302
What'd you say, shithead?

100
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:24,806
I said, "hey, guys."
What's your glitz, Gene?

101
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:28,344
Listen to me, you fucked-up little
cigarette-smoking piece of shit.

102
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,847
I was in the Vietnam war.

103
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:33,314
- I know.
- Oh, yeah.

104
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:37,353
The 'Nam.

105
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:39,489
Excuse me, ladies. You
may remember me...

106
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:43,993
as the guy who came to dinner a few
weeks ago with underwear on my head.

107
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,077
My name is Keith Stack.

108
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:50,116
From Millburn, New Jersey.
State bird: The Mosquito.

109
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,253
And as you may have heard,
I am recently...

110
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:56,721
a crowned class-b Dungeon Master.

111
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:59,259
So if any of you would like
to play "D & D" today,

112
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:03,263
please speak now or
forever hold your peace.

113
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:06,981
Anyone?

114
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:10,852
Alexa, maybe you'd like to join in?

115
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,890
We do need a druid, and
you have definitely cast...

116
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:16,410
a level-five charm spell on me.

117
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,895
In your dreams, douche bag.

118
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:22,398
Douche bags are hygienic products.
I take that as a compliment.

119
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:25,652
- Thank you.
- Ewww! Ewww!

120
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:39,165
Well, we made it to the end
of the summer in one piece,

121
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,168
Except for a few campers who are lepers.

122
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:44,170
Good one, Beth.

123
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,675
Thank you, Gene.

124
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,935
Excuse me. Could you tell me where
I could find the, uh...

125
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:03,940
How do I put this?
The, uh, sci-fi,

126
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:06,943
nerdy, indoor kids?

127
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:09,946
- Bunk 3.
- Oh, yeah. thanks.

128
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:17,954
Hey, guys.

129
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:20,957
I'm associate Professor Neumann.

130
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:23,960
Who'd like to spend the last day at camp
doing science projects?

131
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:29,716
Okay, okay. Okay, cool.

132
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,975
I've seen more fucked-up shit happen
in five minutes out there...

133
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,442
than you'll see in your whole fucking life.

134
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:45,231
Gene, I'm really sorry, you know.
If I could change history, I would.

135
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:48,985
Fuck you! We need to make eight gallons
of bug juice by snack hour.

136
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,988
Do you know where
the powder packets are?

137
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:55,992
In the pantry over the sink, right
next to my bottle of dick cream!

138
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:57,994
Wait.

139
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:00,997
Ignore that last comment.

140
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:02,999
- Did you say dick cream?
- No.

141
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,501
I said stick team.

142
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:08,504
You know, stickball? Forget about it.
Go away! Leave me alone.

143
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:13,009
I'm pretty sure he said
dick cream, but...

144
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:15,511
Victor.

145
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:19,515
I need you and Neil to take The Eagles out
on Moose river. I made them a promise.

146
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:22,518
It's the last day of camp.
It's not gonna work for me.

147
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:24,485
- It's not gonna work for you?
- No.

148
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,157
It's not gonna work for you. Okay,
how about this as a compromise?

149
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:31,428
The Eagles are going to
go out on Moose river...

150
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:34,664
- and you and Neil are
going to take them. - What?

151
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:37,632
Everybody focus up. All eyes here.

152
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,670
I would like to announce that
Ben and I are planning to
produce a musical number...

153
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:43,940
from godspell for the talent show tonight.

154
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:47,141
I'm sorry. Ben is producing, I am
directing/choreographing.

155
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:50,179
I'm speaking from personal experience,
but if you can't carry a tune...

156
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:52,647
don't come to the audition
and waste our time.

157
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:55,184
- We're serious.
- And bring a lot of movement clothes,

158
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:59,188
A.K.A. jazz shoes,
dance belts, lycras, et al.

159
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:01,155
and seriously, F.Y.I., you guys,

160
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,193
this is not an excuse to get out
of your regular activities.

161
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:07,196
This is an excuse to do
some good musical theater.

162
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:09,664
So, be prepared, be enthusiastic...

163
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,202
and leave your bullshit
attitude and baggage at the
door, 'cause we don't need it!

164
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:15,204
Hey, you guys!

165
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:20,076
Oh, I was thinking maybe
we could take a walk later,

166
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:23,079
maybe go out to Gunner's Pass
one last time.

167
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,047
Goddamn it, Katie! You're suffocating me!

168
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:28,049
I'm chokin', all right?
Give me some breathing room.

169
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:32,088
I just want to spend some time with you.
It's our last day at camp.

170
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:35,358
- My butt itches.
- What are you talking about?

171
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:38,559
- We're soul mates, right?
- What? Yeah.

172
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:42,598
Whatever, if you want.
J.J., save me a waffle, man.

173
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:45,066
Andy, I'm serious. Come on.

174
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:48,604
I just want it to be special.
Fuck you, dyke!

175
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:52,108
- Why are you being such an asshole?
- I gotta finish my breakfast.

176
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:55,611
I love you, baby. So good talking to you.

177
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:00,116
Yeah, see you in macrame.

178
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:11,878
One last, successful B.K.F.S.T...

179
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:14,846
becomes one for the record books.

180
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:17,884
And with t-minus 11 hours
to the big talent show,

181
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,904
we sail on aboard
the good ship Firewood...

182
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,890
toward a little oasis
that I like to call...

183
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:27,358
morning activity time.

184
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:29,360
What's going on with Silas?

185
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:32,497
You didn't hear? He got kicked
out of camp. - Why?

186
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:36,402
He snuck into the office and videotaped
himself jerking off. - You're kidding!

187
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:38,154
- Where's the tape?
- He hid it.

188
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:43,659
- We gotta get that tape. - It's
a subject matter I'm sure
you're familiar with, McKinley.

189
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:45,441
- Shut up, J.J.
- You shut up.

190
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:47,342
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

191
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:01,561
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

192
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,064
And one, and one.
Step aside. Step aside.

193
00:15:17,944 --> 00:15:19,445
All right. Stop it!

194
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:25,701
Okay, kids. Um, today
we're going to use...

195
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:28,704
some crayons...

196
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:32,091
to make some decorations
for the talent show.

197
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:40,099
- Is that your wedding ring, Gail?
- Um, no.

198
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,728
I mean, yes, actually.
Yes, it is. It was.

199
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:46,856
It was. It used to be,
I mean, legally.

200
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:51,110
It's so twisted. His lawyer
won't even call me now.

201
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:54,614
- Where are the crayons?
- The crayons are...

202
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,483
the crayon is right there.

203
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:00,236
We could draw
with the markers.

204
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:03,239
Listen, Valerie,

205
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:05,706
I need you to be
helpful here, okay?

206
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:08,744
I do not need you
to undermine me, okay?

207
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:11,997
But there's only one crayon,
and it's brown.

208
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:14,750
There are literally hundreds
of colored markers.

209
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:30,516
Hey.

210
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:34,020
Going on your trip?

211
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:36,621
Yep.

212
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:39,158
Sucks dick we never got
to know each other.

213
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:41,410
Yeah.

214
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:43,279
You got a stick of gum, Victor?

215
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:45,781
I thought you'd never ask.

216
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:07,186
Abby! My trip...
it doesn't come back until tomorrow.

217
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,189
- Don't go.
- I can't, because Beth told me...

218
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,776
Let's go.

219
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:20,066
# Get ready get set, baby #
I'll be back tonight.

220
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,702
# Leaving tomorrow
so get ready #

221
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:27,206
# Get ready get set, baby #
Tonight.

222
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:29,173
Ah!

223
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:33,177
This is "The Beekeeper" here
on Camp Firewood radio.

224
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:37,833
I've got my drones working hard
on a breakfast time rock... Hey.

225
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:41,837
- Arty, I need you to take a shower.
- Okay.

226
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:45,341
Your parents are coming tomorrow.
I don't want to get in trouble.

227
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:48,344
- Sure. - You haven't taken a
shower once yet this summer.

228
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:52,348
- Fine. No problem.
- Arty, take a shower.

229
00:17:52,848 --> 00:17:54,850
You're covered in dirt.

230
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,852
Fine.

231
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:01,231
This is Arty Solomon here.

232
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:03,574
Alias, "The Beekeeper."

233
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:08,614
- You guys,
I'm really gonna miss this place. - Me too.

234
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:14,370
Hey, let's all promise that in ten years
from today we'll meet again...

235
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:16,122
and we'll see what kind of people
we've blossomed into.

236
00:18:16,157 --> 00:18:19,090
- Yeah!
- What time you wanna meet?

237
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,627
- You mean ten years from now?
- Yeah.

238
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:23,879
Let's meet in the morning
so we can make a day of it.

239
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:26,649
Okay, so what is it?
Is it like 9:00 or 9:30?

240
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:29,385
Let's say 9:00, that way
we can be here by 9:30.

241
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,736
Why don't we say 9:30,

242
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:34,273
and then make it your
beeswax to be here at 9:30?

243
00:18:34,774 --> 00:18:38,778
We're gonna be in our late
20's. I don't see any reason
we can't be places on time.

244
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:41,897
Okay, it's settled.
9:30 it is.

245
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:44,865
- All agreed?
- Agreed.

246
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,868
Great, 'cause I have
something at 11:00.

247
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:50,871
You've got a trapper keeper
full of appointments, right?

248
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:54,410
No, I have something at 11:00 that I can't
change 'cause I already moved it twice.

249
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:00,514
What are you looking at?

250
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:03,517
Is there a U.F.O. in the sky?

251
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:07,556
No, no. It's nothing
you need worry about...

252
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,562
Yet.

253
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,939
Andy? Are you
gonna clean that up?

254
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,407
Oh, yeah, I will.

255
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:29,910
Uh, I just got...
I don't have time now.

256
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:33,082
Clean it up and come
to my office for the meeting.

257
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:35,584
I gotta...

258
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,732
Damn!

259
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:29,889
- Gail, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

260
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:34,894
It's just that
my husband Ron...

261
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,414
You know...
no, he's my ex-husband.

262
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:39,899
I guess I have
to get used to that.

263
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:42,902
I have to get used
to saying ex, ex, ex.

264
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:46,620
He's my ex, ex-husband.

265
00:20:46,655 --> 00:20:51,160
You know, it's just
that I thought, like...

266
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,663
when Jonas and I separated,
I thought everything was lost.

267
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:56,380
And then I met Ron...

268
00:20:56,415 --> 00:21:01,921
and it just seemed like everything
was gonna work out, you know?

269
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:05,791
Keep going. We're with you.
I'm a total wreck! I don't even
know where the crayons are.

270
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,679
- I know, I know. Gail, listen to me.
- I'm a loser. What?

271
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:15,184
- Ron's who he is and you
can't change that. - I know.

272
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:17,151
Okay?

273
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:19,938
- Gail, listen to me. Look at me.
- I am.

274
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:22,691
Gail, look at me.
Gail, look at me.

275
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,194
I want you to say "okay."

276
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,697
- Why?
- I want you to say "okay."

277
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:33,667
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

278
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,955
I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank you all...

279
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,957
for making
the last eight weeks,

280
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:40,960
without rival, the best summer
of my entire life.

281
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:45,296
Okay, let's get to business.

282
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:48,334
Coop, the camp goat
took a shit in the infirmary.

283
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,836
- I need you to take care of that, please.
- That's impossible!

284
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:54,805
It is possible, and it happened...
on my shoes.

285
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,344
Abby, bunk 8 wants to watch The China
Syndrome again, so run the betamax.

286
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:01,812
- Again?
- What can I say? They love it. McKinley.

287
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:05,734
Four lower campers are stuck in the ropes
course. I meant to tell you yesterday.

288
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:09,104
Could you get to it now?
And last, but certainly not least,

289
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:11,991
tonight is the big talent show.

290
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:14,860
We have a lot of hard work ahead of us.
A few ground rules...

291
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:17,746
Hey. Hey!

292
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:21,250
I'm serious here.
I am not joking around.

293
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,254
I am not jok... I am not
Ruth Buzzi standing here.

294
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:28,123
I am no Ruth Buzzi standing here!

295
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:35,881
Steve? What you got there?

296
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:40,135
I have been programmed...

297
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,102
by my galactic master...

298
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:44,139
not to talk
to earth denizens...

299
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,394
of classifications J.J.
and McKinley-I-zoid.

300
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:56,285
- Your brother is such a freak.
- I know.

301
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,787
Katie, you're hot, right?

302
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:03,292
By all accounts, you would be considered
"hot." Is that correct?

303
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:05,294
Uh, I suppose so.

304
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:11,300
So if one wanted to be hot and make
a good impression, what would you wear?

305
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:13,802
You put on a clean pair of pants?

306
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:17,306
Beth, come on. Pants?
Are you kidding?

307
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:19,808
Yes. Pants.

308
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:21,775
Of course I'm kidding.

309
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,813
You didn't get I'm kidding?
Unless you're kidding.

310
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:29,318
'cause pants, Katie.
Come on, please. Pants.

311
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:31,820
So would you... slacks? Pants?

312
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:35,324
I don't know. I think I'd wear
a sexy dress or something.

313
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:37,826
That? Oh, you're good.
Sexy dress.

314
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:40,794
Okay. Uh, that's "a."

315
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:45,334
Um, what else... what else
would one do if one were...

316
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:48,302
I'd do my hair.
Oh, get out of town!

317
00:23:48,337 --> 00:23:52,341
I'm not getting out of town, and I'm
serious. And I'd use a little mousse.

318
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:56,345
Moose, as in...

319
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:59,598
No, as "mousse" for your hair.
Right! Right!

320
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:02,968
- Okay. Wait a minute, Beth. Are you...
- What?

321
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:05,220
Huh? What's up?

322
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:09,073
You dog! You have
a crush on somebody!

323
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:13,487
- I do have a crush. I just don't
believe he's interested. - What?

324
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:17,866
Beth, do not worry. Come with me
and I will mousse you up.

325
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:26,992
Hey, Andy, can I take out the
motorboat and drive around the lake?

326
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:30,996
- Sure.
- Wow! Thanks.

327
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:36,001
Just make sure you fill it up with gas
when you're done, and watch out...

328
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:38,003
Yeah, whatever.

329
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,013
Man, I'd give anything for two
minutes in the closet with Lindsay.

330
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:53,519
- What about Katie?
- Who?

331
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:56,021
Excellent.

332
00:25:08,784 --> 00:25:11,787
Hey. Whatcha writin' on?

333
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:13,754
My "gurnal."

334
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:16,291
I write my thoughts in it every day.

335
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:19,294
Oh, you mean a journal.

336
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,261
Yeah, whatever.

337
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:23,798
Guess I'm not all smart like you.

338
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,266
Can I see what you're writing?

339
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:30,806
Only three people are allowed to
look at this... Me, myself and I.

340
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:32,808
But I want you to share it with me.

341
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:37,813
Hey!

342
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:44,570
Let's see. Debbie Waxman?

343
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,574
No. she makes that weird piggy
face when she talks, you know?

344
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:52,578
Yeah. okay, good. No piggy face.

345
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,047
- Rachel Schwartz.
- No.

346
00:25:57,082 --> 00:26:00,085
- Come on, she's a slut. She'll go.
- I'll pass.

347
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,053
- Yeah, you're not really a slut type.
- Yes, I am.

348
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:07,092
I love sluts. Sluts rock.
It's just gotta be the right slut.

349
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,478
What about Susie?

350
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:14,314
Yeah. I could go for Susie.

351
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:16,601
She and I went out
my first summer here.

352
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:18,854
- When you were ten?
- Yeah, we were ten,

353
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:20,989
But we were into
some heavy shit.

354
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,108
Did you go all the way?

355
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:26,612
You bet we went all the way.
We went all the way back too.

356
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:29,079
We did doggy style, pony style.

357
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:33,001
Style council. That's a good band.
They're hot now. Human league.

358
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:35,469
They have some good stuff.

359
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:39,007
League of nations. That brings in
the whole thing of united nations.

360
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:41,760
That brings in the whole
category of countries.

361
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:45,229
Where to start?
Well, the obvious one.

362
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:49,768
The birthplace of spaghetti and
pasta, all the oily stuff... Italy.

363
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:52,521
- Now you go.
- Um...

364
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:56,024
- How about Italy?
- Yeah, good! It's safe.

365
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,027
I kind of paved the way
with that one, but...

366
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:04,032
What?

367
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,535
- What?
- Hey, guys.

368
00:27:08,153 --> 00:27:10,155
- Hi, Nancy.
- Hi, Katie.

369
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,157
Coop, goat shit.

370
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:21,800
Whoo-hoo! Ow!

371
00:27:30,926 --> 00:27:33,428
Andy! Help me!

372
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:35,564
- You french great.
- Andy!

373
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,068
- You're not so bad yourself, Mr. Man.
- Andy, help me!

374
00:27:40,103 --> 00:27:44,072
- I can't swim!
- Cut it out, bobby. You're fine.

375
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:47,442
For chrissake, Andy,
help me, I'm drowning.

376
00:27:53,198 --> 00:27:56,702
No, you can't hear the ocean, but you
can learn a great deal about our world.

377
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:01,331
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Beth.

378
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:04,424
Like the new look. Tres chic.

379
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:07,462
- Thank you, Henry.
- Please, call me Henry.

380
00:28:07,497 --> 00:28:09,464
Okay, Henry it is.

381
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:12,968
I see you decided to come
teach the campers, Henry.

382
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:15,971
Yeah. I'm sorry
I snapped at you before.

383
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:19,439
I'm a little shy around children.
But it's been great!

384
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:22,477
I've got them making miniature
black holes with paper clips and soot.

385
00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:25,445
What you do
is so fascinating!

386
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,484
- You really like astrophysics? - I love it!
It's my biggest hobby. I love it.

387
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,489
Really? Okay. Who's your
favorite astrophysicist?

388
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:37,993
My fav... I totally know this one.

389
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:39,995
Okay, any...

390
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:47,002
- What time is it?
- Um...

391
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:48,969
9:00, 9:30.

392
00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:53,008
I'm so late. I have to go
meet Jim... Stansel.

393
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:56,011
- You know Jim? He's that guy.
- Uh-huh.

394
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:59,514
- So I'll talk to you later. Okay?
- Okay.

395
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:02,517
Okay. Okay. Later, then.

396
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:10,158
Andy, have you seen
my swimming buddy?

397
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:12,125
Um...
if I can't find him,

398
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,663
I'm telling Beth
that you let him drown.

399
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:18,667
- I was busy. - It's your job to
make sure kids don't drown.

400
00:29:18,702 --> 00:29:20,669
Lindsay, I need like
20 minutes, all right?

401
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:23,672
Gotta talk to this kid.

402
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:26,174
Andy, where are we going?

403
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:28,176
To a big, secret pizza party.

404
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:31,046
Wow! Cool. I love pizza.

405
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:34,049
Yeah, well...

406
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:41,940
Nancy! Hello.

407
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:46,445
If I was looking for a book on
astrophysics, where would I find one?

408
00:29:46,812 --> 00:29:49,815
Off the top of my head,
I'd have to say a bookstore.

409
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:52,416
- Or a library.
- Right.

410
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:54,453
Just curious. Keep up the good work.

411
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:56,204
Okay.

412
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:01,291
Excuse me. Uh, Nancy.

413
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:03,712
Say I wanted to get a book on, um...

414
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,081
What?

415
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:10,085
- Camp directing, I guess. Would that be...
- Henry.

416
00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:12,838
Henry! Library.

417
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:17,409
Ooh. Thank you!

418
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:21,480
Beth! Beth!

419
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:24,983
If you're going into town, can you pick
me up something at the drugstore?

420
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,354
Beth, come on. My husband's coming
today and I need some lube.

421
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:31,356
For my pussy.

422
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,827
Oh, cool!

423
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:40,365
Beth's going into town.
Let's go! Wait, wait!

424
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:47,255
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

425
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:49,875
Come on, Coop!
Come on!

426
00:30:57,132 --> 00:30:58,633
Whoo!

427
00:30:59,134 --> 00:31:01,136
Whoo!

428
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,021
# Got a feeling tonight #

429
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:06,525
# Though her daddy's makin' trouble
it'll be all right #

430
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:09,242
# I'm working hard
I don't know why #

431
00:31:09,277 --> 00:31:12,781
# I'm like a working-class dog
and I just get by #

432
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:16,535
# Tonight I'm going out
for a minute #

433
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:21,656
# You know we're living
on the brink #

434
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:25,160
# Second by second
by minute by minute #

435
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,663
# Love is all right tonight #

436
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:42,561
# Love is all right #

437
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:48,433
# Love is all right #

438
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,435
# Tonight #

439
00:32:07,085 --> 00:32:09,087
Come on.

440
00:32:17,596 --> 00:32:20,348
# All right #

441
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:23,243
# It's gonna be all right #

442
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,192
# It's gonna be all right #

443
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:29,107
# It's gonna be all right #

444
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:34,863
# Love is all right tonight #

445
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:40,368
# Baby, we're gonna be
all right #

446
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:43,203
Hey, guys,
how was Waterville?

447
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:45,740
- It was really fun. - It's always fun
to get away from camp,

448
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:48,243
even for an hour.

449
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:52,497
Katie!
I'll see you later maybe?

450
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:55,250
Definitely.

451
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:00,388
Guys, wait up!

452
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:10,480
How far away
is this goddamn river?

453
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:14,019
It's at least two hours, Vic.
Try to forget about Abby.

454
00:33:14,054 --> 00:33:17,022
I can't, Neil, okay?
This is my only chance.

455
00:33:17,522 --> 00:33:19,024
What are you talking about?

456
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:22,027
I'm gonna tell you something, but I
swear to God, if you tell anybody...

457
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:25,780
- I swear to God!
- What? Wha...

458
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:31,786
- I'm a virgin.
- Wha...

459
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:34,754
You're joking.
Right, dude?

460
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:38,793
You're the stallion. You've had
like 50 or 60 women, so I mean...

461
00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:42,797
Actually, it's closer to... zero.

462
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:46,766
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

463
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:48,803
You're a loser.
You are a loser!

464
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:51,573
Oh, my God. Don't. I...

465
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:54,309
you're such a loser.

466
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:06,002
- What?
- What?

467
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:08,039
You listen to me,
Mr. Kickass.

468
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,507
Mr. Rubber Burner.

469
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:13,044
You wipe that hotshot grin off
your face or I'll shoot it off you.

470
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,547
You got that? Now finish up them taters.

471
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:18,299
- I'm gonna go fondle my sweaters.
- Come on. What?

472
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:20,517
- Finish up the taters.
- Then what did you say?

473
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:23,555
- Then what did I say? - You said you
were gonna go fondle your sweaters.

474
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:26,523
I... no, I didn't.

475
00:34:26,558 --> 00:34:28,525
I said I'm gonna
fondue with cheddar.

476
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,062
I was thinking about making fondue with
cheddar cheese for dinner tonight.

477
00:34:31,097 --> 00:34:35,183
- No, Gene, that is not what you said.
- It is what I said.

478
00:34:35,218 --> 00:34:37,685
Fondue with cheddar.

479
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,687
Okay, fine.

480
00:34:43,191 --> 00:34:45,326
Okay, see you later.

481
00:34:45,361 --> 00:34:48,294
See ya.

482
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:51,332
I'm just gonna stop by
my bunk for a real quick sec.

483
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:56,838
Maybe you should talk to him.

484
00:34:56,955 --> 00:35:01,960
So rabbi Rothstein says, "sim, sim,
sim, sim, ata..."

485
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,427
Hey, McKinley.

486
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:07,465
- Did you take that shower yet?
- Yeah, of course.

487
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,985
- Did you?
- No.

488
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,470
Take a shower.

489
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:17,976
Sorry, folks for the
"coitus interuptus," if you will.

490
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:20,577
I know you're all hungry
for the picnic,

491
00:35:20,612 --> 00:35:23,114
so don't eat too many
barbecued bovine muscles.

492
00:35:23,149 --> 00:35:25,617
Those being hamburgers.
Thank you.

493
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:32,874
Gail, if I could just
interject something here.

494
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:37,245
This is gonna sound like
I'm putting down my own gender,

495
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,499
but the truth is, a lot of the time
men can be real...

496
00:35:41,534 --> 00:35:44,502
and excuse the Yiddish...
insensitive schmucks.

497
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:47,255
- It's true.
- I know.

498
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:51,759
I know. It's just that
I'm 34 years old.

499
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:53,610
You know?

500
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:57,148
I'm just afraid I'm never
gonna meet anybody.

501
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:59,651
- Shh. Just breathe. Shh.
- It's so sad.

502
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:05,657
Breathe. Shh.
Just breathe.

503
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:08,427
Oh, God!

504
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:11,162
Your hands are magic.

505
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:14,282
- There you go.
- You, my friend, are a magician.

506
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:21,888
Okay!

507
00:36:21,923 --> 00:36:25,426
Everyone! Immediately!
Out of the van.

508
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:27,929
Get out of the van.
Out. Out.

509
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,932
- What are you doing?
- I'm going back to camp.

510
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:34,400
- I'll come back in the morning and
pick you up. - Wait a second.

511
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:38,690
- What, Neil? - Wait a minute.
You can't get there and back by sunup.

512
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,694
I am going to be with Abby
Bernstein tonight. And if you
don't like it, you know what?

513
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:46,197
You could just go ahead
and fuck yourself!

514
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:47,949
Hey!

515
00:36:51,703 --> 00:36:55,323
You're making a big mistake,
Victor Pulak.

516
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:57,575
A big mistake.

517
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:00,962
# Even though
we ain't got money #

518
00:37:00,997 --> 00:37:03,965
# I'm so in love
with you, honey #

519
00:37:04,082 --> 00:37:06,584
# And everything
will bring a chain #

520
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:09,587
# Of love, yeah #

521
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:12,590
# In the morning
when I rise #

522
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,592
# Bring a... #
Oh, God!

523
00:37:16,094 --> 00:37:17,595
Oh, shit!

524
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:21,099
Abby!

525
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:24,101
# In the morning when I rise #

526
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:26,854
# You bring a tear
of joy to my eyes #

527
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:31,824
Hey, Abby.

528
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:35,363
- I thought this was a different bunk.
- No.

529
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:37,999
- Am I bothering you?
- No, not at all.

530
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:41,002
You wanna come
sit on the bed?

531
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:04,490
# Even though
we ain't got money #

532
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:08,029
# I'm so in love with you, honey #
That sucks!

533
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:10,997
# And everything
will bring a chain #

534
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:15,036
# Of love # Wait for me, Abby
Bernstein. Wait for me, my darling.

535
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:18,039
# And in the morning when I rise #
Wait.

536
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:21,007
What? What?

537
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:23,044
I just want to take off my shirt.

538
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:27,799
- Where are we going?
- I don't know. Victor took the maps.

539
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:30,802
- Shut up and paddle.
- I want Victor back.

540
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:34,806
- We all want him back, Sammy, but he's
not coming back. - My name isn't Sammy.

541
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:38,309
We'll die without him. He's the only
one who can navigate the river.

542
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:40,812
Fine, you're right.
I'll find the son of a gun.

543
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:45,316
I'll bring him back here if it's the
last thing I do, dead or alive.

544
00:38:45,351 --> 00:38:47,068
Alive. We want him alive.

545
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:49,570
Okay. Wait here.

546
00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:58,579
Okay. Okay.

547
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,581
All right.

548
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:27,725
# I was born
to love I was born to dream #

549
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:30,728
# The kinkiest boy
you've ever seen #

550
00:39:30,763 --> 00:39:34,441
# I gotta do it my way #

551
00:39:34,476 --> 00:39:38,084
# Or no way at all #

552
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,622
# So why don't you
turn me loose #

553
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:44,841
# Turn me loose #

554
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:48,746
# I've gotta do it my way #

555
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,384
# I wanna fly #

556
00:40:04,512 --> 00:40:06,514
Ahh!

557
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:18,159
Oh, my God!

558
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:21,162
Look at
Lindsay's chicken wings.

559
00:40:21,662 --> 00:40:23,281
Debbie Epstein has,
like, playboy titties!

560
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:27,034
- It's just like klute! - Holy shit,
you guys! Look, look, look.

561
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:31,038
Bend over, yes. Take 'em off,
take 'em off. Yes! Yes!

562
00:40:31,073 --> 00:40:34,542
Guys, I'm gonna catch up
with you later, okay?

563
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:39,011
Dude, that's kind of sad.

564
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:42,550
He gets so uncomfortable whenever
we talk openly about sexual issues.

565
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:45,011
You know, he's never
been with a girl before.

566
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:47,438
McKinley needs
to experience the ultimate.

567
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:49,056
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

568
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:51,559
You mean penis in vagina?

569
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:54,026
No, dickhead. Sex.

570
00:40:54,061 --> 00:40:57,064
Oh, oh, oh.

571
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,702
They're total
nymphos! Throw the ball!

572
00:41:01,737 --> 00:41:04,170
Yes!

573
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:08,075
I'm sure we can convince one of the
girls from bunk 10 to boink McKinley.

574
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:11,043
They're really horny this summer.

575
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:13,714
Where did he go, anyway?
- I don't know.

576
00:41:14,215 --> 00:41:16,717
- Probably went to write his mommy
and daddy a letter. - What a fag!

577
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:19,720
- Who are we gonna set him up with?
- How about Debbie?

578
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:21,739
- No, she's got mono.
- Right.

579
00:41:21,774 --> 00:41:23,689
- How about Debbie?
- Who?

580
00:41:23,724 --> 00:41:27,728
- You know, Debbie Debbie.
- Oh, Debbie Debbie. No, she's his cousin.

581
00:41:27,763 --> 00:41:31,732
- How about tall Debbie?
- Too tall.

582
00:41:31,983 --> 00:41:35,486
How about Debbie
freeman? She's in heat!

583
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:38,990
- She wants to french. - No, you
shithead. She wants to get boned.

584
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:41,824
- Then I want her.
- You're being ridiculous.

585
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:44,362
I'm not being ridiculous!
I'm just saying I want her.

586
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:46,329
This isn't about you.
This is about McKinley.

587
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:50,368
Haven't you been listening to
what we've been saying? We're
trying to get our friend laid.

588
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:54,872
- Ah! point taken.
- Okay. Tonight...

589
00:41:55,373 --> 00:41:57,875
- Get McKinley laid.
- Come hell or high water?

590
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,842
Secret handshake?

591
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:02,380
Get McKinley laid!

592
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:26,287
As everybody knows,

593
00:42:26,787 --> 00:42:31,409
today is the big culminating,
climactic softball game...

594
00:42:31,444 --> 00:42:34,912
- against evil Camp Tiger Claw.
- Boo!

595
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:37,415
We have put together
an unlikely...

596
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:41,168
team of misfits, and we've been
training like crazy all summer.

597
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:44,171
Yeah, it's a motley crew
that you'd think...

598
00:42:44,672 --> 00:42:46,173
would never be able
to win a single game.

599
00:42:46,674 --> 00:42:49,677
We had a kooky training period
where it seemed like...

600
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:52,680
it seemed like nothing was
gonna go right. But, guys,

601
00:42:52,813 --> 00:42:54,780
somehow we made it
to the finals.

602
00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:59,186
So I say, when those anonymously
evil campers from Tiger Claw get here,

603
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:03,190
we give it our best shot, and we try to
come from behind at the last minute...

604
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:06,193
with some weird trick play that we
made up and we win the game.

605
00:43:06,228 --> 00:43:08,696
What do you say, team?

606
00:43:08,946 --> 00:43:10,448
It sounds like
well-worn territory.

607
00:43:10,948 --> 00:43:12,950
The whole thing feels kind of
trite. I say we forget it.

608
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,703
- Is that how everybody feels?
- Yeah.

609
00:43:15,738 --> 00:43:17,455
Well, it's fine with me.

610
00:43:28,966 --> 00:43:32,470
So listen, they just
aren't into it. It's kind of trite.

611
00:43:32,505 --> 00:43:34,972
Yeah, you're right. No problem, man.

612
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,975
It's sort of hackneyed. Tried
and done before.

613
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,977
See you later, man.

614
00:43:43,981 --> 00:43:46,484
It's no big deal.
they were totally cool.

615
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,486
Okay? All right.

616
00:43:55,242 --> 00:43:58,245
Susie is gonna score
with McKinley.

617
00:43:58,746 --> 00:44:01,248
Then he's gonna need some
eyewitnesses for verification.

618
00:44:01,382 --> 00:44:02,883
Let's go!

619
00:44:09,256 --> 00:44:13,076
Why does she still
have her clothes on?

620
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:16,897
- Looks like she's playing the flute.
- Oh, wow. kinky.

621
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:23,986
As bared witness
by myself,

622
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:28,526
All of Camp Firewood and the higher
power, however you define it,

623
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:31,912
I hereby consecrate
and sanctify the union...

624
00:44:32,163 --> 00:44:34,630
of McKinley and Ben.

625
00:44:34,665 --> 00:44:37,918
May their majestic
and blessed love...

626
00:44:37,953 --> 00:44:41,172
flourish all the days
of their lives.

627
00:44:42,673 --> 00:44:44,675
- Amen.
- Amen.

628
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:46,544
Amen.

629
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:52,933
McKinley's a fag.

630
00:44:53,434 --> 00:44:56,937
- McKinley's a fag with Ben!
- What are we gonna do?

631
00:44:58,205 --> 00:45:00,491
Capture the flag!

632
00:45:13,154 --> 00:45:16,157
Hey, aren't you
gonna eat anything?

633
00:45:16,657 --> 00:45:18,159
I'm not hungry.

634
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:24,165
So, you haven't made many
friends this summer, have you?

635
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,632
No, I have not.

636
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:30,554
- Let's drop the robot voice, shall we?
- Okay.

637
00:45:30,921 --> 00:45:34,558
- This your first summer here?
- Fifth. You were my counselor...

638
00:45:34,675 --> 00:45:36,642
- three times.
- Now I'm the camp director.

639
00:45:36,677 --> 00:45:40,181
If there's anything I can do to make your
last day more enjoyable, let me know.

640
00:45:40,216 --> 00:45:42,148
Really?

641
00:45:42,183 --> 00:45:45,686
I have an idea. How about
whatever you've been working
on is your talent tonight?

642
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:48,654
That way, the other campers
can get to know you.

643
00:45:48,689 --> 00:45:52,576
- It's not a song or anything. - It's
okay. I'll have Susie put you on the list.

644
00:45:53,077 --> 00:45:55,579
Oh, God! Thank you!

645
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:59,950
- How was the waterfront this morning?
- It was good.

646
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:03,329
We gonna get a chance
to spend time together?

647
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:06,207
Are you gonna pound this
into my face all day?

648
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:08,674
Sorry.

649
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:11,677
Apology accepted.

650
00:46:11,712 --> 00:46:15,216
Guess what. A bunch of us went into town
and got ice cream and hamburgers...

651
00:46:15,251 --> 00:46:17,218
It smells like the ribs are ready.

652
00:46:21,722 --> 00:46:25,441
Beth, I may regret saying this,

653
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:30,481
- but how dare you usurp my authority
as producer... - Hmpf!

654
00:46:30,516 --> 00:46:32,483
Director/choreographer
of the talent show?

655
00:46:32,983 --> 00:46:35,486
You were wrong
to do that!

656
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:38,087
I have been busting
my balls, woman!

657
00:46:38,122 --> 00:46:41,125
I am telling you,
the musical numbers are a mess,

658
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,093
my kids are a bunch
of amateurs,

659
00:46:44,128 --> 00:46:47,381
and the last thing I need today
is some diabetic freak...

660
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:50,634
prancing around on stage
making my life a living hell!

661
00:46:52,636 --> 00:46:55,256
All right, I'll put him last.

662
00:46:55,506 --> 00:46:57,508
Good.

663
00:46:58,008 --> 00:47:00,010
Oh, she always wins!

664
00:47:02,012 --> 00:47:05,015
Don't pick it up, stupid!

665
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,852
Stop picking it up!

666
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:10,619
You see? this is us,

667
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:16,160
and we're traveling
around the sun.

668
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:22,166
That's a 1.3 million mile trip
every year!

669
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:24,633
Radical.

670
00:47:24,668 --> 00:47:28,172
You might say that
each and every one of us...

671
00:47:28,207 --> 00:47:31,675
is a crew member here
on spaceship earth.

672
00:47:32,176 --> 00:47:34,678
- When would we say that?
- Any time.

673
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:37,646
Dinner. Literally any time.

674
00:47:37,681 --> 00:47:41,552
You're amazing. I hope I can come to your
college and you can be my professor.

675
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:45,020
Actually, I, uh...

676
00:47:45,055 --> 00:47:48,559
I'm just an associate professor.

677
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:50,811
- What does that mean?
- Melvyn!

678
00:47:50,846 --> 00:47:52,813
No, no, it's all right.

679
00:47:53,063 --> 00:47:55,315
it means, Melvyn...

680
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,568
It means that I'm...

681
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:03,574
less than.

682
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:13,083
Oh, God!

683
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,223
Hey! What's goin' on?

684
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:23,344
Hey, Beth. We're just
having ourselves a little cry.

685
00:48:28,098 --> 00:48:30,065
I know what
this group needs.

686
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,103
How 'bout we grab some lunch and
watch the "capture the flag" game?

687
00:48:33,138 --> 00:48:36,991
- What do you say?
- I think we'll take a rain check, Beth.

688
00:48:37,491 --> 00:48:41,495
- We're in the middle of some pretty
interesting stuff. - I'll make you a deal.

689
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:44,330
You come watch the "capture the
flag game" with the normal kids,

690
00:48:44,365 --> 00:48:47,868
and then you can have the whole rest
of the day to learn about planets, stars,

691
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:51,372
pulsars, heliocentricity,
gravitational collapse...

692
00:48:51,755 --> 00:48:53,222
and the science
of celestial mechanics...

693
00:48:53,257 --> 00:48:56,260
as shown through the work of
the 19th century scientists...

694
00:48:56,295 --> 00:49:00,764
Alexis Clairaut, Jean d'Alembert
and Pierre Laplace.

695
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:03,517
- Okay? Ready?
- Okay!

696
00:49:03,884 --> 00:49:06,520
Break!

697
00:49:09,523 --> 00:49:13,527
Gee, I was really impressed by some
of the stuff you said back there.

698
00:49:13,562 --> 00:49:17,997
- Oh, it was... - No, Beth, you
know what you're talking about.

699
00:49:18,032 --> 00:49:20,034
I don't know where you find the
time to learn about astrophysics.

700
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:24,038
I mean, with camp payroll
and insurance to deal with.

701
00:49:24,538 --> 00:49:27,541
Keeping parents happy,
supervising a young staff.

702
00:49:27,576 --> 00:49:30,509
- Keeping everyone fed.
- Wow.

703
00:49:30,544 --> 00:49:34,548
It was in 1908 that the first
American summer camps
were founded in the Catskills.

704
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:40,804
- Is there any more corn?
- What?

705
00:49:41,305 --> 00:49:44,308
- More corn.
- Oh, dude.

706
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:47,311
- You got...
- What, dude?

707
00:49:47,428 --> 00:49:49,930
What? What are you doing
with your hand?

708
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:52,531
On your face. You, uh...

709
00:49:52,566 --> 00:49:55,534
Cat got your tongue, Andy?
What is it?

710
00:49:55,569 --> 00:49:58,322
You have barbecue sauce
all over your face.

711
00:49:58,439 --> 00:50:01,442
- I know that. So?
- It's pretty foul.

712
00:50:01,825 --> 00:50:07,331
It's just barbecue sauce.
Come on. I wanna make out.

713
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:11,835
Okay, but not here.

714
00:50:18,342 --> 00:50:20,809
What's it like being a professor?

715
00:50:20,844 --> 00:50:25,849
- What do they say, "publish or perish"?
- Well, perish mostly.

716
00:50:25,884 --> 00:50:28,352
I'm up for tenure
this fall.

717
00:50:28,852 --> 00:50:31,355
If I don't make my mark soon,
I could end up out of work.

718
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:34,358
But you're so talented!

719
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:36,860
Tell that to my dean.

720
00:50:38,362 --> 00:50:41,865
Okay. Okay, what's his address?

721
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,833
You serious?
56 Linden Lane.

722
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:48,454
- Okay. City?
- God, you're really... Augusta.

723
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:51,492
- State? - I can't believe...
well, Maine, of course.

724
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:55,961
- ZIP?
- This is... 04139.

725
00:50:55,996 --> 00:50:58,499
- Does he have an apartment number?
- No!

726
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:03,504
Beth, this is incredible. I don't
know how to thank you.

727
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:07,007
You already have, Henry.
You already have.

728
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,653
This is crazy.
This is crazy.

729
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:26,753
That's it, Lars.

730
00:52:27,254 --> 00:52:29,256
Good. Keep your feet together.

731
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:30,891
You got it. Good.

732
00:52:34,144 --> 00:52:36,111
Aah!

733
00:52:36,146 --> 00:52:39,766
You taste like a burger.
I don't like you anymore.

734
00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:43,520
Whatever!

735
00:52:48,525 --> 00:52:51,344
Damn it!

736
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:54,023
Is it my turn yet?

737
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:08,795
So, this is where I come
when I want to think.

738
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,797
Wow!

739
00:53:11,298 --> 00:53:13,800
It's very...

740
00:53:13,835 --> 00:53:16,303
Barn-like.

741
00:53:20,807 --> 00:53:23,275
You know, it's weird, Coop.

742
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,813
I was supposed to be in the woods
with Andy this afternoon, but...

743
00:53:26,848 --> 00:53:31,318
Oh. I'm sorry. We can go back.
We should go back.

744
00:53:31,353 --> 00:53:34,821
No, no! It's okay.
I can see him later.

745
00:53:40,827 --> 00:53:43,830
Give me your hand.

746
00:53:48,969 --> 00:53:50,936
It's cold.

747
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:53,974
Yeah. I'm freezing.

748
00:53:54,474 --> 00:53:55,976
Do you want
my sweatshirt?

749
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:58,345
Do you mind?

750
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,864
Okay, Coop, now I'm colder than
I was before when I said I was cold.

751
00:54:19,366 --> 00:54:21,868
Well, do you want my flannel?

752
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,872
Yeah.

753
00:54:34,514 --> 00:54:38,518
This is cool! It's really a
great shirt. I love it.

754
00:54:38,553 --> 00:54:41,521
It's my favorite shirt.

755
00:54:42,022 --> 00:54:45,025
So... you're gonna have
to give it back.

756
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,027
Now?

757
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:49,529
Yeah.

758
00:54:58,038 --> 00:55:00,505
What are we doing?

759
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,044
- Do you mean like switching our shirts?
- No.

760
00:55:04,544 --> 00:55:07,047
What are we doing?

761
00:55:07,082 --> 00:55:09,049
I don't know.

762
00:55:28,185 --> 00:55:32,072
Okay, so I'm Ron and I'm calling you.
Here we go. Ring, ring.

763
00:55:32,439 --> 00:55:34,441
Hello?
Hi, Gail.

764
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:36,408
It's me, Ron.

765
00:55:36,443 --> 00:55:40,912
Hi, Ron. What do
you want? Um, well...

766
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:45,452
I'm ready to give our marriage
another shot. What do you say?

767
00:55:46,953 --> 00:55:49,456
Um...

768
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:51,591
Be strong, Gail!

769
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:55,962
- No.
- No, Ron, it's over.

770
00:55:55,997 --> 00:56:00,217
Good-bye.

771
00:56:08,225 --> 00:56:10,727
Hi, mom. Could you get dad?

772
00:56:10,762 --> 00:56:13,195
Just get him.

773
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:17,234
Hi, dad. Okay, are you
guys sitting down?

774
00:56:17,734 --> 00:56:20,737
I met somebody. Well, she's got
this other boyfriend,

775
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:23,240
but, well, it's just a matter
of time, I think.

776
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:28,378
Her name is Katie,
and she's really great.

777
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:31,346
And, um... what?
I don't think so.

778
00:56:31,381 --> 00:56:34,349
She might be.
She's got a pretty big nose.

779
00:56:34,384 --> 00:56:37,387
Well, I know how you guys worry that
I have trouble meeting girls.

780
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:39,855
And I'm just saying,
worry no more.

781
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,894
Well, I should get going.
she's probably looking for me.

782
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:47,898
Okay, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.
Bye-bye.

783
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,367
This feels so good.

784
00:56:52,402 --> 00:56:55,405
Maybe you shouldn't jump
the gun just yet, Coop.

785
00:56:55,772 --> 00:56:58,775
Very good, very good.

786
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:01,278
A-plus for comedy, Beth.

787
00:57:01,778 --> 00:57:04,281
Ruth Buzzi better watch
her back.

788
00:57:04,316 --> 00:57:07,284
Beth!
"Jump the gun."

789
00:57:12,172 --> 00:57:15,050
# Day by day #

790
00:57:15,085 --> 00:57:17,893
# Day by day #

791
00:57:17,928 --> 00:57:23,300
Okay, stop! I feel like I'm watching
regional theater, you guys.

792
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:26,821
God, am I at the Cleveland
playhouse or something?

793
00:57:26,856 --> 00:57:30,274
Your craft is a muscle!
You need to exercise it!

794
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:33,693
Take a break! Think about
what you've done.

795
00:57:34,194 --> 00:57:36,947
Gee, Susie, have you
seen Katie anywhere?

796
00:57:36,982 --> 00:57:39,414
No. why?

797
00:57:39,449 --> 00:57:41,701
No particular reason. But if you see her,
will you tell her I'm looking for her?

798
00:57:42,202 --> 00:57:44,955
- Sure.
- Okay.

799
00:57:46,957 --> 00:57:49,459
All right, with passion!

800
00:57:52,078 --> 00:57:54,581
Katie! Are you in here?

801
00:57:54,714 --> 00:57:56,216
Oh, hi.

802
00:57:56,716 --> 00:57:59,719
Um, I want to talk
to you later, okay?

803
00:58:00,086 --> 00:58:03,089
Oh, yeah. Sure.

804
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:17,854
Dinner!

805
00:58:18,104 --> 00:58:21,107
- Have you seen J.J. and Gary? Do you
know where they are? - Don't know.

806
00:58:21,142 --> 00:58:24,110
I'm a little worried they might have
found out about us. - Hey!

807
00:58:24,361 --> 00:58:25,862
McKinley and Ben!

808
00:58:27,747 --> 00:58:30,617
This is for you.

809
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,623
It's a chaise lounge.

810
00:58:36,873 --> 00:58:40,377
We didn't know if maybe you
guys already had one. We
have the receipt if you do.

811
00:58:40,412 --> 00:58:42,844
No, we don't have one. Thank you!

812
00:58:42,879 --> 00:58:45,382
It goes with the chenille throw
cloth Beth's sister gave us.

813
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:49,100
Okay, everybody, attention.
I've got an announcement.

814
00:58:49,135 --> 00:58:51,638
I know you're all getting ready
for the big talent show tonight,

815
00:58:51,673 --> 00:58:55,159
but the following campers
need to put their trunks out...

816
00:58:55,194 --> 00:58:58,645
so the early bus to Boston
can pick them up at 7:30 a.m.

817
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:03,667
Amanda Klein, Jessica Azaria,

818
00:59:03,702 --> 00:59:08,655
Ira Stevenberg, Sol Zimmerstein,

819
00:59:10,156 --> 00:59:14,544
uh, David... Ben Gurion.

820
00:59:16,546 --> 00:59:20,049
Cookin' slop for the grunts
in 'Nam was easier than this.

821
00:59:20,084 --> 00:59:23,553
We had no place being over there.

822
00:59:23,588 --> 00:59:25,520
It was a war we couldn't win, Gene.

823
00:59:25,555 --> 00:59:30,560
Yeah, well I'm gonna go
smear some mud on my ass.

824
00:59:30,595 --> 00:59:32,929
What?

825
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:38,900
I said, "I hear
my bud's in class."

826
00:59:38,935 --> 00:59:42,188
I gotta go and call my bud
and see how his grades are.

827
00:59:42,223 --> 00:59:45,442
- I, I gotta go. go away, leave
me alone. - Gene, hold on.

828
00:59:45,942 --> 00:59:50,447
Look, I don't care what you do in your
private time, but don't lie about it.

829
00:59:50,482 --> 00:59:54,799
I mean, you clearly said,
"smear mud on my ass."

830
00:59:54,834 --> 01:00:00,840
And I'll tell you something.
If you wanna smear mud on your ass,
smear mud on your ass.

831
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:03,209
Just be honest about it.

832
01:00:03,343 --> 01:00:06,846
Look, Gene, I've never
told anyone this before.

833
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:10,850
But I can suck my own dick.
And I do it.

834
01:00:11,217 --> 01:00:13,720
A lot.

835
01:00:14,104 --> 01:00:16,106
There, I said it.
I was honest.

836
01:00:16,141 --> 01:00:18,440
And you know what, Gene?

837
01:00:18,475 --> 01:00:21,478
Being honest
makes you feel better.

838
01:00:22,729 --> 01:00:27,233
Hey, Katie, wait.
I'm sorry about before.

839
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:29,736
- I hope that wasn't bad timing.
- No.

840
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:31,836
- Coop, we have to talk.
- Sure.

841
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,875
I was thinking that what happened
between us before was a mistake.

842
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:38,343
- And, uh...
- What?

843
01:00:38,378 --> 01:00:40,380
I wasn't thinking straight.
It was wrong.

844
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,885
No, it wasn't wrong.
Katie, why are you doing this?

845
01:00:46,386 --> 01:00:48,353
I'm really sorry.

846
01:00:48,388 --> 01:00:51,391
Come on!
This is a joke, right?

847
01:00:51,426 --> 01:00:53,858
I have a boyfriend, Coop.

848
01:00:53,893 --> 01:00:58,398
And I can't... I can't do
this. I'm sorry.

849
01:01:03,403 --> 01:01:05,487
Wait, Katie!

850
01:01:05,522 --> 01:01:09,275
When we first started hanging
out together this morning...

851
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:11,242
we were just friends.

852
01:01:11,277 --> 01:01:14,781
But things change, and I've
fallen in love with you.

853
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:18,418
And I just, I just know
that if you gave me a chance,

854
01:01:18,918 --> 01:01:21,386
I could make you feel so good.

855
01:01:21,421 --> 01:01:24,756
So I'm coming to you,
not as your buddy,

856
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:27,427
and not as a co-counselor,
but for the first time as a man.

857
01:01:27,927 --> 01:01:30,395
A man who loves a woman,

858
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:33,433
and who wants to hold her,
and provide for her,

859
01:01:33,468 --> 01:01:35,435
and, yes, have sex with her.

860
01:01:35,685 --> 01:01:38,688
But, seriously, Katie,
I love the way you laugh.

861
01:01:38,723 --> 01:01:40,772
And I love the way
your hair smells.

862
01:01:40,807 --> 01:01:44,811
And I love it that sometimes for
no reason, you're late for shul.

863
01:01:45,061 --> 01:01:48,413
And I don't care that
you're bowlegged and bilingual.

864
01:01:48,448 --> 01:01:51,451
All I know is I would have said "no"
to every person on your list...

865
01:01:51,486 --> 01:01:54,454
because I've always
wanted you.

866
01:01:56,823 --> 01:01:59,826
Coop, I don't know
what to say.

867
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:05,081
Coop, wait!

868
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:10,086
Rachael Clipperhofferman,

869
01:02:11,588 --> 01:02:13,590
- Steven Schenk...
- Beth!

870
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,343
- Can I make a quick announcement
before we finish up? - Sure thing.

871
01:02:21,731 --> 01:02:25,735
I want to thank all of you
for a terrific summer.

872
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,238
Cooking for all you
nice people...

873
01:02:28,605 --> 01:02:32,859
has really helped me get over the
fact that I fought in the Vietnam war.

874
01:02:32,894 --> 01:02:35,361
Have a great winter!
I'm gonna go hump the fridge!

875
01:02:35,745 --> 01:02:37,997
What?

876
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:47,006
Yes, folks, it's true. I said,
"I'm gonna go hump the fridge."

877
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:53,946
What you may not know is that
I also own a bottle of dick cream.

878
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:59,018
I fondle my sweaters, and I often
like to smear mud on my ass.

879
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:02,772
You're probably asking yourselves,
"isn't he a weirdo,

880
01:03:02,807 --> 01:03:04,774
outcast, loose cannon?"

881
01:03:06,643 --> 01:03:10,111
Maybe. I don't think so.

882
01:03:10,146 --> 01:03:14,150
I want to introduce you guys
to someone. This is my friend.

883
01:03:16,653 --> 01:03:19,155
I don't know who he is,
but I do know this.

884
01:03:19,656 --> 01:03:24,661
At a time when I was trying
to hide myself from myself,

885
01:03:24,696 --> 01:03:28,665
He was there to show me a new way.

886
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:33,169
Because I couldn't hide from him.

887
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:37,173
And I can be proud of who I am.

888
01:03:39,175 --> 01:03:42,679
I put it to you, Camp Firewood,

889
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:47,684
As we spend our last dinner together:
Be proud of who you are!

890
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:53,072
Look at me, ma!

891
01:03:53,439 --> 01:03:56,884
I made it! I'm okay!

892
01:04:06,836 --> 01:04:08,838
Now, if you don't mind,

893
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,344
I have some unfinished
business to attend to.

894
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,364
Great!

895
01:04:48,244 --> 01:04:51,247
Hey! Hey!

896
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:58,504
You fuckin' assholes!
Let me go!

897
01:05:00,506 --> 01:05:03,474
No! No! No!

898
01:05:03,509 --> 01:05:06,012
Please, stop!
No, no, no!

899
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:09,515
No! No!

900
01:05:19,392 --> 01:05:23,494
Oh, Henry,
I'm so happy.

901
01:05:23,529 --> 01:05:26,532
But what will become
of us tomorrow?

902
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:29,500
Hey, you. Penny for your thoughts.

903
01:05:29,535 --> 01:05:32,538
Beth, tomorrow's
the least of our problems.

904
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,542
Don't tell me. Don't even
tell me you have crabs.

905
01:05:37,043 --> 01:05:39,510
No. Well, yes,
but that's not the point.

906
01:05:39,545 --> 01:05:42,513
- What is the point? - This isn't the
time or the place to discuss it.

907
01:05:42,548 --> 01:05:46,552
Beth, meet me at the picnic table in
ten seconds. I'll tell you all about it.

908
01:05:46,587 --> 01:05:49,020
Okay.

909
01:05:58,064 --> 01:06:02,533
Beth, hello. Thanks for coming.
Let's get right to it.

910
01:06:02,568 --> 01:06:05,071
You may recall ten seconds ago, I asked
you to join me here by the picnic table...

911
01:06:05,571 --> 01:06:07,073
so I could tell you what's going on.

912
01:06:07,573 --> 01:06:12,078
Well, earlier today, I saw what I
thought was possibly a planet,

913
01:06:12,113 --> 01:06:15,415
also possibly a meteor
in the evening sky.

914
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:18,683
I now believe that object
was none other...

915
01:06:18,718 --> 01:06:22,722
than a renegade piece of Skylab,
the NASA space station.

916
01:06:22,757 --> 01:06:26,225
- And it's heading right for the camp.
- Oh, my God!

917
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:30,730
And there's more. We have
no way of pinpointing exactly
where it's going to land.

918
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,197
- It could kill us all!
- Jesus!

919
01:06:33,232 --> 01:06:36,200
Wait a minute! There
might be a way...

920
01:06:36,235 --> 01:06:39,203
to build a homemade
Skylab tracking device!

921
01:06:39,238 --> 01:06:42,859
- Which accomplishes? - We could
surmise the location of impact.

922
01:06:42,894 --> 01:06:45,862
We could avert a tragedy on
the scale of the Hindenburg.

923
01:06:45,897 --> 01:06:49,248
- Beth, will you help us?
- Anything you need.

924
01:06:49,283 --> 01:06:52,001
Let's do it!

925
01:06:52,118 --> 01:06:53,619
Hey, Andy?

926
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,873
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

927
01:06:57,123 --> 01:06:58,624
- Okay, well...
- Time's up.

928
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,127
You said a second.

929
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:04,764
- I want to ask you something. - So you
want to talk for more than a second?

930
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:07,849
- Yeah.
- What is it then? like a couple minutes?

931
01:07:07,884 --> 01:07:10,636
- No. yeah, at most, say, like
three minutes. - Fine.

932
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,023
- Do you really love Katie?
- Not really.

933
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,107
Because I really
love her, man.

934
01:07:16,142 --> 01:07:20,146
And if you have one ounce of decency,
you will do the right thing and let her go.

935
01:07:20,181 --> 01:07:21,898
- No way!
- No way?

936
01:07:22,281 --> 01:07:25,401
Fuck no, dude. She's hot!
In fact, fuck off.

937
01:07:25,436 --> 01:07:28,002
I will not fuck off.

938
01:07:28,037 --> 01:07:30,790
You're making a really
big mistake, buddy,

939
01:07:30,825 --> 01:07:33,543
because that woman
is not your plaything.

940
01:07:33,793 --> 01:07:38,297
Coop, seriously...
Fuck off.

941
01:07:38,414 --> 01:07:42,418
- I'm sick of talking about this with you.
- God!

942
01:07:50,059 --> 01:07:52,311
Whoa!

943
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:02,321
So this is the Skylab
tracking device?

944
01:08:02,356 --> 01:08:04,288
Is this gonna save
my camp?

945
01:08:04,323 --> 01:08:07,076
I don't know. But if it does,
we'll all be heroes.

946
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:09,971
In fact, I just got word
that if we pull this off,

947
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:12,797
I could be up for the Hopkins
prize for physics.

948
01:08:12,832 --> 01:08:17,336
The Hopkins! Baby, what a dream.
You'll finally get your tenure.

949
01:08:32,101 --> 01:08:34,103
Be proud of who you are.

950
01:08:34,604 --> 01:08:36,571
Huh?

951
01:08:36,606 --> 01:08:40,074
- Gene?
- Shh.

952
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:44,113
- It isn't about the girl.
- It isn't?

953
01:08:44,614 --> 01:08:46,616
Well, it is,

954
01:08:48,117 --> 01:08:52,121
but see if you
can follow me here.

955
01:08:52,156 --> 01:08:55,124
It...

956
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:57,627
isn't.

957
01:08:58,628 --> 01:09:01,095
Oh.

958
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:05,134
So it is and it isn't.

959
01:09:11,641 --> 01:09:15,645
You are ready to be taught
the new way.

960
01:09:17,647 --> 01:09:23,152
Will you help teach me
about this...

961
01:09:23,187 --> 01:09:27,156
What is it?
a "new way"?

962
01:10:05,561 --> 01:10:07,563
# Show me the fever #

963
01:10:07,813 --> 01:10:12,818
# Into the fire
taking it higher and higher #

964
01:10:12,853 --> 01:10:17,823
# Nothing to fear
it's only desire #

965
01:10:17,858 --> 01:10:19,825
# Taking it higher and higher #

966
01:10:20,326 --> 01:10:24,830
# Whoo-hoo-hoo #

967
01:10:24,865 --> 01:10:28,351
# Higher, higher #

968
01:10:28,386 --> 01:10:31,802
# Show me the fever #

969
01:10:31,837 --> 01:10:37,093
# Into the fire
taking it higher and higher #

970
01:10:38,094 --> 01:10:41,731
# Nothing to fear
it's only desire #

971
01:10:41,766 --> 01:10:45,234
# Taking it higher and higher #

972
01:10:45,269 --> 01:10:47,737
# Whoo-hoo #

973
01:10:55,745 --> 01:10:57,163
Abby.

974
01:10:57,663 --> 01:11:00,666
Abby. Abby, my lover,
my friend. Abby!

975
01:11:08,791 --> 01:11:12,510
- Hey, Neil, what's up?
- Victor abandoned the raft trip,

976
01:11:12,545 --> 01:11:15,047
and now the kids are about to
go over devil's canyon rapids!

977
01:11:19,802 --> 01:11:22,054
- Where did he go?
- He wanted to get back to camp.

978
01:11:22,089 --> 01:11:24,199
So you left the campers
alone on the river?

979
01:11:24,234 --> 01:11:26,274
Only Victor knows how
to navigate those rapids.

980
01:11:26,309 --> 01:11:28,811
We've got to find him and get him
back to that river.

981
01:11:28,846 --> 01:11:31,697
It's him!
Victor! Victor!

982
01:11:32,198 --> 01:11:34,200
- We lost him, goddamn it!
- I've got him!

983
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,534
- Where is he?
- He's calling from inside the camp.

984
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:40,072
The only other phone is in
the infirmary! We gotta go!

985
01:11:42,825 --> 01:11:44,827
Ahhh.

986
01:11:48,714 --> 01:11:50,216
Beth, what's the matter?

987
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:53,719
The phone! Where's
the fucking phone?

988
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:57,223
In the back room.

989
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:16,742
We're losing time!

990
01:12:21,998 --> 01:12:25,001
My baby!

991
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:28,120
I want to make love to you!

992
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:30,623
Abby!

993
01:12:32,124 --> 01:12:33,626
Abby?

994
01:12:35,628 --> 01:12:37,094
Moose?

995
01:12:37,129 --> 01:12:39,882
Um, you're gonna think
this is so shallow,

996
01:12:39,917 --> 01:12:42,635
- but what was your name again?
- Oh, my God.

997
01:12:43,135 --> 01:12:46,638
Do you have any idea...

998
01:12:46,673 --> 01:12:50,142
what I had to go through
to see you?

999
01:12:50,643 --> 01:12:53,646
You snooze, you lose, dude.

1000
01:12:55,648 --> 01:13:00,152
Victor Pulak, there's a raft of campers
about to go over devil's canyon rapids!

1001
01:13:01,787 --> 01:13:05,291
Are you gonna be part of the
problem, or are you the solution?

1002
01:13:11,664 --> 01:13:14,131
Let's go.

1003
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:17,169
Let's go!

1004
01:13:22,058 --> 01:13:23,559
Here we go.

1005
01:13:28,064 --> 01:13:31,532
- Oh, fuck my cock!
- What does it say?

1006
01:13:31,567 --> 01:13:35,071
According to this readout, Skylab is
going to land directly on the rec hall.

1007
01:13:35,106 --> 01:13:37,038
Oh, no. When?

1008
01:13:37,073 --> 01:13:39,540
- Sometime in the next 90 minutes.
- Oh, my God!

1009
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:43,079
- That's only one mix tape.
- The talent show's starting right now!

1010
01:13:43,579 --> 01:13:46,699
- Good evening, Firewood!
- Are you ready for some talent?

1011
01:13:49,585 --> 01:13:52,455
- Beth, we have to evacuate the
rec hall immediately! - Yeah.

1012
01:13:52,588 --> 01:13:54,398
Victor!

1013
01:13:54,433 --> 01:13:56,208
Come on!

1014
01:13:59,845 --> 01:14:01,847
Stand back.

1015
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:06,352
Whoa! Whoa!

1016
01:14:06,852 --> 01:14:11,857
You're a master, Vic.
What the... what the fu... what?

1017
01:14:11,892 --> 01:14:14,360
You're doing it.
You're actually doing it.

1018
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,364
Oh! You saved them!
You saved them!

1019
01:14:21,734 --> 01:14:25,738
Victor Pulak,
You're okay by me.

1020
01:14:25,773 --> 01:14:27,740
I'm okay, you're okay.

1021
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,745
And Neil, next time we go
camping, you drive the Van.

1022
01:14:50,262 --> 01:14:52,515
I wish there was another way.
Maybe we should just let them die.

1023
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:54,517
No! My friend,
Jimmy's, in there.

1024
01:14:55,017 --> 01:14:57,019
- You have a friend?
- I'm kidding.

1025
01:14:57,269 --> 01:14:59,271
Wait a minute.

1026
01:15:02,274 --> 01:15:04,241
- No.
- What?

1027
01:15:04,276 --> 01:15:07,780
Well, there might be a way that
we could use our device...

1028
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:11,784
to slightly change
its direction, but...

1029
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:13,751
no, it's impossible.

1030
01:15:13,786 --> 01:15:15,753
Why? What's the problem?

1031
01:15:15,788 --> 01:15:18,255
In order to do it, we would
somehow have to be able...

1032
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:21,293
to repeatedly generate random
numbers between one and twenty...

1033
01:15:21,794 --> 01:15:23,295
in order to calibrate
the deferential.

1034
01:15:23,796 --> 01:15:28,300
That would take some sort of
super mainframe computer
and we don't have one.

1035
01:15:28,335 --> 01:15:31,070
So all is lost.

1036
01:15:31,105 --> 01:15:33,771
No, it's not.

1037
01:15:33,806 --> 01:15:37,309
Any dungeon master
worth his weight in geldings...

1038
01:15:37,344 --> 01:15:40,813
goes nowhere without his...

1039
01:15:42,815 --> 01:15:44,782
20-sided die.

1040
01:15:44,817 --> 01:15:48,704
I'd like to introduce us
to the emcee for the evening.

1041
01:15:49,205 --> 01:15:54,210
We brought him all the way
from Kutscher's Country Club
in the Catskill mountains.

1042
01:15:54,245 --> 01:15:57,713
Wait!
I have some bad news!

1043
01:15:59,331 --> 01:16:01,834
And my bad news is...

1044
01:16:06,472 --> 01:16:11,477
and my bad news is... there is
no bad news. I was just joking.

1045
01:16:11,844 --> 01:16:13,811
Good one, Beth.

1046
01:16:13,846 --> 01:16:17,850
Let's give a Firewood welcome
to Mr. Alan Shemper!

1047
01:16:21,103 --> 01:16:23,070
Thank you very much.

1048
01:16:23,105 --> 01:16:27,610
Hello, Camp Firewood.
Thank you for having me.

1049
01:16:27,993 --> 01:16:32,998
I went to sleep-away camp so
long ago that it was the stone age.

1050
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:36,001
Seriously, it wasn't
the stone age.

1051
01:16:36,036 --> 01:16:38,469
It was the ice age!

1052
01:16:38,504 --> 01:16:42,124
No, really, it was the stone age.
But, folks,

1053
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:46,343
actually I went
to camp Machnudin...

1054
01:16:46,378 --> 01:16:48,380
in the pine hills
of Westchester, New York.

1055
01:16:48,415 --> 01:16:50,347
And that was so long ago...

1056
01:16:50,382 --> 01:16:54,386
for breakfast we had to eat
scrambled pterodactyl eggs...

1057
01:16:54,421 --> 01:16:57,389
and Raptor bacon!

1058
01:16:57,523 --> 01:17:00,776
Back then we didn't
have cots, we had slabs.

1059
01:17:02,278 --> 01:17:05,531
Instead of sleeping bags,
we had sleeping pelts.

1060
01:17:13,656 --> 01:17:18,661
Our first act hails
all the way from over in bunk 2.

1061
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:24,166
And his name is Roger,
The Master Broom Balancer.

1062
01:17:37,062 --> 01:17:38,564
Holy cow!

1063
01:17:40,182 --> 01:17:43,185
Right here, right here.

1064
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:45,688
Let's pray to God
this works.

1065
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:50,075
# Love will pervade us
till death separates us #

1066
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:53,579
# We're friends
friends, friends #

1067
01:17:53,614 --> 01:17:57,047
That's from us
to bunk 7!

1068
01:17:57,082 --> 01:17:59,300
- Nine or six, what was it?
- Nine!

1069
01:17:59,335 --> 01:18:03,839
Okay. We're getting closer.
Give me another. Seven.

1070
01:18:03,874 --> 01:18:06,674
White folks are so stupid
when they get mad.

1071
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:10,212
They be like, "hey, asshole,
I'm going to kick your behind."

1072
01:18:10,247 --> 01:18:13,232
But the brothers don't even need
to raise their voice.

1073
01:18:13,267 --> 01:18:16,218
These motherfuckers be like,
"don't make me say it twice."

1074
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,220
That's true,
that's true.

1075
01:18:18,255 --> 01:18:20,222
I hate white people!

1076
01:18:20,723 --> 01:18:25,227
Be that as it may, this next act
is a guy named Bert Flugalman.

1077
01:18:25,262 --> 01:18:27,730
But it says here
that you all know him as...

1078
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:30,983
Mooooose!

1079
01:18:47,883 --> 01:18:49,850
Gail.

1080
01:18:49,885 --> 01:18:53,389
- Gail.
- Ron.

1081
01:18:56,258 --> 01:18:57,760
What are you doing here?

1082
01:18:58,010 --> 01:19:00,512
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

1083
01:19:01,013 --> 01:19:03,515
And I want you back.

1084
01:19:07,403 --> 01:19:10,371
Ron... I love you,

1085
01:19:10,406 --> 01:19:13,909
and I want to be with you,
but...

1086
01:19:15,911 --> 01:19:18,414
I've just had too many
woulda-coulda-shouldas in my life.

1087
01:19:18,449 --> 01:19:20,881
Well, I'm just...

1088
01:19:20,916 --> 01:19:24,920
I'm just sick and tired of being
sick and tired, you know?

1089
01:19:24,955 --> 01:19:28,424
And if you can't handle that,
then to hell with you!

1090
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:31,543
You'll come back to me, Gail.
I know you will.

1091
01:19:37,433 --> 01:19:40,436
I don't think so,
Ronald von Kleinenshtein.

1092
01:19:40,471 --> 01:19:42,938
I really don't think so.

1093
01:19:49,561 --> 01:19:53,198
And now, Camp Fizzie-poo,
performing the song...

1094
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:56,702
"Day by day" from
the musical godspell,

1095
01:19:56,737 --> 01:19:58,704
is Susie's drama group.

1096
01:20:00,205 --> 01:20:01,707
Before we start,
I'd just like to say...

1097
01:20:02,207 --> 01:20:04,209
that the campers you're
about to see suck dick.

1098
01:20:04,244 --> 01:20:06,211
Nevertheless, please welcome them.

1099
01:20:19,224 --> 01:20:22,727
# Day by day #

1100
01:20:22,762 --> 01:20:26,196
# Day by day #

1101
01:20:26,231 --> 01:20:33,238
# Oh, dear Lord
three things I pray #

1102
01:20:35,107 --> 01:20:37,609
# To see thee more clearly #

1103
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:40,612
# To love thee more dearly #

1104
01:20:41,497 --> 01:20:45,617
# Follow thee more nearly #

1105
01:20:46,118 --> 01:20:47,753
# Day by day #

1106
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:53,125
# Day by day #
# Day by day #

1107
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,627
# Day by day #

1108
01:20:56,128 --> 01:21:01,884
# Oh, dear Lord
three things I pray #

1109
01:21:04,269 --> 01:21:06,271
# To see thee more clearly #

1110
01:21:06,772 --> 01:21:10,741
# Love thee more dearly #

1111
01:21:10,776 --> 01:21:15,781
# Follow thee more nearly
day by day #

1112
01:21:17,533 --> 01:21:25,157
# Day by day by day
by day by day #

1113
01:21:26,291 --> 01:21:29,760
Boo!

1114
01:21:29,795 --> 01:21:32,798
Well, well, well,
I can honestly say...

1115
01:21:33,298 --> 01:21:35,766
that there is
no Broadway ditty...

1116
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:40,305
closer to my heart than the one
you just heard, "day bidet."

1117
01:21:40,672 --> 01:21:42,139
Give me another.

1118
01:21:42,174 --> 01:21:44,176
- Twenty.
- There's not much time left.

1119
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:49,064
When I was at camp, my favorite
activity was always arts and crafts.

1120
01:21:49,099 --> 01:21:53,068
Or as we used to call it,
arts and "farts" and crafts.

1121
01:21:53,185 --> 01:21:55,687
We used to make drawings.

1122
01:21:55,821 --> 01:21:57,823
Cave drawings!

1123
01:21:58,073 --> 01:22:01,542
Which is my way of saying
we were cavemen.

1124
01:22:01,577 --> 01:22:05,080
I went to camp so long ago
that I can remember saying...

1125
01:22:05,115 --> 01:22:08,549
"Sticks and stones may break
my bones," and meaning it!

1126
01:22:08,584 --> 01:22:13,589
I went to camp so long ago that
fucking Jesus Christ was my counselor!

1127
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:17,593
And my best friend
hadn't fully evolved yet.

1128
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,712
His name was Ugh,
and he walked on all fours!

1129
01:22:20,747 --> 01:22:24,108
There were two epidemics
when I went to camp.

1130
01:22:24,143 --> 01:22:27,469
Head lice and the plague...
the bubonic plague.

1131
01:22:52,377 --> 01:22:54,880
# When you look into his eyes #

1132
01:22:55,247 --> 01:22:57,749
# It comes to you
as no surprise #

1133
01:22:58,884 --> 01:23:01,852
# I was the same #

1134
01:23:01,887 --> 01:23:05,390
Katie, I came here
to tell you I'm leaving.

1135
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,359
- Uh, what?
- Yeah.

1136
01:23:09,394 --> 01:23:12,898
I've grown up a lot since before
dinner when we last talked.

1137
01:23:12,933 --> 01:23:16,867
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1138
01:23:16,902 --> 01:23:21,406
Maybe see the world. I got a couple
more weeks before school starts.

1139
01:23:21,907 --> 01:23:25,777
- But...
- Hey.

1140
01:23:26,778 --> 01:23:29,781
I want you to have this.

1141
01:23:35,037 --> 01:23:38,423
Hurry up! I think I can see it
coming towards us!

1142
01:23:42,427 --> 01:23:45,430
And finally, ladies and germs,
is a dude...

1143
01:23:45,465 --> 01:23:49,935
who goes by the name
of... "Steve."

1144
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:53,305
Let's give him a hand.

1145
01:24:03,448 --> 01:24:06,451
Come on, do something.
Or get the fuck off the stage!

1146
01:24:31,843 --> 01:24:34,346
Is that wind?

1147
01:24:51,613 --> 01:24:54,116
Oh, my God.

1148
01:24:58,754 --> 01:25:00,721
Coop?

1149
01:25:00,756 --> 01:25:04,009
Coop, Coop, don't leave.

1150
01:25:04,044 --> 01:25:07,262
Coop!
Coop, I love you!

1151
01:25:09,264 --> 01:25:12,733
Yeah, I didn't know it until
this very moment for sure,

1152
01:25:12,768 --> 01:25:17,272
but now I know, and it feels like
nothing I've ever known before.

1153
01:25:17,307 --> 01:25:19,239
It feels so good.
I love you.

1154
01:25:19,274 --> 01:25:22,109
# Show me the fever #

1155
01:25:22,144 --> 01:25:27,399
# Into the fire
taking it higher and higher #

1156
01:25:27,649 --> 01:25:32,788
# Nothing to fear
it's only desire #

1157
01:25:32,823 --> 01:25:35,290
# Taking it higher and higher #

1158
01:25:36,408 --> 01:25:40,295
# Into this fever
into this fire #

1159
01:25:40,545 --> 01:25:43,799
# Taking it higher and higher #

1160
01:25:43,834 --> 01:25:48,268
# There's nothing evil #

1161
01:25:48,303 --> 01:25:50,305
# Taking it higher and higher #

1162
01:25:50,555 --> 01:25:52,522
How do I know it's real this time?

1163
01:25:52,557 --> 01:25:55,560
Because I'm telling you.
That's all I can do.

1164
01:25:55,595 --> 01:25:57,527
I love you.

1165
01:25:57,562 --> 01:26:02,067
- Say it again. - I love you,
I love you, Gerald Cooperberg!

1166
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:09,324
# Show me the fever #

1167
01:26:09,574 --> 01:26:13,829
# Into the fire
taking it higher and higher #

1168
01:26:18,834 --> 01:26:21,336
It's working!

1169
01:26:42,474 --> 01:26:45,293
Way to go, guys!

1170
01:26:45,328 --> 01:26:48,113
Beth, we did it.

1171
01:27:01,626 --> 01:27:03,128
Whoo!

1172
01:27:22,264 --> 01:27:26,268
Baby, that was beautiful!

1173
01:27:57,966 --> 01:28:03,355
You better write to me.
I'm gonna miss you so much!

1174
01:28:08,727 --> 01:28:11,229
Beth! Beth!
I got it!

1175
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,697
The Hopkins award!

1176
01:28:13,732 --> 01:28:18,737
And, NASA's hiring me to go to work
for them at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

1177
01:28:19,237 --> 01:28:21,239
I'll have
a whole new life!

1178
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:23,707
That's wonderful.

1179
01:28:23,742 --> 01:28:27,746
I knew this would happen. I would meet
you, fall in love and you would leave me.

1180
01:28:28,246 --> 01:28:30,749
Wait, hold on, Beth.
I've already told them,

1181
01:28:30,784 --> 01:28:33,216
I need an apartment
for two people.

1182
01:28:33,251 --> 01:28:36,720
- And they'll fly you back here
every summer. - Fuck you!

1183
01:28:36,755 --> 01:28:41,760
And, Beth, I know we've been
having trouble with, you know...

1184
01:28:41,795 --> 01:28:44,763
but I was thinking when the
time comes, we can adopt.

1185
01:28:44,798 --> 01:28:47,731
Shh. It's happened.

1186
01:28:47,766 --> 01:28:49,768
I'm pregnant.
We're gonna have a baby.

1187
01:28:50,268 --> 01:28:53,772
Oh. Oh, baby!

1188
01:28:53,905 --> 01:28:56,408
- Good-bye, Beth.
- Oh, hey!

1189
01:28:56,908 --> 01:28:58,910
Looks like everything
worked out for you two.

1190
01:28:59,411 --> 01:29:01,413
Yeah, it's the best thing that's
ever happened in my life.

1191
01:29:01,448 --> 01:29:03,415
I hope you like shrimp cocktail,
because we want you...

1192
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:06,418
to be the guest of honor
at our wedding next week.

1193
01:29:06,918 --> 01:29:08,920
We would be delighted.
But I hope it's not Jumbo shrimp...

1194
01:29:08,955 --> 01:29:12,424
because I'm allergic to oxymorons.

1195
01:29:15,927 --> 01:29:17,929
- Bye.
- Bye.

1196
01:29:35,196 --> 01:29:37,699
We saved everyone's life
and they'll never know it.

1197
01:29:37,734 --> 01:29:39,701
I almost like it better
that way.

1198
01:29:40,201 --> 01:29:42,203
It was us rolling the dice
that diverted it, right?

1199
01:29:42,704 --> 01:29:46,172
- Not the enormous gust of wind, right?
- Right.

1200
01:29:46,207 --> 01:29:49,710
I feel like this entire summer,
which kind of sucked,

1201
01:29:49,745 --> 01:29:53,214
has been rejuvenated by the
events of the past 24 hours.

1202
01:29:53,249 --> 01:29:58,219
Yeah, it's like...
well, forget it.

1203
01:29:58,254 --> 01:30:00,221
- You know what?
- What?

1204
01:30:00,722 --> 01:30:04,726
You guys are my best friends.
Well, my only friends.

1205
01:30:04,761 --> 01:30:07,729
- Yeah.
- Nanoo-nanoo.

1206
01:30:14,736 --> 01:30:17,203
- So, this is it, babe.
- Yep.

1207
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:20,992
So, obviously I think we should get
together in the city next weekend.

1208
01:30:21,027 --> 01:30:25,639
- I'll call my parents, and you can
talk to your dad and Kim. - Listen.

1209
01:30:25,674 --> 01:30:30,251
Last night was really great. You were
incredibly romantic and heroic.

1210
01:30:30,286 --> 01:30:33,219
No doubt about it.
And that's great.

1211
01:30:33,254 --> 01:30:36,723
But I've thought about it,
and my thing is this:

1212
01:30:36,758 --> 01:30:39,761
Andy's really hot. And don't
get me wrong, you're cute too.

1213
01:30:40,261 --> 01:30:44,731
But Andy is like cut from
marble. He's gorgeous.

1214
01:30:44,766 --> 01:30:48,770
He's like this beautiful face
and this incredible body,

1215
01:30:48,805 --> 01:30:52,774
and I genuinely don't care
that he's kind of lame.

1216
01:30:53,024 --> 01:30:56,027
I don't even care
that he cheats on me.

1217
01:30:56,528 --> 01:30:59,496
And I like you more than
I like Andy, Coop, but I'm 16.

1218
01:30:59,531 --> 01:31:02,534
And maybe it will be a different story
like when I'm ready to get married.

1219
01:31:02,569 --> 01:31:06,538
But right now, I'm entirely
about sex. I just want Andy.

1220
01:31:07,038 --> 01:31:09,005
- Yeah.
- I wanna take him,

1221
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:13,044
And grab him and just fuck
his brains out, you know?

1222
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:15,564
So that's where my
priorities are right now.

1223
01:31:15,599 --> 01:31:18,325
Sex. Specifically with Andy
and not with you.

1224
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,052
But you're really nice.
Everybody thinks so.

1225
01:31:21,553 --> 01:31:25,557
And I'm sorry if this isn't the direction
you saw things going between us.

1226
01:31:25,592 --> 01:31:28,577
I still totally want
to be friends.

1227
01:31:28,612 --> 01:31:31,563
You better write me
a letter, okay?

1228
01:31:31,598 --> 01:31:34,016
Sure.

1229
01:31:34,051 --> 01:31:36,434
Cool?

1230
01:31:39,437 --> 01:31:42,440
Katie, let's go.

1231
01:32:00,592 --> 01:32:03,595
- How you doing?
- Good.

1232
01:32:27,018 --> 01:32:32,707
# In this Wet
Hot American Summer #

1233
01:32:33,708 --> 01:32:40,582
# You're my Wet Hot
American Dream #

1234
01:32:40,617 --> 01:32:44,050
# That is if you notice me #

1235
01:32:44,085 --> 01:32:50,975
# Then who knows
what the summer could bring #

1236
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:52,977
# Yeah #

1237
01:32:55,346 --> 01:32:58,349
# Summer #

1238
01:33:02,353 --> 01:33:05,673
# Been feeling kinda restless #

1239
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:08,993
# Been feeling all mixed up #

1240
01:33:09,494 --> 01:33:16,117
# Feeling like the girl I want
is gonna show me what she's made of #

1241
01:33:16,618 --> 01:33:23,374
# Why can't I be the boy
that everybody loves #

1242
01:33:23,409 --> 01:33:30,131
# Why can't I be the boy
that everybody loves #

1243
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:43,027
# American Summer #

1244
01:36:33,731 --> 01:36:36,108
I'm sorry, I'm late.
I thought we said 9:30.

1245
01:36:36,143 --> 01:36:38,486
No, we said 9:00 so we
could be here by 9:30.
