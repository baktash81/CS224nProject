1
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,791
Goddamn bunch of cutthroats.
Oh shit!

2
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,355
They'd keep me bellyup out here if
they knew I was getting ready to run.

3
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:26,393
Don't you make a noise
when you walk?

4
00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:31,233
Hey wait a minute.
You got yourself all done up Ruby!

5
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,393
What are you up to?
- Here...

6
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:38,591
Oh no you don't. Ain't no trading
today Ruby. And not no more neither.

7
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:43,587
You folks have gone too far.
Trooper been snooping around.

8
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:48,436
Air Force been through here twice
You folks should go rob an Air Force

9
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,915
PX for god's sakes...

10
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:53,108
I'm hungry. No one comes through
back there anymore.

11
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:54,872
What'd you get?

12
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,750
Whisky and radios.
I ain't got nothing to eat.

13
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:03,990
I'm sorry Ruby,
I know you're starving.

14
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:05,707
But I got nothing else to trade.

15
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:10,066
I got no more gas, no more
cartridges, no more food.

16
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:13,627
And the folks in Corrin Creek
have cut me off already.

17
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,950
And there's even talk of blocking
off this whole section and marching

18
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:19,825
the national guard through
to see what they can find.

19
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:23,025
You coyotes better watch your P's
and Q's for a spell.

20
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:23,709
Take me with you.

21
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:29,032
What? So that's it.
You wanna get out.

22
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:34,224
Do you think you could pass out
there with the regular folks?

23
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,388
Why, you don't know a knife
and fork from your five fingers.

24
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,785
And you stink like a horse.

25
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,309
You're getting out. Take me too!

26
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,308
Does the pack know you're doing
this? Does Jupiter know?

27
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,265
Why, he'd cut you to pieces if I
told him you were going over the hill.

28
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:52,667
If my Pa' knew you was getting out.
He'd rip your lungs out.

29
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:54,786
Hello! Is there anybody around?

30
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:56,899
Get in here.
That'd be the State Troopers.

31
00:03:57,108 --> 00:04:00,987
They'd toss you in jail and toss
the key on the wild side of old ...

32
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:03,862
I'll take a look around.
I don't see anyone...

33
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,660
I didn't hear you.
I was just cleaning up.

34
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:08,256
Well, fill it up and check the oil
and water.

35
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:11,185
I'll give you what I got. I ain't
got much. I'm just closing down.

36
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:15,375
Mornin.

37
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:18,662
Gees!

38
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:25,619
Don't you mind them. They just
wanna play. Beauty, get down!

39
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:30,103
Get down now! That's a good girl

40
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:33,260
I'm telling you,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

41
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,854
Yeah, I wonder how far
it is to the nearest cheese burger?

42
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,180
We don't usually get folk up this
way. Where're you heading?

43
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:42,980
California. L.A. Movie stars and
fancy cars.

44
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:47,813
California! You're sure off the
beaten track for that.

45
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:50,617
Yeah, well we're just making a stop
'round here for some....

46
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:52,699
You know this place out there in the
desert?

47
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:53,379
Why?

48
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:55,174
Hey mister. You got a bathroom
around here?

49
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:56,814
Yeah, 'round in back. 'Round in
back.

50
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:58,933
You need to make a litter dump. You
got a place to throw some trash?

51
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:02,179
Oh, hell! Use the whole damn desert
for all I care.

52
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,821
Oh, I'm sorry Bob.
You have your key? Good.

53
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,208
How are my two baby girls doing?

54
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:10,537
Fabulous.

55
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,656
Hey little piggy.

56
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:37,456
So anyway we thought we'd take a
little detour and go see it.

57
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:40,094
It's supposed to be a real silver
mine.

58
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:42,333
Well anyway, that's why I was asking.

59
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:45,004
You see, it's my Aunt Mildred's gift
to Bob and me.

60
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:47,412
On our silver anniversary,
and that's tomorrow.

61
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:50,736
Lady there ain't no silver left back
in there.

62
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:53,814
Besides, the Air Force uses part of
this as a gunnery range.

63
00:05:56,496 --> 00:05:59,056
You folks just forget about that
foolishness and go on to California.

64
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,287
That'll be six eighty.
- Ok.

65
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,412
I got no change.
- Well, that figured.

66
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:10,127
Detective, huh?
- That's right

67
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:12,254
Bob just retired from
the Police Force.

68
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:14,847
He had to a little early,
because of his heart.

69
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,884
Refer us to Dry Creek Road.
You know where that is?

70
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:20,126
Look Mister, don't take your family
back in there.

71
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,528
The silver's been gone 40 years now.

72
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:25,450
Besides, there's nothing in there
but animals.

73
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:28,886
Animals! You mean nobody lives back
there?

74
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,968
Nobody you'd want to meet lady,
believe me...

75
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:39,362
See, there's nothing back here.
Jees, look at this place.

76
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:48,966
What's the matter? You see
something? Ughh. What?

77
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,401
Not me. I didn't do anything wrong.
I was trying to trade.

78
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:56,601
He was goin' away...

79
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,686
Big mouth.

80
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:04,997
Come here! Come here!
Hold it! Come here!

81
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:16,806
Come on Doug! Come on! He must
have some animals back there.

82
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:24,485
Come on! Come on!

83
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:28,241
Come on!

84
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:42,076
You better check your grandchildren
back there mister.

85
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:44,514
I think one of them's cut himself
on the window back there.

86
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:45,679
I'll check it. Thanks.

87
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:46,554
That's Ok.

88
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:53,276
You folks go right to California
and have a good trip.

89
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,677
You folks stay on the main road now,
you hear?

90
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:03,676
Stay on the main road!

91
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:37,148
Let's get out of here!

92
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:40,873
What ...!

93
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:46,155
Oh, Lord ...

94
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:54,586
There'll be hell to pay now.

95
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:08,508
Jupiter? Pappa?

96
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:11,989
Identified...

97
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:16,542
Mamma? Pluto do you see
that station wagon and its trailer?

98
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:19,507
That's what Mercury said.
If you can believe him.

99
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:21,112
They're coming

100
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:29,502
We're lost. The old creep told you
not to get off the road.

101
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:33,701
Well, the old bastard probably snuck
up there and ripped off our mine.

102
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:35,503
And that's why he doesn't want us
up here

103
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:38,306
We'll be French fries,
human French fries!

104
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,946
We are not going to be French fries.

105
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:44,348
We're right here someplace
on this little blue road.

106
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,699
Mother, this road is not a blue line.

107
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,027
It's a dotted line if it's on the map
at all.

108
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:56,547
Jees...

109
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,700
Nellis Air Force Base and Nuclear
Testing Site, close to the public...

110
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:02,978
Holy shit Daddy!

111
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:05,180
All right, everybody shut up!
That's it!

112
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:07,579
Man alive!

113
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:11,588
We're not on a bomb range and
we're not Goddamn lost!

114
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:12,781
And we are not ...

115
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,297
Jesus Christ in a crunch!
What was that?

116
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,134
Daddy! Slow down a bit, will you?

117
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:32,543
Daddy we're going to lose
the trailer

118
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:01,220
You and your stupid
silver mine.

119
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,661
Doug are you OK?

120
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:06,057
Open the door.
I think the door is jammed.

121
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:08,218
Why don't you try unlocking it creep.

122
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:10,412
Oh, I got it...

123
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,136
Are you OK?

124
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,378
Whew! I feel like I've been through
my first California earthquake.

125
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,936
How's the baby?

126
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,414
She's fine. Mum's got her.

127
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:27,730
Well, I think we were lucky.

128
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:29,574
My finch is OK?

129
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:30,529
Aren't you even going to ask how I
am?

130
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,377
Oh, get out of my life Bobby.

131
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:33,647
Look, I'm wounded...

132
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,450
What is it?

133
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,333
Let's catch it folks

134
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,052
You'r going to get...
- OK, look out...

135
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:41,657
What are you doing stupid?

136
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:56,651
For 25 years I'm a cop in the worst
damn precinct in Cleveland.

137
00:11:57,937 --> 00:11:59,655
Niggers shoot arrows at me and ...

138
00:11:59,856 --> 00:12:02,416
the hillbillies throw dogs
off the roof at me.

139
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:07,006
I'm even shot at on two separate
occasions by my own men.

140
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:11,770
But none of these bastards ever come
as close to killing me as my own

141
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:15,570
Goddamn wife and her Goddamn road
maps, and her wrong turns, ...

142
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:18,129
and her Goddamn hysterical
screaming, and her....

143
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:22,649
Watch your language!
And you watch your heart too ...

144
00:12:22,694 --> 00:12:24,844
You know what Dr. Springer said...

145
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:28,125
Well Dr. Springer can take his
stethoscope and shove it...

146
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,604
...into his little black bag.
Sorry babe ...

147
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:49,366
It's a turkey buzzard.
It's the janitor of the desert.

148
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,805
Does that mean there's a town
nearby?

149
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,362
Like when sailors spot a bird at sea
and know they're near land?

150
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:56,808
Yeah.

151
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,560
No.

152
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:49,235
It's pretty ... Pretty girl ...

153
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:51,117
Blew the hitch right off the back.

154
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:58,437
What's the verdict big fella?

155
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,121
Well, the damn axle's snapped...

156
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:02,358
Oh, no...

157
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:03,551
Forget it, forget it.

158
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,320
What do we do now?

159
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:06,956
We walk baby.

160
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:11,474
Do you know that Marlin Perkins says

161
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,877
that rattlesnakes can reach lengths
of 20 feet.

162
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:15,560
And can kill you in 8 minutes.

163
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:20,514
Then you better not
shoot till you see the whites

164
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:21,756
... of their fangs son.

165
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,236
Or was it 8 feet and 20 minutes...
- Oh, Ma.

166
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,514
Thank goodness the boys at
the precinct presented me with this

167
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,675
howlitzer when I retired.

168
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,716
Sure wouldn't want to go looking for
those pythons without it.

169
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,913
If it's all the same to you
Bob Carter, ...

170
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:40,111
I'll put my faith in the good Lord
and a little gunpowder.

171
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:43,071
Rather than in coyotes and
rattlesnakes ...

172
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,509
This place must be crawling with
them.

173
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,913
How are you taking this?

174
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:52,552
You ok?

175
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,430
I hate it out here.

176
00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:56,628
Just uncomfortable, that's all.

177
00:14:56,837 --> 00:14:58,475
It's more than uncomfortable...

178
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:05,872
Lynne! Honey! Could you get me my
jacket, please.

179
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:56,066
What is it?
- Nothing

180
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,100
I don't get it. Why can't we raise
anybody on the CV ...

181
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,822
Here.

182
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:03,304
Well, it looks to me like these
hills are full of iron.

183
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,660
And if that's the case you're not going
to get a regular signal past them.

184
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,939
Would you hold this please?

185
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,184
I'm going to head North, ...

186
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:10,823
something on the map looks like
a military installation ...

187
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:12,098
Ok, fine.

188
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,300
You ought to have a gun too Doug.

189
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:15,658
We only have two guns, ...

190
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,541
and I think one of them ought
to stay with you guys.

191
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:21,297
All right Doug. You walk out
6 or 7 miles and get back.

192
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:23,702
I'll walk out as far as the old
geezers service station ...

193
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:26,182
You can't get there and back before
dark.

194
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:30,063
It's only 15 miles back. Sweetheart
I'll get there about sundown.

195
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,064
If the old guy's there,
I'll borrow his pickup.

196
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,415
If he's not there,
I'll borrow his phone.

197
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,457
But, what if the old jerk
doesn't have a phone?

198
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,098
Then I'll hum.

199
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:37,662
Daddy, don't!

200
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,858
Now look you stay close to the
trailer and don't bust Bobby's chops.

201
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,215
He is in charge.

202
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:43,778
The creep isn't in charge of me.

203
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:46,977
Hey, another outburst like that and
I'll confine you to quarters.

204
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,857
All right men let's synchronise
watches.

205
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:50,941
It's three thirty eight.

206
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:52,894
If you're not back by midnight, ...

207
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,298
we'll have to board the submarine
with out you.

208
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,295
Can we have a word of prayer first?

209
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,295
Oh, Mother! For crying in a bucket ...

210
00:16:58,503 --> 00:16:59,015
Brenda!

211
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:05,855
Just to ask the Lord to watch over
us all. Is that too much to ask ...

212
00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:08,897
Bob?

213
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:23,661
Heavenly Father we ask you to look
over us ... So long ...

214
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:25,658
See you ...
- Bye ...

215
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,575
Pluto ...

216
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,218
This looks good. Easy pickings now.

217
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,976
Beauty! Come here girl!

218
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:11,136
Come on Beauty, come on
Beauty ... come on Beauty, come on

219
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:16,334
Well, at least it's cooler now. Oh,
bring some plates will you Bobby?

220
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:17,285
Sure.

221
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:20,653
It is cooler, isn't it?

222
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:22,765
Oh, yeah, fantastic!
Now we'll all freeze to death.

223
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,490
What a great way to spend the eve of
your 25th Wedding Anniversary.

224
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:30,127
Frozen French fries.

225
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:35,283
A huge clump of human French fries
was found stuck to a camper trailer

226
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:38,770
this morning by...
...by whoever finds us.

227
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:40,452
Well, it's kind of a pretty place.

228
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:43,766
There's certainly plenty of sunshine
and fresh air.

229
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:45,451
Fresh air is unhealthy...

230
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:46,369
Oh, it's good for you.

231
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,847
Makes me want to puke, if you really
want to know.

232
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:51,321
It gives me the creeps.

233
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,408
I suppose it's my fault we got lost.

234
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,485
Mamma, don't be ridiculous.

235
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:58,888
It was Daddy's idea to go looking
for this mine without any help.

236
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:02,128
We'd be in California now if
we'd stayed on the interstate.

237
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,890
Oh, showers ... and gin and tonics ...

238
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,000
The beach ...

239
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,522
I wonder what's bugging her?

240
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:15,527
Maybe there's some rattlesnakes
prowling around ...

241
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:19,085
You know what Freud would say about
your obsession with rattlesnakes Ma ...

242
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:23,445
I wonder why
the Beast isn't chiming in?

243
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,957
Beast never barks until he's ready
for the kill.

244
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,443
He likes to catch his victims
unawares.

245
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:32,560
Hey you know you're right. Remember
that poodle he killed in Miami.

246
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:33,199
Do I!

247
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,602
Boy wasn't that lady ever fit to be
tied.

248
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,483
Was Daddy ever mad. He had to pay
Vet bills for a dead poodle.

249
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:46,162
All right creep, what's your story?

250
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:52,999
Hey, don't! Beauty get back here!
Beauty!

251
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:54,193
Bobby!

252
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:05,512
Beauty!

253
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:13,675
Here Beauty, here Beauty. Come here,
come here girl.

254
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:14,598
Beauty!

255
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:21,473
Hey pig. Come here! Beauty,
come here.

256
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:32,679
Beauty!

257
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,109
Beauty! ... Hey girl....

258
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:32,384
Beauty!

259
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:46,703
Bobby!

260
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:49,621
Do you hear him answer?

261
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:53,990
No.

262
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:59,545
Bobby! Come down!

263
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:05,464
Bobby! Come down!

264
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:13,698
Beauty!

265
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:31,537
Here...

266
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:35,734
Oh, thanks. It's dropped 20 degrees
in the last hour.

267
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,770
I thought I ran out.

268
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,057
Hello. Anybody there?

269
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,096
Testing, testing... Maypole, ...

270
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:53,457
This is Mamma Bear Carter calling.

271
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:55,456
Do any of you bears
have your ears up?

272
00:23:55,659 --> 00:24:01,450
Gosh, I can't seem to remember
how this works ...

273
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:04,331
It's mayday Mamma, not maypole ...

274
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:08,730
Mayday ...
Did you check the battery?

275
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:20,129
Here, let me. Mayday, mayday,
this is mobile unit 2345 Z 0.

276
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:22,896
We are stranded and in need of help.

277
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,210
Do you copy?

278
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,252
What in the hell was that?

279
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:39,842
It sounded like some sort of animal.

280
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:46,809
Yeah well, if animals 'round here
are smart enough to run radios,

281
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:48,765
we're up shit creek without a paddle.

282
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:53,288
You know you never used
language like that ...

283
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,084
before you moved to New York City.

284
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:57,169
Where's Bobby and the men, anyway?

285
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:21,718
Brenda!

286
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:30,839
Brenda!

287
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:34,127
Bobby!

288
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:41,356
Beast come back here, ...

289
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:44,836
Beast!

290
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:49,400
Bobby!

291
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:52,678
Brenda! You there?

292
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:55,598
Just a minute Lynne.

293
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,204
Bobby!

294
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:17,792
Bobby!

295
00:26:27,282 --> 00:26:28,840
How does this damn thing work
anyway?

296
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:37,916
Bobby!

297
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:46,589
Bobby!

298
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,989
Where have you been?

299
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,631
Bobby your face, what happened?
Bobby?

300
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:51,586
Get your stupid neck out
of that belt you jackass.

301
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:57,662
I'd a left you hanging there
if you took a shot at me.

302
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,222
Not until you tell me what the hell
is going on.

303
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:07,181
You're trespassing. That's what.
Give me that!

304
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:10,218
You always try to stop trespassers
by hanging yourself?

305
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:15,978
I thought you were somebody else.
How's your family?

306
00:29:16,183 --> 00:29:18,981
Well the car skidded off the road
and we broke an axle.

307
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:21,175
They're back at the trailer.
They're all ok.

308
00:29:21,383 --> 00:29:23,613
Like hell! Give me that booze.

309
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,255
There's something
you should know about.

310
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:28,931
Yeah, well, what is it?

311
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:39,372
Come on Beast.
Are Daddy and Doug back yet?

312
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:43,738
Not yet. Didn't you find Beauty?

313
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:49,497
She must have run off.
Give me that!

314
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,218
Come here!

315
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,690
Bobby ...
- Good Lord. How are you? ...

316
00:30:08,218 --> 00:30:11,654
Back in '29,
this place was spanking new.

317
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:14,853
Me and my wife Martha had ...

318
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,335
a baby so cuddly and so pretty
we couldn't believe.

319
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,696
And another kid on the way.

320
00:30:22,497 --> 00:30:25,569
But when Martha had this one.
Something went wrong.

321
00:30:27,097 --> 00:30:34,447
This thing she gave me... Something
happened... He was so big.

322
00:30:37,575 --> 00:30:41,204
He came out sideways and almost tore
poor Martha apart.

323
00:30:43,654 --> 00:30:46,691
He weighed 20 pounds and
was hairy as a monkey.

324
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:51,486
When he was 10 years old,
he was big as I was.

325
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,129
Accidents would happen all the time.

326
00:30:57,093 --> 00:30:58,492
Dogs falling into wells.

327
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:01,048
I even found chickens with their
heads bitten off.

328
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:05,852
Then in August of '39, I was in town
getting supplies.

329
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:09,884
The whole damn house burned
to the ground.

330
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:14,602
My little baby girl was a cinder
when I found her.

331
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:18,599
But this monster kid wasn't even
singed. I knew he'd done it.

332
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:22,121
I hit him with a tyre iron and
I split his face wide open.

333
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,123
How bad was it?

334
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:32,369
I thought I'd killed him. I was afraid
they'd come and take me away.

335
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:35,883
So I took him out on that desert and
I left him there.

336
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,522
I figured if he wasn't dead,
he couldn't live more than two hours

337
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:42,877
out there in that heat.

338
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:45,241
Then it would all be over with.

339
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:48,041
And you think his ghost is still
trying to track you?

340
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,282
That was a long time ago.

341
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:53,082
Long enough for him to steal a whore
that nobody would miss.

342
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:56,245
Long enough to raise a pack
of wild kids.

343
00:31:57,486 --> 00:32:00,364
Long enough for a devil kid
to grow up and be a devil man.

344
00:32:09,725 --> 00:32:11,522
What the hell is this?

345
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:13,681
That's some stuff ...

346
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,908
You want some cheese on this?
There's plenty left.

347
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:17,551
I don't want anything.

348
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,676
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

349
00:33:20,877 --> 00:33:22,105
I'm just not hungry.

350
00:33:23,717 --> 00:33:25,070
Your face still bothering you?

351
00:33:25,277 --> 00:33:29,429
No. Did anybody try the CV while
I was gone?

352
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:32,150
We tried, we tried. Nothing.

353
00:33:33,557 --> 00:33:38,108
Well, one time we got something that
sounded like an obscene caller.

354
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:40,345
What do you mean?

355
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:45,504
It sounded like sort of heavy
breathing. Didn't it Mum?

356
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,351
It ah... it was static,

357
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:52,544
It wasn't.

358
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:57,909
What was that?

359
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:28,388
Oh, Jesus! What's going on?

360
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:53,747
Daddy! ... Daddy!

361
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,898
You son of a bitch

362
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:27,423
Daddy! Daddy!
Chest hurts? ... All fall down.

363
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,300
Over here, ...

364
00:35:48,341 --> 00:35:56,214
Dirty old gun, ...
Dirty old gun.

365
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,499
Pluto?

366
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,930
Pappa Jupe?

367
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,096
Pappa Jupe. We about ready.

368
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,050
Hey! Ah, you mind pointing that
thing somewhere else?

369
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:43,612
Thank you.

370
00:36:46,775 --> 00:36:48,288
Whew, it gets cold out there.

371
00:36:53,135 --> 00:36:54,488
Here, I bought you a present.

372
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:00,368
What's the matter with you?

373
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:04,090
Well, for one thing,
Dad's not back yet.

374
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:07,684
Oh, hell. I wouldn't expect him
this early.

375
00:37:08,413 --> 00:37:10,051
He had a lot further to go than
I did.

376
00:37:11,012 --> 00:37:13,765
Besides, it's slow going out there.
Where are the dogs?

377
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,008
Beast broke his chain about
an hour ago and he ran off.

378
00:37:18,212 --> 00:37:19,964
Oh yeah.

379
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:26,927
And Beauty....well...Beauty, she....

380
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:28,962
Hey, Doug!

381
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:30,720
Doug's back!

382
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:33,081
I knew when you smelt food
you'd show up.

383
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,360
Hey, gorgeous?

384
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,964
Get out of here.
- Hey ...

385
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,000
How you doing?

386
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,438
Did you find anything?

387
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:45,164
Oh, yeah. Lots of stuff. There's
a ... I found a tower ...

388
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:47,644
And a dump about five miles out
of here.

389
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,203
All kinds of good stuff.
Look at this!

390
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:51,285
Look at all of this!

391
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:54,242
I mean, it's no wonder we're paying
higher taxes, ...

392
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:55,358
they're throwing this stuff away.

393
00:37:55,568 --> 00:37:58,082
Did you go any further?
Did you find any people?

394
00:37:58,287 --> 00:37:59,766
Oh no, there's no people.

395
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:02,640
I couldn't go any further because
the road just stops righ there, ...

396
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,644
... just ended right there.

397
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:06,644
Is there any food left? Because I am
so hungry.

398
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:08,280
Oh, come and get it, come on.
- Ok.

399
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:12,159
Listen, we've got to go out there
because there's enough stuff to open

400
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:13,879
... an army surplus store.
Honest to God ...

401
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:17,881
Ma ...

402
00:39:25,758 --> 00:39:28,875
What's the matter?
You don't like dog anymore?

403
00:39:30,557 --> 00:39:31,672
I like it.

404
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:36,632
Maybe, dog's too good for
a runaway slut like you.

405
00:39:37,437 --> 00:39:40,554
The dog's ghost is talking out
there at night

406
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:49,664
Another dog?

407
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:56,593
Another dog. A great big stud.

408
00:39:58,274 --> 00:40:05,350
Mamma, mamma! Let me come inside.
Mamma!

409
00:40:06,953 --> 00:40:13,188
Good he's around here,
it means he ain't around there.

410
00:40:13,553 --> 00:40:14,508
Where?

411
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,869
Never you mind.

412
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:52,144
Bobby, come on in.
Don't catch a cold.

413
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:01,826
Sure you're all right?
- Fine!

414
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:05,145
Ok.

415
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:14,140
Don't lock that too hard,
we're going out in a second.

416
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:20,424
Hey, where are you going?

417
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:21,862
The sack.

418
00:41:23,186 --> 00:41:25,461
I don't think you should sleep in
the station wagon tonight.

419
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:26,336
Why not?

420
00:41:26,545 --> 00:41:28,661
Look, sleep in here. On the floor.

421
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,183
What? Are you nuts?

422
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:32,739
Look Doug I got to talk to
you ... Where ...

423
00:41:33,585 --> 00:41:34,256
All set?

424
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,863
Yeah, all set.

425
00:41:37,304 --> 00:41:41,582
Hey I guarantee you that
he'll be back here by nine thirty.

426
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:44,820
Bobby's worried that rattlesnakes
are going to get Big Bob.

427
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:46,217
It isn't that...

428
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:51,258
Hey, you better worry about one
big bomb other than rattlesnakes.

429
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:52,531
Come on you.

430
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:02,613
Listen, if he's not back here
by eleven o'clock ...

431
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,539
we'll go out and meet him, ok?

432
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:06,538
Sleep well.

433
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:12,604
I'm scared.

434
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:20,925
Did I hurt you?

435
00:44:37,324 --> 00:44:38,677
Beast?

436
00:44:52,283 --> 00:44:53,033
Beast?

437
00:44:58,202 --> 00:44:59,521
Beast!

438
00:44:59,722 --> 00:45:02,111
Come here boy, come on.

439
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,759
Beast?

440
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:37,516
Beast?

441
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:39,714
Beast?

442
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:44,469
Hey boy. Come here boy.

443
00:45:50,877 --> 00:45:51,787
Just ...

444
00:45:57,795 --> 00:45:59,114
Come on.

445
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:33,709
Stupid ...

446
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,779
Jesus!

447
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:38,824
What do you want?

448
00:48:00,663 --> 00:48:02,972
I mean with the amount of privacy we
get on this trip ...

449
00:48:03,182 --> 00:48:05,821
I'm not the one knocking on windows
in the middle of the night.

450
00:48:12,261 --> 00:48:13,740
All right, this better be good.

451
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,695
I need your keys.
- Oh for crying out loud.

452
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,131
I locked myself out.

453
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,253
Couldn't you wait?

454
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,655
Damn it, give me the keys please.

455
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:41,572
Look something weird is going on
here. Dad's not back yet.

456
00:48:41,778 --> 00:48:44,292
You said you heard heavy breathing
on the CV.

457
00:48:45,178 --> 00:48:47,408
And now the Beast's out there
barking like he's hurt.

458
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:49,370
Oh Bobby, ...

459
00:48:49,577 --> 00:48:52,694
it's probably Beauty, she always
sounds like that when she barks.

460
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:07,771
Beauty's dead. Beauty's been dead
since this afternoon.

461
00:49:08,056 --> 00:49:13,369
Beauty's dead? Well, what happened?
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

462
00:49:14,374 --> 00:49:21,689
I tried ... When I found her,
she'd been gutted.

463
00:49:21,894 --> 00:49:25,011
Somebody slit her, it was pretty bad.

464
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:28,968
I was so scared I ran away.

465
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:33,168
Ok, you just hold on right here.

466
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:35,329
I'll get a flashlight and we'll take
a look.

467
00:49:35,532 --> 00:49:41,164
Come on, come on.
You stay right here.

468
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:42,850
I will not stay here.

469
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:47,241
Do it!

470
00:49:47,451 --> 00:50:01,320
Oh God, help me ...
Help me, put it out.

471
00:50:01,529 --> 00:50:02,803
Don't go out there.
- Let me go ...

472
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:04,684
Ma!

473
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:17,916
Brenda? ... Brenda? ...
Keep an eye on the baby, ok?

474
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:22,048
Right now, help me, ...

475
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:30,246
Hello Jupiter, this here is Mars.

476
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:32,199
You and Pluto in Mars?

477
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:34,442
We in Pappa, we in.

478
00:50:41,845 --> 00:50:43,437
... Help me ...

479
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:58,311
You son of a bitch.

480
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:03,671
You wait, you wait till you get
to be a man.

481
00:52:39,912 --> 00:52:47,466
Baby fat, you fat, bad and juicy.

482
00:53:13,509 --> 00:53:16,626
That's not my Bob ...

483
00:53:16,828 --> 00:53:20,264
He needs some water. He needs some
water. Would you get it please?

484
00:53:20,468 --> 00:53:27,226
That's not my Bob. That's not my
Bob. That's not my Bob.

485
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:33,461
That's not my Bob.
- He wants some water. No it's not Bob.

486
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:37,500
Lynne, Lynne, take her to get some
water, please?

487
00:53:40,386 --> 00:53:41,819
Some whisky and blankets too.

488
00:53:47,384 --> 00:53:48,499
You all right Bobby?

489
00:53:58,263 --> 00:54:00,174
What are you doing? ...
Where are you going?

490
00:54:00,384 --> 00:54:05,174
They got my Father ...
I'm going to get those bastards.

491
00:54:07,183 --> 00:54:08,582
Bobby!
- I will ...

492
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:27,533
It's over Bob.

493
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:36,496
Women coming! Mars!

494
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,531
Just take what we came
for and get out.

495
00:54:42,899 --> 00:54:44,412
Ahhh ... What was that?

496
00:54:44,618 --> 00:54:50,136
Oh, Katy! ... Don't hurt my baby!

497
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:51,453
Get out of the way ...

498
00:55:03,057 --> 00:55:04,331
Get out Ethel!

499
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:51,404
Take the baby.
- You better move your ass.

500
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:15,446
I'll come back for you later girly.

501
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:22,687
It's Ok baby, it's ok ...

502
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:35,446
Don't go baby. Don't go away. Don't
go away.... Ma?

503
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:58,270
Oh Jesus! ... Katy ...

504
00:58:02,397 --> 00:58:04,513
Get her inside
and see to your Mum.

505
00:58:07,477 --> 00:58:09,195
Oh my God!

506
00:58:14,596 --> 00:58:21,035
Why are you doing this? ...
What do you want? ...

507
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:29,911
Damn you!

508
00:58:36,953 --> 00:58:41,583
Give me back my baby! ...
My Katherine ...

509
00:58:49,752 --> 00:58:51,071
Please...

510
00:59:04,351 --> 00:59:05,943
Come on.

511
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,103
He's still got a gun.

512
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,585
Oh yeah, I got the bullets.

513
00:59:19,229 --> 00:59:22,141
Mercury!
You paying attention Mercury?

514
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:28,987
Mercury!

515
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:34,741
Wait a minute, I see you.
You got something to eat.

516
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:36,346
We got something good here Mercury.

517
00:59:39,227 --> 00:59:40,376
Is it a baby?

518
00:59:40,587 --> 00:59:42,418
You be a good dog and
you'll get some.

519
00:59:42,627 --> 00:59:47,542
Mamma Jupe be so happy,
Pappa Jupe be so happy.

520
00:59:48,905 --> 00:59:50,816
Maybe I make ajoke
like last time.

521
00:59:51,026 --> 00:59:52,857
I eat the toes.

522
00:59:54,025 --> 00:59:55,902
You think that everybody laugh?

523
00:59:56,745 --> 01:00:00,784
We always laugh at you Mercury.
Coming through.

524
01:00:24,941 --> 01:00:25,930
What?

525
01:00:26,142 --> 01:00:28,781
I thought I heard something.
Rocks falling.

526
01:00:32,821 --> 01:00:37,656
You got rocks in your head asshole.
Let's go.

527
01:01:03,338 --> 01:01:06,375
I heard you tried to run away.
- No Pappa, no.

528
01:01:06,577 --> 01:01:09,489
I heard you been messin' with
Grandpa Fred.

529
01:01:09,697 --> 01:01:12,165
I fixed Grandpa Fred good.

530
01:01:16,776 --> 01:01:19,370
I like fixing people good.

531
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:30,924
Bobby.

532
01:01:56,412 --> 01:02:00,849
What you got there?
Is that what I think it is?

533
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:02,929
Oh, yeah!

534
01:02:03,131 --> 01:02:05,804
About time we got some powerful
food 'round here.

535
01:02:06,011 --> 01:02:06,966
We're going to eat it too.

536
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:10,004
Call in Mercury.
We don't need no watch no more.

537
01:02:10,211 --> 01:02:10,882
Ok Pappa.

538
01:02:11,091 --> 01:02:14,766
We caught us a young.
Thanks giving turkey.

539
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:21,325
What are we going to do?
They have our food, our ammo.

540
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,565
They killed Dad and Lynne,
they have the baby ...

541
01:02:23,769 --> 01:02:25,248
and they're going to be back.

542
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:29,242
What are we going to do?

543
01:02:35,888 --> 01:02:37,560
She hasn't said a word all night.

544
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:42,682
He don't answer Pappa Jupe.

545
01:02:42,887 --> 01:02:47,278
Don't answer? Maybe you don't know
how to work it right.

546
01:02:47,487 --> 01:02:50,081
I don't think that's it. I told you.
I heard something.

547
01:02:54,245 --> 01:02:55,519
You heard what?

548
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:57,317
I'll go find him.

549
01:03:04,485 --> 01:03:05,964
You go do that.

550
01:03:13,324 --> 01:03:17,078
Did you kill them
all like I told you to?

551
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:21,679
Did you kill them all like I said?

552
01:03:25,642 --> 01:03:28,236
It's such a small place a trailer.

553
01:03:29,522 --> 01:03:32,434
When it's messy it's so messy.

554
01:03:33,842 --> 01:03:35,400
Yeah.

555
01:03:37,361 --> 01:03:38,999
Daddy back yet?

556
01:03:40,481 --> 01:03:41,709
No, not yet.

557
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,676
Where's the kids? Bed yet?

558
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,514
Ah, yeah. Brenda's right here.
Bobby's in the kitchen.

559
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:04,549
Drinking Coke, I bet.
Is Lynne asleep?

560
01:04:05,678 --> 01:04:06,827
Yeah.

561
01:04:11,038 --> 01:04:12,471
I'll get you tucked in.

562
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:18,233
Another blanket. Do you have one?
It's all gone chilly.

563
01:04:20,037 --> 01:04:23,074
This'll keep you warm.
This'll keep you nice and warm.

564
01:04:25,036 --> 01:04:26,435
Ohh, thank you.

565
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:35,711
Oh, no. Turn the lights on, please.

566
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:37,473
Oh Christ, the battery must be dead.

567
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:39,027
Bobby I'm scared!

568
01:04:39,234 --> 01:04:40,667
Let's check the lantern.

569
01:04:40,874 --> 01:04:44,662
He's coming back for me.
Don't let him get me Bobby!

570
01:04:44,874 --> 01:04:45,784
Shut up, will you.

571
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:48,704
I can hear him outside ...

572
01:04:55,513 --> 01:04:56,582
It's Ok.

573
01:04:59,992 --> 01:05:01,710
Maybe I got that son of a bitch

574
01:05:03,631 --> 01:05:07,419
Mercury, Mercury are you all right?
Mercury, where are you?

575
01:05:33,869 --> 01:05:36,178
Hello, hello Papa Jupe?

576
01:05:38,308 --> 01:05:40,344
Hold on Pluto, I'll get him.

577
01:05:42,868 --> 01:05:45,257
The Beast! Does that sound like
Beast to you?

578
01:05:45,467 --> 01:05:47,697
I don't think it was.
- Yeah, I think it was.

579
01:05:48,867 --> 01:05:50,585
I'm telling you they can do
the Beast perfect.

580
01:06:03,425 --> 01:06:05,097
Bobby, is it all right?

581
01:06:10,984 --> 01:06:15,455
What are you trying to do?
Get off me.

582
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,897
Where have you been, huh?
Where have you been?

583
01:06:20,104 --> 01:06:21,093
Did you bring this?

584
01:06:21,983 --> 01:06:24,417
This is Jupiter, what did you find?

585
01:06:25,343 --> 01:06:28,380
Mercury's dead Papa. He's at the
bottom of the cliff.

586
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:32,622
Mercury dead! Did he fall?

587
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,255
He was pushed.

588
01:06:34,462 --> 01:06:38,455
Pushed! Who the hell pushed my boy?

589
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:43,819
The devil dog. The big bastard's
paws are right on Mercury's chest.

590
01:06:45,341 --> 01:06:48,890
Pluto, you come back here.
We got some things to do.

591
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,738
Do you understand what I'm saying?

592
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,615
I'm coming Papa

593
01:06:57,459 --> 01:07:01,338
Your dog mad sport of my blood
you pig.

594
01:07:03,579 --> 01:07:05,331
I'm going to kill your kids for that.

595
01:07:07,498 --> 01:07:10,854
You come out here and stick
your life in my face.

596
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:17,489
Stick your fingers in my pie.
That was a bad mistake.

597
01:07:20,177 --> 01:07:25,171
I thought you were smart and tough.
You're stupid.

598
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:26,570
Yeah, you sure are.

599
01:07:27,657 --> 01:07:28,612
You're nothing.

600
01:07:32,736 --> 01:07:36,649
I'm going to watch
your Goddamn car run down.

601
01:07:36,855 --> 01:07:38,891
Good Papa, tell him.

602
01:07:41,815 --> 01:07:45,046
I see the wind blow your dried up
seeds away.

603
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:52,291
I'll eat the heart of your stinking
memory.

604
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:55,892
I'll eat the brains of your kids'
kids.

605
01:07:56,533 --> 01:07:59,252
I'm in you're out.

606
01:08:01,973 --> 01:08:03,042
Yeah Papa.

607
01:08:03,253 --> 01:08:05,130
You keep an eye on that young
tenderloin baby.

608
01:08:06,492 --> 01:08:08,960
I don't want nothing happening to
her less I say so.

609
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:11,685
You need me Papa, I'm going with you.

610
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:16,089
I don't care.
Well you got that cut on your leg.

611
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:18,885
A blood pipe as big as your thumb.

612
01:08:19,091 --> 01:08:20,524
It's a good place to cut somebody, ...

613
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,641
but not such a good place to get cut
there yourself.

614
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:30,048
I got a feeling that tenderloin
Daddy gonna come looking for her.

615
01:08:30,249 --> 01:08:30,886
Yeah...

616
01:08:31,089 --> 01:08:31,965
You can take care of him then

617
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:35,320
I'll rip his lungs out.
- Yeah...

618
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:40,283
You do that. You got bullets
for that there gun.

619
01:08:40,888 --> 01:08:42,003
It's all loaded Papa.

620
01:08:44,848 --> 01:08:48,318
It's getting light out.
Let's get started.

621
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:56,194
Bobby? Bobby, you read me?

622
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,910
Bobby?

623
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,953
This is a breaker one niner for KUY
ninety five thirty two ...

624
01:10:12,519 --> 01:10:15,192
Mayday, mayday God damn it mayday ...

This is breaker one niner for KUY

626
01:10:26,477 --> 01:10:27,148

627
01:10:29,956 --> 01:10:33,266
This is a breaker one niner for KUY
ninety five thirty two.

628
01:10:33,477 --> 01:10:39,552
Does anybody read this, we need
police help. Mayday, may ...

629
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:42,425
Look Brenda, will you keep it down?

630
01:10:49,314 --> 01:10:51,191
Oh no.

631
01:11:04,513 --> 01:11:08,392
It's pretty quiet.
- Think they'll run for it.

632
01:11:08,593 --> 01:11:10,106
I wouldn't be surprised.

633
01:11:10,312 --> 01:11:14,146
Hello Police Air Force, this is KUY
ninety five thirty two calling ...

634
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,189
Mayday, Mayday ...

635
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:26,460
Hello KUY, this is Air Force rescue,
we have you loud and clear.

636
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:31,141
What's up?
- Hello. Listen, we're under attack.

637
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,068
I don't know who, they've killed two,

638
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:35,740
three of us and they kidnapped
a baby.

639
01:11:35,949 --> 01:11:42,787
Ok, Ok, hold on. What are your
defensive capabilities at this time?

640
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:46,986
One gun and I only have two bullets
left.

641
01:11:47,188 --> 01:11:49,338
We don't have any hunting rifles, we
don't have anything.

642
01:11:49,548 --> 01:11:51,061
You gotta help us, we're sitting
ducks.

643
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:53,222
Standby...

644
01:11:53,787 --> 01:11:55,266
Tell them who we are...

645
01:11:57,227 --> 01:12:00,264
We are recommending that till
we can get to you, ...

646
01:12:00,467 --> 01:12:02,059
you just stand on your head ...

647
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:05,341
Stand on our heads, ah, that's code
four ...

648
01:12:05,546 --> 01:12:08,344
Stand on your heads with your thumbs
up your asses.

649
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:11,454
Oh Bobby.

650
01:12:15,825 --> 01:12:18,862
What are your defensive
capabilities at this time?

651
01:12:19,785 --> 01:12:21,377
Their just sitting ducks.

652
01:12:21,585 --> 01:12:24,622
We'll go in through that wash.
They'll never see us coming.

653
01:12:39,382 --> 01:12:45,059
Mars I've seen some signs,
you might have a visitor.

654
01:12:45,262 --> 01:12:47,014
Keep your eyes open.

655
01:12:47,222 --> 01:12:47,813
Ok.

656
01:12:50,621 --> 01:12:57,299
Bobby, do you read me? Bobby,
they're coming your way.

657
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,576
For Christ's sake kid put
your ears on.

658
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:09,610
Come here fella, come here. Listen,
it's your turn to be bad, OK?

659
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:13,129
So you go and get them, OK? Go, go!

660
01:13:25,177 --> 01:13:27,975
Maybe the real Air Force will see
this and come.

661
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:30,890
Forget it.

662
01:13:34,816 --> 01:13:36,010
Nobody's going to help us.

663
01:13:38,616 --> 01:13:40,174
We've got to get out
of this ourselves.

664
01:13:41,616 --> 01:13:45,768
Well, if you've got any bright ideas
girl, just sing right out.

665
01:14:08,973 --> 01:14:10,326
How strong is this anyway.

666
01:14:10,532 --> 01:14:12,648
Tight, why?
- Come on, I got an idea.

667
01:16:20,318 --> 01:16:22,752
Mars?
- Did you get them?

668
01:16:22,919 --> 01:16:24,068
Kill the baby!

669
01:16:28,478 --> 01:16:29,911
Ruby?
- What do you want?

670
01:16:31,797 --> 01:16:33,753
Get it out here!
- What?

671
01:16:36,797 --> 01:16:38,674
You know what.
- What?

672
01:16:39,397 --> 01:16:42,628
Just get it out here!
- What's going on?

673
01:16:47,876 --> 01:16:50,754
Don't unwrap it till I'm away.
I don't want to see it.

674
01:17:01,514 --> 01:17:03,266
Ruby!

675
01:17:06,193 --> 01:17:07,182
Where is she?

676
01:17:13,153 --> 01:17:16,031
Katy! ... Katy!

677
01:17:18,392 --> 01:17:20,064
Ruby!

678
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:26,341
Ruby!

679
01:17:34,511 --> 01:17:38,390
Who are you? What are you doing?
- Your baby!

680
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:42,505
Get out of here!

681
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:55,982
Oh we can't do this.

682
01:17:59,068 --> 01:18:04,301
Hold her.
It's the only way to be sure.

683
01:18:32,145 --> 01:18:36,263
Fuck the devil dog.
You son of a bitch.

684
01:18:37,944 --> 01:18:40,458
You piece of shit.
I'll kill you bitch.

685
01:18:41,623 --> 01:18:44,342
I'll kill you.
I'll take your heart out.

686
01:18:44,543 --> 01:18:49,059
Puke eater. I'll strangle you with
your own guts.

687
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:41,883
Fire it up.

688
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,125
Please!

Do it!

690
01:21:15,967 --> 01:21:17,525
It's working.

691
01:21:28,486 --> 01:21:29,236
Shit!

692
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:39,119

01:21:59,202 --> 01:22:01,272
I'll get you. I'll get you.

01:22:04,642 --> 01:22:06,280
OK, I'm through.

698
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:28,710
Come on!

699
01:22:54,396 --> 01:22:56,910
Where are you going?

01:22:57,115 --> 01:23:01,666
Bobby, don't. Bobby no wait!

01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:05,152
Bobby don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:10,588
Kill him Bobby!
Kill him! ... Kill him!

703
01:23:10,794 --> 01:23:15,629
Don't go in there! Bobby he's dead.
He's dead Bobby.

704
01:24:17,987 --> 01:24:20,342
Take the baby and hide. Hide!

705
01:24:54,143 --> 01:24:55,292
Die boy.

706
01:25:35,259 --> 01:25:37,375

01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:56,334
Oh shit!

01:25:56,537 --> 01:26:00,007
You got yourself sat right
where they breed boy.

01:26:07,016 --> 01:26:10,531
Mars, beat me ...

01:26:10,735 --> 01:26:11,770
Take me ...

711
01:26:12,735 --> 01:26:14,009
You ain't worth taking Ruby ...

712
01:26:14,214 --> 01:26:17,331
Leave him alone ... Take me!

713
01:26:27,253 --> 01:26:28,129
Mars!

714
01:26:28,613 --> 01:26:29,523

01:26:30,413 --> 01:26:31,289
Mars!

716
01:26:40,171 --> 01:26:47,361
No, no. Katy. No.

717
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:28,004
You son of a bitch.

718
01:27:28,206 --> 01:27:29,116
You got ten seconds to live.

719
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:31,045
