on some goddamn shoes?

183
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:39,366
I mean, what kind of fucking
diamonds they got in 'em?

184
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,768
Don't make no sense, man.
She's the one

185
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:42,770
that should be paying me,
not the other way around.

186
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:44,505
- (whispers): He's talking so much.
- Hear me out, bro.

187
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:46,774
I been eating
all this nasty-ass healthy food

188
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:49,376
for about a month now,
and then on top of that,

189
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:51,512
on top of that,
I been working out

190
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:52,913
- every other day.
- You want to try?

191
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,414
I ain't missed a day yet.

192
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,650
I mean, shit, look at me.
I mean, I know I look

193
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:58,919
chiseled like a Greek god, bro.
You can't tell me

194
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:00,420
- no different.
- You skipped a couple days, Merk.

195
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:01,989
MERK:
Ain't that some bullshit.

196
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:03,957
- Whoa, man!
- (Jessie and Antonio laugh)

197
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:05,793
Come on, man.
What the fuck you doing?

198
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,461
Hey, man, chill.
I wasn't gonna let her.

199
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:08,796
- Somebody find a goddamn babysitter.
- Hey.

200
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:10,764
- Just let the girl tattoo you.
- MERK: What?

201
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:12,533
- All right, you done. Get the hell out of here.
- Shit.

202
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:13,934
- Q: Get your whining ass out the chair.
- MERK: Well,

203
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,569
you come sit right here
and let her tattoo you,

204
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:17,070
- goddamn it.
- You want to do one on me?

205
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:18,572
- Let me see this shit.
- MERK: Look at it, bro.

206
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:20,641
- Really? - Yeah.
- Shit look dope, huh?

207
00:11:20,674 --> 00:11:22,509
That look like a dog
took a shit on your back.

208
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:24,478
- That's what it looks like.
- Fuck you, bro. All day,

209
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:25,712
- you've been giving me shit.
- Why is you putting that on?

210
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:27,114
What you mean?
You want to see me naked?

211
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:28,749
Q: You got to clean it
and wrap it.

212
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:30,751
If you knew what I was dealing
with on a regular day...

213
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:32,553
- Put it on my hand right here.
- Q: That's why I don't want

214
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:34,087
- to shake your hand, Merk.
- I don't want to shake

215
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:36,790
- your raggedy hand, either.
- You know I can get shut down

216
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:38,358
- for this shit.
- MERK: Hey, chill out, man.

217
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:39,960
They're having a parent-child

218
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:41,495
bonding moment.
Don't mess that up.

219
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:43,030
JACCI: How would you know
what that is?

220
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:44,364
Your mama done dropped you
on your head.

221
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:45,632
- (laughs)
- MERK: Ooh, watch it,

222
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,501
sweetheart.
I'll come back by tomorrow

223
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:48,969
and shut this whole place down.

224
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,904
You better have papers
for Rodrigo's ass over here,

225
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:52,606
- 'cause I'll deport him, too.
- RODRIGO: Bitch,

226
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,442
I was born here,
old ugly-ass motherfucker.

227
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:57,711
Shut the fuck up, you
meth head-looking motherfucker.

228
00:11:57,744 --> 00:12:00,480
- Ooh.
- Q: Please, stupid motherfucker.

229
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:02,449
- Good job.
- JACCI: Antonio,

230
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:04,051
you wanted to talk?

231
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:05,519
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,554
Hey, stay right here, okay?

233
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:10,891
- What you need?
- You know, I'm having

234
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,993
a baby soon, and, uh,
you know, I was just wondering

235
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,796
if maybe, you know, you could
float me some clients.

236
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,465
I'm... I'm just
a little tight on cash.

237
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:19,733
How can you ask me for favors

238
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:21,768
when you haven't paid
your station fees?

239
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,172
Yeah. Okay.

240
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,572
I'm working on it.

241
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:28,575
- Is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

242
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:30,644
What's that thing do?

243
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:32,913
Oh, this? This so the bad guys
can't hurt me.

244
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:34,148
You see,

245
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:37,151
we got a lot of bad people
in this country.

246
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:39,653
So, my job

247
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:41,521
is to find them
and kick 'em out.

248
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:43,123
Q:
Why would you tell her that?

249
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:44,491
She asked me a question.

250
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:46,059
The only bad guy in here
is you, Merk.

251
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,628
Rent-a-cop-looking-ass
motherfucker.

252
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:49,496
- Yeah, Merk!
- Q: Yeah, Merk.

253
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,598
- You have bad tattoos.
- You're supposed to be on my side.

254
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:53,033
RODRIGO: Stay out,
deporting motherfucker.

255
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,801
Shit, I'm going to work right
now. I'm done with y'all.

256
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:56,970
- How's your mom been, Jess?
- JESSIE: She's good.

257
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:59,439
How come
you don't visit anymore?

258
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:01,608
You got to ask your mama that.

259
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:05,179
What is this place?

260
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:06,480
Where we going?

261
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:08,782
Uh, it's my secret spot.

262
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:10,584
- Really?
- Yeah.

263
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,586
Not even your mama know.

264
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,222
JESSIE (whispers):
Really?

265
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:15,856
ANTONIO:
See?

266
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,958
- Look at this.
- Hey.

267
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:24,097
- Can I go in?
- You want to swim with the gators?

268
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:26,099
- Yeah.
- I mean, if you think you brave.

269
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:28,035
(Jessie chuckles)

270
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:30,804
(both grunt)

271
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:32,906
Which rock?

272
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:35,143
(Antonio laughs)

273
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:37,678
- Seriously.
- You trying to skip a rock?

274
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:39,713
There's no skipping
right there.

275
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:41,149
That just went
straight to the bottom.

276
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,951
JESSIE (laughs):
Yeah.

277
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:46,053
Hey, Jessie.

278
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,455
Can I ask you a question?

279
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,958
What you said this morning,

280
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:53,493
was that a blue thought
or a true thought?

281
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:54,962
What you mean?

282
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:58,699
Well, was you saying that
because you was sad,

283
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:00,968
or you really think
that's true?

284
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:07,040
'Cause, you know,
the real truth is,

285
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:09,476
I chose you and your mama.

286
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:12,913
Jessie,

287
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:15,216
why you call me Dad?

288
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:17,985
- Hmm?
- Because you're my dad.

289
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:19,987
Because you chose me.

290
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,922
Just like I choose you.

291
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:23,991
(sighs)
Then why

292
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:26,893
did you cry at the hospital
when you saw the sonogram?

293
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,595
You never cry for me.

294
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:30,697
I cry for you all the time.

295
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:31,832
When?

296
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:35,303
Like when I see
the way you dance.

297
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:37,004
When I see the way you run.

298
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:38,605
(chuckles):
Not funny.

299
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:40,107
When I see how your face
look like in the morning.

300
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:43,110
When I smell
your stinky breath.

301
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:44,278
- When...
- I brush my teeth!

302
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,646
- Least my head's not small.
- You say

303
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,149
- my head's small?
- No. Don't.

304
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:49,950
- Oh, you gonna have to pay for that.
- No, I didn't. No.

305
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:51,585
- You're gonna have to pay for that.
- No, don't! Don't!

306
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:53,154
- (laughs)
- You gonna have to pay for that.

307
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:54,888
- You gonna have to pay for that.
- No, I didn't say that.

308
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:57,991
- (laughs): One. Two.
- (laughs)

309
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,727
- I'm kidding. I'm not gonna do that.
- Obviously.

310
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,163
Where'd the cow go
on a vacation?

311
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:03,563
Where'd the cow go on vacation?

312
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:05,299
- Moo York.
- Moo York?

313
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,168
- (laughs)
- Okay, that was a pretty good one.

314
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,036
Ha! Wait, what?

315
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:10,338
Hey, be careful. Don't...

316
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,773
Don't... (laughs) I got you!

317
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:14,074
You know what this is?

318
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,609
That's Spanish moss.

319
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:17,911

- No, she don't need to be there.

1211
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:36,257
What are you talking about?
We need everyone we can get.

1212
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,859
We need her to come, Antonio.

1213
01:06:38,892 --> 01:06:40,127
You're running out of choices.

1214
01:06:40,161 --> 01:06:41,295
Well, what about Merk, hmm?

1215
01:06:41,329 --> 01:06:42,396
I got a friend,
he work for ICE.

1216
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,797
What about, what about Merk?

1217
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:45,699
- That's not enough.
- He's enough!

1218
01:06:45,732 --> 01:06:47,135
He's not, he's-he's not enough.

1219
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:49,069
We need to send the strongest
messaging to the judge...

1220
01:06:49,102 --> 01:06:50,971
- Fuck messaging. No, fuck that!
- Do you want to keep

1221
01:06:51,004 --> 01:06:52,340
- our family together or not?
- No, I don't want her there!

1222
01:06:52,373 --> 01:06:53,907
- We need this.
- I don't want her there!

1223
01:07:00,381 --> 01:07:02,350
BARRY:
The people that you have coming

1224
01:07:02,383 --> 01:07:04,084
are your friends.

1225
01:07:04,117 --> 01:07:06,154
Susanne is your parent.

1226
01:07:06,187 --> 01:07:07,754
She ain't my fucking parent.

1227
01:07:07,787 --> 01:07:09,823
Yeah, that's right, because
you told me she was dead.

1228
01:07:09,856 --> 01:07:12,160
BARRY: Okay, come on,
guys, look, look.

1229
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:14,228
I know this is hard.

1230
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:17,298
I've done a lot of these cases,
and it brings up the past.

1231
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:19,966
It's painful.

1232
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,903
You need to tell her to come
to the hearing.

1233
01:07:25,439 --> 01:07:28,942
No, fuck that.
I won't do it.

1234
01:07:33,514 --> 01:07:35,815
How come you didn't tell me?

1235
01:07:37,418 --> 01:07:38,952
Hey!

1236
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:42,722
Antonio, I'm talking to you!

1237
01:07:42,756 --> 01:07:45,025
Were you ever gonna tell me?!

1238
01:07:49,163 --> 01:07:50,464
- (engine starts)
- You have to talk to her.

1239
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:51,731
If you want to stay,
you have to.

1240
01:07:51,765 --> 01:07:53,967
(engine revving)

1241
01:08:05,011 --> 01:08:06,746
(crying)

1242
01:08:07,847 --> 01:08:09,383
- (door bells jingle)
- Hey! Wait a minute.

1243
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:11,352
- You got my money?
- I don't got the money, Ms. Jacci.

1244
01:08:11,385 --> 01:08:12,786
You better have my money.

1245
01:08:12,819 --> 01:08:13,987
I don't got the money,
Ms. Jacci! Okay?

1246
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,489
Let me get you straight.
No money, no job.

1247
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:17,325
I don't got the money.
No job? Okay.

1248
01:08:17,358 --> 01:08:19,493
- Pick up this shit and get out.
- Okay, I'll pack my shit

1249
01:08:19,527 --> 01:08:21,162
and I'll leave.

1250
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:41,815
(crumples paper)

1251
01:08:43,284 --> 01:08:45,118
(door bells jingle)

1252
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,096
What you doing here?

1253
01:09:00,066 --> 01:09:03,137
I came here for another tattoo.

1254
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:08,175
What you think this is, huh?

1255
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:10,910
Free therapy?

1256
01:09:10,944 --> 01:09:14,848
You think getting a tattoo
gonna save your life?

1257
01:09:20,521 --> 01:09:22,055
Leave.

1258
01:09:32,233 --> 01:09:33,301
(door closes)

1259
01:09:35,636 --> 01:09:37,904
Hey, Jessie.

1260
01:09:37,937 --> 01:09:39,573
Hey, Jessie. Hey.

1261
01:09:39,607 --> 01:09:41,309
Hey, d... hey. Hey.

1262
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:42,909
Hey, where you... hey, hey,
where you going?

1263
01:09:42,942 --> 01:09:44,911
Where you going?
I ain't gonna hurt you.

1264
01:09:44,944 --> 01:09:48,449
I ain't gonna hurt you.
I'm your daddy, okay?

1265
01:09:48,482 --> 01:09:50,884
How you doing?
How was school?

1266
01:09:57,358 --> 01:09:59,193
Listen, I need, I need
to tell you something.

1267
01:09:59,226 --> 01:10:02,196
Okay? I need you to listen,
really hear me. Okay?

1268
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:07,100
I know I messed up.

1269
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:12,473
And I-I know I-I shouldn't
have left y'all.

1270
01:10:12,506 --> 01:10:14,908
And I'm really sorry.

1271
01:10:18,078 --> 01:10:19,879
Okay?

1272
01:10:19,913 --> 01:10:21,515
But I'm gonna make up for it.

1273
01:10:21,549 --> 01:10:23,950
Okay? I promise.

1274
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,028
Jessie.

1275
01:10:35,995 --> 01:10:38,165
Come here. Hey.

1276
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:39,433
You okay?

1277
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:42,636
You know, at some point, we're
gonna have to figure this out.

1278
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,105
You can't keep her
from me forever.

1279
01:10:48,309 --> 01:10:52,246
If Antonio gets deported,
I'm filing for custody.

1280
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:53,913
And there's no way no judge
is gonna think

1281
01:10:53,947 --> 01:10:55,516
you taking her is a good idea.

1282
01:10:55,549 --> 01:10:57,917
And what if I do, huh?

1283
01:10:57,951 --> 01:11:00,187
What if I do take her?

1284
01:11:01,555 --> 01:11:04,392
You know he's been stealing
motorcycles again, right?

1285
01:11:08,262 --> 01:11:10,029
Let's go.

1286
01:11:11,265 --> 01:11:13,900
(engine starts)

1287
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:38,992
(blow-dryer whirring)

1288
01:11:56,109 --> 01:11:58,312
(blow-dryer turns off)

1289
01:12:05,586 --> 01:12:07,086
Hey.

1290
01:12:11,492 --> 01:12:12,660
Hi, Jessie.

1291
01:12:12,693 --> 01:12:14,495
Hi, Dad.

1292
01:12:21,802 --> 01:12:24,205
I got you some flowers.

1293
01:12:33,547 --> 01:12:36,217
(laughs softly)

1294
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,752
Y'all ain't gonna talk to me?

1295
01:12:38,786 --> 01:12:41,020
DAWN:
Kathy?

1296
01:12:41,054 --> 01:12:42,121
Who is that?

1297
01:12:42,156 --> 01:12:44,492
(scoffs)
It's my mom.

1298
01:12:44,525 --> 01:12:47,495
- What is she doing here?
- What do you mean?

1299
01:12:47,528 --> 01:12:49,530
DAWN:
Kathy.

1300
01:12:50,464 --> 01:12:53,400
I'm gonna get
a few things together.

1301
01:12:56,136 --> 01:12:57,471
- Okay.
- What's she talking about?

1302
01:12:57,505 --> 01:13:00,106
- We're done.
- Hey, what's she talking about?

1303
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,376
KATHY:
Come here.

1304
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:20,594
Yeah.

1305
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,833
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

1306
01:13:29,703 --> 01:13:31,205
What you mean?

1307
01:13:35,175 --> 01:13:37,311
(quietly):
Okay.

1308
01:13:40,147 --> 01:13:43,284
It's okay. It's okay.

1309
01:13:43,317 --> 01:13:46,587
You, you can talk to me.

1310
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,087
- Yeah, I know...
- Yeah.

1311
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:50,190
- Yeah, I know that.
- I love you.

1312
01:13:50,224 --> 01:13:52,326
- I love you, too.
- Yeah.

1313
01:13:55,696 --> 01:13:58,566
(crying)

1314
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:03,170
Have you been meeting up
with Q?

1315
01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:10,611
No. No.

1316
01:14:15,182 --> 01:14:17,585
No, Kathy. Hey.

1317
01:14:17,618 --> 01:14:20,387
Hey. What's going on?

1318
01:14:20,421 --> 01:14:23,257
- Hey, Kathy, what's going...
- You're a fucking liar!

1319
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:26,427
Fucking... fucking lying to me.

1320
01:14:30,297 --> 01:14:32,733
Hey.

1321
01:14:32,766 --> 01:14:34,234
You think I'm fucking stupid?

1322
01:14:34,268 --> 01:14:37,771
I-I knew Jacci didn't
give you that money.

1323
01:14:37,805 --> 01:14:39,406
Hey, come on.
Hey, let me talk to you.

1324
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,308
- Don't touch me.
- No. Hey. No. Hey, Kathy,

1325
01:14:41,342 --> 01:14:43,444
let me, let-let me,
let me talk to you for...

1326
01:14:43,477 --> 01:14:46,513
- I'm done! I am done.
- For one second.

1327
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:52,886
How was I supposed to get
that kind of money, okay?

1328
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,588
What was I supposed to do?

1329
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:56,223
Yeah, I'm trying to keep
the family together.

1330
01:14:56,256 --> 01:14:57,758
No, you're not.

1331
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:00,894
We needed a lawyer, so I got
the goddamn money, Kathy.

1332
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:04,198
You think I care
about the money?!

1333
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:07,167
I would g... I would go
with you to...

1334
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:10,838
to anywhere if you had tried.

1335
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:15,709
But you... you won't even
talk to your mom.

1336
01:15:15,743 --> 01:15:17,778
That's crazy.

1337
01:15:17,811 --> 01:15:19,546
Do you see how crazy that is?

1338
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,649
You won't even talk to her
to stay here,

1339
01:15:21,682 --> 01:15:23,784
but you think stealing
is the right way?

1340
01:15:23,817 --> 01:15:24,885
You don't know what you saying.

1341
01:15:24,918 --> 01:15:26,453
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

1342
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:27,921
- Yes, I do.
- You don't know what you saying, no.

1343
01:15:27,955 --> 01:15:30,357
It's simple.
You won't even talk to your mom

1344
01:15:30,391 --> 01:15:33,594
and ask her to come so you can
be with your family.

1345
01:15:33,627 --> 01:15:35,663
(cries)

1346
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:41,502
How come you never told me?

1347
01:15:44,405 --> 01:15:46,607
How are we married
when I don't even know

1348
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,742
that your mom's alive?

1349
01:15:51,845 --> 01:15:54,615
- I don't know you.
- Yeah.

1350
01:15:54,648 --> 01:15:56,517
Yeah, you don't know me.

1351
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,852
Okay?

1352
01:15:58,886 --> 01:16:02,489
You don't know nothing
about that. Okay?

1353
01:16:02,523 --> 01:16:04,558
Okay, you don't,
you don't want to know

1354
01:16:04,591 --> 01:16:05,926
that the people
who brought me here...

1355
01:16:05,959 --> 01:16:07,361
you don't want to know

1356
01:16:07,394 --> 01:16:08,829
that the people
who brought me here

1357
01:16:08,862 --> 01:16:10,497
gave me up
after six months, okay?

1358
01:16:10,531 --> 01:16:12,766
You don't want to know
that I went from foster home

1359
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,468
to foster home
and-and when I...

1360
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:15,836
- You never told me that.
- I know, and when I

1361
01:16:15,869 --> 01:16:18,706
finally thought I ended up
with some parents, okay,

1362
01:16:18,739 --> 01:16:22,776
that man beat the shit
out of me every goddamn day

1363
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:25,312
and she didn't
do shit about it!

1364
01:16:25,345 --> 01:16:27,514
And you want me to go
back there and beg her.

1365
01:16:27,548 --> 01:16:28,849
No, you want me to go back...

1366
01:16:28,882 --> 01:16:30,584
She ain't gonna help me, okay?!

1367
01:16:30,617 --> 01:16:33,754
If she didn't help me before,
she ain't gonna help me now!

1368
01:16:33,787 --> 01:16:36,557
- It's time to go, Kathy.
- Dawn!

1369
01:16:37,725 --> 01:16:40,694
Get the fuck out my house.

1370
01:16:42,362 --> 01:16:43,797
Come on, Kathy.

1371
01:16:43,831 --> 01:16:46,333
You need to leave.

1372
01:16:46,366 --> 01:16:48,335
(Kathy sniffles)

1373
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,816
Well, you never told me.

1374
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:21,802
(screen door opens, closes)

1375
01:17:24,671 --> 01:17:26,807
DAWN:
Get in the car, baby.

1376
01:17:32,412 --> 01:17:34,748
Coming, Daddy?

1377
01:17:34,782 --> 01:17:36,683
Nah, baby girl.

1378
01:17:36,717 --> 01:17:38,418
Go with your mama.

1379
01:17:38,452 --> 01:17:40,487
KATHY:
