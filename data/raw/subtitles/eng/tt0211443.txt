1
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,600
Stare at this for a while,
you ugly bastard.

2
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
What are you doing here?

3
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,900
I'm taking the specimen.

4
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,900
No. I haven't prepped
the chamber.

5
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,300
I don't want him frozen.
I want him soft.

6
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,100
We've already discussed this.

7
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I had to go
over your head.

8
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm moving him
to our Scranton Facility.

9
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,900
You can't risk taking him
through open country.

10
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,600
This isn't open for discussion.

11
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,200
His unique ability
to regenerate

12
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,100
Iost and damaged tissue.
It just cries out for more research.

13
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,000
You'll risk the deaths
of innocent civilians if he escapes.

14
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,300
Yes.

15
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
But I'm sure Sergeant Marcus
and his men

16
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,700
can handle the transfer
just fine.

17
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,300
-Sergeant?
-Everything's under control, ma'am.

18
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,900
-Dr. Wimmer, please.
-He's no longer your problem.

19
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,300
Can we get that rag off him?

20
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,100
What the hell?

21
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, my God!

22
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,800
Get out of here.

23
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,300
What happened?

24
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,600
I'm sorry.

25
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,300
Cryogenic breach.

26
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,400
Emergency lock-down.

27
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,300
Oh, God, no!

28
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,500
No.

29
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Kay-Em?

30
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
No viruses, no bacteria.

31
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
No toxins. It's clean.

32
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,900
-It's still cold.
-Wow.

33
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,100
What is that?

34
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,300
It's like a big kind

35
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,100
kind of frozen storage thing?

36
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,500
Probably a cryostasis unit.

37
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,700
I'd guess
early Port series.

38
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,500
Quadroport 11.
Manufactured in 2010.

39
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,100
Precise historic records
are inconsistent.

40
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Anyone thinking
what I'm thinking?

41
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,300
Open it up.

42
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,100
-What the hell is that?
-Humanoid.

43
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,300
Organic composition
is unclear.

44
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,100
What's on his face?

45
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,600
Some kind of 20th-century
carbon filtration unit?

46
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,900
It's a hockey mask.

47
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,700
Very good, Tsunaron.

48
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
-What's a hockey mask?
-Facial armor

49
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,900
Used in a sport outlawed
in 2024.

50
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,300
Amazing.

51
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,600
Absolute museum-quality.

52
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,900
Are you paying attention,
Azrael?

53
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,300
Yeah.

54
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,700
Well, don't touch anything.

55
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,000
Guys.

56
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
We got another body here.

57
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,300
Kay-Em?

58
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
She's pertectly preserved.

59
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,500
Cell Crystallization
is at 25 percent.

60
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,900
25 percent?

61
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Suggest nanotech and phase
one cell reconstruction.

62
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,700
Wait... Wait a minute, are you...

63
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,900
...are you saying that...

64
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,800
-...we can bring her back to life?
-Yes.

65
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,500
But she is deteriorating.
Opening the door has compromised

66
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
her hibernation.

67
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
Lou, get ready for dust-off.
We have a priority evac.

68
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,200
Copy that, ready in five.

69
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,500
Not five, now.

70
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
What the...?

71
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,500
Look out!

72
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,300
55 cc's of etherene. You'll be fine.

73
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,600
Fine? I'm missing my arm!

74
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,500
Oh, you're so pretty.

75
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,800
-Are the doors secure?
-Locked and blocked.

76
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,200
Beautiful.

77
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,300
Lift off in three,
two...

78
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,300
Yeah!

79
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,200
I love this part.

80
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
-What'd you find?
-You won't believe it.

81
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,100
Get the sarge on the horn.

82
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,400
Division four just entered
the occupied zone.

83
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,100
-Casualties?
-Minimal.

84
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,100
How'd we get this screwed-up gig?

85
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,100
I didn't join the corps
to be a babysitter.

86
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,200
-Brodski,

87
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,600
-Sarge, we found a viable.

88
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,500
Say again?

89
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,200
We found two bodies
in deep cryostasis.

90
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,900
Kay-Em unit thinks we can
resuscitate the female.

91
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Female?

92
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Yeah.

93
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,300
Crutch, do you copy?

94
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,200
Crutch, do you read me?

95
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,600
Wake the hell up.

96
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,100
-Yeah, what do you want?
-They're on their way back.

97
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,500
Power up the lab.

98
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

99
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,200
-What does she look like?
-She's cute.

100
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,300
Yeah.

101
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,700
And single.

102
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,900
I'm so lonely.

103
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,100
We need to get her to the lab.

104
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,100
-You think you can bring her back?
-We'll find out, sergeant.

105
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,700
-You won't bring him back, will you?
-No, it's impossible.

106
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,500
Aw, shit. I forgot my arm.

107
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,900
Yeah, here you go, dumb-ass.

108
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,800
Hi, hand.

109
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,900
-Any idea how long she's been down?
-4.55 centuries.

110
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,200
Must've been one hell
of a wake-up call.

111
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,300
-I'm bitchy as hell when I wake up.
-Did you just wake up?

112
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Kinsa.

113
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,100
-You guys always find the cool shit.
-Where's Waylander?

114
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,100
He's in lab one,
charging the bed now.

115
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,500
Find Stoney and Adrienne
and get to lab two.

116
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,000
Once we're in the clear, I'd like
to check your circuits.

117
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,800
-I'll bet you would.
-It isn't like that.

118
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
I need you in lab two.

119
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,300
-You found something?
-Two viables.

120
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,700
-In what condition?
-Pertect. We're attempting reanimation.

121
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,700
-What can I do?
-You, Stoney and Kinsa...

122
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,900
-They'll slow me down.
- Just walk them through it, okay?

123
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,000
Run a structural scan
and log them in.

124
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,600
-I'll check back later.
-Fine.

125
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,100
-Okay, where are we?
-Board's all green. The N-2's ready.

126
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,100
Begin stabilizing

127
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,100
-cell fractures.
-Yes, professor.

128
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,500
I need a scan. Glycerol levels,
cerebral profusion...

129
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,100
-...the works.
-I live to serve.

130
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,200
-Let's see what we have here.
Decrystalization of the membranes is

131
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,300
at 32 percent.

132
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,300
-Somebody get her clothes off.
-I got it!

133
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
I got it.

134
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,300
Honestly.

135
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,800
Where's her diffusion barriers?

136
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,300
Seventeen and stable.

137
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Here we go.

138
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,100
Stay still or you'll get an elbow where
elbow where your wrist should be.

139
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,400
Specimen 4420 found in sector 39-30 L
on Earth prime.

140
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Subject discovered
in cryosuspension.

141
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,300
-How's it going?
-Good. What's up?

142
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,500
-Where do you want this?
-On the specimen table.

143
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,700
-Hi, baby.
-Hey, gorgeous.

144
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,000
Initiating scan.

145
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,300
Smart and sexy.

146
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,600
Professor.

147
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,100
Take a look at this guy's
scan.

148
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,900
Amazing.

149
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,800
How'd he function
with that small brain?

150
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
-Way manages.
-That's very funny.

151
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,800
He's a big boy.

152
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I bet he's hung
like a mammoth.

153
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,900
Get out of here and come back
when you're focused.

154
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,900
-You serious?
-Yes, just go.

155
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,300
-Thanks, Adrienne.
-Thanks.

156
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,900
Don't mention it.

157
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,300
See what you can salvage
from the optic cortex.

158
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,600
-Then move on.
-My pleasure, professor.

159
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Ready phase two.

160
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Bring on the ants.

161
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,800
That's it.

162
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,300
Come to mama.

163
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,200
Temperature, 96.2.

164
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,600
97.

165
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,900
Cool. It's working.

166
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
98.6 and holding.

167
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,900
Cell reconstruction is complete.
Internal defib

168
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,300
in three...

169
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,800
two, one.

170
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,900
Easy. Easy.

171
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,600
Vital signs are normal
and strong.

172
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
No shit.

173
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,700
Easy.

174
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Easy.

175
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,400
Did ya get him?

176
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,500
Where is he?
Tell me you got him.

177
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,400
Got who?

178
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
No one's here.
You're safe with us.

179
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,400
There was a leak
in the cryo-unit and...

180
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Was he contained?

181
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,100
It was contained.

182
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,100
But when the cryo-unit ruptured,
you didn't escape it.

183
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,900
It put you into stasis.

184
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,300
For how long?

185
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,200
The year is 2455.

186
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,800
Now, I know this
is a huge shock...

187
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,300
but you'll be safe here.

188
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,600
You're aboard Grendel, a class-four,
catamaran transport ship.

189
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,300
We're on our way back home and...

190
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,900
you'll be just fine.

191
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,900
2455?

192
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,700
That's over 400 years.

193
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,400
Secure line. Perez, Dieter.

194
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,900
Solaris Research Station.
Connect.

195
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,600
Lowe. You bastard.

196
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,700
We've hit the mother lode.

197
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,700
Do you know what time it is?

198
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,800
I don't care.
We've got a goldmine.

199
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,300
A box of DVDs

200
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
is not a goldmine.
I've told you, I can't move them.

201
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Look at the file.

202
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,000
Two 400-year-old frozen specimens.
One well-preserved...

203
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,300
One well-preserved,

204
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,200
the other one, are you ready
for this? Up and walking around.

205
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,700
400 years old

206
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,700
and walking around.

207
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,800
Yeah. 455 years,
to be exact.

208
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,700
Who cares? Who gives a shit?

209
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,400
People. They'll pay huge money
to see her.

210
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,700
Let me ask you a question.

211
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,800
Is this the first person
you've reanimated?

212
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Of course not.

213
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,500
How many people
are out there today...

214
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,400
walking around thawed out
and looking good?

215
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,200
-Hundreds.

216
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,000
-Thousands.

217
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,400
Maybe.
But not 450 years old.

218
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,700
She's nearly twice
as old as anyone.

219
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,900
250, 450.

220
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,900
-What's the difference?

221
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,900
-Doctor,

222
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
a hundred years ago, when
reanimation was...

223
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,200
more unpredictable...
sure, maybe.

224
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,200
But now...

225
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,900
it's old news.

226
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,700
Damn it. I need money.

227
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,300
Oh, I know. I know.

228
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,500
The other viable
is marked "Voorhees."

229
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,700
That's not Jason Voorhees,
is it?

230
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,300
What do you know about him?

231
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,100
Jason Voorhees.

232
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,500
He killed
nearly 200 people...

233
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,100
and simply disappeared
without a trace.

234
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,900
Why, to the right buyer
he could be worth a fortune.

235
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,800
I've got him frozen here
on the ship.

236
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,600
You work out a list
ofownership?

237
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,400
No list. He's my find.
He's mine.

238
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,700
What about your students?

239
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,300
They're students. The educational
experience will be enough.

240
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,600
Doctor, doctor,
you are one son of a bitch.

241
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,300
Soon to be one rich son
of a bitch.

242
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Lowe out.

243
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,500
Professor,

244
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,700
I think that...

245
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,100
we need to talk
about my midterm.

246
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,400
Poor baby. No wonder
you wore this thing.

247
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,500
Harder. Harder.

248
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,300
-Who's been a naughty little boy?
-I have.

249
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,900
Harder.

250
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,100
-A little harder? How's that?
-Yeah.

251
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,800
-Oh, good.
-How's that?

252
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,800
Yeah!

253
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,600
-Daddy wants it hard?
-Yeah!

254
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,400
-Yeah. That's it.
-Right there?

255
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,200
-You like it right there?
-Yeah.

256
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,100
A little harder for daddy?

257
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,200
Come on!

258
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,700
-Come on!
-You pass!

259
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,800
What do you think?

260
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,300
-Do you like them?
-They're fine.

261
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,100
Look, Kay-Em, I don't think
this is going to work.

262
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,700
-Why do you want those things?
-Janessa has them.

263
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,600
-Well, Janessa's...
-Real?

264
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,900
Yes.

265
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,500
Let's not complicate things,
all right?

266
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,000
I like you just
the way you are.

267
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,700
I think you're pertect.

268
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,000
Okay.

269
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,000
Help, Wayland! No!

270
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,000
Somebody help!

271
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,900
Help me! No!

272
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,900
No! No!

273
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,500
I brought you something
to eat.

274
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,100
Soon we'll be
at Earth Two.

275
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,300
Earth Two? What happened
to Earth One?

276
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,600
Yeah, well, it's dead.

277
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,500
The oceans, the soil,
either will sustain life.

278
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,600
Can I do anything else
for you?

279
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,500
You want to tell me
what happened?

280
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,900
I take it being stabbed
and frozen

281
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,100
-wasn't part of your plan.
-I'm a...

282
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,600
I was a project leader
at Crystal Lake Research.

283
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,500
The subject
as Jason Voorhees.

284
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Jason Voorhees?

285
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
Notorious murderer?

286
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,500
We executed him
for the first time in 2008.

287
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,000
For the first time?

288
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,600
We tried everything.

289
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,500
Electrocution,
gas, firing squad.

290
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,600
We even hung him once.
Nothing worked.

291
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,400
We couldn't terminate him,
so we decided to contain him.

292
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,100
Cryogenic stasis.

293
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,900
Freeze him until we could figure
out what to do.

294
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,900
Seems sensible.

295
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
I thought so.

296
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,500
Unfortunately some people who were
too smart for their own good...

297
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,500
felt that a creature
that couldn't be killed was.

298
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,000
too valuable
to file away.

299
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,100
In the end, it always
comes down to money.

300
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,900
How do you thank someone
who gives you back your life?

301
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,200
You'll be alive for a long time.
We'll figure out something.

302
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,600
Why don't you just admit it?
You want me.

303
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I could never be with a girl whose
balls are bigger than mine.

304
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,900
Guys, our star patient is back.
Tsunaron and Janessa.

305
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,600
-Hi.
-Hi.

306
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,500
I see that my clothes
fit okay.

307
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,000
These are yours. They're great.
Thank you.

308
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,000
-What are those?
-These are Janessa's love children.

309
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,100
You see now,

310
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,100
it is that wit of yours that is
what repels all human females.

311
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,900
And you've met
Sergeant Brodski.

312
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,100
-Yes. Hi, again.
-Hi.

313
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,900
And this
is the lovely Kay-Em 14.

314
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,100
Tsunaron's little
love-bot.

315
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,200
Easy, Janessa.

316
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Kay-Em is a knowledge
matrix android.

317
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,600
-that I have been programing.
-Amazing.

318
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,300
She looks so real.

319
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
I am real.

320
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,000
-Professor, where do you want this?
-Lab two.

321
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,800
Where did you get that?

322
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,900
From your friend,
with the hockey mask.

323
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,000
You brought him
on board?

324
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,800
He's in the next lab.
We're safe.

325
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,800
Safe?

326
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,700
Our scans reveal him
to be very dead.

327
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,800
Could your scans be wrong?

328
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,400
Get rid of him.
He's too dangerous.

329
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,300
That would be irresponsible
and foolhardy.

330
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,600
He's a valuable scientific artifact
that must be carefully preserved.

331
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Much like yourself.

332
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,500
He is an unstoppable
killing machine.

333
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,800
He's not dead.

334
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Believe me.
He's definitely dead.

335
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,900
Show me.

336
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,900
I'm putting us
on lock-down.

337
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,900
Attention, we have
a hostile on board.

338
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,100
-Grunt team, report to weapons.

339
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,100
-The chick?

340
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Repeat, we have
a hostile on board.

341
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,900
Grunt team, report to weapons.

342
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
Everyone else, get to lab one.

343
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,600
-Baby, I'm not ready yet.
-Hurry up.

344
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,900
Grunt team's assembled.
Dallas is a no-show.

345
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,500
-Sergeant.
-Where the hell is he?

346
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,200
-I don't know, sarge.

347
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,900
-Damn.

348
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,300
Look, sergeant,
we need to talk.

349
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,600
-Do you have all your kids yet?
-Yes.

350
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,700
Oh, God!

351
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
Stoney...

352
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
-Stoney's dead.
-Oh, my God.

353
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,700
Stoney's dead.

354
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,600
Kicker! I want full armor
and tac.

355
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,100
I want nothing left of this guy
by the time we reach Solaris.

356
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,100
Roger that.
Let's get moving!

357
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nothing left of him?

358
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,500
Take your kids to lab one and stay
there till you hear from me.

359
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,300
I just saved your ass.

360
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,300
Don't get cocky.

361
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,300
You must feel like a wuss,
huh, big boy?

362
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,100
-Check the score. It's still 9-3.
-Yeah,

363
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
but I got my groove
on now.

364
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,900
So, what do you say
next kill wins?

365
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,000
Lock and load, killer.

366
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,200
You're going down.
You are so going down.

367
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,600
What the hell?

368
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,700
-I thought this was an alien sim.
-Yeah, it is.

369
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,300
Pause play.

370
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,700
-I said, pause play.
-He's not pausing.

371
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,500
No kidding.

372
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,200
I think we need to reboot.

373
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,500
That does not count
as a kill.

374
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Yes it does.

375
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,400
Okay, screw this.
Game over.

376
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,300
What the hell?

377
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,900
Drop the kid!

378
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,700
Drop the kid! Now!

379
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,400
Azrael, get out of here!

380
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,500
-I got him! I got him!
-I got no shot!

381
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Move!

382
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Sergeant Brodski.

383
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,300
Don't leave those kids alone.
What's wrong with you?

384
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,700
We're near Solaris.

385
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
They have
7 fully equipped unit

386
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,700
that can deal with this.

387
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,200
I say we wait
and sedate him.

388
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,200
-I am taking this guy out.
-I need him alive.

389
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,700
What you need is to get out
of my way.

390
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,600
Look, there
are other considerations.

391
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,700
Financial considerations.

392
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,800
My only consideration is the safety
of the people on this ship.

393
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,400
All right, a hundred thousand.

394
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,600
Two hundred.

395
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
-Five.
-Five?

396
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,500
-Dallas not here yet?
-Nope.

397
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,400
Briggs, find him,
bring him up to speed.

398
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,000
Condor, you have a BFG?

399
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,100
You're with me. Sven, Geko,
you got the starboard pontoon.

400
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,100
Sarge, what do we do
when we find him?

401
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I promised the doc
we'd take him alive.

402
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,300
Man!

403
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,700
So, after you blow him to hell, put
one in his leg so we can say we tried.

404
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,800
Yeah.

405
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,900
-Sarge, I got Dallas.

406
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,700
-Where the hell is he?

407
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:52,900
He's dead.

408
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,800
Sarge, we got a body
in bay two.

409
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,100
-Who is it?

410
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,800
-It's Azrael.

411
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,800
What the hell's going on?

412
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,000
Got a blood trail heading
toward the cargo bay.

413
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,500
Condor, Kicker
and I will take cargo.

414
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,000
Rest of you take portside.

415
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,700
I hope they know
what they're doing.

416
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,400
These guys live
for this stuff.

417
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Sorry.

418
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,700
-Don't do that!
-Dude.

419
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
-What?
-You scream like a girl.

420
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,400
-Screw you.
-You wish.

421
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,700
Lou, is that you?

422
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
I swear, you mess
with an engineer...

423
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,600
you'll wake up with a waste hose
in your bunk.

424
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Asshole.

425
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,900
What the hell?

426
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Crutch, get down now!

427
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,400
-What the hell's going on here?
-Crutch,

428
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,800
out now!

429
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,200
You wrecked my stuff, man.

430
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,400
We nailed him.
He must be here.

431
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,300
Condor, airborne.

432
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Briggs.

433
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,100
Where the hell's Sven?

434
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Condor, anything topside?

435
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,000
Negative, sarge.

436
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,700
No sign ofhim.

437
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,500
This won't work.

438
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,500
Keep your eyes peeled.

439
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,500
Everything's under control.

440
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,100
Condor, report.

441
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,800
Sven, report.

442
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,500
Condor, report.

443
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,300
Report!

444
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
Damn!

445
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,700
Sarge, we found Condor.

446
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,300
What's his condition?

447
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
He's screwed.

448
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,500
Let's smoke this fucker.

449
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,700
God!

450
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,600
Sarge...

451
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,100
Sven's dead.

452
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,700
Jesus.!

453
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,100
-You have got to get them out of there.
-They know what they're doing.

454
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,900
Oh, man!

455
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,500
Geko. Geko.

456
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,800
I got him!

457
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,500
I got him!

458
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,100
Yes, yes.
See, they got him.

459
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,800
Don't take your eyes
off him.

460
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,600
I'm on my way.

461
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
Take your time.
He ain't going nowhere.

462
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
Briggs...

463
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,300
get out of here.

464
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,900
Kicker. Briggs.

465
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,500
Where are you, damn it?

466
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,700
He's all alone in there.

467
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,500
It'll take more than a poke
in the ribs to put down this old dog.

468
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,600
Yeah,

469
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,200
that ought to do it.

470
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,100
Such a waste.

471
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,400
I told him to stay calm.

472
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,100
To wait until we got to Solaris and
then we could take care of this...

473
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,100
monster.

474
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,100
I said,
"Don't go in unprepared."

475
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,700
Brodski was just too proud.

476
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Who locked the damn door?

477
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,100
Somebody wants to tell me
what is going on?

478
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,700
Grunts are dead.

479
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,400
-Which ones?
-All of them.

480
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,500
Oh, man!

481
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,800
Lou, how long
till we reach Solaris?

482
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,500
I'm taking us out
of hyperdrive now.

483
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,200
Kids and their goddamn
field trips, you know?

484
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,100
Just bring a psycho on board.

485
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,100
I know I'll get blamed
for this shit.

486
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,700
Solaris to Grendel, we have you on
approach. Stand by for docking number.

487
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,100
Grendel to Solaris, we need
military and medical at the gate.

488
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,800
We got a big problem here.
Real goat fuck.

489
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,000
Grendel, what's your problem?

490
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,500
What's your problem?

491
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:39,900
Look...

492
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,300
we'll be all right.

493
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,400
He's trapped in the cargo bay.
We're locked in here.

494
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,600
Can the Solaris grunts
kill him?

495
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,400
Absolutely.

496
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,000
I've been in constant contact
with Solaris.

497
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,300
Sixty highly
trained professionals

498
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,400
are standing by to get us
off this ship.

499
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,100
Solaris to Grendel, pull up.
Abort docking.

500
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,200
You're coming in too fast.
Grendel...

501
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,100
What now?

502
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,900
-Warning. Prepare for impact.
-Hang on!

503
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,000
What's going on?

504
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,700
What the hell's going on?

505
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,300
Everyone okay?

506
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,800
What just happened?

507
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,400
-Waylander.
-Yeah.

508
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,800
We overshot it. We'll turn
around and go back.

509
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:02,700
Hang on.

510
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,700
Oh, my God!

511
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,400
Solaris is gone.

512
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,900
Gone?

513
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,700
-It can't be gone.
-Look. It's gone.

514
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,500
What are we going to do?

515
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,300
Lou.

516
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,500
What sort of damage
we looking at?

517
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,500
I'm sending out
a distress beacon.

518
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,700
-Lou?
-Guys...

519
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,600
We've lost
our entire port pontoon.

520
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,600
-The internal pressure is stable.
-The main...

521
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,900
-thrusters are offline.
-Life support?

522
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,200
We should be okay
for a while.

523
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,300
-But he's out there.
-We'll be fine.

524
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,400
We're in a high-volume traffic lane.
Another ship'll come by.

525
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,200
We'll be safe here.

526
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,500
Shut up!

527
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,100
What are you doing?

528
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,700
Maybe he gave up.

529
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,500
You really think so?

530
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,500
I don't think he's out there.

531
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,200
Why don't you just stick your head
out and have a peek?

532
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,400
Oh, my God! Go! Go!

533
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,500
Janessa, go!

534
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,900
Move it, move it, move it!
Come on!

535
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Let's go!

536
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,900
Where's professor Lowe?

537
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,600
Hi.

538
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,300
Look...

539
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,900
do you know
how valuable you are?

540
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,700
I mean, fame, money.

541
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,900
With my help, you're going
to have it all.

542
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,700
I know people.
I have connections!

543
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,400
Together we can make
a fortune.

544
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,100
We can.

545
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,300
Oh, shit!

546
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,000
You want your machete back.

547
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,200
Shit, it's yours, take it.

548
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,900
Just remember
who saved it for you.

549
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,700
Guys, it's okay! He just wanted
his machete back!

550
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,900
I'm going to go back

551
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,000
to my room because Stoney's
meeting me there.

552
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,600
All right, look. How do
we get off this ship?

553
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,800
I don't know.

554
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,500
Could you beam us off
or something?

555
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,600
"Beam us off?"

556
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,500
The shuttle.

557
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,400
The shuttle.
What about it, Crutch?

558
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,600
Yeah, I can do prelaunch
from the bridge.

559
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,400
Good. The rest of us'll head
to the shuttle.

560
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,700
We'll start...

561
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,900
I'm with you, Crutch.

562
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,200
-You know how to use that thing?
-Yep.

563
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,000
Like riding a bike. Once you learn,
you never forget.

564
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,500
Kay-Em and I will go to the supply
hold. Meet you at the shuttle bay.

565
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,100
-See you there.
-See there.

566
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,800
What's a bike?

567
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,900
We've enough fire power
to level a moon.

568
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,300
Let's pack up and head
for the shuttle.

569
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,200
So, you think we'll make it?

570
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,400
The statistical probability
of survival is 12 percent.

571
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,600
Twelve percent? Can't you come up
with better odds?

572
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,000
-No.
-Bullshit, Kay-Em! That's bullshit!

573
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,700
Preparation for launch
may be a simple procedure,

574
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,500
but getting there alive?

575
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,300
It is a problem.

576
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,500
You telling me that there's
absolutely no chance

577
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,500
for us to better
our odds?

578
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,700
Statistical probability of survival
just went up to...

579
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,900
fifty-three percent.

580
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,300
Want to go for a hundred?

581
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,100
He's here.

582
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,800
Quiet.

583
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But if he's in here,
he'll kill us...

584
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,100
Quiet!

585
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,300
One more sound, and I'll snap
your neck myself.

586
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,100
Got it?

587
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,300
She's good with people.

588
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,100
Did you see that?

589
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,500
-What?
-I think someone's alive over there.

590
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,900
We don't have time for this.

591
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,000
-Which way is the shuttle bay?
-Straight through.

592
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,000
Go. I'll meet you there.

593
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,900
Just...
don't wreck my pants.

594
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,400
Come on, girl.
We're going home.

595
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,700
Ah, Lou!

596
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,000
Jesus, that's twisted.

597
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,800
Course, I've seen worse.

598
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,400
Okay, let's get to work.

599
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,600
Brodski?

600
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,500
Okay...

601
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,100
We'll get you out of here.

602
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
Oh, God!

603
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,900
I'll go get help,
and I'll be back.

604
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,900
Give me your vest.

605
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,500
-Bastard.
-Hey...

606
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,900
Lucky you weren't alive during
the Microsoft conflict.

607
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,000
We were beating each other
with our own severed limbs.

608
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,100
That's nice.

609
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,800
Okay.

610
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,900
Let's get us home.

611
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,700
Kinsa, are you there?

612
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,900
Yes, ma'am.

613
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,300
Crutch?

614
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,700
Prepare for fuel transfers.
Cells six and seven bypass.

615
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,000
Hydraulic lifters.

616
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,100
Pressurized and dampened.

617
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,000
-It's Brodski, he's alive.
-No shit.

618
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
I can't move him. Are Way
and Crutch back?

619
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,400
-No, they're still on the bridge.
-I need help.

620
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,600
Hey, guys.

621
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,800
Brodski's still alive but Rowan
can't move him by herself.

622
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,400
Go. I can handle it
from here.

623
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,600
Tell them I'm on my way.
Watch your back.

624
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,400
Crutch, how are we doing
for time?

625
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,000
With a giant shitload
of good luck...

626
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,900
...we might be

627
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,300
ready to go.

628
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,900
Good.

629
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,700
Rowan.

630
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,700
-Where's Brodski?
-He was here.

631
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,800
I don't get it.

632
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,500
And I am going home.

633
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Lowe!

634
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,100
Shit!

635
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,100
I got company here,

636
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,200
people!

637
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,000
Let's go.

638
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,700
Kinsa, open the door.
Open

639
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,100
the damn door!

640
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,900
What's going on?
Why aren't you on board?

641
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,900
Kinsa won't open the door.
She's lost it...

642
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,000
and it's a really bad time
for this!

643
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,700
Janessa, gently.
Give me the com.

644
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,500
Kinsa, honey, it's Rowan.
I need you to open the door.

645
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,500
No.

646
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,200
It's all over, honey.
We can go home.

647
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,500
All you need to do
is open the door.

648
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,500
No.

649
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,400
Oh, shit. Come on, guys.
Guys!

650
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,800
Jesus Christ!
Open the goddamn door!

651
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,400
No! The fuel lines
are still attached!

652
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,600
Kinsa!

653
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,100
Now what?

654
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,800
I...

655
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,600
Now, basically,

656
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,900
we die.

657
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,300
Bullshit!

658
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,600
Okay, new plan.

659
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,700
You hold him and I'll run.

660
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,500
Hey, slappy!

661
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,200
Got a little something
for you.

662
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,600
Oh, wow!

663
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,000
Gave her an upload.

664
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,700
Afraid I'll have
to hurt you now.

665
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,300
Kay-Em!

666
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,100
That...

667
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,100
That didn't go so well.

668
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,700
Got you!

669
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,500
Yeah.

670
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,000
Hey!

671
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:21,800
Giddy up!

672
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I had it under control,
but thanks.

673
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,200
My pleasure.

674
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,800
Yeah.

675
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,700
-You did it.
-Kay-Em.

676
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,300
Who's your mama?

677
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,800
All right.

678
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,200
How you doing there, Brodski?

679
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,100
-I'm all right.
-Come on, let's get you patched up.

680
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,000
What a mess.

681
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,100
Lab two.

682
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,000
Tsunaron,
is he gonna make it?

683
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,500
Absolutely. He's
at 80 percent already.

684
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,300
This guy is strong.

685
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,500
What the hell?

686
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:25,700
Way?

687
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,500
Trouble. The collision
has compromised the hull.

688
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,800
She's bleeding out.

689
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,300
Oh, no. No, no,

690
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,400
no.

691
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,500
-Tiamat to Grendel, do you read?
Over.

692
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,300
-Tiamat to Grendel, do you read?

693
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,300
-Yes!

694
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,100
Tiamat, this is Grendel,
we read you. Can you hear us?

695
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,100
That's affirmative.

696
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,000
We are reading
your distress beacon.

697
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,200
-Are you in need of assistance?
-That's very affirmative, Tiamat.

698
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,500
How soon can you get here?
Our situation

699
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,200
is extremely critical.

700
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,300
We're four parsecs away,
Grendel.

701
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,900
ETA, 45 minutes.

702
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,700
We don't have that much time.

703
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,500
Tiamat, this is Grendel.

704
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,900
We'll have a core implosion
in less than 30 minutes.

705
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,100
Do you copy?

706
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,600
We copy you, Grendel?

707
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Advise how you'd like us
to proceed.

708
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,900
We'll take them down
with us.

709
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,200
Tiamat...

710
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,200
if you can't get here in 30 minutes,
there's no point.

711
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,700
What?! Are you high?! Tiamat,
this is Grendel.

712
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,500
You just ignore that last idiot.

713
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,100
You get your ass out here,
okay?

714
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,000
You come here
and you save us.

715
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,600
Why can't we just go
over here?

716
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,300
It's no good. The pontoon goes,
it'll take the bridge with it.

717
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,900
Not if we disconnect
these walkways.

718
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,300
You can't just disconnect them.

719
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,100
We could blow it up.

720
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,200
There's macrocharge
in the weapons

721
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,600
This could work.

722
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,800
We're going
to try something.

723
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,700
If you're game, maintain your current
course and speed...

724
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,100
and hopefully we'll see you
when you get here.

725
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,900
Copy.
See you in 45 minutes.

726
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,400
-Good luck, Grendel.
-Thanks.

727
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,900
Let's blow the walkways.

728
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,300
Come on.

729
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,100
Let's set the charges.
Who's got the remote?

730
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,300
-Right here.
-We'll meet up in walkway "B."

731
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:44,700
Go.

732
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,400
-All set.
-Good to go.

733
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,000
Hold together, baby.

734
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,500
Impossible.

735
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,300
-He's dead.
-I'd say he got better.

736
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,700
-He's been modified.
-Oh, you think?

737
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,100
Can you take him?

738
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,900
I can try.

739
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,600
You guys might want to run.

740
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:15,900
Kay-Em!

741
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,500
No!

742
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,000
Waylander!

743
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,000
Brodski, get in here, now!

744
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,300
Come on, guys!

745
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,900
Come on!

746
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,100
What the hell is going on?

747
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,300
Jason Voorhees
is what's going on.

748
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,100
-Blow the charges!
-Waylander's got the trigger!

749
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,800
Hey...

750
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:52,800
Asshole.

751
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,300
I think she's holding.

752
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,200
I think we're finally okay.

753
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,700
I'd clap if I could.

754
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,600
Tiamat to Grendel...

755
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,900
Come in, Grendel.

756
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,000
We have you vectored for approach
and emergency docking.

757
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,000
You ready
to get off that boat?

758
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,200
Yeah.

759
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,600
Let's go home.

760
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:07,000
Holy shit!
We got to go! Now!

761
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,100
No!

762
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,300
Janessa!

763
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,300
Janessa!

764
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,300
Don't let go!

765
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,500
Grab her hand!

766
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,300
Janessa!

767
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,500
Reach out!

768
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,400
Reach for it!

769
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,400
Come on!

770
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,600
Come on!

771
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,200
Oh, this sucks on
so many levels!

772
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,000
Janessa!

773
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,200
Come on!

774
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,200
Come on! Come on!

775
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,500
Janessa!

776
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,200
Shit, he's still coming!

777
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,700
-Oh, shit!
-Come on.

778
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,300
Go!

779
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,600
-Which way?
-This way! This way!

780
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,400
Tiamat, we're
at the evac door.

781
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,700
So am l, Grendel.

782
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,400
Lifeline secured.

783
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,500
Initiate collar
pressurization.

784
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,100
Tiamat, open the outer doors.

785
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,300
Damn!

786
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,300
-What now?
-Let's get that bolt open.

787
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,700
I've got this.
Let me try an override.

788
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,300
Shit! Oh, shit!

789
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,100
Come on, come on.

790
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,100
Our exterior motor's got
no power.

791
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,700
-What does that mean?
-Means I'm going EVA.

792
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,700
-What's EVA?
-It's a space walk.

793
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,200
If he can jump the lines,
we can reroute them.

794
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,200
Hopefully, that door'll open
before this blows up.

795
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,200
-Sounds like a good plan.
-Tiamat, this is Grendel.

796
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,500
Our escape hatch is jammed. We're
going EVA to try to patch it up.

797
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,100
You'd better get a move on.

798
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,300
I'm in the maintenance hatch.

799
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,500
We read you.

800
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,400
Opening outer doors.

801
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,700
Those hatches won't keep him
that much longer.

802
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,400
We need to buy more time.

803
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,500
You're the expert on him,
right?

804
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,200
-What are you thinking?
-A diversion.

805
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,200
I'm at the control panels.

806
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:06,800
Rowan, are you there?

807
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,500
Yes.

808
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,300
I'll divert the main power supply
and send it to you.

809
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,400
Gotcha.

810
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,100
See the bright blue diode?

811
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,700
Connect it to the terminal.

812
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,200
Was that you or me?

813
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,800
That was another part
of your hull, Grendel.

814
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,100
You are running out of time.

815
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,900
Just a few more minutes.

816
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,900
We can disengage and come
around again.

817
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,500
Negative.
Just another minute.

818
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,500
We'll stand by
as long as we can.

819
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,700
-You ready, Kay?
-I was built ready, baby.

820
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,700
Initiate.

821
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,800
It's working.
He's buying it.

822
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,500
-Whoops.
-What do you mean, "Whoops"?

823
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,300
Nothing.

824
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,200
Not nothing.
You don't just say "oops."

825
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,200
I think he saw me.

826
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,900
Oh, man!

827
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,500
If you've got something brilliant,
now'sthe time to do it.

828
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,400
I got something.

829
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,100
I got something.

830
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,300
Prepare variations using data file
Crystal Lake, 1980.

831
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:22,700
Kay?

832
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,400
Here goes nothing.

833
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,500
Initiate.

834
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,600
-You want a beer?
-Or want to smoke some pot?

835
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,100
Or we can have premarital sex.

836
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,300
We love premarital sex.

837
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,300
Try it now, Rowan.

838
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,900
Here we go.

839
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,500
You piece of crap!

840
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,600
He's done with the campers.

841
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,900
He's good!

842
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,100
Too good.
He's coming back.

843
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,100
Try it again.

844
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,400
It's engaged!
The door's engaged!

845
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,000
Brodski, you are the man!

846
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,600
Will we see you sometime
soon?

847
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,800
I'm on my way.

848
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,500
Brodski, where are you?!

849
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,100
Grendel, we can't keep
pressure lock.

850
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,200
We'll disengage in forty seconds.

851
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,100
Kay-Em.

852
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,900
Ten, nine, eight,

853
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,500
seven, six,

854
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,100
five, four,

855
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,100
three, two, one.

856
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,700
-Clear!
-No!

857
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,200
No, wait!

858
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,300
Disconnect.

859
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,100
He's coming this way.

860
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,100
You've got to be kidding me.

861
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:18,800
Brodski!

862
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,100
He's gone.

863
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,900
I can't believe it.

864
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:36,600
Tsun?

865
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,100
Kay-Em. Are you okay?

866
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,100
I'll be back on my feet.
As soon as I have some.

867
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,500
I'll get right on it.

868
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,500
It's beautiful.

869
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,900
-Look at that.
-A shooting star.

870
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,700
Make a wish.

871
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,900
It landed in the lake.

872
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,500
Let's go check it out.

873
01:23:50,300 --> 01:24:00,000
Synchronized by hdan.
