1
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,600
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

2
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,320
Mr. Wilson.

3
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,760
Mr. Wilson?

4
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,400
Mr. Wilson?

5
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,160
Poor old Mr. Wilson must be so sick.

6
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,400
No wonder he ain't up.

7
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,400
Wow!

8
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,000
His heart sounds like our washing machine!

9
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,760
Oh, no.

10
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,080
He's growing extra skin.

11
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,800
His tongue's very ugly...

12
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,440
...and blue and spotty.

13
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,640
Cool!

14
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,880
He feels warm.

15
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,120
He has a temperature.

16
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,360
I know what you need.

17
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
You need an aspirin.

18
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,360
Don't you ever come back!
Do you hear me?

19
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,560
Never!

20
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,320
Starting part time will give you a chance
to ease back into it.

21
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,280
I mean, managing shopping malls
can't be much more difficult...

22
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
...than managing Dennis.

23
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
Where have you been?

24
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,680
Dennis?

25
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,880
Dennis?

26
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,600
I was at Mr. Wilson's house.

27
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,800
And, boy, is he sick.

28
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,560
He's got a fever, and he's burning up.

29
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,560
I better call Martha.

30
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,080
You didn't bother him, did you?

31
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
No, but I gave him an aspirin.

32
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,240
And he don't like them any better than me.

33
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,200
You shouldn't visit people
so early in the morning.

34
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,360
That's the only time I know for sure
they'll be home.

35
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,080
Hello, George. Alice Mitchell.

36
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,200
Are you feeling all right?
Dennis said that you...

37
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,200
<i>Feeling all right!</i>

38
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,280
<i>Your son just shot an aspirin
down my throat with a slingshot!</i>

39
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm very sorry.

40
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,080
<i>You better talk to him!</i>

41
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
We'll talk to him.

42
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,200
<i>When I was a child,
none of this would have been tolerated!</i>

43
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,960
'Bye. 'Bye.

44
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Hi.

45
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,200
Did you shoot an aspirin
into Mr. Wilson's mouth?

46
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,600
I didn't want him to bite off my fingers
with his big, fake teeth.

47
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,480
Those things are sharp!

48
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,840
George said Dennis shot an aspirin
into his mouth with a slingshot.

49
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
What slingshot?

50
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,880
- Do you have a slingshot?
- I'm not sure.

51
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,240
Give it to me.

52
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,440
Mr. Wilson is very angry with you.

53
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,320
I thought he was sick.
I was only trying to help.

54
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,320
You go sit in the corner
and think about what you've done.

55
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
- For how long?
- Until you're sorry.

56
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,880
Oh, good. I'm sorry now.

57
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,480
He can't sit in the corner.

58
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,240
I have to take him
to Margaret Wade's house.

59
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,720
Margaret's house!

60
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,960
I didn't do anything bad enough
to deserve to go to her house.

61
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,720
She's a lunatic. I'll go crazy.
She tortures me.

62
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
She's mean. She's ugly.
She doesn't share!

63
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,800
I arranged with Mrs. Wade for you
to go to their house while I work.

64
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,080
Are you serious?

65
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,880
You can't spend the summer unsupervised.
You're out of school.

66
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,200
I'll go back.

67
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,120
Your mother made arrangements.
That's it! I don't want any arguments.

68
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,000
My life is falling apart.

69
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,600
Hello, George.

70
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,280
Let me take that off your hands. Sorry.

71
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,080
<i>I'm...</i>

72
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
I'm sorry about this morning.

73
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,880
I won't mince words, Mitchell.

74
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,640
Your kid is driving me nuts.

75
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,160
- I'll talk to him again.
- Maybe it isn't talk that he needs.

76
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,920
When my dad had something important
to tell me, he told me with his belt.

77
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,320
That's not how I deal with my son,
Mr. Wilson.

78
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,680
However you deal with him...

79
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,160
...he hasn't learned you don't shoot
an aspirin down a fellow's throat!

80
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,400
- Mr. Wilson, he's five.
- When I was five, I had some respect.

81
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,240
You were probably an exceptional boy.

82
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,960
In 1925, I was not the exception,
I was the rule.

83
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,280
I'll make sure
Dennis doesn't come by anymore.

84
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,080
Careful how you say it.

85
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,400
I don't want everybody to think
I'm a child-hater or an ogre.

86
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,560
I'm a reasonable man
who expects reasonable treatment...

87
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,520
...from his neighbors and their children.

88
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
I was with the post office
for more than 43 years, and never once...

89
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm running a little late.

90
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,080
I'll come by after work
and we can continue the conversation.

91
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,480
There's nothing to continue.
I've said my piece. We'll leave it at that.

92
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
The boy cannot come over here
unless he behaves himself.

93
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
He won't be over at all.

94
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,120
<i>Now don't make me out to be a grump.
I didn't say "never. " I said...</i>

95
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
I really have to go.

96
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,720
<i>Well, now, don't...</i>

97
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,240
Have a good day.

98
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,600
He's out of school now.

99
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,040
He can't spend all his free time here.

100
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,640
I'm not the bad guy in this, Mitchell.

101
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm the victim!

102
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,920
George, who were you shouting at?

103
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,800
Mitchell, and I wasn't shouting.
I was making my point.

104
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,240
It's not right that his youngster
can run wild doing as he pleases...

105
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,920
...without regard to people or property.

106
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,920
He's only a boy, George.

107
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,920
He'll knot my rope once too often.

108
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,680
I can't stand that kid! He's a menace!

109
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,280
You'd better come in and have breakfast.
We're due at the Garden Club at 9:00.

110
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,240
Today is an important day for me, and
I'm already in a lather because of that kid.

111
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,520
I don't know if I'll even be able
to enjoy my moment of triumph.

112
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,480
Don't get your hopes up.

113
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
There are lots of other gardens in town
just as nice as yours.

114
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,840
Please! I'm a shoe-in.

115
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,360
Who else has a night-blooming mock orchid
flowering this year?

116
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
It's an awfully homely looking plant.

117
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,600
Hang the looks of the thing!

118
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,440
It opens before your eyes
in the light of the full moon.

119
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,000
It's a marvel, Martha.

120
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,400
Forty years to mature and blossom.

121
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,680
The flower opens and withers
in a matter of moments.

122
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,320
There isn't a gardener in town
with a plant that requires...

123
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,880
...a 40-year investment
for 10 seconds of splendor.

124
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,680
How do you feel about me working?

125
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,720
A lot of moms work.

126
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,440
The best I could do finding someone
to watch you is Mrs. Wade.

127
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,680
What about Joey?
Did you think about him?

128
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,160
What if he comes over?
He'll think I moved.

129
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,520
Joey's mother made plans
with Mrs. Wade just like I did.

130
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Joey's at Margaret's house.

131
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,760
Do it!

132
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,640
- I can make you.
- How?

133
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,760
I'll slug you back.

134
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,520
- You can't hit a girl.
- I can too.

135
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,880
Try it. I'll scream
so awfully, bloody, deadly horrible...

136
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,840
...my mom'll think you tried to murder me.

137
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,640
I'll say you did and she'll believe it.
Because boys are like that and girls aren't.

138
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,240
That really stinks.

139
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,200
Quit wasting time.

140
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,360
Mush your lips together
and let's get this over with.

141
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
Close your eyes!

142
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,760
Kiss me.

143
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,280
All right. Let's go.

144
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,160
Dennis, come on.

145
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,680
Oh, gosh.

146
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,440
Acting like a baby.

147
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,400
Get up!

148
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,240
Right this instant!

149
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,240
Don't you dare embarrass me!

150
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,080
Fine, I'll drag you inside.

151
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,480
You guys are the boring ones.
There's lots to do.

152
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Oh, really? Like what?

153
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,920
We could practice singing songs.

154
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,280
Or put on a play...

155
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,960
...or a puppet show.

156
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,520
- We could bury you alive.
- I could pound your face.

157
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,000
It doesn't matter, anyways, Margaret.

158
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,320
We'll be leaving soon
and we have work to do.

159
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,240
We're going to make a fort.

160
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,920
You can't leave unless I go with you,
or I'll tell on you.

161
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,200
So, tough kitty paws, I'm going.

162
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,360
Climb down from there. I'll get my purse.

163
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,480
This thing's been here our whole life
and we never knew it.

164
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,120
- Do you think anybody lives in it?
- Just squirrels and birds.

165
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
It looks kind of junky.

166
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,560
We'll fix it up.

167
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Good. I'll be the decorator.

168
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,040
We'll put on a special room for the babies
and a powder room for guests.

169
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,720
Forts don't have powder rooms.

170
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,160
Really?

171
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,080
Where do the soldiers' wives go
to freshen up?

172
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,680
Soldiers don't have wives, stupid.

173
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,680
Don't call me stupid, baby rump kisser!

174
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,440
It won't be a fort. It'll be a house.

175
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,080
A love nest.

176
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,120
Let's go up and see
what color carpet we should get.

177
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,280
Do forts got carpet?

178
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,520
Nope.

179
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,840
Forts don't got carpet!

180
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,160
They do now, hot lips!

181
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,760
The Selection Committee has informed...

182
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,280
...Mrs. Butterwell and I...

183
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,080
<i>...that this summer's Floraganza
will be held in the garden of...</i>

184
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
Can you read this here?

185
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,040
You take these and I'll take those.

186
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,080
There we go. The garden of...

187
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,960
...George Wilson!

188
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,040
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi...

189
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,480
...four Mississippi, five Mississippi.

190
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,680
Six Mississippi...

191
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,000
...seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi,
nine Mississippi.

192
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,200
Gunther, are you watching
where everybody goes?

193
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,400
Yep.

194
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,160
<i>Girls. Now...</i>

195
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,080
Let's go!

196
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,240
You know,
I was unbeatable at hide-and-seek.

197
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,800
Hiding or seeking?

198
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,360
Both. I had a nose for hiding places.

199
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,000
I wouldn't think you'd be much good
at hiding.

200
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,240
Why not?

201
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,200
Weren't you a fat boy?

202
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,920
I was husky.

203
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,120
Ready or not, here I come!

204
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,240
I see Joey and Mike!

205
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,640
Run, Mikey!

206
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,600
He's cheating.

207
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,400
What are you doing?

208
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,880
Dennis is cheating.
He's using the Beckman kid as a spy.

209
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,360
Leave them alone, George.

210
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,480
I'll even things up.

211
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,200
Gunther, I'm just talking to your daddy
on the telephone.

212
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,120
He's going to the ice-cream store.
He wants to take you with him.

213
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,480
Hurry up and go home!

214
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,040
Now it's fair.

215
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
You lied to a toddler, George.

216
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,640
Think how disappointed he will be
when he gets home.

217
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,560
He better get used to it.
Disappointment will be a big part of his life.

218
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,360
He's a foot short for his age.
And he's cross-eyed.

219
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,840
Ain't that a pretty sight?

220
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,160
I bet they don't even lock their doors.

221
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,240
You won't notice a toy store
on the first level...

222
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,720
...but my suggestion is this:

223
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Give the toy store six months free rent
to move up to the third level.

224
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,760
When I go to the mall with my little boy,
we always visit the toy store.

225
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,760
He knows he won't get anything unless
it's a special occasion, but like every kid...

226
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,240
...he wants to look around...

227
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,760
Could you spare us the family anecdotes?

228
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,440
There's always a lot of traffic in toy stores.

229
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,960
If people have to go up to the third level
to visit the toy store...

230
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,160
...then they have to go through
two other levels to get there.

231
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
That's apparent to anyone with children.

232
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,560
And you have to assume
that potential tenants...

233
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,160
...might have kids and would know that...

234
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,080
...and it might entice them
to take up space in the other levels.

235
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,920
That's all I'm saying.

236
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,280
We could have carried up a lot more stuff...

237
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,200
...if you didn't have to bring that idiotic doll
and all her junk!

238
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,920
She's not idiotic!
She's an important training tool.

239
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,040
You know why men are so lousy
when it comes to taking care of babies?

240
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
They have better things to do.

241
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,440
Like what? Play golf and drink beer?

242
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,200
No, like hunting, having wars, driving cars,
shaving, cleaning fish.

243
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,640
Do you know how to do that?

244
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,760
Me?

245
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,120
Margaret.

246
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, okay.

247
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,560
If you didn't have women,
you wouldn't have babies...

248
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,720
...and you wouldn't have people.

249
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,880
If you didn't have men,
who'd drive the ladies to the hospital?

250
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,320
Most important, they marry the women,
then the women can go and get the baby.

251
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,560
The baby is in her stomach!

252
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,480
She has to get it installed.
Her stomach isn't just filled up with babies.

253
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,680
- Who installs them?
- A minister and a doctor.

254
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,200
- How?
- How?

255
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,920
She wants to know how?

256
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,160
Tell me, Dennis, how?

257
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,160
The bellybutton. It opens up.

258
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,920
- How come men have them?
- So they don't look weird in bathing suits.

259
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,080
Okay, on the count of three...

260
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,880
...move your hand.

261
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
One.

262
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,440
Two.

263
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,000
Three!

264
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,840
Okay, this time on the count of four.

265
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,720
One.

266
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,120
Two.

267
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,440
Three.

268
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,040
Four!

269
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,360
Joey, you hold the hammer
and, Margaret, you hold the nail.

270
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,680
We did a pretty good job.

271
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,440
- How about a little paint?
- Couldn't hurt.

272
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,760
- You got any?
- My dad does.

273
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,240
- Give me my doll, you jerk!
- I don't have it!

274
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,320
- Give it to me! Dennis!
- I didn't take your doll.

275
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,720
It's not here. Somebody took it.

276
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,800
We've been with you.

277
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,000
Do you guys swear you didn't take it?

278
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Yep.

279
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,360
I've been robbed!

280
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,920
You don't understand.
Baby Louise is a very expensive antique.

281
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,320
Nobody robbed your doll.

282
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,320
- Maybe a bear ate it.
- What?

283
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,400
Yeah, there's no robbers in our town.

284
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,080
What are you eating there, sport?

285
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,440
A apple.

286
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,080
Hi, Mr. Mitchell.

287
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,320
Hello, Polly. Come on in.

288
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,560
- What's the helmet for?
- My girlfriend used to baby-sit for Dennis.

289
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,200
She said to bring a helmet and wear pants.

290
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,960
I'm looking for Polly.

291
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,920
You're Mickey?

292
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,280
Yeah.

293
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,240
She's up in my mom's bathroom
using the armpit perfume.

294
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,360
She says you're such a stud,
she gets nervous and sweats a lot.

295
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,400
Cool.

296
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,320
Come on in.

297
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,160
Tastes funny.

298
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,600
Tastes like paint.

299
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,720
And wood.

300
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,200
I'll make us some sandwiches.

301
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,680
<i>"'Do not cry, little locomotive,'...</i>

302
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,000
<i>"... said old Engine Number 99 to Huffy.</i>

303
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,480
<i>"'One day when you grow up,
you will realize...</i>

304
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,440
<i>"'... that all trains are impotent, important...</i>

305
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,520
<i>"'... even little mail trains. "'</i>

306
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,200
How can a train grow?

307
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,280
He eats all his coal
and gets plenty of sleep.

308
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,440
No, what's the point of reading lies?

309
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,360
It teaches kids to eat all their food...

310
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,160
...and go to bed when they're supposed to.

311
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,440
And not cry when mean cabooses
and boxcars make fun of them.

312
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,160
This is so stupid.

313
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,040
Are you ready to get out of here
and go to bed, yet?

314
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,440
I'm not even wrinkled up yet.
Keep reading.

315
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,160
<i>"'I will never be big enough to pull anything
but silly old mail cars,'...</i>

316
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,280
<i>"... sobbed Huffy.</i>

317
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,400
<i>"Sob...</i>

318
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,080
<i>"Sobbobed Huffy. "</i>

319
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,240
Where are you going?

320
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,400
I'm going to investigate Mitchell's garage.

321
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,160
Dennis has been fooling around with paint.
I know it, and I will prove it.

322
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,400
Aren't you taking this a bit far, George?

323
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,800
He's only a boy.

324
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,880
Kids!

325
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,320
G.D. Wading pool!

326
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,840
That's it!

327
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,440
Gee, I guess those kids took off.

328
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,680
I got him this time.

329
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,960
Mitchell can't deny it.

330
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,240
Sorry. Good night.

331
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,840
He's only a boy, huh?

332
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,720
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.

333
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,720
Is Mr. Wilson up yet?

334
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,320
Not yet, dear.

335
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,880
How long do you think he's going to sleep?

336
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,040
Not too much longer.
He's having his picture taken this morning.

337
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,680
- For what?
- He's being honored for his garden.

338
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,720
Do you think he would get mad
if I went upstairs?

339
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,920
What do you want to go upstairs for?

340
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,280
<i>I made an "I'm Sorry I Shot Paint
on Your Chicken" card.</i>

341
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,840
That's very nice, Dennis.

342
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,280
I'm kind of busy today,
so I won't have a chance to give it to him.

343
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,000
I have to go to Margaret's house...

344
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,920
...because we're getting poor,
and my mom's got a job now.

345
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,600
Could I leave it by his whisker cutter?

346
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,280
<i>That's where I leave
my dad's "Sorry" cards.</i>

347
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,960
And it's a good time to say you're sorry.

348
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,760
Grownup guys are happy in the morning
when they wake up.

349
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,960
My dad's so happy...

350
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,200
...he whistles
when he goes to the bathroom.

351
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,920
The only time he isn't happy
is on Sunday morning...

352
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,520
...when he and my mom wrestle.

353
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,520
They like to be alone when they do that.

354
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,720
I think it's because they take off
their shirts.

355
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,360
Then they start to make funny noises...

356
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,480
You can go up...

357
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,440
...as long as you promise
not to disturb Mr. Wilson.

358
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,800
I promise.

359
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
You know what, Mrs. Wilson?

360
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,800
What?

361
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,720
You're the nicest old gal on the block.

362
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,400
Hello.

363
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,520
My name is Dennis Mitchell.

364
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,000
<i>I'm the doctor. Open up and say...</i>

365
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,800
Hello.

366
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,160
Mr. Wilson.

367
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,480
George? Are you ready?

368
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,040
The photographer's here.

369
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,720
I got a 9:30, ma'am.

370
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,880
He'll be out any second.

371
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,080
Sorry.

372
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,120
George?

373
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,120
That looks fine, Martha. Leave it alone.

374
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,640
Martha, step back. You're in the picture.

375
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,640
Very good.

376
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,200
Now...

377
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,400
...smile.

378
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,680
Hey, you.

379
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, you. Come here.

380
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,640
I haven't seen you around here before.

381
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,400
Maybe because
I've never been around here.

382
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,880
What are you up to?

383
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,520
What's it to you?

384
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,560
Now, look.

385
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,760
I run a nice, clean town here
and I don't want any trouble.

386
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,240
My advice to you
is just follow the sun out of here.

387
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,880
Only reason I ain't moving on because
you stopped to give me the breeze.

388
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,920
<i>You have to go to two other levels
to get there and...</i>

389
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,120
Can I call you back?

390
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,080
Hi, Mom.

391
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,200
Good morning.

392
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,360
I hear you're trying to beg off
the Oklahoma City trip.

393
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,760
I asked that it be rescheduled.

394
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,560
Have a Cub Scout meeting or something?

395
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,840
My husband has a trip
that was scheduled before mine.

396
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,840
If you two are traveling at the same time,
no one can watch your kid.

397
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,200
Is that the problem?

398
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,800
- It's not a problem, per se.
- Oh, good.

399
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,840
Because if you want to blow off your trip,
I have to cover for you.

400
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,400
And I have plans I can't break.

401
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,720
I don't have kids but...

402
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,120
...I do have a life.

403
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,760
I'm sorry.

404
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,280
I just won't be able to help you.

405
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
God.

406
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
- Okay.
- Who do we call first?

407
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,240
Let's start with the A's.

408
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Vicki?

409
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,920
- You call.
- No, you call.

410
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,200
Hello.

411
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,760
Hi. This is Mrs. Mitchell.

412
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,680
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

413
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,920
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

414
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,280
No.

415
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,840
This is Henry Mitchell.

416
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
This is Henry Mitchell.

417
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,440
You call.

418
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,840
Hey, Mr. Wilson. I'm sleeping at your joint.

419
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,560
- I brought you some grasshoppers.
- You shouldn't have.

420
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,280
I'll take them, dear.

421
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Thank you so much, Martha. George.

422
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,080
It's our pleasure.

423
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,440
- You saved our lives.
- Save two, lose one.

424
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
I'll call you just as soon as I arrive.

425
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,040
- Do you have our number?
- Don't worry about a thing.

426
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,000
I brought my own pillow
so I don't get my spit on yours.

427
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,600
Thank you, dear.

428
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,400
Be a good boy, okay?

429
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,600
Mind your manners
and listen to Mr. And Mrs. Wilson.

430
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,920
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

431
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,640
Honey?

432
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,840
Bye-bye.

433
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,120
Bring me something good.

434
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,360
'Bye, sweetheart.

435
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,840
'Bye, Dennis.

436
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,880
George, take Dennis' suitcase
up to the guest room, please.

437
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,480
- He's got arms.
- Don't start, dear.

438
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,440
You know why I'm not crying?

439
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,400
Because if I can't be with my parents...

440
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,080
...the person I want to be with is you.

441
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,080
I can't tell you how deeply moved I am.

442
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,880
Don't do that, please.

443
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,720
What?

444
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,920
The cord.

445
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,600
Stop that tapping.

446
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,280
There's not a lot to do around the house
when it's raining out.

447
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,120
- Do you wanna play cards?
- No.

448
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,200
Want to put on your old Navy suit
and play war?

449
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,320
- Is that pirates' gold?
- No.

450
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,600
Is it real valuable?

451
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,200
Yes.

452
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,200
Is that why you keep it in your safe?

453
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,400
Uh-huh.

454
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,880
How come your safe looks like books?

455
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,160
How come you ask so many questions?

456
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,000
I've only been around for five years.

457
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,080
There's a lot of stuff I don't know.

458
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,760
The safe looks like books...

459
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,480
...so if a thief does come in,
he won't recognize it.

460
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,240
- Is a thief a robber?
- Yes.

461
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,200
- Have you ever had a robber here?
- No.

462
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,920
What's the combination to your lock?

463
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,880
You're the last person in the world
I'd tell that to.

464
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,360
You've got it wrote down someplace?

465
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,760
It's in my head.

466
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,400
- What's that mean?
- It means I know it. I remember it.

467
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,160
- What if you forget it?
- I won't forget it. It's a familiar number.

468
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,560
I won't forget it.

469
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,360
What's that mean?

470
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,840
It means it's a number
that I use all the time, so I won't forget it.

471
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,920
I use it all the time.

472
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,080
- I bet I know what it is.
- I doubt that.

473
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,440
I bet it's your address.

474
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,640
Know how I know?

475
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,400
My friend has a bike lock...

476
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,840
...and he uses his address
for the combination so he won't forget.

477
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,120
- You're just as smart as him.
- He.

478
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,840
You got everything figured out, don't you?

479
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,440
I haven't figured out
how to get my work done...

480
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,400
...with you in the house.

481
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,480
That's a tough one.

482
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,200
Are you wrinkled enough yet, Dennis?

483
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,840
- Yep.
- Want me to come help you out of the tub?

484
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,720
Not unless you want to see
what the stork saw.

485
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,160
Cool!

486
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,880
Old Faithful.

487
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,360
- How old is this bed?
- It belonged to my mother.

488
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,560
What's she sleeping on?

489
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,120
She's been gone for many years, Dennis.

490
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,840
- On business?
- No.

491
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,200
She's in heaven.

492
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,800
There's an awful lot of people in heaven.

493
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,280
Especially old people.

494
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,280
How about if I recite my favorite poem
when I was your age?

495
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,000
- Is it about flowers and lambs?
- No.

496
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,800
Okay.

I wish he'd get that hernia fixed.

George, are you sleeping?

521
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,520
I was until you started yakking.

522
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,200
I'm sorry.

523
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,560
Was Dennis in our bathroom?

524
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,160
Yes.

525
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,960
I think the little rat
put mouthwash in my nasal spray...

526
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,160
...and toilet cleanser in my mouthwash.

527
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,960
Why would he do something like that?

528
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,320
Must you ask?

529
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,040
Quiet!

530
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,360
I recited a poem for Dennis tonight...

531
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,600
...that my mother used to recite to me.

532
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,840
I remembered every word.

533
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,000
In some tiny measure...

534
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,120
...my mother would be proud
I passed something on.

535
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,560
It's 10:00, Martha.

536
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,560
Don't start with the regrets.

537
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,400
I would have been a good mother.

538
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,680
And I would have made a swell fireman.

539
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,800
- Where are you going?
- To make myself a cup of tea.

540
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,640
I didn't decree
that we wouldn't have children.

541
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,400
That was out of both our hands.

542
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,440
This isn't about having children
or not having children.

543
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,440
You miss the point.

544
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,240
It's about...

545
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,040
...my feeling something very good...

546
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,120
...and not being able to tell you about it.

547
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,320
Martha?

548
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,160
I didn't mean to hurt you.

549
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,920
I'm not terribly good
with feelings and emotions.

550
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,960
There are a lot of subjects
I'd just as soon not bring up or discuss.

551
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,640
I would have liked a son or a daughter.

552
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,080
You couldn't fire the fatherly feelings
in me...

553
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,560
...because they're not there.

554
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,760
But that doesn't mean my feelings for you
have gone cold.

555
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,560
That'll never happen.

556
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,800
You've got all the love I have.

557
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,520
Remember this?

558
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,200
<i>Je t'aime. Je t'adore. Ma petite chérie.</i>

559
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,920
George.

560
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,840
Get out of here!

561
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,440
What are you looking for now?

562
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,600
Garden lanterns.

563
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,840
You must be pretty brave to ride
on a tiger in your underpants.

564
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,360
Put that away. That's not for kids!

565
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,400
Martha.

566
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,240
Where are the G.D. Garden lanterns?

567
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,360
I think I better go outside and play.

568
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,560
Hello.

569
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,360
Hello, Martha.

570
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,400
It's Alice.

571
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,880
I'm still in Oklahoma.

572
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,480
Oh, dear.

573
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,880
<i>Yes, there's a terrible storm.</i>

574
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,160
<i>My flight's been cancelled.</i>

575
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,800
Till the weather clears,
I don't know what's going to happen.

576
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,080
<i>I know your garden party's tonight.
I feel terrible.</i>

577
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,360
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

578
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,920
Don't worry about it.
You get home when you can.

579
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,280
We'll be just fine here.

580
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
What's George going to say?

581
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,120
Over my dead body!

582
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,960
This is my crowning moment of retired life
and I won't throw it away like the trash...

583
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,480
...for a ninny who can't get her keister
to the airport on time.

584
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,400
George Wilson,
you have no right to insult Alice.

585
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,360
She can't help the weather,
any more than you or I.

586
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,960
It's just plain bad luck.

587
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,720
It's no one's fault.

588
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,360
A tragedy of this magnitude
has to be somebody's fault.

589
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,080
It isn't a tragedy.

590
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,840
A little boy's going to join us for a party.

591
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,720
If you want to forsake your neighbors
when they need help, do it alone.

592
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,480
Why is it, when everyone else
feasts on the pleasures of life...

593
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,880
...I get the indigestion?

594
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,000
Because you're an old grump.

595
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,400
We did a pretty good job.

596
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,280
Uh-huh.

597
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,760
Now we can order furniture
and major appliances.

598
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,200
Well, Dennis...

599
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,640
<i>...your mother did not arrive.
- Nope.</i>

600
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,000
This is an important event for me.

601
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,400
I know.

602
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,160
I don't want any nonsense.

603
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,560
You mind whatever manners you have
and don't be a pest.

604
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,560
Okay.

605
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,320
Don't embarrass me.

606
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,400
Okay.

607
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,920
Cheek pinchers.

608
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,240
Look at the cute little boy.

609
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,120
Are you our little host?

610
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,960
The party's in the back.

611
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,480
Ladies, girls, the party's in the back.

612
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,960
Thank you very much.
It's just this way, thank you.

613
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,160
Don't embarrass me.

614
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,120
Attention, everyone.

615
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,960
Gather over here, please.

616
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,240
Have a seat.
It's time to begin the ceremony.

617
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,920
All right, members, don't be timid.

618
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,320
Move down front. Plenty of seats.

619
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,360
Either side, either side.

620
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,080
<i>"On behalf of the Garden Club...</i>

621
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,840
<i>"Selection Committee.</i>

622
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,120
<i>- "We'd like to present...
- "George Wilson. "</i>

623
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,360
<i>"With this beautiful... "</i>

624
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,240
What does that say?

625
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,440
<i>"Plague. " What does that mean?</i>

626
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,000
<i>- Here, let me have your glasses.
- No. I...</i>

627
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,920
<i>"Plaque. " Come on up, George.</i>

628
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,920
Thank you, everyone. I am honored.

629
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,600
I will cherish this forever.

630
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,400
Forty years ago...

631
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,720
...when I started this garden,
I planted a seed.

632
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,200
From that tiny seed...

633
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,080
...grew this grand plant.

634
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,440
Tonight...

635
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,840
...for the first and only time
in its entire life, it will blossom.

636
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,840
As we await this glorious moment...

637
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,320
...Martha and I invite you
to have some desert and coffee.

638
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,800
Congratulations.

639
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,240
George, would you bring the coffee?

640
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,320
George, don't start, George.

641
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,360
Could you get somebody
to come and clear this away?

642
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,040
I made a mistake.

643
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,640
Mr. Wilson!

644
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,520
Somebody robbed your house.

645
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,360
Forty years down the drain.

646
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,720
You're a pest.

647
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,960
A menace.

648
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,640
A selfish, spoiled little boy
and I have no use for you.

649
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,920
You took something from me
that I can never get back.

650
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,600
Something that means more to me
than you ever will.

651
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,360
You understand?

652
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,920
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to know you.

653
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,120
Get out of my way.

654
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.

655
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,960
Party's over, everybody. Go on home.

656
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,280
I'm sorry.

657
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,840
Oh, my God!

658
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,560
Where's Dennis?

659
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,480
Joey hasn't seen him all night?

660
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,240
Okay.

661
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,800
Well, if he shows up, please call me.

662
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,320
'Bye.

663
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,120
- Did you call the Wades?
- Yes.

664
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,000
But that's the last place he'd go.

665
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,840
<i>Don't you ever come back here again.</i>

666
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,080
<i>He's a menace.</i>

667
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,800
<i>Turn that off!</i>

668
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,760
<i>Don't make a pest of yourself
and don't embarrass me.</i>

669
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,520
<i>I don't want to know you.
I don't want to see you.</i>

670
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,280
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

671
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,560
These woods are pretty scary at night.

672
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,920
I'm sure glad I ran into a grownup.

673
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,000
It'll work out real nice.

674
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,920
- You can be my hostage.
- Cool!

675
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,960
I can only be your hostage till tomorrow.

676
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,280
I have church in the morning.

677
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,200
You ain't going to church.

678
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,800
You and me are catching the midnight train
out of here.

679
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,840
Really?

680
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,880
We better stop at my house first.
I have to tell my mom and dad...

681
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,080
...or else they'll worry.

682
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,080
And I must get clean underwear
and my camera...

683
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,160
...and tell my parents to feed my fish...

684
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,560
...some sun block...

685
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,840
...and vitamins and stuff to play with
on the train so I don't get bored.

686
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,120
Put a cork in it.
You're giving me a headache.

687
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,200
I don't have a cork.

688
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,800
Shut your mouth!

689
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,880
I can't because my nose is stuffy
because of my allergies.

690
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,760
If I shut my mouth, I can't breathe good.

691
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,520
Then keep your mouth open, but don't talk!

692
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,680
Where do you put the cork
when you put a cork in it?

693
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,400
Didn't I ask you to shut your yap?

694
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,520
What's a yap?

695
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,680
It's your mouth.

696
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,480
I can't shut my mouth
because my nose is stuffy.

697
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,720
Shut up!

698
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,920
I have one more question.

699
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,680
What?

700
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,360
What does a hostage have to do?

701
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:54,880
Nothing.

702
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,200
How come you need one?

703
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,200
In case the cops show up.

704
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,160
Do I get to use a gun?

705
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,520
You get to stand in front of me
if the cops use a gun.

706
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,520
I've got a slingshot.

707
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,560
Swell.

708
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,720
I'm a good shot. Want to see?

709
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,200
Excuse me, mister. Do you want to see?

710
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,040
Mister, can you watch me for a minute?

711
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,200
I'll tell you when to look.

712
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,040
Look!

713
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,280
Your fire's getting puny.

714
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,280
When my dad's fire gets puny,
he wiggles it around and it gets bigger.

715
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,480
Dennis!

716
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,600
Dennis!

717
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,640
I'm sorry
you're not having a very fun camping trip.

718
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,480
Nobody shoots a marble at my head...

719
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,400
...and sets my pants on fire.

720
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,080
That was an accident.

721
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,880
There ain't going to be no more accidents!

722
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,840
Turn around!

723
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,400
You're doing it wrong.

724
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,720
Get lost.

725
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,600
I tied up lots of guys in my life.

726
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,120
I bet you've never tied up a 5-year-old.
I'll just get out.

727
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,040
I'll tie it so tight
you won't be able to move.

728
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,280
The rope's too big and my legs are
too small to make it tight enough.

729
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,000
There's only one way to do it
and I know because...

730
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,880
...many people have tried to tie me up
but it doesn't work.

731
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,240
But you try your way.

732
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,920
I'll get out
and you'll just have to keep doing it.

733
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,160
What do you do differently?

734
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,520
First, you must tie up each leg by itself.

735
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Then you tie them together.

736
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,760
No matter how much I wiggle,
I can't ever get out.

737
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,360
<i>If you really don't want me to move at all...</i>

738
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,360
Bend down.

739
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,880
You can't get out of that at all, right?

740
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:45,960
Nope.

741
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:50,440
You tie me up like that, no matter
how much I try, I can't ever get out.

742
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,680
Thanks.

743
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,200
- Now let me loose.
- Okay.

744
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,840
Get the handcuff key.

745
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,920
- Where is it?
- On my bag.

746
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,520
What?

747
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,800
Dennis!

748
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,600
Dennis!

749
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,560
I'm going to kill you.

750
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,840
How? You can't move. Open up.

751
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,800
I ain't hungry!

752
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,400
It's the only way to get the key.

753
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,240
You can't waste food.

754
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,640
Plus, you must eat your dinner.

755
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,680
Come on.

756
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,360
Come on.

757
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,240
It's coming.

758
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,080
Too hot?

759
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,560
You must have swallowed it.

760
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,640
I swallowed my allowance once.

761
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,960
I had to wait a whole night and a day
to get it back.

762
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,400
Dennis!

763
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,840
Firewood. Bombs away!

764
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,480
Poor little lamb.

765
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,040
He must be exhausted.

766
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:13,120
I better cover him up
so he doesn't catch his death of cold.

767
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,520
There we go.

768
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,080
What's he got a purse for?

769
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,600
Holy smokes!

770
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,200
He's rich!

771
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,800
Don't worry, I got it!

772
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,080
I got it! I got it!

773
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,920
Dennis!

774
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,920
I've lost the only man I ever loved.

775
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,920
I'll get you out of there.

776
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,720
You shouldn't jump in a river
with handcuffs on, for God's sake!

777
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,120
You could drown.

778
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,080
Hold on. I'm coming.

779
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,200
Hey, mister!

780
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,320
Good thing I know a lot about ropes, huh?

781
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,680
That's my boy!

782
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,360
Mr. Wilson taught me how to tie knots.

783
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:39,280
When I get you out, I'm going to bed.
I'm beat.

784
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,240
It must be all the fresh air.

785
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,040
Hold on, I'm coming.

786
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:00,040
There you go. Now just pull yourself in.

787
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,360
This is Mr. Wilson's gold.

788
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,160
- How come you got it?
- I stole it.

789
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,960
You're a robber?

790
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,160
I'm a thief.

791
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,720
Say your prayers, little rat!

792
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,160
I can't. I didn't take my bath yet.

793
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,000
Have it your own way.

794
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,280
Martha!

795
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,560
Mitchell!

796
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,920
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

797
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,800
- Guess what?
- What?

798
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,360
I got your gold back.

799
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,080
Dennis!

800
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,920
Mom! Dad!

801
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,720
Oh, sweetheart! Thank God, you're okay.

802
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,160
Help.

803
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,880
This is my buddy. This is my pal.

804
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,480
Wait a minute.

805
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,560
You can tell everybody at the big house
you met our Dennis Mitchell.

806
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,720
All right. Let's wrap it up.

807
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,560
Mister.

808
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,120
You forgot something.

809
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:12,960
Dennis!

810
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,960
I like that rhubarb pie that Martha makes.

811
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,640
- Wonderful dinner.
- Thank you, Henry.

812
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,720
Alice, your coffee.

813
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,600
Guess what?

814
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,320
I won't have to travel anymore.

815
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,720
That's nice.

816
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,120
They want me to work on the project here.

817
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,640
They agreed to start a daycare center
so I can take Dennis with me to work.

818
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,320
That's ridiculous!

819
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,280
What the heck's he going to do all day?

820
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,880
Don't be foolish.

821
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,920
We're right next door. We can watch him.

822
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,320
Well, of course. We'd love to.

823
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,600
<i>I don't think...</i>

824
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:17,000
I mean, you must remember back
to all the times Dennis upset you.

825
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,840
This is a new ball game.
I've learned a few things.

826
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,080
Kids are kids.

827
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,320
You have to play by their rules.

828
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,120
If you can't do that, you're in trouble.

829
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,160
You must roll with the punches.

830
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,440
You must expect the unexpected.

831
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:00,160
Aren't you supposed to be
in the daycare area with the other children?

832
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,400
That's where I was, but I had to leave.

833
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,440
The lady who watches the kids said...

834
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,480
...if she had to look at me
for five more seconds...

835
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,240
...she'd jump out the window.

836
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,880
She's a pretty nice lady...

837
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,000
...so I wouldn't want her to do that.

838
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,640
Can I push the button?

839
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,280
No, because you don't know
which button to push.

840
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,200
It's this one!

841
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,960
I'm going to get this little kid!
