1
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,966
All her life she had wanted
to teach at Wellesley College.

2
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:22,161
So when a position opened
in the Art History department...

3
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:26,069
...she pursued it single-mindedly
until she was hired.

4
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:34,011
It was whispered
that Katherine Watson...

5
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:36,715
...a first-year teacher
from Oakland State...

6
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,118
...made up in brains
what she lacked in pedigree.

7
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,229
Which was why this bohemian
from California...

8
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:57,738
... was on her way to the most
conservative college in the nation.

9
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,503
-Excuse me, please.
-Oh , sorry.

10
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:03,874
Excuse me.

11
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:10,217
Excuse me. The bus?

12
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,083
-Keep walking, ma'am.
-Thank you.

13
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:16,023
But Katherine Watson didn't come
to Wellesley to fit in.

14
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:20,623
She came to Wellesley because
she wanted to make a difference.

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,428
-Violet.
-My favorite ltalian professor.

16
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:26,571
-Nice summer?
-Terrific, thanks.

17
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,900
-Who's that over there?
-Where?

18
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:33,737
Oh, Katherine Watson. New teacher.
Art History. I'm dying to meet her.

19
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:38,044
Who knocks at the Door of Learning?

20
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:42,775
-I am every woman.
-What do you seek?

21
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:45,544
To awaken my spirit
through hard work...

22
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,984
...and dedicate my life
to knowledge.

23
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:49,589
Then you are welcome.

24
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,855
All women who seek to follow you
can enter here.

25
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:59,763
I now declare
the academic year begun.

26
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,517
A shame you didn't come yesterday.
It's so quiet before the girls arrive.

27
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,598
Just a few rules.
No holes in the walls.

28
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:34,397
No pets, no loud noises, no radio
or hi-fi after 8 on weekdays...

29
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,267
...10 on weekends...

30
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,899
...no hot plates and no male visitors.

31
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,872
Anything wrong?

32
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,344
I don't think I can go a year
without a hot plate.

33
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,450
Don't you just love chintz?

34
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,492
And look.

35
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,330
They match.

36
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:07,438
Sweet, right? Your room's here.

37
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,633
My room is just across the way...

38
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,907
...and Amanda Armstrong's
down the other end.

39
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,210
-You grew up here?
-My whole life.

40
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:22,219
You'll meet my parents
when they come to visit.

41
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,688
-They visit?
-Regularly.

42
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:33,860
-What do you teach?
-Speech, elocution and poise.

43
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:36,736
Dinners are communal,
so I'll handle that.

44
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:40,499
But breakfast and lunch,
you're on your own. So...

45
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:45,738
...we each get our own shelf.
I'll make your label this evening.

46
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:52,119
I don't need to tell you, everything on
our individual shelves is sacrosanct.

47
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:57,619
I just knew when we met...

48
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,927
...we'd be instant friends.

49
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:23,643
Be careful. They can smell fear.

50
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,806
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

51
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:48,804
Thank you.

52
00:06:49,547 --> 00:06:54,415
This is History of Art 100.

53
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:59,012
We'll be following
Dr. Staunton's syllabus.

54
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,158
-Any questions so far?
-Your name?

55
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,526
-Why don't you go first?
-Connie Baker.

56
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:10,361
-Katherine Watson. Nice to meet you.
-Dr. Watson, I presume.

57
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,700
-Not yet. And you are?
-Giselle Levy.

58
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,434
Giselle. If someone could get the--

59
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:22,647
-Susan Delacorte.
-Thank you, Susan Delacorte.

60
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:31,089
From the beginning, man has always
had the impulse to create art.

61
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:34,693
-Can anyone tell me what this is?
-Wounded Bison, Altamira, Spain...

62
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:38,125
...about 15,000 B.C.
Joan Brandwyn.

63
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,497
Very good, Joan.

64
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:44,859
Despite the age of these, they are
technically sophisticated because--

65
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,532
The shading and the thickness of the
lines moving over the bison's hump.

66
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,645
-ls that right?
-Yes, that's exactly right.

67
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:56,405
Next slide.

68
00:07:56,951 --> 00:08:01,011
This is probably less familiar.
It was discovered by archeologists--

69
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,148
In 1879, Lascaux, France.
Dates back to 10,000 B.C.

70
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:09,626
Singled out because of flowing lines
depicting the movement of the animal.

71
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,496
-lmpressive. Name?
-Herd of Horses.

72
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,866
-I meant yours.
-We call her Flicka.

73
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:21,270
Elizabeth Warren.
They call me Betty.

74
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,035
Very good.

75
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,874
Betty is also correct.

76
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:29,950
Just because something is ancient
doesn't mean that it is primitive.

77
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,349
For example. Next slide, please.

78
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:35,012
Mycerinus and His Queen. 2,470 B.C.

79
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:37,681
It's a funerary statue
of the pharaoh and queen...

80
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:42,160
...originally intended to preserve
the pharaoh's ka. Soul.

81
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,669
Have any of you taken
Art History before?

82
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:51,067
No.

83
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,403
Let's go on. Slide.

84
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,680
Seated Scribe. Egypt. 2,400 B.C.

85
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:04,246
Peasant Couple Plowing.
Sixteenth century B.C. Egypt.

86
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,982
Snake Goddess.
Minoan. 1,600 B.C.

87
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,692
Fresco. Minoan. 1,600 B.C.

88
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:13,755
Funeral Mask. Mycenaean. 1,200.

89
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:27,508
Could someone please get--?

90
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,980
Thank you.

91
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:40,923
By a show of hands only...

92
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:45,924
...how many of you have read
the entire text?

93
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:53,770
-And the suggested supplements.
-Long way from Oakland State?

94
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,643
Well, you girls do prepare.

95
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:03,577
If you've nothing else for us,
we could go to independent study.

96
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,109
Ac--

97
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:48,989
I was in California once. How do you
get work done with all that sunshine?

98
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:52,960
-We tan in class.
-Really?

99
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,532
No.

100
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:01,435
You know, not everybody
wanted you.

101
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:04,101
I'm not naming any names.

102
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,875
These jobs usually go quickly.
Ex-students, friends of, you know...

103
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:11,383
...the right people.

104
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:15,489
The person they wanted took a job at
Brown, and no one else was available.

105
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,751
So here you are.

106
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:22,394
You can go in now. Good luck.

107
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:31,203
Your first class left a lot
to be desired, Miss Watson.

108
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:35,037
And I'm curious about the subject
of your dissertation.

109
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:40,148
You suggest, "Picasso will do
for the 20th century...

110
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:44,276
...what Michelangelo did
for the Renaissance, " unquote.

111
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,490
In terms of influencing movements.

112
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:50,855
So these canvases that
they're turning out these days...

113
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,088
...with paint dripped
and splotched on them...

114
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:59,225
...they're as worthy of our attention
as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel?

115
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,567
I'm not comparing them.

116
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:05,369
Have you ever seen
the Sistine Chapel, Miss Watson?

117
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:07,535
Actually stood there?

118
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:11,046
I've never been to Europe.

119
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,120
I can assure all of you this is the place
I want to be more than anything.

120
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:23,785
Better discipline next class,
Miss Watson.

121
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,364
-Hello.
-It's me.

122
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,566
-Hey!
-Collect from Katherine Watson.

123
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:38,301
-Will you accept?
-Yeah, sure, of course I will.

124
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:41,140
Hey, is everything okay?

125
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,404
Yeah.

126
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:46,309
Tough, huh?

127
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:51,913
Well, how are the classes?

128
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,492
Snobs, right?

129
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:59,892
-I hate to say I told you so.
-You don't have to.

130
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:08,567
I can't really talk right now.

131
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,711
I'll write you tonight.

132
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:17,341
So you got a fella?

133
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:22,052
He's-- He's there. I'm here.

134
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:27,685
Long distance. Torture. I know.
Come. Come in and sit down.

135
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:35,530
When Lenny left for the South Pacific,
it nearly broke my heart.

136
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:38,434
We wrote every day until....

137
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,203
He was a great man.

138
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:46,948
-I'm sorry.
-lt was a hundred years ago.

139
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,913
I'm babbling.

140
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:56,182
I love Lucy.
Even if she is a communist.

141
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,226
The only thing red about Lucy
is her hair.

142
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:01,864
And even that's fake. Desi said it.

143
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:03,966
Winchell wrote it.

144
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,669
Amanda Armstrong.
I see you survived.

145
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,703
Katherine Watson. Just barely.

146
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,002
Oh, good. You've met.
Katherine's taken the third bedroom.

147
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:16,169
How about a little dinner
before What's My Line?

148
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:19,740
How about a little drink?

149
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,952
Her companion died in May.

150
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:26,821
Companion?

151
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,024
You know, companion.

152
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:37,159
Josephine Burns.
Taught biology here for 30 years.

153
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,667
You'll love it here, Katherine.
You'll see.

154
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:48,778
I already do. I-- Honestly,
it's beautiful. It's perfect, really.

155
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:53,509
Well, don't fool yourself. They have
claws underneath their white gloves.

156
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:56,287
Who?

157
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,617
The alumnae, their offspring,
the faculty. You name it.

158
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:03,791
Watch out for yourself.

159
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:06,021
Too much independence
frightens them.

160
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,965
-Will you please stop?
-Oh, a word of advice.

161
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:13,537
Don't let those girls
know that they got to you.

162
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:19,102
-They didn't.
-Good for you.

163
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:22,844
You almost convinced me.

164
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:56,116
-What is that?
-You tell me.

165
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:03,387
Carcass by Soutine. 1 925.

166
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:07,818
-It's not on the syllabus.
-No, it's not.

167
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:12,095
Is it any good?

168
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:21,970
Come on, ladies.
There's no wrong answer.

169
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:25,637
There's also no textbook
telling you what to think.

170
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,709
It's not that easy, is it?

171
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:32,152
All right. No. It's not good.

172
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:35,120
In fact, I wouldn't even call it art.
It's grotesque.

173
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,190
Is there a rule against
grotesque art?

174
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,853
I think there's something
aggressive about it...

175
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,762
-...and erotic.
-To you, everything is erotic.

176
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,336
-Everything is erotic.
-Girls.

177
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,735
-Aren't there standards?
-Of course.

178
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,274
Otherwise a tacky velvet painting
could be equated to a Rembrandt.

179
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:57,642
My Uncle Ferdie has two tacky velvet
paintings. He loves those clowns.

180
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:03,550
There are standards, technique,
composition, color, even subject.

181
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,714
So if you're suggesting
that rotted side of meat is art...

182
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,055
...much less good art,
then what are we going to learn?

183
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,787
Just that.

184
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,525
You have outlined our new syllabus,
Betty. Thank you.

185
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,603
What is art?
What makes it good or bad?

186
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,740
And who decides?

187
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,175
Next slide, please.

188
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,271
Twenty-five years ago someone
thought this was brilliant.

189
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,712
-I can see that.
-Who?

190
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,411
My mother. I painted it
for her birthday.

191
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,786
Next slide. This is my mom.

192
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,692
-ls it art?
-It's a snapshot.

193
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:47,799
If I told you Ansel Adams had taken it,
would that make a difference?

194
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:53,271
-Art isn't art until someone says it is.
-It's art!

195
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:57,272
-The right people.
-Who are they?

196
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,843
Betty Warren!

197
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:02,574
-We're lucky we have one right here.
-Screw you.

198
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:06,751
Could you go back
to the Soutine, please?

199
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:13,118
Just look at it again.
Look beyond the paint.

200
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:18,164
Let us try to open our minds
to a new idea.

201
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:25,164
All right, back to chapter three.
Has anyone read it?

202
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:28,466
Okay.

203
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:34,815
"When your courses are set,
and a dream boat you've met...

204
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:37,008
...have a real cigarette.
Have a Camel."

205
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:41,212
I've got my courses, I've got my Camel
cigarette. Where is my dream boat?

206
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,916
-Giselle, where is my dream boat?
-Betty's cousin isn't good enough?

207
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:47,118
-I haven't met him.
-Don't encourage her.

208
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:49,856
He's only escorting
Connie as a favor.

209
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,966
Why are you like this?

210
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,728
I didn't mean that.

211
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:57,566
I'm just under so much pressure
with the wedding.

212
00:18:57,741 --> 00:19:00,709
Do you realize November 2
is three weeks from now?

213
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,811
-Oh, honey.
-Don't have it.

214
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,606
-Don't come.
-Here. Here.

215
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:07,979
I'm working on table seating now,
so I can just erase your name.

216
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:09,414
-Can I see it?
-No.

217
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,611
Let me look.
I can't look for a second?

218
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,190
-You want to see where Bill is sitting.
-No. That is over. Right?

219
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:18,022
Right? Giselle, right?

220
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:21,555
Damn it.

221
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:31,064
-Do I look a little bit like her?
-Like who?

222
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:35,035
-Katherine Watson.
-You mean, "crap is art"?

223
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:40,046
-I think she's fabulous.
-Well, no man wanted her.

224
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:43,614
-She isn't dead.
-She's at least 30.

225
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,849
-Oh, no. No.
-I guess she never wanted children.

226
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:48,960
For your information...

227
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:55,158
...Katherine Watson had to take
this job to escape from California.

228
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,130
Please.

229
00:19:57,304 --> 00:20:01,205
She had a torrid affair
with a Hollywood movie star.

230
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:05,708
-She came here to get away.
-That's ridiculous.

231
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,609
-Who was it?
-I don't know.

232
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,676
Who was it, Giselle?
Don't be a pimple! Tell me!

233
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:14,548
-It's ridiculous.
-Tell me. No, it's not. You know.

234
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:18,350
-You know something. Tell me.
-It's William Holden.

235
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:21,556
-Fantastic!
-I know.

236
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,356
Who is it?

237
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,733
William Holden.

238
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:39,440
I know. I know. I'm late. I'm-- Abject
pleading, apologies, forgiveness.

239
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:41,272
Is she giving you any trouble?

240
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:45,147
If these girls can't get back on time,
know what I say? Lock them out.

241
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:50,848
Come on. Out! I'm going
to lock the door. Out!

242
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:56,427
Bedtime, ladies. Bedtime.
Let's go. Bedtime.

243
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,126
-Hey, Betty.
-Quiet time, ladies.

244
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:01,735
Women like Katherine Watson
don't get married...

245
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:04,930
-...because they choose not to.
-No woman chooses to live...

246
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:08,543
...without a home, unless she's
sleeping with her ltalian professor.

247
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:10,871
-You are so critical.
-I am not.

248
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,537
Of course you are.
You're your mother's daughter.

249
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:15,479
It's a classic Electra complex.

250
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:18,249
I don't blame you. I mean...

251
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:20,582
...who wouldn't want
to murder your mother?

252
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:23,954
-Hey. How's the Harvard sweetheart?
-Divine.

253
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:26,220
Got an extra ciggie?

254
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:28,227
-Did you do his homework?
-Of course.

255
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:31,367
-Want to do mine?
-No.

256
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:38,431
This isn't what I think it is. Is it?

257
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:42,006
Where'd you get it?

258
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,244
From the school nurse.

259
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:51,817
-It's against the law.
-Oh, honey. It's a girl's best friend.

260
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:56,484
-A certain kind of girl.
-Meet the last virgin bride.

261
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,890
-Spencer is a gentleman.
-And even gentlemen have dicks.

262
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:09,128
-Maybe I'll get one.
-What? A dick?

263
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,537
Don't be stupid, Connie.

264
00:22:14,414 --> 00:22:17,405
Someone, somewhere,
someday might be interested.

265
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:22,711
Just in case.
Just in case, I'll be prepared.

266
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:28,183
Was that necessary?

267
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:30,626
I was taught it's best
to speak honestly.

268
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:33,664
Okay. You're a bitch.

269
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,369
We recently learned
that Amanda Armstrong...

270
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:48,503
...our nurse, has been distributing
contraception to Wellesley girls.

271
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:51,447
This revelation is disturbing
to an institution...

272
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,247
... that prides itself on propriety.

273
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:10,299
Go, go, go! Go, go!
It's been going on since the late '80s.

274
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:14,203
-Whoever wins is first to marry!
-Do the girls take it literally?

275
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:19,211
Only the girl with the winning hoop.
Oh, look, it's Phyllis Nayor!

276
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:26,278
Good for her. It gets me every time.

277
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:29,049
-Why the buggies?
-They've got their man.

278
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:31,715
They're wishing for their babies.

279
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:37,858
Have you seen this?

280
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,434
What is it?

281
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:45,834
It's a front-page attack on Amanda
Armstrong. Betty Warren wrote it.

282
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:55,484
"By providing contraception
on demand, our school nurse...

283
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:58,712
...is little more than a cheerleader
for promiscuity." Wow.

284
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,188
Oh, they're not going to dump her
in a lake!

285
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:06,590
-I'm coming, Phyllis!
-Have you seen this?

286
00:24:06,765 --> 00:24:09,961
I wouldn't worry. Betty's just
a young girl flexing her muscles.

287
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:12,932
So was Lizzie Borden,
and her mother wasn't president...

288
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:16,870
-...of the alumnae association.
-Would somebody get that girl a towel!

289
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:20,135
-That's her mother?
-Apple, tree.

290
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:22,473
Is Amanda going to get into trouble?

291
00:24:22,648 --> 00:24:25,514
Amanda needs to start
minding her p's and q's.

292
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:28,619
The trick to surviving Wellesley
is never getting noticed.

293
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,845
Ciao, Mona Lisa.

294
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:33,955
The big war hero.

295
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:36,593
He thinks he's something special.

296
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:40,526
He sleeps with his students.

297
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:45,200
The gold is fine.
The napkin rings are vulgar.

298
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:47,668
The glassware should be trimmed
with gold.

299
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,299
The little sugar boxes, gold and white,
filled with chocolate. No candlesticks.

300
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:55,344
-Freesia instead of daisies.
-Wise choice, madam.

301
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:58,115
No baby's breath.

302
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,722
-You already had your fitting?
-We're on our way.

303
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:10,454
Here's the seating chart
and Spencer's list of groomsmen.

304
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:12,689
Oh, I almost forgot.

305
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:17,401
I spoke to him about reading the
poem. He'd rather not. I said all right.

306
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,508
Excuse us for a second, Joan.

307
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:30,181
A good wife lets her husband
think that everything's his idea...

308
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:33,013
-...even when it's not.
-I don't care if he reads it.

309
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,248
You will in retrospect.

310
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,963
Now, why don't you see if you
can't nudge the idea into his head.

311
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:51,103
I've been here now
for 21 years, Jocelyn.

312
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:54,401
-I remember you as a student.
-Twenty-four, if you count that.

313
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:56,602
So why the theatrics?

314
00:25:57,047 --> 00:26:01,210
We cannot appear
to promote sexual promiscuity.

315
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:04,750
Okay. It's about appearances, then?
No.

316
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:07,184
All right, all right.

317
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:12,225
All right. Well, I promise not to appear
to be sympathetic, progressive...

318
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:16,024
...or what did Mrs. Warren
call it? "Liberal."

319
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:18,465
Scout's honor.

320
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:23,339
I spent the better part of Friday
afternoon convincing the alumnae...

321
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,406
...that your record was impeccable...

322
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:29,807
...that you would no longer
provide contraceptive devices...

323
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:32,643
...and you'd make
a public statement to that effect.

324
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:34,944
I'm not willing to make
a public statement.

325
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,451
It doesn't matter, Amanda.

326
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:41,983
They're letting you go.

327
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:47,459
It's out of my hands.

328
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,067
And this champagne cup
is in the wrong place.

329
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:56,901
And up and down. And up and--

330
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,599
Katherine. Good evening,
Miss Watson.

331
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:02,109
-Good evening, Miss Watson.
-Join us.

332
00:27:06,052 --> 00:27:07,382
No.

333
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:10,077
-Good night, Miss Watson.
-Good night, Miss Watson.

334
00:27:10,256 --> 00:27:12,485
And down. Very nice. Very nice.

335
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:29,941
Hey.

336
00:27:31,745 --> 00:27:35,145
Heard about Amanda. I'm sorry.

337
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:38,375
She seemed all right about it.
I wouldn't be.

338
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:40,985
They don't give you
too many chances around here.

339
00:27:41,156 --> 00:27:44,056
Oh, that depends how much
they hate you to begin with.

340
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:48,517
Can I buy you a drink?
Or are you here for dinner?

341
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:51,096
How long do
the marriage lectures take?

342
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:53,426
Get this woman a booth.

343
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:11,347
Your husband is at a crossroads
in his career.

344
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:18,557
He's competing for promotion
against two rivals, Smith and Jones.

345
00:28:19,596 --> 00:28:24,225
To get the edge, you have wisely
decided to invite the boss...

346
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:27,426
...and his wife to a 7:00 dinner.

347
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:30,333
You've carefully planned
your meal...

348
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:33,805
...set your table
and arranged for a babysitter.

349
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:36,945
-Oh, we have babies!
-Yes, and I have twins!

350
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,746
Then, surprise. It's 6:1 5...

351
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,446
...and your husband's called to say
that Smith, Jones and their wives...

352
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,251
...have been invited
at the boss's request.

353
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,523
Ever the Wellesley girl...

354
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:58,225
...you keep your cool
and understand...

355
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:02,863
...that the boss is probably testing you
as much as your husband. What next?

356
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,100
-Yes?
-File for divorce?

357
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,947
That's very funny.

358
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,016
But the thing is, it's not a joke.

359
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:17,246
A few years from now
your sole responsibility...

360
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:20,950
...will be taking care
of your husband and children.

361
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,863
You may all be here...

362
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:29,090
...for an easy A...

363
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:34,330
...but the grade that matters the most
is the one he gives you, not me.

364
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:38,167
-You'll need to--
-Whatever you do...

365
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:40,777
...don't put the boss's wife
next to your husband.

366
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:44,677
-Why not?
-She's screwing him.

367
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:49,420
Is that where you learned
to speak ltalian? In ltaly?

368
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,056
Yeah.

369
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:56,956
-Have you got a boyfriend?
-Yes.

370
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:01,699
You know, if you were mine,
I'd never let you go.

371
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:04,234
I wouldn't have asked
your permission.

372
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,467
Yeah, they say you're progressive.

373
00:30:08,977 --> 00:30:10,773
A forward thinker.

374
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,409
-Are you?
-There are a lot of labels here...

375
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,316
...I've noticed.

376
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:22,320
Right family, right school, right art,
right way of thinking.

377
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,315
Well, saves the effort
on thinking for yourself.

378
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:29,931
How do you expect to ever make
a difference if everything is a joke?

379
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,029
Oh, Katherine Watson comes to
Wellesley to set us all free? Come on.

380
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:41,537
-Thank you for the drink.
-No, no. Wait. I was teasing.

381
00:30:42,344 --> 00:30:44,777
They have their own way
of doing things here.

382
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:49,414
You've just gotta find a way
to work with them. We all had to.

383
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:02,827
I'm sorry.

384
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:08,064
Five years ago,
they'd have slapped my wrist.

385
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:12,367
But now there's a committee
for the protection of everything.

386
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:16,042
They think you're dangerous?

387
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:20,411
Oh, no, darling. No. Subversive.

388
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:23,953
It's gotten to the point...

389
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:27,523
...where you don't know
who is protecting whom from what.

390
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:34,654
Or should that be "from whom"?
Well, whom gives a damn anyway?

391
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,895
They're doing me a favor really.

392
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:41,900
Will you be all right?

393
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,411
Better than that.

394
00:31:51,584 --> 00:31:56,247
I should really have left
when Josephine died.

395
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,624
Nothing left to love
here anymore. So....

396
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:19,044
Hello?

397
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:23,181
-Miss Watson?
-Yes. I'm back here.

398
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:29,312
I've never been to this part
of campus before. Where are we?

399
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:34,388
No man's land. So to speak.

400
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,927
Come on in.

401
00:32:39,735 --> 00:32:41,361
What's all this?

402
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,230
Different things different days.

403
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:50,776
People who inspire me,
artists I admire, editorials I don't.

404
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,377
So you came to see me.

405
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:58,242
-You gave me a C.
-I'm kind.

406
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:01,418
The assignment was to write
about Bruegel. I did that.

407
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,416
-No, what you did was copy Strauss.
-I was referencing an expert.

408
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:09,589
If I wanted to know what he thought,
I'd buy his book.

409
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:15,764
Miss Watson, with all due respect....

410
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:19,836
Bruegel was a storyteller.
Find the stories.

411
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:24,069
Break them down into smaller pieces.
You might actually enjoy it.

412
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:29,040
-You're giving me another chance?
-So it seems.

413
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:34,180
Is that my file? What's it say?

414
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,022
Well, let's see.

415
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,723
-Straight A's.
-Until now.

416
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:47,663
President of the poetry society,
captain of the debate team...

417
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:51,534
...co-captain of the tennis club,
founder of the horticulture league.

418
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,146
-I sound like a pompous ass.
-Yes, you do, but a very busy one.

419
00:33:56,314 --> 00:34:01,148
And it says here that you're pre-law.
What law school are you gonna go to?

420
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:05,084
I hadn't thought about that.
After I graduate, I'm getting married.

421
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:09,055
-And then?
-And then I'll be married.

422
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:11,158
You can do both.

423
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:16,265
Just for fun, if you could go
to any law school, which would it be?

424
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:18,627
Yale.

425
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:20,531
Yale.

426
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:25,608
They keep five slots open for women,
one unofficially for a Wellesley girl.

427
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:28,611
But you haven't really
thought about it.

428
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,602
Wake up, Joanie, wake up.
Wake up.

429
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:52,869
Okay, don't get up.

430
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,940
Don't hear what I have to say
about Tommy and Spencer...

431
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,374
...Iooking at an engagement ring...

432
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:00,979
...for you.

433
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:04,207
You're sure?

434
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:06,615
That's everything
we always wanted, huh?

435
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:10,246
We'll be best friends, and our
husbands will be best friends...

436
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:13,791
...and we'll have houses together
and we'll have babies together...

437
00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:16,054
...and they'll be best friends.

438
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:19,256
You're going to be
Mrs. Tommy Donegal.

439
00:35:19,635 --> 00:35:20,726
When?

440
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:25,203
I'll get the scoop tomorrow.
You go back to sleep.

441
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:30,167
The first part of the exam
will consist of two pairs of slides.

442
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:34,440
Please identify each of the slides
by name, period and date.

443
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:36,583
Then compare and contrast them.

444
00:35:36,752 --> 00:35:39,117
You will have 1 0 minutes
for each pair.

445
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:41,654
Then you will write
a 1 500-word essay...

446
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:46,158
...describing the stylistic differences
between Raphael and van Eyck.

447
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:48,992
Eyes forward, Miss Delacorte.

448
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,892
You have 40 minutes.

449
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,557
Good luck.

450
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:12,786
-Excuse me.
-Governor. Another shot, please.

451
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:17,857
This way, please. Thank you.

452
00:36:37,316 --> 00:36:38,680
Excuse me.

453
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,689
This is quite the event.

454
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:51,794
-I'm surprised I was invited.
-Well, look around you.

455
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:53,589
Who wasn't?

456
00:36:58,271 --> 00:37:01,262
You ever hear the expression
"Keeping up with the Joneses"?

457
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,667
Of course.

458
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:04,604
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Jones.

459
00:37:04,777 --> 00:37:09,008
The actual, historical family
they invented the phrase about.

460
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:13,078
Good to know.

461
00:37:35,945 --> 00:37:37,241
That's him!

462
00:38:20,857 --> 00:38:23,950
-Thank you.
-Good to see you.

463
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:27,858
-Thank you very much.
-A beautiful dress.

464
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:30,397
Hi, we're so glad you came.

465
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:33,229
-We're together. Table 1 9.
-Good.

466
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:36,973
Holy God!

467
00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:40,837
The governor is right behind you.
Don't turn around.

468
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:45,710
Great band.

469
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,176
-Violet.
-Yes?

470
00:38:50,355 --> 00:38:52,515
-Would you mind if I go here?
-Not at all.

471
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:54,385
Over here. Thank you.

472
00:38:57,095 --> 00:39:00,427
-Great band.
-Great band.

473
00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:03,233
-Hi, Katherine.
-Hi, Professor Dunbar.

474
00:39:06,572 --> 00:39:08,505
I'm getting a Manhattan.
Like anything?

475
00:39:08,673 --> 00:39:10,401
No, thank you.

476
00:39:10,575 --> 00:39:12,838
I'll take a Jack and ginger.

477
00:39:15,914 --> 00:39:18,074
He's making his move.

478
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:22,920
I knew he'd go for her.

479
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:25,488
She's too old for him.

480
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:27,887
She's too smart for him.

481
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:29,322
Hold that.

482
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,099
-They're playing our song.
-What?

483
00:39:43,277 --> 00:39:46,541
-They're playing our song.
-I heard you.

484
00:39:46,713 --> 00:39:49,738
-Hi.
-Hi, Giselle.

485
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:54,250
-Ladies' choice?
-Sure.

486
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:57,147
Excuse me.

487
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:09,027
Ladies, gentlemen! Quiet!

488
00:40:09,804 --> 00:40:12,294
What's this about the poem
you wanted me to read?

489
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:15,466
-lt was your idea, remember?
-I never said that.

490
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:17,168
Ready?

491
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:19,970
Excellent.

492
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:25,253
Well, I wrote this down, just in case
you forgot. It's my favorite.

493
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,545
Smile.

494
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:38,327
Now, Betty, I tried to think of
a million ways to tell you how I feel.

495
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,594
But instead...

496
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:44,066
...I refer to your favorite poem.

497
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,614
-Good catch.
-You said it.

498
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,016
He's a morsel. Miss Watson!

499
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,887
-He's a favor. Remember?
-Come on.

500
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,052
Miss Watson,
I want you to meet Tommy.

501
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,357
Tommy, come here for a second.

502
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,496
You are so beautiful.

503
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:17,837
-This is Katherine Watson.
-Oh, wow! In the flesh.

504
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,706
-She has not shut up about you.
-Oh, stop.

505
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,473
-You know what I'm saying?
-I do.

506
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,380
-You did something to impress her.
-Well, it seems you did too.

507
00:41:31,191 --> 00:41:35,650
-You make these especially well.
-Thank you.

508
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:39,227
I had a fella. Lenny.

509
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:44,860
You remind me of him so much.

510
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,133
He had this...

511
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:51,767
...funny little thing
where his two front teeth...

512
00:41:51,945 --> 00:41:54,003
...they overlapped.

513
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:58,442
He's dead.

514
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:02,878
South Pacific.

515
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,037
My parents say my future
is right on the horizon.

516
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:28,579
Tell them the horizon
is an imaginary line...

517
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,808
...that recedes as you approach it.

518
00:42:33,622 --> 00:42:36,181
I think I'll go back to my seat.

519
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:39,383
I had a really nice time. Thank you.

520
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:42,192
Connie.

521
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:45,997
-ls this the brushoff?
-No.

522
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:48,533
I thought you were, you know...

523
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,670
...done with me.

524
00:42:52,107 --> 00:42:56,543
-Why would you think that?
-Betty said that you--

525
00:42:56,711 --> 00:43:02,114
I don't wanna take advantage.
I know that this was some favor.

526
00:43:02,285 --> 00:43:05,549
She did me the favor, not you.

527
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:08,649
Come on, dance with me.

528
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:41,021
She's too good for you.

529
00:43:42,628 --> 00:43:44,356
Maybe you're right.

530
00:43:45,931 --> 00:43:48,797
I'm too good for you too.

531
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:54,797
-But I have lower expectations.
-I thought we settled this last spring.

532
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:59,542
So then we probably shouldn't have
slept together over the summer.

533
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:01,368
Stop.

534
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,373
You ready?

535
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:09,719
Do you wanna know something funny?

536
00:44:09,888 --> 00:44:12,447
Lenny's not dead.

537
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:15,586
Not technically.

538
00:44:15,762 --> 00:44:17,058
He....

539
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,719
He's got married.

540
00:44:18,898 --> 00:44:22,128
He's got a wife and kids...

541
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,225
...and a mortgage.

542
00:44:24,404 --> 00:44:28,134
It was all supposed to be mine,
except for the wife.

543
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:33,977
And you....
You don't look a thing like him.

544
00:44:34,148 --> 00:44:35,944
-You ugly bartender.
-Stop it.

545
00:44:36,117 --> 00:44:39,916
-You couldn't shine his shoes.
-I'm sorry.

546
00:44:40,087 --> 00:44:42,782
It wasn't supposed
to turn out like this.

547
00:44:42,957 --> 00:44:46,255
It wasn't supposed
to turn out like this.

548
00:44:47,294 --> 00:44:50,285
-Which way?
-Let me just see here.

549
00:44:50,464 --> 00:44:52,397
I'm not sure.

550
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:56,232
-Where are we supposed to go?
-I think it's here.

551
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:58,634
Come this way. We're almost there.

552
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:13,985
Joe.

553
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,989
-Hello.
-Hi. How are you?

554
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:19,558
Great. Thank you so much for this.
You're a pal.

555
00:45:19,728 --> 00:45:21,786
It's a pleasure.
Your timing is perfect.

556
00:45:24,132 --> 00:45:25,996
There it is.

557
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:02,099
-That's Jackson Pollock.
-ln a word.

558
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:06,708
I was getting used to the idea of dead,
maggoty meat being art, now this.

559
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:10,704
Please don't tell me
we have to write a paper about it.

560
00:46:10,883 --> 00:46:12,315
Do me a favor.

561
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:15,885
Do yourselves a favor.
Stop talking and look.

562
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:21,516
You're not required to write a paper.
You're not even required to like it.

563
00:46:21,694 --> 00:46:23,957
You are required...

564
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,824
...to consider it.

565
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:30,697
That's your only assignment today.
When you're done, you may leave.

566
00:46:33,105 --> 00:46:35,800
Thank God Betty isn't here.

567
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,725
Where did you come from?

568
00:47:33,902 --> 00:47:35,493
Mars.

569
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,932
What a coincidence.

570
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:45,903
Tom Donegal came by to see Joan.
So I hopped a ride.

571
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:47,941
Why?

572
00:47:50,485 --> 00:47:52,577
So I could do this:

573
00:48:08,671 --> 00:48:10,900
-Katherine.
-Yes?

574
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:13,508
-Have you got a minute?
-Of course.

575
00:48:13,676 --> 00:48:15,233
Walk with me.

576
00:48:16,013 --> 00:48:18,412
-You going home for the holidays?
-No.

577
00:48:18,582 --> 00:48:20,344
-Too far?
-Too expensive.

578
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:23,041
But I've never had
a New England Christmas, so....

579
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,950
-Our weather hasn't scared you away?
-I love it here.

580
00:48:27,124 --> 00:48:28,454
Do you?

581
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:32,784
I've been getting some calls about
your teaching methods, Katherine.

582
00:48:32,964 --> 00:48:36,455
They're a little unorthodox...

583
00:48:36,635 --> 00:48:38,727
...for Wellesley.

584
00:48:38,903 --> 00:48:42,235
-We are traditionalists, Katherine.
-Yes, I noticed.

585
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:44,931
So if you'd like to stay here....

586
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:48,272
-ls that a question?
-More a discussion.

587
00:48:48,446 --> 00:48:52,814
-About my staying here?
-You'll have your formal review in May.

588
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:55,486
Until then...

589
00:48:56,021 --> 00:48:59,285
...a little less modern art.

590
00:48:59,457 --> 00:49:01,356
Happy holidays.

591
00:49:01,526 --> 00:49:03,152
And to you.

592
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,699
-Afternoon.
-Oh, hi--

593
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,977
I hope you get that ring!

594
00:49:19,312 --> 00:49:22,940
Bye, girls, see you next year.
Have a safe trip.

595
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:34,152
So, what's the big hush-hush secret?

596
00:49:34,328 --> 00:49:37,694
Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter
of little Spencers?

597
00:49:37,865 --> 00:49:40,094
Stop. They'll tell us
when they're ready.

598
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,894
Are you ready?

599
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:45,766
Is she the cutest? You are the cutest.
Come here, you.

600
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:53,647
Spencer's been made junior partner.

601
00:49:54,516 --> 00:49:58,611
-lt is about time.
-And it's a significant raise too!

602
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,755
-Betty!
-What? I can say that, can't l?

603
00:50:01,924 --> 00:50:03,823
To Tommy and Joan?

604
00:50:03,992 --> 00:50:09,429
Well, it is.
So maybe a family isn't far behind.

605
00:50:10,532 --> 00:50:13,193
Let's take our coffee
in the sitting room, shall we?

606
00:50:13,368 --> 00:50:14,356
I'll help.

607
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:21,135
-Keep them closed.
-All right.

608
00:50:26,049 --> 00:50:29,381
Beautiful! You've got everything
you've ever dreamed of.

609
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:31,314
You will too.

610
00:50:32,388 --> 00:50:36,721
I've got a secret to tell you.
You swear you won't gab to anyone?

611
00:50:37,293 --> 00:50:40,420
I got accepted early
to Yale Law School.

612
00:50:40,597 --> 00:50:44,999
To what?! Why?!
You don't want to be a lawyer.

613
00:50:45,169 --> 00:50:46,931
Maybe I do.

614
00:50:47,238 --> 00:50:51,469
You won't switch cold creams without
asking me, but you applied to school?

615
00:50:51,642 --> 00:50:54,405
On a lark.
We never thought I'd get in.

616
00:50:54,578 --> 00:50:56,568
-Who's "we"?
-Miss Watson.

617
00:50:56,747 --> 00:50:59,909
She practically filled out
my application for me.

618
00:51:00,485 --> 00:51:03,419
You've got to be kidding me!
What right does she have?

619
00:51:03,588 --> 00:51:05,179
You're getting married!

620
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:08,223
First of all,
there's no ring on this finger.

621
00:51:08,393 --> 00:51:11,884
Second, I can do both. I can.

622
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:15,796
-How does Tommy feel about this?
-He doesn't know. No one does.

623
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:18,992
-Not even her?
-No one.

624
00:51:19,172 --> 00:51:20,695
Joanie! Betty!

625
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:23,841
You are this close to getting
everything you ever wanted.

626
00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:26,101
And this close to losing it.

627
00:51:37,924 --> 00:51:40,585
I just got a call.
They need me in New York tomorrow.

628
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,557
Joan and Tommy are here.
Can't you leave in the morning?

629
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:47,630
Then I'd miss the meeting.
Sorry, guys. We take a rain check?

630
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,063
-Sure, buddy.
-We'll see you in the new year.

631
00:51:50,236 --> 00:51:52,135
Happy and merry.

632
00:51:55,609 --> 00:51:57,599
I'll call you in the morning.

633
00:52:10,725 --> 00:52:12,282
Coffee?

634
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:20,833
Guess who has
an early Christmas present?

635
00:52:21,003 --> 00:52:24,631
-Oh, my! How can you live like this?
-Like what?

636
00:52:24,807 --> 00:52:27,172
We'll just wait for you
to tidy up a bit.

637
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:31,176
In this lifetime? It'll never happen.
Come here, beautiful.

638
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,716
What are you doing here?

639
00:52:38,087 --> 00:52:42,682
-You still like it here?
-I do. I like getting to know the girls.

640
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:44,916
Most of the time.

641
00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:47,618
-And the weather.
-Yeah, the weather's nice.

642
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:49,285
-Are you freezing?
-Yeah.

643
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:52,160
-Your lips are a little blue.
-I like them that way.

644
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,767
Why didn't you bring a coat?

645
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:20,394
Bill.

646
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:24,328
Giselle, what are you doing here?

647
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,196
Freezing.

648
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:34,738
Look, it's over.
I can't see you anymore.

649
00:53:34,913 --> 00:53:37,210
-I can't.
-I know.

650
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:40,183
Really.

651
00:53:42,888 --> 00:53:45,321
I just want to talk to you
for a minute.

652
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:49,285
Come on.

653
00:53:58,203 --> 00:53:59,897
Oh, I missed you.

654
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,032
You're beautiful.

655
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,774
Life without you...

656
00:54:05,945 --> 00:54:07,844
...just isn't life.

657
00:54:09,582 --> 00:54:12,880
And I don't want to go through life
not living. Do you?

658
00:54:13,353 --> 00:54:14,751
No.

659
00:54:14,988 --> 00:54:20,118
I love you so much I would move
to this elitist icebox if you want me to.

660
00:54:25,966 --> 00:54:28,331
Make an honest man out of me.

661
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:31,801
Miss Watson?

662
00:54:32,172 --> 00:54:34,935
Hi. I didn't know you were here.

663
00:54:39,546 --> 00:54:43,504
Giselle Levy, Bill Dunbar,
this is....

664
00:54:43,685 --> 00:54:45,914
-This is my.... Paul.
-Fiance.

665
00:54:46,354 --> 00:54:49,345
As of about a minute and a half ago.
Paul Moore.

666
00:54:51,726 --> 00:54:55,855
God. Congratulations!
Your fiance?

667
00:54:57,732 --> 00:54:59,528
You must be thrilled.

668
00:54:59,702 --> 00:55:02,169
I don't think she's caught
her breath yet.

669
00:55:02,337 --> 00:55:03,462
I haven't.

670
00:55:06,341 --> 00:55:10,868
-Well, sit down. We'll have a toast.
-We'd love to. We're in a hurry.

671
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:14,174
But that's really great.
Congratulations, old man.

672
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:17,614
-Congratulations. Merry Christmas.
-Come on, let's....

673
00:55:17,787 --> 00:55:21,313
Best of tidings to you both. Bye.

674
00:55:49,821 --> 00:55:51,344
No, Paul.

675
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:54,285
Nancy'll have a heart attack.
She has these rules.

676
00:55:54,459 --> 00:55:56,892
-Come on.
-No.

677
00:55:57,596 --> 00:56:01,292
-Why?
-I said no. I'm not comfortable.

678
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,263
I'll make up the convertible sofa.

679
00:56:12,478 --> 00:56:14,411
What are you doing?

680
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:18,872
You're not kidding?

681
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:24,511
I just came 3,000 miles to see you.
I'm sleeping down here by myself?

682
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,884
Stop. Stop. Stop for a second.

683
00:56:31,063 --> 00:56:34,759
-Tell me what the hell's going on.
-I don't know.

684
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:37,333
I feel like everything
is getting away from me.

685
00:56:37,504 --> 00:56:42,600
We haven't actually, literally looked
at each other for three months...

686
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:46,005
...and now you're here,
and I have this ring on my finger.

687
00:56:46,479 --> 00:56:49,072
Which makes you uncomfortable too?

688
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:54,543
The last time I checked,
we weren't on this track.

689
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:56,913
When was the last time
you checked?

690
00:57:17,946 --> 00:57:19,242
Bill....

691
00:57:20,782 --> 00:57:22,749
The name is Paul.

692
00:57:29,191 --> 00:57:32,455
I'm not saying no to you.

693
00:57:32,661 --> 00:57:34,992
No, you're not saying anything.

694
00:57:36,565 --> 00:57:38,589
You never really do.

695
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:03,116
If you need me for anything else,
my number's on the refrigerator.

696
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:05,953
I feel so guilty
leaving you alone after--

697
00:58:06,129 --> 00:58:08,653
I'm fine. I have lots of research
to do.

698
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:12,427
That's right.
Throw yourself into work.

699
00:58:12,737 --> 00:58:13,896
I'll be back...

700
00:58:14,772 --> 00:58:16,602
...on the 2nd.

701
00:58:17,575 --> 00:58:19,439
See you next year.

702
00:58:19,611 --> 00:58:21,407
1 954!

703
00:58:56,715 --> 00:58:59,683
Sunflowers. Vincent van Gogh. 1 888.

704
00:58:59,853 --> 00:59:03,310
He painted what he felt,
not what he saw.

705
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:06,890
People didn't understand. To them,
it seemed childlike and crude.

706
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,290
It took years for them to recognize
his actual technique...

707
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:14,330
...to see the way his brush strokes
seemed to make the night sky move.

708
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:18,231
Yet, he never sold a painting
in his lifetime.

709
00:59:18,406 --> 00:59:20,396
This is his self-portrait.

710
00:59:20,574 --> 00:59:24,839
There's no camouflage, no romance.
Honesty.

711
00:59:25,012 --> 00:59:30,381
-Now, 60 years later, where is he?
-Famous?

712
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:34,452
So famous, in fact,
that everybody has a reproduction.

713
00:59:34,622 --> 00:59:37,647
-There are post cards--
-We have the calendar.

714
00:59:37,826 --> 00:59:42,319
With the ability to reproduce art,
it is available to the masses.

715
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:44,794
No one needs to own
a van Gogh original.

716
00:59:44,966 --> 00:59:47,900
We do. In the Newport house.

717
00:59:48,704 --> 00:59:51,763
But it's small. Tiny.

718
00:59:55,277 --> 00:59:58,541
They can paint their own.
Van Gogh in a box, ladies.

719
00:59:58,714 --> 01:00:01,773
The newest form
of mass-distributed art:

720
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,541
Paint by numbers.

721
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:06,744
"Now everyone can be van Gogh.
It's so easy.

722
01:00:06,922 --> 01:00:09,185
Just follow the simple instructions...

723
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:12,326
...and in minutes, you're on
your way to being an artist."

724
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,330
Van Gogh by numbers?

725
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:19,126
Ironic, isn't it? Look at what
we have done to the man...

726
01:00:19,302 --> 01:00:22,930
...who refused to conform
his ideals to popular taste.

727
01:00:23,106 --> 01:00:26,165
Who refused to compromise
his integrity.

728
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:31,904
We have put him in a tiny box
and asked you to copy him.

729
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:34,210
So the choice is yours, ladies.

730
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:38,821
You can conform to what
other people expect or you can--

731
01:00:38,989 --> 01:00:41,957
I know. Be ourselves.

732
01:00:42,926 --> 01:00:44,825
You're a sight for sore eyes.

733
01:00:44,995 --> 01:00:49,294
I would've been on time but, silly me,
I thought class was in the classroom.

734
01:00:49,466 --> 01:00:53,265
Glad you could join us, Mrs. Jones.
We thought we'd lost you.

735
01:00:53,505 --> 01:00:56,098
-There's an unwritten rule for marr--
-Don't bother.

736
01:00:56,274 --> 01:01:00,266
Since your wedding, you've missed
six classes, a paper and your midterm.

737
01:01:00,445 --> 01:01:03,902
Well, thank God I didn't miss
the paint-by-numbers lecture.

738
01:01:04,215 --> 01:01:07,741
I was on my honeymoon
and then I had to set up house.

739
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,080
-What does she expect?
-Attendance.

740
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,390
Most of the faculty turn their heads...

741
01:01:14,568 --> 01:01:17,468
...when the married students
miss a class or two.

742
01:01:17,638 --> 01:01:19,628
Then why not get married
as freshmen?

743
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:24,903
That way you could graduate without
actually ever stepping foot on campus.

744
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:30,479
Don't disregard our traditions
just because you're subversive.

745
01:01:31,952 --> 01:01:34,749
Don't disrespect this class
just because you're married.

746
01:01:34,923 --> 01:01:37,356
Don't disrespect me
just because you're not.

747
01:01:37,524 --> 01:01:40,720
Come to class, do the work,
or I'll fail you.

748
01:01:40,895 --> 01:01:43,988
If you fail me,
there will be consequences.

749
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:48,996
-Are you threatening me?
-I'm educating you.

750
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:51,301
That's my job.

751
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,075
Miss Watson!

752
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,548
Miss Watson!

753
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,415
What's this?

754
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:45,616
Every year, the ARs nominate a
member of the faculty to be our guest.

755
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,159
The what?

756
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:50,891
You'll see. Come by tonight at 5:00.

757
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:57,433
Adam's Ribs. A very secret society.

758
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,971
Wait here.

759
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,915
First, the oath.
Please raise both hands.

760
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:15,751
Do you swear not to repeat what
you see, hear or smell tonight?

761
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:17,415
-Smell?
-Keep your hands up!

762
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:19,686
Yes, smell.

763
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:21,396
I do.

764
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:41,748
It'll only burn for a second.

765
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:43,476
Go on.

766
01:03:53,731 --> 01:03:59,465
And now that you've taken the oath,
we get to ask you whatever we want.

767
01:03:59,637 --> 01:04:03,834
-Oh, is that how it works?
-And you have to answer.

768
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,535
Who invited her?

769
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,905
You're in time
for truth or consequences.

770
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,412
I go first. Why aren't you married?

771
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:15,142
Well....

772
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,616
That's poisonous.

773
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:22,521
I'm not married because...

774
01:04:22,962 --> 01:04:24,519
...I'm not.

775
01:04:25,431 --> 01:04:29,890
I was engaged to Patrick Watts.

776
01:04:30,202 --> 01:04:33,796
Everybody called him Leo,
and I never knew why.

777
01:04:33,973 --> 01:04:38,932
He was the first person
that I ever danced with...

778
01:04:39,112 --> 01:04:44,014
...or smoked with,
got incredibly drunk with and--

779
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:47,550
Well, a lot of first things.

780
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:53,185
We were 1 8 and getting married,
Christmas of '41.

781
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:57,896
Then Pearl Harbor happened
and everything changed.

782
01:04:58,064 --> 01:05:02,227
Everybody changed.
And by June, he was sent overseas.

783
01:05:02,435 --> 01:05:04,265
-Did he come back?
-Yes.

784
01:05:04,438 --> 01:05:07,065
-Was he changed?
-They both were.

785
01:05:10,511 --> 01:05:12,068
I'm sorry.

786
01:05:12,813 --> 01:05:15,474
-Your parents?
-Yeah.

787
01:05:17,418 --> 01:05:19,351
After the war...

788
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:24,490
...they didn't know each other
anymore, didn't like each other.

789
01:05:26,427 --> 01:05:29,418
He left. He got a whole new family.

790
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:32,756
Divorce.

791
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:33,990
What?

792
01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:38,160
Yeah. First on my block.
That's a city block.

793
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:44,840
People change. Things happen.
It's the same with me and Leo.

794
01:05:45,246 --> 01:05:47,907
He went off and married
someone else.

795
01:05:48,216 --> 01:05:51,707
-And I got to go to graduate school.
-UCLA, right?

796
01:05:51,887 --> 01:05:55,083
-Which is in Hollywood?
-It's close.

797
01:05:55,257 --> 01:06:00,455
Anyway, aren't you gonna tell
everybody about, you know...

798
01:06:01,162 --> 01:06:03,823
-...your big news?
-What are you talking about?

799
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:07,398
-She got engaged over Christmas!
-Congratulations!

800
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:10,629
I'm sorry to blab.
It's just so romantic.

801
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:12,567
How fantastic!

802
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:15,071
We split up.

803
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,778
-What?
-We split up.

804
01:06:22,618 --> 01:06:24,244
Well, that was fast.

805
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:27,752
Well, not every relationship
is meant for marriage.

806
01:06:27,924 --> 01:06:31,154
-Some are strictly affairs?
-Bill Dunbar.

807
01:06:31,327 --> 01:06:34,557
He'd be an affair. Let's talk
about that, Miss Watson.

808
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:36,754
You don't believe in withholding,
do you?

809
01:06:36,933 --> 01:06:41,631
No. I do, however, believe in manners.
But for you, I'll make an exception.

810
01:06:41,804 --> 01:06:45,705
That's what we're supposed to do
for married students. Right, Betty?

811
01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:50,473
Professor Dunbar and l
are not having an affair.

812
01:06:50,647 --> 01:06:52,477
Did you have one
with William Holden?

813
01:06:52,648 --> 01:06:54,672
-Connie!
-She asked about Bill Dunbar.

814
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:57,683
-How did you hear that?
-Oh, it is true!

815
01:06:57,853 --> 01:06:59,149
Betty, I told you.

816
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:05,889
-Won't you regret never marrying?
-There's still time.

817
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:08,189
I guess I assume that I will
at some point.

818
01:07:08,365 --> 01:07:11,424
-I'm not gonna plan my life around it.
-Neither should we.

819
01:07:11,602 --> 01:07:13,432
-I didn't say that.
-You did to Joan.

820
01:07:13,604 --> 01:07:16,128
-That's what she told me.
-What are you saying?

821
01:07:16,306 --> 01:07:18,535
She knew you and Tommy
were getting engaged.

822
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:21,142
And she practically filled out
your application.

823
01:07:21,312 --> 01:07:23,643
-I didn't say that.
-She's been accepted.

824
01:07:23,814 --> 01:07:27,112
Now she just has to figure out
a way to tell Tommy.

825
01:07:28,353 --> 01:07:31,719
Why don't you do it? You're good
at butting into people's business.

826
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:35,449
Funny, that's what they say
about you.

827
01:07:37,462 --> 01:07:41,522
-Spencer, do I look all right?
-Yeah, fine.

828
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:44,826
-I don't have a lot of time. Speed it up.
-Mr. Grouchy.

829
01:07:45,303 --> 01:07:48,897
-All right, here we go again.
-All right, go ahead, Louise.

830
01:07:49,874 --> 01:07:54,469
Married Wellesley girls have become
quite adept at balancing obligations.

831
01:07:54,746 --> 01:07:56,372
One hears such comments as:

832
01:07:56,547 --> 01:08:01,108
"I baste the chicken with one hand
and outline the paper with the other. "

833
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:04,481
While our mothers were called
to work for Lady Liberty...

834
01:08:04,657 --> 01:08:09,650
...it is our duty, nay, obligation
to reclaim our place in the home...

835
01:08:09,828 --> 01:08:14,389
...bearing the children that will carry
our traditions into the future.

836
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:18,433
One must pause to consider why
Miss Katherine Watson...

837
01:08:18,604 --> 01:08:20,901
...instructor in the Art History
department...

838
01:08:21,073 --> 01:08:25,008
...has decided to declare war
on the holy sacrament of marriage.

839
01:08:25,177 --> 01:08:28,805
Her subversive and political teachings
encourage our Wellesley girls...

840
01:08:28,982 --> 01:08:32,542
... to reject the roles
they were born to fill.

841
01:08:49,536 --> 01:08:51,366
Thank you.

842
01:09:11,525 --> 01:09:13,719
Slide.

843
01:09:15,963 --> 01:09:18,430
-Contemporary art.
-That's just an advertisement.

844
01:09:18,599 --> 01:09:20,225
Quiet!

845
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:24,730
T oday you just listen.

846
01:09:26,607 --> 01:09:30,474
What will the future scholars see
when they study us?

847
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:35,975
A portrait of women today?

848
01:09:38,786 --> 01:09:40,252
There you are, ladies.

849
01:09:41,222 --> 01:09:43,746
The perfect likeness
of a Wellesley graduate.

850
01:09:43,925 --> 01:09:49,591
Magna cum laude, doing exactly
what she was trained to do.

851
01:09:49,765 --> 01:09:51,026
Slide.

852
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:53,995
A Rhodes scholar.

853
01:09:56,338 --> 01:10:00,205
I wonder if she recites Chaucer while
she presses her husband's shirts.

854
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:01,636
Slide.

855
01:10:03,545 --> 01:10:07,571
Now, you physics majors can calculate
the mass and volume...

856
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:10,512
...of every meat loaf you make.
Slide.

857
01:10:11,553 --> 01:10:13,986
A girdle to set you free.

858
01:10:14,157 --> 01:10:16,317
What does that mean?

859
01:10:21,463 --> 01:10:23,657
What does that mean?

860
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:27,060
What does it mean?

861
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,532
I give up.

862
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:37,568
You win.

863
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:42,546
The smartest women in the country.

864
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:50,387
I didn't realize that
by demanding excellence...

865
01:10:50,861 --> 01:10:53,761
...I would be challenging....

866
01:10:56,033 --> 01:10:58,159
What did it say?

867
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:01,860
What did it say?

868
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,775
"The roles you were born to fill."

869
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:10,612
Is that right?

870
01:11:14,284 --> 01:11:16,911
The roles you were born to fill?

871
01:11:24,228 --> 01:11:26,661
It's my mistake.

872
01:11:39,644 --> 01:11:41,975
Class dismissed.

873
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:58,718
These girls....
Are you proud, President Carr?

874
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:02,924
-Yes, actually, I am.
-Well, you should be, I guess.

875
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:06,536
Half of them are married.
The other half, give it a month or so.

876
01:12:06,704 --> 01:12:08,830
It's really only a matter of time.

877
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:11,271
They're biding time
until somebody proposes!

878
01:12:11,443 --> 01:12:14,309
A hundred years ago, it was
inconceivable for a woman...

879
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,969
...to be a college graduate.

880
01:12:16,148 --> 01:12:18,980
Perhaps you should look back
to see how far we've come.

881
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:22,516
I'm sorry, from where I sit,
it's just a different kind of corset.

882
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:26,748
-Well, we can all use a little support.
-Oh, like Amanda Armstrong?

883
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,257
-She broke the law!
-According to Betty Warren.

884
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,861
According to the state
of Massachusetts.

885
01:12:35,835 --> 01:12:38,029
To hell with Wellesley.
I'm done.

886
01:12:39,672 --> 01:12:42,071
Goddamn it!

887
01:12:44,343 --> 01:12:46,810
It's brilliant, really.
A perfect ruse.

888
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:49,846
A finishing school disguised
as a college. They got me.

889
01:12:50,015 --> 01:12:51,948
-What do you expect?
-More. More.

890
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,780
I thought it was a place for
tomorrow's leaders, not their wives.

891
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,785
-Calm down, please.
-No, I will not!

892
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:01,222
I've got 1 0 more minutes.
Meet me in my office. Meet me!

893
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:31,822
-How you feeling?
-Stupid. Deceived.

894
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:35,027
Really, really angry.

895
01:13:36,464 --> 01:13:41,959
Change takes time, you know?
You gotta let them catch up with you.

896
01:13:42,937 --> 01:13:45,564
Katherine, this place needs you.

897
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:50,667
I don't know how the hell they let
you in, but I'm sure glad they did.

898
01:13:53,748 --> 01:13:58,582
The things I said to President Carr.
She'll never let me back in.

899
01:13:58,753 --> 01:14:00,515
She's a pretty good egg.

900
01:14:01,823 --> 01:14:04,017
What things?

901
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:06,249
Don't worry.

902
01:14:06,695 --> 01:14:08,525
Time will heal it.

903
01:14:08,697 --> 01:14:12,689
Unless, of course, you want to go back
to California and that fiance of yours.

904
01:14:14,136 --> 01:14:17,229
We're not engaged. Thanks.

905
01:14:17,406 --> 01:14:20,602
Sorry I interrupted your class.

906
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,446
Katherine!

907
01:14:36,726 --> 01:14:41,185
I wanted to give you this.
It was for Christmas, and....

908
01:14:41,431 --> 01:14:44,297
Then I met your man, so l....

909
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:03,140
The Sistine Chapel.

910
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:05,617
David.

911
01:15:06,189 --> 01:15:09,282
Venus de Milo. And...

912
01:15:10,094 --> 01:15:11,788
...Mona Lisa.

913
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:16,521
Thank you.

914
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:27,671
This is gonna be
a three-in-one shot. Ready?

915
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:32,637
You didn't even try.

916
01:15:34,219 --> 01:15:37,517
This game is probably a no-no
in the Better Homes and Gardens.

917
01:15:37,688 --> 01:15:41,851
Not that I have ever been in the
better homes and gardens. Have you?

918
01:15:42,025 --> 01:15:44,185
No. No, I'm just an old soldier.

919
01:15:44,362 --> 01:15:48,127
They don't invite us.

920
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:50,390
What do they say about them though?

921
01:15:50,568 --> 01:15:53,297
-Old soldiers never die. We just--
-They just...

922
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:56,928
...become philandering
ltalian professors.

923
01:15:57,108 --> 01:15:59,234
-That was below the belt.
-That was unkind.

924
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:00,842
Deeply unkind.

925
01:16:15,493 --> 01:16:18,950
You know, I don't know how I feel
about being a rebound.

926
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:23,327
-I'll leave.
-No, you don't have to do that.

927
01:16:23,502 --> 01:16:25,765
I'll get used to it.

928
01:16:26,004 --> 01:16:29,268
-What are you doing?
-Getting dressed.

929
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:33,399
I had fun, and I'm not looking
for anything serious.

930
01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:36,274
Why don't you come down here
and we can discuss it.

931
01:16:36,448 --> 01:16:40,713
But as long as we're doing
whatever it is that we're doing--

932
01:16:40,886 --> 01:16:43,718
Which we did pretty well,
don't you think?

933
01:16:46,992 --> 01:16:48,583
No students.

934
01:16:50,396 --> 01:16:52,795
I'm serious.

935
01:16:53,366 --> 01:16:58,564
I don't want to teach a class wondering
why a girl is wearing my perfume.

936
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:03,500
-Katherine, l--
-I need your word.

937
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,646
All right, you have my word.

938
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,715
-Okay.
-Now can we change the subject?

939
01:17:13,888 --> 01:17:17,584
Talk about something
a little more interesting?

940
01:17:17,757 --> 01:17:20,884
Like breakfast.

941
01:17:21,328 --> 01:17:23,659
You know, I make
a mean blueberry pancake.

942
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:25,763
I just put that shoe on.

943
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,560
I don't think I know you
well enough for breakfast.

944
01:17:28,735 --> 01:17:30,429
I don't know about that.

945
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:36,198
So how does a guy
get to know you better?

946
01:17:36,377 --> 01:17:40,369
Well, let me--
That's a good idea.

947
01:17:48,155 --> 01:17:50,622
Is that a battle wound you have?

948
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:58,591
I'm a sucker for war stories
in Romance languages.

949
01:17:58,766 --> 01:18:01,097
-Well, that's pretty easy.
-Yeah?

950
01:18:02,904 --> 01:18:08,865
I was in a village...called San Remo...

951
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:14,879
...the Krauts pounded us hard...

952
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,607
...me & Stan...

953
01:18:16,852 --> 01:18:21,584
...you remember Stan? We were the
only two left from our platoon.

954
01:18:21,858 --> 01:18:29,195
We heard a distant cry coming
from an abandoned shed.

955
01:18:29,998 --> 01:18:31,589
When night fell...

956
01:18:32,235 --> 01:18:33,599
A trap it was?

957
01:18:36,905 --> 01:18:38,394
Remember...

958
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:41,767
...invert your nouns and
your verbs.

959
01:19:06,436 --> 01:19:08,062
-Hungry?
-Famished.

960
01:19:08,237 --> 01:19:11,330
Don't say we can live on love.
That's how I missed breakfast.

961
01:19:15,579 --> 01:19:17,409
What's the matter?

962
01:19:18,748 --> 01:19:22,183
-What's the matter?
-Phillip and Vanessa Mclntyre.

963
01:19:22,353 --> 01:19:24,946
-Parents of a friend.
-You wanna say a quick hello?

964
01:19:25,122 --> 01:19:28,113
No! No, I'll be trapped.

965
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:30,054
Damn it!

966
01:19:33,197 --> 01:19:35,858
-Could you seat us in the bar?
-We're only serving...

967
01:19:36,033 --> 01:19:39,092
...in the front part of the restaurant
this afternoon.

968
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:45,601
Miss! Miss Stone.

969
01:19:45,777 --> 01:19:50,440
This has been the most romantic
weekend I may ever have.

970
01:19:50,614 --> 01:19:54,743
Ever. And all that's standing
between right now and perfection...

971
01:19:54,985 --> 01:19:57,248
...are the Mclntyres over there.

972
01:19:57,422 --> 01:20:02,654
Now, with the competition out there,
a girl's got to be able to move...

973
01:20:02,827 --> 01:20:05,590
...a few mountains
every once in a while.

974
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:09,529
-I could use all the help I could get.
-Come this way.

975
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:18,402
-I fixed it. No more Mclntyres.
-Thank you. Thank you.

976
01:20:20,712 --> 01:20:24,272
-Let's not talk about this.
-All right.

977
01:20:26,985 --> 01:20:29,111
Hold your breath and--

978
01:20:31,423 --> 01:20:33,447
And turn.

979
01:20:33,993 --> 01:20:37,325
Don't forget to smile.

980
01:20:38,397 --> 01:20:40,193
Arms up.

981
01:20:40,366 --> 01:20:43,027
Move together. Faster, Fran!

982
01:20:44,203 --> 01:20:47,638
-When you surface, smile.
-Come on, Connie!

983
01:20:50,276 --> 01:20:53,767
How about we have a girls' luncheon
this weekend? Just us.

984
01:20:54,614 --> 01:20:57,047
-Where's Spencer?
-Away.

985
01:20:57,216 --> 01:20:59,410
-I'm free.
-I'm busy.

986
01:20:59,586 --> 01:21:02,110
-What are you doing?
-She's dating a psychoanalyst.

987
01:21:02,288 --> 01:21:04,050
-Oh, really?
-Who's married.

988
01:21:04,223 --> 01:21:06,816
-Giselle!
-Sorry, it slipped.

989
01:21:06,993 --> 01:21:09,358
-Are you in, Connie?
-I'll check with Charlie.

990
01:21:09,528 --> 01:21:12,462
-Who?
-Charlie Stewart. Your cousin.

991
01:21:12,632 --> 01:21:14,690
You're kidding?

992
01:21:17,037 --> 01:21:19,766
We spent last weekend at the Cape.

993
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:23,568
-A little hideaway he knew about.
-Operative word, "hide."

994
01:21:23,743 --> 01:21:27,075
Men take women to the Cape in
the winter when they're embarrassed.

995
01:21:27,247 --> 01:21:30,409
-He's using you.
-He's not using you if you want to go.

996
01:21:30,584 --> 01:21:32,312
Come here. Don't listen to her.

997
01:21:33,053 --> 01:21:35,953
I love you, and I swear
I'm not saying this to hurt you.

998
01:21:36,123 --> 01:21:40,149
Charlie's promised to Deb Mclntyre.
She wears his pin.

999
01:21:40,961 --> 01:21:44,691
-Giselle, you know it's true.
-I don't know anything about a pin.

1000
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:46,856
Mclntyre?

1001
01:21:47,301 --> 01:21:50,167
Are her parents named
Phillip and Vanessa?

1002
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:52,635
You know them?

1003
01:21:54,308 --> 01:21:56,070
Only from a distance.

1004
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,723
-Good morning. Good morning.
-Goodbye. Good morning.

1005
01:22:12,895 --> 01:22:15,385
Okay, wait. No, we have an audience.
Don't look.

1006
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,160
No, I don't--
No. Stop it. Put me down.

1007
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:22,632
Put me down.
You're not coming in this house.

1008
01:22:22,803 --> 01:22:26,169
You are not coming
in this house. No.

1009
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,103
-Bye. Good morning.
-Good morning.

1010
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,244
Go away. Go away.

1011
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:42,255
How can you date a man like that?

1012
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:46,258
What if you're wrong about him?

1013
01:22:46,429 --> 01:22:48,589
What if I'm not?

1014
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:56,236
Coffee's cold.

1015
01:23:17,428 --> 01:23:18,917
Row!

1016
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:20,493
Ride the plank!

1017
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:22,857
Row!

1018
01:23:44,888 --> 01:23:47,287
Are your ears burning?

1019
01:23:47,993 --> 01:23:51,052
I think the feet go first
when they set the stake on fire.

1020
01:23:51,228 --> 01:23:53,991
"What do you say, Edward?
Should we have her back?"

1021
01:23:54,165 --> 01:23:56,428
"She's got rather nice legs."

1022
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,658
-Who's to say I wanna come back?
-What...

1023
01:23:58,837 --> 01:24:01,634
...Ieave me here with all these girls?

1024
01:24:11,683 --> 01:24:13,980
You'd think someone
would notice empty trays.

1025
01:24:14,152 --> 01:24:17,518
You are good. You remind me
of myself when I was your age.

1026
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,369
Cheers.

1027
01:24:34,607 --> 01:24:38,474
He's positively vomititious, Giselle.

1028
01:24:38,777 --> 01:24:41,404
Don't be so sentimental, Connie.

1029
01:24:42,581 --> 01:24:45,879
It was a fling. It's fine.
It was nothing.

1030
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,827
Hi!

1031
01:24:57,997 --> 01:24:59,930
Pleasure to meet you.

1032
01:25:05,671 --> 01:25:08,161
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.

1033
01:25:09,075 --> 01:25:12,305
Connie! Connie!
Excuse me. Sorry. Connie!

1034
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:15,379
Charlie. It's been a while.

1035
01:25:15,548 --> 01:25:18,414
Yeah. How are you?

1036
01:25:18,652 --> 01:25:21,313
I'm fine, thank you. You? Deb?

1037
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:25,817
-Pardon?
-Deb. Your girlfriend.

1038
01:25:25,992 --> 01:25:27,822
With the very large--

1039
01:25:27,994 --> 01:25:29,756
With the very large teeth.

1040
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:32,227
With the very large teeth.

1041
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,358
-Oh, did you think I didn't know?
-Connie.

1042
01:25:36,536 --> 01:25:40,494
Deb and I broke it off last summer.
That's Miranda.

1043
01:25:40,674 --> 01:25:46,306
We started seeing each other when
you stopped returning my calls...

1044
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,448
...or answering any of my letters.

1045
01:25:55,156 --> 01:25:56,645
Okay, maybe I should go.

1046
01:26:16,111 --> 01:26:18,601
Have you seen Spencer?

1047
01:26:25,354 --> 01:26:28,186
But I did see Charlie Stewart.

1048
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:33,522
And he told me that he and Deb
broke up last summer.

1049
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:38,528
And you told me they were together
when he invited me to the Cape.

1050
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:41,725
Oh, Connie.
I don't keep track of his dates.

1051
01:26:41,904 --> 01:26:46,431
They've been on-again, off-again
for the past few years.

1052
01:26:46,609 --> 01:26:50,738
No, apparently they've been
off-again for a while. For quite a while.

1053
01:26:50,913 --> 01:26:53,881
-So?
-So you made me believe...

1054
01:26:54,049 --> 01:26:56,676
...that he was hiding me.

1055
01:26:58,855 --> 01:27:01,186
Either way...

1056
01:27:01,356 --> 01:27:04,188
...why couldn't you let me be happy?

1057
01:27:10,466 --> 01:27:12,365
Betty.

1058
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,157
And we switch.

1059
01:27:40,064 --> 01:27:42,861
-Wonder teacher.
-Tommy.

1060
01:27:45,202 --> 01:27:48,728
-How's Harvard?
-Oh, not too bad. Not too bad.

1061
01:27:48,907 --> 01:27:51,397
-Congratulate me.
-You set a date?

1062
01:27:53,944 --> 01:27:55,968
No, nothing official. Yet.

1063
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:59,137
I meant, I got into Penn. Grad school.

1064
01:27:59,618 --> 01:28:02,586
Congratulations. What about Yale?

1065
01:28:03,187 --> 01:28:08,454
Yale? Oh, you mean Joanie.
Yeah. How about that, huh?

1066
01:28:08,692 --> 01:28:11,251
She is some girl.

1067
01:28:11,429 --> 01:28:13,988
-She's terrific.
-Yeah.

1068
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:19,396
Just the fact that she got in.
I mean, she will always have that.

1069
01:28:19,571 --> 01:28:23,506
Thanks to you. Miss Watson,
you've been real swell to her.

1070
01:28:23,675 --> 01:28:26,268
We both appreciate it.

1071
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,977
I'm sorry. "The fact that she got in, "
what does that mean?

1072
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:34,448
Well, she'll be in Philadelphia.

1073
01:28:34,619 --> 01:28:36,085
With me.

1074
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:43,452
Well, that's an awful long commute
to get dinner on the table by 5:00.

1075
01:28:44,063 --> 01:28:47,828
-And we switch.
-Thank you.

1076
01:28:53,873 --> 01:28:55,703
Excuse me.

1077
01:28:55,975 --> 01:28:59,341
Excuse me. Have you seen Spencer?
I can't find him anywhere.

1078
01:29:03,082 --> 01:29:06,881
Actually, Spencer asked me
to take you home.

1079
01:29:07,053 --> 01:29:11,182
-He has this meeting--
-ln New York.

1080
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:13,454
Thank you.

1081
01:29:42,122 --> 01:29:45,557
-Honey, what are you doing here?
-I'm staying the night.

1082
01:29:45,727 --> 01:29:49,526
-Spencer won't mind?
-Spencer won't notice.

1083
01:29:49,697 --> 01:29:55,329
-He's in New York again. Working.
-He's working hard for both of you.

1084
01:29:55,503 --> 01:29:59,336
Don't lie for him, Mother.
He does it so well for himself.

1085
01:29:59,506 --> 01:30:01,996
You're going to turn around,
go home...

1086
01:30:02,176 --> 01:30:04,473
...fix your face
and wait for your husband.

1087
01:30:04,645 --> 01:30:07,841
This is the bargain you made,
Elizabeth. We all did.

1088
01:30:08,016 --> 01:30:10,449
So you're not gonna let me
stay in my own house?

1089
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:12,779
Spencer's house is your house now.

1090
01:30:12,954 --> 01:30:16,912
Believe me, it's for your own good.

1091
01:30:33,976 --> 01:30:36,773
Miss Watson. Come in.

1092
01:30:37,212 --> 01:30:39,975
Seven law schools within 45 minutes
of Philadelphia.

1093
01:30:40,149 --> 01:30:42,878
You can study and get dinner
on the table by 5:00.

1094
01:30:43,052 --> 01:30:45,884
-It's too late.
-No. Some accept late admissions.

1095
01:30:46,055 --> 01:30:48,215
-I was upset at first.
-Joan, the guests.

1096
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:51,358
When Tommy told me that he got
accepted to Penn, I thought:

1097
01:30:51,527 --> 01:30:54,324
"Her fate is sealed.
How can she throw it all away?"

1098
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:58,295
I realized you won't have to. You
could bake your cake and eat it too.

1099
01:30:58,468 --> 01:31:00,697
We're married.

1100
01:31:02,004 --> 01:31:03,834
We eloped over the weekend.

1101
01:31:04,007 --> 01:31:06,770
Turned out he was petrified
of a big ceremony...

1102
01:31:06,942 --> 01:31:10,035
...so we did a sort of
spur-of-the-moment thing.

1103
01:31:10,213 --> 01:31:12,146
Very romantic.

1104
01:31:12,315 --> 01:31:14,077
Look.

1105
01:31:22,492 --> 01:31:24,618
It's beautiful.

1106
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:32,430
It was my choice. Not to go.
He would have supported it.

1107
01:31:33,036 --> 01:31:36,630
-But you don't have to choose.
-No, I have to.

1108
01:31:36,807 --> 01:31:39,775
I want a home, a family.
It's not something I'll sacrifice.

1109
01:31:39,944 --> 01:31:43,106
No one's asking you
to sacrifice that, Joan.

1110
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,009
I just want you to understand
that you can do both.

1111
01:31:46,183 --> 01:31:49,049
Think I'll wake up one day
and regret not being a lawyer?

1112
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:50,777
Yes, I'm afraid that you will.

1113
01:31:50,955 --> 01:31:55,391
Not as much as I'd regret not having
a family. Not being there to raise them.

1114
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:59,962
I know exactly what I'm doing, and
it doesn't make me any less smart.

1115
01:32:00,832 --> 01:32:03,857
-This must seem terrible to you.
-I didn't say that. I--

1116
01:32:04,034 --> 01:32:07,059
Sure you did. You always do.

1117
01:32:07,239 --> 01:32:10,935
You stand in class and tell us to look
beyond the image, but you don't.

1118
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:15,009
To you, a housewife is someone who
sold her soul for a center hall colonial.

1119
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:18,978
She has no depth,
no intellect, no interests.

1120
01:32:21,752 --> 01:32:25,551
You're the one who said
I could do anything I wanted.

1121
01:32:25,724 --> 01:32:28,089
This is what I want.

1122
01:32:32,664 --> 01:32:34,824
Congratulations.

1123
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,024
Be happy.

1124
01:32:58,089 --> 01:33:02,184
Sometimes I think you say
these things to provoke me.

1125
01:33:02,361 --> 01:33:05,329
Does your father know
that you speak this way?

1126
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:12,632
Does your wife know you're here?

1127
01:33:50,344 --> 01:33:54,006
-Where might I find Charlie Stewart?
-Charlie Stewart? C1 744.

1128
01:33:54,181 --> 01:33:57,445
-But it's too late. You'll have to leave.
-All right.

1129
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:04,250
You can't go up there!

1130
01:34:07,495 --> 01:34:09,359
What is going on here?

1131
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:11,861
There's no women allowed
in the dorms!

1132
01:34:13,735 --> 01:34:16,862
Can you please not interrupt me?!

1133
01:34:18,439 --> 01:34:23,569
Connie! What are you doing here?

1134
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,844
Well, I saw....

1135
01:34:27,015 --> 01:34:29,107
I saw Big Teeth with...

1136
01:34:29,285 --> 01:34:32,879
...Kevin Tawil looking pretty cozy,
and I thought that maybe....

1137
01:34:33,054 --> 01:34:35,647
Maybe you two weren't....

1138
01:34:36,557 --> 01:34:40,287
-Dating?
-Yes. Thank you.

1139
01:34:40,562 --> 01:34:42,722
Hey, no girls in the dorm.

1140
01:34:46,735 --> 01:34:49,965
I know I have made mistakes.
A ton.

1141
01:34:50,539 --> 01:34:53,371
But I never make them twice.

1142
01:35:12,696 --> 01:35:14,219
And?

1143
01:35:14,797 --> 01:35:20,394
And it was perfect. Romantic.
We stayed up all night talking.

1144
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:22,901
You're late. What happened
to Sunday brunch?

1145
01:35:23,073 --> 01:35:26,269
We stayed up all night too.
Not talking.

1146
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:30,242
The psychoanalyst? Again.

1147
01:35:32,148 --> 01:35:35,207
-Divine exhaustion.
-He's married.

1148
01:35:35,385 --> 01:35:37,181
He's not married like
you and Tommy.

1149
01:35:37,355 --> 01:35:38,787
What does that mean?

1150
01:35:38,955 --> 01:35:42,082
It means he and his wife
don't speak the same language.

1151
01:35:42,259 --> 01:35:45,022
-Spelled S-E-X.
-Does he pay you?

1152
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:46,718
For sex?

1153
01:35:47,064 --> 01:35:49,588
At the rate you're going,
you could make a fortune.

1154
01:35:50,133 --> 01:35:53,533
-Betty.
-Everyone thinks so.

1155
01:35:53,704 --> 01:35:57,400
Do you know what they say?
They say you're a whore.

1156
01:35:57,908 --> 01:36:01,934
Once they've all sampled you,
they'll toss you aside like a used rag.

1157
01:36:02,113 --> 01:36:04,945
-Betty, stop now.
-The men you love don't want you.

1158
01:36:05,116 --> 01:36:08,482
-Your father doesn't want you.
-I'm gonna meet you downstairs.

1159
01:36:08,652 --> 01:36:10,676
-Professor Dunbar.
-Betty, that's enough.

1160
01:36:10,855 --> 01:36:13,584
Everybody knows that you hide
outside his house.

1161
01:36:13,792 --> 01:36:17,454
It must be torturous running after
a man who doesn't care about you...

1162
01:36:17,895 --> 01:36:21,193
...who's in love with someone else,
who hates you.

1163
01:36:21,365 --> 01:36:23,696
-He hates you!
-Betty.

1164
01:36:23,869 --> 01:36:25,802
And it hurts! No!

1165
01:36:25,971 --> 01:36:28,962
-Get off me!
-Quiet!

1166
01:36:38,049 --> 01:36:40,039
Oh, God.

1167
01:36:41,853 --> 01:36:45,151
-He doesn't want me.
-Okay.

1168
01:36:45,358 --> 01:36:48,451
He doesn't sleep with me. He--

1169
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,283
I know.

1170
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:06,905
I say no. I mean, it's not fair to her.

1171
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:10,707
-She's not happy.
-Don't forget about her outburst.

1172
01:37:10,883 --> 01:37:13,009
Oh, that's right.

1173
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:16,880
Dr. Staunton, will you tell the
alumnae the figures you have?

1174
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:20,024
Enrollment for her class next year...

1175
01:37:20,193 --> 01:37:24,686
...is the highest
the department's had. Ever.

1176
01:37:25,698 --> 01:37:28,359
She'd have to promise
to turn in her lesson plans.

1177
01:37:28,768 --> 01:37:32,669
In advance. And they'll need
to be approved.

1178
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,830
She'll never agree to that.

1179
01:37:44,051 --> 01:37:47,178
Bill, the brochures
for Europe arrived.

1180
01:37:51,692 --> 01:37:53,591
Surprise!

1181
01:37:53,927 --> 01:37:56,622
Sir, I'm so sorry!

1182
01:37:56,797 --> 01:37:59,287
-Who are you?
-I'm Stanley Sher...

1183
01:37:59,466 --> 01:38:02,059
...a friend of Bill's.
We were in the 37th together.

1184
01:38:02,236 --> 01:38:04,999
-Okay.
-You must be Katherine.

1185
01:38:05,173 --> 01:38:07,163
I am.

1186
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:10,867
He told me you were a looker, but....

1187
01:38:12,846 --> 01:38:16,781
-I'll wait for you downstairs, Stanley.
-Okey-dokey.

1188
01:38:20,722 --> 01:38:22,985
So you and Bill
were in the war together?

1189
01:38:23,157 --> 01:38:26,683
Yep. Now he's some
fancy teacher...

1190
01:38:26,861 --> 01:38:29,226
...and I'm in air conditioning.

1191
01:38:29,398 --> 01:38:30,887
Forget the A-bomb.

1192
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:34,733
Freon. It's gonna change
the good old U.S. of A.

1193
01:38:35,104 --> 01:38:39,096
Open the entire West to development.
I'm based in El Paso.

1194
01:38:39,541 --> 01:38:42,407
-Oh, thank you.
-And cheers.

1195
01:38:45,281 --> 01:38:47,748
Well, you've come a long way
from San Remo.

1196
01:38:47,917 --> 01:38:49,850
Yes, sirree.

1197
01:38:50,452 --> 01:38:52,612
That in California?

1198
01:38:53,322 --> 01:38:54,845
Italy.

1199
01:38:55,023 --> 01:38:58,423
-Where you two were stationed.
-ltaly?

1200
01:38:58,594 --> 01:39:01,061
Well, somebody's been
pulling your long leg.

1201
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:05,461
We were stationed at the Army
Language lnstitute on Long lsland.

1202
01:39:05,634 --> 01:39:09,569
Closest we ever got to ltaly
was the baked ziti at Mama Leone's.

1203
01:39:09,738 --> 01:39:12,672
I don't think Bill's
ever been to Europe.

1204
01:39:12,842 --> 01:39:15,002
I sure as hell haven't.

1205
01:39:15,411 --> 01:39:16,672
Cheers.

1206
01:39:26,855 --> 01:39:28,788
Katherine!

1207
01:39:32,796 --> 01:39:34,524
You okay?

1208
01:39:35,498 --> 01:39:37,556
I met Stan.

1209
01:39:38,501 --> 01:39:39,762
Hell of a nice guy.

1210
01:39:39,936 --> 01:39:41,698
-Yeah.
-What a talker.

1211
01:39:41,871 --> 01:39:43,804
Yeah.

1212
01:39:43,975 --> 01:39:47,034
We go back a long way.

1213
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:49,734
All the way to Long lsland.

1214
01:39:53,684 --> 01:39:55,913
Secret's out.

1215
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:00,149
What an incredible lie.

1216
01:40:03,226 --> 01:40:06,820
I spoke the language, I had the
uniform, people just assumed things.

1217
01:40:06,998 --> 01:40:11,491
I didn't correct them.
I guess I should've done.

1218
01:40:12,737 --> 01:40:15,136
I guess you should've done.

1219
01:40:16,874 --> 01:40:19,774
Katherine, look, I'm sorry, okay?

1220
01:40:20,412 --> 01:40:22,436
I made a mistake.

1221
01:40:22,613 --> 01:40:24,512
Just give me a chance...

1222
01:40:24,682 --> 01:40:27,206
...to straighten things out, okay?

1223
01:40:30,489 --> 01:40:33,286
Why couldn't you just be honest?

1224
01:40:36,061 --> 01:40:38,153
You don't make it easy.

1225
01:40:40,331 --> 01:40:42,195
You're so perfect, you....

1226
01:40:44,302 --> 01:40:47,327
It's impossible to be honest
with you. I....

1227
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,532
For you, it is.

1228
01:40:53,712 --> 01:40:57,772
Well, it's not just me, Katherine.
Joan failed you too, right?

1229
01:40:57,950 --> 01:41:01,350
-That's an awful thing to say.
-I know, but it's the truth.

1230
01:41:02,655 --> 01:41:05,452
If you want honesty,
I can be real honest.

1231
01:41:05,657 --> 01:41:08,648
You didn't come to Wellesley
to help people find their way.

1232
01:41:08,828 --> 01:41:12,354
I think you came to help people
find your way.

1233
01:41:36,989 --> 01:41:40,424
I'm not accustomed
to hunting you down.

1234
01:41:42,395 --> 01:41:44,954
Elizabeth, look at me, please.

1235
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:52,561
I've spoken with Mrs. Jones.
There will be no divorce.

1236
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:57,036
There's always a period
of adjustment.

1237
01:41:57,211 --> 01:42:01,044
I've assured her that you will try
for a year.

1238
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:05,914
Look at this, Mother.

1239
01:42:10,759 --> 01:42:12,953
Spencer will try as well.

1240
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:17,324
According to her, he's really
very upset. You should call him.

1241
01:42:17,499 --> 01:42:21,457
She's smiling. Is she happy?

1242
01:42:22,871 --> 01:42:26,704
The important thing
is not to tell anyone.

1243
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,603
She looks happy.

1244
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:31,475
So, what does it matter?

1245
01:42:32,147 --> 01:42:36,480
Don't wash your dirty laundry
in public.

1246
01:42:36,786 --> 01:42:39,413
Let me tell you something.

1247
01:42:40,688 --> 01:42:44,145
Not everything is as it seems.

1248
01:43:03,379 --> 01:43:05,903
Dear Miss Watson:

1249
01:43:06,081 --> 01:43:08,241
It is with great pleasure...

1250
01:43:08,417 --> 01:43:10,611
...that we invite you...

1251
01:43:10,786 --> 01:43:14,243
...to return as an instructor...

1252
01:43:14,423 --> 01:43:16,754
...in the Art History department...

1253
01:43:16,926 --> 01:43:22,558
...for the 1 954-1 955
academic year.

1254
01:43:22,731 --> 01:43:27,599
We do wish to make clear, however,
that this invitation...

1255
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:33,231
...is absolutely conditional
upon the following:

1256
01:43:34,778 --> 01:43:36,972
Please, Nora, may we continue?

1257
01:43:37,147 --> 01:43:39,239
Number one:

1258
01:43:39,749 --> 01:43:44,981
You will teach only the syllabus
as outlined by the department chair.

1259
01:43:45,922 --> 01:43:47,616
Number two:

1260
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:49,690
All lesson plans...

1261
01:43:49,861 --> 01:43:55,128
...must be submitted at the beginning
of every term for approval...

1262
01:43:55,299 --> 01:43:57,425
...and revision.

1263
01:43:57,601 --> 01:43:58,965
Number three:

1264
01:43:59,135 --> 01:44:03,230
You shall not provide counsel
beyond your own subject...

1265
01:44:03,406 --> 01:44:06,431
...for any student at any time.

1266
01:44:06,611 --> 01:44:08,237
And finally:

1267
01:44:08,412 --> 01:44:13,748
That you will agree to maintain
a strictly professional relationship...

1268
01:44:13,918 --> 01:44:16,511
...with all members of the faculty.

1269
01:44:16,687 --> 01:44:19,154
-Good evening , Katherine.
-Hi , Violet.

1270
01:44:19,557 --> 01:44:23,720
Assuming you accept the conditions,
we look forward to your continuing...

1271
01:44:23,895 --> 01:44:26,124
...to be a part
of our Wellesley tradition.

1272
01:44:34,906 --> 01:44:37,305
Nice party.

1273
01:44:37,476 --> 01:44:39,170
I didn't realize.

1274
01:44:40,278 --> 01:44:42,108
It was a surprise.

1275
01:44:42,314 --> 01:44:45,077
William H. Taft.
What does the letter H stand for?

1276
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:47,717
-Howard.
-Howard. Yes!

1277
01:44:48,487 --> 01:44:50,317
Howard.

1278
01:44:51,256 --> 01:44:53,246
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1279
01:44:53,425 --> 01:44:57,292
The important thing is
that you'll be back next year.

1280
01:44:57,462 --> 01:44:59,895
Hopefully living here.

1281
01:45:02,935 --> 01:45:07,303
Well, I haven't really thought about
that. They just told me today.

1282
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:11,505
Well, there's still plenty of time.

1283
01:45:11,877 --> 01:45:14,902
You should be celebrating.

1284
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:22,548
You're right.

1285
01:45:24,657 --> 01:45:26,681
You're right. Let's celebrate.

1286
01:45:29,996 --> 01:45:33,795
Let's go upstairs and get gussied up
and go out dancing.

1287
01:45:36,135 --> 01:45:40,798
Silly, it's after 8:00.
Strike It Rich is on.

1288
01:45:40,975 --> 01:45:44,967
-Life isn't about Strike It Rich.
-It's a school night.

1289
01:45:45,144 --> 01:45:49,477
-So what?
-So I don't want to go. I'm happy here.

1290
01:45:51,018 --> 01:45:52,314
It's back on.

1291
01:45:55,789 --> 01:45:59,485
-Do you feel good about music....
-Oh, isn't he handsome?

1292
01:46:01,061 --> 01:46:02,994
Watch with me.

1293
01:46:04,732 --> 01:46:09,999
"You talked me into it, " says this
oldie. What's the title of this one?

1294
01:46:13,273 --> 01:46:15,365
"You Made Me Love You."

1295
01:46:15,542 --> 01:46:19,238
"You Made Me Love--"
"You Made Me Love You."

1296
01:46:23,318 --> 01:46:25,945
You get all that from looking
at paint on a canvas...

1297
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:28,849
...and it's her facial expression...

1298
01:46:29,024 --> 01:46:31,150
...her eyes that makes
you think that.

1299
01:46:31,325 --> 01:46:35,090
-I think that makes it interesting.
-The context that it comes from...

1300
01:46:35,263 --> 01:46:36,786
...affects the way we view it.

1301
01:46:36,965 --> 01:46:40,058
I think it provokes us because
it provoked the painter...

1302
01:46:40,235 --> 01:46:43,601
...and in turn, he's kind of sending
that message to us.

1303
01:46:43,772 --> 01:46:47,332
Whether or not it's a good painting
cannot be subjective.

1304
01:46:47,509 --> 01:46:50,272
I feel like I'm missing something.

1305
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:45,358
It was Joan's idea.

1306
01:47:49,906 --> 01:47:51,964
How else will you remember us?

1307
01:48:35,219 --> 01:48:38,278
-They've invited you back.
-Do you think they made a mistake?

1308
01:48:38,456 --> 01:48:39,888
I do.

1309
01:48:44,663 --> 01:48:48,894
-Elizabeth, I don't see Spencer.
-Excuse me, Mother.

1310
01:48:49,067 --> 01:48:52,467
Miss Watson, can you help me
get in touch with your friend...

1311
01:48:52,638 --> 01:48:53,899
...in Greenwich Village?

1312
01:48:54,071 --> 01:48:56,504
What do you need
in Greenwich Village?

1313
01:48:56,675 --> 01:48:58,073
An apartment.

1314
01:48:59,578 --> 01:49:02,546
I filed for a divorce this morning.

1315
01:49:03,782 --> 01:49:06,875
And since we know
I'm not welcome at your house....

1316
01:49:08,587 --> 01:49:12,750
You remember Giselle Levy?
What did you call her?

1317
01:49:13,659 --> 01:49:16,126
"A New York kike." That's it.

1318
01:49:16,796 --> 01:49:19,593
Well, we're going to be roommates.

1319
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:22,462
Hi.

1320
01:49:22,635 --> 01:49:26,126
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1321
01:49:38,718 --> 01:49:40,514
You okay?

1322
01:49:42,555 --> 01:49:45,455
-Greenwich Village?
-Yeah. For a while.

1323
01:49:46,259 --> 01:49:48,488
Then, who knows?

1324
01:49:48,661 --> 01:49:51,959
Maybe law school. Yale, even.

1325
01:49:54,201 --> 01:49:55,997
Well...

1326
01:49:56,669 --> 01:50:01,230
...I wouldn't want to come up against
you in any court anywhere.

1327
01:50:01,407 --> 01:50:04,102
Maybe I can drop by next year?

1328
01:50:04,278 --> 01:50:06,575
Keep you on your toes.

1329
01:50:08,682 --> 01:50:10,774
You will be here?

1330
01:50:11,552 --> 01:50:13,542
Miss Watson?

1331
01:50:19,627 --> 01:50:21,526
Dear Betty:

1332
01:50:21,695 --> 01:50:26,563
I came to Wellesley because
I wanted to make a difference.

1333
01:50:27,134 --> 01:50:28,828
But to change for others....

1334
01:50:29,004 --> 01:50:31,164
--is to lie to yourself.

1335
01:50:31,339 --> 01:50:32,635
My teacher...

1336
01:50:32,806 --> 01:50:36,172
...Katherine Watson,
lived by her own definition...

1337
01:50:36,344 --> 01:50:38,607
...and would not compromise that.

1338
01:50:38,779 --> 01:50:41,474
Not even for Wellesley.

1339
01:50:42,117 --> 01:50:44,949
I dedicate this, my last editorial...

1340
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:47,087
... to an extraordinary woman...

1341
01:50:47,255 --> 01:50:49,154
... who lived by example...

1342
01:50:49,324 --> 01:50:53,350
...and compelled us all to see
the world through new eyes.

1343
01:50:54,596 --> 01:50:58,463
By the time you read this,
she'll be sailing to Europe...

1344
01:50:58,633 --> 01:51:01,533
... where I know she'll find new walls
to break down...

1345
01:51:01,704 --> 01:51:03,671
...and new ideas
to replace them with.

1346
01:51:03,838 --> 01:51:05,930
Hold it, everybody.

1347
01:51:11,781 --> 01:51:14,078
I've heard her called a quitter
for leaving...

1348
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:16,717
...an aimless wanderer.

1349
01:51:16,886 --> 01:51:21,083
But not all who wander are aimless.

1350
01:51:21,256 --> 01:51:25,749
Especially not those who seek truth
beyond tradition...

1351
01:51:27,763 --> 01:51:29,992
...beyond definition...

1352
01:51:32,703 --> 01:51:34,761
...beyond the image.

1353
01:51:35,204 --> 01:51:37,694
Get the hell out of the way!

1354
01:51:47,216 --> 01:51:49,410
I'll never forget you.

1355
01:51:54,691 --> 01:51:58,922
Betty! Betty!

1356
01:52:28,626 --> 01:52:30,252
What about after this war, Lee?

1357
01:52:30,428 --> 01:52:33,191
Well, this job belongs
to some soldier.

1358
01:52:33,364 --> 01:52:34,625
When he comes back...

1359
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,233
-...he can have it.
-Oh, that's swell.
