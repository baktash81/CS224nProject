<i>I'll never forget
The summer I was eight years old.</i>

16
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:50,688
<i>It was a summer of tea parties
and sword fights.</i>

17
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:57,122
<i>Of longing to grow up
and fearing to grow old.</i>

18
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:00,189
<i>Of wishing things
could stay the same forever.</i>

19
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:07,688
<i>That was the summer
we found the boat.</i>

20
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:12,156
I scalp rodent enemy.

21
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:14,588
I avenge brave chief.

22
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:16,823
- Let him go.
- Try and make me.

23
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:19,823
I'll get you!

24
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,256
Tiger Lily, come on.

25
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:23,889
Wait for me!

26
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,322
I am Pan,
God of the woodlands,

27
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:42,156
and these are my woods.

28
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:43,790
You're no Pan.

29
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:52,256
Take that!

30
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,989
Surrender
the Indian princess now,

31
00:02:55,022 --> 00:02:58,356
or say goodbye to the hostage,
Chief Witchataw.

32
00:02:58,389 --> 00:02:59,922
Never!

33
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,790
Oh!

34
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:25,688
I'll get it.

35
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:28,322
Mama said we're not supposed
to go over the wall.

36
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:31,855
Blimey.
Come and take a look at this.

37
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:46,222
Who do you think it belongs to?

38
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:48,723
Finders keepers.

39
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:50,922
It's ours now.

40
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:58,256
She just needs
a bit of fixing up.

41
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:01,622
Just imagine.
The three of us, mateys at sea.

42
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:04,955
Braving the elements to discover
uncharted territories.

43
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,089
Where to next, Captain?

44
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:14,822
But, David,
what if we get lost?

45
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,922
Well, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

46
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:21,056
We'll be the Lost Boys
of the wild. And girls.

47
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,656
Peter, I almost forgot.
I found this in the woods.

48
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:29,622
Do you reckon it's special?
To the Indians?

49
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:30,989
It's an eagle feather.

50
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:36,822
I'd better wash up.

51
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:22,789
Hurry along, you two.
Did you not see the time?

52
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,089
Oh dear, oh dear.
I shall be too late.

53
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:29,156
Hush, don't tease him.
He almost lost his scalp today.

54
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:33,122
Would you ever get a move on?
Go on, get in with you.

55
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:36,989
Did you forget your Aunt
Eleanor's coming for dinner?

56
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:39,122
Oh, you'll be the death of me,
the pair of you.

57
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,256
Mmm.

58
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:43,855
Who are these dirty vagabonds

59
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,822
and what have they done
with my children?

60
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:49,256
- Where's Peter?
- He went to speak with Father.

61
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:52,122
Upstairs, both of you.

62
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:54,022
Yes, but this one I keep.

63
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:55,589
- Get yourselves cleaned up.
- Come, talk to me.

64
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:56,989
I have something for you.

65
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:03,289
The tinker was in this morning,
mending the pots,

66
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:07,056
and when he was done, he found
he had some extra copper,

67
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:11,655
and with it he agreed
to fashion you a small present.

68
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:13,922
Would you like to see it?

69
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:21,622
- It's just a bell.
- Oh!

70
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:24,022
She didn't mean it, I promise.

71
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:26,889
No, no, it's alright.

72
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:51,056
- Let me guess.
- Oh!

73
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,089
- Peter.
- <i>The Golden Hind?</i>

74
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:56,356
You gave me a fright.

75
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:00,056
It's not suppertime
already, is it?

76
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:04,022
- Is it for old Mr. Brown?
- Right you are.

77
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,289
<i>The Golden Hind.</i>

78
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:12,789
The first ship to sail
all the way around the globe.

79
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:17,789
Imagine what it must be like
to see the whole world.

80
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:21,622
To sail the Indian Ocean
and the Pacific

81
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:25,789
and maybe even discover
new lands.

82
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:30,789
Ah... The things
she must have seen.

83
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:36,256
When the first baby laughed...

84
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,056
...for the first time,

85
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:42,156
its laugh broke
into a thousand pieces

86
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:44,989
and they all went
skipping about,

87
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:51,655
and that was the beginning
of the fairies.

88
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:56,122
You see, fairies are far
too magical for the human eye.

89
00:07:56,156 --> 00:08:02,089
So when we look at them,
they take the form of bells.

90
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:06,855
Every child has a fairy
born just for them.

91
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:10,688
And this...

92
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:13,089
...tinker's bell
was born for you.

93
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:25,056
Tinker Bell.
It's wonderful to meet you.

94
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:33,322
What's this?

95
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:39,289
"Dear Mr. Littleton,

96
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:40,922
"it is my duty to inform you

97
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:43,789
"that your son Peter
is currently failing...

98
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,056
"All his subjects."

99
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:50,855
- Peter.
- I know what she thinks.

100
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,622
I may not be David,
but I'm not a duffer.

101
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:57,056
Peter, who said anything
about David?

102
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,922
If you were a duffer,
would you be able to recite

103
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,922
a complete index
of British naval vessels

104
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:03,156
from the last decade
in under five minutes?

105
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,189
Would you be able to construct

106
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:09,789
a fully functioning
model galleon in a bottle?

107
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:11,855
Unlike your siblings,
I might add.

108
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:13,989
Eh?

109
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:15,289
I'm not in trouble, then?

110
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,156
Of course you're in trouble.

111
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:29,289
Look, you've got to try, Peter.

112
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,056
For me?

113
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:39,323
Come here.

114
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,122
Careful, darling.

115
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:21,256
Last one.

116
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,189
Beware of the queen of hearts.

117
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:34,955
Easy does it.

118
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,323
Well done.

119
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:42,822
- Bravo.
- Bravo. Come on, darling.

120
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,688
Let's keep going.

121
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:48,655
This silly game has become
something of a family sport.

122
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:49,822
Our record is four decks,

123
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:53,089
but Jack thinks
we can do it in five.

124
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:56,022
You know, I'm...
I'm slightly shocked,

125
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:59,323
you allow him to have cards
in the house at all.

126
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:08,955
Red Queen captures White Queen.

127
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:14,290
- Alice, Jack.
- Coming!

128
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:16,855
All right, almost done,
almost done.

129
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,022
All right.

130
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,722
There you are.

131
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,588
Mmm. Don't you look handsome.

132
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:42,755
Not nearly as handsome
as you are beautiful, my queen.

133
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:56,822
Mmm.

134
00:11:56,855 --> 00:12:00,056
My sis... My sister
is in the other room...

135
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,755
My sister's in the other room.

136
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:06,655
Rose?

137
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:15,289
- Oh, yeah.
- She's in rare form tonight.

138
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:16,922
Uh-oh.

139
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:31,190
David. What do you think
about dancing lessons?

140
00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:34,955
One must have lessons if one
hopes to ever attend a ball.

141
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:38,989
I don't think that's quite where
David's interests lie, Eleanor.

142
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:42,588
Mama, I wanted to ask if you...

143
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:45,356
Alice.
Speak when you're spoken to.

144
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,122
Really, child.

145
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:52,655
But if everybody
obeyed that rule

146
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,022
and you only spoke
when you were spoken to,

147
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:58,855
and the other person
always waited for you to begin,

148
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:02,056
nobody would ever say anything.

149
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:04,256
The Red Queen
does not tolerate disobedience.

150
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,955
Off with your head.

151
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:08,588
Alice, what was it
you wanted to ask?

152
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,822
A pardon
from the White Queen.

153
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,322
I wondered if you might help me
with a sewing project.

154
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:18,922
Ah, now, good girl. Sewing is
very becoming to a young lady.

155
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,322
I need to mend
my white rabbit's waistcoat.

156
00:13:21,356 --> 00:13:22,789
It was torn this afternoon

157
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:25,190
when he was taken hostage
by Indian warriors.

158
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,089
Hmm. Poor thing.
Of course I'll help you.

159
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:30,322
Good heavens, Rose,

160
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:32,655
the girl's fingernails
are gnawed to the quick,

161
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,989
and what's left of them
is black with dirt.

162
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,289
She was
playing outside, Ellie.

163
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:40,289
- It's what children do.
- No, it's what boys do.

164
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:43,356
It's quite a different matter
with girls.

165
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,922
For heaven's sake, this is not
a way to raise a daughter.

166
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:49,789
Which you would know from your wealth
of experience raising children?

167
00:13:57,655 --> 00:13:58,688
It's brilliant.

168
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,955
Well, children,
I have some very exciting news.

169
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:02,622
- David has been...
- No...

170
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:07,322
David has been accepted
to Bristlemoss School.

171
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:10,855
He starts the new term
in a month's time.

172
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,156
Bristlemoss School?

173
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:13,855
Does that mean
you're moving away?

174
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,256
Now, children, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

175
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,655
Your aunt really shouldn't have
told you about this

176
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:21,722
before discussing it
with your mother and me.

177
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:24,889
There's quite a few details
yet to iron out.

178
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:27,989
No, I have discussed it,
with Rose.

179
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:32,622
I was going to speak to you.
I just haven't had the chance.

180
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:41,356
William and I
will fund David's tuition.

181
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,722
Everything has been arranged.

182
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:49,023
You agreed to this?

183
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:52,189
I don't see why we must
make things harder on ourselves.

184
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,655
Jack.

185
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:57,523
- Rose, darling, let him go.
- Jack.

186
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,189
Do you know?

187
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:07,855
Boys who are away from home

188
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:11,156
still get presents
for their birthday.

189
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:15,189
My hat, you'll still make it
for me, won't you?

190
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:16,990
Of course.

191
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:31,755
It's an eagle feather.

192
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,222
The most sacred
of all Indian symbols.

193
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:37,289
What does it stand for?

194
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:40,156
- Courage.
- Courage.

195
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:45,056
Well, we can all use a little
extra courage now and then.

196
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:50,822
<i>The Golden Key.</i> Again.

197
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:52,322
It's my favorite.

198
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:54,156
Oh, I know.

199
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:02,289
We need to check
for the monsters.

200
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:10,322
Found one.

201
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,922
- Good night, my loves.
- Good night.

202
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:36,588
I don't want you to go away.

203
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:42,555
How about I leave my shadow behind while I'm gone?

204
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:46,822
He's sillier than I am,

205
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:49,588
so you'll have to keep him
out of trouble.

206
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:51,056
- Deal?
- Yeah.

207
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:54,056
Not me. Him.

208
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:57,056
Deal.

209
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:08,156
Do people really forget
how to dream when they grow up?

210
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:10,655
Aunt Eleanor certainly has.

211
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,256
But have Mother and Father?

212
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:14,356
Why not?

213
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:17,089
I reckon some people
have extra dream dust

214
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:19,022
that can travel
out of the nursery windows

215
00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:21,322
and be absorbed by grown-ups.

216
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:24,890
Should we open the window, then?
Just to be sure?

217
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:26,789
Great idea.

218
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:07,989
I saw the letter
from your teacher.

219
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,588
You're not to go outside today

220
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:13,122
until you've finished
your arithmetic.

221
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,022
All right?

222
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:25,022
- Morning.
- Morning.

223
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:34,156
- What's that?
- Uh...

224
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:37,122
List of supplies.

225
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:41,156
- For old Mr. Brown's replica?
- That's exactly right.

226
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:43,356
I'm going into London today
to get them.

227
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,655
I might also catch
an old friend.

228
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:49,856
Will you be long?

229
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:54,823
No.

230
00:18:56,922 --> 00:18:58,289
Toodle-oo, Peter.

231
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,655
Dishes and arithmetic.
What a dreadful day.

232
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:22,855
Why are you so good at this?

233
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:28,555
I can't do this.

234
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:32,989
No. That was nothing.

235
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:36,156
Oh, you've won.

236
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:39,855
Can we go and play
hide-and-seek now?

237
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,256
<i>The bustle of London</i>

238
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,022
<i>held an edge of mystery
in our minds.</i>

239
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:57,322
<i>We knew our father
had a life before us,</i>

240
00:19:57,356 --> 00:20:00,222
<i>but what that life
had actually been...</i>

241
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:03,922
<i>We could scarcely imagine.</i>

242
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:07,156
Have you seen your dad?

243
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:09,889
No.

244
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:12,122
The boss?

245
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:14,588
Uh, I've needed to stay away.

246
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:17,189
How is he?

247
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:19,222
He's still the boss, isn't he?

248
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:24,855
Have you ever thought of coming
by, for old times' sake?

249
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:28,588
We both know I can't.

250
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,056
How's the rest of your family?

251
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:38,222
My eldest son will soon be
leaving for Bristlemoss.

252
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:42,189
Oh. Will you look at that?
You must be proud.

253
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:46,889
Yeah. Suppose I am.

254
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:51,989
My own boy, Bristlemoss.

255
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:53,622
Who'd have thought it, eh?

256
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:58,022
I should get him something.

257
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,089
The boy deserves a gift
for an accomplishment like that,

258
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:02,622
doesn't he?

259
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:08,922
I found you.

260
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:11,022
You hardly gave me a challenge.

261
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:40,855
- Let me help.
- I don't need your help.

262
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:42,356
Mama will let you play
once you're done.

263
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:43,855
Leave me alone.

264
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:48,789
You were never planning on repairing
that boat with me, were you?

265
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:50,322
Of course I was.
I didn't know I'd get...

266
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:52,589
It doesn't matter.

267
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:55,189
Go to your stupid school.

268
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:57,356
You're just like
all the rest of them.

269
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:59,256
But not me.

270
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,789
No one will catch me
and make me a man.

271
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:06,589
Hard at work?

272
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:10,523
Uh, I just wanted to...

273
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:13,256
David?

274
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:21,289
For the man of the moment.

275
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,222
Well, open it.

276
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:30,989
It's just like...

277
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:33,822
The one my father
gave to me, yes.

278
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:36,955
You never met your grandfather.

279
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,989
Um, he...

280
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:42,722
Had high hopes for me.

281
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:46,222
I'm afraid I never quite fulfilled them.

282
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:51,589
But I want you to know
I'm proud of you, David.

283
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:05,922
All right, I'll let you
get back to it.

284
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,955
Give me that.

285
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:15,755
We'll still have time
for adventures before I leave.

286
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:17,922
What are you doing?

287
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,789
Pirates.
This could be dangerous.

288
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:50,955
You can retreat if you want.

289
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:53,622
Go back if you want,
Bristlemoss boy.

290
00:23:54,322 --> 00:23:55,722
I'm not scared.

291
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:56,989
Neither am I.

292
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:01,688
One... Two...

293
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:03,256
Three.

294
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:11,688
I know you're here!

295
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:14,755
Come out and fight!

296
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,755
Come here!

297
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,889
I'll fight all the pirates
in the sea.

298
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:24,922
Yah!

299
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:27,789
Behind you!

300
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:37,688
Up above!

301
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:41,922
Well done, David!

302
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:46,622
Yay!

303
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:48,322
Whoo!

304
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:06,989
David!

305
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:28,222
Argh!

306
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,688
I miss David.

307
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:15,822
- Did you see that?
- What?

308
00:27:16,189 --> 00:27:17,855
That's it.

309
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:21,089
We were playing hide-and-seek
and now he wants me to find him.

310
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:22,290
Alice.

311
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:25,688
He's gone.

312
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:28,889
He's gone,
and it's because of me.

313
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:30,588
Peter, please.

314
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:27,356
<i>You can retreat
if you want.</i>

315
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,189
<i>Go back if you want,
Bristlemoss boy.</i>

316
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:38,056
No, Alice.

317
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,989
Mama?

318
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:47,022
Go and play.

319
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:53,855
What are you doing?

320
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:57,223
Making a hat for David,
as I promised.

321
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:04,588
Did you hear that, Tink?

322
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:08,322
She's making him a hat.
He will come back.

323
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:13,588
There we are.

324
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:15,755
Why isn't Mama tucking us in?

325
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,322
I want Mama.

326
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,157
Your mother needs her rest.

327
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:31,922
Come on, then.
Let's read a story.

328
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:35,789
Goody! Tell us the story
about the orphanage.

329
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:38,655
Let's see.

330
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:42,688
I think this is the right one.

331
00:29:44,922 --> 00:29:46,989
"Long ago,

332
00:29:47,022 --> 00:29:49,989
<i>"in a faraway land,</i>

333
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:53,022
<i>"there was an orphanage.</i>

334
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:56,322
<i>"By day, the children did
as they were told.</i>

335
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:59,555
<i>"They studied hard.</i>

336
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:03,190
<i>"They worked hard.</i>

337
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,955
<i>"And they never, ever
played games.</i>

338
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:16,090
<i>"But at night,</i>

339
00:30:17,622 --> 00:30:19,855
<i>"when they were left alone,</i>

340
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:24,855
<i>"their golden dream dust
would fill the room</i>

341
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,655
<i>"and take them far, far away,</i>

342
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:31,222
<i>"and no matter how he tried,</i>

343
00:30:31,256 --> 00:30:33,222
<i>"their keeper
couldn't stop them</i>

344
00:30:33,256 --> 00:30:37,022
<i>"from escaping
into their dreams."</i>

345
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,123
<i>'Cause being a grown-up,</i>

346
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:41,889
<i>he had forgotten
how to dream long ago.</i>

347
00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:48,588
Peter, whatever's the matter
with you?

348
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:52,989
I think I'm getting too old
for bedtime stories, that's all.

349
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:55,022
Good night.

350
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,922
Off to bed.

351
00:31:23,622 --> 00:31:24,722
Peter.

352
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:55,189
<i>I don't want you
to go away.</i>

353
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:19,289
<i>No one will catch me
and make me a man.</i>

354
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:05,089
<i>We'll be
the Lost Boys of the wild.</i>

355
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,755
Catch us if you can!

356
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:18,322
Wait for me!

357
00:33:20,122 --> 00:33:23,889
You'll never catch us!
We're the Lost Boys of the wild!

358
00:33:25,022 --> 00:33:26,688
Wait!

359
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:39,588
Hello?

360
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,289
Hello?

361
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:50,923
Rose?

362
00:33:58,189 --> 00:33:59,655
Mmm.

363
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,189
Rose?

364
00:34:58,755 --> 00:34:59,989
Charlie.

365
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:03,856
Oh, Jack,
I'm sorry about your son.

366
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,089
Deal me in.

367
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:10,856
I said deal me in.

368
00:35:14,022 --> 00:35:15,256
Give me your cards.

369
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:18,156
You too.

370
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,655
Well, you certainly
seem to be enjoying yourself.

371
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,189
What makes you think
you can come in here

372
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:01,222
and play these tables, hmm?

373
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:03,056
My debts were cleared away
years ago.

374
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:04,289
Is that so?

375
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,156
Just had a bad run,
fellas.

376
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:10,688
My luck is bound to turn
in good time.

377
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:15,756
Look, all right.

378
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,922
Give this to that boss of yours.

379
00:36:24,189 --> 00:36:26,756
Tell him he knows
I'm good for it, all right?

380
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:33,156
I'm sure he's gonna love this.

381
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:38,523
Rose?

382
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:42,790
Rose?

383
00:36:42,822 --> 00:36:45,289
Rose,
haven't you heard a word I've said?

384
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:52,822
Actually...

385
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:59,089
I'd like you to come and stay
with William and me for a while.

386
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:01,222
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

387
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:03,289
I just don't understand.

388
00:37:05,922 --> 00:37:08,588
Until you're a mother,
you never will.

389
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:12,289
I see.

390
00:37:15,822 --> 00:37:17,089
Never mind.

391
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:20,855
<i>My mother seemed to be lost.</i>

392
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:25,022
<i>I couldn't reach her.</i>

393
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:29,855
<i>So I reached for a heart
I could touch instead.</i>

394
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:31,922
Would you like some tea?

395
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:37,322
We would be ever so grateful
for the company.

396
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:45,322
Thank you.

397
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:56,989
Oh. Uh.

398
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:28,855
Would you like to see
a real teahouse?

399
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,755
Mmm.
Thank you so much.

400
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:14,122
Are you enjoying yourself?

401
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:17,922
Ah, you have a...

402
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,889
Yes, a little bit
of cream just...

403
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:25,022
A little bit lower.

404
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:30,789
Almost gone.

405
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:34,556
Ah! Isn't this nice?

406
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:40,022
It's a shame we haven't spent
much time together before.

407
00:39:40,056 --> 00:39:42,722
You really are a lovely girl.

408
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,189
I'm not a girl. I'm a lady.

409
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:47,622
Then I think you should know,

410
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:51,022
a lady never rests her elbows
on the table.

411
00:39:55,256 --> 00:40:00,556
A lady also only crosses
her legs at the ankles.

412
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:07,022
Oh, you poor thing.

413
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:09,889
You just want to be brought up
in a civilized manner.

414
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:11,322
Is that not so?

415
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:17,222
You need my help, and my help
is what you're going to get.

416
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:20,688
A lady should never gnaw
on her fingernails.

417
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:23,922
It is a disgusting habit
of the lower class.

418
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:28,222
And just because your father
is from that class,

419
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:31,889
it does not mean
that you have to be too.

420
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:34,322
We will make a lady of you yet.

421
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:44,189
It's perfect.

422
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:47,989
It was the last thing
I promised him.

423
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,289
I know.

424
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:01,622
I have news.

425
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:14,189
Peter, that is wonderful.

426
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,588
Oh, my.

427
00:41:15,622 --> 00:41:17,256
I want to take David's place,

428
00:41:18,755 --> 00:41:20,056
at Bristlemoss.

429
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:22,855
I can make you proud too.

430
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:27,588
Peter, you've always
made us proud.

431
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:33,855
- Stay back.
- No, no, no.

432
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:36,156
I told you
to pay your debt, Littleton!

433
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:40,822
Everyone all right?

434
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:56,688
Rose, I can explain.

435
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,189
We need to send for the police.

436
00:41:58,222 --> 00:42:00,822
No, no. He's got the police
in his pocket.

437
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:03,855
Why? Why?
After all these years?

438
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:06,822
- You know what he's like.
- I'll pay it off.

439
00:42:06,855 --> 00:42:09,189
Once I finish <i>The Golden Hind</i>
for Mr. Brown,

440
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:11,922
we'll have enough
to pay off my debt.

441
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:13,922
- Rose...
- Finish it, then.

442
00:42:13,955 --> 00:42:16,156
- Rose. Rose.
- Finish it. Hannah.

443
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:19,922
Children.

444
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:35,289
What are you doing?

445
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:41,722
Alice, go back to sleep.

446
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:44,722
Peter.

447
00:42:53,189 --> 00:42:56,089
What happened tonight,
the trouble Father's in,

448
00:42:57,722 --> 00:43:00,222
it never would have happened
if David were here.

449
00:43:02,156 --> 00:43:05,588
And if it had, he wouldn't have
stood by and watched.

450
00:43:09,022 --> 00:43:10,189
Wait.

451
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:13,855
I want to help.

452
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:50,889
Alice, get down.

453
00:44:09,156 --> 00:44:11,189
Evening, sweetheart.

454
00:44:11,222 --> 00:44:13,089
Can you spare any pennies?

455
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:16,323
Oh, I've had enough
of this.

456
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:18,089
I'm going for an ale.

457
00:44:23,323 --> 00:44:26,789
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't take any myself.

458
00:44:36,122 --> 00:44:38,122
- Oi! Watch it!
- Go, go, go!

459
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:41,622
- Oi!
- Oi!

460
00:44:41,655 --> 00:44:43,989
- Out of the way!
- Hurry up! He's coming!

461
00:44:44,922 --> 00:44:46,755
Hurry up! Come on!

462
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:52,955
Get back here!
You dirty little vermin!

463
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:55,655
- Run! Go!
- Move, you sop!

464
00:44:57,089 --> 00:44:59,889
Wait till I get my hands on you,
you rats!

465
00:45:02,822 --> 00:45:05,089
Hurry up!
Get out of the way!

466
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:07,622
D'you hear me?
You little scum!

467
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:16,989
Alice, go!

468
00:45:17,822 --> 00:45:19,655
You little toerag!

469
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:34,156
If I get my hands on you...
I'm gonna kill you!

470
00:45:38,755 --> 00:45:40,289
Why are you following us?

471
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:42,289
'Cause of you we lost the loot.

472
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,688
You mean this?

473
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:52,989
Would you happen to know the way
to the pawn shop?

474
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:09,256
This is where we leave you.

475
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:10,755
You're not coming?

476
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:12,190
We've got business at the Row.

477
00:46:21,622 --> 00:46:23,157
How can we repay you?

478
00:46:35,356 --> 00:46:36,822
Hello?

479
00:47:10,688 --> 00:47:11,955
Is anyone there?

480
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:14,022
Children, children!

481
00:47:14,056 --> 00:47:17,855
Games and games,
and what are your names, hmm?

482
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:19,955
- Peter.
- Peter...

483
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:21,622
- Little...
- Pan.

484
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:25,789
Peter Pan and Tiger Lily.

485
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:28,755
Can you answer me a riddle?

486
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:31,090
- I love riddles.
- She loves riddles.

487
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:35,755
How is a raven like...

488
00:47:36,755 --> 00:47:39,090
A writing desk? Hmm?

489
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:41,322
How is a raven
like a writing desk?

490
00:47:41,356 --> 00:47:43,289
How much will you give me
for this?

491
00:47:54,222 --> 00:47:57,256
Must you sell it?

492
00:48:00,822 --> 00:48:04,655
Hmm! Let us all move
one pace on.

493
00:48:33,855 --> 00:48:34,990
Thank you.

494
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:55,555
Alice, look.

495
00:50:09,056 --> 00:50:10,855
What do you have for me?

496
00:50:33,956 --> 00:50:35,722
Have you guessed
the riddle yet?

497
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:38,056
No. What's the answer?

498
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:40,555
I haven't
the slightest idea.

499
00:50:41,156 --> 00:50:42,822
Ooh. May I?

500
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:45,856
Your hair wants cutting.

501
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:46,989
Father!

502
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:54,989
We've got guests.

503
00:50:55,022 --> 00:50:58,822
Customers, yes, yes, we know.

504
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:02,755
What are your names, then?

505
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:05,322
- Peter Pan.
- I'm Tiger Lily.

506
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:07,156
Indeed.

507
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:12,890
And you can call me...

508
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:16,289
CJ.

509
00:51:25,122 --> 00:51:27,588
It's quite
an extraordinary piece.

510
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:31,122
And the inscription is...

511
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:33,755
Somewhat...

512
00:51:36,755 --> 00:51:38,089
Personal.

513
00:51:38,122 --> 00:51:40,555
It was a gift from our father.

514
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:45,089
Complicated, aren't they?

515
00:51:50,922 --> 00:51:52,588
Fathers.

516
00:51:59,056 --> 00:52:01,122
Are you sure you're
willing to part with him?

517
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:03,555
What?

518
00:52:08,955 --> 00:52:13,622
I said are you sure you're
willing to part with it?

519
00:52:13,655 --> 00:52:15,056
We need to sell it.

520
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:28,189
Well, then,

521
00:52:32,022 --> 00:52:33,655
let's do business.

522
00:52:41,256 --> 00:52:44,089
We did it. We really did it.

523
00:52:45,922 --> 00:52:48,823
I can't wait to see Papa's face
in the morning.

524
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:08,322
<i>I've often
wondered when it was</i>

525
00:54:08,356 --> 00:54:11,922
<i>that my brother and I
were set on different paths.</i>

526
00:54:15,122 --> 00:54:17,689
<i>We were wounded
by the same hurts.</i>

527
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,588
Alice, wake up.

528
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:26,789
<i>Soothed by the same lullabies.</i>

529
00:54:29,723 --> 00:54:32,689
<i>Was there a single moment
when we diverged?</i>

530
00:54:58,389 --> 00:55:00,256
You're standing
on my foot!

531
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:14,555
The Lost Boys at your service.
We want you to come with us.

532
00:55:39,688 --> 00:55:41,056
Where did you get this?

533
00:56:41,755 --> 00:56:44,156
Alice, what are you doing?

534
00:56:45,156 --> 00:56:47,722
I told you always to knock.

535
00:56:47,755 --> 00:56:49,122
I'm sorry, Mama.

536
00:56:50,822 --> 00:56:52,556
What does your potion do?

537
00:56:53,655 --> 00:56:57,655
Never you mind.
This is not for children.

538
00:56:57,688 --> 00:57:00,322
It is not ever for children.

539
00:57:00,356 --> 00:57:03,822
I'm not a child.
I'm a young lady.

540
00:57:03,855 --> 00:57:07,022
I know all about
how a lady acts.

541
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:10,989
For instance, nail biting
is unacceptable for a lady.

542
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:13,688
It's a disgusting habit
of the lower class.

543
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:14,688
The lower class?

544
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:17,156
Just because Father
is of that class does not...

545
00:57:19,056 --> 00:57:22,189
Don't you ever speak
of your father that way. Ever!

546
00:57:25,755 --> 00:57:26,989
Go to your room.

547
00:57:42,122 --> 00:57:44,722
<i>Take me away from here,
Tinker Bell.</i>

548
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:48,688
I know you're a real fairy.

549
00:57:48,722 --> 00:57:50,755
You can show yourself to me.

550
00:57:51,156 --> 00:57:52,655
It's safe.

551
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,889
<i>Tink, please.</i>

552
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:19,955
Tink?

553
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:30,822
I'm so sorry, Tink.

554
00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:34,222
<i>Mr. Littleton, sir.</i>

555
00:58:34,256 --> 00:58:36,089
Oh, thank you, Wells.

556
00:58:37,356 --> 00:58:40,755
Jack, good to see you.

557
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:42,655
Mr. Brown.

558
00:58:42,688 --> 00:58:48,322
Uh, please, can I interest you
in some mock turtle soup?

559
00:58:48,356 --> 00:58:50,189
Oh, no. No, thank you, sir.

560
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:52,256
No. Wise man.

561
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:55,889
What can I do for you?

562
00:58:55,922 --> 00:58:58,322
Well, I know it took longer
than we discussed,

563
00:58:58,356 --> 00:59:03,222
but the replica you commissioned
has been completed, sir.

564
00:59:06,722 --> 00:59:10,755
Oh, that is exquisite.

565
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:14,022
Your work never ceases
to impress, Jack.

566
00:59:14,056 --> 00:59:17,089
But this particular replica

567
00:59:17,122 --> 00:59:20,755
was meant as a birthday gift
for my grandson.

568
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,922
Shall I inscribe it, sir?

569
00:59:22,955 --> 00:59:26,955
His birthday
was over a week ago.

570
00:59:26,989 --> 00:59:30,322
I heard word of what happened
to your son. I'm so sorry.

571
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:35,156
I sent Wells to inquire,
but you were never at home.

572
00:59:35,189 --> 00:59:38,955
You see, I had no choice
but to hire...

573
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:42,588
Another craftsman
to do the job.

574
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,955
I'm sure you can understand.

575
00:59:55,122 --> 00:59:56,222
Yes.

576
00:59:59,189 --> 01:00:01,855
Yes, of course.

577
01:00:04,722 --> 01:00:06,722
Thank you, sir.

578
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:23,655
Yes?

579
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:44,855
I'm sorry for what I said.

580
01:01:07,089 --> 01:01:08,622
I slapped Alice.

581
01:01:10,688 --> 01:01:12,222
Rose, how could you?

582
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:15,122
The way she looked at me, Ellie.

583
01:01:19,655 --> 01:01:21,855
I just haven't
been myself since...

584
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:26,322
I just...

585
01:01:26,356 --> 01:01:29,290
I just wanted to hold onto him,
just a little longer.

586
01:01:33,955 --> 01:01:40,322
Now there's everything
with Jack.

587
01:01:40,356 --> 01:01:43,688
What about Jack?
What's happened?

588
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,289
Noth...
I shouldn't have mentioned...

589
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:51,588
I just...

590
01:01:51,622 --> 01:01:54,356
For God's sake, Rose,
stop biting your nails.

591
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:56,622
I haven't seen you bite your
nails since you were a girl.

592
01:01:56,655 --> 01:01:58,257
It's the most disgusting
habit of the lower class

593
01:01:58,289 --> 01:01:59,655
and you know that.

594
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:05,655
And just because Jack
is of that class,

595
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,622
it doesn't mean we have to be.

596
01:02:09,622 --> 01:02:12,156
Is that what you said
to my daughter?

597
01:02:14,655 --> 01:02:16,588
He's her father, Ellie.

598
01:02:16,622 --> 01:02:19,322
Rose, listen to me,
you have to understand...

599
01:02:19,356 --> 01:02:20,655
Rose.

600
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:52,322
I knew he'd leave me a clue.

601
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:19,322
All children have been
to Neverland.

602
01:03:19,356 --> 01:03:22,022
But most of them
lose their Neverlands forever

603
01:03:22,056 --> 01:03:25,322
when they get all...
All growed up.

604
01:03:25,356 --> 01:03:28,123
Their heads get filled
with all kinds of muck.

605
01:03:28,157 --> 01:03:29,655
Like neckties.

606
01:03:30,256 --> 01:03:32,789
And taxidermies.

607
01:03:32,822 --> 01:03:36,022
- Most children?
- Most, but not all.

608
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:38,256
Have you ever heard
of dream dust?

609
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:39,822
<i>Dream dust?</i>

610
01:03:58,688 --> 01:04:03,322
<i>Dream dust is the stuff
that makes us remember.</i>

611
01:04:03,356 --> 01:04:06,588
<i>It's the reason you can
build sandcastles in the sky.</i>

612
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:23,090
<i>Or take a voyage
to the moon.</i>

613
01:04:23,123 --> 01:04:24,755
<i>All right.</i>

614
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:27,022
But what does that
have to do with me?

615
01:04:27,057 --> 01:04:31,057
You have more dream dust
than anyone we've ever seen.

616
01:04:32,123 --> 01:04:34,356
You never have to grow up.

617
01:04:34,389 --> 01:04:37,622
Come to Neverland with us, Pan,
and be a boy forever.

618
01:04:37,655 --> 01:04:39,588
I have to grow up, Nibs.

619
01:04:40,822 --> 01:04:45,655
My family, all their
expectations lie in me now.

620
01:04:45,688 --> 01:04:49,789
Don't you see? It isn't
their expectations inside you.

621
01:04:49,822 --> 01:04:51,256
It's their dreams.

622
01:05:57,688 --> 01:05:59,322
<i>What does your potion do?</i>

623
01:06:06,389 --> 01:06:10,056
Please, potion,
take me away from here.

624
01:06:10,855 --> 01:06:12,256
Make me disappear.

625
01:06:54,688 --> 01:06:55,755
Papa?

626
01:07:16,256 --> 01:07:18,022
Here.

627
01:07:18,056 --> 01:07:20,923
You can use it
to pay off those men.

628
01:07:25,622 --> 01:07:27,156
How did you get this?

629
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:32,923
This is not your burden to bear.

630
01:07:32,955 --> 01:07:35,722
Peter, you're...
You're not to worry.

631
01:07:35,755 --> 01:07:39,189
Don't you understand?
Everything's all right now.

632
01:07:41,322 --> 01:07:44,189
That's what you needed,
and I got it for you.

633
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,890
Where did you get this?

634
01:07:50,955 --> 01:07:52,688
No.

635
01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:00,189
Where did you get this?
Answer me!

636
01:08:02,222 --> 01:08:03,222
Peter.

637
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:05,789
Peter.

638
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:17,189
Peter!

639
01:08:19,022 --> 01:08:20,189
Peter?

640
01:08:22,022 --> 01:08:23,989
Let me take care of this.

641
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:27,823
This is my problem,
not yours.

642
01:08:29,389 --> 01:08:30,789
Peter.

643
01:08:35,156 --> 01:08:36,322
Peter.

644
01:08:39,356 --> 01:08:40,722
Peter?

645
01:08:51,156 --> 01:08:53,056
If you're here, come out.

646
01:08:56,688 --> 01:08:58,688
I want to come with you.

647
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:02,855
<i>The bond between
my brothers was deep and true.</i>

648
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:09,322
<i>But not all brothers
are as lucky,</i>

649
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:14,056
<i>and when fathers
divide their sons...</i>

650
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:16,189
Hello, Father.

651
01:09:16,222 --> 01:09:18,889
<i>...it can
all go terribly wrong.</i>

652
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:19,955
My boy!

653
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:24,756
Oh!

654
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:26,889
James, look here.

655
01:09:28,989 --> 01:09:32,688
This is my son Jack,

656
01:09:32,722 --> 01:09:34,855
home from university.

657
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:37,855
Tell Margaret to come down...

658
01:09:38,922 --> 01:09:40,622
And put the kettle on.

659
01:09:40,655 --> 01:09:42,256
- Come, come, come.
- I'm alright. I'm alright.

660
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:44,622
Sit. Sit.

661
01:09:44,655 --> 01:09:47,555
- He's a bit slow.
- Enough!

662
01:09:51,389 --> 01:09:53,588
I don't have the money, James.

663
01:09:55,723 --> 01:09:56,955
I need more time.

664
01:09:58,922 --> 01:10:01,955
After 12 years,
that's all you have to say?

665
01:10:05,022 --> 01:10:07,889
Have a drink
with your brother, Jack.

666
01:10:07,922 --> 01:10:09,688
We'll discuss business later.

667
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:13,955
Bottoms up.

668
01:10:20,789 --> 01:10:24,655
Your leftover brats,
they're wilier than I expected,

669
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:26,756
for two pampered little toffs.

670
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:31,622
They showed up.
Can you imagine?

671
01:10:31,655 --> 01:10:36,689
Two little mice traipsing
into the mouth of a crocodile.

672
01:10:36,723 --> 01:10:38,622
And you were gentle with 'em.

673
01:10:39,622 --> 01:10:40,723
I appreciate that.

674
01:10:40,756 --> 01:10:42,822
They're my flesh and blood,
Jack.

675
01:10:42,855 --> 01:10:45,989
Not all of us
betray our families.

676
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:50,555
Plus, they came
bearing treasures

677
01:10:51,656 --> 01:10:52,922
from a long forgotten past.

678
01:10:53,789 --> 01:10:55,056
"To our son, with pride."

679
01:10:57,289 --> 01:10:58,889
Touching as ever.

680
01:11:00,822 --> 01:11:04,022
So, right back where we began.

681
01:11:07,755 --> 01:11:09,922
I was a lost man, Father.

682
01:11:10,889 --> 01:11:13,989
I had to get away. I had to.

683
01:11:14,022 --> 01:11:16,822
And yet
here you are again.

684
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:19,555
Perhaps this is where
you always belonged.

685
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:23,755
I'm nothing like you.

686
01:11:25,022 --> 01:11:27,189
Father.

687
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:31,822
Go lay down, Father.

688
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:35,755
Yes. I'll go lay down.

689
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:47,356
I'll get you
the money soon, all right?

690
01:11:47,389 --> 01:11:49,588
The rules never really
did apply to you,

691
01:11:49,623 --> 01:11:51,989
- did they, little Jack?
- I just need some more time.

692
01:11:52,022 --> 01:11:54,089
Always an arrogant
little snob.

693
01:11:54,122 --> 01:11:58,656
I lost my son, James.
I lost my son.

694
01:11:58,688 --> 01:11:59,889
Please.

695
01:12:03,122 --> 01:12:04,289
Please.

696
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:07,589
I'm still your brother.

697
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:14,122
Well, then, brother...

698
01:12:17,389 --> 01:12:19,256
For once in your life,

699
01:12:21,955 --> 01:12:23,755
you shall pay your debt.

700
01:12:34,655 --> 01:12:35,855
<i>Rose!</i>

701
01:12:37,623 --> 01:12:39,556
He crushed my hand.

702
01:12:43,389 --> 01:12:46,156
All I did was
ask for more time.

703
01:12:49,655 --> 01:12:50,955
I'll kill him.

704
01:12:52,222 --> 01:12:53,688
I'll kill him.

705
01:12:55,789 --> 01:12:58,655
Off with his head.

706
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:02,688
<i>Don't you ever speak
of your father that way, ever!</i>

707
01:13:04,289 --> 01:13:05,622
Darling?

708
01:13:07,289 --> 01:13:08,688
Alice?

709
01:13:09,855 --> 01:13:10,955
Leave me alone.

710
01:13:12,122 --> 01:13:14,056
We need
to get a doctor.

711
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:15,822
I'll get the doctor.

712
01:13:19,122 --> 01:13:20,156
Peter.

713
01:13:21,755 --> 01:13:24,122
We've always been alike.

714
01:13:24,156 --> 01:13:27,622
A little bit lighter
than the world will allow.

715
01:13:27,655 --> 01:13:29,822
Don't let life drag you down.

716
01:13:31,722 --> 01:13:36,089
You just keep floating above it,
long as you can.

717
01:13:36,122 --> 01:13:37,322
You promise?

718
01:13:38,822 --> 01:13:42,688
Peter... You promise?

719
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:48,655
I promise.

720
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:03,822
She's upstairs.

721
01:14:12,989 --> 01:14:14,322
Leave me alone.

722
01:14:16,755 --> 01:14:18,688
My mother's not in here.

723
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,289
I didn't come for your mother.

724
01:14:22,655 --> 01:14:23,955
I came for you.

725
01:14:25,389 --> 01:14:26,722
Look.

726
01:14:41,356 --> 01:14:42,789
Rose, darling, how's Jack?

727
01:14:42,822 --> 01:14:45,789
They took
his hand, Eleanor.

728
01:14:46,688 --> 01:14:48,655
He's a craftsman.
He can't work.

729
01:14:48,688 --> 01:14:50,755
I want you to know
that William and I

730
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:53,056
will do anything we can
to help you

731
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,722
until Jack
is back on his feet again.

732
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:57,722
Under one condition.

733
01:14:58,789 --> 01:15:01,222
Alice comes with me.

734
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,056
Get out.

735
01:15:07,089 --> 01:15:08,922
I'll raise her properly, Rose,

736
01:15:08,955 --> 01:15:12,855
see that she's well-groomed
and well married.

737
01:15:12,889 --> 01:15:14,655
Leave my house.

738
01:15:16,822 --> 01:15:18,222
Even if I do,

739
01:15:19,755 --> 01:15:22,688
I can't promise
that she'll stay away from me.

740
01:15:22,722 --> 01:15:25,855
You see, darling,
it was Alice that suggested it.

741
01:15:29,822 --> 01:15:30,922
Leave.

742
01:15:32,622 --> 01:15:34,922
- Get out, Eleanor.
- Rose.

743
01:15:34,955 --> 01:15:36,256
Get out.

744
01:15:37,655 --> 01:15:39,755
It's for the best.

745
01:15:39,789 --> 01:15:41,989
You will see
it's for the best.

746
01:15:52,289 --> 01:15:54,189
What's that?

747
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:03,722
I thought you might like
to have your things up here.

748
01:16:07,357 --> 01:16:08,822
Here, let me help.

749
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:10,989
No, no, no. Peter.

750
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:21,089
It's over now.

751
01:16:22,122 --> 01:16:24,889
No one
is going to bother us now.

752
01:16:24,922 --> 01:16:26,889
Not my brother, not anyone.

753
01:16:29,222 --> 01:16:30,256
It's over.

754
01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:32,822
It's over.

755
01:16:46,688 --> 01:16:48,822
CJ did that to Father, Alice.

756
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:50,655
- He's our uncle.
- What?

757
01:16:50,688 --> 01:16:52,588
CJ's our uncle.

758
01:16:53,855 --> 01:16:55,955
Our own family did this to us.

759
01:16:55,989 --> 01:16:57,688
Let go of me.

760
01:16:59,056 --> 01:17:00,822
He's going to pay,

761
01:17:01,889 --> 01:17:03,755
and I know how, too.

762
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,290
No, Peter, you can't.

763
01:17:09,323 --> 01:17:11,655
They'll come after you.

764
01:17:11,688 --> 01:17:16,156
Which is why I won't be able
to come back. Not ever.

765
01:17:17,889 --> 01:17:19,555
Come with me.

766
01:17:29,989 --> 01:17:31,855
I'm going to live
with Aunt Eleanor.

767
01:17:31,889 --> 01:17:33,156
Aunt Eleanor?

768
01:17:34,655 --> 01:17:36,989
She'll turn you into a lady.

769
01:17:37,022 --> 01:17:40,189
You won't be able to play
or make up stories.

770
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,688
It's time for me to grow up.

771
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:54,889
And this tinker's bell
was born for you.

772
01:18:54,755 --> 01:18:57,588
<i>The Red Queen does not
tolerate disobedience.</i>

773
01:18:57,622 --> 01:18:59,089
<i>Off with your head.</i>

774
01:19:00,322 --> 01:19:03,289
<i>We will make a lady
of you yet.</i>

775
01:19:08,688 --> 01:19:09,755
Alice!

776
01:19:16,389 --> 01:19:18,722
It's not time to grow up, Alice.

777
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,889
It never is.

778
01:19:24,755 --> 01:19:26,157
Peter?

779
01:19:27,157 --> 01:19:28,622
You'll see.

780
01:19:42,688 --> 01:19:44,722
<i>I shall be too late.</i>

781
01:20:02,622 --> 01:20:05,955
<i>Long ago, in a faraway land,</i>

782
01:20:08,256 --> 01:20:10,123
<i>there was a family.</i>

783
01:20:11,955 --> 01:20:15,090
<i>By day, the children did
as they were told,</i>

784
01:20:20,356 --> 01:20:24,289
<i>and in the innermost places
of their hearts,</i>

785
01:20:24,322 --> 01:20:27,755
<i>they worried about
what it might mean to grow up.</i>

786
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:48,922
<i>But at night, when their
hearts lay still and sleeping,</i>

787
01:20:50,955 --> 01:20:54,090
<i>their golden dream dust
filled the room</i>

788
01:20:55,057 --> 01:20:58,622
<i>and took them far, far away.</i>

789
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:33,622
Come home.

790
01:22:00,057 --> 01:22:02,222
Catch me if you can.

791
01:23:33,622 --> 01:23:36,755
<i>I was
only a visitor in Wonderland.</i>

792
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,956
<i>Take care of Peter, Tink.</i>

793
01:23:43,655 --> 01:23:47,022
<i>But Peter
was born to be Pan.</i>

794
01:23:59,089 --> 01:24:01,022
It's brilliant.

795
01:24:17,289 --> 01:24:19,588
Oh, my baby.

796
01:24:28,622 --> 01:24:30,890
- I love you.
- I love you too.

797
01:25:07,655 --> 01:25:10,789
<i>We always knew
when he'd been to visit...</i>

798
01:25:13,356 --> 01:25:16,655
<i>Because he'd leave us
a piece of his adventures.</i>

799
01:25:32,722 --> 01:25:33,955
Rose?

800
01:25:36,389 --> 01:25:38,022
<i>The world fresh</i>

801
01:25:38,056 --> 01:25:41,555
<i>and full of possibilities
once again.</i>

802
01:25:49,356 --> 01:25:53,322
"For he comes, human child

803
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:55,855
"To the woods and waters wild

804
01:25:56,688 --> 01:25:59,922
"With a faery, hand in hand

805
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:04,122
"for the world's more full of
weeping than he can understand."

806
01:26:13,955 --> 01:26:16,189
Mama, what's wrong?

807
01:26:22,256 --> 01:26:23,756
Nothing, Wendy.

808
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:26,922
Nothing at all.

809
01:26:29,688 --> 01:26:31,189
You look lovely, Alice.

810
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:04,089
<i>I don't remember
the way to the rabbit hole,</i>

811
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:10,022
<i>or the smell
of Neverland's shores...</i>

812
01:27:26,256 --> 01:27:28,689
<i>But because of my brothers,</i>

813
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:34,689
<i>I haven't forgotten
how to dream.</i>
