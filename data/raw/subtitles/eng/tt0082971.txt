1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,511
The Hovitos are near.

3
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,140
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

4
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,808
They're following us.

5
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,813
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

6
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,401
This is it.

7
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,069
This is where Forrestal
cashed in.

8
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,404
A friend of yours?

9
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,405
A competitor.

10
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,782
He was good.

11
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,409
He was very, very good.

12
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,371
Señor... nobody's
come out of there alive.

13
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,415
Please...

14
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,661
Señor.

15
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,941
Stop.

16
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,027
Stay out of the light.

17
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,760
Forrestal.

18
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,766
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

19
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,604
That's what scares me.

20
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,458
Stay here.

21
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,501
If you insist, señor.

22
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,047
Give me the whip.

23
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,382
Throw me the idol.

24
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,219
No time to argue.

25
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,555
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

26
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,056
Give me the whip!

27
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,766
Adios, señor.

28
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,895
Adios, Satipo.

29
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,770
Dr. Jones.

30
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,690
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess

31
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,400
which I cannot take away.

32
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,610
And you thought I had given up.

33
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,790
You chose the wrong friends.

34
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,126
This time, it will cost you.

35
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,338
Too bad the Hovitos...

36
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,675
don't know you the way I do,
Belloq.

37
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,301
Yes, too bad.

38
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,512
You could warn them,

39
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,223
if only you spoke Hovitos.

40
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,396
Jock! Start the engines!

41
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,106
Get it up!

42
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,780
Jock, the engines!

43
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,115
Start the engines, Jock!

44
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,042
There's a big snake
in the plane, Jock!

45
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,920
Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!

46
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,256
I hate snakes, Jock!

47
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,424
I hate 'em!

48
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,844
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

49
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,653
"Neo," meaning "new"

50
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:02,323
and "lithic"...l- T-H...

51
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,118
...l- C, meaning "stone."

52
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,786
All right, let's get back
to this site:

53
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,122
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

54
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:14,336
Contains a central pas-passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

55
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:22,719
...don't confuse that with
robbing, in which case we mean

56
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,764
the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

57
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,724
This site also demonstrates...

58
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,312
...one of the great dangers
of archaeology...

59
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,565
not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place...

60
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,026
no, I'm talking about folklore.

61
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,819
In this case,
local tradition held

62
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,364
that there was golden coffin
buried at the site,

63
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,992
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow

64
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,912
and the generally poor condition
of the find.

65
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,915
However, chamber three
was undisturbed,

66
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,000
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods

67
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,502
that were found in another, uh...

68
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,879
in the area, give us a r...

69
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,548
Uh...

70
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,636
...reason to da...
to, uh, to-to date this,

71
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,346
uh, find as we have.

72
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,389
Um...

73
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,392
Any questions, then?

74
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,227
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

75
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,561
Um, don't forget...

76
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:18,483
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

77
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,652
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

78
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,747
I had it, Marcus.

79
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,416
I had it in my hand.

80
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,750
What happened?

81
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,419
Guess.

82
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,713
Belloq?

83
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,880
You want to hear about it?

84
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,340
Not at all.

85
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,342
I'm sure everything you do
for the museum

86
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,094
conforms to
the International Treaty

87
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,554
for the Protection
of Antiquities.

88
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,097
It's beautiful, Marcus.

89
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,098
I can get it.

90
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,224
I got it all figured out.

91
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,892
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

92
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,060
I need $2,000. Look...

93
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,061
Listen to me, old boy.

94
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,521
I brought some people
to see you.

95
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,522
Look.

96
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,690
I got these pieces.

97
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,275
They're good pieces, Marcus.

98
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,402
- Look.
- Indiana...

99
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:05,405
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

100
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,032
Yes, they are nice.
They're worth at least

101
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,450
the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.

102
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,701
But the people
I brought are important,

103
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:10,702
and they're waiting.

104
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,703
What people?

105
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,621
Army Intelligence.

106
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,206
They knew you were coming
before I did.

107
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,541
Seem to know everything.

108
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,585
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

109
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,129
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

110
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,756
What am l, in trouble?

111
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,007
Yes, Dr. Jones,

112
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,550
we've heard a great deal
about you.

113
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,427
Have you?

114
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,679
Uh, professor of archaeology,

115
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,222
expert on the occult,

116
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,433
and, uh, how does one say it?

117
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,102
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

118
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,145
That's one way of saying it.

119
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,146
Why don't you sit down?

120
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,147
You'll be more comfortable.

121
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,231
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

122
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,610
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

123
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,029
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

124
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,781
at the University of Chicago.

125
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,824
Yes, I did.

126
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,619
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

127
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,830
Uh... well, just rumors, really.

128
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,582
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

129
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,292
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

130
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,960
We were friends, but, uh...

131
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,922
had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

132
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,465
Mmm.

133
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,093
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

134
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,262
that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

135
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,263
I understand.

136
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,474
Uh...

137
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:18,103
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

138
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,939
intercepted a...
a German communiqué

139
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,985
- Now, to Cairo...
- See, over the last two years,

140
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,821
the Nazis have had teams
of archaeologists

141
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:28,947
running around the world

142
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,200
Iooking for all kinds
of religious artifacts.

143
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,618
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

144
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,619
He's crazy.

145
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,746
He's obsessed with the occult.

146
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,707
And, right now, apparently,

147
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,084
there's some kind
of German archaeological dig

148
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,585
going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

149
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,879
Now, we've got some
information here,

150
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,507
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

151
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,386
"Tanis development proceeding.

152
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:55,724
"Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

153
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,144
Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

154
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,438
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

155
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,774
Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?

156
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,817
Well, it...

157
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,277
The city of Tanis
is one of the possible

158
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,403
resting places of the Lost Ark.

159
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,071
The Lost Ark?

160
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,448
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

161
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,574
The chest the Hebrews used

162
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,075
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

163
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,577
What do you mean,
"commandments"?

164
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,078
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

165
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,663
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

166
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:19,956
The original stone tablets

167
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,709
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

168
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,253
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

169
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,672
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

170
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,673
Well, I...

171
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:29,716
Oh, look.

172
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,384
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

173
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,635
and put them in the Ark.

174
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,012
When they settled in Canaan,

175
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,556
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

176
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,599
In Jerusalem.

177
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,309
Where it stayed for many years.

178
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,728
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

179
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,729
Where?

180
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,689
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

181
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,608
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

182
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,734
- Shishak.
- Yes.

183
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,570
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

184
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,615
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

185
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,617
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

186
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,118
called the Well of Souls.

187
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,620
Secret chamber?

188
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,246
However, about a year

189
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,749
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

190
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,002
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

191
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,089
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

192
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,758
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

193
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:14,886
Uh-huh.

194
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,347
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

195
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,973
Now you seem to know, uh,

196
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,183
all about this Tanis, then.

197
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,935
No, no, not really.

198
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,604
Ravenwood is the real expert.

199
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,106
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

200
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,692
Collected some of its relics.

201
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,444
It was his obsession, really.

202
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,071
But he never found the city.

203
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,533
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

204
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,243
An American being mentioned
so prominently

205
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,537
in a secret Nazi cable.

206
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,579
Oh, rubbish.

207
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,956
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

208
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,916
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

209
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,085
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

210
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,129
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

211
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,797
and they think Abner's got it.

212
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,300
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

213
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,760
Well, the staff
is just a stick...

214
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,053
I don't know, about this big,

215
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,763
nobody really knows
for sure how high...

216
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,808
and it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

217
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,561
with an elaborate headpiece...

218
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,647
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

219
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,399
And what you did was

220
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,901
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...

221
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,361
a map room with a miniature

222
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,071
of the city all laid out
on the floor...

223
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,365
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

224
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:20,160
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

225
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,079
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

226
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:27,083
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

227
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,045
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

228
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,546
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

229
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,674
What does this Ark look like?

230
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,092
Uh...

231
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,053
There's a picture of it
right here.

232
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,434
That's it.

233
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,359
Good God.

234
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,903
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

235
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,112
Uh...

236
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,698
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

237
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,742
Lightning...

238
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,786
fire...

239
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,913
power of God or something.

240
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,874
I'm beginning to understand

241
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,125
Hitler's interest in this.

242
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,877
Oh, yes.

243
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,837
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

244
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:16,383
and laying waste
to entire regions.

245
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:20,553
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

246
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,805
is invincible.

247
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,078
You did it, didn't you?

248
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,663
They want you to go for it.

249
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,165
Oh, Marcus!

250
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,918
They want you to get ahold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

251
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,170
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

252
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,422
And the museum?

253
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,798
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

254
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,216
Oh, yes.

255
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,262
Oh...

256
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,848
The Ark of the Covenant.

257
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,600
Nothing else has come close.

258
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,102
That thing represents everything

259
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,312
we got into archaeology
for in the first place.

260
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,275
Mmm!

261
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,319
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

262
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,572
I'm really rather envious.

263
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,990
I've got to locate Abner.

264
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,742
I think I know where to start.

265
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,124
Suppose she'll
still be with him?

266
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,500
Possibly, but...

267
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,253
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

268
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,963
believe me, Indy.

269
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,007
What do you mean?

270
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,135
Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years,

271
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,055
man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.

272
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:49,934
Not something to be taken
lightly.

273
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:53,980
No one knows its secrets.

274
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:57,400
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

275
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,819
Oh, Marcus.

276
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,112
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

277
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,113
You sound like my mother.

278
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,615
We've known each other
for a long time.

279
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,616
I don't believe in magic,

280
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,785
a lot of superstitious
hocus-pocus.

281
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:07,952
I'm going after a find

282
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,954
of incredible
historical significance.

283
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,790
You're talking
about the bogeyman.

284
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:15,001
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

285
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,055
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

286
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,056
Thank you.

287
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,048
Shh... shh...

288
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,859
Shh...

289
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,684
Give him space!
Give him space!

290
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,185
Go on, Regan!

291
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,272
Shh! Shh!

292
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,774
Shh! Shh! Shh!

293
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,904
Hello, Marion.

294
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:38,621
Indiana Jones.

295
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,208
Always knew, someday,

296
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,711
you'd come walking back
through my door.

297
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,838
I never doubted that.

298
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,132
Something made it inevitable.

299
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,093
So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?

300
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:55,138
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

301
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,974
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

302
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,769
I never meant to hurt you.

303
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,020
I was a child.

304
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,271
I was in love.

305
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,190
It was wrong and you knew it!

306
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,524
You knew what you were doing.

307
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,067
Now I do!

308
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:08,276
This is my place.

309
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,402
Get out!

310
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,490
I did what I did.

311
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,949
You don't have to be happy
about it,

312
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,743
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

313
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,039
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

314
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,290
Bronze piece, about this size,

315
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,292
with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.

316
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,460
You know the one I mean?

317
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,462
Yeah.

318
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,755
I know it.

319
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:29,839
Where's Abner?

320
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,801
Where's Abner?

321
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,094
Abner's dead.

322
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,893
Marion, I'm sorry.

323
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,896
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

324
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,440
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.

325
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,275
Well, say it again, anyway.

326
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,360
Sorry.

327
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,112
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

328
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,073
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth

329
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,117
Iooking
for his little bits of junk.

330
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,536
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

331
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,247
Everybody's sorry for something.

332
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,290
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

333
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:05,625
You going to give it to me?

334
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:06,751
Maybe.

335
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,586
I don't know where it is.

336
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,090
Well, maybe you could find it.

337
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,634
3,000 bucks.

338
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:18,513
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

339
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,433
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

340
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,643
It's important, Marion.

341
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,812
Trust me.

342
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,857
You know the piece I mean?

343
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,567
Do you know where it is?

344
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,530
Come back tomorrow.

345
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,699
Why?

346
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:41,536
Because I said so, that's why.

347
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,336
Ha!

348
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,504
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

349
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,199
Good evening, Fraulein.

350
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,410
The bar's closed.

351
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:06,496
We... We are...

352
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,498
not thirsty.

353
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,916
What do you want?

354
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,961
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

355
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,588
Surely he told you
there would be

356
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,257
other interested parties.

357
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,843
Must've slipped his mind.

358
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:23,513
The man is... nefarious.

359
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:27,851
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

360
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,186
Why, are you willing
to offer more?

361
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,189
Oh, almost certainly.

362
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,066
Do you still have it?

363
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,240
No.

364
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:45,160
But I know where it is.

365
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:49,039
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

366
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:54,085
Your fire is dying here.

367
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,880
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

368
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,090
Listen, Herr Mac...

369
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:03,845
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

370
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:06,348
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

371
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,809
Fraulein Ravenwood,

372
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:13,688
let me show you
what I am used to.

373
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:19,194
Take your hands off me!

374
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,156
Take your lousy hands off!

375
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:30,580
Wait a minute.

376
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:31,956
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

377
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,250
That time is passed.

378
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,960
You don't need that.

379
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,047
Wait...

380
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,175
I'll tell you everything.

381
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:46,554
Yes, I know you will.

382
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,353
Let her go.

383
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:09,346
Whiskey.

384
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,939
Shoot them.

385
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,733
Shoot them both.

386
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,081
My medallion!

387
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,299
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten

388
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:30,135
how to show a lady a good time!

389
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,803
Boy, you're something!

390
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:32,971
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

391
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,973
Until I get back my $5,000,

392
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,142
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

393
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:40,353
I'm your goddamn partner!

394
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,893
Cairo, city of the living.

395
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,686
A paradise on earth.

396
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:24,689
Silence!

397
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:26,274
Why do you forget yourselves?

398
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:27,359
What is this?

399
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,903
Where did this animal come from?

400
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,324
Oh... oh, no.

401
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,370
Cute.

402
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,413
What an adorable creature.

403
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,542
Then it shall be welcome
in our house.

404
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,128
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

405
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,514
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

406
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:59,641
You're the best digger in Egypt.

407
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:03,353
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

408
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:06,648
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

409
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,441
The excavation is enormous.

410
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:12,487
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

411
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,740
It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.

412
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:17,450
When did they find the map room?

413
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,119
Three days ago.

414
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,079
They have not one brain
among them.

415
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,498
Except one.

416
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,625
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.

417
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,337
What's his name?

418
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:30,714
They call him "Bellosh."

419
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:40,056
Belloq. Belloq.

420
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,934
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

421
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:46,146
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

422
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:50,650
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

423
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:53,403
Who can tell us
about these markings?

424
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:58,658
Perhaps a man I know
can help us.

425
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,578
Indy...

426
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:06,166
there is something
that troubles me.

427
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:09,210
What is it?

428
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,296
The Ark.

429
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,673
If it is there, at Tanis,

430
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:17,052
then it is something that man
was not meant to disturb.

431
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:20,096
Death has always surrounded it.

432
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,515
It is not of this earth.

433
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:24,309
Do we need the monkey, huh?

434
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:25,685
I'm surprised at you, Jones...

435
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:28,355
talking that way about our baby.

436
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,023
He's got your looks, too.

437
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:31,107
And your brains.

438
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,068
Oops!

439
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:34,194
I noticed that.

440
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:36,821
She's a smart little thing...
smart.

441
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:40,784
Hey!

442
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:42,077
Hey, where you going?

443
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,870
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

444
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:49,000
Come on. Come on.

445
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:50,001
Okay...

446
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,002
Marion.

447
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:52,045
What's this?

448
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:53,505
It's a date.

449
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,048
You eat 'em.

450
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,307
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,

451
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,309
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

452
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,436
Who says I haven't?

453
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,605
I do.

454
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,607
Dad had you figured
a long time ago.

455
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,160
He said you were a bum.

456
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:06,661
Oh, he's being generous.

457
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:08,747
The most gifted bum
he ever trained.

458
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,707
You know, he loved you
like a son.

459
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,751
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

460
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:13,960
Not much, just you.

461
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:33,313
Marion, get out of here!

462
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,356
Duck!

463
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,024
Right.

464
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,360
Shh! Shh!

465
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:09,909
Marion!

466
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,140
Help! Over here, Indy!

467
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:33,892
Get out of the way!

468
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,352
Move! Move it!

469
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:37,937
Help me!

470
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,694
You can't do this to me!

471
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:46,613
I'm an American!

472
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:48,448
Indy!

473
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,703
Indiana Jones!

474
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,080
Help me, Jones!

475
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:16,893
Jones!

476
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:17,936
Marion!

477
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:23,817
Indy!

478
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,318
Marion...

479
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,775
Dr. Jones.

480
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:14,886
You looking for me?

481
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,438
Belloq.

482
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,981
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

483
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:28,983
I ought to kill you right now.

484
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:31,611
Not a very private place
for a murder.

485
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,490
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

486
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:38,702
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

487
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:41,663
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

488
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:43,790
Please, sit down
before you fall down.

489
00:43:43,873 --> 00:43:46,459
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

490
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,514
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

491
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:02,642
How odd that it should end
this way for us,

492
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,645
after so many
stimulating encounters.

493
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:07,522
I almost regret it.

494
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:09,107
Where shall I find
a new adversary

495
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,109
so close to my own level?

496
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:13,194
Try the local sewer.

497
00:44:15,697 --> 00:44:18,658
You and I are very much alike.

498
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:21,119
Archaeology is our religion,

499
00:44:21,202 --> 00:44:25,707
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

500
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,127
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

501
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,672
I am a shadowy
reflection of you.

502
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:35,550
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me,

503
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:37,719
to push you out of the light.

504
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:41,389
Now you're getting nasty.

505
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:43,600
You know it's true.

506
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:45,518
How nice.

507
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,562
Look at this.

508
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:49,439
It's worthless.

509
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,858
Ten dollars
from a vendor in the street.

510
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,068
But I take it,

511
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:54,778
I bury it in the sand
for a thousand years,

512
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:58,656
it becomes priceless...
like the Ark.

513
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,533
Men will kill for it.

514
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:03,286
Men like you and me.

515
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,414
What about your boss,
der Fuehrer?

516
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:10,001
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

517
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:12,712
All in good time.

518
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:15,256
When I am finished with it.

519
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:18,885
Jones, do you realize
what the Ark is?

520
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:20,929
It's a transmitter.

521
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,765
It's a radio
for speaking to God.

522
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:25,433
And it's within my reach.

523
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:30,980
You want to talk to God?

524
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,857
Let's go see Him together.

525
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,734
I've got nothing better to do.

526
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,488
Uncle Indy, come back home now!

527
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:41,491
Uncle Indy!

528
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:44,327
Next time, Indiana Jones,

529
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:46,996
it'll take more than children
to save you.

530
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,791
Uncle Indy!

531
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:05,432
I thought I would
find you there.

532
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:07,726
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?

533
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,486
Marion's dead.

534
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:19,779
Yes, I know.

535
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:21,990
And me! And me!

536
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:23,658
I'm sorry.

537
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:25,452
Life goes on, Indy.

538
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,328
There is the proof.

539
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,291
Uh-oh.

540
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:32,709
I have much to tell you.

541
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,462
First we will take them home,

542
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:37,005
and then I will take you
to the old man.

543
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:30,266
I can't figure out
how Belloq did it.

544
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,769
Where'd he get a copy
of the headpiece?

545
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:36,106
There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.

546
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:39,109
I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes:

547
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:40,568
A headpiece like that one,

548
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,862
except round the edges,
which were rougher.

549
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:44,989
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,

550
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:49,911
and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,

551
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:51,663
there were raised markings,
just like that one.

552
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:56,418
They made their calculations
in the map room?

553
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,877
This morning.

554
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:00,255
Belloq and the boss German,
Dietrich.

555
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:02,924
When they came out
of the map room,

556
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:05,260
they gave us a new spot
in which to dig,

557
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:08,054
out away from the camp.

558
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:10,098
The Well of the Souls, huh?

559
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:14,102
Come, come, look.
Look here... look.

560
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:15,687
Sit down.

561
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,272
Come, sit down.

562
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:19,274
What is it?

563
00:48:19,357 --> 00:48:21,568
This is a warning

564
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:24,070
not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant.

565
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:25,739
What about the height
of the staff, though?

566
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,906
Did Belloq get it off of here?

567
00:48:26,948 --> 00:48:27,907
Yes.

568
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:29,367
It is here.

569
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:31,286
This were the old way,

570
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:33,788
this mean six kadam high.

571
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:35,040
- About 72 inches.
- Wait!

572
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:41,463
"And take back one kadam

573
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:45,425
to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is."

574
00:48:57,645 --> 00:48:59,606
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

575
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,441
Are you absolutely sure?

576
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:05,153
Belloq's staff is too long.

577
00:49:05,236 --> 00:49:07,989
They're digging
in the wrong place.

578
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,827
I am the monarch of the sea

579
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:14,788
I am the ruler of the...

580
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:27,342
Bad dates.

581
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:44,651
I told you not to be premature

582
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:47,070
in your communiqué to Berlin.

583
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:50,448
Archaeology is not
an exact science.

584
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,659
It does not deal
in time schedules.

585
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,703
The fuehrer is not
a patient man.

586
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:58,206
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

587
00:49:58,289 --> 00:49:59,791
You led me to believe...

588
00:49:59,874 --> 00:50:01,292
Nothing!
I made no promises.

589
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:03,336
I only said
it looked very favorable.

590
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,673
Besides, with the information
in our possession,

591
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:08,675
my calculations were correct.

592
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:10,552
Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?

593
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,389
What time does the sun
hit the map room?

594
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:16,474
At about 9:00 in the morning.

595
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:17,684
Not much time, then.

596
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,562
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

597
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:23,898
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

598
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:25,275
Let's go, come on.

599
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:33,523
Sallah.

600
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:36,401
Sallah!

601
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,201
They're here.

602
00:54:56,254 --> 00:54:57,714
Please, my friend,
what is the matter?

603
00:54:57,756 --> 00:54:59,424
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

604
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:04,220
If you want water,
I will get you water.

605
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:05,597
No problem, no problem.

606
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:20,987
I thought you were dead.

607
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,822
You must have switched baskets.

608
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:28,453
Are you hurt?

609
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:31,206
No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.

610
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:33,583
They're gonna be back
at any minute.

611
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:34,584
Cut me loose.

612
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:35,627
Quick.

613
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,213
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

614
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:44,344
What's wrong?

615
00:55:44,427 --> 00:55:45,345
Cut me loose.

616
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:46,805
I know where the Ark is, Marion.

617
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:49,140
The Ark's here?

618
00:55:49,182 --> 00:55:50,809
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!

619
00:55:50,892 --> 00:55:52,227
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!

620
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,353
If I take you out of here now,

621
00:55:53,436 --> 00:55:54,896
they'll start combing
the place for us.

622
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:56,398
Jones, you've got to get me
out of here!

623
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:59,150
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?!

624
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:00,652
Marion, I hate to do this,

625
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:03,279
but if you don't sit
still and keep quiet,

626
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:05,699
this whole thing
is going to be shot.

627
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:08,785
I'll be back to get you.

628
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:10,578
Jones, what's the matter?

629
00:56:56,207 --> 00:56:57,834
That's it.

630
00:56:57,876 --> 00:56:59,002
Who knows?

631
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:01,046
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting

632
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:03,590
in some antechamber
for us to discover.

633
00:57:03,673 --> 00:57:07,552
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

634
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:08,553
Perhaps...

635
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:10,305
Perhaps the girl can help us.

636
00:57:10,388 --> 00:57:11,723
My feeling exactly.

637
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:14,893
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

638
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:17,354
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

639
00:57:17,395 --> 00:57:19,898
I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.

640
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:22,942
I'm surprised
to find you squeamish.

641
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:24,527
That is not your reputation.

642
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:25,987
But it needn't concern you.

643
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:28,531
I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.

644
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,538
Heil Hitler.

645
00:58:57,912 --> 00:58:59,164
Indy! Here!

646
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:01,166
We've hit stone!

647
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:05,795
Clear it off.

648
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,255
Come on, find the edges.

649
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:25,815
Good, good, good.

650
00:59:25,857 --> 00:59:27,442
You see, Indy? You see?

651
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:29,402
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

652
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,237
As a team, boys! As a team!

653
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:34,199
Push!

654
00:59:39,537 --> 00:59:40,663
Get 'em in there.

655
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:41,706
Get 'em under.

656
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:42,707
Good, good, that's it.

657
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:43,708
Watch your toes.

658
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:53,051
Carefully, carefully!

659
01:00:04,187 --> 01:00:06,731
Sorry, Indy.

660
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:10,110
Indy...

661
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:12,862
why does the floor move?

662
01:00:14,197 --> 01:00:16,282
Give me your torch.

663
01:00:46,604 --> 01:00:48,565
Snakes.

664
01:00:48,606 --> 01:00:49,941
Why did it have to be snakes?

665
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:56,614
Asps.

666
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:59,284
Very dangerous.

667
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,410
You go first.

668
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:22,015
If you're trying
to escape on foot,

669
01:01:22,098 --> 01:01:25,352
the desert is three weeks
in every direction,

670
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,312
so please, eat something.

671
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,446
I must apologize
for their treatment of you.

672
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:37,655
Yeah. Whose idea was it?

673
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:38,823
No food, no water.

674
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:41,117
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

675
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:44,120
At this particular time
and place, to do my work,

676
01:01:44,162 --> 01:01:46,081
they are necessary evils.

677
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:47,624
They're not my friends.

678
01:01:47,665 --> 01:01:49,918
However, with the
right connections,

679
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,920
even in this part of the world,

680
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:55,006
we are not entirely uncivilized.

681
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:58,593
It's beautiful.

682
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:01,179
I would very much like
to see you in it.

683
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:05,350
I'll bet you would.

684
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:11,272
All right.

685
01:02:19,197 --> 01:02:21,282
What do you got to drink
around here?

686
01:02:24,035 --> 01:02:26,162
We don't have much time.

687
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:27,247
Soon they will come to harm you,

688
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:28,206
Soon they will come to harm you,

689
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:30,250
and I will not be able
to stop them,

690
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,836
unless you are able
to give me something

691
01:02:32,877 --> 01:02:34,838
to placate them.

692
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:37,841
Some, uh, piece
of information...

693
01:02:37,882 --> 01:02:40,677
which I can use
to protect you from them.

694
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:42,971
I've already told you
everything I know.

695
01:02:43,054 --> 01:02:45,765
I have no loyalty to Jones.

696
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:48,351
He's brought me
nothing but trouble.

697
01:02:54,774 --> 01:02:56,776
Marion, you are beautiful.

698
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,993
I don't think
we need a chaperone.

699
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,539
Steadily.

700
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:11,583
Steadily. Whoa!

701
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:14,919
Down...

702
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:16,087
Down... Whoa.

703
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:17,213
Carefully, carefully!

704
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:19,591
You all right, Indy?

705
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:27,140
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!

706
01:03:35,398 --> 01:03:36,149
Whoa...

707
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:47,452
I told you it will be all right.

708
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:05,595
Huh...

709
01:04:13,728 --> 01:04:15,647
Sallah, get down here!

710
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:36,835
You pour.

711
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,200
Oh, that's good.

712
01:06:35,453 --> 01:06:36,871
Whoops.

713
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:44,754
What is this stuff, Rene?

714
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:48,008
I grew up with this.

715
01:06:49,592 --> 01:06:51,177
It's my family label.

716
01:07:20,498 --> 01:07:23,960
Well... I have to be
going now, Rene.

717
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:28,923
I like you, Rene, very much.

718
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:31,634
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

719
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:38,141
We meet again, Fraulein.

720
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:42,062
You Americans,
you're all the same.

721
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:47,317
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

722
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:20,141
Now...

723
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:25,355
what shall we talk about?

724
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:45,977
All right... take it up!

725
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:48,063
Easy!

726
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:51,399
You're as stubborn as that girl.

727
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:54,110
You like her too much, I think.

728
01:09:54,152 --> 01:09:58,823
Your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me.

729
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:02,952
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... China cup.

730
01:10:07,415 --> 01:10:09,209
Shliemann! Wake your men!

731
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:11,461
Indy, the torches
are burning out.

732
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:13,463
Go on, get out of here.

733
01:10:13,505 --> 01:10:15,340
Hyah!

734
01:10:33,191 --> 01:10:34,359
Sallah!

735
01:10:34,442 --> 01:10:35,443
Hello!

736
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:37,404
Hello!

737
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:40,073
Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing

738
01:10:40,156 --> 01:10:42,659
in such a nasty place?

739
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:44,703
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!

740
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:45,829
Thank you, my friend,

741
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:48,289
but I think we are all
very comfortable up here.

742
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:49,624
That's right, isn't it?

743
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:53,044
Yes, we are very comfortable
up here.

744
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:56,381
So, once again, Jones,

745
01:10:56,464 --> 01:10:59,592
what was briefly yours
is now mine.

746
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,178
What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.

747
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,723
You're about to become
a permanent addition

748
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:06,391
to this archaeological find.

749
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:07,726
Who knows?

750
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:10,061
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

751
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:14,107
Son of a bitch.

752
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,067
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

753
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:18,445
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

754
01:11:18,528 --> 01:11:20,447
But I do not wish to leave you

755
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:22,866
down in that awful place
all alone.

756
01:11:22,907 --> 01:11:24,743
Slimy pig, you let me go!

757
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:25,910
Stop it!

758
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:30,206
Marion!

759
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,249
Hang on.

760
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:33,585
Don't...

761
01:11:33,668 --> 01:11:35,253
- Indy!
- Don't fall!

762
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:37,672
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!

763
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:43,636
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!

764
01:11:51,603 --> 01:11:52,687
Snakes!

765
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:55,607
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!

766
01:11:57,275 --> 01:11:58,443
The girl was mine!

767
01:11:58,526 --> 01:11:59,486
She's of no use to us.

768
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:01,571
Only our mission
for the fuehrer matters.

769
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,076
I wonder sometimes, Monsieur,

770
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,536
if you have that
clearly in mind.

771
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,538
It was not to be, chérie.

772
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:13,333
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!

773
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:16,252
Indiana Jones...

774
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:17,337
adieu.

775
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,851
No!

776
01:12:41,152 --> 01:12:42,362
Take this.

777
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:44,197
Wave it at anything
that slithers.

778
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,448
Thank you.

779
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:48,159
Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.

780
01:12:51,204 --> 01:12:52,288
Indy!

781
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:55,000
Ow! Jesus!

782
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:59,254
Where did you get this?
From him?

783
01:12:59,337 --> 01:13:00,672
I was trying to escape.

784
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:01,673
No thanks to you.

785
01:13:01,756 --> 01:13:03,216
How hard were you trying?

786
01:13:03,299 --> 01:13:04,467
Well, where the hell were you?

787
01:13:04,509 --> 01:13:05,802
Watch it, watch it.

788
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,178
What are you doing?!

789
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:08,805
For the fire!

790
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:12,600
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

791
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:14,144
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!

792
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:15,895
Well, whatever you're
doing, do it faster.

793
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:21,526
Ah...

794
01:13:21,568 --> 01:13:23,403
Where are you going?

795
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:24,904
Through that wall.

796
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:27,365
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

797
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:28,992
What do you mean by that?

798
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:43,006
Indy!

799
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:45,842
Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!

800
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,452
Indy!

801
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:13,703
Here we go!

802
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:14,704
Get ready!

803
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:18,625
Indy, the torch is going out!

804
01:14:59,624 --> 01:15:01,042
Indy?

805
01:15:21,396 --> 01:15:23,106
Marion!

806
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:25,692
Look. Look.

807
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:05,523
They're going to fly it
out of here.

808
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:07,025
When that Ark gets loaded,

809
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:09,235
we're already going
to be on the plane.

810
01:16:13,907 --> 01:16:17,869
Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.

811
01:16:17,952 --> 01:16:19,162
To the Ark.

812
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:21,206
When we are very far
from here.

813
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:22,916
That will do.

814
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:19,556
Hey, you now... come here!

815
01:17:19,597 --> 01:17:21,057
Come here!

816
01:18:26,289 --> 01:18:27,540
Indy!

817
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,635
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!

818
01:19:26,349 --> 01:19:27,225
Look out!

819
01:19:38,028 --> 01:19:39,362
Oh, my God.

820
01:19:39,404 --> 01:19:40,238
Marion.

821
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:43,074
In here! Up here!

822
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:46,828
Indy, come on!

823
01:19:46,911 --> 01:19:47,996
Hold on!

824
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:50,040
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

825
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:55,170
It's stuck! Indy!

826
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:57,922
I can't push it off!

827
01:20:27,827 --> 01:20:28,745
It's stuck!

828
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:30,246
- Turn it! Turn it!
- It's stuck!

829
01:20:30,288 --> 01:20:31,414
Turn it there!

830
01:20:31,498 --> 01:20:33,083
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!

831
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:57,065
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

832
01:20:57,148 --> 01:20:59,025
Have it put on the truck.

833
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:00,485
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

834
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:03,363
And Gobler, I want
plenty of protection.

835
01:21:09,869 --> 01:21:11,538
Jones.

836
01:21:17,335 --> 01:21:18,670
Holy smoke, my friends,

837
01:21:18,712 --> 01:21:20,588
I... I'm so pleased
you're not dead!

838
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,842
Indy, Indy, we have no time.

839
01:21:23,925 --> 01:21:25,260
If you still want the Ark,

840
01:21:25,385 --> 01:21:27,762
it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.

841
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:29,681
Truck?

842
01:21:29,764 --> 01:21:30,974
What truck?

843
01:21:58,209 --> 01:21:59,502
Let's go!

844
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:10,096
Get back to Cairo.

845
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:12,223
Get us some transport
to England...

846
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:15,226
boat, plane, anything.

847
01:22:15,393 --> 01:22:16,353
Meet me at Omar's.

848
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:17,395
Be ready for me.

849
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:18,521
I'm going after that truck.

850
01:22:18,563 --> 01:22:19,522
How?

851
01:22:19,564 --> 01:22:20,523
I don't know.

852
01:22:20,565 --> 01:22:22,067
I'm making this up as I go.

853
01:25:59,492 --> 01:26:01,036
Ew!

854
01:28:22,927 --> 01:28:23,887
He's there!

855
01:29:16,523 --> 01:29:18,233
Idiot! Idiot!

856
01:30:03,069 --> 01:30:05,238
Everything at last
has been arranged.

857
01:30:05,321 --> 01:30:06,573
The Ark?

858
01:30:06,656 --> 01:30:07,657
Is on board.

859
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:09,659
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

860
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:10,994
Or what is left of you.

861
01:30:11,036 --> 01:30:11,995
You trust these guys?

862
01:30:12,037 --> 01:30:13,413
Yes.

863
01:30:13,496 --> 01:30:15,665
Mr. Katanga.

864
01:30:19,878 --> 01:30:22,422
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

865
01:30:22,505 --> 01:30:24,257
They are my family.

866
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:27,218
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

867
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:30,263
My cabin is theirs.

868
01:30:30,388 --> 01:30:32,015
Mr. Jones...

869
01:30:32,057 --> 01:30:34,601
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

870
01:30:34,684 --> 01:30:37,687
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

871
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:44,903
Good-bye.

872
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:48,281
Look out for each other.

873
01:30:48,406 --> 01:30:50,533
I am already missing you.

874
01:30:52,827 --> 01:30:55,080
You're my good friend.

875
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,875
Sallah.

876
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:04,964
That is for Fayah...

877
01:31:05,048 --> 01:31:07,509
that is for your children...

878
01:31:07,592 --> 01:31:09,969
and this is for you.

879
01:31:14,724 --> 01:31:16,226
Thank you.

880
01:31:24,943 --> 01:31:29,906
A British tar is a soaring soul

881
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:34,536
As free as a mountain bird

882
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:38,248
His energetic fist
should be ready to...

883
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:42,627
...a dictator...

884
01:31:49,134 --> 01:31:51,094
Where did you go?

885
01:31:51,136 --> 01:31:52,220
I'm cleaning up.

886
01:31:53,805 --> 01:31:55,724
Where'd you get that?

887
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:57,183
From him.

888
01:31:57,267 --> 01:31:58,601
Who him?

889
01:31:58,643 --> 01:31:59,602
Katanga.

890
01:31:59,644 --> 01:32:01,563
I got a feeling
I'm not the first woman

891
01:32:01,646 --> 01:32:03,231
ever to travel
with these pirates.

892
01:32:03,356 --> 01:32:05,525
It's lovely.

893
01:32:05,608 --> 01:32:06,526
Yeah?

894
01:32:06,609 --> 01:32:07,527
Yeah.

895
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:08,528
Really?

896
01:32:08,611 --> 01:32:10,488
Yeah.

897
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:23,418
What'd you say?

898
01:32:30,383 --> 01:32:32,635
Wait... I don't need any help.

899
01:32:32,677 --> 01:32:34,346
You know you do.

900
01:32:36,014 --> 01:32:39,517
You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.

901
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:44,189
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

902
01:32:47,567 --> 01:32:49,486
You are...

903
01:32:50,737 --> 01:32:52,364
Please, I don't need a nurse.

904
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:53,907
- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.

905
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:54,991
Marion, leave me alone.

906
01:32:55,075 --> 01:32:56,451
- What is this here?
- Go away.

907
01:32:56,534 --> 01:32:58,870
Yes, it hurts.

908
01:32:58,953 --> 01:33:00,246
Ow!

909
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:02,457
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

910
01:33:04,084 --> 01:33:05,835
Here.

911
01:33:11,383 --> 01:33:12,717
Here.

912
01:33:21,393 --> 01:33:23,353
This isn't too bad.

913
01:33:32,904 --> 01:33:33,863
Here.

914
01:33:54,676 --> 01:33:55,635
Jones...

915
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:00,515
Jones?!

916
01:34:02,976 --> 01:34:06,771
We never seem to get
a break, do we?

917
01:34:33,089 --> 01:34:34,466
What is it?

918
01:34:34,549 --> 01:34:35,925
Engines have stopped.

919
01:34:35,967 --> 01:34:37,427
I'm going to go check.

920
01:34:48,271 --> 01:34:49,189
What's happening?

921
01:34:49,272 --> 01:34:50,523
We have most important friends.

922
01:34:50,607 --> 01:34:52,233
Holy shit.

923
01:34:53,985 --> 01:34:54,736
I sent my man for you.

924
01:34:54,819 --> 01:34:55,904
You and the girl must disappear.

925
01:34:55,987 --> 01:34:56,946
We have a place in the hold.

926
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,655
Come on, go, go, go.

927
01:34:57,739 --> 01:34:58,698
Come on, go, my friend, go.

928
01:35:11,503 --> 01:35:13,838
Where is Dr. Jones?

929
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:14,839
What's the big idea?

930
01:35:14,881 --> 01:35:16,174
Let go!

931
01:35:20,345 --> 01:35:23,098
Don't you touch me.

932
01:36:07,183 --> 01:36:09,019
What about Jones?

933
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,396
There's no trace yet, sir.

934
01:36:11,438 --> 01:36:13,523
Jones is dead.

935
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:17,068
I killed him.

936
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,112
He was of no use to us.

937
01:36:19,195 --> 01:36:24,200
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

938
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:26,870
She'll bring a very good price.

939
01:36:26,911 --> 01:36:27,871
Mmm?

940
01:36:27,912 --> 01:36:31,541
Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken...

941
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,501
if it's your goal,
go in peace with it,

942
01:36:33,585 --> 01:36:34,669
but leave us the girl.

943
01:36:34,753 --> 01:36:36,629
It would reduce our loss
on this trip.

944
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:38,381
Savage!

945
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:42,052
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

946
01:36:42,093 --> 01:36:44,012
We will take what we wish.

947
01:36:44,095 --> 01:36:45,764
And then decide whether or not

948
01:36:45,847 --> 01:36:47,807
to blow your ship
from the water.

949
01:36:51,061 --> 01:36:52,437
The girl goes with me.

950
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,814
She'll be part
of my compensation.

951
01:36:54,898 --> 01:36:57,275
I'm sure your fuehrer
would approve.

952
01:36:57,317 --> 01:36:59,027
If she fails to please me,

953
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:01,154
you may do with her as you wish.

954
01:37:01,237 --> 01:37:04,032
I will waste
no more time with her now.

955
01:37:04,115 --> 01:37:05,200
Excuse me.

956
01:37:21,633 --> 01:37:23,343
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.

957
01:37:23,426 --> 01:37:24,678
I've looked everywhere.

958
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:27,222
He's got to be here somewhere.

959
01:37:27,305 --> 01:37:28,431
Look again.

960
01:37:30,308 --> 01:37:32,143
- I found him.
- Where?

961
01:37:32,185 --> 01:37:33,019
There.

962
01:39:59,332 --> 01:40:01,584
The altar has been
prepared in accordance

963
01:40:01,626 --> 01:40:03,503
with your radio instructions,
sir.

964
01:40:03,586 --> 01:40:04,587
Good.

965
01:40:04,671 --> 01:40:06,131
Take the Ark there immediately.

966
01:40:07,799 --> 01:40:09,509
Monsieur...

967
01:40:12,012 --> 01:40:14,180
I am uncomfortable
with the thought

968
01:40:14,264 --> 01:40:16,808
of this... Jewish ritual.

969
01:40:18,351 --> 01:40:20,729
Are you sure it's necessary?

970
01:40:20,812 --> 01:40:22,689
Let me ask you this:

971
01:40:22,772 --> 01:40:26,901
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,

972
01:40:26,985 --> 01:40:28,778
for your fuehrer?

973
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:30,113
Finding out, only then,

974
01:40:30,155 --> 01:40:33,199
if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside?

975
01:40:33,283 --> 01:40:34,284
Knowing, only then,

976
01:40:34,409 --> 01:40:36,411
whether you have accomplished
your mission,

977
01:40:36,494 --> 01:40:39,539
and obtained the one true Ark?

978
01:42:07,919 --> 01:42:09,212
Hello!

979
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,008
Jones.

980
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:15,719
Jones!

981
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,887
I'm going to blow up the Ark,
Rene.

982
01:42:23,768 --> 01:42:27,897
Your persistence
surprises even me.

983
01:42:27,981 --> 01:42:30,442
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

984
01:42:30,525 --> 01:42:33,153
Dr. Jones...

985
01:42:35,655 --> 01:42:38,199
surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

986
01:42:38,283 --> 01:42:41,244
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

987
01:42:41,327 --> 01:42:43,496
All I want is the girl.

988
01:42:47,667 --> 01:42:49,419
If we refuse?

989
01:42:49,461 --> 01:42:53,298
Then your fuehrer has no prize.

990
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,591
Okay, stand back.

991
01:42:54,674 --> 01:42:55,925
All of you, stand back.

992
01:42:56,009 --> 01:42:57,594
Stand back.

993
01:42:57,677 --> 01:42:58,803
Okay, Jones.

994
01:42:58,887 --> 01:43:02,057
You win!

995
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:03,558
Blow it up.

996
01:43:09,314 --> 01:43:10,440
Yes, blow it up!

997
01:43:12,776 --> 01:43:14,778
Blow it back to God.

998
01:43:14,819 --> 01:43:16,863
All your life has been spent

999
01:43:16,946 --> 01:43:19,491
in pursuit
of archaeological relics.

1000
01:43:19,574 --> 01:43:24,037
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

1001
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:28,458
You want to see it open
as well as I.

1002
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,794
Indiana...

1003
01:43:30,835 --> 01:43:35,090
we are simply passing
through history.

1004
01:43:35,173 --> 01:43:36,299
This...

1005
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,637
This is history.

1006
01:43:49,813 --> 01:43:52,190
Do as you will.

1007
01:46:27,178 --> 01:46:29,514
Marion, don't look at it.

1008
01:46:29,597 --> 01:46:30,640
Shut your eyes, Marion.

1009
01:46:30,682 --> 01:46:32,600
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

1010
01:46:44,195 --> 01:46:46,740
Ah...

1011
01:47:00,754 --> 01:47:03,506
It's beautiful!

1012
01:47:13,641 --> 01:47:14,768
Indy?

1013
01:47:14,851 --> 01:47:16,102
Don't look, Marion!

1014
01:47:16,186 --> 01:47:17,562
Keep your eyes shut!

1015
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:36,766
Marion.

1016
01:49:09,341 --> 01:49:12,385
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you

1017
01:49:12,469 --> 01:49:16,848
and we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

1018
01:49:16,931 --> 01:49:18,016
Oh, the money's fine.

1019
01:49:18,099 --> 01:49:19,934
The situation's
totally unacceptable.

1020
01:49:20,018 --> 01:49:20,935
Well, gentlemen,

1021
01:49:21,019 --> 01:49:22,729
I guess that just about
wraps it up.

1022
01:49:22,812 --> 01:49:24,647
Where is the Ark?

1023
01:49:24,689 --> 01:49:27,859
I thought we'd settled that.

1024
01:49:27,942 --> 01:49:30,195
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

1025
01:49:30,278 --> 01:49:31,404
From whom?

1026
01:49:31,488 --> 01:49:34,532
The Ark is a source
of unspeakable power

1027
01:49:34,616 --> 01:49:36,701
and it has to be researched.

1028
01:49:36,785 --> 01:49:39,871
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,

1029
01:49:39,954 --> 01:49:41,081
Dr. Jones.

1030
01:49:41,164 --> 01:49:44,709
We have top men
working on it right now.

1031
01:49:46,086 --> 01:49:47,253
Who?

1032
01:49:48,963 --> 01:49:51,216
Top men.

1033
01:49:54,511 --> 01:49:56,763
Hey, what happened?

1034
01:49:56,846 --> 01:49:57,889
You don't look very happy.

1035
01:49:57,972 --> 01:49:59,891
Fools. Bureaucratic fools.

1036
01:49:59,974 --> 01:50:01,017
What'd they say?

1037
01:50:01,059 --> 01:50:04,145
They don't know
what they've got there.

1038
01:50:04,229 --> 01:50:07,565
Well, I know what I've got here.

1039
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:08,900
Come on.

1040
01:50:08,983 --> 01:50:10,402
I'll buy you a drink.

1041
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,239
You know...

1042
01:50:14,322 --> 01:50:16,324
a drink?
