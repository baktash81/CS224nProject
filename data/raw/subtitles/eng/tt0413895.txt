1
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:16,244
There was nothing
special about Somerset County.

2
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:19,547
It was a deeply
ordinary place.

3
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:23,184
No astonishing thing
ever happened there.

4
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:26,854
The people who lived there
were just regular people.

5
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,489
And the animals...

6
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,659
Well, they were
just plain old animals.

7
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,695
They didn't question
the order of things.

8
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,567
So, the days passed,
one very much like the other.

9
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:45,339
But, one spring,
on a small farm,

10
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,008
a little girl did something,

11
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,413
something that would
change everything.

12
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,845
What are you doing?

13
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,251
Fern, go back to bed.

14
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,320
You're not going to
kill it, are you?

15
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,855
It's a runt.
Now, go back to bed.

16
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,557
No, it's not fair!

17
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,493
It can't help
being born small.

18
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,460
Careful.

19
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,730
If I'd been born small,
would you have killed me?

20
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,865
Of course not.

21
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,867
A little girl is one thing.

22
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,404
A runty pig is another.

23
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,306
There's no difference!

24
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,442
This is unfair and unjust.

25
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,744
How could you
be so heartless?

26
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:04,845
Come here.

27
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,079
I want to show you something.

28
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,949
You see that? You see?

29
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,019
There's 11 pigs
and only 10 teats.

30
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,021
Sow can't feed it, honey.

31
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,024
Then I will.

32
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:28,336
I'll feed you
and take care of you and...

33
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,507
...absolutely will not
let you kill him.

34
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,757
Hey! When did Fern get a pig?

35
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,159
Avery, it's rude to point.
Give me that.

36
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,594
Come, sit,
eat your breakfast.

37
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,129
The bus will be
here any minute.

38
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,631
Good morning.

39
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,600
Hey, Pop,
can I have a pig, too?

40
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,870
No. I only give pigs
to early risers.

41
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,137
Fern was up before dawn,

42
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,440
ridding the world
of injustice.

43
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,811
Fern, put that pig down
and get to school.

44
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,346
Avery.

45
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,181
- See ya.
- Bye, Pop.

46
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,350
Have a good one, buddy.

47
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,854
Says here we're gonna get
a lot of rain this month.

48
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,563
Fern! Your books!

49
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:33,734
Bye.

50
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,637
Class, these are
some of the questions

51
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:41,542
that you're likely to be
asked in the exam this week.

52
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:46,046
So, please take
particular note of every one.

53
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,484
Shh!
You got to be quiet, okay?

54
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,319
You're gonna
get me in trouble.

55
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,121
Drink that.

56
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,660
So, it's just a matter of
following these questions

57
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,995
and learning the answers.

58
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,035
Fern, what's going on?

59
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,071
Nothing.

60
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,140
Fern, what's in your desk?

61
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,076
- Nothing.
- Open it.

62
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,493
Thank you, Mrs. Arable.

63
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,195
Fern, you know better.

64
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,363
It's a pig, okay?

65
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:39,232
It's not a toy,
not a doll, not a baby.

66
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,701
A pig.

67
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,871
And you need to start
treating it like one.

68
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,980
This is going too far.

69
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,456
I know she loves animals,
but you have to tell her.

70
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,391
I know.
She's just so happy with it.

71
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:06,059
I know.

72
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,435
Doesn't that feel good?

73
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:19,406
Fern, I'm really sorry, honey,
but it's been long enough.

74
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,541
What?

75
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,442
Look, he's not
a baby anymore.

76
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,944
I can't have you keeping
what will soon be

77
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,846
a 300-pound pet
around the house.

78
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,447
No.

79
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:31,318
Can't he stay in the barn?
Please, Dad?

80
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,786
- No.
- Please?

81
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,955
No. Fern, look.
You know I've been selling the animals

82
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,257
to get the new
harvesting equipment.

83
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:41,328
Pretty soon there's gonna be no
place in the barn for a pig.

84
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,896
I promised I'd
take care of him.

85
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,699
Well, I'm letting you
out of your promise.

86
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,202
I didn't promise you.
I promised Wilbur.

87
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,372
What about Homer?

88
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,241
He has animals.

89
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,944
Uncle Homer?

90
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,947
I'm sure he could
make room for a pig.

91
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:06,787
Yeah.

92
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,222
He'd be right
across the road.

93
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:27,741
* Go to sleep, my little one

94
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:33,614
* The sun has said
goodbye for now

95
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:39,587
* The moon shines on
your beautiful face *

96
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,893
My mom used to sing that
to me to make me feel safe.

97
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,629
Good night,

98
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,299
Wilbur.

99
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,942
Fern had
walked across the road

100
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,978
to her uncle's barn
hundreds of times before,

101
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,081
but it had never
felt so far away.

102
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,685
It was just a big red barn
full of typical stuff.

103
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:20,027
Come to think of it,
it couldn't have been more ordinary.

104
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,763
But sometimes, when you
take two ordinary things

105
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,365
and put them together
at just the right time,

106
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:30,037
there's a chance they'll become
two less ordinary things.

107
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:34,407
That runty pig, for instance,
and that big old smelly barn.

108
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:38,879
One sniff, and you knew it was
a place full of living things.

109
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,649
But that didn't necessarily
mean it was full of life.

110
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,516
It's okay. It's okay.

111
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,319
Nope. For that,
this barn needed a pig.

112
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,521
This isn't so bad.

113
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,223
Only no one knew it yet.

114
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,458
Don't be afraid.

115
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,699
You'll be okay.

116
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,673
I'll come see you every day.

117
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,375
I'll be around so much
you'll be sick of me.

118
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,050
I love you.

119
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,631
Avery, the bus is here!

120
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,435
Did you remember
your sister's lunch?

121
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,970
Got it!

122
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,798
What the hay?

123
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:05,933
What's he doing?

124
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,701
Probably-obably
something smart.

125
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,102
Pigs are smart.

126
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,170
Pigs are not smart!

127
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,173
Apparently, they're as
intelligent as dolphins.

128
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,675
Advantage dolphin.

129
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:16,977
He's going to
knock himself out.

130
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,245
Yeah!
That's using your head!

131
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,181
How many times
is he going to try that?

132
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:23,751
Pig's out!

133
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:24,885
I told you pigs are smart.

134
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,519
That's going to
leave a mark.

135
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,689
Oh, look, Bits. Pig's out.

136
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,959
Sure is out.
Out of his mind!

137
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,799
Homer!

138
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,534
Lurvy!

139
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,602
Pig's out!

140
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,804
Pig's out,
pig's out, pig's out!

141
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,405
How about you
walk a little faster?

142
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,639
Wait your turn!

143
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,877
Wait! Wait!
Fern, come back!

144
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,779
Just run!

145
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,214
Run, pig! Be free!

146
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,448
I would if I could.

147
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,583
Retreat!

148
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,617
Retreat!

149
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,852
Don't retreat, pig!
Giddyup!

150
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:02,122
Oh, no! Not the smokehouse!
No! Not the smokehouse!

151
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,261
- Is he looking?
- Yeah, he's seen it.

152
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,162
Think he knows what it is?

153
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,131
Of course not.
He's a spring pig.

154
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,166
He doesn't know anything.

155
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,938
Here, pig, pig, pig,
pig, pig, pig, pig!

156
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:23,576
Don't fall for it.
You're out.

157
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,345
And you're back in.

158
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,314
Here you go, piggy.

159
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,616
Attaboy. Eat it up.

160
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,718
Sold out for slop.

161
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,520
I'd have been to
the county line by now.

162
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,923
He'd have made it if you'd
have just let me talk.

163
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,624
Made it to where? He's a pig!

164
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,892
He's a pig.

165
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,693
Sorry I made such a fuss.

166
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,930
Your suggestions
were really good,

167
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,798
but I think
I'd better stay here.

168
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,900
Fern's going to be
back soon, anyway.

169
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,536
He's just stupid
as a stick, poor thing.

170
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,603
Should we speak to him?

171
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,572
- Certainly not!
- Oh, certainly not.

172
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,909
Sweetheart, it sounded-ounded
almost like you said you'd run

173
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,577
and be free if you could.

174
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,047
I meant if I were a pig.

175
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,549
You know what happens
to pigs around here.

176
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,716
Yes, I do.

177
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,153
And it should never,
ever be spoken of.

178
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,599
I'm gonna miss you today.

179
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,534
See you when I get back, okay?

180
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,340
All right, I gotta go, okay?
See you later.

181
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:35,815
Bye.

182
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,534
Goodbye, Fern. Hurry back.

183
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,572
Uh, hi.

184
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,375
My name's Wilbur.

185
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,377
Anyone want to play?

186
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,346
Anyone?

187
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,781
It's raining, you know.

188
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,717
And you know
what you get with rain?

189
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,052
- Lightning.
- Typhoons.

190
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,586
- Cholera.
- Dysentery.

191
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,422
- Frizzy hair.
- That sad feeling.

192
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,689
No, mud!

193
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,992
What the heck
is he doing now?

194
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,328
Hey, come on. You wanna join me?
Come on! Let's go!

195
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,330
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

196
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,197
Let's not.

197
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,533
How many times
must I tell you?

198
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,001
Just because we're sheep,

199
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,570
it doesn't mean
we have to follow.

200
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,005
Think for yourselves.

201
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,406
- Yourselves. Quite right!
- Look at me!

202
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,774
No, no, no. Yourselves.

203
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,343
Oh, myself?

204
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:40,580
Hey, kid, this is a barn.
We don't play, we work.

205
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,714
Some of us, anyway.

206
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:42,815
"Some of us"?

207
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,652
Are you implying, Ike,
that we don't work?

208
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:49,489
Because we work bloody hard,
thank you!

209
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,591
Hard? You grow hair!

210
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,427
"Grow hair." Good one!

211
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,567
Oh, and is that your contribution to society,
you gassy rib eyes?

212
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,335
Filthy hairball!

213
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,403
Rib eyes!

214
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,504
Dirty lintball!

215
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,372
Ah, zip it.

216
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,174
- They're at it again.
- Rib eyes! Rib eyes!

217
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,442
It's really slippery.
That's the fun part!

218
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:13,046
Oh, little itty-bitty pig,
could you come here, please?

219
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,283
You said your name
is Wilbur, right?

220
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,385
That's right.
What's your name?

221
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,919
- Gussy.
- Gussy?

222
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,088
Great name!

223
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,155
Thank you, Wilbur.

224
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,993
Now, you're so cute and pink,
but you're wasting your time.

225
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,194
These animals won't play.

226
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,029
- What about you?
- Me?

227
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,731
Well, I have to
stay on my eggs.

228
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,001
Oh, wow! Look at that!

229
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,603
Otherwise, of course,
I'd love to play.

230
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,371
So, why can't you play?

231
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:42,209
Because what's good for the
goose is good for the gander.

232
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,610
What about the rest of you?

233
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,012
Don't any of you
like to play?

234
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,080
Can't play on
three empty stomachs.

235
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,116
Well, for us
there's this whole

236
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,584
smell-of-wet-wool business.
Ghastly!

237
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:55,055
See? I'm afraid it's just
not a play kind of place.

238
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,589
But you're all friends,
right?

239
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,326
Oh, sure.
We've been here together our whole lives.

240
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:04,231
I'm not so sure being in the same
place is the same as being friends.

241
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,103
I'm not hungry.

242
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,339
I just wanted someone
to play with me.

243
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,442
What's that?

244
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,077
What is...

245
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,645
Oh, oh, oh...

246
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,747
Could it be?

247
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,250
Slops!

248
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,787
Oh, joy. It seems the pig slop
has brought out the rodent.

249
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,257
Moldy cheese. Oh, yeah.

250
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,695
Did I have salami last night?

251
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,599
Yep. I guess I did.

252
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:40,900
Oh, charming.

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,036
- Disgusting creature!
- Hi, there.

254
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,706
Oh, you're a pig.

255
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,043
You're a pig.

256
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,179
Pig equals slop.

257
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,582
Mmm, the rat is happy.

258
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,518
My name's Wilbur.
Do you have a name?

259
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,919
Or is it just "the rat"?

260
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,960
Did you say "just the rat"?

261
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,264
For your information, pig,
the rat rules.

262
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,966
We were here
long before your kind,

263
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,468
and we'll be here long after.

264
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,170
So, y-you just
keep that in mind

265
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,740
next time you feel like
reducing me to "just the rat."

266
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,809
You called yourself
"the rat."

267
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,978
I can call me that.
You can't.

268
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,515
So you don't have a name?

269
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,152
Of course I do.
It's Templeton.

270
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,121
Templeton? Great name!

271
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,255
Oh, gee, thanks.

272
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,557
Hey!
You want to play, Templeton?

273
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:41,328
For so many reasons, no.

274
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,996
See, I don't play.

275
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,766
I gnaw, I spy, I eat, I hide.

276
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,834
Me in a nutshell.

277
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,769
Couldn't you
just stay and chat?

278
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,938
Chat? Uh, let me see.

279
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:55,208
Gnaw, spy, eat, hide.

280
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,211
Nope,
"chat" ain't on the list.

281
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,919
Mmm, the rat is handsome.

282
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,717
Tonight I dream of slop!

283
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,057
Fern, you are not going to see
that pig again. It's too late.

284
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,326
But he's expecting me!

285
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:50,096
And I'm expecting you to finish your
homework and go straight to bed.

286
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,865
But, Mom,
I always tell him good night!

287
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,167
Not tonight.

288
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,236
He can't sleep if I don't.

289
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,273
Good night.

290
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,342
Good night.

291
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,877
Good night!

292
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,979
Good night.

293
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,948
Huh? Who said that?

294
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,418
Who are you?

295
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:14,754
Where are you?
Are you invisible?

296
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,423
No, I'm nocturnal,

297
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,726
which means I work at night,
when you should be sleeping.

298
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:23,896
Now, I need to concentrate,
so, good night.

299
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,065
But I can't sleep now!

300
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,934
Please, tell me who you are.

301
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,570
I'm just really lonely.

302
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,638
So I've seen.

303
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:36,209
Look, you seem like a very nice pig,
so I'll tell you what.

304
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,845
If you go to sleep right now
and let me work,

305
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,947
we can converse tomorrow.

306
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,282
Converse?

307
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,651
Uh, I think
your word was "chat."

308
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,254
Oh. Great! All right.

309
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,956
Good night. Good night.

310
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:50,990
Good night.

311
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,961
Good night.

312
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,440
Okay,
he still hasn't moved.

313
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,177
We've been here one,
wait, uh, two...

314
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,280
We've been here
a long time, Elwyn,

315
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,448
and that guy ain't moving!

316
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,917
He's like
a freak of nature.

317
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,051
I'm dying, man.

318
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,520
I've got to get some corn!

319
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,155
I know, Brooksie.
Just be patient.

320
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,161
Come on.

321
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,130
Come on.

322
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,301
Just a little further.

323
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,605
Okay, it's morning!

324
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,740
Hey, Bits,
I wasn't drooling, was I?

325
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,974
Suck it up, Bets.

326
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,478
Would whoever addressed me last
night kindly make yourself known?

327
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,714
What luck! An early riser,

328
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,016
and he has things
he needs to say.

329
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,818
Yeah, loud things.

330
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,754
I'm speaking to whoever
spoke to me last night.

331
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,490
I suppose that would be me.

332
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,791
Okay.

333
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,026
I can't see you.

334
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:00,993
Up here, in the corner.

335
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:04,797
The other corner.

336
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:09,035
I'm sorry.
I still can't see you.

337
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,704
Move a little closer.
I'll come down.

338
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,351
Oh.

339
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,319
Hi. You're a...

340
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,522
Look, I've got a long day ahead of
me and I'm trying to get a little...

341
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,391
Spider! Spider!
Get it away from me!

342
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,260
Get it away! Get it away!

343
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,062
All right,
keep your distance there.

344
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,430
That thing is creepy.

345
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,732
Golly! You're not
being rude, are you?

346
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:43,903
No, no, no. I meant "creepy" in a nice way.
You know, creepy good.

347
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,839
Disgusting!
They eat their menfolk, you know.

348
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:47,740
I know!

349
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,143
Well? Still want to chat,
or are you gonna join them?

350
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,813
I've never met
a spider before.

351
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,282
Did you make that?

352
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,918
Is that what you were
concentrating on last night?

353
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,052
Yes.

354
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,355
It's amazing.

355
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,057
Think you could teach me
how to make one of those?

356
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,530
Oh, hold that thought, please.

357
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:14,734
What are you doing?

358
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,935
Making breakfast.

359
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,804
- Oh, boy.
- Relax.

360
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:21,307
First,
I give him a little nip to anesthetize him,

361
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:22,775
so he'll be more comfortable.

362
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,911
It's a little service
I throw in.

363
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,646
Then I wrap him up.

364
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:30,517
Then I just say grace because,
well, that's always nice,

365
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,385
and he'll make
a perfectly delicious meal.

366
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:35,722
So, you eat flies?

367
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,624
No, no, no.

368
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,859
I drink their blood.

369
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,696
Lying down on the job, eh?

370
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,031
Fainted like a girl.

371
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,499
That's disgusting.

372
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,868
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

373
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:52,238
You have all your meals
brought to you in a pail.

374
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,306
I don't get that kind
of royal treatment.

375
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:55,942
I am a trapper.

376
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,610
I have to catch my food.

377
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,846
Which is why I make
my home near you.

378
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,280
Please don't hurt me.

379
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,550
Well,
since you said "please."

380
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,287
And just imagine how many bugs
there would be in this barn,

381
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,590
no, actually, in the world,

382
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,459
if spiders didn't catch them.

383
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,360
Insects would
take over the planet!

384
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:17,296
The way I see it,
I'm doing everyone a favor.

385
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,398
Except for the fly.

386
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,870
Yes. Except for the fly.

387
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:30,877
I think now is the time
for me to say salutations.

388
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,178
What?

389
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,580
Salutations.

390
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,016
Oh, okay. I'll leave.

391
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,885
No, Wilbur.

392
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:42,922
"Salutations"
is just a fancy way of saying hello.

393
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,825
Oh! Hello.

394
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,195
Hey, you know my name!
What's yours?

395
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,897
My name?

396
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,465
My name is Charlotte.

397
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,467
Charlotte A. Cavatica.

398
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:57,670
Charlotte. Great name!

399
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,272
Thank you.
I've always thought so.

400
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,543
Hey, since you've said..

401
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,745
You know, that word,

402
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,947
does that mean we're friends?

403
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,850
Hmm, I suppose it does.

404
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,218
Yeah!

405
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:18,357
Golly,
go see what's going-oing on over there.

406
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,026
What's going-oing...

407
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,729
Hey, kid,
what's going on over here?

408
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:23,863
Oh, sorry.

409
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,765
I just made a new friend,
that's all.

410
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:29,869
The spider.
Oh, yeah. Good choice.

411
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,604
Yeah, perfect.

412
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:35,608
You picked someone
even more despised than me.

413
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,377
Why would anyone
despise Charlotte?

414
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,212
She made that amazing web,

415
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,549
and she keeps
bugs out of the barn.

416
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:43,716
Look at her.

417
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,585
I mean, don't you
think she's a little...

418
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:47,954
Oh, what's the word?

419
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,221
Ew!

420
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:52,725
I think she's beautiful.

421
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:56,362
I beg your pardon.
She is hideous!

422
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,799
Are we even seeing
the same ruddy creature?

423
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,801
I guess not.

424
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:07,173
Hopeless.

425
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,911
What a sorry little friendship
that's going to be.

426
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,850
There's an old expression that
says that ignorance is bliss,

427
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,887
and I'm inclined to
believe it's true,

428
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,822
because,
on that late spring day,

429
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:26,626
Wilbur was as happy
as a pig could be.

430
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:29,929
And those spring days
rolled into summer days,

431
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,899
days filled with
endless conversation

432
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,802
between the two
unlikeliest of friends.

433
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,304
Charlotte,
what's a spring pig?

434
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,306
A pig who was
born in the spring.

435
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:42,709
Oh. And I thought
it meant bouncy.

436
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,344
That would be a springy pig.

437
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:49,115
"After Mrs. Mallard had
laid eight eggs in the nest,

438
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,250
"she couldn't go to
visit Michael anymore,

439
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,020
"because she had to sit on
the eggs to keep them warm.

440
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,157
"She moved off the nest only to get a
drink of water, or to have her lunch,

441
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,861
"or to count the eggs and make
sure they were all there.

442
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,230
"One day,
the ducklings hatched out.

443
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,432
"First came Jack,
then Kack..."

444
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,034
Yeah! Yeah!
This is going to be great!

445
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,302
Wilbur,
what on earth are you doing?

446
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,138
You'll see.

447
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,540
Oh, that feels marvelous!

448
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:17,276
Yes, over to the left a bit.
Ah, yes.

449
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,545
Is that a breeze I feel?

450
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,147
I'm 10 pounds lighter!

451
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,314
- I'm next!
- I'm next!

452
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,850
- I'm next!
- I'm next, too!

453
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,652
Looking pretty good, huh?

454
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,319
Sure is.

455
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,454
Hi, there.

456
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,522
Are you new to the barn?
I'm Wilbur.

457
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,224
Wilbur, it's me.

458
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,926
Me? Great name!

459
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:37,664
No, me. Me!
Samuel! The sheep!

460
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,266
Wow! What happened to you?

461
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:49,541
The world's first pig web!
Ta-da!

462
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:52,745
I think you'd better leave
the web-spinning to me.

463
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,446
After weeks and weeks,

464
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:59,618
and I'm talking about some long
weeks of waiting and expecting,

465
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:03,622
all the hard work
has finally paid off.

466
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,258
Wow! Look at them!

467
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,594
They were eggs, and now they're...
They're just...

468
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:09,896
Look at them!

469
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:12,564
Wow, Gussy, you did
a really terrific job!

470
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,667
They don't call me
Mother Goose for nothing.

471
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:15,902
Congratulations.

472
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:17,904
Oh.
Would you look at that!

473
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:21,307
Yes, thank you, thank you!

474
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,242
It wasn't easy,
but I managed.

475
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,310
You managed?

476
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,614
I'm kidding, honey.
We managed.

477
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:32,418
Six, seven.
Weren't there eight eggs?

478
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,887
Could this be a dud?

479
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,256
G-G-Golly! Golly! Golly!

480
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,959
Whoa!
W-W-Whoa, there, Father Goose!

481
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,961
I...I...I'm just trying to
help the happy couple.

482
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,463
What do you want
with a rotten egg, anyway?

483
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,033
I want a rotten egg

484
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,068
for the simple reason that...

485
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,402
You never know.

486
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,871
This one didn't make it.

487
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,306
I think we have to
let it go.

488
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,441
Mmm-hmm.

489
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,843
Oh, take it!

490
00:27:56,943 --> 00:28:01,047
And add it to that nasty-asty
collection of yours.

491
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,215
Last one out is
a rotten egg!

492
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,285
Well, I thought it was funny.

493
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,654
- I should have pecked him!
- Don't you break that egg, rat.

494
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:11,590
A broken rotten egg would make
this barn stink to high heaven.

495
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,992
That would be a change.

496
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,461
Why are you laughing, Bits?

497
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:16,796
He just said we stink.

498
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,430
Oh, yeah. This is good.

499
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,032
This will come in handy.

500
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,406
You really are
a handsome devil.

501
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:30,910
Oh, boy.

502
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,332
Egg-xactly!

503
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:04,476
Saw a big old spider
in the doorway!

504
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,577
Gonna go catch it!

505
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,379
No, Avery! Come back here!

506
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,249
- Here, spidey-spidey.
- You can't do that!

507
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,519
Stop!

508
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:17,723
Gotcha!

509
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,591
No, no, Avery!

510
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,228
Wilbur, no!
Come on, Wilbur, get off!

511
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,631
Wilbur, Wilbur,
why did you do that?

512
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,969
Avery! No!

513
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,579
Ew, that stinks!

514
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,549
Oh, that is gross.

515
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,922
Whew! Man, is that you?

516
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,324
No. I smell a smell, though.

517
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,225
Think it's scary guy?

518
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,195
- He's trying to stink us away from the...
- Corn!

519
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,835
Guess the yolk's on me.

520
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,105
That is one ripe egg.

521
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:11,110
That stinks good!

522
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,312
- Ew!
- That is disgusting!

523
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,248
We told you not
to break that egg.

524
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,150
Now look what
you've done, rat!

525
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,419
It saved Charlotte,
didn't it?

526
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,253
Yeah, ingrates.

527
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:24,256
I saved
the leggy lady's life.

528
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,225
You mean that as
a good thing, right?

529
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,059
Of course.

530
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,028
I do have
a few eyes, you know,

531
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:31,397
and I think Wilbur did
most of the saving.

532
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,265
I know. Ironic, isn't it?

533
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:37,703
He's saving you,
and they're saving him for Christmas.

534
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:38,804
Templeton!

535
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,539
What's Christmas?

536
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,243
The day you'll be cured.

537
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,577
But I'm not sick.

538
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,880
Oh, I didn't say
you were sick.

539
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,515
Uh-oh. That was a mistake.

540
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,083
Yep. Typical rat.

541
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:55,487
What? You're going to lie
to the future football here?

542
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:59,691
But it's a sad statement when I'm
the most honest guy in the place.

543
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,693
Templeton,
what are you talking about?

544
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,330
Come winter,
the farmer will be checking you

545
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,299
into the old
smokehouse hotel.

546
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,336
And the only checking out
that happens is

547
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,704
when people gather
around and say,

548
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:16,042
"Mmm, check out
that yummy sausage.

549
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:18,877
"Check out that
sizzling bacon."

550
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,951
So, that's what that is for.

551
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,586
Ain't for roasting chestnuts.

552
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:32,959
He...He...He wouldn't.
Humans love pigs.

553
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,062
Well, they love pork.

554
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,432
Well, this is awkward,
isn't it?

555
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,601
Charlotte!

556
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,203
Charlotte, is it true?

557
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:48,107
Wilbur, few spring pigs get
to see the snows of winter.

558
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:51,010
No! I...I can't believe this.
I won't believe it.

559
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,112
Oh, Wilbur.
It isn't fair!

560
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,381
I want to live!
I want to see the snow!

561
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,649
And you will.

562
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,418
I'm making you
a promise right now.

563
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,787
I am not going to
let them kill you.

564
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,689
You're a spider.
You're little.

565
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:04,456
They're huge!

566
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,725
How are you
going to stop them?

567
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:09,095
I have no idea.
But it's a promise,

568
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:12,698
and promises are something
I never break.

569
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,900
Just don't you
worry about it, Wilbur.

570
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:17,936
Besides, it's a long time
until Christmas.

571
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:22,641
Okay, Charlotte.
If you say so.

572
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,420
- Dad?
- Yeah.

573
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,189
Can I walk home?
I promised Wilbur I'd be there right away.

574
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,325
- Sure. That's fine with me.
- Thanks.

575
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,093
Fern, wait!

576
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:44,096
Why don't you,
um, go to the Whites'

577
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,664
or the Sergeants'
today and play?

578
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,333
Or you could
have someone over.

579
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,267
Why?

580
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,836
Because you're spending
too much time in that barn.

581
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,272
It isn't good for you
to be alone so much.

582
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,308
Alone? All my best
friends are there.

583
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,210
- Except the rat.
- The rat?

584
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,512
I wouldn't call him my friend,
but the rest of them are.

585
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,948
They tell the greatest stories.
They make me laugh.

586
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,286
And I promised them I'd read 'em this book,
so I got to go. Bye!

587
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:11,890
Dr. Dorian,
it's ridiculous, isn't it?

588
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,361
To think that animals
can actually talk?

589
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,196
I don't know.
Maybe an animal said

590
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:18,964
something to me
and I didn't hear it

591
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:21,033
because I wasn't
paying attention.

592
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:26,372
Maybe children are just
better listeners than we are.

593
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,441
Well,
it worries me to no end.

594
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,078
What's got you worried
is that her only friends

595
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:35,013
are pigs, sheep,
geese and rats.

596
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,648
Well, not rats.

597
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:38,950
No.

598
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:40,786
- Does she look well?
- Yes.

599
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,921
- Appetite's good?
- Mmm-hmm.

600
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,091
- Does she sleep well at night?
- Yes.

601
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,393
I mean, she's right
as rain in that way.

602
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:51,730
Well, there is
a name for her condition.

603
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,368
It's called
a childhood phase.

604
00:33:56,468 --> 00:34:00,072
And, sadly,
it's something she'll grow out of.

605
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,915
Charlotte,
what are you doing?

606
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:11,117
Thinking.

607
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,219
I do my best thinking
upside down.

608
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:15,754
Blood goes to my head
and perks me up.

609
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:20,326
I've been thinking, too,
you know, about Christmas.

610
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:23,362
Don't worry, Wilbur.
We'll figure something out.

611
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:31,237
Come on, Ike. Come on.

612
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,248
Um, not to be
too much trouble,

613
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:45,284
but have you
figured something out?

614
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:48,120
Not yet,
but it's like a web.

615
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,058
You make it, you wait,
and something always comes.

616
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,127
Good night, Charlotte.

617
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:57,095
Good night, Wilbur.

618
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,534
And swing.

619
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,541
And stick.

620
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,643
And loop.

621
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:28,494
And back up, stick, and...

622
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:37,869
Hmm.

623
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,974
Mr. Zuckerman!

624
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,510
Uh, okay,

625
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,413
y-y-you gotta come see this.

626
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,922
Come on, Homer!

627
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,424
Come on!

628
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,103
What's a "so me pig"?

629
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,105
It's "some pig."

630
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,774
It's a miracle.

631
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,777
It's nothing short of
a bona fide miracle.

632
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,653
Minister Beecher?

633
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,989
Homer. Edith.

634
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,958
What brings you here?

635
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,760
Divinity?

636
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,530
We think so.

637
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,481
We'd better keep this quiet

638
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,215
until I address it
in my sermon.

639
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,651
You can't tell a soul,
but you gotta come up to the barn.

640
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,053
- Keep it between me and you.
- Swing by the farm.

641
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,622
Okay. Goodbye.

642
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:54,032
Now, don't tell nobody.
Shouldn't get around.

643
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:59,438
There's a word in a spider
web at Zuckerman's barn.

644
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:23,294
Uh, Charlotte,
what does a "some pig" do?

645
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,663
This isn't for what you do.

646
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:26,432
It's for what you are.

647
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,734
Some pigs might smile a bit.

648
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,710
Oh, the lifting of the head,
nice touch!

649
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,366
As ugly as that spider is,

650
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:03,034
we should have known
she was smart.

651
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,937
So, you don't believe that someone
might be smart and pretty?

652
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,541
No. Yes! I mean, yes,
because you are.

653
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,610
Clever little spider,
isn't she?

654
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,012
Where's the spider
who did this?

655
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:18,684
Well, we...we looked all over
and couldn't find one.

656
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,056
Looks pretty good.

657
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,093
Still ain't gonna change anything.
He's a goner.

658
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:31,296
Yeah. Glad nobody eats cows.

659
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,864
Got to admit,
that's a fine-looking pig.

660
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,634
Yep, that's some pig,
all right.

661
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:45,176
After a few weeks,

662
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,113
the phenomenon of
the web wore off.

663
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:49,981
Nobody cared anymore,

664
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,918
and what was
amazing yesterday

665
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,587
was suddenly
ordinary again today.

666
00:40:56,755 --> 00:41:00,158
It looked like Wilbur might
not see snow after all.

667
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,932
Excuse me,
but why are we here?

668
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,434
I mean, yes, yes,
barn meeting and so on and so forth.

669
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:10,602
I understand that.

670
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,071
But must this concern us?

671
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,273
And at such an ungodly hour!

672
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,975
You know,
Wilbur's not the only one

673
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,744
who could end up being
Christmas dinner

674
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,712
with an apple
in his mouth.

675
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,515
Ah, good point.
Yes. Carry on, then.

676
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:26,284
Ike, this involves
every one of us.

677
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,555
I just have trouble
looking at you.

678
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:30,556
That's all.

679
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,457
This isn't about me.
It's about Wilbur.

680
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:36,027
And, for the record, my view of you
is not exactly a treat, either.

681
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,964
As we have all seen,

682
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,899
humans have very
short attention spans,

683
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,368
and there's just too much time
between now and Christmas.

684
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:46,504
Certainly enough time for Zuckerman
to find his affection for a pig

685
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:48,239
losing out to
his hunger for ham.

686
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,609
- That spider can talk!
- Yeah.

687
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:51,977
What did she say, exactly?

688
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:56,047
She said the farmer might
possibly still slaughter the pig.

689
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:59,818
Sorry, old chap,
but it is a common fate for your ilk.

690
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,553
I could just bust
through the fence again.

691
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:03,521
No.
Once was enough for that.

692
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,691
I just have to get
the right word written.

693
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,793
Something that makes
Wilbur so special

694
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:10,461
that Zuckerman will never
think about killing him again.

695
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,599
You need something snappy,
like "pig supreme."

696
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,033
That sounds like a dessert.

697
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,002
So, what's the point, anyway?
It won't work.

698
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,638
Could you please,
just once, say

699
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:21,539
something-omething positive?

700
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,375
Okay.
I'm positive it won't work.

701
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,345
How about
"harmoniously proportioned"?

702
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,914
Harmoniously
proportioned, yes!

703
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:31,216
Stop that! Stop that!
You're following again.

704
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:32,618
Please, all of you!

705
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,686
What's the perfect word
for Wilbur?

706
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:36,588
How about "delicious"?

707
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,625
Or "nutritious"?
Or "extra crispy"?

708
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,126
How about...

709
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,494
Did you get him?

710
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:44,963
Yep. Bull's-eye.

711
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,599
How about "terrific,
terrific, terrific"?

712
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,267
Good. Much too long, though.

713
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,902
I've only got so much web.

714
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:53,404
But one "terrific" might work.

715
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,306
It simply isn't true.

716
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,008
The pig is not terrific.

717
00:42:57,108 --> 00:43:00,545
Look at him!
He's absolutely average.

718
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:05,283
If you wish to be truthful, then that is
the word you should write. "Average."

719
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:09,821
Hmm, Wilbur, this only works
if the word I write is true.

720
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,091
And only you can tell us
which word that is.

721
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,526
So look around.

722
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,963
We've all gathered
around to help you.

723
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,899
Now tell everyone
how you feel.

724
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,709
Look, there's a red one!
And a blue one!

725
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,479
Avery!
You'll never catch me!

726
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,848
I'm going to get you!

727
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,086
Look at the fireworks, Mom!

728
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:44,322
Avery,
come on if you ever want to catch me!

729
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,506
This web thing is
really paying off.

730
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:04,009
Mr. Zuckerman!

731
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,480
There it is, side to side,
right in the same place.

732
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,916
"Terrific."

733
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:12,650
It was the most
amazing thing!

734
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,452
Last time we had
hundreds of people.

735
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:16,087
This time it's going
to be thousands!

736
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,824
It says "terrific"
just as clear as day.

737
00:44:18,924 --> 00:44:20,391
T-E-double-R-I-F-I-C.

738
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,128
I mean, can you imagine a spider
being able to spell that word?

739
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:32,137
I don't think I could spell
that word till the 10th grade.

740
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,544
50 cents.
Oh, do you like that one, sir?

741
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:42,580
That's going to be $1.

742
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,116
- Wow!
- Gather 'round, folks!

743
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:49,354
Remember, you saw it
right here at Zuckerman's.

744
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:53,091
And, before you leave, don't forget to
take some of our berries home with you!

745
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,660
- So, you think this might work?
- Nope.

746
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:58,196
Dare I say it?
He looks "terrific."

747
00:44:58,296 --> 00:44:59,364
Look at them all!

748
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:00,866
Yeah. Smile pretty.

749
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:03,001
I wish geese had teeth.

750
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:09,374
Been down here since dawn...

751
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:10,608
What are you suggesting?

752
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,944
That Fern has something
to do with all this?

753
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:16,147
How else could those words
have gotten into that web?

754
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:19,785
I know everyone is saying it's
some kind of miracle, but...

755
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:22,854
But what?
You don't think it is?

756
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,290
Do you?

757
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,860
The web itself is a miracle.

758
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,096
Wouldn't you agree?

759
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,265
Well, can you spin one?

760
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:35,600
I can crochet a doily.

761
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,236
Because someone
taught you how.

762
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:39,204
Nobody teaches a spider.

763
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,572
They just know
how to spin a web.

764
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,909
Don't you think
that's a miracle?

765
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:52,050
As summer ended,
so did the excitement about the web.

766
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,353
Charlotte needed to
think of something special.

767
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:59,624
Special enough to change the
way people saw the world,

768
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:03,061
or at least one pig
in the world, anyway.

769
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,230
The truth is,
Charlotte feared she would

770
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,466
never find a word
that could do all that.

771
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:09,767
And she had to hurry.

772
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:12,770
Time was running out for her.

773
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:17,208
But once a promise is made,
it needs to be kept.

774
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:19,477
Still no web, huh?

775
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:20,411
Nope.

776
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:24,549
I haven't seen one in,
I'd say, at least a month.

777
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:28,319
Funny how you get used to all those
people being around the place.

778
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:30,956
Kind of quiet
without them, isn't it?

779
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,627
I noticed the hinge pin's busted
on the damper in the smokehouse.

780
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,263
Want me to order a new one?

781
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:41,132
Suppose you better.
That's a special order.

782
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,301
Better get a jump on
that if we're going

783
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,236
to smoke any ham
before the holidays.

784
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,805
We may need another
cord of wood, too.

785
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,944
I'm just going to throw this out
here one more time. "Pig supreme."

786
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:55,680
Oh, Golly! Now you're
just beating a dead horse.

787
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,282
- Hey!
- Sorry.

788
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:00,518
Look, I don't come across
many words in the field,

789
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:03,121
other than "Hyah!"
or "Giddyup!"

790
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:06,424
But that rat's always dragging
in trash with writing on it.

791
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:07,525
I agree.

792
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:08,960
It's about time
Templeton started

793
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,428
pulling his weight
around here

794
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:11,729
instead of just eating it.

795
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,431
I bet he could bring us
some choice words.

796
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,566
I've got
a choice word for you.

797
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,768
A little word called,
"Uh-uh."

798
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:18,970
Well, that's two words.

799
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,171
And here's a few more.

800
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:22,941
Negative. No way.
Nothing doing.

801
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,710
I ain't breaking my back
to try and save "some pig,"

802
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:29,447
no matter how "terrific"
you think the little lunch meat is.

803
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:37,989
You'll sing a different
tune when he's gone

804
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:42,027
and nobody brings around those
scrumptious buckets of slop.

805
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:44,595
And three, two...

806
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,531
Cue the rat!

807
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:48,666
Let's get one thing straight.

808
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,403
I don't care about the pig.

809
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:55,073
- What I care about is the slop.
- Of course.

810
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:56,975
And since I'll be
at the dump anyway,

811
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:59,810
and it won't take
any extra effort,

812
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:04,082
maybe, maybe
I'll pick something up.

813
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:06,717
You're very kind.

814
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,886
Don't go spreading it around.

815
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,091
What? What do you want?

816
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,666
You'll need your strength.

817
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,334
Oh.

818
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,039
Thanks.

819
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:32,743
But, Dad, I heard them.

820
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,612
I heard them talking
about the smokehouse!

821
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,081
He's not your pig anymore.

822
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,915
Well, I wouldn't have
sold him in the first place

823
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:39,417
if I knew this is what
they were gonna do to him.

824
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:42,520
That's what happens
to a pig on a farm, Fern.

825
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,390
You know that.

826
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,160
I'll see about that.

827
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:56,434
I've got maybe two,
three years before she can out-argue me.

828
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,003
Then I'm doomed.

829
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:00,405
And members of
our own 4-H Club will have

830
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:04,242
the opportunity to enter livestock
and poultry in the competition.

831
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:07,078
So, in addition to
the rides and games,

832
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:09,780
make sure you show them
your support, as well.

833
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,849
Any questions? Rita.

834
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,784
Miss Lewis,
can I bring my chickens?

835
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,120
Your chickens, I'm sure.

836
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,122
Pigs, chickens,
horses and cows.

837
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:21,426
You certainly can,
and I hope you win first prize.

838
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:32,870
All right, back it up!

839
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,174
How can he be
in every cornfield?

840
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:38,676
It can't be the same guy.
It can't be!

841
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:40,478
He's wearing the same hat.

842
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:43,248
I'm telling you,
he is following us!

843
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:45,216
I hate that guy.

844
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,419
I have got to get
some corn, Elwyn!

845
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,421
All right! All right!
All right! This is crazy.

846
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:52,423
- There's two of us, right?
- Yeah.

847
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:55,160
Trust me, there's two of us,
and there's only one of him.

848
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,063
I...I don't know, man.
He scares me. He really does.

849
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:00,798
- Just think about that corn. Corn.
- Yeah.

850
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:01,899
- The corn.
- Corn.

851
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,268
All right, let's do it!

852
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:05,536
Let's do it! Let's do it!

853
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,109
Abort! Abort! Abort!

854
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:12,877
Abort! Abort! Abort!

855
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,715
Man, he is good!

856
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:18,916
I bet he's laughing at us.

857
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,017
Don't look at him!

858
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:21,819
Don't even give him
the satisfaction.

859
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:23,288
Just think about
something else.

860
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:25,223
- Think about something else.
- Anything.

861
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:27,825
I think I see a rat.

862
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:30,461
- That's good.
- No, really, I see a rat.

863
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:33,631
Oh, the rat is stealthy.
The rat is nimble.

864
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:35,400
The rat is on the... whoa!

865
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,076
The rat is losing his touch.

866
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:46,544
You want to go
mess with him?

867
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,946
Oh, yeah!
I've got to peck something.

868
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,748
Rat on three.

869
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:52,983
One, two, three!

870
00:50:57,288 --> 00:50:59,490
The rat has been spotted!

871
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:08,666
The rat is not
enjoying this!

872
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,407
All this for slop?

873
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:19,644
The rat is desperate.
The rat is trapped.

874
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,347
The rat needs to stop
calling himself "the rat."

875
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:26,717
"Find some words."
Yeah, right, the rat will never find words!

876
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,819
Hey, look. Words.

877
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,658
- Hey, is he still in the can?
- He's in the can?

878
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,827
Maybe we should give him some privacy.
Always helps me out.

879
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,929
No, no, genius,
not that can.

880
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,565
Where did he go?
I can't see him.

881
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:43,268
Uh, all I see is
that fruit moving.

882
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:46,204
- What fruit?
- The fruit with the tail!

883
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:48,206
They'll never get me now.

884
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:52,377
- Let's go get him!
- Go get him!

885
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,328
A-ha! The rat rules!

886
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,398
We're pink!

887
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:15,200
Hey, what the... Pink?

888
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,302
But that's all right,
isn't it?

889
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:19,437
I mean, black pretty much
goes with everything.

890
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:21,071
No, it's not all right.

891
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:22,940
That rat is going to pay!

892
00:52:27,245 --> 00:52:28,346
"Radiant."

893
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:29,580
This might just work.

894
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,017
Might?
Oh, for the love of Lucy!

895
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:36,153
Ooh, ooh, here it comes.

896
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:37,822
It did this yesterday.

897
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:39,190
Look that way, everyone!

898
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,925
Right towards that cloud!

899
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,026
Good gracious.

900
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:43,361
Has it always done that?

901
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:44,995
No, it can't have.

902
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,498
Brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!

903
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,133
Wow!

904
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:50,335
Oh, yes.

905
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:52,837
This word will
work quite nicely.

906
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:55,606
Then my work is done.

907
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,908
And now for
the fruits of my labor.

908
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,545
And the vegetables!
And the gravy!

909
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:28,406
All right, now.

910
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,677
"R."

911
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,316
And stick.

912
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,923
And loop.

913
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:51,896
And...

914
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,766
Come on, Charlotte,
you can do this.

915
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:58,803
Don't slow down yet.

916
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:25,463
Welcome to Zuckerman's!

917
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:27,465
Thank you all for coming.

918
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:30,401
Well, the web says it
better than I ever could.

919
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:34,805
That is some terrific,
radiant pig!

920
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,609
And for that reason,
I've decided to enter

921
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,011
Wilbur into the county fair.

922
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:46,784
Did you hear
what they said, Charlotte?

923
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:48,252
I'm going to the fair!

924
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:49,787
Going to the fair!

925
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:52,256
Wilbur might just see
Christmas after all.

926
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:53,558
Is it good? Did we do it?

927
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:55,960
Yes, Wilbur. It's very good.

928
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,395
Now, smile.

929
00:54:57,495 --> 00:55:00,531
The fair, Homer?
What's gotten into you?

930
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,467
I don't know, Sis.
It just come to me.

931
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:05,169
He's a runt, Homer.
He doesn't stand a chance.

932
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:07,037
Well done!
Never had a doubt!

933
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,506
That spider did
a heck of a job.

934
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:10,307
She's a hard worker.

935
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:11,609
Thank you, Charlotte.

936
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,243
You should take a little bow.

937
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:15,346
And have my beauty
steal the show?

938
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:18,449
Now, go on and show them
what a radiant pig can do.

939
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:32,397
What do you mean
you're not going to the fair?

940
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:34,231
I'm going to get a prize.

941
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,600
Don't you want to be there?

942
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,235
Of course I do, Wilbur,
very much.

943
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,705
I'm just not up to
traveling at the moment.

944
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:41,606
Why not?

945
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,475
Because I'm expecting.

946
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:46,310
Expecting what?

947
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:48,513
"Expecting" means...

948
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:51,348
I'm expecting you
to do fine without me.

949
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,150
You're getting
to be a big pig,

950
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,486
and you'll do
just great on your own.

951
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:57,722
Okay. I'll miss you.

952
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,898
Come on, Homer,
up and at 'em.

953
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:09,567
It's the big day.

954
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:15,506
- Fern?
- Mom!

955
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,576
I'm not wearing that.

956
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:27,452
What the heck is she doing?

957
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,394
Bathed in buttermilk.

958
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,103
I've had this dream.

959
00:56:51,476 --> 00:56:54,779
I've got to say
he really is some pig.

960
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:56,947
That's my buttermilk working.

961
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,249
You sure you want to
go through with this, Homer?

962
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,586
If you lose,
you're out your entry fee.

963
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:02,953
He could win, though.

964
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:05,422
Stranger things have been
happening around here.

965
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:06,824
If he doesn't win, though?

966
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,627
Well, the way I figure it,
even if he does lose,

967
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:11,929
I can make it all back
on the bacon alone.

968
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,001
Wilbur! Wilbur!

969
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,504
Do something, Homer.
What happened?

970
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,071
I don't know.
He just fainted.

971
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,406
It's all right, hon.

972
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:23,974
- Lurvy, get some water!
- It's okay, Wilbur.

973
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:27,912
Charlotte,
are you feeling-eeling okay?

974
00:57:28,012 --> 00:57:30,180
Why is it so hard
for that farmer to see

975
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,282
what is right in
front of his face?

976
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,218
Look what Wilbur
has done for this farm.

977
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:35,653
Isn't that better than ham?

978
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:37,187
Well, there's only
one thing to do,

979
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,489
and I have to be
there to do it.

980
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:41,526
Charlotte,
you have your babies to think about now.

981
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:42,827
Yes, I know.

982
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:44,762
But I made a promise
to my friend.

983
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:46,497
A big blue ribbon
ought to finally get

984
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,265
the point through
that farmer's head.

985
00:57:48,365 --> 00:57:49,433
Easy, Lurvy. Easy.

986
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:50,935
Coming through!
Coming through!

987
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:52,603
Here we go!

988
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:55,606
- There we go.
- He's up.

989
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,675
Okay, let's see
if he'll get in the crate.

990
00:57:57,775 --> 00:58:00,244
Buttermilk.
Templeton?

991
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:01,879
I need you to go with me.

992
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,881
We'll have to
find another word,

993
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,415
a really good one.

994
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:06,851
Sorry, lady.

995
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:09,119
Comes a time when the rat's
got to ask himself,

996
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,020
"What's in it for the rat?"

997
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,623
- He's right. We've been to the fair.
- We have?

998
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,192
Remember?
All that garbage there?

999
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:19,063
Oh, yeah! It's littered with hunks
of chewed-on funnel cakes...

1000
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:19,930
How's that?

1001
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,300
And dribs of ice cream
going sour in the sun.

1002
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:27,638
And spitty little cotton candy
bits ground into the mud.

1003
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:30,474
Popcorn, moldy cheese,
half-eaten sandwiches

1004
00:58:30,575 --> 00:58:32,843
and sticky-icky-icky
candy apples.

1005
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:33,911
W-W-W-Wait!

1006
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,512
Go back to
the moldy cheese thing.

1007
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:37,615
I've never seen
so much disgusting trash!

1008
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:39,617
Come on, Wilbur.
Good boy.

1009
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:40,651
Don't hurt him, Dad!

1010
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:43,921
Nearly made me gag, the stink of it,
especially that deviled egg.

1011
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,390
- You better hurry up, rat. They're gonna leave you!
- Hey, wait for me!

1012
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,025
- Nice and easy.
- Come on, Wilbur. Good boy.

1013
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:52,329
More food than
you'll see in a lifetime!

1014
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,064
- Bye, Aunt Edith!
- Bye.

1015
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,399
Bye, Fern! Bye, Avery!

1016
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:57,401
See you
at the fair, guys!

1017
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:58,803
Hey, it worked!

1018
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:02,907
I think we milked it a little
there at the end, though.

1019
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:05,242
All right. All right, John,
I'll see you over there!

1020
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:07,344
Charlotte,
you're coming with me!

1021
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:09,379
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1022
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,881
Thank you for coming.

1023
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:13,483
Good luck, Wilbur!
Win that ribbon!

1024
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:15,319
Go get 'em, Wilbur!

1025
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:18,923
We're going to the fair!

1026
00:59:23,794 --> 00:59:26,597
* Going to the fair!
Going to the fair! *

1027
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:27,798
I'm going on the bumper cars.

1028
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,033
So fun!

1029
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:43,580
The sign looks good, Homer.

1030
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,482
Nice and even.

1031
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,818
All right, there we go.

1032
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,757
There you go, Wilbur.

1033
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:56,460
Okay, where's the filth?

1034
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,396
Have you heard that good
things come to those who wait?

1035
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:03,801
No, good things come to those who
find it and shove it in their mouth.

1036
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:13,277
Don't think
I don't know, Fern,

1037
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:16,546
that we're all here because
a determined little girl

1038
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:18,783
made a promise to a pig.

1039
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:22,452
- Wilbur.
- Sorry.

1040
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,388
I mean Wilbur.

1041
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:28,392
I'm proud of you, honey.

1042
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:33,998
Thanks.

1043
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,002
Fern? Avery?

1044
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:44,508
I'm going to give you each 10
tickets to do as you like out there.

1045
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:45,876
And you have to
make them last all day,

1046
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,845
so don't go spending them
all at once. Okay?

1047
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:49,747
- Wow!
- All right!

1048
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:52,416
- I'll be right back. Okay.
- Come on!

1049
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:55,119
You're going to win the prize tomorrow.
I know it.

1050
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:57,421
- Everything will be all right.
- Fern, let's go!

1051
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:58,856
Okay.

1052
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:05,562
Oh, my.

1053
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,098
Is that what
we're up against?

1054
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:19,409
Excuse me.
What is your name?

1055
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,982
When someone wants to
get your attention,

1056
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:27,617
what is it they call out?

1057
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:29,319
Uncle.

1058
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:33,057
Tell me, Uncle,
what is the date of your birth?

1059
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:37,527
Your birthday?

1060
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,063
Uh...

1061
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,468
Oh, for heaven's sake,
all I want to know is if you're a spring pig.

1062
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,670
Of course.
What did you think I was?

1063
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:48,572
A spring chicken?

1064
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:54,444
Huge and humorous.
Aren't we talented!

1065
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:57,047
Spring chicken.

1066
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,223
Charlotte,
who are you talking to?

1067
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:07,591
The pig next door.

1068
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:10,094
Oh. Should I be worried?

1069
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:11,295
Of course not.

1070
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:12,662
What good would that do?

1071
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:13,764
Whoa!

1072
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:15,800
Have you seen
the beast next door?

1073
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,268
I think his mama
was part hippo.

1074
01:02:18,368 --> 01:02:20,805
If I had to name five of the
fattest pigs I've ever seen,

1075
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:23,273
he'd be three of them.
He's a shoo-in.

1076
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:26,911
Please.
That pig is not nearly as handsome as Wilbur,

1077
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:29,579
or as harmoniously
proportioned,

1078
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:30,915
and not nearly as clean.

1079
01:02:31,015 --> 01:02:32,149
There's a real tiebreaker.

1080
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,418
We just have to prove
that the finest pig

1081
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:36,386
is not necessarily
the fattest.

1082
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,489
And you can do your part,
Wilbur, by getting some rest.

1083
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,325
I'm not tired, Charlotte.

1084
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:42,326
Okay.

1085
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:45,429
Well, could you excuse me
for just a minute, please?

1086
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:49,099
All right, Templeton,
you're right.

1087
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:50,968
That pig over there
is a shoo-in.

1088
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:54,171
So, I need words that are even
better than that pig is fat.

1089
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,540
Special words,
and lots of them.

1090
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,809
How about "pushy"
and "demanding"?

1091
01:02:58,909 --> 01:03:00,277
Templeton, please!

1092
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:02,980
This is our last chance
to save Wilbur's life.

1093
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,749
You do realize I'm just
here for the food, right?

1094
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,484
Of course.

1095
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,002
Enjoy the ride.

1096
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:26,971
One, please.

1097
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:28,839
Must be in the other pocket.

1098
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:31,008
- Sorry. One second.
- All right.

1099
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:36,580
Two, please.

1100
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,638
Is that Fern up there?

1101
01:04:03,908 --> 01:04:05,442
Well, I'll be.

1102
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:06,543
She's with a boy.

1103
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:08,545
She is! She's with a boy!

1104
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,950
Oh, no.

1105
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:15,986
She's with a boy.

1106
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,489
Mmm, Manna from heaven!

1107
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,598
I don't know what this is,
but I love it!

1108
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:45,749
One-stop slopping.

1109
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,054
All right.

1110
01:04:50,154 --> 01:04:53,557
Let's go get
the spider off my back.

1111
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:55,659
- How come I'm not in a cornfield, Elwyn?
- How come?

1112
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:59,196
Hey, hey.
They got all kinds of corn right here.

1113
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:00,830
You got your popcorn,

1114
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,133
caramel corn, candy corn.

1115
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,401
Stop torturing me!

1116
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,736
I'm starving here,
and now I'm cross-eyed

1117
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,105
because of this pink stuff.

1118
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:10,840
If I ever see
that rat again...

1119
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:14,011
Words, words, words.

1120
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:16,446
Mmm, "Pork rinds."

1121
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:17,714
That'll draw a crowd.

1122
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,153
Hmm, this looks promising.

1123
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,126
Hey! That rat!

1124
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:31,861
I'm going to
get me some rat!

1125
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:34,198
Oh, not these birdbrains.

1126
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:36,000
Let's get rid of them
once and for all.

1127
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,536
...and everything.
Rat on three! Three!

1128
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:42,572
Hey, wait up, Brooksie!
I'm coming with you!

1129
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:49,313
Little flamingoes!

1130
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,682
Come and get me!

1131
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,118
It's scary guy!

1132
01:05:54,218 --> 01:05:56,453
Abort! Abort!

1133
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:00,357
Peck him! Peck him, Elwyn!

1134
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,360
Wait a minute.

1135
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,396
His eyes are buttons,
and his hair is straw.

1136
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:07,531
This guy ain't real!

1137
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,798
- He's not?
- No!

1138
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:12,202
Oh, yeah!
The rat rules! Take that!

1139
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,870
Do you know
what this means?

1140
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,005
- Yeah.
- What?

1141
01:06:15,105 --> 01:06:17,574
We could've had corn!

1142
01:06:20,244 --> 01:06:22,112
Well, Your Highness,
you satisfied or what?

1143
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:24,014
'Cause I've got
a spitty hunk of pineapple

1144
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:25,982
upside-down cake out there
with my name on it.

1145
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:28,218
Yes, very satisfied.

1146
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,054
Be careful.
If you keep this up,

1147
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:32,556
someone might think you care.

1148
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,591
Gee, I'm all choked up.

1149
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,794
Charlotte?

1150
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:39,329
If I don't win
the prize tomorrow,

1151
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,198
they're gonna send me
to the smokehouse.

1152
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:42,899
You're going to win, Wilbur.

1153
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,202
And you're going to see
the snows of winter.

1154
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:48,438
I told you,
I never break a promise.

1155
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,058
Mom?

1156
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:10,427
Will you put these in for me?

1157
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:13,263
Ew!

1158
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,465
You look like a girl!

1159
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:18,102
And I still hit like one.

1160
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,109
Well, what do you think?

1161
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:27,511
It's a great word.
It's just...

1162
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:28,412
Just what?

1163
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:31,915
Is it the right word?
Is it true?

1164
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:33,250
Because I don't
really feel like

1165
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,686
I deserve any of the things
you've written about me.

1166
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:40,724
Then it is the perfect word.

1167
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:46,830
The web!

1168
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:51,368
Hey, Wilbur!

1169
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:57,874
"Humble."

1170
01:07:57,974 --> 01:07:59,008
Hey, Wilbur.

1171
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:02,078
If that's not a prize-winner,
I don't know what is.

1172
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:03,713
He's going to win
this thing, isn't he?

1173
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:07,484
Oh, Homer, I can't go up to that
grandstand looking like this.

1174
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,461
Homer.

1175
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,637
It's not fair.

1176
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:35,345
Why didn't they tell us the
judging was going to be so early?

1177
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,415
We did our best.

1178
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:45,322
I'll get the truck
and take him home.

1179
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:47,791
I really thought
we had a shot.

1180
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:57,401
It's okay. It'll be okay.

1181
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,440
I told you.
There it is! The web!

1182
01:09:04,508 --> 01:09:06,210
Mom...

1183
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:10,347
What's going on?

1184
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,891
It looks like it's "humble."

1185
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,739
Excuse me. Thank you.

1186
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,641
Coming through. Excuse me.

1187
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,443
Mr. Zuckerman!

1188
01:09:39,543 --> 01:09:41,511
Could you come
with me, please?

1189
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:43,947
Oh, and bring the pig, too.

1190
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:47,351
Homer.

1191
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,181
Ladies and gentlemen,

1192
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:20,617
on behalf of
the state of Maine,

1193
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,820
it gives us great
pleasure to present

1194
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,956
Zuckerman's famous pig!

1195
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:34,298
Folks! Folks!

1196
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,966
I think we all remember
the start of summer,

1197
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:42,038
when the writing appeared on the
web in Mr. Zuckerman's barn.

1198
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:45,442
And now it has
happened yet again!

1199
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:48,278
Which is why
the governors of the fair

1200
01:10:48,378 --> 01:10:50,580
are honored to present

1201
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:53,383
this handsome medal.

1202
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:58,054
A token of our amazement
and our appreciation.

1203
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:08,565
I love you, Wilbur.

1204
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,238
Well, what can
I say about this pig

1205
01:11:15,339 --> 01:11:17,507
that hasn't
already been said?

1206
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:21,445
I know a lot of you folks
have come out to the farm,

1207
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:23,413
and you've seen the words.

1208
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:25,482
A lot of you have asked me,

1209
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:27,751
"How could this
have happened?"

1210
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:30,153
I don't know.

1211
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:31,955
But it has happened

1212
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,958
in a time when we really

1213
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:37,927
don't see many
miraculous things.

1214
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,330
Or maybe we do.

1215
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:44,534
Maybe they're all right there around us,
every day,

1216
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,437
and we just don't know
where to look.

1217
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:53,477
There's no denying
that our own little Wilbur,

1218
01:11:53,577 --> 01:11:57,046
he's part of something
that's bigger than all of us.

1219
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,620
And life on that farm

1220
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,723
is just a whole lot
better with him in it.

1221
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:10,860
He really is some pig.

1222
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,396
Way to go, Wilbur!

1223
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:33,517
Charlotte,
look how happy she is!

1224
01:12:33,617 --> 01:12:35,419
Isn't that great?

1225
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:38,154
Yes, it's wonderful.

1226
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:39,889
Hey, what's that?

1227
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:43,527
This is my magnum opus.

1228
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:45,595
What's a magnet opus?

1229
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:48,465
Magnum opus.

1230
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:53,336
It means "great work."
It's a nutrient-filled, waterproof egg sac.

1231
01:12:53,437 --> 01:12:55,405
Really?
There's eggs in there?

1232
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:58,775
My babies, 514 of them.

1233
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:02,979
Wow! With 514 baby spiders
all over the place,

1234
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:05,314
it's going to be
really radiant in the barn!

1235
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:10,119
Wilbur, I'm afraid they're not
going to make it back to the barn.

1236
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,187
What?

1237
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:12,622
What are you talking about?

1238
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,191
You're not going to leave them here alone,
are you?

1239
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:18,361
I have no choice.
I'm languishing.

1240
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:20,329
What does that mean?

1241
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:22,231
It means I'm dying.

1242
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,933
What?

1243
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:25,535
You can't die!

1244
01:13:25,635 --> 01:13:28,672
Wilbur, we're born, we live,

1245
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:31,475
and, when our time comes,
we die.

1246
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:34,343
It's just the natural
cycle of life.

1247
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:36,846
No! No, just climb down.

1248
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:39,549
I'll carry you
the rest of the way.

1249
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:43,019
We'll go back to the barn,
and I'll take care of you.

1250
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:44,420
No, Wilbur.

1251
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:47,390
I don't even have
the strength to climb down.

1252
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:49,258
You have to.

1253
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,327
You've done so much for me!

1254
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,030
And it was my great pleasure.

1255
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,932
Please come down, Charlotte.

1256
01:13:56,032 --> 01:13:58,835
Please. There must be
something I can do.

1257
01:13:58,935 --> 01:13:59,803
No, Wilbur.

1258
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:02,338
Don't you know
what you've already done?

1259
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,207
You made me your friend,

1260
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:06,342
and, in doing so,
you made a spider

1261
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,778
beautiful to everyone
in that barn.

1262
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,448
I didn't do anything,
Charlotte.

1263
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:13,883
You did it all.

1264
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:17,621
No. My webs were
no miracle, Wilbur.

1265
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:21,124
I was only describing
what I saw.

1266
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:24,193
The miracle is you.

1267
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:45,048
Templeton!

1268
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:46,950
Charlotte is very sick.

1269
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,818
Yeah, and twisted.

1270
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:51,955
She's dying!
She can't go home with us.

1271
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:54,558
So, I need you to help me
take her egg sac with us.

1272
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:55,759
Did you say eggs?

1273
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:57,961
It's an egg sac.
And it's right up there,

1274
01:14:58,061 --> 01:14:59,696
and it has her
children in it.

1275
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:01,164
And I can't
just leave it here.

1276
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:02,899
What if something
happened to them?

1277
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:06,302
Now, I can't reach it,
so I need you to get it for me.

1278
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:08,171
And I need you
to do it now.

1279
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:09,405
I don't think
I like your tone.

1280
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:13,509
Can't you just once in your life
think of someone other than yourself?

1281
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:14,978
A little further.
Keep coming.

1282
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:16,780
Once? Once?

1283
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,947
Come on.

1284
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:19,148
No, you come on!

1285
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:22,518
Who got his hindquarters pecked to make you
"radiant," huh?

1286
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:23,953
Templeton, that's who.

1287
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:27,824
And who interrupted the gorging of a
lifetime so you could be "humble"?

1288
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:30,760
Why, I think
it was Templeton!

1289
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,962
Templeton! Templeton!

1290
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:34,430
Templeton!

1291
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,600
And do I get thanked?

1292
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,004
Well, has it ever
occurred to you

1293
01:15:41,104 --> 01:15:44,608
that even a rat might like
a little appreciation?

1294
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:47,443
A little, dare I say, love?

1295
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,780
Do it and you'll get dibs on my
slop for the rest of my life.

1296
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,715
Done.

1297
01:15:51,815 --> 01:15:54,651
Hurry! Up in
the corner on the ledge.

1298
01:15:57,954 --> 01:15:59,155
Oh, boy.

1299
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:00,690
Whew!

1300
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:09,666
Templeton!

1301
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:16,840
Come on!

1302
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:27,784
Thank you, Templeton,

1303
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,154
for everything.

1304
01:16:40,664 --> 01:16:43,132
It's okay,
just drop it. Hurry!

1305
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,305
Here you go.
Here's your medal.

1306
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:50,539
In you go.

1307
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,941
Time to go home, Wilbur.

1308
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:54,978
All right.
Close her up, Lurvy.

1309
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:58,314
Okay, easy now.

1310
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:13,830
Goodbye,

1311
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:16,399
my sweet, sweet Wilbur.

1312
01:17:19,803 --> 01:17:21,838
Goodbye, Charlotte.

1313
01:17:21,938 --> 01:17:23,973
I love you.

1314
01:18:09,986 --> 01:18:13,356
Is that our lovely-ovely-ovely
little Wilbur?

1315
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:14,657
And he's got a medal!

1316
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:15,892
Strong work, kid.

1317
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:17,193
Oh, he looks
so grown up.

1318
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:19,996
- I always knew he could do it.
- Never had a doubt.

1319
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:22,131
Welcome home, Wilbur.

1320
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:25,902
Wilbur?

1321
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:27,470
Where's Charlotte?

1322
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,605
I got
a bad feeling, Bits.

1323
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,440
Me, too.

1324
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:32,501
Now, that isn't to say
Charlotte was gone forever.

1325
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,571
She lived on in the hearts
of those that knew her,

1326
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:38,241
and even those that didn't.

1327
01:19:38,341 --> 01:19:41,610
Something had changed
in Somerset County.

1328
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:46,315
It was as if people knew they
lived in a special place now.

1329
01:19:46,415 --> 01:19:50,954
And, in small ways,
they started being special people,

1330
01:19:51,054 --> 01:19:53,089
a little bit kinder,

1331
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:56,192
a bit more understanding.

1332
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:59,262
And the animals
felt different, too.

1333
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:01,230
Closer.

1334
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,499
The warmth of their
friendship carried them

1335
01:20:03,599 --> 01:20:06,302
through the long,
cold months.

1336
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:09,605
They showed it in little
gestures of kindness,

1337
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:11,340
unusual patience,

1338
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:13,843
and promises kept.

1339
01:20:16,012 --> 01:20:17,246
Even the hardest of hearts

1340
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:19,983
found themselves
rising to the occasion.

1341
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:32,161
And, finally,
the greatest promise of all,

1342
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:37,200
a spring pig saw
his first snowfall.

1343
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:41,470
It was as though Charlotte herself
had shaken it out of the sky.

1344
01:21:12,936 --> 01:21:14,770
The stillness of
winter continued

1345
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,306
to the first thaw,
like it always does.

1346
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,344
And then,
the first buds of spring.

1347
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:27,650
And, before you knew it,
life had come full circle.

1348
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:44,767
They're here! They're here!

1349
01:21:44,867 --> 01:21:46,869
They're here, everybody!

1350
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,537
Hey, there. I'm Wilbur.

1351
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,906
I'm a friend of your mom's.

1352
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,709
Boy, are we glad to see you!

1353
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:59,115
Ew, so creepy!

1354
01:21:59,215 --> 01:22:01,217
And cute!
Just like their mother.

1355
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:04,687
They're so, so beautiful.

1356
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:08,591
Oh, I just want to scoop
them up and hug them all.

1357
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:11,394
Wow, you can fly!

1358
01:22:11,494 --> 01:22:13,362
Look at you go!

1359
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:15,231
Whee!

1360
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,569
Whee!

1361
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:25,174
Whee!

1362
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:29,012
Now that is
something to follow.

1363
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:32,982
Whee! Whee!

1364
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:36,452
Go, little spiders!
Be free! I wish I could.

1365
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:38,854
I'm kidding, honey.
- Mmm-hmm.

1366
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,390
I think I got one
inside my beak. Ah!

1367
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,858
Thanks, baby.

1368
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,328
That's my Golly-olly-olly.

1369
01:22:45,428 --> 01:22:46,895
Wow!

1370
01:22:46,996 --> 01:22:48,597
I can't believe
they're really here.

1371
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,633
So pretty.

1372
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:52,468
Yeah, Bits.

1373
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:54,570
You doing okay
over there, Ike?

1374
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,973
I...I...I'm okay with it.
I'm okay with it, Bets.

1375
01:22:58,074 --> 01:23:00,276
I'm okay with it.

1376
01:23:00,376 --> 01:23:03,979
Spiders are nice.
Spiders are my friend.

1377
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:06,982
Spiders won't hurt me.

1378
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:17,460
Wait! What's happening?

1379
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,427
What are you doing?

1380
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,563
- Bye!
- Bye!

1381
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:22,165
Please don't go.

1382
01:23:22,265 --> 01:23:24,533
- Goodbye! Bye!
- Wait! Wait!

1383
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,204
Goodbye!

1384
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:31,140
Where are you going?

1385
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,675
We're setting forth.

1386
01:23:32,775 --> 01:23:34,677
We take to the breeze.

1387
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:36,812
We go as we please.

1388
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:38,847
We take to the breeze!

1389
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:39,882
Bye!

1390
01:23:39,982 --> 01:23:42,151
But you can't go!

1391
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:45,020
I had so much
I wanted to tell you!

1392
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:49,258
And someone I wanted
to tell you about.

1393
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:59,068
- Salutations!
- Huh?

1394
01:23:59,168 --> 01:24:01,070
- Who said that?
- I'm up here.

1395
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:03,206
- So am I.
- Me, too.

1396
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:05,074
We'd like to stay.

1397
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:07,210
We like it here.

1398
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,977
And we like you, too.

1399
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:11,980
You're staying?
Oh, that's great!

1400
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:13,982
That's really, really great!

1401
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:16,885
Three friends!
What are your names?

1402
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:20,356
I'll tell you my name if you'll
tell me why you're trembling.

1403
01:24:20,456 --> 01:24:23,259
Oh, well, I think
I'm trembling with joy.

1404
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:25,060
Then my name is Joy.

1405
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:26,362
Joy? Perfect.

1406
01:24:26,462 --> 01:24:28,531
What was
my mom's middle initial?

1407
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:29,665
A.

1408
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:32,067
Then my name is Aranea.

1409
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:34,103
Wow! Great name!

1410
01:24:34,203 --> 01:24:36,071
Why don't you
pick my name for me?

1411
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:37,406
Something sensible.

1412
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:39,875
Not too long, not too fancy.

1413
01:24:39,975 --> 01:24:41,277
Oh, and not too dumb.

1414
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:44,613
Hmm, tricky. How about

1415
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:46,982
Nellie?

1416
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:50,286
Nellie? I like it. Well done!

1417
01:24:50,386 --> 01:24:52,921
Joy, Aranea, Nellie,

1418
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,358
you have chosen
a hallowed doorway

1419
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:57,860
in which to spin your webs.

1420
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,928
This was your
mother's doorway.

1421
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:03,199
She was loyal,
brilliant, beautiful,

1422
01:25:03,299 --> 01:25:04,933
and she was my friend.

1423
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:07,670
I will treasure
her memory forever.

1424
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:12,608
So, to you, her daughters,
I pledge my friendship.

1425
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:13,942
I pledge mine!

1426
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:16,111
- I do, too!
- So do I!

1427
01:25:26,189 --> 01:25:29,625
Okay, I'd like to make
a couple of announcements.

1428
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:30,726
First of all,

1429
01:25:30,826 --> 01:25:32,561
if you gals are word-lovers,

1430
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:35,831
and you need a few scraps
of paper for inspiration,

1431
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:37,833
don't look at me.

1432
01:25:37,933 --> 01:25:41,036
My word-fetching days
are over.

1433
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,239
I'm not the rat
I used to be.

1434
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:45,107
I'm at least twice that.

1435
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:49,378
So, if you need something to write,
try this,

1436
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:52,681
"Some rat." Some rat.

1437
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:53,849
Think about it.

1438
01:25:53,949 --> 01:25:57,019
Slops! Oh, yeah!

1439
01:26:01,557 --> 01:26:04,193
And, in an ordinary barn,

1440
01:26:04,293 --> 01:26:09,064
an ordinary pig,
a runt no less,

1441
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,434
stood surrounded by friends,

1442
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:16,705
welcoming his second spring.

1443
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:20,609
And that spring was followed by many,
many more.

1444
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:24,613
All because someone
stopped to see the grace

1445
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:29,318
and beauty and nobility
of the humblest creature.

1446
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:34,189
That is
the miracle of friendship.

1447
01:26:35,324 --> 01:26:37,125
It is not often that
someone comes along

1448
01:26:37,226 --> 01:26:40,363
who is a true friend
and a good writer.

1449
01:26:41,497 --> 01:26:43,866
Charlotte was both.

1450
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:18,066
* It's not that unusual

1451
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:21,670
* When everything is beautiful

1452
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:28,777
* It's just another
ordinary miracle today

1453
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:32,548
* The sky knows
when it's time to snow

1454
01:27:32,648 --> 01:27:36,251
* Don't need to teach
a seed to grow

1455
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:43,292
* It's just another
ordinary miracle today

1456
01:27:44,126 --> 01:27:47,363
* Life is like a gift they say

1457
01:27:47,463 --> 01:27:50,766
* Wrapped up for you every day

1458
01:27:51,467 --> 01:27:54,870
* Open up and find a way

1459
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:59,274
* To give some of your own

1460
01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:03,579
* Isn't it remarkable?

1461
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:07,115
* Like every time
a rain drop falls

1462
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:13,856
* It's just another
ordinary miracle today

1463
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:18,160
* Birds in winter
have their fling

1464
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:21,630
* But always make it
home by spring

1465
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:28,671
* It's just another
ordinary miracle today

1466
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:32,808
* When you wake up every day

1467
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:36,712
* Please don't throw
your dreams away

1468
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:40,115
* Hold them close
to your heart

1469
01:28:40,215 --> 01:28:43,118
* Cause we're all a part

1470
01:28:43,218 --> 01:28:48,991
* Of the ordinary miracle

1471
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:59,735
* Ordinary miracle

1472
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:06,942
* And you'll always
see a miracle

1473
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:23,559
* It seems so exceptional

1474
01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:27,229
* That things just
work out after all

1475
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:34,770
* It's just another
ordinary miracle today

1476
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:38,306
* Sun comes up
and shines so bright

1477
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:41,544
* Disappears again at night

1478
01:29:41,644 --> 01:29:48,684
* It's just another
ordinary miracle today

1479
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:52,821
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

1480
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:56,158
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

1481
01:29:56,258 --> 01:30:00,228
* It's just another ordinary

1482
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:05,934
* Miracle today

1483
01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:26,722
* There's a place in the sun

1484
01:30:26,822 --> 01:30:30,693
* Where there's hope
for everyone

1485
01:30:30,793 --> 01:30:38,601
* Where my poor restless
heart's gotta run

1486
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:42,471
* There's a place in the sun

1487
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:46,374
* And before my life is done

1488
01:30:46,475 --> 01:30:53,682
* Gotta find me
a place in the sun

1489
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:58,220
* Like a long lonely stream

1490
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:02,357
* I keep runnin'
toward a dream

1491
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:06,128
* Movin' on

1492
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:10,198
* Movin' on

1493
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:14,102
* Like a branch on a tree

1494
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:18,006
* I keep reachin' to be free

1495
01:31:18,106 --> 01:31:21,409
* Movin' on

1496
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:25,748
* Movin' on

1497
01:31:25,848 --> 01:31:29,618
* There's a place in the sun

1498
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:33,589
* Where there's hope
for everyone

1499
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:39,995
* Where my poor restless
heart's gotta run

1500
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:41,530
* Gotta run

1501
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:45,467
* There's a place in the sun

1502
01:31:45,568 --> 01:31:49,404
* And before my life is done

1503
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:57,279
* Gotta find me
a place in the sun

1504
01:31:57,379 --> 01:32:01,349
* Like an old dusty road

1505
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:05,287
* I get weary from the load

1506
01:32:05,387 --> 01:32:08,123
* Movin' on

1507
01:32:09,091 --> 01:32:11,927
* Movin' on

1508
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:16,899
* Like this tired
troubled earth

1509
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:21,036
* I've been rollin'
since my birth

1510
01:32:21,136 --> 01:32:24,907
* Movin' on

1511
01:32:25,007 --> 01:32:28,744
* Movin' on

1512
01:32:28,844 --> 01:32:32,648
* There's a place in the sun

1513
01:32:32,748 --> 01:32:36,585
* Where there's hope
for everyone

1514
01:32:36,685 --> 01:32:42,557
* Where my poor restless
heart's gotta run

1515
01:32:42,658 --> 01:32:44,526
* Gotta run

1516
01:32:44,627 --> 01:32:48,430
* There's a place in the sun

1517
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:52,367
* And before my life is done

1518
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:59,942
* Gotta find me
a place in the sun

1519
01:33:00,042 --> 01:33:05,180
* When times are bad
and you're feeling sad

1520
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,383
* Always remember that

1521
01:33:08,483 --> 01:33:11,887
* There's a place in the sun

1522
01:33:11,987 --> 01:33:15,891
* Where there's hope
for everyone

1523
01:33:15,991 --> 01:33:22,030
* Where my poor restless
heart's gotta run

1524
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,899
* Gotta run

1525
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:27,803
* There's a place in the sun

1526
01:33:27,903 --> 01:33:31,707
* And before my life is done

1527
01:33:31,807 --> 01:33:38,446
* Gotta find me
a place in the sun

1528
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:39,815
* Oh, yes

1529
01:33:39,915 --> 01:33:45,053
* Gonna find me
a place in the sun *
