1
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,819
Sierra Leone, 1999

2
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,425
Civil war rages for control
of the diamond fields.

3
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:44,985
Thousands have died
and millions have become refugees.

4
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:49,060
None of whom has ever seen a diamond.

5
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:05,023
Dia.

6
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:08,298
Don't want to be late.

7
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,184
English boys don't go
to school every day.

8
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:15,104
Every day. Just like you.

9
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,466
So you can become a doctor,
not mend the nets like your father...

10
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:21,737
Now get out of bed before I tan your
behind with my fishing rod.

11
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:27,464
You listen to your father.

12
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:32,868
And be careful on the road.

13
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:42,103
Teacher say this country
was founded as a utopia.

14
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,703
Do you know
what that word means, Papa?

15
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:47,144
Well, she says someday
when the war is over...

16
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:49,618
...our world will be a paradise.

17
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,064
And all this you learn in one day?

18
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,265
And math and science.

19
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:55,982
This is too much learning.

20
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:58,299
Tomorrow, you will stay home
and mend the nets?

21
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,584
No, Papa.

22
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:01,944
What? So now you want
to go to school every day?

23
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:35,458
- Stay.
- Papa.

24
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:36,948
- Stay!
- Papa!

25
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,058
Jassie!

26
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,022
Solomon.

27
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,108
Come, come, come.

28
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,899
Pick it up. Quick.

29
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,223
- Papa! Papa!
- Jassie.

30
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,142
- Dia, run!
- Papa!

31
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:49,023
- Papa! Papa!
- Dia, run!

32
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,225
Papa!

33
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,700
Bring forward the next one. Bastard.

34
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:10,461
Bring forward the next one.

35
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,384
- Long sleeve or short sleeve?
- No.

36
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:18,221
Young man. You must understand.

37
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,949
The government
wants you to vote, okay?

38
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:24,624
They gonna tell you say,
"The future is in your hands."

39
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,939
We now the future.

40
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,622
So we take your hands.

41
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:31,098
- No.
- No more hands, no more voting.

42
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,463
Chop him.

43
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:41,777
Spread the word. The Revolutionary
United Front is coming.

44
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:47,387
- RUF!
- RUF! RUF!

45
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,664
Bring forward the next one.
Bring him forward. Bring him forward.

46
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,265
Long sleeve or short sleeve?

47
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,062
- Short sleeve!
- Chop him.

48
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,501
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

49
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,142
Not this one. Look at him.

50
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:08,588
- Put him in the truck.
- Let's go.

51
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:10,068
Bring him to the mines.

52
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,299
He can work. He can work.
Move, move, move.

53
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:13,538
Next one, next one, next one.

54
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:21,019
<i>Throughout the history of Africa...</i>

55
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,623
...whenever a substance
of value is found...

56
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:25,698
G8 Conference on Diamonds
Antwerp, Belgium

57
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:28,142
...the locals die
in great number and in misery.

58
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:33,787
Now, this was true of ivory,
rubber, gold and oil.

59
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:35,266
It is now true of diamonds.

60
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:40,703
<i>According to a devastating report</i>
<i>by Global Witness...</i>

61
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:45,497
<i>... these stones are being used</i>
<i>to purchase arms and finance civil war.</i>

62
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,340
We must act to prohibit...

63
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:52,659
...the direct or indirect import of all
rough diamonds from conflict zones.

64
00:06:58,987 --> 00:06:59,976
<i>May I remind you...</i>

65
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:01,626
...that the U.S. Is responsible...

66
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:04,859
...for two-thirds of
all diamond purchases worldwide...

67
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:08,497
<i>... and I don 't anticipate</i>
<i>that demand diminishing.</i>

68
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:10,779
<i>We must remember</i>
<i>that these stones...</i>

69
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:15,737
<i>... comprise only a small percentage</i>
<i>of the legitimate diamond industry...</i>

70
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:20,537
...whose trade is crucial to the
economies of many emerging nations.

71
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,858
The Freetown government
and their white masters...

72
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,541
...have raped your land
to feed their greed.

73
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,698
RUF have freed you.

74
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:32,064
- No more slave and master here.
- <i>It's true.</i>

75
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:34,263
Current estimates
are that conflict stones...

76
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:37,146
...account for only 15 percent
of the market.

77
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:39,582
But in a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry...

78
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:42,705
...that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available...

79
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,698
...for weapons in these conflict zones.

80
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:47,222
RUF is fighting for the people!

81
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:50,026
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

82
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:54,863
Any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond, I go cut he throat.

83
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:58,056
Stop!

84
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:03,266
And we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry...

85
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:06,944
...who wholeheartedly
endorse your proposal.

86
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:10,622
I hope you join me
in applauding their presence here.

87
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:13,904
Mr. Van De Kaap and Mr. Simmons.

88
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,059
Give it to me.

89
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:59,418
Don't worry. We'll be fine, huh?

90
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:03,739
Listen. You take off
as soon as I'm out the door.

91
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,262
You don't land
until I raise you on the sat phone.

92
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:08,981
You be careful, Danny.

93
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:13,504
Don't worry. They want these guns
too much to do anything stupid.

94
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:28,698
Where is Commander Zero?

95
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,857
I am Captain Rambo.

96
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:37,098
Right. Right, I've seen your films, huh?

97
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,496
I'm looking for Commander Zero, huh?

98
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,419
He's inside. You talk to me.

99
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,420
You are here to help us
in our struggle against the government.

100
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,055
I'm here to do business
with Commander Zero, all right?

101
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:07,146
All right.

102
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:11,380
You are the man, huh?
You are the man.

103
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,541
Here, huh?

104
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:29,940
Hey. I'm talking to you! Stop!

105
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,063
- Commander Zero.
- Hey.

106
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:34,787
- I go kill you, eh?
- It's fine, huh? It's fine.

107
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:38,462
Commander Zero. Commander Zero.

108
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:41,505
Mr. Archer, come here.

109
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:49,935
You get something for me?

110
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,575
And yourself get something for me, huh?

111
00:10:52,947 --> 00:10:53,982
First you bring back the plane.

112
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:56,866
Are you craze?
You get for pay me first for them.

113
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:16,026
This no fine, huh?

114
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:17,506
This no fine.

115
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:19,106
That's all you get!

116
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:24,058
Then your boys can use those crummy
AK's against the government's troops...

117
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:25,626
...and their new weapons, huh?

118
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:27,982
Maybe I could kill you
and take what you bring.

119
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,978
Then you get one more dead body...

120
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,707
...instead of airplane
way full with grenade launchers.

121
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,743
So I'm think I'm gonna go
to them government.

122
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:38,216
Them government,
at least them go pay me, huh?

123
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:41,140
Wait, wait. Wait, my friend.

124
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:47,222
This is the thing you want? Here.

125
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,457
So many I not know
what to do with them all.

126
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:52,985
Hey, Archer, next time,
you bring satellite TV, eh?

127
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,786
- I wanna see <i>Baywatch.</i>
- Yeah.

128
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:57,346
Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:21,780
Hello, hello, hello.

130
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,779
Papers, please.

131
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:27,098
Danny Archer, <i>National Geographic.</i>

132
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:31,575
You crossing into Liberia.

133
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:35,262
I've got a letter from the minister
of interior and a Liberian visa as well.

134
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:37,782
I'm doing a story on the Marrakaz,
who, as you know...

135
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:41,144
...are allowed to cross the border
in order to get into grazing grounds.

136
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:43,543
You ever read <i>National Geographic,</i> huh?

137
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:25,462
- You're under arrest for smuggling.
- No, no, no.

138
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:28,221
Listen here, my friend.
Listen here, all right?

139
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,742
I am good friends
with Colonel Coetzee.

140
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:35,021
Colonel Coetzee would not be pleased
that you've interfered with his business.

141
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:36,859
Now, you know who I am, all right?

142
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,746
You don't wanna make trouble for me
or my friends, all right?

143
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:43,456
Now, look, why don't I just
look the other way, all right?

144
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:47,097
You take one or two of those stones
and get something lacquer for the wife...

145
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:50,942
...or maybe the mistress, all right?
We'll solve the problem right here, huh?

146
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:54,261
We'll go back to Freetown
and ask Colonel Coetzee...

147
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:57,305
...how he wishes
to thank his business associate.

148
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,059
Guys, take him away.

149
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,942
Hey! What the fuck?
What's going on there?

150
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,904
Come on! Fix that shit now!

151
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:51,184
Wasting my time here!
What in the shit is that?

152
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:54,865
Fuck that stuff! Fix that shit!
Damn, now need to work.

153
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,858
- Can't work. What's going on there?
- Boss.

154
00:14:57,027 --> 00:14:59,780
- Fix that thing.
- I wanna go toilet. I must go now, now.

155
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:03,098
- I can't hold it in, boss.
- Go, go.

156
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:05,338
Get to work. Go to work, go to work.

157
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:09,420
Fuckheads wasting my time now.
How am I work in this shit?

158
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:15,906
Stop!

159
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:19,738
Spread your fingers.

160
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,220
Open.

161
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,699
Make it quick.

162
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:14,785
Give it to me.

163
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:18,905
Give it to me.

164
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,464
The government troops are coming!

165
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,696
Go, go, go...!

166
00:16:58,467 --> 00:16:59,786
No, no, no!

167
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:02,541
No! I'm not a rebel!

168
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:06,302
I am not a rebel! I am not R.U.F.!

169
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:42,220
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!</i>

170
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:46,141
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!</i>
<i>RUF is coming!</i>

171
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:50,300
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!</i>
<i>RUF is coming!</i>

172
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:54,540
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!</i>
<i>RUF is coming!</i>

00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,858
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

174
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,700
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

175
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,176
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

176
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:10,702
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

177
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,661
Hey.

178
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:20,144
What did you do with it?

179
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,343
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

180
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:26,784
Where the diamond? The pink one.

181
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:29,586
- I saw you take it.
- You're mad. I do not know you.

182
00:18:29,747 --> 00:18:33,501
Liar! I saw it with my own eyes.

183
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:38,135
This big. Biggest I have ever seen.

184
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:42,698
My brothers, I go give $ 1000...

185
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:46,177
...to the man who cuts the diamond
out of this bastard.

186
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:49,657
You the craze! You the craze!

187
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,419
Where is the diamond?

188
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:54,624
Where is the diamond?
Do you see a diamond?

189
00:18:55,667 --> 00:19:00,343
You devils have taken my family!
My home! I done lost everything!

190
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:04,503
Here, look. What is left?

191
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,464
What is left?

192
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:09,187
If there is a diamond,
you are the one who has taken it!

193
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,258
Liar! The man is a liar!

194
00:19:11,907 --> 00:19:15,502
I know your name, Solomon Vandy!
You have a name!

195
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:19,580
You have a family!
And I'll catch them!

196
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:21,499
And I'll find them!

197
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,667
Please tell me you brought me
cigarettes, <i>bru,</i> please.

198
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:42,180
I just have to tell you, Danny.

199
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,259
The colonel's not going to be happy
about you losing the diamonds.

200
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:48,180
Forget the colonel.
There's a fisherman in there, all right?

201
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,861
He might've found a pink. Big one.

202
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:53,063
What about the colonel?
He'll want that stone.

203
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:55,582
Screw the colonel.
I'll contact our friends in London.

204
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:59,422
If this stone is as big as I think,
we're gonna need a real buyer, all right?

205
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,580
What? What?

206
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,341
London wants nothing more
to do with you.

207
00:20:05,827 --> 00:20:09,820
"Arrest in Sierra Leone of Daniel Archer,
former mercenary and smuggler..."

208
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:12,547
"Retains close ties
to Van De Kaap diamond cartel.

209
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:15,699
Sources say they deny
any affiliation whatso..."

210
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:17,858
Fucking hell.

211
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:21,303
Listen, his name
is Solomon Vandy, all right?

212
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:24,982
Van De Kaap is gonna want that stone,
whatever they say. You just get him out.

213
00:20:25,147 --> 00:20:26,660
Get him out.

214
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:34,263
Yeah, can you tell Mr. Simmons
that Danny Archer called. Right.

215
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:38,262
Archer. A-R-C-H-E-R.

216
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,019
Afternoon, darling, huh?

217
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:06,941
Big white man all alone.
That is no fine.

218
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:11,385
- I'm safe, huh? No HIV.
- Yeah, yeah. I've heard that one before.

219
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:14,664
Archer, I know where to get
nice baby diamond just for you.

220
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:16,658
- Not now, next time.
- Come on, Archer.

221
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,022
I said not now, next time. Bugger off.

222
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,824
Solomon Vandy?

223
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:13,584
What do you want?

224
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,500
It seems you made a friend in prison.

225
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,697
- Hey.
- How the body, Mr. Archer?

226
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,585
The body fine, M'Ed.

227
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:51,259
So you want something nice, huh?

228
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:54,506
The best you can get ahold of, all right?

229
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:58,057
Take me a few days,
but I go find you something special.

230
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:00,946
All right. You hear
they took Marampa yesterday?

231
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:03,506
- Really?
- Now, come on.

232
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,227
You know every move they make.
When are they gonna hit us?

233
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:10,619
Oh, I imagine they come
do some shopping very soon.

234
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:13,904
Yeah, yeah.
Got any smokes back there?

235
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,580
Yeah.

236
00:23:24,347 --> 00:23:26,019
Who's that, huh?

237
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:28,746
All right.

238
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:38,537
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks.

239
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:40,300
You listening to this?

240
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:42,822
<i>I am profoundly sorry.</i>

241
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:46,423
The world is falling apart,
and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.

242
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:48,376
<i>I believe he's sorry.</i>

243
00:23:48,547 --> 00:23:51,823
When was the last time the world
wasn't falling apart, huh?

244
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:57,502
A cynic. Why don't you sit down
and make me miserable?

245
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:02,023
- Danny Archer.
- Maddy Bowen.

246
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:03,905
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

247
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:06,622
- American, huh?
- Guilty.

248
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:08,937
Well, Americans usually are.

249
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:11,696
Says the white South African?

250
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:14,618
I'm from Rhodesia.

251
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,776
We say Zimbabwe now,
don't we?

252
00:24:18,947 --> 00:24:22,064
- Do we?
- Last time I checked.

253
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,297
Don't tell me,
you're here to make a difference.

254
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:27,584
- And you're here to make a buck?
- I'm here for lack of a better idea.

255
00:24:28,387 --> 00:24:30,105
- That's a shame.
- Not really.

256
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:32,417
Peace Corps types only
stay around long enough...

257
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:34,418
...to realize they're not helping anyone.

258
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:36,384
Government only wants
to stay in power...

259
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:39,300
...until they've stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else.

260
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:41,981
And the rebels, they're not sure
they want to take over.

261
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,377
Otherwise,
they'd have to govern this mess.

262
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:46,777
- But TIA, right, M'Ed?
- TIA.

263
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:48,096
What's TIA?

264
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:52,461
- "This is Africa," huh?
- Right.

265
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:55,382
- You want another?
- Sure.

266
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:01,461
So which one are you?

267
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,984
- Smuggler?
- Am I?

268
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:08,980
Somehow you don't strike me
as the UNICEF type.

269
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:11,864
How about soldier of fortune?

270
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:14,775
Or is that too much of a cliché?

271
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,221
Diamonds?

272
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:20,337
- Lf I told you I was a missionary...?
- For Van De Kaap?

273
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,455
Better watch that type of talk,
Miss Bowen.

274
00:25:24,627 --> 00:25:27,585
In America, it's bling-bling,
but out here, it's bling-bang, huh?

275
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:30,859
I wouldn't want you
getting in any trouble.

276
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:34,262
How much trouble
do you think I would get into...

277
00:25:34,427 --> 00:25:37,544
...for talking about blood diamonds?

278
00:25:40,227 --> 00:25:43,185
- You're a journalist.
- That's right.

279
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:48,505
Piss off, huh?

280
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,784
For five years, this country has reported
almost no diamond exports...

281
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:59,462
...while Liberia, right next door,
has exported 2 billion dollars' worth.

282
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:02,505
Very odd, considering that Liberia
has no diamonds to speak of.

283
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:03,656
I'm shocked.

284
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:07,024
Van De Kaap denies trading blood
diamonds, but admits it's impossible...

285
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:11,339
...to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught.

286
00:26:11,507 --> 00:26:13,145
What do you want from me, huh?

287
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:17,664
You know all about Van De Kaap.
Help me out. Off the record.

288
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:22,145
Well, off the record, I like to get kissed
before I get fucked, huh?

289
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:25,742
Shit.

290
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:01,103
- Cordell. How is it, Shona?
- Long time, pal.

291
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:04,498
- How's Alice?
- She's well, thanks.

292
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:06,419
Tim must be in school, right?

293
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:08,817
- Big kids, big problems, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

294
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:11,455
I heard you got into a spot of trouble
in the bush, huh?

295
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:13,936
Well, you know the bush, right, <i>bru?</i>

296
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,135
- Company doing well?
- Can't complain.

297
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:19,821
Eleven wars in the continent.
We're keeping busy.

298
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:22,296
So, what, you're here on holiday, huh?

299
00:27:23,947 --> 00:27:25,778
- How's the colonel?
- He sends his regards.

300
00:27:25,947 --> 00:27:29,496
Good, good. Score us a loose, huh?

301
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:32,663
Smoking will kill you, <i>bru.</i>

302
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:34,101
Only if I live, right?

303
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:41,024
That's for breaking my TV, <i>bru.</i>

304
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:49,097
Tell the colonel he'll get his money.
I'll come see him soon.

305
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:56,736
Ten more.

306
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:59,705
Come. Come.

307
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:06,980
Go on.

308
00:28:20,587 --> 00:28:24,375
Dia. Dia. Come here.
Get away from there.

309
00:28:24,947 --> 00:28:27,507
Go. Go, Mama.

310
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,498
Stay down.

311
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:34,540
Please...

312
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:37,660
I must talk to someone. My family's
name is not on the list.

313
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:39,266
Go to Kissy, there is another list.

314
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:41,545
I have been to Kissy, and Waterloo, and
Port Loko, and...

315
00:28:41,947 --> 00:28:43,903
Talk to the whites.

316
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:48,499
Excuse me,
my name's Solomon Vandy...

317
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,658
- Check the list.
- I have checked the list.

318
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:55,105
- File papers at the Office for Refugees.
- Sir, I have filed papers with the office.

319
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,178
Then God help you,
because I can't.

320
00:28:57,347 --> 00:28:58,382
- Please, sir...
- Next.

321
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:00,583
- Sir... Sir, no, please.
- Hey, hey. Me, me, me.

322
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:04,376
Husband here. One year we look.

323
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,777
Hurry, Mom. Go.

324
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:16,975
Dia! Dia!

325
00:29:17,147 --> 00:29:18,136
- Jassie!
- Dia!

326
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:19,865
- Mama!
- Dia!

327
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:22,097
Jassie! Mama!

328
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:37,826
Cape Town,
South Africa

329
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:46,146
He's been waiting.
What took you?

330
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:50,058
What are you gonna do,
shoot me right here, huh, Shona?

331
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:53,185
Now, don't be a wanker, man. Get in.

332
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,256
- Hello, Danny.
- Colonel.

333
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:28,145
You look well.

334
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:31,344
Clean living and a pure heart,
I suppose, huh?

335
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,305
Walk with me.

336
00:30:34,987 --> 00:30:37,706
It seems the rebels have taken back
the diamond fields, Danny.

337
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:40,097
The government
of Sierra Leone has contracted us...

338
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:42,144
...to go in there
and take the rebels down.

339
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,865
So you sell the rebels weapons...

340
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:46,541
...the government hires you
when they use them? Nice, sir.

341
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:49,780
I assume you're asking
for mining concessions, huh?

342
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:52,939
We save the government,
they show their gratitude.

343
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:55,302
And you get rich, right?

344
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:00,940
How long have I known you, Danny?

345
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:04,384
I was... I was 19, sir.

346
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:08,984
And you survived.
A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?

347
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,867
Just lucky, I guess.

348
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:19,383
No, you were a good soldier.
But I made you better, didn't I?

349
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:23,980
Yes, sir. Yes, you did.

350
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:27,059
And over the years,
didn't I protect you...

351
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:31,261
...teach you about diamonds,
cut you in on the deals?

352
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:34,897
- Some might call it that, yeah.
- But not you...

353
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:39,382
...because you done with me now, eh?
On to bigger things.

354
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:44,742
I need a man that knows
his way around up there.

355
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:48,536
Unless, of course,
you wanna cut me in. Something pink?

356
00:31:49,547 --> 00:31:51,026
Sir...

357
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:53,223
Our deal went bad,
and you owe me money.

358
00:31:53,387 --> 00:31:55,059
I'll take a stone as payment.

359
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:58,936
Look, do you think if I found a stone
like that, I'd still be on this continent?

360
00:31:59,107 --> 00:32:02,782
- Come on.
- Danny, give me your hand.

361
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:09,216
That's red earth. It's in our skin.

362
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,976
The Shona say the color
comes from all the blood...

363
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:14,615
...that's being spilled
fighting over the land.

364
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:20,938
This is home.
You'll never leave Africa.

365
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:26,147
If you say so, sir.

366
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:44,542
So, what did you do, bury it?

367
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:49,103
Yeah. Yeah, I would have
buried it, huh?

368
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,146
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on, <i>bru.</i>

369
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,660
I'm late for work.

370
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:57,261
Pink, huh? The biggest one
he'd ever seen.

371
00:32:57,427 --> 00:32:59,463
You were in the mining camps,
weren't you, <i>bru?</i>

372
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:02,983
Why else would that rebel with
the bandaged eye make up such a story?

373
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,297
Go ask him.

374
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:20,142
Thank you.

375
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:32,140
Your mothers and fathers,
your brothers and sisters are dead.

376
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:34,104
- You are dead! You have been reborn.
- No!

377
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:37,339
- We are your family now.
- No! No!

378
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:47,137
Your parents are weak.

379
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:51,939
They're the farmers.
They're the fishermen.

380
00:33:52,427 --> 00:33:55,863
They've done nothing
but suck the blood from this country.

381
00:33:57,187 --> 00:34:01,465
But you are the heroes
who will save this nation.

382
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,584
You are not children anymore.

383
00:34:04,547 --> 00:34:06,424
You're men.

384
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,584
No one has ever given you respect...

385
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:14,705
...but with this in your hand,
they go fear you.

386
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:17,256
If you do not get
the respect you deserve...

387
00:34:17,427 --> 00:34:19,622
...you will take it
by shedding their blood.

388
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:23,575
- Repeat after me, shed their blood.
- Shed their blood.

389
00:34:23,747 --> 00:34:26,705
- Louder! Shed their blood!
- Shed their blood!

390
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:29,859
Make them hear you in Freetown.
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

391
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,495
<i>Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>
<i>Shed their blood!</i>

392
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,420
- Dia Vandy, stand up.
- <i>Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>

393
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:38,385
- <i>Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>
- Put your hand on the gun.

394
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:40,060
<i>Shed their blood!</i>
<i>Shed their blood!</i>

395
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:41,785
<i>Shed their blood!</i>
<i>Shed their blood!</i>

396
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:44,859
- <i>Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>
- Now squeeze the trigger.

397
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:49,579
Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger!

398
00:35:22,307 --> 00:35:26,698
I know, I know.
It's hard to be a man.

399
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:29,816
Sit up. Come.

400
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:34,139
But you are a soldier
of the revolution now.

401
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:37,060
And I am your commander.

402
00:35:37,547 --> 00:35:39,344
Whatever you need...

403
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:42,624
...guns, CDs, food...

404
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:46,302
...come to me.
I will take care of you.

405
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:55,576
Today, you are promoted
to the rank of captain.

406
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:01,938
Dia Vandy...

407
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:05,219
...boss man.

408
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:23,825
How's it, <i>bru?</i>

409
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:27,384
- You got something for me, huh?
- Yeah.

410
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:31,383
- So, what's new, M'Ed?
- Fucking RUF.

411
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:33,981
Tried to hit the government building
across the street.

412
00:36:34,147 --> 00:36:38,618
Shit, man, half the people
be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.

413
00:36:38,787 --> 00:36:42,018
- Might be time to get your family out?
- And go where?

414
00:36:42,187 --> 00:36:45,782
Just fire up the chopper
and fly away like you people?

415
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:47,899
This my country, man.

416
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:51,377
We here long before you came,
long after you gone.

417
00:37:00,027 --> 00:37:03,064
- Hi. I'm Maddy Bowen.
- How about you dance with me?

418
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:06,458
- No, I don't dance.
- Neither do I. Come on.

419
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:13,736
- So, Danny...
- Archer.

420
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:15,062
Archer.

421
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:19,417
When did you first start
moving stones? Was it Angola?

422
00:37:21,147 --> 00:37:25,538
Then you did the whole
mercenary thing. Was that fun?

423
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:30,542
So, what are you?
Nihilist? Opportunist?

424
00:37:30,747 --> 00:37:32,783
Maybe I wasn't breast-fed
as a child, huh?

425
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:37,182
You think I haven't met
people like you before?

426
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:40,544
- I think you get off on people like me.
- You think?

427
00:37:43,187 --> 00:37:45,621
When did you first start
working for Van De Kaap?

428
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:47,739
Christ, you never stop, do you?

429
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:52,178
No, I never stop.

430
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:54,380
Do you want me to stop?

431
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:59,416
Why don't we go back to your place,
see what's in the minibar, huh?

432
00:37:59,587 --> 00:38:01,623
I'm a print journalist. I drank it.

433
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:05,466
Is it possible that you don't care
how many people die...

434
00:38:05,627 --> 00:38:07,424
...because of the deals you do?

435
00:38:07,587 --> 00:38:10,704
People here kill each other as
a way of life. Always been like that.

436
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:13,666
So you can just watch it
and go about your day?

437
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:16,938
Maybe we should all just
write about it, then.

438
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:19,337
Look, thanks for the dance, huh?

439
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:24,698
- And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?
- Sure.

440
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:29,615
You're a hard case, huh?

441
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:32,665
Tell me something,
how long you been here in Africa, huh?

442
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:36,018
Three months. And before that,
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

443
00:38:36,307 --> 00:38:38,298
You come here
with your laptop computer...

444
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:42,255
...and your malaria medicine
and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.

445
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,899
Think you're gonna change
the outcome, huh?

446
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:48,535
Let me tell you something.
You sell blood diamonds too.

447
00:38:48,707 --> 00:38:50,106
- Really?
- Yeah.

448
00:38:50,267 --> 00:38:51,256
Tell me, how is that?

449
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:53,622
Who do you think buys
the stones that I bring out?

450
00:38:53,787 --> 00:38:57,257
Dreamy American girls who all want
a storybook wedding and a big rock...

451
00:38:57,427 --> 00:39:00,863
...like the ones in the advertisements
of your politically-correct magazines.

452
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:03,905
So, please, don't come here
and make judgments on me, all right?

453
00:39:05,227 --> 00:39:09,345
I provide a service. The world wants
what we have, and they want it cheap.

454
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:12,624
We're in business together.
Get over yourself, darling.

455
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:17,026
Okay, just to clarify, not all American
girls want a storybook wedding...

456
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:19,940
...just like not all Africans kill each other
as a way of life.

457
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,416
And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,
but you know what?

458
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:26,296
Good things are done every day,
just, apparently, not by you.

459
00:39:27,827 --> 00:39:30,739
This place is about to explode.

460
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:32,943
I wanna spend my time
with someone else.

461
00:39:43,587 --> 00:39:46,465
<i>You are listening to BBC World Service.</i>

462
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:50,222
<i>In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United</i>
<i>Front forces have been sighted...</i>

463
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:53,026
<i>... within 10 kilometers</i>
<i>of the capital city of Freetown.</i>

464
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:55,747
<i>The minister of the interior</i>
<i>has expressed confidence...</i>

465
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:58,137
<i>... that the government troops</i>
<i>can repel the attack.</i>

466
00:39:58,307 --> 00:40:01,458
<i>All foreign nationals are being advised</i>
<i>to leave the country.</i>

467
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:04,903
<i>There are also unconfirmed reports</i>
<i>that atrocities are being committed...</i>

468
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:07,740
<i>... by both sides</i>
<i>in the rapidly worsening situation.</i>

469
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:11,695
<i>The United Nations has described</i>
<i>the refugee situation as critical.</i>

470
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,096
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell it yourself.

471
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:27,701
To who?
And for what price, my friend?

472
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:29,823
You need my help,
whether you like it or not.

473
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:32,899
- What are you talking about?
- Here, let me help you with that.

474
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:36,776
You hear that? You hear that?
They came into the city overnight.

475
00:40:36,947 --> 00:40:39,142
It's started.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

476
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:43,425
Listen, the right stone can buy anything.
Information, safety, even freedom.

477
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:45,942
But a big stone does not stay secret
for very long.

478
00:40:46,107 --> 00:40:49,224
The moment you tell anyone about it,
your life is absolutely worthless.

479
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:52,379
The only reason you're alive is
you haven't told anyone where it is.

480
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:53,775
Am I right? Am I?

481
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:56,103
Who do you think got you
out of jail, huh?

482
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:59,225
- That makes us partners.
- I am not your partner!

483
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:01,776
What if I helped you find your family?

484
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:03,426
What do you know of my family?

485
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,465
The relief agencies are useless,
the hospitals are overwhelmed.

486
00:41:06,627 --> 00:41:09,141
- There are other ways, <i>bru.</i>
- Liar.

487
00:41:09,307 --> 00:41:12,379
Look at me. I know people, huh?
White people.

488
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:15,584
Without me, you're just another
black man in Africa, all right?

489
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:20,459
Oh, shit.

490
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,660
We got no time.
What's it gonna be?

491
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:25,738
You would say anything.
How can I trust you?

492
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:29,183
I don't give a fuck about you, all right?
That diamond could be priceless!

493
00:41:29,347 --> 00:41:33,420
We split it, and you get your family.
What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?

494
00:41:33,587 --> 00:41:36,055
- Where will we go? Where do we go?
- Come on, follow me!

495
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:07,785
Stay low!

496
00:42:09,587 --> 00:42:10,781
Get your ass over here!

497
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:22,382
Wait!

498
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:24,379
Now!

499
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:30,826
Come on, come on.

500
00:42:34,707 --> 00:42:36,026
Come on!

501
00:42:51,587 --> 00:42:53,100
Come on.

502
00:42:53,267 --> 00:42:54,416
Fuck!

503
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:05,059
No, this way.

504
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:06,940
Fire!

505
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:23,866
Fuck! Go, go, go!

506
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:25,660
Go!

507
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:37,019
Shit!

508
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:38,779
No! No!

509
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:48,545
This way.

510
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:09,657
This way. Stay low.

511
00:44:20,627 --> 00:44:22,299
Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.

512
00:44:29,027 --> 00:44:30,699
Come on!

513
00:44:35,867 --> 00:44:38,301
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

514
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:04,983
Fire!

515
00:46:42,627 --> 00:46:46,256
- Is there another way?
- That bridge is the only way across, huh?

516
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,497
So, what do we do?

517
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:03,418
- You are RUF? And I am your prisoner.
- What do you mean?

518
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,545
You wanna see your son again,
don't you? You stay behind me.

519
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:08,785
Wait, wait. Wait.

520
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:14,261
Bring that pink chicken skin
over here, huh?

521
00:47:14,427 --> 00:47:16,702
Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.

522
00:47:50,947 --> 00:47:52,824
Where are we going?

523
00:47:53,547 --> 00:47:56,015
Lungi's under government control.

524
00:47:56,187 --> 00:48:00,465
I'm gonna try to locate a sat phone
to get in contact with my pilot, all right?

525
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,902
I have agreed to nothing.

526
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:06,136
You're in a bit of a conundrum there,
my friend.

527
00:48:06,307 --> 00:48:10,380
You know what that means?
It means you have no choice.

528
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:26,744
So you're a fisherman, huh?

529
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:30,582
- What do you catch mostly?
- Fish.

530
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:39,980
Come on.

531
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:53,186
- Hello.
- Back away from the fence.

532
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,815
Listen, I'm from
the <i>Cape Herald,</i> all right?

533
00:48:55,987 --> 00:48:58,785
My wallet, my credentials,
everything got left in Freetown.

534
00:48:58,947 --> 00:49:01,507
We barely got out with our lives.
Can we just get through?

535
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:04,579
Back away from the fence.

536
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:09,979
But you are not a journalist.

537
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,546
I'm trying to get us to Kono.

538
00:49:11,707 --> 00:49:13,982
- Do you understand that, huh?
- Getting B-roll. Wait.

539
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:16,615
Listen, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back just now.

540
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,745
How's it, my <i>bru?</i>
Have you got an extra smoke?

541
00:49:19,907 --> 00:49:21,545
- Here.
- Oh, cheers.

542
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:24,619
I'm looking for someone, an American
by the name of Maddy Bowen.

543
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:27,381
- Lf you saw her, you would not forget it.
- Yeah, I know her.

544
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,536
- Is it?
- Yeah.

545
00:49:28,707 --> 00:49:32,177
Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking
for her? I've got the story she wants.

546
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:35,419
Okay, but I'm going out for a bit.
If I see her before, I'll tell her.

547
00:49:35,587 --> 00:49:37,703
Magic. Listen, we'll be
right down the road, huh?

548
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:40,620
- Sweet. Cheers, <i>bru.</i>
- Cheers.

549
00:49:41,947 --> 00:49:45,223
It is as I said.
You will say anything.

550
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:53,059
- You don't mind waiting?
- No worries.

551
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:56,936
- Thank you so much. I'll just be a sec.
- All right, Maddy.

552
00:50:00,187 --> 00:50:01,506
Hi.

553
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,385
You got out.

554
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:06,459
Yes. Hello again.

555
00:50:06,627 --> 00:50:08,857
- This is Solomon Vandy.
- Hi.

556
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:10,506
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

557
00:50:10,827 --> 00:50:14,103
So I'm on deadline. I've been waiting
four hours to use the phone.

558
00:50:14,267 --> 00:50:18,385
- Someone's holding my place in line.
- I understand. Come with me, huh?

559
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:21,023
All right. Here it is.

560
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:22,939
There's a company
called Tiara Diamonds.

561
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:24,096
Right?

562
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:26,337
They get the stones
that I smuggle into Liberia.

563
00:50:26,507 --> 00:50:28,782
Now, Van De Kaap
has no visible ties to Tiara...

564
00:50:28,947 --> 00:50:32,098
...but through a series of cross holdings
and offshore bank accounts...

565
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:34,303
...they actually own it.
- You can prove this?

566
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:38,977
- Lf you help me out, yeah.
- Right, here it comes.

567
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:41,581
Before you say anything,
look at that man. You see him?

568
00:50:41,987 --> 00:50:46,424
His entire village was burned down.
His wife and children, they got away.

569
00:50:46,587 --> 00:50:49,659
He's been working in the mining camps,
trying to get his family back.

570
00:50:49,827 --> 00:50:51,340
He cannot get through the red tape.

571
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,146
All I'm asking is this,
that you help him, huh?

572
00:50:54,307 --> 00:50:56,263
And how do you know this man?

573
00:50:56,867 --> 00:51:00,542
- I know him. I know him.
- Oh, come on, Archer.

574
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:02,466
You're using him.

575
00:51:03,987 --> 00:51:08,060
I'm using him, and you are using me,
and this is how it works, isn't it?

576
00:51:08,227 --> 00:51:10,900
Come on. Look, you've got access
to U.N. Databases.

577
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,864
- You can track his family for him.
- Why?

578
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:16,064
This whole country's at war.
Why should I help just one person?

579
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:23,384
I can't believe I just said that.

580
00:51:26,467 --> 00:51:29,027
My family's here, in Guinea?

581
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,382
Yes, according to the manifest.

582
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:33,985
I do not know how to thank you.

583
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:48,384
Tassin Camp
Forecariah, Guinea

584
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,501
Thank you. Thank you.

585
00:52:15,307 --> 00:52:17,502
This is what a million people looks like.

586
00:52:20,787 --> 00:52:24,462
At the moment, the second largest
refugee camp in Africa.

587
00:52:25,027 --> 00:52:30,465
Might catch a minute of this on CNN,
somewhere between Sports and Weather.

588
00:52:39,587 --> 00:52:40,861
- Hello.
- Yeah, hello?

589
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:43,257
I've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...

590
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:46,460
...and highlighted the names
we're looking for.

591
00:52:46,627 --> 00:52:47,776
- Move away.
- What him doing?

592
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:49,221
Okay, I'm gonna check for you.

593
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:51,821
- Wait me there.
- Okay, thank you.

594
00:52:52,147 --> 00:52:53,182
We are here to help you.

595
00:52:53,347 --> 00:52:55,542
This woman says she has
spoken to Coedoo.

596
00:52:55,707 --> 00:52:59,302
An entire country made homeless.

597
00:53:02,107 --> 00:53:05,338
Two multiplied by three
is equal to six.

598
00:53:05,507 --> 00:53:08,863
Two multiplied by four
is equal to eight.

599
00:53:09,027 --> 00:53:12,144
Two multiplied by five
is equal to 10.

600
00:53:12,307 --> 00:53:15,265
Two multiplied by six
is equal to 12.

601
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:52,896
Jassie.

602
00:53:53,987 --> 00:53:55,420
Jassie!

603
00:53:56,147 --> 00:53:57,819
Jassie!

604
00:53:57,987 --> 00:53:59,102
- Jassie.
- Solo.

605
00:53:59,267 --> 00:54:00,416
- Jassie.
- Solo.

606
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:02,857
Jassie. Jassie.

607
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,585
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

608
00:54:14,987 --> 00:54:16,181
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

609
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:17,536
Where is Dia?

610
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:19,579
Dia. Dia.

611
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,701
Where is Dia?

612
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:23,982
Where is my son?

613
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:26,462
Jassie!

614
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:28,136
Where is my son?

615
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:30,856
Where is my son?

616
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:33,096
They took him.

617
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:38,857
They took him.

618
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:45,018
There are only two children
on the manifest.

619
00:54:45,187 --> 00:54:47,576
- Where is my son?
- Oh, Christ.

620
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,664
Where is my son?

621
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:51,499
- Away from the fence.
- Where is my son?

622
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:52,861
Move away from the fence.

623
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:55,985
- Let them out! Let them out!
- Keep away from the fence.

624
00:54:57,347 --> 00:54:58,462
Let them out!

625
00:54:59,907 --> 00:55:01,260
Let them out!

626
00:55:01,787 --> 00:55:02,776
Away from the fence.

627
00:55:03,147 --> 00:55:04,546
Let them out!

628
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:06,425
- They'll shoot you!
- Jassie!

629
00:55:06,587 --> 00:55:08,862
No! Solo!

630
00:55:09,027 --> 00:55:11,222
Do you want your wife and child
to watch you die?

631
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:14,546
Solo! Solo!

632
00:55:23,627 --> 00:55:28,018
They said they're concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels...

633
00:55:28,547 --> 00:55:32,096
...so they refused to release them
until there's a cease-fire.

634
00:55:33,467 --> 00:55:36,106
I'm so sorry, Solomon.

635
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:39,027
What you want, Mr. Archer,
is beyond those hills...

636
00:55:39,187 --> 00:55:41,257
...where I buried it.

637
00:56:03,587 --> 00:56:08,263
You say the mine is on the Sewa River.
Where exactly?

638
00:56:09,347 --> 00:56:10,826
Solomon.

639
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:13,584
I do not need a map.

640
00:56:13,747 --> 00:56:17,979
Yeah, well, I do.
Look, we are down here, huh?

641
00:56:18,147 --> 00:56:19,819
The press convoy
is on its way to Kono.

642
00:56:19,987 --> 00:56:23,138
You say the diamond mine is up here.
Where did you bury it?

643
00:56:26,347 --> 00:56:29,419
When we get to Kono,
we're gonna have to walk, all right?

644
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:32,226
You damn well better be able to find it.

645
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:38,146
My son is a very good student.

646
00:56:39,267 --> 00:56:41,827
He walks five kilometers
to the Sister School...

647
00:56:41,987 --> 00:56:45,184
...every morning to study English.

648
00:56:46,947 --> 00:56:49,905
He's going to be a doctor one day.

649
00:57:13,187 --> 00:57:16,941
"In the 90-degree heat,
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...

650
00:57:17,107 --> 00:57:20,622
...rattling the wire
with his powerful hands."

651
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:26,666
- What?
- Nothing.

652
00:57:28,707 --> 00:57:30,618
Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?

653
00:57:32,547 --> 00:57:34,219
You're right. It's shit.

654
00:57:34,947 --> 00:57:37,586
It's like one of those infomercials.

655
00:57:37,747 --> 00:57:42,377
You know, the little black babies with
swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.

656
00:57:42,547 --> 00:57:46,301
So here I've got dead mothers, I've
got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.

657
00:57:46,467 --> 00:57:48,935
It might be enough
to make people cry if they read it...

658
00:57:49,107 --> 00:57:50,506
...maybe even write a check...

659
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,942
...but it's not gonna be enough
to make it stop.

660
00:57:53,227 --> 00:57:57,618
I am sick of writing about victims,
but it's all I can fucking do.

661
00:57:57,787 --> 00:57:59,266
Because I need facts.

662
00:57:59,427 --> 00:58:03,739
I need names. I need dates.
I need pictures. I need bank accounts.

663
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:08,141
People back home
wouldn't buy a ring...

664
00:58:08,307 --> 00:58:10,457
...if they knew it cost
someone else their hand.

665
00:58:11,107 --> 00:58:13,177
But I can't write that story...

666
00:58:13,347 --> 00:58:16,703
...until I get facts
that can be verified...

667
00:58:16,867 --> 00:58:21,816
...which is to say, until I find someone
who will go on record.

668
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:24,380
So if that is not you...

669
00:58:24,547 --> 00:58:28,506
...and you're not really gonna help me,
and we're not really gonna screw...

670
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:31,739
...then why don't you get the fuck
out of my face...

671
00:58:31,907 --> 00:58:33,738
...and let me do my work?

672
00:58:41,547 --> 00:58:45,335
Do you know that Solomon thinks
his son's gonna be a doctor one day?

673
00:58:47,987 --> 00:58:51,024
Maybe his baby dies in that camp.
Maybe his daughter gets raped.

674
00:58:51,347 --> 00:58:53,417
Who knows, maybe both.

675
00:58:55,427 --> 00:58:57,099
Do you realize that
that diamond...

676
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,781
...is the only chance he has
of getting his family out?

677
00:58:59,947 --> 00:59:01,221
You don't give a rat's ass...

678
00:59:01,387 --> 00:59:04,140
- Do you understand that?
...about his family.

679
00:59:09,387 --> 00:59:11,378
Listen, I need to get to Kono, all right?

680
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:13,538
The only way
is with the press convoy.

681
00:59:13,707 --> 00:59:15,982
I'm a journalist,
and he's my cameraman, all right?

682
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:17,626
- No.
- Please, Maddy.

683
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,345
- Please.
- No!

684
00:59:32,107 --> 00:59:34,382
After I smuggle the stones
across the border...

685
00:59:35,507 --> 00:59:38,146
...Iocal buyers get them
to a middleman in Monrovia.

686
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:43,055
Go on.

687
00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:49,183
<i>He pays off Customs and then certifies</i>
<i>that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.</i>

688
00:59:49,347 --> 00:59:51,577
That way, they can be legally exported.

689
00:59:52,147 --> 00:59:55,105
Now, once they've reached
the buyers in Antwerp...

690
00:59:55,267 --> 00:59:57,656
<i>... diamonds are brought</i>
<i>to the sorting tables...</i>

691
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,385
<i>... no more questions are asked.</i>

692
01:00:00,507 --> 01:00:02,179
By the time they get to India...

693
01:00:02,347 --> 01:00:05,942
<i>... the dirty stones are mixed with the</i>
<i>clean stones from all over the world...</i>

694
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:08,257
...and then they become
like any other diamonds.

695
01:00:08,427 --> 01:00:10,543
And Van De Kaap
knows about all this?

696
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,102
Yeah.

697
01:00:13,267 --> 01:00:15,827
<i>When I get to London,</i>
<i>I meet with Simmons.</i>

698
01:00:16,227 --> 01:00:19,537
Supply and demand. You control the
supply, and you keep the demand high.

699
01:00:19,707 --> 01:00:21,106
- Agreed.
- Good.

700
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:23,542
Now, there's an underground vault...

701
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:27,097
<i>... where they put all the stones</i>
<i>they buy up to keep off the market...</i>

702
01:00:27,267 --> 01:00:29,019
<i>... so they can keep the price high.</i>

703
01:00:29,787 --> 01:00:33,018
If rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars' worth of rough...

704
01:00:33,187 --> 01:00:36,145
...a company like Van De Kaap,
who says that they're rare...

705
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:37,899
...can't afford to let that happen.

706
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,217
<i>Especially when they're telling</i>
<i>some poor sod...</i>

707
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,776
<i>... he's supposed to shell out</i>
<i>three months ' salary...</i>

708
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:44,221
<i>... for an engagement ring.</i>

709
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:47,265
Now, technically speaking,
they're not financing the war...

710
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:50,146
...but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going.

711
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:53,424
- You understand?
- Yes. And where's my proof?

712
01:00:59,627 --> 01:01:03,586
Names, dates and numbered accounts.

713
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:08,539
You publish one word of this story
before I give them the stone...

714
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,663
...and I'm dead, huh?

715
01:01:10,827 --> 01:01:15,025
After I give it to them,
then... I leave this continent forever.

716
01:01:17,187 --> 01:01:18,905
If you don't come out
with the diamond?

717
01:01:19,067 --> 01:01:21,342
Then write whatever you want.

718
01:01:22,147 --> 01:01:24,138
I'm already dead.

719
01:01:30,747 --> 01:01:34,262
Now, remember. All you say is,
"I am the cameraman," all right?

720
01:01:34,427 --> 01:01:36,258
Listen, I cannot do this.

721
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:38,941
- Why not?
- Because I am not a journalist.

722
01:01:39,107 --> 01:01:41,496
- Of course you're not.
- Well, then how can I say I am?

723
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:44,739
Because you do. Because that's how
you get your son back, all right?

724
01:01:44,907 --> 01:01:47,216
Now get on the bus. Go.

725
01:02:03,227 --> 01:02:05,980
I am the cameraman.

726
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:13,777
You are writing about
what is happening here?

727
01:02:14,507 --> 01:02:15,496
Yes.

728
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:19,706
So when people in your country read it,
they will come help us, yes?

729
01:02:20,387 --> 01:02:21,422
Probably not.

730
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,222
- You heard of a Stinger?
- What?

731
01:02:25,387 --> 01:02:29,665
Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,
heat-seeking missile, <i>bru.</i>

732
01:02:29,827 --> 01:02:32,421
I mean, I saw her go into Afghanistan...

733
01:02:32,587 --> 01:02:35,579
...like about 200 clicks
into Taliban land.

734
01:02:35,747 --> 01:02:38,466
When the military said no,
she just took a bus, <i>bru.</i>

735
01:02:38,627 --> 01:02:41,824
Came back with 3000 words,
and she still looked so good.

736
01:02:41,987 --> 01:02:43,739
- Like hot, you know?
- All right.

737
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:45,579
Calm down to the frantic now, huh?

738
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:48,859
- What's that?
- What's going on?

739
01:02:49,987 --> 01:02:51,136
Looks like it was an RPG.

740
01:02:51,307 --> 01:02:53,059
Open the door. Let us out.

741
01:02:53,387 --> 01:02:55,264
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on. Go, go, go.

742
01:02:57,147 --> 01:02:58,546
Go, go! Move, move, move!

743
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:02,105
We've just happened upon
the sight of an ambush...

744
01:03:03,187 --> 01:03:05,417
...fifteen kilometers
from the Liberian border...

745
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:08,101
...near the Moa River...
- As you can see behind me...

746
01:03:08,267 --> 01:03:09,746
...just a few minutes ago...

747
01:03:09,907 --> 01:03:12,137
...an ambulance has...
- Got movement in the bush.

748
01:03:12,347 --> 01:03:14,303
- Check out the head of the road.
- Spread out.

749
01:03:14,467 --> 01:03:16,105
- At this site.
Dozens of...

750
01:03:17,067 --> 01:03:18,944
Many are injured.

751
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:31,704
Get back on the bus, huh?
Get back on! Come on!

752
01:03:31,867 --> 01:03:33,380
- Maddy!
- Move it! Move it!

753
01:03:33,547 --> 01:03:34,536
Get back on the bus!

754
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:36,220
Solomon! Solomon!

755
01:03:36,387 --> 01:03:37,820
- Let's go.
- Solomon, come here!

756
01:03:37,987 --> 01:03:39,340
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

757
01:03:39,547 --> 01:03:42,107
- Get in the bus!
- Move, move, move! Come on, come on.

758
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,179
- Move!
- Get in the bus. Let's go.

759
01:03:44,347 --> 01:03:46,463
Get in, get in.
Goddamn it, get in! Get in!

760
01:03:46,627 --> 01:03:48,936
- Let me inside!
- There's no fucking space!

761
01:03:49,107 --> 01:03:51,257
- Let them on the bus.
- You give him your seat.

762
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,305
What if we just take your place, huh?
What if we take your place?

763
01:03:54,467 --> 01:03:57,265
That's enough. He can ride with me.
Oi, he can ride with me.

764
01:03:57,427 --> 01:03:59,895
Maddy! Let's go!
Maddy, let's go. Come on!
