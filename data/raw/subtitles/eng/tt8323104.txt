1
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,911
Hey. Have you seen Nancy Drew?

2
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,246
Nancy who?

3
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:21,956
Never mind. Thank you.

4
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,916
Mrs. Shay!

5
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,626
- Hey, have you seen Nancy Drew?
- No.

6
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,794
Thank you.

7
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,648
Sorry, sir! I'm sorry. Sorry.

8
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,983
Watch where you're going, kid.

9
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,569
Hey! Have you seen Nancy Drew?

10
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,930
Drew!

11
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,057
Finally! You didn't answer your phone.

12
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,519
Sorry, I don't hear it
when I'm skating.

13
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,603
Check it out.

14
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,373
I can't believe anyone
would do this to Bess,

15
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,815
and now it's gone viral.

16
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,503
You know how sensitive Bess is,

17
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:32,727
she won't leave the house now.

18
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,864
Please, guys. Go away.

19
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,950
We're not leaving!

20
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,243
Great.

21
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,079
I'm so pathetic,
my friends have to come and rescue me.

22
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,081
I'm an even bigger loser than I thought.

23
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,165
Okay, if...

24
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,084
If needing your friends
means you're a loser,

25
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,629
then I'm the biggest loser of all.

26
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,005
'Cause you guys make me forget

27
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,299
I live in this one-horse town every day.

28
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,510
- Jeez.
- Hey.

29
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,678
Hi.

30
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,556
Actually, River Heights has four horses.

31
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,599
Sorry.

32
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,851
Let me in.

33
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,769
Welcome to the party!

34
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,480
Let's school this troll.

35
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,205
But, we don't even know
who did it.

36
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,733
Oh, isn't it obvious?

37
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,362
Oh, he's just a dill weed.

38
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:18,865
Can I show you?

39
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,453
I'm so stupid.
I forgot to take my goggles off.

40
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,538
Oh, stop it.

41
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,164
The last thing you are is stupid.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,960
Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess.

43
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,422
My clothes might not be as good
as everyone else's,

44
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,590
but they're not dirty.

45
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,714
Hey, it looks like
a two-year-old came up with this.

46
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,136
Wish I could fast-forward it.

47
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,388
Just don't look for a second.

48
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,975
Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess.

49
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,602
Everyone saw this.

50
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,937
Don't pay attention
to what a lizard-brain does.

51
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,273
Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess.

52
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,318
There! Someone forgot
to blur out his reflection.

53
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,070
- Presenting...
- Number 91.

54
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,405
Try that again.

55
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,616
It's... It's a reflection.

56
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,242
Nineteen.

57
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,744
Derek freaking Barnes.

58
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,078
- God.
- Should've known.

59
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,456
Derek is making fun of me all the time.

60
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,542
I know I'm not cute, or cool, but...

61
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,211
Why can't he just let me be?

62
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,796
What? You're super cute.

63
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,799
Aww.

64
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,236
Don't they make a darling couple?

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,845
The idiot spawn
of the two richest families in town.

66
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,370
Nancy Drew, I know that look.

67
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,681
You can't just go after Derek.

68
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,477
- Ew!
- I'm not gonna go after Derek.

69
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,689
I'm just gonna help him see the light.

70
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,399
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,711
You've only spent summers here.

72
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
You don't really know Derek like we do.

73
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,323
But, if we don't stop him,
he'll just do it again to someone else.

74
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,576
Do you guys really want that
on your conscience?

75
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,748
Okay.

76
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,293
I'm in. Fine.

77
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,087
Great! Let's hit the gym.

78
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,171
Wait.

79
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,008
You... You wanna work out? Like, now?

80
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,678
No, but in order to get ready
for football season

81
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,012
he's gotta super-set.

82
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,974
You know, all the time. And... Here.

83
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,269
From the timestamp, it looks like

84
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,855
mid-morning Tuesday
is his favorite time to hog the floor.

85
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,192
That means he'd shower around,
you know, 11:45,

86
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,861
so he could be fresh to play trainer
for the cheerleading squad.

87
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,281
What?

88
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,575
The way your brain works is so cool.

89
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,832
You know, psychologists say

90
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,478
it's okay for bullies to get
a little taste of their own medicine.

91
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,378
It's called restorative justice.

92
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,057
Yeah!

93
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,809
Yes!

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,680
What's the most important thing
in Derek's life?

95
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,359
His social media presence, right?

96
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,362
Let's make a tiny adjustment to that.

97
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,403
Gold! Gold!

98
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,782
Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold!

99
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,866
Bess.

100
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,911
Bess, this is perfect!
This is perfect! Okay.

101
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,131
Twenty seconds.

102
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,893
Yes!

103
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,232
- Yes. Oh, boy.
- Yes! Yes!

104
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,609
Get up here.

105
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,031
I did something.

106
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,993
Oh, my God. That was so...

107
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,203
Okay.

108
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,223
- I've got everything set up.
- So close.

109
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,539
We're ready to go.

110
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,376
- Maple bars, anyone?
- Yes! Can I, please?

111
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,921
Oh, my God!
Maple bars are my thing!

112
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,255
Dig in.

113
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,884
Oh, I probably shouldn't.
My skin is still breaking out.

114
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,678
Eat a donut, Bess. Okay?
Life is short, go.

115
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,763
- Come on.
- It's good.

116
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,898
So, how long will it take?

117
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,149
I don't know.

118
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,162
Hey, this is my set, not hers!

119
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,790
My bad. I'm all yours now.

120
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,378
Derek! Are you okay?

121
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,006
Never better.

122
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,763
No.

123
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,890
Something is seriously wrong
with you, dude.

124
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:00,975
Look.

125
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,910
Derek Barnes, welcome to Thunderdome!

126
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,370
When you humiliate others,

127
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,580
- there will be consequences.
- Stop iaughing at me!

128
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,586
She's checking me out.
She's checking me out.

129
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,047
i look good. She still looking?

130
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,132
Faster.

131
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,800
Oh!

132
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,885
At least I'm trying.

133
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,806
I'm currently single right now
if you guys are looking for anything.

134
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,121
You can chill at my house
if you guys are interested.

135
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,862
Just make sure you keep
your face below my back,

136
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,572
so, like, my face is the only thing.

137
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,366
Because, like, if your face
is on my video, it's gonna be ruined.

138
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,745
I'm just waiting on the machine.

139
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,252
Stop laughing at me. Okay?

140
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,587
Stop laughing at me.

141
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,967
- He's so blue.
- Oh, my God!

142
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,761
This stuff actually works.

143
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,721
I was not expecting that.

144
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,639
That... It works!

145
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,767
- It works! Let's get outta here.
- Phew!

146
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,940
Nobody's ever stood up for me
like that before.

147
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,026
You stood up for yourself.

148
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,528
You know, we just added a little color.

149
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,614
- Aww.
- Thank you.

150
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,698
Of course!

151
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,200
Aww!

152
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,620
You guys are the best.

153
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,744
This town is so much more fun
with you in it, Nancy.

154
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,000
Even if that means
we get in a lot more trouble.

155
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,877
Oh, come on. Just a little trouble.

156
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,089
Your daughter assaulted my son.

157
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,091
That's more than enough for me to sue.

158
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,175
Go right ahead.

159
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,513
All my daughter did was defend
a young girl your son cyberbullied.

160
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,181
My son did no such thing.

161
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,785
How about we look at the video

162
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,811
that Derek posted
from your IP address?

163
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,690
- This is ridiculous.
- Guys, let's all calm down a minute.

164
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,068
Under State Penal Code 848.9,

165
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,279
cyberbullying is a crime
punishable by up to five years in prison

166
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,656
and $1,000 in fines,

167
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,699
and that's just for you, Jeff.

168
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,994
This is not over, Counselor.

169
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,123
I promise that.

170
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,627
Are you sure Jeff Barnes

171
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,648
is the type of person
you want to have as an enemy?

172
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,506
I think I can handle him.

173
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm sorry about all this.

174
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,844
I'll make sure Nancy
pays for the damages.

175
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,887
That's not gonna be enough, though.

176
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,347
This is not her first offense,

177
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,932
and she involved two other girls.

178
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,892
I can't just turn a blind eye.

179
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,145
She has to face
the consequences this time.

180
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,522
What did you have in mind?

181
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,234
Eight hours a day?

182
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,796
Okay, for the next two months,

183
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,904
basically my whole summer
just went sideways.

184
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,323
I'm surprised that's all
the community service you got.

185
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,950
You committed several felonies.

186
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,910
Hey, they're only felonies if you're 18.

187
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,579
Oh, excellent point, Counselor.

188
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,933
And, since you're nowhere near 18,
you are hereby grounded.

189
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,666
I stood up to a bully.

190
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,127
I mean, why should I get punished
for that?

191
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,211
I'm proud of you.

192
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,648
But the way you did it isn't right.

193
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,548
You stooped to his level.

194
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:24,011
You pulled a prank that caused
thousands of dollars worth of damage.

195
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,805
They may have to re-tile
the entire shower.

196
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,975
But worst of all,
you involved other girls.

197
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,186
I mean, that dye wears off.

198
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,356
And delivering justice isn't a prank,
it's my duty.

199
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,858
So, is it like last week?

200
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,211
It was your duty to burn
the word "assassin"

201
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,196
- into Mr. Blankenship's lawn.
- Okay. No. He was shooting crows, Dad.

202
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,655
That's murder.

203
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,867
If you think that driving everybody
in town crazy

204
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,036
is gonna sabotage things so bad for us

205
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,079
we have to move back to Chicago,
you're wrong.

206
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,332
- We had a deal.
- We never made a deal.

207
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,043
You know, a deal is when two people
come to an agreement.

208
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,212
You made the decision.

209
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,422
I mean, you never gave me
a real choice.

210
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,300
I wanted to stay in Chicago
with all my friends.

211
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,093
I never wanted to move here.

212
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,972
I couldn't stay there and you know that.

213
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,268
Knowing everything about the city
reminded me of your mom.

214
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,481
Yeah, well, maybe...
Maybe I don't wanna forget her.

215
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,326
Thank you very much.

216
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,915
Vote for the train.

217
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,559
Let's bring some new blood
to this town.

218
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,294
A little culture,
maybe a Chipotle, huh?

219
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,588
You get a burrito.
You get a burrito.

220
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,423
You get a burrito.

221
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,508
Where's my burrito?

222
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,635
Vote for the train,
and you'll get one.

223
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,179
There she is,
straight from the hoosegow.

224
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,014
I got your skateboard there, sweetheart.

225
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,184
Okay.

226
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,498
- Listen, Nancy.
- Give her some space, Cars.

227
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,814
Support your local business.

228
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,440
Vote for the train.

229
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,900
Here, have a slice.

230
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,963
Maybe you'll come to your senses
and vote for the train, too.

231
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,279
Really? Not the time.

232
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,615
Train won't make anyone wanna visit
this delightful dump anyway.

233
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,909
Hey, River Heights isn't a dump.

234
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,745
Well, it will be if this train
comes through here.

235
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,789
Listen, I'm fighting

236
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,624
for what makes this town special.

237
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,252
The charm of it, the community.

238
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,462
I mean, do you have any idea

239
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,257
how many historical homes
will be knocked to the ground?

240
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,801
Oh, my darling brother,

241
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,887
the train will finally bring us
into the correct century.

242
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,973
Grandpa here wants to keep us
in the Stone Ages.

243
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,725
And look, Nancy thinks you're mental

244
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,935
if you find this place charming.

245
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,104
Hello, Hannah. I'm right here.

246
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,275
This town needs something fresh
to shake things up, you know?

247
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,776
Give it a little bad element.

248
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,029
- An edge, right?
- You see what she's doing?

249
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,449
See, your aunt
didn't make it in New York,

250
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,200
and now she thinks
she can bring all that

251
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,785
and her stand-up career here, too.

252
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,496
Hey, I opened for Amy Schumer, you know?

253
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,581
Oh.

254
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,125
It was a door, but still. See?

255
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,895
- That was good, you laughed, right?
- That was all right. Yeah.

256
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,481
I could be a big fish in a smaller pond,
fill seats at open-mic night.

257
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,608
- Hey.
- How you doing, Nate?

258
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,234
Just because more people
come to see your stand-up routine,

259
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,652
doesn't mean the jokes
will actually be funny.

260
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,760
Oh!

261
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,678
Wow, Dad. I didn't know
you had it in you.

262
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,222
Sure. Take my pie and my dreams.

263
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,600
And besides, jailbird,
I thought you were on my side.

264
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,560
Whoa, this is between you two, not me.

265
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,146
Okay. I hate to break up
a good family feud,

266
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,024
but it's time we go show people
like your misguided sister here

267
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,628
- how wrong they are.
- Mmm-hmm.

268
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,277
I'm charging you for that pie, Nate.

269
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,238
Hey, I'm just doing my part
to keep my favorite family together.

270
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,949
You guys are all I've got.

271
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,746
Plus, your dad here is the best lawyer
this town's ever seen.

272
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,123
Ew! God, get a room.

273
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,876
Hey, listen, before your dad got here,
this train was a sure thing.

274
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,878
Now, not!

275
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,948
That's how persuasive this guy is.

276
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,132
Yeah, yeah. All right. Let's go.

277
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,676
All right, here you go.

278
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,262
All right, my brother
from another mother,

279
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,014
Let's go rock this town hall meeting.

280
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,743
All right. I'd tell you
to break a leg, but...

281
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,726
- But you'd actually mean it.
- Yeah, exactly.

282
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,021
Hey, listen.

283
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,706
I know your dad's
a big pain in the butt,

284
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,982
but he does respect you.

285
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,902
Yeah, if he respected me,
I wouldn't be here.

286
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,239
Come here. Sit with me.

287
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,913
There are no words
for what happened to you.

288
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,582
I can't even begin to know
how you must feel.

289
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,044
Losing your mom.

290
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,213
But, think about your dad.

291
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,383
I mean, he lost the love of his life.

292
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,844
Living in Chicago was killing him.

293
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,846
He was turning into the living dead,

294
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,098
and he didn't want to be that for you.

295
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,438
I never really thought of it that way.

296
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,025
And this place isn't half as bad
as you think it is.

297
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,193
Oh...

298
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,821
It kinda totally is.

299
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,157
But, you know,
present company excluded, of course.

300
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,493
Having you here is so cool.

301
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,120
The house is alive again.

302
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,165
And I know this place is square
and a little backwards,

303
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,626
but it's nothing us cool girls
can't do something about.

304
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,881
I wish I were half as brave as you.

305
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,091
You're as persuasive as your dad,

306
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,469
and as righteous as your mom was.

307
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,679
Those are superpowers, you know.

308
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,892
If you use them for good,
imagine who you could be.

309
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,394
Oh, I thought I did.

310
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,671
Yeah, I'm just tired of everyone
looking at me, you know?

311
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,775
Ah, they're all gonna be working
for you someday. Don't worry about it.

312
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,038
Hey, hey.

313
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,042
Back in the car.

314
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,962
Back in the car.

315
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,519
What is your problem?

316
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,753
Your daddy better get with the times

317
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,444
and let that train come to town.

318
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,366
A lot of powerful people
stand to lose a lot of money

319
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,490
if your daddy has his way.

320
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,221
And I promise you,
they will not let that happen.

321
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,245
Let go of me!

322
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,582
Now, I'm not a violent man,
but I will hurt people if I have to.

323
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,251
I'm calling the cops.

324
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,836
Cops care about delinquents?

325
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,217
Do me a favor,

326
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:23,305
tell your daddy that Willie Wharton
said to get on board

327
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,973
or get out of the way.

328
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,064
He tried to run you down?

329
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,609
I'm gonna kill this guy.

330
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,986
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

331
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,113
You don't even know, do you?

332
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,489
You're worse than Nancy.

333
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,366
Yeah, well, still right here.

334
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,620
That's just what we need
is two Drews arrested on the same day.

335
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,599
Hey, maybe we could have
matching handcuffs.

336
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,125
Listen, I've heard of this guy, Wharton.
He's trouble.

337
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,587
Got fired from the factory,
gets fired from jobs all the time.

338
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,672
- You know Tammy Drucker?
- Uh-huh.

339
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,132
He used to date her.

340
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,425
I'm gonna call her.

341
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,846
Come on, Dad.

342
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,811
This is like the most exciting thing
that's happened since we moved here.

343
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,312
He's not getting away with what he did.
I promise you that.

344
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,564
Okay.

345
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,826
I think blue really is his color.

346
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,286
It was Mom's favorite.

347
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,497
Thought it was a nice touch.

348
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,208
Oh!

349
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,754
Welcome, convicts.

350
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,881
Let's make this as pleasant as possible.

351
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,759
So, the first area I want to hit today
is over here.

352
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,386
Pretty dirty area.

353
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,347
Nancy, you know
you can't have that here.

354
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,182
No, I was just gonna play some music.

355
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,394
Get me and this here felon
in a trash picking mood.

356
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,524
This is community service, not a rave.

357
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,775
Oh, come on.

358
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,778
I'll Iet you choose the playlist. Hmm?

359
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,741
All right.

360
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,827
No boy bands.

361
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,662
And please, no country.

362
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,982
But my lights exploded.

363
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:43,069
A ghost moved my furniture.
How can you explain that?

364
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,697
I'm telling you,
my house is haunted.

365
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,801
I don't know
what to tell you, ladies.

366
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,826
I don't do haunted houses.

367
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,495
Sheriff, I have known this woman
my entire life.

368
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,040
And she doesn't scare easily,
and she doesn't lie.

369
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,167
So, can't you just send someone out?

370
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,044
Are you sure she isn't drinking

371
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,046
her own special batch of Kool-Aid?

372
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,006
Young man, young man.

373
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,133
I have stared down Communism.

374
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,637
My choice of a cocktail
in retirement is none of your business.

375
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,973
Um... Sheriff?

376
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,684
Aren't we supposed
to respect our elders?

377
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,895
Says the delinquent picking up trash.

378
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,898
No, actually I'm doing this
because I disrespected my peers.

379
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:22,776
I'm sorry, ladies,

380
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,779
but I can't spare my one and only deputy
for your situation.

381
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,657
Yeah, 'cause River Heights
is such a hotbed of criminal activity.

382
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,642
Keep it up, you're gonna be
picking up trash until Christmas.

383
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,663
Afternoon, ladies. If you need anything,
just give us a call.

384
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,582
- Oh, really?
- Wow.

385
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,335
We gave you a call. Remember?

386
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,879
You shouldn't have to handle this
all by yourselves,

387
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,964
I mean... Maybe I can help.

388
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,925
Oh, no, it's fine. We can deal with it.

389
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,385
Now, if you could
you wouldn't have gone to the cops.

390
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,721
Helen, just a minute.

391
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,723
She looks like a very sweet girl.

392
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,893
- I love your vest.
- Thank you.

393
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,104
Trust me, we don't want her help.

394
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,689
She's the one who made
that horrible video of Derek

395
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,418
and she thinks she can do
whatever she wants

396
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,734
just 'cause her mother died.

397
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,278
That was you?

398
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,364
Um...

399
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,865
Yeah.

400
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,578
I think you and I
are gonna get along just fine.

401
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,290
Come here, you.

402
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,838
Uh, Nancy?

403
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,566
Where do you think you're going?

404
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,466
Oh, I'm taking my 15.

405
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:30,802
What 15?

406
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,642
The legend dates back to 1885,

407
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,769
when the Colfax brothers,

408
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:43,648
who built Twin Elms,
Malcolm and Schuyler,

409
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,402
had a falling out over a woman,

410
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,654
Millicent Andrews.

411
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,865
Malcolm had proposed to her.

412
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,577
She wasn't too jazzed up about being,
you know, married

413
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,079
to the number one pig farmer in town.

414
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,708
Plus, she was hopelessly
in love with his brother, Schuyler.

415
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,251
Oh, boy.

416
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:08,006
Legend has it,
Malcolm killed them both

417
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,383
in a fit of jealousy,

418
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,886
buried them in the walls.

419
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,931
Then, he offed himself.

420
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,600
Did they ever find the bodies?

421
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,018
No.

422
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,770
But when I listen very carefully,

423
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,273
I think I can hear them crying.

424
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,025
You've gotta be kidding me.

425
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,111
I wouId never kid about a thing
like the Colfax ghosts.

426
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,822
Stop pretending like you care
about any of this.

427
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,657
Well, I don't have to pretend.

428
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,951
She had me at
"people buried in the walls."

429
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,162
You just want to get outta
community service,

430
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,330
which you deserve.

431
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,040
Okay. First of all, Helen,

432
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,043
I can't get outta community service.
I already tried.

433
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,753
And, second of all, aren't you curious

434
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,631
whether or not the Colfax ghosts
are back for revenge?

435
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,049
Oh, my!

436
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,467
What?

437
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,470
You two remind me
of when I was young.

438
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,097
But we had better hair
back in those days.

439
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,269
My best friend and I, Rosie,
we despised each other.

440
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,940
We even fought once
over the same boy...

441
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,317
Chad, Peter...

442
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,778
I don't know.
There were so many of 'em.

443
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,950
We both dated him,
then he jilted both of us.

444
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,451
We became best friends.

445
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,454
Sadly, Rosie moved to Miami.

446
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,373
She loves a man in a Speedo.

447
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,252
It just goes to show you

448
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,754
that sometimes a girl
can find her best friend

449
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,464
in her worst enemy.

450
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:32,799
Huh?

451
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,802
Huh?

452
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,179
- Yeah, no...
- Oh, no, sorry.

453
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,681
Hard pass.

454
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,940
Hi!

455
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,651
Perfect timing. I made dinner.

456
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,532
- What did you do now?
- Nothing.

457
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,577
I mean,
today has been incident-free.

458
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,973
It's kind of hard to get in trouble

459
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,872
when you're working
on a chain gang. So...

460
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,083
Yeah.

461
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,877
- Besides that... Look!
- Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

462
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,379
- Get right in it. Yeah.
- Okay.

463
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,103
- Sit right here. Don't trip.
- All right.

464
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,175
Tonight, you'll be eating

465
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,094
- chicken cacciatore...
- Ah.

466
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,618
...with twice-baked potatoes and...

467
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,514
And what are you gonna...

468
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,718
What did you do this time?
Seriously, what's going on?

469
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,229
Okay, so, you know,
I know I'm grounded and all...

470
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,397
- Mmm-hmm.
- But,

471
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,482
maybe you'll Iet me

472
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,570
help a nice lady end her haunted
house problem tomorrow night.

473
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,906
- Please?
- I don't know, Nancy. I got...

474
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,387
I'm getting ready to go
outta town this weekend.

475
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,578
And... Wait. What?

476
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,498
You guys want me to find more
positive ways to express myself, right?

477
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,126
Then what could be
more positive than helping

478
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,838
a sweet old lady
and witch-grandniece?

479
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,214
Listen, Nancy.

480
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,008
I got a lot going on right now, okay?

481
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,177
I gotta schmooze this land owner

482
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,429
and convince him to reject
the train company's offer.

483
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,514
And I can't do that
if I'm worried about you.

484
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,893
Well, think of it
as taking me in protective custody.

485
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,728
Of an octogenarian?

486
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,856
Okay, that old bird can
kick some serious butt if she has to.

487
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,694
Okay, but... But,

488
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,822
you're still grounded,
and remember our agreement.

489
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,866
Yes, of course.

490
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:28,081
Check in, text, call,
send an owl, send a raven.

491
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,645
Don't worry, I'll blow up your phone.

492
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:33,461
- And, I'll vaporize yours right back.
- Okay, Dad.

493
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,565
- Yeah, it didn't really work, did it?
- Not really.

494
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,589
Hey, listen.

495
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,424
The Sheriff's got an eye
on Willie Wharton.

496
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,695
If he gets within 100 feet from you,
they're gonna arrest him.

497
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,096
So, if anything happens, call Hannah.

498
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,987
If you can't get a hold of her,
call Nate.

499
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,599
Got it.

500
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,935
Nice doing business with you,
Counselor.

501
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,228
Mmm-hmm.

502
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,481
Did you really cook this?

503
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,859
I'm 18.

504
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,738
- And leave my jacket here.
- Oh!

505
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,615
Mmm.

506
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,494
I'm here, doing my check-in.

507
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,496
I'm at Twin Elms, yeah.

508
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,998
Okay.

509
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,875
Love you, yeah.

510
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,544
Bye.

511
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,136
We're only staying
for one night, right?

512
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,512
Yeah, why?

513
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,472
No reason.

514
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,142
Okay, look. Just because
my aunt invited you over

515
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,810
doesn't change anything between us.

516
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,103
I didn't expect it to.

517
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,440
Aunt Flora's very important to me,

518
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,401
so please promise me you won't
make some kind of a joke about this.

519
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,902
I would never do that.

520
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,489
If she's really seeing ghosts, then...

521
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:45,366
I mean, I wanna find out why.

522
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:50,496
Can we just, you know,
suspend our feud for just the night?

523
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,790
Fine, whatever.

524
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,041
Good.

525
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,888
I mean, if this place
really is haunted...

526
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,129
Tonight's gonna be exciting!

527
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,598
Did I forget to mention
my great-aunt is a little extra?

528
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,519
You gotta be kidding me.

529
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:42,673
Skater bear.

530
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,592
You don't see that every day.

531
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,093
You think I'm crazy, huh?

532
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,221
Smidge.

533
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,348
Come in.

534
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,520
Why, thank you.

535
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,689
Hello, darling. Come on in.

536
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,780
And I'm gonna make
you girls some lemonade.

537
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,421
Holy nutcracker, Batman.

538
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,216
Oh. Aunt Flora
does the best she can,

539
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,260
but it's a little
too much house for her.

540
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,806
I always thought she should make it
into a museum and charge admission.

541
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,225
Yeah, I'd pony up for that.

542
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,689
You know who that is?

543
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,084
You're too young to know who that is?

544
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,568
Of course I know who that is.

545
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,488
Oh, I swear that boy
had hips made of butter.

546
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,409
Not that I danced
with Mick Jagger every night.

547
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,704
Truth be told, I did
cut in on another girl...

548
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,331
For about 20 seconds
till security moved in.

549
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,375
- That's so funny.
- Yeah.

550
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,836
And you have
photographic evidence to prove it.

551
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,756
I know. Which is more than I have to say
about my burlesque career.

552
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,049
- What?
- No.

553
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,302
You were a burlesque dancer?

554
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,762
- Mmm-hmm.
- Why didn't you tell me?

555
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,724
Oh, it's not a conversation
for youngsters.

556
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,685
But that is so cool!
What is your burlesque name?

557
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,314
No, no, no.
No, no, girls. I've said quite enough.

558
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,441
No, trust me, you haven't said enough.

559
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,860
Yeah, come on, please? One shimmy.

560
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,779
No, come on, those... All right, fine.

561
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,801
Whoo!

562
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,221
You better put that leg down
before you bust a hip.

563
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,349
Thank you so much.

564
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,477
Living all this time must be amazing.

565
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,604
It has its moments.

566
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,482
Helen, would you, uh, get the apple pie

567
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,776
I've been cooling
in the kitchen, darling?

568
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,490
- Just texting my dad good night.
- Mmm.

569
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,991
He keeps tabs on me.

570
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,743
Sure.

571
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,371
So, um...

572
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,164
When do the undead show up?

573
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,751
Sometimes it's weird sounds,

574
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,545
music I didn't turn on...

575
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,465
Then suddenly,
the lights start flickering crazily.

576
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,342
And then...

577
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,804
Things just stop making sense.

578
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,515
Don't make sense how?

579
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,060
Unfortunately, one cannot be told

580
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,728
what happens at Twin Elms.

581
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,899
You have to experience it yourself.

582
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,028
You mean, like, the Matrix?

583
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,365
I knew you'd get the reference.

584
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,368
What? What, honey?

585
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,370
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

586
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,163
What, darling? Helen, what is it?

587
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,540
What? What? What?

588
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,333
There was in...
In the window.

589
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:07,253
It was a face, out the window.
It was looking at me...

590
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,131
- And it was, like, disgusting.
- What do you mean?

591
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,008
It was like a warthog or something.

592
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,176
The pig farmer.

593
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,929
- Have you seen him before?
- Never in the fIesh.

594
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,389
Ew! I hate that word.

595
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,659
Wait! That thing
might still be out there.

596
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:20,683
Hope so.

597
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,768
Oh, my gosh.

598
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,189
Baller move, Drew.

599
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,484
Hunting down a ghost
in front of a haunted mansion,

600
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,153
and you forgot to bring a flashlight.

601
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,287
God. Son of a...

602
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,830
Hey, Nancy.

603
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,285
Flora got you picking up trash
here at Twin Elms, too?

604
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,087
Deputy Patrick?

605
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,339
You scared the bejesus out of me.

606
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,799
What are you doing out here?

607
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,136
I didn't like the way
Sheriff talked to Flora yesterday,

608
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:01,515
so I figured I'd come up here
and check the place out myself.

609
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:06,896
That's awfully nice of you,
and a little random.

610
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,522
Not really.

611
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,816
I've been coming out to Twin Elms
since I was a kid.

612
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,736
Flora actually used to pay me
to mow her lawns in the summer,

613
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,300
before she turned it purple and pink.

614
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,363
Yeah.

615
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,575
Oh, you haven't happened to see...

616
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,995
A pig-man running around, did you?

617
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,205
What?

618
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,501
Helen thought she saw
a pigmonger-esque thing.

619
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,796
Oh! So, you saw the Colfax ghost?

620
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,714
You know him?

621
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,050
Everybody in River Heights
knows the story.

622
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,987
But no one's actually
ever seen him in the flesh.

623
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,137
Please. Please don't say that word.

624
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,265
Fair enough.

625
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,472
You think Jeffrey Barnes
had something to do with it?

626
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,270
You recognized his car?

627
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,981
I went to school with
Derek's older brothers.

628
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,400
Spoiled bunch. All of 'em.

629
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,903
Are you linking them with the ghost?

630
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,826
Okay, well. I wanna walk
the property once more before I leave.

631
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,662
And call me if anything else happens.

632
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,373
And tell Flora I'll drop in on her
to make sure everything's okay.

633
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,041
Thanks, Deputy.

634
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,585
Maybe you're not as big a tool
as I thought you were.

635
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,244
Why, thank you, Nancy.

636
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,651
Maybe you're not as much of
a pain in the butt I thought you were.

637
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,801
Much obliged.

638
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,889
Oh, you, uh, might have an easier time
getting around with a little more light.

639
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:27,268
- Here.
- Oh, right. Thanks.

640
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,853
Stay outta trouble.

641
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,479
You know me.

642
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,857
Fortunately, I do.

643
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:41,448
I told you, Derek and his entire family
are away on vacation.

644
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,742
Mmm-hmm. What a perfectly timed alibi.

645
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,245
I call.

646
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,164
All right. I'll see your 10 cents,

647
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,542
and raise you another 10.

648
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,962
Okay, Nancy, if you're such a genius,

649
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,465
then why would Derek scare me
and my aunt just to get back at you?

650
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,719
You tell me. Rich people are psychos.

651
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,763
I thought your dad
was a lawyer. And I'm out.

652
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,932
Not that kind of lawyer.

653
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:10,519
I mean, half of his clients
don't have enough money to pay him.

654
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,396
I forgot your dad's such a saint.

655
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,483
And your mother, Nancy?

656
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,904
My mom was a civil rights advocate.

657
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:25,618
She badgered politicians to
open their eyes and help the little guy.

658
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,202
Did she prank them?

659
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,290
She may have had
a more subtle approach than I do.

660
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,960
Look, there's more than
one black Mercedes in River Heights.

661
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,296
Not with the same
license plate, there isn't.

662
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,422
Make up your mind.

663
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,826
Earlier, you said you didn't
see the license plate clearly.

664
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,468
Derek did not do this.

665
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,554
And when you find out that I am right,
you will owe me a major apology.

666
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,807
If I find out you're right,
I'll vote you for prom queen.

667
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,578
- I'm already prom queen.
- All right, girls.

668
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,854
Girls, this game is not
gonna bet itself. Let's go.

669
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,608
It's just you and me, Flora.

670
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,984
Your move.

671
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:02,446
All right. Straight flush.
Read 'em and weep.

672
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,742
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, well, that's creepy.

673
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,037
Oh!

674
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,830
I... I saw it!

675
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,499
- I saw it!
- What did you see?

676
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,250
I don't know. A shadow.

677
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,752
Oh!

678
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,471
Under the tabIe!

679
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,103
Really?

680
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,356
Oh! Cover your eyes, girls!

681
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,358
- Why?
- Just trust me!

682
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,467
Is it just me or are
the light bulbs floating?

683
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:51,263
Oh, God, I hate this part.

684
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,858
Whatever's happening, there's a
perfectly logical explanation for this.

685
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,736
Totally logical.

686
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,538
What do you usually do
when this happens?

687
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,040
Pray.

688
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,257
Nancy!

689
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,176
Ow!

690
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,730
Let go of me! Nancy!

691
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,817
Oh, no, you don't! No, you don't!

692
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,694
You let her go!
Let her go, I say!

693
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,781
No, no.

694
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,542
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's get out of here.

695
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,795
Come on, guys. Get out of the kitchen.
Out, out, out of the kitchen!

696
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,049
Wait.

697
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,801
Everybody in here, quick.

698
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,470
Come on! Go!

699
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,974
Wait, no! There's that thing, the pig!

700
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,769
Whatever happens, don't open this door.

701
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:21,854
Nancy!

702
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,701
A rubber mask, really?

703
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,828
Step up your game, dude.

704
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,748
Never mind.

705
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,469
Who's scared now, Nancy?

706
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,564
Nancy. Nancy, it's okay.

707
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,858
Oh, darling,
after every haunting,

708
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,277
I get that same awful headache.

709
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,196
It shouId be gone soon.

710
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,743
Well, I was hoping to wake up

711
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,954
and realize this was
all some crazy dream.

712
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,844
Hey, Dad. Everything's great.

713
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,388
We may have had a ghost sighting.

714
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,826
I wanna tell you all about it,

715
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,769
but Flora's just about to
serve us some breakfast, so...

716
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,980
Well, that sounds exciting.
I want to hear all about it.

717
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,650
Yeah, yeah, I'll give you
the blow-by-blow when I see ya.

718
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:50,817
Thanks, Dad.

719
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,611
Okay. Love ya.

720
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,404
Love you more.

721
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,157
Here, dear.

722
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,868
This ought to help
fight off those dragons.

723
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,664
So, what happened exactly?

724
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,124
You saved us from the ghost.

725
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,417
Well, all I remember

726
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,420
is screaming like a baby
before everything went black.

727
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:17,219
And here I thought my cheese
was finally sliding off the cracker.

728
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,765
Now that I know the haunting is real,

729
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,850
I kinda wish I were senile.

730
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:30,023
You guys don't think that last night
was actually supernatural, do you?

731
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,484
Well, how else would you explain it?

732
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,320
I mean, that thing dragged me
around the house at NASCAR speeds,

733
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,406
and then it disappeared
and then it reappeared

734
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,824
in another part of the house.

735
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,410
What about the floating light bulbs?

736
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,203
No, there's gotta be an explanation.

737
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,288
Like...

738
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,208
Well, so what do we know?

739
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,378
One, we know a black Mercedes
was lurking around Twin Elms.

740
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,006
- Nancy, I told you...
- I know, I know.

741
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,008
I'm just stating the facts. Okay?

742
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,343
I'll give you a chance
to prove me wrong.

743
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:02,180
Two, we know somebody came
in here and scared us half to death.

744
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:05,100
And three, we know
it felt insanely real.

745
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,621
Were all the doors and windows
locked last night?

746
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,105
Oh, yes.
I double-check them every night.

747
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,357
Are you sure?
Maybe... I mean, the...

748
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,901
This is an old house.
Maybe the locks don't work so well.

749
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,030
I had the locks redone
just last year.

750
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,577
Wait, did you guys...

751
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,287
Did you guys notice these footprints?

752
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,247
I thought you did that last night

753
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:30,083
when you were running around
in the pink grass.

754
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,210
No. No. I wipe my feet.

755
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,587
I'm very well-trained.

756
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,871
As if this house isn't messy enough.

757
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,916
Oh, yes, somewhere in here,
there must be a...

758
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,767
I can't believe it.

759
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,903
Well, you don't see that every day.

760
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:25,907
Mean girls first.

761
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,327
I'm just kidding.

762
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,333
- Stay here, Auntie.
- Oh.

763
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:37,043
You don't have to tell me twice.

764
00:46:57,857 --> 00:47:01,067
This must have been some kind
of servants' quarters back in the day.

765
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,463
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

766
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,969
Oh.

767
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,639
More pink footprints.

768
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,060
Ah, yes! A dark, creepy tunnel.

769
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,020
I told you this was gonna be awesome.

770
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,415
Huh.

771
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,085
Now we know how they got in.

772
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:01,253
Mmm.

773
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:12,973
Oh. So, that's how they
attacked me with the drawers.

774
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,938
Well, we're gonna have
to break it to Flora

775
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,982
there's no skeletons in these walls.

776
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,609
Oh, right.

777
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,737
Hey, Nancy, come take a look at this.

778
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,620
Oh, this must be
how they control the lights.

779
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,415
But I wonder what this controls.

780
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,002
The ghost must have an accomplice.

781
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:43,920
Okay.

782
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,007
But, why did it feel so real?

783
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,385
If people expect a ghost,
they'll see a ghost.

784
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,096
I think something more
than suggestion is at work here.

785
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,600
Well, it could have been
sound waves or carbon monoxide.

786
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,394
No, if it was carbon monoxide,
you'd be a ghost, too.

787
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,479
But it could have been
some type of drug.

788
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,607
Could someone have spiked your food?

789
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,983
Not a chance.

790
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,526
I bought that food yesterday.

791
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,070
No one but the three of us
touched it before dinner.

792
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,656
Well, thanks for the help.

793
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,491
- I'll let you know what we find out.
- Bye.

794
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,784
Later.

795
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,537
What about visitors?

796
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,789
I mean, this place
needs a lot of upkeep.

797
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,583
Maybe the guys who painted

798
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,336
your grass or a plumber,
or a carpenter?

799
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,296
Good idea. I'll make a list.

800
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,219
Wow. That's a lot of people.

801
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,554
Mmm-hmm.

802
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:37,140
I included some of my gentlemen callers.

803
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,850
Oh, Auntie!

804
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,186
What? Too many?

805
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,063
Never.

806
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,231
Thank you.

807
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,695
Hello, my name's Nancy Drew.

808
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,031
I understand you recently did
some work at Twin Elms.

809
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,159
Hi, this is Helen Corning.

810
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,912
My aunt hired you to
rebuild her gazebo?

811
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,997
You replaced the plumbing?

812
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,291
You did the plaster work?

813
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,834
You replaced the windows?

814
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:09,089
Oh. Oops, sorry.
I didn't mean to call you.

815
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,800
Really?

816
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,427
Are you sure about that?

817
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,598
No, that's great.
Yes, yes, thank you.

818
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,266
The air conditioner!

819
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,395
Hmm...

820
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,981
You said the repairman
came over two weeks ago,

821
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,734
but the company had no record
of sending anyone.

822
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,195
Wait. What is this thing?

823
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,115
There's a hose connected to the AC.

824
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,994
I don't know,
but it was taped to the pole.

825
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,746
What is that?

826
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:43,763
We should take that
to the police.

827
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,168
Yeah, well,
let me connect the dots first.

828
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,253
We have to get this to the chem lab,

829
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,797
you know, isolate the chemicals,
find out where it came from.

830
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,967
And you just so happen to know
a chemist that can help us with that?

831
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,137
No, but I know someone who can.
Bess and George.

832
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,476
Oh, God. Oh, man.
I'm late for community service.

833
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,020
Chemicals?

834
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,250
Identification is no problem.

835
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,001
I got chromatography papers
in the lab at school

836
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,129
and this sick new chem app
on my phone. So, it's okay.

837
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:13,778
- Okay.
- Drew!

838
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,781
You took advantage
of Deputy Patrick yesterday,

839
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:18,386
but you're not taking advantage of me.

840
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,829
Well, hey, I can talk
and pick up trash at the same time.

841
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,414
Not on my watch.

842
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:25,809
If you don't get back to work,

843
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,633
I'm gonna add two more weeks
to your sentence.

844
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,378
Oh, come on. Why stop at two?

845
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,797
- Nancy.
- We can make it four, if you want.

846
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,591
Here.

847
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,426
So you don't end up
with a life sentence.

848
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,886
This should help.

849
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,101
Get out of my sight, Drew.
You're free to go.

850
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,906
What just happened?

851
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,616
What does it look like?

852
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,201
I mean, I got Nancy pardoned.

853
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,660
One of the lesser-known advantages

854
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,788
of being from the oldest family
in River Heights.

855
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,539
Don't you mean "richest"?

856
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,958
Don't you mean, "Thank you"?

857
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,126
Oh.

858
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:11,491
You guys coming or what?

859
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,129
Come on.

860
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,256
I'm gonna...

861
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,686
Hey, you behaving?

862
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:31,064
Of course. How's your trip?

863
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,816
Well, I'm leaving now.

864
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,220
I'll text you when I get there.
It'll be a couple of hours.

865
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,612
- Okay. Love ya.
- Love you more.

866
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,991
Am I the only one not cool
with Helen being here?

867
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,868
Her great-aunt is the one in trouble.

868
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,495
So, what,

869
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,164
you make nice with the nerdy chicks
until you get what you want?

870
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:50,708
Hey, you're the ones
who attacked my boyfriend.

871
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,794
After he harassed Bess online.

872
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,254
Hey, guys.

873
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,840
This isn't about our problem.
It's about Flora.

874
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,592
So, let's just isolate
whatever's in this tank,

875
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,469
and we can talk later. Okay?

876
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,137
Fine.

877
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,183
So... How do we get in?

878
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,519
Well, I figured you know
how to pick a lock.

879
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:12,272
Oh. So, I get in
a little trouble with the fuzz

880
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,107
and now I'm public enemy number one?

881
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,151
- No, I just thought that...
- Seriously, Nance,

882
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,528
you gonna pick the lock or what?

883
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:20,196
Well, yeah, totally.

884
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,157
Don't worry about it.

885
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,169
Sorry. This... This takes all night.

886
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,638
You can't even go a night
without talking to your bae?

887
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,729
Okay. You guys are just jealous
because you don't have anyone.

888
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:55,398
Oh, you mean, no one to hide behind?

889
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,984
Okay.

890
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,737
Who's still hungry? I know I am.

891
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,781
Maybe now's a good time
to break out that cheesecake.

892
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,074
Okay.

893
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,035
Good idea.

894
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,121
Come on, guys, take a bite.

895
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,290
Yeah, this is seriously
God's cheesecake.

896
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,042
Oh. Blueberry.

897
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,419
That remind you of anyone, Helen?

898
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,828
We're not gonna eat traitor cake.

899
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:27,263
Technically, Helen's not a traitor.
She's just our enemy.

900
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,436
Probably shouldn't eat any anyways,
my skin is a mess.

901
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,689
Well, if you don't wanna eat cheesecake,
that's fine, don't eat it.

902
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,734
But you really shouldn't worry
about sweets giving you pimples, Bess.

903
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,945
That's the best thing
about being so smart.

904
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,948
You don't have to look pretty.
You won't be going out, anyways.

905
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,117
- You're freaking dead.
- Let's go for it.

906
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,327
Whoa. Guys, stop!

907
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,121
I can sit here
and pretend to be polite,

908
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,559
but it doesn't change the fact that
she's the girlfriend of some guy

909
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,001
that thinks it's okay
to humiliate another human being.

910
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:59,712
You know exactIy what he did,
and you did nothing to stop it.

911
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,297
What was I supposed to do?

912
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,675
I don't know. You could've
unfollowed him on Instagram,

913
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,134
threatened to break up with him,

914
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,887
expressed even
the slightest shred of disapproval.

915
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:11,307
That's so easy for you to say.
You have nothing to lose.

916
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,393
Maybe, but at least
I still have my soul.

917
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,980
- George, come on...
- Nancy, are you that blind?

918
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,984
What, just because you found a new
friend that's more popular than we are?

919
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,778
Well, is that really
what you think of me?

920
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:26,155
I don't know what
to think anymore, Nance.

921
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,533
But I do know that as soon
as all of this is over,

922
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,536
she's gonna go right back to
laughing at all of us behind our backs.

923
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,080
You don't know what it's like to be me.

924
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,958
People are constantly
expecting things out of me,

925
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,002
like how I look,
and who I can hang out with,

926
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,438
and who I don't hang out with and...

927
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,296
Oh, blah, blah, blah.

928
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,882
"Don't hate me because
I'm rich and I'm pretty."

929
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,427
- I didn't say that!
- Then what did you say?

930
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,846
'Cause I sure didn't hear
a "sorry" anywhere in there.

931
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,182
I don't know, but I am sorry.

932
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,188
It's ready.

933
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,192
Look, Helen.

934
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:08,781
I appreciate you, you know,
getting me outta community service.

935
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,325
I get it. I should go home.

936
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,496
And I'll Iet you know what we find out.

937
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:16,914
Thank you.

938
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,463
Good riddance.

939
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,007
Come on, you guys.

940
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,259
It's over.

941
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:38,978
Does anyone smell butterscotch
pudding, like, on a burning tire?

942
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,605
I was gonna say, uh...

943
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:42,690
Bug spray souffIe.

944
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,192
That's eggnog on fire.

945
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,582
It is the same chemical
found in all of those things.

946
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,958
Myristicin.

947
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,252
Myristi-what? What is that?

948
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:05,297
It's a psychoactive compound
isolated from nutmeg.

949
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:08,549
So, somebody made us
see ghosts with nutmeg?

950
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:11,344
Yeah. You know,
it's a little-known fact,

951
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,638
but if it's consumed
in high enough concentrations,

952
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,033
it can cause
all types of physical reactions,

953
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,201
like nausea or hallucinations,

954
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:18,119
and then you wake up
with a really nasty hangover.

955
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,788
You said the hose was
connected to the vent,

956
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,412
so someone had a way of releasing
the chemical when the AC was on.

957
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,567
Didn't know you knew so much
about hallucinogenic drugs.

958
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,027
Chemistry's awesome.

959
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,947
But it says that
you'd need a lot of nutmeg

960
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,323
before you could get any effect.

961
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,968
Well, the concentration in that canister

962
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,553
was 50 times
more powerful and aerosolized,

963
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,037
so it hit your brains instantly.

964
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,040
So, somebody must be
buying a lot of nutmeg.

965
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,345
Can you guys track
that down in the morning?

966
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,961
Uh-oh!

967
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,212
It is morning.

968
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,925
I better go over to Derek's house
and try to get him to confess.

969
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:53,302
I'm taking the evidence.

970
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,096
Is this safe to carry?

971
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:58,057
Yeah. Just don't drop it.

972
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,694
I said don't. Okay, just don't...

973
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:04,021
Yeah, just don't drop it.
It's not funny.

974
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,482
Stop messing with her.

975
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,403
Not funny.

976
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,738
It can kill people.

977
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,073
Call Dad.

978
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,930
You've reached Carson Drew.

979
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:19,996
Please leave a message.

980
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,247
That's weird.

981
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,040
Hey, Dad, it's me.

982
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,418
I didn't get a text from you. Call me.

983
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,162
Busted.

984
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:44,705
Well, well.

985
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,332
Now what do we have here?

986
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:51,671
Don't you think you're
overreacting just a little?

987
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,150
- I caught you breaking into their house.
- It wasn't the house.

988
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,675
It was the garage,

989
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,094
and I was only trying to see
if the car had any evidence

990
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,971
to connect it with
the haunting of Twin Elms.

991
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,931
Which, by the way, it does.

992
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,724
Oh, yeah. Uh...

993
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,102
Pink flamingo paint.

994
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,187
Damning evidence, if I ever saw any.

995
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,273
Yeah, actually, it is damning evidence.

996
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,858
Cheese and rice, Nancy, again?

997
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,528
Handcuffs, really?

998
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,115
Don't worry, Hannah.
I've started thinking nickel's my color.

999
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,784
Your niece here was caught
breaking into the Barnes household.

1000
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,997
- Is that true?
- Depends on how you mean "true."

1001
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:30,209
Nancy, I explicitly said, "Don't go
into the garage till I get there."

1002
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:33,462
Wait. You knew about this?

1003
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,549
Yeah. I told her about it.

1004
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,846
Uh, yeah, after Deputy Patrick
checked out Twin Elms the other night,

1005
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,598
he suggested we go to, uh...

1006
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:47,852
Uh... Go investigate
the Barnes' Mercedes.

1007
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,854
I didn't want Nancy
to get in trouble again,

1008
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:52,606
so I told her I'd go
over there with her.

1009
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,400
Must have gotten our signals crossed.

1010
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,486
I thought Deputy Patrick
left me hanging,

1011
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,238
so I decided to take a look myself.

1012
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,906
With a lock pick set?

1013
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,326
It's perfectly legal to own lock picks.

1014
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,287
Up until the point where
you stick them in someone else's lock.

1015
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,414
Look, I can vouch for Nancy.

1016
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,084
Sorry. Good luck with that.

1017
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,670
If you let her go,

1018
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:16,875
I'll make sure she gets home
without any more trouble.

1019
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,389
What just happened in there?

1020
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:26,557
Wasn't gonna let my boss

1021
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,851
arrest the bravest kid in town
twice in one week.

1022
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,520
No one's ever stood up
to the Barnes family before.

1023
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,564
Because no one's ever been that dumb.

1024
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,815
Where were you last night?

1025
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,651
I told you. I stayed at Bess'.

1026
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:41,447
Really? Then why did Bess' mom
think that she was staying with us?

1027
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,993
'Cause... 'Cause Bess,
George, Helen and I

1028
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:47,787
broke into the high school

1029
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:51,248
and used the chem lab
to isolate a hallucinogenic drug

1030
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,334
that's making Flora see ghosts,

1031
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,836
but we left everything
the way we found it...

1032
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,463
That's not exactly the point.

1033
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,465
Nancy, you are out of control.

1034
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,593
You can't just do whatever you want
and expect to get away with it.

1035
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,347
Look... I made some calls.

1036
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,517
Barnes family checked in to the
Pike's Resort in Aspen four days ago.

1037
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,477
Haven't left since.

1038
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,522
So, Helen was right, but...

1039
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:17,400
- Who was driving that car to Twin Elms?
- I don't know.

1040
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,175
I'm still trying to figure that out.

1041
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,196
The police are doing their job,

1042
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,241
but next time you think about
pulling a B&E,

1043
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,326
try giving me a call first.

1044
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,913
There's some people
in this town who actually care.

1045
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:35,501
Okay, this time you are really grounded.

1046
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,379
No fake sleepovers
or haunted houses or...

1047
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,881
Especially investigations.

1048
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,800
And I'm confiscating your long board.

1049
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:46,637
Has Dad called you?

1050
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,181
No, but we don't usually argue
until after lunch.

1051
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,935
Why? You mean
he hasn't called you?

1052
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,771
- No.
- Since when?

1053
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,819
Hey, Nance. What up?

1054
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:03,863
My dad hasn't texted

1055
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,824
or returned a call
from me or Hannah in 15 hours.

1056
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,868
You know
how weird that is, Nate.

1057
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:09,952
We have a rule.

1058
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,722
Last thing at night
and first thing in the morning.

1059
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,205
You know, no exceptions.

1060
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,499
Yeah, I haven't
heard from him either.

1061
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:18,419
Well, maybe there's
no cell service at the campsite.

1062
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,837
Campsite? I...

1063
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:23,048
I thought you said he...
I thought he was at a hotel.

1064
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,342
No, no.

1065
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:28,220
This dude that
your dad's meeting, Owen Michaelson,

1066
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,514
will only close the deal
if you go camping with him.

1067
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,559
Like real camping.
Like backpacks and canteens.

1068
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,811
The cell service
is probably terrible there.

1069
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,439
But that's not like him.

1070
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:40,107
I mean, ever since Mom died

1071
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:42,526
he's been even more anal
about calling me than I am.

1072
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:43,611
Yeah, I know.

1073
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:47,114
I'm sorry, hon.
I didn't realize he hadn't told you.

1074
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,783
I got caught up
in all this train paperwork

1075
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:51,785
and didn't think to check on you.

1076
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,497
I'm falling down
on my godfather duties.

1077
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,166
If he calls, I will make sure
that you talk to him.

1078
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,627
- Okay, Nate. Thanks.
- Sure thing.

1079
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,338
Well, who'd have thunk?

1080
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:05,466
Carson camping. Huh, that's a relief.

1081
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:39,667
No phone number.

1082
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,635
- Hey.
- We found the spice company.

1083
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,595
Bess and I
are suiting up to go con our way

1084
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,764
into their records room right now.

1085
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,243
They'll never know
what hit them.

1086
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:56,725
You sound weird.

1087
01:04:56,810 --> 01:05:00,145
My dad hasn't called
in 18 hours. I mean...

1088
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,483
Something's off
and I can't put my finger on it.

1089
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,277
Your gut
is usually right, Drew.

1090
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,945
When in doubt, listen to it.

1091
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,031
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

1092
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,184
Holy cow! You scared...

1093
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,272
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you okay? What happened?

1094
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,065
Yeah.

1095
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,862
I know I'm the last person
you wanna see right now,

1096
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,574
but I broke up with Derek.

1097
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:56,702
Wow. I didn't know you had it in you.

1098
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,078
But what did he do?

1099
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,955
Nothing, it was all me.

1100
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,416
Okay, sorry,
can we talk about this in the car?

1101
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:05,377
- Huh? Yeah.
- My aunt's car. Come on.

1102
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:06,629
Can you drive?

1103
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,255
Technically...

1104
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,862
You know, George is right about me.

1105
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,012
I mean, what I said about Bess
was horrible.

1106
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,764
Who would say that
about another person?

1107
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,807
You've got a point.

1108
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:21,435
But the thing is
I don't even know why I said it.

1109
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,771
It just came
out of my mouth like...

1110
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:27,816
I guess some part of me
was still trying to defend Derek.

1111
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,943
I really like Bess.

1112
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,571
In a different world, we'd be friends.

1113
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:41,307
You skate a lot better than you drive.

1114
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,123
Well, no one drives in Chicago.

1115
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,217
Look, just...

1116
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,387
Just do what you think
is right, you know?

1117
01:06:56,471 --> 01:07:00,265
Don't do what other peopIe
expect you to do.

1118
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,601
That's so freakin' terrifying.

1119
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,103
And you have no idea.

1120
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:07,231
It's just so easy for you
and George and Bess,

1121
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:09,400
because you're just so good at things.

1122
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,193
Important things, that matter.

1123
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:14,113
And you're funny and you're smart.

1124
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,366
What do I have
other than my hair and Derek?

1125
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,285
Well, you actually
don't have Derek anymore.

1126
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,539
Your hair's amazing.

1127
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,585
You know, I'm supposed to be
the hero in my own story,

1128
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,712
but I'm the villain.

1129
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,340
I mean, I've never
had to be brave or smart

1130
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:35,259
and definiteIy never had to be nice.

1131
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,553
Maybe now's your chance.

1132
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:40,139
At least the brave part.
"Nice" we can...

1133
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,599
Work on.

1134
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,977
Mmm-hmm.

1135
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,730
And speaking of nice, how...

1136
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,524
How good are you at accepting apologies?

1137
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,026
Apologies? For what?

1138
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,655
I was wrong about the Barnes' alibi.

1139
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:59,116
I told you, Nancy Drew.

1140
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,952
I'm sorry. No,
I should have believed you.

1141
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,663
I'd grovel at your feet...

1142
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,292
But I'm having
a little trouble driving.

1143
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:11,962
You have no idea
how good it feels to be right.

1144
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,466
And there's one other thing.

1145
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:21,221
I think that whoIe vigilante justice

1146
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:24,558
might not be the direction
I wanna go in for my future.

1147
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,602
Are you apologizing about Derek?

1148
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:31,857
I don't know
if I wanna go that far, you know, but...

1149
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,030
Can I just say that maybe

1150
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,991
revenge isn't the answer.

1151
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,326
That sort of thing.

1152
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,162
Thank you, Nancy.

1153
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,455
Yeah, well...

1154
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,710
Just don't wanna be
that girI, you know?

1155
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,673
So, I guess we have no suspect.

1156
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:58,509
I've got ideas, but...

1157
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,262
Well, I've gotta find my dad first.

1158
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:05,432
Let's start this car again.

1159
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,074
Yo! What gives?

1160
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,078
I can't do this.
You gotta... You gotta go.

1161
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,830
You're the chemistry genius.

1162
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,768
Anyone asks me a serious question,
the ruse ain't gonna hold.

1163
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,168
You'll be fine. I can tell you
everything you need to know.

1164
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,754
Yeah, I will be fine

1165
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,048
because you're gonna go in there

1166
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,132
and you're gonna do this.

1167
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:44,763
See? Look at you.

1168
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,642
I have one
tiny adjustment, though.

1169
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,228
Oh. Oh.

1170
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,816
See? You look dangerous.

1171
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,237
I feel kinda dangerous.

1172
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,947
Feel empowered
just standing next to you.

1173
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,034
Now, go in there,
track down some nutmeg.

1174
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:07,703
Okay.

1175
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,539
- Got it. All right.
- Yeah. You got it.

1176
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:29,933
Got his room key.

1177
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:32,811
Dad?

1178
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:35,606
Dad, are you here?

1179
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:39,192
Hey, who leaves
their cell phone during a business trip?

1180
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,787
After I talked to him last night
he never got any of my messages.

1181
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,415
I mean, Nate said
he was out of cell range.

1182
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,834
I mean, this makes no sense.

1183
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,545
Okay, stay focused.
What are the cIues?

1184
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:04,885
I don't know. I have no idea.

1185
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,638
Okay, take a deep breath

1186
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:09,556
and do your thing.

1187
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:11,558
You got this.

1188
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,735
Maybe we got something
better than clues.

1189
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,571
I already gave you
the keys to the room.

1190
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,991
You are not getting access
to the security feed, too.

1191
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,202
I told you
this is a matter of life and death.

1192
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,205
"I told you
this is a matter of life and death."

1193
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,040
Don't mock me.

1194
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,001
Clearly you care about
customer satisfaction.

1195
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:39,336
Not really.

1196
01:11:55,687 --> 01:11:56,895
Ooh!

1197
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,564
Somebody put a little more
than cream and sugar in this.

1198
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,734
Get out of here!
This is nothing but coffee.

1199
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,570
Then why is it so sticky?

1200
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,156
Ugh!

1201
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,200
Well, your boss is not gonna like it

1202
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,703
when he finds out
you've been drinking on the job.

1203
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,375
Here it is.

1204
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,766
What's he doing to my dad?

1205
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,936
It looks like
he's just putting him to sleep.

1206
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:39,563
Yeah, but how do we know that?

1207
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,314
If he wanted to hurt your dad

1208
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,192
he would've used a gun
or a knife or something.

1209
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,779
It can't be a robbery.

1210
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,240
All he wanted was my dad.

1211
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,451
Well, at least we know what happened.

1212
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,411
We have the evidence,
we can go to the police.

1213
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,833
Can't see the kidnapper's face.

1214
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:13,555
Oh, man.

1215
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,521
Wait, wait. It looks really familiar.

1216
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,482
Come on, Drew, think.

1217
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,777
Anything?

1218
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:43,627
This happened last night
while we were at the chem lab.

1219
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,759
We did it, Nancy.

1220
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,112
You would've been so proud of me.

1221
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,197
What are you talking about?

1222
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:54,573
Bess found the name
of the nutmeg buyer.

1223
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:55,764
It's William Wharton.

1224
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,517
Do me a favor.

1225
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:01,728
Tell your daddy that
Willie Wharton said to get on board.

1226
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:03,688
Now get out of the way.

1227
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,109
Wharton kidnapped my dad.

1228
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:08,944
He's been haunting Twin Elms.

1229
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:12,948
Look, look, guys, I love you guys
so much and everything, but...

1230
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,408
I gotta go. Talk to you...

1231
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,911
Call you when I know more.
Okay? Bye.

1232
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:20,497
We have the evidence. Let's get help.

1233
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,918
Deputy? Yes, I figured out
a bunch of stuff.

1234
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:26,294
Can you meet me at Twin Elms?

1235
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,213
Thanks.

1236
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,008
I think my dad's
in the hidden staircase.

1237
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:36,763
Wharton doesn't know we know it exists,
and he kidnapped my dad after we left.

1238
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:38,765
Come on.

1239
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,828
Sheriff?

1240
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,290
Trying you again. Sheriff?

1241
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,172
Deputy Patrick.
Come in. Over.

1242
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,203
Oh, my God.

1243
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:44,706
- Deputy? Deputy, wake up.
- Okay.

1244
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,543
Okay. He's not dead,
he's just really knocked out.

1245
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,091
Wharton must be here.

1246
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,366
Darn flashlight.

1247
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,215
Why are you doing this?

1248
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:36,508
You're too good a lawyer.

1249
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:40,053
You were persuading people who
wanted the train to change their minds.

1250
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:43,682
Come on. You got some paperwork to sign.

1251
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,602
Out.

1252
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:50,605
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1253
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:58,738
- Let's go.
- Nate.

1254
01:16:58,823 --> 01:16:59,823
Thank God.

1255
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,950
"Thank God." That's funny.

1256
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,328
Ow. Wait.

1257
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:06,705
You're a part of this?

1258
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,874
Part of it?
He's the one who brought me into it.

1259
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:15,380
You were best man at my wedding.

1260
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,300
You were a pallbearer
at Catherine's funeral.

1261
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,051
That guy is like my uncle.

1262
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,971
I'm sorry, Carson. I had to.

1263
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:26,933
How much is the train company
paying you to deliver Twin Elms?

1264
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:28,018
A lot.

1265
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,268
You could have come to me
if you needed money, Nate.

1266
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:34,941
But I got in a hole so deep
you couldn't possibly dig me out.

1267
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,277
This was supposed to be clean.

1268
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,821
We scare Flora,
she sells, she makes bank.

1269
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,574
Town gets a new train,
I get out of debt.

1270
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,200
Everybody wins.

1271
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:47,495
We were fighting to stop the train.

1272
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,123
Yeah. I'm pretty convincing, huh?

1273
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,959
A coupIe more scary nights,

1274
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:55,337
and Flora would have begged to sell.

1275
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:56,921
And then Nancy got involved.

1276
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,132
Hey, we can't do anything.

1277
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:01,551
Not with them having guns.

1278
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,845
They may have guns,
but we have something better.

1279
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,308
Sign the form.

1280
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:11,519
I've told you very politeIy... No.

1281
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,104
Listen to the lady.

1282
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:16,983
You know, for a guy half in the bag,
you sure handle stress pretty well.

1283
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:19,444
He has a teenage daughter.

1284
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:27,077
Why would you go to all this trouble
for one plot of land?

1285
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:28,661
In going through Twin Elms,

1286
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:31,831
all the other property owners
would fall in line.

1287
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,185
Nobody would be able to stop the train.

1288
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:37,295
But there's no way
I'll allow the sale to go through, Nate.

1289
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,880
We know.

1290
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,965
That's why I'm afraid
we can't let you leave.

1291
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,343
Hey. No, no, no. Come here.

1292
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,682
We never talked about killing anyone.

1293
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:51,036
I figured you couldn't handle it.

1294
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,660
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it myself.

1295
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,020
No, no. Hey. No.

1296
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:57,190
No, there's no...
There's no reason to harm him.

1297
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,295
I've been forging his signature

1298
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,838
ever since he came back
to River Heights.

1299
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:02,862
Look.

1300
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,283
Carson will keep his mouth shut
because he wants to live.

1301
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:08,368
Right?

1302
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,286
You know me better than that, Nate.

1303
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:13,248
There's no way to keep these two
from talking about this.

1304
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,268
And if you think
anybody's gonna fall for your plan

1305
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:16,543
in framing Jeffrey Barnes,

1306
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:18,753
then you're even stupider
than I thought.

1307
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,965
I've survived four husbands,

1308
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:24,592
to be killed by your sorry butt.

1309
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,015
That brat found the room.

1310
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,313
What...

1311
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:42,110
Don't worry, dear. Just another
normal Saturday night for me.

1312
01:19:45,156 --> 01:19:46,614
That sounds like the back door.

1313
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,533
I'll take care of her.

1314
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,386
Stupid son of a...

1315
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,245
Nancy, now!

1316
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:46,424
Help! Help me!

1317
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:47,717
Help!

1318
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:49,802
Ahh! Help!

1319
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,140
Run, Helen!

1320
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,781
Nobody move and I won't hurt her.

1321
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,908
Let her go. She's just a child!

1322
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,035
You're not a murderer, Nate.

1323
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:17,914
You gonna get that?

1324
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,145
Shut up for once. Just shut up!

1325
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:23,294
Please, let her go!

1326
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:28,883
Come on.

1327
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:46,359
I'll untie the others!

1328
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:15,179
Help!

1329
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:24,188
Get it off me!

1330
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:31,738
It's okay.

1331
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,317
Get off me!

1332
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,580
Get it off me!

1333
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,460
Well, you don't see that every day.

1334
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:53,843
Should've brought cover, Drew.

1335
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:57,263
I... I may have to
follow up with you later.

1336
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:00,850
Hey, Deputy...

1337
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,060
Thanks for everything.

1338
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:04,729
Thanks for believing in me.

1339
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,065
It's what I'm here for.

1340
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,525
Wait. Your flashlight.

1341
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,194
- Let me get it for you.
- You keep it.

1342
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:13,454
Something tells me
you're gonna need it again.

1343
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:16,449
Hey...

1344
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:18,785
No matter what your future holds,

1345
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:22,163
you can always brag about the day
you turned a grown man pink.

1346
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:23,933
Different guy, new shade.

1347
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,958
It's not the same.
I don't do those things anymore.

1348
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,002
Right. Come on.

1349
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:29,379
Hey, Helen, are you coming?

1350
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:31,673
Yeah, I figured, since...

1351
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:33,966
It's over, you know.

1352
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,094
Yeah, we'd all just
go back to hating you?

1353
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,572
Yeah,
you're not getting off that easy.

1354
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:40,848
Besides, you still owe us
a slice of traitor cake.

1355
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,893
- Aha!
- I... I told you it's enemy cake.

1356
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,938
- Leave it alone.
- Well, you could just learn the word.

1357
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,898
The right word. It'd be so much easier.

1358
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,900
It's Aunt Flora's cheesecake.

1359
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:53,152
I'll catch up to you guys in a few.

1360
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:02,954
Bet you never thought
you'd be saving your own dad, did you?

1361
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,748
You know how many times
you saved my butt?

1362
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:10,545
Hey.

1363
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:12,672
Hey.

1364
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,968
I don't know what I'd do
if anything ever happened to you.

1365
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,611
Let me go. I wanna... I wanna do one.

1366
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:38,056
- You do it. I don't know what I'm doing.
- All right, cool.

1367
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,009
- That's not bad.
- I really want...

1368
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,744
What was that? What was that?

1369
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,681
I just wanted to see
what was gonna happen.

1370
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:45,913
You know, maybe I could

1371
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,124
get used to
this small town life after all.

1372
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,292
Oh, that reminds me.

1373
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,216
My cousin Emily
is coming home to River Heights

1374
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:53,171
to get married at the Lilac Inn.

1375
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:55,006
And after all we've been through,

1376
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,508
we could use a little fun in the sun,
don't you think?

1377
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,093
Of course. Yes. Sounds good to me.

1378
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:01,554
Sure. Deep lake, a dark forest,

1379
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:02,889
some creepy old inn.

1380
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:04,140
What could possibly go wrong?

1381
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,910
Yeah, all we need is an evil twin

1382
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,227
and we'll have the makings
of an awesome new mystery.

1383
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:09,604
I have to get a photo with us.

1384
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:12,106
Come on, Nancy, get in the picture.

1385
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:14,692
- Come on, Bess.
- Fine. Okay.

1386
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:17,069
You guys are so pretty.
One, two, three.

1387
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,072
#sleuthing.

1388
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,326
Actually, I'm done with mysteries.
