1
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,669
There was a time when
"energy" was a dirty word.

2
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,189
When turning on your
lights was a hard choice.

3
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:27,069
Cities in brownout,...

4
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:30,469
food shortages,
cars burning fuel to run.

5
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:31,989
But that was the past.

6
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:35,789
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?

7
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:37,869
Make deserts bloom!

8
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:42,389
Right now, we are the largest
producer of fusion energy in the world.

9
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,069
The energy of the sun,
trapped in rock,

10
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:47,669
harvested by machine from
the far side of the moon.

11
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:52,069
Today, we deliver enough
clean-burning helium-3...

12
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:55,669
to supply the energy needs
of nearly 70% of the planet.

13
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:59,789
Who would have thought that all
energy we ever needed

14
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:01,789
is right above our heads?

15
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,269
The power of the moon...

16
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:08,069
the power of our future.

17
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,269
Rock and roll!
08:32, Pacific Time.

18
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,269
All harvesters running smoothly.

19
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,069
Readouts are as follows:

20
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:27,789
Matthew...14.6 miles.

21
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,189
Mark...16.8 miles.

22
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:31,989
I don't—

23
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,469
Hey, Gerty? Gerty?
Wake up!

24
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,469
Good morning, Sam!

25
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,389
We have got a live one on Mark!

26
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:48,189
I'm going to go out
now and rope her in.

27
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,589
OK, Sam.

28
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:44,789
I want chocolate.

29
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:46,589
I think you're sweet enough.

30
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:47,989
You don't need chocolate.

31
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,669
[Computer]:
Searching for long-range comms.

32
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,069
Searching for long-range comms.

33
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:13,269
Signal failure on long-range comms.

34
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:23,869
Sam Bell, reporting to Central...

35
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:26,789
10:14, Pacific Time.

36
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:31,069
I have a full container full of helium-3,
ready to roll.

37
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,869
By the time this message reaches you,
it should be in transit.

38
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:35,989
Otherwise, everything running smoothly...

39
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:38,669
How are things down there?

40
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,069
You guys been having any...

41
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,989
good parties or anything?

42
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:46,989
Oh, thanks for the...(stumbles)

43
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:50,669
for the football feed!
It almost felt live.

44
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:52,789
Almost!

45
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,469
Three years is a long haul.

46
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:00,589
You know—
It's way, way, way, way, way too long!

47
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,669
I'm talking to myself...

48
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,389
on a regular basis!

49
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:05,669
So...

50
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,269
Time to go home,
you know what I mean?

51
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,589
That's it,
over and out!

52
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:15,069
Rock and roll,
God bless America!

53
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:34,669
I can do that for you, Sam.

54
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:40,589
God damn it!
I said I got it!

55
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:43,189
Why don't you listen to me?

56
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:52,789
Package ready for launch.

57
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,069
Sam, is everything OK?

58
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,469
- Sam?
- What?

59
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,189
You don't seem like yourself today.

60
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,189
- Is something wrong?
- No. Can you turn that off, please?

61
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,069
Jesus Christ!

62
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,269
Sam, it might help you
to talk about it.

63
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:39,989
Gerty, have you heard anything new
about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?

64
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:41,389
the setting of monthly satellite dishes?

65
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,629
No, Sam.

66
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:44,549
From what I understand,
it is fairly low...

67
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,869
on the company's priority list right now.

68
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:48,389
You tell them to sort that out.

69
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,789
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not—

70
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:52,869
I've only got two weeks!

71
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,869
But it's not fair for
whoever's coming up here next.

72
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:59,469
I will, Sam. Do you want me
to finish cutting your hair later?

73
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,469
No, come on;
let's finish this.

74
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,389
Got one of those headaches...

75
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,589
Can you—can you give me
something for it?

76
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:30,669
[Gerty]: Message received
from your wife, Sam...

77
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:32,469
via Jupiter link.

78
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:35,669
Fuck!

79
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,589
Hi, Sam!
It's me.

80
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:48,989
I got your last message.

81
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:51,669
It was really good
to hear your voice.

82
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:53,589
I miss you, too!

83
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:56,668
I know you're really lonely up there...

84
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:00,268
But I think...
In a lot of ways....

85
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:02,868
it's been really good for you.

86
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:04,788
For both of us.

87
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:08,388
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.

88
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:13,068
I'm proud of you!

89
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:16,268
Someone has got something to say.

90
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,788
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?

91
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:24,388
Say "astronaut".

92
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:26,868
Astronaut.
(Sam chuckles)

93
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:28,868
He is an astronaut!

94
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:32,468
(whispering) Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.

95
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,868
Daddy's an astronaut.

96
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:37,188
Clever girl!
Wave!

97
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,388
Give daddy a wave!

98
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:42,588
Kathy, could you—

99
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,788
I can't believe you're
going to be home soon.

100
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,268
It's her birthday next month...

101
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:53,468
And I was thinking about
maybe a playhouse for the garden.

102
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:55,668
- Gerty!
- We could work at it together.

103
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:57,868
Sam...

104
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:00,868
I love you!

105
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:02,668
(softly) I love you!

106
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:05,188
- And I miss you!
- (softly) I miss you!

107
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,588
And I can't wait to see you.

108
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:10,188
OK, sweetheart...

109
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:12,668
Goodbye.

110
00:10:37,468 --> 00:10:38,388
Hi, Doug!

111
00:10:39,668 --> 00:10:41,788
You're really full of yourself,
aren't you, Doug?

112
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,068
Kath...

113
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:03,468
(tsks) Not good!

114
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:05,868
[Television]:
What about Dumbo?... (continues)

115
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:49,668
(groans) Fuck!

116
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:51,388
God damn it!

117
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:52,988
Fuck!

118
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:57,268
Wasn't kind of smart,
was it, Gerty?

119
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:00,988
- Sam, can I ask how it happened?
- I told you.

120
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:04,388
I saw something on TV and
I spilled boiling water on my hand.

121
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:07,068
You saw something on TV?

122
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:09,668
Yeah, I something on TV
that distracted me.

123
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:11,668
Is there something
wrong with that, Gerty?

124
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:14,468
Sam, you said it was the TV
that distracted you...

125
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,068
but when I came in,
the TV wasn't on.

126
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:19,388
Perhaps you were imagining things?

127
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:24,188
Yeah, you think too much, pal.

128
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:28,988
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.

129
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:10,988
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes'
"The One and Only")

130
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:22,668
Shut up!

131
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:56,188
Good morning, Gerty.

132
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:57,468
Good morning, Sam.

133
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,268
- How are you today?
- Fine!

134
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:00,788
Fine.

135
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,988
- How is the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore!

136
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,868
A little sore. It's OK.

137
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:10,388
- What's for breakfast?
- The usual.

138
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:11,388
Mmhmm.

139
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,668
- Two weeks to go, Sam.
- Two weeks to go, buddy!

140
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:21,668
Would you like some
hot sauce on your beans?

141
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:25,068
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.

142
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:29,068
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.

143
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,268
You're welcome, Sam.

144
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:34,868
08:19, Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows...

145
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,988
Matthew ... 9.8 miles.

146
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:40,068
Mark is less—

147
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,068
- 9...
- Hey, Gerty!

148
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:44,468
Rock and roll!

149
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:56,988
Mark—umm...

150
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:00,068
Mark is 11 miles on the button.

151
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:05,188
Luke is a little twitchy today.

152
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:19,268
Hey, Gerty.

153
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:22,588
Looks like we have got a
live one out on Matthew.

154
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,068
I'm going to go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, OK?

155
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:27,868
OK, Sam.

156

Searching for long-range comms.

157
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:41,068

[Computer]:
Danger. Atmosphere compromised.

159
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:22,588
Where am...

160
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:26,588
- Where am I?
- Sam, you're in the infirmary.

161
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:30,268
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?

162
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:38,668
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.

163
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,268
Do you remember me?

164
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,788
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.

165
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:48,067
That's good. That is very good.

166
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,467
It's nice to see you awake again.

167
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:54,387
I'd like to keep you under observation
here in the infirmary for a few days...

168
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,387
And run some tests.

169
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,787
How long have I been out?

170
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,987
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.

171
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:05,587
- OK, pal.
- You're still very tired.

172
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:07,587
We can talk later.

173
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:46,067
Hello?

174
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,467
(Distant conversation)
[Gerty]: The new Sam is in reworking order.

175
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:14,467
But we only have two
working harvesters now.

176
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,367
[Overmeyers]: (sarcastically)
Yeah, well,what a surprise!

177
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:20,187
[Thompson]: Gerty, we're going to have to
find a way to ramp up production.

178
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,587
[Gerty]: I know.

179
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:24,147
[Overmeyers]: This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy...

180
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:27,787
a fucking rover, a harvester and
an employee all on the same day?

181
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:30,667
These were extraordinary
circumstances, as you know.

182
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:32,987
[Thompson]:
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?

183
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:34,867
How do the repairs look on... (stopped)

184
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,667
- Sam, you're out of bed.
- Yeah.

185
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,667
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?

186
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,067
We've been having some problems
with the Lunar-Sat...

187
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:49,187
And our live feed seems to be down.

188
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,787
I was recording a video-message for Central...

189
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:54,067
Updating them on your progress.

190
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:56,067
Sam, you need to stay in bed.

191
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,787
You're not ready to walk around yet.

192
00:20:02,187 --> 00:20:04,267
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.

193
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:08,987
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?

194
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,867
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.

195
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:15,267
- Well, bring them in here.
- Certainly.

196
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,667
Excellent, Sam.

197
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:33,467
What...When can I get out of here, Gerty?

198
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:36,587
Sam, you may have suffered
from brain damage in the crash.

199
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:39,867
This would explain your slight memory
loss and logic impairment.

200
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,067
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?

201
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:47,587
Central has asked me to
slow down the harvesters...

202
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:50,587
to ensure you have time to
recuperate and get your strength back.

203
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:51,667
(sarcastically) That's terrific!

204
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:53,667
That's fantastic!

205
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,867
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.

206
00:20:56,187 --> 00:21:00,467
But it will still be a few more days before you
can resume anything like a normal work schedule.

207
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,187
Let's try another test.

208
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:04,387
I don't want to try another test!

209
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:06,787
Please, Sam.

210
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,787
Hey, Gerty?

211
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:39,267
Do you know about this?

212
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,587
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.

213
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:45,387
He must have stalled.

214
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:46,747
Well, he has obviously stalled.

215
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:47,987
Don't you think we should tell Central?

216
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,187
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.

217
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:52,587
I will pass on your message.

218
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,747
[Gerty]: Message received from Earth
via Jupiter link.

219
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,067
[Thompson]: Sam, we appreciate the offer,
but you concentrate on feeling better.

220
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:41,067
[Overmeyers]: Yeah, we don't want
you to take any unnecessary risks.

221
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,667
- You are too important to us.
- You stay put.

222
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:45,387
[Overmeyers]: That is an order.

223
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,387
[Thompson]: It's an order, Sam...
from Lunar.

224
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,347
[Overmeyers]:
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit...

225
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:52,187
to tend to the stalled harvester
and get the base back on its feet.

226
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:55,387
- (under breath) Fuck is with...? What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, Sam.

227
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:56,627
- What?
- Sam...

228
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,387
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.

229
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:04,467
I don't appreciate that—being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.

230
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:42,467
Gerty!

231
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:48,867
Gerty!

232
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:50,587
Gerty, come here!

233
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:53,867
- What happened?
- I do not know, maybe a meteorite...

234
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,067
There have been no meteorites, Sam.

235
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:57,987
Micrometeorites, maybe. I do not know.

236
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,387
Either way, there might be
damage to the exterior shell.

237
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:03,067
I think you better...you better
let me go outside and take a look.

238
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:05,267
There is no damage to the exterior shell.

239
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:07,387
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...

240
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:10,387
But, you know, this thing is
springing leaks like an Acme firehose.

241
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,787
You need to let me go outside
and fix this problem, Gery.

242
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:14,867
I can't let you go outside, Sam.

243
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,987
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside,
we can't fix this leak.

244
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:20,027
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.

245
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:22,867
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?

246
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:25,867
This thing is leaking gas. Let's go! Come on...

247
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,687
Just to check the exterior shell?

248
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,467
- Of course.
- OK, Sam.

249
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:31,587
Thank you.

250
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:46,387
Gerty!

251
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,867
[Computer]:
Searching for long-range comms.

252
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,867
Searching for long-range comms.

253
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:29,267
Searching for long-range comms.

254
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:34,387
Signal failure on long-range comms.

255
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:30,986
Gerty!

256
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:32,266
Gerty!

257
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:36,466
I found him outside!

258
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:40,266
I found him outside!

259
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,986
Near one of the stalled harvesters...

260
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:45,186
Who is he?

261
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:46,746
Who is he?!

262
00:27:46,786 --> 00:27:48,466
We need to get him to the infirmary.

263
00:27:49,986 --> 00:27:51,586
Not until you tell me who that is.

264
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:53,586
You tell me who that is!

265
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:58,066
Sam Bell. We need to get him
to the infirmary immediately.

266
00:28:10,586 --> 00:28:11,586
Hello, Sam.

267
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:12,586
How are you feeling?

268
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,786
Where—Where am I?

269
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:22,186
The infirmary.

270
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:24,666
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.

271
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:25,866
Do you remember?

272
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:29,266
No, I'm—I'm thirsty.

273
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:32,066
I could get you some water.

274
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,386
I saw someone out there, Gerty.

275
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:46,666
I saw someone out there.

276
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:51,866
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in
the crash and have incurred minor injuries.

277
00:28:52,586 --> 00:28:54,586
But, all in all,
the prognosis is good.

278
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:58,786
I'm happy to see you again.

279
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:22,866
Gerty?

280
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:24,586
Yes, Sam?

281
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,786
Is there someone in the room with us?

282
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:35,266
Sam, get some sleep.

283
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,266
You're very tired.

284
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,066
[Tess]: Spoke to Thompson today.

285
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:06,866
They are in Europe, they—he's promising the world.

286
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:15,266
I think it was the right thing.

287
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:21,466
But...it's just such a long time.

288
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:27,186
I suppose there are—there are things...

289
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,866
You know...that needed to happen.

290
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,186
I—I need time to think.

291
00:30:42,386 --> 00:30:43,586
Listen...umm...

292
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:45,586
Sam...

293
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,466
Be safe...And I'll...

294
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:51,066
I'll talk to you soon.

295
00:30:51,986 --> 00:30:53,066
Goodbye.

296
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:23,186
Gerty?

297
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,786
Gerty, what the fu—what the hell's going on?

298
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,466
Who is the guy—
Who is the guy in the rec room?

299
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:32,666
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?

300
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:34,786
Sam, you're out out of bed.

301
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:37,586
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?

302
00:31:37,986 --> 00:31:39,186
Who is the guy in the rec room?

303
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:42,266
- Sam Bell.
- Come on, come on, come on!

304
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:44,986
You are Sam Bell.

305
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:48,866
Sam, what is it?

306
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:51,186
It might help to talk about it.

307
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:53,666
I don't understand what is happening...

308
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:57,066
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.

309
00:31:57,106 --> 00:31:58,386
We can run some tests.

310
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:01,186
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.

311
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,226
They do not know that you were recovered
alive from the accident.

312
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:07,386
"Recovered alive"? What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?

313
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:08,266
What are you talking about?

314
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:10,066
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

315
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:12,586
Are you hungry?

316
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,786
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks

317
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:56,586
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks,
two weeks, two weeks, two weeks... (exhales)

318
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,466
- I'm just getting my slippers...
- I'm using them...I'm using them.

319
00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:27,586
These are mine.

320
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,066
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.

321
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:43,186
I'm Sam Bell, too!

322
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:46,786
- What?
- Well, we've got that going for us.

323
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:50,266
Why...?

324
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:57,266
How long have you been...

325
00:33:57,986 --> 00:33:59,186
What?

326
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:00,666
How long have you been here?

327
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:02,466
About a week.

328
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:05,786
- So how are you doing?
- What?

329
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:07,386
How are you doing?

330
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,986
"How am I doing?"

331
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:15,186
How do you think I'm doing?

332
00:34:24,986 --> 00:34:28,186
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?

333
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:32,786
Harvesters are fine.

334
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:37,066
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone
that's slightly troubling.

335
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:40,066
(chuckles) I'm not a clone.

336
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:42,986
I'm not a clone!

337
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,066
- You're the clone.
- Okay, Sam.

338
00:34:52,986 --> 00:34:54,386
You're not a clone.

339
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,386
Hey, hey...You're not looking too good.

340
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:10,986
Sh! Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.

341
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:15,386
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.

342
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:17,666
You're not looking too good, my friend.

343
00:35:17,706 --> 00:35:19,386
I hope you're not feeling too bad.

344
00:35:19,386 --> 00:35:20,746
Are you talking to yourself?

345
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,866
- Let's just get you fixed up...
- How long have you been here?

346
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:27,466
Well, it's about...three years.

347
00:35:27,986 --> 00:35:29,065
For almost three years.

348
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:32,065
Listen, I...

349
00:35:33,585 --> 00:35:34,665
I wanted to thank y—.

350
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:38,185
I wanted to thank you for, um...

351
00:35:39,785 --> 00:35:41,785
If it wasn't for you, I'd—I...

352
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:45,585
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.

353
00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:51,385
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?

354
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,785
I'm real lonely, you know, I...(puffs)

355
00:35:56,585 --> 00:35:59,065
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?

356
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,665
Maybe later.

357
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,665
- What are you looking at?
- You look just like me; it's incredible.

358
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,985
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?

359
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:23,985
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.

360
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:25,865
Hey, you know...(chuckles)

361
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:30,665
It's weird for me, too, you know? (stutters)

362
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:38,585
Hey?

363
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,465
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?

364
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:46,385
No.

365
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,665
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.

366
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:55,185
- What's the score?
- 2-18.

367
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:56,585
OK

368
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:00,385
- Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
- No...No, I...

369
00:37:01,465 --> 00:37:03,385
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!

370
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:07,065
OK, OK

371
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:08,785
- Yeah, "OK"

372
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:12,265
- Should we play?
- Yeah!

373
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:19,385
Fuck! God!

374
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:20,585
Shit!

375
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:21,985
19-2.

376
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,985
Yeah...

377
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:27,785
You want a...You want a stick of gum?

378
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:32,065
You know...

379
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:33,865
You should approach this in a different way.

380
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,985
- Remember when you went to flight school?
- What are you doing?

381
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:39,385
I'm fixing the net.

382
00:37:40,265 --> 00:37:42,465
It is very Zen with ping-pong,
you have to just to relax.

383
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,385
How long did it take you took to do that?

384
00:37:57,465 --> 00:37:59,185
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.

385
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:03,465
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.

386
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:05,985
And doing the people.

387
00:38:06,265 --> 00:38:08,065
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.

388
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:14,465
That's Fairfield, right?

389
00:38:15,185 --> 00:38:16,265
There's the town hall.

390
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:19,265
Fairfield, that's right...

391
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:26,985
Yeah, that's Tess...and Eve...

392
00:38:29,985 --> 00:38:31,385
You...

393
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:32,985
You know Tess?

394
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,065
Yeah, I know Tess.

395
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:45,985
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?

396
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:48,465
I had a...We had a girl...

397
00:38:51,385 --> 00:38:52,265
Eve.

398
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:56,985
Ain't she beautiful?

399
00:38:57,665 --> 00:38:58,985
She's my little monkey.

400
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:00,865
She's our little monkey.

401
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:04,065
High five!

402
00:39:09,585 --> 00:39:12,385
She might be the milkman's,
but she's beautiful.

403
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,585
[Gerty]:
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.

404
00:39:18,585 --> 00:39:19,385
Oh shit!

405
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,385
- [Overmeyer]: Greetings, Sam.
- [Thompson] How's our man?

406
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:28,385
You feeling better?

407
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:30,465
- [Overmeyer]: Have you had enough rest?
- [Thompson]: You resting up, Sam?

408
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,185
(chuckling) You better be, you bastard.

409
00:39:32,585 --> 00:39:34,665
[Overmeyer]:
Well, enjoy it while it lasts. We've got some good news.

410
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:38,665
[Thompson]: The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus,
so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.

411
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:42,865
[Overmeyer]: So what we've manage to do is
cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.

412
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:44,265
[Thompson]:
Rescue Unit Eliza.

413
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:47,665
[Overmeyer]: Eliza has been stationed on
Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.

414
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,465
[Thompson]: We expect them to reach you
in approximately 14 hours.

415
00:39:50,665 --> 00:39:52,185
[Overmeyer]:
So commence to jump for joy!

416
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,465
[Thompson]:
You're about to be back at work.

417
00:39:53,985 --> 00:39:56,065
In the meantime,
hang in there.

418
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:57,465
Rest up.

419
00:39:57,665 --> 00:39:59,385
[Overmeyer]: You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!

420
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:03,065
They're sending a rescue unit? Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?

421
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,665
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.

422
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:08,185
Well, then I'm going back.

423
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:09,785
That's it for me.

424
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:13,265
- What?
- Is that what you really think?

425
00:40:13,865 --> 00:40:15,865
Yeah. I've got a contract!

426
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:17,465
I'm going home.

427
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:21,185
- You're a fucking clone. You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home!

428
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:23,065
- Home!
- You're not going anywhere.

429
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:25,785
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.

430
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:29,185
What do you think, Tess is back home,
waiting on the sofa in lingerie?

431
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:30,465
What about the original Sam? Huh?

432
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:33,585
I am the original Sam!

433
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,065
- I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
- Hey!

434
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:37,065
Me!

435
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:38,985
Me!

436
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:42,585
Gerty, am I a clone?

437
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:46,385
Are you hungry?

438
00:40:52,065 --> 00:40:53,185
Hey, hey...

439
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,865
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.

440
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:05,265
Listen...

441
00:41:05,385 --> 00:41:06,985
- What about the other clones?
- What?

442
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:09,065
We might not be the first two
to have been woken up.

443
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:11,865
You said that that model had already
been started when you got here.

444
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:12,865
Well, who started it?

445
00:41:13,465 --> 00:41:15,185
There might be others up here right now.

446
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:19,985
Think about it. How did I get up
here so quickly after your crash?

447
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:22,865
- I don't know...
- They didn't ship me in from Central.

448
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:25,265
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.

449
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,265
I don't know what you're smoking. Why would
they do that? That's ridiculous.

450
00:41:31,065 --> 00:41:32,185
Impossible.

451
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,385
I bet there's some kind of secret room.

452
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:35,385
"Secret room"?

453
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:37,985
Yeah, a secret room. Why not?

454
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:40,065
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.

455
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,585
I've been here three years, man.

456
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:44,065
I know every inch of this base.

457
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:47,065
And I know how many dirt is between
those wall panels over there.

458
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:49,065
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?

459
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:50,985
Look, it's a company, right?

460
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:54,785
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.

461
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:57,665
What's cheaper? Spending time and
money training new personnel...

462
00:41:57,785 --> 00:42:00,265
Or you just have a couple of
spares here to do the job?

463
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,185
It's the far side of the moon!

464
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:05,785
Those cheap fucks haven't even
fixed the communication satellite yet!

465
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:10,785
- Tess would know, she would have told me...
- Hey, Gepetto, wake up!

466
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:13,385
You really think they give a shit about us?

467
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,265
They're laughing all the way to the bank!

468
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:17,065
Tess would know, she would have told me...

469
00:42:17,105 --> 00:42:17,985
Where do you get off?!

470
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:20,865
Fucking sitting there sulking
like a little fucking boy!

471
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:22,985
- Jesus Christ...
- Wake up!

472
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,585
There's some area that we don't know about.

473
00:42:29,265 --> 00:42:30,385
And I'm going to find it.

474
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:34,265
Yeah, maybe you'll find some
buried treasure, too.

475
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,585
Fuck!

476
00:43:09,465 --> 00:43:12,185
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.

477
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,185
You find your secret room?

478
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:18,385
Just put that anywhere.

479
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,265
Yes, that's a good idea...

480
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:24,385
- That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.

481
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:28,065
- What? Why?
- I want to look underneath that model.

482
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,585
You're not touching this model.

483
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:32,865
Get the fuck out of the way!

484
00:43:33,385 --> 00:43:35,185
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?

485
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:37,385
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?

486
00:43:37,585 --> 00:43:39,665
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- Oh, you're a tough guy now?

487
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:40,865
What, are you going to stab me?

488
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,665
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

489
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:47,625
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.

490
00:43:47,665 --> 00:43:49,385
- Put the knife down.
- No, I'm not going to give you the knife.

491
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:50,745
- What?
- Just get out of the way.

492
00:43:50,785 --> 00:43:52,065
- Take it easy.
- Let go of the knife.

493
00:43:52,185 --> 00:43:53,785
Don't ever tell me what to do.

494
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:57,265
- Let go.
- You let go of the knife.

495
00:43:57,785 --> 00:43:59,465
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.

496
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:01,985
- Don't push me, motherfucker!
- Let go.

497
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:03,785
Let go!

498
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:16,065
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."

499
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:25,064
You fucking little girl, man!

500
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,984
Damn it! What did I tell you?

501
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,664
You going to stop?
You going to stop?

502
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:51,184
OK!

503
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:53,584
OK!

504
00:44:54,184 --> 00:44:55,464
Jesus, fuck!

505
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:59,464
Fuck me! What the fuck?

506
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,064
I hardly...I hardly touched you.

507
00:45:02,584 --> 00:45:03,624
Let me see.

508
00:45:03,664 --> 00:45:05,584
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!

509
00:45:59,664 --> 00:46:00,864
Hello, Sam.

510
00:46:03,184 --> 00:46:04,264
Sam, is everything OK?

511
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:05,664
Yeah!

512
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:11,464
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...

513
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:16,184
He's very angry, you know?

514
00:46:16,784 --> 00:46:18,184
You know what he did?

515
00:46:18,664 --> 00:46:20,464
He flipped my entire model over!

516
00:46:20,984 --> 00:46:22,384
You know how much work I put into that thing?

517
00:46:22,664 --> 00:46:24,184
938 hours.

518
00:46:24,384 --> 00:46:26,664
938 hours. Yeah, exactly.

519
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:30,104
938 hours, really?

520
00:46:30,144 --> 00:46:32,064
Approximately.

521
00:46:33,264 --> 00:46:34,384
He's got a problem.

522
00:46:36,664 --> 00:46:37,984
He scares me, Gerty.

523
00:46:38,384 --> 00:46:40,264
What is it about Sam that scares you?

524
00:46:40,304 --> 00:46:41,984
The guy flies off the handle.

525
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:44,784
I see it now. I see what Tess was talking about.

526
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,184
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...

527
00:46:55,264 --> 00:46:58,984
She—She left me. Tess left me.

528
00:46:59,264 --> 00:47:01,784
For 6 months. She moved back in with her parents.

529
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:03,064
I know.

530
00:47:07,984 --> 00:47:09,664
She gave me a second chance.

531
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:14,184
- I promised here that I'd change.
- You have changed, Sam.

532
00:47:15,384 --> 00:47:18,184
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here,
I've sent Tess...

533
00:47:19,264 --> 00:47:21,184
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.

534
00:47:21,584 --> 00:47:23,064
Where did those messages go?

535
00:47:23,584 --> 00:47:24,864
Did they ever reach her?

536
00:47:25,264 --> 00:47:28,264
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.

537
00:47:31,264 --> 00:47:33,464
What about the messages she sent to me?

538
00:47:34,784 --> 00:47:38,264
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.

539
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:57,184
Gerty...Gerty?

540
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:04,584
Am I really a clone?

541
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:09,584
When you first arrived at Sarang,
there was a small crash.

542
00:48:09,664 --> 00:48:14,184
You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered
minor brain damage and memory loss.

543
00:48:14,264 --> 00:48:17,064
I kept you under observation
and ran some tests.

544
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:18,544
I remember, yea, I remember that...

545
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:21,624
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.

546
00:48:21,664 --> 00:48:24,664
It is standard procedure for
all new clones to be given tests...

547
00:48:24,784 --> 00:48:27,184
 to establish mental stability..

548
00:48:27,264 --> 00:48:28,864
and general physical health.

549
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:32,664
Genetic abnormalities and minor
duplication errors in the DNA...

550
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,384
can have considerable impact on...

551
00:48:34,464 --> 00:48:36,584
What about Tess? What about Eve?

552
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,784
They are memory implants, Sam.

553
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:43,384
Uploaded, edited memories
of the original Sam Bell.

554
00:49:02,384 --> 00:49:04,264
I'm very sorry. 

555
00:49:07,384 --> 00:49:10,064
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.

556
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:11,984
Can I prepare you something?

557
00:49:54,384 --> 00:49:57,264
[Computer]:
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.

558
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:05,384
- You OK, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm staring into space.

559
00:50:07,784 --> 00:50:09,784
Hey! Thanks for this, this is good.

560
00:50:10,384 --> 00:50:13,064
This is cozy. How's the nose?

561
00:50:13,984 --> 00:50:15,664
Much better, thank you.

562
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:21,464
I went haywire before.
You know...I lost it. I...

563
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:26,464
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's OK.

564
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:31,864
No, it's not OK. I fucked up Fairfield. I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got...

565
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:34,184
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.

566
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,864
Yes, you do.

567
00:50:37,864 --> 00:50:39,584
(Music player plays Katrina and the Waves'
"Walking on Sunshine")

568
00:50:39,784 --> 00:50:41,984
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.

569
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:43,984
Can you turn that off?

570
00:50:44,784 --> 00:50:46,584
Listen. (Music stops) Listen.

571
00:50:46,584 --> 00:50:48,164
(music resumes)
I wasn't supposed to...

572
00:50:51,464 --> 00:50:53,184
I'm trying to tell you something.

573
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:55,684
(music stops)

574
00:50:55,984 --> 00:50:57,784
I never instructed Gerty to...
(music resumes)

575
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:02,984
(music stops)
Listen to me. I wasn't supposed to find you...(music resumes)

576
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:04,784
(music stops)

577
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:06,684
(music resumes)

578
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:10,184
(music stops)
Tough Guy.

579
00:51:10,264 --> 00:51:14,784
- Listen to me!
- You look like a radioactive tampon.

580
00:51:14,884 --> 00:51:16,284
Like a banana with a yeast infection.

581
00:51:18,584 --> 00:51:21,384
Listen to me. I wasn't supposed to find you.

582
00:51:22,184 --> 00:51:25,864
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside
the base while you were out there.

583
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:28,584
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...

584
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:32,784
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.

585
00:51:33,584 --> 00:51:34,984
"A live conversation"?

586
00:51:35,464 --> 00:51:38,584
- Yeah
- How do you know it was a live conversation?

587
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:42,064
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.

588
00:51:43,264 --> 00:51:45,944
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.

589
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:50,464
- It was live, man, it was live.
- That's impossible. There was a flare, it fried the satellite.

590
00:51:50,584 --> 00:51:54,784
The satellite is fine. They don't want us
to be able to contact Earth. They lied to us.

591
00:51:55,384 --> 00:51:58,864
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.

592
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,664
If the satellite works, how are they
blocking the live feed from down here?

593
00:52:02,784 --> 00:52:04,664
Everything works fine.

594
00:52:05,064 --> 00:52:08,384
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?

595
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:10,464
From where, then?

596
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:33,584
[Computer]:
Searching for long-range comms. 

597
00:52:36,984 --> 00:52:39,984
[Sam]: I'm just passing the last of
the harvesters. Looks like John.

598
00:52:42,184 --> 00:52:44,464
How long until you are out of the base's range?

599
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:46,264
Um, a minute.

600
00:52:46,984 --> 00:52:50,184
- 90 seconds tops.
- Have you ever been out this far?

601
00:52:50,864 --> 00:52:53,584
No...never have.

602
00:52:56,064 --> 00:52:58,264
[Computer]:
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

603
00:52:59,184 --> 00:53:01,064
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

604
00:53:02,184 --> 00:53:04,264
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

605
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:19,783
- See anything?
- It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.

606
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,583
Wait a second, I see something.

607
00:53:25,964 --> 00:53:27,264
[Computer]:
Approaching station 3.

608
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:12,063
Holy shit! I think I see something, too.

609
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,463
[Computer]:
Approaching station 1.

610
00:54:20,183 --> 00:54:23,183
Do you see what I see? Looks like
an antenna or...or...

611
00:54:23,783 --> 00:54:25,783
A pylon or something. I think it's the jammer.

612
00:54:27,383 --> 00:54:30,463
Dude! This is why we're not getting the live feed.

613
00:54:49,383 --> 00:54:52,583
- Sam? Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

614
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,183
Yeah, yeah I hear you.

615
00:54:58,263 --> 00:55:01,463
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to—I'm going to head back to the base.

616
00:55:01,983 --> 00:55:05,583
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.

617
00:55:30,383 --> 00:55:33,983
Fuck...Fuck...Fuck.

(chuckles) My hair's falling out.

624
00:58:05,263 --> 00:58:06,783
(hacking cough)
How about that for a status?

625
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:09,183
We'll do this another time.

626
00:58:30,983 --> 00:58:31,983
Fuck!

627
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:38,983
I'm going to go see her soon.

Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.

630
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:46,583
The cryogenic protection pod is designed
to put you into a deep sleep for...

631
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:50,263
The duration of your three-day return
journey back to Earth.

632
00:59:50,383 --> 00:59:55,063
As you begin to feel sleepy,
think about the magnificent job that you've done.

633
00:59:55,103 --> 00:59:58,463
And how proud your family are
of what you've accomplished.

634
00:59:58,783 --> 01:00:03,583
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider
of clean energy worldwide...

635
01:00:03,663 --> 01:00:06,663
Due to the hard work of people like you.

636
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:10,183
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.

Approaching station 2.

638
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,783
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.

639
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:03,183
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.

640
01:02:04,782 --> 01:02:06,182
Bud, what's wrong with you?

641
01:02:06,662 --> 01:02:07,982
What's going on?

642
01:02:09,182 --> 01:02:10,862
I found your secret room.

643
01:02:30,582 --> 01:02:33,462
- Who goes first?
- I go first.

644
01:03:27,582 --> 01:03:29,862
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.

645
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,782
Why are there so many of them?

646
01:04:15,782 --> 01:04:17,862
Sam, can I help you with something?

647
01:04:18,782 --> 01:04:21,382
Not now, Gerty. I'm OK.

648
01:04:24,582 --> 01:04:28,782
Gerty, why did you help me before?

649
01:04:29,262 --> 01:04:33,182
With the password? Doesn't that go
against your programming or something?

650
01:04:33,382 --> 01:04:35,062
Helping you is what I do.

- Is this the Bell family?
- This is the Bell residence.

658
01:05:34,582 --> 01:05:36,782
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.

659
01:05:37,062 --> 01:05:39,182
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

660
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:42,782
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.

661
01:06:00,382 --> 01:06:03,382
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.

662
01:06:03,662 --> 01:06:06,462
I'm her daughter. Can I help you?

663
01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:11,062
Eve?

664
01:06:11,582 --> 01:06:14,182
- Yeah.

- Sweetheart...

667
01:06:23,982 --> 01:06:25,862
How did mommy die, sweetheart?

668
01:06:27,862 --> 01:06:29,582
How did mommy die?

669
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:32,662
- Dad!
- Yeah.

670
01:06:32,982 --> 01:06:36,182
- There's someone asking about mom.
- Who's asking about mom?

671
01:06:47,482 --> 01:06:49,882
That's enough.
That's enough.

672
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:56,582
I want to go home!

673
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:04,262

01:07:42,582 --> 01:07:44,382
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.

677
01:07:46,782 --> 01:07:47,982
What are you laughing at?

678
01:07:48,462 --> 01:07:52,982
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying
to stab somebody, for God's sakes.

679
01:07:52,982 --> 01:07:53,982
Here, give me that.

680
01:07:59,382 --> 01:08:02,662
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.

681
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:03,662
Why are you shaking?

682
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:06,262

01:08:23,982 --> 01:08:26,862
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?

685
01:08:27,262 --> 01:08:28,062
You all right?

686
01:08:29,782 --> 01:08:31,982
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...

687
01:08:32,982 --> 01:08:37,182
If they find us awake at the same time,
they aren't going to let us live.

688
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,462
You know that, right?

689
01:08:43,982 --> 01:08:46,182
You know, the return vehicle is a...

690
01:08:51,582 --> 01:08:52,982
You OK?

691
01:08:56,182 --> 01:08:59,462
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.

692
01:08:59,582 --> 01:09:02,262
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.

693
01:09:10,782 --> 01:09:13,582
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.

694
01:09:24,382 --> 01:09:25,662
I'm freezing.

695
01:09:37,362 --> 01:09:40,662
Hey, hey?
Hey?

696
01:09:47,462 --> 01:09:49,262
I'm really scared.

697
01:09:55,562 --> 01:09:56,862
Where are you going?

698
01:10:48,582 --> 01:10:49,862
[Eve, video playback]:
Hello?

699
01:10:51,782 --> 01:10:54,182
- [Sam]: Is this the Bell residence?
- [Eve]: This is the Bell residence.

700
01:10:54,781 --> 01:10:57,061
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.

701
01:10:58,381 --> 01:10:59,981
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

702
01:11:00,181 --> 01:11:02,781
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.

703
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:08,061
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.

704
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:09,981
Can I help you?

705
01:12:04,781 --> 01:12:06,861
Gerty, I need to talk to you.

706
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:08,861
Of course, Sam, how can I help?

707
01:12:08,981 --> 01:12:10,861
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.

708
01:12:11,981 --> 01:12:13,981
That hidden room, Gerty.

709
01:12:14,381 --> 01:12:17,861
The lower deck is out-of-bounds
to awakened clones, Sam.

710
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:20,941
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.

711
01:12:20,981 --> 01:12:24,861
New clones can only be awakened once a
three-year contract is completed.

712
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:28,261
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone,
me and the other Sam will die.

713
01:12:28,381 --> 01:12:30,581
We will be killed, do you understand?

714
01:12:30,981 --> 01:12:33,461
- Yes
- You want me and the other Sam to be killed?

715
01:12:33,581 --> 01:12:36,981
- That is the last thing I want.
- Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.

716
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:38,781
OK, pal?

717
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:54,581
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.

718
01:12:55,381 --> 01:12:58,381
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes'
"The One and Only")

719
01:13:52,581 --> 01:13:54,381
What's going on? You OK?

720
01:13:56,261 --> 01:13:57,781
Don't—Don't touch him.

721
01:14:00,381 --> 01:14:01,461
Come here.

722
01:14:03,581 --> 01:14:07,181
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.

723
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,581
Why? What's going on?

724
01:14:09,781 --> 01:14:11,381
Come on outside.

725
01:14:15,981 --> 01:14:20,261
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going
to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.

726
01:14:21,381 --> 01:14:22,781
That guy?

727
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:25,981
(chuckles) What, are you going to kill him?

728
01:14:26,581 --> 01:14:28,781
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?

729
01:14:28,861 --> 01:14:30,581
Zip up your fly.

730
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:35,261
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.

731
01:14:37,261 --> 01:14:40,581
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.

732
01:14:50,461 --> 01:14:53,781
If I go through with this, I'm going to need
your help hauling him out to the crash site.

733
01:14:54,581 --> 01:14:55,861
What about us?

734
01:14:56,381 --> 01:14:59,181
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...

735
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:01,741
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.

736
01:15:02,061 --> 01:15:04,061
You're going back to Earth before they get here.

737
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:09,461
In that helium-3 launcher. I did the math; you're going to
pull some G's. But you'll be fine. You'll be all right.

738
01:15:10,781 --> 01:15:12,781
You're going home.

739
01:15:13,381 --> 01:15:15,181
You did your three years.

740
01:15:16,381 --> 01:15:18,461
They can't expect you to stick around.

741
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:21,661
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

742
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:23,781
I saw that V.P.

743
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:27,181
She's beautiful. She's gorgeous.

744
01:15:27,581 --> 01:15:28,981
You did good.

745
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:30,861
High five!

746
01:15:39,981 --> 01:15:41,661
Go for it.

747
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:53,981
- Are you comfy?
- No.

748
01:15:54,261 --> 01:15:55,781
- What?
- No!

749
01:16:01,861 --> 01:16:06,181
- What if I have to take a shit?
- (laughs) Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.

750
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:08,381
For three days?

751
01:16:09,861 --> 01:16:11,461
That's the way it goes.

752
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:14,661
- Need a hand?
- No.

753
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:18,741
OK. All right.

754
01:16:18,781 --> 01:16:21,181
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.

755
01:16:59,461 --> 01:17:02,181
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.

756
01:17:30,781 --> 01:17:32,981
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...

757
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:35,661
The other one's going to be conscious.

758
01:17:38,461 --> 01:17:39,981
What's going on with you?

759
01:17:41,381 --> 01:17:43,261
I changed my mind. I'm not going back.

760
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,181
I don't think I can move my legs.

761
01:17:48,781 --> 01:17:50,181
Besides, look at me!

762
01:17:50,581 --> 01:17:51,981
If I meet Eve now...

763
01:17:53,181 --> 01:17:55,181
I'd scare the crap out of her!

764
01:17:57,061 --> 01:18:00,981
What are you talking about, man? She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.

765
01:18:03,581 --> 01:18:06,661
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.

766
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:09,581
You can't. I know you can't,
because I can't.

767
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,261
You go.

768
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:17,381
You're a good guy, Sam.

769
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:21,581
And it was a good plan. You know, you
just picked the wrong guy to go back.

770
01:18:31,781 --> 01:18:33,981
Are you sure about this?

771
01:18:37,181 --> 01:18:40,461
Yeah. You should—You should travel, you know?

772
01:18:41,661 --> 01:18:43,381
I always wanted to do that.

773
01:18:45,061 --> 01:18:46,381
Amsterdam or...

774
01:18:46,981 --> 01:18:51,461
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii
or maybe...Mexico.

775
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,461
Aloha!

776
01:18:54,661 --> 01:18:57,461
Bring me back a piña colada. All right, pal?

777
01:19:42,981 --> 01:19:44,381
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?

778
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,380
Do you remember when Tess
came in for that interview?

779
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,580
She was so beautiful.

780
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:56,380
She wasn't the best candidate,
but it didn't matter...

781
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,380
I had to give her the job.

782
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,180
I wanted to keep her in the country.

783
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,660
(said together)
She was going back to Ireland.

784
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,260
And you knew you had to take a chance.

785
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:14,460
So...you called her...

786
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:17,580
You were terrified with that whole
speech for the answering machine...

787
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,380
but you didn't need it,
because she picked up the phone.

788
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,780
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"

789
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,180
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"

790
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:31,780
I asked her if she wanted to get an
ice cream cone or something dorky like that.

791
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,860
She said, "Let's get a drink."

792
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,260
I said, "OK." We...

793
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:24,060
Sam, this is not going to work.

794
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,080
Why?

795
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,980
I have recorded everything that has
taken place since your awakening.

796
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:33,980
If anyone were to check my memory cache,
it would put you in considerable danger.

797
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:42,180
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.

798
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,980
- Are you okay with that?
- I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

799
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:47,780
- I want to help you.

I set your...I set your
computer to reboot...

803
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:21,460
- the moment that I launch.
- I understand, Sam.

804
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,940
You should be OK.

805
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:26,060
I hope life on Earth is everything
you remember it to be.

806
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,460
Thanks, Gerty.

807
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,580
- Are you going to be OK?
- Of course.

808
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:37,660
The new Sam and I will be back to our
programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.

809
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:44,180
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people. Understand?

Where am I?

817
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:56,180
- You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.

818
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:59,580
- How long have I been out.
- Not long, Sam.

819
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:01,380
Do you remember what happened?

820

We've made contact.

821
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:40,380
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.

822
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:44,180
Bag him up and we'll get started on
repairs to the harvester.
