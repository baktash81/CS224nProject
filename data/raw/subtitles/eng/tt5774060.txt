00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,626
The following digital cinema
has been digitally remastered

2
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:08,960
to celebrate its 10th anniversary.

3
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,710
What?

4
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:09,293
I said I want to tell you my story.

5
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:10,918
What the hell?

6
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:13,626
What's with the way
you fucking talk?

7
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,460
Who the fuck are you?

8
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:30,626
My name is

9
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:38,085
Oh Dae-su.

10
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:40,710
Why did you hit on
someone else's girlfriend?

11
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:43,251
Hold on.
Did I hit on her?

12
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:45,960
- Mr. Oh Due-su!
- Did I hit on her?

13
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:48,751
Fuck! Okay! I got it.

14
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:51,126
Just a minute.
Okay! Okay!

15
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:52,418
Fuck.

16
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,668
Mr. Oh Dae-su
please sit down.

17
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:01,210
He is totally drunk.

18
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:05,501
I hit on her?
Hey, let me piss first.

19
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,710
I didn't hit on anyone!

20
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:11,210
- You son of a bitch!
- This guy is a real headache.

21
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,085
- Asshole!
- Mr. Oh Dae-su!

22
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,918
Sit down.

23
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:16,710
I'm very sorry.

24
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:20,710
- I gotta piss bad.
- Great.

25
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:24,043
- Cute, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Sit down.

26
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,335
Today is
my daughter's birthday.

27
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:29,751
I got her
a birthday present.

28
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:33,626
Snatches of clouds
float in the sky.

29
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:37,418
Ah, great
A pleasure boat floats on the river.

30
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:41,293
My name Oh Dae-su means

31
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:48,710
"Just get by the day quietly."
That's why I'm Oh Dae-su.

32
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,501
But shit,

33
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:58,835
why can't I get by this day quietly?
Let me go! Huh!

34
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:02,376
- Shut the hell up!
- Let me go!

35
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:22,460
Let go of me!

36
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,835
That guy really needs
some prison time.

37
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:29,085
- Get away from me!
- Hey, get him!

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,251
I'll make sure he doesn't get drunk
and cause trouble again.

39
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,293
Have a nice day
Officer.

40
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:44,251
He's usually a nice guy, but...
Let's go.

41
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:46,626
I'll come visit you soon.

42
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,335
No need.
Don't come back.

43
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,043
That's up to me
you assholes.

44
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:53,876
Hey!

45
00:03:56,168 --> 00:04:03,293
My sweet pea, it's daddy.
Daddy got you a present.

46
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,668
I'll be home soon with your gift
so wait a bit longer.

47
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:07,751
Let me talk to her.

48
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:11,251
- Good girl, good.
- Give me the phone.

49
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,918
Sweet pea, Joo-hwan
wants to talk to you.

50
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:17,085
You know Joo-hwan, right?
Hold on.

51
00:04:18,835 --> 00:04:24,585
Hi, sweetie.
It's me, Joo-hwan.

52
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:29,376
So today's your birthday?
Happy birthday.

53
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:32,043
I'll treat you
to something nice tomorrow.

54
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,751
Hello?
Oh, Ja-hyun, I'm sorry.

55
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,626
I know it's very late.
Dae-su is on his way now.

56
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:43,793
I'm sorry.
Yes? Hold on.

57
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,460
Dae-su, it's your wife.

58
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,210
Dae-su!

59
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,335
Dae-su!

60
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,085
Oh Dae-su!

61
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:04,960
Dae-su!

62
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,043
I really had enough!
Stop fooling around and let's go already.

63
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,293
Dae-su!

64
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:20,626
Sir, sir.

65
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:23,835
Wait, come here.
Come talk to me.

66
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:27,710
I won't ask you to let me go.

67
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:34,710
Just tell me why I'm here, okay?
I should know the reason at least.

68
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:40,335
Shit, I've been locked up here
for two months already.

69
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,710
Sir, wait, come here.
What is this place?

70
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:49,335
Sir, just tell me how long
I have to stay in here.

71
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:50,543
Just tell me that, huh?
Sir!

72
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,043
Fuck you!

73
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,960
Come here, you asshole!

74
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,876
Son of a bitch.

75
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:03,293
I saw your face, asshole.
You're dead when I get out.

76
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,751
Come here, asshole.

77
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:06,710
I'm sorry. I won't curse.

78
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:11,835
Just tell me.
One month, two, or three?

79
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,960
Hey, where are you going?

80
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:18,376
Just tell me how long
you son of a bitch!

81
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:22,918
I said tell me how long
you asshole!

82
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,626
You son of a bitch!
Fucking assholes!

83
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,876
<i>If they had told me
it was going to be 15 years,</i>

84
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:39,418
<i>could it have been easier to endure?</i>

85
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,543
<i>Or could it have not?</i>

86
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:48,418
<i>“Laugh, and the world laughs with you.
Weep, and you weep alone.“</i>

87
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,960
<i>When the melody plays gas comes out.</i>

88
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:10,543
<i>When the gas comes I fall asleep.</i>

89
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:20,335
<i>I found out later
that it's the same Valium gas</i>

90
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:24,085
<i>Russian soldiers
used on the Chechen terrorists.</i>

91
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:34,626
<i>When I wake up
my hair has been cut.</i>

92
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,168
<i>I don't like the style really.</i>

93
00:08:38,043 --> 00:08:43,751
<i>But they change my clothes
and clean the place up.</i>

94
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,335
<i>Kind bastards.</i>

95
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,960
<i>One, two,</i>

96
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:56,710
<i>three.</i>

97
00:08:58,626 --> 00:08:59,960
It's too spicy...

98
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:02,543
I don't want spinach.
You eat it.

99
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,335
I won't eat spinach.

100
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:11,543
<i>Kim Ja-hyun's body was found
deeply stabbed in the neck.</i>

101
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,710
<i>The brutality of the murder
with no valuables missing</i>

102
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:19,668
<i>led the police to suspect that
the motive was a personal grudge.</i>

103
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:24,585
<i>Her husband who disappeared a year ago
is now on the wanted list.</i>

104
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:29,460
<i>According to neighbors
the missing husband, Oh Dae-su,</i>

105
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:33,751
<i>drank often, causing trouble
with his wife and the neighbors.</i>

106
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,043
<i>Blood found at the scene
matched Oh Dae-su's.</i>

107
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,835
<i>Fresh fingerprints were found
from a cup at the crime scene,</i>

108
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:49,501
<i>proving that Oh Dae-su recently visited,
according to the police.</i>

109
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:55,543
<i>A missing family album, the only
stolen item also backs their theories.</i>

110
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,626
<i>After three years</i>

111
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:33,751
<i>many wrinkles have formed on his face.</i>

112
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:40,085
<i>- That is around $61.000
- For a Sushi knife .</i>

<i>“Right always prevails“</i>

114

<i>and meet a man whose face
is hidden under a purple umbrella.</i>

116
00:10:55,918 --> 00:11:01,126
<i>I'd suggest that you get close to the TV.
- "A listening device?"</i>

117
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:04,501
<i>The television is both
a clock and a calendar.</i>

118
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:08,668
<i>It's your school, home, church,</i>

119
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,126
<i>friend</i>

120
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,460
<i>and lover.</i>

121
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:14,793
<i>But...</i>

122
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,501
<i>Countless nights may puss</i>

123
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:22,876
<i>But my heart is turned to you</i>

124
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:28,085
<i>Though I may shed my sad tears</i>

125
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:32,335
<i>It's still your face that I miss</i>

126
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:37,960
<i>But...</i>

127
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,710
<i>my lover's song</i>

128
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,168
<i>is too short.</i>

129
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:55,626
<i>This morning around 7:50
the Sungsoo Bridge</i>

130
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:58,710
<i>in Seoul suddenly
collapsed in the middle.</i>

131
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:04,751
<i>I wrote about all the people
I fought, tormented, and hurt.</i>

132
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:11,710
<i>This was both my prison journal</i>

133
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:14,626
<i>and an autobiography of my evil deeds.</i>

134
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:19,710
<i>I thought I had lived an average life</i>

135
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:24,960
<i>but I've sinned so much.</i>

136
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,835
<i>All I could think about
at that moment was</i>

137
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:41,460
<i>the poor guy next door is eating
with only one chopstick.</i>

138
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,501
<i>But...</i>

139
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:47,960
<i>But...</i>

140
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,835
<i>Who locked me up here?</i>

141
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,335
<i>Yoo Heung-sam?</i>

142
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:03,960
<i>Lee So-young or Kang Chang-suk?</i>

143
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,501

144
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:10,085

<i>no one will be able to find
any trace of your body on this earth.</i>

147
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,210

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:07,293
<i>I'll be out after a month.
I'll be out of here.</i>

175
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,085
<i>One month, in just one month
I'll be out.</i>

176
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:14,918
<i>I'll need money when I get out.
What should I do?</i>

177
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:18,043
<i>Should I steal or rob?</i>

178
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,001
<i>What shall I eat first?
Kimchi stew, grilled eels?</i>

179
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:24,835
<i>Anything as long as
it's not fried dumplings.</i>

180
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,751
<i>Where is this place anyway?</i>

181
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:29,793
<i>I hear noisy traffic
so this must be a city.</i>

182
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,376
<i>But the important thing is
just what floor this is.</i>

183
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:37,335
<i>What if I break through the wall
and it's the 52nd floor?</i>

184
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:41,210
<i>Even if I fall to my death
I'm still getting out.</i>

185
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,710
<i>I'm getting out.</i>

186
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:46,126
<i>In one month, I'm getting oui.</i>

187
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:19,085
Right now
you're lying on a field.

188
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:23,085
When you hear the bell

189
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:29,543
you will turn your head and look down.

190
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:37,501
You will see
an endless field of green grass.

191
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:45,001
The sun is shining bright
and there's a gentle breeze.

192
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:43,668
<i>It's a human being.</i>

193
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,835
Don't stop me!

194
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,835
Mister,

195
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:39,251
even though I'm no better than a beast,

196
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,835
don't I have the right to live, no?

197
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:51,960
Mister,

198
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:59,793
even though I'm no better than a beast,

199
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:11,918
don't I have the right to live, no?

200
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,751
<i>That phone booth alley was right here.</i>

201
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:42,376
<i>Now there's an apartment building.</i>

202
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:46,876
<i>Still, dumping me on the roof...
He's not the most flexible type.</i>

203
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:51,001
I want to tell you my story.

204
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,210
Die a little later.

205
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,751
What?

206
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,626
I see.

207
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:16,418
Now, I'll tell you my story.

208
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:24,085
You see, the reason
why I want to die...

209
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:28,876
Mister!

210
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,543
<i>It's a woman human being.</i>

211
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:56,418
That crazy guy took my sunglasses.

212
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:08,751
<i>Laugh, and the world laughs with you.</i>

213
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:13,335
<i>Weep, and you weep alone.</i>

214
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:19,960
<i>My home is gone.</i>

215
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:23,335
<i>I can't call my friends or relatives,</i>

216
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,210
<i>because I'm someone
who's murdered his wife.</i>

217
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:32,876
<i>Because I'm a fugitive.</i>

218
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,418
I swear, man.

219
00:22:38,376 --> 00:22:40,501
Nah, he'll kick your ass.

220
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,918
Come on, trust me, man.

221
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,251
You fucktard!

222
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:12,710
<i>Fucktard.</i>

223
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:19,751
<i>Never heard that one before.
TV doesn't teach you curse words.</i>

224
00:23:28,043 --> 00:23:33,835
<i>10 years of imaginary training.
Is it any use in real life?</i>

225
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,085
<i>It is.</i>

226
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:53,960
<i>Striped beakfish. Oplegnathus fasciatus.</i>

227
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:57,376
<i>Lives in the warm waters
of coastal reefs.</i>

228
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,710
<i>Despite its weak reflexes</i>

229
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:03,751
<i>it's known to resist
tenaciously when caught.</i>

230
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:06,460
<i>In South Kyoung-sang Province
its offspring...</i>

231
00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:09,460
<i>What's this smell?</i>

232
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:25,668
Don't even think about
asking me any questions.

233
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:27,835
I don't know a thing.

234
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:46,876
Pardon?

235
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:53,335
I said I want to eat something alive.

236
00:24:56,876 --> 00:25:00,293
Oh, right.

237
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,710
Long time no see.

238
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,751
<i>This is my first time.</i>

239
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:05,835
Maybe not?

240
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:07,751
<i>But she looks familiar.</i>

241
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:14,543
You look very familiar.
Where have we met?

242
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,585
"The Search for the Best Chefs"
Channel 11 Thursdays of 6:30.

243
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,335
The youngest female
Japanese cuisine chef in Korea.

244
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:24,960
Oh that?

245
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:28,751
They said the ratings are low
but I guess not.

246
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:32,460
Women's hands are warm
so they can't make sushi.

247
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:35,501
You sure do know a lot.

248
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,460
Who are you?

249
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:57,210
<i>Do you like your clothes?</i>

250
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:04,335
Why...

251
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:10,335
- Why did you lock me up?
- Who do you think I am?

252
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:14,668
- Loo Heung-sam!
- Wrong.

253
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:18,501
- Did Lee So-young hire you?
- No, wrong again.

254
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:19,960
Lee Jung-vow?

255
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:24,043
Kong Chang-sum, Hwang Joo-yeon?

256
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,043
Kim Na-sung? Park Jin-woo?

257
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,126
Im Duk-yoon? Lee Jae-pyung?
Kuk Su-ran? Who is it?

258
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:30,668
Who the hell are you?

259
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,418
Me?

260
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:37,210
I'm sort of a scholar
and my major is you.

261
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:43,168
An Oh-Due-su-ologist.
An expert on Oh Dae-su.

262
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,543
Who I am isn't important.
The important thing is why.

263
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,751
Think it over.
Review your whole life.

264
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:55,001
School is over, so now
it's time for homework. Right?

265
00:26:56,835 --> 00:26:58,460
Keep this in mind...

266
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:04,793
Be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same.

267
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,751
Let me ask you one thing.

268
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:12,210
You hypnotized me in there
didn't you?

269
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:15,793
What was the hypnotic suggestion?

270
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,793
I miss you.
Hurry and come to me.

271
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:33,460
Here you are.

272
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:42,043
It's alive, right?
May I slice it now?

273
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:22,501
I must be different from other women.
My hands are very cold.

274
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:25,376
<i>What's with her?</i>

275
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:31,335
Sir.

276
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:36,710
Hold on.
Hey mister, wake up...

277
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:38,251
<i>Keep this in mind.</i>

278
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:47,668
<i>Be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same.</i>

279
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,376
You're awake?

280
00:29:05,835 --> 00:29:08,043
Is this true?

281
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:31,210
That fever medicine
really works.

282
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,043
You fainted so easy for
someone who exercised so much.

283
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:44,793
Lack of sunlight over a long time leads
to deficiencies in vitamins A and E.

284
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:49,876
Hence my lack of immunity
against the influenza.

285
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:53,668
Do you usually talk that way?

286
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,085
The bathroom door is broken
and doesn't lock.

287
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:13,293
Don't get any ideas.
I could slice you like sashimi.

288
00:30:15,043 --> 00:30:16,210
What's this?

289
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,626
Suppositories.

290
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:22,543
How else could I feed medicine
to someone who's fainted?

291
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:41,043
<i>15 years of imaginary training.
Is it any use in real life?</i>

292
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:50,210
<i>It isn't.</i>

293
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:08,793
I deserve to die for that.

294
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:19,335
I bring you here only to deny you.
I get why you're angry.

295
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,710
I admit it.

296
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:31,085
I brought you here
because I like you too, but...

297
00:31:34,043 --> 00:31:38,918
You don't even know my name.
I'm Mi-do.

298
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:47,668
You know...
Later, when I feel I'm ready...

299
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:51,710
Then we do it.
Scouts honor.

300
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:57,210
That song, "The Face I Miss"
in your journal. That's the sign.

301
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:01,960
When I sing it
get yourself ready right away.

302
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:11,626
When it actually comes to
the critical moment, I may resist.

303
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:14,210
But show no mercy.

304
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:17,251
Just give it to me!

305
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:23,960
<i>Give it to you?</i>

306
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:31,835
The ants...

307
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:37,335
Do they still come out?
Do you still feel them?

308
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:43,210
When it comes to loneliness
it's always the ants.

309
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:46,210
The really lonely people I met

310
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:49,835
they all hallucinated ants
even if just for a second.

311
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,335
Come to think about it...

312
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:55,793
You know how ants always
move in groups.

313
00:32:56,376 --> 00:33:01,501
So I suppose the real lonely people
keep imagining ants.

314
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:05,085
Of course, I never did myself.

315
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,876
She called from overseas
five or six years ago.

316
00:34:10,043 --> 00:34:11,793
Asked if her dad showed up.

317
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:16,585
She didn't even know that
he killed her mother.

318
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:21,543
She must have called us since
she only has few relatives.

319
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:24,918
She had lost a lot of her Korean.

320
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,876
Her foster parents are
both doctors or something.

321
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,376
Anyhow, Miss Reporter,

322
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:41,918
Dae-su is really
not caught yet?

323
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,835
Your daughter's address is on the front.

324
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:52,126
On the back is a map
to your wife's grave.

325
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:56,876
<i>Eva...</i>

326
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:00,918
<i>Stockholm... Eva...</i>

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,918
Do you want to call her?

328
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:12,460
Want me to call her?

329
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:20,501
Want to go to
the grave together?

330
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,418
<i>No, after I kill that bastard first.</i>

331
00:35:57,835 --> 00:35:59,751

00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,335

<i>“Blue Dragon“</i>

335
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:12,751
So?

336
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:16,668
Was that the same taste?

337
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:32,418
<i>Be it 10 or 100 restaurants
it doesn't matter.</i>

338
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:38,210
<i>I can't ever forget the taste
I had for 15 years.</i>

<i>“Blue Dragon“</i>

340
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:11,876

Your favorite movie or song?

00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:18,418
I was talking to him...

Mr. Oh Dae-su?"</i>

346
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:50,293
Who are you?

347
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:56,418
"Who are you..."

348
00:37:57,085 --> 00:37:59,543
<i>“A lonely prince locked up
in a high tower.“</i>

349
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,793
Who is he?

350
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,001
I don't know.
Just someone I chat with sometimes.

351
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:11,793
And talk about sushi.

352
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:23,501
Where are you going?

353
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:32,793
Where are you going?

354
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,876
I can't trust you.

355
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,085
<i>"Purple..."</i>

356
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:55,085
<i>Purple Blue Dragon</i>

357
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:59,126
<i>A dragon that's purple and blue.
What does that mean?</i>

358
00:39:10,793 --> 00:39:13,918
<i>Why order from so far away?</i>

359
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:18,251
<i>We passed five Chinese places
just on the way here.</i>

360
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,793
<i>Feels like my lungs will explode.</i>

361
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:34,918
Tell your chef to go easy on the
scallions in the fried dumplings.

362
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:36,793
Sure.

363
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,001
- Set it down and go.
- Okay.

364
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:31,418
We can't do it by ourselves if it's
someone protected by bodyguards.

365
00:40:31,585 --> 00:40:34,376
There are people
who specialize in that.

366
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:36,335
You'll have to hire them too.

367
00:40:36,876 --> 00:40:39,960
We do it by ourselves
only if they are small fries.

368
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:45,126
But if it's over six months
we'll bring them in for free.

369
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:47,668
Yes, that's right.

370
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,126
Why did you imprison me, you

371
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:00,293
fucktard.

372
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:09,293
In our 7.5 floor business
we guard client info with our lives.

373
00:41:26,876 --> 00:41:30,418
I'm going to pay you back
for all 15 years of my life.

374
00:41:30,793 --> 00:41:34,835
With each one pulled out
you age by one year.

375
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:51,210
Stay still.

376
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:00,668
Ready to talk?

377
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:24,460
I don't know...

378
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:27,335
I didn't see his face...

379
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,293
I recorded the call...

380
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,251
<i>"Oh Dae-su"</i>

381
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:54,293
All AB blood types raise your hands.

382
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,751
Hurry, he lost a lot of blood.

383
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:12,126
Damn, look at him.
Is he dead?

384
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:25,751
You little piece of shit...

385
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:37,001
You piece of shit!

386
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:41,335
- Go, motherfucker!
- Get the fuck out!

387
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:56,876
Fuckface!

388
00:44:58,251 --> 00:44:59,835
You fucked up son of a bitch!

389
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:17,585
Just kill him
damn asshole.

390
00:45:26,543 --> 00:45:27,960
Fucking asshole!

391
00:46:40,126 --> 00:46:44,751
<i>Yet another day
I couldn't get by quietly.</i>

392
00:46:46,668 --> 00:46:50,960
<i>I've now become a monster.</i>

393
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:57,960
<i>When my vengeance is over
could I return to being the old Dae-su?</i>

394
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:07,876
Mister, are you alright?
Look at all this blood.

395
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:11,918
Mister, what happened to you?

396
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,418
Saewoon Apartments
in Eung-am, building 8.

397
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:21,085
Please take care of him.

398
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:25,376
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

399
00:47:26,126 --> 00:47:28,168
Well, then...

400
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:31,168
Farewell, Oh Dae-su.

401
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:38,543
<i>Farewell, Oh Dae-su.</i>

402
00:47:40,376 --> 00:47:44,793
<i>Farewell...</i>

403
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,585
<i>A bastard you hate
but wouldn't want to kill.</i>

404
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:46,585
<i>A bitch you detest
but want more than to kill.</i>

405
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:48,626
<i>We'll take care of them.</i>

406
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:53,210
<i>Don't they go mad
being locked up for so long?</i>

407
00:48:53,376 --> 00:48:58,335
<i>If you prefer that he doesn't
we can administer some medication.</i>

408
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:00,918
<i>There's this one called
“Risperdal Solution“.</i>

409
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:05,793
<i>It's known to be a reliable
treatment for schizophrenia.</i>

410
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,835
<i>The duration is always the issue.</i>

411
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:13,460
<i>- How long are you thinking of...?
- 15 years.</i>

412
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:18,918
<i>- Too long?
- What did he do wrong?</i>

413
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:21,543
<i>Oh Dae-su, you see,</i>

414
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,585
<i>talks too much.</i>

415
00:49:26,835 --> 00:49:28,293
Go to sleep.

416
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:33,251
It's about time you visited Joo-hwan's
Internet cafe tomorrow.

417
00:49:42,668 --> 00:49:44,960
Sit wherever you'd like.

418
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:48,085
Joo-hwan.

419
00:49:59,835 --> 00:50:01,626
<i>Oh Dae-su, you see,</i>

420
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,168
<i>talks too much.</i>

421
00:50:08,376 --> 00:50:11,126
Have you heard
this voice before?

422
00:50:11,626 --> 00:50:14,918
Do you know anyone who would
hate me this much?

423
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:27,585
I don't know all the 260 names
of your women's husbands.

424
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:38,918
<i>"Mi-do (Princess Sashimi)"</i>

425
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:45,085
- Who's Mi-do?
- This girl who cries over nothing.

426
00:50:49,543 --> 00:50:50,543
Joo-hwan.

427
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:57,835
Did I really talk that much?

428
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:07,418
Doe-su, the way I see it
you should look for the perpetrator

429
00:51:07,585 --> 00:51:11,043
among those who used to be
in your close proximity.

430
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:15,626
<i>"Search for friends: Evergreen"</i>

431
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:21,085

But please remember.
Open quote.

435
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:39,793
Like a gazelle from
the hand of the hunter

436
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,626
Like a bird from
the snare of the fowler

437
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,293
Free yourself.

438
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:51,960
- Close quote.
- Who are you?

439
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:54,876
Who are you, you rotten bastard?

440
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,251
<i>I had decided while I was locked up,</i>

441
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:00,960
<i>that I wouldn't trust
anyone if I get out.</i>

442
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:03,668
<i>That if I find anyone to be suspicious</i>

443
00:52:03,835 --> 00:52:07,335
<i>I would create a secret which
only that person and I will know.</i>

444
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:12,001
The messenger ID, 'Monster'
is a trap that I made to catch you.

445
00:52:12,168 --> 00:52:15,793
You bring a complete stronger home.
Who are you?

446
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:27,085
Who is Evergreen?

447
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:38,668
I tracked down that ID, Evergreen,
and found out the personal details.

448
00:52:38,835 --> 00:52:40,918
- Ready to jot it down?
- Go ahead

449
00:52:41,376 --> 00:52:45,001
<i>The name is Su Dee-ah.
Ever heard that surname, 'Su'?</i>

450
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:47,960
- Address?
- It's in Eung-am.

451
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:49,960
Saewoon Apartments
Building 7, unit 407.

452
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:59,668
<i>I'm not doing fine
in this life in a bigger prison.</i>

453
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,668
"Evergreen."

454
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:22,918
"Who are you?"

455
00:53:27,376 --> 00:53:29,501
You were going to
say that, right?

456
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,876
No, you must find out on your own.
Come on, it's a game.

457
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:39,960
First, who?
Then, why?

458
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:42,418
Once you solve the questions
come see me anytime.

459
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:47,335
I'll mark the answers for you.
You have until July 5th.

460
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:51,210
Only five days left.

461
00:53:53,876 --> 00:53:55,251
Too short?

462
00:53:56,043 --> 00:54:00,918
Do your best. If you pass
I'll kill myself instead of Mi-do.

463
00:54:03,126 --> 00:54:05,460
That's right, Mi-do.

464
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:11,335
I'm going to kill every woman
you love until you die.

465
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:17,210
You're notorious for not being
able to protect your women.

466
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:27,335
Wow, you're strong,
Mr. Monster.

467
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,960
You truly are the monster
of my creation.

468
00:54:32,876 --> 00:54:37,126
But this way, you won't
ever find out the "why?"

469
00:54:37,835 --> 00:54:40,376
The question that bugged you
for the last 15 years.

470
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:43,918
You don't care anymore?

471
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:53,460
Take that seat.

472
00:55:00,751 --> 00:55:03,293
Ah, the dental torture.

473
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:07,501
You won't get enough time
to torture me.

474
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:11,418
I have a weak heart
so I have this motor inside.

475
00:55:11,585 --> 00:55:17,460
When it was put in
do you know what I said to the doctor?

476
00:55:20,335 --> 00:55:22,293
Doctor Hopkins

477
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:27,626
gave me a remote control
that can switch the motor off.

478
00:55:27,793 --> 00:55:30,835
Pardon? Why?

479
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:37,960
So I can kill myself easily
any time I want.

480
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,876
I'll give you a 100 grand more.

481
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:57,710
Oh, what a conundrum.

482
00:55:57,876 --> 00:56:00,543
You wan't to kill me right away,

483
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,710
but you won't find out
why you were locked up.

484
00:56:04,418 --> 00:56:08,543
You want to torture me but
I say I'll kill myself first.

485
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:14,335
To get your revenge
or to find out the reason.

486
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:19,335
Oh, that is the big question.

487
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,710
I've been watching you
for 15 years.

488
00:56:24,793 --> 00:56:30,710
I fared well thanks to you.
I wasn't bored or lonely.

489
00:56:33,335 --> 00:56:36,960
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for the ones who were hurt.

490
00:56:37,418 --> 00:56:38,835
Try it.

491
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:43,210
The loss of 15 years.

492
00:56:43,376 --> 00:56:48,293
The pain of losing your wife and child.
All these would go away.

493
00:56:49,168 --> 00:56:53,418
In other words
vengeance is healthy.

494
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:59,168
But what happens after
you've fulfilled your vengeance?

495
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,918
I bet that hidden pain
will probably come back again.

496
00:57:06,835 --> 00:57:08,710
"Are you there
Mr. Oh Dae-su?"

497
00:57:10,668 --> 00:57:14,293
"Mr. Oh Dae-su
long time no see."

498
00:57:23,168 --> 00:57:27,418
Hasn't she been tied up for too long?
I think you also left the door open.

499
00:57:40,835 --> 00:57:42,293
Please save me.

500
00:57:44,668 --> 00:57:46,585
<i>I need saving myself.</i>

501
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,876
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose.

502
00:57:56,251 --> 00:57:58,335
This dentist is really good.

503
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:10,710
Don't move.

504
00:58:11,793 --> 00:58:13,043
What's with you?

505
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:22,918
Now

506
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,543
here we go.

507
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:49,710
You know, they say that
cowardice comes from imagination.

508
00:58:51,376 --> 00:58:55,335
So try not to imagine.

509
00:58:55,501 --> 00:58:57,960
It'll make you fucking brave.

510
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:01,168
Now, here comes the real thing.

511
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:31,168
Yes?

512
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:37,293
Well, sir, I do thank you for
telling me about this place,

513
00:59:38,543 --> 00:59:40,835
but I haven't even started.

514
00:59:41,835 --> 00:59:42,793
What?

515
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,918
Let's go.

516
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:16,376
Let's really go.

517
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:18,293
Let's fight.

518
01:00:21,793 --> 01:00:22,751
Let's fight.

519
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:29,668
Tenacious.

520
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,210
Your hand.

521
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:37,918
I'm going to cut off your hand.
You touched Mi-do's breasts.

522
01:00:44,085 --> 01:00:46,376
Then what about my tongue?

523
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:04,918
You still don't trust me
you rotten bastard?

524
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:10,710
I don't think we'll
reach an agreement

525
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,168
I looked into it

526
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,501
and their reason for not paying
more than 270 million

527
01:01:15,668 --> 01:01:18,418
wasn't to do with
the evaluation of this building.

528
01:01:18,585 --> 01:01:21,001
It's likely that their
convertible bonds holders are...

529
01:01:24,126 --> 01:01:26,710
So I think there won't be a big issue.

530
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:33,376
Of course, there's the 25 percent stake
held by their chairman and his relatives.

531
01:01:40,751 --> 01:01:41,918
Dae-su.

532
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:44,460
Yeah.

533
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:50,960
Did he really say
that he'll kill me?

534
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:53,918
Yeah.

535
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:57,460
Because I am
a woman you love?

536
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:04,751
Dae-su.

537
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:07,668
What?

538
01:02:08,918 --> 01:02:12,085
I wonder where my love is.

539
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:16,876
The night is getting lonelier.

540
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,293
<i>The words we spoke with our eyes</i>

541
01:02:24,918 --> 01:02:28,168
<i>can be felt with these hands</i>

542
01:02:29,501 --> 01:02:33,043
<i>Countless nights may pass</i>

543
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:38,043
<i>but my heart is turned to you.</i>

544
01:02:38,918 --> 01:02:42,918
<i>Though I may shed my sad tears</i>

545
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:47,960
<i>it's still your face that I miss</i>

546
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:56,960
They packed up and left in a rental car.

547
01:02:58,751 --> 01:03:03,251
Mi-do called the restaurant and quit.

548
01:03:06,876 --> 01:03:09,085
Let's go after this is done.

549
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:13,668
You should get some rest today.

550
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:20,251
I have insomnia anyway.
"The night is getting lonelier."

551
01:03:21,168 --> 01:03:25,751
Mr. Han, do you really think

552
01:03:26,668 --> 01:03:30,335
Mi-do has fallen in love
with Oh Dae-su?

553
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,085
Already?

554
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,626
Dae-su, it really hurts.

555
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,751
But I'm enduring it.

556
01:04:02,168 --> 01:04:03,751
I want you to know that.

557
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:21,626
How did you hold out?
For 15 years?

558
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:23,793
There's always a way.

559
01:04:25,126 --> 01:04:26,626
Do you like it?

560
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:33,710
You really like it, right?
I want to be good to you.

561
01:05:01,918 --> 01:05:04,210
<i>Do not worry about the future.</i>

562
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,835
<i>Don't imagine anything.</i>

563
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:22,710
<i>I feel thankful for
all those years in that prison.</i>

564
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:29,293
<i>If I was still my old self
would Mi-do have liked me like this?</i>

565
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:09,918
<i>The fact that he knew I wanted to
cut off Park's hand means</i>

566
01:07:10,085 --> 01:07:13,168
<i>he's planted a bug on us.</i>

567
01:07:13,335 --> 01:07:16,085
<i>He knew where we were by tailing us.</i>

568
01:07:16,251 --> 01:07:19,293
<i>"I've been bugged.
Please find it."</i>

569
01:07:20,043 --> 01:07:22,876
<i>Maybe, he let you go,</i>

570
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:27,501
<i>because he has fun watching you
run wild seeking revenge.</i>

571
01:07:28,668 --> 01:07:32,960
<i>Never telling you why,
toying with you forever.</i>

572
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:36,418
<i>Could that be it?</i>

573
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,585

01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,668
<i>But it's time to close up.</i>

584
01:08:27,835 --> 01:08:31,751
Can't I look at the
records of Class '79?

585
01:08:36,668 --> 01:08:38,751
It's dark so turn on the lights.

586
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:44,376
Take your time.

587
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:51,085
Joo-hwan?
Let me ask you something.

588
01:08:52,335 --> 01:08:55,168
Do you know
Lee Woo-jin of Class '79?

589
01:08:55,335 --> 01:08:57,001
I think he went to
America to study.

590
01:08:58,168 --> 01:08:59,626
Lee Woo-fin?

591
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:06,251
Don't know him. Is that his name?
How did you find out?

592
01:09:06,418 --> 01:09:09,585
Looked through all the yearbooks
and found his face.

593
01:09:09,751 --> 01:09:11,876
I wouldn't know him just by his name.

594
01:09:12,043 --> 01:09:14,418
"Scissorhands Hair Salon."

595
01:09:14,585 --> 01:09:17,168
Got anything else?
Like the school records?

596
01:09:17,335 --> 01:09:20,335
Do you know Lee Soo-ah?
She was in our year.

597
01:09:20,501 --> 01:09:25,418
- <i>Lee Soo-ah? She died.</i>
- What class was she in?

598
01:09:25,585 --> 01:09:29,001
Homeroom two. She was in my class

599
01:09:29,168 --> 01:09:32,376
next to yours. What about her?

600
01:09:33,793 --> 01:09:35,876
But why is there

601
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:43,085
no photo, because she was dead.
How did Soo-ah die?

602
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:48,501
That's right, you wouldn't know.
She died after you transferred.

603
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:56,918
She went alone to the Habchun Dam,
fell into the river and drowned.

604
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:04,543
A week later they found
her bloated body in the water.

605
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:07,001
- What was she like?
- Her?

606
01:10:07,168 --> 01:10:10,126
She was a total slut.

607
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:16,585
Acting like a prude on the outside
but a filthy whore on the inside.

608
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:22,835
There was a huge rumor at the school
that she fucked anyone and everyone.

609
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:25,668
I should've gotten in there.

610
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:34,710
Anyway, her family was super rich.
Her grades were really good, too.

611
01:10:34,876 --> 01:10:39,126
But the crucial thing was
that she was such a slut.

612
01:10:39,293 --> 01:10:42,126
This is such an old story.

613
01:10:42,293 --> 01:10:45,876
Dae-su, I don't remember tfoo well
since it was so long ago.

614
01:10:46,043 --> 01:10:49,960
But that Soo-ah...
Wait, didn't you also...?

615
01:11:03,585 --> 01:11:07,335
Hey, what's going on? Joo-hwan!

616
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,835
Joo-hwan
what's happening?

617
01:11:11,793 --> 01:11:14,876
Joo-hwan!

618
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:19,418
Mr. Oh Dae-su?

619
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:26,626
My sister wasn't a slut.

620
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:29,668
I really want you to know that.

621
01:11:31,793 --> 01:11:36,668
Because you got rid of all the bugs
I had to come all the way here.

622
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:38,460
To listen in.

623
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,293
So, Mr. Roh Joo-hwan

624
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:47,335
died because of you. Okay?

625
01:11:59,418 --> 01:12:04,418
You son of a bitch!
I'm going to kill you!

626
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:07,210
I am going to rip you
into little pieces!

627
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,668
Motherfucker!

628
01:12:49,543 --> 01:12:53,251
We're not open yet.
Please come back in an hour.

629
01:12:53,793 --> 01:12:58,043
A man who got six gold teeth here
recommended this place.

630
01:13:06,043 --> 01:13:07,418
Mr. Park?

631
01:13:08,501 --> 01:13:11,376
I had to move because of you.

632
01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:12,751
To celebrate

633
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:18,751
I bought some new TVs. Do you like it?

634
01:13:19,793 --> 01:13:23,335
There are so many channels.
Exciting, huh?

635
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:25,793
Some of them even
refuse to leave.

636
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:29,835
You lived in a place like this
for 15 years?

637
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:32,543
Got used to it after 11 years.

638
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:37,835
Come on, I don't need money.

639
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:40,376
An enemy's enemy is a friend.

640
01:13:45,793 --> 01:13:48,501
We threw away the hand
because it rotted.

641
01:13:48,668 --> 01:13:50,751
My wife will be happy...

642
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:55,418
Damn sons of bitches
I want to kick their asses.

643
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:03,501
So why did you bring me here?

644
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,043
Let me go!

645
01:14:06,793 --> 01:14:10,710
If I don't return after July 5th
then let her go.

646
01:14:14,668 --> 01:14:19,668
While I was locked up
I remember someone visiting me.

647
01:14:19,835 --> 01:14:23,501
- What did that person do?
- Was it three times?

648
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:28,168
I put a hypnosis-inducing
drug in your water.

649
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:29,876
Sodium Barbiturate?

650
01:14:31,085 --> 01:14:32,626
TV Man knows if all.

651
01:14:34,793 --> 01:14:36,376
Dae-su!

652
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:47,918
<i>“Scissorhands Hair Solon.“</i>

653
01:14:54,251 --> 01:14:56,126
That's nonsense.

654
01:14:56,293 --> 01:14:58,501
Even though it was a Catholic school,

655
01:14:58,668 --> 01:15:01,876
I doubt she killed herself
because of those rumors.

656
01:15:02,043 --> 01:15:04,501
There probably was
another reason.

657
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:09,793
Like she got pregnant
or something.

658
01:15:10,501 --> 01:15:14,626
But I don't think Soo-ah
really was a slut.

659
01:15:14,793 --> 01:15:17,043
She was such a
neat and tidy girl.

660
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:20,710
She wouldn't put out
for just anyone.

661
01:15:21,126 --> 01:15:26,168
There must have been a guy
she was going out with.

662
01:15:28,376 --> 01:15:30,126
So who was that guy?

663
01:15:31,543 --> 01:15:33,960
Well, I wouldn't know.

664
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:51,001
Choon-shim.
You knew Lee Soo-ah, right?

665
01:15:51,168 --> 01:15:53,126
Who was her boyfriend?

666
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:55,960
Don't know?

667
01:15:56,126 --> 01:15:57,960
Shut the hell up.

668
01:15:58,126 --> 01:16:02,085
What would you know
about friendship?

669
01:16:02,251 --> 01:16:05,626
Shut your trap. Then who'd know?

670
01:16:06,668 --> 01:16:09,168
Who?
Joo-hwan?

671
01:16:12,876 --> 01:16:14,085
What?

672
01:16:16,168 --> 01:16:21,876
Yeah, I know him.
But how would he know?

673
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:26,335
Yeah. Really?

674
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:29,460
Okay, hang up.
I'll call you in a bit.

675
01:16:35,293 --> 01:16:41,376
Choon-shim says Joo-hwan
had told her about it.

676
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:44,918
And says that
you would know the best.

677
01:16:58,876 --> 01:17:03,126
<i>Ring, ring, move aside.</i>

678
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:12,876
<i>You'll get hurt if you hesitate.</i>

679
01:17:24,085 --> 01:17:26,251
<i>"Oh Dae-su"</i>

680
01:17:42,501 --> 01:17:46,626
Look at you. Put it out!

681
01:17:46,793 --> 01:17:50,835
I'm transferring today to Seoul.

682
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,418
So butt out, Miss Kim.

683
01:17:55,585 --> 01:17:57,335
You good-for-nothing!

684
01:18:53,793 --> 01:18:59,835
- You're Oh Dae-su, right?
- And you're Miss...?

685
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,210
I heard you're popular
among the girls.

686
01:19:03,501 --> 01:19:06,460
You know how rumors are.

687
01:19:06,626 --> 01:19:10,251
I heard you're really funny.
Say something funny.

688
01:19:11,501 --> 01:19:16,418
Being stuck with one image
isn't healthy, but...

689
01:19:26,418 --> 01:19:31,418
There's this father and son.
They went to the public bath...

690
01:19:31,585 --> 01:19:32,793
See you later.

691
01:19:56,543 --> 01:20:00,543
<i>"Take Care
Homeroom Three Fuckheads!"</i>

692
01:20:58,793 --> 01:21:00,918
- Come on.
- Wait.

693
01:21:03,543 --> 01:21:05,751
- Come here.
- No.

694
01:21:08,418 --> 01:21:11,335
- Hurry and come here.
- Okay, okay.

695
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:21,626
Satisfied?

696
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:24,126
- Raise this up.
- No way.

697
01:21:24,293 --> 01:21:26,626
- Raise it.
- No.

698
01:21:41,001 --> 01:21:42,168
What?

699
01:21:50,876 --> 01:21:52,626
It tickles.

700
01:22:21,626 --> 01:22:23,168
Give it here.

701
01:22:28,251 --> 01:22:29,751
What are you doing?

702
01:22:29,918 --> 01:22:32,585
- Let me see.
- See what?

703
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:35,918
- Let me see.
- Stop.

704
01:22:46,168 --> 01:22:47,793
Go away.

705
01:24:29,626 --> 01:24:32,710
Was it really Soo-ah?
You sure?

706
01:24:32,876 --> 01:24:34,835
I don't know her name.

707
01:24:35,001 --> 01:24:40,210
All I know is that she's in your class
and she rides a red bike.

708
01:24:46,876 --> 01:24:49,835
Have a good trip.
See you in Seoul if I go.

709
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:53,501
- Where are you going?
- Going on a date with Choon-shim.

710
01:24:54,585 --> 01:24:57,376
You're dead meat
if you tell anyone!

711
01:25:01,835 --> 01:25:03,085
<i>No way.</i>

712
01:25:04,793 --> 01:25:08,626
<i>You get locked up for 15 years
just for saying that?</i>

713
01:25:10,835 --> 01:25:12,751
<i>Was that such a big sin?</i>

714
01:25:15,585 --> 01:25:20,793
<i>Be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same.</i>

715
01:25:23,876 --> 01:25:26,210
That's what Lee Woo-jin believes.

716
01:25:27,835 --> 01:25:32,085
Then what's special about
July 5th?

717
01:25:33,585 --> 01:25:34,751
That's the day

718
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,751
Lee Soo-ah died.

719
01:25:45,126 --> 01:25:46,793
It's over then.

720
01:25:47,335 --> 01:25:53,210
You said it's not about vengeance
but finding out why he locked you up.

721
01:25:54,418 --> 01:25:58,876
Now we'll run away where
he can never find us, right?

722
01:26:02,168 --> 01:26:04,460
I can't end it like this.

723
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:07,835
Vengeance has now
become a part of me.

724
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:15,710
But you don't even know
where he lives.

725
01:26:16,835 --> 01:26:20,085
<i>Like a gazelle from
the hand of the hunter</i>

726
01:26:20,251 --> 01:26:23,668
<i>Like a bird from the snare of the fowler</i>

727
01:26:23,835 --> 01:26:25,418
<i>Free yourself.</i>

728
01:26:26,001 --> 01:26:31,293
<i>It's from The Proverbs chapter 6 verse 4.
“Proverbs“ is another word for “Maxim“.</i>

729
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:36,168
<i>And Evergreen said
he lives in a high tower.</i>

730
01:26:36,335 --> 01:26:41,293
<i>So chapter 6 verse 4
must mean the floor numbers.</i>

731
01:26:42,626 --> 01:26:46,251
<i>Fourth floor? Sixth floor?</i>

732
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:48,876
<i>Or the sixty-fourth floor?</i>

733
01:26:51,793 --> 01:26:52,876
<i>P?</i>

734
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:54,751
<i>Penthouse!</i>

735
01:26:58,043 --> 01:27:00,293
<i>Please press the passcode.</i>

736
01:27:06,876 --> 01:27:09,585
What would you like me to pray for?

737
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:16,043
<i>Wrong entry. Please press again.</i>

738
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:25,168
<i>Wrong entry. Please press again.</i>

739
01:27:25,335 --> 01:27:26,835
"Dear Lord,

740
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:33,960
please let me meet
a younger man next time."

741
01:28:24,126 --> 01:28:29,418
Please make Lee Woo-jin
kneel down to Dae-su

742
01:28:30,376 --> 01:28:33,751
and beg him for mercy.

743
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:49,668
You slept with your sister.

744
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,960
Let's go up and talk.

745
01:29:25,001 --> 01:29:26,043
Get him!

746
01:29:49,085 --> 01:29:51,376
Let's talk it out.

747
01:30:22,043 --> 01:30:23,585
Feels great.

748
01:30:25,876 --> 01:30:27,460
You slept with your sister.

749
01:30:27,626 --> 01:30:28,918
So refreshing.

750
01:30:35,668 --> 01:30:40,960
And I started the rumors.
That's why your sister died.

751
01:30:48,251 --> 01:30:52,918
Looking through the mirror
reminds me of that day. Same for you?

752
01:30:53,085 --> 01:30:58,126
How unfair of you to erase my memory
and then to tell me to find it.

753
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,501
I won, so

754
01:31:02,793 --> 01:31:04,668
die like you promised.

755
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:10,918
You think you couldn't remember that day
because you were hypnotized? Really?

756
01:31:12,543 --> 01:31:15,668
Do you know the real reason
why you couldn't remember?

757
01:31:18,876 --> 01:31:20,210
Let me tell you.

758
01:31:24,335 --> 01:31:25,960
You just forgot.

759
01:31:26,835 --> 01:31:29,251
Is that a letdown?

760
01:31:29,418 --> 01:31:32,835
But it's true
you simply forgot.

761
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:35,626
Why?
Because it wasn't your business.

762
01:31:36,751 --> 01:31:41,793
Your rumor grew to the point where
they were saying Soo-ah got pregnant.

763
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:46,960
My sister got sucked into that rumor
and in the end, began to believe it.

764
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:51,918
Then, her period actually stopped
and her belly began to swell.

765
01:31:52,085 --> 01:31:53,585
Amazing, isn't it?

766
01:31:53,751 --> 01:31:57,543
Ever thought about the girl, pregnant
with a child who's also her nephew?

767
01:31:57,710 --> 01:31:59,293
Understand now?

768
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:04,918
Your tongue got my sister pregnant.

769
01:32:06,751 --> 01:32:09,085
It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick.

770
01:32:10,585 --> 01:32:12,543
It was Oh Dae-su's tongue.

771
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:19,585
Is that why you killed your sister?

772
01:32:20,126 --> 01:32:25,668
I thought about the boy, about to
father a child who's also his nephew.

773
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,293
You were probably afraid.

774
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:34,335
Afraid that everyone will find out
once the baby's born.

775
01:32:35,168 --> 01:32:39,751
When you realized that it was all just
her imagination after you killed her -

776
01:32:39,918 --> 01:32:42,168
how you must have hated me.

777
01:32:43,793 --> 01:32:45,085
It's understandable.

778
01:32:50,251 --> 01:32:55,251
They say Soo-ah died alone at the dam
but who took this photo?

779
01:32:56,751 --> 01:32:58,710
What about this date, July 5th?

780
01:33:06,168 --> 01:33:09,335
This is no fun.

781
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:15,210
I'll just finish what I was telling you.
Listen carefully. My story is really fun.

782
01:33:15,376 --> 01:33:18,126
<i>Ever heard of post-hypnotic suggestion?</i>

783
01:33:18,293 --> 01:33:20,668
<i>You suggest something during hypnosis</i>

784
01:33:20,835 --> 01:33:23,543
<i>and then it's acted out
in your awakened state.</i>

785
01:33:24,668 --> 01:33:26,793
Still haven't figured if out?

786
01:33:32,751 --> 01:33:36,376
You bring a complete stranger home
who are you?

787
01:33:36,835 --> 01:33:39,210
<i>Who are you, you rotten bastard?</i>

788
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,960
<i>We hypnotized you both.</i>

789
01:33:48,293 --> 01:33:51,168
<i>One very fortunate thing
was that you both were</i>

790
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:55,001
<i>highly receptive to hypnosis
compared to average people.</i>

791
01:33:56,126 --> 01:33:57,543
<i>Isn't this fun?</i>

792
01:33:57,710 --> 01:34:02,460
<i>One word gets you pregnant,
one word gets you in love.</i>

793
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:09,001
<i>But no matter how much you two
are receptive to hypnosis</i>

794
01:34:09,168 --> 01:34:12,460
or no matter how good
a hypnotist Ms. Yoo is,

795
01:34:12,626 --> 01:34:16,626
getting people to
fall in love isn't easy.

796
01:34:17,876 --> 01:34:19,668
So do you know what we did?

797
01:34:19,835 --> 01:34:25,293
- Oh that?
- Your first suggestion, of course,

798
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:31,210
was to go to that restaurant
as soon as you were released.

799
01:34:31,376 --> 01:34:35,710
Next, to react to the specific
melody from the cell phone.

800
01:34:35,876 --> 01:34:40,501
When you hear the melody
you were to say certain words.

801
01:34:41,210 --> 01:34:42,626
Who are you?

802
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:47,418
Do you like your clothes?

803
01:34:48,585 --> 01:34:53,835
<i>To the man who says those words
Mi-do was to perform a certain action.</i>

804
01:34:54,001 --> 01:34:57,960
<i>When she grabs your hand
your reaction was to be, of course...</i>

805
01:35:01,501 --> 01:35:04,668
Your true mistake was not
failing to find the answer.

806
01:35:05,668 --> 01:35:11,210
You kept asking the wrong question
so how could you find the right answer?

807
01:35:11,376 --> 01:35:16,251
It's not
"Why did Lee Woo-jin lock me up?"

808
01:35:16,418 --> 01:35:19,835
It's "Why did he let me go?"

809
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:21,668
Once again,

810
01:35:22,085 --> 01:35:26,668
why did Lee Woo-jin release
Oh Dae-su after just

811
01:35:28,001 --> 01:35:29,376
15 years?

812
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,668
<i>“Laugh, and the world laughs with you.
Weep, and you will weep alone.“</i>

813
01:39:15,835 --> 01:39:16,793
Mr. Han.

814
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,585
Mister Han!

815
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,126
Mi-do...

816
01:40:16,126 --> 01:40:17,876
Mi-do doesn't know, right?

817
01:40:22,793 --> 01:40:24,960
Why did you hide her there?

818
01:40:26,918 --> 01:40:30,335
You thought he'd hate me
because I cut off his hand?

819
01:40:30,501 --> 01:40:34,251
Didn't you stop to think
maybe it was a trap?

820
01:40:35,001 --> 01:40:39,001
How can you protect your woman
with that brain of yours?

821
01:40:39,835 --> 01:40:44,751
I've been secretly protecting Mi-do
since she was three.

822
01:40:44,918 --> 01:40:47,460
But what about you?

823
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:50,085
Mr. Park's hand?

824
01:40:51,251 --> 01:40:53,126
You imbecile.

825
01:40:53,876 --> 01:40:57,043
Know that new prison of his?
He said he had to move.

826
01:40:57,210 --> 01:41:00,793
So I gave him that building
in payment for his hand!

827
01:41:24,501 --> 01:41:25,793
Dae-su!

828
01:41:27,793 --> 01:41:31,710
There's a box here.

829
01:41:31,876 --> 01:41:36,251
It's that some violet box.
He's telling me to open it.

830
01:41:36,418 --> 01:41:37,460
No!

831
01:41:38,168 --> 01:41:40,876
No, Mi-do, don't.

832
01:41:41,043 --> 01:41:43,210
Don't open it no matter what.

833
01:41:43,376 --> 01:41:45,585
If you open it
something terrible will happen.

834
01:41:45,751 --> 01:41:49,335
What's in it?
You know, don't you?

835
01:41:49,501 --> 01:41:52,335
Mi-do. My sweet pea
wait a bit longer.

836
01:41:52,501 --> 01:41:57,751
I'll be there very soon.

837
01:41:59,501 --> 01:42:05,585
Can't you come right now?
I'm scared.

838
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:07,626
My sweet pea, you can wait for me?

839
01:42:07,793 --> 01:42:08,751
Yes.

840
01:42:09,751 --> 01:42:13,085
Good.
Good girl.

841
01:42:13,251 --> 01:42:17,626
I'll call you very soon, okay?

842
01:42:32,126 --> 01:42:33,543
I beg you.

843
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:38,960
Please don't tell Mi-do.

844
01:42:40,626 --> 01:42:45,085
What has she done wrong?

845
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:50,585
You know it was all my fault.

846
01:42:52,793 --> 01:42:54,210
I have...

847
01:42:56,001 --> 01:43:01,210
I have committed a terrible sin
to your sister.

848
01:43:02,835 --> 01:43:08,168
And I was very wrong to you.

849
01:43:09,418 --> 01:43:15,210
So please leave Mi-do alone, okay?

850
01:43:20,085 --> 01:43:25,793
If Mi-do finds out the truth,

851
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,126
you asshole,

852
01:43:28,293 --> 01:43:32,668
from the top of your head
down to the tips of your toes,

853
01:43:32,835 --> 01:43:38,751
no one will be able to find any trace
of your body on this earth. Why?

854
01:43:38,918 --> 01:43:42,335
Because I'm going to
chew up every last piece of it.

855
01:43:44,210 --> 01:43:45,335
Woo-jin!

856
01:43:46,335 --> 01:43:48,710
Mr. Lee Woo-jin
I made a mistake.

857
01:43:48,876 --> 01:43:51,793
Please forget what I said.

858
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,876
Sir! Boss!

859
01:43:54,376 --> 01:43:55,710
Woo-jin!

860
01:43:55,876 --> 01:44:00,043
We're Evergreen Old Boys
remember?

861
01:44:00,835 --> 01:44:07,460
With the energy from the green pine tree,

862
01:44:09,793 --> 01:44:14,460
the Great Sangnok High...

863
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:20,418
I'll do whatever you want.

864
01:44:20,585 --> 01:44:23,335
I'll do anything.
I beg you.

865
01:44:23,501 --> 01:44:28,751
Woo-jin, if you want me
to be a dog, I will!

866
01:44:28,918 --> 01:44:32,418
I'm Woo-jin's dog from now on!

867
01:44:32,585 --> 01:44:34,376
I'm your puppy!

868
01:44:39,585 --> 01:44:43,126
Look, I'm wagging my tail.

869
01:44:43,293 --> 01:44:44,668
I'm a dog.

870
01:44:44,835 --> 01:44:48,835
I'll guard your house.
I'll be your slave dog.

871
01:46:56,668 --> 01:46:57,960
The box...

872
01:47:03,876 --> 01:47:05,460
Just leave it closed.

873
01:47:16,126 --> 01:47:17,585
Now,

874
01:47:20,168 --> 01:47:22,751
what joy will I live for?

875
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:28,251
<i>Dae-su.</i>

876
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:30,751
<i>It really hurts.</i>

877
01:48:32,335 --> 01:48:34,085
<i>But I'm enduring it.</i>

878
01:48:35,626 --> 01:48:37,126
<i>I want you to know that.</i>

879
01:48:52,418 --> 01:48:55,376
<i>How did you hold out? For 15 years?</i>

880
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:02,418
My sister and I knew everything
but still loved each other.

881
01:49:05,543 --> 01:49:08,210
Can you two do the same?

882
01:49:10,543 --> 01:49:13,085
<i>Dae-su. Do you like it?</i>

883
01:49:13,251 --> 01:49:15,835
<i>I want to be good to you.</i>

884
01:49:50,876 --> 01:49:52,043
Soo-ah.

885
01:50:07,543 --> 01:50:08,751
Woo-jin.

886
01:50:10,793 --> 01:50:12,835
I know you've been scared.

887
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:20,585
So let go of me, okay?

888
01:50:35,168 --> 01:50:38,918
Remember me, alright?

889
01:50:46,626 --> 01:50:49,626
I have no regrets.
Do you?

890
01:51:34,918 --> 01:51:38,668
<i>Up until this point is
the whole story of my adventure.</i>

891
01:51:38,835 --> 01:51:42,418
<i>Thank you gor listening to
this terrible story to the end.</i>

892
01:51:43,043 --> 01:51:46,918
<i>I hope you now understand
me sending a letter</i>

893
01:51:47,085 --> 01:51:53,335
<i>instead of talking to you in person.
This is because I have no tongue.</i>

894
01:51:53,501 --> 01:51:57,168
To be honest
I have no reason to help you.

895
01:52:01,918 --> 01:52:03,835
But you see,

896
01:52:04,793 --> 01:52:07,835
I was touched
by this lust sentence.

897
01:52:09,001 --> 01:52:13,418
<i>"Even though I'm no better than a beast,</i>

898
01:52:13,585 --> 01:52:18,460
<i>don't I have the right to live?“</i>

899
01:52:21,168 --> 01:52:24,710
But the hypnosis may go wrong
and mess up your memories.

900
01:52:26,085 --> 01:52:27,710
Will that be okay?

901
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:50,210
Once you're ready,

902
01:52:52,335 --> 01:52:54,793
stare at that tree.

903
01:53:11,251 --> 01:53:16,876
The tree is slowly changing
into a concrete pillar.

904
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:29,293
<i>You're now inside
Lee Woo-Jin's penthouse.</i>

905
01:53:30,293 --> 01:53:32,085
<i>It's a dreary night.</i>

906
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:40,001
<i>The sound of your footsteps to the window
echoes through the room.</i>

907
01:53:54,043 --> 01:53:58,043
<i>When I ring my bell,</i>

908
01:53:59,085 --> 01:54:02,251
<i>you'll be split into two persons.</i>

909
01:54:06,126 --> 01:54:10,210
<i>The one who doesn't know the secret
is named "Oh Dae-su."</i>

910
01:54:10,751 --> 01:54:14,460
<i>The one who keeps the secret
is named "The Monster."</i>

911
01:54:15,001 --> 01:54:16,876
<i>When I ring my bell again,</i>

912
01:54:17,043 --> 01:54:20,418
<i>the Monster will turn around
and begin walking.</i>

913
01:54:25,126 --> 01:54:29,835
<i>With each step he will age by one year.</i>

914
01:54:30,001 --> 01:54:34,460
<i>When the Monster reaches 70 he will die.</i>

915
01:54:34,876 --> 01:54:40,335
<i>There's no need to worry.
It will be a very peaceful death.</i>

916
01:54:47,876 --> 01:54:49,085
<i>Good luck.</i>

917
01:55:31,876 --> 01:55:33,918
What's wrong?

918
01:55:34,793 --> 01:55:36,835
Look at you.

919
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:07,835
Who were you with?

920
01:57:03,751 --> 01:57:06,085
I love you,

921
01:57:06,251 --> 01:57:08,001
Dae-su.
