00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:40,930
We honeymooned in Sea Island.

340
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:42,564
- [gasping]
- [Bunny] Oh!

341
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,599
- [Violet] What?
- We honeymooned in Sea Island.

342
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,567
Seriously?

343
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:46,802
Yeah, did you eat at Dominick's?

344
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:48,871
- I was a little nervous.
- [Bill chuckles]

345
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,505
Took a while
to get used to things.

346
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:52,407
Yeah. It takes a minute
to settle in.

347
00:15:52,474 --> 00:15:54,275
- Yeah.
- But it gets easier, though.

348
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:56,344
- It does. Yeah.
- [sighs] Well, it...

349
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:57,813
I'm just really excited
to be here.

350
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,581
- So excited, I can't even...
- We couldn't tell.

351
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:02,151
To be honest, I've been
out of it since we arrived.

352
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:03,585
Yeah.

353
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:04,787
- Bill says it's the jetlag.
- [Bunny] Mm-hm.

354
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:06,722
It's all just been
a bit of a blur.

355
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:08,557
It's the desert air.
You'll get used to it.

356
00:16:08,624 --> 00:16:10,593
That's what
Dr. Collins said, too.

357
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:14,097
He was so sweet to stop by.

358
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,397
- [Bill] And, Jack, you're...
- [Jack] I'm a technical engineer.

359
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,000
She should come shopping
with us.

360
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,768
[Jack] A different department
than, uh, Dean and Ted.

361
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:20,669
Yeah, technically a worse,
less important department.

362
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:22,873
I haven't really gotten
to talk to Frank very much.

363
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,876
Frank doesn't have to talk
to you.

364
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:26,910
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

365
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:29,378
You have no idea
how extraordinary he is.

366
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,148
Or what he can do.

367
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:32,448
You're lucky to even know
who he is,

368
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:34,117
let alone be standing
in his house.

369
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:37,487
- [Bunny and Violet laughing]
- I'm just excited. I'm sorry.

370
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:40,323
I was just excited. Okay.

371
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,126
[glass chiming]

372
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:44,128
- Oh! Guys, guys, guys. Go, go, go, go.
- [Dean] Ooh, here we go.

373
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:47,198
- [Violet] This way?
- Yeah, you should go in front.

374
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:49,766
[light chatter, laughter]

375
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:57,340
[Shelley]
Gather 'round, everyone.

376
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,578
Now, usually,
we don't have the opportunity

377
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,815
to welcome couples in our home.

378
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:06,951
But on this occasion,
we just couldn't wait

379
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:10,088
to celebrate
our newest residents.

380
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,456
Bill, Violet...

381
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,526
I am so happy for you,

382
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:17,695
that you get to learn
from my husband...

383
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:20,265
and join this mission

384
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,400
and become a part
of this family.

385
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:28,606
Frank has built something
truly special.

386
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,411
What he's created out here,
it's...

387
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:34,980
It's a different way.

388
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,950
A better way.

389
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,087
- And we only have each other...
- [woman] Why are we here?

390
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:42,588
[man whispering tersely]

391
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,557
[whispering]
Let's go, right now.

392
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:48,962
We shouldn't be here.

393
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:55,268
- [whispering] What was that?
- [faint chatter]

394
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,768
[Frank] Now, now.

395
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:04,911
Margaret and Ted are
going through a difficult time.

396
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:12,552
Margaret's question is right.
It is the good question to ask.

397
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:15,956
Why the hell are we here?

398
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:18,926
- [chuckles]
- [scattered laughter]

399
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:23,763
Why, when this landscape
can seem so...

400
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:28,002
barren, so hard, so dusty, so...

401
00:18:29,937 --> 00:18:31,471
worthless?

402
00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:34,741
Why not run?

403
00:18:34,808 --> 00:18:36,776
Why not go back to safety,
status quo,

404
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:39,712
where it's safe,
where we should be?

405
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:45,452
No, I choose...
We choose to stand our ground.

406
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,587
Right?

407
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:50,992
To look harder, to dig deeper.

408
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,263
To mine that pure,

409
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,834
unbridled potential.

410
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:06,207
That gem of limitless
and unimaginable value.

411
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:11,846
It's just too easy to get
distracted by what seems.

412
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:16,052
Much more difficult, "braver,"
I would say...

413
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:20,622
to search for what could be.

414
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,227
- Dean...
- [Dean] Hm?

415
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:29,098
What is the enemy of progress?

416
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,766
- Chaos.
- Yes.

417
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:34,070
- [shudders]
- [Dean chuckles]

418
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:36,973
Nasty word. Chaos.

419
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:41,576
Merciless foe, that chaos.

420
00:19:42,711 --> 00:19:45,613
Energy unfocused,
innovation hindered,

421
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,484
hope strangled,
greatness disguised.

422
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:51,754
I see greatness
in each one of you.

423
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:53,522
I know exactly who you are.

424
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:58,261
- What are we doing?
- [all] Changing the world.

425
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:00,998
- What are we doing?
- [all] Changing the world.

426
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:03,166
That's right.

427
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:06,103
I look around, I see
another reason why I'm here.

428
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:10,573
Once unfamiliar faces,
strangers, one and all, now...

429
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:13,642
one brave family.

430
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,212
Men like Dr. Collins.

00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,547
One of our first, who built
this community with me.

432
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:20,318
Thank you,
Dr. Collins for your vision.

433
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,922
And adventurers like Bill,
our newest intrepid explorer.

434
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:27,191
This brave,
young Robinson Crusoe,

435
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:30,261
who's choosing to join us
on this adventure.

436
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:32,696
Bill, thank you
for being our partner in this.

437
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:38,102
And thank you, Violet,
for being his partner in this.

438
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:40,071
He could not do this
without you.

439
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,773
All of you wives...

440
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:46,777
We men, we ask a lot.

441
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:50,715
We ask for strength,
a shoulder to cry on...

442
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,919
food at home, a house cleaned,

443
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,621
and discretion, above all else.
And that...

444
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,558
That's very difficult.

445
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,500
You are my rock.

446
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,102
I would not be here without you.

447
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,770
Thank you.

[Alice] What? No.
That did not happen.

[sighing] She was upset.

500
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:50,162
It was humiliating,
and she's gonna get Ted fired.

00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:51,563
Oh.

Of course.
It was a terrible accident.

- Needs a little encouragement.

under one roof,

1044
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,856
seeing how much we've all grown.

1045
01:02:29,093 --> 01:02:30,627
But few...

1046
01:02:31,794 --> 01:02:33,796
Few have grown as...

1047
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:37,568

1048
01:02:37,635 --> 01:02:39,403

I've debated long and hard
about this, Lord knows. Whew!

1052
01:02:47,578 --> 01:02:51,715
It's certainly
out of the ordinary.

1053
01:02:51,782 --> 01:02:55,486
But you know what? This man
is out of the ordinary.

1054

1055

1056
01:03:06,998 --> 01:03:09,434
to invite you to join our...

1057
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:13,005

1073
01:04:38,592 --> 01:04:41,261
Look at this boy dance!

1074
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:45,901
Come on! Come on!

1075
01:04:45,968 --> 01:04:49,570
- [crying quietly]
- [music continues, faint]

1076
01:04:49,637 --> 01:04:51,940

Look what he can do!

1080
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:05,888
Hey. What's wrong? Honey.

1081
01:05:07,156 --> 01:05:09,925
What happened? What's wrong?

1082
01:05:11,526 --> 01:05:12,995
[Frank] It's extraordinary!

1083
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:20,003
[Frank laughing]

1084
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:22,105
Everything's fine. It's okay.

1085
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:23,438
Bunny, we need to go.

1086
01:05:23,505 --> 01:05:24,807
We need to get out of here
right now.

1087
01:05:24,873 --> 01:05:27,376
- No, no, no. We're okay.
- We need to go.

1088
01:05:27,442 --> 01:05:31,047
We're okay. Come on.
Tell me, what happened?

1089
01:05:31,114 --> 01:05:34,117
[music increases in tempo]

1090
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:36,351
How about that, huh?

1091
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:38,487
You watching him dance?

1092
01:05:38,554 --> 01:05:40,422
Margaret was right.

1093
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:45,561
She was asking questions
that they don't want us to ask.

1094
01:05:45,627 --> 01:05:48,631
And so they silenced her.

1095
01:05:48,698 --> 01:05:50,567
She didn't slip.
It wasn't an accident.

1096
01:05:50,633 --> 01:05:53,436
I saw it happen.
I saw her fall.

1097
01:05:53,503 --> 01:05:55,672
They're lying about everything.

1098
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,777
[Frank] Dance, Jack!

1099
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:05,983
Let's make him spin, shall we?

1100
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:08,551
And so I went out there,
and I saw it.

1101
01:06:08,618 --> 01:06:10,687
You went... you went out where?

1102
01:06:10,753 --> 01:06:14,390
[Frank] Yeah, that's it!
Come on, boy, faster!

1103
01:06:14,457 --> 01:06:17,127
Keep it going! Come on!
Come on! Yeah!

1104
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,865
That's it!

1105
01:06:22,033 --> 01:06:25,070
- [music stops]
- [Frank] Ha-ha!

1106
01:06:25,136 --> 01:06:27,738
Doesn't that make you believe?

1107
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:30,942
[laughing] Stand up!

1108
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:34,946
Stand up, take a bow!
Take a bow, you deserve it!

1109
01:06:35,013 --> 01:06:38,149
And when I touched it,
I saw something.

1110
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:41,752
And I keep remembering more.

1111
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:44,622
And I heard Frank's voice,
and he's in my head...

1112
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:46,958
It's more than just
a celebration

1113
01:06:47,025 --> 01:06:51,863
of our freedom from society's
arbitrary regulations,

1114
01:06:51,931 --> 01:06:57,103
it's a celebration
of potential unleashed!

1115
01:06:57,169 --> 01:07:00,006
It's a reminder of who we are!

1116
01:07:00,072 --> 01:07:02,474
Can I just show you?
Let's just go out there.

1117
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,675
Everybody will be
distracted right now.

1118
01:07:03,742 --> 01:07:04,977
We can take Dean's car.

1119
01:07:05,044 --> 01:07:06,711
- We can head to...
- Stop. Stop. Stop it!

1120
01:07:08,314 --> 01:07:10,649
- Have you lost your mind?
- What?

1121
01:07:10,715 --> 01:07:12,417
You went to Headquarters?

1122
01:07:12,484 --> 01:07:14,954
- Because I thought I saw a plane crash.
- It is the one rule...

1123
01:07:15,021 --> 01:07:16,521
- [Alice] No, I know...
- ...they ask us to respect.

1124
01:07:16,588 --> 01:07:18,357
You know how dangerous it is.

1125
01:07:18,423 --> 01:07:20,525
We are not going backwards.

1126
01:07:20,592 --> 01:07:23,030
We're pushing forwards, yes?

1127
01:07:23,863 --> 01:07:25,365
We move!

1128
01:07:25,431 --> 01:07:28,467
- You stole from Dr. Collins?
- Because Margaret can't be okay!

1129
01:07:28,534 --> 01:07:31,171
Get a hold of yourself, Alice!

1130
01:07:31,238 --> 01:07:33,572
You are behaving like a child.

1131
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:35,108

01:10:01,692 --> 01:10:02,894
[laughs]

1204
01:10:02,961 --> 01:10:04,662
- He liked that.
- No, he didn't.

1205
01:10:04,728 --> 01:10:06,565
- [Peg] Where's your drink?
- [Alice] It's right here. Cheers!

1206
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:08,799
[Violet] Cheers.
It's a wonderful home.

1207
01:10:08,866 --> 01:10:10,569
- How are you?
- Me?

1208
01:10:10,634 --> 01:10:11,903
- I'm amazing.
- Mm-hm.

1209
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,804
After the night Jack had,
I'm incredible.

1210
01:10:13,871 --> 01:10:14,940
Right. Of course.

1211
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:17,842
Cheers. Thanks for coming.

1212
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:19,877
- You were a triumph last night.
- Oh! [chuckles]

1213
01:10:19,945 --> 01:10:21,213
We haven't stopped talking
about you.

1214
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:22,813
You guys go now
and enjoy yourselves.

1215
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,749
I'm gonna go back
to the plates and finish up,

1216
01:10:25,816 --> 01:10:27,651
- and, um, I'll see you in...
- Can I help you?

1217
01:10:27,718 --> 01:10:29,154
- No, no, no, no, go.
- You sure? Okay.

1218
01:10:29,221 --> 01:10:30,654
Promise. Go snoop.

1219
01:10:30,721 --> 01:10:32,024
I love this record player.

1220
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:33,493
- You do? You like it, Bill?
- I love it.

1221
01:10:33,559 --> 01:10:35,261
At my house, I have a bench.
How did you get...

1222
01:10:35,328 --> 01:10:37,863
["Desafinado" playing
on record player]

1223
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:39,764
[Peg] You can probably
tell by now

1224
01:10:39,831 --> 01:10:42,568
that appetizers are where
I really express myself

1225
01:10:42,634 --> 01:10:44,504
and buck convention.

1226
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:45,837
[Violet] It's a skill.

1227
01:10:45,905 --> 01:10:47,540
Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1228
01:10:47,607 --> 01:10:49,142
Can't be taught.

1229
01:10:49,774 --> 01:10:53,346
[humming melody]

1230
01:11:02,355 --> 01:11:04,391
[Frank] I learned something
very exciting.

1231
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,426
[exhales]

1232
01:11:06,493 --> 01:11:07,895
Oh, really? What's that?

1233
01:11:07,961 --> 01:11:10,397
Rumor is you and Jack
are trying.

1234
01:11:10,464 --> 01:11:12,166
Oh, well...

1235
01:11:12,232 --> 01:11:13,901
- We'll see. [chuckles]
- Mm.

1236
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:16,303
Hope we'll see a little boy.

1237
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,238
[both laugh]

1238
01:11:21,874 --> 01:11:25,412
[smacks lips] I'm sorry
Bunny didn't believe you.

1239
01:11:30,584 --> 01:11:32,419
[Frank chuckles softly]

1240
01:11:36,457 --> 01:11:39,093
But then again, you didn't
believe Margaret, so...

1241
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:42,964
why should anyone believe you?

1242
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:52,407
My God, you fascinate me.

1243
01:11:53,874 --> 01:11:55,742
Because I've been waiting
for someone like you.

1244
01:11:55,809 --> 01:11:58,779
Someone to challenge me.

1245
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:03,284
No great man has changed
the course of history

1246
01:12:03,351 --> 01:12:07,089
without being pushed
to the limits of his potential.

1247
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,425
And you push me.

1248
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:12,928
Yeah.

1249
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:15,797
[chuckles lightly]

1250
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:17,933
I do hope you keep going.

1251
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,080
And yet, here you are.

1252
01:12:32,847 --> 01:12:34,350
Preparing dinner.

1253
01:12:36,851 --> 01:12:38,320
Like a good girl.

1254
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:43,927
[chuckles softly]

1255
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:48,265
- [Jack] Sit.
- [Frank] Absolutely.

1256
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:49,699
[Violet] Do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

1257
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:52,002
No, I hope it's a boy.
Thank you.

1258
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:53,737
- Can't get enough of 'em, right?
- [groans]

1259
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,438
- [Violet laughs]
- Girls are hard. They are.

1260
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:57,806
- I'll be right there, all right?
- Thank you.

1261
01:12:59,476 --> 01:13:01,877
You know, Alice tells me you're
a hell of a tennis player.

1262
01:13:01,945 --> 01:13:04,080
- Oh, she does?
- Is that right? Yeah.

1263
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:05,715
[Jack] She's being polite.

1264
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,384
[Frank] Well, we're looking
for some fierce competitors.

1265
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:09,152
If you're ever ready
to get out there, call me.

1266
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:10,988
I've heard about that backhand,
though, it's famous.

1267
01:13:11,055 --> 01:13:12,923
[Frank] If you want a partner,
I'm yours, man.

1268
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:14,824
That's a lot of pressure.
I don't know if...

1269
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,427
Thank you.

1270
01:13:16,494 --> 01:13:18,462
[chatter stops]

1271
01:13:21,666 --> 01:13:23,234
[chuckles softly]

1272
01:13:26,437 --> 01:13:28,205
I'm having the fish. I don't
know what you guys are having.

1273
01:13:28,272 --> 01:13:30,041
- [chatter resumes]
- [clears throat]

1274
01:13:30,107 --> 01:13:31,542
[Peter] Nice to see
a familiar face.

1275
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:33,477
[Bill] Um, so anyways,
those windows right there,

1276
01:13:33,544 --> 01:13:34,912
the slatted windows?

1277
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:36,714
They're actually called
"jalousie" windows.

1278
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:38,015
Did you know that?

1279
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:39,450
- You didn't know why.
- [Peter] Oh, boy.

1280
01:13:39,517 --> 01:13:40,751
So, the etymology is...

1281
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:42,020
[in French accent]
..."jealousy."

1282
01:13:42,087 --> 01:13:43,255
And you say,
"Whose baby is this?"

1283
01:13:43,322 --> 01:13:44,690
And they say, "It's your baby."

1284
01:13:44,756 --> 01:13:46,425
And you say,
"How could that be?"

1285
01:13:46,491 --> 01:13:47,858
And it is your baby.

1286
01:13:47,926 --> 01:13:50,228
And I just do it every year.

1287
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:53,432
- Violet, where are you from?
- [chatter subsides]

1288
01:13:53,498 --> 01:13:56,435
- Pardon?
- I said, "Where are you from?"

1289
01:13:57,769 --> 01:13:59,338
Philadelphia.

1290
01:13:59,404 --> 01:14:01,373
- Mm! I'm from Philadelphia!
- [laughing] Are you serious?

1291
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,141
- I didn't know that.
- I knew I liked you.

1292
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:05,277
[Alice] Most of the women here
are from Philadelphia.

1293
01:14:06,244 --> 01:14:08,613
Or Baltimore. Or Chicago.

1294
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,847
I've noticed.

1295
01:14:09,915 --> 01:14:11,216
[Jack] Mm. Can I
get anyone anything?

1296
01:14:11,283 --> 01:14:12,484
[Peg] I for one do not miss
the winters.

1297
01:14:12,551 --> 01:14:14,253
No, no, no.
I thrive in the sunshine,

1298
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,755
even though
I'm alabaster-skinned.

1299
01:14:15,822 --> 01:14:18,224
I love the sunshine.
I love the beach.

1300
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:19,858
- [Peg] Mm.
- [Jack] She does.

1301
01:14:19,926 --> 01:14:21,394
What was the last beach
you went to?

1302
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:22,762
[Peter] Oh, fun fact
about the beach.

1303
01:14:22,829 --> 01:14:24,230
- I read this.
- Yeah?

1304
01:14:24,297 --> 01:14:25,665
Beaches are actually some
of the filthiest places

1305
01:14:25,732 --> 01:14:27,433
in the whole world.

1306
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,202
- Just a sandbox of disease and...
- Peter! [chuckles nervously]

1307
01:14:29,268 --> 01:14:30,536
Do not say "disease"
at the dinner table.

1308
01:14:30,603 --> 01:14:32,171
[Peter] It's true.
They need to know.

1309
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:35,608
I can probably guess.
Hilton Head? Cape Cod?

1310
01:14:35,675 --> 01:14:37,143
Or the Jersey Shore?

1311
01:14:39,612 --> 01:14:42,715
And we all honeymooned
in Sea Island,

1312
01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:45,986
or the Poconos,
or Niagara Falls.

1313
01:14:49,356 --> 01:14:51,492
I think those are popular
honeymoon destinations.

1314
01:14:51,558 --> 01:14:53,761
- Expensive.
- Mm-hm. Beautiful, beautiful.

1315
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:55,996
Peter, you, uh... you haven't
finished your story.

1316
01:14:56,063 --> 01:14:57,765
[Peter] Mm!
Bill over here's probably

1317
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:59,666
- one of the worst golf players...
- I'm sorry, Peter.

1318
01:14:59,733 --> 01:15:02,503
I'm not quite finished. Violet,
where did you meet Bill?

1319
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:05,773
Well, we met on a train.

1320
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:07,341
- To Boston.
- [Violet] To Boston.

1321
01:15:07,408 --> 01:15:08,876
Yeah.

1322
01:15:08,942 --> 01:15:11,111
- Yes.
- [both laughing]

1323
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:12,813
You dropped your ticket.

1324
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,016
And he bent down, picked it up,
gave it to you, right?

1325
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:18,319
It is, yeah.

1326
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,089
That's how Margaret met Ted.

1327
01:15:22,724 --> 01:15:24,325
And Peg, am I right in thinking

1328
01:15:24,392 --> 01:15:26,828
that's how Debbie McIntyre
met her husband?

1329
01:15:26,895 --> 01:15:29,063
Yes, I am. That's how they met.

1330
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,332
- Yes, that's true. I'm jealous.
- [Frank] Is it?

1331
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:32,500
- Honestly, it's such a sweet story.
- [Frank] Wow.

1332
01:15:32,567 --> 01:15:34,102
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [Frank laughs]

1333
01:15:34,169 --> 01:15:34,936
Isn't that funny,
the way those coincidences...

1334
01:15:35,003 --> 01:15:36,638
Incredible.

1335
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:37,872
[Alice] There are only so many
different stories we're told.

1336
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:40,408
We're told what we remember.

1337
01:15:40,975 --> 01:15:43,011
Until...

1338
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:45,747
we try to remember things...

1339
01:15:45,814 --> 01:15:48,483
that they want us to forget.

1340
01:15:49,485 --> 01:15:51,020
- Like Margaret.
- Alice...

1341
01:15:51,086 --> 01:15:54,323
No. Jack. It's okay.

1342
01:15:56,258 --> 01:15:58,661
I'm curious to hear
where she's going with this.

1343
01:16:00,463 --> 01:16:03,332
Frank is doing something to us.

1344
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,542
Delusions, memory problems,
hysteria.

1345
01:16:13,609 --> 01:16:16,145
We saw these issues
with Margaret,

1346
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:18,380
and know that it's, uh,
completely curable.

1347
01:16:18,447 --> 01:16:21,953
Dr. Collins prescribed you
a suite of medications,

1348
01:16:22,018 --> 01:16:23,587
which you are
clearly not taking.

1349
01:16:23,653 --> 01:16:24,654
The question is why...

1350
01:16:24,721 --> 01:16:27,424
He's lying to us.
He's lying to all of us.

1351
01:16:27,491 --> 01:16:30,794
Bunny, your best friend,
is worried about you.

1352
01:16:30,861 --> 01:16:32,295
She thinks that you need help.

1353
01:16:32,362 --> 01:16:33,830
Is that why she's
not here tonight?

1354
01:16:33,897 --> 01:16:35,432
Because you didn't want
to be reminded of that.

1355
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:37,200
He's using you.
He's using all of us.

1356
01:16:37,267 --> 01:16:39,169
Do you even know what
the Victory Project actually is?

1357
01:16:39,236 --> 01:16:42,372
- Have you ever asked?
- Do you?

1358
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:44,641
Is that why you went out there?

1359
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:49,012
To Headquarters?

1360
01:16:50,113 --> 01:16:52,015
What?

1361
01:16:53,451 --> 01:16:55,019
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Alice...

1362
01:16:55,086 --> 01:16:56,254
But you don't know
what he's doing.

1363
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,990
[Frank] You wandered out
by yourself.

1364
01:16:58,055 --> 01:16:59,490
You ignored every rule.

1365
01:16:59,557 --> 01:17:02,226
And she put all your lives
in danger.

1366
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:08,599
Yes, I did go out there

1367
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:10,401
and I went to Headquarters
and I saw what he's hiding.

1368
01:17:10,468 --> 01:17:12,069
- [Frank] What I'm hiding.
- [Alice] He's lying to us.

1369
01:17:12,136 --> 01:17:13,671
- [Frank] Oh, dear.
- [Alice] He's lying to all of us

1370
01:17:13,738 --> 01:17:15,172
about what the Victory Project
actually is.

1371
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:16,008
- He's trapped us here.
- [Frank] Alice...

1372
01:17:16,073 --> 01:17:17,241
Trapped?

1373
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,712
I hope no one feels trapped.
Do you feel trapped?

1374
01:17:21,779 --> 01:17:22,747
Violet?

1375
01:17:24,383 --> 01:17:26,251
- Peg?
- [awkward chuckle]

1376
01:17:28,021 --> 01:17:29,855
This is your psychosis.

1377
01:17:29,923 --> 01:17:33,859
You are experiencing trust
as a feeling of entrapment,

1378
01:17:33,927 --> 01:17:36,228
yet you trust every day.

1379
01:17:36,963 --> 01:17:38,263
We all do.

1380
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:41,800
Tonight, you've trusted us
in your home.

1381
01:17:44,303 --> 01:17:46,738
Just like I trusted you
in my bedroom.

1382
01:17:55,748 --> 01:17:57,784
Alice?

1383
01:17:57,850 --> 01:17:59,285
Do you remember that?

1384
01:18:02,488 --> 01:18:05,158
He's... he's trying
to create a world.

1385
01:18:05,224 --> 01:18:07,160
- If you want to articulate your own argument...
- He's using us.

1386
01:18:07,226 --> 01:18:10,263
- Try using your own words, Alice.
- He's using all of us.

1387
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:12,298
- In your own words!
- What's in this food?

1388
01:18:12,365 --> 01:18:14,167
Let's talk about that!

1389
01:18:14,233 --> 01:18:16,336
- Where did it come from? Huh?
- [Frank] Oh, I'm sorry, everyone.

1390
01:18:16,402 --> 01:18:17,737
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just think about it.

1391
01:18:17,804 --> 01:18:19,906
- I'm sorry, Violet.
- [Alice] Victory milk.

1392
01:18:19,974 --> 01:18:21,808
- This is... this is an anomaly.
- [Alice] Victory meat. Victory eggs.

1393
01:18:21,874 --> 01:18:23,242
- It doesn't usually happen.
- [Alice] It all comes from him.

1394
01:18:23,309 --> 01:18:25,111
She's very sick

1395
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:26,879
- and she will get the help that she needs...
- Everything we're told...

1396
01:18:26,947 --> 01:18:27,916
- ...I promise you both.
- ...everything we are given

1397
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:28,950
comes from him!

1398
01:18:29,017 --> 01:18:30,250
And it's all about control.

1399
01:18:30,317 --> 01:18:31,785
- It's all about control.
- [Frank Laughs]

1400
01:18:31,852 --> 01:18:33,922
We wouldn't even...
He might be poisoning the food!

1401
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:35,222
Enough!

1402
01:18:37,224 --> 01:18:38,592
We come to your house,

1403
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,628
we sit at your table,

1404
01:18:40,694 --> 01:18:44,465
and you insult
and degrade my husband?

1405
01:18:44,531 --> 01:18:46,266
He invites you
to be a part of something

1406
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,602
as extraordinary as he is,

1407
01:18:48,669 --> 01:18:52,172
and you sit there
like a spoiled brat,

1408
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,541
demanding answers
to questions you've made up.

1409
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:59,247
There's a pattern, isn't there?

1410
01:18:59,314 --> 01:19:02,884
A pattern of selfish,
pampered whining.

1411
01:19:05,286 --> 01:19:07,589
Or is it just a desperation
to be exciting?

1412
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:10,558
Hm?

1413
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,727
Spitting in the face
of this opportunity.

1414
01:19:14,462 --> 01:19:19,734
It's heartbreaking that your
sad, desperate paranoia

1415
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:21,903
could destroy
what we're trying to build.

1416
01:19:23,571 --> 01:19:24,572
Hm?

1417
01:19:27,709 --> 01:19:30,645
Well, I won't listen to your
pathetic ranting any longer.

1418
01:19:32,314 --> 01:19:34,283
Frank, honey?

1419
01:19:35,085 --> 01:19:36,619
I'll be in the car.

1420
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:45,327
- [clicks teeth]
- [door opens]

1421
01:19:45,394 --> 01:19:47,396
- [sighing vocally] Well...
- [door closes]

1422
01:19:47,463 --> 01:19:50,833
Jack, I think you may have
over served your wife.

1423
01:19:51,701 --> 01:19:52,568
[chair scraping]

1424
01:19:53,903 --> 01:19:55,304
[utensils clatter]

1425
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:56,605
[whispers] Thank you.

1426
01:20:08,285 --> 01:20:09,853
[door opens]

1427
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:15,525
[sighing]

1428
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:19,863
I was expecting
so much more from you.

1429
01:20:24,868 --> 01:20:26,603
[fork clicks on plate]

1430
01:20:29,239 --> 01:20:31,441
Good luck, Alice.

1431
01:20:34,245 --> 01:20:36,314
Jack, let's talk.

1432
01:20:39,484 --> 01:20:41,285
[door closes]

1433
01:20:44,355 --> 01:20:46,824
[moaning angrily]

1434
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:06,012
[record crackling]

1435
01:21:10,549 --> 01:21:14,686
[door opens, shuts]

1436
01:21:38,878 --> 01:21:41,714
Did you enjoy yourself tonight?

1437
01:21:41,781 --> 01:21:43,449
What?

1438
01:21:43,516 --> 01:21:45,618
No, I didn't
enjoy myself tonight.

1439
01:21:45,685 --> 01:21:48,788
You planned a whole evening
to sabotage me.

1440
01:21:48,855 --> 01:21:53,860
No! No, I would never
do that to you.

1441
01:21:53,928 --> 01:21:56,563
I would never do that to you.
I love you.

1442
01:21:58,665 --> 01:22:01,768
I'm trying...
I'm trying to save us.

1443
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:05,405
You're trying to save us
by going out there.

1444
01:22:06,941 --> 01:22:10,178
Yes, because I saw
a plane crash. I told you.

1445
01:22:10,245 --> 01:22:15,250
But, Jack, everything I said
at that table is true.

1446
01:22:15,317 --> 01:22:16,952
Frank even admitted it to me.

1447
01:22:17,018 --> 01:22:18,886
He admitted it to me
in the kitchen.

1448
01:22:18,954 --> 01:22:22,023
That's why I did that. That's
why all of that happened.

1449
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:23,390
He wouldn't have done that.

1450
01:22:26,627 --> 01:22:29,697
[deep, shaky breaths]

1451
01:22:31,465 --> 01:22:33,601
Jack...

1452
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:36,071
Everyone is acting
like I'm crazy.

1453
01:22:37,339 --> 01:22:39,406
And I'm not crazy.

1454
01:22:41,509 --> 01:22:43,745
And I need you to listen to me.

1455
01:22:46,349 --> 01:22:48,717
I need you to listen to me.

1456
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:54,522
Hey.

1457
01:22:54,589 --> 01:22:58,627
Hey. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1458
01:23:05,334 --> 01:23:06,969
To me...

1459
01:23:09,272 --> 01:23:10,639
you are...

1460
01:23:11,573 --> 01:23:13,709
you are bigger than all of this.

1461
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:17,747
Mm-hm.

1462
01:23:19,383 --> 01:23:21,484
You are bigger than Victory.

1463
01:23:22,418 --> 01:23:24,021
You are bigger than Frank.

1464
01:23:26,522 --> 01:23:27,590
I believe in you.

1465
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:29,525
I believe in <i>you.</i>

1466
01:23:33,297 --> 01:23:34,864
I don't believe in him.

1467
01:23:36,732 --> 01:23:38,534
[whispers]
And I don't trust him.

1468
01:23:40,436 --> 01:23:42,139
And I don't trust this place.

1469
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:48,712
And I don't want
to be here anymore.

1470
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:54,551
I don't want to be here anymore.

1471
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:56,054
And we need to leave.

1472
01:23:58,957 --> 01:24:02,126
[sniffles] We need to leave.
And we can go anywhere.

1473
01:24:02,193 --> 01:24:04,895
We can go anywhere and we can
create our own world,

1474
01:24:04,963 --> 01:24:07,165
and it will be you and me
and we'll be okay.

1475
01:24:07,231 --> 01:24:10,600
And it's not about where we go,
it's just that we're together.

1476
01:24:12,869 --> 01:24:15,940
Please? Please? Please?

1477
01:24:21,046 --> 01:24:22,247
Please?

1478
01:24:26,651 --> 01:24:27,987
[whispering] Please.

1479
01:24:29,288 --> 01:24:30,956
Okay.

1480
01:24:31,023 --> 01:24:32,523
[light gasp]

1481
01:24:33,858 --> 01:24:36,494
- Okay?
- [breathing deeply]

1482
01:24:38,097 --> 01:24:40,032
[sniffles] Okay.

1483
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:45,938
[voice trembling] Okay?

1484
01:24:47,339 --> 01:24:49,175
- Okay.
- [sighs in relief]

1485
01:24:54,546 --> 01:24:56,082
[whimpering]

1486
01:24:59,752 --> 01:25:01,988
I love you. I love you.

1487
01:25:03,789 --> 01:25:05,025
But we need to go tonight.

1488
01:25:05,091 --> 01:25:07,293
We need to go.
We can't be here.

1489
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,728
- [sniffles]
- Hey. Hey.

1490
01:25:11,697 --> 01:25:13,033
[sniffles]

1491
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:17,569
[both chuckle faintly]

1492
01:25:20,707 --> 01:25:22,609
[whispering] I love you.
Let's go.

1493
01:25:22,675 --> 01:25:24,178
I love you.

1494
01:25:25,779 --> 01:25:27,982
- Okay.
- 'Kay. Okay.

1495
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:37,058
[sniffles]

1496
01:25:50,471 --> 01:25:51,906
- [door shuts]
- [Alice] Jack?

1497
01:25:51,973 --> 01:25:55,077
I packed us a snack in case
we drive all night long,

1498
01:25:55,143 --> 01:25:57,745
but I think I packed everything.

1499
01:25:59,014 --> 01:26:00,182
Let's go.

1500
01:26:04,885 --> 01:26:07,621
Baby, let's go. Come on.

1501
01:26:07,688 --> 01:26:09,690
[sniffs] I'm sorry.

1502
01:26:12,094 --> 01:26:13,195
What?

1503
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:16,965
I love you so much, Alice.

1504
01:26:18,866 --> 01:26:20,235
Baby, what's wrong?

1505
01:26:20,302 --> 01:26:22,837
I tried so hard
to keep this from happening.

1506
01:26:23,905 --> 01:26:26,109
- What? Let's...
- Please believe...

1507
01:26:26,175 --> 01:26:27,709
Baby, we need to go.
We need to go.

1508
01:26:27,776 --> 01:26:30,546
Baby, you need to drive.
We need to go. Go. Whoa.

1509
01:26:30,612 --> 01:26:33,382
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No. No! No!

1510
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:36,119
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alice.
- No, Jack, please! I can be better!

1511
01:26:36,185 --> 01:26:38,221
- I can be better! I'm so sorry!
- Alice, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1512
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:39,721
- Let me be better, please!
- I'm sorry!

1513
01:26:39,788 --> 01:26:40,922
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Baby, please!

1514
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:42,191
- Let me be better.
- I'm sorry!

1515
01:26:42,258 --> 01:26:43,593
- Get off me!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1516
01:26:43,658 --> 01:26:44,693
- Let me be better!
- I'm sorry.

1517
01:26:44,759 --> 01:26:46,895
- I'm so...
- Jack, please!

1518
01:26:46,963 --> 01:26:51,534
- They're hurting me! No! No!
- [sobbing]

1519
01:26:51,601 --> 01:26:55,439
No! Jack! They're hurting me!

1520
01:26:55,506 --> 01:26:57,241
They're hurting me!

1521
01:26:57,307 --> 01:26:58,708
Fuck!

1522
01:27:00,643 --> 01:27:02,379
[sobbing]

1523
01:27:02,446 --> 01:27:04,047
Fuck!

[crying]

1525
01:27:20,397 --> 01:27:24,667
No, please, please.
Please, don't...

[faint, high-pitched whining]

1527

No, you need to leave.

No. This world isn't real.
