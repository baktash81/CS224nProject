1
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:41,095
In a time before many can remember,
our planet faced it's greatest challenge...

2
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,016
A Warlord named Piccolo,
came from beyond the stars...

3
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:48,714
...bringing darkness and chaos
to our once peacefull world.

4
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:56,105
Aided by his diciple, Oozaru, the
evil pair brought the human race to the brink of annihilation.

5
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,348
Cities and countries crumbled
beneath them.

6
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:01,167
Countless lives were lost.

7
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:08,011
But... Finally a group of brave warriors
created the Mafubah.

8
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:11,990
A powerfull enchantment, that emprisoned Picollo
deep within the earth.

9
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:18,035
With his master captured,
Oozaru disappeared.

10
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,984
And balance was slowly restored
to our world.

11
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:28,523
And so it has remained for thousands of years.
Untill now!...

12
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,515
The first rule is...
There are no rules.

13
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:30,853
The first one to touch the ground, looses.

14
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:34,283
Prepare to eat dirt!.

15
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,719
Shadow Crane Strike.
You fell for it again.

16
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,679
It's kind of hard to block
a move that I can't see.

17
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:47,582
Goku, you rely to heavily on your
external senses.

18
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:52,967
To see, to hear, to touch,
are all overrated.

19
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:59,277
True power comes from inside.
Your Ki.

20
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:06,025
That's your best defence.
And your greatest weapon.

21
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,525
Use your Ki.

22
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,333
Sorry Grandpa, I don't feel a thing.
- Someday, Goku...

23
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:29,807
Someday I'll beat you.

24
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:33,312
That'll be something to tell your friends,
beating up on a 70-year-old man.

25
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:37,633
What friends?
Everybody at school treats me like I'm nothing.

26
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:41,661
Your special, Goku.
- No, I'm different.

27
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:44,040
I know that, they know that too .

28
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:48,766
They push me so far, that I
wanna explode.

29
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:52,271
I could tear them apart with one hand.

30
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:55,249
I don't train you to fight boys.
Goku, you promised.

31
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:56,791
You made me promise not to fight.

32
00:04:56,826 --> 00:05:01,460
Teach me something I can use.
Teach me how to get the girl.

33
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:05,039
Teach me how to talk to her,
without stumbling over everything I say.

34
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:10,399
Teach me how to be normal.
- Normal is also overrated.

35
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:14,418
You must have faith in who you are.

36
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:20,829
Goku...

37
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:25,018
Happy Birthday.

38
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:28,203
You think I forgot?.

39
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:31,103
Suu-Shinchuu is yours.
- What is it?

40
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:36,672
It's a Dragonball.
It means "Four Stars".

41
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:40,689
In all the world, there are only six others.
From one to seven stars.

42
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:44,546
Besides you, it's my only treasure.

43
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:48,299
What does it do?
- By itself, nothing...

44
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:54,041
But together, the seven dragonballs
will grant the holder one perfect wish.

45
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:57,754
Keep it safe, always.

46
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,018
Thanks, Grandpa.

47
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:32,549
Fuller!

48
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,331
You just smacked my bike.

49
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:38,547
Agundus, did you just fart in here?
Cause I could have sworn I just heard something.

50
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:40,870
Your gonna pay for this, Fuller.

51
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:47,731
Make me pay, Gekko...

52
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:52,419
Come on, Gekko.

53
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:56,111
Right here.
Show me what you got.

54
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:03,297
Just like I thought. Nothing.

55
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:06,410
Carey, let's go.
I'm gonna be late for class.

56
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:09,501
Lady awaits me.

57
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:11,475
What's up, Baby?

58
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,231
Looked like he was gonna cry.
- What's the matter with you?

59
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:58,997
This is an astrological phenomenon
known as a solar eclipse.

60
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:04,711
In two weeks time we will all have the opportunity
to experience this rare phenomenon ourselves.

61
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:10,495
What causes eclipses?
- Mr. Kinnery, Weaver?

62
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,323
Solar eclipse is caused by the moon
blocking the sun from the earth.

63
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:15,994
Correct.

64
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:22,171
From the dawn of civilization, superstitions
have marked the solar eclipse as a sign of the apocalypse.

65
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:28,063
In India the eclipse symbolizes the mark
of the deamon of darkness devouring the sun...

66
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,441
Chinese believe...

67
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:44,149
Goku!
- What?

68
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:48,647
What did our ancesters say about the
upcoming eclipse?

69
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:53,513
My Grandfather would say,
bevare of the Nemics.

70
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,277
Nemics?

71
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:58,689
They're an alien race that nearly
destroyed earth over...

72
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:03,978
2000 years ago.

73
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:08,191
Let's hope it doesn't happen again.

74
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:14,041
Oh no.

75
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:18,389
Not again. I hate those things.
They never work.

76
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,109
Just look at my picture.

77
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:23,295
I have a paper due next period,
and it's stuck in here.

78
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,142
Gotta go.

79
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,118
Dammit!

80
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:51,996
Goku, right?

81
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:58,037
Did you do that?

82
00:11:58,072 --> 00:11:59,942
Yeah.

83
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:05,364
You used your Ki.

84
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,004
You know about Ki?

85
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,607
Just because my names is Chi Chi doesn't
make me a complete idiot.

86
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:14,485
There's a lot stuppider names than
Chi Chi.

87
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,608
I'm not saying that Chi Chi is a stupid name,
just saying that it's not normal.

88
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:22,746
But normal's overrated...

89
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:26,989
I'm not saying that your just overrated...
I'm gonna stop now...

90
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:32,106
I'm having a party tonight at my house.
- I'll be there.

91
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:43,494
Hi...

92
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,064
Hi, Chi Chi...

93
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,123
Goku, I got fresh chicken feet.

94
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:54,109
I couldn't find good swallow tung.

95
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:57,725
But the squals were fab!.

96
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,735
Beauty awaits.

97
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:36,667
Goku? Happy Birthday.

98
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:44,013
Goku?

99
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,718
Check it out.

100
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,757
What are you doing here, Gekko?
- I'm just going to the party.

101
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:06,448
I was invited.
I'm not looking for any trouble.

102
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:13,053
Why don't you turn around, walk away,
no one will ever know you were here.

103
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:16,940
See ya.

104
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,276
Later, loser.

105
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,579
I'm not doing that.

106
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:37,215
I made a promise that I wasn't gonna fight.
- What?

107
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,312
I made a promise I'm not gonna fight.
- It won't be a fight.

108
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,789
It will be a massacre.

109
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:49,316
Missed.

110
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:52,923
Missed again.

111
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:24,734
My hand!
- That's gotta hurt.

112
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:28,727
Chi Chi, thanks for inviting me
to your party.

113
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:33,543
Fuller? The boys. They even showed
what they got.

114
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:36,434
Nothing.

115
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:42,735
Your so dead.
- No, Carey, stop!.

116
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,897
My car.
- Nice swing, good form.

117
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,053
Close one.

118
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,299
Doing good.

119
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:03,870
Hey, Fuller.

120
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:10,580
You got a couple of dings in that
white truck now.

121
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:36,290
You've never done this before, have you?
- Yes, many times.

122
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:38,007
In my head.

123
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:43,049
Your different.

124
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:45,989
I like different.

125
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:55,663
I know this is maybe hard to believe,
we're a lot alike.

126
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,323
This is the best birthday I have ever had.

127
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:03,818
Today is your birthday?

128
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:05,851
Actually, right now.

129
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:10,816
Ever since I can remember me and my Grandpa
celebrate my birthday at the excact same time.

130
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:13,099
Calls it my grand entrance.

131
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,715
What happened to your parents?

132
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,326
I don't know. But my Grandpa said to me
that everything will be explained to me when i turn 18.

133
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:23,731
And I'm 18 now...

134
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:18,087
Piccolo?

135
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:20,542
It's not here.

136
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:30,526
I will have the Dragonball, old man.

137
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:03,597
Something's wrong.

138
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:09,448
Something's wrong with my Grandpa.
- What?

139
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,694
I have to go, I'm sorry.

140
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:13,621
Goku?
- I'll see you later!

141
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:24,089
Grandpa.

142
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,424
Grandpa.

143
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:57,873
I need to get help.
- No, stay here with me.

144
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:02,340
Not much time left.
- I'm sorry, Grandpa, I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

145
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,317
What happened?
- Piccolo has returned.

146
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:08,236
He's got the other Dragonball.
Is it safe?.

147
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,337
It has begun.

148
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:24,405
Find Master Roshi in Paozu, tell him,
Picollo has returned.

149
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,910
To banish Picollo from this world...

150
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:31,198
You must find the Dragonballs,
before the eclipse.

151
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:34,855
What?
- The seven Dragonballs must be found.

152
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,445
For all mens fait will be bound...

153
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,511
Grandpa, stop.
You have to rest.

154
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:47,159
Goku, remember, always have faith...

155
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,515
in who you are.

156
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:22,853
Grandpa.

157
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:47,095
Where is it?
I know it's here.

158
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,977
Are you Piccolo?
Did you kill my Grandfather?

159
00:22:50,012 --> 00:22:52,223
Listen idiot, if I was Piccolo,
who ever that is...

160
00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:54,865
I wouldn't tell you. And if I
did kill your Grandfather...

161
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,912
I would have shot you by now. Somebody
stole my 'Promethium Orb'...

162
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,502
and i'm trying to get it back.
- What?

163
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:04,416
You have it.

164
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:11,820
Nice move, but I'm not gonna miss again.

165
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:14,685
My father found the 'Promethium Orb'
20 years ago...

166
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,732
and you stole it from me last night.
I'm not leaving here without it.

167
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:22,045
I don't know what you're talking about. This
a Dragonball Suu-Shinchuu, four star ball...

168
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,219
and I promised my grandfather that I
would keep it safe...

169
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:26,518
and I'm not letting anyone take it from me.
- Four stars?

170
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:28,809
The Promethium Orb has five stars.

171
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:31,917
Who's the idiot?
Look at it.

172
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:38,869
I could have killed you.

173
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:41,023
You weren't even close.

174
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:45,378
I knew it. There are others.

175
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:48,786
Seven to be excact.
- What do you want for this one?

176
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:49,789
It's not for sale.

177
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:51,911
Everybody's got a price.

178
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,997
Not me.

179
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,053
What happened to your Dragonball?

180
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:59,947
Last night a thief broke into my
fathers company.

181
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,151
'Capsule Corporation'.
Somebody hacked the wault,

182
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:04,314
killed the guards,
and stole the Dragonball.

183
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:13,605
I swore to my father that I would get
it back.

184
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,633
I followed a signal here, and that's
when I ran into you.

185
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:20,752
I'm sorry I fired on you, I thought
you were a murdering thief.

186
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:22,468
Just lucky you weren't a better shot.

187
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:26,469
How did you know I had the Dragonball.
- A little machine I invented.

188
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:30,966
This can detect and locate the signature
of and wavelenght emitted by the Dragonball.

189
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:32,409
See?

190
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:36,358
You made a "Dragonball Energy
Locater"?

191
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:40,054
Cool.
- Dragonball Energy. D.B.E.

192
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:42,651
Catchy name.
- So you must be a scientist.

193
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:44,271
A P.H.D. in applied dynamics.

194
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:46,233
With a minor in tactical weaponry.

195
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,900
I'm close to a breakthrough.
I can feel it.

196
00:24:48,935 --> 00:24:51,652
The key must be the other Dragonballs.
I have to have them all.

197
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:54,849
What good is the other Dragonballs gonna do you?
- They're gonna make me famous.

198
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:57,538
I'm gonna make them an unlimited
source of energy.

199
00:24:57,573 --> 00:24:59,833
Good luck with that.

200
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:05,952
I'm Goku.

201
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:08,924
Maybe we could help eachother seek.

202
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:11,866
I need to find a Master Roshi
in Pausu

203
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,938
If you take me there, I'll help
you find the Dragonballs.

204
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:15,960
If I have the D.B.E.,
why would I need you?

205
00:25:15,995 --> 00:25:19,087
Obviously someone else is looking
for them.

206
00:25:19,122 --> 00:25:22,797
And you, you might need backup.

207
00:25:28,782 --> 00:25:30,198
Bulma Briefs.

208
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:39,295
Where is your?...

209
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:43,946
A Ride?

210
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:47,808
Cool.

211
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:11,393
Directory information downloaded.

212
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:15,001
I have tried every possible spelling
of "Roshi" in the directory.

213
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:17,599
He's not listed.
- Did you try "Master"?

214
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:22,934
M-A-S...
- Idiot.

215
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:24,765
You sure you don't want one?

216
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:31,801
He is here.

217
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:33,395
How do you know?

218
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,765
I can always sense my Grandfather.

219
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:44,187
I know he's gone now, but I'm
getting the same feeling.

220
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:49,873
There's another Dragonball here.
Let's go.

221
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:05,321
Bulma, wait.

222
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:12,635
Bulma, wait. You can't just break
into someones house.

223
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,141
We're not breaking in,
the door's unlocked.

224
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,730
Alright, this girl's out of control.

225
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,481
Thief.

226
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:13,780
This is not what you...

227
00:28:21,294 --> 00:28:23,843
This is not happening.
- Leave it, Punk.

228
00:28:23,878 --> 00:28:27,270
Your getting your clock, thief.

229
00:28:50,873 --> 00:28:52,463
You've been trained well.

230
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,932
Stop. You both have to stop.

231
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:09,752
Now I'm going to end it.

232
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,787
Sorry.

233
00:29:22,822 --> 00:29:25,361
Shallow Crane Strike.

234
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,013
I'd recognize that anywhere.

235
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:30,760
How is Gohan?

236
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:33,977
You knew my Grandfather?
- Knew him?

237
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:35,791
I trained him.

238
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,660
You are Master Roshi.
- I am Muten Roshi!.

239
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:45,027
The invincible!.

240
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:49,938
My Grandfather is dead.

241
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:55,865
He was murdered. I will avenge him.

242
00:29:56,963 --> 00:30:00,336
But before he died, he...

243
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:04,128
asked me to find you, and to
tell you that...

244
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:07,743
Piccolo has returned. He said that
you would know what to do.

245
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:10,203
He also told me a poem.

246
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:15,370
It was "Seven Dragonballs".
- "Seven Dragonball"...

247
00:30:15,405 --> 00:30:19,480
Must be found, for all
Man's fate...

248
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:21,397
Will be bound...

249
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:24,805
To battle forces of Death
and Fear.

250
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,651
And compell Shenlong to appear.

251
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:33,286
It was a nursery rhyme. Told to us
by ancient Masters.

252
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:37,126
Then you probably know that we have to
find the Dragonballs before the Eclipse.

253
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:41,313
Eclipse.
- Do you have a Dragonball?

254
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,025
Bikini Quarterly?

255
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:54,265
That is a collectors edition.

256
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:41,309
If the prophecy's true...

257
00:31:41,344 --> 00:31:47,123
In seven days the sun will be
eclipsed by the blood moon.

258
00:31:47,158 --> 00:31:49,684
That will be the beginning of the Apocalypse.

259
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:52,312
Roshi don't be crazy.
You said it yourself.

260
00:31:52,347 --> 00:31:55,575
It's a nursery rhyme.
- Yes, because before tonight...

261
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:59,249
I could make no sense of it.
But finally...

262
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:03,727
I can see. You are the key,
Somehow.

263
00:32:03,762 --> 00:32:06,457
Gohan knew it.
That's why he trained you.

264
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:09,678
Okay, Goku, this has been great.
You've found your Master Roshi...

265
00:32:09,713 --> 00:32:12,262
I kept my part of the bargain,
now it's time you keep yours.

266
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,563
Let's go.
- If what Gohan said is true...

267
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:16,056
and Piccolo is here...

268
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:21,330
this wish is maybe the only
thing that can save our world.

269
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:23,667
We'll go.

270
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,327
But we go together.

271
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:15,319
I will take you to a
secret place.

272
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:18,932
Where a .... was tought how
to master the energy of the three elements.

273
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,318
Air, fire and water.

274
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:24,945
Shallow Crane Strike is the most
basic of all the air bending tecniques.

275
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,918
To learn what I have to teach you,
You have to get stronger.

276
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,773
You wanted him. Although, I am
beginning to appreciate the entertainment value.

277
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:35,749
Alright.

278
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:41,733
Leave your hand there another second,
and you gonna lose it.

279
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:43,302
Let's go.

280
00:34:11,837 --> 00:34:15,895
The Stone temple has been a source of
solitude and enlightenment for millenia.

281
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:19,927
Here, you will learn what I learned from
the ancient masters.

282
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:26,235
I thought you said this place
is secret?

283
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:43,901
Hey, Goku. What are you doing here?

284
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:45,303
I was just about to ask you the
same thing.

285
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:49,985
Walk with me?
- Yeah.

286
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,367
This is where everyone comes to train
for the big tournament in Toi San.

287
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:56,627
That's what I wanted to tell you
at the party.

288
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:57,983
Before you suddenly took off.

289
00:34:58,018 --> 00:35:00,771
I heard about your Grandfather's
accident.

290
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:02,515
I'm so sorry.

291
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,477
The house collapsed?

292
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:08,060
Yeah, something like that.

293
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:11,088
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

294
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,723
Nobody at home knows this but...
I'm a fighter too.

295
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:18,515
They just wouldn't understand.

296
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,456
Goku, let's go.

297
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:25,747
I gotta go.

298
00:35:27,152 --> 00:35:28,603
Come to the tournament in Toi San.

299
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,774
Maybe we could find sometime to
mix it up.

300
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:40,192
We can't train here.
My Ki is shiveling up.

301
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:44,659
Atleast this won't be a total waste.
I have a signal on a Dragonball.

302
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:45,634
Let's go.

303
00:35:56,444 --> 00:35:57,609
Go! One hand.

304
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:01,612
Master the second level of air bending...

305
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:03,524
You have the control to fix a ....

306
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,037
Knock this orange off my hand.

307
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,722
I'm getting a strong signal on a Dragonball,
only three miles ahead.

308
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:37,966
Sorry.

309
00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:42,266
What happened?
That hole came out of nowhere.

310
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:49,365
Need any help down there?

311
00:36:50,414 --> 00:36:52,024
Let me handle this.

312
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:55,890
You are such a lifesaver.

313
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,184
We are just stuck down here.

314
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:02,541
I'd be so greatful, if you could just
help me and my friends out...

315
00:37:05,414 --> 00:37:08,250
For a pretty thing like you,
no problemo.

316
00:37:08,285 --> 00:37:09,870
Thank you.

317
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:13,876
You're a real gentleman.
- Yamcha, at your service.

318
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:17,253
I'm gonna need some payment.
- Payment.

319
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:20,427
Who do you think made this trap?

320
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:24,976
Wait a minute, is that a
Capsel RX 550 Roadsricy downthere?

321
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:26,495
I'll take that!.

322
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,703
You're nothing but a lowlife bandit.

323
00:37:28,738 --> 00:37:31,069
Yeah, except one with a ladder.

324
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:35,290
Think it over. Cause when the,
sun comes up, it's gonna be hot, hot, hot.

325
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,838
Now all we need now are marshmallows
and a ghost story.

326
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:49,498
We have no marshmallows.

327
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,192
But I do have a story.

328
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,389
2000 years ago the earth was
nearly destroyed.

329
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:57,925
Not by men, but by gods
from the sky.

330
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,836
Their names were Piccolo and Oozaru.

331
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:11,372
Seven mystics gathered to fight
the invaders.

332
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:15,754
They sacrificed their lives to
cast the Mafuba,

333
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:18,784
a powerful curse that
imprisoned Piccolo.

334
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,503
Now, Piccolo has somehow escaped.

335
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:27,697
In two days the blood moon
will eclipse the sun.

336
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:29,626
And bring fourth Oozaru,
his dicipel.

337
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,501
To stop Piccolo,

338
00:38:33,536 --> 00:38:35,976
Who ever can find all seven Dragonballs...

339
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:38,336
can ressurect the power of Shenlong.

340
00:38:38,371 --> 00:38:40,620
And be granted one perfect wish.

341
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:45,194
Unless we find the Dragonballs..

342
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:48,517
and use our wish to banish Piccolo
from this world...

343
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:51,668
We will have no defence against the unslaught.

344
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:55,618
What a crock!
You expect me to believe that?

345
00:38:55,653 --> 00:39:00,264
I do not, I think you are the
kind of person who does not believe in anything.

346
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,916
I feel sorry for you!
- Yeah, whatever.

347
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:06,672
I'm not the one who's stuck in a hole.
- Let us out, now!

348
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:12,689
Wow there, jumping bee.
One more outburst like that, and I'm out of here.

349
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,470
The Dragonball is close!

350
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:20,254
I think it's buried under ground.

351
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:26,624
Enough games!
We have no time to waste.

352
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:27,942
Send down a net.

353
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:31,927
We gonna need some tools to excavate.

354
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:38,310
How would you like to make more money than
you ever dreamed of?

355
00:39:38,345 --> 00:39:39,984
Now you're talking, bro!

356
00:39:43,476 --> 00:39:46,540
If that tv-thing is right, what you're looking
is right here!

357
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:48,340
Let's go, come on!.

358
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:55,848
You have no right to give away
assertive royalties from my invention..

359
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:57,990
One day Dragonballs will
power the world.

360
00:39:58,025 --> 00:40:00,805
A fellow zero...

361
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,295
is still zero.

362
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,912
I guess if you hadn't hocked us
we wouldn't be able to get this Dragonball.

363
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:21,734
Everything happens for a reason, bro!

364
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:25,861
Got that one from daytime TV.

365
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:40,300
The Dragonball is close.

366
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:43,748
Be on your guard, Piccolo
is after the Dragonball.

367
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:48,907
I followed Master Roshi,
as directed.

368
00:40:48,942 --> 00:40:51,746
He's training the boy,
Sangoku.

369
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:54,962
I could disrupt them!

370
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:01,960
No, this will require more
than disruption.

371
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:10,521
Your blood will give it life.

372
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:28,792
The dragonballs are within
my grasp...

373
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:34,278
and with them, the power to destroy
this world.

374
00:41:43,124 --> 00:41:44,874
After we get the seven
Dragonballs...

375
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:47,122
how soon can I expect some profit?

376
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:50,966
A month, a year?

377
00:41:53,616 --> 00:41:56,578
High temperatures are screwing with
the signal, I can't get a good signal on it.

378
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:11,846
East an right,
I just fried my nuts!

379
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,705
But I see it!

380
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:19,937
The problem is, how to get across.

381
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,017
Goku, watch out!

382
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,161
Go!

383
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:59,466
Into the lava, that's the only
way to stop them.

384
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:16,670
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm making a fridge.

385
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:32,214
Impressive.

386
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:22,392
The power to prevent this
is inside you!

387
00:44:45,128 --> 00:44:48,636
Master Roshi!
The Dragonballs...

388
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:51,577
They've been speaking to you?
- Yeah.

389
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:53,324
They are showing you your future.

390
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,522
There's this Deamon...
- Oozaru, the destroyer.

391
00:44:57,557 --> 00:45:03,004
He will kill you, and Bulma...

392
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,484
And Yamcha, he will destroy everything.

393
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:11,048
The future is always changing.

394
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,584
Let the dragon show you these lessons.

395
00:45:16,878 --> 00:45:20,510
I need to somehow defeat
Oozaru.

396
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,732
The eclips is in 2 days, we'll
never find the other Dragonballs in time.

397
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,110
There is another way to stop Piccolo...

398
00:45:38,145 --> 00:45:41,347
The only chance the
world has now...

399
00:45:41,382 --> 00:45:44,972
is in Toi San.

400
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:47,608
Toi San.

401
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:22,664
Roshi...

402
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:25,174
How is my favorite sceptic?.

403
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:29,928
I come to apoligize,
Sifu Norris.

404
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:32,682
Everything that I questioned before...

405
00:46:32,717 --> 00:46:39,148
I now know, is all true.

406
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:42,385
The prophecy.

407
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,792
The bloodmoon will eclipse
the sun tomorrow.

408
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:52,372
I need your help.

409
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:54,321
I need another containment vessel.

410
00:46:54,217 --> 00:46:59,776
The Mafuba?
That will consume all of your lifeforces.

411
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,694
When you put it that way,
the plan sucks.

412
00:47:02,729 --> 00:47:06,025
But the boy will not be ready.

413
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,810
It's the only way...

414
00:47:09,651 --> 00:47:11,698
I'm the only one who can do it.

415
00:47:15,347 --> 00:47:17,806
We will have it ready by the morning.

416
00:47:19,494 --> 00:47:20,927
Nameste.

417
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:49,065
Why visit a tournament, when we're
not gonna fight?

418
00:48:02,752 --> 00:48:06,114
You made it.
- Yeah, what's this?

419
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:09,032
You okay?
- Yeah, it's nothing.

420
00:48:08,914 --> 00:48:11,629
Are you in the tournament?
- No, I'm here for something else.

421
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:14,209
Something more important than me?

422
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:18,692
Your one of the reasons why it's so
important.

423
00:48:21,304 --> 00:48:22,737
I've got a confession to make.

424
00:48:22,772 --> 00:48:26,077
I wanted to be famous.
- I wanted to be rich.

425
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:29,063
Neither of us are gonna get
what we want.

426
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:35,730
Look at these people.

427
00:48:35,765 --> 00:48:37,177
They have no idea.

428
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:40,365
Yeah, I wish I didn't know myself.

429
00:48:43,278 --> 00:48:45,236
Never thought I could enjoy
talking to a thief.

430
00:48:47,376 --> 00:48:51,185
You know, I'm not so bad once you
get to know me.

431
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,633
Maybe I like bad men.

432
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,010
That's good to know on the
day before the end of the world.

433
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:13,286
We still have our Dragonballs.

434
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:16,884
That's right. Piccolo needs all seven.

435
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:17,990
He still can't make his wish either.

436
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:20,340
That means you can still make your 30 percent.

437
00:49:21,864 --> 00:49:22,649
33 and a third.

438
00:49:22,556 --> 00:49:24,506
Don't push it.

439
00:49:52,381 --> 00:49:54,623
The final level on
air bending tecnique...

440
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,615
is the 'Kamehameha'.

441
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,488
Yeah, my Grandpa told
me about that but...

442
00:49:59,523 --> 00:50:00,602
He said I wasn't ready to learn it yet.

443
00:50:00,995 --> 00:50:05,172
You are not.
But time is running out.

444
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,705
To master the 'Kamehameha'...

445
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,829
you have to master your Ki.

446
00:50:10,864 --> 00:50:13,480
Draw the power of the universe.

447
00:50:24,419 --> 00:50:25,799
Channel it through you.

448
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:46,556
Focus it.

449
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:49,251
What?

450
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:54,362
The more you put yourself
into the 'Kamehameha'...

451
00:50:54,397 --> 00:50:57,006
The greater the power.
Practice...

452
00:50:57,041 --> 00:51:00,605
Light the torches in the courtyard.
I will see you in the morning.

453
00:51:51,164 --> 00:51:53,248
Have you been watching me?

454
00:51:54,965 --> 00:51:57,178
Then I guess you know why
I have to cheat.

455
00:52:02,084 --> 00:52:06,413
My Grandpa always said,
In order to master my Ki...

456
00:52:06,448 --> 00:52:09,021
I have to be at one with myself...

457
00:52:09,056 --> 00:52:11,007
and with my inner me.

458
00:52:11,971 --> 00:52:13,409
I still don't know what
that means.

459
00:52:13,444 --> 00:52:15,710
Maybe you need an insentive.

460
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:20,824
There are five unlit torches
in this court yard.

461
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:23,286
You're five paces away from me.

462
00:52:23,321 --> 00:52:25,290
Everytime you light a torch...

463
00:52:25,325 --> 00:52:28,677
You get to take one step closer to me.

464
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,705
What happens after I light all five
torches?

465
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:35,630
Then you'll be standing right next to me.

466
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:38,399
Where I can reach you.

467
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:41,589
You're on.

468
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:48,433
Very impressive.

469
00:52:49,828 --> 00:52:52,777
Yeah.

470
00:52:58,534 --> 00:53:00,254
Not bad.

471
00:53:06,704 --> 00:53:08,582
Alright.

472
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:23,134
Take one step back.
- That wasn't the rules.

473
00:53:23,028 --> 00:53:25,293
My game, my rules.

474
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:33,127
Three more, concentrate.

475
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:40,148
It doesn't feel right,
I must be missing something.

476
00:53:40,043 --> 00:53:42,077
You have to make every
move your own.

477
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:46,319
You can do this.

478
00:54:05,228 --> 00:54:10,520
I think, the next move it would
be better to blow out all the torches.

479
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:02,802
Stop right there!

480
00:55:07,935 --> 00:55:09,457
Chi-chi?

481
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:13,044
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to wake anyone.

482
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:17,725
No, I'm sorry.
Go back to what you were doing.

483
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:20,491
No, I was just leaving.

484
00:55:22,515 --> 00:55:25,503
What are you guys doing out here?
- Nothing.

485
00:55:28,646 --> 00:55:30,789
Isn't there a curvue in this temple?

486
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:32,406
Goodnight.

487
00:55:35,594 --> 00:55:38,733
I didn't think Goku had it in him.
- It's always the quiet ones.

488
00:55:40,698 --> 00:55:42,372
Hey, you guys are up late.

489
00:55:42,893 --> 00:55:44,312
Where you in your room?

490
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:47,679
She's got the Dragonballs.

491
00:56:05,622 --> 00:56:07,331
Who the hell are you?

492
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:19,957
We'll find another way.

493
00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:27,973
Chi-chi?

494
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:49,673
Help me, Goku.

495
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,509
Goku, stop.

496
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:01,328
Oh, shit...
- Wrong one.

497
00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:23,474
You okay?

498
00:57:25,205 --> 00:57:27,805
He's alive,
but barely.

499
00:57:53,445 --> 00:57:55,043
Grandpa!

500
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:57,022
I'm so happy to see you.

501
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,759
Wait, are you here for me?

502
00:58:04,644 --> 00:58:08,693
It's not your time, Goku.
There's much left to do.

503
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:15,648
Grandpa, how do I defeat Oozaru?

504
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:20,519
Always have faith in who you are.

505
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,380
Faith is good.

506
00:58:43,175 --> 00:58:47,079
We're too late.
They have all seven.

507
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:48,886
Dragon Temple?

508
00:58:49,438 --> 00:58:52,676
That's where he will ressurect Shenlong.

509
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,574
The enchantments are strong.

510
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:12,146
Pray it is enough to contain Piccolo.

511
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:14,805
Good luck, my friend.

512
00:59:14,729 --> 00:59:16,220
Namaste.

513
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:27,569
We will meet again...

514
00:59:27,504 --> 00:59:30,006
On the other side.

515
00:59:38,952 --> 00:59:41,020
Where am I going?
- Dragon Temple.

516
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,149
We have to get there
before the eclipse.

517
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:49,133
Imagine, being shackled
so tightly.

518
00:59:49,564 --> 00:59:53,792
That every atom in your
body, stood compacted.

519
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,539
Still...

520
00:59:59,642 --> 01:00:05,242
That was my hell...
for 2000 years.

521
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,961
With this Dragonball...

522
01:00:11,857 --> 01:00:16,505
I take my vengance.

523
01:00:46,192 --> 01:00:48,609
Let's go!

524
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:53,335
You made an impression.
-...

525
01:01:08,722 --> 01:01:11,533
I have to stop him before he
finishes the prayer.

526
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,154
I'm loosing her.

527
01:02:28,775 --> 01:02:32,689
I'm glad to have you join me.
You will bare witness to my glory...

528
01:02:32,632 --> 01:02:37,121
when I prepell Shenlong to grant me the power
to rule over this diseased rock.

529
01:02:36,946 --> 01:02:41,431
I will defeat Oozaru, and I am here
to destroy you.

530
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,174
Defeat Oozaru?

531
01:02:45,157 --> 01:02:47,648
When the blood moon eclipses
the sun...

532
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:51,646
You will become Oozaru.
- What?

533
01:02:51,973 --> 01:02:54,415
No.
- There is no denyal.

534
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:58,597
Goku's time is over.

535
01:03:06,955 --> 01:03:08,731
No!

536
01:03:08,908 --> 01:03:11,480
Goku is a shell.

537
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:14,746
This is who you are.

538
01:03:17,337 --> 01:03:21,905
You travelled by meteor,
to hide among the vermin until your 18th birthday.

539
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:25,692
This is where you landed.
And were you will be reborn.

540
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:29,991
You slave me!

541
01:03:35,282 --> 01:03:38,197
Goku, no!
- I don't think he's there anymore.

542
01:03:46,037 --> 01:03:49,410
They have a Dragonball.
Bring it to me.

543
01:04:11,428 --> 01:04:13,448
What?

544
01:04:13,993 --> 01:04:15,262
Go

545
01:04:21,017 --> 01:04:22,668
No.
- Go!

546
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,138
Let me help you.

547
01:04:54,894 --> 01:04:57,284
To late.

548
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:04,537
Protect the Dragonball.

549
01:05:12,463 --> 01:05:17,485
Oozaru can be beat
with this.

550
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:21,939
Only with faith can you win.

551
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:30,613
Don't let Oozaru destroy the
Goku in you.

552
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,941
Always have faith.

553
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,815
No!

554
01:05:59,172 --> 01:06:01,516
You have to make every move your own.

555
01:06:01,426 --> 01:06:02,827
Your special, Goku.

556
01:06:09,873 --> 01:06:13,847
Impossible.
- Something my Grandfather taught me.

557
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:17,683
First rule is:
There are no rules.

558
01:07:16,552 --> 01:07:17,865
Wait.

559
01:07:20,895 --> 01:07:22,775
Take it.

560
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,896
The Dragonball is mine.

561
01:07:49,706 --> 01:07:53,514
I totally had that under controle.

562
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,614
I am Goku.

563
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:08,820
I am Oozaru.

564
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:12,372
To be at one with myself,
I must be two.

565
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:30,170
I must have faith in who I am.

566
01:08:35,636 --> 01:08:37,488
Human power...

567
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:39,970
Has failed before.

568
01:09:38,012 --> 01:09:40,765
I wish it didn't have to end
this way.

569
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:59,019
One wish will be granted.

570
01:10:04,812 --> 01:10:07,102
Dragon!

571
01:10:07,013 --> 01:10:11,042
The test of seven has been fulfilled!

572
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:14,983
I compell you to come fourth and
grant my wish.

573
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:44,262
Give life to Mutar Moshi.

574
01:11:15,643 --> 01:11:17,948
I had the strangest dream.

575
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,756
I was in a place,
I can't describe.

576
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,134
I felt contempt.

577
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:25,141
I belonged,
I was happy.

578
01:11:26,631 --> 01:11:29,951
Then Grandfather Gohan came
to me and kicked me out.

579
01:11:29,822 --> 01:11:32,650
There was a lot you still
needed to learn.

580
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:36,139
He was right. I'm sorry,
we just weren't ready to have you leave us.

581
01:11:37,805 --> 01:11:40,001
I know.

582
01:11:40,303 --> 01:11:42,987
I know.
- That sweet, ladies, but...

583
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:45,734
Notice were missing something here?.
- The Dragonballs are gone.

584
01:11:45,623 --> 01:11:47,526
We have to find them again.

585
01:11:48,323 --> 01:11:49,757
You ready?

586
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,248
I just have to do one thing.

587
01:12:31,838 --> 01:12:34,822
I didn't think I was gonna see you again.
- I'm sorry.

588
01:12:34,706 --> 01:12:38,449
I'm so sorry that I hurt you
I would never do that on purpose...

589
01:12:38,304 --> 01:12:40,223
I was in the heat of the battle...

590
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:42,408
I thought you were someone else.
- It's alright.

591
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:44,367
I let you hit me.

592
01:12:44,885 --> 01:12:48,373
I was just too fast.
- You were fast, but I let you hit me.

593
01:12:48,237 --> 01:12:52,156
It was dark and confusing,
I wasn't holding back.

594
01:12:52,004 --> 01:12:56,216
If our realtionship is gonna
go anywhere, we're gonna have to settle this.

595
01:13:14,635 --> 01:16:17,992
Another sub from Bentover87...
Synced and translated by the man himself.
Hope you enjoyed it!
