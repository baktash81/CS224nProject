1
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,727
-Oh! How'd that happen?
-Mon Dieu, Elliot!

2
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:52,061
What 'di'd you 'do?
Look at the mess youve ma'de!

3
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:54,657
-I 'di'dnt knock it over!
-It happene'd just like magic?

4
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:56,726
-Dont be a pain.
-Im going to tell.

5
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:57,896
I 'di'dnt spill it.

6
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:01,430
-Naughty boy.
-Leave me alone! lm acci'dent-prone.

7
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,900
-Behave yourself.
-Let go! Stop it!

8
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:07,607
lm telling your mama an'd papa.
You are very naughty.

9
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,705
Stop it.

10
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:13,485
How many times have I tol'd you
not to come in the kitchen?

11
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:17,388
How many times have I tol'd you?
One million times!

12
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:27,033
Testing. Lets begin.

13
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:31,660
Hello, Elliot. Ive known you for a long
time, always consi'dere'd you a frien'd...

14
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,138
...an'd I a'dmire your work.

15
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:34,697
Thank you, Martin.

16
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:41,244
I always have trouble saying your name,
because Australians have 'difficulty...

17
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:45,809
...with the American R.
It woul'd be easier if your name was Bob.

18
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:49,581
-This is a serious interview.
-Im sorry.

19
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:51,055
Im just a little anxious.

20
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:54,820
Youve achieve'd a great 'deal of success
in your creative an'd artistic fiel'd.

21
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:56,590
Youve travele'd a great 'deal.

22
00:01:56,663 --> 00:02:00,656
You have influential frien'ds. Youve 'date'd
a bevy of bright an'd beautiful women.

23
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,998
Yet youve never ha'd a lasting relationship.

24
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:06,072
I never seem to get it right.

25
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:09,434
Im a simple girl.
I 'dont nee'd to 'do all these far-out things...

26
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,410
...with somebo'dy whos never aroun'd.

27
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:14,311
Does this mean were not
gonna have breakfast? Thank you.

28
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:15,539
Get out!

29
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:18,312
You came close to getting married once,
quite close.

30
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:19,784
Yeah, Kathleen.

31
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:26,582
It started out all right. Sunny day, lovely
flowers, nice crowd. Everyone was there.

32
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:29,822
Except the bride.

33
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:31,531
That was a 'difficult 'day.

34
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:33,759
Thats when you calle'd me
about the islan'd?

35
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:37,827
-Yeah, I was hoping you coul'd help me.
-lf youre selecte'd, when can you leave?

36
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:41,272
I have an assignment in South America
for a month, an'd then lm free.

37
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,866
Why 'do you think your relationships
'do not work out?

38
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:57,419
lm not always honest with myself
about what I want.

39
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:45,295
We'll be landing at Los Angeles
International Airport momentarily...

40
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:47,873
...where the local time is 4:05 a.m.

41
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:52,235
We've enjoyed serving you on Flight 241,
and if your future travel plans...

42
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:56,749
...take you to South America, we hope
you will once again choose Aero Brazil.

43
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:59,752
US citizens, over here. Aliens, over there.

44
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:03,614

45
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,056
-Hey, Tony.

49
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,193
Thank you. Next?

50
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,077
Hello, Ai'dan, this is Dr. Rubino.

51
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:31,584
Hi, mom. Yeah, lm safe. We just lan'de'd.

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,363

53
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,604
I really gotta go. Bye.

54
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:08,448
Dont you hate getting in this late?
My eyes get so 'dry when I fly.

55
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,988
Hol'd it. Youre the guy with the turban!

56
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,941
Okay, Martin, thank you.

57
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:42,221
Passenger Joel Stearns, please pick up
the nearest white courtesy phone.

58
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:47,185
Passengers arriving
on Aero Brazil Flight 241...

59
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:50,296
...may claim their baggage at Carousel 2.

60
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:07,039
Are you crazy?
Taking a picture of me blowing my nose?

61
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:08,240
Woul'd you stop it?

62
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:12,809
Okay. Im a professional.
Call me, well 'do a sitting sometime.

63
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:13,978
Yeah.

64
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,752
Your bags moving.

65
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:23,189
Want me to get that? III get it for you.

66
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:26,894
No, leave it alone. Leave it.

67
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:32,764
Excuse me, sir.

68
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,574
Going to unloa'd your own luggage?

69
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,714
This la'dy acci'dentally lost her bag.

70
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:43,909
I wasnt watching where I put my bag.

71
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:47,283
Its all right. It will come aroun'd.
Here it is.

72
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,878
Sorry to cause you so much trouble.

73
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:55,052
We cant be responsible for your hea'd
if you stick it in the baggage hole.

74
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:56,322
Ill remember that.

75
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,458
Look, I 'dont know
if something was going 'down or not.

76
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,091
Please open all of your bags.

77
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:04,399
They may just be smuggling
a bottle of vo'dka for all I know.

78
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,162
I got photos of both of them.

79
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,868
I nee'd some stuff on this roll,
but if you wanna see them, heres my car'd.

80
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,407
We have to 'do a full check on everybo'dy.

81
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,913
-Ill remember that.
-Nice job.

82
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:17,005
You stay out of trouble.

83
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:18,415
Smuggling.

84
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:25,286
Hello, my little frien'ds.

85
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:30,189
The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.

86
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:31,729
No parking.

87
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:41,797
Di'd you have any trouble in there?

88
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,639
Absolutely not. Im a professional.

89
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:46,641
Yes, a professional.

90
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:28,679
Good morning,
and welcome to LA's premier XXX club...

91
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:29,779
...The Feather.

92
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,586
When the sun comes up,
the bras come down.

93
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:38,729
It is dark and time for our sunrise special.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

94
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,465
Give it up.

95
00:08:58,318 --> 00:08:59,910
Look what I got!

96
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:10,518
Now.

97
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:32,481
We think youll fin'd this will help
Mr. Walker breathe a lot better.

98
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:16,126
-Wait here.
-All right.

99
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,475
-Mr. Walker, everything checks out fine.
-Goo'd.

100
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:50,488
LAPD!

101
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:51,686
Freeze!

102
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,528
-Is this a rai'd?
-Im 21, I swear.

103
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,295
-Get out of the way.
-All of you.

104
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:56,801
-Get 'down!
-Come here!

105
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,667
-On the floor!
-Watch it, bu'd'dy.

106
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:01,434
Get with the program!
The floor! On the floor!

107
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:03,066
You! Get with the program!

108
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:05,475
Out of my way! Kill them!

109
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,773
Sprea'd em. Youve never been
in trouble with the police before?

110
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:12,249
-I havent. Im clean.
-Yeah, youre clean. Miran'da.

111
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:14,549
If you woul'd 'do the honors,
Detective Kingston.

112
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:15,610
My pleasure.

113
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:18,351
Where are you going? Sit 'down!
You are sitting 'down!

114
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:20,359
You sit 'down, unless youre crawling.

115
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:22,793
Fre'd, my feet are killin me in these shoes.

116
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,466
Welcome to King Solomons mine.

117
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:30,098
Go'd, lm goo'd.

118
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:32,260
Get 'down!

119
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,208
Check, please.

120
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,869
Ill go!

121
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,948
Hi. I'm Sheila Kingston, and I'm a cop.

122
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:51,490
Thought I was a supermodel?

123
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:54,584
Don't feel bad.
Everyone makes that mistake.

124
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:58,291
Damn it, they got away. I hate that.

125
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:03,797
That's my partner, Detective Fred Lavery.
June 13, that's the date.

126
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,498
It was the beginning
of the wildest case of my career.

127
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:09,201
Let me tell you,
my love life has never been the same.

128
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,641
And your love life may never be
the same either.

129
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:14,077
Here we go. Case No. 1 1725.

130
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,115
The FBI and the US Customs Bureau
had been trying to break...

131
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:20,983
...a South American diamond-smuggling
ring for about two years without success.

132
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:22,453
That's where we came in.

133
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:26,891
And our backup finally arrived. Late.
Must have been a line at Dunkin' Donuts.

134
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,428
We got the diamonds.
The bad guys got away.

135
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:32,329
All we knew, one of them had a bad cold.

136
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:37,233
You missed Walker. How could you miss
a man in a wheelchair?

137
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:39,737
Things 'di'dnt go that well
at the airport either.

138
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,903
-Really?
-A man took your picture.

139
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,068
Took my picture?

140
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,884
...it's a detour, and people act out...

141
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:58,389
Ill be two minutes, pal.

142
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,417
...early childhood humiliations
in order to get rid of them.

143
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:07,395
It's been estimated that about a third of all
couples have tried spanking each other.

144
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,165
About a third have tried
tying each other up.

145
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:13,998
The woman in the pain profession,
the dominatrix...

146
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:16,338
...considers it an ideal profession.

147
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:20,038
She can sleep in late.
She can wear interesting clothes.

148
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:23,173
She can push men around.
And with her whips and handcuffs...

149
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,774
...she actually makes
more money per hour than I do.

150
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:29,913
And she can also charge it
on Visa or MasterCard. It's sometimes--

151
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:32,923
Here we are.

152
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,222
Thats him.

153
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:41,429
-Looks like hes taking another trip.
-Yeah, with his camera.

154
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,900
Shall I grab him?

155
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:45,961
Not yet. It 'doesnt mean that
the 'damn film is in the camera.

156
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,270
All right. You go search the house.
Im gonna follow the cab. Go!

157
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,558
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

158
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:27,869
An hour later, Elliot Slater boarded a ship
at Los Angeles Harbor, Pier 56.

159
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:31,208
We assumed he was going
on another photo assignment. He wasn't.

160
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:35,083
He didn't know what was ahead of him
or who was behind him.

161
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:01,341
Whoa, Doctor. No more bloo'd samples.

162
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:04,007
No, I came to tell you
that you passe'd your physical.

163
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,682
You are HIV-negative
an'd all your bo'dy parts...

164
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:08,414
...that shoul'd be working, work.

165
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:11,321
Thats great, but you 'di'dnt try them all.

166
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:16,159
I 'di'd forget one.
I always save that for last.

167
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,223
Drop your pants.

168
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,166
-I 'dont even know your first name.
-Doctor.

169
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:29,032
Turn your hea'd an'd cough. Again.

170
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,909
I cant believe lm 'doing this.

171
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:34,310
I bet youve been 'doing this
since you were 13.

172
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,008
No, I mean being here on this ship.

173
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,016
Follow the rules, an'd youll 'do fine.
From here on out, we only ask one thing.

174
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:42,145
What?

175
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:45,453
We'd like you to refrain from
any private sexual stimulations.

176
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:50,126
We want you to perform up to
your own expectations once you arrive.

177
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,902
Just finishing a roll.

178
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,671
Goo'd luck.

179
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:16,788
-Are you positive?
-I think so.

180
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,256
-Think so is not positive.
-Im pretty sure.

181
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,793
Pretty sure is not positive.
We nee'd positive.

182
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:26,264
-Does this help?
-Yes. Thats her. She went for my throat.

183
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:28,095
-Im positive.
-Thank you, Susan.

184
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,657
You can now go back to work.

185
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:33,103
In the event of a water lan'ding,
there are six exits on this plane.

186
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:34,730
I coul'dve been a stewar'dess.

187
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:37,367
Lets put this on the wire,
Nina an'd all her aliases.

188
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:40,844
Im not gonna put an APB out on a person
with magic marker on her face.

189
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:42,006
Its a re'd 'dot.

190
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:43,480
-In my office.
-Yes, sir.

191
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:46,643
-I got an ID on Nina.
-I got the same from the airport security.

192
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:50,120
-He sai'd she was a beauty queen.
-Shes a psychotic who kills people...

193
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,987
-...an'd injures the han'dicappe'd.
-Han'dicappe'd criminals.

194
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:57,086
Folks, please, lm late for a meeting,
if you 'dont min'd. Come on.

195
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:00,326
So Walker talke'd.
Sai'd that Nina was partners with Omar.

196
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,528
-What 'do you got on Omar, Mr. Filofax?
-Okay, at your service.

197
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:05,662
Omar, precious gem smugglers
pinup boy.

198
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:08,866
Wante'd for mur'dering two
Hasi'dic 'diamon'd merchants in Rotter'dam.

199
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:11,809
No known aliases or physical 'description.
No known photos.

200
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:15,871
-Ill take Obscure Criminals for $500.
-Except there now is a photograph...

201
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,282
-...but we are not in possession of it.
-Where 'does that leave us?

202
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,013
-My 'de'duction?
-Please.

203
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,851
We can assume that Nina tol'd Omar
this photographer...

204
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:26,585
...took the only photos of Omar
in the mo'dern worl'd.

205
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:31,289
Omar is going to want to get his han'ds
on this photographer, Slater, pretty ba'd.

206
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:35,824
Lieutenant, if we can get to Slater
an'd his camera before they 'do...

207
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:38,837
...we can set a trap,
an'd they will walk right into our arms.

208
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:40,930
Works for me. Lieutenant?

209
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:44,098
-Go'd, lm...
-Dont say it.

210
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:45,968
-...goo'd.
-He sai'd it.

211
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,946
Okay, thats it. Fre'ds right.
Thats your next assignment.

212
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:51,279
-Di'd you trace Slaters ship?
-It wasnt easy.

213
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:56,414
But we know its going
to an islan'd resort, a club.

214
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:01,522
-Club Me'd?
-Well, its not your usual resort.

215
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:06,388
Its a place for S&M, B&D, an'd D&S.

216
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,026
M&M?

217
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:13,128
They have a Club Me'd for sex orgies?

218
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:17,868
Maybe this will help you out. Heres some
bon'dage magazines to stu'dy up on.

219
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:22,138
Tomorrow, you will be meeting with
Dr. Martin Halifax, the islan'ds owner.

220
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:24,080
He will set you up to go un'dercover.

221
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,811
-Thats what we 'do.
-Yes, we 'do.

222
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:28,820
This is now over. Get out of my office.
Im late for supper.

223
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:31,516
-Thanks, boss.
-Goo'd night, Lieutenant.

224
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:33,782
Lets go, Fre'd.

225
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,860
I ate four green ones. I 'dont feel anything.

226
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,557
Wait one hour.

227
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,964
This is just so gross.

228
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:47,166
Come on. Welcome to the 90s.
Its just an alternative lifestyle.

229
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,708
An alternative lifestyle.
Do you know what that is?

230
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:52,506
A phrase 'deviants use
to cover up their sex lives.

231
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:56,139
Maybe if you'd spice'd up your
sex life a little, you woul'dnt be 'divorce'd.

232
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:59,582
What? I spice'd it up plenty.
Many a time, I let the wife get on top.

233
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:01,745
On top? It just boggles the min'd.

234
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,052
-I was joking.
-I figure'd.

235
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:06,182
Ill get the file on Nina. Do whatever.

236
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:08,454
Catch you later. I gotta get a bikini wax.

237
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:10,996
Stop telling me about that
'disgusting female stuff.

238
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:14,500
-No won'der you were never marrie'd.
-I have PMS, too. Do you know that?

239
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:18,025
Sometimes I bloat, weight gain,
temporary water buil'dup.

240
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:22,200
I hate to tell you this. I clot.
Heavy flow 'days.

241
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,625
Welcome. Im Senior Trainer Richar'd.

242
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:45,858
-Hi, Richar'd.
-Theres no talking, Riba.

243
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,293
Dr. Williams will be aroun'd
to collect your release forms.

244
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:53,202
While shes 'doing that,
please take off your clothing.

245
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,668
You will spen'd one week at E'den.

246
00:19:57,743 --> 00:20:01,110
Each of you has specifically chosen
to pay your entrance fee...

247
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,014
...an'd sign up as submissives at E'den,
some of you for fun...

248
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:08,779
...others of you to examine
your sexual an'd emotional lives.

249
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:13,448
An'd we, after careful screening,
have chosen you for one of three reasons:

250
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:16,962
Your curiosity, your 'desire to obey...

251
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:20,193
...or your capacity for arousal.

252
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:23,497
From now on,
you will be referre'd to as citizens of E'den.

253
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:27,596
An'd you will obey all of our comman'ds.
Is that clear?

254
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:29,300
-Yes.
-Goo'd.

255
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,640
When you arrive at E'den,
all of your luggage will be taken...

256
00:20:33,713 --> 00:20:36,876
...an'd store'd on the islan'd
for safekeeping until you leave.

257
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:40,214
At E'den, everybo'dy wears a specific outfit.

258
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:45,381
Yours 'designates that youre citizens
or, if you will, submissives.

259
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:48,224
The trainers will han'd out
your E'den attire...

260
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:50,819
...which youll wear
'during your stay on our islan'd.

261
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:52,728
Excuse me, Doctor.

262
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,529
Is this the right boat
to the fantasy camp for golfers?

263
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:57,933
-Golfers?
-Yes.

264
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:00,131
Im suppose'd to play with Lee Trevino.

265
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:03,039
-You come with me.
-Arnol'd Palmer an'd Chi Chi Ro'driguez....

266
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:07,570
Also, alcohol an'd 'drugs are not permitte'd
on the islan'd.

267
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,271
Youll love it here.
Ive been here three times.

268
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,546
Riba, be quiet.

269
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:18,114
Please put on your E'den outfits,
an'd return to your room.

270
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:24,658
I guess that covers all the 'details
the 'department has to know, Dr. Halifax.

271
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,632
On June 15, Detective Lavery met with
the owner of the resort.

272
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:33,064
A Dr. Martin Halifax,
a guy who is very into ornithology.

273
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,973
Bird collecting. I had to look it up, too.

274
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:40,342
They met at his mansion in Malibu,
California. A very swanky place.

275
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:46,650
Detective Lavery? If theres nothing else....

276
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:52,620
Okay. Well, then, I guess lm off
to your S&M fantasy islan'd.

277
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:56,252
Where the little guy runs aroun'd yelling,
The pain! The pain!

278
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:01,991
-Youre not mocking my work, are you?
-No, sir.

279
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:05,603
In fact, how 'di'd you happen to start
this resort of yours?

280
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,835
I believe theres always been a nee'd
for such a place.

281
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:13,845
There are many people with similar tastes
but with limite'd opportunities to 'discuss...

282
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,107
...or fulfill them.

283
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:18,914
I guess youre right, there.
All you got is your peeler bars...

284
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:22,216
...your sicko han'dcuff clubs,
weir'do newspaper a'ds....

285
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:25,485
But none offers an environment
safe from 'disease or violence.

286
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:30,061
In this era of fringe-group lunacy,
shoul'dnt we preserve free'dom of choice...

287
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:33,223
...in the most intimate of all choices? Sex.

288
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:38,803
Everybo'dy up on 'deck! This is E'den!

289
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,496
Mistress, the boats here.

290
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:29,579
Pa'd'dle!

291
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:55,203
Lets go! Okay, move it!

292
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:00,647
You okay?

293
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:05,546
Keep in time!

294
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,529
Keep your hea'ds 'down!

295
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:38,922
Ladies and gentlemen,
the new citizens are arriving.

296
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:41,516
They beg for your examination.

297
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:49,966
I'm Trainer Kindra,
and I'm pleased to announce that today...

298
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:54,165
...we have a new group of citizens for
everyone's use and approval.

299
00:24:54,607 --> 00:24:57,235
As you choose them, they also choose you.

300
00:24:57,643 --> 00:25:02,080
All our pairings, whether married couples
or singles, are by mutual consent.

301
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,809
Our head trainer Richard
will introduce them.

302
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:09,253
But first, our headmistress of Eden,
Mistress Lisa.

303
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:28,096
I coul'd carry you aroun'd like that, too.

304
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:40,346
All this ceremony an'd ritual
makes me so arouse'd.

305
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,690
Why are we in a tent?

306
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,492
Sometimes planes an'd helicopters fly
overhea'd an'd try to see what were 'doing.

307
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:53,056
What are we 'doing?

308
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,665
Quiet, Riba.

309
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:06,110
You will now meet
each candidate individually...

310
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:10,911
...and, as is custom here at Eden, they will
then pay homage to Mistress Lisa.

311
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:14,476
First, we have Lars from Sweden.

312
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,083
Oh, my Go'd.

313
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,858
Julie. Atlanta, Georgia.

314
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:43,076
Dante. Anaheim, California.

315
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:52,217
Riba, from Fort Worth, Texas.

316
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,355
Jenny. Australia.

317
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:02,559
This isnt quite what I expecte'd.
I gotta get out of here.

318
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:05,069
You cant. The boat alrea'dy left.

319
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,468
Naomi, from Memphis, Tennessee.

320
00:27:12,578 --> 00:27:15,843
Elliot, from Australia
and Los Angeles, California.

321
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:20,144
-Lets go, Citizen Elliot.
-You go.

322
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:22,813
-Im not going up there.
-Yes, you are.

323
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:25,288
-Im not going up.
-Elliot Slater.

324
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,456
Take it off, baby.

325
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:37,527
Okay, thats enough. Heres your robe.
Lets go, Slater.

326
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,032
Thank you very much.

327
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,598
It feels like a sponge cake.

328
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:02,110
Quite a showoff, arent you, Elliot?

329
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:04,985
In'divi'duality is an a'dmirable trait.

330
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:09,390
But not here. I think you nee'd
a couple of 'days to realize...

331
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:13,056
...youre nobo'dy special in E'den.
Turn aroun'd.

332
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:22,395
Put him on work 'detail. Take him away.

333
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:31,680
Heidi, from Fargo, North Dakota.

334
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,513
$3 million worth of stolen diamonds were
confiscated after a shootout...

335
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,717
...that left two suspects still at large.

336
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:46,226
Now that youve foun'd us,
'dont be a stranger.

337
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:50,200
You know, youre gonna be surprise'd
how much use you get out of that.

338
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,433
On June 16, suspects Nina and Omar
were seen at a specialized clothing store...

339
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:59,307
...on Sunset Blvd. Apparently, they found
out where Slater's ship was headed, too.

340
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:03,706
Fred and I arrived at the shop
minutes later.

341
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:05,607
Come on, Lucky.

342
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:09,014
Fred was his usual adventuresome self.
Let's face it.

343
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:12,353
A wild night for Fred
is a Doris Day film festival.

344
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:17,894
No blowup toys, no vibrators, no gels,
no creams, no cuffs, no tapes.

345
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:21,194
-How about some clothes?
-No, actually.

346
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:24,362
Im just here with him. Its his thing.

347
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:28,503
A lot of people feel nervous...

348
00:30:28,574 --> 00:30:31,168
...about this
submissive-'dominant thing at first.

349
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:34,679
But, you know, really,
the submissive person is always in control.

350
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:38,214
All you have to 'do
is give your partner a little control wor'd.

351
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:40,148
Like yellow.

352
00:30:41,053 --> 00:30:44,716
Yellow. Yellow! Fre'd!

353
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:52,625
Look! Bon'dage Man.

354
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:02,867
Its like Elvis Goes to Hell.

355
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:07,076
-Ill be the guest.
-Ill be the maintenance man.

356
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,921
Lets get starte'd.

357
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,524
Lots of men like to hear women talk 'dirty.

358
00:31:31,637 --> 00:31:33,366
Lets hear someone talk 'dirty.

359
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:38,341
Any volunteers? How about you?

360
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:42,004
-No, I coul'dnt.
-Come on. Just try.

361
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,915
Thats why youre here.
Say something hot to your lover in be'd.

362
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:49,417
All right.

363
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:52,382
Come on, put your thing in my thing.

364
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:56,118
Its a start.

365
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:59,119
One, two, three.

366
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:10,808
An'd finally, the experts pre'dict,
to survive intimacy in the year 2000...

367
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:16,306
...women will learn to be more sexually
aggressive, an'd men, more romantic.

368
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:19,616
Our time is up. Thank you. Zara?

369
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:21,285
Thank you, Mistress Lisa.

370
00:32:21,854 --> 00:32:25,654
Now, if you'd all come with me,
well go on to the next class.

371
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:27,682
That was a won'derful lecture.

372
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,456
-Do you have a book out?
-No, we like to keep it kin'd of private here.

373
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,328
I un'derstan'd. I'd better catch up. Bye.

374
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:42,299
-There he is again.
-Yeah.

375
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:46,735
What 'do you think of her? Shes cool.

376
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:52,873
Elliot Slater.

377
00:32:53,552 --> 00:32:57,784
Slater was intrigue'd by erotica
but was reticent to try it until now.

378
00:32:57,956 --> 00:32:59,924
I think we can help him.

379
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:02,485
There he is.

380
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,226
Rea'd the whole bio.

381
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:08,488
Born in Australia an'd grew up
in Californias San Fernan'do Valley.

382
00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:12,203
That must make for an interesting accent.

383
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,905
What the hells he 'doing?

384
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:21,410
Hes an awar'd-winning photojournalist
whose specialty is combat photography.

385
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:23,578
They say hes fearless.

386
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:25,381
Hes never been traine'd.

387
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:28,882
Fast-forwar'd to the en'd of the interview.

388
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:34,053
But one more thing.

389
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:37,418
-What?
-You didn't list your sexual fantasies.

390
00:33:39,865 --> 00:33:41,696
You do have sexual fantasies?

391
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:42,893
Doesn't everybody?

392
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:46,771
Be honest. You're not comfortable
talking about them.

393
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:50,337
Not really.
That's why I want to go to the island.

394
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:55,037
Who else sees this tape?
Does everybody get interviewed like this?

395
00:33:56,548 --> 00:34:00,541
Hes going to be work.
Ill train him myself.

396
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:06,620
When you get to the islan'd,
fin'd this Slater character...

397
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,284
...an'd stick to him like glue.

398
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,521
We 'dont want Slater to know
hes the bait.

399
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:11,755
No, he coul'd panic.

400
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,958
If we tell him we nee'd the film,
well know what Omar looks like.

401
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:17,058
Hes smart. I 'dont want to chance it.

402
00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:21,071
If Omar even suspects that
the police are involve'd, he coul'd 'disappear.

403
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,731
It wont be har'd to spot Nina.

404
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:25,242
How many tall black women are there
in the worl'd?

405
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,868
-Hey, Sheila.
-Hey, Martha.

406
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:31,378
Dr. Halifax has sent your plane tickets.
When you get there....

407
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,680
-What are you 'doing?
-Its wigs, Lieutenant.

408
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:37,620
For un'dercover on the islan'd. In case
they recognize me from the strip club.

409
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:40,749
How? You were alrea'dy in 'disguise
in your stripper cover.

410
00:34:40,826 --> 00:34:42,623
I pointe'd that out to her, sir.

411
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:44,418
Debbie Gibson?

412
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,957
In a less-than-perfect worl'd.

413
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,531
If you fin'd Nina,
I only want you to observe her...

414
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:54,663
...because we coul'd also use her
to get to Omar. I want Omar.

415
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,968
You got it.

416
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:59,306
-Florence Hen'derson?
-No, Mrs. Bra'dy on a binge.

417
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:02,472
Your itineraries are with your tickets.

418
00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:04,139
Pay attention. Look at me.

419
00:35:04,216 --> 00:35:05,410
Im listening.

420
00:35:05,484 --> 00:35:08,317
Watch your expense accounts.
Youre cops, not politicians.

421
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:10,048
-Goo'd luck.
-Roger.

422
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:12,482
Last one, Fre'd. You call it.

423
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:17,918
Julio Iglesias, Sasquatch, roa'd-kill...
Just 'do your New York thing.

424
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:19,122
All right.

425
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:22,098
While I was trying to cover
my stringy hair with wigs...

426
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:25,267
...Omar and Nina were charming
their way to the island.

427
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:28,537
So, thats the favor.
You owe me one, Priscilla.

428
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:31,603
But Dr. Halifax sen'ds me
some of my best clients.

429
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:34,406
Mistress Priscilla,
lm rea'dy to be punishe'd.

430
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,071
Look, I have to go to work.

431
00:35:36,148 --> 00:35:38,412
Omar had 30 years
in the smuggling business...

432
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:41,247
...with no arrests
and no photos ever taken.

433
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:43,344
He wanted to retire with a clean slate.

434
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:45,652
He was obsessed with getting Slater's film.

435
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:46,881
Look.

436
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:50,155
You get me on that next guest list
thats going to that islan'd.

437
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:01,336
I'm sorry about Mom.

438
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:06,040
-Are you going to be okay, Da'd?
-Hell, of course I am.

439
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:09,543
-It just isnt fair.
-Of course its fair.

440
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:11,346
People 'die.

441
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:14,648
She was 52 years ol'd.

442
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:17,044
It was her time.

443
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:21,851
Come on, get in the cab.
Im sure the meters running.

444
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:30,225
Ill call you.

445
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,879
Bye, 'da'd.

446
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,954
Mistress, hes waiting.

447
00:37:04,136 --> 00:37:07,367
Is something wrong?
You havent sai'd a wor'd to me all night.

448
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:09,134
Im just thinking.

449
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:10,731
Thinking about your mother?

450
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:12,868
No, my father, actually.

451
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:17,972
At my mothers funeral, he 'di'dnt cry.
Ive never seen him cry.

452
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,008
Eyes straight.

453
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,185
Lets talk about something prettier.

454
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,457
He is attractive.

455
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:28,390
Especially those eyes.

456
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,654
I woul'dnt know, Mistress.
I cant see his eyes.

457
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,228
Come on, its col'd.

458
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:45,307
Dont look.

459
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:55,117
Come here, I want to sit 'down.

460
00:37:56,922 --> 00:37:58,787
-Where?
-No talking.

461
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:01,651
No.

462
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:11,593
Very goo'd, Pretty Eyes.

463
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:17,298
Now lm going to let you feel
what you so very much wante'd to see.

464
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:28,485
You want me to rock?

465
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:36,654
Bring him to my room tomorrow night.

466
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:48,802
June 17, we arrived on a privately-owned
island just off the coast of Mexico...

467
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:49,999
...called Eden.

468
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:53,639
I thought I'd seen everything.
Well, I hadn't.

469
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:57,547
New guests,
please sign in at the hospitality tent.

470
00:38:57,616 --> 00:39:00,915
Its all right. Our citizens will
take care of your luggage for you.

471
00:39:00,986 --> 00:39:02,715
Itll be at your accommo'dations.

472
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:06,484
The citizens traveled by boat,
and the guests on chartered planes.

473
00:39:06,558 --> 00:39:09,186
Both paid big bucks
for what I was doing free.

474
00:39:09,261 --> 00:39:12,697
Hi, we 'di'dnt meet. Im Bettiann,
an'd this is my husban'd Jeffrey.

475
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,994
-Hi. Lucy Smith. How are you?
-Fine.

476
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:16,761
-Im a 'dental hygienist.
-Really?

477
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:18,063
-Do you floss?
-Yes.

478
00:39:18,136 --> 00:39:20,297
Step right through to the hospitality tent.

479
00:39:20,372 --> 00:39:24,001
-Because you have no tartar buil'dup.
-Tartar? Really?

480
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:28,403
-This is gonna be fun, huh, Bettiann?
-Won'derful, beautiful.

481
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,244
Were in for a treat. I can feel it.

482
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:42,593
Bob Greenway.

483
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:47,854
-Welcome, Master. Im here to please you.
-Ill 'do anything to give you pleasure.

484
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:50,127
Wait! Hes just an employee.

485
00:39:50,435 --> 00:39:53,268
Your transportation is over there, sir.

486
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:56,636
-What can I 'do for you, Master?
-Carry my bag.

487
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,039
Thank you.

488
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,041
Im here to serve you.

489
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:02,602
Use me any way you wish.

490
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:05,047
-Im here to make your bo'dy tingle.
-Is that so?

491
00:40:05,317 --> 00:40:09,913
I believe thats my transportation.
Bob Greenway, air-con'ditioning mechanic.

492
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:15,321
-Ou est ma reservation? Merde!
-Madame Randy, c'est pas dans le registre.

493
00:40:15,393 --> 00:40:17,520
-Votre nom n'est pas ici.
-Madame Randy.

494
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:21,326
Mais, non. Attendez une seconde.
Voila, je I'ai trouvée.

495
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,764
Idiote!

496
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:24,768
May I please you?

497
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:27,734
If you can han'dle it.

498
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,843
Can I just follow the.... Okay, III just....

499
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:38,972
Last year, I was in a hotel in Miami
next to the elevator an'd the ice machine.

500
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,483
What a nightmare.

501
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:42,019
All night.

502
00:40:42,454 --> 00:40:43,944
-Meet you at the room.
-Fine.

503
00:40:44,022 --> 00:40:47,389
-Excuse me, am I near the ice machine?
-No, maam, we make it by han'd.

504
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:50,690
-I will not tolerate being near an--
-Woul'd you please be careful?

505
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:53,856
Do I get the same person all the time,
or 'do they rotate?

506
00:40:53,932 --> 00:40:56,958
Kitty is one of our best citizens.
She finishe'd training early.

507
00:40:57,035 --> 00:40:58,434
Okay, in.

508
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,302
There are no locks on the 'doors.
Nothing to hi'de here at E'den.

509
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:11,440
Hotel phones are room-to-room only.

510
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:14,417
Emergency calls can be ma'de
from the office.

511
00:41:14,486 --> 00:41:16,920
Ill be your personal citizen,
if it pleases you.

512
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:18,387
Thrille'd.

513
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:23,587
I have a little specialty.

514
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:27,831
Specialty?

515
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:32,225
Look, lm a new maintenance man.
Im not a guest here.

516
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,464
So I 'dont have to 'do the kinky stuff, right?

517
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:37,838
lm a 'doctor, an'd everybo'dy
on this islan'd gets a physical.

518
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:40,969
Im checking for hernias. Drop your shorts.

519
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:48,310
Turn your hea'd an'd cough.

520
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:51,552
Cough.

521
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,350
Turn your hea'd the other way. Cough.

522
00:41:57,996 --> 00:41:59,793
Thats a goo'd boy.

523
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:06,763
Or shoul'd I say big boy?

524
00:42:22,387 --> 00:42:24,912
-Im on the job here.
-Me, too.

525
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:27,355
I have to be at Mistress Lisas
in five minutes.

526
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:30,826
Shes having a little welcoming tea
for the new guests. La'dies only.

527
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:33,193
-Well 'discuss intimate things.
-Lucky you.

528
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:35,198
You think that was Nina on the plane?

529
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:38,633
The tall, yellow outfit
shouting at everybo'dy in French?

530
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:40,762
I 'dont think so. Too obvious.

531
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:43,535
Better keep your eye out
for any other possible Ninas.

532
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:46,736
-Excuse me.
-Ive got a list of chores. Oil sex chair.

533
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:51,514
Wait. I know youre new, but maintenance
people are not allowe'd to talk to guests.

534
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:54,017
I was just asking if there was a gift shop.

535
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:56,144
-I nee'd to get some tampons.
-Definitely.

536
00:42:56,221 --> 00:42:58,951
-Super-absorbency? With o'dor control?
-All that.

537
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:00,456
-Perfect.
-Right this way.

538
00:43:00,525 --> 00:43:02,015
Thank you.

539
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:05,387
Coul'd you connect me with Mrs. Ran'dy?

540
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:09,229
Elliot wasn't among the regular citizens.
He was nowhere to be found.

541
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,666
While Nina and Omar
were plotting to find him...

542
00:43:11,736 --> 00:43:14,330
...I checked in to the coffee klatch.

543
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,807
Go on, Nancy.

544
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:20,703
So after 20 years,
he tells me what his sexual fantasies are.

545
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:23,508
I tell him what my sexual fantasies are.

546
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:27,583
It turns out that theyre incre'dibly similar,
except that now its too late...

547
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:31,452
...because were in the mi'd'dle of a 'divorce.
Such a waste of time...

548
00:43:31,556 --> 00:43:33,148
...an'd goo'd sex.

549
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:37,684
Again, you must 'discuss
your sexual fantasies with your partner.

550
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,729
Are you gonna eat that?

551
00:43:40,098 --> 00:43:42,965
-Any other questions?
-Yes, I have two.

552
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:45,767
First, 'do your parents know you 'do this?

553
00:43:48,273 --> 00:43:50,764
They think that I work at a four-star resort.

554
00:43:50,842 --> 00:43:52,867
Which this is, kin'd of.

555
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:57,342
Okay, an'd secon'd, how 'do you 'deci'de
you wanna be a 'dominatrix?

556
00:43:57,415 --> 00:44:01,909
What 'do you, wake up one 'day
an'd go, Hey, I feel like being bossy?

557
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:03,345
No....

558
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:05,753
I 'dont mean to pry.
You 'dont have to tell me.

559
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:07,688
No, its all right.

560
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:12,128
I remember once, there was this birth'day
party in high school for the quarterback...

561
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:15,859
...an'd I volunteere'd to be the present.

562
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:19,896
He never talke'd to me again.

563
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,133
I just wante'd everybo'dy to like me.

564
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:27,769
I 'di'dnt even know the guy.
An'd there were a few others like him.

565
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:30,245
But that all change'd
when I went to college.

566
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:32,783
What 'di'd you take, Spanking 101?

567
00:44:32,884 --> 00:44:35,444
Well, it wasnt on the curriculum.

568
00:44:35,887 --> 00:44:39,550
-Its where I met this professor.
-An'd Mary Ann....

569
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:43,352
-Gilligan's Island?
-My favorite show.

570
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:46,928
Im sorry. Conversation interruptus.
Continuous, please.

571
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:49,956
No, it was an English professor.

572
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:53,036
You see, I went to this very small,
conservative school.

573
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:57,165
And when I was a graduate student,
I wrote a paper on Pri'de an'd Preju'dice.

574
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:01,803
In conclusion, it is apparent that Elizabeth
exhibite'd the qualities of a submissive.

575
00:45:01,879 --> 00:45:04,939
She completely gave herself to her man,
an'd in 'doing so...

576
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:07,007
...forgot her own emotional pain.

577
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:12,546
Youre really busy. I shoul'd go.

578
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:14,286
Put 'down your books.

579
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:20,559
Now take off your sweater.

580
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:24,091
You took off your clothes in his office?
I coul'd never 'do that.

581
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:28,127
Even at home, I take off my clothes in the
bathroom, then I jump into be'd quickly.

582
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:30,140
Which is weir'd, because I live alone.

583
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:33,938
You see, I was a victim.
I woul'd have 'done anything he aske'd.

584
00:45:34,012 --> 00:45:36,640
An'd it wasnt about sex.
He never touche'd me.

585
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:40,178
He seemed to understand
what I was going through.

586
00:45:40,818 --> 00:45:44,015
An'd he arrange'd for me
to meet a frien'd of his...

587
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:46,648
...who specialize'd in erotica.

588
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:51,027
So a large, black limousine
picked me up at school...

589
00:45:51,095 --> 00:45:55,691
...and took me to a beautiful mansion
with a gigantic iron gate.

590
00:45:56,668 --> 00:46:00,229
I was given a note that said,
"Go into the living room...

591
00:46:00,772 --> 00:46:04,833
"...take off your clothes,
put on the blindfold, and wait for me."

592
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,457
Hello, my beauty.

593
00:46:55,093 --> 00:46:56,720
Which one woul'd you like?

594
00:46:59,163 --> 00:47:01,825
I nee'd to hear what your fantasy is.

595
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,068
Im here to create an illusion for you,
only the illusion.

596
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:10,238
I am a top, a master.

597
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:13,176
You are a bottom, a submissive.

598
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:15,337
Yet, were not 'different.

599
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,810
Were in unison to please each other.

600
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:21,875
Just tell me your wishes.

601
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:24,621
An'd welcome to my worl'd.

602
00:47:25,223 --> 00:47:27,714
I 'di'dnt know such a worl'd existe'd.

603
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:30,987
Its a worl'd in which
you have all the choices.

604
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:34,023
Can I choose to be master?

605
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:40,001
The best submissives usually become
the best masters.

606
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:44,438
Youre a victim in life. I will teach you
to always be in total control.

607
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:47,740
You will never be a victim again, ever.

608
00:48:01,926 --> 00:48:03,257
Never.

609
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:17,267
Ever.

610
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:23,703
I liked being in control. It felt safe.

611
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:26,808
But isnt there a happy me'dium?

612
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:30,320
Like, I tie you up one night,
you tie me up the next night?

613
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:34,415
Of course, it woul'd be nice
not to be in control an'd still feel safe.

614
00:48:34,492 --> 00:48:35,584
Have you ever?

615
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:42,959
Anyway, Diana.

616
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:46,130
I look forwar'd to seeing you all
'during your visit.

617
00:48:46,204 --> 00:48:50,868
My favorite Gilligan episo'de?
Kurt Russell as the monkey boy.

618
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:54,503
-He was cute, even then.
-I love that one! Do you remember that?

619
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:57,377
Kurt Russell was on the islan'd.
No one knew he was there.

620
00:48:57,448 --> 00:49:00,076
Follow me,
III lea'd you to our fantasy emporium...

621
00:49:00,151 --> 00:49:02,381
...where you can choose
one of our fantasies.

622
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:03,681
That soun'ds fun.

623
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:05,745
I ha'd a fantasy about Skipper once.

624
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:08,417
Remember Skipper?
He was chubby, but he was cute.

625
00:49:14,732 --> 00:49:18,395
An'd we can also arrange for this fantasy
calle'd Love With a Stranger.

626
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:20,960
Or Having Sex With a Mysterious Lover.

627
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:23,768
A popular fantasy,
especially among women.

628
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:27,208
No commitment.
No wishing the guy calls the next 'day.

629
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:31,908
No shame or guilt. It wasnt your fault.
You were se'duce'd.

630
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:34,375
An'd you 'di'dnt even know his name.

631
00:49:37,255 --> 00:49:39,382
Now, if youll follow me.

632
00:49:39,724 --> 00:49:42,454
An'd this is another of E'dens fantasies.

633
00:49:43,094 --> 00:49:46,962
Enjoying the pleasure of total
submissiveness to voice 'dominance.

634
00:49:47,031 --> 00:49:50,489
An'd being titillate'd by comman'd
is nothing to be ashame'd of.

635
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:53,228
Here we show the secretary
'dominating the boss...

636
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:56,133
...as one of the most common
comman'd fantasies.

637
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:59,235
Mr. Van'derway, what 'do you want?
lts my lunch hour.

638
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,676
Do these 'documents over again in italics.

639
00:50:01,746 --> 00:50:04,681
-An'd give me that letter imme'diately.
-No.

640
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:06,405
What?

641
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:09,009
-Come crawl over here for it.
-Crawl?

642
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:13,088
Mr. Van'derway, I want you to get 'down
on your han'ds an'd knees...

643
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:15,250
...an'd crawl for my letter.

644
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:18,424
Yes, Miss Perkins.

645
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:23,131
Goo'd boss.

646
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:28,701
As Mr. Van'derway obeys, they both
examine the sha'dows of safe, sane...

647
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,267
...an'd submissive sexuality.

648
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:34,343
Our next fantasy is popular
with both sexes.

649
00:50:34,412 --> 00:50:36,004
Sex in Public.

650
00:50:37,315 --> 00:50:39,783
The excitement of getting caught.

651
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,478
How many floors 'does it take
you to make love?

652
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:45,488
In what position 'do you make love
in an elevator?

653
00:50:45,556 --> 00:50:46,887
Lets see.

654
00:50:50,227 --> 00:50:53,924
It seems our Sex in Public fantasy
is out of or'der.

655
00:50:54,899 --> 00:50:58,494
Now, if youll follow me,
well see enactments of the Roman bath.

656
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:01,565
I 'do it all the time. Its a real kick.
Trust me.

657
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:04,767
-Roman baths.
-I once ha'd a terrible toothache in Rome.

658
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:07,208
Can you tell me
where I can fin'd Citizen Elliot?

659
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:09,712
Were not suppose'd to talk about....

660
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,807
I didn't know it at the time, but Omar was
actually on my Fantasy Emporium tour.

661
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:16,216
If she didn't stop asking me
about her teeth...

662
00:51:16,287 --> 00:51:17,982
...I was gonna have to kill her.

663
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:21,582
No sign of Elliot, but two possible Ninas.
How are you 'doing?

664
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:26,358
All right. This islan'd is way over the top.
Man, what a bunch of o'd'dballs.

665
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,389
Will you lighten up? Theyre just
expressing what most people suppress.

666
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:34,598
-On account of it shoul'd be suppresse'd.
-Why? Theyre not hurting anybo'dy.

667
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:38,733
Look, there are some things in life
that are just better left un'done.

668
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,340
Why cant these people think about it...

669
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:44,279
...instea'd of talking an'd acting out,
for heavens sake.

670
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:46,714
It probably gets them past
the game-playing?

671
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:49,184
There was a very interesting scene
over there.

672
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:51,721
There was a business man,
this secretary came in--

673
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:54,019
What are you saying?
Youre being sucke'd in--

674
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:55,183
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

675
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:58,285
-Everyones got to keep up with the group.
-Im so sorry.

676
00:51:58,362 --> 00:52:01,854
I think the maintenance man has
a little crush on me.

677
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:06,731
Lt. Malone had said
to look for strange behavior.

678
00:52:06,804 --> 00:52:09,272
Well, here, it was hard to tell.

679
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:12,137
The rest of the day, I looked for Omar.

680
00:52:12,443 --> 00:52:14,411
Omar looked for Elliot.

681
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:18,175
My "God, I'm good" partner, Fred,
concluded that the obvious Mrs. Randy...

682
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:20,080
...was, in fact, Nina.

683
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:22,415
He watched her,
hoping she'd lead us to Omar.

684
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:25,284
We came up empty,
because Elliot was on the other side...

685
00:52:25,356 --> 00:52:27,187
...of the island doing work detail.

686
00:52:27,258 --> 00:52:30,455
So I decided to treat myself to a massage.

687
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:32,018
Tommy. Lower.

688
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:34,125
-Lower?
-In fact, no, higher.

689
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:35,961
What the hell? Any way you like.

690
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:40,999
Mistress Lisa actually ran a nice place.
She designed all the clothes herself.

691
00:52:41,072 --> 00:52:43,506
Her idea was to create these outfits
that were...

692
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:46,008
...as far away from reality as possible.

693
00:52:46,377 --> 00:52:49,244
Our first day on the island,
and we made no progress.

694
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,483
Fred took the night shift
and almost got electrocuted.

695
00:52:54,919 --> 00:52:57,979
As for me,
I went to bed quietly with a book.

696
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:06,392
Hey! No panting after 2:00 a.m.!

697
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:09,231
Turned out to be a busy night
around the island.

698
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,201
Mistress Lisa's lights were on pretty late.

699
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,630
Stan'd here an'd face the fireplace.

700
00:53:17,575 --> 00:53:18,803
Wait.

701
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,587
Dont be so nosy.

702
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:38,588
Come in here.

703
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:52,870
Take off that robe.

704
00:54:01,819 --> 00:54:03,081
Bathe me.

705
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:21,900
I wanna know you.

706
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:24,567
I 'dont even know your last name.

707
00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:26,641
Tell me.

708
00:54:28,979 --> 00:54:33,541
You have to go along with the illusion,
or else it 'doesnt work.

709
00:54:35,753 --> 00:54:37,380
Now bathe me.

710
00:56:04,308 --> 00:56:08,244
You know how some men
like womens legs?

711
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:11,610
Some like big breasts.

712
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:14,248
Some like long hair.

713
00:56:15,886 --> 00:56:18,081
You know what I like?

714
00:56:19,423 --> 00:56:22,654
I like butts.

715
00:56:23,761 --> 00:56:26,992
Mens beautiful behin'ds.

716
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:31,826
You know what I like to 'do
to gorgeous butts?

717
00:56:33,637 --> 00:56:38,301
I like to squeeze them, pinch them...

718
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:41,105
...an'd caress them.

719
00:56:43,247 --> 00:56:45,807
You know what else I love?

720
00:56:53,424 --> 00:56:56,120
I like to rub my bare breasts...

721
00:56:57,394 --> 00:56:59,988
...'down your back...

722
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:03,030
...an'd over your butt.

723
00:57:08,439 --> 00:57:09,872
You like that, 'dont you?

724
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:15,340
You know what I like the best?

725
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:21,275
What I like best is....

726
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:27,752
-You like that, 'dont you?
-No.

727
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:29,923
Oh, yes.

728
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:33,754
You are going to be punishe'd
with pleasure.

729
00:57:37,668 --> 00:57:39,898
Ive hear'd youre fearless...

730
00:57:40,304 --> 00:57:42,397
...that nothing scares you.

731
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,071
Please, 'dont blin'dfol'd me.

732
00:57:49,146 --> 00:57:53,276
Im covering your eyes, so you can
concentrate on what youre feeling.

733
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,977
You like that.

734
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:57,947
-Tell me you like that.
-No.

735
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:05,719
You like that?
Being punishe'd by a woman?

736
00:58:05,796 --> 00:58:06,820
No.

737
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:09,155
-I think you like it.
-No.

738
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:12,566
I give you permission to like it. Tell me.

739
00:58:12,636 --> 00:58:14,570
No. I 'dont like it.

740
00:58:50,874 --> 00:58:52,501
You like that?

741
00:58:54,077 --> 00:58:57,103
-Do you want me to stop?
-No.

742
00:58:57,381 --> 00:58:59,042
Do you like it?

743
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,141
Tell me, or III stop.

744
00:59:02,486 --> 00:59:03,851
Tell me.

745
00:59:04,087 --> 00:59:05,076
Yes.

746
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:07,020
-Lou'der. I cant hear you.
-I cant.

747
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,717
-Why?
-I 'dont know.

748
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:11,226
-Are you ashame'd of it?
-Yes.

749
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:15,225
Its all right, Elliot. You can say it.
You can like it.

750
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:19,365
Youre allowe'd here. Do you like it?

751
00:59:21,405 --> 00:59:23,532
Tell me. Do you like it?

752
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:25,697
Yes.

753
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:31,371
I 'do like it.

754
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,217
Thats it.

755
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:37,653
Let it go.

756
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:42,449
Goo'd.

757
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:50,962
Its okay, baby.

758
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:55,538
Let it out.

759
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,909
Can I stay here tonight?

760
01:00:02,312 --> 01:00:03,506
Yes.

761
01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:07,914
On the floor, Citizen Elliot.

762
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:13,056
-Woul'd you like a pillow?
-No, thank you.

763
01:00:15,192 --> 01:00:16,716
Goo'd night.

764
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,186
Lisa....

765
01:00:19,463 --> 01:00:20,828
Goo'd night.

766
01:00:42,953 --> 01:00:44,887
Lucy. Sorry.

767
01:00:44,955 --> 01:00:48,254
Tommy. I cant believe
they 'dont have locks on this 'door.

768
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:49,724
What are you 'doing here?

769
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:53,320
I saw you with that mask, an'd I thought
you wante'd to play ban'dit girl.

770
01:00:53,397 --> 01:00:55,092
-No.
-Come on.

771
01:00:55,165 --> 01:00:59,124
-Ill let you capture me.
-No, actually, this is a sleeping mask.

772
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:03,138
See those tiki torches out there?
I felt like I was on an airport runway.

773
01:01:04,308 --> 01:01:07,744
Are there any other fun games
you might wanna play?

774
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:12,111
Sleeping. Sleepings fun for me.
Im gonna get back to it right now, in fact.

775
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:15,913
Im gonna 'dream about fantasies that
maybe we can 'do some other time, okay?

776
01:01:15,986 --> 01:01:17,317
All right.

777
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:19,820
-Lucy?
-Yes?

778
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:23,118
I coul'd sleep on the floor by you
an'd wake you up in the morning.

779
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:26,128
I 'dont really nee'd a human alarm clock.

780
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:28,061
I coul'd use a human 'door lock.

781
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:32,329
Why 'dont you go lay in front of the 'door,
an'd you can play guar'd boy?

782
01:01:32,402 --> 01:01:34,563
-Guar'd boy. I can 'do that.
-You like that?

783
01:01:34,638 --> 01:01:36,697
All right, Tommy. Go ahea'd. Run along.

784
01:01:36,773 --> 01:01:38,638
-You got it.
-See you in the morning.

785
01:01:38,709 --> 01:01:40,609
Ill be stepping over you. Okay.

786
01:01:40,677 --> 01:01:42,042
-Bye.
-Goo'd to see you.

787
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:44,204
Thanks for stopping in.

788
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:50,512
This pleasure islan'd
is starting to get to me.

789
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:56,421
Its affecting my work now.
Like to'day, I mean, I went berserk.

790
01:01:56,994 --> 01:01:58,859
Nobody seemed to care.

791
01:01:58,929 --> 01:02:01,159
Their sex sensors are numb.

792
01:02:04,234 --> 01:02:06,327
Well, the flesh is weak.

793
01:02:07,004 --> 01:02:11,031
An'd I think about other things
to 'distract myself.

794
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:13,970
Small-engine repair.

795
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:03,848
Elliot, I was just 'dreaming.

796
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:12,428
What are you 'doing?

797
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,070
Allow me to please you.

798
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:19,838
You 'dont have to 'do anything.
Just let me please you.

799
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:20,899
Elliot.

800
01:03:54,644 --> 01:03:55,702
Yes.

801
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:02,084
-What are you doing?
-I'm kissing you. Do you mind?

802
01:04:02,552 --> 01:04:06,454
You know, its like, you see the flesh
all the time, the nake'dness.

803
01:04:06,523 --> 01:04:11,324
But is the anticipation more exciting,
or the actual nake'd flesh itself?

804
01:04:12,996 --> 01:04:16,193
Trying to sort it all out. A little confuse'd.

805
01:04:19,836 --> 01:04:22,771
I 'dont care. Im rea'ding the last page.

806
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,842
Lisa Emerson.

807
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:29,901
Why 'di'd I tell him my name?

808
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:37,837
Our second day on the island
was Sports Day.

809
01:05:47,257 --> 01:05:48,383
Faster, come on.

810
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:50,585
Peanuts. Fresh peanuts over here.

811
01:05:51,595 --> 01:05:55,087
The roller race is open to guests,
trainers and citizens.

812
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:58,657
The victor will win a private audience
with Mistress Lisa.

813
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:01,795
Exhibition tennis is available
on the upper level.

814
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:04,136
We hope you all participate in Sports Day.

815
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:09,377
-All right, Lucy. Show em what you got.
-Come on, serve it.

816
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:12,740
Thats the man. I got it.

817
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:16,710
Erotic art here. Art through the ages.

818
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:20,416
Ben Wah balls!

819
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:22,582
-What are they use'd for?
-Can I buy that?

820
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:26,356
Marital ai'ds, marital ai'ds,
come vibrate with me.

821
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:43,271
Wanna punish me for those two points?

822
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,440
No, I think I'd like to go 'down
to the beach now.

823
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:49,676
-Hey, how are you 'doing?
-All right.

824
01:06:49,753 --> 01:06:52,654
-Kicke'd ass in volleyball.
-I knew you ha'd it in you.

825
01:06:52,722 --> 01:06:54,519
Its tough to spike in curtains.

826
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,957
My mother ha'd that pattern
in her living room.

827
01:06:57,027 --> 01:06:59,052
-Have you seen Slater aroun'd?
-No.

828
01:06:59,129 --> 01:07:02,064
We gotta solve this case soon,
because hanging aroun'd here...

829
01:07:02,132 --> 01:07:04,999
...I am so horny. You ever get horny?

830
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:06,092
In high school.

831
01:07:06,169 --> 01:07:08,797
-I am getting so arouse'd.
-Spare me.

832
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,365
Is this really where were all hea'de'd?

833
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:13,909
Some, yes. Some of us, no.

834
01:07:13,977 --> 01:07:15,239
-Youre a hit.
-What?

835
01:07:15,312 --> 01:07:18,304
Everyones talking about you.
They want you in the ring toss.

836
01:07:18,381 --> 01:07:20,747
-What?
-Something about your physical. Big boy?

837
01:07:20,817 --> 01:07:22,944
-Get out of here.
-Im getting aggressive.

838
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:25,249
Im requesting Citizen Elliot to my room.

839
01:07:25,322 --> 01:07:28,223
-Im on the job. Ill see you later.
-Ill be wee'ding.

840
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:31,454
Fix that gong. Im sick of seeing
broken gongs all over this islan'd.

841
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:34,762
Citizen Julie,
report to the sticky-buns booth.

842
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:37,265
Thats me. Excuse me. On my way.

843
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:44,204
Big boy, huh?

844
01:07:49,546 --> 01:07:50,979
En'd of the line, maam.

845
01:07:51,047 --> 01:07:54,608
I'd heard from my slave man, Tommy,
that the people in work detail...

846
01:07:54,684 --> 01:07:57,152
...were being let off
to participate in Sports Day.

847
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,882
I thought there was finally a chance
to request Slater.

848
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:01,755
Come in.

849
01:08:03,693 --> 01:08:07,254
-This is Citizen Elliot, as you requeste'd.
-Thank you.

850
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:10,093
-Hi.
-Hello.

851
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,190
Lucy.

852
01:08:11,301 --> 01:08:13,769
What woul'd you like to 'do?
Perhaps a massage?

853
01:08:13,837 --> 01:08:17,364
This is my first time. I was hoping
maybe we coul'd talk first.

854
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,341
Do you think we coul'd 'do this after lunch?

855
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:23,004
Whats the matter,
cant talk on an empty stomach?

856
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:26,810
-No, its not that.
-Its my hair, isnt it?

857
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:29,849
-What?
-Its my hair. You can say.

858
01:08:29,919 --> 01:08:33,480
I can see it. Its limp. Its stringy.
Its not hanging right.

859
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:38,391
No, not at all. Youre very nice, Lucy.
Its just, well, the race is about to start.

860
01:08:38,461 --> 01:08:41,692
Oh, that rollerbla'ding thing.
Yes, I hear the announcements.

861
01:08:41,765 --> 01:08:44,165
Lucky me.
I get the room right next to the gong.

862
01:08:44,234 --> 01:08:45,861
I wante'd to enter that race.

863
01:08:45,935 --> 01:08:50,201
Oh, really? Di'd you hear first prize?
You get to spen'd time with Mistress Lisa.

864
01:08:50,273 --> 01:08:52,707
Yeah, I want that privilege.

865
01:08:53,676 --> 01:08:57,510
-You got a crush?
-We just got to know each other a little.

866
01:08:58,348 --> 01:08:59,645
You have a big crush.

867
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:03,817
-It soun'ds pretty corny.
-What?

868
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:09,619
Just relax, breathe, preten'd lm Oprah.
Come on, you can tell me.

869
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:11,118
Okay.

870
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:15,563
Have you ever been with somebo'dy
that actually ma'de violin music...

871
01:09:15,632 --> 01:09:16,860
...play in your hea'd?

872
01:09:16,966 --> 01:09:20,663
Skinny girls hear violins.
Not-so-skinny girls hear French horns.

873
01:09:20,737 --> 01:09:22,136
I know what you mean.

874
01:09:22,205 --> 01:09:24,639
-Di'd you tell her?
-I wish I coul'd.

875
01:09:24,908 --> 01:09:27,433
Thats the problem, I cant.
I 'dont know how.

876
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,842
I cant get close to her.
She wont talk to me.

877
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,980
Thats tough. You know, scary.

878
01:09:32,048 --> 01:09:34,516
You tell someone,
you 'dont know what theyll say.

879
01:09:34,584 --> 01:09:36,552
Once a year, I go to the Gran'd Canyon.

880
01:09:36,619 --> 01:09:41,522
I scream, I like you, just so
I can hear back, I like you, I like you.

881
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:45,254
Attention skaters.
Last call for the rollerblade race.

882
01:09:45,628 --> 01:09:46,959
Go on, get out of here.

883
01:09:48,364 --> 01:09:50,332
-I promise III come back.
-All right.

884
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,958
Here, hol'd this.

885
01:09:52,035 --> 01:09:53,400
-Hey, Elliot?
-Yeah?

886
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:55,665
-I hear youre a photographer.
-Yeah.

887
01:09:55,738 --> 01:09:57,865
Think you can take some pictures for me?

888
01:09:57,941 --> 01:10:02,241
No, they took my camera away from me
an'd stuck it in storage with my other stuff.

889
01:10:02,312 --> 01:10:03,745
I 'dont know where it is.

890
01:10:03,813 --> 01:10:07,305
-Really? Has anyone else requeste'd you?
-No, lve been on work 'detail.

891
01:10:07,383 --> 01:10:09,749
Just curious. Go ahea'd. Youre late.

892
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:11,616
-Thank you.
-Hey, Elliot?

893
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:15,583
-Be careful out there.
-Your hair is just fine.

894
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:16,917
You think?

895
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:23,999
A guy takes off his pants
to leave my room.

896
01:10:25,702 --> 01:10:27,101
Skaters, take your places.

897
01:10:28,872 --> 01:10:30,464
On your marks.

898
01:10:30,874 --> 01:10:33,308
-Get set.
-Wait!

899
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:36,039
An'd theyre off.

900
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:43,383
-What the hell was that?
-Hey, wait! You forgot your number!

901
01:10:54,097 --> 01:10:57,225
The race turned out to be
the turning point in the investigation.

902
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,631
Go, Elliot!

903
01:11:02,805 --> 01:11:05,797
Slater was out there
for all the world to see, including Omar.

904
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:07,035
Come on!

905
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:10,238
Fred was supposed to cover the event,
but he had to feed the fish.

906
01:11:10,313 --> 01:11:13,771
If you ask me, they feed those fish
too much. Those are chubby koi.

907
01:11:24,827 --> 01:11:28,263
Elliot was no Olympic skater,
but he gave it his all.

908
01:11:40,009 --> 01:11:41,067
Yes!

909
01:11:41,644 --> 01:11:42,838
He won.

910
01:11:44,013 --> 01:11:46,504
-The winner is Citizen....
-Citizen Elliot.

911
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:50,246
Citizen Elliot. His number
must have been torn off from passion.

912
01:12:01,631 --> 01:12:03,462
Heres your number.

913
01:12:04,567 --> 01:12:06,091
Its my lucky number.

914
01:12:06,169 --> 01:12:08,296
-Riba, lm sorry.
-Its okay.

915
01:12:08,538 --> 01:12:11,336
Are you rea'dy for us?
Do you wanna 'do a threesome?

916
01:12:11,608 --> 01:12:13,007
Well, not really.

917
01:12:13,076 --> 01:12:16,603
Watching you two will be such a joy.
My names Tillington, from Guilfor'd.

918
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:19,079
Congratulations on the race.
You were very goo'd.

919
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:20,137
Thank you.

920
01:12:22,085 --> 01:12:23,279
Mistress Lisa....

921
01:12:23,419 --> 01:12:28,379
After the race, Omar made his move.
And lucky for us, so did Mistress Lisa.

922
01:12:33,563 --> 01:12:35,588
-I think it woul'd be a goo'd i'dea.
-Goo'd.

923
01:12:35,665 --> 01:12:39,431
Im sorry. I cant allow this.
We 'dont permit voyeurism.

924
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,459
But thats my fantasy.

925
01:12:41,638 --> 01:12:45,199
Citizen Elliot hasnt complete'd his training.

926
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:48,401
-Sen'd him to his quarters.
-I 'dont min'd if he hasnt finishe'd.

927
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:50,878
-Now, Richar'd.
-Citizens quarters.

928
01:12:50,947 --> 01:12:54,280
-Lets go, Citizen Elliot.
-Im sorry, Mr....

929
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:57,376
-Tillington, from Guilfor'd.
-From Guilfor'd, thats right.

930
01:12:57,453 --> 01:13:00,786
Im sure Kitty can fin'd many ways
to please you.

931
01:13:00,857 --> 01:13:05,556
Yeah, lets go get Citizen Joy.
Shes really pretty, an'd shes got peanuts.

932
01:13:05,628 --> 01:13:07,425
I 'dont want peanuts.

933
01:13:09,032 --> 01:13:12,991
-Do you have a problem with that, Richar'd?
-No, Mistress.

934
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:14,768
If I may....

935
01:13:16,339 --> 01:13:17,738
You may not.

936
01:13:24,814 --> 01:13:27,214
Since when 'dont we permit voyeurism?

937
01:13:27,617 --> 01:13:31,109
Since Mistress Lisa starte'd to get soft
on a citizen.

938
01:13:32,922 --> 01:13:35,117
We shoul'd give Elliot to a harsher guest.

939
01:14:03,086 --> 01:14:04,451
Come in.

940
01:14:05,054 --> 01:14:08,285
Im sorry. Were not going to be able to
grant your request.

941
01:14:08,358 --> 01:14:10,258
Elliot Slater is with another guest.

942
01:14:10,326 --> 01:14:12,191
-With who?
-Mrs. Ran'dy.

943
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:14,820
Sorry. Maybe tomorrow.

944
01:14:30,813 --> 01:14:32,178
Come in.

945
01:14:36,219 --> 01:14:39,711
Mrs. Ran'dy,
Citizen Elliot is here for your pleasure.

946
01:14:44,327 --> 01:14:46,454
I guess lm your fantasy.

947
01:14:52,402 --> 01:14:54,427
Quiet. Down on your knees.

948
01:14:58,908 --> 01:15:00,773
Kiss my thigh.

949
01:15:01,177 --> 01:15:02,371
Come on.

950
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:09,544
Go'd, youre so boring.
Cant you 'do anything right?

951
01:15:11,721 --> 01:15:13,450
Now, turn aroun'd.

952
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:21,421
Were going to play a game,
a question game.

953
01:15:21,497 --> 01:15:24,398
An'd the question game has
only one question.

954
01:15:26,135 --> 01:15:28,899
-Where is the camera?
-Hello?

955
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:32,835

What are you 'doing with him?

956
01:15:32,909 --> 01:15:36,436
-Anything I like. Do you min'd?
-As a matter of fact, I 'do.

957
01:15:36,512 --> 01:15:39,743
You see, I have a 2:30 appointment
with him. Hes mine.

958
01:15:39,816 --> 01:15:42,808
-I got all 'dresse'd up in this outfit--
-Spare me the 'details.

959
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:44,112
Get out of my room.

960
01:15:44,821 --> 01:15:46,288
Do you have a confirmation?

961
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:50,748
-A confirmation?
-Yes, a confirmation.

962
01:15:50,827 --> 01:15:52,158
No, I wasnt given one.

963
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:55,595
Well, guess what? I was.
Your loss. Get with the program.

964
01:15:55,665 --> 01:15:57,462
You, with me, now.

965
01:15:57,834 --> 01:16:02,635
Get up. Take off the robe.
I like that thong thing. Walk tall.

966
01:16:03,406 --> 01:16:06,068
Tell me I look gorgeous from behin'd.

967
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:12,007
You blew it again,
an'd this time you werent even sneezing.

968
01:16:12,081 --> 01:16:16,347
-You coul'd have helpe'd.
-No, you 'do the killing, I 'do the thinking.

969
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:18,081
Now what?

970
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:20,888
You stay here, an'd you wait.

971
01:16:21,224 --> 01:16:24,284
I know that New York girl.

01:16:24,627 --> 01:16:27,596
-Whats going on?
-Listen, lm not a 'dental hygienist.

973
01:16:27,663 --> 01:16:30,996
My name is not Lucy Smith.
I 'di'd not come to this islan'd to have fun.

974
01:16:31,067 --> 01:16:33,399
I came to this islan'd for one reason.

975
01:16:33,469 --> 01:16:34,697
-Elliot.
-Yeah?

976
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,238
-You are to go on work 'detail now.

01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:42,306
An'dre will be happy

979
01:16:42,378 --> 01:16:45,108
Well, I 'dont want a replacement!
I woul'd like Elliot!

980
01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:48,708
Hey, Skin an'd Bones! You, Toothpick Girl!

981
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:52,753
How can I fulfill your fantasy?

982
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:54,986
Go paint my house.

983
01:17:00,897 --> 01:17:04,230
-This fruit plate will be better for you.
-Thanks.

984
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:07,395
Now, thats an outfit to crawl for.

985
01:17:07,803 --> 01:17:09,236
May I 'do my specialty?

986
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:12,035
No, I 'dont feel like having my toes
sucke'd right now.

987
01:17:12,108 --> 01:17:13,507
-You sure?
-Yes, I am.

988
01:17:13,576 --> 01:17:15,134

-May I fee'd you?

989
01:17:15,211 --> 01:17:17,941
No, you can answer
a question for me, though.

990
01:17:18,014 --> 01:17:21,916
If I wante'd to fin'd out where
Citizen Elliot was, how woul'd I go about it?

991
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,054
Are you gonna replace me?

992
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:27,453
No, never.

993
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:28,683
Then, why?

994
01:17:28,758 --> 01:17:31,750
I just nee'd to talk to him.
Can you go get him for me?

995
01:17:31,827 --> 01:17:34,921
-Right away.
-Yes, thank you.

996
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:38,093
You know, its a lot quicker if you walk.

997
01:17:39,335 --> 01:17:42,793
Look at this, he took out the see'ds.

998
01:17:44,574 --> 01:17:46,007
Mistress!

999
01:17:46,075 --> 01:17:47,770
Here are his bags.

1000
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:51,369
-Tommy brought them from storage.
-Look at the way he packs.

1001
01:17:53,316 --> 01:17:57,548
Hes changing his clothes. He thinks this is
his special meeting for winning the race.

1002
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,355
I ma'de a fool of myself at that race...

1003
01:18:00,423 --> 01:18:04,154
...hopping off my horse
like some jealous bir'dbrain.

1004
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,920
-Why 'di'dnt you stop me?
-Im only a citizen.

1005
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:09,222
Ive traine'd hun'dre'ds of men an'd women.

1006
01:18:09,298 --> 01:18:12,028
Ive create'd fantasies for them.

1007
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:15,070
Ive gotten them in touch with
their 'deepest feelings.

1008
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:18,065
How come this photographers
gotten to me?

1009
01:18:18,374 --> 01:18:21,138
-Im only a citizen.
-Will you stop saying that?

1010
01:18:21,477 --> 01:18:26,414
Youve watche'd me train, youre smart,
youre going to be a trainer yourself.

1011
01:18:26,549 --> 01:18:29,643
So tell me, what 'do you think?

1012
01:18:32,388 --> 01:18:35,653
Maybe this Elliot opene'd up
your feelings a little bit.

1013
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:38,457
-I 'dont want to hear that.
-Sorry.

1014
01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:42,887
Mistress Lisa?

1015
01:18:46,936 --> 01:18:49,803
I finally get to spen'd some time with you...

1016
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,664
...alone?

1017
01:18:56,112 --> 01:18:59,047
Why are my bags here? Am I moving in?

1018
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:09,451
I have a very important job here...

1019
01:19:09,525 --> 01:19:11,993
...that I like, an'd lm goo'd at it.

1020
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:16,662
An'd you have become
a 'disruptive influence.

1021
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:20,261
Its my fault as much as it is yours.

1022
01:19:22,038 --> 01:19:25,599
So, lm afrai'd you have to leave E'den.
Heres your money back.

1023
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:29,139
Diana will make arrangements
for you to get home.

1024
01:19:29,812 --> 01:19:31,439
Have a goo'd trip.

1025
01:19:41,123 --> 01:19:42,181
Excuse me.

1026
01:19:45,461 --> 01:19:48,294
What happene'd between last night
an'd this morning?

1027
01:19:48,364 --> 01:19:52,528
Last night, you ha'd a won'derful
bon'dage fantasy an'd I helpe'd you accept it.

1028
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:53,932
Thats what we 'do here.

1029
01:19:54,003 --> 01:19:56,335
-It wasnt real.
-Yes, but afterwar'ds.

1030
01:19:57,339 --> 01:20:02,038
Im a professional, an'd I let it get personal,
an'd thats why you have to leave.

1031
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:04,272
One con'dition: you come with me.

1032
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,005
-I cant 'do that.
-Come on, I won the race.

1033
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:10,382
You owe me time. Come with me.
We can go away for a weeken'd.

1034
01:20:10,953 --> 01:20:12,420
-I have money.
-Elliot....

1035
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:15,616
Diana says you love the South.
We can go to New Orleans.

1036
01:20:15,825 --> 01:20:18,055
-You like New Orleans.
-I 'dont have time.

1037
01:20:18,127 --> 01:20:20,391
An'd lm not intereste'd in relationship stuff.

1038
01:20:20,463 --> 01:20:23,193
Its not serious.
We can stay in separate rooms.

1039
01:20:23,265 --> 01:20:24,562
We just have fun.

1040
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:28,262
We go away, we have fun,
an'd we see if you an'd I are real.

1041
01:20:28,637 --> 01:20:31,629
I cant believe
you want to 'deny what we feel.

1042
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:33,174
Youre so sweet.

1043
01:20:33,242 --> 01:20:34,300
-Sweet?
-Yeah.

1044
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:35,843
She says lm sweet.

1045
01:20:37,413 --> 01:20:41,474
Sweet means III en'd up
in New Orleans alone, listening to a banjo.

1046
01:20:41,617 --> 01:20:43,312
All right, III think about it.

1047
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:45,518
Okay.

1048
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,727
We are going.

1049
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:54,555
Diana?

1050
01:20:58,234 --> 01:21:02,227
I just brought Elliots luggage to Mistress
Lisa. That means hes being sent away.

1051
01:21:02,538 --> 01:21:05,974
-Sent away where?
-I 'dont know. Only she woul'd know.

1052
01:21:06,142 --> 01:21:10,511
But if youre looking for two guys,
Citizen Lars is available.

1053
01:21:10,646 --> 01:21:11,772
Actually, no!

1054
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:14,543
lts my 'dream just to make you happy.

1055
01:21:14,617 --> 01:21:18,246
Yeah, you an'd every man.
I really have to see Mistress Lisa.

1056
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,345
Thats my thigh there, Tom.

1057
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:21,616
No, my breasts.

1058
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:25,319
Okay, listen, why 'dont you take a shower?
How about that?

1059
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:29,657
Maybe 'do some pushups, who knows?
Fix the room. It coul'd use a little spackle.

1060
01:21:30,099 --> 01:21:31,396
Dont you think?

1061
01:21:31,467 --> 01:21:35,164
Got to run. Love to stay an'd talk.
Ill be back before you can say fetish.

1062
01:21:35,237 --> 01:21:37,034
I hate these garters.

1063
01:21:42,378 --> 01:21:43,868
You like this?

1064
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,578
Are you enjoying your stay on the islan'd?

1065
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:51,279
You know, the secrets to get involve'd,
to get with the program.

1066
01:22:03,699 --> 01:22:05,394
This better be important.

1067
01:22:15,377 --> 01:22:17,937
-Is your mistress here?
-What?

1068
01:22:20,649 --> 01:22:24,881
-Is your mistress here?
-No. She went to see Mistress Lisa.

1069
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,020
-Alone?
-Yes.

1070
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:32,419
Take care of the get-with-the-program
girl, III go fin'd our photographer.

1071
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:34,894
Ill meet you out by the golf cart.

1072
01:22:35,164 --> 01:22:36,961
Pleasure to meet you.

1073
01:22:41,237 --> 01:22:42,636
That was nice.

1074
01:22:48,344 --> 01:22:50,505
This better be important. Im a busy man.

1075
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:52,376
Mistress Lisa took a cart.

1076
01:22:52,815 --> 01:22:55,943
-So?
-She was with Citizen Elliot.

1077
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:59,215
They ha'd luggage,
they talke'd about New Orleans...

1078
01:22:59,288 --> 01:23:01,188
...they went towar'd her plane.

1079
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:05,357
The whereabouts of Mistress Lisa
is privilege'd information.

1080
01:23:05,427 --> 01:23:09,955
Is that so? lm a cop. LAPD.
Where is she?

1081
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:12,899
She an'd Citizen Elliot left the islan'd.
Whats wrong?

1082
01:23:12,968 --> 01:23:14,833
Nothing yet. Can you 'do me a favor?

1083
01:23:14,904 --> 01:23:17,532
Can you go get that new maintenance man,
that Marv....

1084
01:23:17,606 --> 01:23:19,403
-Greenway. Utica, New York.
-Right.

1085
01:23:19,475 --> 01:23:21,875
-Absolutely.
-Thank you very much.

1086
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,845
Here we go.

1087
01:23:31,687 --> 01:23:32,847
Bingo.

1088
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:56,300
Get off of me!

1089
01:24:01,483 --> 01:24:03,951
Whoa! Pardonnez-moi!

1090
01:24:04,086 --> 01:24:06,577
Shes trying to kill me, you i'diot!

1091
01:24:10,025 --> 01:24:11,856
-Cuff her!
-I 'dont have any cuffs!

1092
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:14,487
The only two people on this islan'd
without han'dcuffs!

1093
01:24:14,563 --> 01:24:16,793
-Let me go!
-Wheres Slater?

1094
01:24:17,132 --> 01:24:19,327
He left with Lisa. No sign of Omar.

1095
01:24:20,536 --> 01:24:21,662
Tie her up.

1096
01:24:21,737 --> 01:24:23,466
Nina Blackstone....

1097
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,101
Are you gonna tell us
where your partner is?

1098
01:24:27,176 --> 01:24:29,974
I 'dont know what youre talking about.
Im a guest here.

1099
01:24:30,045 --> 01:24:31,603
Right. Listen to me!

1100
01:24:33,015 --> 01:24:35,540
-Dont bite him!
-Let me go! Youve ma'de a mistake!

1101
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:36,811
Youre un'der arrest.

1102
01:24:36,885 --> 01:24:39,718
-Rea'd her her rights.
-You have the right to remain silent.

1103
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:42,916
-Anything you say will be use'd against you.
-Stop it!

1104
01:24:48,364 --> 01:24:49,991
-Keep your toes 'down!
-No!

1105
01:24:50,065 --> 01:24:51,396
-No?
-No.

1106
01:24:55,137 --> 01:24:58,664
Now, that is something
I woul'd not have been capable of.

1107
01:24:58,741 --> 01:25:01,437
My 'de'ductions are saying
Omar is still on this rock.

1108
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:03,705
But we still 'dont know what he looks like.

1109
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:07,875
Yes, I'd like to put a person-to-person call
through to New Orleans, please.

1110
01:25:08,384 --> 01:25:12,013
Will you stop a minute?
lm trying to talk business.

1111
01:25:12,554 --> 01:25:14,522
We take him out on the Avenue tonight.

1112
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:17,787
We all point to him an'd say,
Hey, theres Tom Cruise!

1113
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:20,895
He sells his autograph,
an'd we split the money.

1114
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:25,126
-He 'doesnt look like Tom Cruise.
-My wife thinks he looks like Tom Cruise.

1115
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,599
-Speak.
-Latte?

1116
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:28,033
-Yeah.

1117
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:31,595
Mr. Omar, how you 'doing?
My 'da'd gets out on parole in four months.

1118
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:35,040
-I'm driving his cab.
-Thats nice. You give him my best wishes.

1119
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:38,375
I have to go to New Orleans
for a couple of 'days. I nee'd a favor.

1120
01:25:38,447 --> 01:25:39,846
You coming here? Great!

1121
01:25:39,915 --> 01:25:42,748
While we were turning Nina
over to the San Diego Police...

1122
01:25:42,818 --> 01:25:45,685
...Omar was making plans
to go kill Slater himself.

1123
01:25:45,754 --> 01:25:50,157
He hired a street-band musician,
Latte Chavez, to help until he arrived.

1124
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:55,456
-All right, lets go to work.
-I know who it is. He looks like Bra'd Pitt.

1125
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:57,658
He 'doesnt look like Bra'd Pitt either.

1126
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,701
Bra'd Pitt? He looks like Tom Cruise!

1127
01:26:14,183 --> 01:26:16,151
Youre an awful lot of fun to be with.

1128
01:26:16,218 --> 01:26:17,583
I can be fun.

1129
01:26:18,487 --> 01:26:20,352
I just get pai'd to be mean.

1130
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:27,818
Subjects A an'd B lan'de'd
in a white, twin-engine Cessna 421...

1131
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:30,998
...change'd clothes
at the River Terrace Hotel...

1132
01:26:31,066 --> 01:26:34,832
...an'd went imme'diately to Bourbon Street
with the rest of the yahoos.

1133
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:36,501
Latte out.

1134
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:41,909
-Its Tom Cruise.
-Its not.

1135
01:26:41,977 --> 01:26:43,205
-It is.
-Its not.

1136
01:26:43,278 --> 01:26:45,041
-I swear it is.
-Thats Bra'd Pitt.

1137
01:26:45,114 --> 01:26:46,741
-No, it is not!
-It is.

1138
01:26:57,292 --> 01:27:00,352
Theyre on foot.
Ive switche'd to a rente'd car...

1139
01:27:00,729 --> 01:27:02,390
...a sweet Beemer.

1140
01:27:02,865 --> 01:27:05,959
What 'do I like to 'do best in be'd?

1141
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:08,235
-I like to giggle.
-Giggle?

1142
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:09,702
Cu'd'dle an'd giggle.

1143
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:13,332
After a har'd 'day of smacking people,
its nice to cu'd'dle.

1144
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:14,837
Cu'd'dle?

1145
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:16,935
You mean, just cu'd'dle?

1146
01:27:26,922 --> 01:27:30,153
The next morning, an island-hopping
food-supply plane left Eden.

1147
01:27:30,225 --> 01:27:33,456
Stashed among the food was
a Mr. Tillington of Guilford.

1148
01:27:37,533 --> 01:27:41,333
A credit-card check found Lisa and Elliot
at a hotel in New Orleans.

1149
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:44,997
We were on our way,
racking up the frequent-flyer miles.

1150
01:27:49,278 --> 01:27:50,939
Come on, slowpoke, get 'dresse'd.

1151
01:27:51,013 --> 01:27:54,210
Its a beautiful 'day outsi'de,
an'd were going to have some fun.

1152
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:57,318
What 'do you have there? lm starving.

1153
01:28:00,355 --> 01:28:02,380
Croissants from the French Quarter.

1154
01:28:05,694 --> 01:28:07,525
I 'dont nee'd butter with my....

1155
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:15,826
Now, pay attention.
This is an ol'd Australian recipe.

1156
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:21,172
Thank you.

1157
01:28:29,251 --> 01:28:31,344
One stick of butter...

1158
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,513
...at room temperature.

1159
01:28:43,865 --> 01:28:46,197
Di'd you see Last Tango in Paris?

1160
01:28:47,302 --> 01:28:48,326
No.

1161
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,867
An'd a sprinkle...

1162
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,300
...of cinnamon.

1163
01:29:04,753 --> 01:29:06,584
Australian kink.

1164
01:29:10,259 --> 01:29:11,658
Bon appetit.

1165
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,675
Excuse me.

1166
01:29:33,582 --> 01:29:34,606
Im sorry.

1167
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:39,152
Yes?

1168
01:29:39,221 --> 01:29:41,052
Mistress Lisa, this is Richard.

1169
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:44,191
While you were kidnapping a guest,
all hell broke loose here.

1170
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:47,422
-I un'derstan'd. I got it.
-Did you know what Mrs.--

1171
01:29:59,841 --> 01:30:01,308
Who was that?

1172
01:30:01,643 --> 01:30:02,871
Richar'd.

1173
01:30:03,412 --> 01:30:04,709
Quite a moo'd breaker.

1174
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:06,579
He thinks I ki'dnappe'd you.

1175
01:30:06,982 --> 01:30:08,210
He what?

1176
01:30:08,383 --> 01:30:11,443
I broke my own rule,
taking you off the islan'd.

1177
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:16,051
-So are you going back?
-I have to. Im the boss.

1178
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:18,726
If lm the boss, why 'do I have to go?

1179
01:30:18,794 --> 01:30:21,661
I always wante'd to go see New Orleans.
Im here right now!

1180
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:23,857
I 'dont know what lm 'doing.

1181
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:26,190
An'd lm whining.

1182
01:30:31,206 --> 01:30:32,434
Come on.

1183
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,876
-Where are we going?
-Thats a surprise.

1184
01:30:43,618 --> 01:30:48,112
This is one of our loveliest
antebellum mansions in the area.

1185
01:30:48,357 --> 01:30:50,382
Antebellum means anything...

1186
01:30:50,459 --> 01:30:53,860
...that was before
the War of Northern Aggression.

1187
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:56,921
Please, come right on in.

1188
01:30:57,432 --> 01:31:01,892
Yall watch your step, now. Be careful.
An'd yes, you can take photographs in here.

1189
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:05,034
-I always wante'd to come here.
-Why?

1190
01:31:05,407 --> 01:31:07,841
My mother was born in New Orleans.

1191
01:31:10,712 --> 01:31:13,112
-Speak.
-Latte, I'm here!

1192
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:14,648
What took you so long?

1193
01:31:15,117 --> 01:31:20,350
Now, yall can buy your souvenirs from the
souvenir stan'd over there after the tour.

1194
01:31:20,655 --> 01:31:24,989
This is the famous Beauregar'd staircase.

1195
01:31:25,127 --> 01:31:29,427
Unfortunately, the secon'd floor isnt
open to us because of renovations...

1196
01:31:29,498 --> 01:31:34,435
...but lm sure well all be more than
satisfie'd with the family heirlooms...

1197
01:31:34,503 --> 01:31:37,404
...were fixin to see 'downstairs.

1198
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,705
Fred and I arrived in New Orleans...

1199
01:31:40,776 --> 01:31:44,143
...and found a guy in the Big Easy
who really wasn't that easy.

1200
01:31:44,212 --> 01:31:46,237
Why are you busting our chops?

1201
01:31:46,314 --> 01:31:51,377
-Ill tell ya. I hate cops an awful lot.
-Im gonna kill him.

1202
01:31:51,453 --> 01:31:54,684
An'd it 'doesnt matter that this is
a life-an'd-'death issue?

1203
01:31:54,956 --> 01:31:55,923
Nope.

1204
01:31:55,991 --> 01:31:59,392
Do you want us to bribe you with money?

1205
01:31:59,494 --> 01:32:00,586
Nope.

1206
01:32:01,263 --> 01:32:05,029
-You want to see me nake'd?
-Now, thats an i'dea.

1207
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:07,462
What 'do you think, Fre'd?

1208
01:32:07,536 --> 01:32:12,473
I think thats a US Co'de violation,
Section 616, Subparagraph 5A.

1209
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:15,635
-What woul'd that be?
-Sexual Harassment of a Peace Officer.

1210
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:17,735
-Exactly what I thought.
-Okay, you win.

1211
01:32:17,813 --> 01:32:22,147
She bought tour tickets:
plantation, mansion, wante'd to see Tara.

1212
01:32:22,517 --> 01:32:24,280
Come on, I 'dare you.

1213
01:32:26,655 --> 01:32:29,146
Yall follow me back to the gar'dens...

1214
01:32:29,224 --> 01:32:32,057
...where well view
the jasmine-covere'd gazebo.

1215
01:32:32,727 --> 01:32:35,628
Watch your step, now.
Flagstone is slippery.

1216
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:43,162
Look.

1217
01:32:44,506 --> 01:32:46,030
Its a beautiful...

1218
01:32:46,241 --> 01:32:47,708
...be'droom.

1219
01:32:51,313 --> 01:32:53,474
I just thought it woul'd be great to...

1220
01:32:53,615 --> 01:32:56,709
...be alone in a tra'ditional
Southern be'droom with....

1221
01:32:57,219 --> 01:32:58,686
No equipment.

1222
01:32:59,321 --> 01:33:00,720
Just us.

1223
01:33:01,223 --> 01:33:02,952
No party tricks.

1224
01:33:04,192 --> 01:33:05,921
You okay with that?

1225
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:15,869
This lovely garden
and charming tennis court...

1226
01:33:15,937 --> 01:33:18,599
...was the site
of Mr. Beauregard's wedding...

1227
01:33:18,673 --> 01:33:22,268
...to the exquisite Miss Ophelia Prescott.

1228
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:25,038
One of the most extravagant nuptials
for the period...

1229
01:33:25,113 --> 01:33:28,480
...it epitomized the Romantic Era.

1230
01:33:37,559 --> 01:33:39,049
You okay?

1231
01:33:39,394 --> 01:33:40,952
Yeah, its....

1232
01:33:41,029 --> 01:33:43,827
I feel a little awkwar'd in this position.

1233
01:34:03,718 --> 01:34:05,208
Just relax.

1234
01:34:48,363 --> 01:34:51,355
At 3:45, a tourist spotted a man
fitting Omar's description...

1235
01:34:51,433 --> 01:34:53,196
...outside the Beauregard Mansion.

1236
01:34:57,405 --> 01:34:58,963
He was dressed to kill.

1237
01:34:59,174 --> 01:35:03,076
Every time you want a job 'done properly,
you have to 'do it yourself.

1238
01:35:06,481 --> 01:35:09,973
Omar was running out of time,
and he was running out of accents.

1239
01:35:10,118 --> 01:35:12,416
Hi, I won'der if you coul'd help me.

1240
01:35:14,856 --> 01:35:16,881
Hi, I won'der if you coul'd help me.

1241
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:19,756
Di'd you see a young couple
come in here a while back?

1242
01:35:19,828 --> 01:35:21,955
Shes very pretty, re'd'dish-brown hair.

1243
01:35:22,030 --> 01:35:24,260
Shes my cousin Annabelle
an'd her boyfrien'd.

1244
01:35:24,332 --> 01:35:27,096
Perhaps if you bought a fan.

1245
01:35:27,168 --> 01:35:29,966
Sure, III buy a fan. Ill have that one.

1246
01:35:30,171 --> 01:35:33,038
We have to leave this place
exactly how we foun'd it.

1247
01:35:33,208 --> 01:35:34,732
Yeah, sure.

1248
01:35:40,982 --> 01:35:42,643
This shoul'd be it.

1249
01:35:49,557 --> 01:35:50,888
Excuse me.

1250
01:35:57,265 --> 01:35:59,324
Mr. Tillington, what are you 'doing here?

1251
01:35:59,401 --> 01:36:03,360
Actually, lm here to take
Mr. Slaters camera an'd all his film.

1252
01:36:03,605 --> 01:36:04,594
Why?

1253
01:36:04,673 --> 01:36:07,540
You were unfortunate enough
to take a rare photograph of me.

1254
01:36:07,642 --> 01:36:11,510
In fact, the only photograph taken of me
since the thir'd gra'de.

1255
01:36:11,579 --> 01:36:13,376
The guy at the baggage claim!

1256
01:36:13,815 --> 01:36:14,907
The camera.

1257
01:36:15,016 --> 01:36:17,541
-Go 'downstairs, Lisa.
-You sit still.

1258
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:19,650
The camera.

1259
01:36:20,922 --> 01:36:22,549
-Theres the tour.
-Yeah.

1260
01:36:22,624 --> 01:36:23,989
The camera!

1261
01:36:45,714 --> 01:36:47,341
-Take this si'de?
-You bet!

1262
01:36:47,415 --> 01:36:48,609
Police!

1263
01:36:48,883 --> 01:36:51,374
Look, theyre reenacting something.

1264
01:36:52,721 --> 01:36:54,313
Police! Out of the way!

1265
01:36:54,422 --> 01:36:56,219
Look, that woman has a gun.

1266
01:36:56,691 --> 01:36:58,318
Is she on our tour?

1267
01:37:11,072 --> 01:37:12,061
Hol'd it!

1268
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:31,252
I 'di'dnt. I swear, I coul'dnt.

1269
01:37:31,826 --> 01:37:34,420
Sorry lm late.
I got hung up on the wisteria.

1270
01:37:38,032 --> 01:37:40,626
-Police! You okay?
-Yeah.

1271
01:37:41,736 --> 01:37:43,203
Sheila, 'duck!

1272
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:52,842
Reenactment, my ass!

1273
01:37:53,314 --> 01:37:54,542
Partner!

1274
01:37:55,683 --> 01:37:57,275
You look like Eva Marie Saint.

1275
01:37:57,352 --> 01:38:00,446
Go'd, Fre'd, youre goo'd.

1276
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:05,156
LAPD! Hi!

1277
01:38:05,627 --> 01:38:09,063
Were tourists here, too!
Were really enjoying Louisiana!

1278
01:38:09,197 --> 01:38:11,688
We love New Orleans! Who 'dat?

1279
01:38:12,233 --> 01:38:15,669
Omar survived the fall with
two broken legs, two gunshot wounds...

1280
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:17,533
...and he's now in traction.

1281
01:38:18,673 --> 01:38:22,439
His photograph was
in over 65 newspapers, in color.

1282
01:38:25,747 --> 01:38:27,476
Summers. Whos Summers?

1283
01:38:27,549 --> 01:38:30,177
-Home with Mom an'd Da'd like you?
-Get out of there!

1284
01:38:30,251 --> 01:38:33,414
-You say he was trying to steal your purse?
-He 'di'd take my purse.

1285
01:38:33,688 --> 01:38:36,851
An'd when you woul'dnt give it to him,
he punche'd you.

1286
01:38:36,925 --> 01:38:40,190
An'd when I was laying on the floor,
he took my wallet an'd my keys.

1287
01:38:40,261 --> 01:38:44,061
-Di'd you get a goo'd look at him?
-Of course I 'di'd! It was my husban'd!

1288
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:45,599
Why are you still with him?

1289
01:38:45,667 --> 01:38:49,433
Everything is in his name: the house,
the car. Where am I suppose'd to live?

1290
01:38:49,504 --> 01:38:52,564
-How will I survive?
-I 'dont know how you survive'd this long.

1291
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,403
Its your fourth time this month.

1292
01:38:54,475 --> 01:38:57,501
Stop letting this man control your life.

1293
01:38:57,579 --> 01:38:59,103
You okay, la'dy?

1294
01:39:00,315 --> 01:39:03,716
But I 'dont even know if you can tell
its Omar. I was shooting blin'd.

1295
01:39:03,785 --> 01:39:07,050
Well 'develop it an'd let you know.
Thanks for all your help, okay?

1296
01:39:07,255 --> 01:39:09,723
-Hes all yours.
-I'd like to take that statement.

1297
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:11,986
-Okay.
-Miss Emerson, you all right?

1298
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:14,025
-Yes, I woul'd like to go.
-Sure.

1299
01:39:14,095 --> 01:39:18,088
-Ill 'do my statement. It wont take long.
-I want to go back to the hotel.

1300
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:22,830
Listen, well just be 'down the hall.
You can ask for the squa'd room. All right?

1301
01:39:23,137 --> 01:39:24,434
Come on, Fre'd.

1302
01:39:24,806 --> 01:39:26,296
Fre'd, come on.

1303
01:39:28,243 --> 01:39:30,074
-Why?
-Come on, Fre'd!

1304
01:39:31,012 --> 01:39:34,209
You know, youve gotten real bossy
since that 'damn islan'd.

1305
01:39:34,849 --> 01:39:36,942
-You okay?
-Just tire'd.

1306
01:39:37,886 --> 01:39:40,320
I thought I was going to lose you.

1307
01:39:42,123 --> 01:39:44,114
I love you, Lisa Emerson.

1308
01:39:48,129 --> 01:39:51,189
-I really nee'd to get out of this buil'ding.
-Okay.

1309
01:39:51,266 --> 01:39:54,326
Ill meet you back at the hotel,

1310
01:40:32,507 --> 01:40:33,838
Taxi!

1311
01:40:46,821 --> 01:40:48,880
Sheila, hi.

1312
01:40:51,025 --> 01:40:53,016
-Bonnie, how are you?
-Great.

1313
01:40:53,094 --> 01:40:56,359
If you see Fre'd, woul'd you tell him
lm 'double-parke'd outsi'de?

1314
01:40:56,431 --> 01:40:57,830
I sure will.

1321
01:41:11,412 --> 01:41:13,846
I got that stuff faxe'd,

1322
01:41:13,915 --> 01:41:15,678
Your ex-wife is here.

1323
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:18,514
Shes outsi'de.
What is she 'doing in New Orleans?

1324
01:41:18,586 --> 01:41:20,178
I flew her in for the weeken'd.

1325
01:41:20,254 --> 01:41:23,951
Were actually talking about maybe
taking a shot at putting it back together.

1326
01:41:24,025 --> 01:41:25,253
Thats nice.

1327

1328
01:41:30,631 --> 01:41:32,292

Thanks.

1331
01:41:39,674 --> 01:41:42,404
Why are we preten'ding
that your bag isnt buzzing?

1332
01:41:42,477 --> 01:41:44,877
-You bought a vibrator!
-Just a razor.

1333
01:41:44,946 --> 01:41:46,971
-Fre'd got a vibrator!
-Just a little....

1334

-Di'd you get it on the islan'd?
-Yes.

1336
01:41:52,687 --> 01:41:55,952
They ha'd a 'discount for employees.

1337
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:58,815
-See you back in LA, partner.
-All right.

1338
01:41:58,893 --> 01:42:00,884
Im ovulating.

1339
01:42:01,896 --> 01:42:04,524
An egg was just release'd
into my fallopian tube.

1340
01:42:04,599 --> 01:42:07,659
Another one just 'droppe'd.
Its in my uterus.

1341
01:42:11,606 --> 01:42:13,403
I love that guy.

1342
01:42:21,849 --> 01:42:22,747
Hello?

1343
01:42:22,817 --> 01:42:25,012
-Hello, Mr. Slater.
-Oh, it's you.

1344
01:42:25,319 --> 01:42:27,014
Try to control your excitement.

1345
01:42:27,088 --> 01:42:30,615
You left your broken camera
here at the station.

1346
01:42:31,192 --> 01:42:33,126
You can sen'd it over to me.

1347
01:42:34,429 --> 01:42:36,590
-She left?
-How'd you know?

1348
01:42:37,265 --> 01:42:40,701
I can hear it in your voice. Im sorry.

1349
01:42:40,802 --> 01:42:43,134
She left a note.
She went back to the islan'd.

1350
01:42:43,204 --> 01:42:45,069
I have to go to the island tomorrow.

1351
01:42:45,139 --> 01:42:50,076
They foun'd your film. If you want to
hop a ri'de with me, III see what I can 'do.

1352
01:42:51,979 --> 01:42:55,881
I 'di'dnt hear what you sai'd. Di'd you say....
Coul'd you hol'd on a secon'd?

1353
01:42:58,119 --> 01:42:59,711
I am on the phone here.

1354
01:42:59,787 --> 01:43:03,518
Sugar, calm 'down.
Youre gonna have yourself a heart attack.

1355
01:43:05,326 --> 01:43:06,987
Sugar, calm 'down.

1356
01:43:07,261 --> 01:43:08,421
Hello?

1357
01:43:10,398 --> 01:43:12,059

1358
01:43:31,452 --> 01:43:32,919
Mistress Lisa!

1359
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:37,955
Theres a visitor here to see you.

1360
01:43:40,795 --> 01:43:43,229
-Heres the film.
-Thank you very much.

1361
01:43:43,331 --> 01:43:46,164
-Thank you for saving my life.
-Got a minute?

1362
01:43:46,534 --> 01:43:47,523
Sure.

1363
01:43:48,436 --> 01:43:51,928
This is none of my business,
an'd you can tell me to butt out.

1364
01:43:52,006 --> 01:43:53,940
Elliot tol'd me what happene'd.

1365
01:43:54,108 --> 01:43:55,370
Butt out.

1366
01:43:55,443 --> 01:43:57,741
You two seeme'd to have
something special.

1367
01:43:57,812 --> 01:43:59,780
You sai'd I coul'd tell you to butt out.

1368
01:43:59,847 --> 01:44:02,680
I sai'd you coul'd tell me.
I 'di'dnt say that I woul'd 'do it.

1369
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:05,218
You think I came all this way
just to get the film?

1370
01:44:05,286 --> 01:44:07,220
Havent you hear'd of Fe'deral Express?

1371
01:44:07,588 --> 01:44:09,283
Why 'di'd you come?

1372
01:44:09,357 --> 01:44:11,552
I wante'd to talk to you about Elliot.

1373
01:44:11,626 --> 01:44:13,389
Theres nothing to talk about.

1374
01:44:13,461 --> 01:44:15,429
Lisa, listen to me.

1375
01:44:16,030 --> 01:44:20,228
-Lisa, Miss, Ma'dam, Dominatrix....
-Wait, you listen to me.

1376
01:44:21,702 --> 01:44:23,966
You saw those women at the station?

1377
01:44:24,038 --> 01:44:25,266
Sure, I saw.

1378
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:27,430
You know what they all ha'd in common?

1379
01:44:27,508 --> 01:44:29,203
They all gave up control.

1380
01:44:29,277 --> 01:44:34,214
Come on, you cant run your life from a
couple of poor souls 'down at a precinct.

1381
01:44:34,515 --> 01:44:38,042
I know a lot of women
involve'd in healthy relationships.

1382
01:44:39,153 --> 01:44:41,451
Youre kin'd of corny for a cop.

1383
01:44:41,722 --> 01:44:44,987
Listen, lve ha'd my share
of ba'd times with men, okay?

1384
01:44:45,059 --> 01:44:47,459
Some are assholes, Elliot is not.

1385
01:44:48,095 --> 01:44:51,997
If we 'dont cultivate the goo'd ones,
there arent gonna be any.

1386
01:44:52,733 --> 01:44:54,894
Im sorry, I have to go.

1387
01:44:56,070 --> 01:45:00,268
For what its worth, Elliot tol'd me to
tell you theres an ol'd Australian saying:

1388
01:45:00,341 --> 01:45:02,673
It aint over till the fat kangaroo sings.

1389
01:45:08,683 --> 01:45:10,514
Bye, Mistress Lisa.

1390
01:45:14,855 --> 01:45:18,291
Im going to take a nap.
I 'dont want to be 'disturbe'd.

1391
01:45:18,993 --> 01:45:21,689
-Why are you smiling?
-No reason at all.

1392
01:45:40,348 --> 01:45:41,747
You look....

1393
01:45:42,116 --> 01:45:44,516
I came back to get 'down on one knee
an'd propose.

1394
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:47,552
But it seems over'done,
so I thought I'd try it this way.

1395
01:45:49,924 --> 01:45:51,892
Will you marry me?

1396
01:45:56,964 --> 01:46:01,424
You mean, like, leave here,
meet your parents...

1397
01:46:01,502 --> 01:46:03,402
...buy a con'do, holi'days?

1398
01:46:04,405 --> 01:46:05,599
You want me to cook?

1399
01:46:05,673 --> 01:46:08,972
No, our marriage, love...

1400
01:46:09,176 --> 01:46:12,009
...family, fantasy, erotic,
whatever we 'deci'de.

1401
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:16,106
Can you help me?
Diana tie'd this a little too tight.

1402
01:46:17,051 --> 01:46:20,111
-Babies an'd bon'dage, I coul'd 'do both?
-Yeah.

1403
01:46:20,254 --> 01:46:22,484
I'd love to say, My wife is a 'dominatrix.

1404
01:46:22,556 --> 01:46:25,389
I coul'd just see myself at the ki'ds school
on career 'day.

1405
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:29,391
-I left New Orleans because--
-I 'dont want to know.

1406
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:31,855
Im gonna love you forever.

1407
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,260
-Even if lm scare'd?
-Even if youre petrifie'd.

1408
01:46:45,846 --> 01:46:47,245
Ill see you on the plane.

1409
01:46:47,315 --> 01:46:51,183
-I love'd all the citizens: Art, Shawn--
-Thank you so much, really.

1410
01:46:51,952 --> 01:46:53,510
Sheila Kingston. Thank you.

1411
01:46:53,587 --> 01:46:54,815
Sheila.

1412
01:46:56,057 --> 01:46:58,787
I was rea'dy to catch the boat.
I wante'd to say goo'd-bye.

1413
01:46:58,859 --> 01:47:00,986
You look really goo'd in clothes.

1414
01:47:01,062 --> 01:47:02,996
-What happene'd to your han'd?
-Nothing.

1415
01:47:03,064 --> 01:47:05,624
I 'di'dnt recognize you
without your thong an'd chains.

1416
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:08,328
-Di'd you get fire'd?
-No, I 'dont work here.

1417
01:47:08,402 --> 01:47:12,236
I come here a couple of times a year
just for a little fun an'd relaxation.

1418
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:14,664
Sure, I see.

1419
01:47:15,242 --> 01:47:17,802
One of my factories is in Los Angeles...

1420
01:47:17,878 --> 01:47:20,403
-...where I hear youre with the police.
-Yes, I am.

1421
01:47:21,549 --> 01:47:25,451
I won'der if maybe
we coul'd have 'dinner sometime?

1422
01:47:27,054 --> 01:47:28,715
-Really?
-Yeah.

1423
01:47:30,758 --> 01:47:33,022
I 'dont know.
I never really thought about it.

1424
01:47:33,094 --> 01:47:34,789
Take my car'd.

1425
01:47:36,564 --> 01:47:38,031
Youre a CEO.

1426
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:40,164
Yes, I am.

1427
01:47:40,234 --> 01:47:43,726
-This is the final boarding call.
-I have to go catch the plane.

1428
01:47:43,938 --> 01:47:46,270
-You look great.
-You look great.

1429
01:47:47,141 --> 01:47:48,870
-Bye.
-Ill see you.

1430
01:48:07,728 --> 01:48:08,786
Bye.

1431
01:48:09,897 --> 01:48:10,955
Bye.

1432
01:48:13,167 --> 01:48:16,728
-Di'd you see that?
-C'est I'amour de jeunesse.

1433
01:48:17,671 --> 01:48:19,536
Au revoir. Croissant.

1434
01:48:28,115 --> 01:48:30,879
You know, I have always ha'd this fantasy...

1435
01:48:31,552 --> 01:48:34,988
...about being with a kin'd man.

1436
01:48:35,356 --> 01:48:37,916
With an incre'dible derriere.

1437
01:48:39,026 --> 01:48:40,653
So, I'm a matchmaker.

1438
01:48:40,928 --> 01:48:43,692
Lisa and Elliot are getting married
on July 4.

1439
01:48:43,764 --> 01:48:48,201
To send a present, they're registered
at Tiffany's in the leather department.

1440
01:48:48,402 --> 01:48:50,597
Nina Blackstone is serving time in prison.

1441
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:53,572
I hear she calls the bingo game
every Friday night:

1442
01:48:53,641 --> 01:48:55,040
"B-14."

1443
01:48:55,543 --> 01:48:56,942
"N-21."

1444
01:48:58,212 --> 01:49:01,272
Omar got three life sentences,
and with our parole system...

1445
01:49:01,348 --> 01:49:04,010
...will probably be out in three months.

1446
01:49:04,084 --> 01:49:06,552
I'm on my second date
with CEO Tommy Miller.

1447
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:08,952
He helped my fantasies
come true last Saturday...

1448
01:49:09,023 --> 01:49:12,186
...by sending over four men
who painted my house.

1449
01:49:12,993 --> 01:49:14,984
What did I learn from this case?

1450
01:49:15,062 --> 01:49:19,590
No matter what your sexual preference,
true love is still the ultimate fantasy.

1451
01:53:03,691 --> 01:53:05,318
l-14.

1452
01:53:06,226 --> 01:53:07,591
B-6.

1453
01:53:08,662 --> 01:53:10,755
G-Whiz.

1454
01:53:13,667 --> 01:53:15,635
Listen, all of you people out there...

1455
01:53:15,703 --> 01:53:17,568
...don't kill anyone.

1456
01:53:17,638 --> 01:53:19,435
Prison stinks.
