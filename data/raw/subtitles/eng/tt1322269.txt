<i>Beverly Weston:
"Life is very long..."</i>

2
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,683
<i>TS Eliot.</i>

3
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:27,674
<i>Not the first person to say it,</i>

4
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:29,851
<i>certainly not the first
person to think it.</i>

5
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:33,335
<i>But he's given credit for it because
he bothered to write it down.</i>

6
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:40,607
<i>Now, if you say it,
you have to say his name after it.</i>

7
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:44,535
<i>"Life is very long:" TS Eliot.</i>

8
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:46,585
<i>Absolutely, goddamn right.</i>

9
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:53,484
Violet.

10
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:56,234
My wife.

11
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:58,499
She takes pills,

12
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:02,028
sometimes a great many.

13
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:06,266
The facts are:

14
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:08,449
my wife takes pills and I drink.

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,949
That's the bargain we've struck, a
little paragraph of our marriage contract...

16
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,155
Rather than..

17
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,974
once more vow abstinence
with my fingers crossed.

18
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:24,905
I've chosen to turn my life over
to a Higher Power..

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,941
and join the ranks
of the Hiring Class.

20
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:35,297
It's not a decision with
which I'm entirely comfortable.

21
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,396
I mean, I know how to launder my..

22
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:41,202
...dirty undies.
Done it all my life,

23
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:48,567
but I'm finding that it's getting
in the way of my drinking.

24
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:50,958
Violet: Bev?

25
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,186
Yes.

26
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:54,624
Did...

27
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:57,332
..you..?

28
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:02,434
Oh, goddamn it!

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,403
Are the police here?
- Could you come here?

30
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:15,835
Oh. Hello.

31
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:19,909
Johnna, the young woman
I told you about.

32
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,801
You tell me she's a woman.

33
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:26,121
Wo-man. Wo-man.

34
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:27,545
Whoa-man.

35
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,913
That I'm hiring --
- Oh,

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,333
you hire women's now the thing.

37
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:34,131
I thought you meant the other.

38
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:37,229
To cook and clean,
carry you to the clinic..

39
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,656
Hello.
- Hello.

40
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:44,073
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,302
Like this.

42
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:47,802
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:53,015
You're very pretty.

44
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,515
Thank you.

45
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:57,392
Are you an<i> Injun</i>?

46
00:02:57,393 --> 00:02:59,966
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:03,640
What kind?
- Cheyenne.

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,790
Do you think I'm pretty?

49
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,290
Like this?

50
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:16,539
Like..
- Careful...Careful...!

51
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:27,352
I'm sorry,
I took some...

52
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:29,772
medicine for my mumm...

53
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,188
for my mus...

54
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:37,067
My muscular.

55
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:39,404
..for my muscular.

56
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,433
Why don't you go back to bed,
sweetheart?

57
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:45,638
Why don't you go fuck
a fucking sow's ass?

58
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:47,685
All right.

59
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,990
Oh..

60
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,662
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,361
I'll be sickly sweet.

62
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,676
sickly sweet.

63
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:12,937
I'm so sweet.

64
00:04:19,373 --> 00:04:21,052
I'm so..

65
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,337
In-el-a...

66
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:28,130
In-el-abrially sweet.

67
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:34,030
We keep unusual hours here.

68
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:37,140
My wife has been diagnosed
with a touch of..

69
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:41,220
cancer and she'll need to be driven
to Tulsa for her final..

70
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:43,069
chemotherapy treatments.

71
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:45,142
What kind of cancer?

72
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:48,095
Ah, My God, I nearly
neglected the punch line:

73
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:49,784
mouth cancer.

74
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,947
Do you have any questions?

75
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,533
What pills does she take?
- Ohhh..

76
00:04:57,816 --> 00:04:59,560
Valium. Vicodin.

77
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:03,979
Darvon, Darvocet. Percodan,
Percocet..

78
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,617
Xanax for fun.

79
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:08,447
OxyContin in a pinch.

80
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:13,930
And of course, Diluadid.
I can't forget Diluadid.

81
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:19,292
My last refuge, my books..

82
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,395
simple pleasures,

83
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:25,993
like finding..

84
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:31,436
wild onions by the side of a road,
or requited love.

85
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,911
Oh here..

86
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,205
Here, TS Eliot.

87
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,408
Read it or not.
It's not a job requirement

88
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:45,892
just for your enjoyment.

89
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,436
Here we go,
round the prickly pear...

90
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:59,215
Prickly pear prickly pear...

91
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:03,844
ere we go,
round the prickly pear...

Mom..

96
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,775
Mom...!

97
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:38,302
You didn't hear the phone?

98
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,376
If it's your father,
tell him to fuck off.

99
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,954
It's Aunt Ivy,

100
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:45,922
from Oklahoma.

101
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,227
...Ivy?

102
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:58,181
..what's wrong?

103
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:04,201
..When...?

104
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,917
What'd you tell Barb?

105
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:31,860
I told her Dad was missing.

106
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:36,322
Goddamn your father,
for putting me through this.

107
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:37,843
Seen that office of his?

108
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,317
He hired this Indian for some goddamn reason
and now I have a stranger in my house.

109
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:45,226
What's her name?

110
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:46,726
Johnna.

111
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,883
I can't handle this all by myself!

112
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,541
I called Karen.

113
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:54,635
Oh..

114
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:59,323
Yeah, What did she say?
- She said she'd try to get here.

115
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,608
She'll be a big fat help,

116
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:03,722
just like you.

117
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:09,259
I need Barb.

118
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,767
What's Barb going to be able to do?

119
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,053
What did you do to your hair?

120
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:21,498
I had it straightened.
- Why would anybody do that?

121
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:23,080
I just wanted a change.

122
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:24,743
You're a pretty girl.

123
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,883
Why don't you wear makeup?

124
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:28,082
Do I need makeup?

125
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,839
Every women needs makeup.

126
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,416
Don't let anybody tell you different.
The only woman..

127
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,454
pretty enough to go without makeup
was Elizabeth Taylor.

128
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:40,324
and she wore a ton.

129
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,921
Your shoulders are slumped and
your hair's all straighten out..

130
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:44,858
..and you don't wear makeup.
You look like a lesbian.

131
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,194
Mom.

132
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:48,607
You could get a decent man
if you spruced up.A bit,

133
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,789
that's all I'm saying.

134
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,790
I'm not looking for a man.

135
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:05,380
How many was that?

136
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:07,950
I wasn't counting.

137
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:17,992
Is your mouth burning?

138
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:21,557
Like a son-of-a-bitch.
My tongue is on fire.

139
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,538
Are you supposed to be smoking?

140
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,659
Is anybody <i>supposed</i> to smoke?

141
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:37,735
Are you scared?

142
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,567
Course I'm scared.

143
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,728
And you are a comfort, sweetheart.

144
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:01,867
Thank God one of my girls stayed
close to home.

145
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,943
In my day..

146
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:07,009
family stayed together.

147
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:12,478
Aunt Mattie Fae's here.
- She means to come in here..

148
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,356
..and tell me what's what.

149
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,004
I don't know how Uncle Charlie
puts up with it.

150
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,812
He smokes a lot of grass.

151
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,065
He does?

152
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,356
He smokes <i>a lot</i> of grass.

153
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:30,790
I told Vi, "Take all those goddamn books
 he's so fond of..

154
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,805
..and make a big pile in the front
yard and have yourself a bonfire."

155
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:36,121
You don't burn a man's books.

156
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:38,292
You do, if the situation
calls for it.

157
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,092
The man's books didn't do anything.

158
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:46,614
You get any ideas about just up and taking off,
Charlie Aiken, you better believe..

159
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:47,812
..that i'd have your..
- I'm not going anywhere.

160
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:50,328
I'm saying if you did,

161
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:54,903
I'll give you two days to get your head straight.
Then it's all going up in a blaze of glory.

162
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:58,410
Not that, you have any
books lying around.

163
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,585
I don't think I've ever seen you
read a book in my life.

164
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:02,125
That bother you?

165
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:04,283
What's the last book you read?

166
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:05,973
Beverly was a teacher;

167
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:09,064
teachers read books,
I'm in the upholstery business.

168
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:10,564
Ah, sweetheart.

169
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:13,388
Your daddy's done this before.

170
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:17,036
Just takes off, no call, nothing.

171
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,344
I told your mother,

172
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:22,294
"You pack that son-of-a-bitch's bags and have
em waiting for him on the front porch."

173
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:23,958
Where's your mother?

174
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,529
Upstairs.

175
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,143
He'll come back again,
I know he will,

176
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:38,768
he always does.

177
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,875
Beverly is a very complicated man.

178
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:43,069
Kind of like Charles.

179
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:46,638
Little Charles isn't complicated,
he's just unemployed.

180
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:49,833
You don't think that
Little Charles and

181
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:52,068
Beverly share some kind of...

182
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,737
..complication.

183
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:57,777
You have to be smart
to be complicated.

184
00:12:57,981 --> 00:13:00,047
Are you saying our boy isn't smart?

185
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:03,053
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

186
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:05,030
I'm sweating.

187
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:06,649
Why is it so dark in here?

188
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:10,605
Are you sweating?

189
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,652
Hell, yes, I'm sweating,

190
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,433
it's ninety degrees in here.

191
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:20,760
Feel my back.

192
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:21,959
I don't want to feel your back.

193
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,149
Sweat is just dripping down my back.
- I believe you.

194
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,649
Feel it.
- No.

195
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,230
Come on, put your hand here.
- Goddamn it --

196
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:32,117
Sweat's just dripping...

197
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,490
Ivy, when did this start?

198
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,757
This business with
taping the shades?

199
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,426
Been a couple of years now.

200
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,175
Do you know its purpose?

201
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:50,322
You can't tell if
it's night or day.

202
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:53,515
I think that's the purpose.

203
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,189
What were these people thinking...

204
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:04,118
The jokers who settled this place.

205
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:09,572
Who was the asshole, looked at flat
hot nothing and planted his flag?

206
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:11,391
I mean..

207
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,773
we fucked the Indians for this?
- Well, genocide,

208
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:16,551
always seems like such a good idea
at the time.

209
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:19,173
Right, you need a little hindsight.

210
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,062
If you want me to explain the creepy
character of the Midwest,

211
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:23,156
Please, the Midwest.

212
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:25,911
This is the Plains.

213
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:31,664
A state of mind, A spiritual
affliction, like the Blues.

214
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:39,244
Don't.

215
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:56,580
What are you doing?

216
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:02,646
Scuse me, dear...could I trouble you
for another beer?

217
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:04,431
Goddam it, she's not a waitress.

218
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:06,986
I'll get it.

219
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:10,111
I know that.

220
00:15:10,981 --> 00:15:12,631
Then, get your own beer.

221
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:15,906
I don't believe you.

222
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:18,472
Watchin' a ball game,
drinkin' beers.

223
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,996
You have any sense of
what's going on around you?

224
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:24,139
Am I supposed to sit
here like a statue?

225
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,783
You're drinking whiskey.

226
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:27,970
I'm having a cocktail.

227
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,711
You're drinking straight whiskey!

228
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:33,880
Just...

229
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:35,934
Have a little class.

230
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,221
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

231
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,552
You've encouraged that.

232
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:56,480
I haven't encouraged anything.
- You admire her for getting hooked at fourteen,

233
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,067
makes her seem even more mature.

234
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:03,545
Goddamn, it's hot.

235
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:07,811
Suppose your mom's turned on
the air conditioner?

236
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:09,568
You kidding?
Remember the parakeets?

237
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,779
The parakeets?

238
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,361
I didn't tell you
about the parakeets?

239
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:18,773
She got a parakeet, for some insane reason
 and the little fucker croaked after two days.

240
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:20,864
So, she went to the pet store
and raised hell,

241
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:23,743
and they gave her another one.
That one died after a day.

242
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:27,419
Then, she went back and they gave her
a third parakeet. That one died too.

243
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,972
So, the chick from the pet store came
out here to see just what in the hell

244
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:35,355
this, serial parakeet killer was
doing to bump off these birds.

245
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:36,553
And?

246
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:37,659
The heat.

247
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,708
It was too hot.
They were dying from the heat.

248
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,907
Jesus.

249
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:43,106
These are tropical birds,
all right?

250
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:46,675
I mean, They live in
the fucking tropics!

251
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:47,874
Mom?!

252
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,073
It's Barbara..it's Barb.

253
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,573
Barbara!

254
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:52,704
Oh my gosh!

255
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:53,903
You.

256
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:56,612
Come give me some sugar.

257
00:16:56,671 --> 00:17:00,374
Bill, look how skinny you are!

258
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:04,074
Will you look at this one?

259
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:06,081
Come here and give your Aunt Mattie
Fae some sugar!

260
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:07,280
Hi, Charlie.
- Hey Bill,

261
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:10,914
you've dropped some
weight, haven't you?

262
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:15,461
Look at her boobs! - Last time I saw..
<I>- How was the flight from Denver? </I>

263
00:17:15,462 --> 00:17:16,660
you looked like a little boy!

264
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,049
Barbara?

265
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,695
Hey, Mom. I'm here!

266
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:25,905
Barb...Barb..Barb..
- It's okay, Mom.I'm here.

267
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,878
Saturday morning.

268
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:33,928
The Indian girl made us biscuits and gravy.
We ate some,

269
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,452
he walked out the door,
this door right there.

270
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:41,916
That was it.

271
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:43,844
He just left...?

272
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:46,202
uh, huh.

273
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,018
I went to bed Saturday night,

274
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,515
got up Sunday mornin'

275
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,753
... still no Beverly.

276
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:58,360
I didn't make much of it,

277
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:01,147
thought he'd gone out on a bender.

278
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:04,254
Why would he do that?
When, he can drink at home.

279
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:08,546
Unless, you were riding his ass.
- I never said a word to him..

280
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,444
about his drinking, I didn't.
I never got on him about it.

281
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:12,944
So, Sunday,

282
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:16,652
still no sign of him...
- That's when I got worked up about that,

283
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,328
safety deposit box. Because..

284
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:24,695
We kept an awful lot of cash in
that box, some expensive jewelry.

285
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:25,701
I had a..

286
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:30,555
diamond ring in that box appraised
at over seven thousand dollars.

287
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:32,306
Wait, wait, wait,
I'm missing something.

288
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,372
Why do you care about a safety
deposit box?

289
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:36,472
Your father and I
had an arrangement.

290
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:41,886
If something were to ever happen to one of us,
the other one would go empty that box.

291
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:46,262
Vi, you sure there wasn't some incident
that triggered his leaving, some event.

292
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:48,070
like a fight?
- Yeah. - No.

293
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,671
And we fought enough...
you know... but no.

294
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:57,061
Maybe he needed some
time away from you.

295
00:18:57,191 --> 00:18:59,790
Oh, That's nice of you to say.

296
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,515
Hey, it's no crime.

297
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,025
Marriage is hard.

298
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:05,886
Under the best of circumstances.

299
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,548
So..

300
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,894
Nothing? No,<i> 'see you later,
I'm taking a walk'</i>?

301
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,801
Mmmmhm.

302
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:19,029
Good old unfathomable Dad.

303
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:23,505
Oh. That man. Oh..

304
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,701
What I first fell in love with,
you know, was his mystery.

305
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,177
I thought it was sexy as hell.

306
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:37,181
You knew he was the smartest one in the room,
knew if he just said something...

307
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:43,673
knock you out.
But No, he'd just stand there,

308
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:45,333
little smile on his face...

309
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:48,070
not say a word.

310
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:53,902
Sexy.

311
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:58,140
You can't remember
anything unusual --

312
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,837
He hired this woman.

313
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:07,259
He didn't ask me, just hired this woman to come
live in our house. Few days before he left.

314
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,928
You don't want her here?

315
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:10,628
I have an <i>Indian</i> in my house.

316
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,425
You have a problem
with Indians, Violet?

317
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:16,012
I don't know what to say to an Indian.
- They're called Native Americans, Mom.

318
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,662
Who makes that decision?
- It's what they like to be called.

319
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:22,145
They aren't any more native than me.
- In fact,

320
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:25,371
..they are.
- What's wrong with Indian?

321
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:26,709
Why can't you call people
what they wanna be called?

322
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,381
Let's just call the dinosaurs
"Native Americans" while we're at it.

323
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:36,049
She may be an Indian, but she makes
the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate.

324
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:40,616
He hired a cook.
It makes no sense. We don't eat.

325
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:43,351
And now you get biscuits and gravy.
Kind of nice, huh?

326
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:44,702
That is nice.

327
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,477
Nice for you, now.

328
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:48,151
But, soon you'll be gone,

329
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:50,676
never to return.

330
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:52,534
When was the last
time you were here?

331
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:53,776
Don't get started..
- Alright!

332
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:54,975
I don't care about you two.

333
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:58,064
But, I'd like to see my
granddaughter every now and again.

334
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,262
Well, you're seeing her now.

335
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,985
But your father.
You broke his heart when you moved away.

336
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:05,782
That is wildly unfair! -You know you were Beverly's favorite;
- Am I going to have to separate you two?

337
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:08,423
 ..don't pretend you don't know!

338
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:12,868
I'd prefer to think my parents loved
all their children equally.

339
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:21,617
I'm sure you'd prefer to think that Santy Claus
brought you presents at Christmas, too.

340
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:24,853
If you'd had more than one child, you'd know

341
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:26,582
a parent always has favorites.

342
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,227
Mattie Fae was my mother's favorite.
Big deal. I got used to it.

343
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:33,513
You were your Daddy's favorite.

344
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:36,353
Broke his heart.

345
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,450
What was I supposed to do?!

346
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:42,779
Colorado gave Bill twice what he's making at TU.
- Why are we even getting into this?

347
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,406
You think Daddy wouldn't have
jumped at an opportunity like that?

348
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:48,831
You're wrong there. You never would've
gotten Beverly Weston out of Oklahoma.

349
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:50,030
He gave me his blessing.

350
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:52,434
That's what he told you. Yeah..

351
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:56,720
And now, you're going to tell me the true story,
some terrible shit he said behind my back?

352
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:58,220
Alright, everybody's on edge..

353
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:01,646
Beverly didn't say terrible things behind your back
- Vi, come on!

354
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:05,805
He just told me he's disappointed
in you because you settled.

355
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,748
He thought you had talent,

356
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:11,415
..as a writer.

357
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,620
Daddy never said anything like that to you.

358
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:15,811
What a load of absolute horseshit.

359
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:17,201
horseshit.

360
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,414
Horseshit? Oh, horseshit,
let's all say horseshit.

361
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:25,325
Say horseshit, Bill.

362
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:29,342
Horseshit.

363
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,951
Are you high?
- Excuse me.

364
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:41,451
I mean literally.
You taking something?

365
00:22:43,604 --> 00:22:47,276
A muscle relaxer.
- You listen to me. I'll not go through this with you again.

366
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:48,468
I don't know what
you're talking about.

367
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:54,284
These fucking pills? Calls at three
AM about stars in your backyard?

368
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,751
This isn't..it isn't same thing.

369
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,089
I didn't have reason then.

370
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:02,721
So, it's okay to get hooked now
because you have a reason.

371
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:03,920
I'm not hooked on anything.

372
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:06,193
I don't want to know
if you are or not,

373
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:09,077
I'm just saying.. I'm not gonna
go through it again.

374
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:12,139
I'm not. I'm in pain!

375
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:14,602
Because of your mouth?

376
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:18,288
Yes, because my mouth burns.

377
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:19,627
I have got..

378
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:21,546
Cancer in my mouth.

379
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,673
And it burns, look.

380
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:25,031
Look.

381
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:28,370
And it burns like a... bullshit.

382
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:36,983
And Beverly's disappeared and
you're yelling at me.

383
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,483
I'm not..

384
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:47,896
You know, you couldn't come home
when I got cancer.

385
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:53,175
Beverlys disappeared..

386
00:23:55,262 --> 00:23:57,953
you rushed right back.

387
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,710
I'm sorry.

388
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:17,844
I'm sorry...

389
00:24:20,037 --> 00:24:22,400
You know where I think he is?

390
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:26,072
I think he..

391
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,617
I think he got some whiskey,
a carton of cigarettes, and

392
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,675
a couple of good spy novels...and..

393
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:36,052
I think he got out on the boat.

394
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:38,739
and steered it to a nice spot,
close to shore like he likes em.

395
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:44,923
and he's fishing, and reading
and drinking,

396
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:47,411
maybe even writing a little.

397
00:24:50,477 --> 00:24:52,006
And, I think..

398
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:54,154
he's gonna walk through that door..

399
00:24:56,713 --> 00:24:59,314
...any time.

400
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:06,282
Mom?

401
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,017
Mom, the sheriff's here.

402
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:10,517
What? Wha...

403
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,387
Hey, sweetheart.
Go back to bed.

404
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,278
What about Aunt Ivy?

405
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:02,705
I guess we'll stop on the way.

406
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:06,164
Christ, I have to call Karen too.

407
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,029
Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?

408
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,746
Izza story.

409
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:31,063
Barely's back.

410
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,682
Gizza cig...

411
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:39,313
cigezze?  Cig-zezz, cig-zizz...
- Ma'am?

412
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:41,834
Gizza cig...

413
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:44,332
Cig-zezz, cig-zizz...
some cigezze?

414
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,116
Cigz, cig-aa..

415
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:56,505
archa-tex?

416
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,787
I'm Inna bottom of them.

417
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:13,714
It's good beat, right?

418
00:28:13,743 --> 00:28:19,084
Barb..!

419
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:22,255
From the day I..

420
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:27,066
..the day..

421
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:38,549
Beverly..

422
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:42,131
and then..

423
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:47,101
and then you're here..

424
00:28:49,338 --> 00:28:51,834
And Barbara, you're here, and Beverly,
and then you're here, and then..

425
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:57,750
..you're here..

426
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,371
I used to go out with that boy.

427
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:11,057
That man.
- What man? The Sheriff?

428
00:29:11,745 --> 00:29:14,973
In high school.
He was my prom date.

429
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:18,834
You're kidding.

430
00:29:18,838 --> 00:29:21,199
Day of the prom, his father
got drunk and stole his car,

431
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:23,718
stole his own son's car,

432
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:26,381
went somewhere, Mexico.

433
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:31,187
Deon showed up at the house.
He'd been crying.

434
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:35,705
Confessed he didn't have a way
to take me to the prom.

435
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:37,856
So, we got a six-pack..

436
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:42,220
..and broke into the chapel, stayed
up all night talking and kissing.

437
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,526
And, now here he is,

438
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:49,438
..showing me.

439
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:52,076
It's so surreal.

440
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:56,841
Thank God we can't tell the future.
We'd never get out of bed.

441
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:14,689
Listen to me.

442
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,738
Die after me, all right?

443
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,193
I don't care what else you do,

444
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:29,242
where you go, how
you screw up your life, just...

445
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,222
Survive.

446
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,910
please.

447
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:12,025
Holy shit, that's Karen.

448
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:15,716
Do you remember your Aunt Karen?
- Kind of...

449
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:19,522
That must be this year's man.

450
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:06,888
I spent so much time
in our bedroom,

451
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:09,219
pretending my pillow
was my husband..

452
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,494
..and did he like the dinner I just made and
where were we going that winter on vacation..

453
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:17,478
..and then, he'd surprise me with
tickets to Belize and we'd kiss.

454
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:20,956
I mean I'd kiss my pillow!

455
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:24,548
and then I'd say that
I'd been to the doctor that I am..

456
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,048
maybe, I was pregnant.

457
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,367
I know how pathetic that sounds now,
but it was innocent enough.

458
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:33,308
Then real life kicks in,

459
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:35,805
Things don't work out
like you planned.

460
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,432
They never do..and then,

461
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,325
That pillow was a better husband
than any real man I'd ever met;

462
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,745
And you punish yourself and tell yourself
it's your fault you can't find a good one.

463
00:33:47,964 --> 00:33:50,409
I don't know how well you remember Andrew.
You remember Andrew?

464
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,569
No, I remember him.

465
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,067
I loved him.. so intensely,

466
00:33:54,068 --> 00:33:58,494
so, the things he did wrong, were just
opportunities for me to make 'em right.

467
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:01,045
When he'd cheat on me
or called me a cunt,

468
00:34:01,046 --> 00:34:04,222
I'd say, <i>"No, love is forever,</i>

469
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:06,940
<i>this is just an opportunity for me,</i>

470
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:09,809
<i>..to make an adjustment in the
way that I view the world."</i>

471
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,490
And thank God, one day I looked
in the mirror and said, "Moron,"

472
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:15,455
and I walked out.

473
00:34:15,456 --> 00:34:17,825
But, one day..
finally I said,

474
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:19,608
"It's me.

475
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:21,761
It's just me.

476
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,906
I don't need anything else,
I can live my life with myself."

477
00:34:26,016 --> 00:34:30,834
 And, that's how I got my license, I threw
myself into my work, sold a ton of houses,

478
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,334
..and that's how I met Steve.

479
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,208
That's how it works, Barb.

480
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,406
Ah, he's ten years older,

481
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:40,562
but he is such a thinker,

482
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:41,761
 ..and he's such a good man.

483
00:34:41,762 --> 00:34:45,221
He's such a good heart
and he's good for me.

484
00:34:45,222 --> 00:34:49,148
I guess, the best thing
about him, for me,

485
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,186
...is that now..

486
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:53,204
..what I think about is now.

487
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:55,232
I live now.

488
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:58,878
My focus, my life, my world is now.

489
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:03,173
And you can't plan the future.
You just can't. Cause as soon as you do,

490
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:05,082
something happens, some..

491
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:08,639
terrible thing happens..
- Like your father drowning himself.

492
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,326
That's exactly what I mean.

493
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:14,653
You take it as it comes,
here and now!

494
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:21,785
Steve had a huge presentation today for
some big-wig government guys who could be..

495
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:26,721
..really important for his business
and he's put together for months now,

496
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,296
But.. as soon as we
found about Daddy,

497
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:32,513
he just canceled his meeting.

498
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:34,603
He has his priorities straight.

499
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:36,511
And, you know what the kicker is?

500
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,608
Do you know what the
kicker is Barb?

501
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,420
What's the kicker?

502
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:45,318
We're going to Belize
on our honeymoon!

503
00:36:02,724 --> 00:36:04,766
Is it always this hot?

504
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:09,897
Usually, it's hotter.

505
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:14,353
That's hard to imagine.

506
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:21,443
How old are you, about,
seventeen?

507
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,423
Fourteen.

508
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:25,923
Fourteen, right...

509
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:32,675
You know what I was doing
when I was fourteen?

510
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:34,941
Cattle processing.

511
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,199
Know what that is?
- It doesn't sound good.

512
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:40,056
Slaughterhouse sanitation.

513
00:36:40,057 --> 00:36:41,556
That's disgusting.

514
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:43,474
I wouldn't recommend it.

515
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:47,390
But hey. Put food on the table.

516
00:36:49,192 --> 00:36:51,130
Get it?

517
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:57,360
What's that smell?

518
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,918
I don't know?

519
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,765
It's probably, that stop thrash can
over there?

520
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:04,153
Nah, that's not what I'm smelling.

521
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,077
What are you doing?

522
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:11,039
Do I smell what I think I smell?
- I don't know,

523
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,539
What do you smell?
- Is that... pot?

524
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:14,667
You smoking pot?

525
00:37:14,712 --> 00:37:16,630
No.
- You can tell me.

526
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:19,736
You a little dope smoker?
- No!

527
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,195
Then you are in luck.

528
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:26,341
Because, I happen to have some
really tasty shit.

529
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:29,906
Here we go!

530
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:33,591
No Pinots, but they had some decent
California Merlots.

531
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:40,368
Ahh! Look at me! Look at me.
- You're beautiful, Mom.

532
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:42,505
I was beautiful.

533
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:44,421
Hah..

534
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:46,658
Not anymore.
- Oh, now --

535
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:47,908
You're still beautiful.

536
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:51,406
One of those lies we tell to give us comfort.

537
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:55,851
Women are beautiful,
when they're young and not after.

538
00:37:56,021 --> 00:38:00,027
Men can still preserve their
sex appeal into old age.

539
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:02,475
Not those men like
you see with shorts,

540
00:38:02,494 --> 00:38:06,660
and little purses around their waists.
- Lord..lord.

541
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:13,712
Some men can maintain a weary masculinity.
Women just get old..

542
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:16,341
..and fat and wrinkly.

543
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,826
I beg your pardon?
I'm still very sexy.

544
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:22,850
Thank you very much.
- Yeah, you're about as sexy

545
00:38:23,044 --> 00:38:24,831
as a wet cardboard box, Mattie Fae.

546
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:27,506
you and me both.

547
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:33,406
Look, wouldn't we be better off all of us,
if we stopped lying about these things,

548
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:35,252
..and told the truth?

549
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:37,650
"Women aren't sexy
when they're old."

550
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:40,547
I can live with that.
Can you live with that?

551
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:43,142
What about Sophia Loren?

552
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:47,463
What about Lena Horne?
She stayed sexy till she was eighty.

553
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:48,963
The world is round.

554
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:50,956
Get over it.

555
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:53,522
Hey, try this dress on.

556
00:38:53,523 --> 00:38:55,182
I'm sorry, I won't.

557
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,209
You don't know how to
attract a man. I do.

558
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,408
That's something I always..

559
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:03,210
We just buried my father,
I'm not trying to attract a man.

560
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:04,409
I'm not talking about today, dummy,
I'm just saying..

561
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,793
this is something..
- I have a man. All right?

562
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:07,992
I have a man.

563
00:39:07,993 --> 00:39:11,182
You said, you weren't
looking for a man.

564
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,712
And I'm not.
Because I have one.

565
00:39:13,713 --> 00:39:17,298
Now will you leave it alone?
- No, I won't leave it alone. <i>- No, let's not leave it alone.</i>

566
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:19,126
I wish you both could see,

567
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,432
..the brainsick looks
on your faces.

568
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:22,673
Who is it?
- Nobody. Forget it..

569
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:26,678
Tell us, is he someone from school?
How old is he, what's he do?

570
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,097
I'm not telling you anything..

571
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:30,699
You have to tell us something!
- No, I really don't.

572
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:35,472
Are you in love, Ivy?
- I...I don't...I'm...

573
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:58,545
No, we maintain the accounts offshore,
just until we get approvals.

574
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,612
- What..to get around approvals?

575
00:40:00,613 --> 00:40:03,912
To get around approvals
until we get approvals.

576
00:40:03,913 --> 00:40:07,632
There's a lot of bureaucracy, red tape..
I don't know how much you know about Florida,

577
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:08,996
 Florida politics.

578
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:12,944
Only what I read and that's..
- Right, right, this kind of business in particular.

579
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:17,460
...Charlie?
- Picking up Little Charles.

580
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:25,541
Give. Me. The wine.

581
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:39,587
Is that what you were in such a
hurry to get home for?

582
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:43,853
What the hell's on TV
that's so important you?

583
00:40:43,962 --> 00:40:46,579
<i>Phantom of the Opera,</i> 1925.

584
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,758
They're showing it with the
scene in color restored.

585
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:50,856
Cool.

586
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:54,333
Let me make sure I've got this.
when you threw a fit..

587
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:57,569
about going to the store with your dad...
Hey, look at me.

588
00:40:58,648 --> 00:41:03,491
And you were so distraught over the
start time of your Grandpa's funeral.

589
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:04,690
Was this your concern? Huh?

590
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:08,696
Getting back here in time to watch
Phantom of the Fucking Opera?

591
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:11,996
I guess.

592
00:41:13,894 --> 00:41:16,266
Christ.

593
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:21,933
Phantom of the Opera, huh?

594
00:41:21,934 --> 00:41:24,652
Huh-uh.
- Hi, doodle.

595
00:41:28,898 --> 00:41:30,586
Doodle.

596
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:34,023
Hey, baby.

597
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,297
I want to show you our old fort.

598
00:41:41,322 --> 00:41:45,062
Man, the air in here
just doesn't move.

599
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:47,160
I'll hook you up, later.

600
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,187
I'm sorry, Dad.

601
00:42:08,188 --> 00:42:11,246
No need to apologize.
- I know, Mom's mad at me.

602
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,463
Don't worry about her.
- What did she say?

603
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:16,882
Your mother,
she says what she says.

604
00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:18,237
I set the alarm. I did.

605
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:21,735
I know you did.
- I loved Uncle Bev, you know that.

606
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:23,623
Just stop, apologizing.

607
00:42:23,643 --> 00:42:25,272
I missed his funeral!

608
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:28,608
Ah, its..

609
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,374
It's a ceremony.

610
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:33,443
It's ceremonial.

611
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:36,360
It doesn't mean
anything compared to..

612
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,179
what you have in your heart.

613
00:42:38,238 --> 00:42:40,167
Hold on,

614
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:41,865
comb your hair.

615
00:42:48,158 --> 00:42:50,346
Uncle Bev, must be
disappointed in me.

616
00:42:51,455 --> 00:42:56,389
Your Uncle Bev has got bigger
and better things ahead of him.

617
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,229
He doesn't have time for spite.

618
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:01,315
He wasn't that kind of man, anyway.

619
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:12,574
Hey,

620
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:17,899
hey..It's okay.

621
00:43:26,653 --> 00:43:28,207
Just...

622
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,276
I know how things are.
I know how  they..

623
00:43:31,495 --> 00:43:33,623
..think about me;

624
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:36,410
and something like this...
you want to be there for people,

625
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,997
I'm sorry I let you down, Dad.
- Hey, You haven't let me down.

626
00:43:41,615 --> 00:43:43,613
You never let me down.

627
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:45,461
Now listen...

628
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,297
you're wrong about these
people, they love you.

629
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:51,504
They love you.

630
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:53,313
Some of them,

631
00:43:53,373 --> 00:43:56,800
haven't gotten a chance to see
what I see.

632
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:00,316
A fine man,

633
00:44:01,095 --> 00:44:03,012
very loving,

634
00:44:03,013 --> 00:44:06,221
..a with a lot to offer.

635
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,504
Now take this

636
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:18,698
Give me my comb.

637
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:30,496
I love you, Dad.

638
00:44:32,644 --> 00:44:35,727
Love you too, son.

639
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,903
Phantom of the Opera?

640
00:44:41,904 --> 00:44:43,741
You don't remember
what it was like to be fourteen?

641
00:44:43,742 --> 00:44:47,024
She's old enough to exhibit
a little character.

642
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:49,857
But, that's something you normally
learn from your parents.

643
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:52,500
That's a shot across my bow, right?
I missed something.

644
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,113
Really? Instilling character.

645
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:56,758
Our burden as parents.
- I got that part.

646
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:58,850
And you really haven't
been much of a parent lately,

647
00:44:58,851 --> 00:45:00,049
..so it's tough to..
- Just because you and I are..

648
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,245
..struggling with this Gordian knot
It doesn't mean..

649
00:45:03,246 --> 00:45:06,019
..but her fourteen-year-old
self might view it differently.

650
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,859
might consider it "abandonment"

651
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:11,215
Oh, come on, she's a little more sophisticated
than that, don't you think?

652
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:12,529
Pretty fucking sophisticated,

653
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:16,424
the restored whatever from Phantom of the
Opera, I know that makes your dick hard..

654
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,965
Barbara --
- Precocious little shit.

655
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,618
I'm not defending her.
- I am not blaming her.

656
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:24,392
I'm on your side.
- ..selfish son of a bitch!

657
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:28,101
Be a father! Help me!
- I am her father, goddamn it!

658
00:45:28,102 --> 00:45:31,370
Her father in name only!
- I have not forsook my responsibilities!

659
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:32,569
It's "forsaken," big shot!

660
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,948
Actually, "forsook" is also an
acceptable usage.

661
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:37,219
Oh, "forsook" you and the horse
you rode in on.

662
00:45:38,158 --> 00:45:40,075
You don't fight fair.

663
00:45:40,076 --> 00:45:42,045
I've seen where that gets me!

664
00:45:42,753 --> 00:45:46,274
GROW UP! while you're dyeing your hair
and going through your fifth puberty,

665
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:48,922
the world is falling apart and
your kid can't handle it!

666
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:51,799
Our kid is just trying to deal with this
goddamn madhouse you've dragged her into.

667
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,998
This madhouse is my home.

668
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:55,324
Think about that statement
for a second, why don't you?

669
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:56,523
Jean is here with me because..

670
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:59,108
..this is a family event.
- Jean's here with you because she's a buffer..

671
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:01,948
between you and the shrill insanity
of your mother.

672
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:04,190
Y'know, you'd have a lot more
credibility if you had any credibility.

673
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:05,389
You're a easy mark.
- You're so goddamn self-righteous,

674
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,814
..you know that? You're so..
- Surely you must've realised..

675
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:11,395
when you started porking Pippi Longstocking
you were due for a little self-righteousness,

676
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:15,588
..just a smidge of indignation on my part.
- Maybe, I split because of it!

677
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,527
Is this your confession, then,

678
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:20,116
when you finally, unload all? Hmm?

679
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:24,023
You're thoughtful, Barbara,
but you're not open.

680
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:26,370
You're passionate, but you're hard.

681
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,355
You're a good, decent, funny,
wonderful woman, and I love you, but..

682
00:46:30,356 --> 00:46:32,404
You're a pain in the ass!

683
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,985
One for me.

684
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:19,237
One for the girls.

685
00:47:39,187 --> 00:47:40,636
Mom's casserole.

686
00:47:40,955 --> 00:47:42,634
They said you overslept.

687
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:47,707
Maybe I purposely accidentally overslept.
I don't know.

688
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:50,249
I'm so sorry.
- Please.

689
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:51,835
I know you had one of the worst
days of your life and..

690
00:47:52,723 --> 00:47:56,950
I'm sorry that I wasn't there.
- We don't have to do that with each other.

691
00:47:59,616 --> 00:48:00,986
You're breaking our rule.

692
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:06,420
They're on to me.
Not us, just me.

693
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:09,177
I told them I was seeing someone.

694
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:11,274
I didn't tell them who.
I just wanted you to know,

695
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:14,169
in case it came up.

696
00:48:16,706 --> 00:48:18,556
What?

697
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:24,024
Charles...

698
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:25,571
I adore you.

699
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:33,222
Pass the casserole, please?

700
00:48:33,223 --> 00:48:34,231
My casserole's coming.

701
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:36,419
I'll eat some of yours, too.

702
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,108
Mom?! Let's eat!

703
00:48:39,037 --> 00:48:41,125
Oh, There he is.

704
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,328
I wanted to put you at a kid's
table but they wouldn't let me.

705
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:46,120
Where do you want me to put this?

706
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,857
Hi, Little Charles.
I want you to meet my fiance Steve.

707
00:48:52,548 --> 00:48:54,966
Goddamn it --! O-pah!

708
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,529
You goddamn clumsy goofball!

709
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,457
Mom, I'm so sorry.
- All right, nobody's hurt.

710
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:03,896
What about me? I'm hurt.
- It's not a party, until somebody spills something.

711
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:05,396
That's my casserole!

712
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,148
Let it go, Mattie Fae.
- I'm so sorry.

713
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,721
Who wants chicken?

714
00:49:09,722 --> 00:49:12,383
Jean, you didn't get any chicken.

715
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:13,581
I don't eat meat.

716
00:49:13,582 --> 00:49:15,081
You don't eat meat.

717
00:49:16,479 --> 00:49:18,648
Okay.
Mom!

718
00:49:19,486 --> 00:49:23,380
Just put it on his plate for him or
he's liable to burn the house down.

719
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:26,068
All right, Mattie Fae.

720
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,128
Barbara...

721
00:49:32,913 --> 00:49:34,562
..will you put this?

722
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:36,750
Over there.
- Yeah, sure.

723
00:49:38,717 --> 00:49:41,815
MATTIE FAE: That's so nice.
KAREN: So, sweet.

724
00:49:42,443 --> 00:49:46,144
I see you gentlemen have all stripped
down to your shirt fronts.

725
00:49:46,145 --> 00:49:47,948
I thought we were having a
funeral dinner,

726
00:49:49,616 --> 00:49:51,485
not a cockfight.

727
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:12,874
Someone should probably say grace.

728
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,379
Barbara?

729
00:50:21,153 --> 00:50:24,052
Uncle Charlie should say it.
He's the..

730
00:50:24,252 --> 00:50:26,340
patriarch around here now.

731
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:29,197
I am?
- By default.

732
00:50:33,522 --> 00:50:35,261
Okay.

733
00:50:38,607 --> 00:50:40,426
<i>Dear Lord...</i>

734
00:50:41,265 --> 00:50:42,943
<i>We ask that you..</i>

735
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:45,561
<i>watch over this family..</i>

736
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,488
<i>in this sad time, O Lord...</i>

737
00:50:49,077 --> 00:50:50,816
<i>that you..</i>

738
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:53,401
<i>bless this good woman and..</i>

739
00:50:53,402 --> 00:50:56,300
<i>keep her in your..
in your...</i>

740
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,217
<i>..grace.</i>

741
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:17,238
I gotta to take this.

742
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:19,637
Work..it's very important.

743
00:51:20,196 --> 00:51:21,775
...in Oklahoma. Yeah..

744
00:51:28,128 --> 00:51:30,096
<i>We ask that you watch over..</i>

745
00:51:30,246 --> 00:51:32,004
<i>Beverly, too, as he...</i>

746
00:51:34,012 --> 00:51:35,810
<i>as he...</i>

747
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:39,737
<i>as he makes his journey.</i>

748
00:51:41,934 --> 00:51:45,621
<i>We thank thee, O Lord,
that we are able to join together,</i>

749
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:49,277
<i>to pay tribute to this fine man.</i>

750
00:51:50,415 --> 00:51:52,654
<i>in his house, with his..</i>

751
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,331
<i>beautiful daughters.</i>

752
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,706
<i>We are truly blessed
in our fellowship,</i>

753
00:52:01,754 --> 00:52:03,413
<i>our togetherness,
our... our..</i>

754
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:08,088
<i>fellowship.</i>

755
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:13,753
<i>We thank thee for the food,
O Lord, that we can..</i>

756
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:16,889
<i>share this food...</i>

757
00:52:18,397 --> 00:52:20,664
<i>and replenish our bodies with...</i>

758
00:52:20,665 --> 00:52:22,254
<i>nutrients.</i>

759
00:52:23,342 --> 00:52:25,441
<i>We ask that you help us..</i>

760
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:27,088
<i>get better.</i>

761
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:28,718
<i>Be better people.</i>

762
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:34,562
<i>We recognize now more than ever
the power, the...</i>

763
00:52:35,161 --> 00:52:37,249
<i>joy of family.</i>

764
00:52:37,728 --> 00:52:43,637
<i>We ask that you bless and watch
over this family. Amen.</i>

765
00:52:44,483 --> 00:52:47,582
Amen. So, sorry folks.
- Let's eat.

766
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:55,950
Barb, you have any use
for that sideboard?

767
00:52:56,689 --> 00:52:58,228
That sideboard there,

768
00:52:58,477 --> 00:53:00,205
you have any interest in that?

769
00:53:00,206 --> 00:53:01,651
It's so pretty.

770
00:53:01,652 --> 00:53:04,256
No. I mean, why?

771
00:53:04,257 --> 00:53:08,410
I'm getting rid of a lot of this stuff and
I thought you might want that sideboard.

772
00:53:09,796 --> 00:53:12,044
No, Mom, I...I wouldn't have any
way to get that home to Colorado.

773
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:13,732
Maybe, Ivy'll take it.

774
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:17,329
I have something like that, remember.
- Clearing all this out of here.

775
00:53:17,388 --> 00:53:19,495
It's really pretty.
- I want to have a brand new everything.

776
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:23,997
I guess I'm just sort of... not
prepared to talk about your stuff.

777
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:27,636
Suit yourself.

778
00:53:30,315 --> 00:53:33,312
The food is just spectacular.

779
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,807
Johnna cooked this
whole meal by herself.

780
00:53:37,808 --> 00:53:42,064
It's what she's paid for.
Y'all did know she's getting paid, right?

781
00:53:43,172 --> 00:53:44,701
Jean,

782
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,688
so..I'm curious,

783
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:52,602
when you say you don't eat meat,
you mean, you don't eat meat of any kind?

784
00:53:52,603 --> 00:53:54,102
Right.

785
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,128
Is that for health reasons, or...?

786
00:53:58,317 --> 00:54:01,245
When you eat meat,
you ingest an animal's fear.

787
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:02,444
Ingest what?

788
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:04,960
It's fur?
- Fear.

789
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:09,255
I thought she said --

790
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:13,614
How do you do that?
You can't eat fear.

791
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:14,750
Sure you can. I mean..

792
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,340
What happens to you,
when you feel afraid?

793
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:19,316
Doesn't your body produce
all sorts of chemical reactions?

794
00:54:19,317 --> 00:54:20,515
I don't know..
Does it?

795
00:54:20,516 --> 00:54:21,714
It does.
- Yes.

796
00:54:21,715 --> 00:54:22,913
Adrenaline, and, and --

797
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:26,441
Your body goes through a whole chemical
process when it experiences fear.

798
00:54:26,442 --> 00:54:29,217
..and cortisol.
- Don't you think an animal experiences fear?

799
00:54:29,218 --> 00:54:30,664
You bet it does.

800
00:54:30,665 --> 00:54:33,093
I used to work at a
cattle processing plant,

801
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,724
lots of fear flying
around that place.

802
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:36,923
So, when you eat an meat,

803
00:54:36,924 --> 00:54:42,092
you're ingesting all that fear it felt
when it was slaughtered to make food.

804
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:45,381
You mean I've been
eating fear, what,

805
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,029
 three times a day for..

806
00:54:47,069 --> 00:54:49,896
..sixty years?

807
00:54:50,195 --> 00:54:52,692
This one won't have a meal

808
00:54:52,693 --> 00:54:57,109
that doesn't meat in it.
- I guess it's the way I was raised,

809
00:54:57,768 --> 00:55:03,253
but, somehow it just doesn't seem like a
legitimate meal less it has some meat somewhere.

810
00:55:03,392 --> 00:55:05,889
If I make a pasta dish of
some kind, he'll be like,

811
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:08,386
<i> "That's fine for an appetizer,
but where's the meat?"</i>

812
00:55:08,387 --> 00:55:10,884
Isn't that some TV commercial,

813
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:14,212
the old lady says,
"Where's the meat?"

814
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:15,670
"Where's the beef?"

815
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:19,843
"Where's the meat?!"
"Where's the meat?!"

816
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:22,924
"Where's the meat?!"
"Hey, Where's the meat?!"

817
00:55:23,312 --> 00:55:24,781
That's pleasant.

818
00:55:27,128 --> 00:55:29,854
I thought,
the services were lovely.

819
00:55:29,855 --> 00:55:32,330
Yes, weren't they?
- Preacher did a fine job.

820
00:55:34,571 --> 00:55:38,631
I give it a...Ehhhhh!
- Really? you thought so?

821
00:55:38,632 --> 00:55:40,627
Great, now we get some
dramatic criticism.

822
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:44,040
Too much talk about
poetry and teaching.

823
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:45,800
He hadn't written any poetry,

824
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,359
to speak of since 65

825
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:51,674
He never liked teaching worth a damn.
Nobody talked about the good stuff.

826
00:55:51,914 --> 00:55:55,640
Man was a world-class alcoholic,
more'n fifty years.

827
00:55:56,030 --> 00:56:01,135
Nobody told the story about that night he got
wrangled into giving a talk at that TU alumni dinner...

828
00:56:02,423 --> 00:56:06,818
Drank a whole bottle of
Ron Bocoy White Rum,

829
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:08,478
don't know why I remember that,

830
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:10,765
and got up to give this talk,

831
00:56:11,054 --> 00:56:12,713
and he fouled himself!

832
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:20,254
Comes back to our table with this great..
- Yeah, I can't imagine why no one told that story.

833
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:23,922
Well, he didn't get invited back to
anymore TU alumni dinners.

834
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:25,422
I can tell you that.

835
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:30,844
I don't know much
about poetry, but..

836
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,013
I thought his poems
were extraordinary.

837
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:34,890
And your reading was very fine.

838
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,309
Thank you.

839
00:56:37,878 --> 00:56:39,467
Who are you?

840
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:44,482
This is my fiance, Steve,
you met him at the church.

841
00:56:44,661 --> 00:56:46,268
Steve Heidebrecht.

842
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,017
Hide-the-what?
- Heidebrecht.

843
00:56:50,345 --> 00:56:54,861
Hide-a-burrr...It's German.
- Well, German-Irish, really..

844
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,058
That's peculiar, Karen,

845
00:56:58,317 --> 00:57:00,725
to bring a date to
your father's funeral.

846
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:04,810
I know the poetry was good, but I really
wouldn't have considered it date material.

847
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:07,781
He's not a date, he's my fiance.

848
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:10,824
We're getting married on New Years, in Miami,

849
00:57:10,825 --> 00:57:13,203
And, I would love it,
if you can make it.

850
00:57:13,702 --> 00:57:15,810
I don't really see that
happening, do you?

851
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:17,628
Steve.

852
00:57:18,007 --> 00:57:20,136
That right? Steve?

853
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:22,004
Yes, ma'am.

854
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:24,621
You ever been married before?

855
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,959
Yes, ma'am, I have.

856
00:57:27,138 --> 00:57:29,575
More then once?

857
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:31,774
Three times, actually,
three times before this.

858
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:35,580
You should pretty much
have it down by now, then.

859
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:38,288
Right,
right..

860
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:42,692
I had that one pegged. Didn't I?

861
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:46,519
I mean, look at him,
you can tell he's been married.

862
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:51,115
I went outside to show Steve the old fort
and it's torn down!

863
00:57:51,116 --> 00:57:53,689
That's been gone for years.
- I was so sad!

864
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,909
What is this now?
- Our old fort, where we used to play..

865
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,876
Cowboys and Indians.
- Daddy said rats were getting in there.

866
00:57:58,877 --> 00:58:00,376
Karen! Shame on you!

867
00:58:02,972 --> 00:58:05,101
Don't you know not to say
Cowboys and Indians?

868
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:09,916
You played Cowboys and
Native Americans,

869
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:12,094
right Barb?

870
00:58:12,213 --> 00:58:14,650
What are you taking?
What pills?

871
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:17,935
Oh, Leave me alone.

872
00:58:19,366 --> 00:58:20,745
Uh-oh!

873
00:58:21,194 --> 00:58:22,743
What is it?

874
00:58:23,652 --> 00:58:25,261
What is it?

875
00:58:27,268 --> 00:58:29,127
What's the matter?
- You okay, Uncle Charles.

876
00:58:29,156 --> 00:58:33,772
UH-OH!
I got a big bite of fear!

877
00:58:37,568 --> 00:58:39,706
Fear never tasted so good.

878
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:45,539
It's pretty good once
you get used to the taste.

879
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,468
I'm shakin' in my boots!

880
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,931
I do catch her eating a cheeseburger
every now and again.

881
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,406
No, you don't!
- Double cheeseburger, bacon, extra fear.

882
00:58:58,407 --> 00:58:59,605
Mom, you are such a liar!

883
00:58:59,606 --> 00:59:01,105
No stop. You are!

884
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:04,128
Y'know, if I ever called
my mother a liar?

885
00:59:04,129 --> 00:59:08,725
She would've knocked my goddamn
head off my shoulders.

886
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:18,855
You girls know there's a will.

887
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:20,114
Mom...

888
00:59:20,115 --> 00:59:22,523
We took care of it some time back.

889
00:59:23,112 --> 00:59:24,483
We don't want to talk about it.

890
00:59:24,484 --> 00:59:28,126
I want to talk about it.
What about what I want to talk about?

891
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,706
Does that count for anything?

892
00:59:31,104 --> 00:59:34,175
Bev made some good investments,
believe it or not,

893
00:59:34,176 --> 00:59:37,658
We had money for you girls
in his will, but..

894
00:59:38,926 --> 00:59:42,692
we talked it over
after some times passed

895
00:59:42,693 --> 00:59:47,166
and decided to change things,
leave everything to me.

896
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:51,647
We didn't get around to
taking care of it legally, but..

897
00:59:52,343 --> 00:59:55,370
you should know he meant
to leave the money to me.

898
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,625
Okay.

899
01:00:03,928 --> 01:00:05,555
Okay.

900
01:00:05,556 --> 01:00:07,055
Okay?

901
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,601
Okay.
Karen, Okay?

902
01:00:10,602 --> 01:00:12,963
Yeah, Okay.
- Okay.

903
01:00:12,964 --> 01:00:16,377
But now some of this furniture,
some of this old shit you can just have.

904
01:00:16,808 --> 01:00:18,677
I don't want it, got no use for it.

905
01:00:18,966 --> 01:00:20,555
Maybe, I should have an auction.

906
01:00:21,024 --> 01:00:25,420
Sure, an auction's a fine idea.

907
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:29,346
Some things, though, like the silver,
that's worth a pretty penny.

908
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:31,494
But, if you like I'll sell
it to you, If you like.

909
01:00:31,564 --> 01:00:33,582
For cheaper'n I might
get in an auction.

910
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:35,549
Or you might never
get around to the auction,

911
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:38,644
and then we can just have it
for free after you die.

912
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:40,144
Barbara...

913
01:00:42,573 --> 01:00:44,192
You might at that.

914
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:46,829
Bill? I was wondering,
You reading those poems..

915
01:00:49,126 --> 01:00:50,765
Which ones did you..

916
01:00:51,174 --> 01:00:54,329
..choose in the end to read?
- Well I..

917
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:56,995
Bill, Where are you living now?

918
01:00:57,188 --> 01:00:58,827
You want this old sideboard?

919
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:03,562
I beg your pardon.
- You and Barbara are separated, right?

920
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,408
Or, are you divorced already?

921
01:01:09,346 --> 01:01:12,393
No, we're separated.

922
01:01:12,932 --> 01:01:15,700
You thought you could slip that
by me, didn't you?

923
01:01:17,568 --> 01:01:20,036
Nobody slips anything by me.

924
01:01:21,164 --> 01:01:22,883
I know what's what.

925
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:27,477
Your father thought he's slipping
one by me too, right?

926
01:01:27,478 --> 01:01:30,415
What is the matter with you?
- I'm sorry you two're having trouble,

927
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:32,184
maybe you can work it out.

928
01:01:32,762 --> 01:01:35,680
Bev'n I separated a few times,

929
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:38,865
course we didn't call it that.

930
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:41,284
Help us, with an illustration
from your storybook marriage.

931
01:01:41,923 --> 01:01:45,798
Truth is, you just can't compete
with a younger woman.

932
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:49,514
It's just one of those unfair
things in life.

933
01:01:50,395 --> 01:01:53,732
Is there a younger woman involved?
- You've said enough on this topic.

934
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:56,110
Yes. There's a younger woman.
- Well, Y'see?

935
01:01:56,329 --> 01:01:58,227
Odds're against you there, babe.

936
01:02:02,503 --> 01:02:04,411
Mom believes women don't grow
more attractive with age.

937
01:02:05,999 --> 01:02:08,597
Oh, I disagree, I..
- No..

938
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:10,444
I didn't say they
"don't grow more attractive,"

939
01:02:10,445 --> 01:02:13,101
I said they get ugly.

940
01:02:13,102 --> 01:02:15,350
And it's not really a matter
of opinion, Karen dear.

941
01:02:15,351 --> 01:02:18,428
You've only just started
to prove it yourself.

942
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:21,954
You're in rare form today, Vi.

943
01:02:22,043 --> 01:02:23,752
Well, The day calls for it,
doesn't it?

944
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,889
What form would you have me in?

945
01:02:27,238 --> 01:02:28,466
Hmm?

946
01:02:28,467 --> 01:02:31,324
I just don't understand
why you're so adversarial.

947
01:02:31,673 --> 01:02:33,552
I'm just truth-telling.

948
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,699
Some people are
antagonized by the truth.

949
01:02:37,258 --> 01:02:39,127
Everyone here loves you, dear.

950
01:02:39,695 --> 01:02:41,383
You think you can
shame me, Charlie?

951
01:02:41,384 --> 01:02:43,322
Blow it out your ass!

952
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,207
Three days ago...
I had to identified my father's corpse.

953
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:51,724
Now I'm supposed to sit here and
listen to you viciously attack,

954
01:02:51,873 --> 01:02:54,621
every member of this family.
- Attack my family?!

955
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,927
Have you ever been attacked..

956
01:02:56,928 --> 01:02:58,206
in your sweet spoiled life?!

957
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,903
Tell her 'bout attacks, Mattie Fae.

958
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:03,336
Tell her what an attack looks like!
- Settle down, Mom.

959
01:03:03,337 --> 01:03:05,274
Don't tell me to settle
down, goddam it!

960
01:03:05,275 --> 01:03:09,075
I'm not a goddamn invalid!
Am I to be abided now.

961
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,635
Have I been passed over?!

962
01:03:11,753 --> 01:03:13,622
C'mon, Honey..
- This woman..

963
01:03:14,241 --> 01:03:17,968
came to my rescue when
one of my dear mother's many..

964
01:03:18,307 --> 01:03:22,112
gentlemen friends was attacking me,
with a claw hammer!

965
01:03:22,113 --> 01:03:23,900
This woman has..

966
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:28,028
dents in her skull,
fro hammer blows.

967
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:31,023
What do you know about

968
01:03:31,024 --> 01:03:33,662
..life on these Plains?
What do you know..

969
01:03:33,861 --> 01:03:35,610
..about hard times?

970
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:38,143
We know you had a
rotten childhood, Mom.

971
01:03:38,144 --> 01:03:41,309
Who didn't?
- You DON'T know! You do NOT know!

972
01:03:41,773 --> 01:03:44,247
None of you know,
'cept this woman right here.

973
01:03:44,248 --> 01:03:47,087
And that man we buried today!

974
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:53,043
Sweet girl, sweet Barbara,

975
01:03:54,171 --> 01:03:56,139
my heart breaks for every time,

976
01:03:56,289 --> 01:04:00,120
you ever felt pain.
I wish I coulda shielded you from it.

977
01:04:00,121 --> 01:04:01,303
But if you think,

978
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,800
you can fathom
for one solitary second..

979
01:04:03,801 --> 01:04:06,902
the pain that man endured
in his natural life,

980
01:04:06,903 --> 01:04:09,684
you got another think coming.

981
01:04:09,685 --> 01:04:13,352
Do you know where your father lived
from age four till about ten?

982
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,861
Do you?

983
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,897
Do you?

984
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,397
No.

985
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,785
In a Pontiac Sedan.

986
01:04:21,753 --> 01:04:25,110
With his mother, his father,
in a fucking car!

987
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,610
Six fucking years in a car!

988
01:04:27,577 --> 01:04:30,743
Now, what do you want to say about
your rotten childhood?

989
01:04:30,744 --> 01:04:31,942
Jesus.

990
01:04:31,943 --> 01:04:33,141
That's the crux of the biscuit.

991
01:04:33,142 --> 01:04:34,641
We lived too hard..

992
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,961
and then rose too high.
We sacrificed everything!

993
01:04:37,962 --> 01:04:39,160
We did it all for you.

994
01:04:39,161 --> 01:04:44,010
Your father and I were the first in
our families to graduate high school.

995
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:46,759
And he wound up,
an award-winning poet.

996
01:04:47,478 --> 01:04:49,476
You girls, just..

997
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,514
given a college education,

998
01:04:51,823 --> 01:04:54,879
taken for granted, no doubt.
Where did you wind up?

999
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,659
What did you do?

1000
01:04:56,918 --> 01:04:58,807
What did <i>you</i> do?

1001
01:05:00,754 --> 01:05:02,292
Who are you?

1002
01:05:02,293 --> 01:05:03,540
Jesus!

1003
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:06,139
Jesus, you worked as hard as us,
you'd all be President.

1004
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:07,923
You never had real problems.

1005
01:05:07,924 --> 01:05:10,171
So, you got to make all
your problems yourselves.

1006
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:11,671
Why are you screaming at us?

1007
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:14,271
Just time we had some truth's
told 'round here.

1008
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,188
Damn fine day,
to tell the truth.

1009
01:05:19,396 --> 01:05:21,674
Well, the truth is...

1010
01:05:22,023 --> 01:05:25,390
I'm getting full.
- Amen.

1011
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:27,558
There's dessert, too.

1012
01:05:27,947 --> 01:05:31,053
She baked pies.
They look so lovely.

1013
01:05:31,054 --> 01:05:32,392
I got a truth to tell.

1014
01:05:32,393 --> 01:05:34,091
It speaks.

1015
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,309
What is it, son?

1016
01:05:42,323 --> 01:05:44,881
I have a truth.
- Little Charles...?

1017
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:48,862
I..
- Charles, not like this, please...

1018
01:05:52,183 --> 01:05:53,961
The truth is...

1019
01:05:58,077 --> 01:05:59,746
I forgot to set the clock.

1020
01:06:01,154 --> 01:06:04,078
The power didn't go out,
I I...forgot to set the clock.

1021
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,578
Sorry, Mom.

1022
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:09,126
I'm sorry, everyone.

1023
01:06:09,435 --> 01:06:11,993
Excuse me...I...just..

1024
01:06:18,127 --> 01:06:19,734
Scintillating.

1025
01:06:19,735 --> 01:06:21,534
I gave up a long time ago...

1026
01:06:21,923 --> 01:06:24,101
Little Charles is your project now.

1027
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,429
Charles.

1028
01:06:26,488 --> 01:06:28,407
His name is Charles.

1029
01:06:29,795 --> 01:06:31,464
Poor Ivy.

1030
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:34,761
Poor baby.
- Please, Mom...

1031
01:06:35,879 --> 01:06:38,696
She's always had a feeling
for the underdog.

1032
01:06:38,697 --> 01:06:41,627
Don't be mean to me right now, okay?
- I am not..

1033
01:06:41,853 --> 01:06:43,224
Everyone's got this idea..

1034
01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:46,553
I'm mean all of a sudden.
- Please, momma.

1035
01:06:46,554 --> 01:06:48,926
I'm just telling the truth.
- You're a drug addict.

1036
01:06:49,695 --> 01:06:51,953
That is the truth!
That's what I'm getting at!

1037
01:06:51,993 --> 01:06:53,960
Hey, everybody.
Everybody listen...

1038
01:06:53,961 --> 01:06:55,909
I am a drug addict.

1039
01:06:56,369 --> 01:06:57,946
I love drugs.

1040
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,165
Specially, pills,
specially downers.

1041
01:07:00,484 --> 01:07:02,573
Y'see these little blue babies?

1042
01:07:02,722 --> 01:07:04,791
These are my best fucking friends,

1043
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:07,807
..and they never
let me down.

1044
01:07:08,017 --> 01:07:10,005
Try to get em away from me;

1045
01:07:10,095 --> 01:07:12,023
I'll eat you alive.

1046
01:07:12,103 --> 01:07:16,315
Gimme those goddamn pills..
- I'll eat you alive, girl!

1047
01:07:18,423 --> 01:07:20,426
Holy shit!

1048
01:07:26,355 --> 01:07:28,514
Barbara, stop it.

1049
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:38,197
Hey, now, c'mon!

1050
01:07:38,207 --> 01:07:39,915
Give that to me!

1051
01:07:41,214 --> 01:07:44,960
Goddamn you...

1052
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:47,847
goddamn you..

1053
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:53,350
Sit down.
- Okay. Pill raid.

1054
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:55,720
Remember this?
Remember how it goes?

1055
01:07:56,568 --> 01:07:59,136
Search everything!
Every closet...

1056
01:07:59,156 --> 01:08:02,646
Every drawer, every shoebox.

1057
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:05,350
Karen, call Dr. Burke.

1058
01:08:06,528 --> 01:08:08,797
You can't do this!
This is my house!

1059
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,304
This is my house!

1060
01:08:12,283 --> 01:08:13,931
You don't get it, do you?

1061
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:16,129
You don't get it.

1062
01:08:16,948 --> 01:08:18,806
I'M RUNNING THINGS NOW!

1063
01:08:26,998 --> 01:08:29,626
Why'd Dr. Burke write her so many
prescriptions?

1064
01:08:29,685 --> 01:08:31,083
Didn't he know?

1065
01:08:31,084 --> 01:08:34,939
It's not just him.
She's got a doctor in every port.

1066
01:08:35,255 --> 01:08:37,058
And you knew,
 this was going on again?

1067
01:08:57,947 --> 01:08:59,506
I'm sorry about you and Bill.

1068
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:01,484
Me too, Barb.

1069
01:09:03,002 --> 01:09:05,530
You think, it's temporary or..

1070
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,448
Who knows?

1071
01:09:09,815 --> 01:09:11,474
We've been married a long time.

1072
01:09:17,058 --> 01:09:18,527
Now what?

1073
01:09:22,552 --> 01:09:25,784
DR. BURKE: The chemotherapy and radiation,

1074
01:09:25,785 --> 01:09:27,165
coupled with the overuse of..

1075
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:28,963
pain medications.
- Right..

1076
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:31,296
and without the benefit of more
thorough testing,

1077
01:09:31,297 --> 01:09:32,796
an MRI or CT scan,

1078
01:09:34,723 --> 01:09:37,991
I believe your mother is suffering
from Mild Cognitive Impairment.

1079
01:09:37,992 --> 01:09:39,190
- Mild Cognitive Impairment?

1080
01:09:39,191 --> 01:09:40,690
Brain damage.

1081
01:09:41,603 --> 01:09:45,645
It may be time to consider placing
her in a long term care facility.

1082
01:09:45,646 --> 01:09:50,090
I know i'd feel more comfortable If I know,
she was receiving that level of supervision.

1083
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:51,288
And, where would you
have us put her?

1084
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:53,600
A psychiatric hospital?

1085
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:55,020
Well, Beverly's gone.

1086
01:09:55,309 --> 01:09:58,137
Well, not so much as "gone"
as "dead," but I see your point.

1087
01:09:58,336 --> 01:10:02,142
Legal guardianship, for you and your
sisters, with my recommendation..

1088
01:10:02,143 --> 01:10:05,675
So you're thinking, if the three of us
cooperated with this,

1089
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:10,515
commitment end-around,
we'd be less likely to sue your ass?

1090
01:10:11,533 --> 01:10:13,830
I'm sorry?
- "Mild Cognitive Impairment?"

1091
01:10:13,831 --> 01:10:15,330
Are you fucking kidding me?

1092
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:18,217
All right?

1093
01:10:18,306 --> 01:10:19,935
Know whose name is
on these bottles?

1094
01:10:20,005 --> 01:10:22,904
Do you?
- Your mother's a very sick person.

1095
01:10:22,905 --> 01:10:25,695
We've a whole bucket of these
with your name on it.

1096
01:10:25,696 --> 01:10:27,195
Evidence for the medical board.

1097
01:10:31,786 --> 01:10:34,371
Let's go.
I thing we're done.

1098
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:50,378
Pull the car over.

1099
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:51,878
We'll be home in a minute.

1100
01:10:52,642 --> 01:10:54,735
Pull the car over.

1101
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:57,917
I'm going to be sick.

1102
01:11:36,067 --> 01:11:38,484
Mom. Mom?

1103
01:11:41,153 --> 01:11:43,459
Mom?!

1104
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,622
Mom!

1105
01:12:08,623 --> 01:12:11,499
Mom!

1106
01:12:11,603 --> 01:12:14,599
Mom! Wait!

1107
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:24,236
Mom!

1108
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:30,730
What are you doing?

1109
01:12:30,731 --> 01:12:33,620
Where the fuck are you going?

1110
01:12:39,619 --> 01:12:42,709
There's no place to go.

1111
01:12:51,173 --> 01:12:52,852
I'm sorry.

1112
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,928
Honey, please?
- No, it's important I say this.

1113
01:13:00,064 --> 01:13:02,123
I lost my temper at dinner
and went too far.

1114
01:13:02,752 --> 01:13:04,461
Barbara.

1115
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,918
The day, the funeral...

1116
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,775
the pills. I was..

1117
01:13:10,854 --> 01:13:13,472
spoiling for a fight and you
gave it to me.

1118
01:13:17,048 --> 01:13:20,569
So... truce?

1119
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:24,920
Truce.
Yeah, sure.

1120
01:13:26,088 --> 01:13:27,907
Now, what?

1121
01:13:30,674 --> 01:13:32,223
How do you mean?

1122
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:37,767
Don't you think you should consider
going back to a rehab center?

1123
01:13:39,135 --> 01:13:41,513
I can't go through that again.

1124
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:43,462
I can do this.

1125
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:45,589
You've..

1126
01:13:45,959 --> 01:13:48,933
You took all my pills, right?

1127
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:50,345
All that we could find.
- Well...

1128
01:13:50,346 --> 01:13:53,525
I don't have that many hiding places.
- Now..Mom, come on.

1129
01:13:53,526 --> 01:13:55,727
You wanna search me?
- No.

1130
01:14:02,082 --> 01:14:05,145
If the pills are gone,
I'll be fine.

1131
01:14:05,146 --> 01:14:11,070
I just need a few days
to get my feet under me.

1132
01:14:11,203 --> 01:14:14,121
I want you to know, you're not alone.
If you need any help.

1133
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,389
I don't need help.

1134
01:14:16,498 --> 01:14:18,876
I wanna help.
- I don't need your help.

1135
01:14:19,165 --> 01:14:20,832
Mom?
- I don't need your help.

1136
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:23,923
I've gotten myself..

1137
01:14:32,582 --> 01:14:34,750
I know how this goes.

1138
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,738
Once all the talking's through,

1139
01:14:36,947 --> 01:14:38,735
people go back to their own..

1140
01:14:38,736 --> 01:14:40,383
...nonsense.

1141
01:14:40,384 --> 01:14:42,063
I know that. So,

1142
01:14:42,752 --> 01:14:46,349
Don't worry about me. I'll manage.
I get by.

1143
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:02,260
Remember when we checked her in the
psych ward, that stunt she pulled?

1144
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:03,450
Big speech..

1145
01:15:03,451 --> 01:15:07,155
she's getting clean, making this
incredible sacrifice for her family,

1146
01:15:07,156 --> 01:15:09,294
she's let us down but now
she'll prove she's a good mother.

1147
01:15:09,295 --> 01:15:11,923
She smuggled Darvocet
into the psych ward..

1148
01:15:12,052 --> 01:15:13,580
...in her vagina.

1149
01:15:13,581 --> 01:15:16,501
There's your Greatest
Generation for you.

1150
01:15:16,502 --> 01:15:18,001
She's giving this speech
to us while she was..

1151
01:15:18,586 --> 01:15:20,794
..clenching a bottle of pills
in her cooch.

1152
01:15:20,844 --> 01:15:23,476
I've never heard this story.

1153
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,976
Did you just say "cooch"?

1154
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:27,038
The phrase "Mom's pussy"
seems gauche.

1155
01:15:27,307 --> 01:15:29,244
You're a little more comfortable
with "cooch," are you?

1156
01:15:29,245 --> 01:15:31,848
What word should I use to describe
our mother's vagina?

1157
01:15:31,849 --> 01:15:34,369
I don't know, Barb.
- "Mom's beaver"?

1158
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:37,447
 "Mother's box"?
- Oh God, Barbara!

1159
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:41,762
One thing about Mom and Dad.

1160
01:15:41,763 --> 01:15:47,856
You have to tip your cap to anybody
who can stay married that long.

1161
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:50,144
Karen. He killed himself.

1162
01:15:50,704 --> 01:15:53,947
We don't know that, for sure.

1163
01:15:56,162 --> 01:15:59,491
Is there something going on between
you and Little Charles?

1164
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:03,784
I don't know that I'm comfortable
talking about that.

1165
01:16:03,785 --> 01:16:06,235
Because, he's our first cousin. You know.
- Give me a break.

1166
01:16:06,236 --> 01:16:08,766
You know you shouldn't
consider children.

1167
01:16:09,495 --> 01:16:13,394
I can't anyway,
I had a hysterectomy last year.

1168
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:15,779
Why?
- Cervical cancer.

1169
01:16:16,847 --> 01:16:19,423
I didn't know.
- Neither did I.

1170
01:16:19,424 --> 01:16:20,923
I didn't tell anyone
except Charles.

1171
01:16:21,053 --> 01:16:22,682
That's where it started between us.

1172
01:16:22,921 --> 01:16:27,384
Why not?
- And hear it from Mom the rest of my life?

1173
01:16:27,797 --> 01:16:30,514
She doesn't need another excuse to
treat me like some damaged thing.

1174
01:16:30,983 --> 01:16:32,742
You might have told us.

1175
01:16:33,591 --> 01:16:35,148
You didn't tell us about you and Bill.
- That's different.

1176
01:16:35,149 --> 01:16:36,648
Why?

1177
01:16:37,067 --> 01:16:39,784
Because it's you, and not me?

1178
01:16:39,785 --> 01:16:44,034
Because divorce is an embarrassing
public admission of defeat.

1179
01:16:44,035 --> 01:16:46,493
Cancer's fucking cancer,
you can't help that.

1180
01:16:46,494 --> 01:16:48,358
We're your sisters.

1181
01:16:49,904 --> 01:16:51,403
I don't feel that
connection very keenly.

1182
01:16:51,433 --> 01:16:54,009
I feel very connected,
to both of you.

1183
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,498
We never see you,
you're never around,

1184
01:16:57,087 --> 01:17:00,003
you haven't been around...
- I still feel that connection!

1185
01:17:00,004 --> 01:17:03,375
I can't perpetuate these myths of family
or sisterhood anymore.

1186
01:17:03,376 --> 01:17:05,877
We're just people, some of us
accidentally connected by genetics,

1187
01:17:05,878 --> 01:17:08,365
a random selection of cells.

1188
01:17:08,366 --> 01:17:11,733
When did you get so cynical?
- That's funny, coming from you.

1189
01:17:12,622 --> 01:17:15,669
Well, Bitter, Yes, but
"random selection of cells?"

1190
01:17:18,256 --> 01:17:21,648
Maybe my cynicism came with the
realization that the responsibility,

1191
01:17:21,649 --> 01:17:24,452
of caring for our
parents was mine alone.

1192
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:26,292
Don't give me that. I participated.

1193
01:17:26,293 --> 01:17:30,624
Till you had enough and got out,
you and Karen both. I'm not criticizing.

1194
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:32,748
Do what you want.
You did, Karen did.

1195
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:34,248
And if you didn't,
that's not my fault.

1196
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,998
That's right, so don't lay this sister
thing on me, all right?

1197
01:17:37,677 --> 01:17:41,732
When I leave here I won't feel
any more guilty than you two did.

1198
01:17:41,733 --> 01:17:44,970
I can't believe
your world view is this dark.

1199
01:17:46,817 --> 01:17:48,776
You live in Florida.

1200
01:17:50,743 --> 01:17:52,431
You're thinking of leaving?

1201
01:17:52,432 --> 01:17:53,931
Yeah.

1202
01:17:55,029 --> 01:17:57,906
Charles and I are
going to New York.

1203
01:17:58,316 --> 01:17:59,935
What are you going
to do in New York?

1204
01:18:00,034 --> 01:18:01,362
We have plans.

1205
01:18:01,363 --> 01:18:04,101
Like what?
- None of your business.

1206
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:05,937
What about Mom?
- What about her?

1207
01:18:05,938 --> 01:18:08,316
You feel comfortable leaving her here?
- Do you?

1208
01:18:11,423 --> 01:18:13,072
You're going back to Miami, right?
- Yes. I can't stay.

1209
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:18,252
There you go, Barb.

1210
01:18:18,253 --> 01:18:21,377
You want to know what we're doing about Mom?
Karen and I are leaving.

1211
01:18:21,378 --> 01:18:25,657
You want to stay, that's your decision.
But nobody gets to point a finger at me.

1212
01:18:25,658 --> 01:18:28,879
Nobody.

1213
01:18:40,933 --> 01:18:43,251
My three girls,

1214
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:45,959
all together.

1215
01:18:48,396 --> 01:18:53,991
Hearing you just now
gave me a warm feeling.

1216
01:18:56,078 --> 01:18:57,186
You had a bath?
- Yeah.

1217
01:18:57,187 --> 01:19:00,053
You want something to eat?
Some coffee?

1218
01:19:00,054 --> 01:19:02,692
I'm fine. Honey, thank you.

1219
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:14,159
I'll bet, this house must have heard
a lot of Weston girl secrets.

1220
01:19:15,319 --> 01:19:19,068
I get embarrassed
just thinking about it.

1221
01:19:20,144 --> 01:19:22,562
Oh... nothing to be
embarrassed about.

1222
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,673
Secret crushes, secret schemes.

1223
01:19:26,717 --> 01:19:30,313
I can't imagine anything more
delicate, or bittersweet.

1224
01:19:30,314 --> 01:19:35,241
Some part of you girls
I always identified with...

1225
01:19:35,242 --> 01:19:37,929
no matter how old you get,

1226
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:44,022
a woman's hard-pressed to throw off
that part of herself.

1227
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,496
That smells so good.

1228
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:51,004
It's apple. You want some?

1229
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:56,507
Sure, I do.

1230
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:03,914
Hey, did I ever tell you
the story of Raymond Qualls?

1231
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:07,957
That's a Boy I had a crush on
when I was thirteen or so.

1232
01:20:09,115 --> 01:20:11,143
Rough-looking boy,

1233
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:16,626
beat-up jeans and messy hair.

1234
01:20:16,627 --> 01:20:18,246
Terrible underbite.

1235
01:20:18,326 --> 01:20:21,823
But he had these
beautiful cowboy boots,

1236
01:20:22,332 --> 01:20:25,219
shiny chocolate leather.

1237
01:20:25,888 --> 01:20:30,374
He was so proud of those boots,
you could tell, the way..

1238
01:20:30,753 --> 01:20:36,168
he'd strut around, all arms and
elbows, puffed up and cocksure.

1239
01:20:36,478 --> 01:20:46,095
I convinced myself that I needed to
get a girly pair of those boots;

1240
01:20:48,316 --> 01:20:51,733
and I was sure if I did that
that he'd ask me to go steady.

1241
01:20:52,532 --> 01:20:57,861
You know, He'd see me in those boots
and say "That's the gal for me."

1242
01:20:58,885 --> 01:21:00,264
Oh, gosh!

1243
01:21:05,848 --> 01:21:10,243
So, I found the boots
in a window downtown,

1244
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:15,369
And, I just went crazy!

1245
01:21:15,968 --> 01:21:18,556
Praying for those boots,
I'm rehearsing the..

1246
01:21:18,635 --> 01:21:23,964
conversation that I'd have with
Raymond when he saw me in my boots.

1247
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:29,084
Must've asked my momma a hundred
times if I could get those boots.

1248
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:31,093
" Vi, What do you
want for Christmas?"

1249
01:21:31,123 --> 01:21:36,372
"Momma, I'll give all of it up just
to have those boots." Bargaining..

1250
01:21:36,373 --> 01:21:43,803
So, She started laying little hints around
about box a package under the tree..

1251
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:48,504
she had wrapped up,
about the size of a boot box,

1252
01:21:48,505 --> 01:21:51,673
Real nice wrapping paper.

1253
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:55,028
"Now, Vi, don't you cheat

1254
01:21:55,029 --> 01:21:58,496
 and don't you go in there
before Christmas morning."

1255
01:21:59,435 --> 01:22:03,635
Little smile on her face.
Christmas morning, I was up like a shot, boy,

1256
01:22:03,636 --> 01:22:07,257
 under the tree,
I was tearing the paper...

1257
01:22:23,061 --> 01:22:27,675
There were boots in there,
men's work boots,

1258
01:22:27,696 --> 01:22:32,516
holes in the toes,
chewed up laces and..

1259
01:22:32,651 --> 01:22:34,280
caked in mud..

1260
01:22:35,149 --> 01:22:39,230
Caked in mud and dog shit.

1261
01:22:45,804 --> 01:22:48,155
Lord,

1262
01:22:48,156 --> 01:22:53,711
my momma laughed for days.

1263
01:22:59,464 --> 01:23:02,302
Please, don't tell me
that's the end of the story.

1264
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:04,530
Oh, no. That..

1265
01:23:07,499 --> 01:23:09,511
That's the end.

1266
01:23:10,493 --> 01:23:12,312
You never got the boots?

1267
01:23:13,999 --> 01:23:16,465
No, huh-uh.

1268
01:23:19,574 --> 01:23:22,352
My momma was a mean..
nasty-mean old lady.

1269
01:23:27,696 --> 01:23:29,505
I suppose that's where I get it..

1270
01:23:30,004 --> 01:23:32,242
..from.

1271
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:40,080
You're not nasty-mean.
You're our mother and we love you.

1272
01:25:17,496 --> 01:25:19,195
Is the coast clear?

1273
01:25:20,094 --> 01:25:21,663
Never very.

1274
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:24,548
What are you watching?

1275
01:25:24,549 --> 01:25:26,148
Television.

1276
01:25:27,533 --> 01:25:29,513
Can I watch it with you?

1277
01:25:29,514 --> 01:25:30,893
I wish you would.

1278
01:25:38,825 --> 01:25:41,593
Are you mad at me?
- Nope.

1279
01:25:47,616 --> 01:25:49,015
I was trying to be brave.

1280
01:25:49,434 --> 01:25:50,893
I know.

1281
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:57,420
I just... I want everyone to know
that I got what I always wanted.

1282
01:25:57,421 --> 01:26:01,667
And that means... I'm not a loser.
- Hey.  Hey.

1283
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:05,269
You're my hero.

1284
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:17,747
I wrote this for you.

1285
01:26:17,748 --> 01:26:19,247
Sit down.

1286
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,206
<i>Well, I've never been a</i>

1287
01:26:36,207 --> 01:26:40,224
<i>man of many words.</i>

1288
01:26:42,683 --> 01:26:48,311
<i>And, there's nothing I could say
that you haven't never heard.</i>

1289
01:26:50,679 --> 01:26:57,588
<i>But, I'll sing you love songs
till the day I die.</i>

1290
01:26:57,866 --> 01:27:04,169
<i>The way I'm feeling,
I can't keep it inside.</i>

1291
01:27:06,024 --> 01:27:11,820
I'll sing a sweet serenade whenever
you're feeling sad.

1292
01:27:13,931 --> 01:27:19,819
<i>And, a lullaby each night
before you go to bed.</i>

1293
01:27:22,481 --> 01:27:28,805
<i>I'll sing to you for the rest of your life..</i>
- Liberace!

1294
01:27:29,534 --> 01:27:31,601
You better get yourself together,

1295
01:27:31,602 --> 01:27:33,809
we have to get home and take care
of those damn dogs.

1296
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:35,309
They've probably eaten
the drapes by now.

1297
01:27:36,128 --> 01:27:39,412
I'm sure the house is fine.
- Oh, look, honey, Little Charles has got the TV on.

1298
01:27:39,413 --> 01:27:41,591
This one watches so
much television,

1299
01:27:41,592 --> 01:27:43,654
it's rotted his brain.
- I'm sure that's not true.

1300
01:27:43,655 --> 01:27:45,159
What was it I caught you
watching the other day?

1301
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:48,424
I don't remember.
- You do so remember,

1302
01:27:48,425 --> 01:27:51,241
..some dumb talk show about
people swapping wives.

1303
01:27:51,242 --> 01:27:52,440
I don't remember.

1304
01:27:52,441 --> 01:27:56,707
Too bad there isn't a job where they
pay you to sit around watching TV.

1305
01:27:56,708 --> 01:28:00,080
C'mon, Mattie Fae..
- Y'know he got fired from a shoe store?

1306
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:01,331
Mattie Fae.

1307
01:28:01,332 --> 01:28:03,670
we're gonna get in
the car and go home.

1308
01:28:04,589 --> 01:28:07,706
And if you say one more mean
thing to that boy..

1309
01:28:07,956 --> 01:28:09,967
I'm going to kick
your fat Irish ass..

1310
01:28:09,968 --> 01:28:12,228
onto the highway.
- What the hell did you say to me?

1311
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:15,291
You kids go outside,
would you please?

1312
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:21,872
I don't understand this meanness.

1313
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:25,968
I look at you and your sister..

1314
01:28:26,517 --> 01:28:29,285
and the way you talk to people
and I don't understand it.

1315
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:33,211
I can't understand why
folks can't be

1316
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,029
respectful of one another.

1317
01:28:35,908 --> 01:28:37,766
I don't think there's
any excuse for it.

1318
01:28:38,395 --> 01:28:40,892
My family didn't treat each other that way.
- Maybe that's because your family...

1319
01:28:40,893 --> 01:28:45,399
You had better not say anything about
my family right now. I mean it.

1320
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:51,692
We buried a man I loved very much.

1321
01:28:52,391 --> 01:28:54,258
And whatever faults..

1322
01:28:54,259 --> 01:28:55,968
he may have had,

1323
01:28:56,038 --> 01:28:57,925
he was a good, kind,

1324
01:28:57,926 --> 01:28:59,884
decent man!

1325
01:29:01,632 --> 01:29:03,960
And to hear you tear
into your own son.

1326
01:29:04,349 --> 01:29:08,006
not even a day later that
dishonors Beverly's memory.

1327
01:29:12,271 --> 01:29:14,819
We've been married
thirty-eight years.

1328
01:29:15,538 --> 01:29:17,656
And I wouldn't trade them
for anything.

1329
01:29:20,323 --> 01:29:23,161
ut if you can't find a
generous place in your heart

1330
01:29:24,199 --> 01:29:26,298
for your own son,

1331
01:29:26,947 --> 01:29:30,899
We're not going to make
it to thirty-nine!

1332
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:56,656
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
I froze.

1333
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,156
That's --

1334
01:30:02,841 --> 01:30:04,809
you have a cigarette, hon?

1335
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:08,054
No, I quit years ago.

1336
01:30:08,055 --> 01:30:10,054
So did I.
Just sounded good to me.

1337
01:30:14,499 --> 01:30:16,676
I thought at dinner...

1338
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:19,005
at that horrible
dinner seemed like,

1339
01:30:19,444 --> 01:30:21,982
something might be going on between
Ivy and Little Charles.

1340
01:30:22,361 --> 01:30:25,002
Do you know if that's true?

1341
01:30:27,056 --> 01:30:28,424
I'm not sure..
- just.

1342
01:30:28,425 --> 01:30:30,134
Is it true?

1343
01:30:33,777 --> 01:30:36,124
Yes. It's true.

1344
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:37,624
Okay.

1345
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:39,864
That can't happen.

1346
01:30:40,203 --> 01:30:42,112
This is going to be difficult,

1347
01:30:42,691 --> 01:30:44,449
 uh... Ivy and Little
Charles have always

1348
01:30:44,589 --> 01:30:48,095
 marched to their own... and I'd
expect this to be toughest on you..

1349
01:30:48,096 --> 01:30:49,403
Barb...?
- They're in love.

1350
01:30:49,404 --> 01:30:53,145
They think they are. I know it's
unorthodox for cousins to get together,

1351
01:30:53,146 --> 01:30:54,645
 ...at least these days.
- They're not cousins.

1352
01:30:56,477 --> 01:30:58,106
Beg pardon?

1353
01:31:00,573 --> 01:31:03,909
Little Charles is not your cousin.
He's your brother.

1354
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:05,878
He's your blood brother.

1355
01:31:06,357 --> 01:31:07,936
Half brother.

1356
01:31:09,604 --> 01:31:11,333
He's your father's child.

1357
01:31:12,761 --> 01:31:14,629
Which means that he
is Ivy's brother.

1358
01:31:17,242 --> 01:31:19,153
Do you see?

1359
01:31:19,154 --> 01:31:21,251
Go away.

1360
01:31:21,252 --> 01:31:23,389
We're just going to...
- Go away!  NOW!  GO AWAY!

1361
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:24,889
All righ..alright.

1362
01:31:29,644 --> 01:31:31,193
You and Dad.

1363
01:31:31,872 --> 01:31:33,399
Who knows this?

1364
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,518
I do. And you do.

1365
01:31:35,947 --> 01:31:39,095
Uncle Charlie doesn't suspect?
- We've never discussed it.

1366
01:31:39,324 --> 01:31:42,792
What?
- We've never discussed it. Okay?

1367
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,798
Did Dad know?

1368
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:46,298
Yes.

1369
01:31:47,646 --> 01:31:50,092
Y'know, I'm not proud of this.
- Really.

1370
01:31:50,093 --> 01:31:51,702
You people amaze me.

1371
01:31:51,852 --> 01:31:54,879
What, were you drunk? Was this just some..
- I wasn't drunk, no.

1372
01:31:56,727 --> 01:31:59,223
Maybe it's hard for you to believe,
looking at me, knowing me the way

1373
01:31:59,224 --> 01:32:03,129
you do, all these years. I mean, I know to you,
I'm just your old fat Aunt Mattie Fae.

1374
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:05,289
I'm more than that, sweetheart,

1375
01:32:06,257 --> 01:32:11,027
there's more to me than that.

1376
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:16,726
I don't know why Little Charles
is such a disappointment to me.

1377
01:32:16,727 --> 01:32:18,625
Maybe he,

1378
01:32:20,603 --> 01:32:22,521
well, I don't know why.

1379
01:32:25,798 --> 01:32:30,001
I'm disappointed for him,
more than anything.

1380
01:32:36,677 --> 01:32:39,519
I made a mistake, a long time ago.

1381
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,938
Okay? I paid for it.

1382
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:46,957
But the mistake ends here.

1383
01:32:48,964 --> 01:32:50,983
If Ivy found out,
it would destroy her.

1384
01:32:51,022 --> 01:32:52,941
I'm sure as hell not
gonna tell her.

1385
01:32:54,189 --> 01:32:57,802
You have to find a way to stop it.

1386
01:32:57,803 --> 01:33:02,485
You have to put a stop to it.

1387
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:45,628
Hold it.

1388
01:33:45,648 --> 01:33:47,396
Don't let it out.

1389
01:33:48,215 --> 01:33:49,774
That's a kick, huh?

1390
01:34:07,576 --> 01:34:10,689
If you won't look,
there's no point in showing them to you.

1391
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:12,590
Okay, okay.
I'll look.

1392
01:34:12,591 --> 01:34:14,398
You're gonna get us
both in trouble.

1393
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,397
I'm white and over thirty.
I don't get in trouble.

1394
01:34:22,305 --> 01:34:23,696
Oh my God...

1395
01:34:23,697 --> 01:34:25,196
Oh, my God!

1396
01:34:25,727 --> 01:34:27,904
Goddamn it!
- Stop it!

1397
01:34:27,905 --> 01:34:29,904
Stop! Stop!

1398
01:34:31,831 --> 01:34:33,640
What is wrong with you?

1399
01:34:35,857 --> 01:34:37,135
Steve!

1400
01:34:37,136 --> 01:34:39,163
What happened?

1401
01:34:39,164 --> 01:34:41,196
She was messing with Jean?

1402
01:34:41,197 --> 01:34:42,395
Baby are you okay?

1403
01:34:42,396 --> 01:34:45,403
Jean, what are you doing up?

1404
01:34:45,404 --> 01:34:46,576
Do I need to call a doctor?

1405
01:34:46,577 --> 01:34:48,405
I don't know.

1406
01:34:49,244 --> 01:34:51,211
Johnna, what's going on?

1407
01:34:51,212 --> 01:34:53,113
He was messing with Jean,
so, I tuned him up.

1408
01:34:53,114 --> 01:34:54,613
Messing with, what do you mean,
messing with?

1409
01:34:55,038 --> 01:34:57,315
He was kissing and grabbing her.

1410
01:34:57,316 --> 01:34:58,868
I'll murder you, you prick!

1411
01:34:58,869 --> 01:35:00,368
You know how old that girl is?

1412
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,947
She's fourteen years old!
- I didn't do anything!

1413
01:35:04,948 --> 01:35:07,973
Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- Just back off, Barbara!

1414
01:35:07,974 --> 01:35:09,782
That son-of-a-bitch is a sociopath!

1415
01:35:09,783 --> 01:35:13,080
What is the matter with you?
Will you please stop freaking out?

1416
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,009
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

1417
01:35:15,218 --> 01:35:18,535
What are you even doing up?
- Sweetheart, we need to know what went on here.

1418
01:35:18,794 --> 01:35:20,563
Nothing "went on."

1419
01:35:20,992 --> 01:35:26,975
Nothing, okay? Can we not turn
everything a federal case here? okay..

1420
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,473
I came down smoked a little pot.
Smoked a little pot and..

1421
01:35:31,012 --> 01:35:34,403
we were just goofing around and then
everything just got a little bit crazy.

1422
01:35:34,404 --> 01:35:37,428
What have I told you about smoking that shit?!
- Then Johnna just chose to attack him with a shovel?

1423
01:35:38,455 --> 01:35:41,111
Just tell me what he did!
- He didn't do anything!

1424
01:35:41,112 --> 01:35:43,804
What's the big deal?
- The big deal, Jean,

1425
01:35:43,805 --> 01:35:45,304
is that you're fourteen years old.

1426
01:35:46,047 --> 01:35:48,086
Just a few years younger than
you like em.

1427
01:35:51,644 --> 01:35:53,642
I hate you!

1428
01:35:53,643 --> 01:35:57,041
What's the matter with you?

1429
01:35:57,995 --> 01:35:59,404
Jean.

1430
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:10,853
I can do without a speech.
- Where is he?

1431
01:36:10,854 --> 01:36:14,220
Out at the car. We're leaving.
Back to Florida, tonight, now.

1432
01:36:14,469 --> 01:36:16,177
Me and Steve, together.

1433
01:36:16,197 --> 01:36:19,457
You wannna give me some grief about that?
- Now you wait goddamn it.

1434
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:22,438
You better find out from Jean
exactly what went on..

1435
01:36:22,439 --> 01:36:23,636
before you start pointing fingers.

1436
01:36:23,637 --> 01:36:27,372
Because, I doubt Jean's
blameless in all this.

1437
01:36:27,373 --> 01:36:29,762
And I'm not saying
that I blame her..

1438
01:36:29,763 --> 01:36:34,042
just cause I said she's not blameless,
It doesn't mean I've blamed her.

1439
01:36:34,043 --> 01:36:38,616
I'm saying she might
share in the responsibility.

1440
01:36:39,104 --> 01:36:40,871
It's not cut and dried,

1441
01:36:40,872 --> 01:36:44,568
It lives where everything lives,
somewhere in the middle.

1442
01:36:44,569 --> 01:36:46,355
Where the rest of us live,

1443
01:36:46,356 --> 01:36:48,500
everyone but you.
- Karen--

1444
01:36:48,501 --> 01:36:50,433
I'm no angel myself.

1445
01:36:50,892 --> 01:36:53,170
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

1446
01:36:54,289 --> 01:36:56,137
Things you'll never know about.

1447
01:36:56,646 --> 01:36:59,614
And, I may even have to do some
things I'm not proud of again.

1448
01:37:00,822 --> 01:37:05,613
Cause, life puts you
in a corner that way.

1449
01:37:06,986 --> 01:37:10,798
Anyway..
You have your own hash to settle.

1450
01:37:10,799 --> 01:37:14,946
Before you start making
speeches to the rest of us.

1451
01:37:15,797 --> 01:37:19,696
And, Come January...
I'll be in Belize.

1452
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:26,175
Doesn't that sound nice?

1453
01:37:40,552 --> 01:37:44,813
I'm taking Jean with me, heading
back to Colorado in the morning.

1454
01:37:50,193 --> 01:37:51,922
You're never coming back to me,
Are you, Bill?

1455
01:37:57,456 --> 01:37:59,234
Never say, never.

1456
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:04,659
But no.

1457
01:38:08,894 --> 01:38:11,182
And I'll probably never really
understand why, am I?

1458
01:38:17,555 --> 01:38:19,094
Probably not.

1459
01:38:58,834 --> 01:39:00,813
Where are Bill and Jean going?

1460
01:39:01,611 --> 01:39:03,430
Karen, left too?

1461
01:39:04,029 --> 01:39:05,418
Yeah.

1462
01:39:05,777 --> 01:39:07,496
Is mom clean?

1463
01:39:09,683 --> 01:39:12,429
She's moderately clean.
- Moderately?

1464
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:13,910
You don't like moderately?
Then let's say..

1465
01:39:13,911 --> 01:39:15,109
...tolerably.
Is she clean, or not?

1466
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:16,609
Back off.
- I'm nervous.

1467
01:39:18,954 --> 01:39:20,531
Oh Christ, Ivy, not today.
- I have to tell her, though.

1468
01:39:20,532 --> 01:39:22,481
We're leaving for
New York tomorrow.

1469
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:25,868
I don't think, it's a good idea.
For you and Charles to take this any further.

1470
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:27,631
Where is this coming from?

1471
01:39:27,632 --> 01:39:28,792
There's lot of fish in the sea.

1472
01:39:28,793 --> 01:39:32,430
Surely you can rule out the one single
man in the world you're related to.

1473
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:33,629
I love the man I'm related to.

1474
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:37,155
Fuck love, what a crock of shit.
Love..

1475
01:39:37,156 --> 01:39:41,644
People can convince themselves
they love a painted rock.

1476
01:39:42,241 --> 01:39:44,687
Looks great. What is it?

1477
01:39:44,688 --> 01:39:45,886
Catfish.

1478
01:39:45,887 --> 01:39:48,623
Bottom feeders, my favorite.

1479
01:39:48,624 --> 01:39:52,438
You're nearly fifty years old, Ivy, you
can't go to New York, you'll break a hip.

1480
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:56,363
Here, Eat your catfish.
- Oh, you're infuriating..

1481
01:39:56,364 --> 01:39:59,345
I'm not the one,
who's fucking my cousin.

1482
01:39:59,378 --> 01:40:01,181
I have lived in this town,
year in and year out,

1483
01:40:01,182 --> 01:40:03,408
hoping against hope someone
would come into my life..

1484
01:40:03,409 --> 01:40:05,737
Don't get all Carson
McCullers on me.

1485
01:40:05,738 --> 01:40:11,609
Now, wipe that tragic look off
your face and eat some catfish.

1486
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:20,376
Howdy, Mom.
- What's howdy about it?

1487
01:40:20,377 --> 01:40:22,522
Look, catfish for lunch.
Johnna!

1488
01:40:22,523 --> 01:40:25,435
You hungry?
- Ivy, you should smile. Like me.

1489
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,821
Mom needs her lunch, please.

1490
01:40:27,822 --> 01:40:29,602
I'm not hungry.

1491
01:40:29,603 --> 01:40:31,893
You didn't eaten anything today.
You didn't eat anything yesterday.

1492
01:40:31,894 --> 01:40:33,092
I'm not hungry.

1493
01:40:33,093 --> 01:40:35,435
You're eating, do what I say.

1494
01:40:35,436 --> 01:40:37,874
Everyone do what I say.

1495
01:40:37,875 --> 01:40:41,791
Why aren't either
of you is dressed?

1496
01:40:41,961 --> 01:40:43,608
It's not like we're
sitting here naked.

1497
01:40:43,609 --> 01:40:46,167
Right, we are dressed.
Or, should we be dressed up?

1498
01:40:46,287 --> 01:40:48,285
Right, cos you're
coming over for fish?

1499
01:40:48,424 --> 01:40:50,872
I'll eat in my room.
- That's fine, thank you.

1500
01:40:53,699 --> 01:40:54,811
Eat.
- No.

1501
01:40:54,812 --> 01:40:56,311
Eat it, Mom.

1502
01:40:56,826 --> 01:40:58,483
Eat it.
- No.

1503
01:40:58,484 --> 01:41:00,581
Eat it, you fucker.
Eat that catfish.

1504
01:41:00,582 --> 01:41:01,780
Go to hell.

1505
01:41:01,781 --> 01:41:04,782
That ain't cutting fucking ice with me.
Eat that fucking fish.

1506
01:41:04,783 --> 01:41:05,981
Mom, I have something to talk to you about.
- No you don't.

1507
01:41:05,982 --> 01:41:08,380
Barbara--
- No you don't. Shut up.

1508
01:41:08,381 --> 01:41:09,223
Shut the fuck up.

1509
01:41:09,224 --> 01:41:12,260
Please--
- What's to talk about?

1510
01:41:12,261 --> 01:41:15,409
Forget it. Eat that fucking fish.
- I'm not hungry.

1511
01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:16,735
EAT THE FISH, BITCH!

1512
01:41:16,736 --> 01:41:17,934
Barbara...!

1513
01:41:17,935 --> 01:41:22,232
Okay, fine, fuck it,
do what you want.

1514
01:41:26,217 --> 01:41:28,385
I have to tell you something.

1515
01:41:29,094 --> 01:41:31,408
Ivy's a lesbian.
- Barbara--

1516
01:41:31,409 --> 01:41:33,628
No, you're not.
- No, I'm not--

1517
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:35,317
Yes, you are.
Did you eat your fish?

1518
01:41:35,318 --> 01:41:36,516
Barbara, stop it!

1519
01:41:36,517 --> 01:41:38,960
Mom, please.
This is important.

1520
01:41:38,961 --> 01:41:42,357
Eat your fish. Eat your fish.
Eat your fish.

1521
01:41:42,358 --> 01:41:44,407
What the fuck!

1522
01:41:44,408 --> 01:41:47,694
I have something to say.
- Are we breaking shit now? huh?

1523
01:41:47,695 --> 01:41:49,564
cause I can break shit!

1524
01:41:50,502 --> 01:41:52,779
Hey, see, we can all break shit.

1525
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:55,046
Charles and I..
- You don't want to break shit with me,

1526
01:41:55,047 --> 01:41:56,546
muthah-fuckah..
- Charles and I

1527
01:41:57,216 --> 01:41:58,543
Johnna?! Little spill in here!

1528
01:41:58,544 --> 01:41:59,742
Barbara, stop it!

1529
01:41:59,743 --> 01:42:03,678
Mom, Charles and I..

1530
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:06,351
Little Charles.
- Barbara --

1531
01:42:06,352 --> 01:42:09,625
You gotta say Little Charles or she is
not gonna know who you're talking about.

1532
01:42:11,102 --> 01:42:12,471
Little Charles and I...

1533
01:42:13,929 --> 01:42:15,358
Little Charles and I are --

1534
01:42:15,827 --> 01:42:18,705
Little Charles and you
are brother and sister.

1535
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:20,942
I know that.

1536
01:42:23,549 --> 01:42:25,388
What? No,

1537
01:42:25,507 --> 01:42:26,715
Little Charles and I..

1538
01:42:26,716 --> 01:42:28,575
I've always known that.

1539
01:42:31,212 --> 01:42:33,010
I told you, nobody
slips anything by me.

1540
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:35,370
Mom --
- Don't listen.

1541
01:42:36,746 --> 01:42:38,774
I knew the whole time
Bev and Mattie Fae were carrying on.

1542
01:42:38,854 --> 01:42:42,491
Charlie should have known too,
if he wasn't smoking all that grass.

1543
01:42:42,492 --> 01:42:44,539
It's the pills talking.
- Pills can't talk.

1544
01:42:45,657 --> 01:42:47,494
Your father tore
himself up over it,

1545
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:50,416
thirty some-odd years, but..

1546
01:42:50,642 --> 01:42:54,267
Beverly wouldn't have been Beverly if
he didn't have plenty to brood about.

1547
01:42:54,268 --> 01:42:57,496
Mom, what are you about?

1548
01:42:57,497 --> 01:43:00,662
Better you girls know now though,
now you're older.

1549
01:43:00,663 --> 01:43:04,117
You never know when someone
might need a kidney.

1550
01:43:06,316 --> 01:43:08,893
Why in God's name
did you tell me this?

1551
01:43:08,894 --> 01:43:10,473
Hey, what do you care?

1552
01:43:14,149 --> 01:43:15,688
You're monsters.

1553
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:18,165
Come on now!
- Monsters...

1554
01:43:18,664 --> 01:43:23,016
Who's the injured party here?

1555
01:43:24,828 --> 01:43:28,235
Ivy, listen...
- You will never see me, again.

1556
01:43:28,414 --> 01:43:31,036
Mattie Fae told me,
I didn't know what to do.

1557
01:43:31,037 --> 01:43:32,070
I was trying to protect you.

1558
01:43:32,071 --> 01:43:34,420
We'll go anyway,
we'll still go away.

1559
01:43:34,421 --> 01:43:38,041
This is not my fault.
Mom told you! It wasn't me, it was Mom!

1560
01:43:38,155 --> 01:43:40,023
There's no difference.

1561
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:06,537
Ivy..Ivy!

1562
01:44:16,424 --> 01:44:18,810
Ivy!

1563
01:44:54,868 --> 01:44:58,803
We couldn't let Ivy run off
with Little Charles.

1564
01:44:59,373 --> 01:45:01,152
Just wouldn't be right.

1565
01:45:03,969 --> 01:45:05,737
She'll be back.

1566
01:45:07,495 --> 01:45:11,667
She's a sweet girl, Ivy,
and I love her to death. But..

1567
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:14,698
she isn't strong.

1568
01:45:15,357 --> 01:45:16,716
Not like you.

1569
01:45:17,905 --> 01:45:19,683
Or me.

1570
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:24,347
You knew about Daddy
and Mattie Fae?

1571
01:45:24,668 --> 01:45:25,756
Oh sure.

1572
01:45:25,757 --> 01:45:27,256
Sure.

1573
01:45:27,715 --> 01:45:29,294
But, I never told them I knew.

1574
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,801
But your father knew.
He knew I knew.

1575
01:45:33,269 --> 01:45:35,158
But, we never talked about it.

1576
01:45:37,075 --> 01:45:40,971
I chose the higher ground.

1577
01:45:41,681 --> 01:45:44,309
If I'd had the chance,
there at the end,

1578
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:45,809
I would've..

1579
01:45:45,957 --> 01:45:49,900
I would've told him,
"I hope this isn't about Little Charles,

1580
01:45:49,901 --> 01:45:53,009
cause you know I know
all about that."

1581
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:56,168
If I'd reached him at that motel,
I would've said,

1582
01:45:56,169 --> 01:45:57,668
"You'd be better off if you quit

1583
01:45:57,915 --> 01:46:01,212
sulking about this
ancient history."

1584
01:46:03,309 --> 01:46:04,958
..what motel?

1585
01:46:05,117 --> 01:46:07,386
I called over there on Monday

1586
01:46:07,875 --> 01:46:11,412
after I got into that safety deposit box.
But it was too late,

1587
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,153
he'd checked out.

1588
01:46:14,154 --> 01:46:16,208
How did you know where he was?

1589
01:46:16,209 --> 01:46:21,980
The note. He said I could call him
over at the Country Squire Motel.

1590
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,239
He left a note?

1591
01:46:24,518 --> 01:46:28,192
And I did, I called
over there on Monday.

1592
01:46:28,364 --> 01:46:30,371
After you got your money,

1593
01:46:30,372 --> 01:46:31,901
out of your safety deposit box...

1594
01:46:35,167 --> 01:46:36,776
We had..

1595
01:46:36,986 --> 01:46:39,633
..an arrangement.
You have to understand,

1596
01:46:41,101 --> 01:46:43,318
for people like your father and me,

1597
01:46:43,319 --> 01:46:46,327
who never had any money,
ever, as kids,

1598
01:46:47,095 --> 01:46:51,078
people from our generation,
that money is important.

1599
01:46:51,079 --> 01:46:52,578
If you could've stopped Daddy

1600
01:46:53,819 --> 01:46:59,261
from killing himself, you wouldn't have
needed to get into your safety deposit box.

1601
01:47:01,731 --> 01:47:04,049
Well, hindsight's always twenty
twenty, isn't it?

1602
01:47:04,598 --> 01:47:07,176
Did the note say he was
going to kill himself?

1603
01:47:09,043 --> 01:47:10,502
Mom?

1604
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:15,016
If I had my..

1605
01:47:15,017 --> 01:47:18,614
wits about me, maybe
I might've done it different. But..

1606
01:47:19,093 --> 01:47:20,572
I was,

1607
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:23,618
your father and me both,

1608
01:47:23,619 --> 01:47:26,486
we were...
- You were both fucked-up...

1609
01:47:26,926 --> 01:47:28,894
You were fucked-up...

1610
01:47:30,292 --> 01:47:31,806
You are fucked-up.

1611
01:47:31,807 --> 01:47:37,965
You'd better understand this,
you smug little ingrate.

1612
01:47:38,734 --> 01:47:42,870
There's only  one reason Beverly
killed himself and that's you.

1613
01:47:43,009 --> 01:47:47,353
Think there's any way he would've done
what he did if you were still here?

1614
01:47:47,354 --> 01:47:48,783
No,

1615
01:47:48,784 --> 01:47:53,388
just him and me,
in this house, alone in the dark,

1616
01:47:53,389 --> 01:47:57,454
abandoned, wasted lifetimes
devoted to your care and comfort.

1617
01:47:57,455 --> 01:47:58,834
Oh, yes..

1618
01:47:59,073 --> 01:48:04,027
You stick that knife of judgment in me,
go ahead, but make no mistake,

1619
01:48:04,028 --> 01:48:07,216
his blood is just as much on
your hands as it is on mine.

1620
01:48:08,364 --> 01:48:09,823
He did this though,

1621
01:48:10,132 --> 01:48:12,970
This is his doing, not ours.

1622
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:20,421
Can you imagine anything more cruel,
to make me responsible?

1623
01:48:20,422 --> 01:48:21,620
Why?

1624
01:48:21,621 --> 01:48:25,598
Just to weaken me,
make me prove my character?

1625
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:29,888
So, No. I waited, I waited to get my
hands on that safety deposit box.

1626
01:48:29,889 --> 01:48:31,655
But, I would have waited anyway.

1627
01:48:31,656 --> 01:48:34,666
You want to show
who's stronger, Bev?

1628
01:48:34,667 --> 01:48:38,446
Nobody's stronger than me, goddamn it.
When nothing is left,

1629
01:48:38,447 --> 01:48:40,986
when everything is gone
and disappeared,

1630
01:48:40,987 --> 01:48:43,917
I'll be here.

1631
01:48:48,004 --> 01:48:50,562
Who's stronger now,
you son-of-a-bitch?!

1632
01:48:54,323 --> 01:48:56,101
You're right, Mom.

1633
01:48:56,102 --> 01:49:00,453
You're the strong one.

1634
01:49:13,229 --> 01:49:14,998
Barbara?

1635
01:49:19,383 --> 01:49:21,132
Barbara?

1636
01:49:22,969 --> 01:49:24,868
Oh, Barb?

1637
01:49:25,277 --> 01:49:27,415
Barbara?!

1638
01:49:30,612 --> 01:49:33,200
Barbara?

1639
01:49:37,285 --> 01:49:39,034
Barbara?!!

1640
01:49:53,349 --> 01:49:54,968
Ivy?!

1641
01:49:58,474 --> 01:50:00,372
Ivy, you here?!

1642
01:51:04,917 --> 01:51:06,756
Johnna?!

1643
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:27,865
Johnna?!

1644
01:51:35,696 --> 01:51:37,725
Johnna?!

1645
01:51:46,855 --> 01:51:51,603
And then you're gone, and Beverly,

1646
01:54:12,714 --> 01:54:16,828
