1
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:13,387
I hate those things.

2
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,900

Ummm.
Put that back !

17
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:06,509
Hey, I just washed
all this stuff.

18
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:08,514
It's my gear.
Sorry, man.

19
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,020
It's okay.
What's my mom
screaming about ?

20
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,528
She's bummed 'cause I
snaked your last bagel.

21
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:19,039
Grab a shovel,
man.
No, I just
wanna munch.

22
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,043
You don't wanna help,
that's just fine.

23
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:26,055
Uh-huh.
You know, this is a total waste of time.

24
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:30,064
Dave, be more of a geek.
There's no way
you're going to the prom.

25
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:32,569
You're a disease.
Ahh.

26
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:36,078
And no one will ever swim
in this stupid pool.
Hey !

27
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:37,581
Later.

28
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:42,092
Look, David,
please do me a favor
and stress less, bro.

29
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:44,096
High school
is over, buddy.

30
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:47,103
Get into it.
We're losers.

31
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:50,110
I've decided something, stoney.
I wanna look back on
my high school career,

32
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:53,618
and think that I started
slowly but I finished
strong, you know ?

33
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,625
High school's almost over
and I don't have
anything to show for it.

34
00:04:57,126 --> 00:05:00,634
I know, me neither.
You should be stoked
though, buddy,

35
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,641
'cause you got through
the last four years without
the full-on melon tweekage.

36
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:08,152
It's not enough.
I mean, I want my own
page in the yearbook.

37
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:13,163
Jump off the gym,
splatter on the street
and go for the co-ver.

38
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:16,671
It's not funny.
I'm not goin' down as
this geek kid from Encino.

39
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:21,182
When I finish this pool,
I'm gonna have the
killer party after the prom.

40
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:25,692
I'm gonna be the prom king !
And I'm gonna graduate a legend.

41
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:29,701
Well, what about me ?

42
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:32,708
Oh, well you'll
be there too.

43
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:38,721
Thanks, but Robyn sweeney,
she's not goin' to
the prom with you, man.

44
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,230
-I wish she would but she's not.
-What are you talkin' about ?

45
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,735
Robyn sweeney
is mine.

46
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:47,242
She's become a major babe
and she loves me.

47
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:50,249
She finds you crusty,
Dave.
I'll convince her.

48
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,756
She'll see
the truth.
Truth is...

49
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:57,265
Life's about greasin'
the do-back, buddy
and weasin' on the buffest.

50
00:05:57,765 --> 00:05:59,770
High school was
interesting, right,

51
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,777
but it was kind of
like a harsh ride.
O-o-o-ow.

52
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:05,283
We're goin' on to bigger
and better things, buddy.

53
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,791
Stoney, I am on to
bigger and better things.

54
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:14,304
Count on it !

55
00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:28,837
Oh, wow !
Hey, what's up ?

56
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:32,345
♪ I'm a stoney crusty dude
♪ Did you know that ?
Get out, dude.

57
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:35,352
♪ I got a mop on top ♪
Watch out !

58
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:40,364
Excuse me. Could you move.
Me and my friend, David
are comin' through.

59
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:43,371
Hey, there's Robyn.
Hey, Robyn.
O-o-o-ow !

60
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:53,394
Four-wheelin'
over the ferns.

61
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:57,403
Look, Dave, you're gonna
have to mellow out, bro,
on this whole Robyn thing.

62
00:06:57,403 --> 00:07:00,911
She always shines ya.
You don't understand.
We have history.

63
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:05,421
You had pre-freshman
history. You could've
had her back then.

64
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:08,929
She hadn't hit
"babehood" yet.

65
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,438
Milk does a body good.
Check her.

66
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:14,943
She's clean, buddy,

67
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,950
and he's got her.

68
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,458
Matt Wilson ?
What a jerk.

69
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,463
What does she
see in him anyway ?

70
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:27,472
He's got the buff spikes
chillin' the top of his melon.

71
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:30,479
Dude, he's checkin'
her cheeks. Ooh !

72
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,991
He's got the serious beak,
his own personal... oh !
Holding company,

73
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,996
full of fundage, bro,

74
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:43,509
that he weases off of ma--jor.

75
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:46,014
Eighteen inch bi's.
Bye-bye.

76
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:48,019
Mine are only four.

77
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:50,024
Besides that.

78
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:52,028
He walks like this,
right ?

79
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:56,037
Just like this,
the nugs fully loose.

80
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:10,070
Hi, Matt.

81
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:13,077
Hi, Matt.

82
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:15,081
All right, everybody.
Quiet, please.

83
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:18,590
Settle down, quiet. We're gonna start
this week's class...

84
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,594
Same place we ended
last week's class.

85
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:23,100
That's talking about prehistoric man
in the what ?

86
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,606
Prehistoric man in the -- ?
Oh, stoney ?

87
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:30,116
- Ice age.
- Yes, ice age. That's right, the ice age.

88
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:33,123
Why do we call it the ice age ?
'Cause there was a lot of ice.

89
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:36,631
What do we call
these big chunks of ice,
those big slabs of ice ?

90
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:39,136
We called what ?
What do we call them ?
Glaciers.

91
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:42,645
Right. You are paying
attention. That's good.

92
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:45,652
These glaciers, as they
moved down our way,

93
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:49,661
they're so heavy, cold
and thick that they
freeze the ground water...

94
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:52,668
- And they form underground -- ?
- Glaciers.

95
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:57,680
Right. Believe it or not, some scientists
believe that there are actual...

96
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,687
Underground glacial movements
still in this part of the world.

97
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,691
You know what I think
that is, class ?

98
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:06,700
Lame !
Exactly. Bunco, bogus.

99
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,206
Listen,
please remember...

100
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:12,714
That most of this hemisphere,
including the ground
I'm walking on,

101
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:14,719
all of this was under ice
at some point, so I guess...

102
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:17,726
Finding something frozen,
dug up here or there,

103
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:19,730
wouldn't be that uncommon
when you think about it.

104
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:23,340
So moving right along
on your journey of knowledge,

105
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,581
- Here, let me show you cro-magnon man.
- Woo !

106
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:29,754
He's dope.
I'd go out with him.

107
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:31,759
No, no.

108
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:36,271
I don't think so, Ella.
Cro-magnon man, even though
he's not bad-lookin',

109
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:38,776
he's standin' upright and all,
he was extremely brutal.

110
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:41,282
He just took
whatever he wanted...

111
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,788
And that included
his women.

112
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:46,795
That's barbaric !
Indeed.

113
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,843
Stone !
Stoney !

114
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:18,872
Hey ! Come on,
check this out.
That's my lobes.

115
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:22,882
Feel the ground,
man.

116
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:25,889
Whoa, buddy,
it's chillin'.

117
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,897
It's not like
chillin', chillin'.

118
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:32,906
Bro, it is chillin' !
I know.
It's cold !

119
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:37,417
It's so, uh --
help me.

120
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:39,423
Check it, buddy.

121
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,628
Oh, buddy !

122
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:45,437
Dude, I know
what this is, bro.
What is it ?

123
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,945
It's a
mousterian bowl.
No way !

124
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:51,952
Hey, come on, David.
Be careful with that.

125
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,957
What's a mousterian bowl ?

126
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:56,965
A mousterian bowl
from the mousterian era.

127
00:10:56,965 --> 00:11:00,974
"Prehistoric artifacts
for five hundred, Alex."

128
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:04,983
Don't you ever
watch "jeopardy" ?

129
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:10,497
Buddy, this is kind of like
prehistoric tupperware, bro.

130
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:14,507
It's still preserved...
Like smuckers !

131
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,514
Oooow !

132
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:20,521
Earthquake !
Earthquake !

133
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:23,027
Earthquake !

134
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:25,534
Ahhhh !

135
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:29,041
Oh !

136
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:30,545
Oh God !
Oh God !

137
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,837
Nice save, Davage.

138
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:01,620
Stone ?
Yeah.

139
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,128
There's a guy
buried in my pool.

140
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:11,142
Hello, Fred.
I'm glad I caught you.

141
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:13,650
Are you available
for a meeting
sometime this week ?

142
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,656
Ms. Morgan,
open the door !
Mom !

143
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:21,668
Mom, there's a guy
buried in our pool !

144
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:24,174
Mom ! Mom !
Open the door !

145
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:26,179
I'm working !

146
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:30,690
Call 9-1-1 !
Call 9-1-1 !

147
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,715
They never found
Jim morrison.

148
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:43,722
Yeah, or Jimmy hoffa.

149
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,731
Or Jimmy Mahoney.

150
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,237
He was a kid I knew
in cub scouts.

151
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,242
Come on,
let's go.

152
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:54,748
They never
found him.

153
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:02,768
David, I know
what this is.
What ?

154
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:06,275
It's a caveman.
Would you please !

155
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:09,283
No, I'm serious.

156
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:13,794
No way !

157
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,301
Whoa.
A caveman !

158
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:22,816
This is unbelievable !
Do you know what
this could mean for us ?

159
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:25,823
This could mean --
this could mean fame
or money !

160
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:27,828
Or popularity !

161
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:30,333
Far too much
responsibility for me.

162
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,840
Anyways,
I'm already popular.

163
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,347
Yeah, you travel
in large groups
of one, stoney.

164
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,857
Besides, this is
my one chance to make
somethin' out of myself.

165
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:43,364
You gotta help me dig
him out. You were here.
You're part of it.

166
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:48,879
I don't wanna be part
of anything, Dave.
I'm happy just to be me.

167
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,885
It could mean money.

168
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:57,399
You tellin' me you
couldn't use a,
a new scooter ?

169
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,905
Some new Bell-bottoms ?

170
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,912
A little fun-dage ?

171
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:07,423
Wease some older nugs
with a mansion and a pool ?

172
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:10,430
Soakin' up the rays,

173
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:14,439
watchin' all the
"jeop-ardy" you can handle ?

174
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:17,948
That was the clincher.
Everybody's got a price.
Come on, man.

175
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:33,987
Steady it !
Give it more gas,
more gas !

176
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:36,493
Perfect ! Hold !

177
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:40,502
This thing
weighs a ton.

178
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,059
Ahh !

179
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:13,582
Hey, there's his pits,
bro.

180
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:19,095
That's his head.

181
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:21,101
That's his skull.

182
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,637
Get off me !

183
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:40,146
What are you
doin' ?
I don't like mornings.

184
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:43,153
Ow ! Come on,
let's get up.

185
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,661
He's still in here.

186
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:50,671
No kidding, Dave.
He's an ice cube.

187
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:54,680
We gotta
thaw him out.
Okay.

188
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:58,391
This has gotta be
our secret, okay ?

189
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,997
You can't tell anybody...
Nobody !

190
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,604
Can I tell
Steve Kooser ?
No one !

191
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:07,211
All right ? Nobody !
You understand ?
Yeah, zip...

192
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:09,035
- Thank you.
- Dee-do-dah.

193
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,767
- Well it's kind of nice.
- Yeah, you're really swell today.

194
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:31,373
- Hi, Robyn.
- Hi, Dave.

195
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,700
- Guess what I found ?
- A life ?

196
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:38,044
No. Come here.
Guess what I found ?

197
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,482
- I don't know.
- Guess ? Guess ?
- I have no idea.

198
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:43,470
I found a caveman.
A caveman ?

199
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:46,635
Shh. Yeah.
Oh Dave,
you're drowning.

200
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,690
It's cool, right ?
I found a caveman.

201
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,849
All by myself.
I dug him out
of my backyard.

202
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,522
You wanna come check him out
after school ?
Well, uh --

203
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,561
I'm only invitin'
a few people.
I got that
prom thing.

204
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:01,066
Ten minutes...
Please ?

205
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:05,922
Dave, I just don't think
I'm ready to handle a --

206
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,507
a caveman.

207
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:08,770
You're not ?

208
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,986
All right.

209
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:14,363
I understand.

210
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,553
Bye, David.

211
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,015
I love it when
she calls me David.

212
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:27,025
Hello, David.
Agh.

213
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,031
Goin' somewhere ?

214
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:32,040
Yeah, I got a date
with your mom.
That's not nice.

215
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,048
It's a joke.
I'm sorry, just kidding.

216
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:02,623
You've been a headache
ever since the third grade.
God !

217
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,432
I know about your stupid
prom-king bullshit. Forget it.

218
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:11,344
Robyn wouldn't piss
on your gums if your
teeth were on fire.

219
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:13,852
Yes, she would.

220
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:17,359
Shush ! Hush, please !

221
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,867
Showin' your ignorance
again, Morgan.

222
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:24,880
Some of us pump
and some of us slump.

223
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:28,890
You should
try some pump, Morgan.
Might clear up your acne.

224
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,398
You're so --
am I ?

225
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:36,911
N-no, stop.

226
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:38,915
Stop it !

227
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,921
Why do you
make me do this ?

228
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,428
What are you writing ?
Hey, what did you write ?

229
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:47,939
Matt, not the
fire alarm !

230
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:49,945
Matt ! Matt !

231
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:54,956
God, help !
Oh God !

232
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,466
Hey, come here.
Oh, ta-ha-ha.

233
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,919
Hmm.

234
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,035

Dave, it just wasn't
meant to happen.

I can't believe it.
He's alive !

250
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,854
He was practically
an ice cube...
Practically.

251
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:47,360
I say
we just walk.
No, no way !

252
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,872
Oh, please.
He is ours.
We found him.

253
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,882
What ?
Be hospitable ?

254
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:05,406
- Ooh !
- Ahh ! Ahh !

255
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:10,419
How ya doin' ?
Hi, my name is Dave.

256
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:15,433
Come here, come here.
Introduce yourself.

257
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:19,943
This is stoney.
Stoney, he's my friend.

258
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:21,949
Uh, this is my room.

259
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:25,959
It's okay.
It's okay.

260
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:30,973
Uh, we're
from Encino.

261
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:33,478
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

262
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:35,484
And we hope you don't
gnaw on our beaks.
Shh.

263
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:38,992
I know what
I'm doing, stone.

264
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,512
We go to high school.
High school ?

265
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,517
He doesn't know
what high school is.

266
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:50,521
He doesn't know
what anything is.

267
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:53,029
Just be
calm and easy.

268
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:58,543
Calm...
And easy.
Hey, hi.

269
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:12,078
- Get the phone.
- Okay. Okay.

270
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:29,623
It's okay.
It's okay.

271
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,627
See, I think
he's calming down.

272
00:26:31,627 --> 00:26:35,137
Calming... down.

273
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:46,665
Ugh ?

274
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:52,181
Fire.
Flameage.

275
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:55,187
Buddy's into it.
That was kill,
stone.

276
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:59,199
Look at his eyes.
He likes the blue part.

277
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:02,707
He's glossy-eyed.
Look, freak
him out. Ow !

278
00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:04,211
Ow ! Ooh !

279
00:27:06,217 --> 00:27:09,225
- Ugh !
- Okay. Ah, ah !

280
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:15,240
Give it to him.
No !

281
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,245
Ugh. Ugh.

282
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:21,255
- Here, here. Look, here.
-You gotta teach him.

283
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:23,761
Whoa ! Oh.

284
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,294
Hey !

285
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:39,301
No.
No.

286
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:41,306
What ?
Did you just --

287
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:44,814
- I think he just said "no."
- No !

288
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:47,823
- No ?
- No ! No !

289
00:27:47,823 --> 00:27:50,329
No. No.

290
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:53,085
Cool, buddy.
He is so greasy !

291
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:58,154
Greasy ? He's a
prehistoric pyromaniac.

292
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:01,162
- We gotta teach him stuff.
- We'll teach him how to wease.

293
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:04,673
No. No.

294
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:08,183
No !
No ! No !

295
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:11,693
Oh God. We gotta teach him
how to be normal.

296
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:14,702
No, uh-uh. We're goin' psycho
with him, bro.

297
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:16,708
That's boring, dude,
normal !

298
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:19,214
Stoney, come on, man.
Hang with me.

299
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:21,221
We gotta play
this thing out.

300
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:25,232
If we tell anyone,
if anyone sees him, they'll
take him away from us.

301
00:28:25,734 --> 00:28:27,238
They'll cut him up
into little pieces.

302
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,747
They'll take all the credit,
and we'll still be geeks.

303
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:35,262
I'm not a geek.
I'm a unique weasel, David.

304
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:38,270
I'm just underrated 'cause
I live here in Encino.

305
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,780
Bud ?
Buddy ?

306
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,288
O-o-o-ow !
Okay ?

307
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:46,795

right here.
Don't freak him out.

321
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,047
Let's show him
himself.
Okay.

322
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:16,555
You wanna see your mug, bud ?
Check it.

323
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:18,261
Ugh !

324
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:21,068
What, dude ? You should be with
your mug, bro.

325
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:24,579
You look buff.
Right ?

326
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:30,094
Hey, can you
say "ba...Uff" ?

327
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:35,610
Ba...Uff ?

328
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,622
I like that.
You know,
you pause too.

329
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:44,135
We gotta give him
a cool name.

330
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:46,141
Axl.
Yeah, buddy.

331
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:49,149
Not axl.
This is serious.
Okay.

332
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,657
We've got the missing link
standing in my bedroom.

333
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:58,677
Link ! Link !
We'll call him link !

334
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:02,188
Okay, cool.
Maybe we could call him
stoney number two...

335
00:31:02,188 --> 00:31:04,193
Because he's got
my same 'do...

336
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:07,201
And he's from
the stone age.

337
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,712
I like link better.
Okay, we'll
call him link.

338
00:31:10,712 --> 00:31:12,717
But can I
call him linkage ?
Cool !

339
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:16,729
Cool !
Let's see how
smart he is.

340
00:31:19,236 --> 00:31:20,741
No, no.
Come here.

341
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:24,752
Okay. Okay.
You okay ?
Uh.

342
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:27,259
Uh, uh, look.

343
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:33,277
See ?
Ugh.
Ahh ?

344
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:36,285
Whoa !
Ahh !
Whoa !
Ahh !

345
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:38,292
Ahh, oow, ooo.

346
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:40,800
Ooow !

347
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,305
Okay, okay.

348
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:46,314
Um, link.

349
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:50,327
Link.
No !

350
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:53,335
You're link.
I'm Dave. Dave !

351
00:31:53,335 --> 00:31:55,340
Dave. Dave.

352
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,852
No, Dave, Dave.
Dave, Dave, Dave.

353
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:01,358
Dave.
Yes !

354
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:04,366
Okay,
and that's --

355
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:07,374
that's stoney.
Mm-hmm.

356
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:10,384
Sto...Ney.

357
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:13,392
No, no.
Stoney.
Stoney.

358
00:32:13,894 --> 00:32:16,401
Yes !
Ahh !

359
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:21,417
Okay, okay.
And now you are ?

360
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:23,924
Dave !
Ahh !

361
00:32:23,924 --> 00:32:27,435
No, no, I'm Dave.
You are ?

362
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,456
Buff.

363
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:39,469
No.

364
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:42,979
It's all right.
You've had a hard day.

365
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:45,486
- Your parents !
- My parents !

366
00:32:47,492 --> 00:32:51,003
Okay, uh, uh,
take him out back and ring
the doorbell three times.

367
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,508
But, Dave --
no "buts,"
just do it !

368
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:58,524
Follow the weasel,
linkage, come on.
Quick, quick, quick.

369
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:06,046
My kitchen !

370
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:10,559
Busted !

371
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,069
What are you doing ?

372
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:17,579
What are you doing ?
I'm cooking dinner.

373
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,584
You're what ?
Busted !

374
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:22,593
I'm cooking dinner.
I thought it might be
a nice surprise.

375
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:24,599
They're surprised,
all right.

376
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:29,112
What is
going on here ?

377
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:31,118
Where's the flour ?
I can't find the flour.

378
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:35,631
Hello, Stanley.
Who is this strange boy and
why is he ringing my doorbell ?

379
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:40,646
It got stuck, sir.
Come in.
Meet your new family.

380
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:43,655
Whose family ?

381
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,664
Boris, get down !
Boris !

382
00:33:46,664 --> 00:33:50,675
- Boris, get out !
- Get down !

383
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:54,185
-- Get out, get out !

384
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:57,695
Hey, dad.

385
00:33:57,695 --> 00:33:59,701
David,
who is that ?
Huh ?

386
00:34:00,202 --> 00:34:01,707
That ?
Who's that ?

387
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:06,220
- That was Linkavitch Chomofsky.
- What ?

388
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,231
Link... Linkav--
doesn't anybody in this house
listen to anything I say ?

389
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:12,739
What is he
talking about ?

390
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,745
Dad, Linkavitch
Chomofsky.

391
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:17,753
Our exchange student ?
He's here.

392
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:20,261
He's gonna help us
dig the pool.

393
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:22,869
Yeah !

394
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:25,576
Why does none of this
sound familiar to me ?

395
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:28,084
I told you about this
months ago, remember ?

396
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:32,599
About school giving us
extra credit for college
for housing exchange students,

397
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,108
and learning about
their culture and
you said it was okay.

398
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:38,616
Now you're gonna
take it back ?

399
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:40,621
No, no, no, I'm not
gonna take it back.

400
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,128
This is important to me.
This is my life.

401
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:46,638
It's embarrassing.
He travelled here
all the way from --

402
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:50,652
- I don't know, Estonia ?
- Yeah, Estonia !

403
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:53,157
Mom, come on.
You're not buying this ?

404
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,164
Well, I --
dad ?

405
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:59,175
Actually, I, I,
I think now...

406
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:02,687
That I, I, I do
recall something.

407
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:05,295
- See ?
- See, it's about focusing.

408
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:10,310
You're bogus.
Larry, how could I forget
something like this ?

409
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,821
He's an exchange student.
He's going to be staying
in our house.

410
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,828
You forgot me
in the third grade.

411
00:35:15,828 --> 00:35:18,073
I spent the entire night after
the play in the parking lot.

412
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:20,342
In the sixth grade,
the soccer ?

413
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:24,355
Okay, where's
he gonna stay ?

414
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,864
And why is he
attacking the dog ?

415
00:35:26,864 --> 00:35:31,376
He's gonna stay in my room.
He's not attacking the dog.
He's bonding.

416
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:33,382
- As if !
- Shut up !

417
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:35,891
- You shut up.
- No, everybody shut up.

418
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:39,402
Larry, it's okay.
I'm tired.
I'm a little hungry.

419
00:35:39,402 --> 00:35:42,410
It's time we decide
what we're gonna make
for dinner.

420
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:45,420
I assume you'll
be joining us ?
You assume correctly, Mr. M.

421
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,933
We practically feed the
entire neighborhood. Why not
part of Estonia as well, huh ?

422
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:51,940
I always eat here
and I like your food.

423
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,451
Great.

424
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:57,959
Stop it ! No.

425
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:02,472
No, no, no.

426
00:36:02,472 --> 00:36:07,488
I can't believe you told
my parents he's from Estonia.

427
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:10,998
Cow pajamas ?
Those are kind of flaming.

428
00:36:10,998 --> 00:36:14,008
Ooh !

429
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,521
Some Betty, huh ?
Betty.

430
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,039
Gonzangas.

431
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,552
Gonzangas ?
Buddy, cones.

432
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:33,568
I know you've had
a big day, pal.
But tomorrow...

433
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:36,076
I'm gonna take you
someplace really special.

434
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:40,087
Taco Bell.
Better.
Get the camera.

435
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:45,105
Congratulations, link.
You're gonna be a senior.

436
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:47,611
Smile.

437
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:51,624
♪ Wild thing ♪

438
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:56,640
♪ You make
my heart sing ♪

439
00:36:59,147 --> 00:37:02,659
♪ You make
everything groovy ♪

440
00:37:04,662 --> 00:37:07,171
♪ Wild thing ♪

441
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,089
Oh God,
he doesn't like that.

442
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,197
That's glass.
That hurts your beak.

443
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,200
Stand up straight.

444
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:18,211
Poor stone-ager.

445
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:20,219
He spent a million years
chillin' in a block of ice,

446
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:23,229
now he's gotta go
to high school ! Agh !

447
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,235
Who's that guy with
the dork squad ?

448
00:37:25,235 --> 00:37:28,748
- Oh my God, he is totally rude.
- Totally.

449
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:33,262
We have got a
major find here.

450
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:35,269
This guy's our ticket
to fame and popularity.

451
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:39,282
All we gotta do is get him
enrolled in school and he'll
help us become popular.

452
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:43,298
That's harsh.
We'll make him famous.

453
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:46,309
We'll teach him some
stupid pet tricks and
get him on letterman.

454
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,815
You're weasin' off
his gig.

455
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:51,323
Oh please !
He's a caveman,
for God sakes.

456
00:37:51,824 --> 00:37:54,835
Look at him.
He's practically
a monkey.

457
00:37:56,843 --> 00:37:59,853
We found him.
We can do whatever
we want with him.

458
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:02,364
We, we, we? No, no, no.
You, you, you.

459
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,871
I just wanna be
his friend.

460
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:06,876
Fine.

461
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:09,886
Hello, Mrs. Mackey.

462
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:14,403
And what do we
have here ?

463
00:38:16,912 --> 00:38:18,918
Now I'm covered
up to fourth period.

464
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:22,931
I don't know what to do
with him after that.
I can take him to Spanish.

465
00:38:22,931 --> 00:38:24,939
Will you be careful ?
I'll be cool, man.
I promise.

466
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:27,447
Okay.

467
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:29,454
What's he doin' ?

468
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:32,466
I don't know.

469
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:34,973
Link, be careful !

470
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:44,506
Uh, hey, hey --

471
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:47,516
hey, link,
how's your melon, bud ?

472
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:58,051
Whoa !

473
00:38:58,554 --> 00:39:01,061
Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey !

474
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:04,072
Whoa.

475
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:06,581
Link ?

476
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:10,594
Is this dude
totally fundamental
or what ?

477
00:39:10,594 --> 00:39:13,104
Did you miss me ?
Always.

478
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:15,611
Who is this ?
This is
my friend, link.

479
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:19,122
Link.
He's staying with us.
He's from Estonia.

480
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:22,637
You're kidding ?
This guy is staying with you ?

481
00:39:22,637 --> 00:39:24,643
Uh-huh.

482
00:39:26,148 --> 00:39:28,657
He's thinkin' of
becoming a hairdresser.

483
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,668
Designing crusty mops
for the rich and famous.

484
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:33,171
Oh.

485
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:36,183
Ugh. Gonzangas.

486
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:38,691
No !
Bye, Robyn.
Hey, hey, hey.

487
00:39:39,192 --> 00:39:41,701
I think he was saying
he likes your cones.

488
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:45,211
I'm thrilled.
Get out of my face !

489
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:47,219
Robyn,
that import is mine.

490
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,729
This is just
in time for prom.
Yeah ?

491
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,740
Is he fine
or what ?
I'm not sure.

492
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:09,295
He's a looker !
Link. Link !

493
00:40:09,295 --> 00:40:11,804
Link, please,
come sit down.

494
00:40:11,804 --> 00:40:15,314
Who is this dipshit,
anyway ?

495
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:17,323
His name's link.

496
00:40:17,323 --> 00:40:20,333
He's from Estonia and
I think he's jive.

497
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:23,846
Jive, yeah.
You do ?

498
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:26,856
Hell yeah,
and I'm not the only one.

499
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:29,363
Hey, link !

500
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:37,390
I'll see you
next period.

501
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,898
Watch him.
All right, David.

502
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:43,914
We got Spanish now.
Spanish is like guacamole,
chips and salsa.

503
00:40:43,914 --> 00:40:47,928
LA d?A es mi
en hermanos.

504
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:50,435
The day is beautiful.

505
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:54,447
The sun isn't shining
all through the night.

506
00:41:05,988 --> 00:41:09,499
Link, come on.
Sorry, you guys.

507
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,511
Whoa !

508
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:17,890
Vale, repitan en espanol.

509
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:21,040
The cheese is
old and moldy.

510
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,055
El queso est?
Viejo y podrido.

511
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:27,063
Where is the bathroom ?

512
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:31,077
¿¿ D?Nde est?
El sanitario ?

513
00:41:31,077 --> 00:41:34,591
¿¿ D?Nde est?
El sanitario ?

514
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:38,103
Good, once again.
You're cute.

515
00:41:38,103 --> 00:41:40,611
You're cute.

516
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:43,623
Meet me
at blades tonight.

517
00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:46,634
Blades tonight.

518
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:53,659
Yes, what ?
You can drop him off in front
of blades tonight, right ?

519
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:56,669
Can David and I
go too, please ?

520
00:41:56,669 --> 00:41:59,178
You smell.

521
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:02,692
Hey, seniorita.
That hurt my lobes.

522
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:05,702
I didn't do it. They
started the whole thing.

523
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:14,232
Kashmir ?
Rajneesh, is it ?

524
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,742
- How many minutes for the burrito ?
- Two minutes.

525
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,254
One minute.
Two minutes !

526
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,768
Ah, make up
your melons !

527
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:26,777
- Is it one or two ?
- One and a half minutes.

528
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,786
Okay.

529
00:42:28,786 --> 00:42:32,375
Okay, my friend.
Try and experience...

530
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,108
What I'm about to chirp
in your lobes, cool ?
Hey.

531
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,617
We're going
to discuss grindage;

532
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:42,636
how to fill the furnace,
pack the cheeks and
stuff the gills. Okay ?

533
00:42:42,636 --> 00:42:45,646
You're used to
eating twigs, right ?

534
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,159
But here in the U.S. of a-age
we got something called...

535
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,672
The four basic food groups,
and this is not one of 'em.

536
00:42:52,672 --> 00:42:54,179
Oh.

537
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:56,087
Look at what
we have here.

538
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,598
Dairy group.
Dairy group.

539
00:42:58,598 --> 00:43:02,613
Milk duds. Hide these
under your pillow so
your mom doesn't find them.

540
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,619
If she does,
you're tweaked, buddy.

541
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,629
Keep on cruisin'.

542
00:43:06,629 --> 00:43:09,138
Fruit group.
Sweet tarts.

543
00:43:09,138 --> 00:43:13,155
These are killer.
So citrusy, dude,
you'll freak.

544
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:15,162
Keep on cruisin'.
Uh-huh.

545
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:20,006
Right, this is
the vegetable group.

546
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:22,989
Corn nuts ! Put 'em
on a pedestal, bro.

547
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:25,438
- Look at that !
- Those are kill, huh ?

548
00:43:25,473 --> 00:43:29,549
Meat group !
Come on, the meat group.

549
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:31,952
These are my favorite !

550
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:39,749
Hey, you gotta be equal,
equal, fifty/fifty.

551
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,926
Here. Mmm.
Mmm.

552
00:43:44,274 --> 00:43:47,579
Ooh ! Figures.

553
00:43:47,614 --> 00:43:51,319
- Hot on the outside, icicle in the middle.
- Two minutes.

554
00:43:51,354 --> 00:43:53,878
You like that, right,
'cause you're a caveman.

555
00:43:54,315 --> 00:43:55,862
Cool, buddy.

556
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:58,831
The beverage !
Icee, bro.

557
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:01,842
This is what put
this place on the map.

558
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:04,855
What are you doing,
Mr. stoney ? No, no !

559
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:08,367
- You can't do this here.
- You must leave now, please.

560
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:12,685
-Look, kashmir, rajneesh, chill.
-No buds chill !

561
00:44:12,685 --> 00:44:17,702
Link and I are
cruisin' the Mountain and
we figured we'd wease ju-uice.

562
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:21,215
- No weasin' the ju-uice.
- Wease the juice !

563
00:44:21,215 --> 00:44:24,227
No ! No weasin'
the juice.

564
00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:25,734
No weasin' the juice.

00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:31,255
Hey, just chill,

No buds chill.

566
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:35,268
It's okay.
Just chill.

567
00:44:38,782 --> 00:44:42,296
I'll be back.
No buds chill !

568
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,341
Oh God, no !
Wait ! Stop !

569
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,519
Here we go !

570
00:46:04,605 --> 00:46:06,615
Comin' home !

571
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:10,126
Was that the hottest
or what, bro ?
Are you into it ?

572
00:46:19,162 --> 00:46:22,172
♪ Joy to the fishes
in the deep, blue sea ♪

573
00:46:22,172 --> 00:46:25,185
- ♪ Joy to you and me ♪
- Stop !

574
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:28,194
Where did you go ?
You just took off.

575
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:30,202
Do you know
how worried I've been ?

576
00:46:30,202 --> 00:46:33,717
You sound like
my mom.
You can't
do that to me.

577
00:46:33,717 --> 00:46:36,226
What's on his nose ?

578
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,233
Just chill, Dave,
'cause you know why ?

579
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:40,742
Link and I had a
stoney time at the Mountain.

580
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:43,753
You took him to
mega Mountain ?
Are you crazy ?

581
00:46:43,753 --> 00:46:45,761
Yeah, 'cause they're
riding the vapor in reverse.

582
00:46:46,263 --> 00:46:48,270
They are ?
Oh, cool.
Uh-huh.

583
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,281
Check out the fresh nugs.
Weasin' the juice.

584
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:53,291
O-o-o-ow.

O-o-o-ow.
O-o-o-ow.

589
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:08,346
Gee, Link, that
is so beautiful.
Is it old ?

590
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:14,871
You know, Mr. M.,
the way I look at it,
some day...

591
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:17,381
Your daughter and I
could be married...

592
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:21,897
And we could
be related.
I count the days.

593
00:47:28,924 --> 00:47:33,441
So, Stanley,
how's your mother ?

594
00:47:33,441 --> 00:47:36,452
She's really bummed.
Can you pass the peas ?

595
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:39,463
Sure.
Thanks.

596
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:44,984
Mr. Morgan, if you're edged
'cause I'm weasin' on your
grindage, just chill.

597
00:47:44,984 --> 00:47:47,996
'Cause if I had
the whole Brady-bunch
thing happenin' at my pad,

598
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:50,003
I'd go grind over there.

599
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:52,511
So don't tax my gig so
hard core, cruster.

600
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:56,027
- Stanley, speak English.
- Dad !

601
00:47:56,027 --> 00:47:59,541
Link, how was your day ?
How are you adjusting ?

602
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:02,177
He's doin' just great.
We got him enrolled
in all his classes.

603
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:04,662
- Didn't we, pal ?
- Ugh.
- Yeah.

604
00:48:05,061 --> 00:48:08,074
A success.

605
00:48:08,074 --> 00:48:10,585
What's up ?

606
00:48:13,094 --> 00:48:17,111
How was your day, mom ?
Where you goin' ?

607
00:48:17,613 --> 00:48:20,624

We're cool.

David, I even showered.
Check out my --

I am so glad
to see you.
Ugh.

622
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:43,955
Oh, hon, lose the geek squad.
They're bad for your deal.
Ugh ?

623
00:49:43,955 --> 00:49:45,962
Blades !

624
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:48,475

Good.
Good.

630
00:49:58,011 --> 00:50:00,017
That was not cool
at all, you guys.

631
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:02,530
You could hurt his
pancreas or something.

632
00:50:10,561 --> 00:50:14,578
I like the ketchup
and mustard.
Very avant-garde.

Robyn, don't forget,

637
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,345
we've been
naked together.

638
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:36,868
- Nice body.
- Remember when we were together ?

639
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:39,379
- Did you show this to anyone ?
- No.

640
00:50:39,379 --> 00:50:41,889
- That's your copy.
Show anyone you want.
- Thanks, Dave.

641
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:47,914
Oh, I get it.
This is like your
old girlfriend in Estonia ?

642
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:50,927
Do you miss her ?
Ugh.

643
00:50:50,927 --> 00:50:53,437
Because I can tell you
from experience,

644
00:50:53,437 --> 00:50:57,452
- long-distance relationships
never work out.
- Ugh.

645
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,015
Estonia's a
long ways away, link.
Yeah.

646
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:15,025
And I'm right here...

647
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:18,037
- So let's work on changing your mind.

649
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:24,063
Whoa !

650
00:51:24,564 --> 00:51:26,573
Or not.

651
00:51:26,573 --> 00:51:30,086
You just think I'm bad
for your act, that's all.

652
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,298
Right, and you think
I'm good for yours.

653
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:35,111
- What ?
- Matt !

654
00:51:35,611 --> 00:51:39,128
What are you doin' ?
You're not allowed in here.

655

Are you deaf, dork ?

658
00:51:51,678 --> 00:51:53,691
Didn't I forbid you
to speak to her ?
I'm sorry.

659
00:51:57,207 --> 00:51:59,216
That's all, link.
It's over.

660
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,727
End of story.

661
00:52:08,254 --> 00:52:11,270
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Huh ?

00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,778
Wease some juice !

Hey, you want
a piece of me ?

00:52:22,314 --> 00:52:26,334
Oh God !

665
00:52:27,338 --> 00:52:29,346
I don't know you.

666
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,856
I don't like you.

667
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:35,872
As of now,
I'm all over you.

668
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:53,450
Did you see that ?
The new kid,
he took it.

00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,457
Whoa !
Whoa !

670
00:52:55,457 --> 00:52:59,979
Don't just stand there.
Do something.
Stand up for yourself.

671
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:01,986
Hit him back !

672
00:53:01,986 --> 00:53:03,994
Link, hit him back !
Where you goin' ?

673
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:07,009
What do you think of your
Bulgarian dork bud, now ?

674
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:09,020
Hmm ?

675
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,537
That was harsh,
Matt.

676
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,549
Let's get
out of here.

677
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:20,065
The stench of losers is
doing damage to my sinuses.

678
00:53:20,065 --> 00:53:23,581
Just stop it, Matt.
Don't even come near me.

679
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,588
Hey, watch it.

680
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:30,109
Why don't you take this,
'cause I don't think
I need it anymore.

681
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:31,615
Hey !

682
00:53:32,117 --> 00:53:35,292
I can't believe
he got nailed.
He's a pacifist.

683
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:39,152
A pacifist caveman !
You're mental.

684
00:53:39,152 --> 00:53:41,158
Cavemens aren't like us,
Dave.

685
00:53:41,158 --> 00:53:44,676
They fought for food and
survival. They did not
fight for popularity.

686
00:53:45,178 --> 00:53:48,193
What would he be
fighting for, huh ?
For face.

687
00:53:48,193 --> 00:53:51,710
For us !
To be cool !
Cool, huh ?

688
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,715
He does not know
what cool is.

689
00:53:54,219 --> 00:53:57,234
He doesn't know where he is.
He knows nothin'.

690
00:53:58,237 --> 00:54:01,252
He's gotta learn
how to defend himself.

691
00:54:01,252 --> 00:54:05,771
Against what ?
Against butt holes
like Matt.

692
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:17,827
Come on.
Come on.

See you in
Mr. Albert's class.

715
00:56:19,761 --> 00:56:22,066
Slicey.
Slicey.
Slicey.

716
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:25,066
Hello, little one.

717
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:29,070
We took a vote and the computer club
feels your presence...

718
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,072
Will be a valuable asset
to our organization.

719
00:56:31,072 --> 00:56:34,480
Computer club.
Computer club.
Computer club.

720
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:36,679
Homeboy.

721
00:56:41,184 --> 00:56:43,188
Why doesn't that happen
when Matt hits me ?

722
00:56:43,188 --> 00:56:46,690
Give yourself a
few million years, David.

723
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:01,208
Link. Link.
Link, get down.

724
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,214
All right,
come on.

725
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:06,216
No, no.
I was just playin'.

726
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:08,219
All right,
cro-magnon man.

727
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:11,223
What you're looking at here
is a representation...

728
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:14,228
Of what cro-magnon man's
everyday life
may have been like.

729
00:57:14,728 --> 00:57:18,733
If he was here today, you could
sit next to him, you would
never know the difference.

730
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:23,239
Stoney, let's move on.
We're gonna look at
the giant sloth.

731
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:37,834
Class, this is
saber-toothed cat.

732
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:40,834
Even though he's
been extinct for
over 10,000 years,

733
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:43,339
while he was alive
you can imagine that
many a caveman...

734
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,345
Was a tasty meal
to one of these.

735
00:58:48,345 --> 00:58:50,348
There's one now.
Uh-oh.

736
00:58:50,348 --> 00:58:54,354
Let's look at
the mammoth display,
our school mascot.

737
00:58:56,357 --> 00:58:59,361
Look out !
Whoa.

738
00:59:18,884 --> 00:59:21,388
Link ! Link,
get out from there !

739
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:23,392
Look at him.
He's flipping out.

740
00:59:23,392 --> 00:59:25,393
He knows, Dave.
What ?

741
00:59:25,893 --> 00:59:28,896
He knows.

742
00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:31,899
He knows what
happened to him.

743
00:59:31,899 --> 00:59:36,406
We have
to help him.

744
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,913
Link.

745
00:59:40,412 --> 00:59:42,414
Link. Link.

746
00:59:42,414 --> 00:59:44,918
Ow !

747
00:59:45,918 --> 00:59:47,923
Link.

748
00:59:47,923 --> 00:59:51,929
Hey. Hey,
come on, man.
Stop it.

749
00:59:51,929 --> 00:59:53,929
Look, I understand.

750
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:57,434
Family.

751
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:00,937
Family.

752
01:00:03,943 --> 01:00:05,946
Family.
You okay ?

753
01:00:05,946 --> 01:00:08,448
It's okay.
We're your new family.

754
01:00:08,448 --> 01:00:10,948
We're your
new family.

755
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,953
It's okay.

756
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,465
It's all right.

757
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:27,972
He's burnt
from all this.

758
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:31,477
Seeing as we started
the school year
as total losers,

759
01:00:31,977 --> 01:00:33,979
and now everyone
knows who we are,

760
01:00:33,979 --> 01:00:36,486
I don't think one mistake
is such a big deal.

761
01:00:36,486 --> 01:00:39,988
But you're doggin' him.
Just promise me,

762
01:00:39,988 --> 01:00:42,990
just a little more mellow,
not so much ?

763
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:46,496
Stoney !
Dave !

764
01:00:46,496 --> 01:00:48,498
All right.

765
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:52,004
If it'll make you
feel better, I'll be
more mellow with him.

766
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:54,507
Robyn sweeney ?
Here.

767
01:00:54,507 --> 01:00:59,515
Again ?
I'm sorry. I can't get
that parallel parking thing.

768
01:00:59,515 --> 01:01:03,518
Whoa. Parallel parking
is not a thing, understand ?

769
01:01:03,518 --> 01:01:07,523
It's not a feeling,
not a state of mind,
or one of your disco dances.

770
01:01:08,024 --> 01:01:11,026
Yeah.
Get in the car and
don't take it personally.

771
01:01:11,026 --> 01:01:13,028
Okay, Mr. beady.

772
01:01:13,028 --> 01:01:15,534
- Linkavitch Chomofsky ?
- Ugh, ugh.

773
01:01:15,534 --> 01:01:18,036
What are you
lookin' at ?

774
01:01:18,036 --> 01:01:19,538
Ugh.

775
01:01:19,538 --> 01:01:23,043
Get inside the car...

776
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:26,048
And shoot
your barber.

777
01:01:26,048 --> 01:01:31,055
Contrast this
with Hemingway's
"the sun also rises,"

778
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:33,055
where the blood sport
of bullfighting...

779
01:01:33,554 --> 01:01:36,559
Is used and
perhaps what --
uh-oh.

780
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:41,566
Oh God.
Rad mobile !
Rad mobile !

781
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:45,070
Boys, will you sit down ?
Class ?

782
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:48,575
You promised me mellow.
This isn't mellow.

783
01:01:49,577 --> 01:01:52,579
Link ! Link !

784
01:01:54,082 --> 01:01:56,085
Dave.

785
01:01:56,586 --> 01:01:58,590
Watch the people !
Grab the wheel !

786
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,088
Okay !

787
01:02:04,094 --> 01:02:07,099
Stone, tell him to stop !
Okay, stop.

788
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:10,099
Didn't phase him, bro.
Oh shit !

789
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:13,105
All right, link.
Joke's over. Stop !

790
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:16,610
- He-e-e-ey !
- Stop that car, young man !

791
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:20,115
I'm your teacher.
Both hands on the wheel !

792
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:26,122
Who was that ?

793
01:02:26,122 --> 01:02:28,624
Crosswalk !
Crosswalk !

794
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:34,634
Close call, buddy.

795
01:02:34,634 --> 01:02:37,135
Hey, buddy !

796
01:02:37,135 --> 01:02:40,138
Hi, Robyn.
Hi, Dave.

797
01:02:41,642 --> 01:02:44,148
Red light !
Red light !

798
01:02:51,657 --> 01:02:53,659
Boom !
Up on two wheels !

799
01:02:53,659 --> 01:02:56,662
I've never seen
anything like this.
I don't teach that.

800
01:02:56,662 --> 01:03:02,168
I got the license plate.
It's e684-257.

801
01:03:02,168 --> 01:03:05,170
You don't have to write
that I left the keys
in the ignition, do you ?

802
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:07,674
Ow-o-o-o-o !

803
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:10,678
I think he's got
the hang of it.

804
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:21,193
That concludes our
parallel parking for today.
Class dismissed.

805
01:03:21,193 --> 01:03:25,198
Link, I think you
just failed driver's Ed.

806
01:03:25,198 --> 01:03:27,200
Hey, link,
wait up.

807
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,201

808
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:31,706

Is it okay if I just
chill upon here ?
Orale.

815
01:03:47,727 --> 01:03:50,733
You wanna be a man,
ese ?

816
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:53,733
Eventually, yeah.
But I'm almost there.

817
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:56,238
Look at my patch, bro.
Ohh !
Ooh !

818

Mucho macho.
Ooh.

Oh, this is Tequila ?

820
01:04:03,245 --> 01:04:05,751
Wait,
where's the worm ?

821
01:04:05,751 --> 01:04:07,753
The worm's right there,
ese.

822
01:04:07,753 --> 01:04:10,256
Ut-uh.
I'm a weasel.

823

You wanna be

824
01:04:16,261 --> 01:04:18,766
- You wanna be a man ?
- Then drink like an hombre.

825
01:04:18,766 --> 01:04:21,269
No, I can't.
You're showing us
disrespect.

826
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,269
Ah, you guys --

827
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:26,276
that's disrespectful,
weasel.

828
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:28,276
Be a man, ese.
Drink it up.

829
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:30,781
Drink like a man.

830
01:04:30,781 --> 01:04:33,282
You can do it,
weasel.
Bottoms up.

831
01:04:33,282 --> 01:04:35,791
You can do it.
Andale.

01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:42,293
Wait.

Okay, okay,

Five more, man.

01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:56,313
Weasel, weasel.
Weasel, weasel.

Where's link ?
Dancin'.

841
01:05:27,353 --> 01:05:29,856
Cool,
let's go dance.
No, no.

842
01:05:29,856 --> 01:05:33,860
I'm not good.
Let's not dance.
You are too uptight.

843
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,365
I, I just don't
like to dance.

844
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,868
Hey, weasel.
What's happening ?
Hey.

01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:41,371

Oh man, yeah.
You see her ?

01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:49,381
Don't be lookin'
at her, man !
I'm sorry.

849
01:05:49,381 --> 01:05:51,382
You see her ?
No.

850
01:05:51,382 --> 01:05:54,389
If I see any man
looking at my muchacha,
that man will no longer...

851
01:05:54,389 --> 01:05:57,890
Be recognizable
as a man.

852
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:00,897
I want you Vatos
to have a good time.
Yeah.

Come on.
We're gonna get busted !

895
01:09:21,152 --> 01:09:23,655
You are busted.
Get down, man.

896
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:35,671
Stoney is the crustiest vato...

897
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,673
I've ever witnessed.

898
01:09:38,673 --> 01:09:43,180
So don't hush his gig,
buddy.

899
01:09:43,678 --> 01:09:45,182
Ow-o-o-o !

900
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,194
Eh, buddy !

901
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:58,197
Bye, guys.
Drive safely.

902
01:09:58,698 --> 01:10:01,203
Nice element
you're hanging out with.

903
01:10:01,203 --> 01:10:04,705
Who are your friends
in the low-rider ?
None of your business.

904
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:08,210
Go home.
Huh.

905
01:10:14,218 --> 01:10:17,223
What time do you want me
to pick you up tomorrow night ?

906
01:10:17,223 --> 01:10:20,726
It's the prom,
remember ?

907
01:10:20,726 --> 01:10:23,231
You are just like
everyone else.

908
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:26,232
All you care about
is what people think.

909
01:10:26,232 --> 01:10:29,237
It's really pathetic.

910
01:10:29,237 --> 01:10:32,242
Hey, watch it.

911
01:10:32,242 --> 01:10:36,747
Matt, I'm not going
to the prom with you.

912
01:10:37,747 --> 01:10:41,753
I wanna go with somebody
who's really cool,

913
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:45,261
who's not afraid of
being himself or having fun.

914
01:10:49,263 --> 01:10:51,267
Good night.

915
01:10:53,769 --> 01:10:56,271
Who's cooler than me ?

916
01:10:57,772 --> 01:11:01,778
Your phone call.
You got one.
Make it quick.

917
01:11:05,281 --> 01:11:07,288
Thanks.

918
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:13,794
Matthew Wilson !

919
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:16,297
Hello.

920
01:11:16,297 --> 01:11:18,300
Robyn ?
Robyn.

921
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,303
Dave, did you guys
get away okay ?

922
01:11:20,803 --> 01:11:22,806
We're in prison.

923
01:11:22,806 --> 01:11:26,810
Look, this is
my one phone call.

924
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:29,815
I'm using it to ask you
to go to the prom with me.

925
01:11:30,314 --> 01:11:31,816
Just say yes,
okay ?

926
01:11:32,316 --> 01:11:34,321
No.

927
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:39,327
Why not ?
I wanna go
with link.

928
01:11:39,327 --> 01:11:42,330
What ?
Will you ask link
if he'll go with me ?

929
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:44,333
You want me to what ?

930
01:11:44,832 --> 01:11:48,338
Look, I'm sorry.
I'll tell you what.

931
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:50,843
We'll all go.
We'll have a great time.

932
01:11:50,843 --> 01:11:53,845
How about that ?

933
01:11:53,845 --> 01:11:55,848
Dave ?

934
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:44,910
Hey !

935
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:47,416
¿¿ C?Mo est? Usted ?
Muy bonita...

936
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:49,414
Es LA d?A.

937
01:12:49,414 --> 01:12:52,418
Hey, wait.
How was jail ?

938
01:12:52,418 --> 01:12:54,423
Did you meet anyone ?

939
01:12:54,423 --> 01:12:58,427
Hey, wait !
Wait up.

940
01:13:22,459 --> 01:13:26,465
Things just didn't
turn out right.
Ugh.

941
01:13:26,465 --> 01:13:30,470
I mean, I don't
want 'em cuttin' you up
into little pieces.

942
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:33,471
This is just what's
best for you.

943
01:13:33,471 --> 01:13:35,476
It's best for me too,
all right ?

944
01:13:35,476 --> 01:13:37,477
Here.

945
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:43,485
For rad mobile.

946
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,488
For rad mobile.
Yeah.

947
01:13:45,987 --> 01:13:47,988
Put 'em
in your pocket.

948
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:54,499
Don't look at me
like that.

949
01:13:54,499 --> 01:13:58,004
This is just the way
it's gotta be.

950
01:13:58,004 --> 01:14:00,507
Go on,
get out of here.

951
01:14:00,507 --> 01:14:04,512
Go on.

952
01:14:04,512 --> 01:14:08,518
Go on, leave.

953
01:14:08,518 --> 01:14:11,019
Go.

954
01:14:15,025 --> 01:14:17,027
I'm sorry.

955
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:22,536
Hey, hey, hey !

956
01:14:22,536 --> 01:14:26,035
Talk to me, David.
Let me know what's
going on, man.

957
01:14:26,035 --> 01:14:29,544
What are you doin' ?
I'm letting him go.

958
01:14:29,544 --> 01:14:33,047
What ?
I can't handle him
anymore.

959
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:36,556
He'll be better off
with somebody else.
No, he's not !

960
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:38,555
Listen to me.
Call him back.

961
01:14:38,555 --> 01:14:41,560
I can't take it anymore.
I'm not kiddin'.
Call him back.

962
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,309
It's time.
I'm serious.

963
01:14:43,309 --> 01:14:45,566
Call him back.
That's harsh.

964
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:47,568
He's not
my responsibility.

965
01:14:47,568 --> 01:14:50,069
You're the one who weased
off his gig the whole time...

966
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:53,073
'Cause you thought maybe
he'd get you somewhere.

967
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:56,078
Now the guy gets a little crusty
and you're gonna bag him.

968
01:14:56,078 --> 01:15:01,084
It's not happenin', Dave.
That's not how it works
with friends, man.

969
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:04,587
You don't bag your friends
'cause they get in the way,
no matter what, dude.

970
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:08,593
Like you care ? The only thing
you've cared about is nugs,
chillin' and grindage.

971
01:15:08,593 --> 01:15:12,095
I happen to care
right now.
That's convenient.

972
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:15,102
You came along for
the ride and let me
do the dirty work...

973
01:15:15,603 --> 01:15:17,605
'Cause you thought it might
work to your advantage.

974
01:15:17,605 --> 01:15:21,108
Those are desperate words
of a loser.

975
01:15:21,108 --> 01:15:24,616
Maybe Matt Wilson was right
about you all along.
Take that back.

976
01:15:24,616 --> 01:15:26,614
No, you take it back.
Take it back !

977
01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:36,629
You're a loser.

978
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:41,636
- Family !
- All right.

979
01:15:44,638 --> 01:15:48,644
I'm sorry.
Family.

980
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:54,149
You can let go,
link.

981
01:15:56,654 --> 01:16:00,159
I'm sorry, man.
It's okay.

982
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,660
I don't know
what got into me.

983
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,665
I'm sorry.

984
01:16:04,665 --> 01:16:08,170
I didn't mean it,
stoney.

985
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:11,675
I'm sorry, bud.

986
01:16:14,677 --> 01:16:16,680
Ow !

987
01:16:26,192 --> 01:16:28,694
You look great.

988
01:16:28,694 --> 01:16:31,199
Have a good time.
You deserve it.

989
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:39,208
If you touch her ?
Ugh.

990
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:41,711
You think
they're ready ?
I don't know.

991
01:16:42,212 --> 01:16:43,714
Dave ?

992
01:16:44,215 --> 01:16:45,716
Dave, hey.

993
01:16:46,214 --> 01:16:48,221
Hey.

994
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:50,723
You're not ready.

995
01:16:50,723 --> 01:16:52,725
I, I can't go.

996
01:16:52,725 --> 01:16:57,230
Of course you can.
Just go upstairs,
put something on.

997
01:16:57,230 --> 01:17:00,737
No, really, I can't.
I'm on probation.

998
01:17:00,737 --> 01:17:02,738
I'm grounded.

999
01:17:04,741 --> 01:17:07,744
Hi, link.
You look great.
Hi.

1000
01:17:07,744 --> 01:17:10,748
You guys go.
Have a good time.
Go on.

1001
01:17:10,748 --> 01:17:13,250
No, no, no.
Come on.
Come on, Dave.

1002
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,255
Go.
Are you sure ?

1003
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:17,257
Go, have a good time.
Go, link.

1004
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:20,259
Get outta here.
Have a good time.

1005
01:17:20,259 --> 01:17:23,264
Drive safely.

1006
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:26,265
God, she smells good.

1007
01:17:29,273 --> 01:17:31,774
To Link.

1008
01:17:31,774 --> 01:17:34,778
May he have a cool time
at the prom.

1009
01:17:34,778 --> 01:17:37,279
Totally, bro,
to linkage.

1010
