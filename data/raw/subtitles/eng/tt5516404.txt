Hope.

00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:24,416
[chuckles]
What an ironic name

5
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:26,719
for a girl dying of cancer,
don't you think?

6
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:30,322
And what's more depressing
than a kid dying of cancer?

7
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:32,224
Nothing, of course.

8
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:34,661
So I have two options.

9
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:38,665
I can either be
depressed, emo teen, so obvs,

10
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,001
or I can embrace it.

11
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:44,270
It's my note from the doctor
for life.

12
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:45,973
No homework.
Teachers let you slide.

00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:48,307
Ice cream in the lunch line.

14
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,411
People are nice to you,

15
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:51,647
because they feel bad for you.

16
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:54,580
And why shouldn't they?

17
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:57,385
I-It's cancer,
and why shouldn't I use it?

18
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:00,888
I know how my story ends.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,859
Terminal is terminal.

20
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,660
You know, I...

21
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:08,297
There are no unwritten chapters
yet to come.

22
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,534
And I'm comfortable
knowing that.

23
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:14,002
So don't judge.

24
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:16,038
I'm not giving up.

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,574
I'm just practical.

26
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,812
[music continues]

27
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,719
You know what? Hands out.

28
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,590
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:08,325
All but one of them are ready.

30
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,527
I can have the other one
sent to her at the hospital

31
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,362
- later if you'd like.
- Oh, God, no.

32
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:14,065
Curbside service is enough.
Don't have to do that.

33
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,334
No, Mom, it's my Zofran,
and if I don't have it,

34
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,635
- I will be vomiting everywhere.
- Ehh. That's gross.

35
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:19,871
Uh, yeah, that would be great.

36
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,940
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,675
You know what?
You haven't eaten anything yet,

38
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,979
so put the phone down,
and then you can vlog later.

39
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,414
Eat this banana.

40
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,650
Banana!

41
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,718
What's that?

42
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,420
"Eat me, Hope. Eat me."

43
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,691
Okay. Give it to me.

44
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,565
[Hope] My mom
had the brilliant idea

45
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,600
of naming me Hope
after her favorite line

46
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,669
from some
dead British guy's book.

47
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,437
It's not her fault.

48
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,406
Who would have known
that this would have happened?

49
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,709
Hope!

50
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,780
[Hope laughs]
You shouldn't have.

51
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,949
- It's on me today.
- Oh, thanks.

52
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,884
I promise I won't be around
for much longer.

53
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,855
Wouldn't want
to put you out of business.

54
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,556
[Hope] But she's amazing,

55
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:11,991
if, at times, a bit much.

56
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,994
Okay, so I'm picking you up
after school today

57
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:15,395
for your doctor's appointment.

58
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:16,964
[sighs]
Is that today?

59
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,766
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, no.
- [groans]

60
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:21,001
Your test results came back.

61
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,972
Yay. More bad news.

62
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,075
All right.

63
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:30,778
You're strong and beautiful.

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,013
Chemo's nothing.
You got this. I love you.

65
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:35,616
Do we really
have to do this every time?

66
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,786
Okay, I'm strong,
and I'm beautiful,

67
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:40,557
and I've got this,
and I love you, too.

68
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:46,462
- Bye.
- Okay.

69
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,012
Hey, Dr. Pham.

70
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:05,981
[Hope] Kids are
supposed to be like Twinkies,

71
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,119
born with no sign
of an expiration date.

72
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,722
I'm more like milk.

73
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,492
There's one stamped right on me.

74
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:18,094
And, sure, you can try
and run away from it...

75
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:19,829
[theme music continues
on elevator speaker]

76
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:21,799
but you're
in for a rude awakening.

77
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:26,203
Uh, coming through.
Make way for the dying girl.

78
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:28,071
You know, don't want
to be late for chemo.

79
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:31,041
Gotta get my drip on,
so, yeah, might not...

80
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,978
might not make it, so...

81
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:35,648
Hit three, please.

82
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:38,682
Chocolate still
your favorite, Stephanie?

83
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:39,585
You know it.

84
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:44,588
[Hope] So I learned
to embrace my situation

85
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,257
with a sense of humor.

86
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,093
They say that laughter
is the best medicine.

87
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:51,763
Two white blood cells
bump into each other.

88
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:54,968
and one says to the other one,
"Funny seeing you here."

89
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:58,738
Drop mic.

90
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:02,942
[Hope]
It's been a real lifesaver.

[machinery beeping]

92
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:11,750
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

93
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:14,121
Sarah, it is time
to distract her.

94
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,290
[weakly]
Okay.

95
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,626
I just learned
about guided imagery.

96
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:23,963
Okay, let me see if I remember.

97
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:28,234
You are laying
on a nice warm beach.

98
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:30,703
Your feet are in the sand,

99
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,874
and you're laying on that
tie-dye towel that I...

100
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,977
[Hope]
That's Sarah,

101
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:40,114
the best thing to come out
of this entire situation.

102
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:43,216
We met almost five years ago
in a hospital support group.

103
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,919
She has cancer, too, obviously,

104
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:47,823
and when you have cancer,
you just get it.

105
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,658
[nurse]
All flushed.

106
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,626
Port seems to be working
just fine.

107
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,796
I'm ready to hook you up as soon
as Pharmacy brings up the bag.

108
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,035
[Hope]
It's important to get it.

109
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:07,141
[nurse]
How we doing here?

110
00:06:07,143 --> 00:06:10,044
Oh, just, you know,
chilling to some chemo

111
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:11,812
and "The Fault in Our Stars."

112
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:13,315
Any pain?

113
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:16,685
Well, if I had
to give it a number,

114
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:19,121
um, it'd be an eight,

115
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:25,027
so can I have more snacks
and a ginger ale, please?

116
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:26,530
[scoffs]
Of course.

117
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,298
[laughs]

118
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,135
They should really start
a patient of the month contest.

119
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:36,139
Don't you think that'd be
an unfair competition?

120
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:38,341
[laughs]
God, you love attention.

121
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:41,311
I love attention just as much
as the next person,

122
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:44,182
but I wouldn't say
that I take advantage of it.

123
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:51,157
And how you doing? Any pain?

124
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:56,993
Um, I guess
I'd say the second one,

125
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:58,761
who just looks constipated.

126
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:02,833
That reminds me, um,
my mom wants you to text her,

127
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:04,970
something about fibrous juices.

128
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:08,072
I'm sorry. I know she's a lot.

129
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:11,775
No. Heh. No, it's sweet.

130
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:15,046
I welcome
D's overprotective doting.

131
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,881
[sighs] My mom's
been so busy these days.

132
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:19,683
- [timer beeping]
- Okay.

133
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:23,721
I'm going to disconnect you
and flush you again.

134
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:24,758
[Hope]
Okay.

135
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,734
[groans]
I can taste it.

136
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:37,838

Mm-hmm.

138
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,987
Mm. Thank you.

139

[nurse]
You all set?

140
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00,026
You should come over this week,

141
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:01,694
any days
your mom's working late.

142
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:03,396
D can make us
something extra bland

143
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:05,298
for us to not want to eat.

144
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,868
[chuckles]

145
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,171
Okay.

146
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,173
Love you.

147
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:14,375
Love you more.

148
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:15,711
Not possible.

00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,020
- [shutter clicks]
- [Hope] That's Seth.

150
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:27,755
He's my best friend, too.

151
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,359
Yes, you can have
two best friends. It's 2016.

152
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:34,097

he doesn't have cancer.

He's only 17,
but sometimes he acts 40.

Hey. How you feeling?

155
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,436
- Hey. Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
- You good?

156
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,838
- Did you eat before chemo?
- Yes.

157
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,006
- You did? Okay, cool.
- Yes.

158
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,841
Do you need the notes for
Mrs. Laga's class, by the way?

159
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,110
Yeah. Here.
I saved you a ginger ale.

160
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,078
No, you drink it. You need it.

161
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,780
Okay, well, let's go.
We're gonna be late for school.

162
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,048
Wait. Since when do you
care about school?

163
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,083
Since I have art first period.

164
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:56,053

just take a nap or something.

177
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:26,917
Yeah, yeah.
Let's get you a kip.

178
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,820
[Hope]
Okay.

179
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:30,088
[Kai]
Come here.

180
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:39,196
[sighs]

181
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:41,099
So my mother and I were

182
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:44,101
on my Make-A-Wish trip
this past summer in Australia.

183
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:46,371
I always wanted to snorkel
the Great Barrier Reef.

184
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:49,207
Turns out, uh, snorkeling's
harder than it looks,

185
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,142
especially with health issues.

186
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:54,211
There we were, just trying to
capture some fish with a GoPro.

187
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,081
I must have looked
like I was drowning,

188
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,985
'cause Kai swam up
and offered his assistance.

189
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:01,820
Instant sparks.

190
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:03,855
But he showed us around the city
for the next few days,

191
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:07,058
most romantic experience
of my life,

192
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,528
even with my mom
three steps behind.

193
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,830
So when he found
I didn't have long,

194
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:15,401
he came to the States with us,
applied for some kind of grant.

195
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:17,003
Apparently Australia
is all right

196
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,037
with wanting young people
to see the world,

197
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,141
so that's cool.

198
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:24,979
[girl] You make dying
look so desirable.

199
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:31,520
Are you talking to me?

200
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,122
Is anybody else
dying in art class?

201
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:37,257
[chuckles]
No. Um, sorry.

202
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:39,462
I just thought you
didn't know who I was, so...

203
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,962
Of course I know who you are.

204
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:44,164
You're Cancer Girl.

205
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,167
And Kai's girlfriend, of course.

206
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:48,403
Where did you get him?

207
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:50,138
Make-A-Wish.

208
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,340
You can get a hot guy
at Make-A-Wish?

209
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:54,241
No, no. It was the trip,

210
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:57,044
um, and he
was just a bonus, so...

211
00:10:57,046 --> 00:11:00,148
[laughs] Oh, I was gonna say,
"I want cancer." I'm kidding.

212
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,150
- [laughs]
- Is he a good kisser, though?

213
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm not kidding,
because I was looking at him,

214
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:05,986
and I was like...

215
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:07,889
Like, I feel
he'd be a good kisser.

216
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,459
You know, I-I don't really
have much to compare it to.

217
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,430
Um, so if it's bad,
it's probably me.

218
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:17,365
Yeah, probably.

219
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,469
Can I have him when you're done?

220
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,437
W-Wait. What?

221
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:23,441
Just think about it.

222
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,010
Okay.

223
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:29,244
No. No, no.

224
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:31,647
Please stop. Stop.
I look terrible today.

225
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,948
You don't, actually.

226
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,384
[groans]

227
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:36,018
Did you, uh,
study for Bio, by the way?

228
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,589
Yes.

229
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:42,024
Sort of. No, look.
I-I talked to Mr. Baser,

230
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:44,927
and he said that I didn't have
to worry about the test, so...

231
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:47,597
When was the last time
you actually took a test?

232
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,700
I took a blood test
this morning.

233
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:51,302
Something that requires
a little more effort.

234
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:52,936
And a PET scan. You know,

235
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:54,404
sometimes they make you
hold your breath.

236
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:56,172
Oh, wow.

237
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,608
Well, if you feel like studying,

238
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,543
tonight I'm gonna
outline chapter 23.

239
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:01,545
It wouldn't hurt to...

240
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:03,247
to, you know, try.

241
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,485
[keyboard clicking]

242
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,085
Hope.

243
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:10,354
Yes. I'm listening.

244
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:12,325
- What'd I just say?
- I'm listening now.

245
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:26,106
[slow-motion growl]

246
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:31,443
[girl]
This is for you.

247
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,478
We think you're so brave.

248
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,748
You're like the girl from "The
Fault in Our Stars," but real.

249
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,618
What's it like to be
Zoe's new best friend?

250
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,353
Did... Did she say that?

251
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:42,020
Did she say I'm actually
her new best friend?

252
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,589
Oh, she's never spoken to us.

253
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:46,159
Oh, my gosh. If she
talked to us, I would die.

254
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:48,127
Could you put in
a good word for me

255
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:50,229
when she, you know,
needs a new you?

256
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,632
[Hope]
Yeah.

257
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:55,201
Um, I-I can tell her
you said, "Hi."

258
00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:56,402
What is your name?

259
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:57,738
Candy...

260
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,040
[together]
Like a Jolly Rancher.

261
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,743
Okay, wow.

262
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:05,078
I think they mean well.

263
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,446
Aren't those the girls
that got in trouble

264
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:07,681
for cyberbullying last year?

265
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:09,283
You know, I-I don't know. I...

266
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,452
Everyone loves me
on the Internet, so...

267
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:13,721
Yeah, 'cause I disabled the
comment section on your vlog.

268
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:16,524
Cupcake?

269
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:17,691
[Mr. Garner]
How are your classes going?

270
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:19,426
Real good.

271
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:21,629
Really? 'Cause you're
failing them all.

272
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:23,431
I've got a D in English.

273
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,065
I'm good at English.

274
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:28,303
Hope, I really think
it's a good idea

275
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:30,370
for you to apply yourself
a little bit more.

276
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:31,639
Why?

277
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:34,578
'Cause, you know...

278
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,647
Are you familiar with the idea

279
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,685
that life is about the journey
and not the destination?

280
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:47,088
Yeah. They tell you that
when you're dying, so...

281
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,994
Look, I know you might be reaching
your destination sooner than some...

282
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,997
but don't you want
your journey to be richer?

283
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:57,066
I think it's more rich.

284
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:59,502
They're both right, actually.

285
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:01,403
[scoffs]
Well, how can two things

286
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:03,105
be right at the same time?

287
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:04,708
Well, if you showed up
to philosophy class,

288
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,708
you would know.

289
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,145
Ha. Good one, Mr. G.

290
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,582
You gonna eat that cupcake?

291
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:14,384
[woman on P.A.] Paging Nurse
Ceylon on Telemetry...

292
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,219
[Dolores]
Rub it in.

293
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,220
Mom, I basically am
hand sanitizer at this point.

294
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:20,357
so you don't need
to tell me what to do.

295
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,158
I know how to rub it in.

296
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,694
After this, let's go
get some of that, uh...

297
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,796
- that trail life tea.
- You know what?

298
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,833
I'd rather not, because I don't
like drinking stale farts,

299
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:32,537
so I'd rather just, you know,
die without the tea.

300
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,204
Wow.

301
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,673
Oh, hey, Dr. Choudary.

302
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,377
Good morning, ladies.
We have some news.

303
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,111
There are no signs of cancer

304
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,314
in both hope's blood work
and her PET scan.

305
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,216
What are you saying?

306
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,720
Remission. We're talking
about clinical remission here.

307
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,489
- Clinical remission?
- Mm-hmm.

308
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:55,126
O-Okay. Wait.
Am I gonna live or die? Like...

309
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,896
There was always a really good
chance of this happening,

310
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,166
but I would never take telling
you something like this lightly,

311
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:03,368
and we would never use
the word "cured."

312
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,404
[fading] We're gonna have
to monitor you very closely

313
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:08,709
for the first five years.
Cancer is tricky, especially...

314
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,280
[woman muted laugh]

315
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:15,916
You know,
we should have a party.

316
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:17,684
- Yes.
- [Dolores] Right?

317
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,351
We should invite all
of your new friends.

318
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,788
[gasps]
Bowling.

319
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,922
We should go bowling.

320
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:26,292
No. No, no. Please, Mom, no.

321
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:27,661
Come on.
We have to celebrate, right?

322
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,262
Yeah, you used to love bowling.

323
00:15:29,264 --> 00:15:30,897
We used to go bowling
all the time.

324
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,733
Yeah, we went bowling
all the time when I was 12.

325
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:34,668
Hey, what's your
guidance counselor's name again?

326
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,137
Mr. Garner.

327
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,440
Why?

328
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:41,575
Oh, I'm writing,
uh, thank-you notes

329
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:43,811
to all your teachers, and I'm
telling them the good news.

330
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:47,314
[laughs] Why do you
do these things?

331
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,416
"Dear Mr. Garner,
thank you for all the help

332
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:50,885
you've given Hope
these past few years.

333
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,554
I am happy to let you know

334
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:54,254
that Hope's cancer
is in remission

335
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:55,689
and she can resume
her studies full time."

336
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:57,859
It's not... It's not terrible.

337
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:59,761
Guess it's back to homework.

338
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:02,965
[sighs]
Thank you, Mother.

339
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:04,734
Mm.

340
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:08,303
Hey, you...
You like Mr. Garner, right?

341
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:10,372
He was helpful with all
the extension stuff?

342
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:12,608
Yeah, he's fine.

343
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,810
Well, do you want to maybe talk
to him instead of a therapist?

344
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:17,412
I'm fine up here. It's the body
that's not cooperating.

345
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:20,650
All right, well, just... I just...
You know, if it's a money thing,

346
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:23,221
we could figure out
a way to make it work.

347
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:26,622
[Hope] Look, he... he knows
we're... we're poor.

348
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:28,357
I mean, it's okay.

349
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,458
[Seth]
It's true.

350
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,926
Well, we're not really...

351
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:34,965
I mean, I could help her study,
you know?

352
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:37,299
Thank you for your enthusiasm.

353
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:39,302
- [chuckles]
- Both of you.

354
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:41,237
- [Dolores] Mm-hmm.
- Hate you guys.

355
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,473
[both laugh]

356
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:50,315
How are you eating?

357
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:53,917
Oh, I-I just told my mom

358
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,687
I'd try harder to eat, so...

359
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,455
Now it's your turn.

360
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:00,024
For guided imagery.

361
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:01,759
Oh, okay. Heh.

362
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:04,429
So close your eyes,
and keep 'em closed.

363
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:08,366
Describe to me
your dream meal in detail.

364
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:10,635
Okay.

365
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,004
[clears throat]

366
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:16,875
I would have spaghetti
with meat sauce.

367
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:20,445
Oh, and... and Parmesan cheese,
you know, like the kind

368
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,313
they grate on top
right in front of you,

369
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,816
and they ask you
when to stop,

370
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,584
but I would never say stop.

371
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,685
I feel you.

372
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,687
I would just start eating,

373
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,892
and the whole meal, the waiter
would just be shredding away.

374
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:35,794
A-And, um, what about dessert?

375
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,630
I-I know that's
your favorite part, so...

376
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:41,600
Mmm. I would have
original tart froyo

377
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,502
with a pizzelle cookie
shoved down the middle

378
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:46,706
to create a firm boundary,
so on one side,

379
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,943
I could put maraschino cherries
and gummi bears,

380
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,711
and on the other side,

381
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:54,983
I could put hot fudge
and Reese's Pieces. Heh.

382
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:58,420
Um, Hope?

383
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:02,923
Uh, yeah. Um...

384
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:05,859
Oh, my gosh. I did that
whole visual imagery thing

385
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:07,627
just so you
could sneak your burger.

386
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,663
No, I didn't. I'm just...
I'm just hungry,

387
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:12,435
because I-I don't have
to get chemo today, so...

388
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,837
Why don't you have chemo today?

389
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,573
Um, Dr. Choudary thought,
you know, I didn't need chemo,

390
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:21,542
on... on account
I'm in remission,

391
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:24,345
and, um, you know,
no... no biggie, so...

392
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:27,015
Oh, my gosh.
Hope, that's amazing!

393
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,987
Yeah. You know, um, I guess.

394
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:34,623
I should probably, um,
just get to school.

395
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,692
I'm sure the Man wants me
to study more, so...

396
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:39,063
Okay. [chuckles]

397
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:41,696
I love you.

398
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:43,698
Love you more.

399
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,634
Not possible.

400
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:48,403
Things are just happening
too fast for me right now.

401
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:52,075
I-I just don't know how to feel.
Am I happy, scared, angry?

402
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,609
Hungry? I mean,
why am I still hungry?

403
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:57,380
I-I feel like I need a sign,
you know?

404
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:58,981
Uh, should I tell everyone,

405
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:01,752
or should I just let it ride
a little bit longer?

406
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,823
[school bell rings]

407
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:07,826
So you need any help?

408
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,828
With what?

409
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,563
Telling everyone.

410
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,865
No. I'm just gonna
tell Sarah first

411
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,766
and then tell
everyone else, so...

412
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,534
Didn't you stop by
the hospital earlier, though?

413
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:20,804
Yeah, but she was sleeping
and so cute,

414
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:22,873
and I-I didn't want
to bother her, you know?

415
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,809
All right.

416
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:26,611
Gonna go do one
of your free periods?

417
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:28,779
- Yeah.
- All right.

418
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:31,548
- Bye.
- See you around.

419
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,418
So you know how I've always
been into street art, yeah?

420
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,788
- No, I-I did not know that.
- Babe.

421
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,525
No, you just have so many ideas,
I can't keep track of them all.

422
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:43,563
Well, this is
my first attempt at street art.

423
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:47,432
[Hope]
Uh, wow.

424
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:50,936
Um, there's so many of them.

425
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:53,872
Where are you
gonna put all of these?

426
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:56,474
Well, these are all part
of my new campaign, Hope.

427
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:58,644
I'm gonna stick them
all over the city.

428
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:01,614
Hopefully I don't get done
by the John Hop.

429
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:03,850
- The wallopers.
- Uh...

430
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:05,751
The fuzz. The coppers.

431
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:06,785
- Yes.
- Yeah.

432
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:08,687
Yes, I know that one.

433
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:11,157
So hopefully after you're gone,

434
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,494
there's gonna be a small piece
of you left around the city.

435
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:16,596
- This is so cool.
- Um, yeah.

436
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:20,033
Uh, can we... can we please...

437
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:22,471
Can we just go talk
someplace more private?

438
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,149
Hope, you're shaking.

439
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,618
[Hope]
Yeah. Well, look at that.

440
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,654
Is it the chemo?

441
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,222
Mm, I don't know.

442
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:43,257
Is it bad news?

443
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:46,560
Well, define "bad news." Um...

444
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:49,697
Well, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

445
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:52,267
I'm just not ready
for this to end.

446
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,875
It's... It's not going to end,
and if it does, I'll be here.

447
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:03,011
Well, what if it's forever?

448
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,548
I'll be here.

449
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:15,193
[Hope]
This is nice.

450
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:22,298
So, D, in her never-ending
overstepping of my boundaries,

451
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,900
has decided to put
all the letters

452
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:25,935
in my teachers' mailboxes.

453
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:27,770
So many problems with this.

454
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:29,908
[school bell rings]

455
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:36,713
Hope, I've got math.

456
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:37,781
- What...
- Get back!

457
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:39,149
[intercom beeps]

458
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:40,984
Any student
who has not turned in

459
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:44,154
their permission slip
to attend Hip-Hop Hullabaloo

460
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:47,825
will not be attending
Hip-Hop Hullabaloo.

461
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:49,227
Thank you.

462
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:51,662
Okay, are you
gonna help me or not?

463
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:53,130
I don't even know
what we're doing.

464
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:54,865
We're gonna go get back
the letters.

465
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:56,967
And don't give me
that look, okay?

466
00:21:56,969 --> 00:21:59,204
It's technically not stealing.
She used my stationary, so...

467
00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:01,572
Okay, one more time, why would
we get rid of the letters

468
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:02,774
that completely solve
your whole dilemma?

469
00:22:02,776 --> 00:22:04,243
I don't have to tell people

470
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:06,244
until, you know,
I get my life back together.

471
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:08,313
Okay, so what's the plan?

472
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:11,016
Okay, we're gonna go in there,
and we're gonna steal...

473
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:14,220
take back... take back
the letters from the mailboxes.

474
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:15,955
That's the plan?

475
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:19,157
Well, it's the f-first draft
of a plan.

476
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,693
- What if Mr. Burda catches you?
- That's why you're here.

477
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:23,829
You're the lookout,
in case, you know,

478
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:26,298
um, I get in trouble
or something,

479
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,802
or you just... you could
distract him or something.

480
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:32,605
Really love the detail
you've put into this.

481
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:35,608
Okay, I got... Yeah, same.
Okay, let's go. Hands in.

482
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,744
- [school bell rings]
- Come on.

483
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:40,880
Go, team.

484
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:43,184
Okay, let's do this.

485
00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:47,923
[paper slicer thunks]

486
00:22:54,196 --> 00:22:56,098
[Mr. Burda humming a tune]

487
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,171
Okay, muffin. You got your tea.

488
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,205
Now what?

489
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:06,775
[gasps]
Mail!

490
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,913
Mrs. Thompson.

491
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:14,416
Oh. Nice lady.

492
00:23:14,418 --> 00:23:16,750
She's such a sweetie pie.

493
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:18,920
Ah, who rearranged this?

494
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:19,921
Uh...

495
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:21,789
Mrs. Thompson...

496
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,927
Thompson. Thompson. Thompson.

497
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:26,095
Thompson. Ompson.

498
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:28,163
Thom... There she is. All right.

499
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:31,300
And the next lucky winner.

500
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:34,002
Ms. Stuart.

501
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:36,872
Snippy, snappy Stuart.

502
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,441
She's a cow.

503
00:23:38,443 --> 00:23:41,176
Hmm. Stuart. Stu...

504
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:42,613
Oh. There we go.

505
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:47,016
Oh! I think I put that
in the wrong box.

506
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,320
Nope, that's good.

507
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:52,988
Coach Callenberg. All right.

508
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,291
Rah, rah, sis-boom-bah.

509
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:58,096
Football team's
not gonna go so far.

510
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:03,102
Callenberg. Callenberg.
There we go.

511
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:10,042
Oh. All done.

512
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:12,710
Now what?

513
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,647
Oh, lunch.

514
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:21,452
- [no audible dialogue]
- [whispering] Uh, yeah.

515
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:23,689
- Ring the bell. That's gonna...
- Okay, go. Go.

516
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,995
[bell rings]

517
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:30,961
I'm eating.

518
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:32,930
You see...

519
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:35,400
Come back after lunch.

520
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:37,035
Bye.

521
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:38,504
- Scoot. Scoot.
- Yeah.

522
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:39,973
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

523
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:45,010
She even wrote one
to the janitor.

524
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:47,946
You know what? Maybe I'm just
gonna drop out. My mom did.

525
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:49,916
Yeah, 'cause she stopped
fitting into the uniforms.

526
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:50,917
She was pregnant.

527
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:53,051
I'm kidding.

528
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:55,122
Mostly. I'll study.

529
00:24:57,058 --> 00:24:58,858
Wait. You're not planning
on using cancer

530
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,227
- as a way to not study, right?
- No! I'll do it.

531
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:03,129
Good. It's important
for you to start focusing

532
00:25:03,131 --> 00:25:04,964
and actually, like,
you know, learning something.

533
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:06,832
Seth, I got it.

534
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,301
You know what this means?

535
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,036
We can go to college
and grad school now.

536
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:11,471
We can get apartments
in the city.

537
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:13,242
I'm not ready
to think about that yet.

538
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:17,879
So what does Kai think?

539
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:21,281
He's... He's really cool with it.

540
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:22,883
He doesn't know, does he?

541
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:24,351
I mean, what does
knowing really...

542
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:27,121
- You didn't tell him?
- I-I told him.

543
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:29,489
No, you're lying right now. 'cause your
voice gets, like, super high when you lie.

544
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:31,792
That's what's happening right now. Yeah,
you're lying right now. I can hear it.

545
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:33,494
- No, it's not.
- I know you're lying every time.

546
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:36,331
- These are for you.
- Also we're totally wearing

547
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,833
these stickers of your face
to support you.

548
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:40,268
Wow.

549
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,470
What does Zoe smell like?

550
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:43,906
Not like desperation.

551
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:49,578
I wanted to know if you wanted to get
a mani-pedi with me after school.

552
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,414
Oh, I-I've never gotten
a real mani-pedi before.

553
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:56,319
Okay. Cool.
We can have some quality time...

554
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:58,356
alone.

555
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,426
These look better
than the last batch, so...

556
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:05,561
Hey, bub.

557
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,997
[kiss]
So right now,

558
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,965
I'm in a lot of trouble
for these stickers.

559
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,900
Apparently, you guys
had this street artist

560
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:13,969
who designed
Barack Obama's first campaign,

561
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:15,972
and he had
the slogan "Hope," too,

562
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,776
so it makes me look
like a complete cherry picker.

563
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:23,046
- I... Like, I look like a dag.
- No.

564
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,548
- I-I look like a silly bum.
- No. Just...

565
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,951
I look like One Direction
stealing Janoskians music.

566
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,219
I-I look like a fraud!

567
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,287
[Hope sighs]

568
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,289
Ahh! They're everywhere!

569
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:36,061
[Kai groans]

570
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:40,532
So, uh, you still
want to come study with me?

571
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,268
No. I'm gonna go
get a mani-pedi.

572
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,571
I can't study with my nails
looking like normal, can I?

573
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:48,939
Of course not.

574
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,843
[dramatic theme playing]

575
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,114
[sighs]
Thanks for inviting me.

576
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,351
Yeah. I do it every week.

577
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:02,220
It's expensive, but that's what
my dad's credit card is for.

578
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:03,655
He feels bad
that he's never around,

579
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:05,289
and that's why he does it,

580
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,359
but doesn't stop him.
Cool, right?

581
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:09,661
The cooliest.

582
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:13,065
So, um, are you dating anyone?

583
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,900
God, no.

584
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,635
Guys my age are so obnoxious.

585
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,437
I think I need someone
more sensitive.

586
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:20,339
Yeah. You know,
I got lucky with Kai,

587
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:21,907
but even then, I had to travel

588
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:24,043
halfway across the world
to get him, so...

589
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:26,379
[cell phone texting]

590
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:28,149
My nails look so pretty.

591
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:36,858
[theme music stops]

592
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:44,431
So what'd the teachers say
about the good news?

593
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:46,165
Uh, about what now?

594
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:49,069
About your remission letters
that I sent.

595
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:51,238
Right. Um, no, nothing.

596
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,307
You know,
no one's called me yet.

597
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:57,544
Everyone's super busy
with midterms and... and stoof.

598
00:27:57,546 --> 00:27:59,380
Are you taking those?

599
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:01,716
That's the plan, and if
it's all on chapter one,

600
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:04,185
page one, paragraph one,
I'll be fine.

601
00:28:04,187 --> 00:28:06,487
[laughs]
Oh, you're gonna do great.

602
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:09,393
Yeah, well, I have plenty
of time to be great now, so...

603
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:13,128
[laughs]

604
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,464
What's happening
on your fingernails?

605
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:17,732
Oh, I got a manicure.
Do you like it?

606
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:19,134
Yeah, I like...

607
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:22,170
Uh, we can't afford a manicure.

608
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:24,573
Okay. Well, Zoe paid for it.

609
00:28:24,575 --> 00:28:26,409
and she considers it
therapeutic, so...

610
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:28,744
Oh. Zoe.

611
00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:30,412
Zoe, the doctor.

612
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:32,247
Uh, when do I get to meet her?

613
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,316
- Maybe later.
- Tonight?

614
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:37,587
I don't know, Mom, but, um,
I'm gonna go study mitosis,

615
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:40,924
and if I can remember correctly,
it's how cancer cells replicate.

616
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:57,176
[sighs]

617
00:29:00,312 --> 00:29:02,012
[pop music playing
over headphones]

618
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:04,448
- [knock on door]
- [door opens]

619
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,750
Can't wait to hear
why these were in your bag

620
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,452
and not
in your teachers' mailboxes.

621
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:11,289
Well, why were you
going through my stuff?

622
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,524
Why are you stealing
from mailboxes?

623
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:15,226
This is a fun game.

624
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:17,530
Because I want
to tell everyone on my own.

625
00:29:19,164 --> 00:29:21,468
I-I was only trying to help.

626
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:24,738
I don't need your help, so...

627
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,774
Okay, yeah.

628
00:29:29,776 --> 00:29:31,275
[Hope]
Okay.

629
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:32,680
Can you close the door?

630
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:40,286
[sighs]

631
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:50,030
[pop music
playing over headphones]

632
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,533
Then she says, "Close the door."

633
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:56,536
There's no closed doors
in our house.

634
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:59,205
So I want to keep helping her,
but I have to help her

635
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:00,841
in the way that I haven't
always helped her,

636
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:01,842
so I need your help.

637
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:03,811
What can I do?

638
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:05,712
You know, I want
to respect her boundaries,

639
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:07,480
and I want to give her space,

640
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,282
but I also have
to keep tabs on her hard-core.

641
00:30:09,284 --> 00:30:11,084
You want me to spy on her?

642
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:12,285
Yes.

643
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,721
Heh, I'm not gonna do that.

644
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:16,322
You know, then guide her
or counsel her.

645
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:19,460
You know, i-it's actually built
into your job title.

646
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:21,160
You know,
what do you guys actually do?

647
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:22,563
Both those things,

648
00:30:22,565 --> 00:30:24,300
but not always in that order.

649
00:30:26,703 --> 00:30:28,536
Sorry. I'm, uh,

650
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:30,571
coming off angrier
than I intend to.

651
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:35,477
Just, I-I do not know
how to help her anymore.

652
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,312
Look, if anything happens,

653
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:39,581
I will definitely
let you know about it.

654
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:43,451
But otherwise, you're gonna have to
let her figure it out on her own.

655
00:30:43,453 --> 00:30:45,820
And what if she ends up
making terrible choices?

656
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:48,691
[laughs]
She's a kid.

657
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:51,663
She's definitely
gonna make bad choices.

658
00:30:54,231 --> 00:30:55,632
Great.

659
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,271
Thank you.

660
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,208
- Oh, Dolores...
- Uh-huh?

661
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,278
Could you close the door?

662
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,516
Oh, yeah.
I see what you did there.

663
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:19,424
[sighs]

664
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,767
Is it better
to burn out or fade away?

665
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,938
I-I mean, look at Heath Ledger
or James Dean

666
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,940
or Janis Joplin
or Jimmi Hendrix.

667
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:37,675
I mean, they all died young,

668
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:40,310
not like these old people
that just keep on living,

669
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:43,413
and you're just like,
"Gah, when is it gonna happen?"

670
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:45,683
That was mean, but, anyway,

671
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:49,287
I'm just asking a hypothetical
question for a friend.

672
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:53,325
Is it better to die popular
or live a loser?

673
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:56,361
Heh. Oh, my God.

674
00:31:56,363 --> 00:31:58,897
You... You see
that girl over there?

675
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:00,566
[Hope]
Yeah.

676
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:02,534
[Zoe] Go ask her
if she wants to sit with us,

677
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:05,271
and when she's like, "Yes,"
say, "I'm kidding."

678
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,706
That's not really funny.

679
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,541
That's the point of a joke.

680
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:10,778
I'll do it.

681
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,455
Hey, you want
to come sit with us?

682
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:26,593
Hey. You were supposed
to meet me. What happened?

683
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:28,694
[Candy] What are
you listening to?

684
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,797
- I just forgot. I-I'm sorry.
- You mean you didn't want to?

685
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,866
No, I did.
I was just studying last night.

686
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,835
Did you know that I have six
midterms, one for every subject?

687
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:37,270
Yeah.

688
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:38,639
Seth, stop bothering her.

689
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:39,973
She has cancer.

690
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,643
- Yeah, but it's...
- [girls laughing]

691
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:45,412
Oh, my God!

692
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:47,848
It's getting worse?

693
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,517
Oh, my God. The cancer?

694
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,287
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

695
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:56,357
Hey. Here you go.

696
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,758
Those guys are jerks.
Don't worry about it.

697
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,326
- Thank you.
- Sure.

698
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:02,633
[Hope] It's getting worse, so...

699
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,902
"Hey, Hope,
what did you do today?"

700
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,037
"Oh, I just told everyone
and their mom

701
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,574
that my cancer's getting worse,
and that's so not true,

702
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,810
and I'm such a liar,
and I hate myself."

703
00:33:14,812 --> 00:33:16,812
Oh, my God. I'm so sad.

704
00:33:16,814 --> 00:33:18,613
We just got mani-pedis.

705
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:20,649
I want to throw you a party
to, you know, help.

706
00:33:20,651 --> 00:33:22,617
It'll be kind of like a wake,
but you're still alive.

707
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:24,620
No. No, no, no.
I can't let you do that.

708
00:33:24,622 --> 00:33:25,988
You're not letting me.
I want to.

709
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,657
My house, next Friday. Cool.

710
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,791
Okay, but that
wasn't part of the plan,

711
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:31,828
- but there was...
- [Kai] Hope.

712
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,597
Where have you been?
Why didn't you tell me?

713
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,899
I just told Zoe,
like, 60 seconds ago.

714
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:38,403
How did you find out?

715
00:33:39,672 --> 00:33:41,303
Okay. Um...

716
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:42,705
Is it true?

717
00:33:42,707 --> 00:33:44,574
Yes?

718
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:46,409
I need to tell you something.

719
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:48,846
Okay, so some of the most
perfect things in life

720
00:33:48,848 --> 00:33:51,782
don't last forever,
like sunsets or rainbows

721
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:54,084
or the polar ice caps,

722
00:33:54,086 --> 00:33:56,687
and I know you're
not gonna be around forever,

723
00:33:56,689 --> 00:34:00,557
so I wanted to tell you
how I really felt.

724
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,792
I love you.

725
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:03,864
[laughs]
No, no, you don't.

726
00:34:04,964 --> 00:34:06,463
Oh, my God. You do.

727
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:08,400
Well, I love you, too, Kai.

728
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:13,538
So the cooliest thing
happened today.

729
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,007
Kai told me he loved me,
and I love him, too,

730
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:17,842
so that's cool.

731
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:20,445
Hey, are you coming
to the bowling party tomorrow?

732
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,981
- Yeah. I'll be there.
- So great you told everyone,

733
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:25,550
and now Zoe's throwing
that party for you Friday night.

734
00:34:25,552 --> 00:34:27,352
Hey, are her parents
gonna be there?

735
00:34:27,354 --> 00:34:29,454
Um, probably not.
They have weird jobs, so...

736
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:31,991
O-Oh, okay.

737
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:33,859
Yeah, Mom, okay.

738
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:35,761
So we're, um, hanging out,
so you can just not...

739
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:37,963
Oh, not be here? Okay.

740
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:42,067
So Zoe's throwing you a party.

741
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:43,803
That's pretty cool.

742
00:34:43,805 --> 00:34:45,638
Yeah, okay.
It's not a big deal, okay,

743
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,773
so let's just watch,
you know, watch a movie.

744
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:49,776
What about "Me, Earl,
and the Dying Girl"?

745
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:52,711
Or how about "Life of Pi"?

746
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:54,380
Or "The Kings of Summer"

747
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:56,049
- or "Life is Beautiful"?
- No.

748
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:57,851
No more movies
about death, okay?

749
00:34:57,853 --> 00:34:59,052
Death isn't a joke.

750
00:34:59,054 --> 00:35:00,787
Okay, I'll put on "Life of Pi,"

751
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:02,789
or whatever,
but I'm not happy about it.

752
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:05,391
You're not happy about anything.

753
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:08,662
Oh, I know.
What if you weren't dying?

754
00:35:08,664 --> 00:35:10,497
- Would that make you happy?
- Okay.

755
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,099
Mmm, wait. Mmm.

756
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:15,169
Okay, okay, look,
I-I need you more than anyone

757
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:17,171
to understand what
I'm going through, you know?

758
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:18,707
I-I'll tell them.

759
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:21,510
Wait.

760
00:35:23,513 --> 00:35:25,913
Wait. You didn't
even tell them yet?

761
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,050
I'm getting there.
I just need more time.

762
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:31,419
You need more time? Oh, my God.

763
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,821
That is such a non-terminal
person thing to say.

764
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:37,025
Hey, that's the meanest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

765
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:38,994
No, it's not.
In the sixth grade,

766
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:41,029
boys called you Casper,
the flat-chested ghost.

767
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:42,563
[laughs] Stop.

768
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:44,199
Look, I already feel
pretty bad.

769
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:46,702
You should have seen
Seth and my mom's faces.

770
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:48,837
They were, like, so happy.

771
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,440
And you're not happy?

772
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:53,442
Well, I'm not not happy.

773
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:57,046
I'm just scared for how
everything's gonna change.

774
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:59,749
Things were always
going to change anyway.

775
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,720
This kind of change is good.

776
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:04,453
I like things the way they are.

777
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:07,190
I-I like my boyfriend.

778
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:08,992
I like my friends. I...

779
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:10,760
I mean, you should see
how mean everyone is

780
00:36:10,762 --> 00:36:12,129
to the kids who don't fit in.

781
00:36:12,131 --> 00:36:13,964
They broke
some girl's phone today.

782
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:16,666
I'm glad cancer is
all about the attention for you,

783
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:18,534
because for me,

784
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:21,071
it's about how
I can't go to school

785
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:22,842
or swallow food...

786
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,910
that I'll never be kissed,

787
00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:29,947
and that pretty soon,
I will be completely forgotten.

788
00:36:29,949 --> 00:36:31,649
I won't forget about you.

789
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:34,219
- You already have.
- That's so not true.

790
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:36,787
You know, maybe...
maybe we aren't really friends.

791
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:38,223
Maybe we never really were.

792
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:40,557
Maybe we just had dying
to keep us close,

793
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,164
because right now, it seems
like we have nothing in common.

794
00:36:45,966 --> 00:36:47,766
You know what? You're right.

795
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:49,968
Because I have... I have Zoe now,

796
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,172
and I don't even care
about you anymore.

797
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,106
They don't actually like you.

798
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:56,841
They actually love me.

799
00:36:56,843 --> 00:36:59,147
Kai told me,
so you're just jealous.

800
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,182
[sighs]
Oh, God.

801
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:05,986
[dramatic theme playing]

802
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:22,235
[Helen]
Okay, I convinced that nurse

803
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:24,171
to let us get in
to see the doctor first,

804
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:25,973
and then I was able
to push back my 2:30,

805
00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:28,574
so now we will able
to squeeze all of this in.

806
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:30,143
Then I'm gonna
drop you off at home,

807
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:34,181
and then I have got
to get back to the office.

808
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:35,282
[Helen sighs]

809
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:37,019
It's a busy day, huh?

810
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:40,087
Yeah, it's a busy day.

811
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:42,189
[Helen] Yeah, I just walked
right up to her, and I was like,

812
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:44,057
"My daughter
is having a transplant.

813
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:47,561
We need to meet
with Dr. Karato immediately."

814
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:50,665
It's a power thing
with these doctors,

815
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:52,735
making you wait.
Drives me nuts.

816
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:56,706
Hey, how are you feeling?

817
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:00,608
I'm fine.

818
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,610
[cell phone ringing]

819
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:05,079
[groans]
Great. You mind?

820
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:06,581
No, I'm good.

821
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,849
Go for Helen.

822
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,650
No.

823
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:11,186
No, absolutely not.

824
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,089
You tell him no.

825
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,192
Hey, come on.

826
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,729
- [groans]
- Come on.

827
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,300
You know, I really should be
studying, getting good grades.

828
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,836
No, hey, hey, don't worry
about it. This is great.

829
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,138
- Okay, this is the future.
- If this is the future,

830
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,839
where's cancer
when you need it, you know?

831
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,208
Look, you can finally embrace

832
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,910
all the things
life has to offer, okay?

833
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,279
Everything you could ever want
is within reach.

834
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,048
Well, I can reach the pamphlets.

835
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,116
I... Do I need the pamphlets?

836
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,652
You do. Look,
we've got community college.

837
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,988
We've got
computer programming school.

838
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,623
- Exciting.
- We've got the Army

839
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,725
- and the Navy.
- No and no.

840
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,062
Look, okay, why don't we just
grab a couple of these pamphlets

841
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:54,931
and go over 'em, I don't know,
say, maybe Friday, 10 p.m.?

842
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,636
I think you know that's
when Zoe's party for me is.

843
00:38:58,638 --> 00:39:00,337
Guess you're planning
on going to that.

844
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,374
Yeah, I'm gonna go
with my boyfriend

845
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:04,241
to the super-cool party
being planned for me

846
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:06,744
instead of sitting inside,
looking at lame pamphlets

847
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:09,381
that are for careers
15 years ahead, so...

848
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:11,249
Hey, at least you admit
you've got 15 more years.

849
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:13,018
[Kai]
Cobber, mates.

850
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,319
Hey, babe.

851
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:16,055
You're lookin' bonzer as ush.

852
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:20,092
So, uh, what are you doing here?

853
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:23,295
Um, I'm not here for me.
I-It's for Seth.

854
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:25,864
Ah, cool.
You gonna be a digger, mate?

855
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:28,300
- What'd you call me?
- You wanna join the Army.

856
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:30,368
Oh, God, no.

857
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,904
Now I want you to take this
pamphlet home, and look at this.

858
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:35,041
You get some pair of sunglasses,
too. How 'bout that?

859
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:36,676
[girl]
Thank you.

860
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:40,011
Hope, it's so brave
of you to be here.

861
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:41,414
It must be so depressing

862
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,416
to see people inspire
to have a career.

863
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:45,218
I think it's "aspire," actually.

864
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,886
Totally.

865
00:39:46,888 --> 00:39:48,224
Hope!

866
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:51,291
Nurse Joyce.

867
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:54,794
Ooh. Hope, is this
the famous Kai?

868
00:39:54,796 --> 00:39:57,264
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

869
00:39:57,266 --> 00:40:00,134
His eyes are even
more sparkly than you described.

870
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:01,969
Yep. There are
many solar systems.

871
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:04,036
- [Joyce] And that accent, mmm.
- [Kai laughs]

872
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:05,872
Um, I just want
to thank you so much

873
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:08,308
for looking after Hope.
It's been hard, you know.

874
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,178
Despite all the treatment,
she's still getting worse.

875
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,813
What are you talking about?

876
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:14,983
Oh, that Hope
is super close to dying

877
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:16,483
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

878
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:18,152
Hope's not dying.

879
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:21,222
Oh. Do you guys
call it something else?

880
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:23,791
- "You guys," as in doctors?
- Totally.

881
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:26,261
Hope, uh,
I thought you told them.

882
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:27,928
What's she talking about, babe?

883
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,397
Yeah, "babe,"
what's she talking about?

884
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:33,835
Uh, I was going to tell you...

885
00:40:33,837 --> 00:40:35,304
Your manicure.

886
00:40:35,306 --> 00:40:37,339
I'm going to tell you,

887
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:40,975
uh, right... now.

888
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:42,078
Um...

889
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,281
Well, are you gonna tell us?

890
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:47,149
Uh, totally. Um...

891
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:50,453
Well, uh, you know how it's
really meant a lot to me

892
00:40:50,455 --> 00:40:52,388
to have so many
new friends, and...

893
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,091
Kai, you... you know
how you feel about you,

894
00:40:56,093 --> 00:40:57,927
and I know
how you feel about me,

895
00:40:57,929 --> 00:41:00,530
so I'm just...
I'm just gonna say it. Um...

896
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:03,366
I'm actually not getting sicker,
I'm actually getting better,

897
00:41:03,368 --> 00:41:07,170
so I'm getting so much better
that I don't need treatment,

898
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,406
on account
that I'm getting better. Um...

899
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:12,478
in conclusion,
I am not dying a teenager.

900
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,012
Ta-da.

901
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:17,480
Eww.

902
00:41:17,482 --> 00:41:19,115
Um, we're supposed
to replace you.

903
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:20,484
Hey, this has nothing
to do with you.

904
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:21,987
Yes, it does.
We brought her cupcakes.

905
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,326
Kai, say something.

906
00:41:27,893 --> 00:41:29,260
You lied to me.

907
00:41:29,262 --> 00:41:31,295
It was an accident.
It just came out,

908
00:41:31,297 --> 00:41:33,464
and I'm better.
Isn't that all that matters?

909
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:38,303
Look, Hope,
I care about you. I do.

910
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:42,940
I'm 17. I'm not ready
for a long-term commitment.

911
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:46,078
I left Australia for you.

912
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,349
I haven't seen
my family in ages.

913
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:52,453
But you love me.

914
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:57,424
I mean, you love me, right?

915
00:41:59,994 --> 00:42:01,893
Bigger wanker than I thought.

916
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,862
Yeah, well, at least
I'm not in love with some girl

917
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:06,965
who thinks I'm just some bloke!

918
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:09,404
Oh, my God.
You totally love her.

919
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:12,305
Whatever.

920
00:42:12,307 --> 00:42:13,509
I'm just gonna
go paint something.

921
00:42:23,486 --> 00:42:25,452
I heard Hope
doesn't have cancer anymore,

922
00:42:25,454 --> 00:42:28,054
so we're gonna have
to change the name of my party.

923
00:42:28,056 --> 00:42:31,157
What about a cupcake party?

924
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,395
Yes.

925
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:38,032
I hope you're happy.

926
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:39,303
What?

927
00:42:40,436 --> 00:42:42,236
You're the only reason

928
00:42:42,238 --> 00:42:44,071
I'm at this stupid
career fair to begin with,

929
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:47,275
embracing dumb life
and its stupid opportunities.

930
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:49,577
No, that's life.
Sometimes you get hurt.

931
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:52,146
What do you know
about getting hurt?

932
00:42:52,148 --> 00:42:54,316
Dying is easy.

933
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:56,084
Life is hard.

934
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:59,622
You have... You have no idea
what I go through.

935
00:42:59,624 --> 00:43:02,425
I've been around you
every day now.

936
00:43:02,427 --> 00:43:04,559
Every day, I'm here with you.
You tell me your problems,

937
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:06,194
and I'm listening to you.

938
00:43:06,196 --> 00:43:07,596
I know
what you're going through.

939
00:43:07,598 --> 00:43:09,434
All you do is
just follow me around.

940
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:13,371
Fine. I'm out.

941
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,142
Well, thanks for another
great life event.

942
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:26,916
Today was kind of...
kind of the worst day ever.

943
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:29,921
I went from being
at the top of the top to...

944
00:43:31,423 --> 00:43:32,857
nothing.

945
00:43:34,393 --> 00:43:36,059
Don't have
any more fake friends,

946
00:43:36,061 --> 00:43:37,996
and my real friends
can't stand me.

947
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:44,234
[school bell rings]

948
00:43:44,236 --> 00:43:45,569
- Hello.
- [knocks]

949
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:47,237
Hey.

950
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:49,707
- Hey!
- What are those?

951
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:53,377
- These are apology brownies.
- Why?

952
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:55,245
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're not for you.

953
00:43:55,247 --> 00:43:57,648
They're for all of the people
that Hope lied to.

954
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,184
But why are you sorry?
You didn't...

955
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:01,953
You didn't do anything wrong.

956
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:03,954
I didn't do anything wrong,
but Hope did,

957
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:06,124
and she's my kid
and reflects on me,

958
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:07,527
so I baked brownies.

959
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:15,502
Dolores, it is not your job
to protect her.

960
00:44:18,037 --> 00:44:20,641
You know, people say that.

961
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,675
People say that a lot,

962
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:25,647
but if I didn't protect her...

963
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:29,148
she could have died.

964
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,083
You know what
I've protected her from?

965
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,354
I've protected her from germs,
getting too much sun.

966
00:44:34,356 --> 00:44:37,757
I have actually protected her
from elderly people hugs.

967
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,093
All right, I have been
a one-person defensive line,

968
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:45,064
and this high school,
it's like a malignancy, right?

969
00:44:45,066 --> 00:44:47,768
Those mean girls,
they're like an infection.

970
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,037
High school is just hard.

971
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:53,773
Forget cancer
or a girl with one parent.

972
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:56,644
It's just hard.

973
00:44:56,646 --> 00:44:58,779
All day long,
I've got kids who need to learn

974
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:01,382
how to build up
their own immunities.

975
00:45:01,384 --> 00:45:04,252
Half of high school is learning
how to live in this world.

976
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:09,459
She wasn't supposed
to live in this world...

977
00:45:12,763 --> 00:45:15,229
and I didn't prepare her to.

978
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:18,165
Well, guess what, Dolores,
she is now,

979
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:21,670
and there's no right way
of going about this,

980
00:45:21,672 --> 00:45:24,406
but you got to let her
figure it out.

981
00:45:24,408 --> 00:45:26,477
Agh!

982
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:30,345
I don't like it.

983
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:32,483
What... What do you
want me to tell you?

984
00:45:34,117 --> 00:45:35,317
Told me enough.

985
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:37,185
I got it.

986
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:39,254
See? I guided and counseled.

987
00:45:39,256 --> 00:45:40,823
- Yeah. Caught it.
- Yeah.

988
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:42,725
- Ah, thank you.
- It's quite impressive.

989
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:44,327
Heh.

990
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:46,262
Earned yourself
a plate of brownies.

991
00:45:46,264 --> 00:45:47,797
No, no, no, no. I can't. It's...

992
00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:49,332
- I can't.
- Oh, all right.

993
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:50,435
No, no, no. It's actually...
It's fine.

994
00:45:51,536 --> 00:45:52,737
Yeah.

995
00:45:55,673 --> 00:45:57,507
Do you think
anyone is gonna come

996
00:45:57,509 --> 00:45:58,742
to this bowling party tomorrow?

997
00:45:58,744 --> 00:46:00,477
What bowling party?

998
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:02,179
[pins clatter]

999
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:03,713
[instrumental music
playing over speakers]

1000
00:46:03,715 --> 00:46:05,784
[Dolores] Five bucks,
this is a gutter ball.

1001
00:46:07,786 --> 00:46:10,254
Well, this isn't sad at all.

1002
00:46:10,256 --> 00:46:12,289
No one came
to your bowling party, D.

1003
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,192
Mr. G came.

1004
00:46:15,427 --> 00:46:17,761
[Dolores] Look, I'm sorry
that Kai broke up with you.

1005
00:46:17,763 --> 00:46:20,597
Yeah, well, I feel like
cancer broke up with me, too.

1006
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:22,332
[Dolores]
You weren't dating cancer.

1007
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:24,536
Yeah, well, it lived with me,
slept with me,

1008
00:46:24,538 --> 00:46:26,172
brought me lots of flowers
and attention.

1009
00:46:27,573 --> 00:46:31,043
Uh, no.
People brought you those.

1010
00:46:32,345 --> 00:46:34,347
Yeah, because I had cancer.

1011
00:46:36,851 --> 00:46:39,216
[Dolores] You know, forget
about Kai and those girls,

1012
00:46:39,218 --> 00:46:41,352
because the people who matter
still care about you.

1013
00:46:41,354 --> 00:46:43,621
Well, screwed that up,
too, so...

1014
00:46:43,623 --> 00:46:45,858
I texted Seth and Sarah,
like, a million times,

1015
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:46,892
and nothing.

1016
00:46:46,894 --> 00:46:49,128
Were you being a brat?

1017
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,696
Thank you.

1018
00:46:50,698 --> 00:46:52,463
Glad to know you're
not on my side either.

1019
00:46:52,465 --> 00:46:54,265
This isn't about sides.

1020
00:46:54,267 --> 00:46:56,435
Well, then, you know what?
I don't need to be here,

1021
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:59,440
- so enjoy your gutter balls.
- Hope...

1022
00:47:09,418 --> 00:47:11,351
[chuckles]
Should we still...

1023
00:47:11,353 --> 00:47:13,153
Yeah. Oh, yeah, we're bowling.

1024
00:47:13,155 --> 00:47:16,388
She can have a pity party
all by herself.

1025
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,325
I'm sorry.

1026
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:20,895
I-I thought this would be fun.
Thank you for actually coming.

1027
00:47:20,897 --> 00:47:22,730
No, my pleasure.
Thank you for having me.

1028
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:25,700
Nah, I had this big idea,

1029
00:47:25,702 --> 00:47:29,336
'cause we used to come here all
the time when she was little.

1030
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:32,707
She loved it here, you know,
before all the...

1031
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:34,175
Yeah.

1032
00:47:34,177 --> 00:47:35,810
It still has the same smell.

1033
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,578
You know, it's very, uh...
I don't know.

1034
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,279
Comforting? Old shoes.

1035
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:40,581
[both laugh]

1036
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:41,949
I get it.

1037
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:44,185
I like to go down to the river.

1038
00:47:44,187 --> 00:47:45,887
Yeah, dead fish.

1039
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:47,589
- That's a comforting smell.
- No, not the dead fish.

1040
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:50,859
I-I watch for boats.

1041
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:52,794
- Boats.
- Yep.

1042
00:47:52,796 --> 00:47:55,229
- Do we have boats on the river?
- Nope, we don't,

1043
00:47:55,231 --> 00:47:57,265
but we do have
the second most drawbridges

1044
00:47:57,267 --> 00:47:59,401
of any city in the world,
second to Amsterdam,

1045
00:47:59,403 --> 00:48:00,402
but first in diversity.

1046
00:48:00,404 --> 00:48:01,871
Ah. The more you know...

1047
00:48:01,873 --> 00:48:03,939
I just completely
geeked out on you right now.

1048
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:06,541
I'm sorry. That's...
Just I'm from Rhode Island,

1049
00:48:06,543 --> 00:48:08,577
and we have a rich
maritime tradition there...

1050
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:09,946
And I just said, "maritime."

1051
00:48:09,948 --> 00:48:11,848
I don't know why
I'm rambling about boats.

1052
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,316
[both laugh]

1053
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:15,283
But I get it.

1054
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:16,788
Change can be hard.

1055
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:20,825
Yeah.
Hope's going through a lot.

1056
00:48:21,994 --> 00:48:23,428
I meant for you.

1057
00:48:25,998 --> 00:48:27,397
You know what's hard?

1058
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:28,665
What's that?

1059
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,333
That you're about to lose.

1060
00:48:30,335 --> 00:48:32,402
[laughs]
Oh, my God.

1061
00:48:32,404 --> 00:48:33,906
Okay. Let's see what you got.

1062
00:48:39,244 --> 00:48:41,011
[Nurse Kelly]
Good morning. I'm nurse Kelly.

1063
00:48:41,013 --> 00:48:43,814
I'm going to be taking you down
to the operation today, okay?

1064
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:45,816
Can you tell me
your date of birth?

1065
00:48:45,818 --> 00:48:48,787
8-30-1998.

1066
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:52,022
All right. And can you tell me
what you're having done today?

1067
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:56,728
An autologous hematopoiesis
cell transplantation.

1068
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:59,266
And can you tell me
your pain level?

1069
00:49:04,403 --> 00:49:06,406
Okay. Thank you.

1070
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,641
All right. Let's go.

1071
00:49:09,643 --> 00:49:12,745
[dramatic theme playing]

1072
00:49:12,747 --> 00:49:15,880
I would love to see everybody
at the basketball game tonight.

1073
00:49:15,882 --> 00:49:18,349
I can't promise you
an amazing game,

1074
00:49:18,351 --> 00:49:21,319
but, as you know,

1075
00:49:21,321 --> 00:49:24,323
the nachos are free
with your student I.D.

1076
00:49:24,325 --> 00:49:26,492
- [school bell rings]
- Hey, hey, hey!

1077
00:49:26,494 --> 00:49:28,629
The bell does not dismiss you.
I dismiss you.

1078
00:49:31,032 --> 00:49:33,434
Okay, you can go. Hope.

1079
00:49:39,474 --> 00:49:40,708
Proud of you.

1080
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,411
Hands to yourself, man.

1081
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:48,348
- [door closes]
- Look, if it's about the D,

1082
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,383
it's not gonna happen again.

1083
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:54,454
Hope, it's nothing
to do with the test.

1084
00:49:54,456 --> 00:49:57,624
I and every other teacher
have let certain things slide.

1085
00:49:57,626 --> 00:50:00,461
We've been grading you
based on your situation,

1086
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:01,796
and I know this is hard.

1087
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:03,430
I mean, I've been
in high school before.

1088
00:50:03,432 --> 00:50:05,499
It can be very challenging
to navigate,

1089
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,703
but it doesn't benefit you
for you to keep thinking

1090
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,039
that you can be
this straight-A student

1091
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,043
if you're not putting forth
serious effort.

1092
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,649
I think you're capable
of more than you know.

1093
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,785
Come on.

1094
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:26,822
You kicked cancer's butt.

1095
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:30,025
So if there's anything I can do,
I'm happy to help in any way,

1096
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,962
but you gotta let me know.

1097
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:39,603
Hey.

1098
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:42,339
Watch it.

1099
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,877
Thanks so much.

1100
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:58,755
[Kai] That's what you wanted,
to sit in this section?

1101
00:50:58,757 --> 00:51:00,059
- Yeah.
- You want to sit here?

1102
00:51:03,595 --> 00:51:06,096
So, uh, how's the boy thing
going right now?

1103
00:51:06,098 --> 00:51:07,497
You seeing anyone?

1104
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:10,734
- No. I kind of want to...
- Yeah?

1105
00:51:10,736 --> 00:51:11,969
but I'm not with anybody.

1106
00:51:11,971 --> 00:51:13,737
Mm-hmm. How long
have you been single?

1107
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:16,540
- Do you know anyone?
- Um...

1108
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:18,876
[Kai] So are you saying
Australians are good kissers?

1109
00:51:18,878 --> 00:51:19,912
[Zoe]
Yes.

1110
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:25,650
Seth, Seth, are you here?

1111
00:51:25,652 --> 00:51:27,053
[sighs]

1112
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,092
[line ringing]

1113
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,894
Come on. Pick up.
Please pick up.

1114
00:51:35,896 --> 00:51:38,764
- [Seth on recording] Hey, you've reached Seth...
- [groans] Voicemail, okay.

1115
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:40,467
[sighs]

1116
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:15,037
I'm pathetic.

1117
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:22,110
[door closes]

1118
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:24,613
[dramatic theme playing]

1119
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:31,152
Well, where's Sarah?

1120
00:52:31,154 --> 00:52:33,621
- She's already gone.
- What?!

1121
00:52:33,623 --> 00:52:35,223
I'm sorry.
I just mean you missed her.

1122
00:52:35,225 --> 00:52:37,558
She left for a procedure,
but I can't tell you for what.

1123
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,892
- Nurse Joyce, please...
- Ah-ah. As a nurse,

1124
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:40,862
I can't tell you
that information.

1125
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:43,466
I can't tell you that she's
downstairs going into surgery.

1126
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:47,602
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1127
00:52:47,604 --> 00:52:49,204
Don't tell 'em I told you that.

1128
00:52:49,206 --> 00:52:51,105
- This is Helen.
- Where is Sarah?

1129
00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:53,608
Well, she hasn't been responding
to any of my texts.

1130
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,811
She's in recovery.

1131
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:57,579
Wh-Why?

1132
00:52:57,581 --> 00:53:00,117
She's had a pretty delicate
transplant procedure.

1133
00:53:02,752 --> 00:53:04,954
Well, I-I have to see her.

1134
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:06,590
She's resting.

1135
00:53:07,725 --> 00:53:09,892
Well, what can I do?

1136
00:53:09,894 --> 00:53:12,931
Nothing. I have to go.

1137
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,876
[door opens]

1138
00:54:33,081 --> 00:54:34,049
Mom.

1139
00:54:41,656 --> 00:54:42,590
Mom.

1140
00:54:44,293 --> 00:54:45,194
Yeah?

1141
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:49,763
I'm sorry for how
I've been acting lately.

1142
00:54:49,765 --> 00:54:51,333
You've been through so much.

1143
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:56,970
Half of me wants to tell you
that you don't ever

1144
00:54:56,972 --> 00:54:59,675
have to apologize
for anything ever again.

1145
00:55:02,413 --> 00:55:04,247
And the other half?

1146
00:55:05,348 --> 00:55:07,217
You don't want to know.

1147
00:55:11,154 --> 00:55:13,755
I'm gonna fix this.

1148
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:15,125
I promise.

1149
00:55:16,793 --> 00:55:17,894
Okay.

1150
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,834
[school bell rings]

1151
00:55:24,836 --> 00:55:27,035
[Hope]
So my boyfriend is now dating

1152
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:28,437
the most popular girl in school,

1153
00:55:28,439 --> 00:55:30,239
my two best friends hate me,

1154
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:32,274
I'm failing all my classes,

1155
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:34,176
and I'm sitting in a toilet

1156
00:55:34,178 --> 00:55:37,914
where someone definitely
puked before, so that's great.

1157
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:40,149
This is my life now.
No more cupcakes,

1158
00:55:40,151 --> 00:55:42,818
just toilet sandwiches.

1159
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,189
You get used to it.

1160
00:55:45,324 --> 00:55:47,824
Thanks, but, um,

1161
00:55:47,826 --> 00:55:50,893
I don't really
want to get used to it, so...

1162
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:53,130
Are you the girl who's dying?

1163
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:56,766
Yeah... maybe.

1164
00:55:56,768 --> 00:55:58,068
No.

1165
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:00,704
Well, when I was
in the sixth grade,

1166
00:56:00,706 --> 00:56:04,241
I got braces, orthopedic shoes,
scoliosis brace.

1167
00:56:04,243 --> 00:56:06,076
My parents got divorced.

1168
00:56:06,078 --> 00:56:09,380
It was... It was brutal, yeah.

1169
00:56:09,382 --> 00:56:10,915
[laughs]

1170
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:13,019
Okay, I'm coming out.
This is weird.

1171
00:56:17,257 --> 00:56:18,890
Kids can be so mean.

1172
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:21,159
[laughs]
Or nice.

1173
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:23,328
It's just so random,

1174
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:26,066
like cancer or scoliosis.

1175
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,169
Look, I was such a big jerk,

1176
00:56:30,171 --> 00:56:32,004
and I-I should
have stopped them,

1177
00:56:32,006 --> 00:56:35,908
and I didn't, and I'm sorry.

1178
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:37,445
Thanks for that.

1179
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:40,948
But you can't just apologize.

1180
00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:43,449
What do you mean?

1181
00:56:43,451 --> 00:56:44,983
Who cares if you're sorry?

1182
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,852
You have to do something
about it.

1183
00:56:46,854 --> 00:56:50,123
Yeah, you're right.

1184
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:55,828
Well, I go by Mildred,
Millie, with an IE.

1185
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,033
Hope, you know, like Obama.

1186
00:56:59,535 --> 00:57:00,936
Sorry.

1187
00:57:03,972 --> 00:57:06,005
- My mom would love you.
- [laughs]

1188
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:08,409
Gotta sanitize
if you want to fraternize.

1189
00:57:08,411 --> 00:57:10,344
You know what I mean?

1190
00:57:10,346 --> 00:57:12,246
- [laughs]
- That's nice.

1191
00:57:12,248 --> 00:57:13,449
I like that.

1192
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,519
What's this?

1193
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:20,054
- It dries them.
- Oh.

1194
00:57:20,056 --> 00:57:21,357
Gets the small a-goin'.

1195
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:25,193
[both laugh]

1196
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:27,029
[school bell rings]

1197
00:57:29,832 --> 00:57:31,399
I need you to guide me.

1198
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:32,967
[laughs]
The MCATs?

1199
00:57:32,969 --> 00:57:35,170
Yes. I want to be
a pediatric oncologist.

1200
00:57:35,172 --> 00:57:36,938
Are you out of your mind?

1201
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,939
Probably not even
gonna graduate high school.

1202
00:57:38,941 --> 00:57:41,044
Do you have any doubt
I'm down for the impossible?

1203
00:57:42,412 --> 00:57:43,812
I'm not a betting man.

1204
00:57:43,814 --> 00:57:45,581
More of a board game man,
actually.

1205
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:48,084
- Eww.
- But if I was,

1206
00:57:48,086 --> 00:57:51,052
I would definitely bet on you.

1207
