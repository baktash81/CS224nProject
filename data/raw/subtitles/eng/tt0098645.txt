1
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,050
Marie?

2
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,550
Good morning, Crumb & Crumb
Detective Agency. Please hold.

3
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,510
Yes, he'll be with you
in just a minute.

4
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,600
Mr. and Mrs. Downing?

5
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,490
- P.J.
- How are you, Eliot?

6
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,920
Helen.

7
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,450
You okay?

8
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,160
We still haven't heard anything.

9
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,710
Well, it only happened yesterday.

10
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,550
The kidnappers are probably
as scared as you are.

11
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,590
I don't care what they want.
I'll pay anything.

12
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,670
You've alerted the police.

13
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,220
Detective Casey's good, very good.

14
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,760
- We want you.
- Look...

15
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,260
...she's your daughter.

16
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,020
I can understand your wanting
to rely on a private investigator...

17
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,610
...but I simply don't have anyone who
can give it the kind of attention it needs.

18
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,230
It's not what I want to hear, Eliot.

19
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,990
There is one possibility.

20
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,000
- Harry Crumb.
- Who's Harry Crumb?

21
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,870
He is one of them.

22
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,750
First, there was Augustus Crumb,
who founded the agency.

23
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,460
And then there was his son,
Lionel Crumb...

24
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,510
...perhaps the most brilliant detective
of his time.

25
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,680
It was Lionel, God rest his soul,
who entrusted me with the day-to-day...

26
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,930
- ...operations of Crumb & Crumb.
- What about Harry Crumb?

27
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,440
He's Lionel's only offspring.
Pure genius.

28
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,940
He's been on special assignment
in the Midwest.

29
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,530
I have to pull some strings,
but I may be able to convince him.

30
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,950
He's the last in a long line
of great detectives.

31
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,400
He's good, huh?

32
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,490
Oh, he's better than good.
He's a Crumb.

33
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,900
Damn.

34
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,160
Think, think, think.

35
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,130
Yeah. Now I've got you.

36
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,700
Help. Help.

37
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,490
Oh, yeah? If you're not cheating on me,
whose socks are these?

38
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,660
I've never seen those before.

39
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,670
I get the feeling every time
I walk out that door...

40
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,540
...someone's gonna come in here
and take my place.

41
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,710
Sleep in my bed and sit in my chair.

42
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,220
Harry Crumb.

43
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,900
It's for you.

44
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,200
Hi. How you doing?

45
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,250
It's nice to see you.
Nice people, very nice people.

46
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,080
- Morning, Harry.
- Morning, Georgie.

47
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,210
- Any calls yesterday?
- No, Harry.

48
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,660
- How about today?
- Nope.

49
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,970
But you do have a noon appointment
with Mrs. MacIntyre.

50
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,050
- Are the photos back?
- On your desk.

51
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,180
- Satin finish?
- Glossies.

52
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,810
- Damn. Noon appointment, huh?
- That's right.

53
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,430
Hold all my calls.

54
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,200
"One who engages in love affairs
frivolously or casually."

55
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,920
One who engages in love affairs
frivolously or casually.

56
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,560
Yes?

57
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,340
- Yes. Hello? Yes? Yeah? Yes.
- It's Mrs. MacIntyre!

58
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,390
Thank you.

59
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,980
- Send her in.
- Okay, Harry!

60
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,570
Mrs. MacIntyre.

61
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,280
Well, did you or didn't you
get the pictures?

62
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,160
Did I get these pictures?

63
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,790
The tough part is not
getting the pictures.

64
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,630
The tough part is what you see...

65
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,670
...what you learn about people.

66
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,960
Sad things.

67
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,760
Is that tree diseased?

68
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,970
- What are you talking about?
- There is, Mr. Crumb...

69
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,440
...a lot of money riding
on this divorce.

70
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,770
Now, are you gonna show me
those pictures or not?

71
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,900
There's some weird things going on
in these pictures.

72
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,690
Sick things.

73
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,360
That husband of yours...

74
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,870
...he's quite the philodendron.

75
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,290
- Just give me those pictures.
- Sure.

76
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,770
You idiot.

77
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,050
These pictures are of me.

78
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,270
What?

79
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,970
Let me see those.

80
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,770
Not so fast.

81
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,610
I've had my eye on you
for a while, lady.

82
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,650
I knew you were up to something.
Now here's my proof.

83
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,320
It was you having an affair
with your husband.

84
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,170
- What?
- I've uncovered some low schemes...

85
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,000
...but hiring me
to take pornographic pictures...

86
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,730
...of you and your husband
is as low as it gets.

87
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,330
I don't believe this.

88
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,250
Well, believe what you want,
but don't believe it here.

89
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,630
You are a poor excuse
for a human being.

90
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,180
Says you.

91
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,150
Next.

92
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,240
Boy.

93
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,500
- Crumb & Crumb, serving greater Tulsa.
<i>- Crumb there?</i>

94
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,990
- Yes, he is. Who, may I ask, is calling?
<i>- It's Eliot calling.</i>

95
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,120
One moment, please.
It's the home office.

96
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,970
Yes. Yes.

97
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,530
- Cherry?
- No fruit, thank you.

98
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,260
Coke?

99
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,180
No, thank you.

100
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,910
Mix them together,
you got a Cherry Coke.

101
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,170
A Cherry Coke.

102
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,570
Thanks.

103
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,480
What the hell are you doing,
you big idiot? Open your eyes!

104
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,680
I see you've been redecorating.

105
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,190
Well, it's been 10 years, Mr. Crumb.

106
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,020
I guess a lot's changed.

107
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,490
Yes and no.

108
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,070
Would you like a mint?
Got them from the bus station.

109
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,160
They're very good.

110
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,280
No, thanks.

111
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,840
Well, I'll show you to your office,
Mr. Crumb.

112
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,050
Good.

113
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,600
<i>- Mr. Crumb?</i>
- Yes?

114
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,190
<i>Mr. Crumb?</i>

115
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,320
Okay, I'm coming.

116
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,860
<i>Mr. Crumb, are you there?</i>

117
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,200
Mr. Crumb?

118
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,780
- Yes?
- Mr. Draisen will see you now.

119
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,890
Exactly.

120
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,560
I really don't think
you'll run into any trouble.

121
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,800
Just wanted a second opinion.

122
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,680
- Yes?
<i>- It's Harry Crumb.</i>

123
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,050
- Oh, send him in.
- Crumb?

124
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,560
- You mean...
- That's right, the Harry Crumb.

125
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,490
By the shine of your suit,
the cut of your shoes...

126
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,650
...and the look in your eye,
you must be Eliot Draisen.

127
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,610
No, I'm Draisen.

128
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,030
Master of disguises, eh?

129
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,770
Good, very good.

130
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,120
Actually, this is Jeffrey Brandt.
He's one of our top men.

131
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,570
Exactly.

132
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,790
Eliot tells me you share
my love of languages.

133
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,480
Why don't you just check in
with me later, Jeff?

134
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,440
I'll bring Crumb up to speed
on the Downing case.

135
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,360
Crumb, do you know what that is?

136
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,910
- An egg?
- Yeah. Yeah.

137
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,160
Yeah. Well, what kind of egg?

138
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,570
- Bird egg?
- No. No. No. It's a pterodactyl egg.

139
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,460
It's fossilised.

140
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,010
It's 90 million years old.

141
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,550
In the entire world, only two of these
have ever been found.

142
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,720
You know, that may be
worth something.

143
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,350
- That thought had crossed my mind.
- We think a lot alike.

144
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,270
I like a man who thinks like me.

145
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,820
Did you bring your copy
of the Downing file?

146
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,280
No need to.
I've committed it to memory.

147
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,240
At 10:45, on the morning of June 11,
it was discovered...

148
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,200
...that Jennifer Downing
was abducted from Room 3 at Suki's...

149
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,580
...1225 North Rodeo Drive.

150
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,620
Her assailant chloroformed
Ms. Downing's attendant...

151
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,670
...one Marie Cannell, and it's suspected,
did the same to Ms. Downing.

152
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,520
A laundry cart was found
in the rear parking lot.

153
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,630
Traces of chloroform were present.

154
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,140
This, no doubt,
was their means of escape.

155
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,100
Still one thing puzzles me.

156
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,730
There was not one single mention
of the stolen jewels.

157
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,190
There aren't any jewels.
This is a kidnapping.

158
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,150
Just kidding.

159
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,150
I gotta go.

160
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,080
<i>- Hello?</i>
- How's our girl?

161
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,840
Oh, she's nice, Mr. D, real nice.

162
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,090
<i>I had to tell you one thing, Dwayne.</i>
<i>We're in better shape than we thought.</i>

163
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,310
Yeah?

164
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,760
<i>- That guy Crumb I told you about?</i>
- Yeah?

165
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,260
<i>I was right.</i>
<i>The man's a complete and utter idiot.</i>

166
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,100
This is excellent.

167
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,770
This is just plain
old-fashioned excellent.

168
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,060
Would you mind taking your free hand
off the doorbell?

169
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,940
Sorry. Bit of an accident.

170
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,070
- You Crumb?
- You know who I am.

171
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,230
That's right. Your cover's blown.

172
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,980
- My dad's upstairs.
- So you'd have me believe...

173
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,490
...you're P.J. Downing's
daughter, huh?

174
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,120
Impossible.

175
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,860
I happen to know
that P.J. Downing's daughter...

176
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,620
...was kidnapped
not more than 72 hours ago.

177
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,460
I'm Nikki, the other daughter.

178
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,200
Of course you are.
It's just that I was told...

179
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,760
...that P.J. Downing's daughter
was a beautiful young woman...

180
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,100
...so I momentarily
mistook her for you.

181
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,600
What a schmooze.

182
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,820
Yes, it is Jennifer Downing
I'm here to find.

183
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,020
And find her...

184
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,570
...I will.

185
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,940
You get paid for this?

186
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,870
- Usually, yeah.
- Mr. Crumb...

187
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,110
...so nice to meet you.

188
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,320
- And you must be...
- Helen Downing.

189
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,830
And then some.

190
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,370
Off to play tennis again?

191
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,340
As you can imagine,
these are trying times.

192
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,750
We do what we can
to get through them.

193
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,170
But we don't have to enjoy it.

194
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,850
Kids.

195
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,270
Bitch.

196
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,270
I think it's time I see your father now.

197
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,030
Hey, Dad!

198
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,020
Mr. Downing?

199
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,320
Harry Crumb. It's nice to...

200
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,160
Oh, please, sit down.
Continue what you're doing.

201
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,790
Thank you.

202
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,490
Ordinarily, this is one
of my great pleasures.

203
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,250
Today, it's just a way
to keep my mind off Jennifer.

204
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,710
A sad situation.
Kidnappings always are.

205
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,670
But they are less sad to me...

206
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,300
...because I have yet to meet
a kidnapper I could not outwit.

207
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,590
Eliot Draisen says you're the best.

208
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,310
Indeed. He sounds like a smart man.

209
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,220
I'd like to meet him someday.

210
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,780
Didn't he send you here?

211
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,550
Exactly.

212
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,770
- Isn't that a marabou muddler?
- Why, yes, it is.

213
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,570
- Are you a fly-fisherman?
- Fishing is my life.

214
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,200
There's a feeling
between man and fish...

215
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,910
...a bond...

216
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:57,120
...an intimate connection
between fish and fisherman.

217
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,710
A special understanding.

218
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,090
You know, the whole fish-man thing.

219
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,390
I was thinking this morning
about the kidnappers.

220
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,850
About how much more respect...

221
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,560
...a sportsman has for his quarry.

222
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,280
Exactly.

223
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,410
I'd do anything to get her back.

224
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,880
Money means nothing, Mr. Crumb,
when it comes to your own child.

225
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,970
Yes, I met Nikki on the way in.

226
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,560
Nikki? Oh, yes, she's wonderful,
but Jennifer was my first little girl.

227
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,650
- Nice fish.
- Thank you.

228
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,400
Very big.

229
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,940
And what have we here? Well....

230
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,620
A real beauty.

231
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,200
You certainly know your bamboo.

232
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,410
Bamboo is my business.

233
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,530
And it's my business to know
what no one else wants to know.

234
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,170
That is the very business I'm in.

235
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,060
- You all right, Mr. Crumb?
- Yes, I'm fine.

236
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,900
The girl's mother,
how is she holding up?

237
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,490
Oh, she's their stepmother, actually.

238
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:57,330
We married a couple of years ago
in a moment of weakness, perhaps.

239
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,160
She's an attractive woman...

240
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,000
...a very attractive woman,
but to tell you the truth, Mr. Crumb...

241
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,740
...she and the girls
have never been that close.

242
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,710
- You know how it is.
- Yes.

243
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,890
I know the score of that game:
40-Love.

244
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,920
- Excuse me?
- I was just thinking, Mr. Downing...

245
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:23,390
...I must become more familiar
with these kidnappers.

246
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:28,320
I must understand them.

247
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,110
I must think like them.

248
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,480
I must go to the scene of the crime.

249
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,170
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good day.

250
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,520
We'll see you then. Bye-bye.

251
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,770
I'm sorry.
What did you say your name was?

252
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,520
I am Deszu Djizlas.

253
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,660
- Could you spell that please?
- I don't think so. Try it with a D.

254
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,370
- You're from New York?
- No, I work in New York.

255
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,500
- I am from Budapest.
- Oh, Hungary.

256
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,340
No, thank you.
I had a falafel before I got here.

257
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,500
I'm sorry,
that's not what I meant.

258
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,540
- Mr. D...
- Djizlas.

259
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,710
- I'm Dennis Kimball.
- Dennis Kimball.

260
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,420
Yes. I just heard
this morning you were coming.

261
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,930
Yes. Well, I'm here.

262
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,350
- This is our vice president of operations.
- Quality control.

263
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,560
Yes, something that's very important
to us here.

264
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,980
So you say.

265
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,650
Move it, Kimball. Come on.
Move, move, move, Dennis.

266
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,150
So, what have we here?

267
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,360
Too tight.

268
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,580
Too loose.

269
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,580
Too foofy.

270
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,000
- You don't like what you see?
- Only I am the judge of that.

271
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,130
- Of course.
- Of course.

272
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,310
The full-body mud pack is
one of our most popular treatments.

273
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,140
It tightens the pores
and rejuvenates the dermis.

274
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
Indulge me. I will be you.

275
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,570
You will be the intruder. Show to me
exactly how it happened, please.

276
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,990
Well, he must've been standing here,
just in back of me.

277
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,490
And you were applying
the mud like so.

278
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,910
He didn't make a sound.

279
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,710
- And you were leaning over like this:
- Yes, that's correct.

280
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,640
And suddenly he leapt out at me.

281
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,340
So it was not as easy as you said.

282
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,590
But you knew what I was doing.
And you... That's funny.

283
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,430
You look different somehow.

284
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,220
Maybe your eyes
are playing tricks on me.

285
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,020
Playing tricks on me.

286
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,740
So you always give Miss Downing
her mud pack?

287
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,070
- Well, no, it was her first time.
- Oh, really? Really, huh?

288
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,120
Like she doesn't have
a regular weekly appointment...

289
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,950
...is that what you're saying?

290
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,790
No, that was her mother, Helen,
it was Mrs. Downing's regular time.

291
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,080
Of course.

292
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,000
She had given to her daughter
her regular appointment.

293
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,380
I guess she did.

294
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,390
So one could say
that Mrs. Downing knew precisely...

295
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,350
...where her daughter would be
that day.

296
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,520
A sneaky player.

297
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,950
Very good. Very good. Okay.

298
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,840
- They won't really kill her, will they?
- Of course not.

299
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,750
That's why Mr. Crumb's here.

300
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,440
God.

301
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,610
Great.

302
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,400
I'll see you later.

303
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,940
Helen should know about this.

304
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,170
Tim. Do you know
where Mrs. Downing is?

305
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,830
Well, what happens if I do?

306
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,210
That's all right. I'll find her.

307
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,750
Thank you, God.

308
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,960
Thank you, Eliot.
She's probably down by the stables.

309
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,470
Yes, thank you, Eliot.

310
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,730
Good man.

311
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,470
What do you think, Harry?

312
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,600
One size fits all.
Who are they kidding?

313
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,320
- Would you mind?
- No, of course not.

314
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,040
Detective Casey.
I'd like you to meet Harry Crumb.

315
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,470
- I know you by reputation.
- My reputation precedes me.

316
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,010
Otherwise, I'd be late
for all my appointments.

317
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,390
Harry Crumb.

318
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,560
You know, Mr. Downing...

319
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,480
...I have a lot of experience
in these matters...

320
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,570
...and over the years, I've developed
a theory about private detectives.

321
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,820
They're slime,
and without exception...

322
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,450
...they are lazy, stupid,
cowardly, arrogant...

323
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,460
...and thoroughly incompetent.

324
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,000
It's just a theory.

325
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,790
There it is.

326
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,340
And make sure
the lab has the number here...

327
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,670
...in case they come up
with anything.

328
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,340
You can have your lab inspect
this note as much as you want...

329
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,260
...but they may never discover
what I already know.

330
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,480
And what is that, Mr. Crumb?

331
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,650
You find that crazy typewriter,
and you'll have your kidnappers.

332
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,490
The ransom note arrived.

333
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,950
They want 10 million.

334
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,880
My God.

335
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,540
They'll suck him dry.

336
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,340
He wants to see you.

337
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,930
- Helen. Listen, I know you're not happy.
- Eliot?

338
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,680
- Oh, my God. Really? Stop it.
- I can make you happy. You know me.

339
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,890
You make me sick.

340
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,110
- Haven't changed since night school.
- I loved you then, and I still do.

341
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,490
I'll tell you what, Eliot.

342
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,200
Back then, dinner and a movie might've
gotten you into some girl's panties...

343
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,450
...but it's going to take a lot more
than that to get into mine.

344
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,300
What do you want?

345
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,230
Don't you know, Eliot?

346
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,690
Money.

347
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,860
Lots of money.

348
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,150
I'm working on it.

349
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,440
You see, P.J., I believe
that there's the criminal body...

350
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,240
...and the criminal mind.

351
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,990
Each are separate from each other
in that the criminal body...

352
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,870
...although it's a criminal,
doesn't know exactly what it's doing...

353
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,800
...will commit the crime,
unwittingly, if you will.

354
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,340
The criminal mind knows exactly
what it's doing.

355
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,760
A mind that is brazen, yet cowardly.

356
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,470
Nimble, yet clumsy.
Cunning, yet naive.

357
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,930
- Zealous...
- Would you get to the point?

358
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,190
You first.

359
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,190
It makes me wonder if the
criminal mind is actually human at all.

360
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,410
I believe that there's a reason
mankind has been lifted...

361
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,650
...beyond the level of the animals.

362
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,450
Human nature
is man's greatest triumph...

363
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,500
...but also the source of his undoing.

364
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,290
We all aspire
to our noblest instincts...

365
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,710
...and yet, all too often,
we indulge our basest desires.

366
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,300
Just like those animals
that took our Jennifer.

367
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,510
Yes. They're animals all right.

368
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,720
But have no fear.

369
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,310
The kidnappers
will not harm your daughter...

370
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:31,190
...not while I'm nipping at their heels.

371
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,570
Do you think
that these people imagine...

372
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,450
...that they are going to get
what they want?

373
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,950
I wonder if it's ever occurred
to Mr. Crumb...

374
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,210
...that there may be things going on
of which he is totally...

375
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,500
...perhaps blissfully, unaware.

376
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,010
Unfortunately, people don't always
do what we expect them to.

377
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,940
Not criminals. Not anyone.

378
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,390
Mr. Draisen.

379
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,970
I don't know what you thought...

380
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,280
...but I would hope you could
keep things on a professional level.

381
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,860
- What?
- Please. These things...

382
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,280
...can be so easily misinterpreted.

383
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,030
I think this is a good time for coffee.

384
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:22,630
Oh, great. Now I suppose
everyone will want some.

385
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,440
Oh, jeez, I hope that wasn't
as old as it looked.

386
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,870
Sorry.

387
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,240
Hello, Nikki.

388
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,250
You mind if I look around?

389
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,410
Thank you.

390
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,790
It's no wonder they took her, huh?

391
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,370
Do you know that
when she was 14 years old...

392
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,390
...she was so skinny
that she had everybody worried.

393
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,300
She looked like a newt.

394
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,010
And now, I mean, just look at her.

395
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,380
She's perfect.

396
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,110
Perfect?

397
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,600
Gee, I don't know.
I mean, look at the size of her head.

398
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,100
She must be enormous.

399
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,980
Be easy to find...

400
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,870
...because she's huge.

401
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,120
- Lecithin.
- Lecithin.

402
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,870
Scrod oil.

403
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,040
Crumb.

404
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,260
Scrod oil?

405
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,920
Improves slow-twitch
muscle response.

406
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,500
I always thought
pancakes were good for that.

407
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,670
Jennifer taught me how to make this.

408
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,840
She tells me that's what gives her
that amazing figure.

409
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,220
Your mileage may vary.

410
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,100
You know, it would appear
your mother is...

411
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,140
- She's not my mother.
- Okay.

412
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,310
All she wants is Dad's money. Money
and sex. She's a nympho, you know.

413
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,730
- Nympho.
- She's gotta have it constantly.

414
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,530
Four or five times a day.

415
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,270
Nympho. Nympho. Nym...

416
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,530
- Nympho.
- That's why she's going out...

417
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,830
...with that scumball, Vince.

418
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,370
What a sleaze.

419
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,800
It would appear that your stepmother
presents something of a puzzle to me.

420
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,460
And I thought maybe you'd like
to lend a hand.

421
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,880
- Like what, spying?
- No, not like spying.

422
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,380
More like perception
or observation or...

423
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,010
- Like spying.
- Like spying, yes.

424
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,310
I just wish they would've kidnapped
the old cow instead.

425
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,140
Well, the truth is, Nikki, the kidnappers
had a very good reason...

426
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,860
- ...not to take your stepmother.
- What's that?

427
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,940
One cannot kidnap oneself.

428
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,240
I wish we could hear
what they were saying.

429
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,830
No need to hear. I've been trained
in the art of reading lips.

430
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,920
Every word they say, I see.

431
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:22,260
Goddamn it, Vince,
I am suffering here.

432
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,760
It's taken me two years
to get him to write me into the will.

433
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,970
We spend six months
coming up with a plan to kill him...

434
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,430
...and what's it come to? Kidnappers are
gonna walk away with the whole thing.

435
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,360
- Don't get so creamed.
- If we don't kill him now...

436
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,570
...he is gonna pay
those bastards every penny they want.

437
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,150
There'll be nothing left.
The house, the cars, the stocks.

438
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,200
That's my money.

439
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,160
Our money.

440
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,070
Look, we can get
into his car whenever you want.

441
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,500
You wanna do it tonight,
we'll do it tonight, okay?

442
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,710
Tonight?

443
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,430
Well, did they do it or not?

444
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,760
They're the kidnappers all right. We've
got them right where we want them.

445
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,590
What do you mean? We have no idea
where they're keeping Jennifer.

446
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,850
One thing we can be thankful for is...

447
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,780
...that they assigned that idiot Crumb
to the case.

448
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,350
You don't think
he suspects anything, do you?

449
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:21,230
No, I think he suspects he has a dick,
but he'd need a road map to find it.

450
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,820
Well, I don't mean to be boastful...

451
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,040
...but they're discussing my prowess
as a private dick.

452
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,590
Crumb!

453
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,330
Crumb, are you okay?

454
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,720
Don't worry, Nikki.
I've got a firm grip.

455
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,640
Everything will be just fine.

456
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,520
Crumb!

457
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,300
Kid, where you going?

458
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,100
No. No.

459
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,580
Hey.

460
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,790
I thought you said you could do this
with your eyes closed.

461
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,530
- Shit.
- What now?

462
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:47,130
I just paid 34.50 for this shirt,
and that's with my pro-shop discount.

463
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,800
Vincent, I hate it
when you talk cheap.

464
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,350
Is that it?

465
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,720
No brakes at all?

466
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,690
Better. Pressure's good for regular
driving, but once they hit the hills:

467
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,310
No more Freddy the Fisherman.

468
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,160
You bet.

469
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,700
Stop.

470
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,900
I like you dirty.

471
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,220
Yeah.

472
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,390
Say something sexy, you animal.

473
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,720
Gotta check in with the mister.

474
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,320
He cares about you
almost as much as I do.

475
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,240
<i>- Hello?</i>
- How we doing, boss man?

476
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,660
<i>Fine. Getting along</i>
<i>with your house guest?</i>

477
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,910
Oh, yeah.

478
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,700
She's a little shy,
but I can tell she likes me.

479
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,660
You'll get your chance.

480
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,080
Control yourself till the cheque's
in the mail, so to speak.

481
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,880
<i>- Damn it, Draisen, you said...</i>
- Dwayne, you'll get what you want...

482
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,510
...when I get what I want,
understood?

483
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,840
<i>- All right, I'll put my magic on hold.</i>
- Sorry, sorry.

484
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,350
Yeah. Just stay there
till Dobson gets there. Right.

485
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,850
I have identified the kidnapper.

486
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:33,320
- Do tell.
- Brace yourself, Eliot.

487
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,740
You may find this
very hard to believe...

488
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:40,530
...but the kidnapper
is none other than...

489
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,960
...Helen Downing.

490
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,040
That does come
as a surprise to me.

491
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,210
I thought it would.

492
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,550
But that is why you hired me
in the first place, isn't it?

493
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,840
You're right about that.

494
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,680
You wanna hear some more?

495
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,100
Helen Downing is having an affair.

496
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:07,810
She what?

497
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,650
She's doing the bad thing
with Vince Barnes...

498
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,580
...that two-bit country-club Romeo.

499
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,780
Our little Helen
is not only a kidnapper...

500
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,360
...she's a slut.

501
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,790
I thought you'd find that funny.

502
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,680
Oh, God. From now on,
I'm gonna keep a close eye...

503
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,000
...on our Mrs. Downing
and that strapping stud of hers.

504
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,380
You really are incredible, Crumb.

505
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,630
I mean, just the way
that you handle yourself.

506
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,970
God forbid anything dangerous
should happen.

507
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,640
Dangerous?

508
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:52,160
Dangerous? Eliot, I've got a black belt
in aikido and the boots to match.

509
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,620
Touchdown.

510
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,020
We'll be taking
the canyon drive today, Mr. Downing?

511
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,430
Yes, I can't stand this waiting around,
Henry, sitting in the house.

512
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,270
I thought, perhaps,
a drive alone might help.

513
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,400
Let's go.
I think it'd be better if I'm not here.

514
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,120
Nice car.

515
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,610
I don't believe it.

516
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:51,150
A 1936 supercharged
Auburn 851 Speedster...

517
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,920
...with Lycoming double overhead
cams, and in cherry condition.

518
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,130
You're certainly a font of knowledge,
Mr. Crumb.

519
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,920
I'm fond of many things,
Mr. Downing.

520
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:04,680
And one of them is keeping an eye
on my quarry.

521
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,360
I can just see him now,
hanging on to that wheel...

522
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,980
...listening to Mozart,
heading down that canyon.

523
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,230
He's gonna die a happy man.

524
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,540
The whole trick to tailing
a suspect is anticipation.

525
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,170
Anticipation, perseverance
and inconspicuousness.

526
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,420
You make this stuff up
as you go along?

527
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,090
Not at all.
I've been so thoroughly trained...

528
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,680
...I don't even have to think
before I speak.

529
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:49,560
So tell me, what's it like, I mean, you
know, being a great detective and all?

530
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,180
Well, my modesty
prohibits me saying.

531
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,570
However, I can tell you what it's like
coming from a long line of detectives.

532
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,110
It was a very, very, very...

533
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,730
...big pain in the butt,
that's what it was.

534
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:06,410
- Oh, same old family crap, huh?
- Yeah. You know, Nikki...

535
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,900
...I'm not like those other Crumbs.

536
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,760
I'm my own Crumb.
You know what I mean?

537
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,040
But it's different with Jennifer.

538
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,880
I mean, she's so good at everything,
and she's so beautiful.

539
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,090
Not that I'm jealous or anything.

540
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,590
Perhaps Jennifer
should be the jealous one.

541
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,140
I have this feeling.

542
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,060
- You mean that he's dead?
- Do you think so?

543
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,610
To tell you the truth...

544
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,900
...there's a way in which you and I
are very much alike.

545
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,480
We're both travelling through life...

546
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,700
...in a car with no brakes.

547
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,720
Crumb.

548
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,430
Oh, no.

549
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,230
No.

550
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:11,010
Hey, watch it!

551
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,260
- My God.
- It's Crumb.

552
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,780
- For chrissake, can't you lose him?
- This guy's on me like glue.

553
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,240
Hey, what happened
to inconspicuous?

554
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,700
Not now, my little health shake.

555
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,330
He's good, really good.

556
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,380
Can't you control this thing?

557
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,910
Let's see. "Runaway vehicle.
Step number one: Remain calm.

558
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,000
Step number two: Feather the brakes
with a light pumping motion."

559
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,250
That makes sense.

560
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,270
- Holy shit, that was dangerous.
- Danger?

561
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,650
Danger's my middle name.

562
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,690
I'm sure of it, Nikki.
It was no accident.

563
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:53,490
The brakes on your father's car
were deliberately tampered with.

564
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,910
The one thing that puzzles me
is how the kidnappers knew...

565
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,760
...that I would be driving P.J.'s car.

566
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,620
That Vince Barnes,
he's craftier than I thought.

567
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,290
Oh, come on, Harry, he's an idiot.

568
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:10,410
A book cover is only skin-deep.

569
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,510
Sometimes you have to read
every word to get the whole picture.

570
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:18,010
I think it's time we paid
Mr. Vince Barnes a little visit.

571
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,310
Mr. Crumb, I have news.

572
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:23,640
My mechanic says the brake fluid
was deliberately drained.

573
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,730
Harry already
figured that out, Dad.

574
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,660
The kidnappers have made
one fatal mistake.

575
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,690
- What's that, Mr. Crumb?
- They're making me mad.

576
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,070
Dad, we're gonna set up
a surveillance operation.

577
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,250
I'm sure Mr. Crumb doesn't need you
interfering with his work.

578
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,790
On the contrary, P.J.,
Nikki's been invaluable to me.

579
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,210
I'm sure she means
to be helpful, but...

580
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,250
No "buts" about it.
Nikki has given me information...

581
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:54,590
...I couldn't have gotten on my own.
You shouldn't underestimate her.

582
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,710
Yes. Well, I'll take that
into consideration.

583
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,730
You're an insightful man, Mr. Crumb.
A man of many talents.

584
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,650
It's a burden, yes,
but one that I can live with.

585
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,630
Oh, there we are.
There we are right here.

586
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,670
Good, good, good.
Vince Barnes. Vince Barnes.

587
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,510
Vince Barnes, number nine.
Good, good, good.

588
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,760
Very good.
That is very good to know.

589
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,850
Very good. Oh, no.

590
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,650
Right, right.
Combination, combination.

591
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,820
That's it. Left, right, left, right.

592
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,860
Come on,
throw him, throw him, throw him.

593
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:03,910
Oh, boy. A thousand apologies for
my face hitting your fisticuffs, <i>sahib.</i>

594
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:07,620
- Who are you?
- I am Vijay. Vijay from Bombay.

595
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,500
Bombay Air Conditioning.

596
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,040
Let me present you with my card.

597
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,630
When the going gets hot,
the hot get air conditioning.

598
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:18,650
- It's a cute slogan, wouldn't you say?
- Beat it.

599
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,300
Perhaps later.
Now I will fix your air conditioning.

600
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,180
- Now listen, Tonto.
- Tonto?

601
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:27,100
I don't know if you speak American,
but I'm just gonna say this once:

602
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,310
Nobody told me nothing
about no air-conditioning repair.

603
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:33,820
I don't know anything about that.
But what I do know is this:

604
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:37,360
That the people of this building
are very, very hot right now.

605
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,780
They are sweaty and disgusting.

606
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,780
They are all blaming you.

607
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,530
- Me?
- Oh, yes.

608
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,580
I've even heard them say
they're talking about your dismissal.

609
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,670
Well, what are you
standing around for? Get.

610
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,170
- Come on, get your butt up there.
- All right, I'm moving.

611
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,100
I still don't understand
why Crumb was in that car.

612
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,970
- P.J. should've been dead by now.
- Shut up.

613
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:07,850
Just think of another way
to kill him and pour me a drink.

614
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,580
I got it.
Look, Vince's apartment is right here...

615
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,750
...and the ventilator shaft runs
right alongside of it.

616
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,180
Right.

617
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,980
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello, Mr. Barnes.

618
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,270
- Yeah?
<i>- You're late.</i>

619
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,610
- What?
<i>- Tennis lesson.</i>

620
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:59,400
- You mean right now?
<i>- That's right. I'm waiting.</i>

621
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,620
Okay.

622
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,280
Who was that?

623
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,240
- It's the club. I got a lesson.
- Now?

624
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,980
Hey, babe, I'll be back in an hour.

625
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,750
Just like a doctor, always on call.

626
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,680
God help us.

627
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,680
<i>How you doing, Harry?</i>

628
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,140
The things I do for money.

629
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:31,680
Okay, listen, you're almost there.
About another 15 feet up on your left.

630
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,020
It's not too far.

631
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,270
That's easy for you to say.

632
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,700
What's the matter, big boy?
Just couldn't stay away?

633
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,540
Eliot.

634
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:50,410
What the hell are you doing here?

635
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,830
I might ask you the same thing.

636
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,460
Classy.

637
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:03,470
- You can't just barge in here.
- Better me than your husband.

638
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:12,520
Number 9. I'm here.

639
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,440
Damn. The vent's too high.
I can barely see.

640
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:21,360
This is very low,
blackmailing me for sexual favours.

641
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,700
But what the hell.
Just give me a minute.

642
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,260
<i>Hell, in our own hacienda.</i>

643
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,470
<i>With servants?</i>

644
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,200
<i>Servants and seascapes</i>
<i>and champagne wishes.</i>

645
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,460
<i>And caviar dreams.</i>

646
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,880
<i>With my brains and your brown eyes,</i>
<i>we're going places. Big places.</i>

647
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:49,190
<i>We'll get the loot, go to the airport.</i>
<i>Got tickets booked under a false name.</i>

648
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,510
<i>- There's no coming back.</i>
- This is great.

649
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,350
They're giving away everything.

650
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:56,600
Yeah, it's like taking candy
from a baby.

651
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,110
<i>- But what about the girl?</i>
<i>- Forget the girl.</i>

652
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,950
<i>We don't need her anymore.</i>
<i>Not where we're going.</i>

653
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,490
<i>- You mean...</i>
<i>- That's right, baby. Buenos Aires.</i>

654
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,240
- Buenos Aires.
- Buenos Aires, is it?

655
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,370
- Great.
<i>- You sure you can handle it?</i>

656
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,830
<i>I can handle it.</i>
<i>I can handle anything.</i>

657
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,390
Helen? Helen?

658
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,680
If I were rich,
would you think differently of me?

659
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:31,760
What kind of girl do you think I am?

660
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,770
Of course I would.

661
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,990
Good.

662
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,320
<i>Hold me. Touch me.</i>
<i>Kiss me, you mad fool.</i>

663
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:46,110
<i>You make me feel</i>
<i>like a woman again.</i>

664
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,240
What is going on in there?

665
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,170
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Sounds like things are getting mushy.</i>

666
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,870
- Stop. Stop.
- What?

667
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:57,500
- It's too hot.
- What?

668
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:00,290
Turn on the air conditioner.
It's too hot.

669
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,670
<i>I can't wait, my darling.</i>

670
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:06,920
<i>I get the feeling like there ain't nobody</i>
<i>in this crazy, mixed-up world...</i>

671
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,510
<i>...who can stop us now. No one.</i>

672
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,390
It's just dribbling out.

673
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,470
It's a little nippy in here.

674
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:20,110
- What kind of cheap place is this?
<i>- Well, it's happening right now.</i>

675
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:37,040
Eliot. It's probably just clogged.
Just put it on exhaust.

676
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,710
What a piece of junk.

677
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,310
What the...?

678
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,560
Stick him. Move. That's it.
Up, down, up...

679
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,440
All right. My lucky day.

680
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:26,380
Move. Sucker punch. Sucker punch!

681
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,090
More coins!

682
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,680
All right, come on. Come to Daddy.

683
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:35,420
Come on. Jackpot!

684
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:43,310
<i>And Kelly is the winner</i>
<i>at 1:29 in the 11th round.</i>

685
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,520
<i>Tom "The Maniac" Kelly....</i>

686
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,250
Shit.

687
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,780
Vince, you are not listening.
They want the money on Friday.

688
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,450
<i>- Friday.</i>
- This Friday.

689
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,160
I can buy us a little time,
but we have to kill him this weekend.

690
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,890
<i>Helen, you don't understand.</i>

691
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,250
<i>If they don't get their money</i>
<i>on Friday, they might kill her.</i>

692
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:52,170
Don't be such a putz, Vince.

693
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,760
You make an omelette,
you break a few eggs.

694
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:59,800
Just be there tonight,
you big hunk of meat.

695
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:13,190
Eliot, I have something to show you.

696
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:15,150
- You do?
- Yes.

697
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:18,490
As a result of my clandestine
photo operation...

698
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:22,580
...I have photographic prints
showing Helen Downing...

699
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:27,540
...and Vince Barnes in the midst
of their humping activity.

700
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,630
- And you want me to see them?
- Of course.

701
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,840
I'm always interested
in your professional opinion.

702
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,260
Say, is that a dog?

703
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,930
Why don't we just discuss this
in your office?

704
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,300
As you wish.

705
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,810
Come on in, Eliot.
Make yourself to home.

706
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:50,440
I took these yesterday.
I had the lab put a rush on them.

707
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,480
Go ahead. Have a look-see.

708
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:58,280
You were photographing
Vince Barnes' apartment yesterday?

709
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,130
Exactly.

710
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,680
You haven't looked at these,
have you?

711
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:24,190
No. I was there.

712
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,980
I mean, you'd think an athletic guy
like Vince Barnes...

713
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,270
...would have a big dingus,
you know?

714
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:35,070
But no, take a look
at that pathetic little...

715
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,280
...fallacy.

716
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,950
You don't know anything
about this kidnapping.

717
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:45,670
Quite the contrary, Eliot.

718
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,400
The kidnappers are so unnerved
by my presence...

719
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:51,120
...they've had to change
their plans midstream.

720
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,670
What are you talking about?

721
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,420
See for yourself.

722
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,970
They had to push back the ransom drop
from Friday till Monday.

723
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,140
- No, no. This is wrong.
- No, it's perfect.

724
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:04,930
Perfect.

725
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,520
I believe, Eliot...

726
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:11,480
...in fact, I know,
that at this very moment...

727
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:15,270
...the kidnappers are in pain,
mental torment...

728
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:18,230
...trying to figure out my next move.

729
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:21,610
There's only one thing
I don't know, Eliot.

730
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:24,030
What this lever does.

731
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:27,240
I don't know. Maybe it's a brake.

732
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:32,580
Come on, Eliot. What kind of
stationary bike has a brake?

733
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,030
You know, Eliot, you were right.

734
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,280
That was a brake.

735
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:05,910
Go figure, huh?

736
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,980
All there.

737
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,600
All there.

738
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,030
- One short.
- Oh, please.

739
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:49,120
I hope you're not actually paying
this clown for his so-called services.

740
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:52,290
"So-called"?
See for yourself, butch.

741
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:59,590
Ninety-five, 96, 97, 98....

742
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,510
- Ninety-nine.
- Amazing.

743
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,610
Tim.

744
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:13,270
All right.

745
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:26,530
Right on time. Eliot.

746
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,290
- Hello.
- This is Jennifer.

747
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:36,960
They want the money today.

748
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,880
- Today instead of Monday?
<i>- That's right.</i>

749
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:44,210
<i>Put the money in a suitcase</i>
<i>and go to the racetrack at noon...</i>

750
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:47,430
<i>...then wait by the phone</i>
<i>next to the jockeys' entrance.</i>

751
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,150
And no police...

752
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,930
<i>...or they'll kill me.</i>

753
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:55,240
Okay, Jennifer. Just relax.
Everything's gonna be fi...

754
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,020
Jennifer? Jennifer?

755
01:04:58,450 --> 01:04:59,990
Jennifer.

756
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,990
- Too short to get a trace.
- Exactly.

757
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,130
Very nice.

758
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:17,080
I'd say you got at least
a fifty-fifty chance of living.

759
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:20,860
And good news...

760
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,540
...we're going to the airport.

761
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:28,010
As long as we
keep track of the money...

762
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,850
...we know where the kidnappers are.

763
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:37,390
This gives us a range
of up to three miles.

764
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:41,270
There is no way they'll be aware
of police presence.

765
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,690
Sounds peachy.

766
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,610
Mr. Crumb?

767
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,200
Sounds okay to me.

768
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,240
As long as the police
stay completely out of sight...

769
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,800
...and out of my way.

770
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:03,790
When this is all over, Crumb...

771
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:07,210
...I'm gonna rip your heart out
and eat it for breakfast.

772
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,550
Take a number.

773
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,290
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Vince.

774
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,440
<i>- Yeah, babe.</i>
- We've got a problem.

775
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:53,310
Hello, Susie? My name is Angel.

776
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,760
I'm a friend of Miguel.

777
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,280
- Hello?
- Crumb?

778
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:13,070
- Yes?
- Give the money to Draisen.

779
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,710
Pardon?

780
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,540
Give the money to Eliot Draisen.

781
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:22,620
- Who?
- Eliot Draisen.

782
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,710
<i>- Eliot Draisen?</i>
- Give him the money.

783
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,960
<i>You want me to give the money</i>
<i>to Eliot Draisen?</i>

784
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,840
Hello? Hello? Kidnapper?

785
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:35,590
I can barely here you. Hello, man.

786
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:37,600
Speak up, for God's sake.

787
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:40,560
Use your voice. Hello?

788
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:44,390
We have a faulty connection.
I'm on a jockey phone.

789
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,770
- I'm on the phone.
- Crumb.

790
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:49,900
- Eliot?
- I'm on the phone with the kidnappers.

791
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,830
I guess I'm supposed
to take it from here.

792
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,950
So, yeah, just help me, okay?

793
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,490
That's my pants. All right.

794
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:01,700
- Hold there. Wait a minute.
- Crumb.

795
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,660
- Yeah?
- Breathe in.

796
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:10,810
Eliot.

797
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:15,620
Bye, Harry Crumb.

798
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,220
- What now?
- Who said that?

799
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,690
It's Nikki.
I thought you might need me.

800
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:29,110
- What do we do now?
- Now we sit tight.

801
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:33,530
There's no point in following their path,
because we know where they're going.

802
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,460
The flight to Buenos Aires
doesn't leave till 4:00.

803
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:40,200
We've got all the time in the world.

804
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:44,910
And I think we're gonna need it.
I think I'm stuck.

805
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:47,370
I know I'm stuck.

806
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:59,720
Let's go.

807
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:29,050
Shit. What the hell was that?

808
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:44,680
- You're losing him.
- He's right there.

809
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:47,690
Will you let me handle it?
We gotta get the money...

810
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:50,530
- ...before the kidnappers do.
- Vin, just get it.

811
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,660
What do you think he's doing?

812
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,170
Do I look like Mr. Frigging Wizard?

813
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:16,550
He's doing whatever the hell
the kidnappers told him to do.

814
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,770
You idiot.

815
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:07,610
One, two, three.

816

Well, we've still
got each other, babe.

822
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:06,410
- Yeah?
- Hello. Helen?

823
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:08,950
Who is this?

824
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,950
What the hell do you want, Eliot?

825
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:16,550
You what?

826
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:21,550
You kidnapped her?

827
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:27,930
Buenos Aires?

828
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,780
Well, of course I'm coming.
I'm out the door, you cute little man.

829
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:41,650
This jacket's too tight. It was those
motel dry cleaners, they shrunk it.

830
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:44,610
Yeah, right. Says you.

831
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,470
Eliot?

832
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,390
Helen.

833
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,440
Is that the money?

834
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,760
Ten million?

835
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:17,780
You know, Eliot, I have a little
confession of my own to make.

836
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:18,990
What?

837
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,790
I'm the one who changed
the ransom note.

838
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,080
You?

839
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:31,540
Well, I've been trying to kill P.J.
You know, for his money.

840
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:41,580
I guess we're just two of a kind.

841
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,510
We're made for each other.

842
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,730
You shouldn't talk so loud
on the phone, Helen.

843
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,860
Give me the suitcase, pal.
Nice and slow.

Thank God you're here.
I've been so worried.

846
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,960

almost got away with our money?

I don't think I can trust you anymore.

Oh, Vincent.

849
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:36,440
Vinny.

850
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:38,650
Yes.

851
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,450
Yes.

852
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:43,660
Yes.

853
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:46,910
No! No!

854
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,790
In there.

855
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:06,000
I don't think you'll be needing those.

856
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,060
Hit it.

857
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,680
The bag, the bag.

858
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,450
- Flight 212 to Buenos Aires, Gate 17.
- Right.

859
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,240
Step back please, sir.

860
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:36,200
<i>Flight 212 to Buenos Aires</i>
<i>is now boarding.</i>

861
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:41,740
<i>Flight 212 to Buenos Aires</i>
<i>now boarding Gate 17.</i>

862
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:51,210
Should be getting a call
any minute now.

863
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:59,560
You gonna miss me?

864
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,270
Metal plate in my head.

865
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,600
I forgot. It's a scooter accident
when I was a kid.

866
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,150
Metal plate.

867
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:51,440
It doesn't hurt.

868
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,030
All right.

869
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,550
Come on.

870
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:36,150
Nikki! Nikki! Take it down, Nikki!
Take it down!

871
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,620
I can't get this thing down!

872
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,840
Nikki, turn!

873
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:05,230
Crumb, are you okay?

874
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,020
Of course I'm okay!

875
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,020
Nik! Nikki!

876
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,990
We're currently
number three for takeoff.

877
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,740
We'll be receiving
takeoff clearance momentarily.

878
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:36,880
You there! Pilot!

879
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:41,590
- Stop!
- We'll be cruising at 32,000 feet.

880
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:44,100
What the fuck is that?

881
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:49,030
Nikki. Nikki. Nikki, turn!

882
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,250
Who is that?

883
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:18,390
Crumb. Harry Crumb.

884
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:21,840
And I hereby charge
these two miscreants...

885
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:25,890
...with the kidnapping
of one Jennifer Downing.

886
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,850
You must be crazy, Crumb.

887
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,810
Crazy? Crazy like a fox.

888
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:38,940
I must warn you, Vince Barnes,
I have a black belt in aikido.

889
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:53,120
For chrissake, just shoot him.

890
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:03,300
And the boots to match.

891
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:25,740
Thank you, Mr. Crumb.
Nikki says we owe everything to you.

892
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,620
Oh, please. I had a good partner.

893
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:31,660
Didn't I tell you he was a schmooze?

894
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,870
If it's all right, Miss Downing,
we'd like to ask you...

895
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:37,800
- ...a few more questions.
- Sure. Whatever.

896
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,310
Hey.

897
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:47,020
Well, well, well. Detective Casey.
What about your theory now?

898
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,930
What can I say, Mr. Crumb?

899
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:52,780
What can you say?
I'll tell you what you can say.

900
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,980
- You can say that you're a...
- Harry.

901
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:59,560
It's just a thought,
that's all, a theory.

902
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,490
Don't make a sound.

903
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:39,820
Eliot.

904
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:50,990
Don't think I didn't know
what was going on in your mind.

905
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:56,160
You didn't think I could
figure it out, did you, Eliot?

906
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:00,250
You didn't think
I was up to the challenge.

907
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:04,750
Now you understand.

908
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,550
Now you know how good I really am.

909
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:13,640
Yup. Now you know
the folly of your ways.

910
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:18,730
Maybe now,
in front of these two gentlemen...

911
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,190
...you'll finally be man enough
to give credit...

912
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,520
...where credit is due.

913
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,290
What do you say to that,
Eliot Draisen?

914
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:34,420
All right, you imbecile, I confess.
I did it!

915
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:37,790
I kidnapped her!
I was behind the whole thing!

916
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:42,960
I don't know how you figured it out
with that witless brain of yours...

917
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:46,750
...but I would rather rot in jail
for the rest of my life...

918
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:53,010
...rather than listen
to one more idiotic word!

919
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:57,860
Book him.

920
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:01,310
I'm forever in your debt, Harry.

921
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:03,520
I don't know
how I can ever repay you.

922
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:08,360
You kind words are enough, P.J.,
not to mention this enormous cheque.

923
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:11,530
You earned it, Harry.
You've given me back my daughter.

924
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:13,610
Both my daughters.

925
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:17,990
Harry, are you sure you won't
come with us to Hawaii?

926
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:20,040
You'd look great in a grass skirt.

927
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:25,080
Thanks, Nikki, but a president
must be on call 24 hours a day.

928
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:26,470
Okay.

929
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:30,510
- Goodbye, Crumb.
- Goodbye, Nikki.

930
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,890
- P.J.
- Remember, lunch, soon as I get back.

931
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:38,970
You got it. Have a safe trip.

932
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:41,680
- Okay.
- Say hi to Don Ho for me.

933
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:45,730
Excuse me, Mr. Crumb. These escrow
papers are ready for your signature.

934
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:49,070
Not quite. Call the bank,
we wanna refinance at 8 percent.

935
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,690
I need to set a date
for the stockholders meeting.

936
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:53,250
Set it for the 12th.

937
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:56,570
These are you drapes
for the boardroom, Mr. Crumb.

938
01:23:56,750 --> 01:24:00,410
- No. Go with Venetian blinds.
- Like I suggested in the first place.

939
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:04,830
Not now. Not now. That's enough.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

940
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,750
Harry! San Francisco's calling
on line two!

941
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:11,630
All right.

942
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:14,010
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Crumb?</i>

943
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:15,380
- Hey.
<i>- Harry Crumb?</i>

944
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,020
Yes. Yes, this is Crumb.

945
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:21,270
<i>- You ever been to San Francisco?</i>
- Yes, I've been to San Francisco.

946
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,770
<i>- The Bottoms Up Club?</i>
- The Bottoms Up Club?

947
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:27,100
- Yes, I've heard of that club. That's...
<i>- You've been here?</i>

948
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,070
- No, I've never been there.
<i>- There's been a murder.</i>

949
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,570
- A murder?
<i>- Yes. Can you come?</i>

950
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,290
- Yes.
<i>- Right away?</i>

951
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:37,820
- Yes. Consider me there.
<i>- Good.</i>

952
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,490
Good luck, Harry.

953
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:54,730
Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna need it.

954
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:58,550
Looks like this one
could get a little rough.
