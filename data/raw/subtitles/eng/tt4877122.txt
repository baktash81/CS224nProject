1
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:55,733
<i>The world we live in.</i>

2
00:00:56,866 --> 00:01:00,137
<i>It's so wondrous, mysterious,</i>

3
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,773
<i>even magical.</i>

4
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:05,810
<i>No. No, not that world.</i>

5
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:08,746
<i>I meant this one.</i>

6
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:10,815
<i>The smartphone.</i>

7
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:13,551
<i>Each system and
program and app</i>

8
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:16,120
<i>is its own little planet
of perfect technology,</i>

9
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:18,789
<i>all providing
services so necessary,</i>

10
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:21,759
<i>so crucial,
so unbelievably profound.</i>

11
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,861
Look who just sent me a text.

12
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:25,462
Addie McAllister?

13
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:27,932
Must be a mistake.
Or a joke. Or a scam.

14
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:29,467
Don't send her your
Social Security number.

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,068
Dude.

16
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,536
She's right there.

17
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,071
<i>That's our user, Alex.</i>

18
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:36,908
<i>And, like every
freshman in high school,</i>

19
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:40,478
<i>his whole life, everything,
revolves around his phone.</i>

20
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:49,720
<i>And, as the pace of life
gets faster and faster...</i>

21
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:51,656
Phones down in five.

22
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:53,824
<i>And attention spans
get shorter and shorter and...</i>

23
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,960
<i>You're probably not even
listening to me right now.</i>

24
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:59,629
<i>Who has the time to
type out actual words?</i>

25
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,999
<i>And that's where we come in,</i>

26
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:04,035
<i>the most important invention in
the history of communication...</i>

27
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:10,041
<i>Emojis.</i>

28
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,875
<i>That's my home.</i>

29
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,077
<i>Textopolis.</i>

30
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:18,181
<i>Here, each of us
does one thing,</i>

31
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:21,218
<i>and we have to
nail it every time.</i>

32
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:22,854
<i>The Christmas Tree just has to</i>

33
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,688
<i>stand there all festive.</i>

34
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,822
Merry Christmas.

35
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,859
It's still
September, Tim.

36
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:30,161
<i>- The Princesses...
- I am so pretty.</i>

37
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:32,230
<i>They just got to wear their
crowns and keep their hair combed.</i>

38
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:33,763
You guys, we are so pretty.

39
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:38,168
<i>Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up.</i>

40
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,202
<i>They just show up,
and they're good to go.</i>

41
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:43,741
<i>But for the faces,
the pressure is on.</i>

42
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:46,510
<i>Crier always has to cry, even
if he's just won the lottery.</i>

43
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:49,279
Hooray! I'm a billionaire!

44
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,082
<i>The Laugher is always laughing,</i>

45
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:53,517
<i>even if he's
just broken his arm.</i>

46
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,753
I can see the bone!

47
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,256
<i>Now, me, I'm a Meh.</i>

48
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,525
<i>So I got to be totally
over it all the time,</i>

49
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:03,293
<i>you know, like,
"Meh, who cares?"</i>

50
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:05,195
<i>Which is not as
easy as it sounds.</i>

51
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:06,630
<i>♪ I gotta be</i>

52
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,065

<i>♪ I gotta be</i>

54
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:10,869
<i>♪ Meh ♪</i>

55
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:22,679
Morning, Mrs. D. I see you have
the little minis with you.

56
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:24,781
They're so cute.

57
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:36,027
That is so adorable,
I can't take it!

58
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,866
Now I'll never
get them to sleep.

59
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:43,568
Stick to your
one face, weirdo.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,035
<i>♪ Ole! Ole! ♪</i>

61
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,737
No! No!

62
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,673
<i>It's hard to
always act blase,</i>

63
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:52,643
<i>when living in Textopolis
is just so exciting.</i>

64
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:53,977
Hello, good simians.

65
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,814
Those are some
sharp attaches.

66
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:58,982
Yes, well, we have
business to attend to.

67
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,251
- What kind of business?
- Monkey business.

68
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,722
I sounded British!

69
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:08,259
Meh. That
was really good.

70
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:11,963
Meh. Meh.
That was a great...

71
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:13,731
- Whatcha doing there, mate?
- Practicing.

72
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:15,699
Today is my first
day on the phone.

73
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:18,201
Boy.
I'm gonna be so meh.

74
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:20,605
What are you gonna do?

75
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:22,807
Me and the boys are gonna
throw ourselves on the barbie!

76
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,941
Here's my sauce now.

77
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:26,577
G'day, mate.

78
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,648
<i>Hey. Konnichiwa.</i>

79
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:34,218
Sorry, emoticons!

80
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,653
I hate knocking
over the elderly.

81
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:36,953
Here, let me help,
let me help.

82
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:38,655
My colon!

83
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:42,960
Is that the time?

84
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,761
Hey, my eyes
are up here, pal.

85
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:48,966
Yeah! All right!

86
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,376
Right on time.

87
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:04,915
So, last week,

88
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:06,650
Alex sends me next to this guy.

89
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,921
That kid! Where
does he get this stuff?

90
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,927
Why are you
laughing, freak?

91
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:24,801
<i>Now, unlike me,
my parents are total pros.</i>

92
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:27,738
Gene, please tell me
you weren't laughing just now.

93
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:29,006
In public.

94
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,809
He was.
I remember.

95
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:34,679
Let's go somewhere
more private.

96
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:40,251
I have some bad news, Gene.

97
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:42,252
And I'm afraid you'll
have the wrong reaction.

98
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:45,088
Okay. What's the
wrong reaction?

99
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:47,391
Anything other than "meh."

100
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:50,393
Come on. I don't
want to be late.

101
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,196
I'm not letting you
go to work today.

102
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,363
Wait, what?

103
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,865
You're just not ready, son.

104
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,468
Come on! Working in the cube is
an emoji's whole purpose in life.

105
00:05:58,501 --> 00:06:01,071
Everybody my age is working
on the phone except for me.

106
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:03,675
Sweetie, that's not true.

107
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,279
Yeah! I'm gonna work on the
phone, and I'm only 10.

108
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:11,148
That's because
I believe in you.

109
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,882
Should we wash our hands?

110
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:17,353
No, no, no.

111
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,322
We're number two!

112
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,191
We're number two!
We're number two!

113
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,026
See?

114
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:27,998
I... I know
I'm different, okay?

115
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,367
But when I need to,
I can be meh.

116
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,336
I just...

117
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:35,506
I want to be a working
emoji, you know, like...

118
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:37,741
Like everybody else,
and then...

119
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:39,910
Then I would finally
fit in, you know?

120
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,878
You fit in, honey.

121
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:43,914
No, I don't, Mom.

122
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,316
I never have.

123
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,886
But I can change all that if you'd
just let me. Just give me a chance.

124
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,389
But what if you get sent out on
the phone, making the wrong face?

125
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:54,225
No, Dad, I'll make
the right face.

126
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:55,760
Look.

127
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,994
Meh...

128
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:00,331
You're so handsome
when you make that face.

129
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:01,899
I think he's ready, Mel.

130
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,068
Meh.

131
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:07,537
Come on, Dad.

132
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:10,307
Let me prove it to you.

133
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,143
If you really
think you're ready.

134
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:15,445
I am! Yes! Yes. I promise,
I won't let you down.

135
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:18,149
Stop.

136
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,396
Congratulations, everyone!

137
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:35,566
What an exciting
day for all of you.

138
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,100
It's really her.

139
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:38,401
Pizza!

140
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,204
Hey!

141
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:43,807
Your first day on the job.

142
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,509
Hi. Hi.

143
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:49,078
Don't be nervous. I won't bite.
Hi. I'm Smiler.

144
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:50,147
Don't touch me.

145
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,348
- Hi!
- Okay.

146
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,150
I mean, hey.

147
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,352
As you know, I'm Smiler.

148
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,956
I am the system
supervisor here

149
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:01,159
because I was
the original emoji.

150
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:07,831
Here's how it works.

151
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,199
It's nothing fancy.

152
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:11,235
Wait a minute.
It's really fancy!

153
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:20,343
You each have your own
cube on the emoji bar.

154
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:22,512
If Alex chooses you,

155
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,583
should you be so lucky,
your cube will light up.

156
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:30,187
It's showtime.

157
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,922
The scanner will scan you,

158
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:39,096
and that scan will get sent
right up to Alex's text box.

159
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:41,197
And let me tell you,
guys,

160
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:45,936
there is nothing like getting
scanned for the first time.

161
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:49,239
You're gonna love it. Really.

162
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:52,442
Now, over here is the favorites section

163
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:56,947
where you'll find all
the most popular emojis.

164
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:59,550
And, of course, you'll find
my cube here.

165
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:03,520
You are smooth.

166
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:05,189
Just doing my duty.

167
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:07,591
What? What did I say?

168
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:11,494
Rocket looking to party.

169
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:14,163
Come on, tell me you aren't
just a little bit tempted.

170
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:16,000
Steven, for the last time,

171
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:17,567
I don't want to buy a time-share.

172
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:21,005
Come on, man, it's Hi-5.
You know me, I'm a favorite.

173
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:22,940
Alex hasn't
picked you in weeks.

174
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,675
And if he stops picking you,
you're no longer a favorite.

175
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,111
It's got to be
some sort of mistake.

176
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:29,679
I mean, look at me, I'm an
attractive hand giving a high five.

177
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:32,516
- Fist Bump. Come on in.
- Hey.

178
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,020
- Ladies.
- Fist Bump? He's a knucklehead. Literally.

179
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,122
Look at him.
I can look like that.

180
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,524
Cramp.
Huge mistake.

181
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:45,396
Help. Help me.
Help up the hand.

182
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:48,165
- There you go.
- Thanks, mate.

183
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:51,268
Hey, little Meh, how about
you create a distraction,

184
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,136
and then I'll just
slip under the rope?

185
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,939
Is someone lost?

186
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:57,607
Smiler, hi. Just leaving.

187
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,944
Yeah, you know,
just killing time

188
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:02,545
before I go back to my
cube in the far corner

189
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:05,516
where Alex can't
even see me anymore!

190
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:07,483
You may not be
a favorite anymore,

191
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:10,420
but you will always
have a place in the cube.

192
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:12,356
Yeah, in the nosebleeds.

193
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,659
I'm standing
right here. Words hurt.

194
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:19,730
The most important thing I can
tell you is to just be yourself.

195
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:22,165
Blah.

196
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:25,401
I was made to be happy, so I
am always smiling.

197
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:29,073
<i>Places, please.
Emojis to your cubes.</i>

198
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:32,076
<i>Attention. We've got incoming.</i>

199
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,310
Got to be meh.
Got to be meh.

200
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:37,113
My gosh, my own cube.

201
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:39,749
I can't believe it.
I could put a plant over here.

202
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:42,552
And over here could go
an inspirational calendar.

203
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:45,254
Okay. Got to be meh.
Got to be meh.

204
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:47,224
Look at
our son down there.

205
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:49,392
I'm just beaming

206
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:54,030
with pride.

207
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:56,199
You don't think he'll
actually get picked, do you?

208
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:01,371
Hie-ro-gly-phics.

209
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:04,540
Hieroglyphics was an ancient
language of picture forms.

210
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:07,578
Does that remind
anyone of anything?

211
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:12,082
Hello? A language
of pictures. Anyone?

212
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:17,388
Early hieroglyphs
date back as far as 3,300...

213
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,522
I got to
reply to Addie's text.

214
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:21,391
- What should I write?
- Nothing.

215
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:23,260
- Nothing?
- Words aren't cool.

216
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:27,564
Okay. Be cool. Be cool.

217
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:32,235
All right, Alex is not sure
how he wants to play this.

218
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,772
I would really
love it to be me.

219
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:36,806
Beam me up! Beam me up!

220
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,641
I need Thumbs Up on standby.

221
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:41,310
Yeah!
Thumbs Up is going in!

222
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:44,615
<i>Wait!
Alex is changing his mind.</i>

223
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:48,419
He's moving.

224
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,525
Okay. Looks like
it's gonna be Meh.

225
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,397
I'm so nervous,
I could almost shrug.

226
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:03,534
We are go for Meh.

227
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,335
Initiating scan.

228
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:09,073
Okay. You can do this.

229
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:11,107
- I can't do this! I can't do it!
- What is this?

230
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,644
Stop the scan!

231
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:16,813
I can't! It's too late!

232
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:20,184
Meh, meh, meh, meh.
My goodness, I'm freaking out!

233
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,418
What's he doing?

234
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,785
He's making the wrong face!

235
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:25,622
Good for him!
Little... Wait, what?

236
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:28,092
Be meh! Be meh! Be meh!

237
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,226
Abort! Abort!

238
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,728
Shut it down!
Shut it down!

239
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,272
What is that emoji?

240
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,741
Wrong emoji sent! Evacuate the Meh cube!

241
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:48,846
<i>Evacuate the cube!</i>

242
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:50,413
I got to get out of here.

243
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:55,385
<i>Get that bozo out of there!</i>

244
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:56,587
I'm trying!

245
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:12,169
No!

246
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,138
My God.

247
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,814
The humanity.

248
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:26,183
Medic.

249
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,387
Sorry, everybody. That was
not what I meant to do.

250
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,156
I kinda...

251
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,391
I kinda panicked.

252
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:36,593
Are you even
a Meh at all?

253
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:38,495
- Who? Me?
- Course he is.

254
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,463
He's my spitting image.

255
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:43,232
If you have expressions
other than meh,

256
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:45,769
what you are
is a malfunction.

257
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:53,242
Malfunction?

258
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:56,512
No! I can be meh. Just
give me one more chance.

259
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,348
That's not gonna happen.

260
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,285
You know what
would be really fun?

261
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:03,252
A board meeting.

262
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:05,321
Where we could figure out
what to do with you!

263
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:11,661
I knew there was
something wrong with him.

264
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:13,963
A malfunction?

265
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:15,365
- What's gonna happen to him?
- He can't work on the phone.

266
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,533
What would Alex think?

267
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,501
- That's the guy.
- What do his parents think?

268
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:38,322
I just wanted to be useful, you know?
Fit in.

269
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:40,657
Now everybody
thinks I'm a malfunction.

270
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:48,432
I am a malfunction.

271
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,833
Even if you are
a malfunction, Gene,

272
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:53,804
your mom and dad
still love ya.

273
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:55,771
I knew you weren't ready.

274
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:58,474
Let's get you out of
here and take you home.

275
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:00,910
One day, all this
will blow over,

276
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:04,247
and everyone will almost
forget about what you did.

277
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:06,816
Until then,

278
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:09,685
you should probably stay
locked up in the apartment.

279
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:11,588
Wait. You want
to hide me away?

280
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,491
You're embarrassed of me.

281
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:16,360
It's for your own safety.

282
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:18,261
We're trying to
protect you, son.

283
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:23,333
Gene? Where are you going?

284
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:25,501
I'm not gonna
run away from this.

285
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:27,972
I'm an emoji, and even though
I'm not sure exactly which one,

286
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:32,608
I've got to have some
sort of purpose here.

287
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,609
I know it.

288
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,778
Gene, no.

289
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,614
Sweetie, please.

290
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:45,354
Boy.

291
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:46,956
- A malfunction...
- Order! Order!

292
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,792
The motion is carried.

293
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,695
So, how'd it go, Gavel?

294
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:55,531
Hey, Light Bulb, tell me
what's going on in there.

295
00:15:55,564 --> 00:15:58,401
What?
Poop, what is it?

296
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:00,569
Tell me, turd. Tell me true.
What happened?

297
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:04,473
I know it was an accident.
We all have accidents.

298
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,909
You're so soft, Poop.

299
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,712
Not too soft, I hope.

300
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:09,913
Gene!

301
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:12,516
We were just gonna
come looking for you.

302
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:15,018
Why don't you come
inside the boardroom,

303
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,054
and we can have
a teeny, weeny chat.

304
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:30,767
I came up here to defend
myself, but you seem pretty happy.

305
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,969
So, good news?

306
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:37,473
Right.
I'm always happy.

307
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:39,809
Right.
Hashtag truth.

308
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:42,945
Well, the only thing
that could ever make me unhappy

309
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:46,550
is if one of our
emoji team made a mistake,

310
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:50,420
which caused Alex to
lose faith in the phone.

311
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:55,392
And then our whole
world gets wiped out.

312
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,563
Smiler, I double-pinky-swear
promise to you

313
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:04,501
that I will never, ever make
a mistake in the cube again.

314
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,736
We know you
won't, Gene.

315
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,473
We know you won't.

316
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:11,140
You know,
the first time you said it,

317
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:14,478
it sounded genuine,
but then you repeated it,

318
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,011
and then, that was weird.

319
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,880
That's because we're setting you up

320
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:20,517
with our best
Anti-Virus Bots.

321
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,622
So, they'll like, They'll just...
They're gonna fix me?

322
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:29,626
Actually, delete you.
But yes!

323
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:31,761
- Wait, what?
- If you get deleted,

324
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:34,430
you don't
have to worry about

325
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,800
what your purpose
is or the future

326
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,703
or why you're
such a malfunction.

327
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:42,738
'Cause you're deleted, right?

328
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,040
All right, good talk.

329
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:45,675
Bots!

330
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:50,780
No!

331
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:55,753
Don't let him escape!

332
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,903
Party time!
Wait a minute...

333
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:31,054
The air is better here.

334
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:36,726
- Beer, Tea.
- I'm Coffee!

335
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,563
Sorry. Sheesh. So edgy.

336
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:47,904
My old cube.

337
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:51,174
Take a hike, Mike.

338
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:54,010
- My name's not Mike.
- What?

339
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:56,078
- There's AV Bots coming!
- For me?

340
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:58,047
Just because I'm in
the wrong section?

341
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,519
Holy deleto!

342
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,694
- What do we do?
- Quick! This way!

343
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:16,899
Let's go.

344
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:26,542
Don't tell anyone
you're about to see this.

345
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:29,945
They'll never
find us down here.

346
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:32,949
Where are we?
The basement?

347
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:36,219
No. Welcome to
the Loser Lounge,

348
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:39,822
where the emojis
who never get used hang out.

<i>♪ Squares never fit in
a circle of friends... ♪</i>

350

00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:50,000
Sweep so you won't cry.
Sweep so you won't cry.

352
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:52,001
Sweep so you won't cry.

353
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:57,139
I almost got deleted.

354
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,974
Me, Hi-5.

355
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:01,278
Hey. What's up, Hi-5?

356
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,246
They weren't trying to delete you.
They were trying to delete me.

357
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,116
You? What's so
important about you

358
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:08,150
they'd send out
an entire team of Bots?

359
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:10,287
They say I'm a malfunction.

360
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,126
You bringing malfunctions
in here now, Hi-5?

361
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,628
For crying out loud,
Abandoned Luggage,

362
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:22,165
that had better not be
my leftover Chinese food.

363
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:24,833
What Chinese food?

364
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:30,640
Do you have any
idea what it's like

365
00:20:30,673 --> 00:20:33,042
to be living large,
hashtag blessed,

366
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:38,213
the favorite of the favorites, and
then demoted to this pit of despair?

367
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:40,249
Here, will you hit
my calluses for me?

368
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,251
At least you're
a working emoji.

369
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,053
That's all I ever wanted.

370
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:46,256
Well, if that's all it'll take

371
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,725
for you to be satisfied, then just
find a hacker and get reprogrammed.

372
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:50,993
It's not that complicated.

373
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:52,362
Where would I find
a hacker?

374
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,263
In the Piracy app. Duh.

375
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:56,199
Who took my
clear nail polish?

376
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,636
Piracy app?

377
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:03,238
To get there, I mean,
I'd have to leave Textopolis.

378
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:06,643
So? I've done it.
Would you be a brother?

379
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:08,979
One of the Princess emojis
left the phone altogether.

380
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:10,713
Now she lives on the cloud.

381
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:13,148
That is good.

382
00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:16,251
I'm sure the hacker that helped her
do that could easily reprogram you.

383
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:18,687
- The name's Jailbreak.
- Jailbreak?

384
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:20,790
That's great!
Reprogrammed.

385
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,626
I just need to
be reprogrammed,

386
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:25,995
and then, I can finally be
the Meh I was meh to be.

387
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,298
Help me find that hacker, Hi-5.
Will you? Please?

388
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,800
Maybe this hacker
could help you, too.

389
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:34,069
Like rewrite some code, get you
into the favorites section.

390
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:36,206
Wait a minute.

391
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:38,775
I've been trying to use my charisma

392
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:40,944
and sense of entitlement
to get me back on top,

393
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:42,678
but all I need is a hacker.

394
00:21:42,712 --> 00:21:45,815
Today's your lucky day.
Let's roll.

395
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,884
Hey, can I come, too?

396
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,319
Talk to the hand, Red Wagon.

397
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,723
I thought I was.

398
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:56,025
Bye, Felicia.

399
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,194
Ciao, Fish Cake with Swirl.

400
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:03,433
Daddy's heading back to the
VIPs where he belongs!

401
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:05,135
Wait. What about the Bots?

402
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,038
Good point. Good point.

403
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:26,356
Ouch!

404
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,390
Hey.

405
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:29,792
I shouldn't have picked the cactus.

406
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,126
I just...
I shouldn't have picked it.

407
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:31,994
You didn't even
try to get the tree.

408
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:33,664
It's baffling. Let's go.

409
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:41,203
Hi-5?

410
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:43,873
Hello?

411
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:46,842
Hi-5?

412
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:49,846
Where are you?

413
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:51,414
I'm right here!

414
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:52,848
Gene!

415
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:54,317
Here we are,
end of the text app.

416
00:22:58,354 --> 00:23:00,390
No way.

417
00:23:00,423 --> 00:23:02,459
Come on, Gene.
It's perfectly safe.

418
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:04,793
- No!
- Gene, help me!

419
00:23:04,827 --> 00:23:06,096
- The wallpaper monster's got me!
- No! Hold on, hold on!

420
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:08,197
Hi-5!

421
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:11,334
No. This is all my fault!
I'm so sorry, Hi-5! I'm...

422
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:13,269
I'm just messing with you.

423
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,170
It's one of those
rubber finger-monster puppets

424
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:17,941
from the '80s.
I collected the whole set.

425
00:23:17,973 --> 00:23:19,408
All right, you coming?

426
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:21,344
- What do I do?
- What do you mean?

427
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:23,079
Just take a step
through the other side.

428
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:27,983
This is it.

429
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,251
The next time
I come back here,

430
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:32,155
I'll be a real Meh.

431
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:37,527
Hi-5?

432
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:49,105
No!

433
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,912
Are you finished?

434
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,048
Where are we?

435
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:03,085
Welcome to the Wallpaper.

436
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:14,897
This place is incredible.

437
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,199
Each app is its own unique world.

438
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:20,036
That's my face.
You're on my... Thank you.

439
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:25,508
What is this place?

440
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,542
WeChat.

441
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,817
It's like
a whole other world.

442
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,318
It is.

443
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:43,193
What are they?

444
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:44,860
They're Bubble Pups. They might
be cute, but, man, are they clingy.

445
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:46,296
Whee!

446
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:48,298
- Bubble Pups?
- They're stickers, Gene.

447
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,567
Try to get with the program.

448
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,234
This is so cool.

449
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:55,305
Wait. What's in that one?

450
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:57,005
Guys, look at this picture.
Look at my baby.

451
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,942
This is what
I ate for breakfast.

452
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:00,309
- This is what I ate for lunch!
- Here's me on a hike!

453
00:25:00,342 --> 00:25:02,044
Here's me in the gym!
Here's me in the bathroom!

454
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:03,879
Everybody's talking about themselves.

455
00:25:03,913 --> 00:25:05,481
How does he know
so many people?

456
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:08,217
None of these people know him,
but they like him,

457
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:11,221
and that's what matters
in this life, popularity.

458
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:12,921
I...

459
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:14,424
I think I'd...

460
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:16,592
I think I'd rather
just have a real friend.

461
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:19,127
A real friend? How's
that gonna get you anywhere?

462
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:21,564
What you need are fans.

463
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:25,234
They give you complete
and unrelenting support.

464
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:26,603
As long as you're on top.

465
00:25:28,503 --> 00:25:31,307
Poor Gene.
I blame myself.

466
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:34,010
I blame you, too.

467
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,212
I just wanted
to be supportive.

468
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:38,647
You just wanted a vacation.

469
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:41,451
You take
that back, Mel Meh.

470
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:47,223
Bots.

471
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,391
If they haven't found Gene by
now, he must have skipped town.

472
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:51,159
You mean the Wallpaper?

473
00:25:51,193 --> 00:25:52,896
Our boy's on the run.

474
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,897
How about we
find him ourselves?

475
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:56,266
Yeah, for sure.

476
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:06,408
Tell all Bots to
follow those Mehs.

477
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:10,680
I'm sure they'll know all the
freaky-deaky apps Gene will hide out in.

478
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:12,648
I'm really good at making
puns, you guys.

479
00:26:12,682 --> 00:26:15,151
Right?

480
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:17,487
Here we are.
The Piracy app.

481
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,022
This is where
we'll find Jailbreak.

482
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:22,625
But this
is the Dictionary.

483
00:26:22,657 --> 00:26:24,961
That's just what Alex
wants his parents to think.

484
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:26,529
This is called a skin.

485
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:28,530
Really? What could
a teenage boy

486
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:32,334
possibly want to
hide from his parents?

487
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:34,604
Just try to keep up. This
place can get a little rough.

488
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:40,143
<i>♪ We're not gonna take it</i>

489

00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:46,015

00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:47,550
Look who's back!

492
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:49,384
Hi-5!

493
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:51,620
I'm a bit of a celebrity here.
Always welcome.!

494
00:26:51,654 --> 00:26:53,088
Loser!

495
00:26:53,121 --> 00:26:54,690

Great. Emojis.

499
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:06,135
I thought the conversation
just got dumber.

500
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,338
Internet trolls.
Just ignore them.

501
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,305
Eventually, they'll
get a job or a girlfriend

502
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:13,175
or some sort of purpose in
life, and they'll stop.

503
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:18,381

just walk over this way.

505
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:24,721
Hi! It's so great
to see you again.

506
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:27,357
Do I know you?

507
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:29,725
It's Spam. Just sign here and I can
get you special discounts on vitamins

508
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,493

that can save you up to 25%.

509
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:34,063
- 25%?
- No, no, no, don't get sucked in.

510
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:35,631
Back off, Spam!

511
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:37,200
It's the only way to
deal... Back off!

512
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:38,768
Thank you very much!

513
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,170
You can illegally download
our CD right here.

514
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,307
Hey, Trojan Horse.
How are you?

515
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:46,141
Yeah, what'll it be, hand?

516
00:27:46,175 --> 00:27:49,212
I'll have a bottle of
"Hack Daniel's."

517
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:55,050
Maybe with a plate
of cheese and hackers?

518
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:57,353
<i>- Capisce?
- You trying to find a hacker?</i>

519
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:58,620
You can just ask, you know.

520
00:27:58,654 --> 00:28:00,323
Sorry. Yes.

521
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:02,592
We're looking for
a hacker named Jailbreak.

522
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:03,693
I know a guy that
can hook you up.

523
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:08,530
Right over there.

524
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,200
He looks capable.

525
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,771
No, not him. Her.

526
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:17,407
Wait. He's a she?

527
00:28:19,442 --> 00:28:21,144
Hey, Jailbreak.

528
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:23,111
- Mind if we join you?
- Yes.

529
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:25,213
That's the thing about
the Internet, isn't it?

530
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,249
You can never tell if someone's
being ironic or sincere.

531
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:29,685
I sincerely, unironically
want you to go away.

532
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:35,190
That's a good one.

533
00:28:35,223 --> 00:28:37,693
So, here's the thing. My friend
Gene here has a little problem.

534
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:40,429
Well, see,
I'm supposed to be a Meh,

535
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:42,365
- but I don't really feel...
- Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

536
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:43,732
No, that's good.
And we thought

537
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,434
you could help,
since you got the Princess,

538
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:47,269
- you know, off the phone.
- Not interested.

539
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,644
Hold up.
That's not a Meh face.

540
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:56,111
Bots! They're after me!

541
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,721
How are you doing that?

542
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:07,122
Look, it's just something I can do.
Can you help us?

543
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:11,494
Follow me.

544
00:29:15,563 --> 00:29:16,732
Bots! Delete my history!

545
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:22,572
I corrupted
the entire hard drive.

546
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:27,876
I made the most
delicious cinnamon buns.

547
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:32,214
Maybe if there was something
to, you know, jog my memory.

548
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:38,621
Come on! Move!

549
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:42,224
Hey, Trolls, why is that
mailbox wearing a tuxedo?

550
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:50,599
Hi! It's so great to
see you again! Call me!

551
00:29:58,206 --> 00:29:59,641
This tunnel will
get us out of here.

552
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:00,609
Move!

553
00:30:25,434 --> 00:30:27,503
Did that cloud
taste sweet to you?!

554
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,279
Help me! Help! I'm stuck!

555
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:37,646
Sweet motherboard!

556
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,448
Where am I?

557
00:30:42,585 --> 00:30:43,752
Get me out of here.

558
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:45,221
Hey, Palm Face.

559
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:46,321
Try getting him
out the top!

560
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:47,522
Already on it!

561
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,225
Hold tight, Gene.

562
00:30:57,465 --> 00:30:59,668
This feels very odd,
and it smells.

563
00:30:59,702 --> 00:31:03,372
I mean, it smells good, it smells
delicious, but I still don't like it.

564
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:05,575
The game obviously
thinks you're a candy,

565
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:08,977
even though you're weirdly
misshapen, you know?

566
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:10,413
What are we gonna do?

567
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:12,280
Stay very still.

568
00:31:12,313 --> 00:31:16,351
Don't worry. We've got your back.
Right, Hi-5?

569
00:31:17,886 --> 00:31:19,754
Hey, Fingers!
You want to focus?

570
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:21,557
For your information, I happen
to have a sugar addiction,

571
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,459
- and it's a very serious...
- Listen, Finger Head!

572
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:27,663
We have to get Gene out of the
game without blowing him up.

573
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:28,798
I don't want to blow up.

574
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,699
We have to match
up the candies,

575
00:31:30,732 --> 00:31:32,367
so that Gene will
drop to the bottom.

576
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:35,905
And we can't match him
with any yellows, or else...

577
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,973
Don't do that.
Please don't do that.

578
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:38,975
Watch.

579
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:43,713
- You got it?
- Match three in a row.

580
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:45,413
Don't blow Gene up. Got it.

581
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,250
And we have to
be very careful.

582
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,586
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Careful.
- Candy!

583
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:54,290
- Watch it!
- Hey!

584
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:55,790
No!
No, no, no! Slow down.

585
00:31:55,823 --> 00:31:57,792
Not the yellows!
Not the yellows.

586
00:31:57,826 --> 00:31:59,295
I said careful!

587
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:11,440
My mom just joined Facebook. Can you
believe she wanted to friend me?

588
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:14,909
Hey, Addie, I was just
wondering if you are...

589
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:16,779
<i>- Tasty.
- What?</i>

590
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:18,813
<i>- Delicious.
- Excuse me?</i>

591
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:19,915
<i>Sweet.</i>

592
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:21,483
- Hey, Addie!
- Hi, Nikki.

593
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:23,953
- No!
- See you later, Alex.

594
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:25,588
<i>Sugar Crush.</i>

595
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,723
So over this.

596
00:32:32,728 --> 00:32:34,397
<i>Wireless Wireless.
How may I help you?</i>

597
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,965
I'd like to make
an appointment.

598
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:37,533
It's like this phone is
playing games with me.

599
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:41,870
Hey, what does this do?

600
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:48,610
No!

601
00:32:48,644 --> 00:32:50,313
Get me out of here!

602
00:32:55,951 --> 00:32:58,521
- Suck it in!
- No! Stop it! Stop, stop!!

603
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:00,055
It's not working.

604
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:02,090
Well, there's
one option left.

605
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:03,858
We line you up
with the yellows.

606
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:05,528
But you said not to do that.

607
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,996
Special candies get
transported to that jar.

608
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,598
The game might think
you're a special candy.

609
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:13,869
And what if it doesn't think
I'm a special candy?

610
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:14,937
Well...

611
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,084
- Jailbreak, hello? Hello, Jailbreak?
- Sorry.

612
00:33:29,117 --> 00:33:30,919
What if it doesn't
think I'm a special candy?

613
00:33:30,953 --> 00:33:32,989
I'm not too
worried about it.

614
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:36,826
Okay, just do it.

615
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:44,701
Gene!

616
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,136
Gene?

617
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:49,771
Hey. No!

618
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:53,676
Gene! You're alive!

619
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:55,511
You were trying to
see if I had somehow

620
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:57,113
turned into candy,
weren't you?

621
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:58,981
Yes, I was.
And you have not.

622
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:05,854
Hey. Looks like something
popped up on Alex's calendar.

623
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,760
I'm sure it's nothing.

624
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:13,028
Alex made an
appointment at the phone store.

625
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,565
No!!

626
00:34:17,698 --> 00:34:19,568
Calm down, everyone!

627
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,069
Calm down.

628
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:23,872
Don't worry.
Everything is fine.

629
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:26,809
Maybe Alex just wants
to buy some accessories.

630
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:30,879
His appointment is
with technical support.

631
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:35,117
Well, I'm sure we still have plenty
of time to figure this out.

632
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:36,985
His appointment is for tomorrow.

633
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:42,457
Then maybe it's just for
some routine maintenance.

634
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,693
Actually,
it's to erase the phone.

635
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,171
Listen, Gene, I'm about to
become your knight in shining armor.

636
00:34:56,205 --> 00:34:57,640
- You are?
- Yeah.

637
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,709
But first, we need
to get uploaded to the cloud.

638
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:04,847
That's where we'll find the
source code to reprogram you.

639
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,147
The cloud?

640
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,883
Isn't that off the phone?

641
00:35:07,915 --> 00:35:09,919
Ding, ding, ding, ding.
You got it.

642
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,488
Yeah,
the cloud. Off the phone.

643
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:15,925
<i>We're in Candy Crush, obvs.</i>

644
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:17,926
<i>I know a shortcut
to Just Dance,</i>

645
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,894
which is right
next to Dropbox,

646
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:22,531
where we can get
uploaded to the cloud.

647
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:24,633
<i>Of course. Just Dance,
then boogie over to Dropbox,</i>

648
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:25,901
catch the link, and zoom.

649
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:27,602
Hold up.
Here's the stinker.

650
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:29,537
Before they let
us into the cloud,

651
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:31,707
we have to get
past this firewall.

652
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:34,777
The firewall uses
face identification.

653
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,946
Yeah, the firewall.

654
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:38,881
Which is really annoying, because
I've already tried to get through.

655
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:40,982
Guessed wrong once, and now
I'm locked out for life.

656
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,818
Locked out for life?

657
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,753
You're thinking, 'cause
I can make different faces,

658
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:48,189
- the firewall will think I'm different emojis.
- Yeah.

659
00:35:48,222 --> 00:35:50,692
I wanted to say it
'cause it was my idea.

660
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:52,528
You know, women are always
coming up with stuff

661
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,796
that men are
taking credit for.

662
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:55,164
You know what...

663
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,698
Well, then
let's hit the road.

664
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,099
Hi-5, you coming?

665
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:01,636
I'm coming!

666
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:04,205
Why do I always think I'm gonna
come around on black licorice?

667
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,609
My precious.

668
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:08,977
Hey! Move it!

669
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,512
Certain death,
here we come.

670
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,517
Let's try this one.

671
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:17,720
YouTube?

672
00:36:23,158 --> 00:36:25,661
What a visual treat.

673
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:27,262
And I don't
even need a remote.

674
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:32,967
That guy is so expressive.

675
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,303
He reminds me of Gene.

676
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:38,239
Yeah. Something
really wrong with him.

677
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,609
- Mel.
- Our son is a malfunction,

678
00:36:41,642 --> 00:36:44,679
and you should never have
let him go into that cube.

679
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:46,649
Don't blame me for this, Mel.

680
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:48,850
I am hopping mad at you.

681
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:49,684
See?

682
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:55,223
Mary, I think
we're being followed.

683
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,059
But don't overreact.

684
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:01,129
I told you not to overreact.

685
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,936
What are you doing now?

686
00:37:12,673 --> 00:37:15,310
They'll be in there for hours.

687
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:30,158
Mary, where are you going?

688
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:32,727
I think we should go
our separate ways, Mel.

689
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,296
I thought I knew
the Meh that I married,

690
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,966
but maybe I don't.

691
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:39,001
But, Mary...

692
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:45,307
This tunnel will
help us avoid the Bots.

693
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:48,042
Thanks for helping us.
It's really nice of you.

694
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:50,778
NBD, dude. The truth is,
you're helping me.

695
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:53,147
Come on, let's move it.
Why so slow?

696
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,984
Hi-5, stop. Why are you getting so
close? What's with you? Back off.

697
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:58,086
Can't stop now.
I'm having a sugar rush!

698
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,290
I'll go around you. If I stop
moving, my heart's gonna explode!

699
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,192
Coming through,
Jailbreak! Look out!

700
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:05,094
Hey!
Watch it, Knuckle Butt!

701
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:07,129
I can't feel my face.

702
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:10,198
So, Jailbreak, back there
you said I'm helping you.

703
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:12,800
I've been trying to get past
that firewall for months.

704
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,903
Come on, come on!

705
00:38:14,935 --> 00:38:15,738
The faster we get there, the
faster I become a favorite!

706
00:38:17,872 --> 00:38:19,307
Look at me!

707
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,343
I just want to
bounce out of here,

708
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:22,977
get off the phone,
and live on the cloud.

709
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:29,784
What just happened?

710
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,854
You don't like it here?

711
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:35,189
There's so many rules here.
What is up with that?

712
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:36,991
The cloud is
supposed to be amazing.

713
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,127
There's so much to
see and do.

714
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,729
Sugar crash.

715
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:42,998
I can't hold on anymore.

716
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,134
Catch me, Gene. Catch me!

717
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:47,036
And you can be
whoever you want.

718
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:51,073
Thanks.

719
00:38:51,106 --> 00:38:52,707
You're free! Come on!

720
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,878
My gosh,
my hands are sweating.

721
00:38:56,912 --> 00:38:58,180
You are a hand!

722
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:02,350
Yeah!

723
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:08,924
You know, come to think of it,
I don't really remember

724
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:11,160
there ever being
a hacker emoji.

725
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:15,330
You know, you're taking
up too much of my brain space.

726
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:17,066
Let's keep
the chitchat to a minimum.

727
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,035
Someone likes you.

728
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:22,171
What are you talking about?

729
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:25,073
This is just like when Peace
Sign gave me just one finger.

730
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:26,374
I knew she was
in love with me.

731
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:28,911
Let's go!

732
00:39:28,943 --> 00:39:31,046
I'm never eating another
piece of candy ever again.

733
00:39:33,948 --> 00:39:36,452
Hi-5, don't do it.

734
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:38,921
Don't you do it. It's
already been in there once.

735
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:41,924
Don't do it.

736
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:46,828
- Move it!
- Are my fingers getting fat?

737
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:48,731
I'll tell you what, this bandage
wasn't so tight before.

738
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:58,173
Okay. We get through this app, and
Dropbox is right on the other side.

739
00:39:58,205 --> 00:40:00,876
We just need to keep
it super DL in here.

740
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:04,178
And no matter what,
we can't turn it on.

741
00:40:08,415 --> 00:40:10,785
OMG, this turned it on!

742
00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:15,057
What? I'm a hand.
It's a big, red button.

743
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:30,238
- What's happening?
- No, no, no, no, no!

744
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:34,542
<i>Welcome to Just Dance!</i>

745

746
00:40:38,379 --> 00:40:41,550

and you get an "X."

747
00:40:41,582 --> 00:40:44,852
Three strikes and you're out.

748
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:47,021
Out? What does
she mean by "Out"?

749
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:49,424
Digital death.

750
00:40:49,457 --> 00:40:53,194
Thanks to you, Fingers. Now we're
gonna have to dance our way out.

751
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:56,097
Which is all right with me, 'cause
I can shake it like Michael.

752
00:40:56,131 --> 00:40:57,833
Or Michael's glove, anyway.

753
00:40:57,865 --> 00:41:03,037
Are you ready to dance?

754
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:06,375
This is bad, Gene. I can't dance.
I got no groove.

755
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:08,510
Come on.
Everybody can dance.

756
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:12,481
Not me, okay?
I'm really stiff.

757
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:16,117
See? I can't...
Don't understand.

758
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:17,919
- No.
- Okay. No, no...

759
00:41:17,952 --> 00:41:19,387
- Hey, no, stop, stop.
- Stop, stop. She has to stop.

760
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:22,256

Just follow her moves.

836
00:46:12,714 --> 00:46:14,616

- Gene.
- That's my friend down there.

847

849
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,783

to look out for number one.

850
00:46:49,816 --> 00:46:51,485
Well, what good is
it to be number one

851
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:52,488
if there aren't
any other numbers?

852
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,326
Okay.

00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:03,592
If they find a malfunction on the
phone, we are all gonna be wiped.

872
00:48:03,624 --> 00:48:05,559
Yeah.

873
00:48:05,593 --> 00:48:06,828
She said, "Wiped."

874
00:48:08,528 --> 00:48:10,231
Aim higher, Steven.

875
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:11,866
I didn't want to
have to do this,

876
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:13,202
but it is fun
to press buttons.

877
00:48:16,903 --> 00:48:18,606
The illegal upgrade.

878
00:48:26,513 --> 00:48:28,550
Now that makes me happy.

879
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:37,692
I just want to dance.

880
00:48:37,725 --> 00:48:39,361
Dance, please.

881
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:41,463
Arr! Quiet,
you sassy gypsy.

882
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,635
Where am I?

883
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:49,271
Hi! It's so great to see you again!

884
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:51,639
You're in the trash,
Fingers for Brains.

885
00:48:51,673 --> 00:48:53,475
- Get away from me, Troll.
- Hi!

886
00:48:53,508 --> 00:48:54,843
It's so great
to see you again!

887
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:56,745
- I got to get out of here.
- You can't.

888
00:48:56,778 --> 00:48:58,546
And at the end of the day,

889
00:48:58,578 --> 00:49:01,348
the trash gets emptied,
and we're all gonna die!

890
00:49:01,381 --> 00:49:03,050
No. No, no!

891
00:49:03,084 --> 00:49:05,654
This is the last face you
will ever see.

892
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:08,723
No!

00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:30,444

pick a calmer stream?

905
00:49:48,963 --> 00:49:50,531
Okay, buzzkill.

906
00:49:57,372 --> 00:50:00,008
Alex. A bunch of people
are hitting the promenade.

907
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,475
I think Addie
might be there, too.

908
00:50:01,508 --> 00:50:02,943
That's perfect!

909
00:50:02,977 --> 00:50:04,479
I have an appointment
down there, anyway.

910
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:05,946
I've got to get
this phone fixed.

00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:14,589
Much better.

915
00:50:14,622 --> 00:50:16,691
So, I got to ask.

916
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:18,693
Is it true that when
a princess whistles,

917
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:20,662
birds fly down
from the skies, and...

918
00:50:20,694 --> 00:50:24,098
Hello, stereotype. That is
a complete and total myth.

919
00:50:24,131 --> 00:50:26,568
I'm sorry.

920
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,069
Did you realize that
on the first emoji set,

921
00:50:29,102 --> 00:50:32,072
a woman can either be
a princess or a bride?

922
00:50:32,106 --> 00:50:34,109
That's why I need
to get to the cloud,

923
00:50:34,142 --> 00:50:36,377
where you can be
whoever you want to be.

924
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,946
Get ready.
Whale song coming.

925
00:50:38,979 --> 00:50:40,981
- Wait, wait. Whale what?
- A whale song.

926
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:43,518
From Alex's
biology presentation.

927
00:50:54,796 --> 00:50:57,064
You're not gonna see
that sitting around in a cube.

928
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:04,171
It's funny. You want out of
the cube, and I want in.

929
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:10,178
Gene, if that means you can't
be yourself, what's the point?

930
00:51:10,211 --> 00:51:13,548
You know, I think you're pretty
cool just the way you are.

931
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:28,930
We're
gonna need this.

I used to be somebody.

935
00:51:46,814 --> 00:51:50,218
Here I am. Look. In an
old e-mail Alex never sent.

936
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:52,854
"Addie, blah, blah, blah,
blah, bla-la-la-la."

937
00:51:53,955 --> 00:51:55,824
And then there's me, Hi-5,

938
00:51:55,856 --> 00:51:57,825
right there, doing my job.

939
00:51:59,794 --> 00:52:03,198
FYI, nobody cares about you.

940
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:07,468
Just leave me,
Troll, and let me die

941
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:10,138
in this dump alone.

942
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:12,740
Let me look for the world's
smallest violin in here,

943
00:52:12,772 --> 00:52:16,910
so you can play it.

944
00:52:16,943 --> 00:52:19,814
It's the Hand Angel of Mercy.
She's finally come for me.

945
00:52:21,749 --> 00:52:22,951
Give me your hand!

946
00:52:22,984 --> 00:52:24,719
I mean, give me yourself.

947
00:52:24,752 --> 00:52:26,554
Take my hand, angel.

948
00:52:28,955 --> 00:52:31,658
I'm ready to take my place amongst
the other great hands of the past.

949
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:33,794
- It's me, Gene!
- Gene?

950
00:52:33,827 --> 00:52:35,262
The one and only.

951
00:52:35,296 --> 00:52:37,064
- Gene!
- I got him!

952
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:41,937
Take me with you.

953
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:43,905
Hi-5!

954
00:52:43,937 --> 00:52:45,205
Let go of me.

955
00:52:45,238 --> 00:52:47,040
Don't leave me down here!

956
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:51,713
You were wrong, Troll.
People do care about me.

957
00:52:51,745 --> 00:52:53,080
And I'm not upset, Troll.

958
00:52:53,113 --> 00:52:56,550
Do you see how
not upset I am?

959
00:52:58,151 --> 00:53:01,555
Gene,
you came back for me.

960
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:03,124
You saved me.

961
00:53:03,156 --> 00:53:05,693
It wasn't just me.
Jailbreak helped, too.

962
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,628
And she's a hugger. Give her a squeeze.

963
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:08,796
No, no, no.

964
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:11,131
There really is
nothing greater

965
00:53:11,164 --> 00:53:13,767
than the feeling
of being truly free.

966
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:21,975
You filthy trolls,
I inhaled your stench,

967
00:53:22,008 --> 00:53:25,213
but I was once one of you,
so I, too, feel your pain.

968
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:27,048
Now go. Be free!

969
00:53:28,848 --> 00:53:30,251
Should be smooth
sailing from here.

970
00:53:42,196 --> 00:53:43,598
Gene.

971
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:48,736
Gene.

972
00:53:54,008 --> 00:53:55,676
Gene?

973
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:57,177
Are you Instagramming?

974
00:54:06,787 --> 00:54:08,557
Where is my Gene?

975
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:37,818
Mary.

976
00:54:37,852 --> 00:54:39,788
You've really
done it this time.

977
00:54:40,854 --> 00:54:42,022
No, you haven't.

978
00:54:42,055 --> 00:54:43,957
Mel?

979
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,994
What are you doing in Alex's
trip to France album?

980
00:54:47,028 --> 00:54:49,196
I was looking for you.

981
00:54:49,229 --> 00:54:51,698
None of this is
your fault, Mary.

982
00:54:51,731 --> 00:54:53,166
It's mine.

983
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,669
What do you mean?

984
00:55:00,408 --> 00:55:03,243
Is that a tear
on your cheek?

985
00:55:03,276 --> 00:55:06,246
It's my fault Gene
is the way he is.

986
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,249
I have other
expressions, too.

987
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:11,251
I think they've
just been buried away.

988
00:55:11,285 --> 00:55:16,057
But with Gene going missing and
thinking I might have lost you, too...

989
00:55:16,089 --> 00:55:19,926
Mel.
Why didn't you tell me?

990
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:22,863
I didn't know myself.

991
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:27,335
Right now, I'm so overwhelmed
with passionate feelings for you.

992
00:55:33,441 --> 00:55:37,145
Mary, my love for you
burns with the intensity

993
00:55:37,178 --> 00:55:39,347
of a red-hot flame.

994
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:40,981
I like that, Mel.

995
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:45,453
Let's go find our son.

996
00:55:45,486 --> 00:55:46,721
Together.

997
00:55:51,258 --> 00:55:53,261
We'll always have
Paris, Mary.

998
00:55:58,499 --> 00:56:00,267
So, you're a princess.

999
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:03,136
I saw your little tiara.
Very fancy.

1000
00:56:03,169 --> 00:56:05,405
Is it true when
a princess whistles,

1001
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:07,308
- birds fly down from...
- That's what I said!

1002
00:56:07,341 --> 00:56:09,810
No, guys!
That's a stupid myth!

1003
00:56:09,843 --> 00:56:12,412
What software version
are we living in?

1004
00:56:12,446 --> 00:56:14,015
Go read an e-book.

1005
00:56:14,048 --> 00:56:15,316
- Jailbreak...
- Educate yourselves.

1006
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:17,051
- Just look behind you.
- What the...

1007
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,455
What is that?

1008
00:56:21,488 --> 00:56:23,023
Smiler must have
upgraded her Bots.

1009
00:56:23,057 --> 00:56:24,158
Let's get out
of here before it...

1010
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:26,761

00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:39,339
<i>I'm gonna see you soon,

1016
00:56:39,372 --> 00:56:42,242
<i>We're actually gonna delete

1017
00:56:42,276 --> 00:56:44,278

1023
00:57:24,885 --> 00:57:26,053
Gene! This way!

1024
00:57:26,086 --> 00:57:27,155
- It's still after me!
- Over here!

1025
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:37,398
Let's go.

1026
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:41,268
We have to
make it to Dropbox.

1027
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:48,108
Yes!

1028
00:57:48,142 --> 00:57:49,778
- No!
- Go low!

1029
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:01,521
Don't worry.
It can't get in.

1030
00:58:01,555 --> 00:58:03,524
It's illegal malware,
and this app is secure.

1031
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:10,463

00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:20,073
You might want to hang on.

1036
00:58:20,106 --> 00:58:22,275
Why do they call
this Dropbox, anyway?

1037
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:24,312
This is why!
I see that now!

1038
00:58:27,414 --> 00:58:28,549
Yeah!

1039
00:58:32,385 --> 00:58:34,021
I think we're about to see
that candy corn again!

1040
00:58:39,459 --> 00:58:40,894
We made it.

1041
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,366
Guys, guys, chill. We still
have to get past that.

Yes, he has.

1086
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:47,120
Hi. When I was in the trash, I
read a very interesting e-mail,

1087
01:00:47,153 --> 01:00:50,724
but I'm just the dunce in the
corner, forbidden to speak.

1088
01:00:50,758 --> 01:00:52,727
- What e-mail?
- Sorry, what?

1089
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,060
What e-mail?

1090
01:00:54,093 --> 01:00:55,595
To a girl at school.

1091
01:00:55,629 --> 01:00:57,331
He was declaring his
feelings of love for her.

1092
01:00:57,363 --> 01:01:00,467
I guess instead of sending it,
he tossed it in the trash.

1093
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:02,435
Hi-5, this is very important.

1094
01:01:02,468 --> 01:01:04,104
What is her name?

1095
01:01:04,138 --> 01:01:06,207
Her name, yes.
Excellent question.

1096
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,676
It was Tina.

1097
01:01:08,709 --> 01:01:10,176

1101
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:19,119
I want to say Lupita,

1102
01:01:19,153 --> 01:01:21,522
but that doesn't feel right
now I'm saying it out loud.

lost in a place like this.

1125
01:02:43,604 --> 01:02:46,607

make you a Meh

comes back?

01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:52,647

We're gonna do that now?

1130
01:02:57,684 --> 01:03:00,754
Yeah, okay. Right.

I'll start hacking.

are coming true.

Hi-5, I just didn't expect to be
having these feelings right now.

1142
01:03:48,568 --> 01:03:51,505
Well, maybe you should go and
express them while you still can.

1143
01:03:57,243 --> 01:04:00,713

interesting emoji I've ever met.

1146
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:10,925
And after all
the adventures that we had,

1147
01:04:10,957 --> 01:04:13,193
I'm just not sure I
want all that to go away,

1148
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:17,731
because my feelings
right now are, like, huge.

1149
01:04:17,763 --> 01:04:21,702
I just think that they could be enough
for me to want to stay the way I am.

stay here with you.

1168

No! Gene!

1169
01:05:29,336 --> 01:05:31,405
Hi. I have an appointment.
I'm a little early.

1170
01:05:31,437 --> 01:05:32,872
No problem.
I can take you right now.

1175
01:06:01,734 --> 01:06:03,604
He left looking more meh than the
meh-est meh face I've ever seen.

1176
01:06:03,636 --> 01:06:04,937

1177
01:06:06,406 --> 01:06:08,342
It's what I didn't say.

1178
01:06:09,709 --> 01:06:11,611
We've got to go get him.

1179
01:06:11,644 --> 01:06:14,647
How are we gonna get in there

1180
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,751
I can't
believe I'm doing this.

1181
01:06:17,783 --> 01:06:20,953
You tell anyone you saw this, and
I'll crack more than those knuckles.

1184
01:07:05,798 --> 01:07:07,667
It's not a myth at all!

1185
01:07:09,903 --> 01:07:11,805
What happened to
becoming a favorite?

1186
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:13,973
Guess I'd rather
have one real friend.

1187
01:07:14,006 --> 01:07:15,642
And let's go get him.

1188
01:07:20,414 --> 01:07:22,716
I can't wait to see
the look on Gene's face!

1189
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:27,387
Look at that expression.

1190
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:33,826
Is that for realizing you've
put all of Textopolis at risk,

1191
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:36,430
causing Alex to
question our reliability?

1192
01:07:38,664 --> 01:07:41,167
Hey, that's going
too far, even for me.

1193
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,871
If we can delete this malfunction
before his appointment,

1194
01:07:44,905 --> 01:07:47,140
they'll discover there's
nothing wrong with the phone.

1195
01:07:47,173 --> 01:07:48,742
Any last words?

1196
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,544
Meh.

1197
01:07:51,577 --> 01:07:52,646
Well, it's too late for that.

1198
01:07:52,678 --> 01:07:54,781
- Delete him!
- Wait.

1199
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:01,421
You delete Gene, you'll
have to delete me, too.

1200
01:08:01,455 --> 01:08:04,725
- What?
- I have the same malfunction Gene does.

1201
01:08:08,093 --> 01:08:09,596
Dad?

1202
01:08:09,628 --> 01:08:11,731
Gosh,
I don't know what to do.

1203
01:08:11,765 --> 01:08:12,865
Yes, I do.

1204
01:08:12,899 --> 01:08:13,868
Bot!

1205
01:08:15,601 --> 01:08:16,702
No!

1206
01:08:16,735 --> 01:08:18,704
Sorry, Mrs. Meh.

1207
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:26,613
I did not see
that one coming.

1208
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:28,214
Smiler, I think
you might be making

1209
01:08:28,248 --> 01:08:29,950
too much stink
out of all this.

1210
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:33,119
Really?
How about you're next?

1211
01:08:36,222 --> 01:08:38,124
I was wrong, Gene.

1212
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,894
I should've believed
in you all along.

1213
01:08:40,927 --> 01:08:44,164
What a touching
daddy-son reunion moment.

1214
01:08:44,196 --> 01:08:46,732
It reminds me of
the time I deleted you both.

1215
01:08:46,766 --> 01:08:48,769
Wait. That's this time!

1216
01:08:48,802 --> 01:08:50,871
Delete the two malfunctions!

1217
01:08:53,073 --> 01:08:53,973
No.

1218
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:58,912
How's that for an...

1219
01:09:07,587 --> 01:09:08,856
Great.

1220
01:09:19,533 --> 01:09:21,068
I can't reach!

1221
01:09:35,582 --> 01:09:38,718
No! What did you
do to my beautiful...

1222
01:09:38,752 --> 01:09:41,120
My tooth.

1223
01:09:44,658 --> 01:09:45,825
Hand, button.

1224
01:09:48,695 --> 01:09:50,564
Jailbreak?

1225
01:09:50,596 --> 01:09:51,664
Gene.

1226
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,569
You really are a Meh.

1227
01:09:55,601 --> 01:09:57,837
What happened to looking out
for number one?

1228
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:00,140
Being number
one doesn't matter

1229
01:10:00,172 --> 01:10:02,008
if there aren't
any other numbers.

1230
01:10:04,811 --> 01:10:05,846
Alex's appointment!

1231
01:10:05,878 --> 01:10:07,314
He's deleting the phone!

1232
01:10:07,346 --> 01:10:09,550
No, no, no!

1233
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:11,051
Show me Alex.

1234
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,155
<i>Are you sure you
want to delete everything?</i>

1235
01:10:16,189 --> 01:10:16,990
<i>Do it.</i>

1236
01:10:22,329 --> 01:10:24,264
Red alert! Red alert!

1237
01:10:24,297 --> 01:10:25,866
Alex, no!

1238
01:10:33,272 --> 01:10:34,874
<i>Game over.</i>

1239
01:10:37,343 --> 01:10:40,580
Fellas, I'm afraid
this is last call.

1240
01:10:40,614 --> 01:10:43,617
Dude, Addie's here.
You should go over.

1241
01:10:46,953 --> 01:10:49,957
Every time I try,
I screw it up.

1242
01:10:49,989 --> 01:10:52,191
<i>I don't know how to
tell her how I feel.</i>

1243
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:55,662
If we help Alex connect to
Addie, maybe he won't delete us.

1244
01:10:55,695 --> 01:10:58,265
I might be able to bypass the wipe
and get a text through to him.

1245
01:10:58,297 --> 01:11:00,032
But we'll only
have time to send one.

1246
01:11:00,065 --> 01:11:01,167
Maybe I should go.

1247
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,136
He has love in his eyes.

1248
01:11:03,168 --> 01:11:05,872
Send me.
Alex looks nervous, too.

1249
01:11:05,904 --> 01:11:07,873
He's more shy than nervous.

1250
01:11:07,906 --> 01:11:08,909
Stop!

1251
01:11:10,744 --> 01:11:11,979
It's Gene.

1252
01:11:12,012 --> 01:11:15,015
He's all of those things.

1253
01:11:15,047 --> 01:11:17,650
An emoji
should only be one thing.

1254
01:11:17,684 --> 01:11:18,885
Really?

1255
01:11:20,052 --> 01:11:21,320
The Princess!

1256
01:11:21,354 --> 01:11:22,756
Linda!

1257
01:11:22,788 --> 01:11:24,690
Not now, Mom!

1258
01:11:24,723 --> 01:11:26,994
Gene, you got this.

1259
01:11:28,427 --> 01:11:30,129
That's not me anymore.

1260
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:40,106
But I have to try.

1261
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,142
It's starting!

1262
01:11:42,175 --> 01:11:43,610
No, it's ending!

1263
01:12:02,128 --> 01:12:04,131
- Almost in?
- I'm working on it.

1264
01:12:07,467 --> 01:12:08,402
Mom? Dad?

1265
01:12:10,336 --> 01:12:11,137
No.

1266
01:12:11,904 --> 01:12:14,240
I'm in.

1267
01:12:14,274 --> 01:12:17,310
Last time I was in this cube,
I screwed everything up.

1268
01:12:17,342 --> 01:12:20,913
Gene, why do you
think I came back?

1269
01:12:20,946 --> 01:12:22,016
It's because of you.

1270
01:12:23,115 --> 01:12:25,118
Me?

1271
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:27,220
It's all inside of you, Gene.

1272
01:12:27,253 --> 01:12:29,123
Just try to bring it back.

1273
01:12:30,089 --> 01:12:31,925
And do you.

1274
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:34,026
Hi-5!

1275
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,095
I don't want to wave good-bye.

1276
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:37,698
It's now or never, Gene.

1277
01:13:00,887 --> 01:13:01,922
Jailbreak, now!

1278
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:19,772
Check out this emoji.

1279
01:13:33,418 --> 01:13:35,454
No way.

1280
01:13:50,936 --> 01:13:52,538
Hey, I got your text.

1281
01:13:52,571 --> 01:13:55,208
That's one super-cool emoji.

1282
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,077
I know, right?

1283
01:13:58,811 --> 01:14:01,981
A lot of feelings in one.
I get it.

1284
01:14:02,015 --> 01:14:03,984
I like that you're
one of those guys

1285
01:14:04,016 --> 01:14:05,818
who can actually
express his feelings.

1286
01:14:05,851 --> 01:14:07,820
Yeah.
That's me.

1287
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:17,798
- So, do you think you'd want to...
- Yes.

1288
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,133
I'd love to go to
the dance with you.

1289
01:14:22,368 --> 01:14:23,771
Hey, excuse me.

1290
01:14:50,363 --> 01:14:52,097
We made it!

1291
01:14:52,131 --> 01:14:53,934
I could've lost you,
Peter Pinkie.

1292
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:55,435
Or you, Reggie Ring Finger.

1293
01:14:55,467 --> 01:14:57,171
Even you, Tiberius Thumb.

1294
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:06,012
Change your mind?

1295
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:07,847
Yeah, maybe
it's weird, but...

01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:09,115

1297
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:12,152

1298
01:15:12,185 --> 01:15:13,986
