you to stay here tonight.

Come now, my good man.
You can't frighten us.

21

28

Well, doctor, for one who
is not afraid of the dark,

29
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:10,021
you have been pushing
your horse pretty fast.

30

Oh, I admit, I was a bit impatient...

33
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:23,301
I mean, hungry... for one
of your wonderful meals.

34
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:26,838
Yes. The vampires are
hungry, too, for their supper.

That's where they live... in their coffins,

these little wounds on his throat

75
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:57,488

I have seen such marks in these parts.

Sir karell dismissed you
at 9:15 last night.

Yes, Mr. Inspector.
Yes.

80

A bat was fluttering against my window,

Why didn't you come to the
castle at once when jan telephoned?

89
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:30,355
Because jan told me sir
karell was already dead.

90
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:32,190

of food. I couldn't.

00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:29,814
Oh! Where have you been? I've been
making enough noise to raise the dead.

113
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,983
Oh, don't, fedor.
Don't.

114
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,752

What's happened?

me something about him.

119

Who? Fedor? Miss borotyn's
fiance, Mr. Vincenty from Prague.

120

His family... wealthy?

121
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:56,241
Moderately. Why?

122
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,243
With sir karell out of the way,

123
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,912
miss borotyn will come
into quite a bit of money.

124
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,014
Surely you can't suspect fedor.

125
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,616
What are miss borotyn's immediate plans?

126
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:09,887
Why, naturally she'll be
moving next-door to my place,

127
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,422
I being her guardian.

128
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,858
Oh. Her guardian.

129
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:14,926
Why, yes.

130
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:16,661
And being her guardian,

131
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:19,530
naturally you'll be the
sole executor of her estate.

132
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:22,400
Yes. Why?
What's wrong?

133
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:25,803
Oh, I see. I'm under suspicion, too.

134
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,739
In such cases, everyone's under suspicion.

135
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:30,641
The idea of talking to me

136
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,112
as though I were one of
his common policemen!

137
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,581
Old wives' tales!

138
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:38,549
Look for the cause of death...

139
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:41,619
real, not supernatural.

140
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,054
Why...

141
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:54,599
Aah! What?

142
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:55,967
Look!

143
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:18,689
Well, doctor.
What have you found?

144
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:23,461
Inspector, the examination
fully confirms my diagnosis.

145
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:26,297
Those marks are the only sign of violence.

146
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:28,366
Had sir karell been ailing of late?

147
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,501
No. On the contrary,
he enjoyed good health,

148
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:32,370
except for a slightly sluggish heart.

149
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,305
You prescribed for that?

150
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:35,406
Naturally.

151
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:38,176
Ah. Well, I shall
want an autopsy.

152
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,178
Of course that will be done,

153
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,447
but I am positive the cause of his death

154
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:44,449
is told by those little wounds.

155
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:46,284
Surely, doctor, a man of your learning

156
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,019
does not believe in vampires.

157
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,520
Then how do you account

158
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:52,357
for his body being drained dry of blood?

159
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,761
Yes, Mr. Coroner,

160
00:09:56,827 --> 00:10:01,766
and tonight farmer narotni
was found dead in the road.

161
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:07,038
Count mora and his daughter
were seen again near the castle.

162
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,640
Oh. Piffle! Superstitious twaddle!

163
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:10,975
Dr. Doskil.

164
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,410
Yes.

165
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:14,879
You have examined the
body of this farmer, too.

166
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:17,648
I did. Ahem. The corpse
was drained of blood.

167
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:22,420
There were the same marks
that I found on sir karell's throat.

168
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,423
And you have seen this
count mora and his daughter?

169
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,093
No, sir.
When I saw them,

170
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,229
they was in form of bats.

171
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,898
These poor, deluded creatures believe

172
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:36,234
that vampires change themselves into bats

173
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,903
and back again into human form.

174
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:40,004
How versatile.

175
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:42,573
Really, Mr. Coroner.

176
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,377
"Poor, deluded creatures."
Oh, I must protest.

177
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:49,314
I hold a degree from the medical faculty

178
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,150
sit down.
Of the univers...

179
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,252
do you want to make your township

180
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,886
and this court ridiculous?

181
00:10:55,953 --> 00:11:00,057
Forget your absurd old
superstitions. This is 1934.

182
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,193
Ladies and gentlemen,

183
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,130
I think that under existing circumstances,

184
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:08,133
the decision of this inquest must be

185
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,136
that sir karell borotyn met his death

186
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,638
from cause or causes unknown.

187
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,543
[Women singing]

188
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,986
Darling, they're doing all this for you.

189
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:31,088
Doesn't it make you happy?

190
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:33,924
Why...

191
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:36,127
Why, dear, you're crying.

192
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:38,329
Bars, please drive on.

193
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:49,540
I'm sorry, dear. I didn't
mean to make you sad.

194
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:53,178
Forgive me, fedor, for being so moody,

195
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:56,214
but seeing them all dancing

196
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:58,716
suddenly brought it all back...

197
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:02,720
How father used to tell me
that at my wedding feast,

198
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,722
all the villagers and peasants

199
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:06,924
from miles around would come,

200
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:09,760
and they'd sing and dance.

201
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,231
Oh, fedor...

202
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:16,634
He had it all planned.

203
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,869
Now he isn't here.

204
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:22,740
Darling, I'll always try to make you

205
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:25,410
as happy as your father wanted you to be.

206
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,816
The villagers and peasants would be
quite satisfied with wine of the country.

207
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,508
It is just what sir karell would have done.

208
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:34,785
Yes, sir, but for one thing.

209
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,221
What's that?

210
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,923
He would have had the
wedding feast at the castle.

211
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:41,726
Come, jan. Do you think
miss irena could bear

212
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,928
to go back there after
that dreadful tragedy?

213
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:45,663
I suppose not, sir,

214
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,132
but it's heartbreaking to
see the place neglected,

215
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:51,068
rain and sleet entering
through the broken windows.

216
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:52,703
I know how you feel.

217
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,207
Recheck your list. Be sure
we've got enough of everything.

218
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:07,318
But you must remember,
life goes on, my dear.

219
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:11,055
Your father wouldn't want these
days of all days to be clouded for you.

220
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:15,092
I know. I feel ashamed of the
way I acted with fedor last night,

221
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,428
but it all seemed to sweep over me again.

222
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,864
Well, no more of that, young lady.

223
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,167
If I remember correctly, we
have a wedding to prepare for.

224
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:25,169
Irena: Fedor!

225
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:28,373
Fedor! Oh, darling, what's the
matter? Annie, some water, quick!

226
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,108
What is it, fedor? What happened to you?

227
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:34,745
I don't know.
I can't remember.

228
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:37,448
I was running to the train,

229
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:41,118
and then by the castle I fell.

230
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:43,721
I... i must have
struck my head.

231
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:47,458
Oh, you poor dear.
Here. Drink this.

232
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:51,529
Fedor, you say you fell by the castle?

233
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:55,132
When I came to, it was dawn.

234
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,135
I was too weak to move.

235
00:13:58,202 --> 00:13:59,837
I just lay there.

236
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,372
It seems...

237
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:05,142
It seemed hours before I was able to...

238
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:06,811
To drag myself here.

239
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:09,914
Irena: Annie, the
doctor, quick. Dr. Doskil.

240
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:14,652
Fedor, those wounds... like father's!

241
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:19,357
Annie: Aah! Vampires! Vampires!
Let me out of here!

242
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:29,367
[Soft, ghostly moaning]

243
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,470
[Bats squeaking]

244
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:38,969
Man: Hyah!

245
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:39,804
Hyah!

246
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,673
Woman:
Aah! Slow down!

247
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,608
Slower!

248
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:44,975
Are you trying to kill me?

249
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,844
Let go. Let go.

250
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:50,648
Slow down! Slow down! I'm
not going to be upset in no ditch!

251
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:54,885
And I'm going to tell the baron
how you've been beating his horse.

252
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:58,055
It's all your fault, taking so
much time over your beer.

253
00:15:58,122 --> 00:16:00,725
I told you we had to
get home before sunset.

254
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,359
Why afraid of the dark?

255
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:03,861
The darkness won't hurt us.

256
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:06,531
If you wake up dead in the morning

257
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,766
your body drained dry of blood,

258
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,001
you'd be afraid of the dark.

259
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,876
Afraid of the dark.

260
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,684
[Woman screams]

261
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,486
Oh! Oh!

262
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,054
Heaven... heaven protect us!

263
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,389
Oh, heaven!
I've been a good girl.

264
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:35,526
I've been a good girl all
my life. Don't let her get me.

265
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:37,194
[Branch cracks]
Aah!

266
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:38,496
Giddy-up!

267
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:48,739
Woman: We must see him.
Jan: But you can't disturb him now.

268
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:53,478
Woman: He must be told what we saw! Jan:
Once and for all, you cannot disturb him now!

269
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,179
What is this?!

270
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:58,115
The castle, sir! It's
haunted, sir! Dead people.

271
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,517
Shh! Jan,
close the door.

272
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:00,918
We saw them.

273
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:01,819
Yes, we did, sir.

274
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:03,320
Keep quiet.
I'll explain.

275
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:05,222
Some real-estate brokers from Prague...

276
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:08,959
no, no. We saw a woman, a
dead woman in her grave clothes.

277
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:11,195
That's enough. What you probably saw was

278
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:13,564
one of the brokers' clients
inspecting the castle.

279
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,600
The place is being shown for rent.

280
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,434
Excuse me, sir.
I'm new here.

281
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:20,170
Otto: I want no more disturbances
in this house, understand?

282
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:21,739
Yes, sir.

283
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:24,475
Miss irena has gone
through enough excitement.

284
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,712
No, sir. Yes, sir.
I'll keep my tongue.

285
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:41,051
[Clock striking]

286
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:43,921
[Woman screams]

287
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:51,729
Jan: What is it?
What is it, sir?

288
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,931
[Woman screams]

289
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:57,534
[Screaming]

290
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:58,936
Otto: What
happened to her?

291
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:01,606
Woman: I don't know.
I couldn't find her.

292
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:02,907
What happened?

293
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:04,041
I don't know!

294
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,680
I felt her deadly cold breath on my throat.

295
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:12,282
I must have fainted.

296
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:14,551
I knew no more.

297
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:39,143
Colleague, your diagnosis is correct.

298
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:41,211
Professor zelen.

299
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:48,185
Gentlemen, I've spent
my life in the study of, uh...

300
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:55,626
Uh, miss borotyn, will
you excuse us, please?

301
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:59,196
May we continue our talk in another room?

302
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,576
Maid.

303
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,578
Yes, sir? Yes, sir?

304
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:17,748
Go to miss borotyn.
Stay with her.

305
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:21,051
Under no circumstances leave her.

306
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:22,687
No, sir.

307
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:27,424
Professor zelen, why all this secrecy?

308
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:31,295
I broke off my sentence
for miss borotyn's sake.

309
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:33,864
There is no more foul

310
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:37,434
or relentless enemy of man
in the occult world

311
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:43,407
than this dead-alive creature
spewed up from the grave.

312
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:45,009
True, true.

313
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:48,946
This attack by a beautiful
woman on miss borotyn

314
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:53,550
goes far to confirm
the legend of the castle.

315
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:56,653
Who else could it have been but...

316
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:58,488
the daughter of count mora.

317
00:20:58,555 --> 00:20:59,656
Exactly.

318
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:01,692
My very own conclusion, professor.

319
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,694
What is your advice?

320
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,563
We can't undo what's been done.

321
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,801
Miss borotyn is in danger
of repeated attacks.

322
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:13,470
[Knock on door]

323
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:15,873
[Knocking]

324
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,408
Come in, please.

325
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,850
It's inspector neumann.
Excuse me.

326
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:30,587
Uh, baron Otto, I must speak to
inspector neumann before he leaves.

327
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:33,724
Maid: Please. You
should be lying down.

328
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,861
Miss borotyn! [Gasp] You
must come away from there.

329
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,229
I'm afraid you treat me like an invalid.

330
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:42,432
Maid, quick,
the doors. The windows.

331
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:45,836
I want everything closed
and fastened securely.

332
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:48,672
Every moment counts.
Run along, now.

333
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:50,307
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

334
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:52,476
Oh, Dr. Doskil.

335
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:57,614
There's a certain thorny
weed that grows in these parts.

336
00:21:57,681 --> 00:21:58,949
Yes, yes.
Bat Thorn.

337
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,517
That's it.
That's it.

338
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:04,088
I want you to get me
some, if you will, please.

339
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:06,090
We'll have to work fast.

340
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:08,292
The sun will soon be down.

341
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:10,027
Yes.
Very good, sir.

342
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:14,169
With my permission, a broker
in Prague leased the castle.

343
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:17,201
Look. Look at the signature of the tenant.

344
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:23,107
Karell borotyn. Hmm.
Some relative, no doubt.

345
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:25,009
No, no.
It's karell himself.

346
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:26,176
What's wrong with you, man?

347
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:28,245
Sir karell's been dead for a year.

348
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:31,048
It's his signature, I tell you.
I know it as well as my own.

349
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:33,150
Zelen: Ah,
inspector neumann!

350
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:36,486
Your arrival is providential.

351
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:40,624
Baron, we need his help in the worst way.

352
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:46,330
Inspector, miss borotyn has
been attacked by a vampire.

353
00:22:46,396 --> 00:22:49,166
Well, I suppose coming
from you this is no joke.

354
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:51,535
But you know I don't
believe in such things.

355
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:53,337
Why have you sent for me?

356
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:55,605
Why were you instrumental
in bringing me down here?

357
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,341
Please, professor.
No argument.

358
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:00,110
I can't stand any more
of this. I'm too excited.

359
00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:01,445
I beg your pardon, baron.

360
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:02,913
Sorry, baron.

361
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,315
I'll tell you why I brought
you here, professor.

362
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:07,417
I thought you'd help me uncover the truth.

363
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:09,786
Why, the facts speak for themselves.

364
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:11,655
There have been 3 attacks.

365
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:13,457
Sir karell is dead.

366
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:17,561
Miss borotyn and her
fiance lie within the shadow

367
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:19,496
of worse than death.

368
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:24,001
The vampire is a pestilence that grows.

369
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,536
Each victim that it kills

370
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:29,606
itself becomes a vampire.

371
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:31,608
A corpse by day,

372
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:34,044
at night it leaves its coffin

373
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:36,680
to sustain its unnatural life

374
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:39,683
on the blood of the living.

375
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:44,588
Inspector, we must protect
this house with bat Thorn

376
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:46,991
to prevent their entrance.

377
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:50,060
Baron, I have sent for a supply.

378
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:52,096
If you will pardon me,

379
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:54,264
I'll see if it's arrived.

380
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,303
Inspector, do you really think...

381
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:02,873
zelen: Miss borotyn, you
should not be down here.

382
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,443
You must not disregard my warnings.

383
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,380
But I heard a voice...
Outside, calling me.

384
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:13,117
It's your weakened condition, child.

385
00:24:13,183 --> 00:24:17,121
No. No, it sounded like
father. Father's voice.

386
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:20,857
Come. I'll take you
back to your room.

387
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:23,627
Did you hear what she said?

388
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:25,362
Her father's voice.

389
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,501
Hysteria.

390
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:34,104
I place no stock in it.

391
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:35,940
His signature...

392
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:37,942
His signature on that lease.

393
00:24:38,008 --> 00:24:40,477
Now, don't you start
believing that nonsense.

394
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:44,048
Dead people don't leave their graves.

395
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:45,682
But, inspector, we must make sure

396
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:48,518
that sir karell's body
is still in its coffin.

397
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:49,903
Irena: Fedor, you're not well enough.
You promised me not to come tonight.

398
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:55,785
Fedor: What are you trying to
keep from me? Who is this man?

399
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:57,754
Oh, I'm sorry.

400
00:25:57,821 --> 00:25:59,923
Professor zelen.

401
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,726
Professor,
Mr. Vincenty.

402
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:06,796
You've been so ill, dear, we
thought it best not to let you know,

403
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:08,398
but now that you're here...

404
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:11,935
please, please. You'll
overtax your strength.

405
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:14,404
Mr. Vincenty,

406
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:17,941
miss borotyn must be spared all excitement.

407
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:21,811
She's passed through a terrible ordeal.

408
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:26,416
Like you, she was attacked by the vampire.

409
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:28,818
The vampire?!

410
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:30,920
Zelen:
She must have rest.

411
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:34,758
Fedor: She'll get rest. I'm taking
her away from here tonight... now.

412
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:39,496
Mr. Vincenty, if you
interfere with my plans,

413
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:44,934
if you disobey me, my
work will be destroyed,

414
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:48,472
for... it's not only
your lives,

415
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:51,508
your souls are at stake.

416
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:57,681
We must all die. There's
nothing terrible about death.

417
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:02,086
But to live on after death,

418
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,888
a soul earthbound...

419
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:06,323
a vampire...

420
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,160
you don't wish any such
fate for your beloved.

421
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:11,561
Fedor: No.
Of course not.

422
00:27:11,628 --> 00:27:14,864
Of course not. Then you must leave with me.

423
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:17,067
I'm not leaving here.

424
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:21,405
Please, dear.
Do as he says.

425
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:23,073
I'm so tired.

426
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,608
Good night.

427
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:26,076
Zelen: Maid! Maid!

428
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:27,611
Come here, please.

429
00:27:27,677 --> 00:27:29,413
Yes, sir? Yes, sir?

430
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:33,783
I want you and the Butler

431
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,453
to place some of this bat Thorn

432
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,156
in every room on this
floor, you understand?

433
00:27:39,223 --> 00:27:40,624
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

434
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,758
Go along.

435
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:45,629
Come, young man.

436
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:52,436
Aah! Don't do that.

437
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:54,138
He wants some of this put

438
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:55,705
in every room in the house.

439
00:27:55,772 --> 00:27:57,107
Yes. You.

440
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:59,643
No. We.

441
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,183
The vampire's power
prevails during the hours

442
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:12,656
between sunset and sunrise,
when it leaves its coffin...

443
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:13,257
[door opens]

444
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:15,959
Otto: Professor...

445
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,585
We've just come from sir karell's tomb.

446
00:28:17,627 --> 00:28:19,629
Inspector:
The coffin was empty.

447

Aah!

451
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:31,608
Fedor:
Irena! Irena!

452
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:33,543
Fedor! Fedor!

453
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,912
Fedor: Darling,
what happened?

454
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,714
Irena: Oh, my dear!

455
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:39,783
Stop gibbering. What are you trying to say?

456
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:42,352
Maid: It was terrible!
It was awful!

457
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,554
Zelen: Quiet, please.
One at a time.

458
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:46,556
Speak up. Tell me what happened.

459
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:49,926
Yes. We were told to put some
of the bat Thorn in every room.

460
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:53,830
We'd just come out of that
door and started down the hall...

461
00:28:55,265 --> 00:28:56,666
It's a horrible business.

462
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,868
I wish he'd hung the
beastly stuff up himself.

463
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:00,404
We'll get it over with...

464
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:19,423
[Maid screams]

465
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,227
H-he was there, coming towards us!

466
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:26,796
Yes, yes! He had
a white face...

467
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:28,798
A dead-white face

468
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:30,600
with burning eyes

469
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,303
and a ghastly wound on his head.

470
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,038
Zelen: It was
count mora.

471
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,104
Yes! Yes!

472
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:37,907
Have you been drinking?

473
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:39,609
No. No, sir.

474
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:45,215
If I have, I hope to choke on the next one.

475
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:48,618
This is no time for levity.

476
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:50,220
The vampire,

477
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:53,523
he is still somewhere within this house.

478
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,360
Young man, place some
bat Thorn at this door

479
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:57,961
and lock it securely.

480
00:29:58,027 --> 00:29:59,128
Fedor: Yes, sir.

481
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:02,131
Maid, Butler, search the rooms

482
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:03,633
at that end of the house.

483
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,803
You mean...
G-go into those rooms?

484
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,171
Zelen:
Yes, you idiot!

485
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:09,406
Inspector: Hurry!

486
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:12,141
Baron Otto, we must drive him out of here.

487
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:16,280
Quick, inspector, we must
search the rooms at this end.

488
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:20,684
Zelen: In that room, baron.

489
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,853
Quick, inspector.
We've no time to lose.

Otto: Inspector,
what is it?

494
00:30:34,998 --> 00:30:36,633
He got through the window.

495
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,068
Zelen: Baron! Inspector!
Come here.

496
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:40,637
Please. Quick.

497
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:43,106
Inspector: What is it,
professor? What is it?

498
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:44,608
Zelen: Look.

499
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:49,313
Was that he...

500
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:51,047
The last one?

501
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:52,549
Who?

502
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:55,051
Sir karell... her father.

503
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:56,453
Her father?

504
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,990
Why, yes. Didn't you find his coffin empty?

505
00:31:01,057 --> 00:31:03,092
No, no. I can't
believe that.

506
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:04,928
I won't believe that.

507
00:31:04,994 --> 00:31:06,863
Inspector, please hurry.

508
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:11,000
Place this at these doors.
I'll attend to the others.

509

Otto: Professor.

510
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,770
Baron, a moment.

511
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,473
Baron, there are things
going on in this house

512
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,907
that I don't like.

513
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:19,476
What do you mean?

514
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:22,346
This weed. The way the professor's acting.

515
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:24,080
I don't like it.

516
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:28,017
And I'm bewildered. I no
longer know what to think.

517
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:30,320
Irena: I'm afraid, fedor...
Afraid to close my eyes.

518

to be afraid of.

519
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,959
We'll be here with you watching over you.

520

We must go.

We can't remain here.
She must have quiet.

522

exhausted body demands it.

will be here with you.

524
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:55,044

between now and morning.

525
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:57,647
Dismiss all fear from your mind.

00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:22,499
It's sir karell.

533
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:26,703
Are you sure? Are you sure it's sir karell?

534
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,971
Yes.

535
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:47,123
Midnight will soon be spent
and nothing accomplished.

536
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,870
Are we going to sit here and think,
or are we going to do something?

537
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:52,228
Incredible.
Incredible.

538
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:53,630
Inspector: Oh!

539
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:01,170
If sir karell...

540
00:34:01,237 --> 00:34:04,541
I still maintain miss
borotyn's the only one

541
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:05,408
who can influence her father.

542
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:06,943
Are you mad?

543
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,779
Good heavens, no! Can't you understand?

544
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:11,548
She mustn't even know her father's there.

545
00:34:11,615 --> 00:34:13,049
Of course not!

546
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:14,273
Vampires or no vampires, I'm going to...

547
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:15,351
what are you going to do?

548
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,553
Call headquarters for help.

549
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,388
Yes. Surround the place.
Set fire to it.

550
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:21,190
Fire.

551
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:26,295
An army of police, a hurricane
of bullets would do no good.

552
00:34:26,362 --> 00:34:30,333
You seem to forget that
during the hours of darkness,

553
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,471
the vampire can't even be
harmed, let alone destroyed.

554
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:38,141
If they can't be destroyed,
then we're wasting time.

555
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:41,344
I didn't say they couldn't be destroyed.

556
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,679
They can.

557
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,348
By day, the vampires must return

558
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:48,151
to the ground in which they were buried...

559
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:51,788
or else find shelter
in some accursed retreat.

560
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:54,023
It is then they are powerless.

561
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,593
Otto: Then we must leave
at daybreak.

562
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,628
It's our chance to get away from here.

563
00:34:58,695 --> 00:35:00,764
What? And leave
these monsters here

564
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,232
to continue their work of destruction?

565
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:04,701
It would be cowardice.

566
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:06,836
Inspector: What else is there to do?

567
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:10,640
Search for them. Find
their corpselike bodies.

568
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,642
It is in that state,

569
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:15,912
and that state only, they can be destroyed.

570
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:20,449
Their heads must be
severed with one clean stroke

571
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:24,854
and a sprig of bat Thorn
placed within the gaping wound.

572
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:28,257
Otto: We would be crazy
to attempt what you're planning.

573
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:30,727
I'll never do it.
Never.

574
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:32,395
In the morning, we're leaving.

575
00:35:32,461 --> 00:35:34,297
I agree with you.

576
00:35:34,363 --> 00:35:36,566
Yes? Yes.

577
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:40,604
2:30.

578
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,673
In 3 hours, it will be daylight.

579
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,675
Oh, thank heaven the house

580
00:35:45,742 --> 00:35:48,144
is well-protected for the night.

581
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:51,881
Come, gentlemen, let's
go to bed and get some rest.

582
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:21,310
[Door closes]

583
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,832
I had gone to bed as you said.

584
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:45,835
I laid here for hours
trying to go to sleep,

585
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:48,204
but I was restless.
I couldn't.

586
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:51,908
Then I heard Maria leave the room.

587
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:55,044
Why did you leave the
room? You had your orders.

588
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:57,981
To get some coffee to keep me awake.

589
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:00,449
Ah, you fool.

590
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:04,854
But after Maria left the
room, then what happened?

591
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:08,524
I heard a sound, like wind at the casement.

592
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:12,561
I felt a draft.
Then I saw her,

593
00:37:12,628 --> 00:37:15,932
just as she was on the terrace.

594
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:20,003
I fought to keep my eyes
open, but they closed.

595
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:23,406
I felt again that deadly cold breath.

596
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:26,342
The horror of it...

597
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:28,745
Made me feel faint.

598
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:31,414
There, there, my child.

599
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:48,898
That young man...
go to him. Hurry.

600
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:54,670
That cross I told you to wear.

601
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:56,706
Maid, get it immediately.

602
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,507
Put it about her neck.

603
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:00,009
Wake up!
Come on!

604
00:38:00,076 --> 00:38:03,713
What? What's the matter?
What's wrong?

605
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,315
Fedor, are you all right?

606
00:38:06,382 --> 00:38:09,819
Something's wrong. Irena!
What's happened to her?

607
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:12,388
Mr. Vincenty,
quiet, please.

608
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,123
Fedor, irena, she's been...

609
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,558
zelen: Shh!

610
00:38:15,624 --> 00:38:19,362
Miss borotyn is asleep.

611
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:22,198
Quick, inspector, close that door, please.

612
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:25,034
Fedor: W-why
are you here?

613
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:27,436
We've been watching through the night,

614
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:29,438
but now the dawn is here.

615
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:33,877
We wanted to be sure that
you were safe before we retired.

616
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,879
I... i feel drowsy.

617
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:38,147
I must have fallen sound asleep.

618
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:41,417
Sound? You were in a
stupor. We had to shake you.

619
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:42,852
Stupor?

620
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:47,857
Tell me.

621
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:52,028
Uh, this deep sleep, did it refresh you?

622
00:38:52,095 --> 00:38:54,230
Why, yes.
Why do you ask?

623
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:57,967
What are you doing?

624
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:01,504
I just wanted to look at
the wounds on your neck.

625
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:20,890
That deep sleep was unnatural.

626
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:23,159
Fortunately, he wasn't harmed.

627
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:26,162
When the maid screamed out to us,

628
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:30,433
it must have frightened the monster away.

629
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:34,403
Gentlemen, we must face the truth,

630
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,974
the horrible truth.

631
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:41,177
Miss borotyn is in their power.

632
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:45,181
To save her, we must break the spell.

633
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:49,585
If we don't succeed in destroying
those monsters by sundown,

634
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:50,987
we may be too late.

635
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:52,721
Quick, get into your clothes.

636
00:39:52,788 --> 00:39:53,990
Come, baron!

637
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:17,446
Otto: Professor?

638
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:22,886
Inspector:
Professor zelen.

639
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:26,489
Uh, in here, inspector!

640
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:29,192
Have you searched thoroughly above?

641
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:30,426
Yes.

642
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:32,962
Not so much as a Mark
on the dust-covered floor.

643
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:34,797
It's the same over there at the organ,

644
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:36,799
where you saw sir karell playing.

645
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:40,369
The dust lies thick and undisturbed.

646
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:44,540
That's what makes it so difficult
to find the vampire's hiding place.

647
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:46,032
Well, don't let's stand here talking.

648
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,510
Let's go on looking for them.

649
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:50,546
You're quite right, inspector.
Have you some matches?

650
00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:51,847
Here.

651
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:53,049
Oh, look.

652
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:56,953
No, no, no, no, no!
Up there on the rod.

[Squeaking]

654
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:07,130
Stop, you fool! Would you
destroy what might give us a clue?

655
00:41:07,196 --> 00:41:09,665
Inspector: Smash it!
Take no chances.

656
00:41:09,732 --> 00:41:11,700
No, that would do no good.

657
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:14,703
It's only in its own corpselike state

658
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,840
that it can be destroyed.

659
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:19,242
Now...

660
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:24,413
We must search the
vaults beneath the old ruins.

661
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,052
Come. We have not much
time left before sunset.

662
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:31,054
You have the matches, inspector?

663
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,321
Yes, professor.

Quick, inspector.
Get the candle.

gone mad?

don't leave him like this.

the vengeance of the others?

us to the ends of the earth.

all together.

come with me. I won't leave you.

Oh, miss, you know the
professor said that you...

712
00:46:11,467 --> 00:46:13,402
go away, Maria.
Leave us alone.

You can go. I'm with her.

718
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:25,581
Irena, I've got to know
why you're acting like this.

719
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:27,783
What are you hiding from me?

720
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,117
Don't ask me, please.

721
00:46:29,184 --> 00:46:30,953
But I have a right to know.

722
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:34,590
There's something wrong
with you. You're not yourself.

that I'm losing you.

726
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,505
Fedor, forgive me.

727
00:46:49,572 --> 00:46:52,107
Forgive me for what I'm doing.

Tell me.

Be brave, my child.

I'll try.

you describe...

your lifelong and devoted friend...

744
00:48:27,536 --> 00:48:30,906
you could go to him.
You could appeal to him.

745
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:33,476

than I can endure.

if we confronted him with this
gentleman pretending to be my father.

773
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,221
I know. We all thought our vampire scheme

774

was so simple, so certain of success.

Oh, no, no, no, my dear
child. You must be courageous.

I admit what we're trying
to do is only an experiment,

799
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:09,825
but I feel certain now that
we have the baron hypnotized,

800

00:58:23,431 --> 00:58:26,501
Inspector: Cut!
Don't move, baron!

889
00:58:28,903 --> 00:58:33,608
Zelen: Look at me. Look
me in the eye, baron.

890
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:35,077
That's it.

891
00:58:35,143 --> 00:58:38,613
Everything is getting cloudy.

892
00:58:40,682 --> 00:58:42,617
Cloudy.

893
00:58:42,684 --> 00:58:45,687
You understand?

894
00:58:45,753 --> 00:58:49,724
You are returning...

895
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,594
Returning to the present.

896
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,862
You understand?

897
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:58,433
You are returning...

898
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,635
To the present.

899
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:19,554
Zelen: Baron Otto, you're under
arrest for the murder of sir karell borotyn.

900
00:59:19,621 --> 00:59:25,427
You were very clever in
concealing the motive of your crime.

901
00:59:25,493 --> 00:59:30,098
We never dreamt it was
miss borotyn you were after.

902
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:32,967
Franz, take him out to the car.

903
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:40,708
I don't get the idea of
his heating the glass.

904
00:59:40,775 --> 00:59:44,779
Why, to cup him with.
To cup him of his blood.

905
00:59:44,846 --> 00:59:48,950
That hot glass over the wound
creates a powerful suction.

906
00:59:49,017 --> 00:59:50,485
Hmm.

907
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:53,055
Forgive me, fedor, but
they wouldn't let me tell you.

908
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:56,758
They were afraid that you
wouldn't let me go through with it.

909
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:03,931
This vampire business, it has
given me a great idea for a new act.

910
01:00:03,998 --> 01:00:09,003
Luna, in the new act,
I will be the vampire.

911
01:00:09,071 --> 01:00:10,872
Did you watch me?

912
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:12,507
I gave all of me.

913
01:00:12,574 --> 01:00:15,477
I was greater than any real vampire.

914
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:17,979
Luna: Sure, sure. But get off your makeup.

915
01:00:18,046 --> 01:00:20,182
Yes, and help me with some of this packing.
