1
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:41,041
His friends would say, stop whinin',
they've had enough ofthat

2
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:47,297
His friends would say, stop pinin',
there's other girls to look at

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:52,719
They've tried to set him up
with Tiffany and lndigo

4
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:57,891
But there's somethin' about Mary
that they don't know

5
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,019
Mary...

6
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,274
There's just somethin' about Mary

7
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:14,616
Well, his friends say,
look, life's no fairy tale

8
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:20,830
That he should have some fun,
he's suffered long enough

9
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:26,086
Well, they may know about domestic
and imported ale

10
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,299
But they don't know a thing about love

11
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:38,598
Well, his friends would say he's dreamin'
and livin' in the past

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,603
But they've never fallen in love
so his friends need not be asked

13
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:51,069
His friends would say, be reasonable,
his friends would say, let go

14
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:59,244
But there's somethin' about Mary
that they don't know

15
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,538
Mary...

16
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,710
There's just somethin' about Mary

17
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:23,435
When I was 16 years old,
I fellin love.

18
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,521
Hey, Renise.

19
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,648
Hey.

20
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,734
So, uh, what's up?

21
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,820
Cool.

22
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,952
So I was wondering... I don't know,

23
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,080
if... if maybe you
wanted to, and... or not.

24
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,166
If you don't want to,
you don't have to.

25
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,251
I just wondered if maybe
you were going to the prom,

26
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,337
and... or, uh

27
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,631
if you felt like that,
maybe you'd want to go

28
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,507
with me.

29
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,550
Or, I mean, whatever.

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,887
If... ifyou didn't.

31
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,849
Did you take that bio test?
'Cause that was like...

32
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,977
Look, I heard this rumour
that this guy I like was gonna ask me,

33
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,063
so I'm gonna wait
and see what happens there.

34
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,233
That sounds great. Yeah.

35
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,527
OK.

36
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,575
So, is that like a yes or a no or...

37
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,660
I thought I made it perfectly clear.

38
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,789
If everything else falls apart,

39
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,041
maybe.

40
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:32,253
I'm gonna hold you to that.

41
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,258
Hey, guys.

42
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,511
Hey, Mary!

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,809
I wonder who she's going with.

44
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,771
Her name was Mary.

45
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,856
She moved to ourlittle
Rhode lsland town

46
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:56,236
from Minnesota two years earlier.

47
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,279
What a fox!

48
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,283
I heard she's going
with some guy named Woogie.

49
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,326
Who?

50
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,454
Big guy. Goes to Barrington High.

51
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,749
Woogie from Bore-rington High?

52
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,625
Sounds like a loser.

53
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,796
Loser? Woogie's only
like all-state football,

54
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,924
and basketball,
and fucking valedictorian.

55
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,010
I heard he got a scholarship
to Princeton,

56
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,095
but he's going to Europe first to model.

57
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,474
Yeah? I was thinking of doing that.

58
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,308
Sorry.

59
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,394
Have you... have you

60
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,479
Have you seen my baseball?

61
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,859
Uh, no. Sorry, man. Haven't seen it.

62
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,778
Have you... have you
seen my baseball?

63
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,031
Sorry.

64
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,201
Hey, check it out.

65
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,077
Have you seen my baseball?

66
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,414
Hey, buddy. Come here.

67
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,500
I think I know where your ball is.

68
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,671
- You've seen my baseball?
- Yeah, yeah. I've seen it.

69
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,632
You see that girl over there?

70
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,675
That... that...

71
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,803
She has it,
except she doesn't call it a baseball.

72
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,098
She's got another name for it.

73
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,354
Nice muffs.

74
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,230
Have you seen my... wiener?

75
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,524
What?

76
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,444
Have you seen my wiener?

77
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,529
What the... what the hell
did you just say, buddy?

78
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,572
Wiener?

79
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,700
Hey, get your hand off my car!
What did you just say to me?

80
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,994
My... my...

81
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:28,828
Wiener.

82
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,165
Fuckin' son of a bitch.
I'm gonna fuckin' kick your ass!

83
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,042
Get up, fat boy! Let's go!

84
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,127
- Take it easy.
- Keep your hands off.

85
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,255
- Who the fuck are you?
- The guy's not all there, all right?

86
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,298
Fight! Fight!

87
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,341
Get out of my face.

88
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,635
You want the first punch?

89
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,469
Yeah! Fight!

90
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,512
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

91
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,849
What's the matter with you?
Stop it!

92
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,725
You OK, Warren?

93
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,811
Mary, have you seen my baseball?

94
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,896
No, I haven't seen your baseball.

95
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:55,939
What are you doing leaving the yard?

96
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,024
You know you're not supposed
to leave by yourself.

97
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,067
You know him?

98
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,110
He's my brother.

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,195
I'm her brother.

100
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,238
Warren.

101
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,490
I didn't realise, you know?

102
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,409
You ought to tell him
to watch his mouth.

103
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,661
Jerk.

104
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,579
Are you OK?

105
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,916
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

106
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,960
You OK?

107
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,131
Thanks, Ted.

108
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,092
I couldn'tbelieve
that she knewmyname.

109
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,429
Some ofmybestfriends
didn't knowmyname.

110
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,263
I think Joe Montana

111
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,391
is, like, the most
underrated quarterback.

112
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,476
I mean, he should have been
a first-round draft pick.

113
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,562
Look what he did at Notre Dame.

114
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,647
It's so ridiculous.

115
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,690
Exactly.

116
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,818
I'm telling you, this year,
it's the 49ers. 49ers.

117
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,070
All the way.

118
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,032
Piggyback ride! Piggyback!

119
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,160
Warren, stop it. Leave Ted alone.

120
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,245
No, that's OK. I'll do it.

121
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,288
If you think he can hold me.

122
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,330
Are you kidding?

123
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,416
He's 230 pounds.
He can hold you.

124
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,459
You don't have to.

125
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,501
It's OK. I got a little disc thing,

126
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,544
but it's all right.

127
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,629
All right, here we go!
Giddyup, Warren!

128
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,715
There we go! Whoo!

129
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,758
Fun, huh, Warren?

130
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,886
He's a real Clydesdale, isn't he?

131
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,971
Yeah, Warren, buckin' bronco.

132
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,014
My turn now.

133
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,057
My turn.

134
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,142
OK. Well, I don't...

135
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,270
- Ow!
- It's OK, Ted. You don't have to.

136
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,313
Giddyup!

137
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,649
That's fun. Whoo!

138
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,778
That's fun, huh, Warren?

139
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,948
Whoa!

140
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,205
That was fun.

141
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,039
He's only 230, huh?

142
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,082
Yeah.

143
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,252
- I'm in the yard now. I'll hide.
- OK, go hide.

144
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,338
He's got a lot of energy.

145
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,717
Yeah. He's great.
I have a lot offun with him.

146
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,594
Thanks for walking us back.

147
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:50,637
Yeah, no problem.

148
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,722
I'm, uh, I'm just gonna...

149
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,808
So, are you...
are you going to the prom?

150
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,060
Huh?

151
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,187
Uh, oh. Uh...

152
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,021
I... I don't... I think proms are...

153
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,107
'Cause I thought maybe we, um

154
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,149
- ..dumb.
- We could go together.

155
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,277
Oh, you're gonna go with, like,
a bunch of people?

156
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,363
You want, like, a designated driver?

157
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,448
No, no. I mean, you and me.

158
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,829
Like, we could go together. The two of us.

159
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,998
- You... you and me?
- Yeah.

160
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,297
Well, is that a yes or a no?

161
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,217
- Sure. All right.
- Good.

162
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,469
Cool.

163
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,388
I'm gonna take Warren back inside.

164
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,473
I'll... I'll see you at school.

165
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,601
Cool. I'll catch you back at school.

166
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,687
From thatmoment on,

167
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,815
the guys atschoollookedatme
in a whole newlight.

168
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,110
You're a fuckin' liar.

169
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:47,986
Do you expect us to believe

170
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,071
that you're going
to the prom with Mary?

171
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,199
What's so crazy about that?

172
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,327
Oh, yeah, dirt bud,
and I'm going with Cyndi Lauper.

173
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,413
What happened to Woogie?

174
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,498
She said she broke up with him,

175
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,584
that he was getting weird on her.

176
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,712
I got 20 bucks that says
you're full of shit.

177
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,755
Why not make it 100?

178
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,049
Rock on.

179
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,865
I've already paid him
enough money already.

180
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,993
I'm not paying until the job gets done.
He can kiss my ass!

181
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,288
What the hell do you want?

182
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,463
I'm Ted Stroehmann.
I'm here to take Mary to the prom.

183
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,634
Prom? Mary went to the prom
20 minutes ago with Woogie.

184
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,719
Woogie?

185
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:55,762
Woogie!

186
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,056
Oh.

187
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,100
I see.

188
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,104
Charlie, you are so mean!

189
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,274
This is Mary's stepfather Charlie.
I'm Sheila, her mother.

190
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,360
Ted, don't pay any attention
to anything he says.

191
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,445
He's a laugh a minute.

192
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,488
Very funny.

193
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,573
Well, I'm just having
a little fun with the guy.

194
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:19,911
It's prom night.
Woogie's got a sense of humour.

195
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,872
Oh, hey. Hi, Warren.

196
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,958
Listen, once he gets into that MTV,

197
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,337
he'll be there for quite a while.

198
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,508
Oh, here she comes.
Oh, honey, you look beautiful.

199
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:42,851
Aw, shit, look at that.
You better be careful, boy.

200
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,324
Hi, Ted.

201
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,619
Hi, Mary.

202
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,538
You look really... pretty.

203
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,623
Thanks. I like your colours.

204
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,752
Oh, thanks.
The guy said it was tan and taupe.

205
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,922
Poor Ted, he's been getting it both barrels
from the wisenheimer here.

206
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,051
Dad, you haven't been
bustin' Ted's chops, have ya?

207
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,387
I was just fucking with him.
Right, Ted?

208
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,350
Hey, Warren, did you say hi to Ted?

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,435
About 10 times.

210
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,478
OK.

211
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,606
Hey, Warren.
I think I found your baseball.

212
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,648
You've seen my baseball?

213
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,985
Well, if it's a big white one.

214
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,156
With, uh

215
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:38,990
Iittle red stitching.

216
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,033
Yup. It is.

217
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,118
Then I think I saw it,

218
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,455
right behind your ear.

219
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,375
Warren! Warren!
Hold it, hold it!

220
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,460
Get up, Warren! Hey, Warren!

221
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,503
Warren!

222
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,588
Be careful, Mary! Be careful!

223
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,840
Get up, man!

224
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:56,716
Let go of him! Get down from there!

225
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,802
What are you doing?

226
00:11:59,052 --> 00:11:59,844
Ted! Ted!

227
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:00,887
Warren, put him down!

228
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,139
Whoa! Ohh!

229
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,266
What the hell are you doing?

230
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,101
Mary, Mary.

231
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,143
This is my house here!

232
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,437
Warren, are you OK, buddy?

233
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,314
It's OK, Warren. It's OK.

234
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,357
Here you go.

235
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,400
What the hell's the matter with you?

236
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,528
I was just trying
to give him the baseball.

237
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,570
Baseball? What baseball?

238
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,656
I had a baseball.

239
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:20,699
What baseball?

240
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:21,741
There was... it's right...

241
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,827
There was a baseball here.

242
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,079
I swear, I brought him a baseball,

243
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,997
and I was just trying
to give him a present!

244
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,250
Are you yelling at me
in my own house?

245
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,126
No.

246
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,211
Don't make me open a can
of whup-ass on you.

247
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,548
Ted, I should have told you.
He has a thing about his ears.

248
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,467
You all right, Warren?

249
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,720
Oh, honey, your strap's broken.

250
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,681
Oh, right.

251
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,766
Hey, Ted, I'm just gonna
go upstairs real quick.

252
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,852
I just need two minutes.
I got to fix my dress.

253
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:49,894
I'll help you, honey.

254
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,188
Hey, l, uh...

255
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,108
Can I use your bathroom?
I'm sorry. I got to...

256
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,193
- He broke the table.
- You son of a bitch.

257
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,488
I didn't do it.

258
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,658
- I swear...
- The bathroom is that way.

259
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,663
Maybe I'll open up
a can ofwhup-ass on him.

260
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,958
Trying to do the kid a favour.

261
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,201
He's looking at you! What is he...

262
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,495
Oh, no. I...

263
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,372
No, no, I was...

264
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,457
Mom, wait!

265
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,709
Shit!

266
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,349
Ted, are you OK?

267
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,226
Yeah, I'm fine! Everything's OK!

268
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,268
OK, OK, just take your time.

269
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,354
It's all right.

270
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,482
He's been in there
over a half an hour.

271
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,567
Charlie, I think he's masturbating.

272
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:20,610
- Oh, come on!
- Mom!

273
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,653
Well...

274
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,696
He's not masturbating.

275
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,781
Well, he was watching you undress

276
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,866
with a silly grin on his face.

277
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,119
I was watching the birds!

278
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,288
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

279
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,165
I think he needs some male help.

280
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,336
- Oh, for crying out loud.
- Dad, just give him a minute.

281
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,631
OK, kid, listen, I'm coming in, OK?

282
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,758
No, no. Don't...

283
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,635
Exactly what the hell
is the situation here?

284
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,721
What did you do,
shit yourself or something?

285
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:48,763
Oh, I wish. I...

286
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,849
I got it stuck.

287
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,977
You got what stuck?

288
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,020
It!

289
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,313
Oh! lt. Um...

290
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,233
Um, uh, well, um... Iisten, uh...

291
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,318
It's not the end ofthe world.

292
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,404
These kind ofthings happen.

293
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,699
Let's have a look at it.

294
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,870
Oh, my God in heaven, save him!

295
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:12,746
Shh! Shh!

296
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:16,041
- Shush! Quiet!
- Sh-Sheila !

297
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,169
- No!
- Sheila, uh, honey?

298
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,087
Sheila, honey.

299
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,215
Uh, you gotta come here.
You gotta see this.

300
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,509
What is it?

301
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,386
Don't! Don't!

302
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,472
Don't worry.
She's a dental hygienist.

303
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,514
She'll know exactly what to do.

304
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,642
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Mrs Jensen. How are you?

305
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,728
- You OK?
- Yeah.

306
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,813
Holy shit!

307
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,108
Charlie, you could have warned me.

308
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:42,984
OK, l, um...

309
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,027
Mrs Jensen, l...

310
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,070
Right, right. OK.

311
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,112
I don't want her to hear, you know?

312
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,198
OK. Um, let's just relax here, OK?

313
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,450
Now, uh, uh...

314
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,369
What exactly are we, uh

315
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,454
Iooking at here, huh?

316
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:55,497
What do you mean?

317
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,792
I mean, is it the, um...

318
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,920
Or the...

319
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,048
Is it the frank or the beans?

320
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,966
Oh, l, uh, l... I don't know.

321
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,052
It looks like...
I think it's a little bit of both.

322
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,389
Franks and beans!
Franks and beans!

323
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,265
Well, what's that bubble there?

324
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,351
What do you think? It's a...

325
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,479
Well, how the hell did you get the beans
above the frank?!

326
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,522
Shush, shush.

327
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,859
I don't know. It wasn't like
it was a well-thought-out plan.

328
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,778
There really does seem
to be an awful lot of skin

329
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:27,821
coming through there,

330
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,906
so I'm gonna find
some Bactine, honey.

331
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,034
Uh, no. You know what?
I don't need any. Really.

332
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,077
Hello there.

333
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,120
Oh, Christ.

334
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,205
What the hell's going on here?

335
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,333
Neighbours said they heard
a lady scream.

336
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,419
Uh, well, you're looking at him.

337
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,504
Uh, you gotta take a look at this.

338
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,547
Would you just...

339
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,589
Oh, Jesus!

340
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,675
Ain't it a beaut?

341
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,970
What the hell

342
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:53,888
were you thinking?

343
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,017
How the hell did you get the zipper
all the way to the top?

344
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,145
Let's just say the kid's limber.

345
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,439
Ow! Ow!

346
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,273
Christ!

347
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,315
What the...

348
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,358
God...

349
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,444
Somebody's gonna have to
move that station wagon

350
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,486
so I can get the truck in here.

351
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,781
Lenny, come here.

352
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:12,657
Take a look

353
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,785
at what this numb-nuts did.

354
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,079
Holy shit!

355
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,127
Mike, Eddie. Get down here quick.

356
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,212
Bring everybody. Bring a camera.
You won't believe this!

357
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,298
We got a kid down here...
what's your name?

358
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,550
No, l...

359
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,469
No, there's only
one thing to do here.

360
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,554
What? No. You know what?
I got an idea.

361
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,682
Look, look. I can just...
We don't have to do anything

362
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,810
'cause, look, I can just
wear this over the front.

363
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:41,853
Look, I can go to the prom.
We'll deal with it later.

364
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:42,896
Son, relax.

365
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,024
You already laid the tracks.
That's the hard part.

366
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,318
Now we're just gonna back it up.

367
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,362
Teddy, be brave.

368
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:54,574
It's just like pulling off a Band-Aid.

369
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,408
A one

370
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,660
and a two

371
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,579
and a...

372
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,622
We got a bleeder!

373
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,707
Keep pressure on it. Keep it on.

374
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,044
Everybody get out ofthe way!

375
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,130
Step clear, gentlemen, please.

376
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,006
He was masturbating!

377
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,301
People, please move out ofthe way.

378
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,262
He was masturbating!

379
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,305
Move out ofthe way.

380
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,391
None ofthis ever happened to Woogie!

381
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,685
Are you OK, Ted?

382
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,728
Ted!

383
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,855
He was masturbating!

384
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,775
Ted, are you all right?

385
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,069
Sure.

386
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,031
OK.

387
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,325
OK, Ted.

388
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,369
OK, let's roll.

389
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,757
So, anyway, uh

390
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,094
school ended a couple days later,

391
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:00,056
and her father got transferred
to Florida in July.

392
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:05,478
So I worked all summer
to pay offthose debts and

393
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,398
well, I never saw Mary again.

394
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,650
That was... what?

395
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,778
13 years ago.

396
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,948
That's very interesting.

397
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,034
Anyway,

398
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,910
I know it's not the type
of thing you'd forget,

399
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,996
but I guess I just... I kinda...

400
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,081
I must have blocked it
out of my head or something,

401
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,209
'cause I was driving down
the highway last week,

402
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,589
and I started thinking about Mary,

403
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,508
and all of a sudden
it was like I couldn't breathe.

404
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,551
I mean, I was... I was...

405
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,636
I felt like I was gonna die.

406
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:44,059
So I pulled offthe road
and I just sorta stopped in this

407
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,935
I guess it was a rest area.

408
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,230
I was just kind of shaking and...

409
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:54,486
You know,
rest areas are homosexual hangouts.

410
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,405
Highway rest areas.

411
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,491
They're the bathhouses ofthe '90s

412
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,828
for many, many, many gay men.

413
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,126
So what... what are you...

414
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,297
What are you saying?

415
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,425
Oop. Time, she's up.

416
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,640
We'll, uh, delve into that next week.

417
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:25,558
Well, you know, you are a writer,

418
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,687
and writers are artists.

419
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,815
And most artists
are a little foofy, you know.

420
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,900
A little foofy.
Thanks for the support.

421
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,071
Hey, you guys, I thought
you might like these with your beers.

422
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,156
Yes, indeed. Ted, help yourself.

423
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,242
I don't think I'll have one.

424
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,284
- You don't want one?
- No.

425
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,370
You want something else?

426
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,413
Come on.
You want something to eat?

427
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,498
Not hungry, thank you.

428
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,541
You want a cookie, something like that?

429
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,626
Honey, we got cookies?

430
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,712
Uh, no, we don't,
but I could bake some.

431
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,797
No, no, no. Don't bake any.

432
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,049
No, that's a good idea.
Why don't you bake some?

433
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:58,925
Bake some tollhouses.

434
00:20:59,175 --> 00:20:59,968
Oh, great. Yeah, yeah.

435
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,096
- Uh, chocolate chip or butterscotch?
- Let's go with the chocolate chip.

436
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,181
- OK. Good.
- Really, you don't...

437
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,267
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

438
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,519
She loves this kind ofthing.

439
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,438
Really?
See, that's great.

440
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,774
That's what I want,

441
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:15,608
a family,

442
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:19,988
and somebody to, you know...

443
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,993
It must be wonderful
having all this, huh?

444
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,078
Each day is better than the next.

445
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,415
How about you?

446
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,501
The big "L." Hmm?

447
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:34,377
- Ever been?
- What?

448
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,463
In lurve.

449
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,505
Well,

450
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,799
once.

451
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:41,676
Mary.

452
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,804
Oh, God. Not Mary again.

453
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,890
Look, I know it was brief,

454
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,932
but it was

455
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,061
it was definitely love, Dom.

456
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,146
I mean,
crushes don't last for 13 years, right?

457
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,274
What ever happened to Mary?

458
00:21:56,524 --> 00:22:00,653
- She moved with her family to Miami.
- So why don't you look her up?

459
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:01,488
I did

460
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:02,530
once.

461
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:03,573
I called. She wasn't listed.

462
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,701
So that's it? You get one little bump
in the road and give up?

463
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,787
It's probably for the best.

464
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:09,829
After 13 years,

465
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,915
she'll probably think I'm a stalker.

466
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,043
You know what you should do
is hire a private investigator.

467
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,338
You know, to find her, follow her around.
She won't know anything.

468
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,256
No way! That's way too creepy.

469
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:24,636
Besides, she's probably married
with a couple of kids by now.

470
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:25,470
Girls like Mary...

471
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,555
..they don't stay single.

472
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,641
Hey, I've got an idea.

473
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:33,812
There's this guy down in my office.
His name's Healy.

474
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,897
He's a claims investigator.
He's a hell of a bloodhound.

475
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,025
He goes to Miami every couple ofweeks.
He can help you out.

476
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,405
This guy runs a little hot,
but he gets the job done.

477
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,618
So.

478
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,538
Dom says you're looking for some lady friend
you knew back at school.

479
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,666
Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:55,709
That's cute.

481
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:59,045
I don't buy it, but it's cute.

482
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,922
You're not buying what?

483
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:07,387
Ted, I'm the kind of guy
who likes to shoot from the hip.

484
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:11,558
I want you to level with me.

485
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,563
Come on, let's talk.

486
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,648
Did you knock this skirt up? Huh?

487
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,691
No.

488
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,776
She's blackmailing you, right?

489
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:23,862
Blackmailing me?

490
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:24,904
No.

491
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,990
You want her dead, don't you?

492
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,284
Dead?

493
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,118
Were you...

494
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,370
You're not serious, are you?

495
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,331
You expect me to believe
this is a straight stalker case? Come on!

496
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,460
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm not a stalker.
I'm not a stalker, all right?

497
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,545
- She's a friend of mine.
- Oh, sure she is!

498
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,673
That explains why she's got
an unlisted number,

499
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,759
and you haven't heard squat
from her in 13 years.

500
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,844
Yeah. A real chum.

501
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,138
You're good, Ted.

502
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,182
Real piece ofwork.

503
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,058
You know what? Forget it.

504
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,310
Just forget the whole thing.

505
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,186
OK, I'll do it.

506
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,314
But ifthis chick turns up with a toe tag,

507
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,609
I'm rolling over on you, big guy.

508
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,779
All right.

509
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,547
Healy, you dog.

510
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:25,382
Sully!

511
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,676
Look at you.

512
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,595
You hot shit, you look fucking pisser.

513
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,890
Hey. Hey, good fella.

514
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:34,766
Does he bite?

515
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:35,809
A little bit.

516
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,061
Get in.

517
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,065
Here's the info you asked for.

518
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:43,108
Thanks.

519
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:47,278
Yeah, you should thank me.
That girl was not easy to find.

520
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,407
What, she scam you out
of some insurance dough?

521
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,492
Nah. Some guy gave me a couple bucks

522
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,577
to track down his high school girlfriend.

523
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,914
Stalker, huh?

524
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,000
Yep. Big time.

525
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:32,323
Looks like we found your Mary, Ted.

526
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,410
Husband... negative.

527
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,328
Children and a labrador,

528
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,371
negative.

529
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,457
Tight little package,

530
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,709
affirmative.

531
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:51,926
Good morning, Magda.

532
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:56,306
- Hi, doll. You're in my light.
- Sorry.

533
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,225
So you been out here all night again?

534
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,311
You bet your ass I have.

535
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,396
This is an importantjob,
Neighbourhood Watch is.

536
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,524
Ah. Neighbourhood Watch.
Is that what we're calling it?

537
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:11,946
Listening to perfect strangers'
telephone conversations.

538
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,866
This only picks up cellular phones
in a half a mile radius.

539
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,118
Meaning?

540
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,037
Meaning these are the people
you live amongst.

541
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,080
You got a right to know
if they're creeps.

542
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,165
For instance, you know the guy

543
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:27,587
in the green house down the street?
Cheating on his wife.

544
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,464
And I am not surprised.

545
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,549
I am not surprised at all.

546
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,678
Because Puffy used to bark his balls off
whenever he saw him.

547
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:37,806
And you know that Puffy,
he only barks at the bad people.

548
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,058
OK.

549
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:43,019
Listen, I'm gonna go hit some golf balls,

550
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,147
and hook up with Warren,
so... try to get some sleep.

551
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,190
OK.

552
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,527
- Bye, doll.
- Bye.

553
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:51,361
Hello.

554
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,655
Hi, Mary.

555
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,788
Hey, Herb. How's it going?

556
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:02,831
Apple for you today.

557
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:03,873
Thanks, Mary.

558
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,959
Have a good day. See you later.

559
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,211
Lookin' good, honey.

560
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:39,325
Hi, Mary.

561
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,368
Hey, Mrs. Bailey. How you doing?

562
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:44,748
Looks like we got ajock on our hands.

563
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,838
Hey, you want the sports page?

564
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:52,881
Sure. Thank you.

565
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,966
Take care now.

566
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,261
Bye, you guys. See ya.

567
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,034
Yeah. Can I have two, Mary?

568
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:25,372
Yeah, you can have two halves,
just like everybody else.

569
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,499
Yeah, it's good.

570
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,461
- Will you marry me, Mary?
- Oh, I would love to, Jimmy,

571
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,798
but, um, I'm already engaged to Freddie.

572
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:36,675
Who's Freddie? Me?

573
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,968
Yeah, that's you.

574
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,097
Will you marry me?

575
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,973
What about Dolores?

576
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,016
You gonna marry us both?

577
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,102
I'm gonna kiss you.

578
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,187
I think you're making out
pretty well there.

579
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,439
OK.

580
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,315
Thanks, Mary.

581
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,401
You're welcome, Zack.

582
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,695
- No onions.
- No onions.

583
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:57,529
No onions.

584
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,865
No onions. How you doing?

585
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,742
Listen to this one:

586
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,870
"Seeking sensitive WASP doctor

587
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:06,913
to share candlelit dinners,

588
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,998
Iong walks in Coconut Grove,

589
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:10,041
marriage."

590
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,127
Is she looking for a corpse?

591
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,169
You have to be specific
when you write those.

592
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,383
You have to say,
"seeking deaf mute with", you know,

593
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:21,678
"3-pound cock and trust fund."

594
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,639
I want a guy who can play 36 holes

595
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,725
and still have enough energy

596
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,810
to take me and Warren to a ball game

597
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,853
and eat hot dogs.

598
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,938
I'm talking sausage hot dogs, beer.

599
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:36,317
Not light beer, but beer.
That's my ad. Print it up.

600
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,237
Fatty who likes beer and golf.

601
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:43,616
Jeez, Mary, where you gonna find
a gem like that?

602
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,745
OK, well, here's the catch.

603
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,831
He has to be self-employed.

604
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,958
Like a drug dealer?

605
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,835
No, I was thinking
along the lines, maybe,

606
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,920
of somebody like

607
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:56,963
an architect or something.

608
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:01,301
But I want somebody with freedom
in theirjob, you know?

609
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:02,177
Somebody who can do it anywhere

610
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:05,305
and just leave at a drop of a hat.

611
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:08,600
And where would you
and your beer-bellied architect be going to?

612
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,561
Super bowl?

613
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:12,604
That's good.

614
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:15,899
I don't know.
Maybe a few months in Nepal.

615
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:19,903
And you'd probably dump the poor guy
halfway to Katmandu.

616
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,988
What's that supposed to mean?

617
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,074
It means you change
your mind too much.

618
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,116
No, I don't.

619
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,159
Oh, come off it, Mary.

620
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:29,287
Remember that gorgeous
corn-fed white-boy honey

621
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,373
that you just dumped
like yesterday's garbage?

622
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:34,709
What was his name? Pack man.

623
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,837
OK. We had fun for a while.

624
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,714
Mary, cut the crap.

625
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,800
What really happened with Brett?

626
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,136
Yeah. Brett seemed so sweet.

627
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:48,056
You know what Tucker said Brett told him?

628
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:51,184
He said that ifWarren wasn't in my life,

629
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:54,312
that he would have
popped the question a long time ago.

630
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,606
- Oh.
- What a schmuck.

631
00:30:57,691 --> 00:31:00,777
To hell with Brett, you know?

632
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,905
I've got a vibrator.

633
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:09,119
Shh!

634
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,593
Those are the plays ofthe month.

635
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:26,636
Thank you forjoining us.

636
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,722
Look forward to seeingyou next Sunday

637
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:29,764
on the Sports Machine.

638
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:33,059
Have a good week, everybody.

639
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,362
Oh, ho-ho, yeah.

640
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,656
Ho ho.

641
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,784
Here comes the money shot.

642
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,042
Aah!

643
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:01,254
First chink in the armour, Ted.

644
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:05,425
Ohh.

645
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,469
Shit.

646
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,638
Ohh, yeah.

647
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,900
Pop, you wanna get me a whisky sour
when you get a sec?

648
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,985
Whisky sour coming up.

649
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:26,279
Got some excellent news
for you, my friend.

650
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,113
Oh, yeah? Excellent?

651
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,156
I think your life's about to change.

652
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:29,199
Really?

653
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,284
So... so you found her?

654
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:32,327
Oh, yeah.

655
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:36,706
And you were right, man.
She really is something else.

656
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:37,540
My God.

657
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:38,583
Really?

658
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,669
So... so she hasn't

659
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,754
she hasn't changed at all, huh?

660
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,839
Well, that I couldn't say.

661
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,176
Let me ask you something.

662
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:52,347
Was Mary a little big-boned
back in high school?

663
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,224
Big-boned? No, no. Not at all. No.

664
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:58,395
I guess she packed on
a few pounds over the years.

665
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:01,523
Oh, yeah. So she's a little...
she's a little chubby?

666
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,608
Oh, I'd say about a deuce,
deuce and a half. Not bad.

667
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:07,987
Oh, my. A deuce and a half.

668
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:11,950
You shit out a bunch of kids,
and you're bound to put on a few pounds.

669
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,286
Oh, so she's, um

670
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:16,121
she's married?

671
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,206
No, no. She's never been.
That's the good news.

672
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,458
Huh?

673
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:24,629
Four kids, three different guys,
but no rock.

674
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:26,756
Hyperactive little fuckers, too.

675
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,633
Tough to keep up with
in a wheelchair, I bet.

676
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:32,804
She's in a wheelchair?
Mary's in a wheelchair?

677
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,889
I thought that was part ofyour kick.

678
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,018
Excuse me, I ordered a whisky sour.

679
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:41,146
Are you sure it's the same Mary?

680
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,274
Oh, yeah. It's Mary all right.
The brother Warren?

681
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:47,402
Hey, don't look so shocked, Ted.
It's been a long time.

682
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:51,573
I bet you've changed a lot
in the last 13 years.

683
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:53,658
What, do you think
your shit don't stink?

684
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,786
No, I don't think..
I... I mean, yes, it doe...

685
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:59,914
OK, I got all
the information you need.

686
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,000
I got it off her bookie. Nice guy.

687
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,294
You really should look her up, Ted.

688
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,171
I mean, she's a real spark plug, this one.

689
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,299
Well, thank you.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.

690
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,551
Uh, Ted,

691
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:16,806
don't you want the name
of the housing project?

692
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:17,640
What?

693
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,726
..for 1,995.

694
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,854
See the Sarone boys on Route 1
in South Brattleboro, andrighthere

695
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:27,192
on Jefferson Boulevardin Warwick...

696
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:42,874
Well, it hurts from the bottom

697
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,794
And it hurts down to your soul

698
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:46,836
That's because

699
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:50,131
True love is not nice

700
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:56,429
And it brings up hurt

701
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:59,557
From when you were 5 years old

702
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,392
That's because

703
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:03,728
True love is not nice

704
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,814
No

705
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:09,984
Oh, pain, pain, pain

706
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:12,904
Ain't thatjust love's name?

707
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,989
Love can bring up hurt

708
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,326
From way down low

709
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:22,288
It now be emphasised

710
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:26,668
True love is just not civilised

711
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:29,796
True love is not nice

712
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,840
No, no

713
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,015
Where are you goin'?

714
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:41,057
Huh?

715
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,309
Oh, I resigned.

716
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,228
Good luck in Miami, Pat.

717
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:46,271
Miami?

718
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,399
What... what are you doing in Miami?

719
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:52,736
Uh, I took a, uh, job offer.

720
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,779
With who?

721
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:56,906
With, uh...

722
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,950
Rice-a-roni.

723
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,869
Isn't that the San Francisco treat?

724
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,121
It was.

725
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:05,040
They're changing their image.

726
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,168
Yeah, well, listen,
I've been thinking about what you said.

727
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:09,210
Good, good.

728
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:13,548
And, uh, I still want to look her up.

729
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:14,424
Who?

730
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:15,467
Roller pig?

731
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,719
Are you nuts?

732
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:19,637
I thought you said she was
a real spark plug.

733
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,766
Hmm? No, no. I said butt plug.

734
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:25,018
She's heinous.

735
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,189
You know what?

736
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:30,065
All the same, I think I wanna call her.

737
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:32,150
I mean, I know it sounds crazy,

738
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,235
but, you know... I don't know.
Maybe I can help her out.

739
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,321
I just... I feel bad, you know?

740
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:38,406
The poor thing, she's in a wheelchair,
for God sakes.

741
00:36:38,656 --> 00:36:41,534
It's... it's a bunion. It'll heal.

742
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,620
Bunion? You... what... I thought...

743
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,748
You know what? That's not even it.
The point is, I just...

744
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:48,833
I know this doesn't make sense to you,

745
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:54,255
but I can'tjust turn it offthat fast.

746
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:58,426
I guess I still have feelings for her.

747
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:02,597
This girl really means
something to you, huh?

748
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,812
All right.

749
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,730
Tell you what...
I'll get you her number,

750
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,858
just as soon as she
gets back from Japan.

751
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:15,944
Thank you. I'd apprec...

752
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:19,072
Japan? What is...
what's happening in Japan?

753
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,366
Why is she going to Japan?

754
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:24,285
Oh, uh, you've heard
of mail-order brides, haven't you?

755
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,328
Well, they go that way, too.

756
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,580
Mary's a...

757
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,499
What... what, are they desperate?

758
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:30,542
She's a whale!

759
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,627
Don't forget. It's a sumo culture.

760
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,879
They pay by the pound there.

761
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:39,050
It's sorta like, uh, sorta like tuna.

762
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:42,012
Well, what happened to... You said
she was single. Remember? No rock.

763
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:46,349
You had your window, Ted.
You blew it.

764
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:51,604
I had my window?

765
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:55,775
I'm sorry, buddy. It's just...

766
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:58,695
You're taking this all wrong.
I mean, you're liberated.

767
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:03,908
I mean, you think you blew it with
the greatest girl ever, and it turns out

768
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:09,122
that getting your dick stuck in your zipper
was the best thing that ever happened to you.

769
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,165
You wanna say it a little louder?

770
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:13,460
I'm sorry, but it was.

771
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:16,629
I never told you that.

772
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,759
Well, I was only four towns away.

773
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:21,634
Excuse me.

774
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:22,677
Oh, sure, sweetheart.

775
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:23,720
Oh, man, I gotta go.

776
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,805
I gotta get up at 6 a.m. tomorrow

777
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,891
and help my boss' brother move.

778
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:29,976
Your boss' brother? Who's that?

779
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:32,062
I don't even know. I never met him.

780
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:36,399
Ted, finish that novel
so you can quit that stupid magazine.

781
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:38,526
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

782
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,825
Nice swing.

783
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,168
Christ! Hit a house!

784
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:59,339
I haven't swung
the wrenches in a while.

785
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:06,471
Would you mind givin' me
some pointers here?

786
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:10,809
Yeah. Sure. Don't talk
in someone's backswing.

787
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:12,936
Oh, thanks.

788
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,813
I'm gonna go get a soda.
You want one?

789
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,107
No, thanks.

790
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:22,112
Oh, uh, look, I'm sorry
to bother you again,

791
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:25,240
but, uh... you got
change of a dollar?

792
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,534
No.

793
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:31,705
All I got are these
damn Nepalese coins.

794
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:36,918
You've been to Nepal?

795
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:40,880
Oh, uh, not... not in months.

796
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:45,218
I don't even know why
I bought the damn place.

797
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:54,644
- Nice meeting you again.
- You, too... again.

798
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:59,858
So what's your name?

799
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,901
Pat Healy.

800
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,905
Wanna know mine?

801
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:09,200
I already know it, Mary.

802
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:11,119
How did you know that?

803
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:15,498
'Cause it's right there
on your golf bag.

804
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,797
Aw, damn!

805
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:26,760
Wow. Are... are those blueprints?

806
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,054
Oh, these?

807
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:31,973
They're just some, uh,
projects I'm working on.

808
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:35,101
Museum,... hospital for kids.

809
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,187
Really? Are you an architect?

810
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:41,566
Just till I get my, uh, PGA tour card.

811
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:47,781
No. I mean, are they putting up
a new museum in town, or is it...

812
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:50,742
To tell you the truth,
I'm sort of burnt-out on talkin' about it.

813
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:52,827
Oh, I'm sorry.

814
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:55,955
It's just ajob, really.
Something to keep me moving.

815
00:40:56,206 --> 00:41:00,126
- My real passion is my hobby.
- Really? What's that?

816
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:03,421
I work with retards.

817
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:07,425
Isn't that a little politically,
um, incorrect?

818
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:09,511
Well, the hell with that.

819
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:13,682
No-one's gonna tell me who I can
and can't work with, right?

820
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,810
- No. I mean...
- We got this one kid... Mongo.

821
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,980
He's got a forehead
like a drive-in movie theatre,

822
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,023
but we don't bust his chops too much.

823
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:27,445
- So one day Mongo gets out of his cage...
- What, they keep him in a cage?

824
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,279
Well, it's... it's just an enclosure.

825
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,365
No, but they keep him confined.

826
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:31,408
Right, yeah.

827
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:32,450
That's bullshit!

828
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,493
Well, that's what I said!

829
00:41:33,743 --> 00:41:36,621
So I went out,
and I got him, um, I got him a leash.

830
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:37,664
A leash!

831
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:39,749
Yeah, one ofthose ones you can hook
onto the clothesline,

832
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,835
and he can run back and forth.

833
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,920
And, uh, there's plenty of room

834
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,048
for him to... to dig and, uh, play.

835
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:49,134
That kid is really, uh,

836
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,219
he's really blossomed, you know?

837
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:54,556
Now I can, uh, take him to movies.

838
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:56,433
Baseball games.

839
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,727
Fun stuff.

840
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:00,770
Yeah.

841
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:01,646
Sounds cool.

842
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,732
Oh, yeah, it's cool for them,

843
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:05,817
but for me it's much more than that.

844
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:06,860
For me, it's... it's heaven.

845
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,154
Y'know?

846
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:09,988
Those goofy bastards are just about

847
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:14,159
the best thing I've got goin' in this

848
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,411
crazy world.

849
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:22,500
Hey, dipshit, be careful
with that thing, will you?

850
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:23,543
What?

851
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:27,714
You heard me. You already
put a fuckin' nick in my piano.

852
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:31,885
Well, I'll try to be a little more careful.

853
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:35,013
What, are you fadin'?
You wimpin' out on me?

854
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:38,141
It's just that this is a little bit heavy,
that's all.

855
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:42,312
Heavy? What I wouldn't give to know
what heavy feels like,

856
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:43,355
you insensitive prick.

857
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:46,483
No, I didn't... I didn't mean that!

858
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:49,611
Yeah, yeah. I'm goin' down the street
to get some coffee.

859
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:52,947
Wait! Wait! I'll get you
the coffee. Just... just...

860
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,991
Hey, I'm sorry!

861
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:05,418
Tender, fascial tissue left of L7.

862
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:08,588
Hey, Bob?

863
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,716
Remember Mary?

864
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,760
Oh, yeah.

865
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:16,888
I remember Mary.

866
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:20,892
Hey, I saw her a few months ago
at a convention in Las Vegas.

867
00:43:21,142 --> 00:43:24,229
How could you see her at a convention?

868
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,106
Well, I'm a chiropractor.
She's an orthopaedic surgeon.

869
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:28,358
She's a what?!

870
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:29,234
She's an orthopaedic surgeon.

871
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:33,571
And... oof... she's still a fox.

872
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,575
What ifthe families
don't want a class action?

873
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:42,789
Oh, God! That's what I've been trying
to explain to you people for the last hour!

874
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:45,041
OK, fine. We'll go over it again.

875
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:45,917
Mary's a fox!

876
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:46,960
What?

877
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,045
Mary's a fox? What do you...

878
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,131
Hey, folks. Here, let's...

879
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:54,467
We'll break up.
We'll spitball this tomorrow. OK?

880
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:56,344
What the hell are you talking about?!

881
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:58,638
Mary? My Mary?

882
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,558
She's not in Japan.
She has no rugrats running around.

883
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:03,643
My friend says she's a fox.

884
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:04,686
A surgeon fox.

885
00:44:04,936 --> 00:44:07,814
I don't get it. I mean Healy...

886
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:10,942
Think about it! He never even
looked her up down there!

887
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:15,280
He was there closing his deal
with the Rice-a-roni people the whole time!

888
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:19,284
What's up with your head?

889
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:25,540
Oh. I... I get hives tap-dancing
for these idiots. I get a little stressed out.

890
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,920
Jeez. You know, I feel like a royal shit
because I set you up with this guy.

891
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:34,924
You know what you gotta do.
You gotta call her.

892
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,218
Fuck calling her.

893
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,095
I'm goin' down there.

894
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,389
Yeah, yeah, OK.

895
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:43,266
ASAP.

896
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:46,561
So, who's the lucky guy?

897
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:48,688
His name's Pat.

898
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:49,522
I met him at the driving range.

899
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:52,859
Is he good looking?

900
00:44:53,943 --> 00:44:55,987
He's no Steve Young.

901
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:58,031
So, what is he like?

902
00:44:59,157 --> 00:45:01,159
I don't know.

903
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:02,035
Kind of a mook.

904
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:03,078
A schlep.

905
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:05,163
Why the hellyou going out
with him ifhe's a schlep?

906
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:07,248
It's not like that, Magda.

907
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,501
You know, it's...

908
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:11,628
It's like that movie HaroldandMaude.

909
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:13,505
I don't watch the new ones.

910
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:16,633
Well, you should, because it's probably
the greatest love story of our time.

911
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:18,718
The point is

912
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:21,846
is that love isn't about

913
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:23,932
money or social standings

914
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:24,974
or age.

915
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:27,060
It's about two people connecting,

916
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,145
having something in common.

917
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:31,231
You know, kindred spirits.

918
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:33,316
Fuck kindred spirits.

919
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:35,402
My little Puffy here is going to tell you

920
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:37,487
everything you need
to know about that guy

921
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:38,530
in about two seconds flat.

922
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,658
If Puffy starts yapping, uh-uh.
He's a loser.

923
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:48,081
Ifhe likes him,
then you've gotyourselfa keeper.

924
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,149
Yeah.

925
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:18,319
Pufferball likes it when I rub his belly.

926
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:21,489
That is amazing!

927
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:22,323
He doesn't like anybody.

928
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:25,452
He never usually likes guys.

929
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,537
He doesn't like bad guys.

930
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:29,622
Is that right?

931
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:32,751
I can tell that you're an animal nut.

932
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:33,793
You are, aren't you?

933
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:36,087
You got me pegged.

934
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,007
You know, in Nepal,
the villagers there called me

935
00:46:39,257 --> 00:46:40,050
Kin ton ti,

936
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,135
which means

937
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:49,601
"noble man who is loved by many animal,
who, in kind, he loveth, too."

938
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,605
Would you like a cup
of tea or something?

939
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:56,733
I'd love a brewski ifyou got one.

940
00:46:56,983 --> 00:46:57,776
We can do that.

941
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:01,946
Hey, Magda, why don't you help me
in the kitchen?

942
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:06,326
Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Certainly. Of course.

943
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,454
Kin ton ti.

944
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:15,669
Puffer doesn't like bad guys, does he?

945
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:19,839
Puffer?

946
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:23,009
Puffer?

947
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:24,886
Puffer, come on, boy.

948
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:26,971
Would you like a little clam dip, doll?

949
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:28,014
Uh, no, thank you.

950
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:31,309
I'd love a bundt cake ifyou have one.

951
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:33,228
- Bundt cake?
- Bundt cake?

952
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:35,480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

953
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:40,735
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

954
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,612
1, 2, 3.

955
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:45,740
Hey, Pat, do you want a, um

956
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,826
a Budweiser or a Heinie?

957
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:49,911
Uh, yeah, whatever.

958
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:53,248
Come on, Puffer!
Stay away from the light!

959
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:57,419
OK, I'll just get you a regular.

960
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:27,657
All set?

961
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:36,833
Oh, good pooch.

962
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:41,171
All we had were some Oreos.
How does that sound, honey?

963
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,342
Oh, my God.

964
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:50,597
He's got him wrapped up like a baby.

965
00:48:50,638 --> 00:48:51,431
He was...

966
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:53,725
He was a little chilly.

967
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:58,938
Well, here we are.

968
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,773
- The museum?
- Yeah.

969
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:01,858
- I thought we were going to dinner.
- First, I have a surprise.

970
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:06,029
- Surprise?
- It's the architecture exhibit.

971
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:08,114
- Architecture exhibit?
- Yeah.

972
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:12,285
- I got to eat something or I get the shakes.
- Come on. We'll eat in 20 minutes.

973
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:15,413
My friend Tucker is upstairs and I want you
to meet him. He's an architect, too.

974
00:49:15,663 --> 00:49:16,456
- Come on.
- Architect?

975
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,708
Yeah.

976
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:19,584
Tucker.

977
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:22,879
This is amazing.
It just blows me away.

978
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:28,134
What do you think this falls under?
ls this Art Deco, or is it Art Nouveau?

979
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:28,968
Uh...

980
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,011
Deco.

981
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:32,097
- Deco, yeah.
- Yeah.

982
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:34,182
It's beautiful.

983
00:49:34,432 --> 00:49:36,267
Is this... OK.

984
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:38,353
Is this a vestibule, or is it a portico?

985
00:49:38,603 --> 00:49:39,396
What is the difference
between the two?

986
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:41,481
Uh, when you're looking
at architecture,

987
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:44,609
try to visualise the buildings

988
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:46,695
as a whole, you know?

989
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:52,117
Uh, try to see them
in their natural state, in their

990
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:53,993
totalitarian... ism,

991
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,079
so to speak.

992
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,164
Stone crab time.

993
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:01,459
- Let's go to Joe's, huh?
- Hey, Tucker.

994
00:50:03,628 --> 00:50:05,630
Mary!

995
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:06,506
How are you?

996
00:50:06,756 --> 00:50:07,549
Good.

997
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:09,801
I'm glad we saw you.

998
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:11,720
Oh, come on, like you mean it.

999
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,848
Tucker, this is my friend, Pat Healy.

1000
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:16,933
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

1001
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:17,976
Same here.

1002
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:20,061
Pat is an architect as well.

1003
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:21,104
Oh, really?

1004
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:22,147
Where are your offices?

1005
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:24,232
Mainly, I work out of Boston.

1006
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:26,526
Boston, huh?

1007
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:28,403
Did you get your degree up there?

1008
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:30,697
You bet.

1009
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:32,574
Really? Where did you study?

1010
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:34,868
Harvard.

1011
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:37,787
Then you must've studied under Kim Green.

1012
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:40,040
Well, among others.

1013
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:41,958
You know, Pat, um

1014
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:44,044
does projects all over the world.

1015
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:47,339
Really? Where would I
have seen your work?

1016
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:49,257
Well, have you been to, uh

1017
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:51,343
well, let me see.

1018
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:54,679
Santiago, Chile?

1019
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:55,513
Twice last year.

1020
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:58,808
Which building's yours?

1021
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:01,770
Are you familiar
with the soccer stadium?

1022
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,898
Did you build
the Estadio Olimpico?

1023
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:06,983
No, just down the street

1024
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:11,321
the Celinto Catayente Towers.

1025
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:14,449
It's quite a fine example, in fact.

1026
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:15,325
I recommend that next time
you're up that way

1027
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:19,704
that you drop in and take
a ganders at it yourself.

1028
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:29,923
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man.

1029
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:30,965
Yeah, no problem.

1030
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:33,051
I've been driving for, like,
15 hours straight,

1031
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:35,136
so I could use the company.

1032
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:36,179
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1033
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:38,264
I've been standing in the same spot

1034
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,350
for five and a half hours.

1035
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,687
You know they made it illegal
to hitchhike in this state?

1036
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:44,521
Really?

1037
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,606
That must make it really tough.

1038
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:50,985
So, uh, what's going on with you?
You a salesman, or...

1039
00:51:51,027 --> 00:51:51,820
Uh, no, no,

1040
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:56,199
I'm... I'm... I'm nothing.

1041
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,284
I am.

1042
00:51:58,326 --> 00:52:00,328
- Yeah?
- I'm a salesman.

1043
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,455
I'm going to start my own company.

1044
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:03,289
Really?

1045
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,583
You want in?

1046
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:07,460
Uh...

1047
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:09,754
I... nah.

1048
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:12,841
I'm not... I don't really
have any money or...

1049
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:15,969
You heard ofthis thing
the 8-minute abs?

1050
00:52:16,052 --> 00:52:19,139
Yeah, sure, 8-minute abs.
Yeah, the exercise video.

1051
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:24,310
This is going to blow that
right out ofthe water. Listen to this.

1052
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:28,481
7-minute abs.

1053
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:30,608
Right.

1054
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,737
Yes. OK, all right,
I see where you're going.

1055
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:38,742
You walk into a video store. There's
8-minute abs and 7-minute abs beside it.

1056
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:40,827
Which one are you going to pick?

1057
00:52:41,077 --> 00:52:42,912
I'm... I would go for the seven.

1058
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:44,998
Bingo, man, bingo.

1059
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:46,041
7-minute abs.

1060
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:49,169
And we guarantee just a good a workout
as the 8-minute folk.

1061
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,297
You guarantee it? That's...
How do you do that?

1062
00:52:52,547 --> 00:52:55,425
If you're not happy
with the first seven minutes,

1063
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:59,596
we're going to send you
the extra minute free.

1064
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:02,724
You see? That's it. That's our motto.
That's where we're coming from.

1065
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:03,767
That's from A to B.

1066
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,895
That's right.
That's... that's good. That's good.

1067
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:07,937
Unless, of course,

1068
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:13,318
somebody comes up with 6-minute abs.
Then you're in trouble, huh?

1069
00:53:19,657 --> 00:53:20,450
No!

1070
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,535
No, no, not six.

1071
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:23,578
I said seven.

1072
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:24,621
Nobody's coming up with six.

1073
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:26,706
Who works out in six minutes?

1074
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:27,749
You won't even get your heart going,

1075
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:29,834
not even a mouse on a wheel.

1076
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:31,920
That... good point.

1077
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,005
Seven's the key number here.
Think about it.

1078
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:35,048
- 7-Elevens.
- Yeah.

1079
00:53:35,298 --> 00:53:37,300
Seven dwarves.

1080
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:38,176
Seven, man, that's the number.

1081
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:41,304
Seven chipmunks twirling on a branch,

1082
00:53:41,554 --> 00:53:44,599
eating lots of sunflowers
on my uncle's ranch.

1083
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:47,560
You know that old children's tale
from the sea.

1084
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,646
It's like you're dreaming
about Gorgonzola cheese

1085
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:54,025
when it's clearly Brie time, baby.

1086
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,902
Step into my office.

1087
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:56,945
Why?

1088
00:53:57,195 --> 00:53:59,030
'Cause you're fucking fired.

1089
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,158
Yeah. I got to pee.
I'm just going to pull over.

1090
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:05,286
Your car seats are making me itchy, man.

1091
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:09,666
What are these made out of? Cactus?

1092
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:16,965
I'm only waiting seven minutes total.

1093
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:25,098
Ohh!

1094
00:54:25,348 --> 00:54:26,141
Hey, wait your turn.

1095
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:29,477
Hey, I didn't...

1096
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:30,311
Whoa.

1097
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:32,397
Freeze!

1098
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:34,649
Wait a minute.

1099
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:37,610
This is a raid!

1100
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:39,904
No. No, no, no, I was peeing.

1101
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:41,781
That's what I was doing.
I was just peeing.

1102
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:42,824
I was peeing, too!

1103
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:45,952
Yeah, I'm sure you were all just pissing.
Let's go. Let's move it out.

1104
00:54:46,202 --> 00:54:48,246
Let's go.

1105
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,123
Come on.

1106
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:54,461
Shit! Jimmy Shay, is that you?

1107
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:12,228
Oh, my God.

1108
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:15,357
Ted?

1109
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,319
Ifyou'lljustletme
talk to you for one second

1110
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:20,362
outside ofthe truck.

1111
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:22,447
Look, lstillhave to pee, allright?

1112
00:55:22,697 --> 00:55:24,532
Get in the truck! Let's go. Let's go.

1113
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:25,575
Can lhave a cup?

1114
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:27,660
See, hon? I told you he was gay.

1115
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:29,746
We'll be rightback with more cops

1116
00:55:29,996 --> 00:55:33,041
Iive from the heartland.

1117
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,045
A veces pienso que aqui

1118
00:55:37,295 --> 00:55:40,340
Todo es seguridad

1119
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:44,511
Por la seca castidad

1120
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:48,682
Lo de antes fue algo

1121
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,894
Ahora es mejor

1122
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:57,065
Oh, yeah, ahora es mejor...

1123
00:55:57,107 --> 00:56:02,278
- Your grandmother is really something.
- Magda? No, Magda's not my grandmother.

1124
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,198
She rents the apartment next door.
Her husband died a couple years ago,

1125
00:56:05,448 --> 00:56:09,369
and I don't think she likes being alone.
So, you know, she just hangs out.

1126
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:12,497
- Doesn't cramp your style?
- Sadly, no.

1127
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:17,711
Sometimes I wish I could be like Magda
and not go home.

1128
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:22,924
I'd like to bounce around for a while
and do some travelling.

1129
00:56:23,174 --> 00:56:26,052
I don't know why anybody
would want to bounce around,

1130
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:29,180
you know, ifthey have
their own condo in Nepal.

1131
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:31,266
I'd be there in a second.

1132
00:56:31,516 --> 00:56:32,308
I'd sell it.

1133
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,351
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1134
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:37,522
Start fresh in a new place,
give up the architect game.

1135
00:56:37,772 --> 00:56:41,693
Slow things down a bit,
read more books, see more movies.

1136
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:43,778
Are you a movie buff?

1137
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:47,949
I try to be, but it's tough going out there
with all the crap they make today.

1138
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:51,077
I just wish they made movies
like they used to make.

1139
00:56:51,327 --> 00:56:53,163
You know, classics
like the Karate Kid

1140
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:56,499
or HaroldandMaude.

1141
00:56:57,584 --> 00:57:00,462
Harold andMaude
is my all-time favourite movie.

1142
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:02,547
Don't bust my chops.
I know it's corny, but...

1143
00:57:02,797 --> 00:57:03,590
Pat, I'm not kidding.

1144
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,675
I think that HaroldandMaude
is one ofthe greatest

1145
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:10,055
Iove stories of our time.

1146
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:15,268
Here I thought I was the only one.

1147
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,102
You're too good to be true.

1148
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:19,439
Come on, let's go dance.

1149
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:28,615
Man, they never
look like you'd expect, do they?

1150
00:57:28,865 --> 00:57:32,786
That's probably how he got his victim
to drop his guard.

1151
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,914
Where'd they find the body?

1152
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:40,085
In a big red bag
on the front passenger seat,

1153
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,379
all hacked up.

1154
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:45,507
Gruesome.

1155
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:48,635
Real psycho, this one.

1156
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:52,806
Hey, you're a little worked up.
Let me do the talking.

1157
00:57:55,975 --> 00:57:57,811
I'm Detective Stabler. This is Krevoy.

1158
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:01,981
Look, I didn't solicit any sex, OK?
This is a huge misunderstanding.

1159
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:04,067
I was really going out to pee.
I'm walking in the bushes,

1160
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:06,152
I trip over this guy and all of a sudden
there's all these cops...

1161
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:09,489
Ted, Ted, Ted, it's OK.

1162
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:12,617
We believe you.

1163
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:15,745
Oh.

1164
00:58:17,872 --> 00:58:19,708
The problem is,

1165
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:24,087
we found your friend in the car.

1166
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:26,131
Oh, the hitchhiker?

1167
00:58:26,214 --> 00:58:28,049
This is about the hitchhiker?

1168
00:58:28,299 --> 00:58:30,301
Oh.

1169
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:31,177
Oh, great.

1170
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:33,430
Just my luck.

1171
00:58:33,513 --> 00:58:35,348
I get caught for everything.

1172
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:37,600
So...

1173
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:39,728
You admit it?

1174
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:42,856
Uh, yeah. Guilty as charged.

1175
00:58:42,897 --> 00:58:47,861
Look, I know you guys have ajob to do
and I'm really sorry. I did it.

1176
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:48,903
I admit it.

1177
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:55,160
You know, the guy even told me,
the hitchhiker told me it was illegal, so...

1178
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,454
Well...

1179
00:58:57,495 --> 00:58:59,539
uh...

1180
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:01,624
Can you tell us his name?

1181
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,668
Uh...

1182
00:59:04,794 --> 00:59:06,629
No, I didn't catch it.

1183
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,843
Can we cut to the chase?
Am I in a lot oftrouble here, or...

1184
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:13,928
First, tell us why you did it.

1185
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:17,265
Why I did it? Um...

1186
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:21,436
I don't know. Boredom.

1187
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,441
The guy turns out to be a blabbermouth,
just would not shut up.

1188
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:27,484
I mean, with the... just...

1189
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:28,526
Ted,

1190
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:31,654
this wasn't your first time,

1191
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:33,948
was it?

1192
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,034
No.

1193
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:37,911
How many are we talking here?

1194
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:40,205
Hitchhikers?

1195
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:42,248
My whole life?

1196
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:43,124
Um...

1197
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:44,167
I don't know.

1198
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:48,546
25, 50. I mean, who keeps track?

1199
00:59:48,588 --> 00:59:51,466
Hey, I know this is the Bible belt,
but where I come from

1200
00:59:51,716 --> 00:59:53,551
this is not that big a deal.

1201
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:56,888
You son of a bitch.

1202
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,765
You're gonna fry.

1203
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:01,059
Come here!

1204
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:05,021
Take it easy! You OK?

1205
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:07,107
What the hell is wrong with you?

1206
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:09,359
You all right?

1207
01:00:30,296 --> 01:00:33,341
Your friend Tucker stopped by.

1208
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:35,468
Really?

1209
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:38,596
OK. What does it look like today?

1210
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:42,767
It's fiine. A little crazyin the afternoon.

1211
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:45,895
Hey, Tucker.

1212
01:00:45,937 --> 01:00:47,939
Eh, what's up, Doc?

1213
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:50,900
You look different.
Did you do something with your hair?

1214
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:55,071
The teeth. The teeth. I got them capped.

1215
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:57,157
Oh, yeah? Hey, they look great.

1216
01:00:57,407 --> 01:01:01,327
- You don't think they look a little big?
- No, not at all. The bigger the better.

1217
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:03,413
But they could be a little brighter.

1218
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:04,456
There's nothing more sexy to me

1219
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:07,584
than a guy with a mouthful
ofbigpearly whites.

1220
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:08,626
Oh, really?

1221
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:10,879
Come here.

1222
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:12,797
You ever had one
up the hatch in here.

1223
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:13,840
Tucker, behave yourself.

1224
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,134
I'll say.

1225
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:20,096
What can I do for you today, my friend?

1226
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:24,267
I wanted to talk to you
about yourfriendPatrick.

1227
01:01:24,517 --> 01:01:26,353
- He's a nice guy, huh?
- That's whatl'm trying to fiigure out.

1228
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:29,689
How long have you known him?

1229
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:31,566
Not very long, but I like him.

1230
01:01:31,816 --> 01:01:33,651
I know he's a little different,

1231
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:35,737
but that's what I like about him.

1232
01:01:35,987 --> 01:01:39,074
He dresses like a complete dork.

1233
01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:40,950
He chews with his mouth open.

1234
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:44,079
He hardly ever says the right thing,

1235
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,164
and he probablyfarts, too.

1236
01:01:46,414 --> 01:01:49,292
That's what you're looking for, is it?

1237
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:50,335
A farter?

1238
01:01:50,585 --> 01:01:52,420
No, I'm looking for a guy.

1239
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:56,591
Look, something struck me as strange
about him last night.

1240
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:57,634
He...

1241
01:01:57,884 --> 01:01:59,719
He gave me this funny vibe.

1242
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:02,847
Anyway, I called
some friends up north,

1243
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:07,018
and they've never heard of an architect
named Patrick Healy.

1244
01:02:07,268 --> 01:02:09,104
He's notlistedas a Harvardalumnus.

1245
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:12,399
Fuck!

1246
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:14,317
- That's strange.
- Yes, I thought so.

1247
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:17,445
Anyway, I hope you don't
think I'm being meddlesome.

1248
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:21,616
It's just that I think you should
be careful with this guy, that's all.

1249
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:27,038
I mean, let's face it, you're beautiful, and

1250
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,915
and you've got money,
and you trust people.

1251
01:02:29,165 --> 01:02:32,043
I'm just saying
there's a lot of psychos out there.

1252
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:34,337
Just be careful.

1253
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:35,171
Fucker!

1254
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:39,342
Look, Tucker, thank you.
I really appreciate you looking out for me.

1255
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:43,680
OK, listen, I'll call you, OK?

1256
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:45,807
OK.

1257
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:50,979
Oh, damn.

1258
01:02:56,276 --> 01:03:03,491
- You want me to get those for you?
- No. I have to learn to do this myself.

1259
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,704
Damn!

1260
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:10,623
My leg.

1261
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:12,917
Could you, Mary?

1262
01:03:12,959 --> 01:03:14,961
Thank you.

1263
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:18,089
Wait. Wait.

1264
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:21,259
There.

1265
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:30,435
- See?
- Yeah.

1266
01:03:30,685 --> 01:03:31,478
I knew I could do it.

1267
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:33,563
Here, let me get the door.

1268
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:35,857
Thank you.

1269
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:36,691
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

1270
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:40,028
Jane, can you get the door for Tucker?

1271
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,905
Do you want me to...

1272
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,990
No. I've done this a thousand times.

1273
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,284
OK.

1274
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:57,545
Mr Stroehmann, on behalf ofthe South
Carolina Law Enforcement Community,

1275
01:03:57,796 --> 01:04:03,968
I would like to apologise to you
for any pain or temporary inconvenience

1276
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:06,096
that you may have been caused.

1277
01:04:06,137 --> 01:04:08,139
Ohh.

1278
01:04:09,265 --> 01:04:12,310
At approximately 10.40 this morning,

1279
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:15,271
a man was apprehended not far
from where you were arrested.

1280
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:18,608
He was identified
as an escaped mental patient.

1281
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:21,528
Subsequently, he confessed to the murder
you're being held for.

1282
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:24,656
Lab tests confirm a fingerprint match.

1283
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:27,951
You mean I'm free to go?

1284
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:31,079
No harm, no foul.

1285
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:36,334
Oh, by the way,
there's someone there to see you.

1286
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:42,549
Shut up!

1287
01:04:48,888 --> 01:04:49,681
Phew!

1288
01:04:49,931 --> 01:04:53,018
You are a lucky son of a bitch,
you know that?

1289
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:55,061
I am?

1290
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:55,937
Yeah.

1291
01:04:56,187 --> 01:04:56,980
Didn't they tell you?

1292
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:01,151
That hitcher was about to cut your throat
before you decided to take a piss.

1293
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:04,487
Got a fucking horseshoe
up your ass, my man.

1294
01:05:07,657 --> 01:05:11,786
You got that nervous hive thing again?

1295
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:12,620
Yeah.

1296
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:18,001
Yeah, I do, Ted, um,
because I got some bad news.

1297
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:20,128
Are you OK?

1298
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:25,300
Ted, I'm dying.

1299
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:31,598
Oh, my...

1300
01:05:32,682 --> 01:05:35,769
Ted, I'm not dying, man. Come on!

1301
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:40,940
Jesus, it's just the humidity down here.

1302
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:43,902
No, the bad news I got
is about our friend Healy.

1303
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:45,987
I sent my assistant down to his apartment
with his last pay cheque.

1304
01:05:46,237 --> 01:05:48,073
The landlady said
when he came back from Miami

1305
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:52,243
he kept talking about
falling for some doctor named Mary.

1306
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:54,537
Mary?

1307
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:56,414
My Mary?

1308
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:57,457
Well...

1309
01:05:57,707 --> 01:06:01,836
Ted, here's Healy's address down there.

1310
01:06:01,878 --> 01:06:05,799
And in the future, do a little research before
you send a guy like that out into the woods.

1311
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:10,178
I mean, Jesus Christ, it's creepy, OK?

1312
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:14,349
You're not seriously thinking
about going out with this guy again?

1313
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:15,183
Mary, honey, he's a psycho.

1314
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:17,268
Mary, the guy's full of shit.

1315
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,605
Jesus, this sucks.

1316
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:23,692
It's too bad this had to happen.

1317
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:25,610
He was almost perfect.

1318
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,738
Mary, what did you say
Pat's last name was?

1319
01:06:28,988 --> 01:06:29,781
Healy.

1320
01:06:30,031 --> 01:06:33,118
Come here, come here.
Come on, you got to hear this.

1321
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:33,952
What?

1322
01:06:34,202 --> 01:06:34,994
That'sjust the way
us Healys were raised.

1323
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:37,080
So, where the hellare you, Healy?

1324
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:40,208
Ah, lgota date tonight
with thatMarygirll toldyou about.

1325
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,293
- The sawbones?
- Yep.

1326
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:46,631
- We hit the mother lode.
- Should we be listening to this?

1327
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:47,507
Shh, shh, shh!

1328
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:49,592
Does she still think
you're a fucking architect?

1329
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:50,635
Oh, yeah.

1330
01:06:50,885 --> 01:06:52,721
Dumb shit.

1331
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:53,763
Mr Perfect, huh?

1332
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:55,849
Hey, watch your mouth.

1333
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:57,934
She's a great gal, Mary.

1334
01:06:58,184 --> 01:07:00,020
I'm the dumb shit for lying to her.

1335
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:03,148
Why didn'tyoujust tellher the truth?

1336
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:04,190
I don't know.

1337
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:08,361
It seems that women today
are more impressedby the almightybuck

1338
01:07:08,611 --> 01:07:14,826
than some schmo who's spent 17years
scraping by on peace corps wages.

1339
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:15,660
If she's as special as you say,

1340
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:18,788
she's going to want to hear
about the things you did.

1341
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,959
You could tell her about
the irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan.

1342
01:07:23,209 --> 01:07:26,087
The orphan babies
who cried in your arms in

1343
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:27,130
Romania.

1344
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,215
The hope

1345
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:32,344
you gave Freddy the leperin Calcutta.

1346
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:35,638
I'll be honest with you.
I'm a selfiish prick.

1347
01:07:35,722 --> 01:07:39,809
I get a high from helping all God's creatures.

1348
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:43,813
An honest-to-goodness high.
I didall those things formyself.

1349
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:46,107
Hey, hey, hey.

1350
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:49,235
That's, uh...

1351
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,155
That's, uh... that's bullshit, man.

1352
01:07:52,405 --> 01:07:55,283
Hey. Hey, you were on the front line.

1353
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:57,577
You remember?

1354
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:02,582
The, um, malaria, the typhoon fever,
that vicious strain ofgenitalherpes?

1355
01:08:02,832 --> 01:08:04,876
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

1356
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:06,920
Fuck!

1357
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:13,009
Yeah. I curedallsorts ofhorrible
illnesses in Third World countries.

1358
01:08:13,259 --> 01:08:16,137
But the bottom line is, I'm not
going to use myphilanthropy

1359
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:19,265
as some kind ofcurrency,
especially after whatl did.

1360
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:22,560
I lied to that poor girl.

1361
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:26,731
Lied, man!

1362
01:08:26,815 --> 01:08:28,858
Well,...

1363
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,735
Love will make you do fucked-up things.

1364
01:08:30,985 --> 01:08:32,821
You saidit, mister.

1365
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:35,115
I got to run.

1366
01:08:35,156 --> 01:08:37,158
We're dicks.

1367
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:46,584
It's him! It's him!

1368
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:49,671
Mary.

1369
01:08:49,754 --> 01:08:51,798
Hello.

1370
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,926
Um, Mary, look...

1371
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:57,846
Look, there's something
I have to tell you.

1372
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:02,225
I'm not the architect...

1373
01:09:08,523 --> 01:09:09,315
OK, guys, let's huddle up.

1374
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:10,358
Come on, Jimmy!

1375
01:09:10,608 --> 01:09:12,610
Jimmy, I'm open! Hit me! Come on!

1376
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:22,871
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1377
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:23,913
Whoo!

1378
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:27,208
Exceptional, my ass.

1379
01:09:39,804 --> 01:09:42,682
Looks like I double jumped you
for the win.

1380
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:44,976
Pay up, big guy.

1381
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:49,981
- Coconut.
- Yeah, very good. Coconut.

1382
01:09:50,231 --> 01:09:52,275
Coconut.

1383
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:54,319
Where's the rest of it, Warren?

1384
01:10:05,872 --> 01:10:06,664
Look at her.

1385
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:09,793
She's more beautiful than I remember.

1386
01:10:10,043 --> 01:10:12,087
She's perfect.

1387
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:15,006
Thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mar.

1388
01:10:15,256 --> 01:10:17,092
Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.

1389
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:21,429
Don't worry about it. It was fun.

1390
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:27,727
- Euch!
- Fuck me.

1391
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:29,604
Whoa.

1392
01:10:29,854 --> 01:10:31,690
How's my stomach taste?

1393
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,775
Oh. How's my stomach taste, she says.

1394
01:10:34,025 --> 01:10:36,903
Holy shit, look.
Look, there's Warren.

1395
01:10:37,153 --> 01:10:40,031
Franks and beans!

1396
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:42,117
- Frank and beans!
- Warren, come on, you just ate.

1397
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:45,245
Hey, leave him alone. He's just got
a big appetite. Right, Warren?

1398
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:46,287
Huh?

1399
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:49,624
I said you got a big...

1400
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:52,544
Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren!

1401
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:54,838
Oh, yes. Uh-huh.

1402
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:58,800
You can't touch his ears
unless he trusts you. Are you OK?

1403
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:00,885
Not to worry.

1404
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:01,928
So I'll see you tonight, right?

1405
01:11:02,178 --> 01:11:04,180
Sure.

1406
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:08,184
Here, Warren.

1407
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,270
- You OK?
- He broke it.

1408
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,564
I saw.

1409
01:11:12,605 --> 01:11:14,441
OK. What are you waiting for? Let's go.

1410
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:15,483
What? No.

1411
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:16,526
I don't know what to say.

1412
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:18,611
Just tell her the truth about Healy.

1413
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:21,740
Blow the schmuck
out ofthe water. Come on.

1414
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,782
No, I can't.

1415
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:27,120
I unleashed the psycho on her.
She's going to be fucking pissed.

1416
01:11:27,203 --> 01:11:29,247
Mary!

1417
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,462
Mary?

1418
01:11:36,588 --> 01:11:39,674
Mary? ls that...

1419
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:40,508
It is you.

1420
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:43,845
Who is that?

1421
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:45,889
Hi. It's Ted.

1422
01:11:45,972 --> 01:11:48,016
Ted?

1423
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:49,893
Yeah, Ted from Rhode lsland. Ted.

1424
01:11:50,143 --> 01:11:51,978
Ted? Oh, my God.

1425
01:11:52,228 --> 01:11:53,021
Ted!

1426
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:55,315
How are you?

1427
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,192
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1428
01:11:57,442 --> 01:11:58,234
How you been?

1429
01:11:58,485 --> 01:11:59,277
I'm...

1430
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:02,405
I haven't seen you since... since...

1431
01:12:02,655 --> 01:12:04,491
Yeah. Since... since, um...

1432
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:05,533
Senior prom.

1433
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:07,619
That's right... senior prom.

1434
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:09,704
I... you got a great memory.

1435
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:11,790
Oh, man, that was...

1436
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,084
I haven't thought about that in years.

1437
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:16,169
So, um...

1438
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:18,254
How's everything?

1439
01:12:18,296 --> 01:12:19,089
Everything, you know.

1440
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:21,174
Oh, oh, that's fine.

1441
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:24,302
You know, I was in and out ofthe hospital
in a couple ofweeks.

1442
01:12:24,552 --> 01:12:25,345
It was not a big deal at all.

1443
01:12:25,595 --> 01:12:26,388
Now I'm good.

1444
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:29,724
Strong like bull.

1445
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:30,558
Really good.

1446
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:31,601
Hey, hi, Warren.

1447
01:12:31,851 --> 01:12:32,644
Hi, Ted.

1448
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:36,981
- How are you?
- I'm... how are you?

1449
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:38,900
I can't believe that he remembers you.

1450
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:39,943
Piggyback ride?

1451
01:12:40,193 --> 01:12:44,114
Oh, piggyback... no.
I'll take a rain check this time, OK?

1452
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:47,409
He never remembers anybody.
It's amazing.

1453
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:49,327
So, what are you doing here?

1454
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:51,579
Do you work here?

1455
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:53,498
This is my office. Well, it's up there.

1456
01:12:53,748 --> 01:12:56,626
I was just out
on my lunch break with Warren.

1457
01:12:56,876 --> 01:13:00,797
- It's crazy. What are you doing here?
- Well, that's a funny story.

1458
01:13:01,047 --> 01:13:02,882
I was... I decided to...

1459
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:06,011
I got in the car with my friend, um

1460
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:11,391
and we just, uh...
we came down to Florida, right?

1461
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,603
Right.

1462
01:13:15,645 --> 01:13:18,523
Well, you look great.
You look really good.

1463
01:13:18,773 --> 01:13:19,566
I mean, what's the story?
Are you married?

1464
01:13:19,816 --> 01:13:21,651
Do you have kids? What's the deal?

1465
01:13:21,901 --> 01:13:23,737
No. Dodged a few bullets.

1466
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:25,989
Yeah?

1467
01:13:26,072 --> 01:13:27,907
God, this is just so... bizarre.

1468
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:29,993
I mean, I'm standing
here with Mary Jensen.

1469
01:13:30,243 --> 01:13:32,078
No, no. Now it's Mary Matthews.

1470
01:13:32,328 --> 01:13:34,164
Oh. Did you...

1471
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:37,292
No, no. I haven't walked
down that plank yet, no.

1472
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:40,420
But, uh, it was this thing in college.

1473
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,505
This creepy guy who...

1474
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:44,591
Anyhow, there was a restraining order,

1475
01:13:44,841 --> 01:13:47,719
got kind of ugly,
and after Princeton, I just decided

1476
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:49,804
be cautious. Change your name.

1477
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:51,890
Just kind of leave that behind.

1478
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:55,018
Right. That sounds... that sounds horrible.

1479
01:13:55,268 --> 01:13:56,061
It was... yeah.

1480
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:59,189
It was, but it's over, I think, so it's good.

1481
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:00,231
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

1482
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:04,402
Do you think maybe you want to maybe,
I don't know, go out to dinner?

1483
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:05,445
Catch up on old times.

1484
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,740
Didn't we just do that?

1485
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:15,038
I'm fucking with you, Ted.

1486
01:14:17,165 --> 01:14:23,171
No. Listen, I'd like to, it'd be great,
but, I sort of already have plans tonight.

1487
01:14:23,421 --> 01:14:25,256
But I'm free tomorrow night.

1488
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:26,299
Yeah, sure. Or, you know

1489
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:29,427
or you could just blow offthatjerk
you're going out with tonight

1490
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:32,764
and come out with me.

1491
01:14:33,848 --> 01:14:35,684
What hotel are you staying at?

1492
01:14:35,934 --> 01:14:38,978
Uh, the Cardoza.

1493
01:14:41,147 --> 01:14:42,982
- Pick you up at 8.00?
- Sure.

1494
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:44,025
- OK
- OK.

1495
01:14:44,275 --> 01:14:45,068
Cool. See you.

1496
01:14:45,318 --> 01:14:47,320
Bye.

1497
01:14:47,404 --> 01:14:49,239
Look closely at this picture

1498
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:52,367
Ted and Mary like before

1499
01:14:52,617 --> 01:14:54,452
Can you see her as Ted sees her

1500
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:57,580
And why he couldn't wait no more?

1501
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:59,666
And ifyou still think he's being silly

1502
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:02,794
Then you've still got more to see

1503
01:15:03,044 --> 01:15:04,879
'Cause this isn'tjust a date, folks

1504
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,965
This is chemistry

1505
01:15:07,215 --> 01:15:09,259
And Mary

1506
01:15:10,343 --> 01:15:15,515
Well, there's just somethin' about Mary

1507
01:15:23,898 --> 01:15:29,029
Banana!
We're gonna be buyin'bananas tonight!

1508
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:29,904
Ooh!

1509
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:30,947
Why's that?

1510
01:15:31,197 --> 01:15:33,033
'Cause back when I was your age,

1511
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:38,246
I always used to make myself
a big banana split after sex.

1512
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:39,289
I think you're gonna need one tonight.

1513
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:41,374
Oh. Don't get ahead ofyourself, Magda.

1514
01:15:41,624 --> 01:15:44,502
You'll probably be eating
a banana split before I do.

1515
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:46,796
Don't bet on it.

1516
01:15:46,838 --> 01:15:48,673
Last time I had a pap smear,

1517
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:53,011
the guy needed leather gloves
and an oyster shucker.

1518
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:58,058
I am a little psyched.

1519
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:02,228
I ran into this guy
I haven'tseen since high school.

1520
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:04,314
An oldflame?

1521
01:16:04,564 --> 01:16:07,609
Kind of. Ted Stroehmann.

1522
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:10,779
The sweetestguyin the world.

1523
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:15,784
He was so cute. He was so clumsy
and he had this huge mouth full of metal.

1524
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:19,079
You know how I like braces.

1525
01:16:19,162 --> 01:16:20,997
Anyhow, we're going out tonight.

1526
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:23,249
Oh, no!

1527
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:26,211
Oh, God, that reminds me.
I have to cancel what's-his-face.

1528
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:29,547
What's-his-face?

1529
01:16:31,675 --> 01:16:32,467
Who is it?

1530
01:16:32,717 --> 01:16:34,719
It's Tucker.

1531
01:16:35,845 --> 01:16:36,638
Tucker.

1532
01:16:36,888 --> 01:16:38,723
- Hello, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

1533
01:16:38,973 --> 01:16:39,766
I'm fine, thank you.

1534
01:16:40,016 --> 01:16:40,809
Oh, look who's here.

1535
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:43,061
There she is.

1536
01:16:43,144 --> 01:16:46,022
I brought you a little thirst quencher, Mag.

1537
01:16:46,272 --> 01:16:47,065
Oh, aren't you sweet?

1538
01:16:47,315 --> 01:16:49,150
No, I'm not. I

1539
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:52,487
just want to get you drunk
so you'll pass out,

1540
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:54,531
and I can give Mary a good rogering.

1541
01:16:54,614 --> 01:16:56,449
You want me to pour you one?

1542
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,535
Uh, thanks, but I have to be going.

1543
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:00,620
Unfortunately, this is not a social visit.

1544
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:02,706
Really? What's up?

1545
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:06,001
Well, I've got a little more news
about your friend Healy.

1546
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:09,129
Tucker, everything's OK.

1547
01:17:09,212 --> 01:17:11,047
He confessed everything.
He told me he's not an architect.

1548
01:17:11,297 --> 01:17:14,175
You were right, but right now
I'm actually running behind.

1549
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:16,469
Mary, the man's a killer.

1550
01:17:16,511 --> 01:17:17,303
What?

1551
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:20,432
Yes. Ihave a friend
in the Boston police department.

1552
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:24,602
He faxedme this this morning.
I'lljustgive you the highlights.

1553
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:27,731
After a short stint as a petty thief,

1554
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:32,944
Patrick R Healy graduated
to armed robbery by the age of 14.

1555
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:37,323
At 16, he committed his first murder,

1556
01:17:37,365 --> 01:17:40,243
a pretty teacher's aide
named Molly Pettygrove.

1557
01:17:40,493 --> 01:17:42,328
He was incarcerated
until the age of 22,

1558
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:44,414
when despite a grim
psychological profile,

1559
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:46,499
the state was forced to release him.

1560
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,627
In his mid-20s and again in his early 30s,

1561
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:53,798
he was suspected of homicides
in the states of Utah and Washington.

1562
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:58,178
Unfortunately, the bodies
were so badly decomposed,

1563
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:01,306
there wasn't enough evidence to hold him.
And so on and so forth.

1564
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:03,183
You guys, whatam lgonna do?

1565
01:18:03,433 --> 01:18:05,268
I'm supposed to meet this guyin an hour.

1566
01:18:05,518 --> 01:18:10,648
Well, just calm down.
Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry.

1567
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:12,776
Tucker.

1568
01:18:12,817 --> 01:18:15,695
Why you two
never hooked up is beyond me.

1569
01:18:15,945 --> 01:18:18,823
I'm so lucky to have you as a friend.

1570
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:21,951
Yes, well, don't get all gooey on me now.

1571
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:26,122
You're gonna give me a big head.
See, the important thing, Doctor,

1572
01:18:26,373 --> 01:18:28,208
is you have to distance
yourself as much as possible

1573
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:31,544
without pissing this psycho off.

1574
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:33,421
OK.

1575
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:36,549
I know what I got to do,
I know what I got to do.

1576
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,886
Where's the phone?

1577
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:55,527
You're gonna pay, fucker.

1578
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:14,087
I don't know, Dom.

1579
01:19:14,337 --> 01:19:18,466
I don't feel good. I feel nervous.
I really feel nervous.

1580
01:19:18,508 --> 01:19:20,343
Oh, come on, relax. Relax.

1581
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:21,386
Been to the cash machine?

1582
01:19:21,636 --> 01:19:22,429
Yeah.

1583
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,681
- Car clean?
- Uh-huh.

1584
01:19:24,764 --> 01:19:25,557
- Plenty of gas?
- Uh-huh.

1585
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:28,852
Mmm. Breath. How's your breath?

1586
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:30,770
It's fine. I had some Altoids.

1587
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:31,813
All right, I think you're all set.

1588
01:19:32,063 --> 01:19:34,941
So just go clean the pipes, and it's a go.

1589
01:19:35,191 --> 01:19:35,984
Huh?

1590
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:39,112
You know, clean the pipes.

1591
01:19:39,362 --> 01:19:41,197
What do you mean, clean the pipes?

1592
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:46,411
You choke the chicken
before any big date, don't you?

1593
01:19:46,661 --> 01:19:51,791
Tell me you spank the monkey
before any big date.

1594
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:56,838
Oh, my God. He doesn't flog the dolphin
before a big date. Are you crazy?

1595
01:19:57,088 --> 01:19:58,923
That's like going out there
with a loaded gun.

1596
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:02,052
Of course that's why you're nervous.

1597
01:20:02,302 --> 01:20:05,180
Oh, my dear friend, please sit. Please.

1598
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:07,474
Uhh, look, um...

1599
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:10,393
After you've had sex with a girl,

1600
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:12,479
and you're lying in bed with her,

1601
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:13,521
are you nervous?

1602
01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:14,564
No.

1603
01:20:14,814 --> 01:20:17,859
No, you're not. Why?

1604
01:20:17,942 --> 01:20:19,986
'Cause I'm tired.

1605
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:20,820
Wrong!

1606
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:23,948
It's 'cause you ain't got the baby batter
on the brain any more.

1607
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:27,077
Jesus, that stuffwill fuck your head up.

1608
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:29,329
Oh. Look...

1609
01:20:29,412 --> 01:20:32,290
The most honest moment in a man's life

1610
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,376
are the few minutes
after he's blown his load.

1611
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:37,504
Now, that is a medical fact
and the reason for it

1612
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:40,632
is that you're no longer
trying to get laid.

1613
01:20:40,882 --> 01:20:43,760
You're actually thinking like a girl

1614
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:44,803
and girls love that.

1615
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:47,097
Holy shit.

1616
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:51,267
I've been going out with a loaded gun.

1617
01:20:51,309 --> 01:20:54,396
People get hurt that way.

1618
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:23,383
Ohh! Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

1619
01:21:23,633 --> 01:21:25,677
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1620
01:21:26,761 --> 01:21:29,639
Healy, how... how smashing to see you.

1621
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:30,682
You're dead! You fuckup!

1622
01:21:30,932 --> 01:21:31,725
OK, take it easy.

1623
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:35,895
Who the fuck do you think you are
making that shit up about me?

1624
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:37,981
It's that stalker - Ted.

1625
01:21:38,231 --> 01:21:40,066
He got ahold ofyou, didn't he?

1626
01:21:40,316 --> 01:21:43,194
You're working for him,
aren't you, you little shit?

1627
01:21:43,445 --> 01:21:45,488
Who?

1628
01:21:51,786 --> 01:21:54,664
Either you come clean,
or I'm gonna kick your fucking ass!

1629
01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:57,959
I love her, man!

1630
01:21:58,043 --> 01:21:58,835
What?

1631
01:21:59,085 --> 01:22:02,130
You heard me, God damn it.

1632
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:07,385
I love Mary, man.

1633
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:11,556
I'm a phony, just like you.

1634
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,476
What do you mean?

1635
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:17,771
I mean, I'm a fucking fraud.

1636
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:21,941
I'm no architect. Don't be a putz, man.

1637
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:27,197
Who's been to Santiago, Chile,
twice in one year?

1638
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:29,074
I've never even been in Jersey!

1639
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:31,159
OK, OK. Just take it easy.

1640
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:34,287
Wait a minute.
You knew those people back at Harvard.

1641
01:22:34,537 --> 01:22:37,624
I knew shit, man.

1642
01:22:37,665 --> 01:22:40,543
The only thing I knew
was that you were a fake,

1643
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:42,837
and I made up everything else.

1644
01:22:42,879 --> 01:22:44,881
My real name's Norm.

1645
01:22:44,964 --> 01:22:48,009
I'm a pizza delivery boy.

1646
01:22:48,093 --> 01:22:50,136
Here.

1647
01:22:50,178 --> 01:22:52,180
Look. Here's my ID.

1648
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:02,649
Fuck me.

1649
01:23:21,459 --> 01:23:23,461
Keep the change.

1650
01:23:56,911 --> 01:23:58,955
Yeah!

1651
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,298
Oh.

1652
01:24:19,851 --> 01:24:21,686
Where the

1653
01:24:21,936 --> 01:24:23,938
hell did it go?

1654
01:24:26,107 --> 01:24:26,900
Uh, hang on.

1655
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:30,236
Wait a second.

1656
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:48,797
- Hello. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

1657
01:24:49,047 --> 01:24:51,049
- Good.
- Good.

1658
01:24:51,132 --> 01:24:52,967
You are looking very beautiful.

1659
01:24:53,218 --> 01:24:55,220
Thank you.

1660
01:24:56,346 --> 01:24:58,348
What is that?

1661
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:01,309
On your ear.

1662
01:25:01,559 --> 01:25:03,561
Ear?

1663
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:05,689
No, your left ear.

1664
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:07,774
Is that...

1665
01:25:09,901 --> 01:25:11,945
Is that hair gel?

1666
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:13,822
Yeah.

1667
01:25:14,072 --> 01:25:15,907
Great. I could use some.

1668
01:25:16,157 --> 01:25:17,992
No. You don't have to. You don't...

1669
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:21,329
I just ran out.

1670
01:25:23,456 --> 01:25:25,291
How we doing over here?

1671
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:26,334
OK.

1672
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:27,377
Little more wine?

1673
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:29,629
Sure.

1674
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:31,548
So... so when you say, um

1675
01:25:31,798 --> 01:25:32,590
killer, you mean...

1676
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:34,676
He's a murderer. Yeah.

1677
01:25:34,926 --> 01:25:36,928
Like an actual convicted murderer?

1678
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:38,847
He killed people. I know. It's crazy.

1679
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:40,932
And, uh, what?
Did he ever go to jail?

1680
01:25:41,182 --> 01:25:41,975
Yeah. In Boston.

1681
01:25:42,225 --> 01:25:44,269
He spent I don't know how long, but...

1682
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:45,103
And he just got out?

1683
01:25:45,353 --> 01:25:46,146
Well, it's obviously... the system sucks.

1684
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:48,231
The guy's walking the streets.

1685
01:25:48,481 --> 01:25:49,274
I'm kissing him.

1686
01:25:49,524 --> 01:25:51,359
Right. But you didn't do anything

1687
01:25:51,609 --> 01:25:52,402
else, right?

1688
01:25:52,652 --> 01:25:53,445
What?

1689
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,740
I mean, you didn't...

1690
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:01,786
No. No, no, no.
God, I couldn't live with myself.

1691
01:26:02,037 --> 01:26:03,872
I mean, I only went out
with him a couple oftimes,

1692
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:07,208
but, you know, it's like,
just the thought ofthat...

1693
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:11,171
I shouldn't be putting this all on you.

1694
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:14,299
I'm sorry. We haven't
seen each other in so long.

1695
01:26:14,549 --> 01:26:17,427
No. It's... it's just I feel really bad.

1696
01:26:17,677 --> 01:26:19,512
I'm tired oftalking about stalkers.

1697
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:21,806
Let's talk about you.

1698
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:24,934
Are you OK? Yeah?

1699
01:26:24,976 --> 01:26:28,021
- Do you want some water?
- No. I'm good.

1700
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:29,939
Hey, Tracy, how are the twins?

1701
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:30,982
Fuck you, Norm.

1702
01:26:31,232 --> 01:26:35,320
I like it when you
talk dirt to me, man.

1703
01:26:35,403 --> 01:26:36,196
Here you go, big guy.

1704
01:26:36,446 --> 01:26:40,575
Come on. Cough it up, chompers.

1705
01:26:46,873 --> 01:26:49,751
How the hell did you meet Mary?

1706
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:51,836
It was just dumb luck, really.

1707
01:26:52,087 --> 01:26:53,922
I delivered a pie to her one night,

1708
01:26:54,172 --> 01:26:58,259
and she answered the door
in her nightgown and, whoa.

1709
01:26:58,343 --> 01:26:59,135
That was it for me.

1710
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:01,429
I went home that night,
shaved my beard

1711
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:05,558
and a week later I'm laid out in her office
with a broken back.

1712
01:27:05,642 --> 01:27:06,434
Broken back?

1713
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:07,477
How'd you do that?

1714
01:27:07,727 --> 01:27:10,814
A friend. Baseball bat.

1715
01:27:10,855 --> 01:27:12,899
Ah. Touché.

1716
01:27:16,069 --> 01:27:17,904
Do you want another one?

1717
01:27:18,154 --> 01:27:20,198
Uh, sure. Yeah.

1718
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,283
Hey, Docky.

1719
01:27:22,325 --> 01:27:24,160
Couple more nitrate-sicles, please.

1720
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:25,203
Two corn dogs coming up.

1721
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:29,374
I don't think that they
have enough meats on sticks.

1722
01:27:29,624 --> 01:27:30,417
No, seriously. Ifyou think about it,

1723
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:32,502
they have plenty of sweets, right?

1724
01:27:32,752 --> 01:27:34,587
They have lollipops,
they have fudgesicles.

1725
01:27:34,838 --> 01:27:35,630
They have popsicles,

1726
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,967
but they don't have
any other meat on sticks.

1727
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:41,011
Yes, you don't see
that many meats on sticks.

1728
01:27:41,094 --> 01:27:41,886
No, absolutely not.

1729
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:42,929
You know what I'd like to see?

1730
01:27:43,179 --> 01:27:46,057
I'd like to see more meats in a cone.

1731
01:27:46,307 --> 01:27:47,100
You don't hardly ever see that.

1732
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:51,479
That's an idea I think is waiting to pop.

1733
01:27:51,521 --> 01:27:55,442
Just like a nice, big,
oversized waffle cone stuffed full of

1734
01:27:55,692 --> 01:27:57,527
chopped liver.

1735
01:27:57,777 --> 01:27:58,570
Exactly.

1736
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,655
It's too bad you don't live here, Ted.

1737
01:28:00,905 --> 01:28:01,698
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1738
01:28:01,948 --> 01:28:05,035
We have a lot in common.

1739
01:28:05,076 --> 01:28:07,954
Well, you know, maybe, um...

1740
01:28:08,204 --> 01:28:10,040
Have you ever thought about, uh

1741
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,125
maybe moving back up to Rhode lsland?

1742
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:16,296
I thought about it, but I got too much
of a good thing going on here.

1743
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:21,718
I got a great practice,
like the people I work with, Warren.

1744
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:27,974
Maybe you should just, like,
move down here and marry me.

1745
01:28:30,101 --> 01:28:31,936
So you're a writer.

1746
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:34,022
Yeah, well, I'm trying to be.

1747
01:28:34,272 --> 01:28:37,150
Well, the good thing about writing

1748
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,193
is you can do it anywhere.

1749
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:40,487
That's true.

1750
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:43,406
How about you?

1751
01:28:43,656 --> 01:28:47,577
How did you manage
to stay single all these years?

1752
01:28:47,827 --> 01:28:55,085
Well, I'm bisexual, so that's hard
for a lot of guys to understand.

1753
01:28:55,126 --> 01:28:55,919
Well...

1754
01:28:56,169 --> 01:28:59,255
You gonna smoke that?

1755
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:04,260
You know, I read somewhere
that most women are

1756
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:05,303
if you really ask them honestly,

1757
01:29:05,553 --> 01:29:07,389
have tendencies towards...

1758
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:12,602
- I mean, everybody has a bit of...
- Ted, I'm fucking with you.

1759
01:29:12,852 --> 01:29:14,896
Yeah.

1760
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:19,067
Stalking motherfucker.

1761
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:22,195
I know. It sickens me.

1762
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:26,366
Actually, I did almost get married once.

1763
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:30,328
What happened?

1764
01:29:30,578 --> 01:29:33,665
Well, he was a really great guy.

1765
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:36,751
He lived up north, and, uh...

1766
01:29:36,835 --> 01:29:38,878
Come on, let's go.

1767
01:29:44,134 --> 01:29:46,177
Here you go.

1768
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:04,946
Wait. How many is this?

1769
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:08,074
- Four.
- Four?

1770
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:10,994
That seems like an awful of lot of speed
to give one little pooch.

1771
01:30:11,244 --> 01:30:13,079
Are you sure it won't kill him?

1772
01:30:13,329 --> 01:30:16,416
I never said that.

1773
01:30:18,543 --> 01:30:20,587
There's a baby.

1774
01:30:25,842 --> 01:30:27,677
Ah, good, good, good, good.

1775
01:30:27,927 --> 01:30:29,929
So...

1776
01:30:30,013 --> 01:30:33,099
Then it was over.
We really haven't spoken since.

1777
01:30:33,141 --> 01:30:37,062
Hmm. Wow. Sounds like
he was almost perfect.

1778
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:38,104
Hmm.

1779
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:40,398
Almost.

1780
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:45,403
Hey, you want to go upstairs
and watch Sportscentre?

1781
01:30:45,653 --> 01:30:47,697
Uh...

1782
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:50,617
You know, I think I'm just
gonna quit while I'm ahead.

1783
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:53,953
You're not that far ahead, Ted.

1784
01:31:00,251 --> 01:31:02,295
Magda!

1785
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:04,172
What are you doing?

1786
01:31:04,422 --> 01:31:08,510
Hi, hon. Just straightening up.

1787
01:31:11,721 --> 01:31:12,514
Put that down!

1788
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:14,808
Whoa.

1789
01:31:15,892 --> 01:31:17,936
Magda!

1790
01:31:17,977 --> 01:31:19,979
Thanks, doll.

1791
01:31:22,148 --> 01:31:24,150
Magda. Magda.

1792
01:31:24,234 --> 01:31:26,069
Honey, where is Puffy?

1793
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:29,197
Oh. He was being a pest,
so I put him in the bathroom.

1794
01:31:29,447 --> 01:31:31,449
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1795
01:31:32,575 --> 01:31:34,619
Ted.

1796
01:31:34,661 --> 01:31:36,705
Can you do me a favour?

1797
01:31:36,746 --> 01:31:37,539
Would you mind
letting the dog out ofthe bathroom?

1798
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:40,875
'Cause I think I should
have a talk with Magda here.

1799
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:42,919
Sure, yeah.

1800
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:57,350
Uh, Mary?

1801
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,644
Huh?

1802
01:31:59,686 --> 01:32:01,521
What kind of dog is Puffy?

1803
01:32:01,771 --> 01:32:05,692
- Border terrier.
- Border terrier. Like, uh, Benji.

1804
01:32:05,942 --> 01:32:07,986
Oh.

1805
01:32:15,326 --> 01:32:17,328
Hey.

1806
01:32:17,412 --> 01:32:19,456
Hey.

1807
01:32:19,497 --> 01:32:21,332
Are you the little guy
making all that big noise?

1808
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:23,626
Huh? Hmm?

1809
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:30,925
Oh, Ted!

1810
01:32:40,352 --> 01:32:42,395
Puffy, stop it!

1811
01:32:44,522 --> 01:32:47,609
Take a little bit ofthis!

1812
01:32:48,693 --> 01:32:51,738
Puffy! Puffy!

1813
01:32:57,035 --> 01:32:59,079
Puffy!

1814
01:33:08,505 --> 01:33:10,548
Oh, Ted!

1815
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:16,805
Puffy.

1816
01:33:21,017 --> 01:33:23,019
- Puffy!
- Puffy!

1817
01:33:23,103 --> 01:33:24,938
Puffy, Puffy! Puffy!

1818
01:33:25,188 --> 01:33:27,190
Puffy! Puffy!

1819
01:33:27,273 --> 01:33:29,317
Puffy! Puffy!

1820
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:39,536
You want a grape?

1821
01:33:39,786 --> 01:33:41,788
A grape? Sure.

1822
01:33:42,914 --> 01:33:43,707
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1823
01:33:43,957 --> 01:33:47,002
All net. All net.

1824
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:49,129
We make a good team.

1825
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:20,201
Closer?

1826
01:34:20,452 --> 01:34:22,287
It's all right. Get in closer.

1827
01:34:22,537 --> 01:34:23,329
That's good. That's good.

1828
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,372
Don't be afraid. Get right in there.

1829
01:34:24,622 --> 01:34:26,458
A little bit more. A little bit more.

1830
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:30,837
He'll be fine. Mary, you're overprotective.

1831
01:35:03,203 --> 01:35:06,289
No, no, no. We already got it.

1832
01:35:14,673 --> 01:35:15,465
Come on, come on.

1833
01:35:15,715 --> 01:35:16,508
Pow! Pow! Pow!

1834
01:35:16,758 --> 01:35:18,760
Pow!

1835
01:35:19,886 --> 01:35:22,931
Warren. Warren!

1836
01:35:23,014 --> 01:35:23,807
Warren!

1837
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:26,059
Warren!

1838
01:35:27,185 --> 01:35:29,229
Warren!

1839
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:35,485
Warren! Come here! Stop!

1840
01:35:37,612 --> 01:35:39,656
I'm OK! I'm OK!

1841
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,784
Hey! Hey!

1842
01:35:42,826 --> 01:35:45,704
It's his fault.
He hit me with that stuff.

1843
01:35:45,954 --> 01:35:47,789
Whoo! Warren! Warren!

1844
01:35:48,039 --> 01:35:50,041
Stop!

1845
01:36:13,064 --> 01:36:13,857
Oh, God.

1846
01:36:14,107 --> 01:36:15,942
I didn't do it.

1847
01:36:16,192 --> 01:36:16,985
He got in the way.

1848
01:36:17,235 --> 01:36:19,070
I know, I know, I know.

1849
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:22,198
Anybody have any pliers?
Needle-nose otherwise?

1850
01:36:22,449 --> 01:36:25,535
Anything?

1851
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:34,919
Hey.

1852
01:36:34,961 --> 01:36:37,839
Flowers are for you.
Ball is for Warren.

1853
01:36:38,089 --> 01:36:40,967
Had a friend Fed-Ex it from Boston.

1854
01:36:41,217 --> 01:36:43,053
Signed by Tony... Conigliaro.

1855
01:36:43,303 --> 01:36:47,390
Did you hire Pat Healy to spy on me?

1856
01:36:49,559 --> 01:36:51,561
What?

1857
01:36:51,644 --> 01:36:54,522
What are you talking about?

1858
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:57,859
I got an anonymous letter.

1859
01:36:58,943 --> 01:37:01,988
It's not true, right, Ted?

1860
01:37:04,157 --> 01:37:05,992
Well, it's... it's...

1861
01:37:06,242 --> 01:37:08,078
It's an interesting thing that happened.

1862
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:10,330
I, um...

1863
01:37:11,456 --> 01:37:13,291
Yeah, it's true, but it's... it's not...

1864
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:16,628
OK. Get out.

1865
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:17,462
Mary, wait. First of all,

1866
01:37:17,712 --> 01:37:19,547
I didn't know that this guy was

1867
01:37:19,798 --> 01:37:21,633
What? That he was a murderer?

1868
01:37:21,883 --> 01:37:24,761
Uh, that, yeah,
and in addition to many other things.

1869
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:25,804
I didn't know anything about the guy.

1870
01:37:26,054 --> 01:37:26,846
I hardly know him.

1871
01:37:27,097 --> 01:37:28,932
How could you do that, Ted?

1872
01:37:29,182 --> 01:37:32,268
How could you have some guy
you don't even know spy on me?

1873
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:37,440
What were you trying to do?

1874
01:37:37,524 --> 01:37:42,696
Trick me into feeling something for you?

1875
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,824
No. I didn't...

1876
01:37:45,865 --> 01:37:48,910
I didn't want to trick you.

1877
01:37:50,036 --> 01:37:52,038
Just leave.

1878
01:37:52,122 --> 01:37:54,165
OK?

1879
01:37:54,207 --> 01:37:56,209
Mary...

1880
01:37:56,292 --> 01:37:58,336
Go.

1881
01:38:07,762 --> 01:38:11,683
I did it because I never
stopped thinking about you.

1882
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:14,811
And if I didn't find you,
I knew that my life

1883
01:38:15,061 --> 01:38:18,148
would never, ever be good again.

1884
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:02,984
Hey.

1885
01:39:03,026 --> 01:39:06,071
Healy! You in there?

1886
01:39:10,325 --> 01:39:12,369
Hello?

1887
01:39:20,752 --> 01:39:22,796
Eww.

1888
01:39:27,008 --> 01:39:32,138
And it was going along just fine
until you showed up.

1889
01:39:34,307 --> 01:39:36,309
Holy shit!

1890
01:39:37,435 --> 01:39:40,480
This is a pretty nice place.

1891
01:39:40,563 --> 01:39:43,441
Sully, what the fuck happened?

1892
01:39:43,692 --> 01:39:44,484
Hey, surprise!

1893
01:39:44,734 --> 01:39:47,612
Whoa, whoa! Hey, peace, man.

1894
01:39:47,862 --> 01:39:48,655
You fucked me, man!

1895
01:39:48,905 --> 01:39:49,698
Wait! Hey, come on!

1896
01:39:49,948 --> 01:39:50,740
Look... Iook, man...

1897
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:51,783
Look, don't do anything
rash now, buddy, hmm?

1898
01:39:52,033 --> 01:39:55,078
Who the fuck is this guy?!

1899
01:39:55,161 --> 01:39:56,996
Uh, that's Norm. He's a pizza boy.

1900
01:39:57,247 --> 01:39:59,082
He's in love with Mary, too.

1901
01:39:59,332 --> 01:40:01,167
Look, come on, man.

1902
01:40:01,418 --> 01:40:05,338
All right... Iook, I think everybody
could use a drink right now, hmm?

1903
01:40:05,588 --> 01:40:06,381
I don't want a drink!

1904
01:40:06,631 --> 01:40:07,424
Fuck you!

1905
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:10,719
Whoa, hey, hey, look...

1906
01:40:10,802 --> 01:40:13,680
You asked me to follow
around your girl and I did.

1907
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:19,060
And then the truth is,
l... I started to like her.

1908
01:40:19,144 --> 01:40:24,315
And that's when I realised I couldn't
in good conscience bring myselfto do it.

1909
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:26,192
Do what?

1910
01:40:26,443 --> 01:40:29,320
Turn her over to a violent... stalker.

1911
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:31,614
Oh, I'm a stalker.

1912
01:40:31,656 --> 01:40:33,491
You're calling me a violent stalker?

1913
01:40:33,742 --> 01:40:34,534
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1914
01:40:34,784 --> 01:40:36,828
You're a sick fuck.

1915
01:40:37,912 --> 01:40:38,705
Hey, fuck you.

1916
01:40:38,955 --> 01:40:39,748
Fuck you!

1917
01:40:39,998 --> 01:40:41,833
You just can't take the fact
that it was my turn!

1918
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:42,876
Your turn?

1919
01:40:43,126 --> 01:40:44,961
Yeah, that's right. My turn.

1920
01:40:45,211 --> 01:40:49,299
Why can't I ever get a girl like Mary?

1921
01:40:49,382 --> 01:40:51,217
Yeah, well, just 'cause
you didn't get her,

1922
01:40:51,468 --> 01:40:53,303
you didn't have to blow us both
out ofthe water.

1923
01:40:53,553 --> 01:40:55,388
What are you talkin' about?

1924
01:40:55,638 --> 01:40:58,725
You're gonna tell me
you didn't write her an anonymous letter

1925
01:40:58,767 --> 01:41:00,602
telling her about our whole deal together?

1926
01:41:00,852 --> 01:41:02,896
What letter?

1927
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:06,024
Come on.

1928
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:09,110
It was you.

1929
01:41:12,322 --> 01:41:14,366
You sent the letter.

1930
01:41:14,407 --> 01:41:16,409
It was you!

1931
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,328
We had a deal.
You said you wouldn't fuck me

1932
01:41:18,578 --> 01:41:21,456
and I wouldn't fuck you until

1933
01:41:21,706 --> 01:41:23,541
we got this fuck outta
the fuckin' picture.

1934
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:25,627
You crossed the line, man!

1935
01:41:25,877 --> 01:41:26,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man!

1936
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,755
You're gettin' crazy, now.

1937
01:41:29,005 --> 01:41:30,840
Why would I cross the line?

1938
01:41:31,091 --> 01:41:34,177
Y-you probably did it yourself,
you piece of shit.

1939
01:41:34,219 --> 01:41:36,054
Oh, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1940
01:41:36,304 --> 01:41:37,097
Why would I rat myself out?

1941
01:41:37,347 --> 01:41:40,225
Like I'm gonna try
to figure out some guy

1942
01:41:40,475 --> 01:41:43,353
whose idea of courtin'
is blowin' farts in her face.

1943
01:41:43,603 --> 01:41:46,648
- You were followin' us.
- Don't flatter yourself.

1944
01:41:46,731 --> 01:41:49,818
I-l-l was following her!

1945
01:41:50,902 --> 01:41:52,946
I always do.

1946
01:41:52,987 --> 01:41:57,117
How the hell do you think
I got rid ofthe last guy... Brett?

1947
01:41:57,158 --> 01:41:57,951
Br... wait. Brett?

1948
01:41:58,201 --> 01:42:03,164
Are you sayin' that Brett
didn't say those things about Warren?

1949
01:42:03,415 --> 01:42:05,458
Are you shittin' me?

1950
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,335
Mr Goody Two-Shoes?

1951
01:42:07,585 --> 01:42:10,463
He was like an eagle scout!

1952
01:42:10,714 --> 01:42:12,549
Wait a minute!

1953
01:42:12,799 --> 01:42:14,634
You two should be kissin'
my fuckin' hairy beanbag,

1954
01:42:14,884 --> 01:42:19,014
'cause if it wasn't for me,
she might have married that schmuck!

1955
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:23,184
I feel sick.

1956
01:42:23,226 --> 01:42:26,271
Both ofyou are just...

1957
01:42:26,354 --> 01:42:28,398
I'm outta here.

1958
01:42:48,251 --> 01:42:50,295
Woogie?

1959
01:42:50,337 --> 01:42:52,339
Who the hell is Woogie?

1960
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:57,594
Hello.

1961
01:42:58,678 --> 01:43:00,513
What are... what are you doing here?

1962
01:43:00,764 --> 01:43:03,808
Did you get my letter, Mar?

1963
01:43:03,892 --> 01:43:05,935
The one about Ted?

1964
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:07,812
Y-you sent that?

1965
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:10,106
Mm-hmm.

1966
01:43:11,191 --> 01:43:14,277
I was worried about you.

1967
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:18,239
Woogie, you know you're not supposed
to be within 400 yards of me.

1968
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:20,325
Oh, I know. I do, in fact.

1969
01:43:20,575 --> 01:43:23,453
That's... that's what I really
wanted to talk to you about.

1970
01:43:23,703 --> 01:43:27,624
You know that I have
actually been through

1971
01:43:27,874 --> 01:43:32,837
nine years of intensive psychotherapy
and you know something?

1972
01:43:33,088 --> 01:43:33,880
You were absolutely right.

1973
01:43:34,130 --> 01:43:34,923
I needed help.

1974
01:43:35,173 --> 01:43:40,136
That's great, Woogie.
I mean, I'm glad you're doing better.

1975
01:43:40,387 --> 01:43:42,389
You... you look...

1976
01:43:42,472 --> 01:43:44,516
You look good.

1977
01:43:44,557 --> 01:43:45,350
Thank you.

1978
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,478
Except for the rash thing's
still there, right?

1979
01:43:48,728 --> 01:43:50,563
Yes. You noticed, huh?

1980
01:43:50,814 --> 01:43:53,858
These are called love blisters.

1981
01:43:53,942 --> 01:43:55,777
They went away for a little while,

1982
01:43:56,027 --> 01:44:00,156
but then you came back
in my life, milady, huh?

1983
01:44:00,198 --> 01:44:05,328
Woogie... I did not come
back into your life, OK?

1984
01:44:05,412 --> 01:44:07,247
I don't even know
how you found me.

1985
01:44:07,497 --> 01:44:11,418
Let's not forget here,
you put me through a lot of bullshit, OK?

1986
01:44:11,668 --> 01:44:14,546
I had to change my name.
I had to go to court.

1987
01:44:14,796 --> 01:44:15,588
I moved!

1988
01:44:15,839 --> 01:44:17,674
I mean, you stole all of my shoes!

1989
01:44:17,924 --> 01:44:18,717
What?!

1990
01:44:18,967 --> 01:44:21,845
What are you talking about?!

1991
01:44:22,095 --> 01:44:23,930
Woogie, I caught you red-handed!

1992
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:28,309
I was in a weird place, then, Mary.

1993
01:44:28,351 --> 01:44:30,186
Come on.

1994
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:34,357
OK? Come on. Gimme...
gimme a break here, OK?

1995
01:44:34,607 --> 01:44:36,443
I was a little... a little nuts, a little...

1996
01:44:36,693 --> 01:44:38,528
But I'm fine.

1997
01:44:38,778 --> 01:44:40,780
Woogie,

1998
01:44:40,864 --> 01:44:43,742
you're starting to make
me a little nervous.

1999
01:44:43,992 --> 01:44:45,827
Ooh! I'm making you feel nervous.

2000
01:44:46,077 --> 01:44:47,912
Nervous... what's that?

2001
01:44:48,163 --> 01:44:51,041
I don't know anything
about nervous. Ehhh! Jeez.

2002
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:54,169
You ever had a whitehead
on your eyeball, Mary? Hmm?

2003
01:44:54,419 --> 01:44:57,297
Woogie, I'm asking you to leave.

2004
01:44:57,547 --> 01:44:58,340
No, Mary...

2005
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:00,425
No, Mary, you got this all wrong.

2006
01:45:00,675 --> 01:45:04,804
I'm not going anywhere. Mm-mmm.

2007
01:45:04,846 --> 01:45:08,975
Not until I get something
to remember you by.

2008
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:19,361
Stop it! Stop!

2009
01:45:19,444 --> 01:45:22,322
Just one pair! You owe me that,
you heartless bitch!

2010
01:45:22,572 --> 01:45:26,659
Huh? Whoa! What the... hey!

2011
01:45:31,956 --> 01:45:32,749
Dom?

2012
01:45:32,999 --> 01:45:36,086
You're pathetic.

2013
01:45:36,127 --> 01:45:40,256
Tucker... what happened to your crutches?

2014
01:45:40,298 --> 01:45:42,133
Uh, well, uh, yeah...

2015
01:45:42,384 --> 01:45:44,219
That's a very good query, Mary.
Well done.

2016
01:45:44,469 --> 01:45:48,598
Come on! Tell her the truth, pizza boy.

2017
01:45:50,725 --> 01:45:53,603
Name's Norm.

2018
01:45:53,853 --> 01:45:57,941
I live with my folks up in Pompano. Hey.

2019
01:45:59,067 --> 01:46:03,196
Oh, man! This is like
group therapy or somethin'!

2020
01:46:03,238 --> 01:46:04,030
Dom! What are you doin' here?

2021
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:08,201
You stole her from me
and now I want her back.

2022
01:46:08,451 --> 01:46:11,329
I stole her from you? What are you...
what are you talkin' about?

2023
01:46:11,579 --> 01:46:13,581
Mm-hmm.

2024
01:46:13,665 --> 01:46:15,500
Woogie! How many times
did I tell you this at Princeton?

2025
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:16,543
Woogie?

2026
01:46:16,793 --> 01:46:19,879
Ted and I had one date.

2027
01:46:19,921 --> 01:46:20,714
You and I were already broken up!

2028
01:46:20,964 --> 01:46:21,756
You're Woogie?

2029
01:46:22,007 --> 01:46:25,051
Dom Wooganowski.

2030
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:28,013
But... you're married.

2031
01:46:28,263 --> 01:46:30,098
You have a wife, beautiful kids.

2032
01:46:30,348 --> 01:46:34,269
Ted, ifyou love 'em so much,
please, be my guest.

2033
01:46:34,519 --> 01:46:36,354
All right, what the hell
is going on in here?

2034
01:46:36,604 --> 01:46:39,482
Can someone explain it to me?

2035
01:46:39,733 --> 01:46:43,820
Um, look, we're...
we're all in love with Mary.

2036
01:46:43,903 --> 01:46:45,947
Oh, God.

2037
01:46:45,989 --> 01:46:50,118
If I may, I have a proposal.

2038
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,038
I say none of us leaves this room

2039
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:57,208
till our young Mary here
stops jerkin' us around

2040
01:46:57,459 --> 01:46:59,294
and decides, once and for all,

2041
01:46:59,544 --> 01:47:02,589
who she really wants.

2042
01:47:03,715 --> 01:47:06,760
Now, Mary, I know this is tough

2043
01:47:06,843 --> 01:47:09,721
but you really will
be doing them all a great favour

2044
01:47:09,971 --> 01:47:11,806
to tell them the truth about us.

2045
01:47:12,057 --> 01:47:12,849
Are you crazy?

2046
01:47:13,099 --> 01:47:14,934
What makes you think
I would pick you, anyhow?

2047
01:47:15,185 --> 01:47:18,229
You're a murderer!

2048
01:47:18,313 --> 01:47:20,357
Uh...

2049
01:47:20,398 --> 01:47:26,571
Well, l, uh, I may have been blowin'
a little smoke up your ass there, Mary. Sorry.

2050
01:47:26,654 --> 01:47:28,698
Whoa! Whoa-ho!

2051
01:47:29,783 --> 01:47:30,575
Whoa-ho-ho!

2052
01:47:30,825 --> 01:47:32,869
Touchdown!

2053
01:47:32,911 --> 01:47:33,703
Hi, Mary.

2054
01:47:33,953 --> 01:47:34,746
Brett?

2055
01:47:34,996 --> 01:47:37,874
What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

2056
01:47:38,124 --> 01:47:39,959
I'm in town to play
the Dolphins, you dumbass.

2057
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:42,045
Yeah, I called him, Mary.

2058
01:47:42,295 --> 01:47:44,130
I told him to pick up Warren
and get down here.

2059
01:47:44,381 --> 01:47:47,467
See, your friend Tucker was lying
about a couple of other things.

2060
01:47:48,551 --> 01:47:50,387
Brett never said those
bad things about Warren.

2061
01:47:50,637 --> 01:47:52,472
He loves Warren.

2062
01:47:52,722 --> 01:47:54,557
And from what he told me
on the phone just now,

2063
01:47:54,808 --> 01:47:57,894
he loves you, too.

2064
01:47:57,936 --> 01:47:58,728
He's the guy you should be with.

2065
01:47:58,978 --> 01:48:00,980
God.

2066
01:48:03,149 --> 01:48:04,984
That's right, Mary.

2067
01:48:05,235 --> 01:48:07,070
You know I'll always be true to you.

2068
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:11,449
Oh, shit! This isn't fair. Jesus!

2069
01:48:11,491 --> 01:48:13,326
You know, I feel like an idiot.

2070
01:48:13,576 --> 01:48:16,454
See, I realised somethin' today.

2071
01:48:16,705 --> 01:48:18,540
I'm no better than any ofthese guys.

2072
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:22,711
I mean, none ofthem love you, really.

2073
01:48:22,961 --> 01:48:24,796
They're just... they're just

2074
01:48:25,046 --> 01:48:26,881
fixated on you, because of how

2075
01:48:27,132 --> 01:48:27,924
you make them feel about themselves.

2076
01:48:28,174 --> 01:48:30,010
I mean, that's not real love.

2077
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:32,095
That's...

2078
01:48:32,345 --> 01:48:35,390
I don't know what that is.

2079
01:48:35,473 --> 01:48:38,518
Please! Mary, don't listen to him!

2080
01:48:38,601 --> 01:48:41,479
This is just another one
of his stupid little ploys.

2081
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:43,565
You know, Stroehmann,
you are so full of shit!

2082
01:48:43,815 --> 01:48:46,860
Yeah, you're the biggest
stalker of us all, man!

2083
01:48:46,943 --> 01:48:47,736
You're gonna stand here and tell me

2084
01:48:47,986 --> 01:48:51,031
that you're not nuts
about this girl?

2085
01:48:51,114 --> 01:48:52,949
Yeah, that's what I'm tellin' you.

2086
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:55,201
Oh!

2087
01:48:56,327 --> 01:48:58,163
Hey, good luck, Brett.

2088
01:48:58,413 --> 01:48:59,205
Yeah. Thank you.

2089
01:48:59,456 --> 01:49:03,585
She's a great gal. Take care of her.

2090
01:49:03,626 --> 01:49:05,628
I'll, uh, see you, Mary.

2091
01:49:06,755 --> 01:49:08,798
Bye, Ted.

2092
01:49:10,925 --> 01:49:12,761
Hey, Warren, see ya later.

2093
01:49:13,011 --> 01:49:16,097
OK. Goodbye, Ted.

2094
01:49:17,182 --> 01:49:19,225
Goodbye.

2095
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,145
God, Mary, I've missed you.

2096
01:49:22,395 --> 01:49:23,188
Hey, uh, Brett.

2097
01:49:23,438 --> 01:49:24,230
What are the chances I could get you

2098
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:27,567
to give me a little autograph
on this pump here, huh?

2099
01:49:27,609 --> 01:49:28,401
Somethin' nice
for the wife and kids.

2100
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:29,444
What?!

2101
01:49:29,694 --> 01:49:32,739
Ah, shut up. Cock tease.

2102
01:49:57,847 --> 01:50:03,019
Well, she's back
with her old boyfriend

2103
01:50:03,061 --> 01:50:04,896
He don't challenge her

2104
01:50:05,146 --> 01:50:06,981
He don't contend with her

2105
01:50:07,232 --> 01:50:11,319
And she don't answer
the cards you send

2106
01:50:11,403 --> 01:50:13,238
And you're jealous ofthe time

2107
01:50:13,488 --> 01:50:15,323
That he spend with her

2108
01:50:15,573 --> 01:50:19,661
Just let her go into the darkness

2109
01:50:20,787 --> 01:50:24,916
Let her live for all the things there

2110
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:29,087
Let her go into the darkness

2111
01:50:29,129 --> 01:50:33,258
Let her go, let her go, let her go

2112
01:50:57,282 --> 01:50:59,325
Ted!

2113
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:02,454
Mary?

2114
01:51:04,581 --> 01:51:06,624
Ted!

2115
01:51:06,666 --> 01:51:08,668
Mary!

2116
01:51:10,837 --> 01:51:12,839
Ted!

2117
01:51:16,051 --> 01:51:19,137
You forgot your keys.

2118
01:51:31,691 --> 01:51:34,778
Did you really mean
what you said up there?

2119
01:51:34,819 --> 01:51:36,821
Uh-huh.

2120
01:51:37,947 --> 01:51:41,034
I just want you to be happy, Mary.

2121
01:51:44,204 --> 01:51:47,248
But I'd be happiest with you.

2122
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:53,546
You're fuckin' with me, right?

2123
01:51:54,631 --> 01:51:56,675
What...

2124
01:51:56,716 --> 01:51:58,718
What about...

2125
01:51:58,802 --> 01:52:00,845
Brett Fav... re?

2126
01:52:02,972 --> 01:52:05,850
What did I tell you
the first time we met?

2127
01:52:06,101 --> 01:52:09,187
I'm a niners fan.

2128
01:52:20,699 --> 01:52:23,576
His friends would say stop whinin'

2129
01:52:23,827 --> 01:52:26,871
They've had enough ofthat

2130
01:52:26,955 --> 01:52:28,790
His friends would say stop pinin'

2131
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,918
There's other girls to look at

2132
01:52:32,168 --> 01:52:35,255
They've tried to set him up

2133
01:52:35,296 --> 01:52:37,132

2134
01:52:37,382 --> 01:52:40,260
But there's somethin' about Mary

2135
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:42,345
That they don't know...

2136
01:52:42,595 --> 01:52:44,431
What are you doing?

2137
01:52:44,681 --> 01:52:46,516
That's my girl he's kissin'.

2138
01:52:46,766 --> 01:52:47,559
But you just slept with me!

2139
01:52:47,809 --> 01:52:51,938
I was only bonin' you to get to Mary.

2140
01:53:02,407 --> 01:53:03,199
And a one... 2, 3, 4

2141
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:05,452
