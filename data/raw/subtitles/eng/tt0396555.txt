2
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:35,132
Then I didn't choose that one
because it was gonna give me pimples,

3
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:37,885
so I choosed another scary one

4
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:43,057
because, for all those years
that I went for Halloween,

5
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:44,892
I wasn't scary at all.

6
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:58,072
I love baseball.
It's my destiny to play that game.

7
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:00,157
I don't really care about winning.

8
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:04,745
Well, like, now I do
'cause, like, we've lost every game.

9
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,747
I've gotten tired of it.

10
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:10,418
I'm working, like, so hard.
All the balls are getting thrown to me.

11
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:12,920
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.

12
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:17,133
All of the people in the outfield
are all looking around and...

13
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:19,927
Come on!
Let's play some baseball, okay?

14
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,345
Not the lazy game.

15
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:31,063
They're here.

16
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:38,028
Lewis?

17
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,282
Lewis?

18
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,877
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!

19
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:54,628
They are gonna love this!

20
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:57,631
Nothing says "adopt me"
like a weird invention.

21
00:02:57,715 --> 00:02:58,883
Lewis!

22
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:01,135
- Lewis, the Harringtons are here!
- Way ahead of you, Mildred.

23
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:03,054
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

24
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:06,223
Remember, sit up straight.
Look them in the eye.

25
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,559
Smile. Let's fix your...

26
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:10,561
Mildred.

27
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:13,064
All right, all right, all right, all right.

28
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:15,066
Go show them how special you are.

29
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,068
Oh, I hope this is it.

30
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,903
I hope he gets adopted.

31
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,654
You and me both, chief.

32
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:25,159
I mean, there's so many things
in the world that can be improved.

33
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:28,579
Just think of it.
Moving sidewalks, flying cars.

34
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,247
The possibilities are endless.

35
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:32,500
Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.

36
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,419
All it takes is some imagination
and a little science,

37
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,922
and we can make the world
a better place.

38
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:41,342
Well, these are all interesting ideas.

39
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,511
So, what's your favourite sport?

40
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:46,097
- Well, does inventing count as a sport?
- Actually...

41
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:48,349
'Cause I think I hit a home run
with this one!

42
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:50,851
- What is that?
- First, a question.

43
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:53,270
What's the number one problem
that you face

44
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,106
when you make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

45
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:57,525
- Lewis, I don't think we...
- Portion control.

46
00:03:57,691 --> 00:03:59,610
Too much peanut butter sticks
to the roof of your mouth,

47
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:00,778
takes forever to chew.

48
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:04,699
Too much jelly squishes out the sides
and makes your hands all sticky.

49
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:07,451
Well, I propose
that the perfect P.B. and J.

50
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:08,869
is within mankind's grasp,

51
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:11,288
and I've built this machine to achieve it.

52
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,624
For this demonstration,
I'll use regular bread.

53
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,875
Honey, it's okay.

54
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,794
As you can see, toasting is an option.

55
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,130
We don't usually eat peanut butter.

56
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:22,133
Lewis, this is really not necessary.

57
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:23,968
It's jammed!

58
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:27,596
Lewis, please, don't!

59
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:37,732
What's happening?

60
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:40,651
Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!

61
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:42,486
I'm sorry!

62
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,155
Here let me help you get that off!

63
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,073
Stand back!

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,829
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Breathe. Breathe.

65
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:53,914
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!

66
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:55,666
It was really nice to meet you.

67
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,586
We're gonna need some time
to think about it.

68
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:00,921
Hi, folks. Everything all...

69
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:02,089
What happened?

70
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:04,675
Miss Duffy,
that boy is definitely not right for us.

71
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:06,260
Now, if you'll excuse me.

72
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:10,347
I'm so sorry about this.
If you would just...

73
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:21,692
- I made some lunch.
- Not hungry.

74
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:25,196
Poor Mr Harrington.

75
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,824
- I killed him?
- No. No! No, you didn't kill him.

76
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,910
I called. He's perfectly fine.

77
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:34,372
I was just gonna say that it's...

78
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:36,207
It's too bad
he didn't get to try a sandwich

79
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,876
from that wonderful invention of yours.

80
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,045
- Yeah, real wonderful.
- It's not you.

81
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:43,714
We just haven't found
the right couple yet.

82
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:45,716
One hundred twenty-four.

83
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,301
What?

84
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:50,971
That's how many adoption interviews
I've had, 124.

85
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:52,139
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.

86
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:54,558
You're exaggerating just to make your

87
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:57,311
point.

88
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:59,397
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year,

89
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:03,067
and you know how hard it is
for a teenager to get adopted.

90
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,737
I have no future. No one wants me.

91
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:07,905
That's not true, Lewis!

92
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:09,657
My own mother didn't even want me.

93
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:12,159
Now, stop it. You do not know that.

94
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:13,661
Then why'd she give me up?

95
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:15,496
She may not have been able
to take care of you.

96
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,081
Did you ever think of that?

97
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:22,002
I am sure that she was only thinking
about what was best for you.

98
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:24,171
I never thought of it that way.

99
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,591
Maybe she wanted to keep you,
but she had no choice.

100
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:30,428
You're right.

101
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:34,265
My real mom is the only person
who's ever wanted me.

102
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:36,100
Wait. I said "maybe. "

103
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:39,019
And if she wanted me then,
she'll want me now.

104
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,604
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:44,108
I have to find her, Mildred,
and when I do, she'll take me back,

106
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:45,609
and we'll be a family again!

107
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:49,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lewis, you can't do that.

108
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:52,450
No one knows anything about her.
No one even saw her.

109
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:56,287
Wrong. I saw her

110
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:57,538
once.

111
00:06:57,872 --> 00:07:01,292
She's in here. I just have to remember.

112
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:06,380
That's it!

113
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,218
<i>Hello</i>

114
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:14,138
<i>I got something to tell you</i>

115
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:17,725
<i>But it's crazy</i>

116
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:21,312
<i>I got something to show you</i>

117
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,899
<i>So give me just one more chance</i>

118
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:29,153
<i>One more glance
And I will make of you</i>

119
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,740
<i>Another believer</i>

120
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:37,995
<i>Guess what?
You got more than you bargained</i>

121
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,165
<i>Ain't it crazy?</i>

122
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:44,919
<i>You got more than you paid for</i>

123
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:48,339
<i>So give me just one more chance</i>

124
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:51,008
<i>One more glance</i>

125
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:56,097
<i>One more hand to hold</i>

126
00:07:56,347 --> 00:08:03,104
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

127
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,774
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

128
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:13,447
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

129
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:18,119
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

130
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:20,621
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

131
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:23,457
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

132
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:27,461
<i>What are we gonna do about it?</i>

133
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:34,301
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

134
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:37,805
<i>One more chance</i>

135
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:43,144
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

136
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:47,648
<i>One more chance</i>

137
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:50,901
So tired.

138
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:56,323
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon.
He'll be so excited you're coming.

139
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:57,742
Bye-bye, now.

140
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:01,454
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.

141
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,581
- Good luck at the big game today.
- Easy win.

142
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:05,750
Those guys are a bunch of bums.

143
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,002
I just hope I can stay awake.

144
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,962
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

145
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:13,841
He was up all night
working on his stupid project,

146
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:15,676
but that's what happens

147
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:19,096
when you get a science geek
for a roommate.

148
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:27,396
Ah, that's good joe.

149
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:31,776
All right, Einstein,
you owe Michael big time.

150
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:34,862
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain
took a lot longer than I expected,

151
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:38,115
but it's finished, Mildred.
I recalibrated the headset.

152
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,868
Now the neural circuits will connect.

153
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:42,870
I've cracked the hippocampus!

154
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:44,872
Really? Okay. What?

155
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,791
Now to test it out.

156
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,629
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!

157
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:52,838
Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.

158
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:54,632
I almost forgot what I came up here for.

159
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,133
I know you have a lot
on your plate today,

160
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,552
but I've scheduled an interview for you
this afternoon.

161
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,554
- No, thanks.
- "No, thanks"?

162
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,556
Sweetheart, this is
about being adopted,

163
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:05,684
and you will be back here
clean, happy and on time.

164
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,647
I'm done with interviews, Mildred.
I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.

165
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,066
Listen, I know where your head is,
but I'm telling you,

166
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:15,903
you have got to get out of the past
and look to the future.

167
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:17,905
I am, and this is it.

168
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:19,240
This is my future.

169
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:21,826
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:24,328
Lewis? Honey?

171
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:31,419
Dr Krunklehorn,
I know you're very busy there

172
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:32,670
at Inventco Labs,

173
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:34,755
and we're just so excited
to have you as a judge.

174
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,799
It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein.
Hey, you never know.

175
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:38,926
One of your students may invent
the next integrated circuit

176
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:41,095
or microprocessor or integrated circuit.

177
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:42,680
Oh, wait! I said that already.

178
00:10:42,763 --> 00:10:44,598
Well, I just don't get out
of that lab very much.

179
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,684
Is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.

180
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:48,769
I haven't slept in eight days!

181
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:51,605
Well, then can I get you a cot
or something?

182
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:54,775
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch.
It's my invention.

183
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,486
Each patch is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee.

184
00:10:57,653 --> 00:11:00,031
You can stay awake for days
with no side effects.

185
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,283
Sorry. Who's this?

186
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:05,036
This is one of our students,
Stanley Pukowski.

187
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:06,746
Oh, so cute!

188
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:09,290
I just want to bite
his chubby little cheeks!

189
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:13,711
What's with the dress, Pukowski?

190
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:16,380
It's actually a toga, sir.

191
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:19,967
Coach, nice to see you, sort of.
What are you doing here?

192
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,553
Judging a science fair.
What's it look like I'm doing?

193
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:25,639
And what makes you qualified
to judge a science fair?

194
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,058
It's my gym.

195
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:29,643
Stanley. Volcano.

196
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:35,232
Behold the awesome power
of Mount Vesuvius!

197
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:41,405
The toggle switch isn't toggling.

198
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:42,656
Dr Krunklehorn?

199
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,742
Barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!

200
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:48,829
I don't know what she just said,
but this project is unacceptable!

201
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:50,664
Now, give me 20 laps around the gym!

202
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:52,333
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

203
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,168
- Coach!
- I'm watching you.

204
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:06,680
Okay, next up is Lizzy
and her fire ant farm.

205
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:07,932
That's right.

206
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,517
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.

207
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:11,519
You know that they have a tendency
to bite people.

208
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:13,854
Only my enemies.

209
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:17,274
Just keep moving, shall we?
Top notch, Lizzy!

210
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:20,111
Let's not anger her
or make her jumpy in any way.

211
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:35,793
This area's not secure. Get in.

212
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:39,547
Have you been approached
by a tall man in a bowler hat?

213
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,882
- What?
- Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.

214
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:44,468
- Okay, goodbye.
- All right,

215
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:46,637
didn't want to pull rank on you,
but you forced my hand.

216
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:48,973
Special Agent Wilbur Robinson
of the T.C.T.F.

217
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:51,142
- The what?
- Time Continuum Task Force.

218
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:52,393
- I'm here to protect you.
- Well...

219
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,895
Now, tall man, bowler hat,
approached you?

220
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,147
No, why?

221
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,649
I could lose my badge for this.

222
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:00,484
He's a suspect in a robbery.

223
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:01,652
What did he steal?

224
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,070
- A time machine.
- A what?

225
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:06,323
I've tracked him to this time,
and my informants say he's after you.

226
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,159
Me? Why me?

227
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:10,244
The boys back at HQ
haven't figured out a motive yet.

228
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,329
And by "HQ," I mean "headquarters. "

229
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:13,748
I know what HQ means.

230
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,416
Good. You're a smart kid.

231
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,585
That might keep you alive, for now.

232
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:19,253
Just worry
about your little science gizmo

233
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,505
and leave the "perp" to me.

234
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:24,425
- And by "perp," I mean...
- I know what it means!

235
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,510
Okay, Mr Smarty-pants.

236
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,266
Bowler Hat Guy!

237
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:37,188
My frogs!

238
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:38,606
You're not gonna get away with it,

239
00:13:39,523 --> 00:13:42,359
kid with science project.

240
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:45,112
Dude, you almost busted
my solar system!

241
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,949
My frogs! They're getting away!

242
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:22,483
Got you! That's the last of them.

243
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:24,902
Annoying little girl,
I don't have time for this.

244
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:26,153
I'm on a very important...

245
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:29,490
Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.

246
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:32,660
Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain!
Love the pain!

247
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:33,911
Coach...

248
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:35,162
Next up is Lewis.

249
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,415
Yes... Lewis! Excuse me.

250
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:39,917
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...

251
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:44,672
It's okay. It's gonna work this time.
I won't let you down, I promise.

252
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,675
All right, Lewis, I trust you.
Knock 'em dead.

253
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:51,178
That was a figure of speech.
Please don't kill anyone.

254
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:57,518
Okay, stand back, everybody.

255
00:14:57,601 --> 00:15:00,271
This next project
will knock your socks off.

256
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:03,107
Seriously, you might wanna stand back
a little.

257
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:06,360
Have you ever forgotten something,

258
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:10,031
and no matter how hard you tried,
you couldn't remember it?

259
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:14,035
Well, what happens
to these forgotten memories?

260
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:17,621
I propose
they're stored somewhere in your brain,

261
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:20,374
and I built a machine
that can retrieve them.

262
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,377
I call it the Memory Scanner.

263
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:25,629
It's shiny!

264
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:28,466
So, Lewis,
how does the Memory Scanner work?

265
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,969
First, you input the desired period
of time on this keypad.

266
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:36,390
Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex,
where memories are stored.

267
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:38,976
The retrieved memory
is then displayed on this monitor.

268
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:41,062
Wrap him up. I'll take two.

269
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:44,732
Now, I'm going back 12 years,
three months and 11 days.

270
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,734
Why that particular day?

271
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,819
You didn't think
I was paying attention, did you?

272
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:52,656
Well, that was the day...

273
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:56,744
Let's just say, that was
a very important day in my life.

274
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:58,412
Fair enough. Play ball.

275
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:02,083
It'll just take a second
to get the turbines going.

276
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:22,269
Lewis, wait!

277
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:35,116
She's gonna blow!

278
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:38,202
Watch out!

279
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:44,291
Feel the pain! Love the...

280
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,460
Hurts so much! Make it stop!

281
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:53,634
Make it stop!

282
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,136
Coach, suck it up, okay?

283
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:58,639
Let us conduct ourselves in a way
that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.

284
00:16:58,806 --> 00:17:00,558
- Let's calm down!
- Mr Willerstein?

285
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:02,309
- I didn't mean to...
- Not now, Lewis!

286
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:05,062
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

287
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:06,647
Not now.

288
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:10,818
Okay, and we are walking
in a calm, orderly fashion

289
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,069
toward the exits.

290
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,075
Wait, Lewis!

291
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:39,597
Come, my dear. Our future awaits.

292
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:03,514
Hey, what are you doing up here?

293
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:21,240
Would you quit that, please?
I know you're not a pigeon.

294
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:23,784
You're blowing my cover.

295
00:19:23,868 --> 00:19:25,453
We're the only ones up here.

296
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:27,538
That's just what they want you to think.

297
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,290
Now, enough moping.

298
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:32,293
Take this back to the science fair
and fix that Memory Scanner.

299
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,295
Stop! Stop! Get away from me!

300
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:35,463
Maybe you've forgotten.

301
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:38,132
I'm a time cop from the future,
should be taken very seriously.

302
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,384
That's no badge.

303
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:43,804
This is a coupon for a tanning salon!
You're a fake.

304
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:46,015
Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop,

305
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,100
but I really am from the future,

306
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:50,186
and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.

307
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:51,479
Here we go again.

308
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:53,564
He stole a time machine,
came to the science fair

309
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:54,732
and ruined your project.

310
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:57,151
My project didn't work
because I'm no good.

311
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:59,820
There is no Bowler Hat Guy,
there is no time machine,

312
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,489
and you're not from the future!

313
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:02,698
You're crazy!

314
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:04,575
I am not crazy.

315
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:07,078
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel?
Prove it.

316
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,498
Yeah, that's what I thought.

317
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:13,501
I'm just gonna go lock myself
in my room

318
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:15,503
and hide under the covers
for a couple years.

319
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:18,964
If I prove to you I'm from the future,
will you go back to the science fair?

320
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,300
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

321
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:23,344
Hey, let go of me!

322
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:25,513
- What are you doing? Let go of me!
- Okay.

323
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,952
What is this? Where are we going?

324
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:50,371
To the future!

325
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:13,060
<i>The future has arrived</i>

326
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:16,814
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

327
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:19,233
<i>The future has arrived</i>

328
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:23,154
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

329
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:05,529
Is this proof enough for you?

330
00:22:05,696 --> 00:22:07,281
Is it ever!

331
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:10,368
I never thought that time travel
could be possible in my lifetime,

332
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:12,953
and here it is, right in front of me!

333
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:14,789
The truth will set you free, brother.

334
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:17,792
This is beyond anything
I could've imagined.

335
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,795
This means
I could really change my life.

336
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:22,296
That's right. You can.

337
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:24,799
Next stop, science fair,
to fix your Memory Scanner.

338
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:27,635
Hey, I'm not gonna fix
that stupid Memory Scanner.

339
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:31,305
- What?
- Wilbur, this is a time machine!

340
00:22:31,472 --> 00:22:33,140
Why should I fix my dumb invention

341
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:36,727
when you can take me
to see my mom now in this ship?

342
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:42,483
I could actually go back to that night
and stop her from giving me up.

343
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,486
The answer is not a time machine.
It's this.

344
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:47,905
This? You want to know
what I think about this?

345
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:49,156
What are you doing?

346
00:22:49,323 --> 00:22:50,491
I'm sorry, Wilbur,

347
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:52,410
but you don't know
what I've lived through.

348
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,328
- Lewis, no!
- Let go!

349
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:56,330
- You let go!
- You're not the boss of me!

350
00:22:56,497 --> 00:22:59,667
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.

351
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,168
That makes me older.

352
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:02,336
Well, I was born in the past,

353
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:04,505
which makes me older
and the boss of you!

354
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,525
I am so dead.

355
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:28,863
I'm not allowed to look at this thing,
let alone drive it!

356
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:30,364
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me,

357
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:33,200
and I can tell you this.
It will not be done with mercy.

358
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:35,036
Isn't there like
a time machine repair shop

359
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,203
- or something?
- No!

360
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:38,372
There's only two time machines
in existence,

361
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,291
and the Bowler Hat Guy
has the other one!

362
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,877
Well, somebody's gonna have
to fix this.

363
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:46,047
Good idea. You're smart. You fix it.

364
00:23:46,213 --> 00:23:48,632
Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.

365
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:51,302
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.

366
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:54,555
All right, under one condition.

367
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:57,641
I fix it,
you take me back to see my mom.

368
00:23:57,808 --> 00:24:00,728
What? You didn't even follow through
on our last deal.

369
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:01,896
How can I trust you?

370
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:04,732
Well, you told me you were a time cop
from the future.

371
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:06,567
How can I trust you?

372
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:08,402
<i>Touché.</i>

373
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:12,073
So do we have a deal?

374
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:45,272
Good day, madam.

375
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:48,859
- I'm here to change the future.
- Yes, sir?

376
00:24:48,943 --> 00:24:52,780
I must speak with the man
in charge immediately.

377
00:24:52,947 --> 00:24:56,200
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with destiny.

378
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:57,952
Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know,

379
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,287
and I'll have your dry cleaning
delivered directly to your suite.

380
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:02,456
- What?
- Now, what time is your appointment?

381
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,460
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

382
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:08,295
What time is your appointment?

383
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:13,718
Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00!

384
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:15,469
You're the 2:00?

385
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,638
Yes. Yes, I am.

386
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,557
You're Mary Johnson?

387
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:21,976
Yes.

388
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,729
Mary is short for...

389
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:26,814
Marian?

390
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:29,817
- Can that be a boy name?
- Yes.

391
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:32,486
- Then yes.
- Have a seat.

392
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,988
Oh, goody!

393
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:48,669
"Pass off invention as my own. " Check.
Oh, I love checklists.

394
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:50,421
The board is ready to see you now.

395
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:53,924
Wait. What am I going to say?

396
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:56,927
I'm never gonna remember that.

397
00:25:57,178 --> 00:26:00,431
Would you... Why don't you go?
You do it so much better than me.

398
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,767
That's true.

399
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,519
A hat without a head
couldn't really pass off an invention

400
00:26:05,686 --> 00:26:06,771
as its own.

401
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:12,109
Fantastic! Great idea!
I'm so glad I have you!

402
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:21,869
"Prepare to be amazed. " Oh, I got it!

403
00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:25,873
Prepare to be amazed!

404
00:26:26,624 --> 00:26:31,045
"This is my invention. "

405
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:35,216
"I doubt any of you have seen
anything as brilliant as this device. "

406
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:36,384
Very well,

407
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:38,719
Miss Johnson?

408
00:26:39,387 --> 00:26:40,805
It's Ms.

409
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:43,474
You have two minutes. Please begin.

410
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:50,481
- It's shiny!
- What is that thing?

411
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:55,152
Well, I like to call it my...

412
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:57,154
To call it my...

413
00:26:57,321 --> 00:27:01,492
- What are you looking at?
- No! I... The sun, in my eyes.

414
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:03,411
Well, then let me close the blinds.

415
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:11,085
Now, the name?

416
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:13,170
Well, what...

417
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:15,005
We can quibble about names
at a later date.

418
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:17,842
The point is,
what I have here is special, unique.

419
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:21,345
Yes. Yes, you must love it
and buy it and mass produce it,

420
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:25,349
and the best part is,
it's got really comfy headphones.

421
00:27:29,854 --> 00:27:32,690
I wonder, could you lean forward
just a little bit, please?

422
00:27:32,857 --> 00:27:34,608
Yes, thank you.

423
00:27:34,775 --> 00:27:37,361
Yes, they are quite comfortable.

424
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,947
What do you hope
to accomplish with this?

425
00:27:40,031 --> 00:27:41,699
Oh, nothing of consequence.

426
00:27:41,782 --> 00:27:46,537
I simply wish to crush the dreams
of a poor little orphan boy!

427
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:50,207
After that, it's all a little fuzzy.

428
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,043
You mean,
you haven't thought this through?

429
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:54,295
Thirty seconds.

430
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:00,718
Allow me to show you how it works.

431
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:02,887
First, we turn it on.

432
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:07,808
That's not it.

433
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:10,811
Ten seconds.

434
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,916
So where do I sign?

435
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,182
Doris, it's all over.

436
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,267
All our hopes and dreams dashed,

437
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:51,105
like so many pieces
of a broken machiney thing.

438
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,107
You're right.

439
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,944
Success is still ours for the taking.

440
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,281
We must find that boy.

441
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:08,789
We'll sneak this thing into the garage.
You'll have all the tools you need.

442
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:09,957
What about your parents?

443
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,208
Mom never goes in there,

444
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,460
and Dad's on a business trip
until tomorrow morning.

445
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:14,628
You've got till then to fix it.

446
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,881
Well, fine, but I'm gonna need
some blueprints or something for this.

447
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,384
No worries. I got someone
who could help us with that.

448
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,306
<i>Who dares to disturb my sanctuary?</i>

449
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,475
Carl, it's me. Let me in.

450
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,812
<i>None may enter
unless they speak the royal password.</i>

451
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,314
Carl, what are you talking about?
We don't have a password.

452
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,735
<i>Yes, we do.
I made one up while you were gone.</i>

453
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,987
Well, then
how am I supposed to know what it is?

454
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,488
<i>You...</i>

455
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,241
<i>Good point.</i>

456
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,328
Welcome back, little buddy.

457
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,998
So what's up
with the stolen time machine?

458
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,667
Did you find it? Apparently not,

459
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,420
and you managed
to bust this one as well.

460
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,088
It'll be fixed before Dad gets home.

461
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,758
And how do you suppose
that's gonna...

462
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,926
- Who's that?
- Wow, a real robot!

463
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,178
Hi, I'm Lewis.

464
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,686
Well, that was unexpected.

465
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,855
As was that.

466
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,524
If my family finds out
I brought you from the past,

467
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,693
they'll bury me alive
and dance on my grave.

468
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,863
I'm not exaggerating.
Well, yes, I am, but not the point.

469
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,199
The point is,
your hair's a dead giveaway.

470
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,034
Why would my hair be
a dead giveaway?

471
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,869
That is an excellent question.

472
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,454
Wait! Where are you going?

473
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,039
Another excellent question.

474
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,542
But I don't just want to sit here.

475
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,044
Stay.

476
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:38,379
But...

477
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,312
Wow!

478
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,736
Hey, ring my doorbell.

479
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,238
No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.

480
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,490
Ring it. Ring it. Ring it.
Look at this door bell. Ring it.

481
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,577
- Yes!
- That was accidental.

482
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,162
That's an accidental ring.
It doesn't count.

483
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,414
It's in the rule book. Look it up.

484
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,998
- Flat head.
- Short roots.

485
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,166
Evergreen.

486
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,674
What do you mean,
don't go to the family?

487
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:27,511
How can we not go to the family
in this time of family crisis?

488
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:31,348
By leaving the garage door unlocked,
you let the time machine get stolen,

489
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:34,351
and now the entire time stream
could be altered!

490
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,103
That and someone took my bike.

491
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,939
Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.

492
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,859
First, we keep Lewis in the garage,
away from everybody.

493
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,861
I show up and give him
the pep talk of the century.

494
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,446
Then he fixes the time machine.

495
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,364
Why is it an acorn?

496
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,199
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.

497
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,285
Okay, now, the time machine is fixed.

498
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,037
His confidence in inventing is restored.

499
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,622
He goes back to the science fair,
fixes his Memory Scanner,

500
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,624
thus restoring
the space-time continuum.

501
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,543
What about taking him back
to see his mom?

502
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,462
I just told him that to buy some time.

503
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,965
Oh, yeah, can't see that one
blowing up in your face.

504
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,800
Trust me. I got it under control.

505
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,053
Wilbur Robinson never fails.

506
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,057
But on the slight chance that I do...

507
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,310
"On the slight chance," yeah.
You know what? I'll run the numbers.

508
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,315
What is it?

509
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:23,150
Well, it's not...

510
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:28,405
It doesn't pertain to anything in...
You know, there's not necessarily...

511
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:33,327
There's a 99.999999% chance
that you won't exist.

512
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:36,830
- What?
- And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.

513
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,332
I won't exist?

514
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,000
And where does that leave me?

515
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,419
Alone, rusting in a corner.

516
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,341
What am I worried about?
Now, blueprints?

517
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:54,431
If this thing ever blows over,
I really gotta get away from you

518
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:55,849
and get some quiet time.

519
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:00,437
What's...

520
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,773
Well, hey, there, little fella!

521
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,610
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and my clothes are not on backwards.

522
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,278
My head is!

523
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,616
Oh, I used to tell that one
to my science students.

524
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,202
They didn't laugh, either.

525
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,371
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?

526
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,540
- Well, Lewis, but...
- Lewis, huh?

527
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:22,793
Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen
any teeth around here, have you?

528
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,545
- Teeth?
- Yeah, my teeth.

529
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,215
Been digging holes all day.
Can't find them anywhere.

530
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,467
All right, look, old man,
I need to get back to the garage.

531
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,719
Wilbur left me down there,

532
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,137
and I wasn't supposed to leave,
and these monsters...

533
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,304
- Monsters?
... attacked me on the porch and...

534
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,306
There's no monsters on the porch,
you ninny.

535
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,975
- Listen to me!
- Of course, I also didn't think

536
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,727
there was a woodchuck
living on my arm,

537
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,311
and lookie there!

538
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,479
Hope he ain't got rabies.

539
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,732
Old man, I need to get to the garage!

540
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,736
Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy.
I know a shortcut.

541
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,821
Welcome to the garage.

542
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:52,990
Well, I'm completely lost.

543
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,241
Hiya, Grandpa.

544
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,409
Hey, Aunt Billie.

545
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:57,077
Lewis and me
are looking for the garage.

546
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,496
- We have a garage?
- Apparently so.

547
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,915
Lewis, will you give me a hand
and time my race?

548
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,919
Okay, Gaston,
my toy train's ready for you.

549
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,256
That's a toy train?

550
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:15,345
On your mark, get set, go?

551
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,435
- 3.7 seconds.
- I win!

552
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,022
Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.

553
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:27,441
Lewis?

554
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,611
<i>- And five and six and seven and eight.
- That's Uncle Joe. He works out.</i>

555
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:31,779
<i>Keep those tummies tucked.</i>

556
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,948
This isn't the garage.

557
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,116
I know.

558
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,619
I don't think
the garage is in here, either.

559
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:41,455
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.

560
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,124
- That's Uncle Art.
- A real superhero?

561
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,126
Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy,

562
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,545
needs a large
cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?

563
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:52,049
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

564
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,885
- He's a...
- Pizza delivery guy.

565
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,303
Lewis?

566
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,473
- What are we doing up here?
- Looking for the garage.

567
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,308
Oh, yeah!

568
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:11,985
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat,
or I'm telling Ma!

569
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,405
- Lighten up, sis!
- Lasz, I mean it!

570
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,825
Children, please!
Your mother is trying to take a nap.

571
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,910
What is all the yelling out here?

572
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,245
- He started it!
- She started it!

573
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,663
I don't want to hear any more!

574
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,250
- Now, sweetie...
- Don't you "sweetie" me!

575
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,669
I'm going for a drive!

576
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,925
That's strange.
She usually takes the Harley.

577
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,844
Lewis!

578
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,596
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.

579
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,350
Bake them cookies, Lucille!

580
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:44,768
Why is your dog wearing glasses?

581
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,022
Oh, 'cause his insurance
won't pay for contacts.

582
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,858
That's Uncle Spike,
and there's Uncle Dimitri.

583
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,361
- Oh, look, there's...
- That's the monster!

584
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:57,364
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.

585
00:35:58,615 --> 00:35:59,950
Nice to meet you.

586
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,411
Hey, Lefty,
any idea how to get to the garage?

587
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,873
Well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.

588
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,125
- Who?
- Wilbur's mom, Franny.

589
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,877
I think you'll like her.

590
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,466
Hey, guys!

591
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:20,054
<i>You ask me over
And over and over</i>

592
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:23,265
<i>Have you seen
My peacock-feathered hat?</i>

593
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,558
Frogs?

594
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,143
Taught them everything they know.

595
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,271
- Franny, this is Lewis.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

596
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,941
Perfect timing.
We need someone on maracas.

597
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:37,363
<i>Where is your heart at?
Nobody knows that</i>

598
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:39,573
<i>Even though you've him, her, me</i>

599
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,326
<i>And an army searching</i>

600
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:48,040
<i>I've got a feeling
You will be reeling</i>

601
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,710
<i>When you are bad
And the circus comes to town</i>

602
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,587
Grandpa, I think I found your teeth.

603
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,506
<i>And you see me leaving
Dressed up as a magician</i>

604
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,757
<i>Or something like that</i>

605
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:01,095
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!

606
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,638
Ring-a-ding-ding.

607
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:09,687
All right!

608
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,940
Right. Well, glad I could help
with the teeth,

609
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,442
but, wow, look at the time.

610
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,947
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!

611
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,199
I did, but I went up the tube,
and I ran into your family, and I...

612
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,868
You met my family?

613
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:28,872
Pop quiz.

614
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,457
Who have you met,
and what have you learnt?

615
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,543
Okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.

616
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,045
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...

617
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,380
Cranky? Yes.

618
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:37,965
<i>Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.</i>

619
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,050
<i>Joe is married to Billie.
Lefty is the butler.</i>

620
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,301
<i>Spike and Dimitri are twins,</i>

621
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,220
and I don't know who they're related to.

622
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,388
Neither do we. Go on.

623
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,975
Lucille is married to Bud,
and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.

624
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,602
What does Cornelius look like?

625
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,979
Tom Selleck.

626
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:57,234
Okay, Cornelius is married to Franny,
and her brothers are Gaston and Art.

627
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,569
You're forgetting something.

628
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,903
Forgetting? Oh, right.

629
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:02,489
<i>Wilbur is the son
of Franny and Cornelius.</i>

630
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,241
And nobody realised
you were from the past?

631
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,409
Nope.

632
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,036
Thank you. Thank you.

633
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,581
Hold your applause.
Thank you very much.

634
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,804
Doris, get it off! Get it off!

635
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,355
I've got you now.

636
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,856
Lewis!

637
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:41,612
No, Lewis is my stupid roommate.

638
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:45,074
My name's Mike Yagoobian.
People call me Goob,

639
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,744
but today, everyone that beat me up
called me "puke face"

640
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:51,622
and "butterfingers"
and "booger breath. "

641
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:54,625
Nice to see that they're branching out.

642
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,336
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

643
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,546
Well, I was just looking for Lewis.

644
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,633
Try the roof.
He's always up there being dumb.

645
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,886
Of course. Why didn't I think of that?

646
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,306
Mr Steak, you're my only friend.

647
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,310
Game didn't go so well, huh?

648
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:17,940
No, I fell asleep in the ninth inning,
and I missed the winning catch.

649
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:19,900
Then I got beat up.

650
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:24,196
Afterwards, Coach took me aside
and told me to let it go.

651
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,407
I don't know. He's probably right.

652
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,658
No!

653
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,744
Everyone will tell you to let it go
and move on, but don't.

654
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:34,915
Instead, let it fester
and boil inside of you.

655
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,917
Take these feelings
and lock them away.

656
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,669
Let them fuel your actions.

657
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,838
Let hate be your ally,

658
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:44,675
and you will be capable
of wonderfully horrid things.

659
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,014
Heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.

660
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:55,477
What?

661
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:03,819
Where is that boy?

662
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,199
Good idea!
Separate and look for clues.

663
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,540
Look, my dear! Look what I found!
It's a stick.

664
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,917
Now, what did you find?

665
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:22,713
Yes. Yes, I see.

666
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,966
Time travel residue next to DNA
from Wilbur Robinson.

667
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:29,470
That plus my stick must mean...

668
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,733
To the future! Shotgun!

669
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:52,034
I don't even know what I'm doing.

670
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,243
Keep moving forward.

671
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:55,412
I mean,
this stuff is way too advanced for me.

672
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:56,580
Keep moving forward.

673
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:58,832
And what if I can't fix this?
What are we gonna do?

674
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,084
Keep moving forward.

675
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:01,668
Why do you keep saying that?

676
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,754
And don't just say,
"Keep moving forward. "

677
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:05,255
It's my dad's motto.

678
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,341
Why would his motto be
"keep moving forward"?

679
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,759
It's what he does.

680
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,552
What's that supposed to mean?

681
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,596
That is an excellent question.

682
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,098
Robinson Industries,

683
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,934
the world's leading
scientific-research-and-design factory.

684
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,853
My dad runs the company.
They mass produce his inventions.

685
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:24,108
His motto, "Keep moving forward. "
It's what he does.

686
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,943
- What has he invented?
- Everything.

687
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,945
Carl, the time machine,
the travel tubes.

688
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:30,864
Your dad invented the time machine?

689
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,449
Yep. Five years ago,

690
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,702
Dad wakes up in the middle
of the night in a cold sweat.

691
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,788
He wants to build a time machine,
so he starts working.

692
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,290
We're talking plans.
We're talking scale models.

693
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,084
We're talking prototypes.

694
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,627
That's a prototype?

695
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:46,964
- The very first, or what's left of it.
- Yikes.

696
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,299
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.

697
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:51,301
Prototypes two and three,
not much better.

698
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,636
Number six, 58,

699
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,221
212, 485,

700
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,472
952,

701
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,808
and they all end the same way.

702
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,813
But he doesn't give up.

703
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:06,567
Dude, I can't take you seriously
in that hat.

704
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,903
He keeps working and working
until finally he gets it,

705
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,655
the first working time machine.

706
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:15,075
Then he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it again,

707
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,326
the second working time machine.

708
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,661
Kind of small.

709
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,872
I'm assuming that's a joke.
I'm ignoring you for time reasons.

710
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:21,457
This, my friend, is merely a model

711
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:24,501
because, unfortunately,
time machine number two

712
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:28,213
<i>is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.</i>

713
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,514
- Pretty amazing story, huh?
- Yeah.

714
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:40,100
Now, are you ready to start working?

715
00:42:54,031 --> 00:42:56,658
I think that's it. I did it!

716
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:58,202
I knew you could.

717
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:03,874
Nice work, my friend.

718
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:17,888
Well, you know what they say!
"Keep moving... "

719
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,598
Don't say it!

720
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,481
<i>Boys! Dinner time!</i>

721
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,732
Not now, Mom!

722
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:32,486
<i>If you aren't up here in five minutes,
I'm gonna come down and get you!</i>

723
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,490
We'd better get up there.

724
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:42,538
Let's get that boy!

725
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,665
Sit here?

726
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:46,500
But I want to look, too.

727
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,337
A mini-Doris!

728
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:53,716
I didn't even know you could do that.
It's so cute.

729
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,677
Let's take her out for a spin.

730
00:43:58,095 --> 00:43:59,513
Sorry.

731
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:02,182
Teamwork.

732
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,353
<i>Sorry.</i>

733
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:09,106
<i>Sorry!</i>

734
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,113
There you are.

735
00:44:17,114 --> 00:44:19,867
Now, to lure him out of the house.

736
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:25,289
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes!
Yes, and... No.

737
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:28,625
No, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.

738
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,627
<i>Oh! I know!</i>

739
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:34,631
I'll turn him into a duck!
Yes! Yes, it's so evil!

740
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:37,885
I don't know how to do that.

741
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:40,804
I don't really need a duck.

742
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,351
This may be harder than I thought.

743
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:50,022
Hey, ring my doorbell.

744
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:51,982
No, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.

745
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,817
That doorbell will give you a rash.

746
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,904
Yes! I'm two for two, man.

747
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:58,572
If they don't do it on purpose,
it doesn't count.

748
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,908
- Come on. Read your rule book.
- You know what?

749
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:02,826
You can take your rule book
and shove it right...

750
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:06,413
<i>I don't believe in fretting or grieving</i>

751
00:45:06,497 --> 00:45:08,582
<i>Why mess around with strife?</i>

752
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:12,586
<i>Guess I was cut out
To step out and strut out</i>

753
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,004
<i>Give me the simple life</i>

754
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:18,008
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

755
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:20,677
Dinner is served.

756
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:21,845
Dinner is served.

757
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,433
Hooray! Italian food.

758
00:45:26,517 --> 00:45:27,935
I want a sloppy joe!

759
00:45:28,102 --> 00:45:30,354
Oh, Billie,
could you please pass the gravy?

760
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:31,689
Coming to you, big girl.

761
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:35,526
Reminds me of the time
my meatball pizza staved off civil war

762
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:37,528
on the black moon of Keward.

763
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:40,364
Where's my sloppy joe?

764
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:41,865
Thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.

765
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:44,284
- We gotta talk.
- How about some gravy? Over here.

766
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:47,121
Why is the kid still here?
Any of this ring a bell?

767
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:51,041
Science fair, Memory Scanner,
a time stream that needs fixing?

768
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,209
Temporary setback.

769
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:54,128
He's just having
a little confidence issue.

770
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,379
- You want me to talk to him?
- No.

771
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:56,880
- I give a mean back rub.
- No.

772
00:45:56,964 --> 00:45:58,048
- Shiatsu?
- No.

773
00:45:58,132 --> 00:45:59,299
- Feng shui.
- No.

774
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:00,718
I've got it under control.

775
00:46:02,386 --> 00:46:04,304
So, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?

776
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:05,556
- No.
- Yes.

777
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,724
- Yes.
- No.

778
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,225
Well, yes and no.

779
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:11,145
Lewis is a new transfer student.

780
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:12,563
Yeah.

781
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:15,149
- Where are you from, Lewis?
- Canada?

782
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:18,819
I think you mean North Montana.
Hasn't been called Canada in years.

783
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,655
Do you know Sam Gundersen?

784
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:24,241
- It's a big country.
- State.

785
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:27,077
- I wonder if you're related.
- Maybe if he took his hat off.

786
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:28,495
Oh, good idea.

787
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:31,165
Then we can see
if he has the family cowlick.

788
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:34,585
He can't,
because he's got bad hat-hair.

789
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:36,253
Oh, nonsense.

790
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:39,256
A North Montana man doesn't care
about hat-hair.

791
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:40,758
Let's see the cowlick!

792
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,259
All right, everyone, hold your horses.

793
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:43,594
Lewis, do you mind?

794
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:46,096
I'm afraid
this isn't gonna stop otherwise.

795
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,598
- But... But...
- And so it begins.

796
00:46:47,765 --> 00:46:48,849
Now, don't be shy.

797
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,435
- We're all family here.
- Ready, aim, fire!

798
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:59,276
Surely, that is not the best you can do.

799
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:04,281
Impressive, little sister.

800
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:07,034
Your skills are strong,
but not strong enough.

801
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:09,453
Your words
do not threaten me, brother.

802
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,123
Then enough words.
Now the real battle begins.

803
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,636
Your meatballs are useless against me.

804
00:47:25,803 --> 00:47:29,390
Then perhaps it's time
for spicy Italian sausage!

805
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:30,641
No!

806
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:42,653
That's right. I did it.

807
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:44,321
Is dinner like this every night?

808
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:46,240
No, yesterday, we had meatloaf.

809
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:54,164
Okay, gang,
time for the second course.

810
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:58,669
And what goes better with meatballs
than P.B. and J?

811
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:01,755
Hey, that's just like...

812
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:07,094
Stupid...

813
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:08,429
Carl?

814
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:09,596
Is everything all right?

815
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,267
We're just experiencing bugs.

816
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:16,687
Just what the doctor ordered.

817
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:19,690
My friend Lewis is an inventor.
He can fix it.

818
00:48:19,857 --> 00:48:21,358
Wilbur, you know I can't.

819
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:23,277
Come on. Give it a try.

820
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,030
You don't understand
what's at stake here.

821
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:28,782
Uncle Joe's seen the toast!

822
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,785
We're past the point of no return!

823
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:34,038
If he doesn't get P.B. and J...

824
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:35,873
We all pay!

825
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,541
I don't know.

826
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:39,710
You would really be
helping us out, Lewis.

827
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:41,045
Please.

828
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:47,468
One dragonfly on the rocks, please,
Mr Barkeep.

829
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:50,804
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby,
you gotta tell us one of your jokes.

830
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:53,724
Yeah, Frankie.
How about that one with the bullfrog?

831
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:55,642
All right, you bozos.

832
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,562
<i>Have to get that boy out of the house.</i>

833
00:48:59,897 --> 00:49:01,482
<i>Sorry. Wait!</i>

834
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,901
<i>So I turn to the bullfrog,
and you know what I says?</i>

835
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:07,237
Talking frogs
with their own little outdoor bar,

836
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:10,074
and so smartly dressed! Perfect!

837
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,659
I says,
"Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't. "

838
00:49:13,911 --> 00:49:16,246
- Frankie, you're a riot.
- I gotta go pee!

839
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:17,915
- I love it.
- You bunch of goons.

840
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:29,593
That's a good buzz. What the...

841
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,347
Yes! You are now under my control.

842
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,516
I am now under your control.

843
00:49:38,268 --> 00:49:40,104
- Stop laughing.
- Stop laughing.

844
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,190
- Don't repeat everything I say.
- I won't repeat everything you say.

845
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:45,109
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

846
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:48,112
Did you just say, "Excellent,"
because I said, "Excellent"?

847
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:50,698
No.

848
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:53,033
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

849
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:57,871
- So, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking?
- Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.

850
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:00,040
I've recalibrated
the dispensing conduits

851
00:50:00,124 --> 00:50:02,376
and aligned
the ejection mechanism and...

852
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:06,130
There he is,
that repulsive, half-witted fool!

853
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:08,132
Now, my slave, seize the boy.

854
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:09,883
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

855
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:15,556
Did you not hear what I said, you idiot?
Grab the boy and bring him!

856
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:19,893
Well, it's just that
there's a million people over there,

857
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:22,229
and I have little arms.

858
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:26,150
I'm just not so sure
how well this plan was thought through.

859
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,988
Master?

860
00:50:32,906 --> 00:50:33,991
<i>Master?</i>

861
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:37,578
Okay, that should do it.

862
00:50:37,995 --> 00:50:40,497
It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!

863
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:43,417
Quickly.
Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.

864
00:50:43,751 --> 00:50:44,835
Everybody ready?

865
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:46,670
- Go, Carl.
- Yeah!

866
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:51,258
Is it gonna work?

867
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:52,676
Oh, no!

868
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,182
No!

869
00:50:58,265 --> 00:51:01,685
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

870
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:04,271
- You failed!
- And it was awesome!

871
00:51:04,438 --> 00:51:06,690
- Exceptional!
- Outstanding!

872
00:51:07,691 --> 00:51:08,692
I've seen better.

873
00:51:08,776 --> 00:51:12,613
From failing, you learn.
From success, not so much.

874
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,531
If I gave up every time I failed,

875
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:16,533
I never would have made
the meatball cannon.

876
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,119
I never would have made
my fireproof pants.

877
00:51:21,622 --> 00:51:22,873
Still working out the kinks.

878
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,292
Like my husband always says...

879
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:34,385
<i>Keep moving
Keep moving</i>

880
00:51:34,468 --> 00:51:35,552
<i>Stop</i>

881
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:43,727
Okay, talking frog, not a good minion.

882
00:51:43,894 --> 00:51:46,230
Need another henchman,
something large, not too bright.

883
00:51:46,397 --> 00:51:48,065
Something that won't talk back.

884
00:51:48,232 --> 00:51:50,401
What is he still doing here?
Get rid of him.

885
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:51,985
Oh, my noggin.

886
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:54,405
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your lousy mitts off of me!

887
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:56,573
You're gonna regret this!

888
00:51:57,491 --> 00:52:01,912
Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!

889
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:05,499
I wonder if I should tell Doris.

890
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:07,918
No, I'll make it a surprise.

891
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,260
All right, everyone, quiet down.
Quiet down.

892
00:52:16,343 --> 00:52:20,180
I propose a toast to Lewis
and his brilliant failure.

893
00:52:20,264 --> 00:52:22,850
May it lead to success in the future.

894
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:25,602
Gosh, you're all so nice.

895
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:28,522
If I had a family, I...

896
00:52:29,523 --> 00:52:31,608
I'd want them to be just like you.

897
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:34,445
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!

898
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:36,196
To Lewis!

899
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,281
To Lewis!

900
00:52:37,448 --> 00:52:38,615
Yeah!

901
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:41,618
- Come on, Lewis!
- Good show, buddy!

902
00:52:42,703 --> 00:52:44,788
What if Louis Armstrong said,
"I can't"?

903
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:46,123
You think he'd have walked
on the moon?

904
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,625
Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.

905
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:54,381
What did he mean, if he had a family?

906
00:52:54,465 --> 00:52:55,883
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.

907
00:52:55,966 --> 00:52:57,301
Orphan?

908
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:12,566
- Oh, no!
- Big boy!

909
00:53:13,484 --> 00:53:15,152
Get up, you pansy!

910
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:16,570
What a great plan!

911
00:53:16,737 --> 00:53:20,991
Go back in time and steal a dinosaur.
Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.

912
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:24,328
Why didn't you tell me
you had a pet dinosaur?

913
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:25,496
Because we don't.

914
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:27,748
What are you talking about?
He's standing right here.

915
00:53:29,917 --> 00:53:32,669
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!

916
00:53:32,753 --> 00:53:34,421
<i>I need him alive.</i>

917
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:37,841
Choo-chew on this!

918
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:43,013
Lewis!

919
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:51,689
Ready, aim, fire!

920
00:54:00,531 --> 00:54:01,865
Got you!

921
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:06,537
You messed with the wrong family!

922
00:54:14,128 --> 00:54:15,963
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!

923
00:54:20,968 --> 00:54:22,052
No!

924
00:54:24,138 --> 00:54:27,141
Okay, everybody,
this dino's deep-dished.

925
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:31,145
Run!

926
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,898
Oh! He ate Carl!

927
00:54:35,983 --> 00:54:39,486
- Help us! Help! Help!
- Oh, goodness!

928
00:54:51,749 --> 00:54:52,750
Oh, no.

929
00:54:58,922 --> 00:55:00,174
Incoming!

930
00:55:01,425 --> 00:55:02,593
Run!

931
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,597
Now, go get that boy!

932
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:25,699
<i>What's going on?</i>

933
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:26,867
Why aren't you seizing the boy?

934
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:28,202
I have a big head...

935
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:30,037
...and little arms.

936
00:55:30,204 --> 00:55:31,622
I'm just not sure...

937
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:33,624
...how well this plan was
thought through.

938
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,544
Master?

939
00:55:38,629 --> 00:55:40,881
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

940
00:55:44,968 --> 00:55:46,136
Bowler Hat Guy!

941
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,638
Him you can eat.

942
00:55:47,888 --> 00:55:50,140
- Lewis, run!
- Wilbur!

943
00:56:08,325 --> 00:56:09,410
No!

944
00:56:30,931 --> 00:56:32,266
Oh, no!

945
00:56:33,684 --> 00:56:36,687
Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.

946
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:44,028
- Nice catch.
- Nice meatball shooting!

947
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:45,696
Guess we made
a pretty good team, huh?

948
00:56:45,779 --> 00:56:47,448
Yeah, guess we did.

949
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:50,284
- Are you boys all right?
- We're good, Mom.

950
00:56:50,451 --> 00:56:52,202
Yeah, didn't you see us
take out that dinosaur?

951
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:54,621
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!

952
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:59,293
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...

953
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:00,961
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.

954
00:57:04,131 --> 00:57:05,966
I'm really happy you're safe.

955
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:07,885
- Your head.
- What?

956
00:57:08,886 --> 00:57:10,471
It's just a bruise, Lewis.

957
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:15,309
You all sacrificed so much for me.

958
00:57:15,392 --> 00:57:18,395
- Well, of course.
- You are a special kid.

959
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:19,730
One of a kind.

960
00:57:19,813 --> 00:57:23,067
Okay, you should get him out of here
before something really bad happens.

961
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:26,403
Silly, silly robot.
I've got it all under control.

962
00:57:26,737 --> 00:57:29,073
Okay, everybody,
it's been a long, hard day

963
00:57:29,156 --> 00:57:31,075
filled with emotional turmoil
and dinosaur fights,

964
00:57:31,158 --> 00:57:34,078
so why don't you all hit the hay,
and Lewis and me will get going?

965
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:39,666
Do you have to go now?
I mean, you know, it's getting late.

966
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:43,253
Maybe Lewis could spend the night.

967
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,255
Mom, maybe some other time, okay?

968
00:57:45,422 --> 00:57:49,343
Well, any time you want to come over,
you just come over.

969
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,513
- Mom.
- The truth is, we love having you.

970
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,182
- We really have to go.
- No.

971
00:57:55,933 --> 00:57:59,103
No, you don't. You have to stay.

972
00:57:59,853 --> 00:58:03,440
I mean, who would be a better family
for you than us?

973
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:05,776
What do you say, Lewis?

974
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:08,362
Do you want to be a Robinson?

975
00:58:10,948 --> 00:58:13,951
You want to adopt me?

976
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:25,462
- Yeah!
- Yes!

977
00:58:34,471 --> 00:58:36,890
Okay, it's true. I'm from the past.

978
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:38,225
Now you know the big secret.

979
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:42,479
Wilbur, what have you done?
How could you bring him here?

980
00:58:42,563 --> 00:58:44,481
That is an excellent question.

981
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:46,066
Please, don't get mad at Wilbur.

982
00:58:46,233 --> 00:58:47,568
He was just being a good friend.

983
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:51,822
Lewis, I am so sorry,
but you have to go.

984
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:53,407
What? You just said...

985
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,409
I know what I said.

986
00:58:55,492 --> 00:58:57,494
I'm from the past. So what?

987
00:58:58,579 --> 00:59:01,165
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...

988
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:03,417
You're a great kid,

989
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,420
and we would never do anything
to hurt you,

990
00:59:07,755 --> 00:59:11,425
but I'm sorry.
You have to go back to your own time.

991
00:59:12,426 --> 00:59:17,681
Yeah, about that,
one of the time machines is broken,

992
00:59:17,848 --> 00:59:21,352
and the other one was stolen
by a guy with a bowler hat,

993
00:59:21,435 --> 00:59:24,438
which kind of explains the dino.

994
00:59:29,777 --> 00:59:31,028
I'm calling your father.

995
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:32,696
Wait. If I have to leave,

996
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,032
can I at least go back
and find my mom?

997
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:36,867
Wilbur promised.

998
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:38,202
You promised what?

999
00:59:38,285 --> 00:59:40,120
I was never gonna do it. I swear!

1000
00:59:40,788 --> 00:59:43,207
- You lied to me?
- No!

1001
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:45,542
Yes.

1002
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:47,211
Lewis! Lewis, wait!

1003
00:59:47,378 --> 00:59:50,881
I can't believe I was dumb enough
to actually believe you were my friend!

1004
00:59:51,465 --> 00:59:52,883
I am your friend!

1005
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:56,553
Mister, you're grounded till you die.

1006
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:21,412
<i>Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.</i>

1007
01:00:21,495 --> 01:00:26,583
<i>All he wants to do is go back in time
to meet the mother he never knew,</i>

1008
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:32,089
<i>but they won't let him.
We'd let him, though.</i>

1009
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:36,010
<i>Too bad
we don't have a time machine.</i>

1010
01:00:36,176 --> 01:00:39,596
<i>Oh, wait. We do.</i>

1011
01:00:40,014 --> 01:00:41,515
Bowler Hat Guy?

1012
01:00:41,932 --> 01:00:44,685
- Hello, Lewis.
- What do you want?

1013
01:00:44,852 --> 01:00:47,521
To make your dream come true.

1014
01:00:47,604 --> 01:00:50,774
All you have to do is put
Humpty Dumpty back together again,

1015
01:00:50,858 --> 01:00:53,360
and we'll take you back
to find your mommy.

1016
01:00:54,194 --> 01:00:55,362
Lewis!

1017
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,699
Let's just talk about this, Lewis.
Come on!

1018
01:00:58,866 --> 01:01:00,534
I know you're around here somewhere.

1019
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,371
Lewis!

1020
01:01:25,642 --> 01:01:29,063
I can't imagine why you're so interested
in this piece of junk.

1021
01:01:29,063 --> 01:01:31,482
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

1022
01:01:31,565 --> 01:01:33,650
Now, show me how to work this thing.

1023
01:01:33,817 --> 01:01:35,486
It doesn't work. Never did.

1024
01:01:35,652 --> 01:01:36,653
Well, supposing it did,

1025
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,655
and if one were presenting
the invention to, say,

1026
01:01:38,739 --> 01:01:41,825
a board of directors
for a very large invention company,

1027
01:01:41,909 --> 01:01:43,577
where might one find the "On" switch?

1028
01:01:44,161 --> 01:01:45,746
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

1029
01:01:45,913 --> 01:01:48,082
All right, first, you turn this knob twice,

1030
01:01:48,165 --> 01:01:49,833
then push this red button,

1031
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:51,251
and that's it. It's pretty easy.

1032
01:01:51,418 --> 01:01:52,753
What a stupid way to turn it on!

1033
01:01:52,836 --> 01:01:54,922
Okay, take me to see my mom now.

1034
01:01:55,005 --> 01:01:56,423
Yes, of course.

1035
01:01:56,507 --> 01:01:57,758
Doris?

1036
01:02:00,594 --> 01:02:01,595
We had a deal!

1037
01:02:01,762 --> 01:02:03,597
Crossies! Doesn't count.

1038
01:02:03,764 --> 01:02:06,266
Why are you doing this to me?
I never did anything to you.

1039
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:08,352
You still haven't figured it out?

1040
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:09,853
Figured out what?

1041
01:02:09,937 --> 01:02:11,939
Well, let's see if this rings a bell.

1042
01:02:12,106 --> 01:02:14,441
Father of the Future,
inventor extraordinaire,

1043
01:02:14,608 --> 01:02:16,110
"Keep moving forward"?

1044
01:02:16,193 --> 01:02:18,696
That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.

1045
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:25,035
Are you saying

1046
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:27,538
that I'm Wilbur's dad?

1047
01:02:28,539 --> 01:02:30,290
Give the boy a prize.

1048
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:34,378
You grew up to be the founder
of this wretched time,

1049
01:02:34,545 --> 01:02:36,130
so I plan to destroy your destiny.

1050
01:02:36,296 --> 01:02:39,299
- Easy peasy, rice and cheesy.
- Well...

1051
01:02:39,883 --> 01:02:41,635
So if I'm Wilbur's dad...

1052
01:02:41,802 --> 01:02:42,803
Keep going.

1053
01:02:43,387 --> 01:02:45,139
If I'm Wilbur's dad...

1054
01:02:45,305 --> 01:02:46,974
Yes, thank you, we've established that.

1055
01:02:47,057 --> 01:02:49,727
But what does that have to do
with you?

1056
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:53,731
Allow me to shed some light
on the subject.

1057
01:02:56,734 --> 01:02:58,068
My old room!

1058
01:02:58,235 --> 01:03:00,571
I think you mean our old room.

1059
01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:03,741
- What?
- Yes! Yes, it is I,

1060
01:03:03,907 --> 01:03:05,159
Mike Yagoobian!

1061
01:03:05,909 --> 01:03:09,496
I know.
I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.

1062
01:03:09,663 --> 01:03:11,081
How did you end up like this?

1063
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:16,003
Well, it's a long and pitiful story
about a young boy with a dream,

1064
01:03:16,086 --> 01:03:18,756
a dream of winning
a Little League championship,

1065
01:03:22,092 --> 01:03:25,596
<i>a dream that was ruined
in the last inning.</i>

1066
01:03:26,013 --> 01:03:28,932
<i>We lost by one run because of me.</i>

1067
01:03:29,016 --> 01:03:30,100
Get him!

1068
01:03:30,267 --> 01:03:34,271
If I hadn't fallen asleep,
I would have caught the ball!

1069
01:03:34,438 --> 01:03:36,440
And we would have won!

1070
01:03:36,607 --> 01:03:38,108
Do you understand?

1071
01:03:38,275 --> 01:03:40,861
<i>For some reason,
no one wanted to adopt me.</i>

1072
01:03:41,028 --> 01:03:44,114
<i>Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson
graduates from college at age 14.</i>

1073
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:47,951
<i>This year's Nobel Prize goes
to a young Cornelius Robinson.</i>

1074
01:03:48,118 --> 01:03:49,703
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.

1075
01:03:49,787 --> 01:03:51,789
Hey, Goob,
wanna come over to my house today?

1076
01:03:51,872 --> 01:03:53,791
<i>They all hated me.</i>

1077
01:03:54,124 --> 01:03:57,461
<i>Eventually, they closed down
the orphanage and everyone left,</i>

1078
01:03:57,628 --> 01:03:59,213
<i>except me.</i>

1079
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,298
<i>Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.</i>

1080
01:04:01,382 --> 01:04:02,633
<i>- Robinson reaches out to...
- It's new name,</i>

1081
01:04:02,716 --> 01:04:04,718
<i>- Robinson Industries.
- Cornelius Robinson!</i>

1082
01:04:04,885 --> 01:04:07,971
<i>- Cornelius Robinson is now...
- Now here's another amazing...</i>

1083
01:04:08,055 --> 01:04:13,227
<i>It was then
that I realised it wasn't my fault.</i>

1084
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:14,728
<i>It was yours.</i>

1085
01:04:14,895 --> 01:04:18,065
<i>If you hadn't kept me up all night
working on your stupid project,</i>

1086
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:20,234
<i>then I wouldn't have missed the catch,</i>

1087
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:24,405
<i>so I devised a brilliant plan
to get my revenge.</i>

1088
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:29,910
Robinson, you stink!

1089
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:34,581
<i>Then, just as I was on the brink
of destroying Robinson Industries,</i>

1090
01:04:35,165 --> 01:04:37,501
<i>I met her.</i>

1091
01:04:40,671 --> 01:04:42,840
<i>We retreated to our villainous lair,</i>

1092
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:46,093
<i>where Doris spun a tale
of deception and woe.</i>

1093
01:04:46,176 --> 01:04:49,596
<i>Apparently, you invented her
to be a Helping Hat,</i>

1094
01:04:49,763 --> 01:04:51,932
<i>a slave to humankind,</i>

1095
01:04:55,936 --> 01:04:59,106
<i>but Doris knew she was capable
of so much more.</i>

1096
01:05:04,445 --> 01:05:07,197
<i>However, you didn't see
her true potential.</i>

1097
01:05:07,364 --> 01:05:09,366
<i>- Got it.
- So you shut her down,</i>

1098
01:05:15,956 --> 01:05:17,958
<i>or so you thought.</i>

1099
01:05:27,634 --> 01:05:29,803
<i>We both had a score
to settle with you,</i>

1100
01:05:30,554 --> 01:05:35,642
<i>and while my plan for revenge
was brilliant, Doris' was...</i>

1101
01:05:35,642 --> 01:05:37,561
<i>Well, we went with Doris',</i>

1102
01:05:37,728 --> 01:05:42,316
<i>but I made
a very, very important contribution.</i>

1103
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:44,902
<i>Together we made the perfect team.</i>

1104
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:56,080
Wilbur!

1105
01:05:56,163 --> 01:05:58,832
Make sure you shut that door tight,
or else the alarm won't engage.

1106
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:00,084
Yeah, Mom.

1107
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,173
<i>I went to your house,
snuck in the garage</i>

1108
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,092
<i>and stole the time machine,</i>

1109
01:06:11,095 --> 01:06:16,016
<i>all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid
who forgot to lock the garage door.</i>

1110
01:06:20,354 --> 01:06:23,440
And now all that's left
is to return to Inventco,

1111
01:06:23,524 --> 01:06:26,276
where I'll pass off
your little gizmo as my own.

1112
01:06:26,443 --> 01:06:28,779
But you have no idea
what that could do to this future!

1113
01:06:28,946 --> 01:06:32,032
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.

1114
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:33,784
Goob, I had no idea.

1115
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:35,786
Shut up! And don't call me Goob!

1116
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:38,622
How many evil villains do you know
who can pull off a name like Goob?

1117
01:06:39,206 --> 01:06:41,125
Look, I'm sorry
your life turned out so bad,

1118
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,293
but don't blame me.
You messed it up yourself.

1119
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:47,131
You just focused on the bad stuff
when all you had to do was

1120
01:06:47,297 --> 01:06:51,051
let go of the past
and keep moving forward.

1121
01:06:51,135 --> 01:06:52,219
Let's see.

1122
01:06:52,302 --> 01:06:55,222
Take responsibility for my own life
or blame you.

1123
01:06:56,557 --> 01:06:59,143
"Blame you" wins hands down!

1124
01:07:02,646 --> 01:07:05,899
This is gonna be
the best day of my life!

1125
01:07:13,907 --> 01:07:17,244
Doris, would you be a dear
and open the hatch for me, please?

1126
01:07:24,251 --> 01:07:25,586
No!

1127
01:07:27,004 --> 01:07:31,258
Well, I hate to foil your evil plan
and run, but ta-ta!

1128
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:35,095
But...

1129
01:07:35,179 --> 01:07:37,181
I bet you're glad to see me.

1130
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:40,434
That's for not locking the garage door.

1131
01:07:41,935 --> 01:07:43,103
You know about that?

1132
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:44,605
I know everything.

1133
01:07:44,688 --> 01:07:45,689
You gotta admit,

1134
01:07:45,856 --> 01:07:47,941
this will be a great story
to tell me someday.

1135
01:07:50,944 --> 01:07:53,447
Look at that, boys.
We're almost home free.

1136
01:08:02,456 --> 01:08:03,957
Oh, no!

1137
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:07,461
Take a good look around, boys,

1138
01:08:07,544 --> 01:08:10,297
because your future
is about to change.

1139
01:08:11,882 --> 01:08:14,468
Lewis, you have to fix
the time machine.

1140
01:08:14,551 --> 01:08:16,637
No. No, I can't.

1141
01:08:23,227 --> 01:08:25,479
What about your dad?
You could call him.

1142
01:08:25,729 --> 01:08:28,065
- You are my dad.
- But that's in the future.

1143
01:08:28,232 --> 01:08:30,901
There won't be a future
unless you fix the time machine.

1144
01:08:34,822 --> 01:08:36,073
<i>Look, I messed up.</i>

1145
01:08:36,323 --> 01:08:39,326
I left the garage unlocked,
and I've tried like crazy to fix things,

1146
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,494
but now it's up to you.

1147
01:08:42,579 --> 01:08:43,997
You can do it, Dad.

1148
01:08:45,332 --> 01:08:50,504
- Lewis? Lewis!
- Wilbur? Wilbur!

1149
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:55,676
Wilbur.

1150
01:08:55,926 --> 01:08:59,013
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?

1151
01:09:13,694 --> 01:09:15,779
<i>Prepare to be amazed.</i>

1152
01:09:15,946 --> 01:09:18,615
<i>I call it the Memory Scanner.</i>

1153
01:09:18,782 --> 01:09:22,202
<i>So, Yagoobian, any other ideas
you'd like to share with us?</i>

1154
01:09:22,369 --> 01:09:25,706
<i>Yes. I call them Helping Hats.</i>

1155
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,377
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

1156
01:09:32,713 --> 01:09:35,299
<i>Doris, what's happening?
I don't understand.</i>

1157
01:09:35,382 --> 01:09:38,218
<i>I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.</i>

1158
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:41,472
<i>No!</i>

1159
01:09:47,227 --> 01:09:50,731
No. No, this can't be happening! No!

1160
01:09:51,065 --> 01:09:54,234
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.

1161
01:11:53,687 --> 01:11:56,857
Why did I ever invent that stupid hat?

1162
01:12:07,534 --> 01:12:12,539
Take a good look around, Doris,
'cause your future's about to change.

1163
01:12:21,048 --> 01:12:22,549
Goob, stop!

1164
01:12:23,217 --> 01:12:24,301
You don't know what you're doing!

1165
01:12:24,468 --> 01:12:26,553
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.

1166
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:27,805
She's using you, Goob,

1167
01:12:27,888 --> 01:12:30,057
and when she gets what she wants,
she'll get rid of you.

1168
01:12:30,224 --> 01:12:31,975
What? What?

1169
01:12:37,314 --> 01:12:39,817
I am never going to invent you.

1170
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:48,575
Come on, Goob.
I've got to show you something.

1171
01:12:57,835 --> 01:12:59,002
Doris?

1172
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,171
I thought she was my friend.

1173
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:35,289
You did it, Lewis. You did it!

1174
01:13:38,042 --> 01:13:39,543
I'll hold him while you run for help.

1175
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:40,753
Let him go.

1176
01:13:41,128 --> 01:13:43,630
What are you doing? He's the bad guy.

1177
01:13:43,714 --> 01:13:46,383
No, he's not. He's my roommate.

1178
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:48,302
- What?
- He's my old roommate,

1179
01:13:48,469 --> 01:13:49,970
and I really think
you guys should adopt him.

1180
01:13:50,137 --> 01:13:52,306
- Are you nuts?
- Give me one good reason why not.

1181
01:13:52,473 --> 01:13:53,849
I'll give you three good reasons.

1182
01:13:53,974 --> 01:13:56,435
He stole our time machine,
tried to ruin your future,

1183
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,896
and he smells
like he hasn't showered in 30 years!

1184
01:13:59,229 --> 01:14:02,483
May I remind you, I'm your father,
and you have to do what I say.

1185
01:14:04,777 --> 01:14:07,905
Okay, Mr Yagoobian,
do you want to be a...

1186
01:14:08,072 --> 01:14:10,157
- Where'd he go?
- Goob?

1187
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:12,326
Goob!

1188
01:14:14,328 --> 01:14:15,579
Goob.

1189
01:14:43,107 --> 01:14:44,108
Are you hurt? Any broken bones?

1190
01:14:44,274 --> 01:14:45,859
- No, I'm...
- Do you have a temperature?

1191
01:14:45,984 --> 01:14:47,444
- Brain fog?
- Scurvy?

1192
01:14:47,528 --> 01:14:48,612
- Tapeworm?
- Cellulite?

1193
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:51,365
No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.

1194
01:14:51,532 --> 01:14:55,285
In fact,
better than I've felt in a long time.

1195
01:14:55,369 --> 01:14:58,622
Franny, they're gone.
Oh, this is terrible!

1196
01:14:58,789 --> 01:15:00,541
- Oh, boy.
- Well, he's home early.

1197
01:15:00,624 --> 01:15:04,169
Franny, where are you?
The time machines are gone!

1198
01:15:17,766 --> 01:15:19,560
Ratted out by the old lady.

1199
01:15:20,644 --> 01:15:21,812
Harsh.

1200
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:27,735
Okay.

1201
01:15:38,245 --> 01:15:41,415
Yeah, beats working
in an office every day.

1202
01:15:41,582 --> 01:15:43,375
Yeah, no kidding.

1203
01:15:43,584 --> 01:15:45,919
Hey!
Want to see the one I'm most proud of?

1204
01:15:46,086 --> 01:15:47,463
Yeah.

1205
01:15:50,257 --> 01:15:52,509
Oh, no, no, no. That one.

1206
01:16:06,273 --> 01:16:08,525
It was our first real invention.

1207
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:10,944
It's the one that started it all.

1208
01:16:11,111 --> 01:16:12,196
Wowie.

1209
01:16:13,197 --> 01:16:16,950
So if I go back now,
then this will be my future.

1210
01:16:17,034 --> 01:16:19,703
Well, that depends on you.

1211
01:16:19,828 --> 01:16:20,829
Nothing is set in stone.

1212
01:16:20,913 --> 01:16:24,708
You gotta make the right choices
and keep moving forward.

1213
01:16:28,712 --> 01:16:32,049
Since it's gonna work this time,
that means I...

1214
01:16:32,216 --> 01:16:36,470
We won't finally get to see
what Mom looks like?

1215
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:40,224
Do we ever meet her?

1216
01:16:43,477 --> 01:16:45,354
I think
you're just gonna have to get back

1217
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:48,232
to that science fair
and find out for yourself.

1218
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:50,567
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

1219
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:54,738
That's because we are one smart kid.

1220
01:16:59,743 --> 01:17:00,744
- So long!
- Bye-bye, Lewis!

1221
01:17:00,911 --> 01:17:03,414
- Farewell, future brother-in-law.
- So long! See you later, Lewis!

1222
01:17:03,497 --> 01:17:05,332
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!

1223
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:08,752
- Have a safe trip, little Lewis.
- I will.

1224
01:17:08,836 --> 01:17:10,587
Hey, while I got you here,

1225
01:17:10,754 --> 01:17:14,174
just a couple of little suggestions
regarding my design.

1226
01:17:14,258 --> 01:17:18,846
Let's face it, these skinny limbs
don't exactly make the teapot whistle.

1227
01:17:18,929 --> 01:17:21,932
All that really matters is,
hey, don't forget to invent me.

1228
01:17:22,099 --> 01:17:24,476
- Are you kidding? No way!
- I love you.

1229
01:17:25,686 --> 01:17:28,105
There's so many things
I wish I could ask you.

1230
01:17:28,272 --> 01:17:30,858
Excuse me.
Time travel now, questions later.

1231
01:17:31,025 --> 01:17:32,026
- But I...
- Don't worry.

1232
01:17:32,109 --> 01:17:34,945
Just get back to that science fair,
and we'll see you real soon.

1233
01:17:35,112 --> 01:17:38,490
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.

1234
01:17:38,574 --> 01:17:41,160
- Goodbye, son.
- Thanks again for everything!

1235
01:17:41,285 --> 01:17:43,746
- Wait. Lewis, one more thing.
- Yeah?

1236
01:17:43,871 --> 01:17:48,792
Just a little tip for the future.
I am always right.

1237
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:51,795
Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

1238
01:17:53,881 --> 01:17:57,134
She's right.
I'd just go with it if I were you.

1239
01:17:58,052 --> 01:17:59,345
And I am.

1240
01:18:00,137 --> 01:18:01,889
Then you're absolutely right.

1241
01:18:04,475 --> 01:18:06,310
All right, I'm coming.

1242
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,729
Well, it's not like
you're never gonna see them again.

1243
01:18:08,812 --> 01:18:10,647
They are your family, after all.

1244
01:18:40,511 --> 01:18:41,512
Wait a minute.

1245
01:18:41,637 --> 01:18:43,722
You're supposed to take me back
to the science fair.

1246
01:18:43,847 --> 01:18:45,015
I know.

1247
01:18:50,604 --> 01:18:53,357
Well, I think
you punched in the wrong numbers.

1248
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,110
We agreed that,
if you fixed the time machine,

1249
01:18:56,235 --> 01:18:58,112
I'd take you back to see your mom.

1250
01:18:58,195 --> 01:18:59,363
What?

1251
01:19:17,965 --> 01:19:19,383
A deal's a deal.

1252
01:21:22,715 --> 01:21:25,592
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?

1253
01:21:26,385 --> 01:21:29,513
Because I already have a family.

1254
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:42,359
I never thought my dad
would be my best friend.

1255
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,529
Now, now, don't make me come
and bail you out again.

1256
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:48,323
I won't.

1257
01:21:48,449 --> 01:21:50,409
Remember, I've got a time machine.

1258
01:21:50,534 --> 01:21:52,036
If you mess up again,
I'll just keep coming back

1259
01:21:52,202 --> 01:21:53,370
till you get it right.

1260
01:21:55,581 --> 01:21:57,207
- You got that motto?
- I got it.

1261
01:21:57,374 --> 01:21:58,625
Don't forget it.

1262
01:21:58,709 --> 01:22:00,544
I don't think that's possible.

1263
01:22:01,962 --> 01:22:03,213
You better get going.

1264
01:22:03,964 --> 01:22:05,507
See you later, Wilbur.

1265
01:22:23,901 --> 01:22:25,486
Wait a minute!

1266
01:22:34,078 --> 01:22:36,080
Goob! Goob, wake up!

1267
01:22:36,205 --> 01:22:37,247
What?

1268
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:41,502
That's it!

1269
01:22:49,593 --> 01:22:52,388
Mr Willerstein,
I know what went wrong.

1270
01:22:52,513 --> 01:22:54,765
Can I have one more chance? Please!

1271
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:59,687
My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.

1272
01:23:01,271 --> 01:23:02,940
I need a volunteer.

1273
01:23:06,276 --> 01:23:07,945
Now, just give me a date to input.

1274
01:23:08,028 --> 01:23:09,446
Well, now, let's see.

1275
01:23:09,613 --> 01:23:12,741
There's my first science fair,
the day I got my first microscope,

1276
01:23:12,866 --> 01:23:15,953
the time I swam the English Channel,
my first gold medal for the luge.

1277
01:23:17,121 --> 01:23:18,288
I know.

1278
01:23:19,456 --> 01:23:20,708
Perfect!

1279
01:23:33,095 --> 01:23:36,140
<i>- You look gorgeous.
- He's a lucky guy.</i>

1280
01:23:38,225 --> 01:23:39,977
Oh! It works.

1281
01:23:40,144 --> 01:23:42,563
- It works!
- It works.

1282
01:23:43,147 --> 01:23:45,399
<i>You look beautiful, Lucille.</i>

1283
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:51,822
Bud?

1284
01:23:53,157 --> 01:23:55,075
- Would you look at that?
- Whoa!

1285
01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:56,994
Honey! Honey, you're just in time.

1286
01:23:57,077 --> 01:23:59,997
- Lucille!
- You did it, Lewis! You did it!

1287
01:24:00,122 --> 01:24:01,498
This invention is brilliant!

1288
01:24:01,582 --> 01:24:03,083
Kid, you're this fair's MVP!

1289
01:24:03,167 --> 01:24:05,336
That was some show you put on.

1290
01:24:05,419 --> 01:24:08,922
You're a real special kid,

1291
01:24:11,675 --> 01:24:14,928
but you don't look like a Lewis.
You look more like a...

1292
01:24:15,012 --> 01:24:17,765
Cornelius. I get that a lot.

1293
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:21,352
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.

1294
01:24:21,435 --> 01:24:22,853
No harm done.

1295
01:24:23,687 --> 01:24:26,023
Frankie, what have I told you
about running away?

1296
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,525
- Frankie?
- My star pupil.

1297
01:24:28,609 --> 01:24:33,530
My name's Franny,
and I teach frogs music.

1298
01:24:33,614 --> 01:24:34,782
Really?

1299
01:24:35,657 --> 01:24:38,619
You know that frogs
have more musical ability than people?

1300
01:24:38,744 --> 01:24:41,121
But nobody believes me.

1301
01:24:41,955 --> 01:24:44,041
They all think I'm crazy.

1302
01:24:45,376 --> 01:24:48,170
You think I'm crazy, too.

1303
01:24:48,295 --> 01:24:51,298
No. No, I think you're right.

1304
01:24:54,802 --> 01:24:56,637
Over here? There he is.

1305
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,973
Kid, we'd like to get a story
on you for the local paper.

1306
01:25:00,099 --> 01:25:02,685
You've got a bright future ahead of you.

1307
01:25:05,813 --> 01:25:07,064
<i>Let it go</i>

1308
01:25:07,147 --> 01:25:08,232
Yeah.

1309
01:25:08,649 --> 01:25:11,610
<i>Let it roll right off your shoulder</i>

1310
01:25:11,735 --> 01:25:13,195
<i>Don't you know</i>

1311
01:25:14,905 --> 01:25:17,408
<i>The hardest part is over</i>

1312
01:25:17,574 --> 01:25:19,159
<i>Let it in</i>

1313
01:25:20,244 --> 01:25:23,080
<i>Let your clarity define you</i>

1314
01:25:23,163 --> 01:25:24,748
<i>In the end</i>

1315
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,254
<i>We will only just remember
How it feels</i>

1316
01:25:40,014 --> 01:25:42,016
<i>Let it slide</i>

1317
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:46,020
<i>Let your troubles fall behind you</i>

1318
01:25:46,103 --> 01:25:47,938
<i>Let it shine</i>

1319
01:25:48,939 --> 01:25:51,608
<i>Until you feel it all around you</i>

1320
01:25:51,734 --> 01:25:54,403
<i>And I don't mind</i>

1321
01:25:54,528 --> 01:25:57,364
<i>If it's me you need to turn to</i>

1322
01:25:57,489 --> 01:25:59,783
<i>We'll get by</i>

1323
01:26:00,367 --> 01:26:04,788
<i>It's the heart that really matters
In the end</i>

1324
01:26:05,331 --> 01:26:07,916
<i>Our lives are made</i>

1325
01:26:08,042 --> 01:26:10,711
<i>In these small hours</i>

1326
01:26:11,045 --> 01:26:13,464
<i>These little wonders</i>

1327
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:16,467
<i>These twists and turns of fate</i>

1328
01:26:16,759 --> 01:26:19,136
<i>Time falls away</i>

1329
01:26:19,219 --> 01:26:22,473
<i>But these small hours</i>

1330
01:26:22,556 --> 01:26:27,895
<i>These small hours still remain</i>

1331
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:30,647
<i>All of my regret</i>

1332
01:26:30,731 --> 01:26:33,567
<i>Will wash away somehow</i>

1333
01:26:33,817 --> 01:26:36,320
<i>But I cannot forget</i>

1334
01:26:36,487 --> 01:26:39,740
<i>The way I feel right now</i>

1335
01:27:03,931 --> 01:27:05,599
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1336
01:27:06,934 --> 01:27:08,936
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1337
01:27:10,187 --> 01:27:12,106
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1338
01:27:13,524 --> 01:27:15,776
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1339
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,625
<i>The future's arrived</i>

1340
01:27:31,709 --> 01:27:33,293
<i>Nobody can doubt</i>

1341
01:27:33,419 --> 01:27:36,505
<i>The future is what everything's about</i>

1342
01:27:36,588 --> 01:27:39,383
<i>It's better for you
And it's better for me</i>

1343
01:27:39,883 --> 01:27:42,886
<i>It's better than what everybody
Thought it would be</i>

1344
01:27:43,053 --> 01:27:44,972
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1345
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:49,101
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

1346
01:27:49,727 --> 01:27:51,311
<i>The future's alive</i>

1347
01:27:51,478 --> 01:27:52,980
<i>Alive as can be</i>

1348
01:27:53,063 --> 01:27:54,481
<i>Just open your eyes</i>

1349
01:27:54,565 --> 01:27:56,233
<i>It's plain to see</i>

1350
01:27:56,358 --> 01:27:57,818
<i>Just don't be afraid</i>

1351
01:27:57,901 --> 01:27:59,737
<i>Just keep going on</i>

1352
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:02,614
<i>One step at a time
And you can't go wrong</i>

1353
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,325
<i>It's time to create</i>

1354
01:28:05,409 --> 01:28:07,411
<i>Time to grow</i>

1355
01:28:07,578 --> 01:28:09,079
<i>If you feel right</i>

1356
01:28:09,163 --> 01:28:12,458
<i>The world, yeah
She's changing</i>

1357
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:15,169
<i>Don't it make you feel alive?</i>

1358
01:28:16,211 --> 01:28:17,838
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1359
01:28:19,298 --> 01:28:21,884
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

1360
01:28:22,843 --> 01:28:24,345
<i>The future's alive</i>

1361
01:28:25,929 --> 01:28:28,599
<i>The future is alive today</i>

1362
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:39,193
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1363
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,237
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1364
01:28:42,363 --> 01:28:43,947
<i>The future's arrived</i>

1365
01:28:44,031 --> 01:28:45,532
<i>Nobody can doubt</i>

1366
01:28:45,699 --> 01:28:48,994
<i>The future is what everything's about</i>

1367
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:52,122
<i>It's better for you
It's better for me</i>

1368
01:28:52,289 --> 01:28:55,125
<i>It's better than what everybody
Thought it would be</i>

1369
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,961
<i>It's time to create</i>

1370
01:28:58,128 --> 01:28:59,630
<i>Time to grow</i>

1371
01:28:59,963 --> 01:29:01,799
<i>If you feel right</i>

1372
01:29:01,965 --> 01:29:05,052
<i>The world, yeah
