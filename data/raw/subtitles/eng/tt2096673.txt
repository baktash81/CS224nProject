00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:51,321
<i>Do you ever look at someone and wonder,</i>

3
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:54,189
<i>what is going on inside their head?</i>

4
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:55,903
<i>Well, I know.</i>

5
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:58,542
<i>Hey, well, I know Riley's head.</i>

6
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:35,456
Hm?

7
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:45,336
<i>And there she was.</i>

8
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:48,283
Hello.

9
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,286
- Riley

- Woh, look at you!

10
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:55,708
Aren't you a little bundle of joy!

11
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,244
<i>Aren't you a little bundle of joy!</i>

12
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:10,524
Woh!

13
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:31,696
<i>It was amazing!
Just Riley and me...</i>

14
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:34,241
<i>forever.</i>

15
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:42,428
<i>Or for... 33 seconds.</i>

16
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:45,496
I'm Sadness.

17
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:49,412
Oh, hello, I'm Joy. So...☻

18
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:51,060
Can I just, if you could...

19
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,478
I just wanna me fix that.
Thanks.

20
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,328
<i>And that was just the beginning.</i>

21
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:58,498
<i>Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.</i>

22
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:00,972
Very nice.

23
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,071
OK, looks like you got this.
Very good.

24
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,812
Oh, sharp turn!
No, look Out!

25
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:08,457
<i>That's Fear. He's really good
at keeping Riley safe.</i>

26
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,457
Easy, easy... Fall back!

27
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:12,809
Oh, we're good.
We're good!

28
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,638
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Oo, good job! - And we're back!

29
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:18,746
Woh.

30
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,302
Here we go. Alright, open.

31
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,195
- Hm, this looks new.
- Think it's safe? - What is it?

32
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:29,132
OK, caution! There is a dangerous
smell people. Hold on. What is that?

33
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:30,250
<i>This is Disgust.</i>

34
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,813
<i>She basically keeps Riley
from being poisoned,</i>

35
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,152
<i>physically and socially.</i>

36
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:35,745
That is not brightly colored,

37
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,153
or shaped like a dinosaur.
Hold on guys... It's broccoli!

38
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:40,666
Yuck!

39
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,510
Well. I just saved our lives...
Yeah, you're welcome.

40
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,473
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not going to get any dessert.

41
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,887
Wait, did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

42
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:50,997
<i>That's Anger,</i>

43
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:54,083
<i>he cares very deeply
about things being fair.</i>

44
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,398
So, that's how you
want to play it, old man?

45
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:59,337
No dessert? Oh, sure,
we'll eat our dinner.

46
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:01,379
Right after you eat this!

47
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:02,747
Arh!

48
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:04,395
Aaahh!

49
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:08,033
Riley, Riley.
Here comes an airplane.

50
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,793
Aaahh... Oh, airplane!

51
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,186
We got an airplane, everybody.
- Ooh! - Ooh!

52
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:22,949
<i>And you've met Sadness.</i>

53
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:24,739
<i>She... Well, she...

54
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:25,888
Waah!

55
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:27,028
Waah!

56
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:28,348
Waah-haah!

57
00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:31,143
<i>I'm not actually
sure what she does.</i>

58
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:32,251
<i>And I've checked,</i>

59
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:36,699
<i>there's no place for her to go, so...
She's good. We're good. It's all great.</i>

60
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:38,800
<i>Anyway, these are Riley's memories.</i>

61
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:42,118
<i>And they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.</i>

62
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:49,148
<i>But the really important
ones are over here.</i>

63
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,400
<i>I don't want to get too
technical but these are called</i>

64
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:52,951
<i>core memories.</i>

65
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:56,496
<i>Each one came from a super
important time in Riley's life.</i>

66
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:59,763
<i>Like when she first scored a goal.
It was so amazing!</i>

67
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:01,529
Hey, would you look at that!

68
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,226
Very nice!

69
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,789
- Woo-hoo!
- Yayy!

70
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:17,910
<i>And each core memory</i>

71
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,015
<i>powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.</i>

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,326
<i>Like, Hockey Island.</i>

73
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,043
<i>Goofball Island
is my personal favorite.</i>

74
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,978
Come back here,
you little monkey!

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,271
<i>Yup, Goofball is the best!</i>

76
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,238
<i>Friendship Island
is pretty good too.</i>

77
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,180
<i>Oh, I love Honesty Island.</i>

78
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,816
<i>And that's the truth.</i>

79
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,234
<i>And of course,
Family Island is amazing.</i>

80
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,047
- I have your present.
- Oh...

81
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:50,659
<i>The point is, the
islands of personality</i>

82
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:52,933
<i>are what make Riley, Riley.</i>

83
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,516
Look out, Blue fish!

84
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:03,502
Lava! Hoo!

85
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:08,791
♪ <i>Who's your friend that likes to play?
Bing Bong. Bing Bong.</i>

86
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:11,057
Hey, very nice!

87
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:16,760
- Agh.
- Brain freeze!

88
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:18,233
- Agh!
- Aah!

89
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,955
Aahh!

90
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,233
- Yeah!
- Yayy!

91
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,376
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, Dad.

92
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,392
And...

93
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,091
We're out.

94
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:42,240
That's what I'm talking about.
Woo! Another perfect day.

95
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:43,513
Nice job everybody.

96
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:46,419
Let's get those memories
down to long term.

97
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:52,117
Alright! We did not die today!

98
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,919
I call that an
unqualified success.

99
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:12,110
<i>And, that's it.
We love our girl!

100
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:14,707
<i>And she's got great friends
and a great house.

101
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:16,683
<i>Things couldn't be better.

102
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:19,351
<i>After all, Riley's 11 now.

103
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:21,288
<i>What could happen?</i>

104
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:23,568
- What?
- Aahh!

105
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:25,621
- Huh!
- Aahh!

106
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,270
OK, not what I had in mind.

107
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,812
Aahh!

108
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:57,830
<i>Hey, look, the Golden Gate Bridge!
Isn't that great?

109
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:00,269
<i>It's not made up of solid gold
like we thought,

110
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,503
<i>which is kind of
disappointing, but still...

111
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,999
<i>I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.</i>

112
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:07,430
Otherwise I'd be terrified
right now.

113
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,712
Ah... yeah.

114
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:13,556
These are my kind of people.

115
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,218
<i>Alright, just a few more blocks.</i>

116
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:17,576
<i>- We're almost to our new house.</i>
- Step on it, Daddy.

117
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:20,742
Why don't we just live in the smelly car?
We're already been in it forever!

118
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,560
Which... actually was really lucky,

119
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,210
because that gave
us plenty of time

120
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,748
to think about what our new
house is going to look like.

121
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,364
What? Let's review
the top 5 daydreams.

122
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,294
- Woo, that looks safe!
- That looks nice.

123
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:33,876
Ooh, this'll be great for Riley.
Oh, no, no... this one!

124
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:36,169
Joy for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

125
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:39,214
That's the one,
it comes with a dragon.

126
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:42,153
<i>We're getting close,
I can feel it.</i>

127
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:45,031
<i>Here it is.
Here's our new house.</i>

128
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,691
<i>And...</i>

129
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:55,025
Maybe, it's nice on the inside.

130
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:01,647
<i>- We're suppose to live here?
- Do we have to?</i>

131
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:03,901
<i>I'm telling you, it smells
like something died in here.</i>

132
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:06,530
<i>- Can you die from moving?</i>
- Guys, you're overreacting.

133
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:08,930
- Nobody is dying.
- A dead mouse!

134
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:10,830
<i>- Great! - I'm gonna be sick.
- It's a house of the dead,</i>

135
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:12,422
<i>what're we gonna do?</i>
We're gonna get rabies!

136
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,813
- Get offa me!
- Waahh!

137
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,422
Hey, hey,
all through the drive,

138
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,499
Dad talked about how cool
our new room is.

139
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:19,547
- Let's go check it out.
<i>- It's gonna be great!</i>

140
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:20,557
<i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>

141
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:23,387
<i>- No, no, no...
- I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.</i>

142
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:25,838
<i>Get out the rubber ball.
We're in solitary confinement.</i>

143
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:28,170
- Riley can't live here.
- She's right, it's really bad.</i>

144
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:30,233
<i>- It's absolutely the worst.
- This house stinks.</i>

145
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:32,302
<i>It's the worst place I've been
in my entire life. - Oh, yeah.</i>

146
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,833
Hey, it's nothing our
butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

147
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,202
I read somewhere that an
empty room is an opportunity.

148
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:39,554
- Where 'd you read that?
- It doesn't matter. I read it and it's great.

149
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:42,000
We'll put the bed there.
<i>And the desk over there.</i>

150
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:43,470
<i>The hockey lamp goes there.</i>

151
00:09:43,537 --> 00:09:46,151
<i>- Put the chair there.
- Oh, the trophy collections.</i>

152
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:47,073
<i>Stars!</i>

153
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:49,110
<i>- I like that.
- Now, we're talking!</i>

154
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,406
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van.

155
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:53,665
<i>Alright. Goodbye.
Well, guess what?</i>

156
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:55,685
The moving van won't be here
until Thursday.

157
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,005
You're kidding.

158
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,370
- Our van is lost?
- It's the worst day ever.

159
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:03,616
- You said it would be here yesterday.
- I know that's what I said.

160
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:05,444
- That's what they told me.
<i>- Mom and Dad are stressed out.</i>

161
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,642
<i>They're stressed out.
What're we gonna do?</i>

162
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,367
- What is their problem?
- I've got a great idea!

163
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,575
<i>Did you even read the contract?</i>

164
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,045
Anderson makes her move.
She's closing in.

165
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,303
Hey! Oh no, you're not.

166
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,016
- She's lining up her shot.
- Coming behind you, watch out.

167
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:21,993
And she scores! Yeah!

168
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:23,974
- Woo-hoo!
- Yo-ho!

169
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,016
Come on, Grandmother!

170
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,302
Grandma?!

171
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:30,245
Oh-oh, she put her hair up.
We're in for it.

172
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:32,951
Heyyy, put me down!

173
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:38,771
Ah... Sorry, hold on.

174
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,670
- Hello.
- Wait, wha...?

175
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:43,489
<i>You're kidding me!</i>

176
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:46,830
<i>Alright, stall for me,
I'll be right there.</i>

177
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:49,941
<i>The investor's supposed to
show up on Thursday, not today.</i>

178
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,650
- I gotta go.
- It's OK, we get it.

179
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:56,083
You're the best, thanks, hon.
See you, sweetie.

180
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,222
<i>Dad just left us.</i>

181
00:10:58,247 --> 00:11:01,296
Oh, he doesn't love us anymore.
That's sad.

182
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:03,190
I should drive, right?

183
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:06,361
Joy, what are you doing?

184
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:08,641
Ah, just give me one second.

185
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,830
You know what I've realised?
Riley hasn't had lunch.

186
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:13,140
Remember?

187
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:17,629
Hey, I saw a pizza
place down the street,

188
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:18,958
maybe we can try that.

189
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:20,559
-Pizza sounds delicious.
- Pizza?

190
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:23,126
Yeah, let's go for pizza.
Great, let's get it.

191
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:26,860
<i>- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza?</i>

192
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:28,054
That's it, I'm done.

193
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,432
Congratulations San Francisco,
you've ruined pizza!

194
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:34,548
First the Hawaiians and now you!

195
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,034
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

196
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,436
<i>Must be a San Francisco thing.</i>

197
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:43,656
Still, it's not as bad as the soup
at that diner in Nebraska.

198
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:47,327
Oh, yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself.

199
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:50,670
<i>We're good.
Family's running.</i>

200
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:54,306
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?
What was your favorite part?

201
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,848
Spitting out of the car window.

202
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:58,499
- Definitely not when Dad was singing.
- Wearing the seat belt.

203
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:00,933
Oh, what about the time
with the dinosaur?

204
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,459
- Oh, that's the one!
<i>- For sure. - Say cheese.</i>

205
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:04,636
<i>- Dad.
- Honey.</i>

206
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,490
<i>Dad, Dad, Dad, look at the car.
Just look behind you.</i>

207
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,197
<i>No-no-no...</i>

208
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:10,803
<i>Ohh!</i>

209
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,056
Nice one, Joy.

210
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,616
I like that time with the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

211
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:24,795
Wait, what.
What happened?

212
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:28,203
She did something to the memory.

213
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:30,705
- What did you do?
- I, I just touched it.

214
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:32,752
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Oh, change it back, Joy.

215
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,021
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

216
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,103
- No, I guess I can't.
- Good going, Sadness!

217
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:38,424
Now when Riley thinks of
that moment with Dad,

218
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:39,841
she's gonna feel sad. Bravo!

219
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,088
I'm sorry, Joy.
I don't really know...

220
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:45,225
I thought maybe if you,
if you, I mean...

221
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:48,159
Joy, we got a stairway
coming up.

222
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:52,645
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figured out what's going on.

223
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,591
- OK.
- Alright. Get ready.

224
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:56,369
This is a monster railing

225
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:59,080
and we are riding it
all the way down.

226
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:07,827
Wait, what... What happened?

227
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:11,036
- A core memory!
- Oh no!

228
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:16,074
- Sadness, what're you doing?
- It looked like one was crooked,

229
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,860
so I opened it
and then it fell out!

230
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,754
Woo-hoo!

231
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,920
It's just that, I wanted to,
maybe, hold one.

232
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:30,255
- Woah! Joy!
- Woah, Woah, Woah!

233
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:33,598
Sadness, you nearly
touched a core memory!

234
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:35,863
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

235
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:39,033
I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

236
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:41,128
It's like I'm having a break down.

237
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:43,384
You're not having a break down.
It's stress.

238
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,137
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

239
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,257
- No, you're not!
- And annoying.

240
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:50,297
The... well...
You know what?

241
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:52,317
You can't focus on
what's going wrong.

242
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,109
There's always a way
to turn things around

243
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,513
To find the fun.

244
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:59,224
Yeah, find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

245
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:02,857
OK, well...
Try to think of something funny.

246
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:06,538
Oh. Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

247
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,547
Oh, yeah... That's not...

248
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:10,360
What about that time, with Meg?

249
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:14,982
When Riley laughed so hard,
milk came out of her nose.

250
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:16,569
Come on!

251
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:20,130
Yeah, that hurt, it felt like fire.
It was...

252
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:23,224
OK, OK. Don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

253
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:26,578
- What are your favorite things to do?
- My favorite?

254
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:28,388
Well, I like it
when we're outside.

255
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:31,624
That's good! Like, there's
the beach and sunshine.

256
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,901
Oh, like the time we buried
Dad in the sand up to his neck.

257
00:14:34,926 --> 00:14:37,528
<i>I was thinking more like rain.</i>

258
00:14:38,307 --> 00:14:41,480
Rain Rain is my favorite too!

259
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,262
We can stomp around the puddles

260
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,633
<i>You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.</i>

261
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,965
<i>More like when the rain
runs down our back,</i>

262
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,826
<i>and makes our shoes soggy.</i>

263
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:53,529
<i>And we get all cold, shivery and</i>

264
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:56,477
everything starts
feeling droopy.

265
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,756
Oh, hey, hey! Easy.

266
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:01,191
Why are you crying?

267
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:04,597
Th-this is really the opposite
of what we're going for, here.

268
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:06,592
Crying helps me slow down

269
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:09,780
and obsess over the weight
of life's problems.

270
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,890
You know what?
Let's think about something else.

271
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:15,396
How about we read
some mind manuals.

272
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:16,641
Huh? Sounds fun!

273
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,040
I've read most of them.

274
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:19,989
Have you read this one.
This seem interesting.

275
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:23,253
Long term memory retrieval.
Volume 47.

276
00:15:23,307 --> 00:15:25,659
- No.
- Ooh, a real page turner!

277
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:29,771
Long term memory data selection
via channel subgroup B.

278
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:32,050
See? Fun already!
Oh, you lucky dog.

279
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:36,995
You're reading these cool things;
I gotta go work. Life is so unfair.

280
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:44,293
Ugh!

281
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,988
<i>What can we do? We only got
capital to last a month maybe two.</i>

282
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:52,450
<i>If we can't find investors by then,
we're gonna have to lay people off.</3i>

283
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:55,700
Mom, Dad,
come kiss me good night!

284
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:59,772
<i>-I know. We got to land this, OK
- Be right there!</i>

285
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:04,959
Did you hear Dad?
He sounded really upset.

286
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:09,105
What was that? Was it a bear?
It's a bear!

287
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,765
There are no bears
in San Francisco.

288
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,889
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

289
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:15,093
Oh. I'm so jumpy,
my nerves are shot!

290
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:16,770
Ew, I don't wanna
hear about your nerves!

291
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:19,467
I'll tell you what it is.
This move has been a bust.

292
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,089
<i>That's what I've been
telling you guys.</i>

293
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,468
There're at least 37 things for
Riley to be scared of right now.

294
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:25,180
This smell alone is enough
to make her gag.

295
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:27,113
I can't believe Mom and
Dad moved us here.

296
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:29,566
Look, I get it.
You guys have concerns.

297
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,026
But we've been through worse.

298
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:32,061
Tell you what.

299
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:35,015
Let's make a list of all the things
Riley should be happy about.

300
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:37,607
Fine. Let's see,
this house stinks, our room stinks.

301
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,666
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

302
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:41,906
And all our stuff
is in the missing van.

303
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,387
Oh, come on,
it could be worse.

304
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:46,956
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on the dirty floor, in a bag.

305
00:16:46,981 --> 00:16:49,075
OK, I admit it.
We had a rough start.

306
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,115
- But think of all the good things...
- No, Joy.

307
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,381
There is absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

308
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:55,398
Let us handle this.

309
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:58,029
I say we skip school tomorrow and
lock ourselves in the bedroom.

310
00:16:58,054 --> 00:16:59,734
We have no clean clothes
no one should see us.

311
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,541
And we could cry until
we can't breathe.

312
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:04,320
We should lock the doors and
scream the curse word we know.

313
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:06,255
- It's a good one.
- Now, hold on!

314
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,233
Look, we all have our off days,
you know...

315
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:10,294
Hi honey.

316
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,341
The Mom-bad-news train
is pulling in. Toot-toot!

317
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,395
Still no moving van, huh!

318
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,089
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday. Can you believe it?

319
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:20,356
Toot-toot-toot!

320
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:22,441
- Where's Dad?
- On the phone.

321
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:24,409
This new venture is
keeping him pretty busy.

322
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,340
I rest my case!

323
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:29,925
<i>Your dad's a little stressed
about getting his new company up and running...</i>

324
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,552
Now, for a few well placed
withering scowls.

325
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,403
I guess all I really
want to say is...

326
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,106
- Thank you.
- Huh?

327
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:42,224
You know, through all this
confusion, you've stayed...

328
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,145
Well, you've stayed our happy girl.

329
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,511
Your Dad's under
a lot of pressure.

330
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:50,075
But, if you and I
can keep smiling,

331
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:51,837
it would be a big help.

332
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,797
We can do that for him, right?

333
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:56,820
Woh!

334
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:58,676
Well.

335
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:01,727
Yeah. Sure.

336
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:04,452
What did we do
to deserve you!

337
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,968
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

338
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,369
Well, you can't argue with Mom.

339
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:13,553
- Happy it is!
- Can't argue, that's true.

340
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:16,237
- Team Happy. Sounds great.
- Totally behind you, Joy.

341
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:18,757
Looks like we're going
into R.E.M.

342
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:21,793
I got dream duty so I'll take care
of sending these to long term.

343
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:26,308
Great day today, guys.
All is well, team Happy.

344
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:30,412
Alright, what's on tonight,
dream production?

345
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:38,045
Well, this is it.
The new place.

346
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:43,224
Come live with me, Riley... Eurk!

347
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:47,787
- Somebody ordered a broccoli pizza.
- Eat me, I'm organic.

348
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:52,017
Oh no! Who is in charge of
programming down there?

349
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:55,186
I know I'm not
supposed to do this, but...

350
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:02,301
We are not going to end
the day like this.

351
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:46,685
Don't you worry.

352
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,286
I'm going to make sure

353
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,942
that tomorrow is another
great day.

354
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:52,965
I promise.

355
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:07,857
- Hello, did I wake you?
- Do you have to play that?

356
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,180
Well, I have to practice.

357
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:12,636
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

358
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:15,476
OK, first day of school.
Very, very exciting.

359
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:18,077
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

360
00:20:18,102 --> 00:20:19,546
- Here it is: Fear!
- Huh?

361
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,693
I need a list of all the
possible negative outcomes

362
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:22,998
on the first day
at a new school.

363
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,602
Way ahead of you there.
Does anyone know how to spell meteor?

364
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:27,662
Disgust, make sure Riley
stands out today.

365
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:28,789
But, also blends in.

366
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:30,770
When I'm through, Riley will
look so good,

367
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:33,019
the other kids will look at
their own outfits and fart.

368
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:35,646
Joy! Yes, Joy.
You'll be in charge of the console.

369
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:37,093
Keeping Riley happy
all day long.

370
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,823
And may I add, I love your dress,
it's adorable.

371
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:42,242
Oh, this old thing. Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls.

372
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,140
Train of Thought,
right on schedule.

373
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:48,573
Anger, unload the daydreams.

374
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:50,847
I ordered extra, in case
things get slow in class.

375
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:51,973
Might come in handy.

376
00:20:51,998 --> 00:20:54,346
If this new school is full
of boring, useless classes.

377
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:55,849
Which it probably will be.

378
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,629
Oh, Sadness. I have a super
important job just for you.

379
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,990
- Really.
- M-hm, follow me.

380
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,352
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect.

381
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,472
This is the circle of sadness.

382
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:10,504
Your job is to make sure that

383
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:13,064
all the sadness
stays inside of it.

384
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:15,727
So, you want me
just to stand here?

385
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,558
Hey, it's not my
place to tell you

386
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:18,721
how to do your job.

387
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:20,085
Just make sure that

388
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:23,603
all... the sadness
stays in the circle.

389
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:25,539
See? You're a pro at this!

390
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:26,789
Isn't this fun?

391
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:27,991
- No.
- Atta girl.

392
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:29,389
Alright everyone, fresh start.

393
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,454
We're going to have a good day
which will turn into a good week,

394
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:34,149
which will turn into a good year,
which turns into a good life!

395
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,246
So, big day.
New school. New friends.

396
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,652
I know. I'm kind of nervous
but I'm mostly excited.

397
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:42,736
<i>- How do I look? Do you like my tote?
- Very cute!</i>

398
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,694
You gonna be OK.
You want us to walk with you?

399
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:47,297
Mom and Dad, with us in public?!
No, thank you.

400
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:48,370
Yup, I'm on it.

401
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:50,788
Nope, I'm fine.
Bye Mom. Bye Dad.

402
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:52,294
Have a good day in school, monkey.

403
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,199
- Oo-oo... - Woo-oo!...
- Oo... woo...

404
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,877
Have a great day, sweetheart.

405
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,889
<i>- Are you sure we want to do this?
- In we go!</i>

406
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:10,696
<i>OK, going in. Yes!</i>

407
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:17,640
<i>OK. We've got a group of
cool girls at 2 o'clock.</i>

408
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:20,317
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierced, infinity scarf.

409
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:23,030
<i>- Woh! Is she wearing eye shadow?</i>
- Yeah, we want to be friends with them.

410
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:24,487
- Let's go talk to them.
- Are you kidding?!

411
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,227
We're not talking to them!
We want them to like us.

412
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:28,520
Oh, yeah! Wait...  What?

413
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:30,627
Almost finished with
the potential disasters.

414
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:34,173
Worst scenario is either quicksand,
spontaneous combustion,

415
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:37,147
or getting called on by the teacher.
As long as none of this happens...

416
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:39,942
OK, everybody, we have a new
student in class today.

417
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:43,383
Are you kidding me?! Out of the gate!
This is not happening!

418
00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:46,016
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

419
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,396
Noooo!
Pretend we can't speak English.

420
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,453
Don't worry, I got this.

421
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:52,758
OK.

422
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:54,521
My name is Riley Anderson.

423
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:58,347
I'm from Minnesota
and now I live here.

424
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:02,219
<i>And how about Minnesota?</i>

425
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:03,663
Can you tell us something about it?

426
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:06,659
Well you certainly get
a lot more snow than we do.

427
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:10,398
Ha-ha-ha! She's hilarious.

428
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:13,124
Yeah, it get's pretty cold.

429
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:15,635
The lake freezes over and
that’s when we play hockey.

430
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,068
I'm on a great team.
We're called the Prairie Dogs.

431
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:21,403
My friend, Meg,<i> plays forward
and my dad's the coach.</i>

432
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:23,919
<i>Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.</i>

433
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,414
<i>It's kind of a family tradition.</i>

434
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:28,155
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

435
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,825
Or, we did, till...

436
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,114
I moved away.

437
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:34,409
- Hey. What gives?
- What?

438
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:36,874
Hey, Sadness.
You touched a memory?

439
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:39,976
- We talked about this!
- Hm yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

440
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,537
Get back in your circle.

441
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:42,966
Ah! What's going on?

442
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:44,966
- Get it out of there, Joy!
- Eject.

443
00:23:45,193 --> 00:23:47,529
We used to play tag and stuff.

444
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:49,457
Cool kids whispering at 3 o'clock.

445
00:23:49,482 --> 00:23:52,340
Did you see that look?
They're judging us!

446
00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:55,718
Somebody help grab that thing.
Everybody put in...

447
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:58,601
But, everything's different now.

448
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,762
Since we moved.

449
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:05,696
Oh no, we're crying at school!

450
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:08,851
What?!
Sadness, what are you doing?

451
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:12,990
Oh, I'm sorry, oh!

452
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:16,656
- It's a core memory.
- But, it's blue.

453
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:19,259
No, wait!

454
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:20,915
Stop it! No!

455
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,433
No!

456
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,003
Joy, no.

457
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:31,384
- That's a core memory.
- Hey!

458
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:33,379
- Stop it!  Let go.
- Don't.  Wait.

459
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,713
The core memories!

460
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:40,883
Ah!

461
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:51,513
No-no-no!

462
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,316
- Aah!
- Aah!

463
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:05,652
<i>Thank you, Riley.</i>

464
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,073
<i>I know it can be tough
moving to a new place.</i>

465
00:25:08,128 --> 00:25:10,636
<i>But we're happy
to have you here.</i>

466
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:13,238
<i>Alright everyone,
get out you history books,</i>

467
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:15,325
<i>and turn to chapter 7.</i>

468
00:25:17,358 --> 00:25:19,646
Can I say that curse word now?

469
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:22,021
- Aah!
- Aah!

470
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:25,942
Aaah!

471
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:33,554
Aaaaah!

472
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,603
<i>Aaaaaah!</i>

473
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:43,448
Oh no! 1, 2, 3, OK.

474
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:46,640
I got'em. Wha...?

475
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:48,311
Where are we?

476
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,651
Long term memory?!

477
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:51,940
What...

478
00:25:57,864 --> 00:25:59,556
Goofball Island?

479
00:26:00,388 --> 00:26:02,716
Riley's Islands of personality.

480
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:04,440
They'e all down!

481
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,901
Ohh, this is bad!

482
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:09,102
We... we can fix this.

483
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,606
We just have to get back
to headquarters,

484
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:15,184
plug the core memories in,
and Riley will be back to normal.

485
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:18,167
Oh, Riley has no core memories,

486
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:21,082
no personality Islands and no...

487
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:23,660
- What? What is it?
- You.

488
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:25,841
You're not in headquarters.

489
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:28,523
Without you Riley can't be happy.

490
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:31,333
We gotta get you back up there.

491
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:33,302
I'm coming, Riley.

492
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:50,399
So, as it turns out, the green
trash can is not recycling.

493
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:52,843
It's for greens, like
compost and eggshells.

494
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:55,147
<i>And the blue one is recycling,
and the black...</i>

495
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,793
Riley's acting so weird!

496
00:26:56,794 --> 00:26:57,914
Why is she acting so weird?

497
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:00,239
What do you expect?
All the Islands are down!

498
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:01,628
Joy would know what to do.

499
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,791
That's it!

500
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,697
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do.

501
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:08,384
Good idea!
Anger, Fear, Disgust...

502
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:10,471
How are we supposed to be happy?

503
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,430
<i>Hey, Riley, I got good news.</i>

504
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,618
I found a Junior Hockey League,
right here in San Francisco.

505
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:18,267
And get this! Tryouts are
tomorrow after school.

506
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:19,362
<i>What luck, right?</i>

507
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,200
- Hockey?
- Oh-oh what do we do?

508
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,868
Guys, th-this...
You pretend to be Joy.

509
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:26,821
Wouldn't it be great
to be back out on the ice?

510
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,213
Oh, yeah, that sounds fantastic.

511
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:32,955
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

512
00:27:32,991 --> 00:27:35,760
- Ah, because I'm NOT Joy!
- Yeah, no kidding!

513
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,065
Did you guus pick up on that?

514
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:41,845
- Yeah, something's wrong.
- Should we ask her?

515
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:44,852
Let's probe. But keep it subtle
so she doesn't notice.

516
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:47,257
So, how was the first day
of school?

517
00:27:47,258 --> 00:27:48,258
She's probing us.

518
00:27:48,284 --> 00:27:50,091
I'm done.
You pretend to be Joy.

519
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:52,041
What? OK...

520
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:55,634
It was fine, I guess, I dunno.

521
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:58,555
Oh, very smooth.
That was just like Joy!

522
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,677
Something is definitely going on!

523
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:03,277
She's never acted like this, before.
What should we do?

524
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:04,990
We're gonna find out
what's happening.

525
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:07,768
But we'll need support.
Signal the husband.

526
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,103
Ahem!

527
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:14,844
<i>With a nice pass, over to Reed,
coming across center-ice.</i>

528
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:16,017
Ahem!

529
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:20,134
Uh-oh!
She's looking at us.

530
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:22,079
- What did she say?
- What?

531
00:28:22,104 --> 00:28:23,963
Oh, sorry sir,
no one was listening.

532
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:26,329
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

533
00:28:26,354 --> 00:28:28,485
What? What is it, woman? What?

534
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,550
- He's making that stupid face again.
<i>- I could strangle him right now!</i>

535
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:34,774
Signal him again.

536
00:28:36,191 --> 00:28:37,751
Ah! So...

537
00:28:37,776 --> 00:28:39,114
Riley, how was school?

538
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:41,004
- Aw, Seriously?
- You gotta be kidding me!

539
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,392
For this, we gave up that
Brazilian helicopter pilot?!

540
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,275
Move! I'll be joy.

541
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,361
School was great, alright!

542
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:50,756
Riley?
Is everything OK?

543
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:51,795
Argh...

544
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,640
Sir, she just rolled
her eyes at us.

545
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,997
What is her deal?

546
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:58,367
Alright, make a show of force.
I don't wanna have to put the foot down.

547
00:28:58,392 --> 00:29:00,314
No, not the foot!

548
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,728
Riley, I do not like
this new attitude.

549
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:04,482
Oh, I'll show you attitude,
old man!

550
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:05,960
No, no-no, stay happy.

551
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:08,795
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

552
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,000
Sir, reporting high level
of sass.

553
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,610
Take it to DefCon 2.

554
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:15,333
Your heard that gentlemen.
DefCon 2!

555
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:16,836
Listen, young lady,

556
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,625
I don't know where this
disrespectful attitude came from.

557
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,352
You wanna piece of this, pops?
Come and get it!

558
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,124
Yeah?  Well, well...

559
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:26,988
Here it comes.
Prepare the foot!

560
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,994
Keys, to Safety Position!

561
00:29:31,184 --> 00:29:33,721
Ready to launch
on your command, sir.

562
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:35,670
Aaargh!

563
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:37,574
Just, shut up!

564
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:39,759
Fire!

565
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:42,017
That's it.
Go to your room!

566
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:43,587
Now!

567
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:44,702
Hah!

568
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:46,949
Gah!

569
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:50,081
Foot is down.
The foot is down!

570
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,768
Good job, gentlemen.
That could've been a disaster.

571
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,195
Well, that was a disaster.

572
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,667
Come, fly with me, gatinha.
(kitten)

573
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,798
- Ah!
- Ahh!

574
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:17,971
We're gonna walk
out there, on that?

575
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:19,717
It's the quickest way back.

576
00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:21,955
But it's right over
the Memory Dump.

577
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,334
If we fall, we'll be
forgotten forever.

578
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,216
We have to do this for Riley.

579
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:28,508
Just follow my footsteps.

580
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:31,429
It's not that high.
It's totally, ..

581
00:30:39,891 --> 00:30:41,459
Woa-ah.

582
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,315
Hey.

583
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:51,031
So...

584
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:53,831
Things got a little out
of hand downstairs.

585
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,979
Do you wanna talk about it?

586
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,654
Come on.
Where's my happy girl?

587
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,668
Monkey. Ooo-oo.

588
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:05,809
Oh! He's trying to start up Goofball.

589
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:09,651
<i>Come on. Ooo-oo-a-a-aa!</i>

590
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:19,423
Aah!

591
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,885
Go back! Turn around!

592
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,132
What the...?

593
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:07,242
I get it.

594
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,611
You need some alone time.

595
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,410
We'll talk later.

596
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:20,927
- We have a major problem.
- Oh, Joy, where are you?

597
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,987
We lost Goofball Island.

598
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,071
That means she can
lose Friendship,

599
00:32:26,096 --> 00:32:28,916
and Hockey and
Honesty and Family.

600
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:31,361
You can fix this, right, Joy?

601
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:34,949
- I-I don't know.
- Ohhh!

602
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,594
But we have to try. OK, come on.

603
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:40,773
- Riley's gone to sleep.
- Ohhh!

604
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,153
Which is a good thing...
When you think about it,

605
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,929
because nothing else bad
can happen while she's asleep.

606
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:49,128
We'll be back to Headquarters
before she wakes up.

607
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:52,334
We'll just go across
Friendship Island.

608
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:56,500
- Oh, we'll never make it!
- No-no-no...

609
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:58,343
Don't obsess over the
weight of life's problems.

610
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:00,455
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies.

611
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:02,871
Oh Sadness, we don't have
time for this.

612
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,756
We'll just have to go around.

613
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:06,436
Take the scenic route.

614
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,981
Wait, Joy, you can get lost
in there.

615
00:33:09,215 --> 00:33:11,363
- Think positive.
- OK.

616
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:14,656
I'm positive you will
get lost in there.

617
00:33:14,715 --> 00:33:16,633
That's long term memory.

618
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,046
An endless warren
of corridors and shelves.

619
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:21,562
I read about it in the manuals.

620
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:24,570
The manuals?
The manuals!

621
00:33:24,656 --> 00:33:26,381
- You read the manuals.
- Yeah.

622
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:28,908
So you know the way back
to headquarters.

623
00:33:28,994 --> 00:33:32,626
- I guess.
- Woo-Hnn-nn!

624
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:34,261
You are my map.

625
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:36,519
Let's go! Lead on, my map.

626
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:37,753
Show me where we're going.

627
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,630
OK, only...

628
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:41,444
I'm too sad to walk.

629
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:44,886
Just give me a few... hours.

630
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:48,864
<i>- Which way, left?
- Right.</i>

631
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:50,444
<i>No, I mean go left.</i>

632
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,627
<i>I said left was right,
like, correct.</i>

633
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:53,768
<i>OK.</i>

634
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:56,046
<i>This actually feels kinda nice.</i>

635
00:33:56,071 --> 00:33:57,503
<i>OK, here we go.</i>

636
00:33:57,543 --> 00:34:00,063
<i>We'll be back to
Headquarters before morning.</i>

637
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:01,988
<i>We can do it. This'll be easy!</i>

638
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:03,943
<i>This is working!</i>

639
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:07,979
This is not working.

640
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:11,741
- Are we getting close?
<i>- Yeah, just another right.</i>

641
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:16,018
<i>And a left and then another left.</i>

642
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,888
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

643
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:22,412
'Cause we seem to be
walking away from Headquarters.

644
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:24,482
Oh, Riley's awake.

645
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:27,118
Oh! Oh, uh!

646
00:34:28,558 --> 00:34:30,149
Don't.
Don't touch, remember?

647
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:32,756
If you touch them, they stay sad.

648
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:35,100
Oh, sorry, I- I won't.

649
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:38,733
- Starting now.
- I can't take much more of this.

650
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:40,305
<i>Forget'em!</i>

651
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,896
- Mind workers.
- But, Joy, we're almost oh.

652
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:45,854
Phone numbers.
We don't need all these.

653
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:46,891
They're in her phone.

654
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:48,503
- Just forget all that.
- Excuse me. Hi!

655
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:49,983
Forget it!

656
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:52,204
I need to find
Friendship Island.

657
00:34:52,254 --> 00:34:53,707
4 years of piano lessons!

658
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:55,660
<i>- Yeah, looks pretty faded.
- You know what? </i>

659
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,194
Save Chopsticks and
Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest.

660
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:00,120
- Are you?...
- US presidents, what do you think?

661
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:02,019
Just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

662
00:35:02,044 --> 00:35:03,384
- Forget'em!
- Hey!

663
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:06,202
You can't throw those away.
Those are perfectly good memories.

664
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:08,529
The names of every
Cutiepie princess doll?

665
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:10,369
Yes, that is critical information.

666
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:13,123
- Glitter storm, Honey pants...
- Forget'em!

667
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,489
- Hey, bring those back!
- They're in the Dump.

668
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:22,811
- Nothing comes back from the Dump.
- Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, OK?

669
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:25,019
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

670
00:35:25,044 --> 00:35:26,602
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of'em.

671
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:30,585
Except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

672
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:32,538
♪ <i>Tripledent gum will make you...</i>

673
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:34,044
The song from the
gum commercial?

674
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:36,680
You know, sometimes we send that one
up to Headquarters for no reason.

675
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:40,712
Just plays in Rileys head over
and over again like a million times.

676
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,999
Let's watch it again.

677
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:46,520
Yeah, I know. We all know the song.
OK, real catchy.

678
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,959
- Hey, what do you think,
should we do it? - Yeah.

679
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:53,135
OK. Here we go!
Ha-ha-ha.

680
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:54,609
♪ <i>Tripledent gum...</i>

681
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,587
What the?... This again?

682
00:35:56,665 --> 00:35:57,850
Oh, Great!

683
00:35:57,962 --> 00:36:01,275
Wait, do you know how to
get to Friendship Island?

684
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,977
Do you like it there?
Did you feel any earthquakes?

685
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:05,219
Is the bridge cool?

686
00:36:05,278 --> 00:36:07,678
Yeah, it's good.
What happened with the playoffs?

687
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:11,067
We won the first game. Coach says we
might actually go to the finals this year.

688
00:36:11,092 --> 00:36:14,156
Oh, and we got this new girl
 on the team. She's so cool!

689
00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:16,690
- Ah, she did not just say that!
- A new girl?

690
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:18,570
Meg has a new friend already?

691
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:20,223
- Grr!
- Hey-hey! Stay happy.

692
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:22,455
We do not wanna lose
any more islands here, guys.

693

<i>We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.</i>

694
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:26,209
<i>It's like mind reading.</i>

695
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:27,580
You like to read minds, Meg?

696
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:29,208
I got something for you
to read right here!

697
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:30,891
W-wait, let's just be calm
for 1 sec...

698
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:32,220
Aaargh!

699
00:36:32,518 --> 00:36:33,922
- I gotta go.
- What?

700
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:35,781
I gotta go!

701
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,633
Wait, could you just please
tell me which way is...

702
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:41,309
Oh no!

703
00:36:43,713 --> 00:36:46,173
Friendship Island! What?

704
00:36:57,544 --> 00:36:59,415
Not Friendship!

705
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:09,055
Oh, Riley loved that one.
And now it's gone.

706
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:12,409
Goodbye, Friendship.
Hello, Loneliness.

707
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:13,463
Grrr!

708
00:37:16,757 --> 00:37:19,465
We'll just have to go the long way.

709
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:24,744
Yeah, the long long long, way.

710
00:37:25,338 --> 00:37:27,164
I'm ready.

711
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:30,736
There's gotta be a better way.

712
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:35,101
- Oo,well look at you!
- Huh?

713
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:37,829
I will take you, but not you.

714
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:40,263
Oh, who am I kidding?
I can't leave you!

715
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:41,638
Hello!

716
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,171
- Aah!
- Wait. Hey, wait!

717
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,478
No, wait. Stop.

718
00:37:55,803 --> 00:37:57,714
- Excuse me.
- Aah!

719
00:37:57,882 --> 00:37:59,575
Oh, I was, I was looking for....

720
00:37:59,662 --> 00:38:01,028
- diversion!
- What?

721
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:03,471
Ha ha, so long, sucker!

722
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:05,192
Ow, I hurt all over!

723
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:06,805
Wait, I know you.

724
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:09,275
No, you don't.
I get that a lot.

725
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:12,111
- I look like a lot of people.
- No no! I do.

726
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,905
Bing Bong!
Riley's imaginary friend.

727
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,369
- You really do know me?
- Of course!

728
00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:20,262
Riley loved playing with you.
You two were best friends.

729
00:38:20,302 --> 00:38:21,582
Oh, you would know!

730
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:23,796
- We're trying to get back to Headquarters.
- Headquarters?

731
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:26,382
- You guys are from Headquarters?
- Well, yeah.

732
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:27,896
I'm Joy. This is Sadness.

733
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:29,954
- You're Joy, the Joy?
- M-hm!

734
00:38:29,979 --> 00:38:31,596
What the heck
are you doing out here?

735
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,395
That's a good question.
Wanna answer that, Sadness?

736
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:37,155
Without you,
I won't ever be happy.

737
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,183
We can't have that,
we gotta get you back!

738
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,232
I'll tell you what, follow me.

739
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:44,005
Thank you. It is so great
to see you again.

740
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,485
I gotta tell you, I am such
a huge fan of your work.

741
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,793
Do you remember when you and
Riley were in a band? Ha-ha!

742
00:38:49,836 --> 00:38:51,359
<i>I went to all of your concerts.</i>

743
00:38:51,384 --> 00:38:52,795
<i>Yeah, I blow a mean nose.</i>

744
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,687
<i>- Watching you play tag was such a treat.
- 2 time world champ!</i>

745
00:38:55,712 --> 00:38:57,651
<i>Oh, and remember your rocket?</i>

746
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:59,965
<i>Of course, it runs
on song power!</i>

747
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:01,427
That's right, your theme song.

748
00:39:01,483 --> 00:39:04,109
♪ <i>- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing Bong, Bing Bong.</i>

749
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:07,612
♪ <i>- His rocket makes you yell Hooray!
- Bing Bong, Bing Bong.</i>

750
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,975
What exactly are you
supposed to be?

751
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,007
You know it's unclear.
I'm mostly cotton candy, but,

752
00:39:13,038 --> 00:39:17,384
shape-wise, I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

753
00:39:17,445 --> 00:39:18,831
Dolphin?

754
00:39:18,865 --> 00:39:20,138
[Ki-ki-ki-ki...!]

755
00:39:21,456 --> 00:39:24,496
You gotta remember, when Riley
was 3, animals were all the rage.

756
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:26,425
The cow goes, moo,
the horse goes, neigh.

757
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,907
It's all people talked about
back then.

758
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,515
Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's true.

759
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,771
What are you doing out here?

760
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:34,190
Well, there's not much call
for imaginary friends, lately.

761
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:37,613
So, I, you know...

762
00:39:38,278 --> 00:39:40,540
Hey, hey, don't be sad.

763
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:42,803
Tell you what, when I get
back up to Headquarters,

764
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:45,115
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

765
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:47,545
- You will?
- Of course! She'd love that.

766
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:50,836
Ha-haa! This is the greatest
day of my life!

767
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:52,266
Hot-cha-cha...

768
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:54,336
Ow ow ow...

769
00:39:55,232 --> 00:39:57,941
- Are you OK?
- Hey, what's going on?

770
00:39:58,017 --> 00:39:59,300
I cry candy.

771
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,911
- Try the caramel, it's delicious.
- Oo!

772
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,027
Woah!

773
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,122
- Oo! Here use this.
- Thanks.

774
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,213
Oh, hold on. Wait a second.

775
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:12,602
It always get stuck
at the bottom.

776
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,849
Here.

777
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:17,663
Wha...? It's imaginary!

778
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:19,419
Thanks! This will
make it a lot easier

779
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:20,708
to walk back to Headquarters.

780
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:22,394
Walk?! We're not walking.

781
00:40:22,472 --> 00:40:25,852
We're taking the Train of Thought.

782
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,184
The Train, of course!

783
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:30,830
That is so much faster.
But how do we catch it?

784
00:40:30,855 --> 00:40:32,943
Well, it kinda goes
all over the place

785
00:40:32,968 --> 00:40:35,299
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

786
00:40:35,324 --> 00:40:37,903
I know a shortcut.
Come on, this way.

787
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,483
Oh, I'm so glad we ran into you.

788
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:43,341
The station is right in here.
After you.

789
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:44,859
- Joy.
- What?

790
00:40:44,924 --> 00:40:46,892
I read about this
place in the manual

791
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:48,238
We shouldn't go in there.

792
00:40:48,297 --> 00:40:50,392
Bing Bong says it's the
quickest way to Headquarters.

793
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:52,447
No, but Joy,
this is abstract thought.

794
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:54,996
What are you talking about?
I go in here all the time.

795
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:56,534
It's a shortcut, you see?

796
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,220
D-A-N-G-E-R: Shortcut!

797
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,951
I'll prove it to you.

798
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:02,497
Look at me.

799
00:41:02,644 --> 00:41:04,350
I'm closer to the station.

800
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,568
'Cause I'm taking the shortcut.

801
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:08,527
Let's go around. This way.

802
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:10,853
<i>Almost there, now!</i>

803
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,777
If you wanna walk
the long way, go for it.

804
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:15,735
But Riley needs to be happy.

805
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:17,391
I'm not missing that Train.

806
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:19,144
Bing Bong knows
what he is doing.

807
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:21,137
He's part dolphin,
they're very smart.

808
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:22,904
Well, I guess.

809
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:42,817
OK, what abstract concept

810
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:44,885
are we trying to
comprehend today?

811
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:46,455
Ahm, loneliness.

812
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:48,521
Hm, looks like there's
something in there.

813
00:41:48,552 --> 00:41:51,092
I'm gonna turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk.

814
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,605
What did I tell ya?
You'll be in Headquarters in no time!

815
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:56,912
Hey, will you look at that?

816
00:41:56,937 --> 00:41:59,957
- Woah! What's happening?
- Oh no, they turned it on!

817
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,103
Huh? Never seen this before.

818
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,497
Whaaat?!

819
00:42:03,883 --> 00:42:04,844
Aahh!

820
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:05,903
My face!

821
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:08,157
My beautiful face! No!

822
00:42:08,182 --> 00:42:09,978
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting.

823
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:12,048
There are 4 stages.
This is the first.

824
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:13,966
Non-objective fragmentation.

825
00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:15,316
Alright, do not panic!

826
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:18,132
What is important
is that we all stay together.

827
00:42:18,157 --> 00:42:19,163
- Oh!
- Ah!

828
00:42:19,188 --> 00:42:21,928
We're in the second stage,
we’re deconstructing!

829
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:23,356
Run!

830
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,128
Ah, I can't feel my legs!

831
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:28,284
Oh, there they are.

832
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:29,714
Come here, me!

833
00:42:30,937 --> 00:42:34,828
We gotta get outta here, before
we're not even shape and color!

834
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:36,673
We'll get stuck here forever!

835
00:42:36,698 --> 00:42:38,394
Bong, why did we come in here?

836
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:41,072
I told you, it's a shortcut.

837
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:42,749
The Train!

838
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:50,166
Oh no, we're 2 dimensional!
That's stage 3.

839
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,443
We're getting nowhere.

840
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,579
- Depth! I'm lacking depth.
- Come on!

841
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,069
We can't fit.

842
00:42:59,094 --> 00:43:02,676
Oh no, we're not figurative!
This is the last stage.

843
00:43:02,701 --> 00:43:04,473
We're not gonna make it.

844
00:43:04,527 --> 00:43:05,660
Ohh!

845
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:10,433
Wait, we're 2 dimensional.
Fall on your face.

846
00:43:20,843 --> 00:43:22,595
Stop. Stop!

847
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,053
Oh, no!
You said that was a shortcut.

848
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,080
I did. But wow, we should not
have gone in there!

849
00:43:30,105 --> 00:43:32,593
That was dangerous.
They, really, should put up a sign.

850
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:34,764
- How long till the next Train?
- Who knows?

851
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:37,347
But don’t worry.
There's another station. That way.

852
00:43:37,374 --> 00:43:40,632
The Train always stops there,
right before it goes to Headquarters.

853
00:43:40,657 --> 00:43:42,562
If we hurry, we can catch it.

854
00:43:42,676 --> 00:43:44,894
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

855
00:43:45,002 --> 00:43:47,292
Ha-ha-ha! Yeah!

856
00:43:47,493 --> 00:43:49,193
Is there really another station?

857
00:43:49,231 --> 00:43:51,224
Uh-huh. Through there.

858
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,095
Welcome to Imagination Land!

859
00:43:55,772 --> 00:43:57,103
Imagination Land?

860
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:58,588
Sure, I come here all the time.

861
00:43:58,619 --> 00:43:59,993
I'm practically the mayor.

862
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:01,451
Hey, you guys hungry?

863
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:03,499
There's French Fry Forest.

864
00:44:03,676 --> 00:44:05,664
No way?! Ha-ha-ha!

865
00:44:05,689 --> 00:44:07,927
Check it out. Trophy Town.

866
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:09,377
Medals, ribbons...

867
00:44:09,537 --> 00:44:11,464
everyone's a winner.

868
00:44:11,926 --> 00:44:13,304
I won first place!

869
00:44:13,386 --> 00:44:14,436
Me too!

870
00:44:14,493 --> 00:44:16,356
Oh, participation award!

871
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:18,367
Wait, is that?...
Is that a?... Look.

872
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:20,062
It's Cloud Town.

873
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:21,969
That's my favorite, hoo-hoo-hoo!

874
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:24,913
- Oh, it's so soft.
- O-ho, let me try.

875
00:44:24,938 --> 00:44:27,010
Hey, what's the big idea?

876
00:44:27,035 --> 00:44:28,601
You'd better fix that wall

877
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:30,772
or else you're in big trouble.

878
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:34,786
- Oh no, lava!
- Woo. Woah!

879
00:44:34,811 --> 00:44:37,761
Imagination Land is the best.

880
00:44:37,915 --> 00:44:40,808
Oh, is it all gonna be
so interactive?

881
00:44:40,947 --> 00:44:43,132
Hey look, the House of Cards!

882
00:44:43,157 --> 00:44:45,486
Oh, wait!
Hang on just a minute.

883
00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:46,900
Ah, your rocket!

884
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:48,940
Yeah, I stashed it in there
for safekeeping.

885
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:51,891
And now I'm all set
to take Riley to the moon!

886
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,451
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Great!

887
00:44:54,538 --> 00:44:57,344
-Oh, I love Imagination Land!
- Isn't it great?

888
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,703
And there's always
something new like...

889
00:45:02,146 --> 00:45:05,016
- Who the heck is that?
- Imaginary boyfriend.

890
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:07,317
- I would die for Riley.
- Oh, blekh!

891
00:45:07,342 --> 00:45:10,377
- I've never seen him before.
- I live in Canada.

892
00:45:10,402 --> 00:45:14,195
Anyway. This way, through Preschool World.
We're nearly to the train.

893
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,775
Riley, here we come.
Woo-hoo! Ha-ha-ha!

894
00:45:18,184 --> 00:45:21,771
This should be fun.
New team, new friends...

895
00:45:21,936 --> 00:45:23,311
There kids look pretty good.

896
00:45:23,336 --> 00:45:26,331
Considering they're from
San Francisco. Heheh!

897
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,422
- Gotta go.
- OK. Good luck, sweetie!

898
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:30,736
Luck isn't going to help us now.

899
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,782
If she tries to use Hockey Island,
it's going down.

900
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:34,241
Which is why, I've recalled

901
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:36,128
every hockey memory
I can think of.

902
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:37,555
One of these has gotta work

903
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,035
in place of the core memory.

904
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:41,532
- She's about to play.
- Hurry.

905
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,038
Ha ha! We did it gang.

906
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:50,603
It's working!

907
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,289
Oh!

908
00:45:53,896 --> 00:45:57,262
<i>Line change! Change it up!</i>

909
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:04,647
Haha! No-no. Aahh!

910
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,969
It's like we don't learn anything.

911
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:20,106
- That's it!
- No no, breathe...

912
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:21,658
find your happy place.

913
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:23,367
Aaarggh!

914
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:35,324
- Riley, what's wrong?
- Let's go.

915
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,993
- You're not going to finish tryouts?
- What's the point?

916
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,010
Hey, it'll be alright. Let's just...

917
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:43,016
Stop saying everything will be alright!

918
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,390
<i>Nice hustling, ladies!</i>

919
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,067
Hockey?!

920
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,785
Oh no no, she loves hockey,

921
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:03,296
she can't give up hockey!

922
00:47:05,111 --> 00:47:06,777
Bing Bong, we have to get to
that station.

923
00:47:06,802 --> 00:47:09,317
Sure thing. This way,
just past Graham Cracker Castle.

924
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:12,764
Hey, that's weird! Graham Cracker
Castle used to be right here,

925
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:14,490
I wonder why they moved it.

926
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:17,571
I would've sworn, Sparkle Pony
Mountain was right here.

927
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:19,408
- Hey, what's going on?
- Y-yeah, I dunno,

928
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:22,675
- we'll have to come back.
- Princess Dreamworld!

929
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:27,274
Oh, the Stuffed Animal
Hall of Fame!

930
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:30,388
My rocket?

931
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:33,368
Wait, Riley and I we're still
using that rocket.

932
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:35,319
It still has some song power left.

933
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:38,486
♪ <i>Who's your friend who likes to play?</i>

00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:40,179

00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,022
No! No no.

936
00:47:45,056 --> 00:47:47,109
You can't take my
rocket to the Dump.

937
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:49,484
Riley and I are
going to the moon!

938
00:47:54,317 --> 00:47:56,846
Riley can't be done with me?

939
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:04,450
Hey, it's gonna be OK!

940
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,980
We can fix this!

941
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:08,106
We just need to get
back to Headquarters.

942
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,648
Which way to the Train station?

943
00:48:09,695 --> 00:48:12,608
I had a whole trip
planned for us.

944
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:15,115
Hey, who's ticklish?

945
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:18,227
Here comes the tickle monster!

946
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:21,064
Hey, Bing Bong, look at this.

947
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,984
Blgoyoyngg!

948
00:48:23,805 --> 00:48:25,112
Oh, here's a fun game.

949
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:27,033
You point to the Train station

950
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:28,879
and we all go there.

951
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,509
Won't that be fun?

952
00:48:30,563 --> 00:48:33,188
Come on,
let's go to the Train station!

953
00:48:34,272 --> 00:48:36,951
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

954
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,589
They took something
that you loved.

955
00:48:39,682 --> 00:48:41,549
It's gone, forever.

956
00:48:41,648 --> 00:48:44,654
- Sadness, don't make him feel worse.
- Sorry.

957
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:47,114
It's all I had left of Riley.

958
00:48:47,267 --> 00:48:50,088
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

959
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:52,159
Oh, they were wonderful.

960
00:48:52,227 --> 00:48:53,973
Once, we flew back in time.

961
00:48:54,049 --> 00:48:56,206
We had breakfast twice that day.

962
00:48:56,274 --> 00:48:57,278
Sadness.

963
00:48:57,317 --> 00:49:00,122
It sounds amazing.
I bet Riley liked it.

964
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:01,782
Oh, she did.

965
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:04,135
We were best friends.

966
00:49:04,669 --> 00:49:07,029
Yeah. It's sad.

967
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,745
Wha...?

968
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:20,649
I'm OK now.

969
00:49:22,148 --> 00:49:23,153
Come on.

970
00:49:23,209 --> 00:49:25,476
The Train station is this way.

971
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:33,718
- How did you do that?
- Oh, I don't know.

972
00:49:33,743 --> 00:49:36,536
I feel he's sad, so,
I listen to what...

973
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:38,756
Hey! ... There's the Train.

974
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:53,977
Oh, we made it, we're
finally gonna get home!

975
00:49:54,082 --> 00:49:57,593
Oh no, these facts and
opinions look so similar.

976
00:49:57,646 --> 00:50:00,718
Ah, don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

977
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:05,734
On a scale of 1 to 10.

978
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:07,194
I give this day an 'F'.

979
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:10,170
Well, why don't we quit standing
around and do something.

980
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:11,313
Like what, genius?

981
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:13,493
Like quitting.
That's what I'm doing.

982
00:50:13,518 --> 00:50:15,571
Sure, it's the coward's way out.

983
00:50:15,614 --> 00:50:18,240
But this coward's gonna survive!

984
00:50:25,341 --> 00:50:27,646
Emotions can't quit, genius.

985
00:50:28,245 --> 00:50:31,519
Ugh! I thought we're supposed
to be keeping Riley happy.

986
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:33,641
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

987
00:50:36,439 --> 00:50:38,663
Aha! Ho ho ho...

988
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,541
- What is it?
- Oh nothing.

989
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,838
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

990
00:50:42,863 --> 00:50:45,571
All the good core memories
were made in Minnesota.

991
00:50:45,596 --> 00:50:49,250
Ergo, we go back to Minnesota
and make more. Ta-dah!

992
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:51,857
Wait wait wait.
You're saying, we run away?

993
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,276
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

994
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:56,111
I'd call it the Happy Core Memory
Development Program.

995
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,716
- You can't be serious.
- Hey, our life was perfect.

996
00:50:58,741 --> 00:51:02,953
Until Mon and Dad decided to
move to San Fran-stinko.

997
00:51:02,978 --> 00:51:04,979
But, I mean, it's just so drastic.

998
00:51:05,004 --> 00:51:07,495
Need I remind you of how
great things were there?

999
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,001
Our room. Our backyard.
Our friends.

1000
00:51:11,055 --> 00:51:13,568
♪ <i>Tripledent gum will make you smile</i>

1001
00:51:13,652 --> 00:51:16,101
Did I ask for the gum commercial?

1002
00:51:16,126 --> 00:51:17,660
Anyway, it was better.
That's my point.

1003
00:51:17,685 --> 00:51:21,080
- Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.
- Wait. Hold on.

1004
00:51:21,105 --> 00:51:22,765
Shouldn't we just sleep
on this or something?

1005
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,275
Fine, let's sleep on it.

1006
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,370
Because, hey, I'm sure
jolly fun-filled times

1007
00:51:27,436 --> 00:51:29,802
are just around the corner.

1008
00:51:36,282 --> 00:51:37,601
Huh?

1009
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:43,310
Hey hey, why aren't we moving?

1010
00:51:43,335 --> 00:51:45,797
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

1011
00:51:45,822 --> 00:51:47,648
You mean we're stuck here
until morning?

1012
00:51:47,673 --> 00:51:49,773
Yeah, the Train of Thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

1013
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:52,470
- Oh, we can't wait that long.
- How about we wake her up.

1014
00:51:52,495 --> 00:51:54,250
Sadness, that's ridiculous.

1015
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,050
How can we possibly...

1016
00:51:57,658 --> 00:51:59,976
- How about we wake her up.
- Great idea Joy.

1017
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:01,573
Thanks, come on!

1018
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,285
Woh, this place is huge!

1019
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:11,201
It looks so much smaller

- She wants your autograph.
- No no, Sadness.

Don't bother Miss Unicorn, OK?

1025

Sorry she's from out of town.

OK, how are we
gonna wake her up?

1038
00:53:00,523 --> 00:53:03,547
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

1039

- We could scare her.
- Scare her?

1040

- No no. She's been through
enough already. - But, Joy.

01:01:44,572 --> 01:01:46,739
Ah, I can't wait to get
the old Riley back.

1190
01:01:46,764 --> 01:01:49,729
As soon as we get there,
I'm gonna fix this whole mess.

1191
01:01:49,754 --> 01:01:51,503
Wow, is this Riley?

1192
01:01:51,528 --> 01:01:53,922
She's so big now,
she won't fit in my rocket.

1193
01:01:53,947 --> 01:01:55,364
How are we gonna
get to the moon?

1194
01:01:55,389 --> 01:01:58,309
Oh, it's that time in the
Twistee Tree, remember?

1195
01:01:58,334 --> 01:02:02,410
The hockey team showed up and
Mon and Dad were there cheering.

1196
01:02:02,435 --> 01:02:05,700
Look at her, having fun and laughing.

1197
01:02:05,948 --> 01:02:09,756
- Ah, I love this one.
- Hm, I love that one too.

1198
01:02:09,781 --> 01:02:12,647
- Atta girl! Now you're getting it.
- Yeah.

1199
01:02:12,672 --> 01:02:16,134
It was the day the Prairie Dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1200
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:21,101
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful, she wanted to quit.

1201
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,376
Sorry, I went sad again,
didn't I?

1202
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:29,635
I'll tell you what, we can keep working
on that when we get back, OK?

1203
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,398
OK.

1204
01:02:32,746 --> 01:02:34,948
<i>I just don't understand.</i>

1205
01:02:36,676 --> 01:02:39,611
<i>Why did our moving van
even go to Texas?</i>

1206
01:02:43,699 --> 01:02:45,673
<i>Multiple customers?</i>

1207
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,361
<i>Well, we were promised
delivery on the 5th.</i>

1208
01:02:58,361 --> 01:02:59,949
Uh-huh.

1209
01:03:04,924 --> 01:03:08,591
Excuse me, isn't there
any way that you can rush it?

1210
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:15,221
Honesty Island?

1211
01:03:23,593 --> 01:03:25,008
Look out!

1212
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:26,734
Aaahh!

1213
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,864
Come on!

1214
01:03:36,076 --> 01:03:37,585
Hold on!

1215
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,718
- Hurry up.
- Jump over here!

1216
01:03:40,127 --> 01:03:41,296
- Go-go-go.
- I got it.

1217
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:42,933
- Pull!
- Pull!

1218
01:03:53,568 --> 01:03:55,108
That was our way home.

1219
01:03:55,133 --> 01:03:57,738
We lost another island.
What is happening?

1220
01:03:57,763 --> 01:04:01,175
Haven't you heard?
Riley's running away.

1221
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,605
What?

1222
01:04:03,608 --> 01:04:05,992
Wait wait! Hang on, guys.

1223
01:04:06,017 --> 01:04:08,919
Are we really doing this?
This is serious.

1224
01:04:08,944 --> 01:04:10,717
Look, we have no core memories.

1225
01:04:10,742 --> 01:04:12,040
You want Riley to be happy?

1226
01:04:12,065 --> 01:04:15,467
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

1227
01:04:15,826 --> 01:04:19,258
Joy, if we hurry,
we can still stop her.

1228
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:22,486
Family Island. Let's go!

1229
01:04:36,387 --> 01:04:37,698
Joy!

1230
01:04:37,723 --> 01:04:42,030
Joy, it's too dangerous,
we won't make it in time.

1231
01:04:44,788 --> 01:04:46,847
But, that's our only way back.

1232
01:04:58,681 --> 01:05:00,758
A recall tube.

1233
01:05:02,651 --> 01:05:04,773
We can get recall.

1234
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:10,032
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1235
01:05:10,057 --> 01:05:13,897
- See you after school, monkey.
- We love you.

1236
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:19,498
Go, run run! Go!

1237
01:05:29,115 --> 01:05:30,700
Whoa-whoa, Sadness!

1238
01:05:30,725 --> 01:05:32,711
Sadness, stop!

1239
01:05:33,114 --> 01:05:36,689
- You're hurting Riley.
- No no no, I did it again!

1240
01:05:36,714 --> 01:05:41,042
If you get in here,
these core memories will get sad.

1241
01:05:45,892 --> 01:05:47,492
I'm sorry.

1242
01:05:47,517 --> 01:05:51,122
- Riley needs to be happy.
- Joy?

1243
01:06:00,406 --> 01:06:03,612
Aaah!

1244
01:06:04,443 --> 01:06:08,141
Joy! Aaah!

1245
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,405
Joy!

1246
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,730
Joy?

1247
01:06:52,305 --> 01:06:53,975
Joy!

1248
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:03,134
Joy, Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please.

1249
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:10,784
Don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here!

1250
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:13,041
We're forgotten.

1251
01:07:20,321 --> 01:07:23,529
<i>(We used to play tag, and stuff.)</i>

1252
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,632
<i>(But, everything's different now.)</i>

1253
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:33,274
<i>(Since we moved.)</i>

1254
01:08:03,938 --> 01:08:06,006
Do you remember,

1255
01:08:06,093 --> 01:08:10,237
how she used to stick her tongue
out when she was coloring?

1256
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:23,100
I could listen to
her stories all day.

1257
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,637
I just wanted
Riley to be happy.

1258
01:09:39,991 --> 01:09:44,049
It was the day the Prairie Dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1259
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:48,042
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1260
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,635
 She wanted to quit.

1261
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,678
Sadness.

1262
01:10:10,534 --> 01:10:14,903
Mom and Dad, the team;

1263
01:10:14,928 --> 01:10:19,550
they came to help
because of sadness.

1264
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,930
We have to get back up there.

1265
01:10:27,286 --> 01:10:30,354
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1266
01:10:30,379 --> 01:10:33,200
We might as well be
on another planet.

1267
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,553

Oh!

01:13:14,629 --> 01:13:16,354
Oh!

I'll try, Bing Bong.

I promise.

1304
01:13:39,247 --> 01:13:40,978
We're home!

01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:44,925
Riley? Riley!

1306
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:50,583
I'll call her cell.

1307
01:13:52,904 --> 01:13:54,206
Oh, this is terrible!

1308
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,270
Wait, is that someone
walking towards us?

1309
01:13:56,295 --> 01:13:58,245
L-Let's cross the street.

1310
01:14:01,878 --> 01:14:03,206
It's Mom! She's onto us!

1311
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,602
- What do we do?
- Where's my bag?

1312
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:06,587
Riley needs to get
core memories.

1313
01:14:06,618 --> 01:14:08,726
We keep going.

1314
01:14:11,288 --> 01:14:12,914
Sadness!

1315
01:14:14,024 --> 01:14:15,351
Oh!

1316
01:14:23,008 --> 01:14:25,205
Sadness! Sadness?

1317
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:27,666
Come on, Sadness, where are you?

1318
01:14:27,818 --> 01:14:31,094
OK, if I were Sadness,
where would I be?

1319
01:14:31,472 --> 01:14:35,613
Oh, everything is awful
and my legs don't work.

1320
01:14:35,713 --> 01:14:39,919
And you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1321
01:14:55,068 --> 01:14:57,144
Oh no, it's Mom again.
What do we do?

1322
01:14:57,169 --> 01:14:58,397
Uh.

1323
01:15:03,326 --> 01:15:05,659
This is madness!
She shouldn't run away!

1324
01:15:05,684 --> 01:15:07,760
Let's get this idea
out of her head.

1325
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,749
Sadness?

1326
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:13,853
- Sadness!
- Joy?

1327
01:15:14,467 --> 01:15:16,257
Wait, Sadness!

1328
01:15:16,382 --> 01:15:20,305
Just let me go.
Riley's better off without me.

1329
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:22,271
Come back!

1330
01:15:26,495 --> 01:15:28,775
OK, now. You're saying
your husband was

1331
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:30,396
blown away by an elephant.

1332
01:15:30,428 --> 01:15:32,929
- Was he with anyone?
- Yes, and there she is!

1333
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,201
Hey, come back here!

1334
01:15:34,226 --> 01:15:37,344
Forget it Jake.
It's cloud talk.

1335
01:15:41,406 --> 01:15:42,733
- Sadness!
- Boo-hoo-hoo!

1336
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:44,909
I only make everything worse!

1337
01:15:44,961 --> 01:15:48,391
Wait. Sadness, we gotta
get you back to...

1338
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,279
- Hnngh! It's stuck!
- Oh, great!

1339
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,113
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

1340
01:16:01,138 --> 01:16:04,128
No-no-no! What is this?

1341
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,758
- How do we stop it?
- I got it.

1342
01:16:13,783 --> 01:16:16,090
Make her feel scared.
That'll make her change her mind.

1343
01:16:16,122 --> 01:16:18,066
- Brilliant.
- I know it's brilliant. Do it.

1344
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:19,933
Nothing's working.
Why isn't it working?

1345
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,703
- Lemme try!
- Wait. You broke it. - No.

1346
01:16:21,728 --> 01:16:24,419
- Move. Move.
- Let me do it. Get outta here!

1347
01:16:26,423 --> 01:16:27,592
No.

1348
01:16:27,664 --> 01:16:31,377
Guys, we can't make
Riley feel anything.

1349
01:16:31,984 --> 01:16:34,197
What have we done?

1350
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,553
Hey! Hey, look at me.
Did you mean what you said before?

1351
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:39,886
I would die for Riley.
I would die for Riley.

1352
01:16:39,926 --> 01:16:42,762
Yeah, OK, haircut.
Time to prove it!

1353
01:16:45,381 --> 01:16:48,224
I would die for Riley.
I would die for Riley.

1354
01:16:48,249 --> 01:16:50,804
I would die for Riley.
I would die for Riley.

1355
01:16:51,813 --> 01:16:53,893
Ah, hoo-hoo!
Boo hoo-hoo!

1356
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:08,355
That's it, I fold!

1357
01:17:25,463 --> 01:17:27,970
Whoaaaa!

1358
01:17:29,822 --> 01:17:31,252
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1359
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:35,392
Whoa.
OK. Whoa.

1360
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:38,366
- Woo-woo-woo.
- Woh.

1361
01:17:38,391 --> 01:17:40,471
This is crazy.
This is crazy.

1362
01:17:40,496 --> 01:17:43,054
No no, Joy, be positive.

1363
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:48,815
I am positive this is crazy!

1364
01:17:52,115 --> 01:17:53,279
Now!

1365
01:17:53,304 --> 01:17:58,062
For Riley...
For Riley...

1366
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:05,106
- Joy?
- Hang on.

1367
01:18:05,753 --> 01:18:08,337
Oh, I wish Joy was here.

1368
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:16,511
It's Joy!

1369
01:18:16,884 --> 01:18:19,362
Stand back... Yah!

1370
01:18:19,772 --> 01:18:23,189
- That worked.
- Well, what would you do if you're so smart?

1371
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,322
I'd tell you, but you're
too dumb to understand.

1372
01:18:26,478 --> 01:18:28,700
- What?
- Of course, your tiny brain is confused.

1373
01:18:28,725 --> 01:18:31,740
Guess I'll just have to dumb it
down to your level.

1374
01:18:31,765 --> 01:18:35,240
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you. But let me try.

1375
01:18:35,264 --> 01:18:36,665
Duh!

1376
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:42,970
Arrrghh!

1377
01:18:45,515 --> 01:18:46,959
Oh, thank goodness you're back!

1378
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:49,283
- Things are really messed up.
- We found this idea...

1379
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:50,806
Oh no!

1380
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:02,279
Joy, you got to fix this.
Get out there.

1381
01:19:02,305 --> 01:19:04,751
- Sadness, it's up to you.
- Me?

1382
01:19:04,776 --> 01:19:06,656
- Sadness?!
- Sadness?!

1383
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:08,868
- I can't, Joy.
- Yes you can.

1384
01:19:08,893 --> 01:19:11,445
Riley, needs you.

1385
01:19:22,588 --> 01:19:24,010
OK.

1386
01:19:44,141 --> 01:19:47,349
Wait, stop!
I wanna get off.

1387
01:19:58,223 --> 01:20:00,082
Alright, thank you, we will.

1388
01:20:00,107 --> 01:20:02,020
Her teacher hasn't even
seen Riley all day.

1389
01:20:02,045 --> 01:20:03,679
- What?
-What was she wearing last?

1390
01:20:03,704 --> 01:20:05,763
- Can't believe this.
- Do you remember what...

1391
01:20:05,799 --> 01:20:07,439
- Riley! - There you are,
thank goodness!

1392
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:10,799
Oh, we were worried sick.
Where have you been? It's so late!

1393
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,490
<i>(Riley, what happened?
Are you alright?)</i>

1394
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:45,830
I know you don't want me to, but,

1395
01:21:46,774 --> 01:21:49,104
I miss home.

1396
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,535
I miss Minnesota.

1397
01:21:55,046 --> 01:21:57,674
You need me to be happy.

1398
01:21:57,699 --> 01:21:59,050
But,

1399
01:22:00,005 --> 01:22:05,459
I want my old friends
and hockey team.

1400
01:22:06,887 --> 01:22:09,068
I wanna go home.

1401
01:22:10,349 --> 01:22:12,789
Please don't be mad.

1402
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:18,575
- Oh, sweetie!
- We're not mad.

1403
01:22:19,508 --> 01:22:23,929
You know what?
I miss Minnesota too.

1404
01:22:24,805 --> 01:22:28,269
I miss the woods
where we took hikes.

1405
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:31,398
And the backyard
where you used to play.

1406
01:22:31,423 --> 01:22:35,372
Spring Lake,
where you learned to skate.

1407
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:38,221
Come here.

1408
01:23:59,215 --> 01:24:00,813
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1409
01:24:00,838 --> 01:24:02,377
Friendship Island's expanded.

1410
01:24:02,402 --> 01:24:05,033
Glad they finally opened that
friendly argument section.

1411
01:24:05,058 --> 01:24:07,137
I like
Tragic Vampire Romance Island.

1412
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:09,959
Fashion Island!
Oh, everyone shut up.

1413
01:24:09,984 --> 01:24:12,122
Boy Band Island?
That's just a phase.

1414
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:16,291
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

1415
01:24:16,316 --> 01:24:17,586
Alright, here you go.

1416
01:24:17,611 --> 01:24:20,655
Your new expanded console
is up and running.

1417
01:24:20,683 --> 01:24:22,144
- Oh!
- Wow!

1418
01:24:22,169 --> 01:24:23,469
- Cool, upgrade.
- Woo.

1419
01:24:23,494 --> 01:24:25,916
Hey, ho ho!
Whoops, did I just do that?

1420
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:28,647
OK. Guys, what's 'pooberty'.

1421
01:24:28,672 --> 01:24:30,577
I dunno...
It's probably not important.

1422
01:24:30,602 --> 01:24:34,883
Wo-ho! I have access to the
entire curse word library.

1423
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:38,057
This new console is the
sh [beep] ...

1424
01:24:38,082 --> 01:24:39,791
Sorry, I did it again. My bad.

1425
01:24:39,823 --> 01:24:41,644
They're getting to the rink.

1426
01:24:42,131 --> 01:24:44,303
Now, when you get out there,
you be aggressive.

1427
01:24:44,328 --> 01:24:45,942
- I know Dad.
- Not too aggressive.

1428
01:24:45,967 --> 01:24:48,803
You know, you guys don't have
to come to every game.

1429
01:24:48,828 --> 01:24:50,980
Are you kidding?
I'm not missing one!

1430
01:24:51,005 --> 01:24:52,767
- Go Fog Horns!
- Go Riley!

1431
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:53,953
Foooogggg Hornnnns
- OK, OK,

1432
01:24:53,978 --> 01:24:55,234
Foooogggg Hornnnns
- I gotta go.

1433
01:24:55,259 --> 01:24:56,656
Foooogggg Hornnnns

1434
01:24:56,681 --> 01:24:57,792
- Oh.
- They love us.

1435
01:24:57,817 --> 01:24:59,496
Yeah, Mom and Dad are pretty cool.

1436
01:24:59,521 --> 01:25:03,043
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1437
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,266
Yeah!
Yeah!

1438
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:05,664
She loved the face painting.

1439
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:08,109
Told you it was a great idea.

1440
01:25:08,268 --> 01:25:11,767
- Best idea he's had in a while.
- He's a really good guy.

1441
01:25:11,792 --> 01:25:13,636
- Ah!
- Oh!

1442
01:25:16,509 --> 01:25:18,553
Just in case.

1443

Oh.

01:25:21,419 --> 01:25:23,071
Sorry.

- Aww!
- GIRL! GIRL!

1446
01:25:26,575 --> 01:25:28,814
- Oh oh!
- GIRL!

1447
01:25:31,455 --> 01:25:34,172
OK. Bye.

1448
01:25:38,272 --> 01:25:40,162
Hey Riley!

1449
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,167
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1450
01:25:45,195 --> 01:25:48,440
Alright.
Let's play some hockey!

1451

<i>Not for long!</i>

01:25:59,173 --> 01:26:01,113
<i>We've been through a lot
lately that's for sure.</i>

1457
01:26:01,138 --> 01:26:03,336

<i>Things couldn't be better!</i>

1460
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:10,251
<i>After all, Riley's 12 now.</i>

1461
01:26:10,276 --> 01:26:11,951

- Jordan.
- Uh...

How much more of this?

1467

5 months 2 weeks and 4 days
