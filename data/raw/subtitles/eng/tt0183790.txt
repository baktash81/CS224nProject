1
00:00:58,413 --> 00:00:59,681
Should we help him?

2
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:03,684
He's due in the lists in two minutes.
Two minutes or forfeit.

3
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:05,386
Lend us those.

4
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:08,388
Right. Left.

5
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,533
-Dead.
-Eh?

6
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,569
Three scores to none after two lances.

7
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:30,239
As long as Sir Ector doesn't
fall off his horse, we've won.

8
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,742
He's dead.

9
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,346
-What do you mean?
-His life's spark is covered in shite.

10
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,116
His spirit is gone
but his stench remains.

11
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:46,852
-Does that answer your question?
-No, no, no.

12
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:49,421
No, he sleeps. Rouse him.

13
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,690
I haven't eaten in three days!

14
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,191
None of us have!

15
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:57,761
-Let's fetch a priest.
-No, he's not dead!

16
00:01:58,094 --> 00:02:01,030
You wake up! Come on!

17
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:03,132
Come on!

18
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:07,202
You manky git!

19
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:09,937
Roland.

20
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,109
Squire, Sir Ector must report
at once or forfeit the match.

21
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,444
He's on his way.

22
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:23,181
I haven't eaten in three days!

23
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:25,616
Three days! What did you eat, mate?!

24
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,452
If you wasn't dead, I would kill you!

25
00:02:28,786 --> 00:02:30,554
I'll ride in his place.

26
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:34,957
Strip his armor.
I'm riding in his place.

27
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,294
Wat, stop kicking him!
I'm riding in his place. Help me.

28
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,496
What's your name, William?

29
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:46,900
William Thatcher, answer me
with your name.

30
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,903
It's not Sir William.

31
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,805
It's not Count or Duke or King William.

32
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,239
I know that.

33
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,609
You must be of noble birth to compete.

34
00:02:57,809 --> 00:03:01,979
A detail. The landscape is food.
Do you want to eat or not?

35
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:06,516
If the nobles find out,
there'll be the devil to pay.

36
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:09,418
Then pray that they don't.

37
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,433
Visor.

38
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,201
Come on, we're late.

39
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:32,299
The score stands at three lances
to none in favor of Sir Ector.

40
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,468
Lord Philip of Aragon.

41
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,569
Stand ye ready?

42
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:41,907
Sir Ector. Stand ye ready?

43
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:43,975
Ready?

44
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:46,410
I tilted against Sir Ector many times.

45
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:49,480
In practice as his target.
You never struck him.

46
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:53,249
-Badger me not with details.
-The landscape. Stay on the horse.

47
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:57,152
He needs 3 points.
He has to knock you off the horse.

48
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:59,654
I know how to score, Roland.

49
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:03,324
I've waited my whole life
for this moment.

50
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:06,660
For Sir Ector to shite himself
to death?

51
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:46,992
Get it in the cradle. In the cradle.

52
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:48,627
Get it in the cradle!

53
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:11,645
William, are you alive?

54
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,147
-We won! We won!
-Can you hear me?

55
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:18,484
Get off me! William, can you hear me?

56
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:20,819
We won!

57
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:23,588
He's breathing. He's breathing!

58
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:26,757
Sir Ector.

59
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:34,764
Sir Ector. Remove your helmet.

60
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:42,937
My lord, the final blow of the lance
has bent it onto my head.

61
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:45,272
He says the final blow of the--

62
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:49,609
I present your champion, my lord.

63
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:17,064
Twenty.

64
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:18,566
No, 10.

65
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,301
-Fifteen.
-Done.

66
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,573
Very good. Cheers.

67
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,145
Fifteen silver florins.
He didn't want that.

68
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,147
That's five for William.

69
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:41,651
Five for Wat. Five for Roland,
who's going home to England.

70
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:45,387
Straight to the pub for me.
Eel pie, brie tart...

71
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:48,489
...tansy cakes with peppermint cream.

72
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,461
We could do this.

73
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:57,330
We've done it, boy.
That's silver in your hand.

74
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:01,166
No, I mean, we can do this.
We can be champions.

75
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,171
Give us your coins.

76
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:12,609
Give me your coins.

77
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:18,347
Now, that's one for you.

78
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:21,516
And one...for you.

79
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:24,452
Which leaves 13.

80
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:27,521
That's 13 for training
and outfitting.

81
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:30,723
The tournament in Rouen is in a month.

82
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:33,192
We could split a bigger prize.

83
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:38,363
In one month we'd be on our way
to glory and riches.

84
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:44,134
Or lying in a ditch with Sir Ector.
William, I just want to go home.

85
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:48,871
Tansy cakes. Dilled veal balls.
I'll take my five now.

86
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,144
Oh, wait up.

87
00:09:57,678 --> 00:09:59,847
You're going the wrong way!

88
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:02,582
You can't even joust.

89
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,585
Most of it is the guts to take a blow.
Guts I have.

90
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:10,255
And technique?
I have a month to learn that.

91
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:13,558
And name a man better
with a sword than I am.

92
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:17,361
-In the practice ring.
-You're not of noble birth.

93
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:19,095
So, we lie.

94
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:22,932
How did the nobles become noble
in the first place?

95
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:27,936
They took it at the tip of a sword.
I'll do it with a lance.

96
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,838
-A blunted lance.
-No matter, Wat.

97
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:35,942
A man can change his stars. I won't
spend the rest of my life as nothing.

98
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,946
That is nothing. And that's
where glory will take us.

99
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,616
We're peasants. Glory and riches
are beyond our grasp.

100
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:48,552
But a full stomach?
That dream can come true.

101
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,796
If you can take your coins,
go eat cake in England.

102
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,299
But if you can't, you come with me.

103
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,806
You see? Money doesn't matter.

104
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,185
See how hungry I am?!

105
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:31,653
-Do you?!
-Damn your stomach, Wat!

106
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:35,657
Roland, please.

107
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:42,662
With 13 silver pieces,
three men can change their stars.

108
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,004
God love you, William.

109
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:55,606
I know, I know. No one else will.

110
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,118
Unlucky.

111
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,187
-I think he's getting worse.
-He is getting worse.

112
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:30,033
Switch.

113
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:37,740
Switch.

114
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,209
Glory and riches. Glory and riches!

115
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:54,353
You see how dangerous it is?

116
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:59,257
Faster! Faster!
All right, use those legs!

117
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:02,259
Come on, Roland. Faster! Faster!

118
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:05,929
You missed it.

119
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,931
You've done it dozens of times.

120
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:12,267
Well, I guess that means
we should do it again.

121
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:15,937
Come on.

122
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:19,606
Come on, ponies.

123
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,108
Fong him.

124
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:27,780
Faster. Balance.

125
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:30,615
No, slower. Keep it steady.

126
00:13:34,351 --> 00:13:36,120
I got it! Look, I got it!

127
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,398
Any minute now.

128
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,092
-Yes, better.
-Nice.

129
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:34,233
-It's my turn to ride.
-No.

130
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:37,135
We haven't reached the marker.
And you shouldn't.

131
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:41,438
How would it look if my squire rode
while I walked?

132
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:46,242
I don't give a witch's teat!
It's my turn! It's my turn!

133
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:51,080
Maybe nobody should ride.
The horse is not what he used to be.

134
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:53,915
Fine. Fine.

135
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:57,418
Morning.

136
00:14:58,452 --> 00:14:59,586
Morning.

137
00:14:59,953 --> 00:15:01,254
Hoy, sir.

138
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:08,193
What are you doing?

139
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:10,962
Uh...trudging.

140
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:16,533
You know, trudging? To trudge?

141
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,235
To trudge the slow, weary...

142
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:23,339
...depressing, yet determined walk
of a man who had nothing left...

143
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:27,208
...except the impulse to simply
soldier on.

144
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:29,310
Were you robbed?

145
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:32,579
Interesting question. Yes.

146
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,582
And at the same time,
a huge, resounding, "No."

147
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:40,085
It's more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty, really.

148
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:43,922
But on the brighter side,
trudging does represent pride.

149
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:47,925
Pride, resolve and faith
in the good Lord Almighty.

150
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,927
Please, Christ, rescue me
from my tribu-...

151
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,097
...-lations.

152
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:57,166
Who are you?

153
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:01,603
Lilium inter spinas.

154
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,105
The lily among the thorns.

155
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:07,107
Geoffrey Chaucer's the name.
Writing's the game.

156
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:15,347
Chaucer?

157
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:18,349
Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer?

158
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:25,021
-A what?
-"A what?" A writer.

159
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:30,359
I write with ink and parchment.
For a penny, I'll scribble anything.

160
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:35,029
Summonses, decrees, edicts,
warrants, patents of nobility.

161
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:39,033
I've been known to jot down
a poem, if the muse descends.

162
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,302
You probably read my book,
The Book of the Duchess.

163
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,872
Well, it was allegorical.

164
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:51,142
We won't hold it against you.
Each man decides that for himself.

165
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,478
Did you say patents of nobility?

166
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:58,648
That's right. I did.

167
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:03,719
And you gentlemen are?

168
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,489
I am Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

169
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,227
These are my faithful squires,
Delves of Dodgington...

170
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:17,830
...and Fowlehurst of Crewe.

171
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:21,233
I'm Richard the Lionheart.
A pleasure.

172
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,868
No, I'm Charlemagne!
John the Baptist!

173
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,403
All right!

174
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:28,405
Hold your tongue, sir, or lose it.

175
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:33,243
Now you see that, I do believe...

176
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:35,077
...Sir Ulrich.

177
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:37,746
Thank you...

178
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:39,381
...Geoff.

179
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:45,853
Have you any more to say, Master Nude,
or may we be on our way?

180
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:49,756
-Off to the tournament?
-This is the road to Rouen.

181
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,860
That remains to be seen.
They're limiting the field at Rouen.

182
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,431
Noble birth must be established
for four generations on either side.

183
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:04,034
Patents of nobility must be provided.

184
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,310
Listen, clothe me...

185
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,280
...shoe me, for God's sake, feed me
and you'll have your patents.

186
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:22,982
No.

187
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,319
-Patents of nobility.
-We need him. We need him.

188
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:30,588
-Let me handle it.
-Be nice.

189
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,160
Nice, nice, nice.

190
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,496
All right.

191
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:45,500
Betray us and I will fong you
until your insides are out...

192
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:50,504
...your outsides are in and your
entrails are your extrails.

193
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:57,777
Pain.

194
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:00,846
Lots of pain.

195
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,857
I present Sir Ulrich, whose mother's
father was Shilhard von Rechberg...

196
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:19,961
...son of the Duke Guelph of Saxony,
son of Ghibellines, son of Wendish.

197
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:23,297
-Wendish inherited the fief--
-That'll do, herald.

198
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:27,367
Six generations is more than enough.
Show me the patents.

199
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:41,145
Indicate in which events
shall your Lord Ulrich compete.

200
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:47,884
He'll first meet Roger Lord Mortimer.

201
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:50,219
Thank you very much.

202
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,396
I can't believe it.
You did it, Chaucer.

203
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,499
I thank you. I didn't think
we had a chance.

204
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:12,236
My pleasure, William.

205
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,905
If you don't mind, I'll stick around.

206
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,741
Be my herald, you'll
get part of the winnings.

207
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:22,278
Done. Now if you don't mind,
I have to see a man about a dog.

208
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:28,449
Walking out from Cheapside

209
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,785
My fortunes for to seek

210
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:35,121
I passed along the River Thames

211
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:38,457
Its waters did they reek

212
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:42,928
'Twas there I met a pretty lass

213
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:46,130
She said her name was Nell

214
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,009
Bell or hell rhymes with Nell.

215
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:00,056
Would you speak to me?

216
00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:03,225
Ah, to speak.

217
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,229
Sir, my sex are marked
by their silence.

218
00:22:08,563 --> 00:22:11,232
I would hear you speak
if it cost me my ears.

219
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:14,568
That is well, for I do not
want silence in my life.

220
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,769
Tell me your name.

221
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,507
-Would you care if I were ugly?
-Yes!

222
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,910
I mean, no. I mean--

223
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,079
You desecrate the house of God!

224
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,793
Tell me your name.

225
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:50,129
And what would you do
with my name, Sir Hunter?

226
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:53,465
Call me a fox, for
that is all I am to you.

227
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:59,470
Then a fox you shall be until
I find your name, my foxy lady.

228
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,143
He's a handsome hunter.
I give him that.

229
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,145
Does this not shock you, ladies?

230
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:13,648
Certainly, my lord.

231
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:18,319
I only laugh just
to keep from weeping.

232
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:22,689
Beauty is such a curse.

233
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,092
Pray your years come swiftly.

234
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:29,428
Pray your beauty fades
so you may better serve God.

235
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:33,798
Oh, I do, my lord. I pray for it all
the time.

236
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:38,535
Why, God, did you curse me
with this face?

237
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:43,706
God's will has a purpose,
but we may not know it.

238
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:49,644
Well, that is lovely.

239
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:23,671
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein...

240
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:29,342
...defeats Roger Lord Mortimer
one lance to none.

241
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:34,780
Easy. They'll think I
never broke a lance before.

242
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:39,450
-But you haven't!
-Ulrich's broken thousands of lances.

243
00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:42,519
Come on. You're due
in the sword ring.

244
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:44,554
My armor's loose.

245
00:24:53,228 --> 00:24:55,496
Shite. I can't block an overhead.

246
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,333
We can't fix it now.
We're overdue in the sword ring.

247
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,903
It was a mistake to do two events.
I'm too hurried.

248
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:07,740
-I'll withdraw from the sword.
-Sword's what you're best at.

249
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,409
But the prizes and prestige
are bigger in the joust.

250
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,912
Ulrich von Lichtenstein?
I am Simon the Summoner.

251
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:18,181
I'm overdue at the sword ring.

252
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:22,418
I must detain you
on behalf of your herald.

253
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:24,920
You were never robbed.

254
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:30,358
I have a gambling problem.

255
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:33,260
I can't help myself.

256
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:36,429
And these people will...

257
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:40,032
...literally take the clothes
off your back.

258
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:43,435
What are we supposed to do?

259
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:48,105
He assured us that you,
his liege, would pay us.

260
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:53,776
And who are you?

261
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,112
Peter, a humble pardoner...

262
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:59,915
...and purveyor of religious relics.

263
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:02,717
How much does he owe?

264
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:05,853
Ten gold florins.

265
00:26:07,154 --> 00:26:08,855
You manky git!

266
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:13,292
-Pain! Pain! Take the pain!
-Get him off me!

267
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:15,394
Wat, let him go!

268
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,671
What would you do to him
if I was to refuse?

269
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,842
We, on behalf of the Lord God...

270
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:38,846
...will take it from his flesh
so that he may understand...

271
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,515
...that gambling is a sin.

272
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:46,519
Oh, come on.

273
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,854
Please, Will.

274
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:55,192
Please, will you help me,
Sir Ulrich?

275
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,029
I promise you won't regret it.

276
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:03,432
I don't have the money.

277
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,404
Release him...

278
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:13,874
...and give him back his clothes.

279
00:27:15,642 --> 00:27:17,410
And you'll get it.

280
00:27:17,977 --> 00:27:18,878
Done.

281
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:24,549
You lied.

282
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:29,553
Yes, I lied. I'm a writer.
I give the truth scope!

283
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:33,890
Behold my Lord
Ulrich von Lichtenstein, son of--

284
00:27:34,223 --> 00:27:36,725
-Too late. He's been announced.
-Fine.

285
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:40,595
Ten blows by sword.
Sir Ulrich to receive first.

286
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:48,568
Strike!

287
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,676
Strike!

288
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:00,244
Stop letting him hit you!

289
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:02,413
Shut up! Shut up!

290
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:07,083
Two strikes for Sir Walter Loring!

291
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,585
Sir Ulrich to strike!

292
00:28:10,352 --> 00:28:12,087
-Now it's your turn!
-Come on!

293
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:26,932
Strike!

294
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:30,935
I taught him that!
That's me!

295
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:34,939
Sir Ulrich prevails,
five strikes to two!

296
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:37,741
Yes!

297
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:42,812
Behold my Lord Ulrich!
The rock! The hard place!

298
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:45,947
Like a wind from Gelderland,
he sweeps by!

299
00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:50,284
Blown far from his homeland
in search of glory and honor!

300
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:54,955
We walk in the garden
of his turbulence!

301
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,595
Yeah!

302
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:32,566
-You're champion.
-Of the sword.

303
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,068
Isn't that why we're here? Come on.

304
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:38,738
Do you want to touch him?
Do you want to touch him?

305
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:57,252
We should've saved our money
for the blacksmith.

306
00:30:58,253 --> 00:30:59,621
I can't pay you now...

307
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:03,424
-...but I promise I will, just as--
-No! Money.

308
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,430
-Excuse me.
-Cash first, not promises.

309
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:13,699
Go on.

310
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,435
Excuse me, sir.

311
00:31:18,436 --> 00:31:20,771
You might try the farris.

312
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:23,440
A woman?

313
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:26,776
Beggars cannot be choosers, my lord.

314
00:31:29,645 --> 00:31:30,946
Thank you.

315
00:31:32,314 --> 00:31:35,250
-Excuse me.
-I don't work for free.

316
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:39,620
-I can't joust with broken armor.
-That's your problem, not mine.

317
00:31:40,654 --> 00:31:43,590
Each drop of this sweat
has a price on it.

318
00:31:46,492 --> 00:31:49,828
Just as well. They told me
I was daft to even ask.

319
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:53,965
-Who?
-The other armorers.

320
00:31:57,267 --> 00:32:00,103
Did they say I couldn't do it
because I'm a woman?

321
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,606
They said you're good
with horseshoes, not armor.

322
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,274
No one mentioned you being a woman.

323
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,012
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

324
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,481
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

325
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:33,863
Lady, I will win
this tournament for you.

326
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,132
Nay! I will win for you.

327
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:38,133
May I present Count Adhemar...

328
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:42,203
...winner of the joust in France
and champion at Saint-Emilion.

329
00:32:44,872 --> 00:32:49,876
All forgotten when standing before the
most beautiful woman in Christendom.

330
00:32:55,214 --> 00:33:00,218
Do you only pretend to fight, Count
Adhemar, or wage real war as well?

331
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:06,056
I am leader of the free companies.
My army is in southern France.

332
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:11,060
Geoff, 'tis my lady.

333
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:15,897
-William, you aim too high.
-I don't know any other way to aim.

334
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,400
-Concentrate.
-What should I say to her?

335
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,774
What do you think of the joust?

336
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,276
It's very abrupt.

337
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,446
And I don't understand the rules.

338
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,114
Then I shall educate you.

339
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:41,951
A match is three lances.

340
00:33:43,118 --> 00:33:47,889
One point is given for breaking
a lance between the waist and neck.

341
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:51,292
Two points for breaking on the helmet.
It's difficult.

342
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:55,629
The helmet sweeps back.
Most blows glance off.

343
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:59,565
Three points for bearing a rider
to the ground.

344
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:03,135
Also, if you bear a rider
to the ground, you win his horse.

345
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:05,803
Do men die in the joust?

346
00:34:06,137 --> 00:34:09,573
Lance points are tipped
with coronals, which blunts them.

347
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,976
Of course, accidents happen.

348
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:17,313
I myself, Jocelyn,
have never been unhorsed.

349
00:34:18,513 --> 00:34:20,148
Nor have I.

350
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,251
Your name, lady.

351
00:34:24,785 --> 00:34:26,587
I still need to hear it.

352
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:29,756
Sir Hunter, you persist.

353
00:34:30,189 --> 00:34:33,826
Perhaps angels have no names.
Only beautiful faces.

354
00:34:37,295 --> 00:34:38,630
And you are?

355
00:34:39,864 --> 00:34:41,198
I am, um....

356
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:42,766
Have you forgotten?

357
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:44,901
Or your name is Sir "Um."

358
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:49,538
Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

359
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:52,341
I'd forget as well. What a mouthful.

360
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,810
-Your armor, sir.
-What about it?

361
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:01,048
How stylish of you to wear an antique.
You'll start a new fashion if you win.

362
00:35:01,381 --> 00:35:04,717
My grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again.

363
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:08,220
And a shield. How quaint.

364
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:22,998
Some of these poor country knights,
little better than peasants.

365
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,567
--the second son...

366
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:29,570
...of Sir Wallace Percival,
third Earl of Warwick.

367
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:32,606
My lords, my ladies...

368
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:36,409
...it is with honor
I introduce my liege...

369
00:35:37,243 --> 00:35:38,911
...Sir Thomas Colville.

370
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,752
You're good.

371
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:50,420
You're very good.

372
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:53,256
My lords...

373
00:35:53,923 --> 00:35:55,491
...my ladies...

374
00:35:59,094 --> 00:36:02,830
...and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion...

375
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:11,604
...today...

376
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,374
...you find yourselves equals.

377
00:36:22,946 --> 00:36:26,449
For you are all equally blessed.

378
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:29,952
For I have the pride...

379
00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:33,121
...the privilege, nay, the pleasure...

380
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:38,459
...of introducing to you
a knight sired by knights.

381
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:42,228
A knight who can trace
his lineage back...

382
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:45,131
...beyond Charlemagne.

383
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:48,934
I first met him...

384
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:51,369
...atop a mountain near Jerusalem...

385
00:36:51,703 --> 00:36:53,804
...praying to God...

386
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:57,641
...asking his forgiveness
for the Saracen blood...

387
00:36:57,974 --> 00:36:59,909
...spilt by his sword.

388
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:03,312
Next, he amazed me
still further in Italy...

389
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,647
...when he saved a fatherless
beauty...

390
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:09,584
...from the would-be ravishings
of her dreadful uncle.

391
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,824
In Greece...

392
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:22,527
...he spent a year in silence...

393
00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:27,498
...just to better understand
the sound...

394
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,668
...of a whisper.

395
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:41,876
So without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado...

396
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,879
...I give to you
the Seeker of Serenity...

397
00:37:45,212 --> 00:37:47,881
...Protector of Italian Virginity...

398
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:53,052
...the Enforcer of our Lord God,
the one, the only...

399
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:57,389
...Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

400
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:13,902
Thank you! Thank you!
I'll be here all week.

401
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,275
That was different.

402
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:24,644
It's time we celebrated
our differences.

403
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,845
Just maybe not in public.

404
00:38:27,846 --> 00:38:28,914
You....

405
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:32,917
Yes, I'm well aware
a good fonging is on the way.

406
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:35,085
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

407
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:38,521
I got their attention.
You win their hearts.

408
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,106
Very good.

409
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,275
-Was she watching? Geoff.
-What?

410
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,610
-Did she see me?
-Yes, she did.

411
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,112
-Did she see me take the hit?
-Yes.

412
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,381
-Was she concerned?
-Her eyes welled up. Just awful.

413
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:30,129
Colville has perfect technique.
I've never seen him before.

414
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:31,797
Nor I.

415
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:34,033
But this Lichtenstein.

416
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:37,469
His technique, rudimentary.
Style, nonexistent.

417
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:40,137
Still, he's fearless.

418
00:39:41,472 --> 00:39:43,473
Fearless? How so?

419
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:47,643
The slit in the visor is narrow,
but splinters can penetrate it.

420
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,913
Most knights raise their chins
at the last instant.

421
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:56,150
You lose sight of your opponent, but
protect your eyes. Ulrich doesn't.

422
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:58,986
He keeps his eye on the target.

423
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:01,821
A true hunter.

424
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:13,331
Sir Ulrich...

425
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,166
...l'm through.

426
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:20,703
But I've never not finished before.

427
00:40:21,537 --> 00:40:25,007
I wish to keep my honor intact.

428
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:52,729
A draw. And Colville is hurt.

429
00:41:01,402 --> 00:41:05,072
Colville withdraws. Ulrich advances.

430
00:41:06,406 --> 00:41:08,241
Why didn't Ulrich finish him?

431
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:10,743
He shows mercy.

432
00:41:12,578 --> 00:41:16,748
Then he shows his weakness.
That's all mercy is.

433
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,588
For the love of victory, William,
go to sleep.

434
00:41:27,757 --> 00:41:29,091
I can't.

435
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,262
Love has given me wings,
so I must fly.

436
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:38,699
I can't explain it.

437
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,337
-She makes me feel like a poet.
-You may feel like a poet...

438
00:41:44,537 --> 00:41:46,172
...but you sound like an idiot.

439
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:49,274
-You don't even know her name.
-Her name?

440
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,444
Her name is Aphrodite.

441
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:57,447
Calypso. Venus. Take your pick.

442
00:42:02,118 --> 00:42:04,453
Women weaken the heart.

443
00:42:05,954 --> 00:42:08,623
Without your heart, you cannot win.

444
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:14,728
-But her eyes--
-Concentrate.

445
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:16,463
Tansy cakes!

446
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:21,633
Count Adhemar sends word.

447
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:26,137
He said he will win
this tournament for you.

448
00:42:26,971 --> 00:42:31,141
He's won many. He wins them
for himself and his own honor.

449
00:42:31,408 --> 00:42:33,810
It's nothing to say
he wins them for me.

450
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,980
He wishes to speak to you again.

451
00:42:38,513 --> 00:42:40,615
Not to hear a word I say.

452
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:44,251
Adhemar wants his women silent.

453
00:42:50,023 --> 00:42:53,259
Would you have Sir Ulrich
win the tournament for you?

454
00:42:53,525 --> 00:42:54,827
No.

455
00:42:56,027 --> 00:42:59,363
And he is the only knight
who has not promised to do so.

456
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:03,834
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

457
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:07,170
I would have him win my heart.

458
00:43:16,044 --> 00:43:19,513
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

459
00:43:23,716 --> 00:43:25,384
Oh, lovely.

460
00:43:26,385 --> 00:43:29,855
I don't think I've ever seen
Count Adhemar lose.

461
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:33,357
No, but defeat him
and you'll see it firsthand.

462
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:36,593
My liege.

463
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:39,729
Sir Ulrich.

464
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:43,065
Christiana.

465
00:43:43,732 --> 00:43:47,736
-My lady bids you wear this token.
-Of course.

466
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:51,072
She also said to tell you, her name...

467
00:43:53,073 --> 00:43:54,941
...is Jocelyn.

468
00:43:57,643 --> 00:43:59,178
-Au revoir.
-Au revoir.

469
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,347
Oh, Jocelyn.

470
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,418
Concentrate.

471
00:45:30,017 --> 00:45:31,485
I can't breathe.

472
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:41,160
No style whatsoever.

473
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:44,496
But neither has an anvil.

474
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,867
-He hits like a hammer. Amazing.
-But not perfect. He aims high.

475
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:52,836
Roll your shoulder back,
his blow may go right.

476
00:45:53,136 --> 00:45:56,105
But if he strikes to my left,
I'll be obliterated.

477
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:58,473
I didn't say it wasn't a gamble.

478
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:42,742
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

479
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:35,618
William?

480
00:47:43,457 --> 00:47:44,959
William, here.

481
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,794
Come here.

482
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:59,303
Someday I'll be a knight.

483
00:48:00,805 --> 00:48:03,140
A thatcher's son? A knight?

484
00:48:03,473 --> 00:48:06,309
You might as well try
to change the stars.

485
00:48:08,144 --> 00:48:09,979
Can it be done, Father?

486
00:48:10,312 --> 00:48:13,815
-Can a man change the stars?
-Yes, William.

487
00:48:14,115 --> 00:48:17,084
If he believes enough,
a man can do anything.

488
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:38,201
Come here.

489
00:48:45,707 --> 00:48:48,176
Gain more bearing, Ulrich.

490
00:48:48,876 --> 00:48:50,845
See me again when you're worthy.

491
00:48:56,216 --> 00:48:58,050
I'll fong you in the arse!

492
00:48:59,385 --> 00:49:02,054
Well done, my lord! Well done.

493
00:49:02,387 --> 00:49:04,689
-You bastard!
-Go and see to Ulrich.

494
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:06,724
Go see to Ulrich.

495
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:12,062
Well done, my lord.

496
00:49:12,562 --> 00:49:14,230
A noble victory.

497
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:22,904
My lady, I believe this is yours.

498
00:49:29,242 --> 00:49:31,911
For long spear on foot...

499
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:34,746
...Pandolfo Malatesta.

500
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:44,254
For sword on foot,
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

501
00:49:48,924 --> 00:49:53,762
Finally, for the mounted joust
and tournament champion...

502
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:56,931
...Adhemar, Count of Anjou.

503
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:01,434
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

504
00:50:04,103 --> 00:50:08,140
I present to you your champions.

505
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:17,614
Next time, you will look up
at me from the flat of your back.

506
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:21,884
Please. You have been weighed,
you have been measured...

507
00:50:22,118 --> 00:50:24,153
...and you have been found wanting.

508
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:34,061
Keep winning the sword.

509
00:50:34,294 --> 00:50:36,729
-I won't compete in it.
-lt's your best.

510
00:50:36,963 --> 00:50:39,632
No. It's tournament champion
or nothing at all.

511
00:50:45,136 --> 00:50:47,638
Ten florins. That should do.

512
00:50:50,474 --> 00:50:54,143
Sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.
Do you feel lucky?

513
00:50:54,477 --> 00:50:58,647
-Have you enough clothes?
-Be gone. I'm done with you.

514
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:01,983
Except to exact my revenge.

515
00:51:04,518 --> 00:51:07,988
What on earth could you
possibly do to us?

516
00:51:08,355 --> 00:51:10,657
I will eviscerate you in fiction.

517
00:51:11,023 --> 00:51:14,326
Every last pimple,
every last character flaw.

518
00:51:14,693 --> 00:51:18,997
I was naked for a day.
You will be naked for eternity.

519
00:51:19,864 --> 00:51:22,333
I have a feeling we shall meet again.

520
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:27,837
Here, farris, take what we owe you.

521
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:33,008
The armor you wear, it wasn't
made for you, was it?

522
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:34,876
So?

523
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,679
I could make armor you wouldn't
even know you wore it.

524
00:51:38,979 --> 00:51:40,314
What's the cost?

525
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:44,117
Just take me as far as Paris.

526
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:47,986
We travel alone.
Take your gold and go.

527
00:51:56,393 --> 00:52:00,897
-Get what you can. Let's pack.
-Why are we leaving so soon?

528
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:06,234
The next tournament is in a week.
We can walk now and save the horse.

529
00:52:06,568 --> 00:52:10,004
You must go to the banquet.
You'll dance and make an appearance.

530
00:52:10,238 --> 00:52:12,406
Let Adhemar laugh at me again?
No!

531
00:52:12,673 --> 00:52:14,674
-Yes!
-No!

532
00:52:20,913 --> 00:52:24,416
My lady would know the color
of your lord's tunic tonight.

533
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:29,253
-His tunic?
-Yes, so she can dress to match him.

534
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:33,189
We regret to inform your lady
he won't be attending--

535
00:52:33,423 --> 00:52:36,926
-Herald, do not give my answers!
-Yes, my lord.

536
00:52:37,192 --> 00:52:38,760
Squire, answer her.

537
00:52:39,094 --> 00:52:42,764
What color is my tunic tonight?

538
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:48,268
Green.

539
00:52:50,436 --> 00:52:52,204
Trimmed in a kind of...

540
00:52:52,438 --> 00:52:54,273
...pale green...

541
00:52:56,108 --> 00:52:57,442
...with...

542
00:52:57,776 --> 00:52:59,944
...uh, wooden toggles.

543
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,447
I will tell my lady.

544
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:13,722
-This is a disaster!
-No, it'll tunic up quite nicely.

545
00:53:13,955 --> 00:53:15,957
That's not a disaster, Roland.

546
00:53:19,793 --> 00:53:21,461
I don't know how to dance.

547
00:53:23,963 --> 00:53:27,633
And one and two and three and four.

548
00:53:27,966 --> 00:53:31,302
Your hand should be light,
like a birdie on a branch.

549
00:53:31,636 --> 00:53:35,139
And one, two and three and four.

550
00:53:35,472 --> 00:53:38,642
And Wat doesn't lead,
he follows like a girl.

551
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,819
And one and two and...

552
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:53,820
...twirly, twirly, twirly.

553
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:57,323
And one and two, and you're
still getting it wrong.

554
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,326
And one and two
and three and four.

555
00:54:01,693 --> 00:54:04,996
You can hit me all day
because you punch like a what?

556
00:54:05,296 --> 00:54:06,497
A girl.

557
00:54:06,864 --> 00:54:08,832
-Enough!
-Get back! Wat, quiet!

558
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:11,401
-He starts it.
-You know he's touchy!

559
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,838
Oh, and you can do better?

560
00:54:16,372 --> 00:54:19,207
-Of course.
-Then show us.

561
00:54:20,308 --> 00:54:21,876
No.

562
00:54:23,544 --> 00:54:28,114
If I'm making all this effort,
you'd best ask her nicely.

563
00:54:32,718 --> 00:54:33,786
I'm sorry, Kate.

564
00:54:38,056 --> 00:54:42,026
I was wondering if you'd care
to show us how to dance.

565
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,327
-Please.
-Please.

566
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,233
And one and two, three and four.

567
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:54,569
Five, six, seven, change partners.

568
00:54:54,903 --> 00:54:58,239
And one, two, three, four...

569
00:54:58,572 --> 00:55:01,007
...five, six, seven.

570
00:55:01,241 --> 00:55:03,076
Polonaise. And one....

571
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,412
Are you wearing your hair like that?

572
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:09,214
Is there another way?

573
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:42,307
Sir Ulrich, you look fantastic.

574
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,411
Jocelyn, you look....

575
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,314
Uh, you...

576
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,252
...remind me of the Bible.

577
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:06,326
When God stopped the sun to give
Joshua time to defeat the Amorites.

578
00:56:09,929 --> 00:56:11,330
I don't understand.

579
00:56:16,334 --> 00:56:19,003
If I could ask God one thing...

580
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,939
...it would be to stop the moon.

581
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,676
Stop the moon and make this night...

582
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,678
...and your beauty...

583
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:32,014
...last forever.

584
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:37,518
What dance will you have? A coranto?

585
00:56:38,552 --> 00:56:40,520
Or a basse dance?

586
00:56:41,555 --> 00:56:43,022
Sir Ulrich.

587
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:47,960
Why don't you show us a dance
of your country?

588
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:51,029
Show us a dance of Gelderland.

589
00:56:53,064 --> 00:56:55,199
Yes. Gelderland.

590
00:56:59,402 --> 00:57:02,238
Well, it's a lot like the farandole...

591
00:57:03,572 --> 00:57:06,408
...but with some differences.

592
00:57:07,575 --> 00:57:09,544
Well, you bow.

593
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:15,382
And...

594
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:28,759
...and....

595
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,939
Places. Places.

596
01:00:54,624 --> 01:00:55,791
What?

597
01:00:57,126 --> 01:01:02,463
-I don't know. Too small, too light.
-He'll be crushed. Killed.

598
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:07,434
No. I found a new way to heat steel.
It's thinner, smaller...

599
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:09,302
...but just as strong.

600
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:10,737
What are these?

601
01:01:11,137 --> 01:01:14,807
The marks of my trade should
another knight admire the armor.

602
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:20,645
Twist and bend. Feel the movement.

603
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:25,582
-But eventually I will be struck.
-And then death.

604
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,985
Do you at least have the courage
to test it?

605
01:01:38,425 --> 01:01:39,426
You okay?

606
01:01:40,994 --> 01:01:42,662
I didn't feel a thing.

607
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,686
-Who's that knight?
-Piers Courtenay.

608
01:02:12,986 --> 01:02:17,190
He's raised taxes on his land 3 times
this year to pay for tournament.

609
01:02:17,423 --> 01:02:20,226
His people starve while
he sits at banquet.

610
01:02:23,928 --> 01:02:24,896
It's probably true.

611
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:03,026
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

612
01:03:03,527 --> 01:03:06,196
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

613
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:09,198
The Count Adhemar...

614
01:03:09,865 --> 01:03:11,867
...son of Philippe de Vitry...

615
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,369
...son of Gilles...

616
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,871
...master of the free companies...

617
01:03:17,471 --> 01:03:20,307
...defender of his enormous manhood...

618
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:23,543
...a shining example of chivalry...

619
01:03:23,876 --> 01:03:25,711
...and champagne.

620
01:03:30,215 --> 01:03:31,716
Nice work!

621
01:03:33,217 --> 01:03:34,552
Bravo!

622
01:03:37,988 --> 01:03:41,157
Watch every move Adhemar makes.
We'll find a weakness.

623
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,058
Well, Colville looks fit.

624
01:03:43,392 --> 01:03:44,593
--my liege...

625
01:03:44,793 --> 01:03:47,529
...the second son of
Sir Wallace Percival.

626
01:03:47,729 --> 01:03:50,564
It is my deepest honor--

627
01:03:54,067 --> 01:03:56,336
My deepest honor to present to you....

628
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,072
It's Edward, my lord.
They're sure of it.

629
01:04:03,074 --> 01:04:06,577
--the illustrious Sir Thomas Colville!

630
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:24,091
Adhemar withdrew.

631
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:26,927
To withdraw like that means one thing.

632
01:04:28,094 --> 01:04:29,262
Royalty.

633
01:04:39,604 --> 01:04:41,605
I'll see what I can find out.

634
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,108
Prepare to drop the flag.

635
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:48,211
No, no. Not yet. Wait, listen.

636
01:04:48,444 --> 01:04:50,112
Musicians, announce.

637
01:04:50,379 --> 01:04:53,848
-I must speak with my lord.
-Then go.

638
01:04:54,049 --> 01:04:56,617
See if you can beat the Second Coming.

639
01:04:57,651 --> 01:04:59,286
Wait! Wait!

640
01:05:01,088 --> 01:05:05,458
Colville is Edward, the Black
Prince, future king of England.

641
01:05:05,825 --> 01:05:08,160
He's in disguise like me
so he can compete.

642
01:05:08,393 --> 01:05:12,130
He's never met an enemy without
victory or town he couldn't defeat.

643
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:14,398
We're English! We know who he is!

644
01:05:14,665 --> 01:05:18,001
-You must withdraw. Tell them, Geoff.
-Absolutely!

645
01:05:18,268 --> 01:05:19,169
The lance.

646
01:05:26,675 --> 01:05:28,009
Give me the lance.

647
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:36,683
Lance!

648
01:05:50,861 --> 01:05:53,029
Oh, my giddy aunt.

649
01:05:57,366 --> 01:05:59,868
The match is a draw.

650
01:06:03,037 --> 01:06:05,639
You mad? You endanger
a royal family member.

651
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:08,041
He endangers himself.

652
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:11,377
Well fought, Sir Ulrich, as in Rouen.

653
01:06:13,379 --> 01:06:15,147
You also, Prince Edward.

654
01:06:20,484 --> 01:06:21,485
You knew me?

655
01:06:26,723 --> 01:06:27,890
And still you rode?

656
01:06:29,058 --> 01:06:33,061
-lt's not in me to withdraw.
-No. Nor me.

657
01:06:35,663 --> 01:06:37,331
Though it happens.

658
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:40,734
Yes, it does.

659
01:06:43,403 --> 01:06:46,572
-Good luck to you.
-You also.

660
01:06:49,074 --> 01:06:53,244
The winner of the mounted joust and
tournament champion...

661
01:06:53,578 --> 01:06:55,846
...Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

662
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:05,254
-Melt it, sell it, do whatever you do.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

663
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,688
You're champion!

664
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,924
I'm not champion until
I defeat Adhemar. He withdrew.

665
01:07:10,258 --> 01:07:11,592
Sir Ulrich.

666
01:07:12,926 --> 01:07:16,763
-Tell me what you'll wear tonight.
-Nothing.

667
01:07:17,096 --> 01:07:19,932
We'll cause a sensation,
for I'll dress to match.

668
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:22,701
Don't you get tired
of putting on clothes?

669
01:07:22,934 --> 01:07:25,436
She's talking about taking them off.

670
01:07:27,271 --> 01:07:30,274
A flower is only as good
as its petals, no?

671
01:07:30,607 --> 01:07:32,275
A flower is good for nothing.

672
01:07:34,777 --> 01:07:35,945
Really?

673
01:07:36,779 --> 01:07:39,781
You can't eat a flower.
It doesn't keep you warm.

674
01:07:40,048 --> 01:07:43,551
And a rose never knocked
a man off a horse either, did it?

675
01:07:45,919 --> 01:07:48,555
You're just a silly girl, aren't you?

676
01:07:51,824 --> 01:07:56,628
Better a silly girl with a flower than
a silly boy with a horse and stick.

677
01:08:01,332 --> 01:08:02,633
Goodbye.

678
01:08:06,836 --> 01:08:08,804
It's called a lance.

679
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:10,639
Hello.

680
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:43,866
-I have word.
-What?

681
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:47,035
Adhemar was called back
to the free companies.

682
01:08:47,369 --> 01:08:50,304
Edward commanded it.
He could be gone all season.

683
01:08:51,372 --> 01:08:54,207
First Jocelyn and now Adhemar.

684
01:08:59,879 --> 01:09:01,213
Well done.

685
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:03,715
Yeah, well done.

686
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:16,725
The tournament results, my lord.

687
01:09:29,736 --> 01:09:30,903
Ulrich.

688
01:09:31,737 --> 01:09:33,072
Ulrich.

689
01:09:33,906 --> 01:09:35,073
Ulrich.

690
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:55,256
-Geoff.
-William.

691
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:57,758
I need to write a letter.

692
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:01,027
"Dear Jocelyn." No.
"My dearest Jocelyn."

693
01:10:01,294 --> 01:10:02,629
Better.

694
01:10:06,365 --> 01:10:07,533
"I miss you."

695
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,168
Was that wrong?

696
01:10:10,368 --> 01:10:15,039
Well, it's up to you, really.
It's your funeral, I mean, letter.

697
01:10:16,106 --> 01:10:18,942
-Say something about her breasts.
-You miss them.

698
01:10:19,776 --> 01:10:20,777
Her breasts?

699
01:10:22,044 --> 01:10:27,048
Yes, you could, but I would tend
to look above her breasts.

700
01:10:28,449 --> 01:10:30,117
I miss her throat?

701
01:10:30,384 --> 01:10:32,720
Still higher. Towards the heavens.

702
01:10:32,986 --> 01:10:35,789
The moon. Her breasts
weren't that impressive.

703
01:10:36,089 --> 01:10:38,291
The moon? The moon.

704
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,461
"It is strange to think...

705
01:10:45,163 --> 01:10:47,298
...I have not seen you in a month.

706
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,336
I have seen the new moon, but not you.

707
01:10:55,504 --> 01:11:00,141
I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but
nothing of your beautiful face."

708
01:11:04,512 --> 01:11:06,480
That's very good.

709
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:09,816
I knew this girl once who....

710
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:13,519
She broke my heart.
I said the pieces--

711
01:11:13,786 --> 01:11:18,456
"The pieces of my broken heart can
pass through the eye of a needle."

712
01:11:21,525 --> 01:11:23,627
He writes as though I had died.

713
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,829
Yes, madame. He dies as well.

714
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:31,200
She used to cook for the Duke of York.

715
01:11:34,202 --> 01:11:37,538
I miss her like the sun
misses the flower.

716
01:11:38,038 --> 01:11:41,041
"I miss you like the sun
misses the flower.

717
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:45,378
Like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter.

718
01:11:47,046 --> 01:11:50,215
Instead of beauty to direct
its light to...

719
01:11:50,882 --> 01:11:55,386
...the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has sent me to."

720
01:11:55,719 --> 01:11:57,721
"I next compete in Paris.

721
01:11:58,722 --> 01:12:01,891
I'll find it empty and cold
if you're not there."

722
01:12:03,058 --> 01:12:04,560
I like it.

723
01:12:05,394 --> 01:12:07,562
And now, to finish it.

724
01:12:08,896 --> 01:12:10,564
With "hope."

725
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:13,567
Love should end with hope.

726
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:17,737
My husband, God rest him...

727
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:20,406
...said something I'll never forget.

728
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,742
"Hope guides me. It--"

729
01:12:24,009 --> 01:12:27,511
"It gets me through the day and
especially the night.

730
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:31,081
The hope that after you
leave my sight...

731
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,083
...it will not be the last time
I look upon you."

732
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,588
Finish it with:

733
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:44,525
"With all the love
that I possess...William."

734
01:12:45,959 --> 01:12:47,060
You mean "Ulrich."

735
01:12:49,462 --> 01:12:51,797
"With all the love I possess...

736
01:12:53,465 --> 01:12:55,300
...I remain yours...

737
01:12:56,134 --> 01:12:58,136
...the knight of your heart."

738
01:13:07,143 --> 01:13:11,313
My master hoped you might have
something to send him in return.

739
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:30,929
Cock-a-doodle once! I shall not deny
him. Twice! I shall not. Thrice!

740
01:13:31,696 --> 01:13:33,264
I deny him.

741
01:13:33,698 --> 01:13:35,132
Thrice he denied him!

742
01:13:41,204 --> 01:13:42,671
No Adhemar.

743
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,607
No Adhemar.

744
01:13:51,312 --> 01:13:52,446
Wat.

745
01:13:55,548 --> 01:13:58,618
Tell me, did you see her?
Did she read the letter?

746
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:01,019
Yes, and yes.

747
01:14:01,987 --> 01:14:02,888
And?

748
01:14:08,993 --> 01:14:10,460
She's coming to Paris!

749
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:18,734
Did she give you anything for me in
return? A letter? A token?

750
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:21,569
Did she give me a token? She did.

751
01:14:24,005 --> 01:14:25,339
Uh, I mean, um....

752
01:14:25,906 --> 01:14:28,575
Well, what is it? Give it to me.

753
01:14:37,415 --> 01:14:38,750
Yes!

754
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:42,753
Hell, yes!

755
01:14:44,087 --> 01:14:47,924
She-- Because she's--
That means she-- Yeah!

756
01:14:51,727 --> 01:14:53,094
Cinquante.

757
01:14:54,295 --> 01:14:55,897
That's a nice round number.

758
01:14:56,664 --> 01:14:57,865
Excuse-moi.

759
01:15:01,568 --> 01:15:05,838
They wager that a Frenchman, not
Sir Ulrich, will win the tournament.

760
01:15:07,573 --> 01:15:09,241
But the amount is 50 florins.

761
01:15:09,508 --> 01:15:12,410
-That's all we got.
-lf we had 60, it would be that.

762
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:15,179
Ulrich against every Frenchman here?

763
01:15:15,412 --> 01:15:19,082
He's won four tournaments in a row.
And Adhemar isn't here.

764
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:22,351
I check shields too.
John Beaumont's here.

765
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:26,188
Count Theobald, Philip of Burgundy--
all French champions.

766
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:27,956
Englishmen will not win...

767
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,991
...this French tournament.

768
01:15:30,324 --> 01:15:33,994
English legs are unsteady
on French soil.

769
01:15:36,429 --> 01:15:38,664
Shut your mouth, all right?!

770
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:44,669
Come on, Roland. It's a good bet.
Win and I can buy my own tavern.

771
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:47,838
-I could write full-time.
-A forge for me.

772
01:15:48,172 --> 01:15:52,675
And because French wine
is too much for English bellies.

773
01:15:53,009 --> 01:15:57,946
Listen, I'm about this fonging close,
mate. I swear to God, Quasimodo!

774
01:15:58,513 --> 01:16:02,850
All I want is to go home, and I've
enough for that trip a hundred times.

775
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:07,687
And most importantly, because
the pope himself is French!

776
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:13,626
The pope may be French,
but Jesus is English. You're on.

777
01:16:14,726 --> 01:16:17,195
He won't lose with the princess
watching him.

778
01:16:17,495 --> 01:16:19,464
He's blond! He's pissed!

779
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:24,367
He'll see you in the lists!
Lichtenstein! Lichtenstein!

780
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:28,204
He's blond! He's tan!
He comes from Gelderland!

781
01:16:28,571 --> 01:16:30,539
He comes from Gelderland!

782
01:16:30,906 --> 01:16:33,742
Gelderland!

783
01:16:49,254 --> 01:16:53,224
-You think he will come?
-As sure as the sun will rise.

784
01:17:18,944 --> 01:17:20,779
You favor cathedrals.

785
01:17:23,448 --> 01:17:25,283
I come for confession.

786
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:30,620
And the glass.

787
01:17:31,454 --> 01:17:34,790
A riot of color in a dreary,
gray world.

788
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,459
Don't you think?

789
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,128
It's beautiful.

790
01:17:44,298 --> 01:17:47,134
I feel the same about
the letter you sent.

791
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:51,637
Speak to me.

792
01:17:52,305 --> 01:17:54,139
Speak those words.

793
01:17:56,308 --> 01:17:58,576
I will win this tournament for you.

794
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:00,411
Excuse me?

795
01:18:00,645 --> 01:18:05,649
I'll win this tournament in your name.
I'll defeat each knight for you.

796
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:10,986
Your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm and my horse's flanks.

797
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,321
Wow.

798
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:15,823
Really?

799
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:18,659
Really? Its flanks?

800
01:18:21,995 --> 01:18:24,497
I wish to hear poetry, Ulrich.

801
01:18:25,998 --> 01:18:28,000
Well, I'm not ready.

802
01:18:29,835 --> 01:18:33,938
I am. Why must everything for
a woman be run on a man's schedule?

803
01:18:34,171 --> 01:18:37,674
Well, a man's day is fuller, and...

804
01:18:38,008 --> 01:18:41,010
...he has more demands on his time.

805
01:18:41,344 --> 01:18:43,345
-ls that so?
-Yes.

806
01:18:44,013 --> 01:18:45,180
Maybe.

807
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:47,682
No?

808
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:50,351
I demand poetry...

809
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:53,854
...and when I want it.
And I want it now.

810
01:18:57,056 --> 01:18:58,524
Your breasts...

811
01:18:59,892 --> 01:19:02,361
...they're below your throat....

812
01:19:03,562 --> 01:19:07,698
Jocelyn, how may I prove
my love to you? How?

813
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:13,703
-Do you ask in earnest?
-Yes.

814
01:19:17,573 --> 01:19:19,908
If you would prove your love...

815
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:23,411
-...do your worst.
-My worst?

816
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:26,413
What do you mean?

817
01:19:26,914 --> 01:19:31,751
Instead of winning to honor me
with your high reputation...

818
01:19:32,084 --> 01:19:34,920
...act against your character
and do badly.

819
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,588
-Do badly?
-Lose.

820
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,823
Losing proves that I'm a loser.

821
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:42,559
Wrong. Losing is a much keener
test of your love.

822
01:19:42,926 --> 01:19:45,395
Losing would contradict
your self-love.

823
01:19:45,762 --> 01:19:49,231
It would show obedience
to your lover and not yourself!

824
01:19:49,532 --> 01:19:51,934
-Really?
-Woman, shh!

825
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:56,771
Do not "shh" me and spare him!
Now be gone! Go!

826
01:19:59,873 --> 01:20:01,208
What is your answer?

827
01:20:04,944 --> 01:20:07,112
I will not lose.

828
01:20:11,883 --> 01:20:13,618
Then you do not love me.

829
01:20:27,295 --> 01:20:29,564
The Protector of Italian Virginity...

830
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:33,467
...the Lance that thrilled France...

831
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,136
...the Harasser of Paraser!

832
01:20:36,469 --> 01:20:39,138
He gave them hell at La Rochelle!

833
01:20:39,805 --> 01:20:42,641
The Enforcer of our Lord God!

834
01:20:43,475 --> 01:20:46,477
The one, the only...

835
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:49,646
...Sir Ulrich...

836
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,482
...von Lichtenstein!

837
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:00,689
God, I'm good!

838
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:08,261
His horse's flanks.

839
01:21:08,862 --> 01:21:11,864
Maybe where he comes from,
it means love.

840
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,875
What are you doing?

841
01:21:25,275 --> 01:21:27,443
-Losing.
-I don't understand.

842
01:21:28,211 --> 01:21:29,278
Neither do I.

843
01:21:49,661 --> 01:21:51,229
He loves me.

844
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:55,566
Are you blind?

845
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,235
-Did you see the flag?
-I saw it, okay?

846
01:22:00,169 --> 01:22:01,804
I know.

847
01:22:02,171 --> 01:22:05,307
You're dropping behind
for a more dramatic victory.

848
01:22:07,675 --> 01:22:10,811
Look, Jocelyn told me to lose
to prove my love.

849
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:16,282
-I'd rather you were blind.
-Don't be foolish, Will.

850
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:20,686
-Each woman wants proof, that's all.
-Proof of what?

851
01:22:21,453 --> 01:22:23,622
Her legs weren't uncrossed
for nothing.

852
01:22:23,855 --> 01:22:28,325
-I haven't uncrossed her legs.
-Then why are we doing this?!

853
01:22:28,692 --> 01:22:29,960
Because!

854
01:22:42,036 --> 01:22:43,471
Because...

855
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:46,373
...I love her.

856
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:32,176
-I'm going to lose everything!
-That's why it's called gambling.

857
01:23:33,411 --> 01:23:35,079
Pain! Here's your pain!

858
01:23:35,412 --> 01:23:37,581
It's very romantic, though.

859
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:40,350
Are you a woman or a blacksmith?

860
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,351
Sometimes I'm both.

861
01:23:42,585 --> 01:23:44,420
Ooh, that chafes!

862
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,088
Put him down.

863
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:52,593
No knight has distanced himself
with victories.

864
01:23:52,926 --> 01:23:57,597
If you win your remaining matches
and your opponents take key losses...

865
01:23:57,864 --> 01:24:00,366
...you could make the semis,
or the finals.

866
01:24:00,599 --> 01:24:04,369
-At least the armor's proven itself.
-And your love?

867
01:24:04,769 --> 01:24:06,270
Have you proven that?

868
01:24:09,773 --> 01:24:14,110
Wat, you remember church as a boy.
The fear, the passion.

869
01:24:15,111 --> 01:24:17,279
That's what she makes me feel.

870
01:24:18,113 --> 01:24:22,450
And for that, I say my rosary
to Jocelyn and no one else.

871
01:24:23,284 --> 01:24:25,786
William, that's blasphemous.

872
01:24:32,325 --> 01:24:34,126
Then may I burn in hell.

873
01:24:34,493 --> 01:24:35,627
Withdraw.

874
01:24:36,094 --> 01:24:38,296
Lose that way.
Take no more punishment.

875
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:40,464
Oh, Roland.

876
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:49,638
My lady sends this message.
If you love her--

877
01:24:50,005 --> 01:24:53,341
I know, I know. I must lose.
Isn't she watching?

878
01:24:53,675 --> 01:24:56,644
She says if you love her,
you won't lose again.

879
01:24:57,178 --> 01:25:00,647
She says if you love her,
you will win this tournament.

880
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:13,658
There she is, the embodiment of love.
Your Venus.

881
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:15,359
And how I hate her.

882
01:25:31,372 --> 01:25:35,975
-I don't understand women.
-Nor do I, but they understand us.

883
01:25:37,543 --> 01:25:39,211
Maybe not you.

884
01:25:51,321 --> 01:25:52,689
Yes!

885
01:25:53,456 --> 01:25:54,891
Women, eh?

886
01:26:18,476 --> 01:26:20,144
Forty-eight...

887
01:26:20,478 --> 01:26:21,812
...forty-nine...

888
01:26:22,146 --> 01:26:23,814
...and fifty.

889
01:26:24,081 --> 01:26:27,650
Thank you, gentlemen.
A pleasure doing business with you.

890
01:26:27,984 --> 01:26:31,753
Look us up if you're in London,
the world championships, maybe.

891
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:36,157
Don't look too sad.
Here, have a drink on me.

892
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:41,428
He's quick, he's funny and
makes lots of money, Lichtenstein!

893
01:26:59,676 --> 01:27:01,844
Guinevere comes to Lancelot.

894
01:27:07,849 --> 01:27:09,851
Bed him well, my lady.

895
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:11,852
Bed him well.

896
01:27:18,724 --> 01:27:20,359
We missed you at banquet.

897
01:27:21,994 --> 01:27:22,861
"We"?

898
01:27:27,565 --> 01:27:28,866
I.

899
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,701
Jocelyn.

900
01:27:32,569 --> 01:27:34,203
Your prize.

901
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:37,806
My prize.

902
01:27:40,075 --> 01:27:41,709
I am not worthy of a prize.

903
01:27:43,744 --> 01:27:45,412
Then who is?

904
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:50,416
My maid tells me that
sometimes your varlets...

905
01:27:51,584 --> 01:27:52,918
...call you William.

906
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:57,989
Is this so, Sir Ulrich?

907
01:28:01,425 --> 01:28:02,593
Yes.

908
01:28:04,428 --> 01:28:05,395
It is so.

909
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,275
Your name makes no matter to me.

910
01:28:24,277 --> 01:28:26,779
Just so I can call you my own.

911
01:28:28,046 --> 01:28:30,715
But Jocelyn, I am your own.

912
01:28:38,121 --> 01:28:39,789
Damn, girl.

913
01:28:40,623 --> 01:28:41,958
You need a surgeon.

914
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:46,394
He's been. He says I will live,
though it doesn't feel that way.

915
01:28:47,962 --> 01:28:50,965
Oh, William. This pain is my doing.

916
01:28:51,298 --> 01:28:52,966
Yes, it is.

917
01:28:56,803 --> 01:28:58,137
Although...

918
01:28:58,971 --> 01:29:00,306
...my father...

919
01:29:02,808 --> 01:29:04,976
...taught me to take the bad...

920
01:29:05,977 --> 01:29:07,478
...with the good.

921
01:29:14,817 --> 01:29:16,819
This good you speak of.

922
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,990
It will be my doing as well.

923
01:29:38,936 --> 01:29:43,340
How long since any of you have been
back? I've only been gone 6 months.

924
01:29:43,674 --> 01:29:45,508
Two years for me.

925
01:29:46,342 --> 01:29:47,677
Three years.

926
01:29:48,778 --> 01:29:52,347
Five. Five long years.

927
01:29:55,016 --> 01:29:56,350
William?

928
01:29:58,352 --> 01:29:59,520
Twelve.

929
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:02,856
Twelve years.

930
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:07,026
He's to be an apprentice?

931
01:30:11,896 --> 01:30:12,964
How long for?

932
01:30:14,565 --> 01:30:15,866
Seven years.

933
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:50,761
Sir Ector?

934
01:30:52,929 --> 01:30:56,398
I'm the thatcher. I spoke to you
outside London Stadium.

935
01:30:56,765 --> 01:30:58,600
Oh, yes. I remember.

936
01:30:59,101 --> 01:31:00,568
Is this the boy?

937
01:31:03,938 --> 01:31:06,440
Step forward, son. Let me look at you.

938
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,942
Careful with that, Roland!

939
01:31:14,446 --> 01:31:16,615
Are you afraid of me, boy?

940
01:31:26,956 --> 01:31:29,225
Have you got most of your teeth?

941
01:31:34,963 --> 01:31:37,131
Show me your arm. Is it strong?

942
01:31:47,306 --> 01:31:50,475
Well, he's a half-starved little
scarecrow.

943
01:31:51,809 --> 01:31:53,644
But he has spirit.

944
01:31:57,481 --> 01:32:01,984
I can show you a great wide world
full of adventure...

945
01:32:02,818 --> 01:32:05,821
...and marvels you
do not yet dream of.

946
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:11,325
Can you pack my horse and lead it?

947
01:32:18,164 --> 01:32:21,333
Well, come on.
Say goodbye to your father.

948
01:32:23,001 --> 01:32:27,505
He's a real knight, William.
Watch and learn all you can.

949
01:32:33,176 --> 01:32:35,511
It's all I can do for you, son.

950
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:40,015
Now go change your stars
and live a better life than I have.

951
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:53,859
Roland, show the boy his duties.

952
01:32:57,562 --> 01:33:01,298
-Father? I'm afraid.
-Of what?

953
01:33:01,665 --> 01:33:03,634
I won't know the way home.

954
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:07,970
Don't be foolish, William.
You just follow your feet.

955
01:33:27,186 --> 01:33:28,320
London.

956
01:34:15,725 --> 01:34:18,060
Give us a shout out, London!

957
01:34:40,077 --> 01:34:43,747
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

958
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:26,214
-Adhemar's here. He's entered.
-Must have grown bored with war.

959
01:35:26,448 --> 01:35:30,451
No, the Black Prince commanded it.
He had to disband his army.

960
01:35:30,718 --> 01:35:33,720
They were reveling,
pillaging town after town.

961
01:35:33,954 --> 01:35:36,789
Robbing, murdering,
ransacking churches.

962
01:35:37,123 --> 01:35:41,293
Committing the oldest sins
in the newest ways.

963
01:35:43,328 --> 01:35:46,297
At last we will face each other again,
Sir Ulrich.

964
01:35:46,664 --> 01:35:48,399
And at the World Championship.

965
01:35:48,666 --> 01:35:50,634
And as I promised you before...

966
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:53,636
...you will look up at me
from the flat of your back.

967
01:35:59,508 --> 01:36:01,142
Let the past die.

968
01:36:02,176 --> 01:36:05,946
You've done well in my absence,
on the field and off, I'm told.

969
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:10,149
Winning trophies, horses, women.

970
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:13,118
You put them in that order?

971
01:36:13,852 --> 01:36:16,588
Generally, with a few exceptions.

972
01:36:23,527 --> 01:36:25,195
Beautiful, isn't she?

973
01:36:25,862 --> 01:36:29,031
A real thoroughbred trophy,
don't you think?

974
01:36:30,199 --> 01:36:34,102
-You speak of her like a target.
-lsn't she?

975
01:36:34,869 --> 01:36:36,037
No.

976
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,641
She is the arrow.

977
01:36:45,711 --> 01:36:48,547
I've begun negotiations
with her father.

978
01:36:52,216 --> 01:36:54,051
I'm to make her my bride.

979
01:36:55,219 --> 01:36:57,721
She'll be saddled...

980
01:36:58,321 --> 01:37:00,556
...and placed on my mantle.

981
01:37:01,557 --> 01:37:03,659
Target or arrow, it doesn't matter.

982
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,228
I will have her.

983
01:37:11,665 --> 01:37:14,001
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

984
01:37:51,097 --> 01:37:55,033
-How would you beat him?
-With a stick, while he slept.

985
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,269
But on a horse? With a lance?

986
01:37:59,103 --> 01:38:01,438
That man is unbeatable.

987
01:38:29,828 --> 01:38:30,962
Hello there.

988
01:38:34,165 --> 01:38:38,435
-You're Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.
-Yes.

989
01:38:38,935 --> 01:38:43,239
You're my favorite knight.
When we joust, I always say I'm you.

990
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:48,076
What are you doing in Cheapside?
There's no parade today.

991
01:38:52,679 --> 01:38:54,281
Can you keep a secret?

992
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:14,030
I was born in Cheapside,
just around the corner there.

993
01:39:14,363 --> 01:39:17,299
-Truly, Sir Ulrich?
-Truly.

994
01:39:17,533 --> 01:39:19,868
I only live just there.

995
01:39:21,636 --> 01:39:22,970
How old are you?

996
01:39:23,204 --> 01:39:26,440
-Nine and one half.
-Nine and one half.

997
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:31,144
I wonder if you remember a man,
though he may have died long ago.

998
01:39:31,377 --> 01:39:35,047
He was as tall as a knight.
His name was John Thatcher.

999
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:38,016
-Of course I remember him.
-You do?

1000
01:39:38,216 --> 01:39:40,384
Yes. He lives there still.

1001
01:39:45,055 --> 01:39:49,058
Sometimes we see him sitting
at the window, but no one knows why.

1002
01:39:52,894 --> 01:39:53,995
What do you mean?

1003
01:39:54,562 --> 01:39:55,997
He's blind, sir.

1004
01:40:42,267 --> 01:40:43,868
Is someone there?

1005
01:40:48,606 --> 01:40:52,976
If you're here for the net,
I'm not done yet. Come tomorrow.

1006
01:40:57,279 --> 01:40:58,280
Who are you?

1007
01:41:01,282 --> 01:41:02,450
A knight.

1008
01:41:05,386 --> 01:41:08,555
My name...is Ulrich.

1009
01:41:09,789 --> 01:41:13,959
Ulrich? I hear that name
being chanted from the stadium.

1010
01:41:14,393 --> 01:41:16,294
What business have you here?

1011
01:41:16,828 --> 01:41:19,464
I have word, Master Thatcher.

1012
01:41:21,999 --> 01:41:23,066
Word of your son.

1013
01:41:24,334 --> 01:41:27,303
Of my William? Well, come in, sir.

1014
01:41:33,341 --> 01:41:36,677
What word? Does he live?

1015
01:41:39,113 --> 01:41:40,747
Aye. He lives.

1016
01:41:42,849 --> 01:41:44,484
He is very well.

1017
01:41:46,185 --> 01:41:48,020
He wanted you to know...

1018
01:41:49,855 --> 01:41:52,290
...that he changed his stars
after all.

1019
01:42:02,198 --> 01:42:04,533
And has he followed his feet?

1020
01:42:08,203 --> 01:42:10,805
Has he found his way home at last?

1021
01:42:12,306 --> 01:42:13,273
Yes.

1022
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:22,547
Father.

1023
01:42:22,881 --> 01:42:25,717
Oh, William. Oh, my boy.

1024
01:42:36,659 --> 01:42:39,995
I should like to meet this Wat.
And Roland too.

1025
01:42:40,228 --> 01:42:42,230
You will, Father.

1026
01:42:45,232 --> 01:42:49,069
And what of women?
Is there a certain one or many?

1027
01:42:50,903 --> 01:42:52,571
There is a certain one.

1028
01:42:54,406 --> 01:42:56,408
I should like to meet her too.

1029
01:43:02,913 --> 01:43:05,248
This leak won't do, Father.

1030
01:43:05,849 --> 01:43:10,586
-Not in a thatcher's chamber.
-lt's quite fitting for a blind one.

1031
01:43:12,921 --> 01:43:14,756
Well, a thatcher I am.

1032
01:43:16,424 --> 01:43:17,758
I'll fix it.

1033
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:02,260
Alive. I thought he was dead,
which is mad...

1034
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:05,296
Alive. I thought he was dead,
which is mad...

1035
01:44:05,596 --> 01:44:08,799
...because he was also so strong.
Very strong.

1036
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,468
-Geoff.
-Jocelyn.

1037
01:44:11,835 --> 01:44:14,270
This day just gets better and better.

1038
01:44:17,272 --> 01:44:18,407
Somebody die?

1039
01:44:21,676 --> 01:44:23,644
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

1040
01:44:27,347 --> 01:44:28,682
Adhemar...

1041
01:44:29,682 --> 01:44:33,152
...followed you last night.
To Cheapside.

1042
01:44:33,952 --> 01:44:35,287
He saw your father.

1043
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:39,290
Will, they asked me for your patents.

1044
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:47,130
They're waiting for you
in the lists to arrest you.

1045
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:49,698
A dozen royal guards.

1046
01:44:50,866 --> 01:44:55,837
-They'll put you in the stocks.
-But I face Adhemar in five minutes.

1047
01:44:57,371 --> 01:45:01,208
No, you forfeit.
They've already marked it down.

1048
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:05,711
Saddle the horses.
They can arrest your baggage, not you.

1049
01:45:11,883 --> 01:45:13,384
Halt.

1050
01:45:18,722 --> 01:45:20,390
So, what do you think...

1051
01:45:22,892 --> 01:45:24,827
...now that you know what I am?

1052
01:45:26,228 --> 01:45:30,398
To know what you are, William,
would take a lifetime.

1053
01:45:31,065 --> 01:45:33,900
One I am willing to give.
But now you must run.

1054
01:45:35,735 --> 01:45:38,070
Run, and I will run with you.

1055
01:45:38,404 --> 01:45:40,406
Jocelyn, I cannot run.

1056
01:45:40,739 --> 01:45:44,242
I am a knight, and I will
put myself to the hazard!

1057
01:45:44,576 --> 01:45:48,412
In your heart, not on paper.
And paper's what matters to them!

1058
01:45:51,581 --> 01:45:53,716
William, I love you.

1059
01:45:55,751 --> 01:45:58,086
I love you. You.

1060
01:46:00,588 --> 01:46:05,192
-I won't see you led to the stocks.
-But you'll see me run? No!

1061
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:08,428
Damn your pride, William.

1062
01:46:08,928 --> 01:46:11,764
It is only you that
will not see you run.

1063
01:46:12,031 --> 01:46:14,266
Pride's the one thing they can't take!

1064
01:46:14,533 --> 01:46:18,036
But they can take it from you.
They can and they will.

1065
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:20,271
Oh, they will.

1066
01:46:21,105 --> 01:46:23,440
But love they cannot take.

1067
01:46:28,778 --> 01:46:31,113
And where will we live?

1068
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:33,782
In my hovel?

1069
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:40,787
-With the pigs inside in winter?
-Yes, William, with the pigs.

1070
01:46:41,021 --> 01:46:42,389
With the pigs.

1071
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:47,126
The poor can marry for love.

1072
01:46:48,961 --> 01:46:51,796
Jocelyn, you speak of what
you do not know!

1073
01:46:55,666 --> 01:46:57,634
William, I beg you.

1074
01:46:58,501 --> 01:46:59,803
Please.

1075
01:47:02,338 --> 01:47:04,073
Run. Do it for love.

1076
01:47:12,112 --> 01:47:13,814
Roland, you would see me run?

1077
01:47:20,853 --> 01:47:21,987
And you, Geoff?

1078
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:25,690
I wish it too, with all
the pieces of my heart.

1079
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:35,197
Wat? You and I? We aren't runners.

1080
01:47:39,868 --> 01:47:41,035
Yes.

1081
01:47:43,037 --> 01:47:44,805
William, today we are.

1082
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:49,542
Run, William.

1083
01:47:56,381 --> 01:47:58,383
I will not run!

1084
01:48:05,722 --> 01:48:07,223
I am a knight.

1085
01:48:20,234 --> 01:48:21,568
Well, boys...

1086
01:48:22,168 --> 01:48:24,570
...all good things must come to an end.

1087
01:48:25,504 --> 01:48:27,406
Let's end them together.

1088
01:49:04,602 --> 01:49:08,272
You will remove yourself
from this position of honor.

1089
01:49:10,374 --> 01:49:11,708
I am here to compete.

1090
01:49:12,108 --> 01:49:14,444
You are here to be arrested.

1091
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:23,284
All right!

1092
01:49:51,673 --> 01:49:54,309
He that strives to touch a star...

1093
01:49:55,176 --> 01:49:56,811
...oft stumbles...

1094
01:49:57,178 --> 01:49:58,812
...at a simple straw.

1095
01:50:09,855 --> 01:50:11,489
You have been weighed.

1096
01:50:19,195 --> 01:50:20,863
You have been measured.

1097
01:50:23,866 --> 01:50:25,634
And you have been found wanting.

1098
01:50:31,205 --> 01:50:34,207
It's one loss or another...William.

1099
01:50:40,312 --> 01:50:44,049
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1100
01:51:22,313 --> 01:51:23,814
Leave, Roland.

1101
01:51:24,881 --> 01:51:26,216
Let them have me.

1102
01:51:27,216 --> 01:51:29,051
God love you, William.

1103
01:51:29,385 --> 01:51:30,819
So do I.

1104
01:51:31,386 --> 01:51:33,555
Go! Disperse!

1105
01:51:35,823 --> 01:51:37,491
Or I will fong you!

1106
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:40,994
As Jesus Christ the Nazarene
and his holy mother...

1107
01:51:41,228 --> 01:51:44,831
...the Virgin Mary are my witnesses,
I will fong you!

1108
01:51:45,731 --> 01:51:48,400
I will rip you! Fist! Pain!

1109
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,970
I'll stick my fist and break you!
Pain! Lots of pain!

1110
01:51:59,242 --> 01:52:00,677
We're in trouble.

1111
01:52:04,413 --> 01:52:06,081
Listen to me.

1112
01:52:10,751 --> 01:52:12,753
Listen to me!

1113
01:52:45,479 --> 01:52:47,814
What a pair we make, huh?

1114
01:52:51,317 --> 01:52:53,452
Both trying to hide who we are.

1115
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:56,154
Both unable to do so.

1116
01:53:05,161 --> 01:53:06,996
Your men love you.

1117
01:53:09,165 --> 01:53:12,334
If I knew nothing else about you,
that would be enough.

1118
01:53:13,835 --> 01:53:17,671
But you also tilt
when you should withdraw.

1119
01:53:20,173 --> 01:53:22,108
That is knightly too.

1120
01:53:30,348 --> 01:53:31,516
Release him.

1121
01:53:41,524 --> 01:53:44,526
He may appear to be
of humble origins...

1122
01:53:45,794 --> 01:53:48,863
...but my personal historians
have discovered...

1123
01:53:49,197 --> 01:53:52,800
...that he descends
from an ancient royal line.

1124
01:53:56,202 --> 01:53:57,870
This is my word.

1125
01:53:59,371 --> 01:54:02,874
And as such, is beyond contestation.

1126
01:54:08,212 --> 01:54:09,146
Now...

1127
01:54:10,547 --> 01:54:13,883
...if I may repay the kindness
you once showed me.

1128
01:54:15,218 --> 01:54:16,218
Take a knee.

1129
01:54:33,232 --> 01:54:37,235
By the power vested in me
by my father, King Edward...

1130
01:54:38,403 --> 01:54:40,905
...and by all the witnesses here...

1131
01:54:44,074 --> 01:54:45,408
...I dub thee...

1132
01:54:48,077 --> 01:54:49,412
...Sir William.

1133
01:55:01,688 --> 01:55:04,257
Arise...Sir William.

1134
01:55:11,596 --> 01:55:12,930
Can you joust?

1135
01:55:14,598 --> 01:55:16,600
There's my tournament to finish.

1136
01:55:17,134 --> 01:55:21,604
Now, are you fit to compete,
or shall the forfeit stand?

1137
01:55:22,471 --> 01:55:23,405
I'm fit.

1138
01:55:24,807 --> 01:55:29,744
I shall have your opponent informed.
Look for his shield on the lists.

1139
01:55:30,311 --> 01:55:31,645
At once.

1140
01:55:32,313 --> 01:55:33,747
Thank you, my lord.

1141
01:55:44,155 --> 01:55:46,624
All hail Prince Edward!

1142
01:55:51,661 --> 01:55:53,997
My lords, my ladies...

1143
01:55:54,831 --> 01:55:57,299
...and all you other people.

1144
01:55:58,167 --> 01:56:02,837
I give you the son of Philippe
de Vitry, son of Gilles....

1145
01:56:05,506 --> 01:56:07,507
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1146
01:56:08,175 --> 01:56:11,177
It's nothing but spun sugar
and boot black.

1147
01:56:20,184 --> 01:56:21,785
It's a small target...

1148
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,188
...but aim for his heart.

1149
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,595
--doer of daring deeds...

1150
01:56:34,863 --> 01:56:38,199
...conqueror of countless kingdoms,
Count...

1151
01:56:42,035 --> 01:56:43,703
...Adhemar!

1152
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:30,789
Oh, God. I'll get the surgeon.

1153
01:58:31,156 --> 01:58:32,123
Roland!

1154
01:58:32,757 --> 01:58:33,891
You're the surgeon.

1155
01:58:36,326 --> 01:58:37,461
Come on.

1156
01:58:45,267 --> 01:58:46,301
He tipped it.

1157
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:51,338
Kate, get me back to one.

1158
01:58:51,672 --> 01:58:53,674
Otherwise we forfeit.

1159
01:59:00,846 --> 01:59:03,014
Dirty son of a bitch!

1160
02:00:13,237 --> 02:00:16,573
Kate, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1161
02:00:23,245 --> 02:00:25,414
As I said, thatcher.

1162
02:00:27,582 --> 02:00:30,584
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1163
02:00:31,252 --> 02:00:33,187
Such a place does not exist.

1164
02:00:35,622 --> 02:00:36,523
She's here.

1165
02:00:39,525 --> 02:00:40,592
With your father.

1166
02:00:45,096 --> 02:00:46,697
Change your stars.

1167
02:00:51,735 --> 02:00:53,536
Let's dance, you and I.

1168
02:00:57,306 --> 02:00:58,940
It's two lances to none.

1169
02:00:59,307 --> 02:01:02,944
You must unhorse him or kill him.
It's the only way to win.

1170
02:01:12,985 --> 02:01:15,821
-You need more padding.
-No, leave it off.

1171
02:01:16,488 --> 02:01:18,122
I can't breathe with it on.

1172
02:01:23,827 --> 02:01:24,895
Lance.

1173
02:01:30,332 --> 02:01:31,900
I can barely grip it.

1174
02:01:32,167 --> 02:01:33,501
Damn.

1175
02:01:40,173 --> 02:01:41,508
Lash it to my arm.

1176
02:01:45,678 --> 02:01:46,845
Wat...

1177
02:01:47,613 --> 02:01:49,114
...lash it to me arm.

1178
02:01:52,283 --> 02:01:53,351
Do it.

1179
02:02:11,632 --> 02:02:13,133
Good people!

1180
02:02:14,201 --> 02:02:15,535
I missed my introduction!

1181
02:02:26,711 --> 02:02:28,379
But please...

1182
02:02:28,712 --> 02:02:30,380
...please, I pray you.

1183
02:02:30,881 --> 02:02:32,382
Hear it now.

1184
02:02:33,716 --> 02:02:35,718
For I would lay rest...

1185
02:02:36,052 --> 02:02:38,387
...the grace in my tongue...

1186
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,388
...and speak plain.

1187
02:02:41,556 --> 02:02:43,391
Days like these...

1188
02:02:43,724 --> 02:02:47,394
...are far too rare to cheapen
with heavy-handed words.

1189
02:02:48,728 --> 02:02:52,565
And so, I'm afraid,
without any ado whatsoever--

1190
02:02:53,232 --> 02:02:54,566
Excuse me, my lord.

1191
02:02:55,067 --> 02:02:58,403
Here he is! One of your own!

1192
02:02:59,370 --> 02:03:02,306
Born a stone's throw from
this very stadium...

1193
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:04,474
...and here before you now.

1194
02:03:04,808 --> 02:03:06,809
The son of John Thatcher...

1195
02:03:07,810 --> 02:03:10,813
...Sir William Thatcher!

1196
02:03:21,922 --> 02:03:23,022
That's your name.

1197
02:03:25,925 --> 02:03:27,926
Sir William Thatcher.

1198
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:30,195
Your father heard that.

1199
02:03:48,309 --> 02:03:49,944
Godspeed, William.

1200
02:05:01,935 --> 02:05:04,704
William!

1201
02:05:25,721 --> 02:05:27,722
You have been weighed.

1202
02:05:29,157 --> 02:05:30,391
You've been measured.

1203
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:35,729
And you absolutely...

1204
02:05:36,396 --> 02:05:38,064
...have been found wanting.

1205
02:05:42,234 --> 02:05:44,069
Welcome to the new world.

1206
02:05:44,569 --> 02:05:48,072
God save you, if it is right
that he should do so.

1207
02:05:54,710 --> 02:05:56,845
William!

1208
02:06:10,957 --> 02:06:12,625
Yes!

1209
02:06:14,026 --> 02:06:15,694
He's won! He's won!

1210
02:06:50,755 --> 02:06:52,390
You beat him, Will!

1211
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:58,495
Oh, William.

1212
02:07:19,111 --> 02:07:21,113
I'm going to write this story.

1213
02:07:21,380 --> 02:07:23,381
About the prince and the knights?

1214
02:07:23,615 --> 02:07:28,619
No, all of it. All human activity
lies within the artist's scope.

1215
02:07:31,121 --> 02:07:32,956
Maybe not yours.

1216
02:12:05,841 --> 02:12:06,975
Your round.
