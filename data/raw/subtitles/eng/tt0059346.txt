20
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,378
Fuji, time to contact WSA.

21
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,589
Okay, Glenn.

22
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:19,472
Calling World Space Agency.

23
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:27,271
This is Spaceship P-1 .

24
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,899
World Space Agency here, over.

25
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,985
Our current coordinates:

26
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,613
X: 2, 4...

27
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,824
Y: 3, 3...

28
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,494

29
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,788
Speed:

30
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,124
1 ,000 km/second toward Alpha Scorpii
in the constellation Scorpius.

Spacecraft Event Time:

32
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:55,091
23 hours, 59 minutes,
and 30 seconds.

33
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:00,304
Your speed is off by 0.005 km/second.
Otherwise you're right on time.

34
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,266
Speed corrected by 0.005.

35
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,685
Good.

36
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,853
How are you two holding up?

37
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,523
We're working hard and sleeping well.

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,317
But it'd be nice to walk on solid ground.

39
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,529
You'll walk plenty on Planet X.

40
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,325
- Dr. Sakurai?
- Yes?

41
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,952
ls my sister there?

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,787
Haruno?

43
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,290
Not right now.

44
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,501
Would you give her a message?

45
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:34,213
Tell her not to rush into anything.
- Rush into anything?

46
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,466
l'll set things straight when l get back.

47
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,801
Over.

48
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,139
What's so funny?

49
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,307
Some brother you are!

50
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,685
You wouldn't understand.

51
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,896
Thank you.

52
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,108
ls something bothering Fuji?

53
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,948
My brother's so unreasonable.

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,576
He thinks he can control my social life

55
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,704
like men did in the olden days.

56
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,831
Oh, l'm sorry!

57
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,250
No need to apologize.

58
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:16,005
l take it you've found a boyfriend
and Fuji doesn't approve?

59
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,092
You were supposed
to tell him we were here!

60
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,094
l'm so sorry.

61
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,680
These gentlemen have been waiting.

62
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,266
Let's talk over there.

63
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,985
What does this boyfriend of yours do?

64
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,738
- He's an inventor.
- An inventor?

65
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,622
THE LADYGUARD PORTABLE ALARM

66
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,047
Tetsuo, are you at it again?

67
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,966
That racket keeps the baby awake!
Enough already!

68
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,470
How far away could you hear it?

69
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,097
You can hear it down the street!

70
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,975
l've about had it with you!

71
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,021
The range is improving.

72
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,192
lt's a great invention.
Why doesn't it sell?

73
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,195
Tetsuo!

74
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,239
l didn't make a sound.

75
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,658
- You have a phone call!
- Oh, thanks!

76
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,786
And she thinks my device is loud!

77
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,957
Thanks.

78
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,959
Hello?

79
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,545
Yes, this is Tetsuo Torii.

80
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,258
A contract?

81
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:47,012
Dr. Sakurai, 1 2 moons have already
been discovered orbiting Jupiter,

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,474
so Planet X will be the 1 3th.
- Correct.

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,643
Why wasn't it discovered before?

84
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,770
Planet X is very dark.

85
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,273
We couldn't see it with a telescope.

86
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,943
lt was discovered
when the Central Observatory detected

87
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,863
a distortion in the fifth moon's orbit.

88
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:08,868
But what's really interesting
is the strange radio signal...

89
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,329
that it seems to be emitting.

90
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,374
So there's intelligent life there?

91
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,585
Let's not jump to conclusions.

92
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,671
There are plenty
of natural sources of radio waves.

93
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,174
But we hope to learn the truth
about that and more

94
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,719
when P-1 reaches Planet X.

95
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,328
Tetsuo.

96
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,915
Can you afford a place like this?

97
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,207
Sure.

98
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,337
Don't worry.
l sold the Ladyguard.

99
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,797
Really?

100
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,883
l'm signing the contract here tonight.

101
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,426
Which company?

102
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,261
The World Education Corporation.

103
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,889
They market educational toys internationally.

104
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,600
A toy company?

105
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,602
No, it's not -

106
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,522
Mr. Tetsuo Torii?

107
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,900
That's right.

108
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,154
l am Miss Namikawa
from the World Education Corporation.

109
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,740
As l said on the phone...

110
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,452
we will make payment
once the product comes to market.

111
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,788
Would that be agreeable?

112
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,584
Yes, fine. Right?

113
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,920
Huh? l mean... yes.

114
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,632
- Your wife?
- l hope eventually.

115
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,968
Miss Haruno Fuji.

116
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,804
Nice to meet you.

117
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,807
l believe you work
at the World Space Agency.

118
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,893
Your brother is an astronaut.

119
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,104
Do you know my brother?

120
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,983
No, but we're very interested

121
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,903
in whether the mission
to Planet X will be a success.

122
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,705
Doesn't it seem odd to you?

123
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,456
What do you mean?

124
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,168
Fifty million yen for the Ladyguard?

125
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,462
ls it really worth that much?

126
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,425
Working at the WSA makes you forget
the importance of small inventions.

127
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,635
Science has everyday applications too.

128
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,178
You're awful!

129
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,888
Your brother's the awful one.

130
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,350
He said he'd stand on his head
if anyone bought my invention.

131
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,185
He'd better start practicing!

132
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,856
Glenn, anything seem odd to you?

133
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,899
Odd?

134
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,362
Oops, sorry! l was 1 80° off.

135
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,956
Fuji, it's Jupiter!

136
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,793
Planet X is on the far side.

137
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,055
And there it is.

138
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,728
Calling World Space Agency.

139
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,897
This is Spaceship P-1 .

140
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,566
Space Agency here, over.

141
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,028
P-1 is approaching Planet X.

142
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,989
- Proceed with caution.
- Of course, sir.

143
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,618
But can we take
the leash off once we land?

144
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,080
l can't drag you back now!

145
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,210
You understand? Do you?

146
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:50,089
Roger that. You sound like
my old man chewing me out!!

147
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,802
We've lost contact.

148
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,513
They're now on the far side of Jupiter.

149
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,858
- You see anything?
- Not quite yet...

150
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,452
l see mountains and desert.
The blue area might be water.

151
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,996
Let's prepare to land.

152
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,915
Check your readings.

153
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,793
Ground temperature is 1 5° Celsius.

154
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,461
1 5 degrees?

155
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,048
Not a likely temperature
given the distance from the sun.

156
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,051
The universe is full of mysteries.

157
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,350
Radiation?

158
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,698
None detected.

159
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,580
You okay down there?

160
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,958
Just fine.

161
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,138
Glenn...

162
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,434
l'll go plant the flag on that hill.

163
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,520
Okay. l'll set up the telemeter.

164
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,951
Fuji.

165
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,913
Gravity is a third of Earth's.
Atmospheric pressure is one tenth.

166
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,208
One tenth? That's surprising.

167
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,219
What was that?

168
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,638
Some kind of lightning.

169
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,268
With no clouds? That's strange.

170
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,187
Everything okay there?

171
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,646
Yeah.

172
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,648
All right.

173
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,595
Glenn, keep your eyes open!

174
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,223
l see footprints...

175
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,557
and they look human!

176
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,603
Glenn.

177
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,398
What's going on?

178
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,506
Where are you?

179
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,599
Astronaut Fuji...

180
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,310
step into the cylinder immediately.

181
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,770
Who are you?

182
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,355
You must hurry.

183
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,025
You are in grave danger.

184
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,404
Step into the cylinder now.
- Who are you?

185
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,615
You would call us Xiliens.

186
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,997
Step inside now.

187
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,960
Your crewmate and spaceship
are already under our protection.

188
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,006
All right.

189
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,409
Sir, P-1 was to contact us
20 minutes ago.

190
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,663
- Check the receiver circuit.
- lt's working fine.

191
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,833
Dr. Sakurai?

192
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,668
Don't worry.

193
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,129
l have confidence in those two.

194
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,466
They're our best astronauts.

195
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,178
They'll contact us. You'll see.

196
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,186
Follow the light. lt will guide you.

197
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,958
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

198
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,293
l'm fine.

199
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,628
We welcome you.

200
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:31,526
We extend our warmest of welcomes.

201
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,079
l am the commandant of this planet.

202
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,457
You have nothing to fear.

203
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,294
There is much l would like to discuss.

204
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,046
Discuss?

205
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,173
Like what?

206
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,883
Where is our P-1 ?

207
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,052
You need not worry.

208
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,810
Does that put you at ease?

209
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,192
What's happening?
- lt's Monster Zero!

210
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,069
What?

211
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,321
Monster Zero?

212
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,574
Command all units
to take defensive positions.

213
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Yes, sir.

214
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,327
What is Monster Zero?

215
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,329
A terrible space monster.

216
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:29,167
That foul creature is the reason

217
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,171
we left the surface
to hide underground like this.

218
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,174
Monster Zero is on the attack.

219
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,926
lts location?

220
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,887
Q3-M7.

221
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,430
Very well.

222
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,519
Allow me to show you Monster Zero.

223
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,363
- Glenn, look!
- King Ghidorah?

224
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,073
That's right.

225
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:05,370
You use words to name things,

226
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,541
but we use numbers.

227
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,216
Why don't you fight back?

228
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,386
lf you know how, please teach us.

229
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,558
We have done all we can
to defeat the creature,

230
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,854
but it has all been to no avail.

231
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,900
- So what will you do?
- Wait until it leaves.

232
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,618
Cave-in, Sector 1 5!

233
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,372
Evacuate everyone to Sector 1 6

234
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,708
and seal off Sector 1 5.

235
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,011
Commandant, situation critical!

236
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,389
The hydrogen oxide plant is damaged.

237
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,584
Something serious must have happened.

238
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,046
And they're keeping us
in the dark... literally.

239
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,423
Just like at international conferences.

240
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,802
Hydrogen oxide?

241
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,513
That means water, right?

242
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,639
Right.

243
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,065
Do not fear.

244
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,485
Monster Zero is gone.

245
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,278
Has something happened?

246
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,156
There was a slight miscalculation...

247
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,326
but we are safe once again.

248
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,454
As are you, of course.

249
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,166
What was it you wished to discuss?

250
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,510
Let me be frank.

251
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,805
ln order to defeat King Ghidorah...

252
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:33,560
we wish to borrow Monster Zero One
and Monster Zero Two from you.

253
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,438
You call them Godzilla and Rodan.

254
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,857
Godzilla and Rodan?

255
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,733
Correct.

256
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,946
We are aware that
Godzilla and Rodan joined forces

257
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:49,701
to save the Earth
from King Ghidorah's destruction.

258
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,619
Will you help us?

259
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,083
This is a very unusual request.

260
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,044
We don't know what to say.

261
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,672
We don't even know where they are

262
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,383
or how we'd get them here.

263
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,760
Godzilla is in Lake Myojin...

264
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,139
and Rodan is in Washigasawa.

265
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:14,559
We merely seek your permission

266
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,103
to go and capture them.

267
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,689
Of course...

268
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,442
we have something to offer

269
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,819
in return for your cooperation.

270
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:29,574
Your planet has no cure for cancer.

271
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,537
We are prepared to provide a drug

272
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,414
that cures cancer.

273
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,068
Please explain
our intentions to your people

274
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,779
and help us achieve our objective.

275
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,155
Understood.

276
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,283
We'll do our best to ensure
a favorable response.

277
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,412
You are clear for takeoff.

278
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,919
We wish you a safe journey home.

279
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,923
And we are pleased to have found
good friends in space.

280
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,508
Farewell for now.

281
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,023
SPACESHlP P-1 RETURNS
FROM PLANET X

282
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:36,868
From reports submitted
by astronauts Fuji and Glenn...

283
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,121
we have been astonished to learn

284
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:44,667
that a technologically superior race

285
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,880
inhabits the newly discovered Planet X.

286
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:53,217
Furthermore, these "Xiliens"

287
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,387
have extended their friendship to us.

288
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,390
To reach a decision in this matter,

289
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,519
l'd like to hear a thorough examination
of their proposed conditions.

290
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,772
MEDlCAL DELEGATE

291
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:11,110
l'm extremely interested
in their generous offer

292
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:16,991
to provide us with a cure for cancer.

293
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,453
lf we could also obtain from them

294
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,082
medical knowledge
beyond the cure for cancer,

295
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,251
fatal diseases could become
a thing of the past.

296
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,922
As the housewives' delegate,
l have no objection either.

297
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:35,760
We are impressed with their wish
for peace in the galaxy...

298
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,931
and we are ashamed
of the many conflicts

299
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,600
currently being waged around the globe.

300
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,063
Since all parties are in favor,

301
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:51,943
there appears to be no need
for further discussion.

302
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,613
But are Godzilla and Rodan

303
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,033
where the Xiliens say they are?

304
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,953
We've sent search parties
to both locations.

305
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,969
LAKE MYOJlN

306
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,483
WASHlGASAWA

307
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,782
WORLD EDUCATlON CORP.

308
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,578
Sorry to keep you waiting.

309
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,418
Miss Namikawa is away on business.
May l help you?

310
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,176
Any news on the Ladyguard?
Anything at all?

311
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,761
That's still in the planning stage.

312
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,430
Planning stage?

313
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:06,517
l get the same answer every time!
May l see the president?

314
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,193
- Sir?
- ls he gone?

315
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,613
No. He's asking when
it will be brought to market.

316
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,448
What a pest.

317
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,875
Find a way to get rid of him...

318
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,461
but politely.

319
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,889
l'm sure my brother's annoyed
at being kept waiting.

320
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,058
l don't feel like seeing him today.

321
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,976
Cheer up.

322
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,188
So they gave you the brush-off.
Forget it.

323
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,148
Your little sister's late.

324
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,734
l don't know what to do with her.

325
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,237
You're just scared of losing her.

326
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,239
Two coffees.

327
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,574
Listen, don't let me keep you.

328
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,244
Actually, l'm waiting for someone too.

329
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,498
A Japanese girl?
Not the wrong kind, l hope.

330
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:14,085
You can't always do background checks,
or you'll never fall in love.

331
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,381
But speaking of checking...

332
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,176
l've been thinking
about that incident on Planet X.

333
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,512
Water seemed to play an important role.

334
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,847
That was bugging me too.

335
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,934
And can we trust

336
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,103
their gesture of friendship?

337
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,443
- Have we kept you waiting?
- You're late!

338
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,362
Hello, Mr. Glenn.

339
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,197
Let's sit over here.

340
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,333
Tetsuo...

341
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,420
Haruno tells me
you sold your invention.

342
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,130
That's right.

343
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,758
The Ladyguard.

344
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,305
What kind of company
would buy such a thing?

345
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,932
l haven't received any money yet.

346
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,144
l'm not sure l can count on you

347
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,272
to take care of my dear little sister.

348
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,733
You understand, right?
- Sure.

349
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,277
Don't agree with him!

350
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,781
Mr. Glenn, the most important thing

351
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,159
is mutual trust, right?

352
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,661
Yes, trust is a beautiful thing.

353
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,872
Keep out of this, okay?

354
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,500
- l was just stating a fact.
- Trust won't put food on the table.

355
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,794
But it's a solid foundation.

356
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,589
Enough! You're always
too easy on the ladies.

357
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,843
- lf you'll excuse me -
- You're leaving?

358
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,595
l have a date.

359
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,932
lt's not gonna be easy.
You're up against a formidable foe.

360
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,619
lt's Miss Namikawa!

361
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,790
- Been waiting long?
- No.

362
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,625
Damn it!

363
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,547
Away on business my foot!

364
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:29,762
Unless you give me
some reason to change my mind,

365
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,014
l'm opposed to your marriage.

366
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,435
Kazuo!

367
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,772
What are you going to do?

368
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,733
Well... l'm a man too.

369
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,985
First l'll track down Miss Namikawa.

370
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,744
- lt's getting stronger!
- Captain!

371
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,912
What?

372
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,291
- The radioactivity's getting stronger.
- What?

373
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,304
RADlOACTlVlTY AT LAKE MYOJlN...

374
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,598
PROVES THE XlLlENS CORRECT

375
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,603
- Sir, is Godzilla really there?
- Yes.

376
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,482
The search team says
he could awaken any time.

377
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:27,445
So Rodan is probably
where the Xiliens said too.

378
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,260
What's wrong?

379
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,345
You drive for a while.

380
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,816
What's all this about?
This leads to Lake Myojin, right?

381
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,068
l came this way with my gal.

382
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:11,030
You gonna brag
about your amorous adventures?

383
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,656
Just listen.

384
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,034
l saw the commandant that day.

385
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,161
The commandant? From Planet X?

386
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,413
Yeah.

387
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,624
We stayed at the lodge there,

388
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,335
and l could swear
he came into our room.

389
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,339
You were just dreaming!

390
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,926
l thought so at first,
but that can't explain it.

391
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,678
Did he say anything?

392
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,849
"All preparations are completed.

393
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,185
Forget about minor matters."

394
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,855
What could that mean?
- How should l know?

395
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,650
Did she see him too?

396
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:53,322
No, but she said l moaned all night
like l was having nightmares.

397
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:58,827
You think we've been
too trusting of the Xiliens?

398
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:04,208
They just might have
territorial ambitions here on Earth.

399
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,961
They may need our water.

400
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,047
Planet X isn't an easy place to live.

401
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:14,552
Let's go check out that lodge.
Maybe we'll find something.

402
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,889
Halt!

403
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,312
We're with the Space Agency.

404
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,693
Commander!

405
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,572
- Fuji. We're with the Space Agency.
- Glenn here.

406
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,076
- We'd like to check out the lodge.
- Not a chance! Look over there.

407
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,251
Godzilla?

408
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,013
Prepare to fire!

409
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,598
Forward!

410
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,353
A flying saucer!

411
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,319
They're here, just as l thought.

412
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,528
Damn them!

413
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,621
Should we fire? What do we do?

414
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,123
Should we fire?
- Hold on!

415
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,400
They look human!

416
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,193
lt's the Xiliens!

417
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,698
They're coming this way!

418
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,704
The commandant is in the middle.

419
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:03,554
l would like to express
our sincere appreciation

420
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,808
for the kindness
you earthlings have shown to us...

421
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,562
the people of Planet X.

422
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:16,358
l would like to designate this day
as Friendship Day

423
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,902
in honor of our two planets...

424
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,574
joining together for peace
in our solar system.

425
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,744
His words set my teeth on edge.

426
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,913
Peace is well and good...

427
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,750
but it requires trust and understanding.

428
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:37,838
You came and hid beneath the lake
before even receiving our answer.

429
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,591
l apologize for that.

430
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:45,763
But if we had delayed our arrival...

431
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:51,685
what damage might Godzilla
and Rodan have caused by then?

432
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,938
How would you transport
those two to your planet?

433
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,942
We have advanced technology

434
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,278
unimaginable on Earth.

435
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,823
We can easily transport
any cargo into space,

436
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,117
no matter its mass.

437
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,581
You seem skeptical...

438
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,210
but those flying saucers
are cargo ships.

439
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,469
They're headed for Washigasawa!

440
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,805
Search Team Two,
flying saucer headed your way!

441
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,139
Fall back immediately!

442
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:38,023
Fall back!

443
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,492
There it is!

444
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,337
lt's Godzilla!

445
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,347
- What are those beams?
- Electromagnetic waves!

446
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,245
Glenn, let's get ready.

447
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,247
Excuse us.

448
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,065
lt's Rodan!

449
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,385
Kazuo, are you sure you'll be safe?

450
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,055
Of course.

451
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,515
We're invited as state guests.

452
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:44,232
And we have to get
that data on the cancer cure.

453
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,944
- ls Mr. Glenn going too?
- Yes, and Dr. Sakurai.

454
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,363
Tell me...

455
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:53,075
is Mr. Glenn's girlfriend a good person?

456
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,785
Ask Glenn!

457
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,958
Don't go.
We have to get married right away!

458
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,126
l'll be back soon.

459
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,963
But you don't understand.

460
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,133
No, you don't understand.

461
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,927
What's going on?

462
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,305
l've gotta go.

463
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,145
We'll get married as soon as l get back.

464
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,993
Follow that car!

465
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,500
We'll be taking off soon.
Please board.

466
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,937
Please have a seat.

467
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,070
l have a favor to ask.

468
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,488
Go ahead.

469
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,699
May l see the control room?

470
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,035
This is the control room.

471
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,536
This?

472
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,999
All navigational decisions
are communicated

473
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,336
to the computer room via brainwaves.

474
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:35,886
Meaning you control the ship
with your thoughts?

475
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,554
Precisely.

476
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,223
Can you do that
with living creatures as well?

477
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,059
We can.

478
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,562
You have a very inquisitive mind.

479
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,648
l will feed that fact into the computer.

480
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,904
Are all calculations correct?

481
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,405
Yes, sir.

482
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,908
All is according to plan.

483
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:52,295
A much smoother ride
than on your spaceship, is it not?

484
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:56,967
But did Godzilla and Rodan manage
to escape Earth's gravity?

485
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:01,054
Do not worry.
They are right behind our ship.

486
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:12,149
450 million kilometers,
precisely as computed.

487
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,192
450 million kilometers?

488
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,318
That is correct.

489
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,658
We just left Earth 4 1/2 hours ago!

490
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:25,245
We are now traveling
at approximately 1/1 0 the speed of light.

491
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,454
The speed of light?

492
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:30,834
Our goal is to approach the speed of light.

493
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,780
You wished to see me?

494
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,825
You've become quite involved
with the earthling,

495
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,119
far more than necessary.

496
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,370
That's not true.

497
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,207
Just carry out your orders!

498
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,043
This isn't personal advice.

499
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,420
lt's an order from the commandant!

500
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,714
l understand.

501
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,984
That inventor is here.

502
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,527
What?

503
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,657
You failed with that one too?

504
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,515
We will be landing shortly.

505
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,600
Glenn, be on your guard.

506
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,021
Gotcha.

507
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,998
Work crew, you are to deploy

508
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,543
as soon as Monster Zero One
and Zero Two touch down.

509
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,170
Roger that.

510
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,719
What's that pipe for?

511
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,764
lt is for absorbing hydrogen oxide.

512
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,226
Water is more precious here than gold.

513
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,358
Work crew, hurry!

514
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,068
Monster Zero is approaching!

515
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,940
Dr. Sakurai, please observe.

516
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:50,528
Monster Zero shall not have
such an easy time of it now.

517
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,909
Of course, this plan
could not have succeeded

518
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,161
without your help.

519
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,663
We are most grateful.

520
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,130
Observe.

521
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,591
For the first time...

522
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:58,012
we have been able to repel
Monster Zero's attack.

523
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:07,522
Where did Mr. Fuji and Mr. Glenn go?

524
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,649
They were just here.

525
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,782
This is leading nowhere.

526
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,995
lt might lead to a clue
as to the commandant's true intentions.

527
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:25,123
They'll get suspicious
if we're not back soon.

528
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,001
Too late. Here they come.

529
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:48,938
lt's open!

530
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,111
No response.
Alert the commandant!

531
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,449
Where's the switch?

532
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,409
l don't see one.

533
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,954
We'll just have to wait till it stops.

534
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:27,310
Look at all this gold!

535
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,730
He said water
was more precious here than gold.

536
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,940
Now l see why.

537
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,817
Someone's coming.

538
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,282
Namikawa!

539
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,416
What's going on?

540
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:57,173
Have you forgotten me?
What are you doing here?

541
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,981
Let's get out of here!

542
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,713
You can put your hands down now.

543
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:43,886
Why were you sneaking around
without permission?

544
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:48,725
Permission?
You mean like a couple of tourists?

545
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:52,729
Besides, we wanted
a little glimpse behind the scenes.

546
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,565
And what did you discover?

547
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,192
That water is
more precious here than gold.

548
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,530
That doesn't mean we lack for water.

549
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,699
We can readily obtain it.

550
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,743
Really? Where?

551
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,412
Perhaps you should discover that too.

552
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,540
Why do all the women look the same?

553
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,752
Do you not admire a beautiful face?

554
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:20,590
Not when they're all the same.
lt's the unique beauty of each -

555
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,675
Let us not argue.

556
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,763
Our law states...

557
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,600
that you should be punished.

558
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,438
But you were invited as state guests.

559
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,691
We shall overlook it this time.
- Thank you.

560
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,588
And this is the tape...

561
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:06,719
containing the data
on the cure for cancer.

562
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,388
We offer it now.

563
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,015
Thank you very much.

564
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:17,104
A spaceship is now ready
to take you home.

565
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:26,739
lt's P-1 !

566
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,075
lt is not Spaceship P-1 .

567
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:33,162
When you first arrived,

568
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:37,041
we analyzed your ship in detail.

569
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:40,336
This was built using that data.

570
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:59,856
- lt's Godzilla!
- And Rodan too.

571
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,821
Dr. Sakurai, l wonder
if we made the right choice.

572
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,532
Why do you say that?

573
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,993
Look at Godzilla and Rodan.

574
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,454
They don't seem too happy
being left behind.

575
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,999
Yeah, they can be a pain sometimes,

576
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,084
but l feel sorry for them.

577
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,880
Gentlemen, are your
instrument checks complete?

578
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:31,387
l can't believe
you built an exact replica.

579
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,764
lt is no mere replica.

580
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,726
You will find it superior to the original.

581
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:43,357
Gentlemen, l wish you a safe journey.

582
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,942
Oh, it's you!

583
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,652
Please.

584
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,948
l've come to ask about Tetsuo.

585
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,449
Tetsuo?

586
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,661
Oh, him.

587
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,958
He was quite a bother for a while,
but l haven't seen him lately.

588
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,292
Are you sure?

589
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,796
Yes. ls anything wrong?

590
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:49,966
The day my brother
and Mr. Glenn left for Planet X,

591
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,886
Tetsuo set out looking for you,
and he hasn't been home since.

592
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,681
No!

593
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,934
How long are you going
to keep me locked up?

594
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,979
We can't let you go now.
You'll soon see why.

595
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,313
What do you mean?

596
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,565
We're changing the course of history.

597
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,150
The course of history?

598
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:13,322
Orders are coming in
from the commandant.

599
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,324
Wait!

600
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,661
Who's this commandant?

601
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,665
This is Earth Base.

602
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,376
- This is the commandant.
- l read you loud and clear.

603
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,004
Our plan is to be executed

604
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,423
per ltem 4 of Scenario 5.

605
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:33,884
ltem 4 of Scenario 5.
Understood.

606
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,803
Excellent.

607
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,193
The delegation has returned.

608
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,030
Turn on the TV.

609
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,295
They've arrived!

610
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:15,801
Welcome back. Great work.

611
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,562
This is the cancer cure data
we received from Planet X.

612
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,086
- ls the deck in working order?
- Yes, sir.

613
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:53,047
Did they use
a different recording format?

614
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:56,383
The case indicates
it's the same format as ours.

615
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,683
This is the commandant of Planet X.

616
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,855
My orders to the people of Earth
are as follows.

617
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,899
Orders?

618
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:17,613
Earth is henceforth
a colony under our control.

619
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,202
lf you do not obey,

620
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:27,665
we will exterminate
every last human on your planet.

621
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,293
- l was afraid of this!
- That was his plan all along!

622
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:40,511
l repeat: Earth shall continue
to exist only as our colony.

623
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:47,226
PUBLlC ORDER COLLAPSES
AROUND THE GLOBE

624
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:51,021
When the news came out,
chaos broke out worldwide.

625
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:55,359
Some are calling for resistance,
some for peace.
STOCK MARKET PLUNGES!

626
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,237
The two sides have clashed,
resulting in riots.

627
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,575
MASS PANlC lN MANY AREAS

628
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,852
Glenn.

629
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,024
Just as l thought.

630
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,443
l'm from Planet X.

631
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,280
You must have seen women
identical to me there.

632
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,865
l did.

633
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,118
Glenn, l was just following orders

634
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,287
from the commandant's computer.

635
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,706
Were you ordered to marry me?

636
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,499
No!

637
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:56,337
You were once my surveillance target,

638
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,881
but now you're much more.

639
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,176
Then take off that uniform
and let's get out of here.

640
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:06,138
No, you're to become
a citizen of Planet X and marry me.

641
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,391
So says the computer.
lt's the only way to save you.

642
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,647
Namikawa, we're not robots.

643
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:17,900
How could we be happy
while controlled by a machine?

644
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:23,572
The people of earth will fight
to the death for freedom.

645
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,034
Has the computer stripped you
of your conscience?

646
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:31,121
Think hard!
ls there any way to stop this war?

647
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,915
lf you know, tell me!

648
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:36,961
That's the way to ensure peace
and our own happiness!

649
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,504
Glenn...

650
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,465
l can't live as an earthling.

651
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,884
lt's too late.

652
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,511
No, it isn't!

653
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,099
Mr. Glenn!

654
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,271
lt is too late.

655
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,939
Oh yeah?

656
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,695
As commander of this colony,
l'm taking you to our base.

657
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,709
Don't go!
You'll be a human guinea pig!

658
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:44,570
What did she do?
Why did you have to kill her?

659
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,573
The computer controls our actions.

660
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,700
We cannot love or marry
unless ordered.

661
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,869
Violators must be eliminated.

662
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:54,330
That is the law on Planet X.

663
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,089
Fuji.

664
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:07,217
So King Ghidorah
has appeared in the U.S.?

665
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,179
More bad news.
- lntelligence reports are coming in.

666
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:13,807
What about the Defense Council?
- No decision yet.

667
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,852
The Defense Force believes
we're compelled to use

668
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,146
our hydrogen bombs.

669
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,024
Could we survive
such massive radiation?

670
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,402
Seems we're between
a rock and a hard place.

671
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,738
- Kazuo.
- Have you seen Glenn?

672
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,616
No, he hasn't been back
to his lodgings.

673
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:33,869
Where has he run off to
at a time like this?

674
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,997
A flying saucer!

675
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,699
We are sorry to see

676
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,120
there has been no reply to our orders.

677
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,373
We therefore consider you
noncompliant.

678
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,251
l will now explain
how we shall conquer Earth.

679
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:27,256
We have stationed King Ghidorah
in your western hemisphere.

680
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,258
So he was theirs all along!

681
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:35,013
King Ghidorah is controlled
by our electromagnetic waves.

682
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,768
We can control
Godzilla and Rodan the same way.

683
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,103
Damn them!

684
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:48,986
We shall conquer the Earth
with these three monsters.

685
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,907
But we will delay our orders to them

686
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,368
for 24 hours.

687
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,620
This is your last chance.

688
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,379
So they're controlling them
via electromagnetic waves?

689
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,089
Yes. Why?

690
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,383
You have to get right on this.

691
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:26,148
"The Effect of A-Cycle
on Electromagnetic Waves."

692
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,823
Hey, aren't you...?

693
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,492
Ah, it's you.

694
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,994
Funny meeting you here.

695
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,996
You can say that again.

696
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,501
lt's no use.
l've checked every square inch.

697
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,086
There's no way out.

698
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:56,470
- Completely soundproof?
- And not just the walls.

699
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:59,848
The bars aren't even metal.
They don't make a sound.

700
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,195
New orders from the commandant.

701
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:17,866
We are now a mop-up force.

702
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,953
We are to eliminate
all earthlings who resist.

703
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,163
Our operation begins in 20 hours.

704
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,547
Fifteen hours left.

705
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:35,175
We have no choice
but to deploy all our missiles.

706
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:39,137
First let us pray.

707
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:40,806
l don't think praying will help.

708
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:43,559
At least we'll save our souls.

709
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:47,813
Attack or surrender - we must decide.

710
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:49,398
Just a moment.

711
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:53,235
l'm working on a plan
to take back Godzilla and Rodan.

712
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,319
How?

713
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,240
The Xiliens are controlling them

714
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,742
via electromagnetic waves.

715
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,247
lf we can interrupt those waves,
we might save Earth.

716
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,416
Can you do it in short order?

717
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,376
Chances are 50-50.

718
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,670
We're running final tests now.

719
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,798
Let's try it again.

720
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,139
The problem is the A-Cycle range...

721
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,975
Fuji.

722
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,645
Any progress?

723
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,064
l think l've got the general idea.

724
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:34,067
The general idea?
We don't have time!

725
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,862
How are results so far?

726
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,949
This tape is powered
by electromagnetic waves

727
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,535
transmitted from over there.

728
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,287
Haruno, switch it off.

729
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,124
And back on.

730
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,964
lf we interrupt
the electromagnetic waves,

731
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,966
the tape stops.

732
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,595
As you can see...

733
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:05,515
even synthetic metals fail
to stop the waves.

734
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:10,646
So we'll use
this A-Cycle light beam to interrupt

735
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,314
the electromagnetic energy.

736
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:16,568
l'll use a visible spectrum,
so you can see it work.

737
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:37,172
You have it working perfectly!

738
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,175
The problem is...

739
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,845
we don't know the intensity
of the electromagnetic waves

740
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,181
controlling Godzilla and Rodan.

741
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,642
We're running out of time.

742
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,687
We'll make the A-Cycle adjustable.

743
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,525
What if their waves
are outside the range we set?

744
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,821
Then we can only pray.

745
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,865
They won't wait
while we fix the problem.

746
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,084
- Ten hours and counting.
- Excellent.

747
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,837
Earth Base is ready!

748
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,380
Very well.

749
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,716
ls everything per our calculations?

750
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,468
Yes, sir.

751
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,013
lt sure is quiet.

752
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,729
Don't waste your time.
l tried everything!

753
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:37,232
We can't give up.
We have to keep trying.

754
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,744
Mr. Glenn!

755
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,412
What's this?

756
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,372
A note from Namikawa!

757
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,541
That lying witch!

758
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,960
What's it say?

759
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,088
Glenn, by the time you read this...

760
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:04,926
l'll have been eliminated
for disobeying our computer.

761
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,554
But l have no regrets.

762
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,391
With you l found a love
beyond all computer calculations.

763
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:15,187
One more thing our calculations
failed to account for:

764
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,898
The people of Planet X are defenseless

765
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,525
against a certain audio frequency.

766
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,444
Farewell, Glenn.

767
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,113
l see now!

768
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,783
That's why this room is soundproof!

769
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,495
And that's why
they bought my invention!

770
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,216
Does this emit a sound?

771
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:46,468
A really irritating one!

772
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:47,969
lf l push this...

773
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:54,518
Stop! Stop it!

774
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,645
lt's working!

775
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,819
Grab the key!

776
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,194
That way!

777
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,454
Sir, the earthlings escaped!

778
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,206
What?

779
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:06,339
Commandant!

780
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:09,217
Two test subjects escaped!
Requesting assistance!

781
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:44,753
That's that. Return to your posts!

782
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,428
That was close!

783
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,473
l wasn't sure it would work.

784
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,433
What do we do now?

785
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,811
They're not gonna ferry us across.

786
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:03,521
Start swimming.

787
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,744
Five hours and counting.

788
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,248
Situation normal.
Proceeding as calculated.

789
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:23,375
Excellent.

790
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,711
Kazuo?

791
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,630
l'm back.

792
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,757
Where were you?

793
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:32,550
Look at this.

794
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:36,471
With these metal particles
and an A-Cycle beam,

795
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,808
we can completely interrupt
their electromagnetic waves.

796
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,810
What are you doing here?

797
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,812
Don't be mean.

798
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,273
She's right. He has a great idea
for defeating Planet X.

799
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,862
The alarm he invented
incapacitates the Xiliens.

800
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:53,822
Really?

801
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,324
lt saved our lives.

802
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:59,369
lf we amplify the sound
and broadcast it,

803
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,788
it'll hurt 'em good!

804
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:05,166
Good! Get started on it.
We only have three hours.

805
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:14,175
Commandant, there's an anomaly
in our calculations.

806
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,388
Computer Five, status report.

807
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:19,681
The cause is unknown.

808
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:24,519
Very well. Let us change the plan.

809
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,522
We attack Earth at once.

810
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,275
Status update.

811
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:33,445
Errors gradually decreasing.

812
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,363
Very well.

813
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,867
Monster Zero One
and Zero Two, attack!

814
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,021
Godzilla's coming!

815
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:39,052
Sir, they launched an early attack!

816
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,472
Did they figure out our plans?

817
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,433
We have to hurry. Let Glenn know.

818
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:22,011
Calculations returning
to normal values.

819
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,139
Very well.

820
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:27,725
Continue the attack.
We shall deploy as well.

821
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,864
Get back!

822
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,143
The attack is a success.

823
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:56,731
Eliminate all approaching vehicles.

824
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,574
Kazuo!

825
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,534
How's it coming?

826
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:12,914
Flying saucers are picking off
the first truck squad like sitting ducks.

827
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,084
A mobile unit is almost ready.

828
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:20,088
Great! l'm heading out
to the frontline with Dr. Sakurai.

829
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,259
Let's hurry.

830
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,103
Are the calculations correct?

831
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,938
Yes, sir.

832
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,027
Deploy Monster Zero
for a mass assault.

833
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,446
Hurry!

834
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:51,744
Please keep the second squad
in the tunnel until ordered.

835
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,247
Second squad, stay in the tunnel.

836
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,958
Don't let them see you.
- Roger.

837
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,471
This way.

838
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:40,056
Sorry it took so long.

839
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,933
Use this deck.

840
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,447
This is an emergency broadcast.

841
01:23:56,657 --> 01:24:01,327
The shrill noise you're about to hear
is not a malfunction.

842
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:04,747
Please do not turn off your radios.

843
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:08,042
Keep them on at maximum volume.

844
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,795
l repeat: Keep your radios on.

845
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,432
Sir, Glenn has begun broadcasting!

846
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,726
Be ready to attack.

847
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,815
That's it.
Let's get to Mekura lsland.

848
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:37,154
That shrill sound is not a malfunction.

849
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:41,075
Please do not turn off your radios.

850
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:44,620
Please keep the volume at maximum.

851
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:47,832
l repeat: Keep your radios on.

852
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,590
- Commandant!
- What is it?

853
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,781
- Let's go.
- Move out!

854
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,322
How is it going?

855
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,324
Hard to say.

856
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,326
All's quiet so far.

857
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,500
A flying saucer!

858
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:22,009
Start transmitting.
- All right.

859
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,011
Commence transmission!

860
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:48,285
Earth Base, what's the status
on the calculation corrections?

861
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,454
We can't take any more!

862
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,456
That sound is killing us!

863
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:55,876
Make it stop!

864
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,754
- Send in the second squad.
- Launch the attack.

865
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:42,339
Second squad, commence attack.

866
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:32,473
Sir, it's working!

867
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:50,074
- Commandant!
- What?

868
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,201
We've lost control of the monsters.

869
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,744
What?

870
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,227
Earth Base, what's the status
on the calculation corrections?

871
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,020
Earth Base!

872
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:22,189
Commandant!

873
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,694
Earth Base is done for!

874
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,529
Commandant!

875
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,700
You fool! We are invincible!

876
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:34,952
Earth cannot defeat us!

877
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:37,371
Please save us!

878
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:40,207
No! We proceed as calculated.

879
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:02,897
lt's in trouble!

880
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:18,871
Earth Base, we shall escape!

881
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,791
We shall escape to the future...

882
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:27,171
to a future unknown.

883
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,680
We did it!

884
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:35,841
Sir, let's fall back.

885
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:37,217
Good idea.

886
01:32:37,343 --> 01:32:38,844
Move out!

887
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,931
- What's going on?
- Look.

888
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,501
Are Godzilla and Rodan dead?

889
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,837
No, l doubt it.

890
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:58,549
Fuji, what do you think?

891
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,718
What can l say?

892
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:04,179
Can you rest easy now?

893
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:05,472
Not so fast.

894
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,891
You're heading back to Planet X.

895
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:09,893
What?

896
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:11,895
To make a thorough survey.

897
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:14,982
You gotta be kidding!

898
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:17,359
You just can't win.

899
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:35,961
THE END
