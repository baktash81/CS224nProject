1
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,967
Peter.

2
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,563
Your momma wants to speak with you.

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,806
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

4
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,883
Why have you been fighting
with the other boys again, baby?

5
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,686
Peter?

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,369
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,526
Smushed it with a stick.

8
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,201
You're so like your daddy.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,843
You even look like him.

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,202
And he was an angel.

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,331
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

12
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,403
You got a present there for Peter,
don't you?

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,924
Of course.

14
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,201
There.

15
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,723
I've got you covered, Pete.

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,969
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,044
Your grandpa...

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,611
...is gonna take such good care of you.

19
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,560
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,401
Take my hand.

21
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,646
Peter.

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,320
Pete, come on.

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,364
Take my hand.

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,447
Mom?

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,810
No! No! No! No!

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,246
Mom! No!

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,925
- Come with me.
- No!

28
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,804
No!

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,731
You've got to stay here. Please.

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,241
No...

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,090
Okay?

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,680
No.

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,964
Mom!

34
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,520
Drop it!

35
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,080
Hey.

36
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,895
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

37
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,922
No problem at all.

38
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,335
How do you know about this?

39
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,930
I don't even know what that is.

40
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,521
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

41
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,121
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

42
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,575
This is just an outfit, man.

43
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,045
Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.

44
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,255
What is your name?

45
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,282
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

46
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,051
- Move!
- Why?

47
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,083
Ronan may have questions for you.

48
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,641
Hey, you know what?

49
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,888
There's another name
you might know me by.

50
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,528
Star-Lord.

51
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,841
Who?

52
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,201
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

53
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,722
- Guys?
- Move!

54
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,802
Forget this.

55
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,130
Peter?

56
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,081
What happened?

57
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,575
Hey...

58
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,682
I...

59
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,443
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

60
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,160
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

61
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,600
<i>Scattered riots broke out</i>

62
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,215
<i>across the Kree Empire today</i>

63
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,815
<i>protesting the recent peace treaty
signed by the Kree Emperor</i>

64
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,286
<i>and Xandar's Nova Prime.</i>

65
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,205
Peter, you have call.

66
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,724
- No, wait, don't!
<i>- Quill?</i>

67
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,486
Hey, Yondu.

68
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,642
<i>I'm here on Morag.</i>

69
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,006
<i>Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.</i>

70
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,248
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

71
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,695
<i>Well, where are you at now, boy?</i>

72
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,291
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

73
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,880
<i>- I slaved putting this deal together.</i>
- Slaved?

74
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,135
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

75
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,161
<i>And now you're gonna rip me off!</i>

76
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,762
<i>We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.</i>

77
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,611
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

78
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,051
<i>When I picked you up on Terra..</i>

79
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,161
"Picked me up."

80
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,295
<i>...these boys of mine
wanted to eat you.</i>

81
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,375
Yeah?

82
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,731
<i>They ain't never tasted
any Terran before.</i>

83
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,135
<i>I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!</i>

84
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,446
<i>I Will find you, I Will...</i>

85
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,764
Put a bounty on him!

86
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,615
Forty K.

87
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,335
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

88
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,855
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

89
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,375
I told you when you picked that kid up,

90
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,368
you should have delivered him
like we was hired to do!

91
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,005
He was cargo!

92
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,815
You have always been soft on him.

93
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,411
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

94
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,366
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

95
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,802
As soon as we get him back here,

96
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,767
I'm gonna kill him myself.

97
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,531
What we do need to worry about,

98
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,366
is who else out there wants that Orb!

99
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,007
<i>They call me "terrorist, "</i>

100
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,291
<i>"radical, " "zealot, "</i>

101
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,283
<i>because I obey the ancient laws
of my people, the Kree,</i>

102
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,522
<i>and punish those who do not.</i>

103
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,809
<i>Because I do not forgive your people</i>

104
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,446
<i>for taking the life of my father,</i>

105
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,487
<i>and his father,
and his father before him.</i>

106
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,328
<i>A thousand years of war between us
will not be forgotten!</i>

107
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,644
You can't do this!
Our government signed a peace treaty.

108
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,087
My government knows no shame.

109
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,004
You Xandarians and your culture
are a disease.

110
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,441
You

111
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,895
will never rule Xandar.

112
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,967
No.

113
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,047
I will cure it!

114
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,281
Ronan,

115
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,283
Korath has returned.

116
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,244
Master, he is a thief,

117
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,768
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

118
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

119
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,285
to retrieve the Orb
for an intermediary known

120
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,930
as The Broker.

121
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,575
I promised Thanos
I would retrieve the Orb for him.

122
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,206
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

123
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,482
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

124
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,406
It will be my honor.

125
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,567
It will be your doom.

126
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,326
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

127
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,255
without his prize.

128
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,770
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

129
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,446
Just like you.

130
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,891
But I know Xandar.

131
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,650
Ronan has already decreed that I...

132
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,801
Do not speak for me.

133
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,282
You will not fail.

134
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,650
Have I ever?

135
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,531
Xandarians.

136
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,895
What a bunch of losers.

137
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,369
All of them in a big hurry
to get from something stupid,

138
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,523
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

139
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,015
Look at this guy!

140
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,655
Can you believe they call us criminals,

141
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,603
when he's assaulting us
with that haircut?

142
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,975
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

143
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,561
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

144
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,643
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

145
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,001
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

146
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,209
Right, Groot?

147
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,855
Groot?

148
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,723
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

149
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,087
That's disgusting!

150
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,535
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

151
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,686
Why are you lying?

152
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,131
Whoop.

153
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,242
Looks like we got one.

154
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,405
Okay, humie, how bad
does someone wanna find you?

155
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,095
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

156
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,371
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

157
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,721
The Orb.

158
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,762
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

159
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,609
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

160
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,721
And told me to tell you,

161
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,135
that you got the best eyebrows
in the business.

162
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,327
What is it?

163
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,495
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

164
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,522
Yeah, well, I almost died
getting it for you.

165
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,610
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

166
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,561
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

167
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,883
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

168
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,095
I truly am.

169
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,855
But I want no part of this transaction

170
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,803
if Ronan is involved.

171
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,961
Who's Ronan?

172
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,455
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

173
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,769
who will not rest
until Xandarian culture, my culture,

174
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,095
is wiped from existence!

175
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,531
- Come on.
- He's someone

176
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,120
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

177
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,810
What? What about my bad side?

178
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,251
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

179
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,925
Hey, we had a deal, Bro!

180
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,081
What happened?

181
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,244
This guy just backed out of a deal
on me.

182
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,482
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a man without integrity.

183
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,330
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

184
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,081
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

185
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,328
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

186
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,050
People say it about me, all the time,

187
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,240
but it's not something
I would ever say about myself.

188
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,601
This wasn't the plan.

189
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,322
Put him in the bag.
Put him in the bag!

190
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,727
No! Not her, him!

191
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,291
Learn genders, man.

192
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,849
Biting? That's not fair!

193
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,969
Take it easy!

194
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,364
Fool. You should have learned.

195
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,289
I don't learn. One of my issues.

196
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,650
What the...

197
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,055
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

198
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,855
You gotta be kidding me.

199
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,609
Hey!

200
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,726
I live for the simple things.

201
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,087
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

202
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,055
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

203
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,605
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

204
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,210
Quit whining.

205
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,809
<i>Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.</i>

206
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,005
Aw, crap.

207
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,615
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

208
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,495
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

209
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,775
<i>...for endangerment to life
and the destruction of property.</i>

210
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,929
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

211
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,289
- Star-Lord.
- Sorry. "Lord."

212
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,522
I picked this guy up a while back
for petty theft.

213
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,135
He's got a code name.

214
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,255
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

215
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,215
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

216
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,015
Just relax, pal.

217
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,247
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

218
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,245
Fascists.

219
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,895
<i>Ronan is destroying</i>

220
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,127
<i>Xandarian outposts
throughout the galaxy.</i>

221
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,205
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

222
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,055
<i>We signed your peace treaty,
Nova Prime.</i>

223
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,286
<i>What more do you want?</i>

224
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,215
At least a statement
from the Kree Empire

225
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,481
saying that they condemn his actions.

226
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,081
He is slaughtering children.

227
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,607
Families.

228
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,095
<i>That is your business.</i>

229
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,168
<i>Now, I have other matters to attend to.</i>

230
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,601
Prick.

231
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,210
Well, some good news.

232
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,449
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

233
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,081
Gamora.

234
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,166
Surgically modified
and trained as a living weapon.

235
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,800
The adopted daughter
of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

236
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,369
Recently, Thanos lent her
and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

237
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,729
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

238
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,084
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

239
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,725
The result of illegal genetic

240
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,375
and cybernetic experiments

241
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,680
on a lower life form.

242
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,804
What the hell?

243
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,725
They call it "Groot."

244
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,375
A humanoid plant
that's been travelling recently

245
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,655
as 89P13's
personal houseplant/muscle.

246
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,765
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

247
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,004
Raised from youth by a band
of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

248
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,924
led by Yondu Udonta.

249
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,570
I'm sorry.

250
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,610
I didn't know how this machine worked.

251
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,842
What a bunch of a-holes.

252
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,846
Transport all four to the Kyln.

253
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,088
I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

254
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,608
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

255
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,002
But, hey, that's not my problem.

256
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,730
I ain't gonna be here long.

257
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,282
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

258
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,815
You're lucky the broad showed up,

259
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,095
because otherwise, me and Groot

260
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,015
would be collecting that bounty
right now,

261
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,963
and you'd be getting
drawn and quartered

262
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,135
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

263
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,415
I've had a lot of folks
try to kill me over the years.

264
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,205
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

265
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,321
Hold.

266
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,400
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

267
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
It's what you are, stupid.

268
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,645
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

269
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,655
So, this Orb has
a real shiny blue suitcase,

270
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,729
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

271
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,651
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

272
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,450
So what? What's the Orb?

273
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,728
I have no words for an honorless thief.

274
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,127
Pretty high and mighty
coming from the lackey

275
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,455
of a genocidal maniac.

276
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,455
Yeah, I know who you are.

277
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,482
Anyone who's anyone
knows who you are.

278
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,215
Yeah, we know who you are.

279
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,815
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

280
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,808
Yeah, you said that.

281
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,000
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

282
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,810
I was betraying him.

283
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,962
I had an agreement
to sell it to a third party.

284
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,291
I am Groot.

285
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,735
Well, that's just as fascinating
as the first 89 times you told me that.

286
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,842
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

287
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,335
Well, he don't know
talking good like me and you.

288
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,495
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

289
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,170
Exclusively in that order.

290
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,575
I tell you what,
that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

291
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,126
Hey.

292
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,361
Put that away.

293
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,855
Hey!

294
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,121
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

295
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,930
That's mine. Those belong to impound.

296
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,975
That tape and that player is mine!

297
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,535
<i>Hooked on a Feeling,</i>
Blue Swede, 1973.

298
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,095
That song belongs to me!

299
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,724
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

300
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,775
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

301
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,044
You're scum! You're scum!

302
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,161
It's like I said,

303
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,255
she's got a rep.

304
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,169
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

305
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,455
to Ronan and his goons.

306
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,686
She'll last a day, tops.

307
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,086
Murderer!

308
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,920
The guards will protect her, right?

309
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,367
They're here to stop us from getting out.

310
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,443
They don't care
what we do to each other inside.

311
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,082
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

312
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,881
are dreams
compared to what's behind me.

313
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,770
Check out the new meat.

314
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,606
I'm gonna slather you up
in Gunavian jelly,

315
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,046
and go to town...

316
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,489
Let's make something clear.

317
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,689
This one here is our booty!

318
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,203
You wanna get to him,

319
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,529
you go through us!

320
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,681
Or, more accurately,

321
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,561
we go through you.

322
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,364
I'm with them.

323
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,610
I hate you.

324
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,975
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

325
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,691
You're dead!

326
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,241
Dead!

327
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,960
Take her down to the showers.

328
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,320
It'll be easier to clean up
the blood down there.

329
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,206
Quill, where you going?

330
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,567
Quill.

331
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,415
Quill!

332
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,922
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

333
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,255
for your crimes against the galaxy.

334
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,486
You dare?

335
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,569
You know who I am, yes?

336
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,566
You're Drax.

337
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,802
The Destroyer.

338
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,015
Quill!

339
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,963
And you know
why they call me this.

340
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,691
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

341
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,250
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

342
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,688
and my daughter, Camaria.

343
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,289
He slaughtered them where they stood.

344
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,009
And he laughed!

345
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,135
Quill?

346
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,286
Her life

347
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,048
is not yours to take.

348
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,051
He killed my family.

349
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,120
I shall kill one of his in return.

350
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,367
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

351
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,760
Quill! What are you doing?

352
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,448
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

353
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,724
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

354
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,371
Woman, your words
mean nothing to me!

355
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,046
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Crap.

356
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,415
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

357
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,400
I don't think this is
the best way to go about it.

358
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,523
Are you not the man
this wench attempted to kill?

359
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,926
Well, I mean,
she's hardly the first woman

360
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,041
to try and do that to me.

361
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,369
Look, this is from
a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

362
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,015
Stabbed me with a fork.

363
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,135
Didn't like me skipping out on her
at sunrise.

364
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,686
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

365
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,935
She caught me with
this skinny little A'askavariian

366
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,055
who worked in Nova Records.

367
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,775
I was trying to get information.

368
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,575
You ever see an A'askavariian?

369
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,409
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

370
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,801
If you think I'm seriously interested
in that, then...

371
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,366
You don't care. But here's the point.

372
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,924
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

373
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,686
And when he does,

374
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,123
that's when you...

375
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,771
Why would I put
my finger on his throat?

376
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,247
What?

377
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,521
No, it's a symbol.

378
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,884
This is a symbol
for you slicing his throat.

379
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,368
I would not slice his throat.

380
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,165
I would cut his head clean off.

381
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,408
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

382
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,135
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

383
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,640
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

384
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,404
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

385
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,484
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

386
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,567
Don't do his work for him.

387
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,962
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

388
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,162
- That was my favorite knife.
<i>- Listen!</i>

389
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,403
I could care less
whether you live or whether you die.

390
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,285
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

391
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,080
You know where to sell my Orb.

392
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,481
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

393
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,801
My friend Rocket, here,

394
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,646
has escaped 22 prisons.

395
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,535
We're getting out.

396
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,484
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

397
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,281
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

398
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,801
Four billion units.

399
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,525
- What?
- Holy shit.

400
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,487
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

401
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,441
If you free us,

402
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,895
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

403
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,649
and I'll split the profit
between the three of us.

404
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,484
I am Groot.

405
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,961
Four of us.

406
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,175
Asleep for the danger,
awake for the money,

407
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,201
as per frickin' usual.

408
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,646
<i>You have been betrayed, Ronan.</i>

409
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,844
We know only that
she has been captured.

410
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,975
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

411
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,369
<i>No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.</i>

412
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,091
<i>Look, your partnership with Thanos</i>

413
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,004
<i>is at risk.</i>

414
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,487
<i>Thanos requires your presence. Now!</i>

415
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,175
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

416
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,775
and yet you summon me.

417
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,775
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

418
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,935
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

419
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,769
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

420
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,651
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

421
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,695
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

422
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,855
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

423
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,166
Lower your tone!

424
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,361
I may be your...

425
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,451
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

426
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,281
The only matter
I do not take seriously, boy,

427
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,966
is you.

428
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,206
Your politics bore me.

429
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,495
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

430
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,242
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

431
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,855
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

432
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,689
if you bring me the Orb.

433
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
But return to me again empty-handed,

434
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,604
and I will bathe the starways
in your blood.

435
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,809
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

436
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,851
This is one fight you won't win.

437
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,764
Let's head to the Kyln.

438
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,520
If we're gonna get out of here,

439
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,360
we're gonna need to
get into that watchtower.

440
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,200
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

441
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,804
The guards wear security bands

442
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,327
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

443
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,165
Leave it to me.

444
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,170
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

445
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,930
- His leg?
- Yeah.

446
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,162
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

447
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,641
All right.

448
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,044
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

449
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,255
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

450
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,455
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

451
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,695
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

452
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,215
How are we supposed to do that?

453
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,575
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

454
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,295
So, maybe you can work out
some sort of trade.

455
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,535
You must be joking.

456
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,415
No, I really heard
they find you attractive.

457
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,135
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

458
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,655
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

459
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,495
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

460
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,615
I got one plan,

461
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,815
and that plan requires
a frickin' quarnyx battery,

462
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,975
so figure it out!

463
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,335
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

464
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,335
Now, this is important.

465
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,975
Once the battery is removed,

466
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,495
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

467
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,295
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

468
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,210
so you definitely need to get that last.

469
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,095
Or we could just get it first
and improvise.

470
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,202
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

471
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,281
<i>Prisoner,</i>

472
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,245
drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

473
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,375
or we will open fire.

474
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,408
I am

475
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,291
Groot!

476
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,805
Fire!

477
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,815
All prisoners return
to your sleeping areas.

478
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,815
You idiot!

479
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,605
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

480
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,325
The animal is in control.

481
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,528
Fire on my command!

482
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,325
Creepy little beast!

483
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,963
Yeah.

484
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,729
You need my what?

485
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,405
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

486
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,971
It's internally wired.

487
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,815
I'll figure something out.

488
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,935
Drop the leg!

489
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,566
Drop the leg
and move back to your cell!

490
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,811
Rocket!

491
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,001
Move to the watchtower!

492
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,007
You!

493
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,604
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

494
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,122
It was one time, man.

495
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,495
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

496
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,330
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

497
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,487
Why is this one here?

498
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,520
We promised him he could stay
by your side until he kills your boss.

499
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,975
I always keep my promises,

500
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,695
when they're
to muscle-bound whack-jobs

501
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,360
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

502
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,455
I was just kidding about the leg.

503
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,655
I just need these two things.

504
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,455
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

505
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,561
Was it funny?

506
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,455
Wait, what did he look like
hopping around?

507
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,495
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

508
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,600
How are we going to leave?

509
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,045
Well, he's got a plan.

510
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,935
Right? Or is that
another thing you made up?

511
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,485
I have a plan! I have a plan!

512
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,250
Cease your yammering

513
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,970
and relieve us
from this irksome confinement.

514
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,485
Yeah, I'll have to agree
with the walking thesaurus

515
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,455
on that one.

516
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

517
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,840
It's just a metaphor, dude.

518
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,895
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

519
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,570
Nothing goes over my head.

520
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,803
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

521
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,326
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

522
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,851
Those are some big guns.

523
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,321
On my command!

524
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,241
Number one!

525
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,201
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

526
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,124
Hold on!

527
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,969
Number two!

528
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,695
I recognize this animal.

529
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,015
We'd roast them over a flame pit
as children.

530
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,320
Their flesh was quite delicious.

531
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,601
Not helping!

532
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,761
Number three!

533
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,651
All fire on my command!

534
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,161
Three!

535
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,846
Two!

536
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,441
One!

537
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,609
He turned off the artificial gravity,

538
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,728
everywhere but in here.

539
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,323
I told you I had a plan.

540
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,280
That was a pretty good plan.

541
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,886
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

542
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,975
It's the <i>Milano,</i> the orange and blue one
over in the corner.

543
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,764
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

544
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,922
That's rude! They folded yours.

545
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,123
The Orb's there. Let's go.

546
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,935
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

547
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,689
That bastard didn't put it back.

548
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,686
- Put what back?
- Here.

549
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,615
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

550
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,295
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the <i>Milano</i> close by.

551
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,606
Go.

552
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,046
Go!

553
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,169
My neck!

554
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,360
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

555
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,615
He declined to share
that information with me.

556
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,641
Well, screw this, then!

557
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,615
I ain't waiting around
for some humie with a death wish.

558
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,926
You got the Orb, right?

559
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,690
Yes.

560
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,095
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

561
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,175
No!

562
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,202
We're not leaving without the Orb.

563
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,171
Behold.

564
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,768
This one shows spirit.

565
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,724
He shall make a keen ally
in the battle against Ronan.

566
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,375
Companion, what were you retrieving?

567
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,124
You're an imbecile.

568
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,160
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

569
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,846
You can't take apart my ship
without asking me!

570
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,895
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

571
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,975
It's a bomb.

572
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,001
- A bomb?
- Yup.

573
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,804
And you leave it lying around?

574
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,530
I was gonna put it in a box.

575
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,727
What's a box gonna do?

576
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,042
- How about this one?
- No! Hey!

577
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,255
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

578
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,770
- Shut up.
- Hey!

579
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,127
What is that?

580
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,011
That's for if things get really hardcore.

581
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,775
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

582
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,290
No one's blowing up moons.

583
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,522
You just wanna suck the joy
out of everything.

584
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,802
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

585
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,175
We're heading in the right direction.
For now.

586
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,680
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

587
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,285
And how much do you trust me?

588
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,450
I'd trust you a lot more
if you told me what this was.

589
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,284
Because I'm guessing
it's some kind of weapon.

590
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,775
I don't know what it is.

591
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,121
If it's a weapon,
we should use it against Ronan.

592
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,203
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

593
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,321
Or just you, murderess!

594
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,084
I let you live once, princess!

595
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,288
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

596
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,001
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

597
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,247
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

598
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,528
I have no interest in money.

599
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,960
Great.

600
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,375
That means more money
for the three of us.

601
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,729
For the four of us.

602
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,255
Partners.

603
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,935
We have an agreement,

604
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,000
but I would never be partners
with the likes of you.

605
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,084
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

606
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,448
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

607
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,605
She has no idea.

608
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,255
If I had a black light,

609
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,760
the place would look like
a Jackson Pollock painting.

610
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,129
You got issues, Quill.

611
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,441
I swear.
I don't know where they went! I swear.

612
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,735
If he knew
where they were headed,

613
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,975
he would have already told us.

614
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,001
Yeah.

615
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,561
Ronan,

616
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,855
the Nova Corps sent a fleet
to defend the prison.

617
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,881
Well, then,

618
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,249
send Necrocraft
to every corner of the quadrant.

619
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,802
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

620
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,371
And this place?

621
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,000
The Nova can't know what we're after.

622
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,409
Cleanse it!

623
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,440
Do you got any other
cute little buggers like this one?

624
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,441
I like to stick 'em all in a row
on my control console.

625
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,922
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

626
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,202
He's being fully serious.

627
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,601
In that case, I can show you...

628
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,615
But first, you gonna tell me
what this Orb is,

629
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,847
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

630
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,164
And then you gonna tell me,

631
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,448
who out there might wanna buy it.

632
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,251
Sir, the high-end community is a...

633
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,335
The high-end community is a...

634
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,771
It's a tight-knit...

635
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,126
Tight-knit...

636
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,080
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

637
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,645
I cannot possibly betray

638
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,884
the confidentiality of my buyers!

639
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,447
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

640
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,575
Carina.

641
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,775
Yes, Master.

642
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,804
Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

643
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,731
We do, Master.

644
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,850
Then use them.

645
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,615
I don't have to remind you

646
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,689
what happened to the last attendant
who disappointed me.

647
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,651
Do I?

648
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,484
Chop, chop.
Our guests will be here soon.

649
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,886
Heads up! We're inbound.

650
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,321
What is it?

651
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,375
<i>It's called Knowhere.</i>

652
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,370
<i>The severed head
of an ancient celestial being.</i>

653
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,569
Be wary headed in, rodent.

654
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,883
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

655
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,175
Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

656
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,855
to mine the organic matter
within the skull.

657
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,087
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

658
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,127
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

659
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,087
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

660
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,969
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

661
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,681
Billy the Kid,

662
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,808
Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

663
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,535
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

664
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,607
Yeah, you should.

665
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,175
Excuse me.

666
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,567
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

667
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,650
Get out of here.

668
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,848
Your buyer's in there?

669
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,129
We are to wait here
for his representative.

670
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,800
Get out of here!

671
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,127
This is no respectable establishment.

672
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,328
What do you expect us to do
while we wait?

673
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,246
Yes! Yes!

674
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,651
Yahoo!

675
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,404
My Orloni has won,

676
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,364
as I won at all things!

677
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,725
Now, let's put more of this liquid
into our bodies.

678
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,851
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

679
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,335
Man, you wouldn't believe
what they charge for fuel out here.

680
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,601
I might actually lose money on this job.

681
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,410
My connection is making us wait.

682
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,851
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

683
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,883
Where yours is more,

684
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,925
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

685
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,605
My father didn't stress diplomacy.

686
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,841
Thanos?

687
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,965
He's not my father.

688
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,571
When Thanos took my home world,

689
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,001
he killed my parents in front of me.

690
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,411
He tortured me,

691
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,001
turned me into a weapon.

692
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,525
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

693
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,648
I couldn't stand by and...

694
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,522
Why would you risk your life for this?

695
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,204
My mother gave it to me.

696
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,931
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

697
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,160
I happened to have it on me,

698
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,363
when I was...

699
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,963
The day that she...

700
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,124
You know, when I left Earth.

701
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,280
What do you do with it?

702
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,086
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

703
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,882
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

704
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,201
Really?

705
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,570
On my planet,
there's a legend about people like you.

706
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,006
It's called

707
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,566
<i>Footloose.</i>

708
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,725
And in it, a great hero

709
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,211
named Kevin Bacon,

710
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,762
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

711
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,923
It's the greatest thing there is.

712
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,324
Who put the sticks up their butts?

713
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,925
What? No, that's just a...

714
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,889
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

715
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,247
people use.

716
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,922
The melody is pleasant!

717
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,202
- No!
- What the hell?

718
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,725
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

719
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,089
And I am not some starry-eyed waif
here to succumb to your...

720
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,408
Your pelvic sorcery!

721
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,000
That is not what is happening here.

722
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,929
No.

723
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,491
Stop it!

724
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,120
What are you doing?

725
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,403
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

726
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,483
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

727
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,007
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

728
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,162
Keep calling me
vermin, tough guy!

729
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,402
You just wanna laugh at me
like everyone else!

730
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,131
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

731
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,011
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
He does!

732
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,162
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

733
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,682
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

734
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,763
and put back together, over and over

735
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,002
and turned into some...

736
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,281
Some little monster!

737
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,369
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

738
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,648
He called me "vermin"!

739
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,406
She called me "rodent"!

740
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,975
Let's see if you can laugh

741
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,049
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

742
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,651
No, no, no, no!

743
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,962
Four billion units! Rocket!

744
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,175
Come on, man. Hey!

745
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,201
Suck it up for one more lousy night

746
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,010
and you're rich.

747
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,886
Fine.

748
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,805
But I can't promise, when all this is over

749
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,530
I'm not gonna kill
every last one of you jerks.

750
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,202
See? That's exactly why
none of you have any friends!

751
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,535
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

752
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,531
We have travelled,
halfway across the quadrant.

753
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,682
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

754
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,088
- Drax!
- Let him go.

755
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,486
We don't need him.

756
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,883
Milady Gamora.

757
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,889
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

758
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,123
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

759
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,404
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

760
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,566
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

761
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,401
I present to you,

762
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,606
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

763
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,528
My dear Gamora.

764
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,721
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

765
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,440
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

766
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,406
We have what we discussed.

767
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,922
What is that thing there?

768
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,809
I am Groot.

769
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,530
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

770
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,125
Sir...

771
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,083
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

772
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,130
At the moment of your death, of course.

773
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,526
I am Groot.

774
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,445
Why, so he could turn you
into a frickin' chair?

775
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,561
That's your pet?

776
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,530
- His what?
- Tivan.

777
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,881
We have been halfway
around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

778
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,128
Very well, then.

779
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,760
Let us see what you brought.

780
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,171
Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

781
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,735
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

782
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,244
You shall send a message for me.

783
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,085
My new friends.

784
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,569
Before creation itself,

785
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,449
there were six singularities.

786
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,401
Then the universe exploded
into existence,

787
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,608
and the remnants of these systems

788
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,207
were forged into concentrated ingots.

789
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,247
Infinity Stones.

790
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,890
These stones, it seems,

791
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,883
can only be brandished

792
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,522
by beings of extraordinary strength.

793
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,727
Observe.

794
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:52,815
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

795
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,367
like wheat in a field.

796
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,127
There's a little pee
coming out of me right now.

797
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,166
Once, for a moment,

798
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,370
a group was able to share
the energy amongst themselves,

799
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,490
but even they
were quickly destroyed by it.

800
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,369
Beautiful.

801
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,695
Beyond compare.

802
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,775
Blah, blah, blah.

803
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,486
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

804
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,765
How would you like to get paid?

805
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,968
What do you think,
fancy man? Units!

806
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,521
Very well, then.

807
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,485
Carina.

808
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,801
Stand back.

809
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,125
I will no longer be your slave!

810
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,725
No!

811
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,121
What the...

812
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,361
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

813
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,615
What do you still have it for?

814
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,015
What are we gonna do,
leave it in there?

815
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,963
I can't believe you had that
in your purse!

816
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,841
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

817
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,729
We have to bring this
to the Nova Corps.

818
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,775
There's a chance they can contain it.

819
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,880
Are you kidding me?

820
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,804
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

821
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,200
So he can destroy the galaxy?

822
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,215
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

823
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,335
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

824
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,215
Because I'm one of the idiots
who lives in it!

825
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,735
Peter, listen to me.

826
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,969
We cannot allow the Stone
to fall into Ronan's hands.

827
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,724
We have to go back to your ship,

828
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,370
and deliver it to Nova.

829
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,921
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

830
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,645
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

831
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,040
who's really nice

832
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,884
for a whole lot of money.

833
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,566
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

834
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,721
You're despicable.

835
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,401
Dishonorable.

836
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,041
Faithless!

837
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,330
- No.
- At last!

838
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,366
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

839
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,249
You called Ronan?

840
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,129
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

841
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,408
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

842
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,815
Ronan the Accuser!

843
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,415
You are the one
who transmitted the message?

844
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,771
You killed my wife.

845
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,529
You killed my daughter!

846
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,800
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

847
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,762
It is Gamora.
She is escaping with the Orb.

848
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,210
No!

849
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,321
Nebula,

850
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,810
retrieve the Orb.

851
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,243
The Stone
is in the furthest pod.

852
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,206
Bring it down!

853
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,929
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the <i>Milano.</i>

854
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,481
How? We've got
no weaponry on these things.

855
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,404
These pods are industrial grade.

856
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,760
<i>They're nearly indestructible.</i>

857
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,047
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

858
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,164
That's not what I'm saying.

859
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,324
Let me borrow your ride.

860
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,923
I don't recall killing your family.

861
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,608
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

862
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,084
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

863
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,721
I have to head out.

864
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,168
Wait! These things
aren't meant to go out there.

865
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,129
You are a disappointment, sister.

866
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,803
Of all our siblings,

867
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,165
I hated you least.

868
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,846
<i>Nebula, please.</i>

869
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,644
If Ronan gets this stone

870
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,809
<i>- he'll kill us all.</i>
- Not all.

871
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,204
You will already be dead.

872
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,769
<i>Ronan, it is done.</i>

873
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,807
<i>Quill, come on.</i>

874
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,846
<i>Her body mods should keep her alive
a couple more minutes,</i>

875
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,002
<i>but there's nothing we can do for her.</i>

876
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,720
<i>These pods
aren't meant to be out here.</i>

877
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,241
<i>In a second, we're gonna be
in the same boat.</i>

878
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,081
Aw, damn it.

879
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,845
<i>Quill?</i>

880
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,764
Yondu! Yondu.

881
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,215
<i>This is Quill!</i>

882
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,801
<i>- My coordinates are 227K324.
- Quill.</i>

883
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,201
Quill, what are you doing?

884
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,805
Just outside Knowhere.

885
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,088
If you're there, come get me.

886
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,290
I'm all yours.

887
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,728
<i>Quill, don't be ridiculous.</i>

888
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,448
<i>Get back into your pod!</i>

889
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,883
<i>You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.</i>

890
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,963
You'll die in seconds!

891
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,441
Quill.

892
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,170
Quill?

893
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,330
What happened?

894
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,528
I saw you out there.

895
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,400
I don't know what came over me.

896
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,203
But I couldn't let you die.

897
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,441
I found something inside of myself.

898
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,050
Something

899
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,168
incredibly heroic.

900
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,446
I mean, not to brag,

901
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,920
but, objectively...

902
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,047
Where's the Orb?

903
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,121
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

904
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,327
What?

905
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,520
Welcome home, Peter.

906
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,165
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

907
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,767
Quill just got himself captured.

908
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,209
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

909
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,600
take on a frickin' army!

910
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,600
You're right.

911
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,402
I was a fool.

912
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,569
All the anger,

913
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,043
all the rage,

914
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,527
was just to cover my loss.

915
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:59,449
Boo-hoo-hoo.
"My wife and child are dead."

916
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,207
I don't care if it's mean!

917
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,249
Everybody's got dead people.

918
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,570
It's no excuse to get everybody else

919
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,649
dead along the way!

920
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,125
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

921
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,615
The only chance we got is
to get to the other side of the universe

922
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,529
as fast as we can and maybe,

923
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:26,322
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

924
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,165
I am Groot.

925
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,607
Save them? How?

926
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,525
I am Groot.

927
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,415
I know they're the only friends
that we ever had,

928
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,171
but there's an army
of Ravagers around them.

929
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,970
And there's only two of us!

930
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,240
Three.

931
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,126
Aw!

932
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,561
You're making me

933
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,290
beat... up

934
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,481
grass!

935
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,729
The Orb is in my possession,

936
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,365
as I promised.

937
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,045
<i>Bring it to me.</i>

938
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,528
Yes, that was our agreement.

939
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,930
Bring you the Orb,

940
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,647
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

941
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,362
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

942
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,522
I wonder what use I have for you.

943
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,205
<i>Boy,</i>

944
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,966
<i>I would reconsider your current course.</i>

945
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,361
Master! You cannot!

946
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,046
Thanos is the most powerful being
in the universe.

947
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,330
Not anymore.

948
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,401
You call me "boy!"

949
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,122
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice
on Xandar,

950
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,807
and burn it to its core!

951
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,928
Then, Thanos,

952
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,048
I am coming for you.

953
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,324
After Xandar,
you are going to kill my father?

954
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,643
You dare to oppose me?

955
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,695
You see what he has turned me into.

956
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,964
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

957
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,285
<i>You betray me?</i>

958
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,201
Steal my money?

959
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,924
Stop it! Leave him alone!

960
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,402
When I picked you up as a kid,

961
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,881
these boys wanted to eat you.

962
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,481
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

963
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,415
I saved your life!

964
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,602
Will you shut up about that? God!

965
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,135
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

966
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,935
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

967
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,521
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

968
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,166
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

969
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,446
You abducted me, man.

970
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,721
You stole me from my home
and from my family.

971
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,008
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

972
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,521
You're scared

973
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,855
because you're soft in here.

974
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,961
Here, right here!

975
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,321
Yondu!

976
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,775
Listen to me.

977
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,041
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

978
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,969
I know what he's got, girl.

979
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,447
Then you know we must get it back!

980
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,002
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

981
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,255
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

982
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,975
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

983
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,120
Sentiment?

984
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,323
Eating away your brain like maggots!

985
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,491
That's it.

986
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,207
No!

987
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,761
Sorry, boy.

988
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,447
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

989
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,840
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

990
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,921
If you kill me now,

991
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:57,210
you are saying goodbye to
the biggest score you have ever seen.

992
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,771
The Stone?

993
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,488
I hope you got something
better than that.

994
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,291
Because ain't nobody stealing
from Ronan.

995
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,811
We got a ringer.

996
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,371
Is that right?

997
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,887
She knows everything
there is to know about Ronan.

998
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,280
His ships,

999
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,010
his army.

1000
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,003
He's vulnerable.

1001
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,175
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

1002
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,761
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

1003
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,561
Let him go!

1004
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,806
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1005
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,735
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1006
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,968
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1007
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,327
<i>Attention, idiots.</i>

1008
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,200
<i>The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.</i>

1009
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,089
It's a weapon of my own design.

1010
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,366
What the hell?

1011
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,525
<i>If you don't hand over
our companions now,</i>

1012
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,007
<i>he's gonna tear your ship a new one.</i>

1013
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,924
<i>A very big new one!</i>

1014
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,924
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

1015
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,609
<i>- 5, 4, 3...</i>
- No! Wait, hold on!

1016
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,524
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1017
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,682
We figured it out! We're fine!

1018
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,400
<i>Hey, Quill.
What's going on?</i>

1019
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,655
You call that "figured it out"?

1020
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,001
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

1021
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,655
You want to talk about senseless?

1022
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,055
How about trying to save us
by blowing us up?

1023
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,975
We were only gonna blow you up
if they didn't turn you over!

1024
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,809
And how on earth
were they gonna turn us over

1025
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,520
when you only gave them
a count of five?

1026
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,961
We didn't have time
to work out the minutiae

1027
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,175
of the plan.

1028
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,575
This is what we get
for acting altruistically.

1029
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,682
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

1030
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,966
What's important now

1031
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,770
is we get the Ravagers' army

1032
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,175
to help us save Xandar.

1033
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,735
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

1034
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,520
who's just gonna sell
to somebody even worse?

1035
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,200
We'll figure that part out later.

1036
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,015
We have to stop Ronan.

1037
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,485
How?

1038
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,775
I have a plan.

1039
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,801
You've got a plan?

1040
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,321
Yes.

1041
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,921
First of all, you're copying me from

1042
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,451
- when I said I had a plan.
- No, I'm not.

1043
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,575
People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1044
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,440
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

1045
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,331
I have part of a plan!

1046
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,005
What percentage of a plan
do you have?

1047
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,571
You don't get to ask questions

1048
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,320
after the nonsense
you pulled on Knowhere.

1049
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,135
I just saved Quill.

1050
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,215
We've already established

1051
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,975
that you destroying the ship
that I'm on is not saving me.

1052
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,162
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

1053
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,400
I wasn't listening.
I was thinking of something else.

1054
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,520
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

1055
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,001
What percentage?

1056
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,575
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1057
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,015
Twelve percent?

1058
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,086
That's a fake laugh.

1059
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,055
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

1060
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:47,688
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

1061
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,920
because that is not a plan.

1062
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,451
It's barely a concept.

1063
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,601
You're taking their side?

1064
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,966
I am Groot.

1065
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,535
So what, it's better than 11%?

1066
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,135
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1067
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,367
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1068
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,327
See? Groot's the only one of you
who has a clue.

1069
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,361
Guys.

1070
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,281
Come on.

1071
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,535
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1072
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,040
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1073
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,363
I need your help.

1074
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,407
I look around at us.

1075
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,927
You know what I see?

1076
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,881
Losers.

1077
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,130
I mean, like,

1078
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,295
folks who have lost stuff.

1079
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,482
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1080
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,931
Our homes,

1081
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,051
our families,

1082
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,083
normal lives.

1083
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,971
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

1084
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,325
Today, it's given us something.

1085
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,050
It has given us a chance.

1086
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,565
To do what?

1087
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,765
To give a shit.

1088
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,329
For once.

1089
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,522
Not run away.

1090
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,895
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

1091
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,003
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

1092
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,726
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1093
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,848
it's impossible.

1094
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,647
You're asking us to die.

1095
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,209
Yeah, I guess I am.

1096
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,166
Quill.

1097
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,682
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1098
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,930
I will be grateful
to die among my friends.

1099
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,163
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1100
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,087
I will fight beside you.

1101
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,805
And in the end,

1102
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,808
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1103
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,923
I am Groot.

1104
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,483
What the hell.
I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

1105
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,721
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1106
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,362
We're all standing up now.

1107
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,855
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1108
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,565
The Stone reacts
to anything organic.

1109
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,815
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1110
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,003
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone
to the planet's surface and zap.

1111
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,810
All plants, animals,

1112
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,720
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

1113
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,048
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1114
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,968
<i>Rocket will lead a team
to blow a hole</i>

1115
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,288
in the <i>Dark Aster's</i> starboard hull.

1116
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,575
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1117
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,455
Won't there be
hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1118
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,324
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1119
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,640
Once they know we're on board,

1120
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:37,175
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1121
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,646
<i>Which I can disable
by dismantling the power source.</i>

1122
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,575
<i>We'll make it to the flight deck,</i>

1123
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,604
<i>and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer
to kill Ronan.</i>

1124
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,243
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

1125
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,842
Use these devices to contain it.

1126
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,611
If you touch it,

1127
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,691
it will kill you.

1128
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,495
<i>I'll contact
one of the Nova officers</i>

1129
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,815
<i>who arrested us.</i>

1130
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,680
<i>Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.</i>

1131
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,243
There's one more thing
we need to complete the plan.

1132
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,206
That guy's eye.

1133
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,646
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1134
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,131
that guy's eye.

1135
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,846
- No, seriously, I need it!
- It's important to me.

1136
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,255
<i>Ronan's fleet has been spotted,</i>

1137
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,406
<i>and will arrive in T-minus</i>

1138
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,164
<i>fifteen minutes.</i>

1139
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,050
Remember, boy.

1140
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,369
At the end of all this,

1141
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,806
I get the Stone.

1142
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,406
You cross me, we kill you all.

1143
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,371
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1144
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,120
This is a terrible plan.

1145
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,720
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1146
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,481
Nova Prime.

1147
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,246
I received a transmission

1148
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,640
from one of the Ravagers.

1149
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,840
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1150
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,375
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1151
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,606
Good God.

1152
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,683
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1153
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,375
Did he say
why we should believe him?

1154
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,562
He said his crew
just escaped from prison

1155
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,730
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1156
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,721
He says that he's an

1157
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,807
"a-hole."

1158
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,366
But he's not,

1159
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,289
and I'm quoting him, here,

1160
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,607
"100% a dick."

1161
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,046
Do you believe him?

1162
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,855
I don't know that I believe anyone
is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1163
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,804
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1164
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,521
Yeah.

1165
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,090
A fleet approaches.

1166
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,124
They appear to be Ravagers.

1167
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,281
Fire!

1168
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,801
<i>Cover it down.</i>

1169
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,883
Submerge!

1170
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,046
Rocket, hurry!

1171
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,766
All pilots, dive!

1172
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,081
<i>They're beneath us!</i>

1173
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,331
Evacuate the city.

1174
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,962
Our priority is to get our people
away from the battle.

1175
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,001
Forward thrust, now!

1176
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,521
Come on!

1177
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,844
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1178
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,650
Aw, hell!

1179
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,280
I'm going down, Quill!

1180
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,164
No more games with me, boy!

1181
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,367
I'll see you

1182
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,249
<i>at the end of this!</i>

1183
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,965
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1184
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,449
We'll never make it up there!

1185
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,606
<i>Peter Quill.</i>

1186
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,161
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

1187
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,608
For the record,
I advised against trusting you here.

1188
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,125
They got my "dick" message!

1189
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,721
Prove me wrong.

1190
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,089
Yes!

1191
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,361
Yes!

1192
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,569
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1193
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,205
The starboard kern has been breached!

1194
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,735
We have been boarded.

1195
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,171
Continue our approach.

1196
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,606
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1197
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,411
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1198
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,521
Seal security doors!

1199
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,855
Now!

1200
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,807
Get out of my way!

1201
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:06,089
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1202
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,126
<i>The Dark Aster
must not reach the ground.</i>

1203
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,846
Locked in!

1204
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,846
Locked in.

1205
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,401
We're locked in.

1206
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,887
I can barely see.

1207
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,969
When did you learn to do that?

1208
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,601
Pretty sure the answer is

1209
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,364
"I am Groot."

1210
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,046
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1211
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,648
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1212
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,407
It is pleasing to once again have

1213
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,041
friends.

1214
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,055
You, Quill, are my friend.

1215
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,286
Thanks.

1216
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,211
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1217
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,926
And this green whore, she, too...

1218
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,565
You must stop!

1219
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:13,205
Gamora, look at what you have done.

1220
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,888
You have always been weak.

1221
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,288
You stupid, traitorous...

1222
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,761
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1223
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,001
Head to the flight deck.

1224
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,811
I'll shut down the power
to the security doors.

1225
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,609
Yondu Udonta.

1226
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,242
Order your men
to turn on the Nova Corps.

1227
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,565
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1228
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,529
Time to die...

1229
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,287
Nebula, please.

1230
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,531
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1231
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,768
enact immolation initiative.

1232
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,855
They're dive-bombing the city!

1233
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,689
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1234
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,490
No! Hold your positions.

1235
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,531
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1236
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,375
<i>We'll take care of the people
down here.</i>

1237
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,607
I can't believe
I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1238
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,040
Star-Lord.

1239
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,521
Finally.

1240
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,487
You thief!

1241
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,204
You will never make it to Ronan.

1242
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,201
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1243
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,205
Come on!

1244
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,522
Finger to the throat means death.

1245
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,771
Metaphor.

1246
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,206
Yeah, sorta.

1247
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,521
No.

1248
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,931
Xandar!

1249
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,251
You stand accused.

1250
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:07,044
<i>Your wretched peace treaty will not</i>

1251
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:08,401
<i>save you now.</i>

1252
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:12,168
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1253
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,761
Rocket!

1254
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,729
Hold on, Saal, just...

1255
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,680
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1256
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,535
<i>The city's been evacuated,</i>

1257
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:12,215
<i>but we're getting our asses
kicked down here.</i>

1258
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,685
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1259
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,401
Nebula!

1260
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,480
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1261
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,165
You know he's crazy.

1262
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,648
I know you're both crazy.

1263
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,001
No!

1264
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:52,881
What the...?

1265
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,685
Get out!

1266
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,081
You did it!

1267
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:05,975
I was mistaken.

1268
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,570
I do remember your family.

1269
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,969
Their screams were

1270
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,248
pitiful. I...

1271
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,486
No, Groot!

1272
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,255
You can't.

1273
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,770
You'll die.

1274
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,163
Why are you doing this?

1275
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,810
Why?

1276
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,970
We

1277
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,441
are

1278
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,565
Groot.

1279
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,008
I called him an idiot.

1280
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,643
You killed Groot!

1281
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,131
Behold!

1282
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,535
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1283
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,095
What fruit have they wrought?

1284
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:17,295
Only that my father and his father

1285
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,881
shall finally know vengeance.

1286
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,281
People of Xandar,

1287
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,684
the time has come

1288
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,650
to rejoice and renounce

1289
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,007
your paltry gods!

1290
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:35,162
Your salvation is at hand.

1291
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,445
Listen to these words.

1292
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,204
Now bring it down hard!

1293
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,681
What are you doing?

1294
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,771
Dance-off, Bro. Me and you.

1295
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,611
Gamora.

1296
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,688
Subtle. Take it back.

1297
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,361
What are you doing?

1298
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,055
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

1299
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,730
No!

1300
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:15,849
Peter! Take my hand!

1301
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,282
Take my hand, Peter.

1302
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,611
Mom.

1303
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:28,168
<i>Take my hand!</i>

1304
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,568
You're mortal!

1305
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,006
How?

1306
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,455
You said it yourself, bitch.

1307
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,895
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1308
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:01,926
Well, well, well.

1309
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,561
Quite the light show.

1310
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,524
Ain't this sweet.

1311
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,566
But you got some business to attend to

1312
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:14,166
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1313
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,047
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1314
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,248
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

1315
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,375
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1316
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,323
but the only way
the universe can survive

1317
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,164
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1318
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,162
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1319
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,289
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1320
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,490
Hand it over, son.

1321
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,361
Yondu.

1322
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,728
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1323
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,806
You've seen what it does to people.

1324
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,801
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1325
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,286
It's probably good
we didn't deliver him to his dad

1326
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,401
like we was hired to do.

1327
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,251
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1328
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,735
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1329
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,283
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1330
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,164
I know.

1331
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,644
But he was about the only family I had.

1332
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,607
No.

1333
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,086
He wasn't.

1334
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,720
<i>Why would you even know this?</i>

1335
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,815
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1336
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,205
so we had it checked out.

1337
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,164
I'm not Terran?

1338
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,845
You are half Terran.

1339
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,641
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1340
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,361
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1341
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,920
That could be why you were able

1342
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,241
to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1343
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,480
Your friends have arrived.

1344
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,321
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1345
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:09,326
we'd like to express
our profound gratitude

1346
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:11,889
for your help in saving Xandar.

1347
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,411
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1348
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,164
he has something to show you.

1349
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,084
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1350
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:33,163
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1351
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:34,841
Yes.

1352
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,923
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1353
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,842
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1354
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:45,285
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1355
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,848
We salvaged as much as we could.

1356
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,286
Wow.

1357
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,961
I...

1358
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,086
Thank you.

1359
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,284
I have a family.

1360
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,290
They're alive because of you.

1361
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,327
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1362
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:11,485
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1363
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,081
Question.

1364
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:14,455
What if I see something
that I want to take,

1365
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,855
and it belongs to someone else?

1366
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,215
You will be arrested.

1367
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,481
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1368
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:21,962
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1369
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,167
No, I want it more, sir.
Do you understand?

1370
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,926
What are you laughing at?

1371
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,615
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1372
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,483
What if someone
does something irksome

1373
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,802
and I decide to remove his spine?

1374
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,481
That's...

1375
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,841
That's actually murder.

1376
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:41,171
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1377
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:44,164
So... also illegal.

1378
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:48,807
They'll be fine, Dey.

1379
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,681
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1380
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:51,841
You?

1381
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,250
Yeah. Me.

1382
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:18,765
<i>Peter,</i>

1383
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,728
<i>I know these last few months
have been hard for you.</i>

1384
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,571
<i>But I'm going to a better place.</i>

1385
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,206
<i>And I will be okay.</i>

1386
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:33,081
<i>And I will always be with you.</i>

1387
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,485
<i>You are the light of my life.</i>

1388
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,881
<i>My precious son.</i>

1389
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:43,764
<i>My little Star-Lord.</i>

1390
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,488
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

1391
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,690
So, what should we do next?

1392
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,001
Something good?

1393
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,166
Something bad?

1394
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,330
A bit of both?

1395
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:58,844
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1396
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:02,167
Bit of both.

1397
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,801
What do you let it
lick you like that for?

1398
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,685
Gross.

1399
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,210
<i>Yeah!</i>

1400
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,175
<i>But it burns going down.</i>
