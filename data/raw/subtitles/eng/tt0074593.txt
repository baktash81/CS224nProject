1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,932
Now, this area is pretty much
the same way it was

2
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:41,525
when the Indians
wandered around in it

3
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:45,098
That's because of this country's
national parks system centers

4
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,286
It's so much in the the national park system
to protect the wildlife,

5
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,024
the forest from thousands of campers coming here
every year

6
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:58,804
Now, I know that my opinion don't mean too much

7
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,539
but, I think if we get any further encroachment on
these park areas

8
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:06,156
we're going to destroy the natural beauty
of what you are looking at

9
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,771
If the government could somehow manage

10
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,264
to protect these areas,

11
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:14,877
we just might be able to keep this difficult,

12
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,452
completely American landscape like this forever

13
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:33,777


14
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:07,962
Never thought you'd make it!

15
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,950
I would'nt miss a Kelly briefing
for the world

16
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:17,511
Alright. This is the largest
post-season crowd we've ever had

17
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:21,041
There's no way with this crummy crew
that we're going to handle them

18
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:25,612
What Kelly's concerned about is we got more backpackers
pitching tents than raccoons in the woods

19
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:28,102
Okay,
now everybody goes out on patrol

20
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,303
There's no way we can keep an eye
on all those backpackers!

21
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:33,086
We'll just have to do the best we can

22
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,907
Okay, everyone knows where they're supposed to go.
So, so let's deal with it

23
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,478
Kelly...

24
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,013
My apologies.

25
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,799
Accepted

26
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,087
I'm going up to R4

27
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,079
You know, maybe the two of us should go!

28
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,614
It's really loaded up there, Kell'

29
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:53,270
Hey, come on
I can use the help

30
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,596
Well now, see, Hayes called in sick

31
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,465
So I'm going to need Gail here
to help hold down the fort

32
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,363
We tried!

33
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,565
- Look, I'll talk to you later for dinner
- Okay

34
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,825
Okay  girls, keep it moving

35
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,102
Even though the season's closed,
but that's no reason to lit out

36
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:25,042
If you get any complaints about cold food
I want to hear about them right away

37
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,030
Dad!

38
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:34,153
What are those?

39
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:35,184
Unpaid bills, I believe

40
00:06:35,777 --> 00:06:37,343
Aw, I must have put them in the wrong drawer

41
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,527
I'll take care of them right away

42
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:40,145
And I've been looking over the wine list

43
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:41,990
You know, you haven't been charging
nearly enough

44
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:43,052
Look what you've been paying!

45
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:44,766
I know what I've been paying

46
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,596
And?

47
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:48,319
Well, good wine at reasonable prices
brings the customers back

48
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,410
and they've been coming back

49
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:52,806
I know you've had a really good season, but ...

50
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,196
Allison. For the last two weeks
you've been trying to help me run my business

51
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:57,717
That's not true

52
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,934
Dad, every man needs
a helping hand

53
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:06,156
You told me that you were coming up here
to shoot pictures of  the changing seasons!

54
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:07,715
Well, I did. I am.
That's what I've been doing

55
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:12,285
Yeah, well keeping check on how your old man is doing
is not going to help you meet your deadline

56
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:13,312
I only got maybe a third to go

57
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:15,915
I mean, maybe thirty or forty more photographs

58
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:18,199
I got my publisher's note.
He'll wait

59
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:19,796
Allison

60
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:23,380
Why don't you write a how-to book

61
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:25,915
"How to avoid responsibilities"

62
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:28,102
Oh hell, I was supposed to meet you

63
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:29,865
Kelly, I'm sorry

64
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:31,870
Well, let's go

65
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,531
See you, Walt

66
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:46,668
It was really sweet of you to come and get me.
I really appreciate it

67
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,786
I should be angry

68
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,959
I mean, I said I'd take you around
but, I just might be needed

69
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,228
I'm an important person around here

70
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:54,935
Guilty as charged

71
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,297
You know what the problem is?

72
00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:58,919
The problem is you're spoiled

73
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,496
And.. your father did it

74
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:03,405
How long have you known me?

75
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:04,906
Oh, a few weeks

76
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:09,604
Then, why don't you just reserve judgment.
I mean, spoiled is a pretty heavy word

77
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,666
First of all, I don't feel spoiled.
I feel needed

78
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:15,853
I mean, Dad's taking a lot more
than he can handle so..

79
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,236
I feel just a bit torn between career
and father

80
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,871
You know, I think your father can handle
his end

81
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:25,531
It's yours you should be worried about

82
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:28,388
Somehow I always manage to get it together

83
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:05,277
At last

84
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:07,109
-We're here
-Finally

85
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:11,406
We must have walked 10 miles today

86
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:13,746
We got to do something with this

87
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:16,520
I want to sit down and get out of these boots

88
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:18,750
I feel a lot better

89
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:21,450
What's that?

90
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:24,265
ThereÂ´s something out there

91
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,383
Hey. You scared us

92
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:33,763
Sorry, I didn't mean to

93
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,121
What can we do for you?

94
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:36,752
Stay out of trouble

95
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,083
What kind of trouble?

96
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:40,438
Well, just don't take any unnecesary risks

97
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:42,282
This is a pretty tricky area

98
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:44,670
How long you girls going to be up here?

99
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,703
We're leaving shortly.
Right after we eat

100
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,782
Don't forget to check-in at the ranger station
before you leave

101
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:52,373
Don't worry,
we'll be down before it gets dark

102
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:52,777
Okay

103
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:56,516
Come on, boy

104
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,431
Well.. better be moving.
It's going to get dark pretty soon

105
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,141
You're right

106
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:58,473
You start on the tent and I'll get the fire

107
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:00,056
Okay, but I have to go first

108
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:02,781
Whenever it comes to cleaning up
you always have to go

109
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:05,037
Ha, ha
I'll be right back

110
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:06,005
June?

111
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:08,579
June?

112
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:27,047
You never stop shooting, do you?

113
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:30,700
Most of what I shoot I don't use.
Wrong angle, wrong light

114
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:31,782
Wrong faces

115
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,401
No, the faces are never wrong

116
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,601
Remember,
every face tells a story

117
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:36,930
Oh yeah?

118
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:39,220
What story
does this face tell you?

119
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:43,955
You're desending..

120
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:47,029
You hide everything behind
that tight jaw

121
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:49,978
One day it's going to break

122
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,756
See, it's cracking already

123
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:03,974
How you doing, Tom?

124
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:06,235
Hey. Where you going?

125
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,868
Up to R4.
Got a couple of missing girls

126
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:11,961
Oh?

127
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:13,195
Come on..

128
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:15,852
They said they'd be down before dusk.
They have'nt made it yet

129
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:19,479
Ah, they're not going to make it.
The sun will be down in a little bit

130
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:21,544
-Hey, you want to go up with him?
-Aha..

131
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,525
-We'll follow you, go ahead
-Okay

132
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:02,191
They were back there, past the shack.
Maybe a hundred, hundred fifty yards

133
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,441
Let's walk on in

134
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:22,965
Hey, hold it Tom.

135
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,123
I'm going to check out this shed

136
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:46,514
What the hell..?

137
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:00,385
Find anything?

138
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:01,905
No

139
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:02,984
How about you?

140
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:04,461
No, nothing

141
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:08,365
Tom

142
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:09,402
Yeah?

143
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:11,939
How far down are you?

144
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:14,636
Ah, about quarter of a mile from the shed

145
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,253
There's just nothing here

146
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:18,706
I can't tell wether a bear came through or not

147
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:21,447
Well, keep looking

148
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,027
Roger, out

149
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:26,974
We better keep looking

150
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:35,415
You all doing a hell of a job

151
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:39,319
You find anything?

152
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:42,073
-No sir, not a thing
All right. Keep at it

153
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:45,292
Remember, we're probably not looking for a full body

154
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,821
Kelly.. what the hell's going on?

155
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:50,983
A bear

156
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,230
He attacked and killed a girl

157
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:54,597
That's all we need. A killer bear on the loose

158
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:57,409
Well, there were two of them.
We haven't found the other one yet

159
00:16:57,606 --> 00:16:58,932
Reckon she made it out?

160
00:16:57,734 --> 00:17:01,012
No, too much blood around here for that

161
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,697
Well, what you want us to do?

162
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:06,979
Look, I got a bunch of guys up on the western slope

163
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,466
So ah, you guys go on up north

164
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:11,168
He just might go back up country

165
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:12,912
Check

166
00:17:14,954 --> 00:17:18,330
Allison.. Where are you going?

167
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:20,483
Back here to get another angle on the cam

168
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,613
Okay, but don't go too far

169
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:23,972
Hey, Kell..

170
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:26,357
-Yeah..
-Parker and I came up empty-handed

171
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,292
Well, look.
Get 'em back out there

172
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:30,866
Nobody sleeps until we
get that son-of-a-bitch

173
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:32,669
Hey, come on Kelly, you can't...

174
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:35,761
Tom we got a killer on our hands,
now no excuses, please

175
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,174
It was a big one alright

176
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:14,167
It seems to me..

177
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,374
the girls came across the cub,

178
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:18,196
got too close,

179
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,023
and the mother attacked

180
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:22,717
They didn't find any sign of a cub

181
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:25,250
They didn't find a sign of the bear anywhere

182
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,184
Well, she ate
and buried the rest of her meal for later

183
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,062
Why would she come down?

184
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:31,701
She came down for food

185
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:34,430
Oh shit. We hauled them up
to the high country last season ...

186
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,505
There is more than enough of food
and fish for them up there

187
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,377
Maybe she had enough fish

188
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:41,246
Hang on to your sick, Doc

189
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:44,083
It's not sickness.
She was hungry enough
to eat two women

190
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,189
Bears don't eat people

191
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,645
This one did

192
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:50,550
Hallitt, do me a favor

193
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,918
Just put it in writing for me

194
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:56,364
Who's ah.. going to contact the family?

195
00:18:59,894 --> 00:19:01,557
Me, I guess

196
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:05,003
Why the hell wasn't I notified?

197
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,989
Well, obviously you got the message

198
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,147
I had to hear it on the goddamn radio

199
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:15,470
Hey, I'm glad to hear that uh, you turn it on these days

200
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:18,478
If youÂ´ll excuse me, gentlemen

201
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:21,343
Aw, thatÂ´s okay, Hallitt,
I was just leaving

202
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:25,206
I want to see that report on...

203
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:32,308
Kelly..

204
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:34,882
Okay, letÂ´s hear it

205
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:37,209
What the hell happened out there?

206
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,873
One of our bears got lonesome

207
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:40,740
It wanted a little action

208
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,305
ItÂ´s not funny

209
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:48,133
Not supposed to be

210
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:50,415
What are you going to do?

211
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:54,280
Well, I've got men out on the field

212
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,937
I put R3 and R4 off-limits to campers

213
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,264
And I think we can contain it in that area

214
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,090
Okay

215
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:04,372
This time,
you keep me informed all the way

216
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,902
And when this thing is over with
I want a full investigation

217
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:11,601
Investigation?

218
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,590
What kind of investigation?

219
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,914
We have a responsibility to the public.
I mean it's my head

220
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,450
This bear is supposed to be in the high country

221
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,522
That's where we put it

222
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:24,514
Two possibilities..

223
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:26,385
Either he came back..

224
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,917
or you didn't do your job

225
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:29,955
No way

226
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,408
We tagged every one of those bears

227
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,895
Arthur Scott knows
every bear that's in this forest

228
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:37,930
No way he could have missed one

229
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,589
Okay, then Scott's the man I want to talk to

230
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,311
Now, you get him on the wire
and get his ass down here

231
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:44,143
Kelly!

232
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:51,493
I hope I'm not talking to myself

233
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:55,979
I read you... loud and clear

234
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:05,491
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special news bulletin

235
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,230
Two young women were savagely killed last night

236
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:11,348
by what the local authorities believe to be
a large bear

237
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,798
Michael Kelly, ranger in charge of operations

238
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:18,614
orders all backpackers in the high country
to evacuate the area immediately

239
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,024
Campers in all other areas of the park

240
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,940
should not venture
in the upper regions

241
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:25,723
until the rangers are certain the bear
has been apprehended

242
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:27,800
and the areas declared safe

243
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,626
If anyone should see this animal

244
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:33,863
please contact your local authorities
or the park ranger service immediately

245
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:38,516
Stay tuned to 1060 NEWS for further up-to-the-minute news bulletins

246
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:42,752
If Scottie is not in the office, where is he?

247
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,160
I was on the field..

248
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,066
You mean you...

249
00:21:49,478 --> 00:21:52,510
won't connect me or you can't connect me?

250
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,721
Well, you listen to me you little..

251
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,829
I've got 2 girls, aages 19 to 20
broken to the bone

252
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,614
So don't give me any of your bullshit about regulations

253
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:08,346
Now, you get Scottie on that field phone
or you're going to be in the unemployment line tomorrow morning.
You get that?

254
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,535
Yeah, I'm still here

255
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:15,367
Sit down

256
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,790
No.. no...

257
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:38,501
What the hell's the matter with you down there.
I gave strict orders..

258
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,038
Who is this?

259
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:41,989
It's Kelly, Scottie. Kelly!

260
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:44,332
Kelly, do you know what you just did?

261
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,700
I had a whole family of deer up here

262
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,818
I've been following them,
living with them

263
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:49,821
and you scared them off

264
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:51,131
What happened?

265
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:54,092
ItÂ´s a bear.. killed two girls, but..

266
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:57,580
a funny thing happened
is that he buried one of them

267
00:22:58,318 --> 00:22:59,978
But bears do that anyway

268
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,262
They cover their kill in a shallow grave

269
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:04,504
Then they go away.
They come back later and finish eating

270
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:07,330
Look, Kittridge is holding you and me responsible, so..

271
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:10,902
just pack it up and get your carcass
here as fast as you can

272
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:12,440
Alright

273
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:16,882
Who's Scott?

274
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,244
He's a naturalist attached to this department

275
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,645
You know,

276
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:29,675
I think he knows every bear
in this forest personally

277
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,372
You guys really love what  you doing, don't you?

278
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:35,695
Yeah.. I do

279
00:23:37,274 --> 00:23:38,894
I really do

280
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:42,960
It sure has changed my values around

281
00:23:43,415 --> 00:23:44,868
Changed your values?

282
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:46,988
How Kelly?

283
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:49,688
Well...

284
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,469
I had a perfect plan for fame and fortune

285
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:53,799
So what happened?

286
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:54,962
I took a shortcut

287
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:59,240
I married this beautiful lady

288
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,815
Just by chance she
was filthy rich

289
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:04,970
Trouble was, we were both mercenaries

290
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:08,958
And after a while, I just wanted out.
I couldn't take it anymore

291
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:09,954
You left?

292
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:14,273
Well, it was a little more subtle than that

293
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,305
I made believe I was having an affair

294
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:18,595
Got turned around

295
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,082
So I sold all my holdings.
Gave to the Salvation Army,

296
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:23,454
and became a ranger

297
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:24,936
That turned her off

298
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,550
You're lying , aren't you?

299
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:30,128
What do you think?

300
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:31,663
I really don't care

301
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,821
Well, weÂ´re down in Area 3 already.
I donÂ´t think heÂ´s going to come down this far

302
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:03,893
These woods are so damn thick
you can't see anything anyway

303
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,457
Yeah, he could be hiding anywhere

304
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:09,988
Well, one thing's for sure
He's not around here

305
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,480
Look,
why don't you go over and take a break

306
00:25:12,731 --> 00:25:15,636
I'll go up to Powder Ridge and check it out
and be back in fifteen minutes

307
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:17,670
Good. I'm going to set my feet in the stream

308
00:25:17,962 --> 00:25:18,501
Okay

309
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,344
Have another drink?

310
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,111
When will I stop remembering?

311
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:32,518
It should tke about 25 years

312
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,736
Jesus.. Poor Tom

313
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:40,492
He liked her,
didn't he?

314
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,382
There's something I'm not doing!

315
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:50,834
Sure, you're not killing the bear

316
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:55,857
I don't think I'm cut out for this

317
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:59,097
You know what I enjoy?

318
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,336
Giving lectures around a campfire ...

319
00:28:02,752 --> 00:28:04,123
showing slides ...

320
00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:05,992
Taking long rides in the woods...

321
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:09,399
Watching the animals

322
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:15,045
For a man who thought of himself a mercenary

323
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,454
you did pretty fine

324
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:21,168
Oh yeah. There is a killer bear out there
and I'm sitting right here crushing ice cubes in my mouth

325
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,266
Where the hell is that damn Scott?

326
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:27,299
He'll be here.
And there's nothing else you can do but wait

327
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,243
Oh yes there is. Except I'm too paralyzed
is what it is

328
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:35,016
You better have another drink

329
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:36,061
No

330
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:39,217
How about another ice cube?

331
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:41,750
Yeah

332
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:02,547
You know Don, I want to thank you for helping us out

333
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:05,484
Sure going to make finding that bear a lot easier

334
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,589
Maybe's got some kind of favorite cave

335
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:13,206
No, the reason we can't find him is..
he's moving

336
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:17,564
And he has a few million acres to cover his tracks

337
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:23,005
Well, if it goes near a clearing
we might just pick him up

338
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:25,870
Can you get this thing any closer?

339
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:27,407
No.. negative

340
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:29,069
Too much downdraft today

341
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:31,312
It might push it into the trees

342
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:37,583
Feel like I've been.. wearing these things permanently

343
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,465
Have you locked into any of its patterns yet?

344
00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:44,090
You know, bears got patterns

345
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:47,924
Patterns, yeah patterns.
He likes women.. keeps moving

346
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:50,731
-Sort of like me ...
-Always trolling

347
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,475
Yeah, yeah

348
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:55,093
What about that fillly you been riding?

349
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,075
Oh.. I didn't know it was that way now

350
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:02,525
No offense, my man

351
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:11,165
Hey.. take her down.
I think I see something

352
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:21,092
Oh boy! That might be our baby

353
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:45,306
Hold it, Kelly!

354
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:46,594
Are you crazy?

355
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:48,213
What the hell are doing up here?

356
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:49,500
Trying to find your bear!

357
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:52,241
Well youÂ´re supposed to be down at camp.
Kittridge is been all over me!

358
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,314
You better tell him that man
that bear is not one of ours

359
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,142
- You sure?
- Positive!

360
00:30:57,434 --> 00:30:59,220
Well you.. still should have come on down

361
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:00,672
Why? I can do better on my own

362
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:02,797
You almost got your tail shot off!

363
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:03,859
Hee hee. Almost!

364
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:05,905
Well, if you ain't a big bag of grits

365
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:09,102
What the hell you'd done
if you had caught that big brown?

366
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:10,847
It isn't a big brown

367
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:11,845
It's a grizzly!

368
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:12,676
Grizzly?

369
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,584
There ain't no grizzlies up here

370
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,116
I used to hunt these woods for years.
It can't be a grizzly

371
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:22,019
Come on Scottie, they were killed off
years ago. Big bounty hunt, remember?

372
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:24,097
This one survived

373
00:31:24,428 --> 00:31:26,713
I.. I'm telling you.
It can't be

374
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:29,775
I'm telling you we got a grizzly, and thensome

375
00:31:30,408 --> 00:31:32,776
Guys, I'm a little bushed
Can I hitch a ride back with you?

376
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:34,729
Yeah, come on

377
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:39,797
You know, the average grizzly, he's about 7 feet tall

378
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,747
Some are shorter

379
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,735
This one here is at least 15 feet

380
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:50,152
Oh no. Maybe in Alaska, just maybe,
but not down here

381
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:53,639
Right here.
I just checked the claw marks on the tree

382
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:56,058
Now, that means
he's established his territory ...

383
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:57,928
The whole damn forest?

384
00:31:58,218 --> 00:31:59,672
What you talking about is unreal

385
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:01,540
Wait, I got a little more ...

386
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:06,568
According to the depth of his paw prints
he weighs over 2 thousand pounds

387
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:09,559
You boys want a bite?

388
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:13,129
Look Scottie.
You may be some kind of authority on all this

389
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:17,241
but what you talking about
is science fiction, a fairy tale!

390
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,650
Science? yeah.
Fiction? no

391
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:24,550
See the only known grizzlies that large
were called Arctodus Ursus Horribilis

392
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:27,926
And they were the mightiest carnivores
in the Pleistocene era

393
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:29,422
Well, when was that?

394
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:30,712
About a million years ago

395
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,121
Ah, he's a mere baby then!

396
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:35,028
Ah well, he was a mighty ancestor
that managed to hang in there

397
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:38,018
What the hell is a million year old grizzly
doing here?

398
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,304
He's looking for food

399
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:43,045
They were.. strictly carnivore, those things

400
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:45,078
They sure do love meat

401
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:49,275
Well, in that case let's get the hell out of here

402
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:03,354


403
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:07,176


404
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:12,159


405
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:15,938


406
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,143
No!

407
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:24,552
No!

408
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:39,544
Stay away from her!

409
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:40,914
Stay away

410
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,281
Somebody, help

411
00:34:50,134 --> 00:34:51,879
Alright people, step back

412
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:54,535
Let's go now.
Go on back to your campsites

413
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,029
We got it here.
Go on back

414
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,685
Come on now.
Get those kids out of here

415
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:01,555
Let's go.
The show is over, come on

416
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:02,635
Everybody back to your campsite.
Let's go

417
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:06,871
Keep it moving.
That's it

418
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:14,761
Mr. Walker?

419
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:18,418
You can ride in the ambulance

420
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,155
Sally loved me, mister

421
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,315
She really dead?

422
00:35:26,764 --> 00:35:27,761
Come on

423
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:00,904
What the fuck happened?
You said it was in the heights!

424
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:02,233
I said that?

425
00:36:02,524 --> 00:36:03,894
Well, it came down

426
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:06,509
Kelly, this is your baby,
your responsibility

427
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:07,800
I wash my hands

428
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:10,832
Yet this is your park,
Mr. Director!

429
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:14,030
This is your area
So it's your bear

430
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:15,566
It is not the case

431
00:36:15,814 --> 00:36:17,018
You have not done your job, Scott

432
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,341
You are wrong,
was a grizzly killer on our hands

433
00:36:20,632 --> 00:36:23,997
Scott, you're mad
running with these costumes

434
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,659
There are no grizzly!

435
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:27,029
Scott. Come, let's go

436
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:29,354
Kelly, I want the fucking bear!

437
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,348
Send me the Washington reinforcement!

438
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,344
To make it a scandal?

439
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:36,290
Listen, let campers
hang their food,

440
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,534
bears the feel,
end of story!

441
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,402
Here, it's different!

442
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:43,309
This monster eats his victims!

443
00:36:43,644 --> 00:36:44,431
I have to say,

444
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:45,968
Four people were killed,

445
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:48,500
then stop these ridiculous quarrels

446
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,619
You have enough men available

447
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:53,109
Do your job or I'll take care!

448
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:55,976
Yes. of course

449
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:21,021
-If thereÂ´s a bear out there IÂ´m going to get him
-Not if I get him first

450
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:24,426
You be careful

451
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,618
You got the ammo, Charlie?

452
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:31,404
Yep, I got plenty

453
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:33,772
We'll flush thet old-boy out

454
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,721
Easy boys, easy.
Don't get rambuctious

455
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,682
Damn dogs

456
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:14,060


457
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,119
Hunters

458
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:22,198
What the hell are they doing out here?

459
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:24,275
They're probably looking for your bear

460
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:26,227
Who opened up this forest for the hunters, huh?

461
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:28,968
You know that those clowns they're going to shoot
everything in sight

462
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:31,876
Well, let them.
They might get that old bear for us

463
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:34,740
Yeah, including some of my rangers

464
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,692
Let's head back

465
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:02,817
Sheesh! What claws!

466
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:01,019
My God!

467
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,774
There are chairs in this room

468
00:41:40,183 --> 00:41:41,553
I will not sit ...

469
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:43,049
What do all those hunters out?

470
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:44,504
I have no choice

471
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,655
You just opened
hunt all the animals of the forest

472
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:51,645
My instructions are clear,
they hunt a bear

473
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:53,309
It's not a bear,
it is a grizzly

474
00:41:53,515 --> 00:41:54,512
It's not the same thing

475
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:56,381
A bear is a bear

476
00:41:56,838 --> 00:41:59,123
A bear is not necessarily a bear,
believe it

477
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:01,696
You have now
a band of drunks outside

478
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:03,440
These are not professional hunters

479
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:04,769
That I can not help it,

480
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:07,678
there are always a few freaks

481
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:09,506
I want them out of my forest

482
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,450
This is not your forest,

483
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:14,280
Kelly

484
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:20,760
These woods are full of campers

485
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:22,423
Not in R3 and R4 sectors

486
00:42:24,955 --> 00:42:26,576
You think they are
on marked trails?

487
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:27,655
There is no danger

488
00:42:27,905 --> 00:42:28,403
Bullshit!

489
00:42:29,523 --> 00:42:30,895
I'm done with it

490
00:42:31,188 --> 00:42:31,807
No.

491
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,258
I have a question for you

492
00:42:36,128 --> 00:42:37,539
Why are you on my back?

493
00:42:38,577 --> 00:42:40,655
I'm glad to hear you say

494
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,805
Kelly,

495
00:42:46,345 --> 00:42:47,591
You are a rebel

496
00:42:48,463 --> 00:42:50,954
There is no room here for the rebels

497
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,145
Listen up, Kittridge ...

498
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,011
While glandiez on your fat ass ...

499
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,798
I invested this forest

500
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:01,462
ÃÂcout...

501
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,083
No, you listen to me!

502
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,655
These hunters are in my area

503
00:43:07,028 --> 00:43:08,978
And I take care of them
as I see fit

504
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:11,388
Try and stop me!

505
00:43:14,296 --> 00:43:15,999
Scottie, wake up

506
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,573
- Tom?
- Yes

507
00:43:45,073 --> 00:43:47,148
- You okay?
- Fine

508
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,176
Bastard got a hold of a hunter.
He managed to get away

509
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:52,837
Where is he?

510
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:54,043
Over at the clinic

511
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:55,455
He's really beat up

512
00:43:55,953 --> 00:43:57,820
He was also one lucky hunter

513
00:43:58,651 --> 00:43:59,234
Yeah

514
00:44:00,646 --> 00:44:01,518
Okay, let's go

515
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:04,010
Hey Scottie. Will you take that over
to pick up his stuff

516
00:44:30,677 --> 00:44:32,584
Load in some extra rifles.
We'll need em'

517
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:43,051
I was feeling unloved

518
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:44,339
Well, so was I

519
00:44:44,587 --> 00:44:46,332
Glad you stopped by.
We're just getting ready to take off

520
00:44:46,665 --> 00:44:47,951
I'm coming with you

521
00:44:48,574 --> 00:44:50,153
Look, it's a butcher shop out there

522
00:44:50,527 --> 00:44:51,481
and you just couldn't handle it

523
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,604
I couldn't?

524
00:44:52,892 --> 00:44:54,388
Alright, maybe I couldn't handle it

525
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:56,217
Look, I'll stay out of your way

526
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,376
Honey, it's not safe out there,

527
00:44:58,626 --> 00:45:00,120
and I don't want to see you get hurt

528
00:45:00,371 --> 00:45:01,491
I mean, for both our sakes

529
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,943
Is that a line that's supposed
to make me feel grateful?

530
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:07,098
I don't feel like playing little boy-girl games

531
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:09,590
You just said the wrong thing!

532
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,579
Right, well just pack it up.
You're not coming with me

533
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:13,824
Damn, Kelly!

534
00:45:14,075 --> 00:45:16,194
I'm glad you see it my ways

535
00:45:16,484 --> 00:45:17,771
Really!

536
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:27,090
This just might be that old Grizzly's cub

537
00:46:27,379 --> 00:46:28,377
No way

538
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:30,787
It's possible

539
00:46:31,534 --> 00:46:32,986
Hey. Hey listen...

540
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,853
That thing might come in here after that cub

541
00:46:36,101 --> 00:46:37,182
LetÂ´s get him outta here

542
00:46:37,472 --> 00:46:40,047
HeÂ´s right.
Put him back in the wood

543
00:46:40,379 --> 00:46:42,331
Hey, I got an idea

544
00:46:42,622 --> 00:46:44,242
WeÂ´ll use this cub as bait

545
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:46,235
WeÂ´ll take it back in there.
Find us a clearing..

546
00:46:46,899 --> 00:46:47,981
We'll go in the blind..

547
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:50,059
When mama comes back...

548
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:50,971
Pow!

549
00:47:07,543 --> 00:47:09,327
ItÂ´s a lot different from deer hunting

550
00:47:10,863 --> 00:47:12,317
Yeah, that damn thing fights back

551
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:15,351
Hey, we gonna have to hold the noise down.
Damn thing won't come around

552
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,872
Shh

553
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,630
Whose stupid idea was it
to use that cub as live bait?

554
00:47:32,753 --> 00:47:33,540
It was mine

555
00:47:33,832 --> 00:47:35,534
Now, thatÂ´s the kind of bait we need to use, Kelly

556
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,442
It really doesnÂ´t make any
difference anymore, does it

557
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:40,642
Anybody see it happen?

558
00:47:40,893 --> 00:47:43,966
Nah. She just grabbed up the cub.
That was it

559
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:46,126
We know one thing for sure

560
00:47:46,374 --> 00:47:47,371
What's that?

561
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:50,114
Our grizzly is a he instead of she

562
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:51,692
Now, how the hell you know that?

563
00:47:52,021 --> 00:47:52,522
You been peeking?

564
00:47:52,813 --> 00:47:55,053
Don't have to.
Only the males are cannibalistic

565
00:47:55,385 --> 00:47:56,552
They'll eat a cub if they are hungry

566
00:47:56,967 --> 00:47:59,250
Yeah but..
does that help us any?

567
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,368
Sure does.
He's going to retrace his route

568
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:04,109
That means he's going to come back
the scene of his crime

569
00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:08,803
So then, he ah..
could still be around here

570
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:11,793
He could be listening to us right now

571
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,949
Well, if that's the case
maybe we can flush him out

572
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:16,028
Can we help?

573
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:23,297
Yeah, but we go by the book

574
00:48:23,879 --> 00:48:25,582
Everyone follows orders

575
00:48:25,872 --> 00:48:27,034
Call the shots, mister

576
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:28,115
What's your name?

577
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,111
Pat

578
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:32,184
Okay Pat. You and the rest of the guys
go up the north ridge

579
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:33,432
That's ah.. Pinto Pass

580
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:34,428
I know where it is

581
00:48:34,718 --> 00:48:37,167
Alright. We're going to spread
and hold  the line at Culvert Basin

582
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:39,909
Now, if he comes down ...
That's were he's coming down

583
00:48:40,076 --> 00:48:42,485
Hey listen!
You ole boys come down that ridge

584
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:45,267
and make like a war party.
Make a lot of noise, will you

585
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:47,717
Maybe that crazy will head towards us

586
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,290
Alright. We'll expect you to be in place
and ready to go at, ah..

587
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:52,495
-Daybreak.
-Well, let's get with it

588
00:48:52,826 --> 00:48:53,492
Okay

589
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:56,067
Tom, you're not going to be coming with us

590
00:48:56,315 --> 00:48:57,312
What?

591
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,136
You're not leaving me out of this, man.
No way

592
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:04,249
We're not leaving you out of anything.
I'm assigning you to Arrow Tower

593
00:49:04,455 --> 00:49:06,490
Don't do me any favors

594
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:09,398
Look, I can handle myself down here

595
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:11,432
Look. Cool off and listen

596
00:49:12,056 --> 00:49:14,215
Now, you know how thick it is down there

597
00:49:14,506 --> 00:49:19,324
Now, from up there
you might be able to spot it.
And you might get a crack at it

598
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,525
Yeah, and I might just get left out
of all this damn thing

599
00:49:21,816 --> 00:49:22,524
Tom..

600
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,014
You're not going to be left out of anything

601
00:49:25,346 --> 00:49:26,178
Okay?

602
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,451
Wish the hell it would hurry up
and get daylight

603
00:49:31,742 --> 00:49:33,278
It won't be much longer

604
00:49:33,612 --> 00:49:34,318
Tom?

605
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:36,809
It's still a little bit chilly this morning, though.
Ain't it?

606
00:49:37,846 --> 00:49:40,215
Yes.
Sort of cool for this time of year, anyway

607
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:42,333
- Come on
- Alright

608
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:44,741
Let's go

609
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:51,887
Let's keep it quiet, okay

610
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:10,864
Kelly, I 'd like to have the first shot

611
00:50:11,198 --> 00:50:13,232
Well, I can't promise you that

612
00:50:13,899 --> 00:50:16,803
See, we got a grizzly out there
that's at least 15 feet tall

613
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,422
Weighs maybe 2, 3 thousand pounds, right

614
00:50:19,837 --> 00:50:20,958
I want to capture it

615
00:50:21,248 --> 00:50:22,079
You what?

616
00:50:23,283 --> 00:50:24,199
You want to capture it?

617
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:25,402
That's right

618
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,221
He's not kidding

619
00:50:29,555 --> 00:50:32,464
I've been developing these
brand new tranquilizing shells

620
00:50:32,794 --> 00:50:34,249
Oh Christ...

621
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:37,281
That shell won't penetrate
a hair of its chinny-chin-chin

622
00:50:37,573 --> 00:50:39,439
Not trying to kill him with it, mister.
Just want to put him to sleep

623
00:50:39,689 --> 00:50:42,845
Oh yeah well..  that's fine.
But first you got to knock him down.
That baby won't do it

624
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:44,715
We'll see about that

625
00:50:47,122 --> 00:50:49,367
I sure hope you ain't out there alone

626
00:50:49,658 --> 00:50:51,403
You're liable to become its friends

627
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:53,935
I figure, that old grizzly's hungry
by now

628
00:50:54,227 --> 00:50:58,090
For a while. I told you he just ate the cub.
I doubt if he's hungry now

629
00:50:58,422 --> 00:50:59,419
Oh yeah?

630
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:03,321
Well, that was merely an appetizer,
my man

631
00:51:03,653 --> 00:51:06,684
I figure that old grizzly got his taste
for human flesh and he's eating

632
00:51:06,975 --> 00:51:08,387
nothing else

633
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,718
That's pretty ridiculous

634
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,171
It is, huh?

635
00:51:11,461 --> 00:51:13,455
Well, let me tell you a little story, boy

636
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:17,649
A long time ago this tribe of Indians
came into these woods

637
00:51:18,565 --> 00:51:20,972
They's was all laid down with the pox, uhh

638
00:51:21,595 --> 00:51:23,922
something I can't remember..

639
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:27,700
Anyway, this herd of grizzlies
smelled them out

640
00:51:29,695 --> 00:51:31,978
They come in, they ate 'em

641
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:35,095
They tore them all up

642
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:36,673
Little children..

643
00:51:37,169 --> 00:51:39,289
the sick.. everybody

644
00:51:40,743 --> 00:51:44,064
There's a few braves just
healthy enough to go out on the hunt

645
00:51:44,606 --> 00:51:46,557
They came back..

646
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:49,839
and the grizzlies turned on themed

647
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:53,368
So, they had a new situation

648
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,897
A whole herd of man-eating grizzlies

649
00:51:57,646 --> 00:51:59,598
was just parading around

650
00:52:00,304 --> 00:52:02,172
tearing up the Indians

651
00:52:03,709 --> 00:52:05,495
That's pretty hard to believe

652
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:08,735
Unless you happened to be one of them Indians

653
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:15,006
Kelly

654
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:17,541
I can still root him out my own way

655
00:52:17,914 --> 00:52:19,035
Hell, I can look like him..

656
00:52:19,326 --> 00:52:20,365
I can smell like him

657
00:52:20,696 --> 00:52:22,065
Now, give me a chance.
Let me go in

658
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:23,560
You got a dime?

659
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,306
I'm going to call his mama!

660
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:30,333
I mean, does your mama know that you're running
around out here in the woods trying to act like a bear..

661
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:32,949
smell like one.
You scratching around on the ground like one?

662
00:52:33,238 --> 00:52:36,147
I mean, does she know that you're making
a damn fool of yourself..

663
00:52:36,437 --> 00:52:39,510
you're chasing something about the size
of a V8 Cat with teeth?

664
00:52:40,382 --> 00:52:42,710
You know, I think your mama would be a little disappointed

665
00:52:43,415 --> 00:52:44,494
Maybe

666
00:52:46,986 --> 00:52:50,683
But not nearly as disappointed
as she would be if she had you for a son

667
00:52:51,013 --> 00:52:51,638
Sonny!

668
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:52,968
Scottie

669
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:55,167
Scottie!

670
00:52:57,078 --> 00:52:58,616
Who spotted him first?

671
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:00,567
You get a crack at him

672
00:53:01,189 --> 00:53:03,598
But I don't want
you going out in those woods alone

673
00:55:04,376 --> 00:55:05,248
Post, here

674
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:08,239
You see anything moving out there at all?

675
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,895
Only your hunters tearing up the forest

676
00:55:13,098 --> 00:55:15,589
Well, keep looking.
He has to be out there someplace

677
00:55:42,337 --> 00:55:43,459
Jesus

678
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:46,366
It's the grizzly!

679
00:55:47,694 --> 00:55:48,940
Hold on Tom, just hold on.
We're on our way

680
00:55:53,011 --> 00:55:54,713
Come on Don

681
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,237
We're there.. we're almost there

682
00:57:34,764 --> 00:57:36,925
...how the bear thing is being handled?

683
00:57:37,215 --> 00:57:39,914
Okay, I guess.
I mean, they kept the bear away from here ...

684
00:57:40,163 --> 00:57:41,161
if that's what counts

685
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:43,943
I surely feel sorry for that
poor forest ranger, though

686
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:45,478
Yeah, I think we all feel the same way

687
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:48,969
I'm sorry

688
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:50,462
So am I

689
00:57:50,754 --> 00:57:52,126
Is there anything I can do?

690
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,032
No, he had a family

691
00:57:58,314 --> 00:57:59,767
Send some flowers

692
00:58:05,623 --> 00:58:07,159
I've got a plan

693
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:10,068
But I need time and men

694
00:58:11,603 --> 00:58:12,060
Kelly, I'm not...

695
00:58:12,392 --> 00:58:12,891
Listen!

696
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:15,963
Just listen to me

697
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:20,740
He got Tom here

698
00:58:21,862 --> 00:58:24,437
Now, his first..
his first killing took place up here

699
00:58:25,144 --> 00:58:26,929
He circled and killed..

700
00:58:27,429 --> 00:58:28,880
circled and killed..

701
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,205
He circled and found and killed Gail here

702
00:58:31,747 --> 00:58:33,949
And he circled again,
got behind us..

703
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:35,152
..and killed Tom

704
00:58:36,648 --> 00:58:40,261
Now, I think he's gonna continue heading down
looking for human food

705
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:41,964
That thing seems to..

706
00:58:42,254 --> 00:58:43,086
..know what we're thinking

707
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:45,370
Now, I'd like to get the jump on him this time

708
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:49,689
A grizzly is an animal, Kelly.
Don't give him human qualities

709
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:56,873
He's not even listening to you, Kelly

710
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,569
See, he doesn't understand that we're dealing with a..

711
00:59:01,068 --> 00:59:02,937
..highly intelligent beast

712
00:59:04,142 --> 00:59:05,178
Scottie..

713
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:07,381
Scottie!

714
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:10,498
Will you take that sandwich outside and eat it

715
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:13,694
Please?

716
00:59:23,163 --> 00:59:24,368
Charley!

717
00:59:25,241 --> 00:59:27,526
Close the park
and give me another crack at it

718
00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:31,886
There is no need.. to close the park

719
00:59:33,464 --> 00:59:37,327
Do you know that there are more..
more reporters out there and TV cameramen..

720
00:59:37,659 --> 00:59:40,067
..than there are animals in this goddamn circus

721
00:59:40,356 --> 00:59:41,188
I invited them

722
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,764
You invited them?

723
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:48,207
I want them to see the kind of clean,
thorough job that we are capable of doing

724
00:59:49,121 --> 00:59:50,409
You're kidding!

725
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:54,146
We have five dead people.
One raving, almost dead man

726
00:59:54,397 --> 00:59:55,975
And you call that.. clean?

727
00:59:56,265 --> 00:59:57,178
We are doing everything I...

728
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:57,886
Bullshit!

729
00:59:58,218 --> 00:59:58,508
Kelly!

730
00:59:58,841 --> 01:00:00,628
You know, I just figured you out

731
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:04,115
You don't give a good goddan if we
get that grizzly or not

732
01:00:04,406 --> 01:00:06,232
As long as you get your press

733
01:00:06,525 --> 01:00:10,552
so you can go to Washington and
get one of those nice dark brown plastic offices

734
01:00:10,802 --> 01:00:11,549
Get out!

735
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:16,575
Well, you just lost your office

736
01:00:16,865 --> 01:00:18,234
'cause when I'm finished with you..

737
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:21,932
..there's not gonna be anybody there
waiting to shake your gooshy, bloody hand!

738
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:24,506
You are finished, dismissed, removed!

739
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:27,331
In your...

740
01:00:32,024 --> 01:00:36,927


741
01:00:57,234 --> 01:00:59,644
Does not
the weight of the world on your shoulders ...

742
01:00:59,935 --> 01:01:01,304
They are not wide enough

743
01:01:02,801 --> 01:01:04,297
Yeah, I mean ...

744
01:01:04,709 --> 01:01:06,621
What they know these fighters?

745
01:01:07,243 --> 01:01:09,279
The rangers know hunting

746
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,224
You know what, Scottie?

747
01:01:13,972 --> 01:01:18,168
You know the real kick
I could do with this property?

748
01:01:18,459 --> 01:01:21,364
Finally, if it was a private property ...

749
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:24,481
I would divide while plots

750
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:25,850
Do what you want

751
01:01:27,389 --> 01:01:30,627
If you want to give up,
That's your problem.

752
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,579
Scottie, do me a favor

753
01:01:33,866 --> 01:01:34,906
Go back home

754
01:01:37,188 --> 01:01:38,767
I have this grizzly

755
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:40,305
What?

756
01:01:40,638 --> 01:01:41,635
You heard me

757
01:01:44,707 --> 01:01:46,824
Stay out of the forest

758
01:01:47,073 --> 01:01:47,863
What for?

759
01:01:48,154 --> 01:01:50,063
This is not just a job for me

760
01:01:50,396 --> 01:01:52,183
The forest is like home

761
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:54,881
I love it and I'll find it

762
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:57,832
You're crazy, completely crazy

763
01:02:00,157 --> 01:02:01,238
It's possible

764
01:02:02,567 --> 01:02:06,427
Meanwhile, you can stay here,
and whining about your little pride

765
01:02:06,761 --> 01:02:08,007
Not to mention your Scotch

766
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:10,623
I'm going to find our ursus horribilis

767
01:02:32,055 --> 01:02:33,883
Robert, you stay close now.. you hear?

768
01:02:36,415 --> 01:02:37,619
Do you hear me?

769
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:39,487
Yes, Ma'am

770
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:32,690
Mommy!

771
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:33,355
Help!

772
01:03:45,026 --> 01:03:45,651
No!

773
01:04:33,037 --> 01:04:33,992
I am lone...

774
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:34,949
Yes

775
01:04:36,194 --> 01:04:37,689
Everyone goes?

776
01:04:39,058 --> 01:04:39,848
Yes

777
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:43,546
That includes the press, mister

778
01:04:44,459 --> 01:04:45,912
Park is closed

779
01:04:46,204 --> 01:04:47,865
People have a right to know

780
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:49,651
Oh, you got your story

781
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:52,349
The story is about greed

782
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,133
I do not want him to go to Washington

783
01:04:55,631 --> 01:04:57,460
I'm feeling sorry for myself

784
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,409
Hey, that's a good lead line for the story

785
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,405
Well, your hands aren't clean either, pal

786
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:04,850
You and your cameras made it so exciting..

787
01:05:05,182 --> 01:05:06,180
so attractive..

788
01:05:06,471 --> 01:05:08,258
We tell like it was

789
01:05:08,963 --> 01:05:11,372
There's only one person
who can tell t like it was

790
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:13,699
And that's little Bobby

791
01:05:14,238 --> 01:05:15,443
He's alive?

792
01:05:16,561 --> 01:05:17,934
Part of him is

793
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,924
If we get him to the city hospital in time..

794
01:05:22,629 --> 01:05:24,080
..he will...

795
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:05,447
It feels like Nam all over again

796
01:06:06,153 --> 01:06:07,690
That special excitement

797
01:06:08,937 --> 01:06:10,556
Ah, we'll get him this time

798
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:11,926
You think so, huh?

799
01:06:12,217 --> 01:06:13,586
Well, I don't got a choice

800
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,785
Hey listen, I wanted to thank you, ah..

801
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:18,944
I'd be in over my head without your help

802
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:20,650
You getting it

803
01:06:25,008 --> 01:06:26,007
Alright

804
01:06:26,754 --> 01:06:28,705
If this ain't all ironic

805
01:06:29,663 --> 01:06:32,360
Now, in Nam I had about 100..

806
01:06:33,273 --> 01:06:35,807
..maybe 200 Gooks

807
01:06:36,721 --> 01:06:37,802
People..

808
01:06:38,465 --> 01:06:41,621
We called them Gooks
so it wouldn't get personal

809
01:06:43,075 --> 01:06:45,983
But it did get personal, anyway

810
01:06:46,647 --> 01:06:49,887
So I stopped counting
and tried to stop caringe

811
01:06:51,672 --> 01:06:52,917
You know..

812
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:55,412
..now I don't kill nothing no more

813
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:57,280
Not even a fly

814
01:06:57,611 --> 01:06:59,065
Made myself that promise

815
01:06:59,356 --> 01:07:00,437
I'm sorry

816
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:03,219
No, sorry ain't necessary

817
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,835
It's my choice.
I could've said no

818
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,618
Where's Scott?

819
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,442
Ah.. he went out to ride on his own

820
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:11,942
He's crazy

821
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:13,395
You know, that boy is weird

822
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:47,574
What makes you think
this old bear booted back up country?

823
01:07:47,991 --> 01:07:51,520
Well, what we know about grizzlies.
They don't like to stray

824
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,098
This one made it into town

825
01:07:54,428 --> 01:07:55,840
I call that straying

826
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:58,041
No, I think he is just lost

827
01:07:58,332 --> 01:08:00,284
He wants to go home where it's safe

828
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:03,691
We gonna help him go home?

829
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:39,117
Here!

830
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,489
I got one

831
01:08:40,737 --> 01:08:43,603
No. That Army Rem you got
ain't gonna get what we need

832
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:47,963
This here is 30.06 with a K4 scope on it
for fast shooting

833
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:49,752
You gonna need it

834
01:08:53,902 --> 01:08:55,356
Hold this, will you

835
01:09:03,912 --> 01:09:06,363
I wish my mom had taught me
how to tie a knot

836
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,017
Just take it over there somewhere

837
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:09,933
Good

838
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:15,873
You get kinda downwind.
That old bear might smell us now and won't come on after it

839
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,601
You could help

840
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:43,119
Ahh.. that mother's heavy

841
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:44,115
Okay

842
01:09:44,945 --> 01:09:46,316
HoHold it right thereld it right.

843
01:09:47,603 --> 01:09:49,723
I am holding it right there

844
01:09:50,054 --> 01:09:51,259
Don, would you...

845
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:53,377
Lift? What do you think I'm doing?

846
01:10:01,308 --> 01:10:03,012
Come here, sweetheart

847
01:10:03,344 --> 01:10:04,300
Okay

848
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:08,536
Here

849
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,814
I'll going back to get the rest of the gear

850
01:10:13,312 --> 01:10:14,184
Alright

851
01:10:14,517 --> 01:10:16,095
I'll start on the blind

852
01:11:05,103 --> 01:11:05,974
Don!

853
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:08,592
Right here. He's on the run

854
01:12:15,584 --> 01:12:16,914
We lost him

855
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:19,488
We were right behind him

856
01:12:20,194 --> 01:12:21,649
I don't know about that

857
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:23,226
He's gone

858
01:12:24,472 --> 01:12:27,131
Christ! We must have run a mile

859
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:32,862
Only thing to do is to go back to.. the copter

860
01:13:12,067 --> 01:13:13,811
Aw.. son of a bitch

861
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,098
He figured us out

862
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,466
He took us out and then circled back

863
01:13:18,839 --> 01:13:20,375
That's what he did

864
01:13:20,707 --> 01:13:24,195
Just like, ah.. a couple of his toys

865
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:25,692
We are

866
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:28,389
You know, he could circle back and try again

867
01:13:28,974 --> 01:13:31,920
Well, don't even say that.
We gotta try and get some sleep

868
01:13:32,253 --> 01:13:35,077
It's too late for hunting now.
Let's go on back to the chopper

869
01:13:35,368 --> 01:13:36,531
Alright

870
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,576
Are you sure you wanna take the first watch?

871
01:15:19,573 --> 01:15:21,109
Oh, ah.. by the way...

872
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,559
..just in case you should fall asleep..

873
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:25,678
..and feel a wet snout on the face..

874
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:27,755
..whatever you do don't move

875
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:30,246
..and don't kiss it back because it ain't me

876
01:15:30,536 --> 01:15:31,990
Hah.. that ain't funny

877
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:33,861
You know.. you're right!

878
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:07,278
Kelly.. come in Kelly

879
01:18:09,275 --> 01:18:10,480
This is Kelly, Scottie

880
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:12,224
Where the hell are you!

881
01:18:12,556 --> 01:18:13,637
Never mind that. Just listen to me

882
01:18:13,968 --> 01:18:15,337
I found a partially eaten buck

883
01:18:16,086 --> 01:18:17,829
That must be one that we gutted

884
01:18:18,992 --> 01:18:20,073
What are you talking about ?

885
01:18:20,572 --> 01:18:22,149
Never mind. Where are you?

886
01:18:23,103 --> 01:18:24,807
I think it was our that was our grizzly
that was doing the eating

887
01:18:25,557 --> 01:18:27,592
Where the hell are you, Scottie!

888
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:29,834
What do you want.. topos coordinates

889
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,781
No, a street and zip will do

890
01:18:33,404 --> 01:18:34,026
Alright

891
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:36,726
I'm above R4 and Zone 821

892
01:18:37,724 --> 01:18:38,888
Okay. Stay there

893
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:39,675
No. Listen, on second thought
get the hell out of there

894
01:18:40,381 --> 01:18:43,373
He might be coing back
for the rest of his meal

895
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,367
That's just what I'm hoping for

896
01:18:45,656 --> 01:18:49,062
Look. I got a roll.
I'm going to put a rope around his neck and haul
him through the woods to where you fellas are

897
01:18:49,478 --> 01:18:50,642
With any luck our friend is going to follow

898
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:51,389
Negative

899
01:18:51,678 --> 01:18:53,340
I'm leaving right now.
I'll meet you halfway

900
01:18:54,586 --> 01:18:55,376
Scottie.

901
01:18:56,827 --> 01:18:57,990
Scottie!

902
01:23:07,726 --> 01:23:10,010
Disseminates details

903
01:23:10,634 --> 01:23:12,501
and tell them to pick him up

904
01:23:53,246 --> 01:23:57,109
..goes up and down like some kind of yo-yo

905
01:23:57,897 --> 01:24:00,099
I'm getting ready to kill again and can't hardly wait

906
01:24:02,509 --> 01:24:04,333
I kinda liked that old boy

907
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,483
You know, when I was kidding around with him
I never meant him no insult

908
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:11,729
I know

909
01:24:14,803 --> 01:24:16,090
You know, Don..

910
01:24:17,999 --> 01:24:20,450
..you two were a lot alike

911
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:40,967
Let's have another look at that grid map

912
01:24:46,866 --> 01:24:47,362
There

913
01:24:47,654 --> 01:24:49,067
Right there. That's were he's going

914
01:24:49,397 --> 01:24:51,183
Back to his first kill

915
01:24:51,515 --> 01:24:52,596
It's incredible!

916
01:24:52,886 --> 01:24:55,960
He's programmed.
Like some kind of damned computer

917
01:24:56,956 --> 01:24:58,160
How? Why man?

918
01:24:58,699 --> 01:25:00,070
Hell, I don't know

919
01:25:00,445 --> 01:25:03,022
Why do salmon swim back upstream
where it all began?

920
01:25:28,063 --> 01:25:29,227
You're getting kind of close

921
01:25:30,681 --> 01:25:32,757
Have faith, brother!

922
01:25:36,538 --> 01:25:38,904
Ooh man. He's  really moving

923
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:41,561
Let's give the son-of-a-bitch
a run for his money

924
01:26:00,419 --> 01:26:01,956
I think we lost him

925
01:26:14,832 --> 01:26:16,658
I see him. I see him

926
01:26:19,232 --> 01:26:20,644
It's a mother-lovin runner

927
01:26:37,506 --> 01:26:40,995
Just takes one rocket.
We'll get that damn launcher and blast it

928
01:26:44,027 --> 01:26:45,688
Set her down

929
01:26:46,354 --> 01:26:47,517
You sure?

930
01:26:48,016 --> 01:26:49,427
Yeah, let's go in after him

931
01:26:49,676 --> 01:26:51,752
He's tired, he's scared. He needs to come back out

932
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,700
Alright

933
01:27:30,391 --> 01:27:31,591
Oh shit..

934
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:13,292
Aargh.. Kelly..
