1
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:55,811
Um... you have no
actual medical training?

2
00:00:56,061 --> 00:01:00,607
No. I have kids.
Learned a lot right there.

3
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:05,571
I've seen nurses give my son
throat cultures, and what is it?

4
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:08,907
You stick a giant Q-tip
down their throat and wait.

5
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:13,704
Urinalysis: You take that dipstick
to see if the white count's high.

6
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:15,414
Yes, I understand.
-Yeah.

7
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:17,249
I'm great with people.

8
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:21,420
You'd have to observe me
to know for sure. Trust me on that.

9
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:25,382
I'm a fast learner.
Show me in a lab once...

10
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,676
...and I've got it down.

11
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:32,264
I always wanted to go
to medical school.

12
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:35,434
That was my first interest.
Then I got married...

13
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:38,270
...and had a kid too young
and blew that.

14
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,023
Out of high school, I got a job...

15
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,942
...with Fleuer Engineers in Irvine.

16
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:47,237
I fell madly in love with geology.

17
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,199
Geology?
-Yeah.

18
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:52,492
I learned how to read maps.

19
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,621
Yeah. But I lost my job because...

20
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,790
...my boy got chickenpox,
104 temperature.

21
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,127
My ex-husband was useless, so...

22
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:04,171
That didn't really work out.

23
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:13,138
You got a really nice office.

24
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:16,683
Thanks.

25
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:22,981
Look...

26
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:56,098
Oh, fuck!

27
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:06,942
Goddamn it!

28
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,816
Good morning, Mr. Masry.

29
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,943
Morning, Rosalind.
-How are you?

30
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:53,655
-I'm fine. And you?
-Very well. Thank you for asking.

31
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,826
Good morning.

32
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:03,457
How you doing?
Donald.

33
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:05,334
Did you see it last night?

34
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,669
I taped it.
Don't tell me what happens.

35
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,213
It was so good.

36
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:11,590
Your nine o'clock's here already.

37
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:22,893
-Remind me.
-Erin Brockovich.

38
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:26,188
Car accident.
Not her fault, she says.

39
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,690
She was referred.

40
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:37,282
-Erin, hi.
-Hi.

41
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,369
Ed Masry. Sorry you had to wait.

42
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:42,329
That's okay.

43
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:45,582
Here, sit. Sit down.

44
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:55,384
Thank you.

45
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:01,890
I never thought standing
could take it out of you.

46
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,142
Ever since that shithead hit me...

47
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:06,562
...it's like my body's
put together wrong.

48
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:08,021
You poor thing.

49
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:12,192
Did anyone ask if you wanted coffee?

50
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:15,112
-Yeah. I'm fine.
-Good.

51
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:19,783
Listen, whoever did this to you
made one hell of a mistake.

52
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:24,162
And you and me, we're gonna
make him pay for it.

53
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:28,000
So, uh...

54
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,419
...why don't you
tell me what happened?

55
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:35,007
I was pulling out real slow,
and out of nowhere...

56
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:39,428
...his Jaguar comes racing around
the corner like a bat out of hell.

57
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:43,765
They took some bone from my hip
and put it in my neck.

58
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:46,310
I don't have insurance...

59
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:50,230
...so I'm about $17,000
in debt right now.

60
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,068
I couldn't take painkillers. They made
me too groggy to take care of my kids.

61
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,780
Matthew's 8,
and Katie's almost 6.

62
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:01,283
And Beth's just 9 months.

63
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:03,577
I just wanna be a good mom...

64
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:06,914
...a nice person, a decent citizen.

65
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:09,791
I just wanna take good care
of my kids.

66
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:13,795
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

67
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,592
Seventeen thousand in debt?

68
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:21,678
Your ex-husband helping?

69
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:23,138
Which one?

70
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:26,683
There's more than one?

71
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,895
Yeah, there's two. Why?

72
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:38,987
You must have been feeling
desperate that afternoon.

73
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:40,656
What's your point?

74
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:43,325
Broke, three kids, no job.

75
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,662
-Doctor in a Jaguar is a meal ticket...
-Objection.

76
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,413
-Sustained.
-He hit me!

77
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:49,540
So you say.

78
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:52,584
He came tearing around the corner,
out of control.

79
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:57,840
An ER doctor, who spends his days
saving lives, was out of control?

80
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,718
That asshole smashed in
my fucking neck!

81
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:06,557
Open and fucking shut?!

82
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:09,893
-Exactly the language...
-It was over before that!

83
00:07:10,102 --> 00:07:11,770
I told you he might get personal.

84
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:13,981
-You said I was set.
-I never said that.

85
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:16,608
You told me I had a good shot!

86
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:20,571
-Let's settle down.
-Fuck "settle down"! I've got $74.

87
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:24,449
-I can't afford to settle down!
-I'm sorry, Erin.

88
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:30,747
Do they teach lawyers to apologize?
Because you suck at it.

89
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:05,991
Hello?

90
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:08,202
-Hi.
-Hi, Erin.

91
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:10,787
You're back so soon.

92
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,624
Were you a good girl?

93
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:17,461
You're my little baby.
What is that? A little cough?

94
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:18,795
She's got a cough.

95
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:22,549
I sat in the steam with her
to try to loosen it up.

96
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,594
-I think I've got cough medicine.
-Bueno.

97
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:28,096
Listen.

98
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:30,224
I didn't wanna tell you before.

99
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:32,518
-With your worries.
-What?

100
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,313
My daughter bought a big house
with a room for me.

101
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:38,148
I'm moving in with her.

102
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:39,816
-When?
-Next week.

103
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,612
-Next week?
-I know. But it's good for me.

104
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:46,490
Now I can help
take care of my grandkids.

105
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,824
It's good for you.

106
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:50,869
Now with money, you can hire
a good babysitter.

107
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,121
Not the old lady next door.

108
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,998
Thanks.

109
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:00,420
Matthew?

110
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:03,757
-Katie, you back here?
-Yeah.

111
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,342
Come on in, would ya?

112
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:13,976
-Hey, get in the house. No dripping.
-Okay!

113
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:21,900
Sweetie. Please don't
get sick on me, please.

114
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,327
Let's fix dinner.

115
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:36,081
Yes, look.

116
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:43,172
Look at the water.

117
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:54,016
Goddamn it!

118
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,727
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

119
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:02,816
Matthew! Katie! We're going out!

120
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:08,447
You go ahead and order.

121
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:12,367
I'm gonna have a cheeseburger
deluxe with a Coke.

122
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:18,457
Mommy, can I have a cheeseburger
deluxe with no cheese and no bread?

123
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,502
Did you get that?

124
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:27,090
And she will have a cup of chicken
broth and a few crackers, please.

125
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:29,885
-And for you?
-Just a cup of coffee.

126
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:31,929
You're not eating?

127
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,767
My lawyer took me out to a fancy lunch
to celebrate, and I'm still stuffed.

128
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:38,727
How about that?

129
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:22,187
Yes, I'm calling about
the job ad in the paper.

130
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:24,648
I'm calling about the job ad.

131
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:26,942
The great personality, good voice.

132
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:29,695
I don't have any actual
sales experience.

133
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:33,323
I don't really have a resume,
but I can...

134
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,826
I don't have any computer skills.

135
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:40,873
Oh. Well, I thought it was
the local store.

136
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:43,792
Okay. Thanks anyway.

137
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:45,794
Okay, bye.

138
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:53,135
Ed Masry, please.

139
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:55,429
Yes, I'm holding for Ed Masry.

140
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,181
Is he ever in the office?

141
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,850
No, but I've called
about a dozen times.

142
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:01,727
I'd like to leave a message.

143
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:05,606
Brockovich, B-R-O-C-K-O-V-l-C-H.

144
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:09,401
I'm a client. I want him to call.
It's that simple.

145
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:14,990
Okay.

146
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,090
Goddamn it!

147
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:35,135
-Brenda! Brenda!
-Yeah?

148
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,471
Who put that there?

149
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,431
The files you asked for.

150
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:43,101
I didn't ask you to put it
in the middle of the floor.

151
00:12:43,352 --> 00:12:46,104
Get a towel, will you?
Hey, hey...

152
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:50,859
-Hey, what's she doing here?
-Who?

153
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:56,490
Donald.

154
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:00,077
What's she doing here?

155
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:01,745
She works here.

156
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,425
Erin.

157
00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:17,761
How's it going?

158
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,597
You never called me back.
I left messages.

159
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:24,476
You did? I didn't know that.
Donald seems to think...

160
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:30,107
There's two things that aggravate me:
Being ignored and being lied to.

161
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:32,609
-I never lied.
-You said things'd be fine.

162
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,611
They're not. I trusted you.

163
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:36,446
-I'm sorry.
-I don't need pity.

164
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:39,449
I need a paycheck.
And I've looked.

165
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,037
When you spend 6 years raising babies,
it's hard to get a job that pays.

166
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:48,417
Are you getting this down, honey?
Or am I talking too fast for you?

167
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,294
I'm sorry about that.

168
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:52,504
But we have a full staff now...

169
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:57,801
Bullshit. If you had a full staff,
you'd return a client's damn call.

170
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:02,681
I'm smart and hard-working.
I'm not leaving here without a job.

171
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:17,613
Don't make me beg.

172
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,366
If it doesn't work out, fire me.

173
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:24,036
Don't make me beg.

174
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,419
No benefits.

175
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:38,675
What we do in here is file
all of the cases.

176
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:42,471
That way, at any time,
we can tell the status of a file.

177
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:45,182
Where it is in the office and stuff.

178
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:48,894
Here's where we organize
all the files alphabetically.

179
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:50,979
-Simple enough.
-Okay.

180
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:53,106
-And here is your desk.
-Okay.

181
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:55,984
I want to show you where
the Xerox machine is.

182
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:58,403
Everybody has a code.

183
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:01,156
-Do I get to pick my own code?
-We'll see.

184
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:11,959
Can you tell me who I talk to about
getting an advance on my paycheck?

185
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,127
Just for the weekend.

186
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,672
Rosalind's the office manager.

187
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:19,883
She handles the payroll
and petty cash.

188
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:21,301
She's gone already.

189
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:24,555
She leaves early on Fridays.

190
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:30,936
-Okay, thank you.
-Oh, for Pete's sake, here.

191
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,525
I've only got hundreds.

192
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:43,991
I don't want your money, Mr. Masry.

193
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:47,911
Where do you think
your paycheck comes from?

194
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:50,622
-Have a good weekend.
-Thank you.

195
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:53,333
-See you.
-All right, see you.

196
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:56,295
See you Monday.

197
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:11,351
Hi, my sweetie. Hello.

198
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:12,644
How are you?

199
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:14,354
Matthew, Katie.

200
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:16,690
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, sweetie.

201
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:19,651
How are you?

202
00:16:19,902 --> 00:16:22,321
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.

203
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:57,773
Hey!

204
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,527
Hey!

205
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:07,950
Hello.

206
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:11,954
What are you doing
making all that goddamn noise?

207
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,749
Introducing ourselves
to the neighbourhood, I guess.

208
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,044
Well, I am the neighbours. There.

209
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:21,296
We're introduced.
So shut up.

210
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:27,594
Wait. Hold on there.
Let's start over, okay?

211
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,513
My name's George.
What's yours?

212
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:34,268
Just think of me as the person
next door who likes it quiet.

213
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:35,936
Don't be like that.

214
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:38,647
Look, we live next door.
I feel bad.

215
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:41,650
I'm sorry.
Will you accept my apology?

216
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:45,529
We're living right next door.
If you need a cup of a sugar...

217
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:48,031
-I don't need sugar.
-You don't.

218
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:51,160
Why don't I take you
out to dinner to apologize?

219
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:53,912
Give me your number.
I got your address...

220
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,206
...so you can't get away.

221
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,792
I'll call you up proper
and ask you out.

222
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:01,628
You want my number?

223
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:04,006
I do. I do want your number.

224
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:08,385
Which number do you want, George?

225
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:11,513
I like the way you say that.

226
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,348
How many numbers you got?

227
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:17,060
I got numbers coming out
of my ears. For instance, 10.

228
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:18,812
-Ten.
-Yeah.

229
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:21,815
That's how many months old
my baby girl is.

230
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:24,151
-You got a little girl?
-Yeah.

231
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:26,862
Sexy, huh? How about this? Six.

232
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:30,157
That's my other daughter.
Eight is my son.

233
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:33,160
Two is the times
I've been married and divorced.

234
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,579
$16 is what I have
in my bank account.

235
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:38,832
850-3943, that's my phone number.

236
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:43,629
I'm guessing zero is the number
of times you're gonna call it.

237
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:47,257
Hey, how do you remember
your bank balance?

238
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,343
See, that impresses me.

239
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:52,054
You're dead wrong about that zero.

240
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:03,106
How long has she been crying?

241
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:07,110
She's got that tooth coming in.

242
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:11,615
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on.
I'll check back later.

243
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:12,699
Where's Anna?

244
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:15,619
She's out to lunch with the girls.

245
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:20,624
I have to open a file.

246
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,086
Real-estate thing, pro bono.

247
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:26,296
-Okay.
-Know how to do that?

248
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:29,007
Yeah, I got it. No problem.

249
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:33,595
You're a girl.

250
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:36,682
Excuse me?

251
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:40,519
Why aren't you out to lunch
with the girls? You're a girl.

252
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:44,606
I guess I'm not the right kind.

253
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,033
Look, you may want to...
Now that you're working here...

254
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:59,204
You may want to rethink
your wardrobe a little.

255
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:01,748
Why is that?

256
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:07,337
Well, I think some of the girls
are a little uncomfortable...

257
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,965
...because of what you wear.

258
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:13,594
Is that so?

259
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:18,015
Well, it just so happens,
I think I look nice.

260
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:21,560
As long as I have one ass
instead of two, I'll wear what I like...

261
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,520
...if that's all right with you?

262
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:34,448
You might wanna rethink those ties.

263
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:54,092
With real-estate stuff, could you
remind me? I'm a little confused.

264
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:58,889
Why are there medical records
and blood samples in real-estate files?

265
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:00,724
You've been here long enough.

266
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:05,395
If you don't know how to do your job
by now, I'm not gonna do it for you.

267
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:23,455
Hello?

268
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,961
Hello?

269
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:33,048
Matthew? Katie?

270
00:21:50,732 --> 00:21:53,569
Matthew? Katie?

271
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:00,367
Matthew!

272
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:21,847
What happened?

273
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:24,600
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey. Hungry?

274
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,934
Am l...?

275
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:29,146
They're here?
I went to pick them up.

276
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:33,150
She came by an hour ago. Something
came up, she dropped them off.

277
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:34,776
Something came up?

278
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:36,069
Why didn't she call?

279
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,449
I don't know. She, I was, she...
I don't know why.

280
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,452
-That stupid bitch.
-Mom!

281
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:47,456
I just can't believe she dumps
my kids off when nobody's home.

282
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:49,374
I was home.

283
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,711
We're fine. We cooked
burgers, had some milk.

284
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,422
You want a hot dog? There's one.

285
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:59,092
-Or a cheeseburger?
-But this mustard is slippery.

286
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:03,889
Mom, what do you think
about me getting a tattoo?

287
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:06,058
One, two, three.

288
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:13,565
I got all these kings.
You win, you got a joker.

289
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:15,526
King.

290
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:17,194
Joker.

291
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:20,447
You stole a joker!

292
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:21,740
You cheat.

293
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:23,367
What do you mean?

294
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:28,247
You cheat!
Get another one.

295
00:23:28,497 --> 00:23:30,249
Time to go to bed.

296
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,669
Get ready for bed.
Brush your teeth.

297
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:37,130
-Play tomorrow?
-Yeah.

298
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:42,553
Good night, buddy.

299
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:44,221
What's that?

300
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:47,641
This is a Harley-Davidson,
the best motorcycle ever.

301
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:51,770
And if I ever catch either one of you
near one, knock you silly.

302
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:59,695
Brush. And keep it down,
the baby's asleep.

303
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:02,364
You got great kids.

304
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:06,368
Well, I'm sure
I'll fuck 'em up eventually.

305
00:24:07,828 --> 00:24:09,037
Why?

306
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:13,834
I'm not a good judge of character,
or I wouldn't have left them...

307
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:17,921
...with that idiot, who cost a lot
and smelled like chicken fat.

308
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:20,507
And after I find her and kill her...

309
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:23,218
...I don't know what I'm gonna do.

310
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,929
If you need help with them,
I could do that.

311
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:30,100
-I'm not leaving my kids with you.
-Why?

312
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:34,062
-I don't even know you.
-What do you wanna know?

313
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:37,191
-Thanks for today...
-You're welcome.

314
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:39,067
It was my pleasure.

315
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,321
How many decks did you have?

316
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:44,907
We had more than enough.

317
00:24:45,157 --> 00:24:47,493
Got so many friends
you can't use one more?

318
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,624
If you need someone to look after your
kids after school, or whatever...

319
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:55,792
...I don't have a job now.

320
00:24:57,044 --> 00:25:00,756
Oh, that's a great recommendation:
"I'm unemployed."

321
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:02,049
By choice.

322
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,051
I work when I need to.

323
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,763
What do you do?
Live off your trust fund?

324
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:12,476
I do construction, which pays good,
and I make it last by living cheap.

325
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:14,394
Is that supposed to impress me?

326
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,230
Hey. Bed.

327
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,482
Your little ghosts.

328
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:23,278
You always this hard on people
who try to help you?

329
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,197
I'm out of practice.

330
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:28,158
Well, let me remind you then.

331
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:32,246
The polite thing is to say thank you.
I'd start it off with that.

332
00:25:32,454 --> 00:25:35,415
Then, " Hey, that's
a really nice offer.

333
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,085
I don't mind taking you up on that."

334
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:40,420
Why do you want to watch my kids?

335
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:41,839
-I like kids.
-Right.

336
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:44,842
I like hanging out with them.
They keep it simple.

337
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,179
You're home every afternoon?

338
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,473
I'm usually working on my bike.

339
00:25:55,143 --> 00:26:00,148
If it doesn't work out, you can always
send them back to the chicken-fat lady.

340
00:26:06,613 --> 00:26:08,365
This isn't gonna get you laid.

341
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:11,869
Get in bed.

342
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,205
Good, because I don't
find you attractive either.

343
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:16,874
Then we're even.

344
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:19,835
I'm so glad we got that
out of the way.

345
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:21,211
I feel much better.

346
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:24,798
I do too. Because now I can
just look after the kids...

347
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:28,010
...and I don't have to worry
about you coming on to me.

348
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:30,280
Bring the phone into the changing room.
Of course they won't.

349
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:35,077
Mrs. Masry, don't be such a tease.
Hold on, just hold on. Yeah?

350
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:38,038
Sorry, would you mind
if I investigate this?

351
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:39,540
Investigate what?

352
00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:42,918
This real-estate thing
with the Jensens. The pro bono.

353
00:27:45,003 --> 00:27:47,589
I wanna make sure I understand
what I'm reading.

354
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,134
-Yeah, yeah, sure.
-You don't mind?

355
00:27:51,343 --> 00:27:53,846
Okay, great. Thanks.

356
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:04,917
Donna Jensen?

357
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:08,962
I'm Erin Brockovich,
with Masry and Vititoe.

358
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:11,632
Oh! You're a lawyer?

359
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:15,219
Hell, no. I hate lawyers.
I just work for 'em.

360
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:16,970
Do you have a minute?

361
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:21,850
I don't mean to be a pain to PG&E
after all they've done for Hinkley...

362
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:28,148
...but if they want this place,
they're gonna have to pay for it.

363
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:32,319
You didn't put the house up for sale.
They just wanted to buy it?

364
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:34,404
Oh, yeah, yeah.

365
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:37,825
Oh, I don't wanna move.
Uproot the kids?

366
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:40,160
I've got a couple of girls.

367
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,580
Honest to God, I don't know
if I have the energy.

368
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:47,835
You know, I've been sick.
Me and Pete both have.

369
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:52,631
The idea of selling, if they're
not gonna pay us properly...

370
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,341
...I don't see the point.

371
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:58,136
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

372
00:29:59,137 --> 00:30:01,306
I guess the only thing
that confused me...

373
00:30:01,557 --> 00:30:05,769
Not that your medical problems
aren't important.

374
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:09,439
How come those files are in
with all the real-estate stuff?

375
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:14,528
There's just so much correspondence,
I just keep it all in one place.

376
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:24,288
I'm sorry, I just don't see why you're
corresponding with PG&E...

377
00:30:24,496 --> 00:30:27,374
...about your medical problems
in the first place.

378
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:30,544
Well, they paid
for the doctor's visit.

379
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:32,337
They did?

380
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:36,008
You bet. Paid for a checkup
for the whole family.

381
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:41,346
Not like with insurance, where you pay
and maybe you see some money in a year.

382
00:30:41,597 --> 00:30:44,224
They just took care of it.
Just like that.

383
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:45,809
We never saw a bill.

384
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,895
Wow. Why'd they do that?

385
00:30:48,478 --> 00:30:49,730
The chromium.

386
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:52,024
-The what?
-The chromium.

387
00:30:52,316 --> 00:30:55,485
Well, that's what
kicked this whole thing off.

388
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:38,445
-What kind of chromium?
-There's more than one?

389
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:42,449
There's straight-up chromium,
it does good things for the body.

390
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:45,244
There's chrom three,
which is fairly benign.

391
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:47,830
There's chrom six,
hexavalent chromium...

392
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,083
...which, depending on the amounts,
can be harmful.

393
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:54,044
Harmful how? What would you get?

394
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:57,631
With repeated exposure
to toxic levels, anything...

395
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:02,344
...from chronic headaches to respiratory
disease, liver failure...

396
00:32:02,594 --> 00:32:06,390
...heart failure, reproductive failure,
bone or organ deterioration.

397
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,892
Plus, of course, any type of cancer.

398
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:12,020
So that stuff, it kills people.

399
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:13,605
Yeah, definitely.

400
00:32:13,856 --> 00:32:15,691
Highly toxic. Highly carcinogenic.

401
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:20,154
It gets into your DNA, so you pass
the trouble to your kids. Very bad.

402
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:22,239
Well, what's it used for?

403
00:32:22,447 --> 00:32:23,699
A rust inhibitor.

404
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:29,079
The utility plants use piston engines
that get hot, they run water through.

405
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:31,248
Chromium's in the water
to prevent corrosion.

406
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:35,627
How do I find out what kind
of chromium they use in Hinkley?

407
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:38,213
-Been to their water board?
-What's that?

408
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:39,548
Every county has one.

409
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:42,467
They keep records of anything
in their jurisdiction.

410
00:32:42,718 --> 00:32:45,804
-You should find something there.
-County water board.

411
00:32:46,054 --> 00:32:49,183
-Alrighty. Well, thanks.
-Good luck.

412
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:52,936
I wouldn't advertise
what you're looking for.

413
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:57,482
Incriminating records have a way of
disappearing when people smell trouble.

414
00:32:58,317 --> 00:33:01,028
I'll remember that. Thanks.

415
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:13,999
This guy's too smart.

416
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:17,711
/t's only a matter of time
until he makes his move.

417
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,631
He positions women employees
in such a way...

418
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:25,385
...that they have no choice
but to respond or lose theirjobs...

419
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:34,186
-That's a heavy door.
-Let me give you a hand.

420
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:38,357
Thank you very much. Aren't you
a gentleman, Mr?

421
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:41,109
-Scott.
-Mr. Scott.

422
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,822
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Erin.

423
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,782
Erin. Erin. Cool.

424
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,701
What can I do for you, Erin?

425
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:54,248
Believe it or not, I'm on the prowl
for some water records.

426
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:56,124
You come to the right place.

427
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,043
I guess I did.

428
00:33:58,627 --> 00:34:02,965
Just tell me what you wanna look at,
and I'd be glad to dig 'em out.

429
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:07,177
I wish I knew. It's for my boss.
He's in this water dispute...

430
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:12,432
...and he wants me to find all kinds
of papers, from all kinds of places.

431
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,898
You know,
it would probably be easiest...

432
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:23,110
...if I squeezed back there
and poked around myself.

433
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,572
-Would that be all right with you?
-Come on back.

434
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:30,367
-I'm gonna need you to sign in here.
-Oh, sure.

435
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:39,042
-"Pattee," is that your middle name?
-No, maiden.

436
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:40,627
Oh, you're married?

437
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,422
Not anymore.

438
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:47,759
-Can I just?
-Yeah.

439
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:49,803
I love your pants.

440
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:53,432
Oh, well, yeah, thanks.

441
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:55,350
Well, this is it.

442
00:34:57,144 --> 00:34:58,312
It's impressive.

443
00:35:00,606 --> 00:35:02,649
I'll call you if I need anything.

444
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:06,987
-All right.
-Okay.

445
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:08,614
-Thank you.
-Okay.

446
00:36:32,698 --> 00:36:33,740
Where's my stuff?

447
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:35,826
Where have you been?

448
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:37,619
Where the fuck is my stuff?

449
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,789
Don't you use language
like that with...

450
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:43,584
Someone took my stuff.

451
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,503
-Nice to see you.
-I had photos of my kids...

452
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:50,257
Toothbrush, toothpaste,
mousse and deodorant.

453
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,676
What's going on?

454
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:57,014
This isn't a job where you
can disappear for days at a time.

455
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:59,808
You don't do the work,
you don't get to stay.

456
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,853
All I've been doing is working.
Ask Mr. Masry.

457
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:06,106
You ask Mr. Masry. He fired you.

458
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:10,903
You said to fire me?

459
00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:13,780
I'll call you back.
You've been gone for a week.

460
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,743
I left a message. I was gonna
write a whole damn report.

461
00:37:17,993 --> 00:37:21,497
That's not how we work. You don't
leave a message and take off.

462
00:37:21,747 --> 00:37:25,083
-Want me to check in every second?
-It's called accountability.

463
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:27,544
I'm not talking to you, bitch!

464
00:37:27,753 --> 00:37:28,754
That's enough!

465
00:37:29,004 --> 00:37:33,425
Look, Erin, this incident aside,
I don't think this is the right...

466
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:35,052
...place for you.

467
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,014
So I'm gonna make a few calls,
find you something else.

468
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:40,140
Don't bother.

469
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,642
I'm trying to help.

470
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:45,395
You're trying not to feel guilty
about firing someone with 3 kids.

471
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:47,981
Fuck if I'm gonna help you do that.

472
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,361
Get back to work!

473
00:38:12,798 --> 00:38:14,675
What the hell are you doing here?

474
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,052
I'm fixing the leak.

475
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:20,514
Damn it, I don't ask you
to do things like that.

476
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,892
Look at this mess that you've made.

477
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:27,187
-I'm not done with that yet.
-Well, get it out.

478
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:30,566
-Relax.
-Shit! Where did it go?

479
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:32,401
Where is it?

480
00:38:32,651 --> 00:38:33,652
Back there.

481
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:34,987
Behind your foot.

482
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:37,322
-Going up your leg now.
-Jesus!

483
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:40,075
Who fucking lives like this, George?

484
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:45,455
Who lets their kids run around in a
place with bugs the size of house cats?

485
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:48,792
All you have to do
is call an exterminator.

486
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:51,545
I can't call an exterminator.

487
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:55,340
I can't afford one.
I can't even afford my phone.

488
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,803
I got fired.

489
00:39:00,345 --> 00:39:01,597
What?

490
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:06,185
What do you mean, you got fired?
You're working so hard.

491
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,270
Doesn't matter.

492
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:14,526
Doesn't make one fucking bit
of difference.

493
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,502
I don't know what happened to me.

494
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:37,257
I mean...

495
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:42,262
God, I was Miss Wichita,
for chrissake.

496
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,599
Did I tell you that?

497
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:53,315
You are living next door to a real,
live fucking beauty queen.

498
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:01,031
I still have my tiara.

499
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:08,705
And I thought it meant I was gonna
do something important with my life.

500
00:40:09,122 --> 00:40:10,958
That it meant I was someone.

501
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,008
You're someone to me.

502
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:33,564
Are you gonna be something else
that I have to survive?

503
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:37,317
Because I'll tell you the truth...

504
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:41,488
...l'm not up to it.

505
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:26,325
I get up in the centre of the stage...

506
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:29,036
...and I have the big
bouquet of flowers.

507
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,872
I had my foot out like this,
and I said:

508
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:35,751
"I will devote my entire reign
as Miss Wichita...

509
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:38,462
...to bringing an end to world hunger.

510
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:41,757
And to the creation
of a peaceful earth...

511
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:44,593
...for every man, woman and child."

512
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:48,805
-How long were you Miss Wichita?
-One year.

513
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,184
By the time I got through
opening new supermarkets...

514
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:55,979
...I only had a few weeks left
to work on hunger...

515
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,232
...and world peace.
-World peace.

516
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,901
I don't know what I was thinking.

517
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:04,071
What about you, huh?

518
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:05,948
What about me?

519
00:42:12,371 --> 00:42:14,289
Let me tell you something.

520
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,792
Let me get that out of your hair.

521
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:20,754
-Thank you.
-Nice.

522
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,304
You're a very special lady.

523
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:37,271
Don't be too nice to me, okay?

524
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,897
Why?

525
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:41,608
Makes me nervous.

526
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:57,040
It's some slim pickings here, baby.

527
00:43:00,252 --> 00:43:03,547
Maybe that's Ed McMahon.
Let's go see.

528
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:11,305
Wrong Ed.

529
00:43:12,347 --> 00:43:13,849
What are you doing here?

530
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:17,769
I had an interesting call
this afternoon from Dr. Frankel...

531
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:20,105
...from UCLA.
-Oh, yeah?

532
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:24,693
He wanted you to know that the " legal
limit for hexavalent chromium...

533
00:43:25,194 --> 00:43:29,406
...is.05 parts per million...

534
00:43:29,656 --> 00:43:33,243
...and at the rate you mentioned,
.58, it could be...

535
00:43:33,494 --> 00:43:38,040
...responsible for the cancers"
in that family you asked about...

536
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,000
...the Jensens.

537
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,170
Well. Wasn't that nice of him?

538
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,508
Funny how some people help people,
and others just fire them.

539
00:43:47,883 --> 00:43:51,678
I'm sorry. You were gone.
I assumed you were off having fun.

540
00:43:52,888 --> 00:43:55,599
Why the hell would you assume that?

541
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:58,936
Maybe you look like someone
who has a lot of fun.

542
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:01,980
By that standard,
I assume you never get laid.

543
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:05,442
I'm married.

544
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:12,074
Look, what is this... What's the story
on this cancer stuff?

545
00:44:15,536 --> 00:44:19,414
You wanna know, you have to hire me
back. I got a ton of bills to pay.

546
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,334
Fine.

547
00:44:23,085 --> 00:44:24,127
Fine.

548
00:44:24,837 --> 00:44:28,590
Donna just put in these new cabinets,
stained the wood and all...

549
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:32,553
...when she gets a call from PG&E,
saying a freeway's gonna be built...

550
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:35,681
...and they wanna buy her house
for an off-ramp.

551
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:38,392
The husband's sick with Hodgkin's.

552
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,143
She keeps getting tumours...

553
00:44:40,352 --> 00:44:43,230
...believing one has nothing
to do with the other.

554
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,732
Because PG&E told her
about the chromium?

555
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,693
They had a seminar.

556
00:44:47,943 --> 00:44:50,279
They invited 200 people
from the area...

557
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:52,281
...had it at the plant...

558
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:55,409
...about chromium three
and how good it is...

559
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,828
...when they're using chromium six.

560
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:03,041
That document you found
at the water board...

561
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:07,254
...the one that says
about the bad chromium...

562
00:45:08,255 --> 00:45:10,883
You didn't happen to make a copy,
did you?

563
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:12,634
Of course I did.

564
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,803
Could I have a look?

565
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:16,889
I want a raise.

566
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:21,059
And benefits, including dental.

567
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:23,937
It's not how I do business.

568
00:45:24,146 --> 00:45:25,772
-What way is that?
-Extortion.

569
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:36,158
A 5% raise, we'll talk
about benefits later.

570
00:45:36,658 --> 00:45:41,413
Ten. There are lots of other places
I could get work.

571
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:46,960
10% raise and benefits, but that's it.
I'm drawing the line.

572
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:49,963
He's drawing the line.

573
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,100
This the only thing you got?

574
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:05,395
Well, the place is a pigsty.
There's probably more.

575
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:07,898
I know how those things are run.

576
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:12,236
What makes you think
you can just walk in there...

577
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:15,405
...and find what we need?

578
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:18,367
They're called boobs, Ed.

579
00:46:34,716 --> 00:46:36,844
Yes, I'm sure it is.

580
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,304
I understand.

581
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,558
I agree. I agree. I'm going to.

582
00:46:42,808 --> 00:46:43,934
Right now.

583
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:53,277
I'm almost done. Look.

584
00:46:54,194 --> 00:46:55,821
How are we doing?

585
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:57,698
We're doing great.

586
00:46:59,658 --> 00:47:01,076
Good.

587
00:47:01,326 --> 00:47:05,205
Well, you've got quite a lot
done already. So...

588
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,835
Sorry, we need to have
those records back now.

589
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,461
No.

590
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,551
These papers are public record.
I'm not leaving...

591
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,263
...until they're copied.

592
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:37,321
Fax these to this number, okay?

593
00:47:37,613 --> 00:47:39,823
-All of them?
-All of them.

594
00:48:01,303 --> 00:48:03,388
An on-site monitoring well?

595
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:06,683
-That means it was...
-It's on the PG&E property.

596
00:48:07,643 --> 00:48:12,773
And you say that this stuff,
this hexavalent chromium...

597
00:48:13,816 --> 00:48:16,318
-Well, it's poisonous.
-Yeah.

598
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:28,705
It's gotta be different than what's
in our water, because ours is okay.

599
00:48:28,914 --> 00:48:31,750
The guys from PG&E told me.

600
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:35,712
They sat right in the kitchen
and told me that it was fine.

601
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:41,134
I know. But the toxicologist
that I've been talking to...

602
00:48:41,343 --> 00:48:46,139
...he gave me a list of problems that
come from hexavalent chromium exposure.

603
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,685
Everything you all have
is on that list.

604
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,396
No, no, no.

605
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:59,069
That's not what...
That's not what our doctor said.

606
00:48:59,278 --> 00:49:00,946
He said that...

607
00:49:02,197 --> 00:49:05,742
Well, that one's got absolutely
nothing to do with the other.

608
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:09,913
But PG&E paid for that doctor.

609
00:49:31,226 --> 00:49:32,436
Ashley!

610
00:49:33,353 --> 00:49:35,189
Shanna!
Get out of the pool!

611
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,983
-How come?
-I said so, that's why.

612
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:46,867
The minute Brenda sent that fax...

613
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:51,205
...l'm saying, the second she
pressed the "send" button...

614
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:56,835
...PG&E's claim department
was on the phone to me...

615
00:49:57,085 --> 00:49:58,837
...scheduling a meeting.

616
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:01,340
So you think that...
Let me do it.

617
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:03,300
You're driving me nuts.

618
00:50:03,509 --> 00:50:05,093
You think we scared them?

619
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:07,679
Taking the trouble to send someone...

620
00:50:07,888 --> 00:50:11,350
...sounds like they're
sitting up and taking notice.

621
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:28,033
Mr. Foil?

622
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:32,538
In the interest
of putting this to rest...

623
00:50:32,746 --> 00:50:37,209
...PG&E is willing to offer
the Jensens $250,000 for their home.

624
00:50:37,793 --> 00:50:39,294
$250,000?

625
00:50:40,462 --> 00:50:42,923
In terms of land value in Hinkley...

626
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:45,884
...we feel that's a more
than fair price.

627
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,762
How about in terms
of medical expenses?

628
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:53,600
$250,000 isn't gonna come close to what
this family's gonna spend on doctors.

629
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:58,188
I understand they've had bad luck,
health-wise.

630
00:50:58,438 --> 00:51:00,149
They have my sympathies.

631
00:51:00,399 --> 00:51:01,900
But that's not PG&E's fault.

632
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:03,902
You're kidding, right?

633
00:51:05,654 --> 00:51:07,531
Look at these readings.

634
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:11,618
PG&E's own technicians documented...

635
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,872
...toxic levels of hexavalent chromium
in those wells...

636
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:17,332
...on numerous occasions.

637
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,751
Everything the Jensens have had...

638
00:51:20,002 --> 00:51:25,048
...is proven reaction to exposure to
hexavalent chromium. They have had...

639
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:27,551
They have had...

640
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:34,850
Breast cysts, uterine cancer,
Hodgkin's, immune deficiencies...

641
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,351
...asthma, nosebleeds...

642
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:39,062
A million things could
cause those problems.

643
00:51:39,313 --> 00:51:43,650
Poor diet, bad genes,
irresponsible lifestyle.

644
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:46,028
Our offer is final
and more than fair.

645
00:51:46,278 --> 00:51:49,448
Wait a minute.
I thought we were negotiating here.

646
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:56,622
$250,000 is all
I'm authorized to offer.

647
00:51:58,665 --> 00:52:01,543
I'll present your offer to my clients.

648
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:03,837
I doubt they'll accept.

649
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:07,549
Before you go off on a crusade...

650
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:10,135
...remember who you're dealing with.

651
00:52:10,385 --> 00:52:14,056
PG&E's a 28 billion
dollar corporation.

652
00:52:14,515 --> 00:52:17,434
28 billion dollars?

653
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:19,895
I didn't know it was that much!

654
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:24,399
Wow! Twenty-eight billion!

655
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,777
Holy cow!

656
00:52:27,152 --> 00:52:28,237
They made an offer.

657
00:52:28,487 --> 00:52:32,199
No, a million would have been
an offer. They send that...

658
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:35,661
...mail clerk down to jerk me off,
waste my time.

659
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:36,703
Why?

660
00:52:37,246 --> 00:52:39,081
You heard what that kid said.

661
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:43,710
They have 28 billion dollars.
They can afford to waste time.

662
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:45,671
-You can't?
-Am I made of money?

663
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:48,173
-Why are you yelling?
-I'm pissed.

664
00:52:50,425 --> 00:52:52,386
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you back!

665
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,481
I really hate you sometimes.

666
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,234
No. You love me.

667
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:21,415
You've been reading for hours.

668
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,500
I'm a slow reader.

669
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,449
Excuse me.

670
00:53:55,657 --> 00:53:57,409
-Are you Erin Brockovich?
-Yeah.

671
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,037
I'm Tom Robinson.

672
00:54:00,245 --> 00:54:02,080
This is my wife, Mandy.

673
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:05,292
We used to live across
the street from the Jensens.

674
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:07,753
I think you know Donna.

675
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:12,090
PG&E bought our house last year.

676
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:17,554
Well, the vet said they had
a bunch of tumours and stuff.

677
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,433
Well, you can see
they couldn't really walk.

678
00:54:21,934 --> 00:54:23,811
How many were born like this?

679
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,773
Twelve or 13 or so.

680
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:32,110
When Donna told us what
you told her about the chromium...

681
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,489
...we figured it might have
something to do with this.

682
00:54:35,697 --> 00:54:37,407
Yeah, it might.

683
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:39,201
Really, may I keep these?

684
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,661
-Yeah.
-Okay, great.

685
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:44,039
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

686
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,917
There's something else too.

687
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:50,087
What?

688
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:57,469
Mandy, here, has had...

689
00:54:57,678 --> 00:55:00,305
...five miscarriages.

690
00:55:00,806 --> 00:55:01,932
I'm so sorry.

691
00:55:03,183 --> 00:55:05,519
I figured it was something I did.

692
00:55:06,395 --> 00:55:09,022
Like, when I smoked marijuana,
maybe...

693
00:55:09,231 --> 00:55:11,650
...or took birth control pills...

694
00:55:11,859 --> 00:55:14,319
...but then Donna
said that you thought...

695
00:55:14,528 --> 00:55:17,698
...this chromium might be
to blame for her problems.

696
00:55:17,906 --> 00:55:19,908
So I figured maybe...

697
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,538
...it wasn't just me.

698
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,682
I have to take a bath.

699
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:45,767
You should go in.

700
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:49,521
They're not asleep?

701
00:55:53,025 --> 00:55:54,735
Beth and Katie are.

702
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:14,129
-How was school?
-Fine.

703
00:56:14,796 --> 00:56:16,924
-Did you do your homework?
-Yeah.

704
00:56:19,635 --> 00:56:21,428
Any problems?

705
00:56:32,314 --> 00:56:35,984
I know you're upset,
but the way this job is...

706
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:40,280
...things come up at the last minute.
Things that I gotta deal with.

707
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:42,574
Fine!

708
00:56:48,413 --> 00:56:50,415
Please don't be mad at me.

709
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:55,003
I'm doing this for us. I know
it's hard for you to understand...

710
00:56:58,257 --> 00:57:01,009
...but don't you want Mommy
to be good at her job?

711
00:57:08,016 --> 00:57:11,895
I don't miss dinner all the time.
We all ate together last night.

712
00:57:12,104 --> 00:57:14,064
You were reading the whole time.

713
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:42,593
There's something about this thing
I don't understand, Mr. Masry.

714
00:57:43,051 --> 00:57:45,762
If PG&E messed with our water...

715
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:48,891
...why would they say anything
about it to us at all?

716
00:57:49,224 --> 00:57:51,018
Why not just keep quiet about it?

717
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:53,353
To establish a statute of limitations.

718
00:57:53,562 --> 00:57:56,356
In a case like this,
you only have one year...

719
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:59,735
...from the time you learn about
the problem to file suit.

720
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,196
So PG&E figures...

721
00:58:02,404 --> 00:58:06,408
..."We'll let the cat out of the bag.
Tell them the water isn't perfect.

722
00:58:06,825 --> 00:58:09,661
If we can ride out the year
with no one suing...

723
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,747
...we'll be in the clear forever."

724
00:58:12,414 --> 00:58:14,625
But they told us more than a year ago.

725
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:17,377
-That's okay. We're not suing.
-Not yet.

726
00:58:17,878 --> 00:58:20,714
All we're doing
is using this information...

727
00:58:20,923 --> 00:58:23,675
...to get you a nice purchase
price on your house.

728
00:58:23,884 --> 00:58:28,472
And you two, a comparable
retroactive bonus on your sale price.

729
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,350
PG&E still looks good
to their shareholders.

730
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:33,310
They're not in a lawsuit.

731
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:35,938
All they're doing is buying property.

732
00:58:38,065 --> 00:58:40,901
Doesn't say how much
this thing's gonna cost us.

733
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:45,030
My fee is 40% of whatever
you get awarded.

734
00:58:54,957 --> 00:58:57,209
Boy, do I know how you feel.

735
00:58:57,417 --> 00:59:01,171
The first time I heard that number,
I said, "You're kidding me."

736
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,298
Forty goddamned percent?

737
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:07,386
I'm the one that's injured, and
this joker sits at a desk all day...

738
00:59:07,594 --> 00:59:10,013
...and he wants
almost half of my reward?

739
00:59:10,222 --> 00:59:12,182
-Erin, can l...?
-But then...

740
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:14,893
...I asked him...

741
00:59:15,102 --> 00:59:17,646
...what he makes
if I don't get anything.

742
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,150
Then I don't get anything either.

743
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:23,569
Plus, he's out all the costs.

744
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:26,196
So I realized...

745
00:59:26,446 --> 00:59:28,073
...he's taking a chance too.

746
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:38,917
You got a pen, honey?

747
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:45,841
All right, then.

748
00:59:49,011 --> 00:59:51,013
Oh, I made a bundt cake.

749
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:53,599
Who would like coffee and cake?

750
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:56,059
-I do.
-Thanks, but we have to get back.

751
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:00,189
Have a fucking cup of coffee, Ed.

752
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:02,316
Coffee will be great. Thank you.

753
01:00:02,774 --> 01:00:04,985
-All right.
-I'll help you.

754
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,284
My wife makes really good bundt cake.

755
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:14,369
I love bundt cake.

756
01:00:17,331 --> 01:00:21,793
Well, it seems like everybody in
the family ended up with a rash somehow.

757
01:00:22,503 --> 01:00:26,006
It seemed like no matter what
we did, it always came back.

758
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:28,926
Over what kind of period of time?

759
01:00:29,134 --> 01:00:33,138
Oh, long time, you know, years.
I never did keep track of it.

760
01:00:33,347 --> 01:00:36,475
Kids are sick.
Animals need to be fed.

761
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,352
Just couldn't get rid of it.

762
01:00:39,978 --> 01:00:41,980
Well, Mrs. De Soto said...

763
01:00:42,397 --> 01:00:45,317
...that she wasn't
exactly sure what you had.

764
01:00:45,526 --> 01:00:46,777
We know what it is.

765
01:00:46,985 --> 01:00:50,239
-It's gastrointestinal...
-Gastrointestinal cancer.

766
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:53,659
-She got sick about nine months ago...
-Nine months ago.

767
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:56,745
And they operated on her
about six months ago.

768
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:58,455
-The intestine.
-Right.

769
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,927
-Hi. I'm Erin Brock...
-I know who you are.

770
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,804
Donna called me.

771
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:16,515
Can I come in?

772
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:19,685
We're not interested
in getting involved.

773
01:01:21,937 --> 01:01:23,605
Can I ask why?

774
01:01:24,189 --> 01:01:25,899
What's the point?

775
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:31,822
Donna told me that you've been sick
and that your kids were sick...

776
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,658
You people don't give a shit.

777
01:01:35,117 --> 01:01:37,786
Anything to get what you want.

778
01:01:45,878 --> 01:01:47,254
Thanks for having me...

779
01:01:47,462 --> 01:01:50,299
It's a good day to come by.
She's feeling good.

780
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:52,885
Well, Mike Ambrosino had remembered...

781
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:55,804
...that he had seen
you folks at the hospital.

782
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:57,848
That's what brought me out here.

783
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:03,020
Yeah, we've been there
from time to time.

784
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,106
And you! Wooftie!

785
01:02:06,315 --> 01:02:07,399
Ain't you a beauty?

786
01:02:08,108 --> 01:02:10,194
You drive all the boys
crazy, don't you?

787
01:02:10,402 --> 01:02:13,447
I can see it in your eyes.
You drive them wild.

788
01:02:13,822 --> 01:02:15,324
You do, don't you?

789
01:02:15,824 --> 01:02:16,992
Torture them.

790
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:18,660
It's good for them.

791
01:02:20,787 --> 01:02:23,040
Don't teach her anything too early.

792
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:26,793
Yeah, she can't wait
to get on her new dress.

793
01:02:27,002 --> 01:02:28,504
She wants to go to school.

794
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:31,256
We're trying to do that,
in a few months.

795
01:02:31,465 --> 01:02:34,134
Yeah, get her out
of her nightgown here.

796
01:02:37,304 --> 01:02:39,097
She's gonna do it.

797
01:02:57,115 --> 01:02:58,367
Absolutely not.

798
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:00,661
-Why not?
-Because I said no.

799
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:02,955
The reason PG&E even talks to us...

800
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:05,999
...is because this is a quiet
real-estate dispute.

801
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:09,837
We add plaintiffs, we're in
the middle of a toxic-trot...

802
01:03:10,045 --> 01:03:12,923
...with a statute problem,
against a massive utility.

803
01:03:13,131 --> 01:03:13,966
No, thank you.

804
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:15,884
Okay, so here's what I'll do.

805
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:19,847
I'll go to the Daniels',
the nicest people you'll ever meet...

806
01:03:20,055 --> 01:03:23,183
...who watch their girl fight
like a dog against cancer.

807
01:03:23,392 --> 01:03:24,434
I'll tell them...

808
01:03:24,643 --> 01:03:28,480
...we can't help them, because you
just don't wanna work that hard.

809
01:03:28,897 --> 01:03:30,190
Work hard?

810
01:03:30,399 --> 01:03:32,317
Let me tell you something.

811
01:03:32,526 --> 01:03:34,027
I've worked all my life.

812
01:03:34,236 --> 01:03:38,532
I've built a firm and kept it alive
through lawsuits and injunctions.

813
01:03:38,824 --> 01:03:41,827
I've survived
a quadruple bypass, cancer...

814
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:44,496
...being born with one
kidney and diabetes.

815
01:03:44,705 --> 01:03:47,499
I personally managed
to save a million dollars...

816
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:50,377
...over 30 years, getting
clients 10 times that.

817
01:03:50,586 --> 01:03:52,796
Don't tell me I don't work hard!

818
01:03:53,005 --> 01:03:56,550
Don't tell me I can't stop,
take a breath and enjoy life.

819
01:03:56,758 --> 01:03:59,261
What the hell do you know
about any of this?

820
01:03:59,678 --> 01:04:02,681
Something like this, Erin,
it could take forever.

821
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:04,600
They're a huge corporation!

822
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:06,977
They'll bury us
in paperwork for years.

823
01:04:07,186 --> 01:04:09,646
I'm just a guy with
a small, private firm!

824
01:04:10,856 --> 01:04:13,942
Who knows they poisoned
people and lied about it.

825
01:04:14,693 --> 01:04:16,153
We can get these people.

826
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:20,199
With a little effort, I think we
can nail their asses to the wall.

827
01:04:20,407 --> 01:04:22,826
With your legal expertise,
you believe that?

828
01:04:23,035 --> 01:04:25,746
-Don't you ever just know?
-Do you know about money?

829
01:04:25,954 --> 01:04:27,623
They settle due to lack of money.

830
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:31,126
You know what toxicologists
and geology experts cost?

831
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:33,212
We're looking at $100,000 a month.

832
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:36,632
-I've already spent some of my savings.
-We'll figure it out.

833
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,802
I don't know shit, but I know the
difference between right and wrong!

834
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:43,889
-Lovers' quarrel?
-Bite my ass, Krispy Kreme.

835
01:04:48,477 --> 01:04:50,145
I feel you looking at me.

836
01:04:53,816 --> 01:04:55,901
I'm sorry.

837
01:04:57,986 --> 01:05:00,489
How many families are we talking about?

838
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:03,283
Four more. Eleven people so far.

839
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:04,451
There's more?

840
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:10,040
I found a document at the water board,
a toxic test well reading from 1967.

841
01:05:10,374 --> 01:05:12,835
More people have lived
there since then.

842
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,548
This is a whole different ball game.
A much bigger deal.

843
01:05:18,507 --> 01:05:21,260
Kind of like David
and what's-his-name.

844
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:27,057
Kind of like David and what's-
his-name's whole fucking family.

845
01:05:28,725 --> 01:05:30,602
Here's the deal.

846
01:05:30,811 --> 01:05:35,732
Lf, and only if, you find all the
evidence to back this up, I'll do it.

847
01:05:35,983 --> 01:05:37,568
You're doing the right thing.

848
01:05:37,776 --> 01:05:41,989
Remind me of that when
I'm filing for bankruptcy.

849
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,661
Of course, gathering
evidence is a big job.

850
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:50,164
Hell of a lot bigger than just filing.

851
01:05:50,372 --> 01:05:52,082
I'll be working a lot harder...

852
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:55,210
...taking on a lot
more responsibility.

853
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:57,880
-I don't believe this.
-A raise wouldn't hurt.

854
01:05:58,088 --> 01:05:59,798
I'll spend more time in my car...

855
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:03,385
...so I'll probably be needing
one of those cell phones.

856
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:07,222
-I don't believe this.
-Just a little phone.

857
01:07:15,582 --> 01:07:17,084
Thank you!

858
01:07:24,258 --> 01:07:26,718
Whoever is behind you.

859
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:28,846
Just play.

860
01:07:29,054 --> 01:07:32,516
Go, roll the dice and play.

861
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,770
Come on, aren't you gonna play?

862
01:07:36,979 --> 01:07:39,148
Roll the dice.

863
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:40,816
Come on.

864
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:45,279
Hello.

865
01:07:45,487 --> 01:07:50,033
/s this the Erin Brockovich that's
been snooping around the water board?

866
01:07:50,242 --> 01:07:51,577
Yeah. Who's this?

867
01:07:51,785 --> 01:07:53,245
You should watch your step.

868
01:07:53,453 --> 01:07:57,457
A young lady with three young
children really should think again.

869
01:07:57,666 --> 01:07:58,584
Who is this?

870
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,337
Do you understand what /'m saying?

871
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,803
Who is it?

872
01:08:11,513 --> 01:08:13,015
/t's okay.

873
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:19,188
I'm not gonna quit because of
one creepy phone call, George.

874
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:20,898
Come on, Erin.

875
01:08:22,024 --> 01:08:23,775
A job shouldn't put you in danger.

876
01:08:23,984 --> 01:08:25,110
I'm not in danger.

877
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,779
-The phone might be tapped but...
-What?

878
01:08:27,988 --> 01:08:31,366
That's usual. We've got a dead
bolt, it's not a big deal.

879
01:08:31,992 --> 01:08:35,162
You don't think you're
a little out of your league?

880
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:38,499
That's what those PG&E
fucks want me to think.

881
01:08:38,707 --> 01:08:39,958
But they're wrong.

882
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:42,878
Erin, there are plenty
of jobs out there.

883
01:08:43,086 --> 01:08:44,671
How would you know?

884
01:08:54,139 --> 01:08:55,933
What that's supposed to mean?

885
01:08:56,141 --> 01:08:59,561
You got a problem with me caring
for your kids instead of a job?

886
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:00,938
I can get a job.

887
01:09:01,146 --> 01:09:04,233
You can leave the kids with
the chicken-fat lady again.

888
01:09:04,441 --> 01:09:06,777
I said I'm sorry.
Keep your voice down.

889
01:09:06,985 --> 01:09:10,531
I know what these kids can
sleep through, better than you.

890
01:09:24,545 --> 01:09:26,588
Scott, tell me something.

891
01:09:26,797 --> 01:09:29,132
Does PG&E pay you
to cover their ass?

892
01:09:29,341 --> 01:09:32,427
Or do you just do it out
of the kindness of your heart?

893
01:09:32,886 --> 01:09:35,430
I don't know what
you're talking about.

894
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:37,391
Nobody calls me Pattee.

895
01:09:37,599 --> 01:09:42,020
That sicko that called could've
only found out about me from you.

896
01:09:42,813 --> 01:09:44,398
People are dying, Scott.

897
01:09:44,606 --> 01:09:46,692
You've got document after document...

898
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:50,779
...that says why, and you
haven't said one word about it.

899
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:55,117
I wanna know how the hell
you sleep at night.

900
01:10:15,429 --> 01:10:19,558
I'm about to drive off the road,
I'm so tired. Keep me awake.

901
01:10:21,101 --> 01:10:22,478
What do you want, a joke?

902
01:10:23,312 --> 01:10:26,023
No, I don't want a joke.

903
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:28,859
Tell me about what went on back there.

904
01:10:30,611 --> 01:10:33,739
Come to think of it,
we had a big event around here.

905
01:10:35,782 --> 01:10:38,827
Beth started talking.

906
01:10:41,246 --> 01:10:42,289
What?

907
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:46,001
Beth? My Beth?

908
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,544
We were sitting around...

909
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:51,256
...and she pointed
at a ball and said:

910
01:10:51,965 --> 01:10:53,133
"Ball."

911
01:10:54,259 --> 01:10:55,802
Out of the blue like that.

912
01:10:58,639 --> 01:11:00,307
/t was pretty intense.

913
01:11:00,516 --> 01:11:02,810
You know, seeing
somebody's first word.

914
01:11:03,018 --> 01:11:07,940
Of all the words in her life,
that's the first word she says: "ball."

915
01:11:10,526 --> 01:11:12,736
She pointed her little finger...

916
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:16,490
...with her beautiful, soft,
chubby little arm...

917
01:11:17,241 --> 01:11:18,450
...and her cheeks.

918
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:21,537
/t's like she'd been
looking at it for months...

919
01:11:21,745 --> 01:11:24,832
...and couldn't get it out,
but knowing what it was.

920
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,167
She didn't look away or anything.

921
01:11:27,376 --> 01:11:29,920
She was just sitting
there with her arm out.

922
01:11:30,128 --> 01:11:32,923
You should've seen
Matthew and Katie and me.

923
01:11:33,131 --> 01:11:34,675
Ourjaws just dropped.

924
01:11:34,883 --> 01:11:39,054
We must've stood there for three or
four minutes andjust looked at her.

925
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,432
She just had her arm out
like that. "Ball."

926
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:45,477
And, you know, her little
lips wrapped around it.

927
01:11:47,396 --> 01:11:48,814
/t was great.

928
01:11:49,022 --> 01:11:50,691
/t was intense.

929
01:11:58,157 --> 01:12:01,076
I brought some stuff that
you might be interested in.

930
01:12:01,285 --> 01:12:04,329
My name's Erin, and
I'll be here all day.

931
01:12:04,538 --> 01:12:06,832
Let's go over to these
nice ladies. Hi.

932
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,417
-How are you?
-Good.

933
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:12,546
I brought some information today,
if you wanna have a look at it.

934
01:12:12,754 --> 01:12:15,174
If you have any
questions, let me know.

935
01:12:15,382 --> 01:12:18,218
Hi. Excuse me, ladies, I'm Ed Masry.

936
01:12:18,427 --> 01:12:22,264
I'm the lawyer involved in the case.
You might like to read these.

937
01:12:22,473 --> 01:12:24,725
If you have questions,
I'm here all day.

938
01:12:24,933 --> 01:12:27,394
-Sounds good. Thank you.
-Thanks so much.

939
01:12:28,437 --> 01:12:29,980
Is your phone number in this?

940
01:12:31,106 --> 01:12:34,067
There's more important
information than that in there.

941
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:36,862
I'm bored.

942
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:38,530
So are the kids.

943
01:12:39,573 --> 01:12:41,200
I'm a little busy, honey.

944
01:12:41,408 --> 01:12:43,702
We invited these people.
Ed and I have to...

945
01:12:43,911 --> 01:12:45,787
I'm sorry. You know what?

946
01:12:46,038 --> 01:12:47,915
Please, I have an idea.

947
01:12:48,123 --> 01:12:49,500
Can you take her?

948
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:53,045
She's getting heavy, and I'll
work faster if you take her.

949
01:13:03,972 --> 01:13:05,265
Got a knee for me?

950
01:13:06,809 --> 01:13:08,977
-Hello.
-Hello, sweetness.

951
01:13:09,186 --> 01:13:10,854
-Guess what?
-What?

952
01:13:11,063 --> 01:13:12,898
I would like to go home.

953
01:13:13,106 --> 01:13:13,982
Everything's done?

954
01:13:14,191 --> 01:13:15,442
We got a lot done.

955
01:13:15,651 --> 01:13:18,278
Did you? I think
I ate three watermelons.

956
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:19,530
Piggyback!

957
01:13:19,738 --> 01:13:21,281
Let's go, brother. Get on.

958
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:22,950
Careful.

959
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:24,618
Here, get on me, now.

960
01:13:24,827 --> 01:13:26,912
Erin, excuse me.

961
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,249
This is Nelson Perez, he works
at the compressor station.

962
01:13:30,457 --> 01:13:32,835
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-PG&E.

963
01:13:33,043 --> 01:13:34,753
Oh, hi.

964
01:13:36,213 --> 01:13:38,131
-I've come at a bad time.
-No.

965
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,426
-Can you just give me one...?
-Of course. Sure.

966
01:13:41,635 --> 01:13:43,303
Thank you.

967
01:13:46,306 --> 01:13:47,307
You know what?

968
01:13:47,516 --> 01:13:51,520
Why don't you guys go ahead without
me, and I'll get a ride with Ed.

969
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:54,857
-No, Mom.
-No, sweetie, I'll be right behind you.

970
01:13:55,065 --> 01:13:57,151
I'll be right behind you, all right?

971
01:13:57,484 --> 01:14:02,281
I really... This is so...
-Fine. Go, go, go.

972
01:14:05,701 --> 01:14:07,286
Get down, bud.

973
01:14:11,415 --> 01:14:12,791
Hang on tight there.

974
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,419
Help your sister
with her shoes. Let's go.

975
01:14:32,394 --> 01:14:35,647
This is so helpful.
Is it okay if I write this down?

976
01:14:35,856 --> 01:14:37,274
I have so many questions.

977
01:14:37,483 --> 01:14:40,944
I wanna know about how the plant works
and the cooling towers, just everything.

978
01:14:40,944 --> 01:14:42,070
I wanna know about how the plant works
and the cooling towers, just everything.

979
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:47,409
They use the hexachrome here, in these
cooling towers, as an anticorrosive.

980
01:14:47,659 --> 01:14:50,662
Then they dump the excess
water into these ponds.

981
01:14:51,038 --> 01:14:53,832
I don't remember seeing
any ponds up there.

982
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:57,002
They've been covered over,
and not too carefully.

983
01:14:57,211 --> 01:14:59,755
If you dig one inch
under the surface...

984
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:02,090
...dirt's as green
as a fucking shamrock.

985
01:15:02,299 --> 01:15:04,801
And that's what
caused the contamination?

986
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:08,847
It didn't help, but no.
The problem started on the bottom.

987
01:15:09,139 --> 01:15:11,183
According to...

988
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:14,686
...this...

989
01:15:14,895 --> 01:15:17,523
...in most cases you would
line these ponds...

990
01:15:17,731 --> 01:15:20,025
...so the shit didn't seep
into the ground.

991
01:15:20,651 --> 01:15:24,112
-But guess what?
-They skipped that step?

992
01:15:24,488 --> 01:15:27,199
Here are the ponds,
the plume comes down...

993
01:15:27,407 --> 01:15:29,701
...and Hinkley is down here...

994
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:33,330
...it's 14 years of hexachrome
flowing into the groundwater.

995
01:15:34,122 --> 01:15:35,374
Jesus.

996
01:15:36,416 --> 01:15:38,961
This guy just offered
all this information?

997
01:15:39,503 --> 01:15:42,464
Well, yeah. Nelson cares
what's in those ponds.

998
01:15:42,673 --> 01:15:46,260
He used to spend time wading
around them. That was his job.

999
01:15:46,468 --> 01:15:47,678
Shit.

1000
01:15:55,185 --> 01:15:56,061
What's the matter?

1001
01:15:58,605 --> 01:16:01,024
I don't know if we can pull this off.

1002
01:16:02,151 --> 01:16:06,113
This is a monster case.
We're up to 411 plaintiffs.

1003
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:11,201
We've taken 162 declarations.

1004
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:14,997
Probably hundreds more
out there have moved away.

1005
01:16:15,289 --> 01:16:17,583
We have to find them,
it's taking time.

1006
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,877
Money's going out,
nothing's coming in.

1007
01:16:20,085 --> 01:16:22,087
I have to take a second mortgage.

1008
01:16:22,296 --> 01:16:24,006
-So?
-So!

1009
01:16:27,384 --> 01:16:28,969
I have to tell you.

1010
01:16:29,761 --> 01:16:33,640
I've been making inquiries
with other firms...

1011
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:37,311
...bigger firms to share
some of the cost.

1012
01:16:37,811 --> 01:16:40,230
They all said no,
said they don't have it.

1013
01:16:42,357 --> 01:16:44,067
We got PG&E by the balls.

1014
01:16:44,276 --> 01:16:48,447
PG&E Hinkley, but nobody'll get rich
unless we pin this on Corporate...

1015
01:16:48,655 --> 01:16:50,741
...in San Francisco.
-What do you mean?

1016
01:16:50,949 --> 01:16:54,203
PG&E Corporate claims they
didn't know about Hinkley.

1017
01:16:54,411 --> 01:16:56,455
They knew. They had to know.

1018
01:16:56,663 --> 01:16:58,415
Show me the document to prove it.

1019
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:05,506
Then they didn't know. If so, we
can't hit them with punitive damages.

1020
01:17:05,714 --> 01:17:09,176
With punitive damages,
it's a sum of money that can...

1021
01:17:09,384 --> 01:17:13,388
...have some effect
on these people's lives.

1022
01:17:14,723 --> 01:17:16,099
So what do we do now?

1023
01:17:20,646 --> 01:17:25,234
Let's assume there are documents
connecting PG&E Hinkley and Corporate...

1024
01:17:25,442 --> 01:17:27,110
...and they know about them.

1025
01:17:27,611 --> 01:17:32,157
We take our 400 or so plaintiffs
and everything you've dug up...

1026
01:17:32,449 --> 01:17:34,827
...we file a lawsuit
to provoke a reaction.

1027
01:17:35,035 --> 01:17:39,039
See if they offer a reasonable
settlement, or throw more paper at us.

1028
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,124
Sounds great. Let's do that.

1029
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:42,543
There's a downside.

1030
01:17:43,877 --> 01:17:46,338
PG&E will submit a demurrer.

1031
01:17:46,547 --> 01:17:48,799
A list attacking each complaint...

1032
01:17:49,007 --> 01:17:51,844
...claiming that each cause
of action has no merit.

1033
01:17:52,052 --> 01:17:54,221
And if the judge agrees with them...

1034
01:17:54,429 --> 01:17:57,891
...he'll dismiss our case.
PG&E will have no reason to settle.

1035
01:17:58,725 --> 01:18:00,519
Then it's all over.

1036
01:18:06,567 --> 01:18:08,861
So basically it all comes down to...

1037
01:18:09,069 --> 01:18:12,156
...what this one judge decides.

1038
01:18:13,323 --> 01:18:14,908
Basically, yeah.

1039
01:18:16,118 --> 01:18:17,619
Jesus.

1040
01:19:01,288 --> 01:19:04,333
Well, I'd got so used
to having them come up benign.

1041
01:19:06,168 --> 01:19:09,129
Guess I just didn't expect it.

1042
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:13,926
I sure wish I would've had longer
to get used to the idea.

1043
01:19:17,513 --> 01:19:19,640
You think if you got no uterus...

1044
01:19:19,848 --> 01:19:23,268
...and no breasts...

1045
01:19:23,477 --> 01:19:26,271
...you're still technically a woman?

1046
01:19:27,981 --> 01:19:30,025
Sure you are.

1047
01:19:30,234 --> 01:19:32,027
Yeah, you just...

1048
01:19:32,236 --> 01:19:34,822
You're actually a happier woman.

1049
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:38,075
No need to worry
about maxi-pads and underwire.

1050
01:19:45,624 --> 01:19:47,417
We're gonna get them, aren't we?

1051
01:19:47,793 --> 01:19:50,838
You gotta promise me
that we're gonna get them.

1052
01:20:07,062 --> 01:20:10,107
/ have before me
a complaint on behalf of residents...

1053
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:17,406
...of Hinkley, California, who
have filed against PG&E.

1054
01:20:17,614 --> 01:20:20,617
For damages, medical expenses
and personal trauma...

1055
01:20:20,826 --> 01:20:25,539
...due to contamination of the ground
water in their area by the defendant.

1056
01:20:26,248 --> 01:20:29,501
And I have here 84 motions
to strike and demurrers...

1057
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:33,672
...submitted by representatives
of Pacific Gas & Electric.

1058
01:20:33,881 --> 01:20:37,092
Each one attacking
the validity of this complaint.

1059
01:20:37,968 --> 01:20:41,305
I have reviewed all of
the information carefully.

1060
01:20:41,805 --> 01:20:43,891
I'm ready to give my decision.

1061
01:20:44,099 --> 01:20:47,102
Before I do, is there
anything anyone wants to say?

1062
01:20:48,145 --> 01:20:50,772
-No, Your Honour.
-No, Your Honour.

1063
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:53,192
Very well.

1064
01:20:53,484 --> 01:20:58,197
In the matter of the plaintiffs
of Hinkley, California vs. PG&E...

1065
01:20:58,405 --> 01:21:02,618
...it is the order of this court that
each of the 84 motions to strike...

1066
01:21:02,826 --> 01:21:05,454
...and demurrers are denied.

1067
01:21:05,662 --> 01:21:10,501
And the causes of action against
Pacific Gas and Electric are upheld.

1068
01:21:11,335 --> 01:21:12,878
On a more personal note...

1069
01:21:13,504 --> 01:21:17,549
...as a resident here in Barstow,
which is not far from Hinkley...

1070
01:21:17,758 --> 01:21:20,260
...I am disturbed by reference...

1071
01:21:20,469 --> 01:21:25,390
...to evidence that suggests that not
only was hexavalent chromium used...

1072
01:21:25,599 --> 01:21:30,062
...but that your clients
actually sent these residents...

1073
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:33,315
...pamphlets telling them
that it was good for them.

1074
01:21:34,566 --> 01:21:36,693
Tell your clients
they're going to trial.

1075
01:21:48,455 --> 01:21:51,625
Jesus. They look
like the Secret Service.

1076
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:54,211
Intimidation.

1077
01:21:56,046 --> 01:21:58,173
Let the games begin.

1078
01:21:58,465 --> 01:22:00,676
Show them into the conference room.

1079
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:04,721
Donald, Anna...

1080
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:08,183
...I wanna talk to you for a minute.

1081
01:22:12,771 --> 01:22:13,939
Counsellors.

1082
01:22:14,148 --> 01:22:15,107
Counsellors.

1083
01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:23,699
Let's be honest.

1084
01:22:24,324 --> 01:22:27,744
$20,000,000 is more than
these people have ever dreamed of.

1085
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:30,789
Now that pisses me off.

1086
01:22:31,748 --> 01:22:35,544
First of all, since the demurrer,
we have more than 400 plaintiffs.

1087
01:22:35,752 --> 01:22:38,046
Let's be honest, we know there's more.

1088
01:22:38,297 --> 01:22:41,508
They may not be sophisticated,
but they can divide...

1089
01:22:41,717 --> 01:22:44,636
...and $20,000,000
isn't shit after splitting it.

1090
01:22:44,845 --> 01:22:45,929
Second of all...

1091
01:22:46,138 --> 01:22:48,098
...they don't dream of being rich.

1092
01:22:48,307 --> 01:22:51,185
They dream about
watching their kids in a pool...

1093
01:22:51,393 --> 01:22:54,980
...without worrying that
they'll have a hysterectomy at 20.

1094
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:56,982
Like Rosa Diaz, our client.

1095
01:22:57,274 --> 01:23:01,862
Or have their spine deteriorate, like
Stan Bloom, another client of ours.

1096
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:05,908
So before you come back here
with another lame-ass offer...

1097
01:23:06,116 --> 01:23:10,037
...I want you to think real
hard about what your spine is worth.

1098
01:23:10,454 --> 01:23:13,624
Or what you expect someone
to pay you for your uterus.

1099
01:23:14,374 --> 01:23:18,086
Then take out your calculator
and multiply that number by 100.

1100
01:23:18,545 --> 01:23:21,465
Anything less than that
is a waste of our time.

1101
01:23:23,842 --> 01:23:27,054
We had that water brought
in special for you folks.

1102
01:23:27,262 --> 01:23:28,305
Came from Hinkley.

1103
01:23:45,572 --> 01:23:47,032
I think this meeting's over.

1104
01:23:47,533 --> 01:23:49,117
Damn right it is.

1105
01:24:26,196 --> 01:24:30,409
What the fuck? Did a bomb blow up?
You letting the kids run wild?

1106
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:42,171
What's that?

1107
01:24:52,473 --> 01:24:54,391
I saw them in a mall one day.

1108
01:24:55,934 --> 01:24:57,519
I said, " Damn...

1109
01:24:58,187 --> 01:25:00,772
...they'll look good on
those beautiful ears."

1110
01:25:02,983 --> 01:25:07,821
I bought them and I said, "When Erin
does something nice, I'll surprise her."

1111
01:25:09,448 --> 01:25:11,492
You know how long ago that was?

1112
01:25:14,203 --> 01:25:15,245
Six months ago.

1113
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:21,502
-I'm sorry, I've just...
-And so what I'm thinking is...

1114
01:25:25,422 --> 01:25:28,550
Either you gotta find
a different job or a different guy.

1115
01:25:30,969 --> 01:25:32,137
I mean...

1116
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:37,351
There may be many men out there
who don't mind being the maid...

1117
01:25:37,559 --> 01:25:40,229
...and getting nothing.
But I ain't one of them.

1118
01:25:43,023 --> 01:25:44,608
I can't leave my job, George.

1119
01:25:44,858 --> 01:25:46,318
Yes, you can.

1120
01:25:47,236 --> 01:25:49,154
People do it all the time.

1121
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,366
How can you ask me to do that?

1122
01:25:54,076 --> 01:25:55,911
This job...

1123
01:25:57,454 --> 01:26:01,625
For the first time in my
life, I got people respecting me.

1124
01:26:01,834 --> 01:26:03,293
Up in Hinkley...

1125
01:26:03,502 --> 01:26:07,840
...I walk into a room, everybody shuts
up to hear what I have to say.

1126
01:26:08,048 --> 01:26:11,135
I never had that before, ever.

1127
01:26:11,969 --> 01:26:13,971
Please, don't ask me to give it up.

1128
01:26:14,346 --> 01:26:15,973
What about your kids?

1129
01:26:17,015 --> 01:26:20,811
I'm doing more for them now
than I did living with my parents.

1130
01:26:21,019 --> 01:26:22,437
One day they'll see it.

1131
01:26:22,646 --> 01:26:25,315
-Well, what about me?
-What about you?

1132
01:26:29,611 --> 01:26:32,156
You think the men
who gave me those children...

1133
01:26:32,364 --> 01:26:35,534
...asked me what I
wanted before walking away?

1134
01:26:35,742 --> 01:26:39,163
All I've ever done
is bend my life around...

1135
01:26:39,371 --> 01:26:41,665
...what men decide they need.

1136
01:26:41,874 --> 01:26:44,918
Well, not now.
I'm sorry. I won't do it.

1137
01:26:45,127 --> 01:26:46,170
Well...

1138
01:26:47,171 --> 01:26:49,506
Erin, I'm not them. So...

1139
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:52,468
What more can I do
to prove that to you?

1140
01:26:53,635 --> 01:26:54,928
Stay.

1141
01:27:11,069 --> 01:27:12,446
What for?

1142
01:27:15,157 --> 01:27:16,658
I mean, you got a raise.

1143
01:27:16,867 --> 01:27:19,161
You can afford daycare.
You don't need me.

1144
01:28:04,248 --> 01:28:05,415
Hi.

1145
01:28:21,473 --> 01:28:22,891
We can get them, Pamela.

1146
01:28:24,143 --> 01:28:25,435
We can.

1147
01:28:25,894 --> 01:28:28,772
I don't wanna feel it all over again...

1148
01:28:28,981 --> 01:28:31,692
...and then not have it come out right.

1149
01:28:33,402 --> 01:28:36,071
I don't know if I could handle that.

1150
01:28:36,989 --> 01:28:38,991
Put the kids through that.

1151
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:43,662
The thing is, it doesn't matter
whether you win, lose or draw here.

1152
01:28:43,871 --> 01:28:49,001
You were lied to. You're sick and your
kids are sick because of those lies.

1153
01:28:51,753 --> 01:28:54,465
You all have to come together...

1154
01:28:54,673 --> 01:28:57,176
...to stand up in
a courtroom and say that.

1155
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:05,350
I'd bring the kids
into the hospital...

1156
01:29:05,559 --> 01:29:09,396
...with towels soaked
from their nosebleeds.

1157
01:29:13,275 --> 01:29:17,988
They called County Services because
they assumed the kids were abused.

1158
01:29:22,868 --> 01:29:26,121
Am I gonna get the best
behaviour in the office?

1159
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:27,539
No.

1160
01:29:27,748 --> 01:29:32,794
What's with the attitude?
I just need cool, I need quiet.

1161
01:29:33,212 --> 01:29:35,714
Hello. Am I alone in the car? Yes?

1162
01:29:35,923 --> 01:29:39,551
-I don't understand why...
-I don't wanna talk about it now.

1163
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,262
-The other moms gave permission.
-I don't care.

1164
01:29:42,471 --> 01:29:46,934
-So when can I get a friggin' answer?
-Don't talk to me like that!

1165
01:29:47,142 --> 01:29:48,685
Randy's mom said yes.

1166
01:29:48,894 --> 01:29:52,564
Goddamn it, Randy's mom doesn't
work, and his dad didn't leave her!

1167
01:29:52,773 --> 01:29:55,317
Figuring out who
takes him to roller hockey...

1168
01:29:55,526 --> 01:29:58,695
...is probably easier at
Randy's house. Now cool it.

1169
01:30:03,534 --> 01:30:06,995
I'll be as quick as I can.
Matthew, can you watch your sister?

1170
01:30:07,871 --> 01:30:10,833
-Matthew.
-All right, fine. Come here, Beth.

1171
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:14,044
-Can I come with you?
-No, baby, I'll just be a second.

1172
01:30:50,247 --> 01:30:52,875
Thank you. I'm only
sorry you couldn't meet Erin.

1173
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:54,209
-I will.
-You will.

1174
01:30:54,418 --> 01:30:56,920
We have a lot of work to do together.

1175
01:30:57,129 --> 01:31:00,007
Thanks for coming.
Erin, I was just talking about you.

1176
01:31:00,215 --> 01:31:03,427
Meet our new partner, Kurt Potter.
He'll handle Hinkley.

1177
01:31:03,635 --> 01:31:06,305
I see what you mean
about a secret weapon.

1178
01:31:06,513 --> 01:31:09,933
Erin, it's great to meet you.
You've done a fabulous job.

1179
01:31:10,142 --> 01:31:13,520
-I'll be seeing you.
-Thanks, I appreciate you coming over.

1180
01:31:25,908 --> 01:31:26,742
What?

1181
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:28,494
Our new partner?

1182
01:31:28,702 --> 01:31:31,121
When was I gonna hear about this?

1183
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:34,917
Just listen. Did I ever tell
you about that airline case?

1184
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:37,252
What the fuck are you talking about?

1185
01:31:37,461 --> 01:31:40,214
A few years back, I was
trying this airline case...

1186
01:31:40,422 --> 01:31:44,885
...and I got my ass kicked by this
guy. He buried me in paper, brutal.

1187
01:31:45,093 --> 01:31:47,262
He's the toughest
I'd ever been up against.

1188
01:31:47,471 --> 01:31:48,555
Make a point!

1189
01:31:48,847 --> 01:31:50,766
It was Kurt Potter.

1190
01:31:51,558 --> 01:31:56,688
After the judge's decision, I asked
him to partner, he didn't hesitate.

1191
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:01,026
He wouldn't hesitate now, we did
all the work. Where was he before?

1192
01:32:01,235 --> 01:32:04,071
Will you listen to me?
It doesn't matter.

1193
01:32:04,279 --> 01:32:06,782
You wanna win this?
He gave me this check.

1194
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:09,284
It covers all our expenses to date...

1195
01:32:09,493 --> 01:32:12,830
...and he's got more toxic
tort experience than anyone.

1196
01:32:13,038 --> 01:32:14,373
This is good news!

1197
01:32:18,752 --> 01:32:20,379
I got Pamela Duncan.

1198
01:32:32,933 --> 01:32:35,269
I'll open, Mommy.

1199
01:32:35,477 --> 01:32:38,939
You wanna open the can for
Mommy? Well, here, I'll help you.

1200
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:41,108
You turn it?

1201
01:32:42,943 --> 01:32:45,779
-Hi, George.
-Hi, George. Let's go see.

1202
01:33:12,264 --> 01:33:13,348
Erin Brockovich?

1203
01:33:14,057 --> 01:33:16,351
Package from Masry and Vititoe.

1204
01:33:27,571 --> 01:33:29,698
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1205
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:34,703
-What's in here?
-Baby.

1206
01:33:34,912 --> 01:33:37,206
There's no baby in here.

1207
01:33:37,873 --> 01:33:39,541
-What is it?
-A dolly.

1208
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:42,002
It's a dolly? It's...

1209
01:33:55,098 --> 01:33:56,266
Lookit.

1210
01:33:59,186 --> 01:34:00,938
"Lookit" is right.

1211
01:34:08,654 --> 01:34:10,155
Do you see that?

1212
01:34:14,535 --> 01:34:16,787
-I want that.
-I want that too.

1213
01:34:16,995 --> 01:34:18,664
It's our lucky day.

1214
01:34:18,872 --> 01:34:20,374
Matthew, Katie!

1215
01:34:31,301 --> 01:34:34,680
PG&E has requested that we
submit to binding arbitration.

1216
01:34:35,139 --> 01:34:36,431
What's that?

1217
01:34:38,517 --> 01:34:41,812
That's where we try the case
without a jury, before a judge.

1218
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:43,313
It's called a test trial.

1219
01:34:43,605 --> 01:34:46,650
The judge's decision
is final. There's no appeal.

1220
01:34:47,776 --> 01:34:51,071
-How many plaintiffs do you have?
-634.

1221
01:34:52,072 --> 01:34:54,408
They'll never try
that many all at once.

1222
01:34:54,616 --> 01:34:58,120
So we need to get them together
in groups of 20 or 30.

1223
01:34:58,328 --> 01:35:03,208
Worst cases, the most life-threatened,
the sickest first and so on.

1224
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:06,795
Each one gets a go before
the judge to determine damages.

1225
01:35:07,171 --> 01:35:09,173
PG&E proposes that they're liable...

1226
01:35:09,381 --> 01:35:13,177
...anywhere between
50 and 400 million.

1227
01:35:14,678 --> 01:35:17,473
So wait a minute. Let
me just get this straight.

1228
01:35:17,764 --> 01:35:18,849
If we went to trial...

1229
01:35:19,057 --> 01:35:23,145
...PG&E could stretch this over
10 years with appeal after appeal.

1230
01:35:23,353 --> 01:35:26,231
-Those people would...
-These people expect a trial.

1231
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:30,861
That's what we told them, you
and me. They won't understand this.

1232
01:35:33,155 --> 01:35:35,574
Kurt thinks it's the best way to go.

1233
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,463
Look, I promise you that we'll
be very sensitive on this point.

1234
01:35:49,922 --> 01:35:51,590
We'll make sure they see...

1235
01:35:51,799 --> 01:35:55,677
...that this is the only way
we can go forward at this time.

1236
01:35:56,386 --> 01:35:58,472
But we have a lot of work to do...

1237
01:35:59,056 --> 01:36:01,934
...before we even broach that subject.

1238
01:36:03,602 --> 01:36:05,521
I'll take Erin down the hall...

1239
01:36:05,729 --> 01:36:10,275
...so we can start on this stuff,
and I'll fill her in on the details.

1240
01:36:10,984 --> 01:36:14,655
-Those are my files.
-Yeah. We had them couriered over.

1241
01:36:15,113 --> 01:36:17,241
Listen, good work.
They're a great start.

1242
01:36:17,449 --> 01:36:21,119
We'll just spend some time
filling in the holes in your research.

1243
01:36:21,328 --> 01:36:26,208
Excuse me... Theresa, is it?
There are no holes in my research.

1244
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:30,045
There are things we need
you probably didn't know to ask.

1245
01:36:30,546 --> 01:36:32,548
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

1246
01:36:32,756 --> 01:36:35,050
I spent 18 months on this case...

1247
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:38,804
...and I know more about
the plaintiffs than you ever will.

1248
01:36:40,264 --> 01:36:42,391
You don't even have phone numbers.

1249
01:36:42,808 --> 01:36:44,059
Whose number do you need?

1250
01:36:44,268 --> 01:36:47,646
Everyone's. We need to be
able to contact the plaintiffs.

1251
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:50,107
I said whose number do you need?

1252
01:36:51,525 --> 01:36:53,902
You don't know 600 numbers by heart.

1253
01:37:08,959 --> 01:37:10,169
Annabelle Daniels.

1254
01:37:10,377 --> 01:37:14,506
Annabelle Daniels. 714-454-9346.

1255
01:37:14,715 --> 01:37:17,801
Ten years old. Lived
on the plume since birth.

1256
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:22,431
Wanted to be a synchronized swimmer,
so she spent every minute in the pool.

1257
01:37:22,723 --> 01:37:24,808
They detected a tumour in her brain.

1258
01:37:25,017 --> 01:37:27,936
An operation shrunk it,
with radiation after that.

1259
01:37:28,187 --> 01:37:29,813
Her parents are Ted and Rita.

1260
01:37:30,022 --> 01:37:35,110
Ted's got Crohn's disease. Rita has
headaches and underwent a hysterectomy.

1261
01:37:35,402 --> 01:37:39,364
Ted grew up in Hinkley. His
brother and his wife and their kids...

1262
01:37:39,573 --> 01:37:43,660
...Robbie Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose
and Peter also lived on the plume.

1263
01:37:43,869 --> 01:37:46,038
Their number is 454-9554.

1264
01:37:46,288 --> 01:37:48,165
You want their diseases?

1265
01:37:53,587 --> 01:37:55,756
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1266
01:37:55,964 --> 01:37:59,843
That's all you got, lady, two
wrong feet in fucking ugly shoes.

1267
01:38:06,183 --> 01:38:09,645
-She insulted me.
-Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding.

1268
01:38:09,853 --> 01:38:12,898
Instead of being polite and
treating her with respect...

1269
01:38:13,106 --> 01:38:14,566
Why should I respect her?

1270
01:38:14,775 --> 01:38:19,530
Just because she's not supporting kids
with no husband, she's not an idiot!

1271
01:38:19,738 --> 01:38:21,949
Just because she
dresses like a lawyer...

1272
01:38:22,157 --> 01:38:25,661
...doesn't mean she didn't
work her ass off in law school.

1273
01:38:25,869 --> 01:38:27,996
Excuse me for not going to law school.

1274
01:38:28,205 --> 01:38:32,084
Law school? At this point,
I'd settle for charm school!

1275
01:38:40,467 --> 01:38:41,677
Mr. Linwood!

1276
01:38:50,018 --> 01:38:51,478
Bob?

1277
01:38:56,066 --> 01:38:59,820
6086 Ridge Road...

1278
01:39:00,696 --> 01:39:03,824
...Hinkley, California. 714...

1279
01:39:05,492 --> 01:39:07,161
...455...

1280
01:39:08,328 --> 01:39:11,540
Okay, now, if you
could walk me through...

1281
01:39:11,874 --> 01:39:16,920
...all of the elements
of Annabelle's illnesses.

1282
01:39:18,213 --> 01:39:19,882
Specific details...

1283
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:24,970
...when the symptoms began,
prior to the first medical visit.

1284
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:30,100
If you could reserve sentimental
embellishments, I'd appreciate it...

1285
01:39:30,309 --> 01:39:32,811
...because they won't
help you in court.

1286
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:36,148
I just need facts, dates, time.

1287
01:39:37,316 --> 01:39:40,402
/ know Theresa isn't real
warm, but she's a good lawyer.

1288
01:39:41,111 --> 01:39:44,907
She asks the same questions
you did. / told you everything.

1289
01:39:45,115 --> 01:39:49,620
/ don't want her coming to the
house again. She upsets Annabelle.

1290
01:39:49,828 --> 01:39:52,581
Okay, if you don't like
Theresa, that's okay.

1291
01:39:52,789 --> 01:39:55,584
You know how important
Annabelle is to me.

1292
01:39:55,793 --> 01:39:57,795
Ed and I are still here for you.

1293
01:39:58,003 --> 01:40:02,049
I called Ed two days ago, Erin.
He still hasn't called me back.

1294
01:40:02,257 --> 01:40:04,426
Now, I hate to say this, but...

1295
01:40:04,676 --> 01:40:07,429
...everyone's upset
about this arbitration thing.

1296
01:40:08,305 --> 01:40:09,556
What?

1297
01:40:09,765 --> 01:40:12,017
Pamela has written a letter...

1298
01:40:12,226 --> 01:40:14,728
...telling everybody
to get new lawyers.

1299
01:40:14,937 --> 01:40:16,188
That we've been lied to.

1300
01:40:16,605 --> 01:40:19,274
-/s it true?
-No.

1301
01:40:19,775 --> 01:40:20,943
Did you?

1302
01:40:21,151 --> 01:40:25,322
I'm telling you the truth, and
I'll get to the bottom of all of this.

1303
01:40:25,531 --> 01:40:26,990
Don't lie to us.

1304
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:28,700
I will take care of this.

1305
01:40:28,909 --> 01:40:31,954
-Now, we're trusting you here, so...
-Thanks.

1306
01:40:32,162 --> 01:40:34,206
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

1307
01:40:37,709 --> 01:40:39,962
I'm not saying
it's not a strong case.

1308
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:44,383
Otherwise, they wouldn't have dropped
the demurrers. I wouldn't be here.

1309
01:40:44,591 --> 01:40:47,594
What I am saying is, we
don't have a smoking gun...

1310
01:40:47,803 --> 01:40:49,888
...that ties San Francisco to Hinkley.

1311
01:40:50,097 --> 01:40:53,350
Something that
proves that prior to 1987...

1312
01:40:53,559 --> 01:40:58,438
...PG&E Corporate knew the water was
bad there and did nothing about it.

1313
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:04,528
-Erin, I thought you took a sick day.
-So did I.

1314
01:41:10,325 --> 01:41:13,453
-What's going on in there?
-Meeting about the PG&E thing.

1315
01:41:13,662 --> 01:41:15,789
-Are you sure?
-Yep.

1316
01:41:17,875 --> 01:41:21,003
We can find it, or
we don't have a big win.

1317
01:41:21,795 --> 01:41:24,631
Can I take a brief
break here for a moment?

1318
01:41:25,382 --> 01:41:26,717
I'll be right back.

1319
01:41:36,351 --> 01:41:39,855
-You told me you weren't feeling great.
-Bullshit!

1320
01:41:40,063 --> 01:41:44,985
If I was on my deathbed, if it
helped you, you'd drag me out of it!

1321
01:41:49,239 --> 01:41:50,657
How could you take this away from me?

1322
01:41:50,866 --> 01:41:54,828
-Nobody's taking anything.
-Bullshit! You stuck me in Siberia!

1323
01:41:55,078 --> 01:41:59,750
Dictating to some goddamned clerk
so you could finish this without me.

1324
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:01,752
They screwed up, Erin!

1325
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:04,296
They screwed up and they admit it.

1326
01:42:04,546 --> 01:42:06,298
The arbitration proposal...

1327
01:42:06,548 --> 01:42:10,302
...could've been written in Sanskrit,
for all the sense it made.

1328
01:42:10,511 --> 01:42:15,516
I know. I spoke to Ted. Pamela Duncan
wouldn't even get on the phone with me!

1329
01:42:15,724 --> 01:42:18,018
Pamela made everybody
mad with that letter.

1330
01:42:18,227 --> 01:42:19,686
She called us thieves.

1331
01:42:19,895 --> 01:42:21,939
-The whole thing's falling apart.
-Why?

1332
01:42:22,147 --> 01:42:26,026
Because before we go to arbitration,
the plaintiffs must agree!

1333
01:42:26,235 --> 01:42:29,488
-How many?
-Usually they require about 70%.

1334
01:42:29,696 --> 01:42:33,242
PG&E is demanding 90.
In other words, everybody.

1335
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:35,536
Do you understand? This is serious.

1336
01:42:35,744 --> 01:42:38,163
And, what, Ed? I'm not serious?

1337
01:42:38,372 --> 01:42:40,415
You're emotional, you're erratic.

1338
01:42:40,624 --> 01:42:43,752
You say anything, you make
this personal, and it isn't.

1339
01:42:44,044 --> 01:42:45,546
Not personal?

1340
01:42:45,754 --> 01:42:47,297
That is my work!

1341
01:42:47,506 --> 01:42:49,716
My sweat! My time away from my kids!

1342
01:42:49,925 --> 01:42:52,970
If that's not personal,
I don't know what is.

1343
01:42:59,184 --> 01:43:00,853
Hey, come on.

1344
01:43:01,061 --> 01:43:02,354
Come on.

1345
01:43:03,438 --> 01:43:05,440
Go home. Get well.

1346
01:43:05,649 --> 01:43:08,193
Because you're no good to me sick.

1347
01:43:08,986 --> 01:43:10,904
I need you, all right?

1348
01:43:11,613 --> 01:43:13,615
This case needs you.

1349
01:43:16,326 --> 01:43:18,203
Did you tell them that?

1350
01:43:43,729 --> 01:43:46,857
Binding arbitration isn't
that different from a trial.

1351
01:43:47,065 --> 01:43:51,445
It's overseen by a judge. Evidence
is presented in much the same way.

1352
01:43:51,653 --> 01:43:53,280
And then a jury decides?

1353
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:58,702
Sorry, I forgot to mention that
there's no jury in binding arbitration.

1354
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:00,704
No jury and no appeal.

1355
01:44:02,623 --> 01:44:05,459
What option do we have if
we don't like the result?

1356
01:44:05,667 --> 01:44:07,753
None. The judge's decision is final.

1357
01:44:07,961 --> 01:44:08,879
Not a good answer.

1358
01:44:09,087 --> 01:44:12,090
No, but we don't
anticipate that being a problem.

1359
01:44:12,299 --> 01:44:13,842
As I already told you...

1360
01:44:14,301 --> 01:44:17,971
...it's definitely between
50 and 400,000,000 dollars.

1361
01:44:18,305 --> 01:44:20,557
Well, which?
There's a big difference.

1362
01:44:20,766 --> 01:44:22,768
I wouldn't like to speculate.

1363
01:44:24,311 --> 01:44:28,065
-Well, how does it get divided?
-Yeah, who gets what?

1364
01:44:30,984 --> 01:44:35,614
My medical bills started two years ago,
before some of the other people here.

1365
01:44:35,823 --> 01:44:38,909
My daughter was in and out
of hospitals more than his.

1366
01:44:39,117 --> 01:44:41,829
It shouldn't matter when it started.

1367
01:44:43,163 --> 01:44:45,541
People, listen, please!

1368
01:44:45,749 --> 01:44:50,337
The point we have to address
tonight is getting everyone to agree...

1369
01:44:50,546 --> 01:44:53,590
...that binding arbitration
is better than a trial...

1370
01:44:53,799 --> 01:44:57,344
...that could go on for
10 years before you see any money.

1371
01:44:57,553 --> 01:45:00,848
Maybe some of us
wanna wait 10 years!

1372
01:45:04,643 --> 01:45:07,855
Everyone has to agree,
or no one has a chance!

1373
01:45:08,397 --> 01:45:13,402
Those of you about to leave, I'd like
you to keep this date in mind: 1978!

1374
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:16,905
That's the year of
the Love Canal controversy.

1375
01:45:17,114 --> 01:45:19,449
They're still
waiting for their money!

1376
01:45:19,658 --> 01:45:22,953
Think about where
you'll be in 15 or 20 years.

1377
01:45:29,793 --> 01:45:33,130
Now, look, everyone.
Is this a big decision?

1378
01:45:33,422 --> 01:45:38,469
Absolutely! But I do not
believe this is a sell-out.

1379
01:45:38,802 --> 01:45:41,763
This is the best shot
to get everyone some money now.

1380
01:45:44,057 --> 01:45:46,393
You and I both know...

1381
01:45:47,102 --> 01:45:50,564
...there are people in this
room who can't afford to wait.

1382
01:45:51,857 --> 01:45:53,066
To take that chance.

1383
01:45:54,234 --> 01:45:56,069
Are you gonna make them wait?

1384
01:46:03,076 --> 01:46:05,037
So how many altogether?

1385
01:46:06,997 --> 01:46:11,794
We got just about everybody that came
here, but it leaves us about 150 short.

1386
01:46:12,002 --> 01:46:13,587
Oh, shit.

1387
01:46:15,547 --> 01:46:17,341
We'll have to go door-to-door.

1388
01:46:19,927 --> 01:46:22,054
I gotta go pick up my kids.

1389
01:46:26,308 --> 01:46:28,393
-You need a hand with that?
-No.

1390
01:46:34,817 --> 01:46:35,776
You did good.

1391
01:46:37,569 --> 01:46:39,029
We'll see.

1392
01:47:13,856 --> 01:47:15,315
Thanks for coming.

1393
01:47:20,404 --> 01:47:24,908
Don't take them anywhere on your
bike. I'll give you money for a cab.

1394
01:47:25,576 --> 01:47:26,785
I got money.

1395
01:47:27,494 --> 01:47:29,496
So how long is this gonna take?

1396
01:47:32,624 --> 01:47:34,293
I don't know. A few days.

1397
01:47:35,794 --> 01:47:37,421
Got your own room.

1398
01:47:50,142 --> 01:47:51,852
I am really sorry, George.

1399
01:47:54,271 --> 01:47:55,397
Have the kids eaten?

1400
01:47:59,151 --> 01:48:00,152
No.

1401
01:49:07,761 --> 01:49:10,722
Wanna get some pancakes?
Come on, let's go.

1402
01:49:10,931 --> 01:49:14,434
Everybody up today.

1403
01:49:14,643 --> 01:49:16,061
All right.

1404
01:49:16,395 --> 01:49:17,604
Come on, baby.

1405
01:49:17,813 --> 01:49:20,232
-What time is it?
-It's early.

1406
01:49:20,482 --> 01:49:23,152
We're taking your
car to go get breakfast.

1407
01:49:24,695 --> 01:49:28,157
-No, I need my car.
-We'll be back in a minute.

1408
01:49:29,366 --> 01:49:30,868
Get some sleep.

1409
01:49:31,702 --> 01:49:35,247
Matt, buddy.
Put that down. Let's go.

1410
01:49:35,456 --> 01:49:37,124
I'll be there in a minute.

1411
01:49:39,293 --> 01:49:42,963
Let's go get some
pancakes, girly. Come on.

1412
01:49:52,264 --> 01:49:53,432
Don't play with that.

1413
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:57,853
It took me so long to get organized.
Would you put that back, please?

1414
01:49:58,061 --> 01:49:59,938
This girl's the same age as me.

1415
01:50:05,486 --> 01:50:06,695
Is she sick?

1416
01:50:10,657 --> 01:50:13,577
She is, but that's
why I'm helping her.

1417
01:50:13,785 --> 01:50:15,537
We'll make her feel better.

1418
01:50:16,205 --> 01:50:18,207
Why can't her own mama help her?

1419
01:50:21,418 --> 01:50:23,378
Because she's real sick too.

1420
01:50:37,267 --> 01:50:39,478
I'll bring you back some breakfast.

1421
01:50:40,562 --> 01:50:41,980
You want eggs?

1422
01:50:44,775 --> 01:50:46,360
Eggs would be great.

1423
01:50:55,285 --> 01:50:56,995
Eggs would be perfect.

1424
01:52:07,733 --> 01:52:10,736
-Hey, Matt.
-Hey, Erin. How are you?

1425
01:52:13,906 --> 01:52:16,200
-You been at this all day?
-Yeah.

1426
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:18,869
-You want some coffee?
-I'd love some.

1427
01:52:19,077 --> 01:52:21,288
-I'll make a fresh pot.
-Thanks.

1428
01:52:48,148 --> 01:52:49,858
Don't I know you?

1429
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:51,193
I don't think so.

1430
01:52:51,401 --> 01:52:54,238
Sure, you were at the barbecue
in Hinkley.

1431
01:52:54,488 --> 01:52:56,323
And at the town meeting.

1432
01:52:57,658 --> 01:52:59,451
I was watching you.

1433
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:02,996
I had my eye on you.

1434
01:53:05,457 --> 01:53:06,750
Nice.

1435
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,088
You were talking to everybody
and writing down a lot of stuff.

1436
01:53:11,338 --> 01:53:16,135
When I saw you, I said to myself,
"There's something about her.

1437
01:53:17,261 --> 01:53:19,555
I really like that girl."

1438
01:53:21,431 --> 01:53:24,309
-Matt, can I get that coffee to go?
-Sure thing.

1439
01:53:27,855 --> 01:53:30,315
I feel like I can talk to you too.

1440
01:53:31,650 --> 01:53:35,112
Like you're the type of person
I could say anything to.

1441
01:53:36,989 --> 01:53:38,240
-Here you go.
-Great.

1442
01:53:38,490 --> 01:53:39,533
What do I owe you?

1443
01:53:39,783 --> 01:53:42,494
-There's no charge.
-Thanks, Matt.

1444
01:53:42,744 --> 01:53:45,539
Well, nice talking to you.

1445
01:53:45,747 --> 01:53:50,252
Would it be important if, when I worked
at the plant, I destroyed documents?

1446
01:53:56,175 --> 01:53:57,634
Maybe.

1447
01:53:59,595 --> 01:54:00,888
What's your name?

1448
01:54:01,555 --> 01:54:03,265
Charles Embry.

1449
01:54:03,724 --> 01:54:05,559
Charles. Erin.

1450
01:54:05,851 --> 01:54:07,311
Nice to meet you.

1451
01:54:09,813 --> 01:54:14,026
Can you excuse me for a quick...
I'm just gonna run to the...

1452
01:54:28,582 --> 01:54:29,917
Oh, come on.

1453
01:54:31,919 --> 01:54:35,214
Oh, you fucking piece of crap
with no signal!

1454
01:54:35,464 --> 01:54:36,840
Fuck!

1455
01:54:54,608 --> 01:54:55,984
Ed. Ed, oh, my God.

1456
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:59,696
This guy said he destroyed records.
He worked there.

1457
01:54:59,947 --> 01:55:00,823
Slow down.

1458
01:55:01,073 --> 01:55:03,867
/'m trying to relax.
This Charles Embry...

1459
01:55:04,117 --> 01:55:05,661
-Who?
-Charles Embry.

1460
01:55:05,911 --> 01:55:08,789
I thought he was trying to kill me
or pick me up...

1461
01:55:09,039 --> 01:55:12,501
...but why would he use that,
say that? /t's crazy.

1462
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:19,133
Shit. Go back and see if he'll
make a declaration.

1463
01:55:19,383 --> 01:55:20,425
A declaration.

1464
01:55:20,634 --> 01:55:22,845
But be careful.
Don't scare him off.

1465
01:55:23,428 --> 01:55:26,098
And stay calm. Stay calm.

1466
01:55:26,348 --> 01:55:29,476
If it weren't for you,
I'd be in Palm Springs now.

1467
01:55:29,726 --> 01:55:32,146
You're good at talking people
into things.

1468
01:55:32,396 --> 01:55:37,317
Don't pepper him with questions.
Don't do that. Just...

1469
01:55:37,526 --> 01:55:41,363
People wanna tell their story.
Just let him talk. Let him...

1470
01:55:41,613 --> 01:55:44,324
...do all the talking. All right?

1471
01:55:48,954 --> 01:55:50,664
Oh, sorry.

1472
01:55:55,127 --> 01:55:57,337
Would you like another beer, or...

1473
01:56:05,971 --> 01:56:07,973
My cousin passed away yesterday.

1474
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:12,895
He had kidney tumours...

1475
01:56:13,145 --> 01:56:17,149
...no colon, his intestines
were eaten away.

1476
01:56:17,357 --> 01:56:19,234
Forty-one years old.

1477
01:56:20,694 --> 01:56:22,905
I remember seeing him
over at the plant.

1478
01:56:23,155 --> 01:56:26,366
He'd be cleaning
the cooling towers, wearing...

1479
01:56:26,617 --> 01:56:28,410
What do you call them?

1480
01:56:28,619 --> 01:56:31,497
-A mask?
-Yeah, doctors' masks.

1481
01:56:32,873 --> 01:56:35,918
And it'd be soaked in red
from the nosebleeds.

1482
01:56:49,473 --> 01:56:51,600
I was working in the compressor.

1483
01:56:51,850 --> 01:56:55,437
The supervisor calls me
up to the office and says:

1484
01:56:55,687 --> 01:56:57,439
"We'll give you a shredder...

1485
01:56:57,689 --> 01:57:01,360
...and send you to the warehouse
to shred the documents we stored."

1486
01:57:03,695 --> 01:57:05,239
He say why?

1487
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:09,243
Nope. And I didn't ask.

1488
01:57:13,247 --> 01:57:15,749
Did you look at the stuff
you destroyed?

1489
01:57:15,999 --> 01:57:18,794
It was a lot of dull
vacation schedules and stuff.

1490
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:24,216
Then there were memos about
the holding ponds, the water in them.

1491
01:57:24,466 --> 01:57:28,929
And readings from the test wells,
stuff like that.

1492
01:57:33,016 --> 01:57:35,352
You were told to destroy those?

1493
01:57:35,686 --> 01:57:36,770
That's right.

1494
01:57:39,273 --> 01:57:41,233
Course, as it turns out...

1495
01:57:41,483 --> 01:57:44,361
...I wasn't a very good employee.

1496
01:58:00,752 --> 01:58:02,463
-Good morning!
-Morning.

1497
01:58:03,088 --> 01:58:05,174
Ed. Erin, what's this?

1498
01:58:06,091 --> 01:58:08,510
-May I?
-Yep. Go ahead.

1499
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:11,346
Well, you know what, Mr. Potter?

1500
01:58:11,597 --> 01:58:14,558
We completely forgot
your birthday this year.

1501
01:58:14,808 --> 01:58:18,520
Seeing as how you've been so good
to me, it's a terrible oversight.

1502
01:58:18,770 --> 01:58:22,816
So Ed and I have been putting together
a present for you.

1503
01:58:23,066 --> 01:58:25,027
Six-hundred and thirty-four.

1504
01:58:25,486 --> 01:58:27,070
They're signed, every one.

1505
01:58:27,988 --> 01:58:29,364
Holy shit.

1506
01:58:29,573 --> 01:58:32,284
Now, don't go
getting jealous, Theresa.

1507
01:58:32,534 --> 01:58:34,119
We have something for you.

1508
01:58:34,661 --> 01:58:37,915
Internal PG&E documents,
all about the contamination.

1509
01:58:38,165 --> 01:58:39,875
The one I like best says...

1510
01:58:40,125 --> 01:58:43,921
...l'm paraphrasing here, but it says,
"The water's poisonous...

1511
01:58:44,171 --> 01:58:47,758
...but it's best if this wasn't
discussed with the neighbours."

1512
01:58:48,008 --> 01:58:50,469
It's to Hinkley
from PG&E headquarters.

1513
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:53,514
Stamp received March 1966.

1514
01:58:57,893 --> 01:58:59,478
How did you do this?

1515
01:59:00,938 --> 01:59:04,233
Seeing as how I have no
brains or legal expertise...

1516
01:59:04,483 --> 01:59:06,401
...and Ed was losing all faith.

1517
01:59:06,652 --> 01:59:08,195
Completely. No faith.

1518
01:59:08,445 --> 01:59:13,242
I went out there and performed sexual
favours. 634 blowjobs in five days.

1519
01:59:19,998 --> 01:59:21,917
I'm really quite tired.

1520
01:59:22,626 --> 01:59:24,002
Oh, thank you.

1521
01:59:50,362 --> 01:59:52,406
Why did you want me to come?

1522
01:59:54,032 --> 01:59:56,743
I wanna show you
what you helped to do.

1523
02:00:24,354 --> 02:00:26,356
-How are you feeling today?
-Good.

1524
02:00:26,732 --> 02:00:29,359
-It's a good day.
-Oh, I'm glad.

1525
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,570
Well, come on in.

1526
02:00:32,362 --> 02:00:34,990
What a nice surprise this is.

1527
02:00:37,576 --> 02:00:38,619
Donna.

1528
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:46,835
I wanted to come out here
instead of calling...

1529
02:00:47,085 --> 02:00:50,130
...because the judge
came back with a number.

1530
02:00:56,970 --> 02:01:01,350
For the whole group, or for us?

1531
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,477
Both.

1532
02:01:04,728 --> 02:01:09,316
He's gonna make them pay 333 million.

1533
02:01:13,278 --> 02:01:15,489
-And...
-Oh, my God.

1534
02:01:17,908 --> 02:01:21,411
He's gonna make them give
5 million of that to your family.

1535
02:01:23,372 --> 02:01:24,665
Five million dollars?

1536
02:01:24,957 --> 02:01:26,625
Five million dollars.

1537
02:01:30,212 --> 02:01:33,090
I don't even know
how much money that is.

1538
02:01:33,590 --> 02:01:38,137
Well, it's enough. It's enough
for whatever you could ever need...

1539
02:01:38,387 --> 02:01:43,517
...or what your girls need, or your
girls' girls. It'll be enough.

1540
02:01:43,767 --> 02:01:46,895
Oh, Erin. Oh, God.

1541
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:52,067
Thank you so much.

1542
02:01:55,654 --> 02:01:57,072
It's okay.

1543
02:02:01,994 --> 02:02:04,496
I don't know what I'd have done
without you.

1544
02:02:05,664 --> 02:02:07,291
It's a good day.

1545
02:02:08,333 --> 02:02:10,836
This is too much.

1546
02:02:21,513 --> 02:02:25,225
Masry and Vititoe, can l...?
Shoot!

1547
02:02:28,854 --> 02:02:30,564
Delivery for Ed Masry.

1548
02:02:30,814 --> 02:02:33,400
Last office down the corridor,
on the right.

1549
02:02:33,650 --> 02:02:35,027
Thank you.

1550
02:02:35,277 --> 02:02:37,029
Masry and Vititoe...

1551
02:02:37,237 --> 02:02:38,280
Damn it!

1552
02:02:38,489 --> 02:02:41,909
Does anyone know anything
about these phones?

1553
02:02:46,538 --> 02:02:49,082
Everybody loves the desk...

1554
02:02:49,333 --> 02:02:51,919
...you picked out for me.
It's great.

1555
02:02:52,878 --> 02:02:56,507
Guess who's on the cover
of Los Angeles Lawyer magazine?

1556
02:02:56,757 --> 02:02:58,759
Talk to you later, baby. Bye.

1557
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:05,265
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1558
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:23,826
I'd rather walk her through this
in person, to show her...

1559
02:03:24,034 --> 02:03:26,787
...visual aids, documents and stuff.

1560
02:03:27,037 --> 02:03:30,290
Tell her I won't take up
too much of her time.

1561
02:03:34,336 --> 02:03:38,006
It's a little more complicated
than Hinkley, so let me do that.

1562
02:03:40,175 --> 02:03:42,427
Say I'm not a lawyer.
That may help.

1563
02:03:43,470 --> 02:03:44,513
Great.

1564
02:03:44,763 --> 02:03:48,225
Why don't you give me the address now?
Just in case.

1565
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:55,941
All right. Thanks so much. Bye.

1566
02:03:56,233 --> 02:03:57,651
What's up?

1567
02:03:59,111 --> 02:04:01,071
I have your bonus check.

1568
02:04:04,908 --> 02:04:06,743
I want you to be prepared.

1569
02:04:09,163 --> 02:04:11,748
The figure's not exactly
what we discussed.

1570
02:04:15,627 --> 02:04:17,171
Why not?

1571
02:04:17,379 --> 02:04:21,258
Because, after careful consideration,
I felt...

1572
02:04:22,468 --> 02:04:25,679
...that figure was not appropriate.

1573
02:04:27,306 --> 02:04:29,099
Although you may not agree...

1574
02:04:30,017 --> 02:04:31,768
...you have to trust my...

1575
02:04:32,227 --> 02:04:34,771
Trust? You want me to trust you?

1576
02:04:35,022 --> 02:04:37,774
Don't use big words
you don't understand.

1577
02:04:38,233 --> 02:04:40,944
-It's a complicated issue...
-I did a job.

1578
02:04:41,195 --> 02:04:44,364
You should reward me accordingly.
It's not complicated.

1579
02:04:44,615 --> 02:04:49,119
All you lawyers do is complicate
situations that aren't complicated.

1580
02:04:49,495 --> 02:04:52,456
Do you know why people think
lawyers are scumbags?

1581
02:04:52,664 --> 02:04:56,210
Because they are. I can't believe
you're doing this to me...

1582
02:04:56,418 --> 02:04:58,629
...when I'm up to my ass
in Kettleman plaintiffs...

1583
02:04:58,837 --> 02:05:01,381
...which looks to be
double the amount of Hinkley.

1584
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:05,928
You expect me to leave my kids
with strangers, knock on doors...

1585
02:05:06,136 --> 02:05:08,931
...get these people to trust you,
and you're screwing me!

1586
02:05:10,808 --> 02:05:13,477
I want you to know,
it's not about the number!

1587
02:05:13,727 --> 02:05:16,021
It is about the way
my work is valued.

1588
02:05:16,271 --> 02:05:18,941
No matter what I do, you're not...

1589
02:05:24,238 --> 02:05:26,031
As I was saying...

1590
02:05:26,824 --> 02:05:31,245
...I decided that the figure
you proposed...

1591
02:05:31,495 --> 02:05:33,956
...was inappropriate.

1592
02:05:34,164 --> 02:05:35,499
So I increased it.

1593
02:05:46,718 --> 02:05:50,264
Do they teach beauty queens
how to apologize?

1594
02:05:50,514 --> 02:05:53,350
Because you suck at it.

1595
