1
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:24,014
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

2
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:51,014
So tell me. How was Hawaii?

3
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:54,406
- It was unbelievable.
- Oh, yeah?

4
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:57,253
- Well, what happened?
- I met this guy.

5
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:59,719
It was the best week of my life.

6
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,861
It was just a little
vacation romance.

7
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:04,780
But he was so sweet.

8
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:07,148
He took me to all these
cool local places.

9
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,515
We went scuba diving...

10
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,980
- Snorkeling.
- Mountain climbing.

11
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:14,462
We went cliff diving.

12
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:18,685
Well, we got a little drunk.

13
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:21,052
- He gave me...
- A back rub.

14
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:22,427
We slow danced...

15
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:23,965
...in the rain.

16
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,070
But it wasn't just about the sex.

17
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:29,365
He pounded me like a mallard duck.

18
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:32,158
It ended kind of weird, though.

19
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:34,395
When I asked for his number,
he said he's...

20
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:35,833
- Married.
- Gay.

21
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,616
- Entering the priesthood.
- He doesn't believe in phones.

22
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:42,205
He just kind of ran away.

23
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,692
You know, it was just
a little fling, but...

24
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:46,132
I won't forget my week...

25
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:47,965
...with Henry Roth.

26
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:50,648
- Henry Roth.
- Harry.

27
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,310
Harry Paratesticles.

28
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:55,355
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

29
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:57,368
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

30
00:01:57,663 --> 00:02:00,761
Henry Roth, why didn't you tell me
you were a secret agent?

31
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:05,496
I prefer intelligence operative,
and I couldn't tell you until I knew you.

32
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:07,710
Well, can I call you when I land?

33
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:11,321
You can call me, but I'll be in Peru.
I said that a little loud.

34
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:14,899
Come on, that's a 187, code blue.
We got the wolf sleeping at night.

35
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:19,579
He's slipping his arm in the drawer
and out comes the cookie jar. All clear.

36
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,433
Got it?

37
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,477
Well, maybe when you
get back from Peru.

38
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:27,925
- I don't think that's an option, Lisa.
- Linda.

39
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,611
I know. I changed your name
for your protection.

40
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:35,420
We have to go our separate ways now.

41
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,972
Well, goodbye.

42
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:39,738
Got it! Moving out!

43
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:47,517
- What the hell is your problem?
- Just keep going, I'll give you $20.

44
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:51,608
- You got it. How's your balls?
- Killing me. Hit it.

45
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:07,960
Easy, Honah Lee.

46
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:11,189
Hey, I'm a person, not a seal.

47
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:16,852
Well, I am a vet, not a doctor. So just
hold still, or I won't give you a treat.

48
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,651
I know, it's okay.
You see that, kids?

49
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,684
You see what happens
when you play with sharks?

50
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:25,490
Now, why you gotta spread those lies?
Sharks are like dogs.

51
00:03:25,502 --> 00:03:28,022
They only bite when you
touch their private parts.

52
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,251
That's a good title
for my documentary.

53
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:35,157
Sharks: They Only Bite When
You Touch Their Private Parts.

54
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:39,029
Or you could call it,
Sharks: They Tried to Eat My Kidney.

55
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:42,171
All right, enough already.
You too, Willie.

56
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,196
All of you.

57
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:48,051
He just cast a spell on us.

58
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:52,284
All right. Put this on four times
a day for two weeks.

59
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:55,164
- You can handle that.
- What's wrong with that turtle?

60
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:57,945
Lung problems because
he smoked too much turtle weed...

61
00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:00,116
...which is bad for you. Right, Ula?

62
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,875
What? I don't smoke weed.

63
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:07,644
Hey, Honah Lee? How's that hot
wahine nympho from Ohio?

64
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:10,327
Great. I dropped her off
at the airport this morning.

65
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,027
Come on, I need some details.

66
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:15,094
You get some booby, some assy,
a pull on your poi-poi? Come on.

67
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,014
Daddy, what's a nympho?

68
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:21,301
Oh. The nympho
is the state bird of Ohio.

69
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:25,174
You're the state idiot of Hawaii.

70
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:28,665
Here you go. Bite the fish,
chew the fish, love the fish. Enjoy.

71
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,545
- You crack me up, kamaaina.
- Oh, yeah?

72
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:32,602
- One of these days...
- Yeah?

73
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:35,864
...you'll show one of those
tourists such a good time...

74
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:37,468
...she'll wanna stay on the island.

75
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,356
Why do you say
mean things like that...

76
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:42,290
...and why is your foot
on my pillow?

77
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:46,261
I don't want your ass on it, either.
Get up! Get up!

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,027
It could happen.

79
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,810
Then you won't be able to go
on your boat trip to Alaska.

80
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,465
You'll be stuck here, waking up next to
the same old, ugly broad, just like Ula.

81
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,665
- Just kidding, guys.
- About the old part or the ugly part?

82
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:09,748
Henry, come quickly!
It's Jocko!

83
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,551
Jocko! What's going on
with you, buddy?

84
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:21,530
Don't be scared.
Everything's gonna be fine.

85
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:23,930
Just stay calm. All right.

86
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,988
Willie, I don't need you to see this.
Get out of here, now!

87
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,802
Okay, check the temperature
of the pool. Go! Hurry!

88
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,636
What are you doing?
I meant check the thermometer!

89
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,555
Give me a hand. Let's go!

90
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,152
Get me two fish
from the barrel. Now.

91
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,656
- Okay.
- Just hang in there.

92
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,675
- Here.
- It's gonna be all right.

93
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,675
That's a little warm.
Go to the bottom of the barrel, please.

94
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,445
Okay, there. That's good. Thank you.

95
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,147
Come on, buddy, take it. Take it.

96
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,090
- He's not responding!
- I know, Alexa!

97
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,443
Sorry, I smacked you. You needed
the fish-slap to calm down.

98
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:05,307
- Do you understand? Are you calm?
- Yes. Fish-slap calm me.

99
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,641
I'm gonna try to get him
breathing manually...

100
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:11,286
...so I need your face next
to his mouth to see if it's working.

101
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,474
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

102
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,288
- One, two, three!
- Nothing, nothing!

103
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,675
All right! Try it again. If it doesn't
work we'll perform a tracheotomy.

104
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:22,805
We don't wanna do that, so let's
pray this works. One more time.

105
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,042
One, two...

106
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,026
That's a lot of vomit.

107
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:39,256
This is why I got into
this business.

108
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,427
To save sea animals.

109
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,674
You should go
wash yourself off, okay?

110
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,089
Maybe try some turpentine.
That might take the stink away.

111
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,907
Yeah, high-five is right, buddy.

112
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,063
I knew you were gonna burp,
but the vomit thing was awesome!

113
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,325
That's what she gets for eating
my roast beef sandwich.

114
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,830
Willie, did you see that?

115
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,838
Captain's log:
November 5th, 6: 45 a. m.

116
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,262
I've taken the Sea Serpent for
a trip around the island of Oahu.

117
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,241
It is by far the longest voyage
she has yet undertaken...

118
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,892
...and its completion will signal
that she's ready...

119
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,105
...for our great journey
to Bristol Bay...

120
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,488
...whose unspoiled walrus habitat
will yield an abundance of...

121
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:47,088
Damn it!

122
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,139
Are you kidding me?

123
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:09,942
Aloha, honey.
What can I get for you?

124
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:12,527
I guess I'll take a cup of coffee.

125
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:15,385
- You guess?
- Yeah, I already ate breakfast.

126
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:18,964
I need to kill some time before the
Coast Guard gets here to tow my boat.

127
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:20,469
What did you eat?

128
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:24,211
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
and some Gatorade.

129
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,440
They're not breakfast.
I get you Spam and eggs.

130
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,687
Nick, I need Spam and eggs.

131
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:31,858
Hey.

132
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:35,349
- You like the peanut butter cups?
- Yes.

133
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:37,847
Want me to put peanut butter cups
in your eggs?

134
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:40,214
No, that's okay.

135
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:42,964
Peanut butter cups.

136
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:03,221
- Hey, Sue, nice haircut.
- Mahalo, Lucy.

137
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:35,543
Are you staring at me or her?

138
00:09:35,577 --> 00:09:37,486
Because you're starting
to freak me out.

139
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:41,719
Settle down and eat your pancakes.

140
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:48,308
I think she's a local girl.
I wanted to go up to her...

141
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,669
...but I was kind of off my game.
But, man, was she cute, though.

142
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:53,839
I thought you liked your bitches
from out of state.

143
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:57,909
Yeah, that's usually my policy.
Make sure I don't get tied down.

144
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:00,439
Freeze that image right there.

145
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,661
There's the little fella.
Congratulations, Mommy.

146
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:08,916
Sounds to me like someone
is afraid of commitment.

147
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:10,583
Let me guess.

148
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:12,984
Your high school sweetheart
got drunk at party...

149
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:16,016
...then cheated on you
with whole wrestling team.

150
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:19,443
Close. Actually, it was my
college girlfriend Tracy.

151
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:22,583
And it wasn't a wrestling team.
It was her academic advisor.

152
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:26,478
- Oh, she liked the older man.
- Older women. About 50 years older.

153
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:28,529
I hope you shot the stupid tramp.

154
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,126
What's with the "tramp"
and the "bitches" talk?

155
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,704
- Are you drunk or something?
- I apologize for nasty talk.

156
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:38,325
I am grouchy due to lack
of recent physical intimacy.

157
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:42,165
Shut up, because here comes
one-time-only opportunity.

158
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:46,006
What I will do now is go into
your office and become naked.

159
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,617
Next move is up to you.

160
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:52,758
I may not be as limber
as I once was...

161
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:58,126
...but I make up for it with enthusiasm
and willingness to experiment.

162
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,391
I don't know if you realize,
I'm not into guys.

163
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:23,062
Hey, Mr. Peanut Butter Cups.

164
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:25,616
Hey, Mr. Could-Kill-Me-in-One-Punch.
How you doing?

165
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,529
- You're back.
- Couldn't get enough of that Spam.

166
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,383
Fry some up and throw
some eggs on it.

167
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,270
- You got it.
- All right, mahalo.

168
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:34,899
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi, Nick.

169
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:50,903
You know, why don't you try this?

170
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:56,303
It's kind of a hinge.

171
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:02,161
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- Well, you're too close to the project.

172
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,732
Don't be hard on yourself.

173
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:06,546
Right. Sometimes you need
an outsider's perspective.

174
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:08,434
Fresh eye never hurts.

175
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:11,826
I'm Lucy.

176
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:13,429
Yes. I'm Henry Roth.

177
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:15,251
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

178
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:18,350
It's pretty. Keep up the good work.

179
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:23,379
Wait. I see you're sitting there alone.
Do you wanna come and sit down?

180
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:28,147
- Sure, that'd be great, if that's all right.
- Okay.

181
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:34,964
- So are you an architect?
- I am not. I'm in fish.

182
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:36,981
Oh, that's where the smell
is coming from.

183
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:39,568
Yeah, yeah, I was feeding
a walrus this morning...

184
00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:43,572
...and I thought I got most of it
off of me, but guess I didn't.

185
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:46,549
- I love that smell.
- No, you don't.

186
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:49,811
- Fish don't even like that smell.
- No, I do. My dad's a fisherman.

187
00:12:49,975 --> 00:12:53,750
He and my brother Doug, they go
out to sea for months at a time.

188
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:57,677
And I miss them so much while they're
gone that when they come back...

189
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:01,364
...I just hold on to them
for five minutes each.

190
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:08,946
And they smell just like your hands.
It's the best smell in the world.

191
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:11,378
Well, my fingers are available...

192
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,192
...for your sniffing pleasure
anytime you need them.

193
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,822
- Wanna?
- Okay.

194
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:29,237
Sea lions are known
for their athleticism...

195
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:31,669
...and dolphins are known
for their intelligence.

196
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:36,021
- Walruses are known for their...
- Tusks?

197
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:41,750
Their tusks. Also their male parts
can get pretty gigantic.

198
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:46,287
Yeah, yeah, it's the second biggest
out of all the mammals.

199
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:50,410
- What's the first?
- I think Tattoo-Face.

200
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:55,887
I like your laugh.

201
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:58,101
I like you making me laugh.

202
00:13:58,134 --> 00:14:00,884
I hate to break this up,
but we're setting up for lunch.

203
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:04,014
Oh, okay. Sorry, Sue.

204
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:08,083
And the real cool thing about walruses
is they're very mysterious.

205
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,352
- Mysterious?
- Yeah, yeah.

206
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:12,980
We don't really know what
they're like in the wild.

207
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:16,112
Don't they just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time?

208
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:19,124
All we really see is what they do
outside of the water...

209
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:21,676
...but who knows what
they do under the ice...

210
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:24,338
...where they spend
two-thirds of their lives.

211
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:29,040
Well, maybe they're intimidating the
other creatures with their big winkies.

212
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:30,926
That is one theory.

213
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:34,450
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

214
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:38,159
It's my dad's birthday, and we go
every year and we pick a pineapple.

215
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:42,065
- It's a tradition.
- That sounds nice. Okay, well...

216
00:14:42,294 --> 00:14:43,723
...I had a great time.

217
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,740
- Me too.
- Okay.

218
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:50,257
Would you like to have breakfast
again tomorrow morning, same time?

219
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:52,755
- Because I teach an art class at 10.
- Really?

220
00:14:52,854 --> 00:14:54,380
- Yeah.
- I wish I could make it...

221
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:56,235
...but, yes, I will be there.

222
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,726
- Take care.
- Okay.

223
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:03,086
- One for the road. It is fishy.
- Got you good.

224
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,275
- Aloha.
- Aloha!

225
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,228
See you tomorrow.

226
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:08,846
Oh, my God.

227
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:12,141
Oh, my goodness.

228
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:23,213
Shit.

229
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,573
I had a bee on me.

230
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,169
- All right.
- He was a big one.

231
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:35,661
Which means
"look at those two shitheads. "

232
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:45,456
That was the stupidest-looking
swing I've ever seen.

233
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,889
I'm gonna take a Molokai
on that one.

234
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:50,419
No throwing. Come on.

235
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:53,485
Stop laughing, you hyenas.
Let's see what you get.

236
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,569
Okay, you heard me. Go! Go!

237
00:15:55,732 --> 00:15:57,259
Show papa what you got.

238
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,627
- You suck, you're good at everything.
- Father of the Year strikes again.

239
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:16,973
By the way, cuz, I met this sexy, blond
tax attorney at Starbucks today.

240
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:20,943
I told her you the kahuna
she wanna have fun on this island.

241
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:22,863
You want her number?

242
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,751
You pimping tourists for me again?

243
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:27,565
Yes! I live vicariously
through you, remember?

244
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:28,819
My life sucks.

245
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:31,951
Now, come on. Give her the Waikikiki
sneaky between the cheeky.

246
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:37,427
Ula needs it. I imagine I did it and then
I can get through another weekend.

247
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:39,664
I'm staying in. Sorry.
Thank you, though.

248
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:41,550
- What?
- Hey, Dad!

249
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:43,721
Not now, Keanu Mokokokakau.

250
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:45,226
But your stitches are bleeding.

251
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,262
It must've been my huge back-swing.

252
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:52,491
You think you can stitch me up
after I get back from surfing?

253
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:56,235
- Yeah, looking forward to it.
- I wouldn't surf with a wound like that.

254
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:57,521
You might attract a shark.

255
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:00,238
What's wrong with that?
Sharks are naturally peaceful.

256
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:03,401
Is that right?
How'd you get that nasty cut, anyway?

257
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:04,819
A shark bit me.

258
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:06,738
Nice.

259
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:08,713
Go smoke another one, bro.

260
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:11,277
That shark theory's
starting to catch on.

261
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:12,783
Now, will everybody keep it down...

262
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:15,881
...while I whack the crap
out of this thing?

263
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:23,179
Sit! Stay! Shit! No!

264
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:30,793
Where the hell is it?

265
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:33,138
Looking for something?

266
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,280
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

267
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,324
The same thing you are.
Looking for my ball.

268
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,840
This is weird. I've been thinking
about you all morning, all day.

269
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:52,076
Can't wait to have breakfast
with you again.

270
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,219
I know. And I just wanna eat you up.

271
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:58,547
- Really?
- Yeah. Tomorrow and the next day...

272
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,393
- ... and the next day and the next day.
- All right. Okay.

273
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:03,858
Oh, my.

274
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:07,022
Oh, Lucy, that feels so good.

275
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:11,473
No, my nipples are too sensitive.
Stop that.

276
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:18,312
- What happened?
- Your ball hooked into that cart...

277
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:22,000
...bounced back and hit you in
the head. It was freaking hilarious.

278
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:24,039
- What?
- Who's Lucy?

279
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:26,702
And what's up with your nipples?

280
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,080
I can't be falling for a local.
I ain't ever going back to that diner.

281
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,861
- This where you got hit?
- Yes!

282
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,167
You're so lucky you're a professional
cliff diver in Hawaii.

283
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:46,600
- Yeah, well, it's a living.
- I'm a tax attorney.

284
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,196
- We never get to have any fun.
- Is that right?

285
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,608
I'd like to do something
extra fun tonight.

286
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,680
Taking it deep, aren't you?

287
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,960
How about another
fishbowl for the lady?

288
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:15,312
- Why don't I just tap a keg for her?
- Okay.

289
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,737
I think I'm getting kind of drunk.

290
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,356
- Are you getting drunk?
- Getting there.

291
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,781
So, what are you thinking?

292
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,376
What am I thinking?

293
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,367
Actually, I'm not drunk at all,
Noreen, and neither are you...

294
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,726
...because there's no alcohol
in these drinks.

295
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,758
Sadly, I've used this technique
many times.

296
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,941
It helps lovely tourists,
such as yourself...

297
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:48,169
...loosen up without impairing
your ability to stay awake...

298
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,432
...and have guilt-free,
vigorous sex with me.

299
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,864
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

300
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,868
I'm not a cliff diver, either.
I'm afraid of heights.

301
00:19:57,902 --> 00:20:00,519
Well, since it's my last night in town...

302
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,095
...can I pretend you didn't just say that
and still have sex with you anyway?

303
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,290
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

304
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,261
Well, can you at least point me in
the direction of someone who can?

305
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:16,391
That guy over there
could help you out.

306
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,705
- Isn't that a woman?
- Jeez, I'm not really sure.

307
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,076
But you're too drunk to notice,
remember? Take care.

308
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,398
- Hey, you. Aloha.
- Aloha.

309
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,435
Not aloha, "hello," aloha, "goodbye. "
We're closed today. Go away.

310
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,867
- What are you talking about?
- Order up!

311
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,845
- Don't move. I have to talk to you.
- Okay.

312
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:51,562
- Hey! Tattoo-Face!
- Hey, Peanut Butter Cups!

313
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,172
Hi.

314
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:06,026
Hi.

315
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:09,453
My fingers are extra fishy today,
if you care to take a whiff.

316
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:11,819
What was that?

317
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,497
I was petting my walrus all morning
and thinking of you the whole time.

318
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:19,532
Okay, pervert.
I think that you should leave.

319
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:22,795
What? I was joking because
of what we talked about yesterday.

320
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:24,976
Yesterday?

321
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:27,855
I've never even met you.

322
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:31,336
- Nick! I need help!
- Coming, Lucy.

323
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,517
Nick, put that down.
I'll handle it.

324
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:36,812
- You, follow me.
- Wait a... What's going on?

325
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:39,114
I was kidding around with you!

326
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:43,214
What's happening here?
Is she crazy or something?

327
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:47,918
Lucy is a very special person.
Very different from other people.

328
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:49,934
Okay.

329
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:53,797
About a year ago, Lucy was
in a terrible car accident.

330
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:57,671
She and her father went up
North Shore to get a pineapple.

331
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:37,640
Her father broke some ribs, but Lucy
suffered a serious head injury.

332
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:39,976
She lost her short-term memory.

333
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:42,473
So she can't remember anything?

334
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:45,320
No, no, no, she has all of her
long-term memory.

335
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:46,924
That's a different part
of the brain.

336
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:51,081
Her whole life, up to the night before
the accident, she remembers.

337
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:54,058
She just can't retain
any new information.

338
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:58,760
It's like her slate gets wiped clean
every night while she sleeps.

339
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,251
Hold on. This sounds like something
I would tell a psycho girl...

340
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:04,455
...so she'd stop calling me.
Am I the psycho girl?

341
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:06,669
I wish I was making this up!

342
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:09,418
She has no memory
that she ever met you.

343
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:11,533
What about the
pineapple-picking thing?

344
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:13,869
She says that every day,
because each morning...

345
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:17,611
...she wakes up thinking it's
October 13th of last year.

346
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:20,971
She comes for breakfast because
that's what she did on Sundays...

347
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:22,826
...and October 13th
was a Sunday.

348
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:26,567
She has no idea
it's more than a year later.

349
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,334
She reads the newspaper.

350
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:31,182
It's a special paper her father
puts on their porch.

351
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:34,509
It's from the day of her accident.
He got hundreds of them printed.

352
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:39,495
Lucy does the same thing every day.

353
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,843
- Hello!
- Back here.

354
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:54,171
- Hi, Dad!
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

355
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:56,375
You got one without me.

356
00:23:57,215 --> 00:24:00,531
The lady at the farmers' market
gave it to me as a birthday present.

357
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:03,095
I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.

358
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:06,618
I think she likes you.

359
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:10,131
- Yeah, what's not to like?
- What about our tradition?

360
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:14,517
Well, I have another idea.
I painted my workshop yesterday.

361
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:16,698
White.

362
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,644
Now it's too white.
Gives me a headache.

363
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:22,229
Oh, yeah, you definitely
need some color in here.

364
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:25,044
Well, you know,
that's what I was thinking.

365
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:27,389
- Really?
- Yeah. Go nuts.

366
00:24:27,454 --> 00:24:30,716
- Paint me something for my birthday.
- I will.

367
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:34,523
And promise that we can pick
a pineapple for Thanksgiving, okay?

368
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:37,622
- Sounds great.
- Okay, good.

369
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:41,210
Hey, you should watch the Vikings
game while I'm painting.

370
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:43,610
Good idea.

371
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:51,411
- Yeah, baby. Isolate.
- What are we eating tonight, Doug?

372
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:54,323
- Spaghetti, Pop.
- Try not to sweat in the sauce.

373
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:56,188
Sorry, Pop.

374
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:04,403
Go Vikings.

375
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:08,538
Seven hundred and five.
Seven hundred and six.

376
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:10,937
- Seven hundred and seven.
- Hey, you guys.

377
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,141
Hey, sweetie.
How's the painting coming?

378
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:14,843
- You'll see.
- Cool.

379
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:18,040
- Oh. What's the score?
- The Vikings are on the two-yard line.

380
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:22,108
- If they score, they bring it to 14-10.
- Maybe they'll win for your birthday.

381
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,370
And I'll bet Culpepper runs it in.

382
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:29,625
I'll bet he fakes a handoff to Williams,
throws to Kleinsasser in the end zone.

383
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:32,471
- Loser does the dishes?
- You're on.

384
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,108
...keep the offense on the field.

385
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:37,020
Culpepper fakes a handoff
to Williams. He will throw.

386
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:39,901
He's got Kleinsasser in the end zone!
Touchdown, Minnesota.

387
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,755
Doug, you're good.

388
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:44,504
Maybe you should be a coach.

389
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:50,712
- Dad.
- Moron!

390
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:52,566
That hurt.

391
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:06,966
And you don't look a day over 25.

392
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:10,424
Yeah, right, and Doug's muscles
aren't pharmaceutically enhanced.

393
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,766
What? I use an herb supplement...

394
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:15,289
...that can be purchased at any
health-food store. Check this out.

395
00:26:15,453 --> 00:26:18,137
Check out these glutes.
Rock-hard, baby.

396
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,511
Pretty sweet, huh?

397
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:22,423
Stop it! You're gonna make me
throw up on the cake.

398
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:24,059
Okay, just open your present.

399
00:26:24,093 --> 00:26:26,843
Okay. Let's see what we've got here.

400
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,591
The Sixth Sense.

401
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:33,715
Hey! When I'm done doing the dishes,
do you guys wanna watch it?

402
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:35,514
- Sure.
- Sure.

403
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:38,678
Ben Friedkin?

404
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,169
Some people, they call me freak.

405
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:47,995
- Ronald Sumner?
- I am. I am a freak. Look at me.

406
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:50,362
Just give me a chance...

407
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,228
I can't believe it.
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

408
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:00,277
I'm shocked.
Did you see that coming?

409
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:01,499
- No.
- Not a clue.

410
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:04,566
- Shocked as hell.
- Anyway, it was awesome.

411
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:06,747
- Happy birthday.
- Love you, Sis.

412
00:27:06,812 --> 00:27:10,456
Your muscles are getting so big, I can
barely wrap my arms around you.

413
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:12,343
You like that?
Check this out.

414
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:21,049
Okay, okay! Enough with the titty
dance! Let your sister go to sleep.

415
00:27:21,212 --> 00:27:23,000
- I like it.
- Sweet dreams, Lucy.

416
00:27:23,132 --> 00:27:25,106
- Good night.
- Good night.

417
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:14,709
Hey, Tracy, how you doing?

418
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:15,898
Yeah?

419
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:18,801
Well, things changed a little bit
since high school.

420
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:49,848
And this is what happens
every single day.

421
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:52,433
How long it gonna take for
her memory to come back?

422
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:55,128
Her doctors say it may
never come back.

423
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:58,291
So, basically,
what you're saying is...

424
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:01,335
- ... she's perfect for you.
- What do you mean?

425
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,117
You can hang out all day with
no attachment, because...

426
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:07,226
Her plane leaves every night?
There's a problem with that.

427
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,884
- What is?
- It's evil.

428
00:29:08,918 --> 00:29:09,908
No, it isn't.

429
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:13,400
You meet her, hang out, flirt,
no commitment, nobody gets hurt.

430
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,327
- She's got brain damage, you psycho.
- Okay, I'll give you that one.

431
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:19,607
But I think it'd be healthy for you.

432
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:22,640
You haven't allowed yourself
to connect with a girl.

433
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:25,040
I appreciate your interest,
but leave me alone.

434
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,439
Hey, you'd be doing exactly
what her father does:

435
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,686
Giving her a wonderful day.

436
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,778
When it's time for you to go on your
big boat trip, poof, you just leave.

437
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:35,861
She'll never even know you're gone.

438
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:39,320
I'm not sure about the "poofing" part,
because I'm not a good poofer.

439
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,857
Demonstrate a good poof for me?

440
00:29:40,891 --> 00:29:43,444
Quit busting my coconuts
for five seconds.

441
00:29:43,771 --> 00:29:47,032
All right. Would you stop poofing
on that joint and do some work?

442
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:51,255
Okay. Let's get this sucker ready.

443
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:54,233
Then we're gonna take her
out for a spin.

444
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,576
Captain's log: November 7th.
Nearly midnight.

445
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,195
The Sea Serpent is fully
recovered from her mishap...

446
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,425
...and ready to once again
brave the open ocean.

447
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,421
I think my stitches
opened up again, cuz.

448
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,749
You got a cat?
Because I feel something licking me.

449
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,977
How is it?

450
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,595
Peanut Butter Cups.
What are you doing here?

451
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:30,679
I just wanted to say hi to Lucy.

452
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,934
I promise you I'm not gonna
do anything wrong.

453
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:36,307
What did Sue say?

454
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,952
She said that if I talk to Lucy,
you'll kill me with a meat cleaver.

455
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:42,799
She's the boss, cuz.
But don't worry.

456
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:45,144
Lucy probably didn't wanna
talk to you anyway.

457
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,016
- What does that mean?
- This ain't a disco.

458
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,865
She doesn't want guys hitting on her
during her breakfast.

459
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:53,816
She does if it's Henry Roth.

460
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,475
- Who that?
- Who that? Me that.

461
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,567
I bet you 20 bucks I can get her
to have breakfast with me again.

462
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:04,376
- You're on.
- I love it.

463
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,112
- How you doing, honey?
- Hey, Sue. Nice haircut.

464
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,992
Oh, mahalo.
See you in a bit.

465
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,984
Nick and I have an arrangement.
You can trust me.

466
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:18,231
Don't worry.

467
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:41,783
You should try this out.
Put it in there.

468
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:43,922
Swivelly door.

469
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,550
Waffleonians can
come in and out now.

470
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,675
Are you from a country where it's
okay to stick your fingers...

471
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,016
...all over someone else's food?

472
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,508
No, I'm from this country.

473
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:58,070
Why? Were you gonna eat that? Oh.

474
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,340
All right, well, have a good meal.

475
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:07,473
- Yeah.
- That was pathetic.

476
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:09,743
Yeah? Why don't you choke
on your Spam?

477
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:12,023
Double or nothing tomorrow.

478
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:21,493
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you...

479
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:24,438
...but you look like a person
who appreciates fine art...

480
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,226
...so I wanted your opinion.

481
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:32,685
I drew this. It's a picture of a father
and son fishing off a fishing boat.

482
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:34,321
There's a walrus right there...

483
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:42,350
Oh, you don't speak English. Okay.

484
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,630
Doesn't look Chinese.

485
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:49,648
Forty.

486
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:52,757
Can I have that?

487
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,605
I need something
to wipe my ass with.

488
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:57,045
Shut up.

489
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,062
I wonder what's the matter with him.

490
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:26,029
Looks like a stupid asshole to me.

491
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:35,215
Excuse me. Okay.
I didn't mean to startle you.

492
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,070
- No, that's all right. I...
- Are you okay?

493
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:40,211
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm having
a problem with something...

494
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,196
Something that I could help you with?

495
00:33:42,327 --> 00:33:44,051
No, no, no. I just...

496
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:47,062
...can't read.

497
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:49,974
You gotta be kidding me.

498
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:51,949
- I can read that for you.
- No. Thank you.

499
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:54,098
I can do this on my own.

500
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:56,214
Appreciate the sentiment.

501
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:58,735
I'm gonna get an order of the...

502
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:10,287
Pan...

503
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:12,240
Pan...

504
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:15,746
Panku...

505
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,007
Ca...

506
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:18,861
Panclocks.

507
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,840
- Pancakes.
- Okay, I'll have pancake.

508
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,436
- Pancakes.
- Pancah... Pancakes! Pancakes!

509
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:27,059
- I'm so stupid!
- Oh, don't cry.

510
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,553
- Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
- Don't cry.

511
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:32,498
- I don't know anything!
- What a loser.

512
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:38,290
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you sit with me?

513
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:41,869
You can have some breakfast and
I'll help teach you some of the words.

514
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:44,050
- Okay.
- All right.

515
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:46,069
- That sounds nice.
- Come on over.

516
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,109
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

517
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:57,043
So I comes before the E?

518
00:34:57,206 --> 00:34:59,410
- Except after C?
- Yes.

519
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:02,290
Okay, and C is that little
half a squiggly one, right?

520
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:04,527
- Yes.
- I think I'm getting it.

521
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:08,235
- How'd you get so good at teaching?
- I'm a teacher. I do it all the time.

522
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:10,930
I'm an art teacher at
the Haluki-liki Junior High.

523
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:15,021
Well, you Haluki-liki the kind of
teacher all the kids have crushes on.

524
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,835
I know I would if I was in your class.

525
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,962
Okay.

526
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:25,646
Oh, boy, do my...
My fingers smell like fish.

527
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:27,762
That doesn't gross you out, does it?

528
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,617
No, not at all.

529
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:31,602
Really?

530
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,068
If Lucy gets hurt, I'm gonna chop you
with the meat cleaver.

531
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,573
Okay, okay.

532
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:41,966
So I had a nice time.

533
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:44,355
- Yeah, me too.
- Thank you very much.

534
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:46,384
- Let me get it for you.
- Thank you.

535
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:48,140
Sure.

536
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:50,290
Okay.

537
00:35:56,726 --> 00:36:01,515
I just want to eat you up, tomorrow
and the next day, next day, next day...

538
00:36:02,966 --> 00:36:04,821
I'll see you around.

539
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:06,511
Okay.

540
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:11,540
Really? That's it?

541
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:15,184
- That's what?
- All that flirting...

542
00:36:15,446 --> 00:36:18,762
...and phony "I can't read" stuff,
and you're not gonna ask me out...

543
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:20,082
...or for my phone number?

544
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,450
- I can't read.
- Oh, shut up.

545
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:25,842
That was one of the goofiest things
I've ever seen, but I thought:

546
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:28,723
"Hey, if this guy is so desperate
to meet me...

547
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,155
...he might be worth talking to. "

548
00:36:31,285 --> 00:36:33,009
But then I get stiffed.

549
00:36:33,205 --> 00:36:35,278
No, no, no,
this is what happened. I...

550
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:38,322
Mahalo for the ego boost.

551
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:41,453
- You're right. You're right. I feel like...
- No worries.

552
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:43,787
I gotta...
I can read a little!

553
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:47,562
I didn't know I came before E!
That one I didn't know, I swear.

554
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,361
Oh, you idiot.

555
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:51,597
I hope you're happy, Shamu.

556
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:57,227
Marlin. It's Sue.

557
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:13,199
- Oh, aloha, sir. My name's Henry...
- I know who you are.

558
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:17,812
- I want to apologize to your daughter.
- Not gonna happen.

559
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:20,234
She's inside.
We're gonna straighten things out.

560
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:23,408
Dad, the damn mongoose
got in the garbage again!

561
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:27,434
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

562
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:30,096
Mr. Roth, I have one simple request:

563
00:37:30,325 --> 00:37:31,885
Stay away from my daughter.

564
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:35,660
Absolutely. I hurt her feelings
and don't want it to end like that.

565
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:36,848
It's gonna end like this.

566
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,434
Calm down, little fellow.

567
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:43,023
I'm gonna kill you! You're a dead man.
Okay, I'm calm.

568
00:37:43,284 --> 00:37:44,811
I'm calm.

569
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:47,441
- Let me help you up.
- I got it! I got it.

570
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:51,915
It's just Dad and I work too hard
to protect Lucy to let some idiot ruin it.

571
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:54,291
I know what you guys do
and I totally respect that.

572
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:57,903
If you know her condition, you know
she can't have a normal relationship.

573
00:37:58,165 --> 00:38:00,204
The next morning,
she won't know who he is.

574
00:38:00,564 --> 00:38:02,571
And any guy who's okay with that...

575
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:03,913
...ain't okay with me.

576
00:38:04,404 --> 00:38:08,201
- I'm not looking for a one-night stand.
- Anything with Lucy is, numb-nuts.

577
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,757
Give us a break.
Just stay away from the Hukilau Cafe.

578
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,452
My daughter's been through enough.

579
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:17,517
Okay. I'm sorry.

580
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:25,230
I could have whooped his ass,
but this gravel, I slipped on it...

581
00:38:25,524 --> 00:38:28,306
Yeah, well, maybe you need to do
a few more butt flexes.

582
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:30,291
Cheap shot, Dad.

583
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:32,691
So fresh and so clean.

584
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:35,691
Hey, Alexa, did you hook up
with that girl from the bar?

585
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:37,970
- I chickened out.
- Really?

586
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:40,873
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess I prefer sausage to taco.

587
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:44,898
- What?
- Yeah. No, I agree, buddy.

588
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:47,473
Get out of here.
Run for the hills.

589
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:50,287
Let me ask you something, Alexa.

590
00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:53,353
If you promised a girl's dad
that you wouldn't see her...

591
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:55,567
...would you consider that
a binding promise?

592
00:38:55,764 --> 00:38:57,170
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

593
00:38:57,203 --> 00:38:59,789
Then again, there are always ways
around such things.

594
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,774
- Like?
- For example...

595
00:39:02,003 --> 00:39:06,095
...if I promised a woman's father
I would not see her...

596
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:10,033
...I would simply shut my eyes
while she serviced my manhood.

597
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:14,091
That's actually a cool way to look at it.

598
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:15,727
And a very gross way.

599
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:34,098
He asked me not to go to the Hukilau.
I'm not going there.

600
00:39:34,643 --> 00:39:36,137
I'm not doing anything wrong.

601
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:44,908
Sorry to bother you.
I'm kind of stuck here.

602
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:49,010
- Car trouble?
- Yeah. You mind giving me a jump?

603
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:50,897
Okay.

604
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:52,556
Appreciate your time.

605
00:39:52,883 --> 00:39:54,508
Not everybody would have stopped.

606
00:39:54,803 --> 00:39:56,745
- You're real sweet.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

607
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,871
I can't believe you fell for that.

608
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:08,810
Well, my grandfather died
trying to jump-start a car.

609
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:15,912
I'm sorry.
I was just joking around.

610
00:40:15,922 --> 00:40:19,184
I can't believe you fell for that!

611
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,908
Oh, my God.

612
00:40:21,203 --> 00:40:22,609
That was very good.

613
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:24,715
- My name's Henry.
- I'm Lucy.

614
00:40:25,043 --> 00:40:27,083
Nice to meet you.
You look like a nice...

615
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:35,919
Hi. Sorry for the delay.
Should be a few minutes.

616
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:38,449
- No problem. No worries.
- Where you coming from?

617
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:40,522
Breakfast?

618
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:42,256
- Yeah.
- How was it?

619
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,046
I had waffles. They were delicious.

620
00:40:44,243 --> 00:40:46,512
I like making little houses
out of waffles.

621
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,799
- You do?
- That's my thing.

622
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:54,191
- What's your name?
- Lucy.

623
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:55,598
Hi, I'm Henry.

624
00:40:55,762 --> 00:40:58,632
Okay, pal. When she stops,
just let her pet you. Look cute.

625
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:02,155
Go to the middle of the road.
Thank you. Right there. Perfect.

626
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:10,992
- Oh, shit.
- Here she comes. Smile.

627
00:41:14,002 --> 00:41:15,464
Where is she?

628
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:20,591
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

629
00:41:22,642 --> 00:41:24,431
Okay. That didn't work.

630
00:41:24,562 --> 00:41:27,312
Shit your pants? So did I.

631
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:34,609
Okay, this is her.
Start beating me up.

632
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:36,234
Make it look good.

633
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,002
Give me your wallet!

634
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:44,329
Okay, haole, what do you think?
You can come to this island...

635
00:41:44,722 --> 00:41:47,504
- ... eat our pineapple...
- Help me! Not so hard.

636
00:41:47,602 --> 00:41:49,647
- Take it easy.
- Try to bang our women.

637
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,693
Making my sister
clean your hotel room.

638
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:54,125
Okay. What's that have to do
with this? Relax.

639
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:56,711
- Hey! Hey! Help me, please!
- Stupid haole!

640
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,747
Yeah, that's right. Take that!
And that! And that!

641
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:02,448
And that! And that!

642
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,652
You got him. You got him.
Enough. Enough.

643
00:42:04,882 --> 00:42:06,125
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes...

644
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:07,750
Okay, I'll be back.
Come here!

645
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:09,801
No, no! I think he's had enough.

646
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,136
I'm sorry.

647
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:15,180
My eye!

648
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,540
- You got him!
- Not good enough!

649
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:19,727
Oh, Kamehameha!

650
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:21,736
He learned his lesson!

651
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:24,136
- What's your name?
- My name's Henry.

652
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:26,317
- You did good.
- Hi. Sorry.

653
00:42:26,481 --> 00:42:28,139
I'm in a community-watch program...

654
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:30,206
Oh, you crazy bitch!

655
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:32,012
Yeah, keep running!

656
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:34,542
Okay, okay, he's... He's gone now.

657
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:42,637
Not her. False alarm.

658
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:49,608
Don't worry, I called the cops already.
I'm all set.

659
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:52,008
Yeah? You all set for this, Mr. Smarty?

660
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:56,656
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

661
00:42:56,721 --> 00:43:00,103
When you're finished playing your
kidnap-victim crap on my daughter...

662
00:43:00,137 --> 00:43:01,258
...come by the house.

663
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:03,528
Okay.

664
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,582
Oh, boy.

665
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:21,451
There's something I wanna show you.

666
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,248
We figured it out. She only sings
on days she meets you.

667
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,527
You're kidding me. That song?

668
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,934
That's Mom and Dad's song.

669
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,902
When her mom was alive,
Lucy would have me take that tape...

670
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,678
- ... on every fishing trip I went on.
- Oh, yeah?

671
00:43:43,711 --> 00:43:45,997
Yeah, she knew it would make me
miss her mom...

672
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,851
...and want to come home sooner.

673
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,073
I'm seeing a new side to you, sir.
I gotta tell you, it's grossing me out.

674
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,116
Let me ask you something.

675
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,379
What's in it for you?
What do you get out of this?

676
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,357
I don't know.

677
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,741
Wouldn't you want to spend
an hour a day with that?

678
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:11,437
Actually, no. She sings like shit.

679
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,446
- What?
- Can I ask you guys something?

680
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,197
What'll happen down the line?
Someday she'll wake up...

681
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,426
...look in the mirror and notice
she aged 10 years overnight.

682
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:22,606
You know something, Henry?

683
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:25,323
I worry about that
every damn day of my life.

684
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,748
Pardon me.

685
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,727
Sorry to interrupt, but I noticed we
were both eating alone...

686
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,436
...and I thought I could sit with you,
maybe build a syrup Jacuzzi...

687
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,578
- ... for your waffle house?
- Oh, that would be nice...

688
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,043
...but I have a boyfriend.

689
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,182
So I'm sorry.

690
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,349
You're making up a boyfriend
to get rid of me?

691
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,821
No, I'm not.

692
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:53,927
What's his name, then?

693
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,050
Ringo.

694
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,254
Is his last name Starr?

695
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:00,549
- No. McCartney.
- McCartney, okay.

696
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:02,795
- Oh, no.
- All right. I'm sorry.

697
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:05,261
No! This cop is writing me a ticket!

698
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,748
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I wouldn't go out there.

699
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:09,100
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Go on!

700
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:10,508
I'm coming.

701
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:12,548
The tags don't expire
for seven months.

702
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:15,242
- They expired May of this year.
- No! No, no!

703
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:16,846
They expire May of next year.

704
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,268
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

705
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:20,937
- I don't.
- This is ridiculous.

706
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,337
I'm not paying for this!
It's October!

707
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,966
Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
Look, October!

708
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:27,787
Lucy, let's go back inside.

709
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:30,537
What?

710
00:45:39,919 --> 00:45:41,348
What?

711
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,639
Having a bad day, Doug!

712
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:31,049
Sweetheart...

713
00:46:31,758 --> 00:46:33,449
...these are from the accident.

714
00:46:49,998 --> 00:46:52,616
Oh, no!

715
00:46:59,598 --> 00:47:01,900
I can feel it.

716
00:47:03,917 --> 00:47:07,300
You were in the hospital
for three months, sweetheart.

717
00:47:19,758 --> 00:47:23,784
I have to talk to this doctor.
I need to hear it from him.

718
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:25,987
You have heard it, sweetie.
Many times.

719
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:29,259
I have?

720
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:32,291
I'll take her.

721
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:36,230
I have to hear for myself too.

722
00:47:46,637 --> 00:47:48,742
Doug, just take this, okay?
I can't...

723
00:47:48,776 --> 00:47:51,110
I can't look at it anymore.

724
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:55,397
- It's gonna be all right, Luce.
- Don't call me Luce. I barely know you.

725
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:57,895
Sweetie, you're sort of dating him.

726
00:47:59,117 --> 00:48:01,386
Sorry I'm not better-looking.

727
00:48:03,437 --> 00:48:05,957
What else happened
since last October?

728
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:09,961
- What about my students?
- Miss Campbell took over your class.

729
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,372
- Did Alicia marry that guy?
- Yeah.

730
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,706
Doug, did you win
the Mr. Hawaii contest?

731
00:48:17,836 --> 00:48:20,040
I didn't know there was gonna be
a urine test.

732
00:48:20,716 --> 00:48:21,894
Wow.

733
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:24,426
Do we have sex?

734
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:29,706
No, we don't.
Just so everybody knows that.

735
00:48:30,797 --> 00:48:31,975
We want to.

736
00:48:33,196 --> 00:48:34,822
Just kidding.

737
00:48:38,477 --> 00:48:42,022
So you guys have to just lie
to me every day.

738
00:48:55,276 --> 00:48:57,316
Hey, Lucy.
Good to see you again.

739
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:02,083
What the hell's her problem?

740
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:04,898
She doesn't remember
who you are, brah.

741
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:06,665
Oh, yeah.

742
00:49:06,796 --> 00:49:09,447
I suck at this job.

743
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:12,971
Lucy, these are your
brain scans here.

744
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:15,190
I'm afraid they show
no improvement.

745
00:49:15,224 --> 00:49:17,345
The temporal lobe
was severely damaged.

746
00:49:17,836 --> 00:49:20,683
What we believe is scar tissue
here is impairing your ability...

747
00:49:20,716 --> 00:49:24,229
...to convert short-term memory into
long-term memory while you sleep.

748
00:49:24,556 --> 00:49:27,207
The condition's come to be known
as Goldfield Syndrome.

749
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:30,502
- Who's Goldfield?
- A brilliant Lithuanian psychiatrist.

750
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:32,682
He himself suffered
temporal-lobe damage.

751
00:49:32,716 --> 00:49:34,723
Took him four years
to publish his findings...

752
00:49:35,116 --> 00:49:37,669
...because he had to keep
starting over from scratch.

753
00:49:37,996 --> 00:49:41,225
Obviously, your sense of humor
is still intact, and that's here.

754
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:43,046
Magnificent amygdala as well.

755
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:46,058
- Doctor, I have a question.
- I'd be happy to answer it...

756
00:49:46,155 --> 00:49:50,378
...but as I've told you before, this is a
hygienic facility. Shirts are required.

757
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:51,850
- Oh, okay.
- Nice move.

758
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:55,461
Listen, doctor, this...

759
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:59,236
...friend of mine's been experimenting
a little with steroids.

760
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:00,904
He's been having a lot
of wet dreams.

761
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:03,457
Could there be a connection
between them?

762
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:05,191
Douglas, get off the juice.

763
00:50:05,355 --> 00:50:08,257
As for the nocturnal emissions,
why don't you take a swim...

764
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:12,425
...buy a shirt with no holes,
find a wahine and take her to dinner.

765
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:14,661
I'll tell my friend you said so.

766
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:18,054
In any case, Lucy,
your condition is stable...

767
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:19,842
...but most likely permanent.

768
00:50:20,235 --> 00:50:22,090
I'm so sorry, dear.

769
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:23,781
But it could be worse.

770
00:50:25,515 --> 00:50:26,824
Yeah? How?

771
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:29,672
I think you should meet
Ten Second Tom.

772
00:50:29,755 --> 00:50:33,333
Callahan Institute is the leading
brain-injury clinic in the Pacific Rim.

773
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:36,807
We are funded out of Sandusky, Ohio
by T.B. Callahan...

774
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:40,166
...the automotive-components tycoon
and philanthropist.

775
00:50:44,715 --> 00:50:47,136
And now, I would like
to introduce to you...

776
00:50:47,595 --> 00:50:50,312
...our most distinguished
clinical subject...

777
00:50:50,475 --> 00:50:51,816
...Tom.

778
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,442
- Hi. I'm Tom.
- Henry.

779
00:50:53,475 --> 00:50:54,532
- Marlin.
- Doug.

780
00:50:54,795 --> 00:50:55,973
- Lucy.
- Hi.

781
00:50:56,235 --> 00:50:58,307
Cool flip-flops.
Where'd you get them?

782
00:50:58,635 --> 00:51:01,537
You like those? It's interesting.
I was on the North Shore...

783
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:02,693
Hi, I'm Tom.

784
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,322
- Henry.
- Hi.

785
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:07,264
- Marlin.
- Tom lost part of his brain...

786
00:51:07,754 --> 00:51:10,340
...in a hunting accident.
His memory lasts 10 seconds.

787
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,041
I was in an accident? That's terrible.

788
00:51:12,075 --> 00:51:14,115
Don't worry.
You'll get over it in seconds.

789
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:17,791
Get over it? I mean, what happened?
Did I get shot in the brain...?

790
00:51:17,835 --> 00:51:19,973
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

791
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:21,445
- Hi.
- Doug.

792
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:22,852
- Hey.
- Marlin.

793
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:25,536
Hey, Tom, can I tell you a secret?

794
00:51:27,914 --> 00:51:30,849
Don't you think you're a little old
to still have wet dreams?

795
00:51:34,155 --> 00:51:36,872
- They liked that.
- Hi, I'm Tom.

796
00:51:37,035 --> 00:51:39,271
- Yeah, watch yourself, Tom.
- Easy.

797
00:51:52,874 --> 00:51:55,176
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- All right. Good night.

798
00:51:55,274 --> 00:51:57,762
Good night, you guys.
I'll see you tomorrow.

799
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:02,082
- And I guess I'll see you too?
- Oh, yeah.

800
00:52:02,474 --> 00:52:04,448
You had a rough day today.
I'm sorry.

801
00:52:04,482 --> 00:52:06,499
I hope you get some rest tonight.

802
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:08,681
Okay.

803
00:52:08,714 --> 00:52:10,121
Good night.

804
00:52:10,634 --> 00:52:11,844
So how you getting home?

805
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:14,081
- You gonna take the Likelike or...
- Hey.

806
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:19,012
Thank you for being
so nice to me today.

807
00:52:19,274 --> 00:52:21,729
- Sure.
- I don't want you to...

808
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,299
...strike out tomorrow.

809
00:52:23,593 --> 00:52:25,382
So maybe you could talk
to me about...

810
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:27,204
...lilies.

811
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:28,611
Lilies?

812
00:52:28,874 --> 00:52:30,532
I'm a sucker for lilies.

813
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:32,354
Thanks for the tip.

814
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:35,430
Good night.

815
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:37,960
My, oh, my.

816
00:52:37,993 --> 00:52:39,903
- Lover-boy.
- Yes, sir.

817
00:52:40,394 --> 00:52:42,499
You don't have to rush off.
Stick around.

818
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:45,160
You've earned yourself
a couple beers.

819
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:48,673
So what'll you do when
you finish the boat?

820
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,342
Actually, I'm going on a trip soon...

821
00:52:50,473 --> 00:52:52,775
...to study undersea
Pacific walrus behaviors.

822
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:54,150
Sounds kind of fruity.

823
00:52:54,313 --> 00:52:56,452
- Thank you.
- How long is it gonna take?

824
00:52:56,714 --> 00:52:57,891
About a year.

825
00:52:58,153 --> 00:52:59,909
Guess you won't miss days like this.

826
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:03,139
Well, maybe days like this
don't have to be so bad.

827
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,189
What are you trying to say?

828
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:07,623
When you guys tell her...

829
00:53:07,753 --> 00:53:10,551
...she's not just finding out
about the accident.

830
00:53:10,585 --> 00:53:13,350
She's finding out that her life
is basically a setup.

831
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:15,400
I think that freaks her out the most.

832
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:16,775
- You're an expert now?
- No.

833
00:53:17,353 --> 00:53:19,687
I'm saying I wish there was
another way besides:

834
00:53:19,753 --> 00:53:23,299
"Sorry we couldn't trick you today.
Here's pictures of your broken head. "

835
00:53:23,593 --> 00:53:25,862
- You want a broken head?
- You'll give him one?

836
00:53:25,993 --> 00:53:28,065
No, Daddy, I thought
you was gonna do it.

837
00:53:28,393 --> 00:53:31,044
Nobody's gotta break my head.
I'm gonna split anyways.

838
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:33,639
Oh, don't go just because
my son is psychotic.

839
00:53:33,673 --> 00:53:36,836
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Keep them dry there, Doug.

840
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:39,236
Very funny.

841
00:53:59,592 --> 00:54:02,145
- Excuse me. Lucy Whitmore?
- Yes?

842
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:04,294
I have a delivery for you.

843
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:06,945
- A delivery for me?
- Yes.

844
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:11,396
Oh, they're beautiful.

845
00:54:12,072 --> 00:54:14,374
- Who are they from?
- That I can't tell you.

846
00:54:14,473 --> 00:54:17,953
It's a secret admirer.
He also wants you to have this.

847
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:21,509
- Who's your friend, Lucy?
- Oh, well, I mean, I don't know.

848
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:23,876
We just met, but look.

849
00:54:24,072 --> 00:54:25,828
I have a secret admirer.

850
00:54:25,992 --> 00:54:28,513
Oh, really? What's this?

851
00:54:28,872 --> 00:54:30,301
It's a videotape.

852
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:32,199
A videotape of what?

853
00:54:32,232 --> 00:54:34,304
I have no idea.

854
00:54:34,632 --> 00:54:36,356
But I have to find out.

855
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:38,941
Happy birthday, Daddy.

856
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:41,854
- Thank you, sweetie.
- That's right. Happy birthday, sir.

857
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:43,687
- What are you, 200 today?
- That's cute.

858
00:54:44,232 --> 00:54:47,134
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to try something different.

859
00:54:47,168 --> 00:54:49,446
If it doesn't work,
we've only wasted one day.

860
00:55:08,232 --> 00:55:09,923
Martha Stewart faced charges...

861
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:13,893
Oh, God!

862
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:54,496
Okay, I think it's on. Go. Go.

863
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:56,863
Aloha! I'm Henry Roth.

864
00:55:57,191 --> 00:56:02,942
We met here at the Hukilau Cafe
about a year after your accident.

865
00:56:02,951 --> 00:56:05,853
I like you and you like me, most days.

866
00:56:06,311 --> 00:56:09,442
Every day is different, but basically
this is what happens, Lucy.

867
00:56:09,671 --> 00:56:11,045
Kikikoloko, take the camera.

868
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:12,321
- I got it.
- Don't drop it.

869
00:56:12,551 --> 00:56:14,493
Okay, all right.
Here we are, right here.

870
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:17,187
The part of you in this reenactment...

871
00:56:17,221 --> 00:56:19,424
...will be played
by my good friend, Ula.

872
00:56:20,231 --> 00:56:22,686
Aloha. Sorry about your brain.

873
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:24,932
I had a accident too.

874
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:27,813
Believe it or not, this my good eye.

875
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,568
- We ready?
- Yeah.

876
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:33,376
Hi. I like that waffle teepee
that you have built.

877
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:37,413
Oh! So nice of you to notice.
Please, sit down.

878
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:39,398
I would love to.

879
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:41,984
My name is Henry, by the way.

880
00:56:42,017 --> 00:56:43,652
My name is Lucy.

881
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,692
Smell my fingers?

882
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:48,605
Fish. Right on.

883
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,900
So, Lucy, I work at an aquarium.

884
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,757
Aquariums make me super horny.

885
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:57,344
That's not funny.
Don't rub those.

886
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:59,580
Sorry, Mr. Whitmore,
if you're watching.

887
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:01,565
It's very late,
and my friend's unstable.

888
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,576
Come on, stop with the licking!
You're making me sick.

889
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:05,852
Lucy, I'm sorry.

890
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:10,653
Anyways, I know you wish I was
making all this stuff up.

891
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:12,702
I wish I was too.

892
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,396
But the good news is...

893
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,502
...so many people out there
care about you:

894
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,343
Your dad and Doug and a couple
of your friends here at the Hukilau...

895
00:57:21,377 --> 00:57:22,783
...who have a message for you.

896
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,885
Lucy, as you know,
your mother and I were best friends.

897
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,804
That's why I promised her that
I would always help look after you.

898
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,517
Sometimes life isn't very fair...

899
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,971
...but we still have you.

900
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:45,092
Oh, and if you're wondering about
this guy who's making this tape...

901
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,190
...he's okay.

902
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:52,063
Hey, Lucy. Just so you know,
since you lost your memory...

903
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:54,975
...I became governor of Hawaii.

904
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,539
No, just kidding. I'm too smart.

905
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:03,364
Kualaliku! Get your brother
off the dishwasher!

906
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:07,291
So whenever you're ready,
we'd all love to talk to you...

907
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:09,124
...and answer any questions
you have...

908
00:58:09,189 --> 00:58:11,906
...and you're the best, Lucy. Aloha.

909
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,891
How many times
have I watched this?

910
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:30,756
This is the first time.

911
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:38,306
Okay, she cried for about an hour.
That's not too bad.

912
00:58:38,469 --> 00:58:41,917
I bet in another hour she'll be ready
to see her friends, have lunch...

913
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:43,487
...get her life back.

914
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:45,604
We could do this every day.

915
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:49,695
We'll leave it up to her.

916
00:58:49,989 --> 00:58:51,451
All right.

917
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:56,894
So how's the cow?

918
00:58:57,189 --> 00:59:00,287
Same as you. Every day they
have to convince her she's a cow.

919
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:07,454
Wow, look. The bark is healing.

920
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:09,244
You're gonna get there.

921
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:12,221
I never hung out with you
in the afternoon like this.

922
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,915
In this lighting, man, oh, man,
you look...

923
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:16,989
...disgusting.

924
00:59:17,348 --> 00:59:18,941
Yeah.

925
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:23,905
I don't know how you get me to fall for
that egg-shaped head every morning.

926
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:26,883
All I have to do is slide on
my designer jeans...

927
00:59:26,948 --> 00:59:30,331
...and just kind of wiggle
in front of you. You go nuts.

928
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:35,261
Why couldn't I have met you one day
before the accident?

929
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:39,069
Don't worry, because if you hung out
with me for more than one day...

930
00:59:39,428 --> 00:59:41,315
...you'd realize I'm a bore.

931
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:43,453
- Oh, well, I have news for you.
- Yes?

932
00:59:43,749 --> 00:59:45,603
It takes less than one day.

933
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,578
You know something?
That hurt.

934
00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:50,371
Your damaged temporal lobe
is causing me pain...

935
00:59:50,948 --> 00:59:52,704
...and I'm gonna get you for that.

936
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:55,683
Now you're dead!

937
01:00:13,508 --> 01:00:16,542
- I can't believe you're pregnant.
- I know.

938
01:00:16,868 --> 01:00:19,770
- And I got her on the first try.
- Yeah. Easy.

939
01:00:19,803 --> 01:00:21,471
And, Tammy, you are so thin.

940
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:22,944
Thanks, Luce.

941
01:00:23,108 --> 01:00:24,831
And I'm so glad you finally got...

942
01:00:25,028 --> 01:00:28,094
...that gender-reassignment surgery,
Jennifer. I mean, Jonathan.

943
01:00:28,388 --> 01:00:29,981
Mahalo.

944
01:00:30,788 --> 01:00:32,250
- Here you go, Lucy.
- Thank you.

945
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:34,594
- You're welcome.
- You must be Lucy's friend.

946
01:00:34,628 --> 01:00:37,977
- The one who made the tape.
- I think he's more than my friend.

947
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,354
- You're my boyfriend, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

948
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:42,973
So every day you help her
to realize what happened...

949
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:45,919
...and you wait patiently for her
to be okay with it...

950
01:00:46,148 --> 01:00:48,122
...then get her to fall in love
with you again?

951
01:00:48,547 --> 01:00:49,758
Yes, ma'am.

952
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:52,125
You asshole!

953
01:00:52,387 --> 01:00:55,322
You don't even open the fricking car
door for me anymore.

954
01:00:56,227 --> 01:00:57,536
You're in trouble.

955
01:00:58,628 --> 01:01:00,188
I gotta go tinkle.

956
01:01:04,388 --> 01:01:07,737
Okay, so tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

957
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,722
Okay. Well, I've...

958
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:13,214
...won over seven all-you-can-eat
chicken-wing contests.

959
01:01:13,247 --> 01:01:15,067
- Really?
- Yes.

960
01:01:15,427 --> 01:01:18,329
And I'm a ballet dancer,
but only in my bathroom.

961
01:01:18,787 --> 01:01:21,122
No, what do you want to know?

962
01:01:22,627 --> 01:01:24,122
Do you love me?

963
01:01:27,427 --> 01:01:29,216
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

964
01:01:29,347 --> 01:01:31,998
I was just asking more for
informational purposes.

965
01:01:32,227 --> 01:01:34,464
It's to keep the video as up-to-date
as possible.

966
01:01:34,627 --> 01:01:36,220
Sure.

967
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:40,802
Well, love is a very loaded word.

968
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:45,176
Let's see. I...

969
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:50,752
I go to this restaurant every morning,
and I see you there, reading.

970
01:01:51,427 --> 01:01:53,216
And...

971
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:57,689
I love you very much.

972
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,147
Probably more than anybody could
love another person.

973
01:02:04,867 --> 01:02:07,387
And how do I feel about you?

974
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:10,593
You're excited about
the chicken-wing thing.

975
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:12,830
And...

976
01:02:13,026 --> 01:02:16,092
...you've been dying to make out
with me for some time now.

977
01:02:27,426 --> 01:02:28,855
Feeling better now?

978
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:31,583
Nothing beats a first kiss.

979
01:02:38,946 --> 01:02:41,946
There's nothing like a first kiss.

980
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,466
Nothing beats a first kiss.

981
01:03:05,826 --> 01:03:07,898
That's what I've heard.

982
01:03:12,546 --> 01:03:14,585
Nothing beats a first...

983
01:03:25,506 --> 01:03:26,716
What are you doing?

984
01:03:26,945 --> 01:03:29,334
Nothing. I was just getting
some lint off for you.

985
01:03:29,346 --> 01:03:31,233
You were going for a feelski!

986
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:35,968
All right, I'm sorry, but this is like the
23rd time we've made out already...

987
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:37,974
...and they're getting blue.

988
01:03:38,465 --> 01:03:40,832
I know. I know.

989
01:03:40,866 --> 01:03:43,648
I mean, I really don't know.

990
01:03:43,746 --> 01:03:46,560
For me, it still feels like the first time.

991
01:03:46,626 --> 01:03:48,251
Okay, let's average it out then.

992
01:03:48,546 --> 01:03:51,360
It's the 23rd time for me
and the first time for you.

993
01:03:51,426 --> 01:03:53,662
- That's about our 12th time.
- Yeah?

994
01:03:53,825 --> 01:03:56,672
Now, Hawaiian law clearly states
after the 12th date...

995
01:03:57,185 --> 01:04:00,284
...I'm entitled to unlimited
boob access.

996
01:04:01,025 --> 01:04:05,149
Why didn't I meet you one day
before the accident?

997
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:08,574
You say that all the time.

998
01:04:08,705 --> 01:04:10,593
You want to meet a friend of mine?

999
01:04:14,465 --> 01:04:15,959
All right.

1000
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:20,443
Jocko, this is Lucy.
Lucy, this is Jocko.

1001
01:04:20,705 --> 01:04:24,087
Wow! Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1002
01:04:25,025 --> 01:04:27,447
He is awesome! He is so smart.

1003
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:31,964
Check this out. Jocko, what does
the teapot do when the water's ready?

1004
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:36,927
- Very good.
- Can I ask him a question?

1005
01:04:37,025 --> 01:04:38,519
Go ahead.

1006
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:40,537
Jocko...

1007
01:04:40,864 --> 01:04:44,410
...do you think that Henry and I
are ready to take our relationship...

1008
01:04:44,444 --> 01:04:45,948
...to the next level?

1009
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:49,275
You sure about that?

1010
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:52,603
Do you think I should bring him
into the other room...

1011
01:04:52,865 --> 01:04:55,199
...and take advantage of him?

1012
01:05:01,024 --> 01:05:02,748
I saw that hand gesture.

1013
01:05:02,944 --> 01:05:04,832
- And I'm glad you did it.
- Really?

1014
01:05:16,865 --> 01:05:18,752
- Use that.
- Oh, wow. Look!

1015
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:19,962
- Yeah.
- They're...

1016
01:05:20,224 --> 01:05:22,558
They're nodding in approval, I hope.

1017
01:05:22,624 --> 01:05:24,893
They like you. Let me get them
out of there.

1018
01:05:25,024 --> 01:05:28,013
Mary-Kate, Ashley, get a life.
Thank you. Sorry.

1019
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:31,003
- Oh, they're very nice, though.
- Yeah, so are you.

1020
01:05:31,264 --> 01:05:33,304
Let me get you down slow.

1021
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:35,998
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1022
01:05:57,664 --> 01:06:00,959
All right, I just wrote this,
so go easy on me.

1023
01:06:01,984 --> 01:06:05,464
The Hukilau was the place

1024
01:06:06,784 --> 01:06:09,118
Where I first saw your face

1025
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:13,624
We liked each other right away

1026
01:06:15,424 --> 01:06:19,385
But you didn't remember me
The very next day

1027
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:24,030
Forgetful Lucy

1028
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:27,479
Has got a nice caboose-y

1029
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:32,890
I used to trick you into pulling
Your car over so we could chat

1030
01:06:33,183 --> 01:06:37,373
But my favorite time was when you
Beat the shit out of Ula with a bat

1031
01:06:37,983 --> 01:06:41,278
And we drove up to see Dr. Keats

1032
01:06:41,823 --> 01:06:45,052
And found out why Doug always
Has to change his sheets

1033
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:50,429
Forgetful Lucy

1034
01:06:50,463 --> 01:06:54,773
Cracked her head like Gary Busey

1035
01:06:55,263 --> 01:06:57,914
But I still love her so

1036
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:02,234
And I'll never let her go

1037
01:07:03,423 --> 01:07:07,035
Even if while I'm singing this song

1038
01:07:07,743 --> 01:07:10,907
She's wishing I had
Jocko the Walrus' schlong

1039
01:07:12,543 --> 01:07:16,765
Forgetful Lucy

1040
01:07:17,343 --> 01:07:21,466
Her lips are so damn juicy

1041
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,590
How about another first kiss

1042
01:07:35,582 --> 01:07:37,622
Can't fall asleep.

1043
01:07:37,983 --> 01:07:39,870
I'm not sleeping.

1044
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,586
I'm just closing my eyes.

1045
01:07:42,783 --> 01:07:44,921
Well, I'm gonna go downstairs then.

1046
01:07:45,182 --> 01:07:49,208
No, no. I'm just resting.

1047
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:52,469
Lucy.

1048
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:54,269
Yeah.

1049
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:56,212
Will you marry me?

1050
01:08:03,422 --> 01:08:06,651
- Of course.
- Good.

1051
01:08:07,262 --> 01:08:09,750
Don't forget about me.

1052
01:08:10,622 --> 01:08:12,411
Never.

1053
01:08:28,862 --> 01:08:30,236
Good morning.

1054
01:08:36,542 --> 01:08:37,720
Oh, shit!

1055
01:08:37,982 --> 01:08:40,054
- Help! Help!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lucy.

1056
01:08:40,088 --> 01:08:42,618
Lucy! Lucy! Hey, hey, hey.

1057
01:08:42,782 --> 01:08:44,920
I know this is hard for you
to understand...

1058
01:08:45,182 --> 01:08:47,418
...but we are actually
seeing each other.

1059
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:49,337
We have been for a while now.

1060
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:50,679
Oh! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

1061
01:08:50,942 --> 01:08:53,014
If I was lying,
how would I know this?

1062
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:56,375
You're an art teacher and you go
to the Hukilau every Sunday...

1063
01:08:56,702 --> 01:09:00,117
...and you make waffle houses
and you like Casablanca lilies.

1064
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:03,290
- Stalker!
- No, don't you remember me a little?

1065
01:09:10,142 --> 01:09:12,760
I may not be able to kick your ass,
but my sister can.

1066
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:14,232
Thanks, buddy.

1067
01:09:14,461 --> 01:09:17,112
Little Sammy Sosa's a bit shook up,
but she'll be okay.

1068
01:09:17,341 --> 01:09:19,097
She's watching the tape as we speak.

1069
01:09:19,261 --> 01:09:21,147
How's my temporal lobe
looking there, doc?

1070
01:09:21,181 --> 01:09:24,443
Don't worry. You're not gonna suffer
any short-term memory loss.

1071
01:09:25,021 --> 01:09:27,836
But was your head shaped like an egg
before she hit you?

1072
01:09:27,901 --> 01:09:31,097
Don't make fun of Henry.
It's not his fault it's shaped like that.

1073
01:09:31,261 --> 01:09:34,490
Note the intense overreaction.
That's the "roids" talking.

1074
01:09:34,621 --> 01:09:38,166
- Doug, once again, off the juice.
- It's not juice.

1075
01:09:38,461 --> 01:09:40,217
It's a protein shake.

1076
01:09:40,381 --> 01:09:44,058
Henry, the boys tell me you're setting
sail for Alaska to study walruses.

1077
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,904
- When does that adventure begin?
- That actually began...

1078
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:50,963
...ten years ago. That's when I started
planning and building my boat.

1079
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:55,382
All I know is, out of all mammals,
they have the second-largest penis.

1080
01:09:56,701 --> 01:09:58,195
I have the first.

1081
01:10:00,061 --> 01:10:01,338
That's my joke.

1082
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:03,224
Did you tell Lucy about this trip?

1083
01:10:03,901 --> 01:10:05,308
Well...

1084
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,050
...actually, there's nothing to tell
because I decided not to go.

1085
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,904
I mean, Lucy needs me here.

1086
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,166
I'm just worried about
going away for a year...

1087
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:16,665
...and ruining all the progress
she's made.

1088
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,289
I know you think I'm crazy...

1089
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,992
...but I think deep down inside...

1090
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:23,570
- ... she's starting to remember me.
- No, Henry.

1091
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:26,995
That's what you want to believe.
It's what we all want to believe.

1092
01:10:27,901 --> 01:10:29,308
But it's never gonna happen.

1093
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,220
Okay. I gotta go to work.

1094
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,826
Will you tell her I'll be back later
to pick her up?

1095
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:41,592
See you, guys. Don't tell anyone
your sister beat me up.

1096
01:10:42,301 --> 01:10:45,879
He could go to the moon and back and
Lucy would never even know he left.

1097
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:49,174
Sometimes I wish my wife
had Goldfield Syndrome.

1098
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,347
That way she wouldn't remember
when I called her mother...

1099
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:56,984
...a loud, obnoxious drunk with a face
like J. Edgar Hoover's ass.

1100
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,100
All right. There's your medicine,
little fellow.

1101
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,046
Ula! Get back to cleaning the pool!

1102
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:09,301
If that's one of your special brownies,
don't let any of the dolphins eat that.

1103
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:12,955
How do you think I get them to
double flip and play with white kids?

1104
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,656
Okay, Willie, that's it.

1105
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,308
This time try to stay clean
for more than a day.

1106
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,805
I made you a nice anchovy sundae.

1107
01:11:22,839 --> 01:11:24,409
Okay, enjoy that.

1108
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,426
Henry?

1109
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:29,078
- Hey!
- How's your head?

1110
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,373
- Oh, it's fine. Don't worry.
- Good.

1111
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:34,641
What brings your royal cuteness
out here?

1112
01:11:34,675 --> 01:11:35,961
I needed to see you.

1113
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:37,968
Okay. What you got there?

1114
01:11:38,459 --> 01:11:41,012
It's my journal. I write in it every night.

1115
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:43,990
- Oh, you don't like the video?
- No, I love it.

1116
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:48,409
It's just sometimes when I watch it,
I feel like I'm being told about my life...

1117
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,907
...from someone else.
And when I read this...

1118
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:53,557
...it's like I'm telling myself.

1119
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:55,281
When did you start this up?

1120
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:57,594
Right after you gave me the video.

1121
01:11:57,659 --> 01:11:59,896
- Really?
- I was so nervous to come here...

1122
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,256
...and meet the guy that makes me
fall in love with him every day.

1123
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,834
Well, you probably thought
I couldn't live up to the hype.

1124
01:12:06,868 --> 01:12:10,325
No. I was nervous because...

1125
01:12:12,539 --> 01:12:14,711
Because I came here
to break up with you.

1126
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:19,705
You had plans and a life...

1127
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:22,357
...before you met me
and now all you have time for...

1128
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:24,823
...is to make me fall in love with you.

1129
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:27,834
That's not all I do.
I gave a penguin a bath today.

1130
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,634
Which I'll have to do again tomorrow.

1131
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:37,139
I look at my dad and my brother's
lives and I won't do that to you.

1132
01:12:37,499 --> 01:12:41,689
What do you want me to do? Be some
chapter in your scrapbook and go?

1133
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:43,225
No.

1134
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:50,384
My plan is to erase you completely,
so it's as if you never existed.

1135
01:12:52,378 --> 01:12:54,418
Why are you doing this?

1136
01:12:55,258 --> 01:12:59,350
Because you have to understand
that there is no future with me.

1137
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:04,467
Don't you want to have a career
and marriage and children?

1138
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:06,963
I asked you to marry me. You said yes.

1139
01:13:06,997 --> 01:13:08,534
Kids? Yeah, I'd love to do it.

1140
01:13:09,658 --> 01:13:12,408
But how is that going to work?

1141
01:13:12,538 --> 01:13:16,629
I'm gonna wake up every morning with
an enormous belly and no memory...

1142
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,102
...of how it happened?

1143
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:23,000
I have to make a new journal
that doesn't have you in it.

1144
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:24,821
But before I do...

1145
01:13:25,018 --> 01:13:27,636
...I really want you to read
what I wrote about you.

1146
01:13:27,898 --> 01:13:29,687
I will read about it tomorrow...

1147
01:13:29,818 --> 01:13:32,785
...when you forget about all this
breaking up stuff, okay?

1148
01:13:33,178 --> 01:13:36,440
I'm not going to forget it.
I wrote it down. I won't let myself.

1149
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:39,385
And I'm gonna do it whether
you want me to or not.

1150
01:13:39,898 --> 01:13:42,102
I'll be at my house.

1151
01:13:49,978 --> 01:13:52,083
Okay, type this one in there.

1152
01:13:52,378 --> 01:13:54,069
Saturday, November 25th.

1153
01:13:54,298 --> 01:13:58,902
I drove out to Callahan Institute today
and had a talk with Dr. Keats.

1154
01:13:59,578 --> 01:14:01,301
There's one about me.

1155
01:14:01,498 --> 01:14:05,524
Reminder: He makes funny noises
when I kiss his neck.

1156
01:14:06,778 --> 01:14:08,184
I'm gonna miss that.

1157
01:14:08,218 --> 01:14:10,323
You sure you don't want me
to put that in?

1158
01:14:18,777 --> 01:14:20,664
- We can skip that one.
- No, let me read it.

1159
01:14:20,697 --> 01:14:24,789
We made love tonight! It didn't
last long, but it was incredible.

1160
01:14:27,417 --> 01:14:31,640
It's not all about how long you go. It's...
There was a connection, I thought.

1161
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,835
Actually, let's just rip that out.

1162
01:14:56,697 --> 01:14:58,966
Well, that's that.

1163
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:08,239
Henry, wait!

1164
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:16,847
Could I have one last first kiss?

1165
01:16:25,976 --> 01:16:29,359
- I ain't gonna do this, Marlin.
- You have to, Henry.

1166
01:17:01,496 --> 01:17:04,463
I'm gonna miss you, but I gotta
get the hell off this island.

1167
01:17:04,497 --> 01:17:05,837
I'm sorry I can't take you...

1168
01:17:06,296 --> 01:17:10,158
...but you've lived here so long you're
too big of a pansy to defend yourself.

1169
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:15,121
I don't feel bad for you. I know you
got a thing going on with Candace.

1170
01:17:18,776 --> 01:17:20,183
Candace and Bernice?

1171
01:17:22,616 --> 01:17:24,404
Candace, Bernice and Rose?

1172
01:17:26,456 --> 01:17:29,936
Yeah. I fell for one chick and I'm losing
my mind. Good luck with that.

1173
01:17:30,296 --> 01:17:31,637
Okay, baby.

1174
01:17:31,735 --> 01:17:33,328
I love you.

1175
01:17:33,655 --> 01:17:36,022
Thanks, buddy.
Remember to use a condom.

1176
01:17:36,535 --> 01:17:38,444
Or in your case, a Hefty bag.

1177
01:17:48,535 --> 01:17:49,910
Well...

1178
01:17:49,975 --> 01:17:52,942
Okay, you guys. Thanks for coming
to say goodbye.

1179
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,961
Be careful.

1180
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:58,070
You make sure your father doesn't
get eaten by a shark.

1181
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:07,189
Thank you, buddy.
What does that mean again?

1182
01:18:07,735 --> 01:18:09,458
Bring me back a T-shirt.

1183
01:18:09,655 --> 01:18:11,892
Oh, okay. You got it.

1184
01:18:12,535 --> 01:18:14,640
Come here. All right. Love you guys.

1185
01:18:15,415 --> 01:18:18,230
My shirt size is medium husky.

1186
01:18:20,215 --> 01:18:22,419
Hey! Kikikuloa!

1187
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:25,298
No flippies off the dock!
You could get hurt!

1188
01:18:27,895 --> 01:18:32,564
No! All right. Let the master
show you how to get it done.

1189
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,855
Now you kids go down there
and find my nuts.

1190
01:18:44,215 --> 01:18:45,971
Sure you don't want to take Doug?

1191
01:18:46,135 --> 01:18:49,615
Hey! What the heck
are you guys doing here?

1192
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:54,350
I spoke to the harbormaster and he
said you were setting sail today...

1193
01:18:54,383 --> 01:18:56,433
...so we thought we'd wish
you bon voyage.

1194
01:18:56,694 --> 01:18:59,564
This is from Nick and Sue.
They send their best wishes.

1195
01:19:00,054 --> 01:19:03,731
That's very nice.
Spam and Reese's. All right.

1196
01:19:03,894 --> 01:19:06,196
I love Spam and Reese's.
Can I have it?

1197
01:19:06,294 --> 01:19:07,821
I guess.

1198
01:19:08,694 --> 01:19:10,701
- Doug!
- That's all right.

1199
01:19:10,735 --> 01:19:13,516
- I'm sorry.
- So...

1200
01:19:14,454 --> 01:19:15,664
...how's Lucy?

1201
01:19:16,374 --> 01:19:18,992
Actually, she's living at the institute.

1202
01:19:19,734 --> 01:19:22,963
- When did that happen?
- Three weeks ago.

1203
01:19:23,574 --> 01:19:27,152
Said she didn't want to be a burden to
me and Doug anymore. I don't know.

1204
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:29,781
I couldn't talk her out of it.
You know what?

1205
01:19:29,814 --> 01:19:31,919
She's doing really great up there.

1206
01:19:32,214 --> 01:19:35,149
She's teaching an art class
and she gets to paint every day.

1207
01:19:35,574 --> 01:19:37,330
In fact, she's even singing again.

1208
01:19:37,493 --> 01:19:39,599
Hey, look, I got a little gift
for you too.

1209
01:19:39,894 --> 01:19:43,538
It's just a little something
from one sailor to another one.

1210
01:19:45,173 --> 01:19:47,028
You take care of yourself out there.

1211
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,908
- I will.
- Okay.

1212
01:19:58,134 --> 01:19:59,988
Henry did not tell me about you.

1213
01:20:00,054 --> 01:20:02,541
Your fisherman muscles.

1214
01:20:03,413 --> 01:20:04,623
Can I touch?

1215
01:20:04,854 --> 01:20:06,610
Sure.

1216
01:20:12,053 --> 01:20:13,908
Yes.

1217
01:20:21,173 --> 01:20:22,417
The Beach Boys?

1218
01:20:22,613 --> 01:20:25,362
How nice of him to give me a CD
that will remind me...

1219
01:20:25,973 --> 01:20:29,290
...of all the wonderful times
I shared with his daughter.

1220
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:31,635
What an asshole!

1221
01:20:49,493 --> 01:20:51,435
Oh, why?

1222
01:20:51,893 --> 01:20:54,130
Why would you do this to me?

1223
01:20:54,293 --> 01:20:56,714
You sick bastard!

1224
01:21:01,012 --> 01:21:02,507
Oh, my God.

1225
01:21:03,413 --> 01:21:05,268
Is he trying to tell me something?

1226
01:21:09,652 --> 01:21:11,987
She only sings on days
she meets you.

1227
01:21:13,973 --> 01:21:15,860
She remembers me?

1228
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,899
Holy shit!

1229
01:21:19,252 --> 01:21:21,903
She remembers me!

1230
01:21:26,932 --> 01:21:28,771
Julia, that looks great.

1231
01:21:28,804 --> 01:21:30,609
Excuse me. What am I doing?

1232
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:34,384
You're painting a picture.
And you're doing an excellent job.

1233
01:21:34,612 --> 01:21:36,172
Oh.

1234
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:40,394
Holy crap! I suck.

1235
01:21:48,532 --> 01:21:50,158
Hey, hey, hey.

1236
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:53,169
- Can we help you, sir?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

1237
01:21:53,332 --> 01:21:55,667
- What's your name?
- My name?

1238
01:21:58,132 --> 01:22:01,198
Dude, he forgot his name.
I feel bad for him.

1239
01:22:01,492 --> 01:22:04,274
Just go on up. And good luck
with that memory problem.

1240
01:22:04,372 --> 01:22:06,281
Yeah. Thank you.

1241
01:22:08,212 --> 01:22:09,456
What?

1242
01:22:10,132 --> 01:22:12,139
Lucy!

1243
01:22:12,532 --> 01:22:14,158
Lucy!

1244
01:22:14,452 --> 01:22:16,993
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hey, I met you before. I'm Henry.

1245
01:22:17,027 --> 01:22:19,535
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for Lucy Whitmore.

1246
01:22:19,732 --> 01:22:21,193
Any idea where I can find her?

1247
01:22:21,651 --> 01:22:22,578
Hi, I'm Tom.

1248
01:22:22,611 --> 01:22:25,459
Oh. Thanks anyways.

1249
01:22:26,451 --> 01:22:28,240
Lucy!

1250
01:22:28,852 --> 01:22:30,259
Lucy!

1251
01:22:34,131 --> 01:22:35,822
Lucy Whitmore...

1252
01:22:37,011 --> 01:22:38,800
...can I ask you a question?

1253
01:22:41,811 --> 01:22:43,916
Do you have any idea who I am?

1254
01:22:49,972 --> 01:22:53,005
- No.
- No?

1255
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:56,233
That sucks.

1256
01:22:57,652 --> 01:23:00,521
- What's your name?
- I'm Henry.

1257
01:23:01,011 --> 01:23:02,702
Henry.

1258
01:23:03,891 --> 01:23:06,641
I want to show you something.
Will you come with me?

1259
01:23:07,251 --> 01:23:08,593
Well, yeah.

1260
01:23:10,131 --> 01:23:11,986
Hey. Do you know who that guy is?

1261
01:23:12,051 --> 01:23:14,124
Dude, I don't even know who I am.

1262
01:23:14,451 --> 01:23:16,622
Oh, well, you're Pablo Picasso.

1263
01:23:16,851 --> 01:23:20,397
- Really?
- No. Not really.

1264
01:23:23,571 --> 01:23:26,124
This is my studio.

1265
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:47,244
I don't know who you are, Henry...

1266
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:52,785
...but I dream about you
almost every night.

1267
01:23:55,251 --> 01:23:56,712
Why?

1268
01:23:57,171 --> 01:24:01,065
What would you say if I told you
that notebook you read every day...

1269
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:04,392
...used to have a lot of stuff
about me in it?

1270
01:24:05,811 --> 01:24:08,298
I would say that that
makes a lot of sense.

1271
01:24:08,691 --> 01:24:10,414
You erased me
from your memories...

1272
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:13,644
...because you thought you were
holding me back from having...

1273
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:15,628
...a full and happy life.

1274
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:18,279
But you made a mistake.

1275
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:22,250
Being with you is the only way
I could have a full and happy life.

1276
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:25,262
You're the girl of my dreams...

1277
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:29,102
...and apparently I'm the man of yours.

1278
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:35,341
Henry.

1279
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,912
It's nice to meet you.

1280
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:40,360
Lucy, it's nice to meet you too.

1281
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:46,577
Hi, I'm Tom.

1282
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:48,682
Henry, Lucy. Nice to meet you, Tom.

1283
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:52,490
Now why don't you come back in
ten seconds so we can meet again?

1284
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:39,497
Do you, Honah Lee, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

1285
01:25:39,531 --> 01:25:41,678
...to have and to hold
from this day forth...

1286
01:25:42,289 --> 01:25:44,296
...as long as you both shall live?

1287
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:46,096
- I do.
- Really?

1288
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:48,715
Even though in, like, 10, 15 years...

1289
01:25:49,009 --> 01:25:51,594
...she could possibly let herself
go and then, like...

1290
01:25:51,628 --> 01:25:53,678
...sex could be, like,
nauseating for you?

1291
01:25:53,809 --> 01:25:56,394
What are you, nuts?
Your wife's right over there.

1292
01:25:58,609 --> 01:26:00,267
I'm just kidding, Muumuu!

1293
01:26:00,529 --> 01:26:03,278
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1294
01:26:08,209 --> 01:26:10,576
Mazel tov!

1295
01:26:11,569 --> 01:26:13,576
It's very cold, so when you're ready...

1296
01:26:13,969 --> 01:26:17,449
...put on a jacket and come have
breakfast with me. Love you.

1297
01:26:48,049 --> 01:26:52,937
Hey, hey! Good morning, Mrs. Roth.
Would you like to meet your daughter?

1298
01:26:53,328 --> 01:26:54,538
Go say hello to Mommy.

1299
01:26:56,208 --> 01:26:57,801
Hi, Mommy.

1300
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,958
That's right.

1301
01:27:03,409 --> 01:27:04,969
Good morning.

1302
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:08,840
Oh, my goodness!

1303
01:27:09,648 --> 01:27:11,884
- Grandpa's here.
- Hi, Dad.

1304
01:27:13,648 --> 01:27:19,884
