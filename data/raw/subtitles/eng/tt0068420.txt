1
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:31,505
Darling...

2
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,049
go and play, make yourself a friend.

3
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:18,467
We are but older children, dear,
who fret to find bedtime near.

4
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:25,917
Antoine Cardot.

5
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,902
Our brothers
in New York were clumsy, Tony.

6
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:33,414
The long road ends here.

7
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,028
Look, I'm not a pilot,

8
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:40,647
I'm just a book seller.

9
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,410
It was an accident, it was proved in court.

10
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:45,337
We have our own courts, Tony.

11
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:46,857
Come on, be brave.

12
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:48,881
Don't make me do it here!

13
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,529
No, you won't be needing those.

14
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:56,098
Are you a doctor?

15
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:58,435
No.

16
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:02,331
You're always trying
to be smarter than everybody else?

17
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:04,508
Dubargin's dead...

18
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,031
Do you hear me?

19
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:09,004
Dubargin's committed suicide.

20
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,014
Easy... let me help you.

21
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,925
No, God, no...

22
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,678
My wallet... in my pocket.

23
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,767
Open the envelope.

24
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:26,511
Take it!

25
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,056
Buy yourself a good time!

26
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:38,441
Stop!

27
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,322
Come down,

28
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:43,473
and make it fast.

29
00:10:55,764 --> 00:10:56,860
I didn't take it, he gave it to me.

30
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:03,981
You're mistaken, I didn't kill him.

31
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:04,881
He didn't kill him.

32
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:06,833
Save the
explanations for later, come on!

33
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:39,148
It's better like that!

34
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:41,938
You are not the police?

35
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:43,836
What's he saying?

36
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:45,182
He wants me to choke him.

37
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:47,817
Not before Charley sees him.

38
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:12,573
Out!

39
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:20,124
Paul, Paul!

40
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:29,284
Help him, come on!

41
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:34,318
Leave me alone!

42
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:35,401
No...

43
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:38,929
It's Charley who decides.

44
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,266
Come on.

45
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:30,119
Paul!

46
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:38,833
Leave me alone.

47
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:51,827
Plenty of ducks here.

48
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:57,982
This time I'll be chasing ducks.

49
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:58,983
A little Frenchman, aren't you...

50
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,338
Plenty of ducks...

51
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,405
We got Renner...

52
00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:41,706
Who's that?

53
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:43,812
A witness.

54
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,540
Charley won't be happy!

55
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:52,470
Come on, you're not gonna die.

56
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:54,606
Ten bucks says I am.

57
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,395
I've got him.

58
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:23,924
Who is he?

59
00:15:24,845 --> 00:15:25,917
Someone about to die.

60
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:31,157
Well... can he have a coffee first?

61
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:53,472
What happened to Paul?

62
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,201
Hey, she's talking to ya!

63
00:15:57,577 --> 00:15:58,809
What happened to Paul?

64
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,058
He stepped out of a moving car.

65
00:16:16,836 --> 00:16:18,060
You are Charley?

66
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:38,533
This opens what?

67
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,088
My room.

68
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:41,094
Where is your room?

69
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:41,868
In Paris.

70
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:42,937
Where in Paris?

71
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:44,015
Rue Notre-Dame des Champs.

72
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,591
Charley knows Paris.

73
00:16:47,114 --> 00:16:48,137
No.

74
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:50,686
I'm going to see Paul.

75
00:16:58,235 --> 00:16:59,187
Where is the money?

76
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:01,500
What money?

77
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,390
Did Renner give you this empty wallet?

78
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:06,796
Who is Renner?

79
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,350
Let me have him, Charley.

80
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,138
No, he's got our piggy bank.

81
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:13,382
Just a little tap!

82
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:14,709
I said no!

83
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:16,663
What were you doing in that balloon?

84
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,780
Dreaming I was somewhere else.

85
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,347
Is that here?

86
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:37,978
Did the cops follow you?

87
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:41,075
We didn't see any cops,
we just heard the sirens.

88
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:41,963
You, keep an eye on him!

89
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:51,468
A moral dilemma:

90
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,533
Is it OK to beat the prisoner?

91
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,011
Charley already answered you.

92
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:06,581
Right!

93
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,393
What did Charley say?

94
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:23,507
You got a sweet little face.

95
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,132
I bet the ladies like it!

96
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:29,234
That's not fair!

97
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,531
Where is Charley's money?

98
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:46,304
You're pushing your luck, Froggy.

99
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,362
What's that mean, Froggy?

100
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:49,972
Means you eat frogs.

101
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,233
That's how we call Frenchmen here.

102
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,480
I told you to leave him alone.

103
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:57,481
He started it!

104
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:59,044
That's not true!

105
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,502
He was a good heavyweight once.

106
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:13,550
What's up outside?

107
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,165
Pepper, running up some food.

108
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:25,947
I'm hungry.

109
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,042
How do you like this guy?

110
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:54,273
My name is Sugar.

111
00:19:58,168 --> 00:19:59,008
It's good, eh?

112
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:01,529
I've had 4 husbands,

113
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,553
and they all loved to eat.

114
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:12,860
Do you still have the fourth?

115
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:18,261
I don't know...

116
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:23,007
Last time I saw him I poked
his left jaw with a silver mirror.

117
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,173
No... the right.

118
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:27,327
Is that why they call you Sugar?

119
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:31,217
O no, it's because of my pies.

120
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,282
The big brute... is Matonne.

121
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:39,550
And the guy
who brought you here is Rizzio.

122
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:43,202
And you?

123
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:46,068
Froggy.

124
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:54,275
When did you get to Montreal?

125
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,620
This morning.

126
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,773
Who's after you?

127
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,942
No one...

128
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:14,255
Come on, Charley told me.

129
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,863
Charley's never wrong.

130
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:22,888
The police.

131
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:27,339
What for?

132
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,590
A holdup.

133
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:31,468
That's hardly a reason
to come all this way.

134
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:33,956
I killed a cop.

135
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:44,071
Charley!

136
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:50,119
That's Paul's.

137
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:53,872
That's Renner's.

138
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:56,368
Everybody's got a right to his arms!

139
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:02,178
You'll have one
when you want to kill yourself.

140
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,546
Arms first.

141
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:13,132
Tell him, Froggy.

142
00:22:22,518 --> 00:22:24,622
I was saying that I killed a cop.

143
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:26,603
In France, during a holdup.

144
00:22:27,154 --> 00:22:28,744
Him, a holdup? He's lying.

145
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:33,372
We need to get rid of him right away.

146
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,608
We're listening.

147
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,185
I took a freight ship.

148
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:42,433
Yesterday I was in New York,
but the police spotted me.

149
00:22:42,615 --> 00:22:43,638
He's lying!

150
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:47,709
I jumped on a train for Montreal,

151
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:52,159
but the police
were waiting for me, here too.

152
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:53,453
That's a lie!

153
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:00,024
They even fired a few shots.

154
00:23:17,716 --> 00:23:19,126
Rizzio, give me a cigarette.

155
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:32,198
Take out the handcuffs.

156
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,622
That's all I can do for you, Froggy.

157
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,860
On the other side
of the island there's a bridge.

158
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:18,172
2 miles after the bridge
you find the main road.

159
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,264
Good luck.

160
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,408
I can go... just like that?

161
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:38,681
Why not? You're one of us.

162
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,133
You're cool, Froggy.

163
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:46,089
Not like him, you give him
10 bucks he wouldn't come back.

164
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,567
If somebody can explain why he came back...

165
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:51,887
it's not wasted money.

166
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:54,081
He came back because he likes my pie.

167
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,062
Perhaps he saw me following him.

168
00:26:01,785 --> 00:26:04,893
I believe what he says,
he simply needs to hide.

169
00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:08,915
My money, Froggy?

170
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,451
My 15,000 dollar.

171
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:24,292
If you don't know where it is,
you were wrong coming back, Froggy.

172
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,718
I know where it is,

173
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:30,838
but I'd like
to put myself in your place.

174
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,839
Conclusion?

175
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:38,474
As long as I won't say anything,
you won't do anything.

176
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,075
I'm too valuable.

177
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:49,579
You're bluffing.

178
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,484
You don't know anything.

179
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:56,935
500 dollar bills, brand new,
in 3 wads, their paper bands still on.

180
00:26:57,941 --> 00:26:59,799
There are ways to make you talk!

181
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:00,817
Right.

182
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:02,412
Try.

183
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,750
Put these back on him.

184
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:36,332
My grandpa, in Michigan

185
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:40,875
He would press
his weekly pay with an iron.

186
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:50,325
It was me who put the embers.

187
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:54,474
One thing you forgot, Froggy.

188
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,058
I got all the time in the world.

189
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:00,556
I don't need that money right away.

190
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:05,075
It'll be a lot longer
for you than for me.

191
00:28:05,272 --> 00:28:06,415
He's gonna stay here?

192
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:11,356
The 10 bucks he lost,
that pays for his room.

193
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:15,276
Where will he sleep?
There are no more beds.

194
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:19,308
There's the iron bed in the barn.

195
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,422
But that's a kid's bed.

196
00:28:22,253 --> 00:28:23,476
For 10 bucks he can't expect the Ritz.

197
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,125
In Paris,
Charley slept at the Ritz for nothing!

198
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:30,786
If the cooking is
what I think it is, it'll be fine.

199
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,052
You know something,
I like him more and more!

200
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,619
Me, I don't like him!

201
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:39,795
I don't like you either.

202
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:43,772
It's been 10 years I don't like you.

203
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:55,557
Go and look in the canoe.

204
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,847
If the money's not there,
go look at the pier.

205
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:07,575
Like I'm to go after nothing.

206
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,566
He knows it already!

207
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,824
He must be having a good laugh inside!

208
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,914
Make an effort, little one.

209
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,705
Charlie...
Yes. Listen.

210
00:29:31,484 --> 00:29:33,235
I have to find that money back.

211
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:37,292
To pay for equipment, you understand?

212
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:42,260
Thanks to Renner Charley,
I'm not afraid.

213
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:45,814
Paul.

214
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,387
Charley.

215
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:20,042
Charley's right,
he'll never make it back.

216
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,997
I carved those myself.

217
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,492
That's worth a fortune to a collector.

218
00:30:49,173 --> 00:30:49,980
Hear that, Charley?

219
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:55,165
Rizzio is an artist.

220
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,062
He also paints.

221
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:04,358
OK, I'll go there.

222
00:31:09,004 --> 00:31:10,098
You are cool, Froggy.

223
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:13,712
First Sugar, then Rizzio, you are fast.

224
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:19,522
It's a beautiful view from this room.

225
00:31:27,188 --> 00:31:29,661
Which part
of the landscape do you like best?

226
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:36,842
Over there, by the bench.

227
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:43,587
OK. If by tomorrow morning
you haven't given back my marbles,

228
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:48,547
that's where we dig your grave.

229
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:59,278
In this famous
exposition dome the body was found.

230
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:05,197
Julius Renner, 48, was a guard
at the theatre at the Place des Arcs.

231
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,660
He must have been killed by a burglar.

232
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:13,534
We can only lament the rise in crime
in our city over the last 10 years.

233
00:32:14,061 --> 00:32:17,021
It might be settling of scores,
the investigation will tell.

234
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:20,671
End of the news alert.

235
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,498
Renner learned the hard way,

236
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,941
you should never trust a cop.

237
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:31,697
An ex-cop.

238
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:33,633
Makes no difference.

239
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:38,809
Instead of doing the job with us
he goes off with the money.

240
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:42,317
Which job?

241
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,191
Did you ask something?

242
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:55,192
He doesn't need to know.

243
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,822
Nono, why do you speak.

244
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:08,635
Listen Charley, it's not my fault
if I didn't find the money!

245
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:10,748
I've searched everywhere!

246
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,797
It's good, right?

247
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:25,791
Well I think it's pretty good.

248
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,194
Evening Pepper!

249
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,857
She's Paul's sister.

250
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:54,144
Meet Froggy, Pepper.

251
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:10,740
She takes her name too seriously,
don't pay attention to her.

252
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,020
You'd better pay attention!

253
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:17,069
She's got a gun.

254
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:19,589
She's got a gun so she can hunt.

255
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,138
When she finds out
who touched her big brother,

256
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:25,147
then we'll find out what she hunts.

257
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:33,980
I'll roast it
for dinner tomorrow, with mushrooms.

258
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,078
He's not going to die, is he?

259
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,287
Of course not.

260
00:34:51,928 --> 00:34:53,335
He needs a doctor.

261
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:56,893
You know we can't.

262
00:34:58,006 --> 00:34:59,110
We used to have our own doctor.

263
00:35:00,462 --> 00:35:01,789
That used to be, Pepper.

264
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:09,102
Who did this?

265
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:14,176
Renner.

266
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:16,736
And Renner is dead.

267
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,460
How about a game of gin rummy?

268
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:52,679
2 cents a point.

269
00:35:57,984 --> 00:35:59,927
You want to play
with them or with us, Froggy?

270
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:13,243
25 dollars for my watch, Rizzio.

271
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,614
It's not working!

272
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,158
Nothing ever works with the French,

273
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:24,799
except having kids.

274
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,048
I read that in a book once.

275
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:31,961
You already have a watch!

276
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:37,537
I'll give you $20,
for the sake of bargaining.

277
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,418
20 plus 3 cigarettes...

278
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:42,843
for the sake of bargaining.

279
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:01,714
I bet you my $20 Charley.

280
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:01,888
If you can do that, you win.

281
00:38:56,653 --> 00:39:00,109
Froggy must have a steady hand
to pull off a trick like that.

282
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,927
It could be useful.

283
00:39:07,927 --> 00:39:10,127
I'll deduct it from what you owe me.

284
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:55,454
You don't love me, Charley!

285
00:40:55,848 --> 00:40:57,608
I'm always on the receiving end.

286
00:40:58,335 --> 00:40:59,207
What has he done?

287
00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:03,557
Nothing Sugar, just watching
you taking a bath that's all.

288
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,048
Get up!

289
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:07,278
It's no big deal.

290
00:41:07,657 --> 00:41:10,018
And if he plays havoc with
the operation, that's no big deal?

291
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,328
We need professionals, and he?

292
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,121
He's got nothing in there!

293
00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:16,370
A public danger.

294
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:19,714
You, learn and lose the door.

295
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,751
What do you want?

296
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,603
I don't have any clean clothes.

297
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,183
And did you
decide to give back my marbles?

298
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:52,280
No.

299
00:41:53,488 --> 00:41:56,087
So what. In 1 hour you'll be dead.

300
00:41:58,448 --> 00:41:59,897
I want to die properly.

301
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:06,579
Look at Paul's stuff.

302
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:09,891
You can take what fits you.

303
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,171
When you stayed
at the Ritz, was that during the war?

304
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:19,326
One can't hide
a thing from you, Froggy.

305
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:24,086
September '44.

306
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,826
What did you do in the army?

307
00:42:26,229 --> 00:42:27,299
Tourist.

308
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:29,603
And as a civilian?

309
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:31,154
Thief.

310
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:34,379
I've always had the same trade.

311
00:42:43,572 --> 00:42:44,701
Who is that?

312
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:49,445
A mare from your country.

313
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,062
Her name was Jelly Nut.

314
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:55,102
She is dead now.

315
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:04,529
Here, I've never used it.

316
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:13,785
Soon I'll be living in Paris.

317
00:43:15,465 --> 00:43:18,701
And I'll buy all
the descendants of Jelly Nut for sale.

318
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:20,404
You'll need a lot of money.

319
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,317
I'll have all the money I need.

320
00:43:23,341 --> 00:43:24,638
Charley, why Paris?

321
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:28,532
Because every day
that God gives there is a race.

322
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,671
Look here, the great lady!

323
00:44:32,145 --> 00:44:35,305
We'd need
to make some rules for the bathroom.

324
00:44:36,017 --> 00:44:37,688
He was inside for a billion years!

325
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:41,505
Would you like eggs?

326
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:43,321
A dozen!

327
00:45:11,157 --> 00:45:12,542
I'm hungry!

328
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,609
The question is how to kill him.

329
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,881
Do we get him to talk first?

330
00:45:37,632 --> 00:45:38,800
Obviously.

331
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,607
Not bad.

332
00:45:50,793 --> 00:45:52,008
Paul!

333
00:45:53,009 --> 00:45:56,657
Paul, we have to go back right now!

334
00:46:05,487 --> 00:46:07,263
Pepper, open up!

335
00:46:09,608 --> 00:46:12,080
Charley, Paul is dead!

336
00:46:12,874 --> 00:46:14,209
Charley, do you hear me?

337
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:15,776
Open up!

338
00:46:21,305 --> 00:46:22,721
Nobody comes in, Charley.

339
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:25,402
I'm not giving back
my brother until I get a priest.

340
00:46:26,157 --> 00:46:28,186
You hear me Charley? I want a priest.

341
00:46:28,923 --> 00:46:30,571
What are you
talking about, open the door!

342
00:46:30,572 --> 00:46:34,263
I want a burial, I want a priest!

343
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:40,894
First Renner, and now Paul.

344
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:43,740
Yes, we're off to a good start.

345
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:48,660
Who will go up to the bedroom?

346
00:46:50,388 --> 00:46:51,572
He will.

347
00:46:57,894 --> 00:46:59,445
Why me?

348
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,382
'Cause we're going to dig a hole,

349
00:47:03,917 --> 00:47:06,434
it's up to you to decide who goes in it.

350
00:48:02,701 --> 00:48:04,966
Does she have a lot of ammunition?

351
00:48:05,017 --> 00:48:06,121
An arsenal.

352
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:09,409
If Pepper wanted to kill you,
you'd already be dead.

353
00:48:10,026 --> 00:48:11,690
You should walk right in.

354
00:48:31,037 --> 00:48:32,540
I want a priest, and prayers.

355
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,757
We can't call a priest.

356
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:43,958
You know, he was 4 years older,

357
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:47,261
but I was always looking after him.

358
00:48:48,566 --> 00:48:49,822
Who looked after you, Pepper?

359
00:48:50,518 --> 00:48:51,495
Charley.

360
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,146
Charley is a good and magnificent man.

361
00:48:54,928 --> 00:48:57,395
Once, when I was at
the orphanage with Paul,

362
00:48:58,507 --> 00:49:01,195
he came to get us both
in the middle of the night.

363
00:49:02,251 --> 00:49:04,652
He smuggled me out in blanket,

364
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:07,898
He took us to New Orleans

365
00:49:08,841 --> 00:49:12,466
and we lived a magnificent life.

366
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:18,059
Before he died,
my dad was in prison with Charley.

367
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:21,467
We'll say a prayer Pepper,
I promise you.

368
00:49:25,205 --> 00:49:26,452
A real prayer?

369
00:49:27,004 --> 00:49:28,703
Yes.

370
00:49:32,663 --> 00:49:34,862
They're digging a hole near the bench.

371
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:40,897
They have to dig under the trees.

372
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,377
My brother liked to be under the trees.

373
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:52,418
I want what I was promised.

374
00:49:52,994 --> 00:49:54,762
A prayer, and under the trees.

375
00:49:56,147 --> 00:50:01,604
Froggy, you can have until sunset
to tell me where my money is.

376
00:50:29,382 --> 00:50:30,886
Who is gonna say the prayer?

377
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:33,112
Sugar.

378
00:50:33,936 --> 00:50:35,511
A woman can't be the priest.

379
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:40,176
Matonne then.

380
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:44,074
I don't know no prayers.

381
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:50,379
There's nothing in my head.

382
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:53,581
Rizzio will say it.

383
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,379
Cannot, it's not his religion.

384
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,123
And Froggy neither,

385
00:50:57,714 --> 00:50:58,795
he's not one of us.

386
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:03,276
Then we don't bury my brother.

387
00:51:07,863 --> 00:51:09,008
Charley...

388
00:51:14,848 --> 00:51:16,648
I never remember it.

389
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:20,434
Besides, it got
nothing to do with a burial.

390
00:51:20,716 --> 00:51:22,874
If it's a prayer, it's a prayer.

391
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:31,867
Now lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep

392
00:51:32,377 --> 00:51:35,831
if I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord to take, good night.

393
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,656
I bet Paul $ 10 he wouldn't die.

394
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:08,841
Keep it, you did the digging.

395
00:52:10,986 --> 00:52:13,210
If I pay it's like a real burial.

396
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,401
So,

397
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:07,957
spying, are we?

398
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:12,728
It's a fire engine.

399
00:53:15,177 --> 00:53:16,217
What for?

400
00:53:17,673 --> 00:53:19,345
You never know when a fire starts.

401
00:53:20,743 --> 00:53:22,063
I made rose pie.

402
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:23,476
A what?

403
00:53:23,713 --> 00:53:25,121
With rose jelly,

404
00:53:26,658 --> 00:53:28,594
The flowers... it's pretty good.

405
00:53:31,603 --> 00:53:32,651
Where are the others?

406
00:53:33,674 --> 00:53:34,868
Montreal.

407
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:37,232
Are you guarding me?

408
00:53:38,088 --> 00:53:39,985
Mmm, I even have a rifle.

409
00:54:00,352 --> 00:54:01,729
This place belongs to you, Sugar?

410
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,689
And you belong to Charley?

411
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:05,675
When he thinks about it

412
00:54:05,932 --> 00:54:07,268
We know each other for 15 years.

413
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:14,481
Of those 15 years, 10 he was in prison.

414
00:54:16,177 --> 00:54:18,290
I saw him Thursdays, behind a grill.

415
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:22,787
And otherwise, it was between 2 jobs,
when he came to hide.

416
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,736
And for me, between 2 divorces.

417
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,629
And now, will he take you to Paris?

418
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:33,530
The only way Charley can live is alone.

419
00:54:35,331 --> 00:54:36,090
And you?

420
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:45,516
Me? Exactly the opposite.

421
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:51,589
And Charley isn't jealous?

422
00:54:54,645 --> 00:54:56,055
It's good, huh?

423
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:21,592
We ought to change that bandage.

424
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:11,503
Knock out...

425
00:57:12,156 --> 00:57:13,320
Yes!

426
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,352
There's somebody above your head.

427
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,066
What?

428
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:23,746
I am a medium.

429
00:57:27,969 --> 00:57:30,938
Wait! Come, don't be stupid, come!

430
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:34,923
Listen here, that won't do.

431
00:57:35,781 --> 00:57:37,003
She is a medium!

432
00:57:38,867 --> 00:57:41,308
With the money
you're gonna make you can take dozens.

433
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:43,869
Plenty of mediums!

434
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:55,798
Charley will kill you.

435
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:58,303
You said that he's not jealous.

436
00:57:59,524 --> 00:58:00,827
That's not the point, Tony.

437
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,580
It's not a bullet
that'll kill you, it's a knife stab.

438
00:58:11,758 --> 00:58:13,582
You're not obliged to tell Charley.

439
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,424
The gun...

440
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:41,314
You scared me.

441
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:42,907
Not enough.

442
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:48,011
I've knew somebody once
who let his gun be taken...

443
00:58:52,436 --> 00:58:54,069
He didn't have time to be scared.

444
00:59:01,277 --> 00:59:02,442
The sun is setting, Froggy.

445
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,148
Are you winning?

446
00:59:12,236 --> 00:59:13,278
No, you're taking my queen.

447
00:59:20,013 --> 00:59:23,366
You weren't playing all afternoon,
what were you doing?

448
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:25,045
Thinking.

449
00:59:26,774 --> 00:59:27,527
Conclusion?

450
00:59:29,076 --> 00:59:31,748
Renner, and then Paul.
That means you shot 2 men.

451
00:59:33,382 --> 00:59:34,813
I'll tell you where your money is.

452
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:37,966
Because now you
have a better reason to hold on to me.

453
00:59:40,381 --> 00:59:42,069
But take these off.

454
00:59:43,005 --> 00:59:44,269
If you can tell me where my money is,

455
00:59:45,173 --> 00:59:46,441
you have my word.

456
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,486
It's in Paul's coat.

457
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,031
Yesterday, when you brought me here,

458
00:59:53,682 --> 00:59:55,696
I didn't want
those bills found in my pocket.

459
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:57,918
So I put them in his.

460
00:59:59,406 --> 01:00:00,366
What coat?

461
01:00:01,085 --> 01:00:02,134
The one he is buried in.

462
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,614
We got to dig him up?

463
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:07,448
He's gonna do the shoveling!

464
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,328
You promised... now take these off.

465
01:00:19,245 --> 01:00:21,632
Pepper found these
when she dressed her brother.

466
01:00:22,846 --> 01:00:23,950
And you didn't do anything?

467
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:27,842
Maybe I came
to the same conclusion, Froggy.

468
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:30,891
What's yours?

469
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:45,479
Suppose you'd cut me in
on the job you're planning.

470
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:50,604
I'd have enough to go to
Vancouver, then to Australia!

471
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:53,867
It's full of kangaroos down there,
they'll box the hell outta you!

472
01:00:54,476 --> 01:00:56,060
Tony,
go and do some painting with Rizzio.

473
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,746
OK Charley.

474
01:01:07,616 --> 01:01:12,159
Your room in Paris, you still got it?

475
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:14,175
Yes.

476
01:01:15,616 --> 01:01:17,033
I'll play you for it.

477
01:01:17,278 --> 01:01:18,165
Against what?

478
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:20,141
I'll tell you what you did this afternoon.

479
01:01:21,694 --> 01:01:23,102
If I'm wrong, you keep the room.

480
01:01:24,479 --> 01:01:26,591
First, you had a rose pie.

481
01:01:28,279 --> 01:01:30,407
I think it's lousy, but to each his own.

482
01:01:31,623 --> 01:01:37,985
Second, you came up here
with Sugar. I think that's lousy.

483
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,089
But she has the right
to do what she wants to...

484
01:01:47,602 --> 01:01:50,250
You come back
every time, don't you Froggy?

485
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:07,085
I went to Australia during the war.

486
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:12,382
I think it's lousy, but hell,

487
01:02:15,174 --> 01:02:16,926
it's your life, not mine.

488
01:02:21,334 --> 01:02:22,460
There's something else Charley.

489
01:02:26,245 --> 01:02:27,599
Sugar changed my bandage.

490
01:02:28,966 --> 01:02:30,759
It wasn't a bullet, it was a knife.

491
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:32,671
From a New York cop?

492
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,159
We fought, it was my knife.

493
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:44,681
Why do you tell me this?

494
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:48,328
So everything will be clear.

495
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:20,196
Shut that door.

496
01:03:21,776 --> 01:03:23,577
You have 6 bullets, you fire 5.

497
01:03:24,623 --> 01:03:26,320
If this key ring is still hanging,

498
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,903
I'll put the last one in your head.

499
01:03:29,576 --> 01:03:30,744
Is that clear?

500
01:03:58,842 --> 01:03:59,787
Just one left...

501
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:09,079
You're gonna miss!

502
01:04:22,061 --> 01:04:23,014
Go ahead, shoot.

503
01:04:30,095 --> 01:04:34,744
A real pro knows you always
leave an empty chamber in a revolver.

504
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,109
Rizzio didn't move, he knows.

505
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:40,461
He tried to kill me,
he pulled the trigger!

506
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:42,277
Correct.

507
01:04:43,598 --> 01:04:45,206
He chalked up a point.

508
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,216
Besides, he doesn't shoot so bad.

509
01:06:05,123 --> 01:06:08,269
Charley, is it "to wake over my soul"?

510
01:06:09,189 --> 01:06:10,157
Yes.

511
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:13,854
What are you doing?

512
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:16,846
I'm composing a prayer for Charley.

513
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,951
What's the use of that?
That's for Christians.

514
01:06:20,421 --> 01:06:23,013
That's not written in it,
it says God, that's all.

515
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:24,695
If it says God it's Christian.

516
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:25,890
But that's not in there!

517
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:28,114
But there's only one God!

518
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:29,383
Right.

519
01:06:29,846 --> 01:06:30,912
So why do you write that?

520
01:06:31,735 --> 01:06:33,003
Because mine is God.

521
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,201
10 dollars says it's another.

522
01:06:35,002 --> 01:06:35,730
Accepted.

523
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:41,764
Where's the mustard?

524
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:43,372
In the kitchen.

525
01:06:43,868 --> 01:06:44,916
Pepper, get it for me.

526
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,293
Pepper, I'm talking to you!

527
01:06:56,499 --> 01:06:57,420
I'm going.

528
01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:00,245
You stay there, I asked her!

529
01:07:01,053 --> 01:07:03,269
It's always the same with her,

530
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:06,093
do you hear me, get me the mustard!

531
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:17,351
Hey, did you see
what she did, did you see?

532
01:07:20,342 --> 01:07:23,663
Imported silk shirt, did you see?

533
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:25,971
Enough, water and bath salt.

534
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:32,017
It's not my fault her brother's dead,
it was him who hung him from the car.

535
01:07:32,443 --> 01:07:33,242
Enough now.

536
01:07:33,947 --> 01:07:35,332
It was him who hung him, not me!

537
01:07:35,772 --> 01:07:36,483
Not true!

538
01:07:42,043 --> 01:07:43,157
Get your care elsewhere!

539
01:07:43,948 --> 01:07:45,653
What did I do to you, Sugar?

540
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:49,170
Lie, Matonne.

541
01:07:53,163 --> 01:07:55,243
A 23 dollar shirt...

542
01:08:00,182 --> 01:08:02,383
Froggy, was he the one
who got care this afternoon?

543
01:08:04,862 --> 01:08:06,950
So, what was it?

544
01:08:07,831 --> 01:08:08,607
What?

545
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:10,382
His wound.

546
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:15,120
I'm waiting.

547
01:08:16,312 --> 01:08:18,552
I cannot, Charley, I can't.

548
01:08:21,896 --> 01:08:26,538
Soon I will have no one left.

549
01:08:48,316 --> 01:08:51,828
Don't drink, Charley,
one doesn't drink before work.

550
01:08:55,268 --> 01:08:57,654
Looks like
things are not like they used to be.

551
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:02,680
Me too, I've grown older.

552
01:09:13,726 --> 01:09:15,501
I'll do whatever you want, Charley.

553
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:21,516
Have a good time with Froggy
if you want, I don't mind.

554
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:28,517
But please warn me if something
happens that could put me behind bars.

555
01:09:30,559 --> 01:09:34,188
Because anyway,
I wouldn't survive being behind bars.

556
01:09:37,262 --> 01:09:41,974
Now, I'll quietly have a glass or two.

557
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:46,984
Just to feel like an Eskimo husband.

558
01:10:07,826 --> 01:10:08,971
Who will sleep in there?

559
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:11,466
Huh, who will sleep in there?

560
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,598
Charley?

561
01:10:22,717 --> 01:10:23,541
Yes.

562
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:27,045
Maybe three of us could
pull it off, with Froggy on the team.

563
01:10:28,031 --> 01:10:30,582
There are already more
than enough maybe's in this business.

564
01:10:37,303 --> 01:10:39,023
I'm confident Froggy will play ball.

565
01:10:46,551 --> 01:10:48,056
I can never sleep in here...

566
01:11:13,692 --> 01:11:15,964
It's Rizzio,
he's going to sleep downstairs.

567
01:11:28,992 --> 01:11:30,070
Talk to me.

568
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,422
What am I gonna do with Charley?

569
01:11:35,342 --> 01:11:36,581
It's up to Charley to tell you.

570
01:11:38,413 --> 01:11:39,725
Tell me about afterwards.

571
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:42,966
I don't know.

572
01:11:46,126 --> 01:11:47,431
I know.

573
01:11:48,742 --> 01:11:52,831
Charley will live at the Ritz in Paris,
we'll see him at all the race courses.

574
01:11:54,016 --> 01:11:55,889
With an Italian duchess.

575
01:11:57,384 --> 01:11:59,264
You know how he'll call his horses?

576
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:02,001
"Like us"

577
01:12:03,995 --> 01:12:04,961
And then?

578
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:07,993
Rizzio will get a farm, in Saskatchewan.

579
01:12:09,044 --> 01:12:13,656
He'll have a nice wife,
half Jewish and half Indian.

580
01:12:14,577 --> 01:12:16,568
And you know what he will call his children?

581
01:12:19,505 --> 01:12:20,536
"Like us"

582
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,963
Pepper will go back to New Orleans.

583
01:12:28,495 --> 01:12:29,911
She'll learn nice manners.

584
01:12:30,695 --> 01:12:32,122
She won't eat with her fingers any more.

585
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:38,393
And Tony

586
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:45,001
he'll get a harem,
and end up in a crummy boxing gym.

587
01:12:46,858 --> 01:12:48,706
with some young buck who can't punch.

588
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:50,826
And you?

589
01:12:51,922 --> 01:12:52,834
And us?

590
01:12:54,587 --> 01:12:55,362
You don't agree.

591
01:12:59,563 --> 01:13:00,564
Come lay down.

592
01:13:01,604 --> 01:13:02,635
I'm not sleepy.

593
01:13:20,839 --> 01:13:25,415
Be careful my, friend... be careful.

594
01:13:51,812 --> 01:13:55,318
Tony... Tony!

595
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:57,495
What?

596
01:13:59,231 --> 01:14:00,391
Get dressed, we're going.

597
01:14:02,478 --> 01:14:03,432
Where to?

598
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:04,888
Somewhere, nobody will find us.

599
01:14:09,888 --> 01:14:11,897
I know a place,
the other side of the border.

600
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:15,942
But Sugar, think about it first.

601
01:14:15,977 --> 01:14:18,811
I've been thinking for hours, let's go!

602
01:14:19,657 --> 01:14:20,706
Why?

603
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:22,483
Because I'm afraid.

604
01:14:24,267 --> 01:14:27,291
I don't know what you're
running from, but it's not the police.

605
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:32,140
In your sleep
you talk about dead children.

606
01:14:33,565 --> 01:14:36,277
Your holdup... that was it a lie.

607
01:14:38,693 --> 01:14:42,021
and now, I would
tell Charley, but he'll kill you.

608
01:14:45,661 --> 01:14:48,679
And if not Charley,
it'll be Pepper who'll kill you.

609
01:14:50,327 --> 01:14:52,198
Here or there, they'll kill me anyway.

610
01:15:01,526 --> 01:15:03,301
Tony, don't get involved!

611
01:15:15,306 --> 01:15:17,467
That's enough now!

612
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:18,563
Matonne!

613
01:15:28,051 --> 01:15:30,269
I'll explain, Charley!

614
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:33,397
Enough, just try to open your mouth!

615
01:15:34,084 --> 01:15:36,581
I don't want to hear you
one time until we split, do you get me?

616
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:37,995
But...

617
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,387
Not one word!

618
01:15:42,767 --> 01:15:44,086
What happened?

619
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,775
Pepper wanted to leave,
but I stopped her from taking the canoe.

620
01:15:47,545 --> 01:15:48,457
Who did she shoot at?

621
01:15:49,089 --> 01:15:50,042
At Matonne.

622
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:51,778
Go back, you too.

623
01:15:52,165 --> 01:15:52,949
Get me that bag.

624
01:15:53,766 --> 01:15:54,590
But...

625
01:15:57,896 --> 01:16:00,952
If you get arrested
for vagrancy, you'll blow everything!

626
01:16:01,695 --> 01:16:02,894
I'll either succeed, or I die.

627
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:05,327
I won't leave anyone behind.

628
01:16:06,023 --> 01:16:06,962
Not even you, Pepper!

629
01:16:10,174 --> 01:16:11,363
Are you staying or not?

630
01:16:12,454 --> 01:16:13,445
Is it him or me?

631
01:16:13,746 --> 01:16:15,154
Give her that gun Charley.

632
01:16:16,101 --> 01:16:17,405
Finish this thing once and for all.

633
01:16:19,886 --> 01:16:21,485
You think maybe it's not loaded.

634
01:16:24,606 --> 01:16:25,655
Give her that gun.

635
01:16:34,264 --> 01:16:36,057
Is it true that you killed my brother?

636
01:16:49,947 --> 01:16:51,418
You chalk up another point, Froggy.

637
01:17:08,942 --> 01:17:12,579
My name isn't Froggy. Tony.

638
01:17:14,824 --> 01:17:18,256
My name isn't Pepper. Myrna.

639
01:17:45,576 --> 01:17:46,536
Hi Charley.

640
01:17:57,568 --> 01:17:58,868
And the cartridges?

641
01:17:59,272 --> 01:18:00,009
In the other box.

642
01:18:08,145 --> 01:18:12,091
That's Froggy, he's with us. Mastragos.

643
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,582
Renner is dead.

644
01:18:17,089 --> 01:18:18,257
I heard on TV.

645
01:18:18,908 --> 01:18:20,193
Doesn't that change things for you?

646
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:24,202
Why should it?
He gave me all the blueprints.

647
01:18:40,212 --> 01:18:41,477
For your brother, Pepper.

648
01:18:44,389 --> 01:18:45,358
Where's Paul?

649
01:18:46,326 --> 01:18:47,174
In town.

650
01:18:53,904 --> 01:18:56,921
15,000, as we agreed.

651
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:02,200
You should also
bring me a car, Mastragos.

652
01:19:04,816 --> 01:19:05,848
You'll have it.

653
01:19:06,112 --> 01:19:07,309
When?

654
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:09,242
I have my worries, Charley.

655
01:19:12,496 --> 01:19:13,569
Paul who isn't here,

656
01:19:14,602 --> 01:19:16,243
Renner who's dead,

657
01:19:17,414 --> 01:19:19,422
all that worries me.

658
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:21,519
I have a lot at stake in this too.

659
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:29,008
Hey,
redoing the lawn Charley? Can I see?

660
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:04,662
You, help him.

661
01:20:22,687 --> 01:20:24,392
You come with me.

662
01:20:33,674 --> 01:20:34,938
Try it on.

663
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:23,041
Still one left for a group photo.

664
01:21:24,177 --> 01:21:25,057
Great!

665
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:36,428
That'll be yours?

666
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:37,847
Yes.

667
01:21:51,718 --> 01:21:53,013
Just to recognize it.

668
01:22:06,415 --> 01:22:07,402
Don't move!

669
01:22:43,205 --> 01:22:44,326
Not bad.

670
01:22:47,808 --> 01:22:48,625
Show me!

671
01:22:57,226 --> 01:22:58,249
The photo was taken before.

672
01:22:58,831 --> 01:22:59,823
Who had the camera yesterday?

673
01:23:14,327 --> 01:23:17,065
He's photographed you,
and you had no suspicion.

674
01:23:17,511 --> 01:23:18,544
I like photography.

675
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,956
Go on.

676
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,839
Well, nothing.

677
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,369
You sure have
noticed something, with those 2 men.

678
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:31,465
Sure, the one who came later,
he had a watch on each wrist.

679
01:23:33,154 --> 01:23:34,354
I thought, that's not practical.

680
01:23:37,604 --> 01:23:41,020
If they show a different time,
you can't be sure of anything.

681
01:23:45,382 --> 01:23:47,519
OK, that'll be all madam.

682
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:50,911
Isola. You know, that's Ilo in Italian.

683
01:23:54,344 --> 01:23:57,080
Say, will I be in the paper?

684
01:24:08,451 --> 01:24:10,827
You wait for the others in Montreal,
I'll take care of the car.

685
01:24:45,784 --> 01:24:48,608
We're closed, didn't you see the sign?

686
01:24:49,648 --> 01:24:52,096
You don't refuse water
to a man with a gun.

687
01:24:53,312 --> 01:24:54,625
You can get it over there.

688
01:24:57,761 --> 01:25:03,306
You're more welcoming to others.
The French for instance.

689
01:25:11,795 --> 01:25:13,091
You've given me water,

690
01:25:14,635 --> 01:25:16,860
I'll tell you a story
by way of saying thank you.

691
01:25:17,916 --> 01:25:19,213
Don't bother.

692
01:25:19,266 --> 01:25:25,067
It's a sad, but very interesting story.

693
01:25:25,968 --> 01:25:27,176
Get out!

694
01:25:28,713 --> 01:25:30,560
Once upon a time, in France

695
01:25:31,129 --> 01:25:33,169
children were singing at the beach.

696
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:37,449
Children of our race.

697
01:26:46,505 --> 01:26:47,351
What is that?

698
01:26:48,178 --> 01:26:48,977
A theatre.

699
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:52,073
That'll be our point of departure.

700
01:26:53,217 --> 01:26:54,137
To go where?

701
01:26:58,818 --> 01:27:00,291
Suppose we're in America.

702
01:27:01,755 --> 01:27:05,564
We attack a skyscraper, and
we'll have all the police against us.

703
01:27:07,916 --> 01:27:09,452
You'll attack police headquarters?

704
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,941
Exactly!

705
01:27:13,785 --> 01:27:16,426
There, 18th floor.

706
01:27:19,331 --> 01:27:20,963
What are you going to steal up there?

707
01:27:21,588 --> 01:27:23,117
Something priceless, Froggy.

708
01:27:23,808 --> 01:27:27,400
Might be worth $1M, or nothing at all.

709
01:27:28,585 --> 01:27:30,617
In our case, a million dollars.

710
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,169
OK. When?

711
01:27:40,474 --> 01:27:42,273
It's for tonight, Froggy.

712
01:28:19,999 --> 01:28:21,431
The prison, Froggy.

713
01:28:25,224 --> 01:28:26,790
That's where you get out.

714
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:22,454
I've bought 2 tickets to New Orleans.

715
01:29:23,078 --> 01:29:24,041
Tomorrow at noon.

716
01:29:24,603 --> 01:29:25,768
Two?

717
01:29:27,231 --> 01:29:29,319
I have my passport Paul's.

718
01:29:30,918 --> 01:29:32,053
OK?

719
01:29:36,806 --> 01:29:38,568
OK.

720
01:29:49,228 --> 01:29:52,334
Mr. & Mrs. Smith.

721
01:30:19,269 --> 01:30:20,333
Hi Lester.

722
01:30:21,442 --> 01:30:22,750
Hi.

723
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:24,575
How is McCarthy?

724
01:30:25,446 --> 01:30:26,991
Nervous. Everybody's nervous.

725
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:29,487
Except you.

726
01:30:31,339 --> 01:30:32,956
Where will the exchange take place?

727
01:30:33,403 --> 01:30:34,339
I'll take you there.

728
01:30:46,838 --> 01:30:48,309
Now burn that photo in your brains.

729
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:52,968
If tomorrow something has changed
in the landscape, you don't discuss.

730
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:54,462
You don't think.

731
01:30:55,295 --> 01:30:56,223
You shoot.

732
01:30:58,799 --> 01:30:59,776
Another problem.

733
01:31:05,003 --> 01:31:06,797
We will have the sun in our eyes.

734
01:31:11,784 --> 01:31:14,997
They must really be
on guard to have the sun in front.

735
01:31:15,163 --> 01:31:16,930
Yes,
that's how they are in McCarthy's gang.

736
01:31:18,267 --> 01:31:19,546
Well, then we'll be there first.

737
01:31:20,394 --> 01:31:21,332
Exactly.

738
01:31:44,221 --> 01:31:46,303
My grandpa, in Michigan,

739
01:31:48,038 --> 01:31:50,039
he told me that he was born in a tree.

740
01:31:54,456 --> 01:31:56,808
That was always around this time.

741
01:32:01,137 --> 01:32:03,352
He drank a lot, my grandpa.

742
01:32:08,018 --> 01:32:09,931
So did you guess
what we're going to steal tonight?

743
01:32:11,077 --> 01:32:11,803
No.

744
01:32:12,906 --> 01:32:14,034
A human being.

745
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:15,858
A woman.

746
01:32:16,847 --> 01:32:20,717
She's worth a million dollars to
an Italian gunman who amassed a fortune

747
01:32:20,932 --> 01:32:23,886
and who calls himself McCarthy.

748
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:27,872
He's being held in the Montreal
penitentiary, faces trial in 1 week.

749
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:35,226
This woman is the top witness,

750
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:39,496
they guard her on the 18th floor.

751
01:32:40,052 --> 01:32:42,259
He's known her since she was 13.

752
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:44,885
After that
something got stuck in her head,

753
01:32:45,565 --> 01:32:46,590
she's still 13 years old.

754
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:50,157
She talks and talks,
she doesn't know what she's saying.

755
01:32:53,525 --> 01:32:55,095
They call her Toboland.

756
01:33:11,514 --> 01:33:12,577
Come with me.

757
01:33:26,611 --> 01:33:27,962
Renner talked before he died.

758
01:33:29,473 --> 01:33:31,122
I've already told you all I had to say.

759
01:33:31,633 --> 01:33:32,442
Conclusion?

760
01:33:33,035 --> 01:33:34,106
No use inquiring any further.

761
01:33:34,433 --> 01:33:36,769
I'll get into
that 18th floor and I'm coming out.

762
01:33:37,434 --> 01:33:38,224
For nothing?

763
01:33:38,916 --> 01:33:40,043
For $1 million.

764
01:33:43,537 --> 01:33:44,386
Did you get it now?

765
01:33:45,084 --> 01:33:46,494
I'll replace Toboland by another

766
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:48,166
and I pull it off myself.

767
01:33:49,158 --> 01:33:50,502
What will Matonne and Rizzio say?

768
01:33:51,101 --> 01:33:52,030
I have other worries.

769
01:33:52,429 --> 01:33:53,742
And McCarthy?

770
01:33:54,382 --> 01:33:55,591
When he finds out he paid for nothing?

771
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,111
He'll have other worries.

772
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:01,183
You talk better than Renner.

773
01:34:02,735 --> 01:34:03,864
You talk like a real professional.

774
01:34:08,104 --> 01:34:08,888
What are you making?

775
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:12,848
A passport for Mr. Smith.

776
01:34:26,555 --> 01:34:27,763
$20 on your part, Froggy.

777
01:34:29,169 --> 01:34:29,969
Exactly.

778
01:35:06,814 --> 01:35:08,030
What have they told you?

779
01:35:09,214 --> 01:35:09,919
Everything.

780
01:35:10,702 --> 01:35:11,464
Conclusion?

781
01:35:16,937 --> 01:35:18,882
You can imitate Charley all you want,

782
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,800
he will not venture out with an amateur.

783
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,784
You really decided for Charley tonight.

784
01:35:27,403 --> 01:35:28,787
Give me a chance, Sugar.

785
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:42,885
Tony, why that passport?

786
01:35:46,893 --> 01:35:48,022
I have to leave.

787
01:35:49,894 --> 01:35:50,847
With me?

788
01:35:57,310 --> 01:35:59,622
Give me a chance, too.

789
01:36:02,578 --> 01:36:03,499
Is it true?

790
01:36:14,995 --> 01:36:16,908
I'm just waiting
for the moment you're alone.

791
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:20,621
We won't come here tomorrow with the others.

792
01:37:00,032 --> 01:37:01,176
Why did we put on evening clothes?

793
01:37:01,752 --> 01:37:02,978
We can't cross
to the lower level otherwise.

794
01:37:27,771 --> 01:37:28,612
Yes, sure.

795
01:37:29,772 --> 01:37:32,044
This number,
does that mean you're with security?

796
01:37:33,388 --> 01:37:34,699
My photo is in the papers tonight.

797
01:37:35,526 --> 01:37:36,251
I beg your pardon?

798
01:37:36,947 --> 01:37:38,108
The one who attacked me is here.

799
01:37:38,489 --> 01:37:39,513
Box 18.

800
01:37:40,236 --> 01:37:41,020
Look Miss, I...

801
01:37:41,549 --> 01:37:42,267
Isola.

802
01:37:44,918 --> 01:37:46,701
I have to call inspector Barney.

803
01:38:36,885 --> 01:38:37,718
It's my turn.

804
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:44,565
Hey, tell Froggy
to join me at the Bonaventure hotel.

805
01:38:45,182 --> 01:38:46,239
OK?

806
01:38:47,286 --> 01:38:48,798
Tony won't come, Sugar.

807
01:38:51,535 --> 01:38:52,815
He'll leave with me.

808
01:38:55,391 --> 01:38:56,432
I don't believe you.

809
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:07,618
Mr. Hale, Mrs. Smith.

810
01:39:30,142 --> 01:39:31,087
He was here.

811
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:33,502
Are you sure?

812
01:39:34,224 --> 01:39:35,039
Yes.

813
01:39:38,608 --> 01:39:39,544
She was with him.

814
01:39:42,616 --> 01:39:43,768
Would you come with us, please?

815
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:45,737
I beg your pardon?

816
01:39:46,144 --> 01:39:47,156
Follow me.

817
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:13,492
You too, Miss.

818
01:40:27,238 --> 01:40:28,158
A present from Renner.

819
01:43:32,946 --> 01:43:36,577
They can block all the streets,
we'll come back the same way.

820
01:45:14,890 --> 01:45:15,962
Jelly Nut!

821
01:46:45,074 --> 01:46:46,392
Jane Bargim is dead.

822
01:46:47,022 --> 01:46:48,572
She went and committed suicide.

823
01:47:04,623 --> 01:47:09,320
Mama is home alone,
but her sister's name is Jackie.

824
01:47:16,695 --> 01:47:18,494
I thought we had more time
before they change the guards.

825
01:47:21,021 --> 01:47:22,429
I don't remember which watch I checked.

826
01:47:23,123 --> 01:47:24,210
It shows the same time.

827
01:47:37,002 --> 01:47:38,009
Get out!

828
01:48:48,141 --> 01:48:48,852
Sir, a call for you.

829
01:48:54,676 --> 01:48:55,726
Pretty music.

830
01:48:57,949 --> 01:48:59,150
Charley kept his word.

831
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:00,790
He's taken Toboland.

832
01:49:43,714 --> 01:49:44,889
Where's Rizzio?

833
01:49:45,706 --> 01:49:46,690
And Toboland?

834
01:49:48,443 --> 01:49:49,626
Come on.

835
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:08,420
It's not my fault.

836
01:50:09,605 --> 01:50:11,013
They told me to phone, so I phones.

837
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:17,006
I'm talking to you.

838
01:50:18,062 --> 01:50:19,214
Go back to your dad.

839
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:21,735
I don't have any.

840
01:50:24,592 --> 01:50:27,615
When I was little,
you know what my mother used to say?

841
01:50:30,036 --> 01:50:33,529
If you talk about your dad once more,
the Gypsies are gonna get you.

842
01:50:33,583 --> 01:50:34,375
Who?

843
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:35,587
The Gypsies.

844
01:50:36,136 --> 01:50:37,280
Yes, the Gypsies.

845
01:52:00,307 --> 01:52:02,268
There's a ring
in the back of the doll. Pull it.

846
01:52:10,286 --> 01:52:14,854
Please don't send me back to school!

847
01:52:37,563 --> 01:52:38,378
What are you doing?

848
01:52:39,706 --> 01:52:41,530
Teaching her another language.

849
01:52:58,942 --> 01:53:00,095
You want to take her picture too?

850
01:53:21,553 --> 01:53:22,762
I know Rizzio.

851
01:53:23,435 --> 01:53:24,322
He'll never talk.

852
01:53:56,528 --> 01:54:00,416
Alright...

853
01:54:03,417 --> 01:54:04,369
I know where they are.

854
01:54:09,235 --> 01:54:10,279
OK, let's go.

855
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:45,512
Where are they?

856
01:54:48,039 --> 01:54:49,078
On the back.

857
01:54:50,637 --> 01:54:51,718
You go first.

858
01:54:59,367 --> 01:55:01,385
Now lay me down to sleep,

859
01:55:03,049 --> 01:55:04,376
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

860
01:55:07,553 --> 01:55:08,921
Jimmy!

861
01:55:10,593 --> 01:55:13,025
Ah, don't make me repeat, come up now!

862
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:16,361
Good night!

863
01:56:40,856 --> 01:56:43,264
Look, you're rich Charley.

864
01:56:43,959 --> 01:56:44,976
All the money in the world, you see?

865
01:56:47,736 --> 01:56:49,241
I see two bags.

866
01:56:52,649 --> 01:56:53,721
OK Pepper.

867
01:57:45,409 --> 01:57:46,488
Talk to me.

868
01:57:49,514 --> 01:57:50,754
Medium!

869
01:57:52,745 --> 01:57:54,353
Come on, come home.

870
01:57:54,873 --> 01:57:56,024
Look how they've tattooed you.

871
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:12,859
Charley!

872
01:58:14,613 --> 01:58:15,660
Bang bang!

873
01:58:15,695 --> 01:58:16,400
Don't move, you're dead!

874
01:58:50,528 --> 01:58:51,689
A rifle.

875
01:59:35,721 --> 01:59:36,969
Is that him?

876
01:59:37,616 --> 01:59:39,097
And they were all
involved in last night's raid.

877
01:59:39,132 --> 01:59:40,704
Where did you get that?

878
01:59:41,113 --> 01:59:42,309
From her.

879
01:59:43,817 --> 01:59:46,994
The guy we caught
at the shoot, that Rizzio,

880
01:59:48,219 --> 01:59:49,709
he had a watch on each wrist.

881
01:59:51,795 --> 01:59:52,516
Who is he?

882
02:00:01,348 --> 02:00:03,269
Somebody who bet $10 on God.

883
02:00:07,189 --> 02:00:08,165
For Rizzio.

884
02:00:21,721 --> 02:00:23,033
Where are the others?

885
02:00:23,826 --> 02:00:24,897
What others?

886
02:00:28,154 --> 02:00:29,162
If you do that I'll shout!

887
02:00:35,554 --> 02:00:37,139
Whoever
held this gun lost a lot of blood.

888
02:00:39,508 --> 02:00:41,884
I'd say if he couldn't see a doctor...

889
02:00:43,181 --> 02:00:44,077
That's not true...

890
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:46,424
You know him better than me.

891
02:00:46,539 --> 02:00:48,147
Was it somebody who abandons his gun?

892
02:00:53,228 --> 02:00:56,813
Perhaps you still have time
to grant him a doctor.

893
02:00:58,365 --> 02:00:59,549
How many were you in that box?

894
02:01:00,069 --> 02:01:01,735
Those others... I wasn't with them.

895
02:01:02,412 --> 02:01:03,185
And the others?

896
02:01:03,348 --> 02:01:04,603
I didn't see them.

897
02:01:05,224 --> 02:01:07,177
And they didn't do anything to me.

898
02:01:07,985 --> 02:01:09,737
And why wasn't he with them?

899
02:01:11,559 --> 02:01:12,528
That's all I know.

900
02:01:14,623 --> 02:01:15,895
Get a doctor first.

901
02:01:16,993 --> 02:01:18,080
Give them a doctor.

902
02:01:19,025 --> 02:01:20,224
Very well, we'll get them at your place.

903
02:01:31,036 --> 02:01:32,372
Always the same.

904
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:34,281
People like me to play,

905
02:01:34,316 --> 02:01:35,743
but I don't really count.

906
02:01:39,090 --> 02:01:40,674
I'll tell you where they are.

907
02:01:41,986 --> 02:01:47,475
I'll tell you, yes, I'll tell you!

908
02:01:53,681 --> 02:01:54,833
Take a glass.

909
02:02:32,353 --> 02:02:33,155
Will Sugar come?

910
02:02:33,850 --> 02:02:34,930
The line is cut off.

911
02:02:38,075 --> 02:02:39,298
Go and look outside, Pepper.

912
02:02:46,931 --> 02:02:48,277
What's your name, Froggy?

913
02:02:51,172 --> 02:02:52,332
Antoine Cardot.

914
02:02:56,839 --> 02:03:00,039
Mine is Charley Ellis.

915
02:03:32,090 --> 02:03:33,251
They're coming to the island, Charley.

916
02:03:35,192 --> 02:03:35,913
By the bridge?

917
02:03:36,295 --> 02:03:37,184
By the river.

918
02:04:32,436 --> 02:04:34,085
Take the bag Tony,
and get out of here you both.

919
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:35,032
No!

920
02:04:36,861 --> 02:04:38,789
For 7 years you haven't disobeyed me.

921
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:41,246
You're not gonna start now.

922
02:04:42,857 --> 02:04:43,585
Take her with you.

923
02:04:43,882 --> 02:04:44,914
And you?

924
02:04:46,014 --> 02:04:47,390
Get the hell out!

925
02:06:15,227 --> 02:06:16,066
What's the matter?

926
02:06:17,036 --> 02:06:18,740
I think they're here, on this side.

927
02:07:50,055 --> 02:07:50,942
Are they there?

928
02:07:59,141 --> 02:08:00,086
Get me my plane ticket.

929
02:08:03,384 --> 02:08:04,161
What?

930
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:06,896
We can't leave together.

931
02:08:09,174 --> 02:08:10,447
I'll join you tomorrow,

932
02:08:11,056 --> 02:08:12,214
with the noon flight.

933
02:08:12,215 --> 02:08:13,215
I don't want to leave you.

934
02:08:14,490 --> 02:08:15,586
And I don't wanna leave Charley.

935
02:08:17,219 --> 02:08:18,267
I promise,

936
02:08:19,107 --> 02:08:20,347
I'll be in New Orleans tomorrow.

937
02:08:21,812 --> 02:08:22,684
I promise, Myrna.

938
02:08:24,896 --> 02:08:26,328
Do what I tell you!

939
02:08:49,377 --> 02:08:50,466
I promise!

940
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:51,730
It's me, Charley!

941
02:10:21,263 --> 02:10:22,592
Pepper has left.

942
02:10:33,824 --> 02:10:37,506
My grandpa in Michigan,
he tamed a hare once.

943
02:10:42,234 --> 02:10:44,707
A real hare, with big ears.

944
02:10:47,275 --> 02:10:50,652
He ran away
and the hunters opened fire on him.

945
02:10:51,803 --> 02:10:52,940
You couldn't imagine...

946
02:10:53,812 --> 02:10:55,605
They came from everywhere.

947
02:10:56,556 --> 02:10:58,173
For 3 days.

948
02:10:59,868 --> 02:11:03,038
For 3 days on end
they chased him all over the field.

949
02:11:07,021 --> 02:11:11,590
And each time,
he found a new trick and he ran faster,

950
02:11:12,270 --> 02:11:13,311
and faster.

951
02:11:14,830 --> 02:11:15,750
And in the end, did they get him?

952
02:11:18,264 --> 02:11:20,052
No.

953
02:11:27,453 --> 02:11:30,135
My grandpa taught him too many things.

954
02:11:33,683 --> 02:11:34,824
Why did you come back?

955
02:11:37,313 --> 02:11:38,583
To bring you marbles.

956
02:11:47,026 --> 02:11:48,123
I'll play you for them.

957
02:11:49,873 --> 02:11:51,443
We're going to welcome quite a crowd.

958
02:11:53,297 --> 02:11:55,002
It's time to open up the joint.

959
02:12:03,739 --> 02:12:05,572
A marble each time a shot hits the sign.
