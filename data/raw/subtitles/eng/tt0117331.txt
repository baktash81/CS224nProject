1
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,100
It all began a very long time ago,

2
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:34,568
when a merchant ship was set upon
by pirates of the Sengh Brotherhood.

3
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:39,619
A small boy watched helplessly as
his father was killed by the pirate leader,

4
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,049
the Evil Kabai Sengh.

5
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:44,757
He jumped overboard
and was washed ashore

6
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:48,018
on a mysterious jungle island
called Bengalla.

7
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:52,572
It seemed like a case of
'out of the frying pan and into the fire',

8
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,246
but the Touganda tribesmen
meant the boy no harm.

9
00:00:56,466 --> 00:01:00,054
They scooped him up
and carried him to their village.

10
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:03,772
And that night, in an ancient
ceremony of fire and drums,

11
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:09,368
the tribal shaman presented the boy
with a ring of great significance.

12
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:13,457
The boy understood that he was
destined to avenge his father's death

13
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:18,929
by fighting piracy, greed and cruelty
in all their forms.

14
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,322
When he grew to be a man,
he became the Phantom.

15
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:41,743
- Damn worthless map!
- You drive, I'll navigate.

16
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,215
- The map is all wrong.
- The map is good, Quill.

17
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:47,803
Remember its source.
It can't be wrong.

18
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:51,938
Then why does it show a bridge back
there? We never crossed any bridge.

19
00:01:55,997 --> 00:01:59,371
- What's he saying, Morgan?
- 'urn around.'

20
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:02,001
- We'd better turn around.
- Not a chance!

21
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:05,976
Maybe this little quitter
needs a lesson in positive thinking.

22
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:16,382
Quill, now I get it.
Turn the map around.

23
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:21,309
- It's upside-down, you big moron!
- You big moron!

24
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,950
If the map is upside-down,
there ought to be a bridge up ahead.

25
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:29,538
All I see is more jungle.

26
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:30,952
Oh, shit!

27
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:49,796
Hey, Quill! No sudden stops.
What's the big idea?

28
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:53,352
Hey, take a look at that.

29
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,331
- What do you think?.
- I don't know.

30
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:05,754
It looks like it'll hold,
but then again...

31
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:08,182
Breen? Styles?

32
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:11,234
- I'd hate to bet my life on it, Quill.
- Same here.

33
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:13,239
OK.

34
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,372
We'll go over on foot.
All except one.

35
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,662
He'll stay back
and drive the truck across.

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,292
Yeah, but which one?

37
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:56,176
- I knew that bridge was safe.
- Come on, kid.

38
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:01,397
Almost there.

39
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,468
The brake, use the brake!

40
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,177
OK, back in the truck.

41
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:43,260
Well, it's on foot from here.
OK, Zak, take a look. Which way?.

42
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:49,736
- What's his problem now?.
- He says we can't go on.

43
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:53,541
- These woods are protected.
- Oh, yeah? Protected by who?

44
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:01,396
By a ghost.
'The Ghost Who Walks'.

45
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:08,074
I wouldn't worry about that.

46
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,334
- He's not taking us beyond this point.
- Shoot him.

47
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,046
No! We may need him.

48
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:17,356
To drive the truck back
across the bridge!

49
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,701
Tie him up and leave him here.
We can find our own way.

50
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:36,693
This is it! We're there!

51
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:08,993
Everybody look around.

52
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:43,532
Well, you look like an important fella.

53
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,000
Hey, Quill! Up here!

54
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,775
- Got it!
- Mr Drax is going to be very happy.

55
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:15,878
- What's so important about that thing?
- I don't know.

56
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:19,342
I don't like to ask Drax questions.
His answers scare me.

57
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:25,268
Styles!

58
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:49,459
- What the hell happened?
- He's dead.

59
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:53,263
The damn thing came alive
and choked him to death.

60
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:55,936
- It's not possible!
- Tell Styles.

61
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,940
- Let's get out of here.
- What about all the other stuff?

62
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:05,246
- There's a lot of valuable junk in here.
- Take it all. Nobody's going to miss it.

63
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:18,365
Now what?

64
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:21,376
- Drums.
- I know that! What does it mean?

65
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:25,049
It don't mean nothing.
But hurry up, just the same.

66
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,627
Devil, somebody needs us.

67
00:09:11,222 --> 00:09:14,762
This place is really
giving me the creeps.

68
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:30,345
What the hell is that?

69
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:32,275
Shoot him!

70
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,789
- Oh, shit!
- Run!

71
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,725
No!

72
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,085
Watch him, Devil.
If he moves, eat him.

73
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,710
- What about Breen?
- Tough luck. Forget him!

74
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:41,075
- Who was that guy?.
- Somebody I already killed.

75
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,547
- What?
- You heard me! I killed him years ago.

76
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,969
Guess what? He's back!

77
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,225
At least he's behind us.

78
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,627
Did I get him?

79
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:01,332
I don't see him.
You must have hit him.

80
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:31,001
So long, pal!

81
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:35,756
Keep the truck!

82
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,307
- Ghost Who Walks!
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:39,466
It's OK, now.

84
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:10,466
Hold on. it'll be all right.

85
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:05,822
Put them in the guardhouse.

86
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:11,460
- What have you got here? Poachers?
- Looters, Captain.

87
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:13,672
Captain, you've got a problem.

88
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,441
You've got a thing out there.
A big, strange-looking thing on a horse.

89
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:21,409
- With a wolf!
- Get him out of here.

90
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,795
He's been chewing
on the wrong kind of jungle growth.

91
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:28,500
You know what he's talking about.
We both do.

92
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:31,596
Not now, Weeks. I'm not in the mood.

93
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:34,937
'The Ghost Who Walks'.
The Phantom.

94
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:37,994
It's nonsense.
According to legend, he's immortal.

95
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:40,877
He's been around for four centuries.

96
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:43,124
Imagine, 400 years. It isn't possible.

97
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,328
Ouch!

98
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:58,420
- Did that sting?
- Yes.

99
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,923
Good. That means it's working.

100
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:09,950
This is it.
This is what I'm looking for.

101
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:13,038
The Skulls of Touganda.

102
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:16,094
One made of gold,
one made of silver, one made of jade.

103
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:18,715
Are they valuable?

104
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:21,431
More than that, Guran.
They're dangerous.

105
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:24,740
Listen. 'hen placed together,
the three skulls harness an energy

106
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:28,872
a thousand times greater than any
force or high explosive known to man.'

107
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:31,297
It's all right here in the chronicles.

108
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,385
'A long time ago, the Touganda tribe
possessed the skulls.

109
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:37,607
'hey knew the secret
of keeping their force contained.

110
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:41,240
'heir village was attacked
by pirates of the Sengh Brotherhood.

111
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:45,208
'he tribe was destroyed and
the skulls were separated and lost.

112
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:48,131
'For four centuries,
there's been no trace of them...

113
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:50,425
Until today.

114
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:59,283
You know, I'm fine!
I'm as good as new.

115
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,005
Very well, Ghost Who Walks.
Maybe later.

116
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:05,048
Yeah, maybe...

117
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:15,494
I used to come here myself, Kit.

118
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:20,213
I would consult the chronicles
for guidance and wisdom.

119
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,436
Usually when I was troubled
or confused,

120
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,569
or had just screwed up real bad.

121
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:32,543
I'm guilty on all counts, Dad.
I let that skull slip through my fingers.

122
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:37,174
Don't be too hard on yourself.
We all make mistakes.

123
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:40,848
- This one gets worse...
- How so?

124
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:45,072
It was the Sengh Brotherhood.
I saw the spiderweb tattoo.

125
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:51,085
You turned over one of the Skulls
of Touganda to the Sengh Brotherhood?

126
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:56,685
They've tried to get their hands
on those skulls for 400 years!

127
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:01,036
They don't have all three.

128
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:03,740
We don't know how many they have.

129
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:08,761
Have you any idea what it means,
if they get control of the skulls?

130
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:12,764
- They'd be invincible.
- Then stop them!

131
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:16,109
You're the only one who can.

132
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:20,951
Excuse me, Ghost Who Walks.

133
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:25,509
- Yes, Guran?
- I thought I heard...

134
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:31,905
- Were you talking to somebody?.
- Just to myself. I was talking to myself.

135
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:52,543
I beg your pardon,
you can't park there!

136
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:56,426
Oh, Miss Palmer.
I didn't realise. I'm very sorry.

137
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:59,896
Forget it. I'd throw me out, too,
if I didn't know better.

138
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:02,603
Welcome back, Miss Palmer.

139
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:06,494
- Let me help you with those things.
- Thank you.

140
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:28,765
Oh, Diana!

141
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,055
Mother!

142
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:38,416
- You look absolutely stunning.
- Your timing couldn't be worse.

143
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:41,631
- But how are you, sweetheart?
- Lily, you look marvellous.

144
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,634
- I've contracted malaria, Mother.
- That's nice!

145
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,559
- Diana!
- Uncle Dave!

146
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:50,448
- Sorry, I didn't realise it was a party.
- It's nothing.

147
00:18:50,657 --> 00:18:54,114
Just a Palmer Foundation dinner.
I'm much happier to see you.

148
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,875
- How was the Yukon?
- Dave, it's cold.

149
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:01,559
What more do you want to know?.
Well, why don't you freshen up?

150
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,819
- I'll get something to eat.
- Jimmy Wells would love to see you.

151
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:12,499
Hello, Xander.

152
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:14,550
Lily, why is Xander Drax here?

153
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,722
He made a very large contribution
to the Foundation.

154
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:21,059
- Return it.
- But he's a respected businessman.

155
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:23,771
No, Lily, he's a thug.

156
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:25,786
Hi, Mr Drax.

157
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:28,919
I had the strangest urge
a few weeks ago!

158
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,003
I wanted to charter a plane,
track you down in the frozen north,

159
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:36,313
charge into your tent, hut or log cabin,

160
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:39,815
sweep you off your feet,
and bring you back to New York.

161
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,611
Really, Jimmy?. Why didn't you?

162
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:45,672
After a few sets of tennis
and a cold Gin Fizz,

163
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:48,638
the urge just seemed to pass.

164
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,638
You're pretty
in those woodsy flannels.

165
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:01,536
You have to admit, Diana...
There's magic there.

166
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:06,677
What's in the sandwich?

167
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,273
Baloney.

168
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:11,275
Mayor, Commissioner.
Enjoying yourselves?

169
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:15,364
- As much as I can in this monkey suit.
- Wonderful. You've outdone yourself.

170
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:17,379
- Thank you, Mayor.
- Excuse me.

171
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,546
- Here's the man I want to see.
- You're not welcome here, Mr Drax.

172
00:20:21,768 --> 00:20:24,774
The Police Commissioner is right here.
Have me arrested!

173
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:27,194
Sample the canapés on your way out.

174
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:32,921
- For God's sake, that's not necessary.
- That's all right, I can speak for myself.

175
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:37,385
Tell me, your reporters are poking
their noses into my personal affairs...

176
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:40,012
I don't understand why. Do you?

177
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:43,904
Yes. And you will,
when we publish our story.

178
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,827
Why go after me?
I'm just a private citizen.

179
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:50,084
You own companies
that regulate public utilities.

180
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:54,970
You control the trade unions,
influence interest rates and stock prices.

181
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:59,275
And you have involvements
with the Zephro crime family.

182
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:03,330
I'd say you're
a very public figure, Mr Drax.

183
00:21:03,544 --> 00:21:07,548
I've never heard such tall tales!

184
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:11,019
Have you been talking to my ex-wives?

185
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:15,317
- How much does this newspaper cost?
- Two cents daily, five cents on Sunday.

186
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:19,668
No, all of it. The building,
the presses, the typewriters...

187
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:23,668
- Maybe I'll buy the whole damn thing.
- Not everything in life is for sale.

188
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:25,968
Of course it is, Dave!

189
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:30,986
And I'll tell you something else.
I usually get what I want.

190
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,891
Gentlemen, I have no axe to grind.
I'm only interested in the truth.

191
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:46,397
I've learnt something
from a source at the city library.

192
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:49,490
Drax has been extensively
researching esoteric volumes.

193
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:53,580
They are normally kept
under constant lock and key.

194
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:56,806
He's interested in something
connected with this symbol.

195
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,993
- What does it mean?
- He's on a quest.

196
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:08,496
For a supernatural power.

197
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:13,764
These are dangerous times. Dictators
are popping up all over the world.

198
00:22:13,978 --> 00:22:17,353
Drax already has the desire
to become one himself.

199
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:21,028
- This will provide him with the means.
- That's nonsense.

200
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:24,586
I know it's hard to fathom,
but Drax believes in it.

201
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:27,757
This man must be taken seriously.

202
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:32,607
I've traced the origin of that symbol
to a place called the Bengalla Jungle.

203
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,659
This is a ticket for the Clipper.
You're not going there?

204
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:41,002
My plans were to leave tomorrow
and meet up with a Captain Horton.

205
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:46,266
But now... I don't know if I can turn
my back on Drax for that long.

206
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,485
- It's just a wild goose chase, anyway.
- That's right.

207
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,622
A far-off jungle's no place for you.

208
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,958
I agree. You need to stay here
and take care of things.

209
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,430
There you go, Dave.
Listen to your niece.

210
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,864
- Let me go for you.
- I don't know, Diana...

211
00:23:07,076 --> 00:23:08,787
I want to go.

212
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:36,566
You were right, Mr Drax.
They know far too much.

213
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,760
All right, I'll be there...

214
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:07,269
- Hey!
- Call him back.

215
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:10,196
Thank you, sir.

216
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:15,829
It's Ray Zephro. Our little tootsie
is boarding the plane right now.

217
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:18,422
Say the word and
I'll drag her off by her hair.

218
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:22,142
Thanks, Ray, but I have
another way of dealing with this.

219
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:28,118
After all, I do have friends
in that part of the world.

220
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:32,167
I've got to go. Dr Fleming is here.

221
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:35,137
The librarian.

222
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:40,522
Dr Fleming!
Thanks so much for coming.

223
00:24:40,736 --> 00:24:42,982
I don't mind. It's a nice day for a walk.

224
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:46,290
Yes, it certainly is. Please, sit down.

225
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:48,544
So, how can I help you?

226
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:54,520
You can reassure me that my research
at the library is strictly confidential.

227
00:24:54,731 --> 00:24:59,900
- Of course it is!
- Really?. Are you sure?

228
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,577
Dave Palmer has been
poking his nose into my business.

229
00:25:03,797 --> 00:25:08,466
You have nothing to worry about,
Mr Drax. Your privacy is protected.

230
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:12,641
All requests for access
to special collections come to me.

231
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:15,903
I'm the only one who sees them.

232
00:25:16,998 --> 00:25:19,873
Well, good.
I feel a whole lot better now.

233
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:25,095
Thanks for coming.
Oh, one more thing, if you don't mind.

234
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:28,436
I'd like your professional opinion
on something under this microscope.

235
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,614
Sure.

236
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:33,368
Here, let me hold your glasses.

237
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:46,237
- I don't see a thing.
- Just turn the focus knob.

238
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:58,815
I guess you won't be
needing these any more.

239
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:08,626
- Your coffee, Miss.
- Thanks.

240
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,562
Guran, I'm leaving.

241
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:35,695
I'm going with Zak. What are you
listening to? 'Junior G-Man'?

242
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:38,455
I wish it was. This is real.

243
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,315
The Pan Am Clipper has been
forced down over the ocean.

244
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:17,517
He'll do.

245
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:20,487
We want Diana Palmer.

246
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:27,671
We're prepared to kill all of you,
one by one, until she steps forward.

247
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:31,507
- No, please!
- I'm Diana Palmer.

248
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:35,017
So quickly. How disappointing...

249
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:46,254
Happy now?. Get a good look?.

250
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:52,146
- I'll stay on the radio, Captain.
- All right.

251
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:55,119
Wake me,
if there's any news.

252
00:28:08,656 --> 00:28:11,662
Can't you ever come in
through the front door?.

253
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:15,579
It's too obvious. I like the window.

254
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,267
- It's good to see you, Phantom.
- Captain.

255
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:26,032
- We've had some trouble tonight.
- So I've heard. Any news?

256
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:29,203
The passengers were picked up
by a Portuguese fishing boat.

257
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:34,718
Everyone is safe, except one
young woman who was abducted.

258
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:36,478
Who?

259
00:28:36,688 --> 00:28:39,313
She was on her way to see me,
oddly enough.

260
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,367
- Her name is Diana Palmer.
- Diana Palmer?.

261
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:45,791
From New York?.
Uncle owns the Tribune?

262
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:50,091
- That's right. How did you know?.
- I heard the name somewhere.

263
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:54,520
First those grave robbers
and now this.

264
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:58,359
- I only hope we can get her back.
- I'll see what I can do.

265
00:28:58,578 --> 00:29:01,501
You'd better go out
the way you came in.

266
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:04,503
I have enough trouble
pretending you're not real.

267
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:10,266
Thanks, Zak.

268
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:19,756
Ghost Who Walks,
I remember they had aeroplane.

269
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:23,924
- Who, the bad men?
- A plane with boats for feet.

270
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:28,780
Boats for feet?
What, seaplanes? Seaplanes!

271
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,942
- Thanks for the help.
- Let's see her face.

272
00:29:49,963 --> 00:29:54,264
She's sort of pretty
in a spoiled rich girl kind of way.

273
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:59,525
Who are you? Are you crazy?. Do you
realise how many laws you've broken?

274
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:03,659
Disruption of international
air transportation, abduction...

275
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,787
Piracy, kidnapping...

276
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,882
Oh! Feisty, too.

277
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:09,805
Shut up.

278
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:14,067
If this kidnapping is about money,
you won't get one cent.

279
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,403
Not one red cent!

280
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:27,122
I've got to report in now.
Somebody has a big interest in you.

281
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:30,590
Maybe when I get back,
you and I can spend some time alone.

282
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:54,267
Good work, Zak.
Now go back to the Rope People.

283
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:58,624
Stay away from bad guys.

284
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:47,996
Nice boots. Expensive, huh?

285
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:49,840
Not really.

286
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:55,766
Come on, we can talk.
It's just us girls.

287
00:31:57,362 --> 00:31:59,322
Mind if I take a look?.

288
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,827
Quit that!

289
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:10,638
I was right.
Fifth Avenue, New York City!

290
00:32:12,568 --> 00:32:14,196
Just my size, too.

291
00:32:25,937 --> 00:32:28,514
What have we here?

292
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:34,164
All right, gentlemen, nobody...

293
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,595
Ladies, kindly pardon my error.

294
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:41,220
Don't move!

295
00:32:44,402 --> 00:32:46,980
Oh, a love letter!

296
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:53,708
- What is this, a ship full of women?
- All my pilots are women.

297
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:57,217
Interesting. Excuse me.

298
00:32:59,483 --> 00:33:02,157
- Who are you?
- A good Samaritan.

299
00:33:03,243 --> 00:33:06,582
I bet you're better than good.

300
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,969
- I'll get the chance to find out...
- There's an old jungle saying:

301
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:17,654
'Never point a gun at someone,
because it might go off.'

302
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:21,619
Fast hands!
I like that in a man.

303
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,973
Tie her up.

304
00:33:30,523 --> 00:33:32,483
Or don't...

305
00:33:32,695 --> 00:33:34,905
It's personal.

306
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:39,671
- Let's go.
- Not so fast. Why should I go with you?

307
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:42,970
- Trust me, Diana.
- You know my name?

308
00:33:43,181 --> 00:33:45,937
Sure. You're Diana Palmer.

309
00:33:46,147 --> 00:33:50,151
Your kidnapping has been reported
to the authorities. This is a rescue!

310
00:33:51,745 --> 00:33:55,619
Thanks, you've done a good job.
I can take it from here.

311
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,001
She's not changed a bit...

312
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:03,434
- What the hell is going on?
- There's a man in a purple suit here.

313
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:06,146
No, it can't be! Scramble the pilots!

314
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:10,585
Find him, stop him!
Don't let him get off the ship! Now, go!

315
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:21,022
- The engine room!
- I'll take the port side.

316
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:25,116
- I think we should stick together.
- OK.

317
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,422
We should stick together,
but I should go first.

318
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,128
Fine, go ahead. It's your rescue.

319
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,186
Get a hold of him!

320
00:34:36,404 --> 00:34:39,160
Get back!

321
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:44,466
Relax, pal! Relax!

322
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:48,727
Small world, huh?
How is that knife wound doing?

323
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:53,778
Where was it again?
Right about there?

324
00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:01,169
Good boy, Devil.

325
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:18,592
- Your dog's a wolf.
- I know. Come on.

326
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:26,320
Easy.

327
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,172
- Come on, get in.
- You can fly a plane?

328
00:35:37,188 --> 00:35:40,313
Of course you can. Why ask?.

329
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:51,015
Let's go! They're getting away!
We've got to stop them!

330
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:06,677
Mount up, we're going after them!

331
00:36:20,385 --> 00:36:24,638
Hurry up, let's go!
Come on, come on!

332
00:36:34,463 --> 00:36:36,459
Stay with us! Ride fast!

333
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,540
We're losing fuel!
We better take her down!

334
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:52,414
- See the pontoon?
- Yes.

335
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:54,337
- Climb onto it.
- What?

336
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:56,460
Trust me.

337
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:59,221
I must be crazy.

338
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,735
- Who's flying the plane?
- I jammed the stick.

339
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:47,327
There's not much time.
The clearing's short.

340
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:50,036
- Get ready.
- Get ready?.

341
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:58,812
- You can't!
- We have to.

342
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:27,675
OK, jump!

343
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:54,339
- I can't believe we just did that.
- Neither can I.

344
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:06,992
Swing around behind me.

345
00:40:21,537 --> 00:40:24,496
What's the matter with you?
Can't you hit anything?

346
00:40:31,146 --> 00:40:34,651
Come on, step on it! Faster!

347
00:40:47,606 --> 00:40:52,322
Catch them!
Don't let them escape! Go, go!

348
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,280
We can't outrun them
doubled up like this.

349
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:09,533
Don't worry,
I've got friends in these woods.

350
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:43,129
- How did you do that?
- My friends, the Rope People.

351
00:41:50,023 --> 00:41:52,518
- Are you OK?.
- I just feel a little dizzy.

352
00:41:52,738 --> 00:41:54,449
It must be the humidity.

353
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,741
- Wait here one second?
- OK.

354
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,100
I want to give you something
to remember me by.

355
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,200
I don't think that's a problem.

356
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,246
Well, you won't find these in New York.

357
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:39,087
Black pearls. They're beautiful!

358
00:43:39,305 --> 00:43:45,484
They were a gift to an ancestor
by a grateful Arabian prince.

359
00:43:45,697 --> 00:43:48,905
- I want you to have them.
- Thank you.

360
00:43:49,123 --> 00:43:52,081
Oh, no! Not the old pearl ploy again.

361
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:55,220
That's what passes for humour
in the jungle, Diana.

362
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:58,353
Captain Horton, Diana Palmer.

363
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:00,774
Thank God you're all right Diana.

364
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:05,621
- How did you manage to get her away?.
- Diana did all the work, actually.

365
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,708
Not only is he mysterious,
he's modest, too.

366
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:12,631
Old jungle saying:
'Phantom is many men.'

367
00:44:12,852 --> 00:44:16,309
No smoking in the Skull Cave.

368
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,617
Sorry, I forgot.

369
00:44:19,828 --> 00:44:24,628
I received your uncle's wire. What's
so important as to bring you here?

370
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:29,138
Can you identify this symbol?

371
00:44:35,202 --> 00:44:37,958
You'd better have a look.

372
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,811
Well, somebody say something.

373
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:49,396
We're all mixed-up
with the Sengh Brotherhood.

374
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:52,371
- The what?
- Sengh Brotherhood.

375
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:55,337
An ancient order of evil.
They started out as pirates.

376
00:44:55,547 --> 00:44:58,387
Nowadays, there's no telling
what they've become.

377
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:01,721
- Where did you get this?
- New York.

378
00:45:01,939 --> 00:45:05,147
My uncle's newspaper
is investigating Xander Drax.

379
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:07,859
He's crazy, power-mad.

380
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,749
Take her back. Use every man
at your disposal and give her protection.

381
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:15,593
Wait!
You're going to send me away?.

382
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:17,435
I'm afraid so.

383
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:20,902
I came here to do a job,
and that's what I'm going to do.

384
00:45:21,114 --> 00:45:24,036
There's a lot more I need to know.

385
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:25,708
Goodbye.

386
00:45:27,004 --> 00:45:30,010
- Wait a second!
- Diana...

387
00:45:31,098 --> 00:45:34,021
- Nobody argues with the Phantom and wins.
- Old jungle saying.

388
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:54,070
Oh, baby...

389
00:45:55,245 --> 00:45:58,785
Oh, it is beautiful!

390
00:45:59,005 --> 00:46:02,878
I used a little toothpaste on it.
It polished up so good.

391
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:06,936
Toothpaste? Really?.

392
00:46:07,151 --> 00:46:09,063
That's nice.

393
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:15,250
You know,
I am in such a good mood right now.

394
00:46:15,465 --> 00:46:18,755
I almost hate to mention this.

395
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:21,433
The happy home-coming!

396
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:25,652
Kind of brings a tear to the eye,
doesn't it? What went wrong?

397
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:32,215
- Something you didn't count on.
- Oh? Really?.

398
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:36,894
- And what was that?
- The Phantom.

399
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:41,573
- I thought that was a superstition.
- Oh, no. He's real.

400
00:46:41,784 --> 00:46:46,037
And he won't die. I know,
I killed him once and he isn't dead.

401
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:52,435
- That doesn't make sense.
- Look, I brought this to prove it.

402
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:00,161
See this hole? That's where
I stuck him with a 12-inch blade.

403
00:47:00,372 --> 00:47:03,711
You stabbed him in the back?.
I've underestimated you, Quill.

404
00:47:03,923 --> 00:47:07,262
- Right up to the hilt.
- That should've done the trick.

405
00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:11,977
The Phantom helped Diana to escape.
I think he's in love with her.

406
00:47:12,194 --> 00:47:15,450
This is getting more interesting.
Why do you say that?

407
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:20,130
Because he could have had me...
but he picked her.

408
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:26,104
- That could only be love.
- Or simply bad judgement.

409
00:47:26,315 --> 00:47:31,448
- So, what should we do about him?
- Do? Nothing.

410
00:47:31,662 --> 00:47:37,295
This is New York. I'm not concerned
with some jungle hero half a world away.

411
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,629
Here. Keep the change.

412
00:47:52,843 --> 00:47:54,125
Hey!

413
00:47:57,981 --> 00:48:01,855
Not so fast, buddy-boy.
This isn't real money.

414
00:48:02,075 --> 00:48:04,404
You're right, that's Bengalla currency.

415
00:48:04,623 --> 00:48:07,415
Coin of the realm
would be appreciated.

416
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:11,136
- I'm afraid that's all I've got.
- It'd better not be.

417
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:15,270
All right, here...

418
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:17,528
Where is it?

419
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:23,788
These are opals.

420
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,809
And that's...

421
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:31,559
..a star sapphire.

422
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:35,449
Take all of them.
Don't worry, they're real.

423
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,455
They'll secure your services
for the rest of the day, so wait here.

424
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:40,084
- You're kidding?
- I never kid.

425
00:48:52,248 --> 00:48:56,633
God is dead,
and darkness rules the earth.

426
00:48:58,264 --> 00:49:00,474
America is in financial ruin.

427
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,812
Europe and Asia
are on the brink of self-annihilation.

428
00:49:04,029 --> 00:49:05,989
Chaos reigns.

429
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:11,797
But like I've always said,
there is opportunity in chaos.

430
00:49:12,008 --> 00:49:16,309
And so, my brothers,
I give you...

431
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,932
..the Skull of Touganda.

432
00:49:21,575 --> 00:49:25,710
This skull is one of three.
When all three skulls are united,

433
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,385
they will produce a force
more powerful than any army on earth.

434
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:35,023
You've only got the one!

435
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:38,649
Legend has it
that if the skulls are separated,

436
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,627
two of the skulls
will point the way to the third.

437
00:49:41,837 --> 00:49:44,712
- Like I said, you've only got...
- Raymond, Raymond...

438
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:49,764
Ray, I know the location
of the second skull, OK?.

439
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:59,879
The symbol of the Sengh Brotherhood.
We shall succeed where they've failed.

440
00:50:00,093 --> 00:50:05,012
The skulls will be ours, and
all of the power that comes with them.

441
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,847
Count me out. This is wrong.

442
00:50:21,064 --> 00:50:25,948
Skulls? Forces of darkness?
This isn't right.

443
00:50:26,161 --> 00:50:29,120
I was an altar boy at Saint Timothy's.

444
00:50:29,336 --> 00:50:33,970
So were you, Charlie. This isn't right,
we weren't raised this way.

445
00:50:34,182 --> 00:50:36,225
Sit down, Ray.

446
00:50:36,438 --> 00:50:39,610
The only power I believe in
comes out of the barrel of a gun.

447
00:50:39,822 --> 00:50:43,077
Not from some jungle souvenirs!

448
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:45,250
Come on, Charlie.

449
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:48,883
You're on your own, Ray.

450
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:53,853
- What?
- You're on your own.

451
00:50:58,496 --> 00:51:01,668
Fine. Suit yourself.

452
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:08,562
But I'm gone, Drax.
I'm taking my entire syndicate with me.

453
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:10,983
OK, if that's how you feel about it.

454
00:51:16,961 --> 00:51:20,086
My bursitis is really flaring up again.

455
00:51:21,306 --> 00:51:24,181
Charlie, you're the new boss of bosses.

456
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:27,902
- Think you can handle it?
- I've been waiting all my life.

457
00:51:28,115 --> 00:51:29,528
Good man.

458
00:51:29,744 --> 00:51:32,667
Plans have been set for tonight.

459
00:51:32,878 --> 00:51:35,420
We'll go in and get the item
while the building is closed.

460
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:40,019
No, I can't wait that long.
This is too exciting! We go in now.

461
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,486
- Now, in the middle of the afternoon?
- Yes!

462
00:51:43,698 --> 00:51:49,045
I would appreciate it if you'd
keep the police away until I'm done.

463
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:01,033
Hey, there! Found you.

464
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,869
Page One Girl
back from the escapade in the jungle.

465
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:06,758
- Why are you here?
- I was in town on business...

466
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:08,879
- Business?
- I was having some suits made.

467
00:52:09,097 --> 00:52:11,854
- That's not business!
- It is for the guy making the suit.

468
00:52:12,064 --> 00:52:15,438
Why do you have to be difficult?
Let's have dinner and catch a show.

469
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:20,742
- Can I take a rain check?.
- Sure. Add it to your collection.

470
00:52:20,962 --> 00:52:26,012
Diana, I have a surprise for you.
Come into my office.

471
00:52:31,155 --> 00:52:34,612
- Kit!
- Hello, Diana.

472
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:37,327
It's been a while, hasn't it?

473
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:40,922
- A few years, at least.
- Six to be exact.

474
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,017
I read about what happened.
Are you OK?.

475
00:52:43,229 --> 00:52:47,697
I'm fine. It started out bad,
but it all turned out OK.

476
00:52:47,908 --> 00:52:51,163
- By the by, Jimmy Wells.
- Hi. Kit Walker.

477
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:55,379
So tell me, Kit,
where do you know our Diana from?

478
00:52:55,594 --> 00:52:58,054
We were friends at college.

479
00:52:58,268 --> 00:53:00,680
I see.

480
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:05,320
- Are you living here in New York?.
- No, I'm just passing through.

481
00:53:05,537 --> 00:53:08,211
I'm catching up on old times
with Uncle Dave here.

482
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:13,969
- Yes. Trading information about Drax.
- What do you know about Drax?.

483
00:53:14,185 --> 00:53:19,568
He's come across a rare artefact
connected to the Sengh Brotherhood.

484
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:23,953
It's an old silver skull
with precious stones for the eyes.

485
00:53:24,169 --> 00:53:28,554
- I've seen something like that before.
- You have?

486
00:53:28,765 --> 00:53:31,723
Yes, but it wasn't silver,
I think it was green.

487
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,898
Green... Jade, perhaps.

488
00:53:37,538 --> 00:53:40,829
I mean, where did you see it?

489
00:53:41,047 --> 00:53:44,967
Let me see.
It was my twelfth birthday party.

490
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:48,188
Mum and Dad had rented a big room.

491
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:52,023
Now I remember.
The Museum of World History.

492
00:53:54,749 --> 00:53:57,506
- Yes, sir. At your service.
- You're in a good mood.

493
00:53:57,715 --> 00:54:01,506
You bet. While you were inside,
I had those stones appraised.

494
00:54:01,726 --> 00:54:04,732
- You can call me Al.
- Kit Walker.

495
00:54:04,943 --> 00:54:06,653
- I'm going with you.
- Diana...

496
00:54:06,864 --> 00:54:10,453
- Where to now, sir?.
- The Museum of World History.

497
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:13,208
You heard the lady.

498
00:54:21,946 --> 00:54:25,201
You look great, Diana.
You've not changed a bit.

499
00:54:25,413 --> 00:54:28,039
You just vanished, Kit.

500
00:54:28,254 --> 00:54:30,546
I guess I did.

501
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,850
Not a word, not a letter.
Not even a phone call.

502
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:36,770
- I know.
- Why?.

503
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,527
I had to go home.

504
00:54:40,996 --> 00:54:46,343
- My father died rather suddenly.
- I'm sorry.

505
00:54:46,552 --> 00:54:49,261
I never heard from you again.

506
00:54:49,476 --> 00:54:53,527
I had to take over the family business.

507
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:58,454
It's hard to explain, but I've thought
a lot about you since then, Diana.

508
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:04,219
I've thought about you too, Kit.
Then I stopped and went on with my life.

509
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:25,561
It's all wrong. It's the wrong century,
the wrong hemisphere.

510
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:30,248
It's the wrong culture. The skull hasn't
been lost, just misplaced.

511
00:55:30,459 --> 00:55:33,381
What's your interest
with Drax and these skulls?

512
00:55:33,592 --> 00:55:36,431
I represent their true owners.
I want to see them returned.

513
00:55:36,641 --> 00:55:41,561
Drax wants them for himself. I can't let
Drax get his hands on this skull.

514
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,620
I've got to get it out of here.

515
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,871
Uncle Dave knows an important
member on the board of directors.

516
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:50,928
It may take a day or two, but...

517
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:55,314
Or we could just break the glass.

518
00:56:01,374 --> 00:56:04,214
I'll take that, thank you.

519
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:15,444
Museum security.
Everything's under control.

520
00:56:15,662 --> 00:56:20,497
Free cake and sandwiches
are served in the Hall of Nature.

521
00:56:20,717 --> 00:56:23,841
Bring the little ones.
Don't miss out. Thank you.

522
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:25,520
Bye-bye.

523
00:56:27,902 --> 00:56:32,286
- Who are you?
- A collector like yourself, Mr Drax.

524
00:56:34,628 --> 00:56:37,123
Drax, what's with the bag?

525
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:52,250
Something's happening!

526
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:03,986
This is it!
It's happening right here and now!

527
00:57:07,548 --> 00:57:09,092
Unbelievable!

528
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:13,687
It's beautiful! It's magnificent!

529
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:17,949
Show me the power!
Show me the power!

530
00:57:22,587 --> 00:57:24,797
Yes!

531
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,210
Amazing!

532
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:28,550
Amazing!

533
00:57:35,705 --> 00:57:37,997
I love this!

534
00:58:01,564 --> 00:58:02,847
Wow!

535
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:17,054
The skulls have spoken.

536
00:59:11,623 --> 00:59:17,255
All right, what's your name?
Why do you want that skull so badly?.

537
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,551
Kit Walker.

538
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:21,646
- And who is Kit Walker?.
- I am.

539
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:25,565
- And the skull?
- It'd go well with my drapes.

540
00:59:25,785 --> 00:59:28,244
Cute. You're very cute, Mr Walker.

541
00:59:28,459 --> 00:59:30,751
Fortunately, I have a cure for that.

542
00:59:33,764 --> 00:59:36,556
Stop it! Don't hurt him!

543
00:59:38,067 --> 00:59:40,027
Diana, are you sweet on Mr Walker?.

544
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:43,245
I thought that your true love
was swinging around in the jungle.

545
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:47,675
How did you...?
I mean, who told you that?

546
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,167
I did!

547
00:59:49,388 --> 00:59:52,347
Sala's got all the latest gossip
on two continents.

548
00:59:52,563 --> 00:59:56,817
Deny it. He's in love with you,
and you're nuts about him.

549
00:59:57,033 --> 01:00:00,872
From the moment he came flying down
that laundry chute, you were hooked.

550
01:00:01,086 --> 01:00:03,212
'Kismet in the jungle.'

551
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:06,930
You're despicable.
You're just jealous.

552
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:12,280
- Now I'm one up on you.
- Ladies...

553
01:00:12,491 --> 01:00:18,503
Quill, show Mr Walker up to
the observation deck and make him talk.

554
01:00:20,052 --> 01:00:22,512
I claim the body, when you're done.

555
01:00:22,726 --> 01:00:24,603
Now...

556
01:00:26,778 --> 01:00:30,319
Once I check these coordinates
we'll know the location of the third skull.

557
01:01:04,713 --> 01:01:07,553
Get up. Follow me.

558
01:02:25,634 --> 01:02:28,842
- Well, I'll be damned.
- What?

559
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:33,860
The Devil's Vortex.
We are going to the Devil's Vortex.

560
01:02:34,073 --> 01:02:36,568
Are you sure? Check again,
maybe you've made a mistake.

561
01:02:36,788 --> 01:02:38,285
No, no mistake.

562
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:42,256
Isn't that the place
where ships disappear?.

563
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:44,596
Yes! Incredible, isn't it?

564
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:48,231
There must be an island there.
An uncharted island.

565
01:02:48,444 --> 01:02:51,699
Maybe my brother was right
about all that stuff.

566
01:02:51,911 --> 01:02:57,507
Nonsense! Come on, Charlie.
This is the chance of a lifetime.

567
01:02:57,718 --> 01:02:59,761
Where's your spirit of adventure?

568
01:03:12,632 --> 01:03:16,719
Mr Drax, I've made all the arrangements.
You're getting a full police escort.

569
01:03:16,935 --> 01:03:21,355
Excellent. Have you heard the news?
We're going to the Devil's Vortex.

570
01:03:21,572 --> 01:03:24,447
The Phantom's in the building.
I saw him with my own eyes.

571
01:03:24,664 --> 01:03:28,750
Tell your officers there's a madman here.
He's armed and dangerous.

572
01:03:28,967 --> 01:03:31,972
- Shoot on sight.
- Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

573
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,930
- And the girl?
- Bring her.

574
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:36,987
She's our Phantom insurance.

575
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:39,946
Get me Security.

576
01:04:46,002 --> 01:04:48,711
We're all ready here, sir.

577
01:04:52,602 --> 01:04:54,764
Pardon me.

578
01:05:07,767 --> 01:05:09,478
Look out!

579
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:17,623
- Follow that car.
- Take my money, but don't hurt me.

580
01:05:17,835 --> 01:05:20,461
I'm a friend of Kit Walker's.
I need your help.

581
01:05:22,807 --> 01:05:25,896
Hey! Hey, you! Come back here!

582
01:05:34,629 --> 01:05:35,876
Hey!

583
01:06:39,925 --> 01:06:42,171
- What's back there?
- The zoo.

584
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:57,216
This is where
he would have entered.

585
01:07:13,764 --> 01:07:18,184
He sure as hell isn't around here.
Let's keep looking.

586
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,672
Good girl.

587
01:07:40,292 --> 01:07:42,371
Stop! Hold it right there!

588
01:07:55,122 --> 01:07:56,619
Get in!

589
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:15,130
Forget him, he's not coming.

590
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:18,098
He's probably dead by now.

591
01:08:18,308 --> 01:08:20,304
What is wrong with you?

592
01:08:20,522 --> 01:08:22,982
Why are you so mean?
Don't you care about anything?

593
01:08:23,196 --> 01:08:25,905
- Like what?
- You figure it out.

594
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,706
All right, everybody just shut up!
Step on it, Quill.

595
01:08:36,815 --> 01:08:39,690
Drax is heading for the docks.
I picked it up on my police band.

596
01:08:39,906 --> 01:08:43,531
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Thanks. Step on it, huh?

597
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:47,290
It's the bottom of the ninth
and you're two skulls behind.

598
01:08:49,014 --> 01:08:53,268
Dad, a man named Quill
has a gun belt like mine. Is it yours?

599
01:08:53,484 --> 01:08:55,860
Yes.

600
01:08:56,074 --> 01:08:59,698
He said he could show me
the Sengh Brotherhood stronghold.

601
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:02,959
He took me to a place
deep in the jungle.

602
01:09:03,176 --> 01:09:07,762
- What happened?
- He stabbed me in the back. Literally.

603
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:11,319
So sue me.
I'm a lousy judge of character.

604
01:09:11,531 --> 01:09:14,157
- Maybe I can get the gun belt back.
- If you haven't lost him.

605
01:09:14,372 --> 01:09:16,997
Don't worry, I'll catch him. I have to.

606
01:09:17,213 --> 01:09:22,464
- There's a woman involved.
- Saints be praised! It's about time.

607
01:09:22,685 --> 01:09:25,775
- Tell him to step on it.
- Can you go any faster?.

608
01:09:25,986 --> 01:09:28,825
- Are you talking to me now?.
- Yes. Can you pick it up?

609
01:09:29,035 --> 01:09:32,244
Sure. Hold on to your hat.
Or whatever.

610
01:09:55,606 --> 01:09:58,481
Looks like I've got a plane to catch.

611
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:01,997
Thanks.

612
01:10:02,207 --> 01:10:05,913
Hey, pal! Give my best to Mr Walker.

613
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:15,148
I love New York.

614
01:10:57,768 --> 01:11:01,273
We're getting close. We're almost there.

615
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:06,408
- What's that?
- Where?

616
01:11:06,624 --> 01:11:08,037
1 1 o'clock.

617
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:12,304
That's it.
There is an island!

618
01:11:12,515 --> 01:11:14,309
Take her down.

619
01:13:16,381 --> 01:13:20,717
We're so close now. I can feel it.

620
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:24,309
History is about to be made,
and you're all a part of it.

621
01:13:24,527 --> 01:13:27,984
An unequal part, of course,
but an important part, nonetheless.

622
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:21,636
- This one is mine.
- In your dreams.

623
01:14:26,232 --> 01:14:32,031
- Take it easy! My brothers, stay calm.
- Why do you call us brothers?

624
01:14:32,248 --> 01:14:35,170
We, too, are members of the Sengh
Brotherhood.

625
01:14:38,013 --> 01:14:39,295
Nice going.

626
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:44,018
Come with us.

627
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:52,416
I think us girls should stick together.

628
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,880
Now let me see...

629
01:15:58,099 --> 01:16:02,400
When was the last time
we had visitors here below the ocean,

630
01:16:02,611 --> 01:16:07,530
deep in the bowels
of this uncharted volcanic island?

631
01:16:07,749 --> 01:16:10,625
Never! Congratulations!

632
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,682
You pathetic doomed fools are the first.

633
01:16:14,893 --> 01:16:19,859
- Who are these people?
- My name is Xander Drax.

634
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:26,622
- What?
- X-A-N-D-E-R D-R-A-X.

635
01:16:26,841 --> 01:16:29,847
Xander Drax.
Begins and ends with the letter 'x'.

636
01:16:30,058 --> 01:16:32,184
From New York City.

637
01:16:32,397 --> 01:16:36,817
And you, sir?. As long as we're making
polite introductions and chit-chat.

638
01:16:37,035 --> 01:16:42,250
- Who might you be?
- He is the Great Kabai Sengh.

639
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:44,925
Leader of the Sengh Brotherhood.

640
01:16:45,139 --> 01:16:50,224
Direct descendant of
the Evil Kabai Sengh...

641
01:16:50,445 --> 01:16:53,450
..first leader of the Sengh Brotherhood.

642
01:16:55,792 --> 01:16:59,927
You're a long way from New York City.
What brings you to this place?

643
01:17:07,113 --> 01:17:10,036
These brought me here.

644
01:17:10,247 --> 01:17:12,492
The Skulls of Touganda.

645
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:15,967
And what do you know
of such matters?

646
01:17:16,179 --> 01:17:20,099
I know all about these skulls
and the power they contain.

647
01:17:20,315 --> 01:17:23,689
Once all three are united...

648
01:17:23,907 --> 01:17:26,617
The two I hold...

649
01:17:28,085 --> 01:17:31,126
..and the one you have there.

650
01:17:32,388 --> 01:17:35,263
Look, O Great One.

651
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:38,735
I really wasn't in the market
for a partner,

652
01:17:38,947 --> 01:17:42,119
but we have
a mutually beneficial situation here.

653
01:17:42,331 --> 01:17:43,827
Think of it this way.

654
01:17:44,043 --> 01:17:48,000
You represent the old guard of grizzled
scallywags and Peg-leg Petes.

655
01:17:48,221 --> 01:17:51,143
I stand for the new order of things,
modern and up-to-date.

656
01:17:51,354 --> 01:17:54,063
Just the man to carry our cause
into the 20th century.

657
01:17:54,279 --> 01:17:55,609
Silence!

658
01:17:57,913 --> 01:18:01,869
You have no bargaining power
with me, Mr New York City.

659
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:05,679
I could kill you and
feed your pink ass to the sharks.

660
01:18:08,733 --> 01:18:12,868
Besides...
you don't have the fourth skull.

661
01:18:13,078 --> 01:18:16,250
What fourth skull?
What are you talking about?

662
01:18:16,462 --> 01:18:18,208
There is no fourth skull.

663
01:18:18,425 --> 01:18:22,215
The fourth skull controls
the power of the other three.

664
01:18:22,436 --> 01:18:29,743
Without it, you've wasted your time
and your meaningless New York lives.

665
01:18:32,003 --> 01:18:34,332
Wait a minute!

666
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:37,176
Anything happens to us,
others will come looking.

667
01:18:37,392 --> 01:18:41,942
They know where we are.
You'll have an army down your throats.

668
01:18:42,154 --> 01:18:44,066
Do you want that to happen?

669
01:18:46,624 --> 01:18:50,462
No, that's bullshit!
Nobody knows where we are!

670
01:18:52,097 --> 01:18:53,593
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

671
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:57,315
Spirit of adventure, my ass.
It's every man for himself.

672
01:18:57,528 --> 01:19:04,455
OK, Kabie. You get me out of here
or else you sleep with the fishes.

673
01:19:04,671 --> 01:19:07,214
What are you going to say about that?

674
01:19:11,565 --> 01:19:13,976
What's that supposed to mean?

675
01:19:14,196 --> 01:19:18,367
Just ancient pirate talk for
'Fire the cannon'.

676
01:19:35,502 --> 01:19:40,421
Great Kabai Sengh,
I'm Quill, a loyal follower and soldier.

677
01:19:42,688 --> 01:19:46,276
Look, I once killed the Phantom.

678
01:19:46,489 --> 01:19:49,864
Join the club. Many of us
have killed him over the years.

679
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:53,539
But he keeps coming back.

680
01:19:53,758 --> 01:19:58,059
Hey! I can see that this Phantom thing
really strikes a nerve.

681
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:03,070
In that case, you're going to love this.
She is his girlfriend!

682
01:20:03,283 --> 01:20:05,445
Bring her here.

683
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:15,392
Think of the opportunities this presents.

684
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:18,946
Ransom, bait, revenge!

685
01:20:24,422 --> 01:20:27,262
The Phantom has good taste.

686
01:20:27,472 --> 01:20:30,680
Good! Personal pleasure,
I overlooked that one.

687
01:20:30,897 --> 01:20:33,190
So, what do you say?.

688
01:20:33,404 --> 01:20:36,030
The girl for the skull
and I'm out of your hair.

689
01:20:37,289 --> 01:20:40,664
- You pirates need to get out more.
- Kabai Sengh!

690
01:20:41,509 --> 01:20:43,838
Phantom!

691
01:20:52,036 --> 01:20:53,449
Let's get him!

692
01:21:42,836 --> 01:21:44,083
Run away!

693
01:21:56,413 --> 01:22:00,964
Ghost Who Walks,
I'll cut you off at your knee!

694
01:22:57,532 --> 01:23:00,740
You're not immortal.

695
01:23:00,957 --> 01:23:04,796
I know your secrets, Phantom.

696
01:23:14,787 --> 01:23:17,876
Take them to your grave, Kabai Sengh.

697
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:30,655
Sala! Cut the rope!

698
01:24:05,169 --> 01:24:08,460
- Torpedoes.
- This explains all those missing ships.

699
01:24:08,678 --> 01:24:11,600
You and Sala can escape in here.
I'll shoot you to the surface.

700
01:24:11,811 --> 01:24:14,567
Those are like warheads.
If we hit anything, we're fish food.

701
01:24:14,777 --> 01:24:17,867
We'll use the periscope
to make sure the path is clear.

702
01:24:18,077 --> 01:24:19,954
Come on.

703
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:24,337
- How are you going to get out?
- I'll be right behind you.

704
01:25:30,434 --> 01:25:32,264
At last.

705
01:25:32,481 --> 01:25:35,403
I've already killed you.

706
01:25:42,048 --> 01:25:45,089
No, you killed my father!

707
01:26:23,659 --> 01:26:26,868
You've got something
that belongs to me.

708
01:26:27,085 --> 01:26:28,367
No.

709
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:43,115
- Drax, over here!
- What is it?

710
01:26:52,276 --> 01:26:54,735
These skulls are more powerful
than I imagined!

711
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:59,286
I've harnessed the energy of the sun!
Who needs a fourth skull?

712
01:26:59,503 --> 01:27:02,295
I do. And I know where it is.

713
01:27:06,313 --> 01:27:09,188
I've worn it all my life. For protection.

714
01:27:10,866 --> 01:27:13,658
I've never understood
what that meant until right now.

715
01:27:17,133 --> 01:27:20,055
What a cheap jungle trick!

716
01:27:55,358 --> 01:27:57,817
Unbelievable!

717
01:28:50,753 --> 01:28:53,878
- End of the line.
- We made it!

718
01:29:17,406 --> 01:29:19,652
It all began 400 years ago,

719
01:29:19,871 --> 01:29:24,172
when a boy saw his father murdered
by pirates of the Sengh Brotherhood.

720
01:29:24,383 --> 01:29:27,342
That same boy
swore an oath of vengeance.

721
01:29:27,558 --> 01:29:31,264
He would fight piracy,
greed and cruelty in all its forms.

722
01:29:31,485 --> 01:29:34,110
He became the first Phantom.

723
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:41,793
I'm his descendant, Diana,
sworn to carry out his oath.

724
01:29:42,012 --> 01:29:47,015
The mantle of the Phantom
was passed on from father to son.

725
01:29:47,234 --> 01:29:51,702
Twenty Phantoms came before me,
but no one knew that.

726
01:29:51,913 --> 01:29:56,333
They thought he was the same Phantom
and that he was immortal.

727
01:29:56,551 --> 01:29:59,128
That's why they called him
'The Ghost Who Walks'.

728
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:02,023
I'm not immortal, Diana.

729
01:30:02,232 --> 01:30:06,616
I was born right here in this cave
and educated in America.

730
01:30:06,827 --> 01:30:12,507
When my father was killed,
I came back to take his place.

731
01:30:19,694 --> 01:30:24,448
And one day,
your own son will take your place.

732
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:26,662
Yes.

733
01:30:28,927 --> 01:30:32,516
The plane for Miss Palmer is waiting,
Ghost Who Walks.

734
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:34,011
Thank you, Guran.

735
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:40,998
- Does Guran know the truth?
- Oh, sure. He just likes to call me that.

736
01:30:49,147 --> 01:30:52,687
Goodbye, Devil.
Take good care of your master.

737
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,452
I'd better go.

738
01:31:08,781 --> 01:31:10,326
Hey, Kit.

739
01:31:10,536 --> 01:31:14,326
- I like her.
- Thanks, Dad.

740
01:31:14,547 --> 01:31:17,422
Well, get going!

741
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:54,729
Before I go...
take off your mask.

742
01:31:56,072 --> 01:31:57,984
Let me see your face.

743
01:31:58,829 --> 01:32:00,956
Kit.

744
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:13,780
I'm not really permitted
to reveal all of my secrets, Diana.

745
01:32:13,994 --> 01:32:16,536
You're not?

746
01:32:19,926 --> 01:32:23,716
Actually I am,
but only to one person.

747
01:32:23,937 --> 01:32:26,812
- Who's that?
- The woman I intend to marry.

748
01:32:27,028 --> 01:32:31,745
- What if she refuses you?
- No one refuses the Phantom.

749
01:32:46,538 --> 01:32:48,165
Goodbye.

750
01:33:15,113 --> 01:33:20,198
Leave It to my son to let the perfect
woman slip through his fingers.

751
01:33:20,418 --> 01:33:23,044
Fortunately,
Diana knew her own mind.

752
01:33:23,259 --> 01:33:27,845
She vowed to herself that she would
soon return to the Bengalla Jungle.

753
01:33:28,063 --> 01:33:32,067
Maybe then I can get some rest.
