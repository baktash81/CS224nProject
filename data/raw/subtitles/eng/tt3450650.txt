1
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,323
<i>The road of life is always
</i> under construction.

2
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,684
<i>The journey is hard,</i>

3
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,048
<i>but once you reach the
top,</i> the view is amazing.

4
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,610
<i>And that view is even more beautiful
</i> when you have someone to share it with.

5
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,681
Mr. Blart.

6
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,202
<i>For six days.</i>

7
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,642
<i>My beautiful wife of almost a
week</i> let me know by letter

8
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,849
<i>that she had what I like
to call</i> "some regrets."

9
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,287
<i>Her doctor called it
</i> "uncontrollable vomiting."

10
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,407
Honey.

11
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,562
<i>Her lawyer, "Dissolution
of marriage."</i>

12
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,845
<i>That's okay. I needed a
little time to myself.</i>

13
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,126
<i>Like the song says,</i>

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,170
<i>"I've been to paradise,</i> but
I've never been to me."

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
<i>I spent the next two
years losing myself</i>

16
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,047
<i>in the sweet escape of keeping</i> the
West Orange Pavilion Mall safe.

17
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,969
<i>At least I still had the one thing
</i> that never seemed to let me down.

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,201
<i>Security.</i>

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,805
Are you lost, son?

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,248
Anyway, come with me.

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,322
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,527
Andy, now give the
fake cop a hug.

23
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,568
We're actually... We're
certified, ma'am.

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,325
We take a test and everything.
It's pretty vigorous.

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,890
All right, hug him, Andy.

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,167
Well, it was nice to
see you, little man.

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,004
You know what, ma'am, he
doesn't want to give me a hug.

28
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,684
- And it's okay.
- No, he wants a hug.

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,047
- I don't think he does. Hey.
- Okay, Andy, hug him.

30
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,011
- Honey.
- Want to come in?

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,003
- Sweetie. You're embarrassing Mommy.
- He doesn't want...

32
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,684
- No, he's not embarrassing me. He's fine.
- Hug him.

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,125
He doesn't have to hug me.

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,604
I saw white. I saw white.

35
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,249
I'll get him again, ma'am.
I'll find him.

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,800
<i>And on the home front,
I always had Mom.</i>

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,928
There's my paper.

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,487
<i>That is, until she got
</i> drilled by a milk truck.

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,768
<i>Didn't know they even
had those anymore.</i>

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,729
<i>I guess I was the last
one to get the memo.</i>

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,525
<i>Paul Blart had
officially peaked.</i>

42
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,364
<i>Or had I?</i>

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,281
"Congratulations, Officer Blart.
You have been selected to join..."

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,011
"Congratulations. You have
been accepted to UCLA."

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,967
Maya! Come down here! I
got some great news!

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,965
Me, too!

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,531
Honey, we've been invited to the
Security Officers Trade Association Expo

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,525
and award ceremony in
Las Vegas, Nevada!

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,085
Vegas? Wow.

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,571
Yeah, I think I'm finally
being recognized

51
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,961
for, you know, getting the
mall out of that jam.

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,930
Dad, you saved the mall.
They should honor you.

53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,166
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,811
You know, times have been tough,

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,291
but no matter what happens,

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,649
as long as I have you by my
side, I'm gonna be okay.

57
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,609
But enough about me.
What's your great news?

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,127
Yeah, I just remembered that

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,449
we have leftover baked ziti.

60
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,683
What a day!

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,646
Yeah.

62
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,727
All right.

63
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,450
- Can I help you with your bags, sir?
- No. That's how they get you.

64
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,364
<i>- I'll</i> be fine on my own, thank you.
- No problem, sir.

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,084
Lift with the legs.
With the legs.

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,246
We're moving. Here we go.

67
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,164
Nice little break in the day.

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,686
We're going again.
We're going again.

69
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,006
Legs.

70
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,003
- Paul Blart?
- Yes, sir.

71
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,323
I thought that was you. Donna
Ericone, Mall of America.

72
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,920
Man, we still talk about
your Black Friday save.

73
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,441
Thank you.

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,965
I don't know if you heard.

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,520
There's gonna be a surprise
keynote speaker tonight.

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,841
Word on the street, it's
gonna be the officer

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,287
who's gone above and
beyond the call of duty.

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,281
What?

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,848
I got to be honest, I had a feeling, but
do you really think that, I mean...

80
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,887
- Who else?
- Yeah.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,604
Unless RoboCop walks
into the room.

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,603
Yeah, I would definitely
stand down for RoboCop.

83
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,170
- He's not real.
- No, I know he's not real,

84
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,844
but I would stand down for him.

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,967
He ain't real.

86
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,724
Just don't tell
anybody I told you.

87
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,087
- Told me what?
- About the key...

88
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,527
You got me. You done
gone and got me.

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,051
That was in the throat.

90
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,561
That was in the throat.

91
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,369
- See you tonight.
- Yeah, okay.

92
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,767
Roger that, Officer Ericone.
That was straight to the throat.

93
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,571
That didn't even glance off the chest.
It went right up.

94
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,849
- May I help the next guest?
- We're next. Here we go. Yes.

95
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,201
- Yello-ha!
- Good afternoon.

96
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,090
- Welcome to the Wynn Resort.
- Checking in.

97
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,528
Absolutely, Mr. Blart.

98
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,923
Mr. Blart.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,684
You're probably thrown
by the travel wear.

100
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,923
- Actually, it's "officer."
- Okay, sorry about that.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,002
Yes, Officer Blart.

102
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,765
I see we have you in a
partial mountain view,

103
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,890
and you requested a bottomless
bowl of Peanut M&M's.

104
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,289
Yeah, it's strictly medicinal.

105
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,930
Unfortunately, I am
cursed with hypoglycemia.

106
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,886
Sugar level drops, so do I.

107
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,966
I'm sorry. Your room
isn't ready yet.

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,965
But you can leave your luggage here, and
I will have it delivered to your room.

109
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,081
Dad, I'm starving.

110
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,289
- Can we just go get some lunch?
- Hold the mayo.

111
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,691
Hold on a second here.

112
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,081
You probably didn't
know this, Heath,

113
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,969
but if you check
the Grand Ballroom

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,566
and see which group is
booked there this evening,

115
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,881
I think your tune may
change a wee bit.

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,884
- Mini Kiss. The cover band.
- Yeah, I'm not with them.

117
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,327
Is there a manager I
could speak with?

118
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,124
You know, she's not
available right now, so...

119
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,688
You're taking my legs
out from under me here.

120
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,445
- Is the Terrace CafÃ© open for lunch?
- Yes, it is.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm out.

122
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,891
Bring it in, Heath.

123
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,042
Little tighter, bring it in.
Yes.

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,004
Just a little bit closer range.
I can't let this out.

125
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,206
But it seems to be that I'm going to be
delivering the keynote speech tonight

126
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,931
at the security
officers' convention.

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,526
You know, I think
they canceled that.

128
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,201
They didn't.

129
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,443
But it was downsized
to Conference Room C.

130
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,127
Nope, F.

131
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,207
- Okay, here's a map of the property.
- Okay.

132
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,770
There you are.

133
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,449
- Thank you.
- No, that's yours to keep.

134
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,161
Don't need it. It's already been scanned.
Locked and loaded.

135
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,526
Thank you. Time for some lunch.

136
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,601
- Sir?
- Yeah?

137
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,286
Your daughter and the
restaurant are that way.

138
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,362
Yeah, you had that upside down when I
scanned it. That's why... It's on you.

139
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,522
- Was I lying about the conch fritters?
- You were not.

140
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,682
They're amazing, with just
the right amount of zip.

141
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,923
- Yeah, you got to love the zip.
- I do. I mean, I was born to zip.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,241
<i>I put my hand upon
my hip</i> When I zip

143
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,731
<i>- You zip</i> - We zip

144
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,883
I can't believe you
know that song.

145
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,285
Hey, sir. You actually
forgot your valet ticket.

146
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,290
- Thank you.
- It's free.

147
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,121
Yeah.

148
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,651
I'm gonna go.

149
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,450
You were born to zip?

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,484
Since when do you
use the word "zip"?

151
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,807
- I always use the word "zip."
- I don't like it.

152
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,331
Hipster talk.
Everybody's zipping.

153
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,922
You need to slow it
down, young lady.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,040
Look, Dad, you're gonna have to get used
to the fact that I'm a big girl now.

155
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
Okay, first of all, we're all big.
We're Blarts.

156
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,680
Wide hips, thick ankles and
a low center of gravity.

157
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,449
That's how the
good Lord made us.

158
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,171
That's why we're no good at running
hurdles, and we never will be.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,525
What is that?

160
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,331
This? It's my vibrating fork.

161
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,528
It forces me to eat slower.

162
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,125
You think I eat fast at home?

163
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,170
On vacation, I'm like a cheetah
chasing a faster cheetah.

164
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,001
Okay, see? Look at
that right there.

165
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,050
It's just fuel. It's just fuel.

166
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,647
Here you go.

167
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,404
- Mr. Blart.
- Shanghai!

168
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,164
Sorry. Sorry to
startle you, sir.

169
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,568
- That's okay. You just hit the trip wire is all.
- Okay.

170
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,211
Well, I'm Divina Martinez,
the hotel's general manager,

171
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,770
and I wanted to apologize

172
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,491
about the confusion
regarding the convention.

173
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,562
And good news, I
upgraded your room.

174
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,211
It has a view of the Strip.

175
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,569
It's ready right now, and I wanted
to give you the keys personally.

176
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,806
Sorry about that.

177
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,769
Although, I must say, you
have very soft hands.

178
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,091
Air bag!

179
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,481
Excuse me?

180
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,851
I sense what you're
doing, Divina.

181
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,800
What am I doing?

182
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,887
Truthfully, being a
bit transparent.

183
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,928
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

184
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,890
Look, I understand
it's the 21st century,

185
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,883
and a woman can go after
hers just like a man.

186
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,921
- Dad, I'm pretty sure she wasn't...
- Tadpole, this is grown-up stuff. Okay?

187
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,849
Look, I know it
takes two to tango,

188
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,207
but my dancing shoes are
currently out for repair.

189
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,488
- Sir, I'm sorry if I...
- Apology not needed.

190
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,281
Just know I'm working my way
through a maze of personal fire,

191
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,045
and until the flames
of chaos subside,

192
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,805
I'm just not ready for
public consumption.

193
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,563
I understand, sir.

194
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,165
Have a great stay.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,810
It's not just me, right? I
mean, she was relentless.

196
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,130
Relentless.

197
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,450
What troubles you, my pet?

198
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,289
I just had the strangest exchange
with that guy over there.

199
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,406
Yeah.

200
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,769
He accused me of hitting on him.

201
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,771
Funny.

202
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,123
They say overweight people use
humor to achieve affection.

203
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,801
You know what, that makes sense.

204
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,688
Excuse me, Ms. Martinez?

205
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,366
- Our VIP guest has arrived.
- Thank you.

206
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,361
Okay.

207
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,003
Welcome back to Wynn Las Vegas, Mr.
Sofel.

208
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,131
We have the accommodations you
requested all ready for you.

209
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,801
If you need anything at all, please,
don't hesitate to call either myself

210
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,042
or our head of security, Mr.
Furtillo.

211
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,448
You guys took me for a lot
of money on my last visit.

212
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,921
Well, I hope you're able to
turn that around this time.

213
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,085
I plan to.

214
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,370
I got to say, I don't know
how this is an upgrade.

215
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,762
I'll tell you what, Maya, you take the bed.
I will take the rollaway.

216
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,764
Dad, this is your convention. You
can't sleep on the rollaway.

217
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,571
I certainly can, okay? I once
fell asleep raking leaves.

218
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,409
We'll figure it out later.
I got to get going.

219
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,926
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay.

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,321
Thanks for telling me
Victoria's secret.

221
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,771
What do you think you're
wearing, youn glady?

222
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,330
A bathing suit?

223
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,085
Maybe for an elf.

224
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,845
Decorum. De-cor-um.

225
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,606
- I was just going to hang out by the pool.
- Yeah, well, not in that, you're not.

226
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,091
Fine.

227
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,690
- Then I'm going exploring.
- Hold up.

228
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,205
- You got your extra phone battery?
- Yes.

229
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,281
- Flashlight?
- Always.

230
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,441
- Hot pepper spray?
- Check.

231
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,084
- Pocketknife keychain window smasher?
- I do.

232
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,130
- Baby road flares?
- Yes, I've got it all!

233
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,965
One more second here. There.

234
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,441
I've set it to monitor, so I can
hear everything that's going on.

235
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,921
No way. I already feel
like a SWAT unit.

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,731
Maya! Security is a mission.

237
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
Not an intermission.

238
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,806
Well, let's see if I bankrolled
the right NSA agent.

239
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,722
- How's that?
- So far, so good.

240
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,408
Excuse me, guys,

241
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,081
but we have a complaint
about the noise.

242
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,160
That's why we have you.

243
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,570
Gotta say, Henk, nice uniform.

244
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,845
Right? Look at that. Smiley.

245
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,922
You don't want to know what
it took to get the real deal.

246
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,400
No, I don't.

247
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,561
Okay.

248
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,483
They've moved several of the
pieces in the last few days.

249
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,722
Here's the new
locations of all 13.

250
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,122
Perfect. All right, I want to be in and
out in less than nine hours, people.

251
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,281
Sync up.

252
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,007
Sync.

253
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,441
Let's go!

254
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,807
Yes, shooter, yes! Yeah!

255
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,891
- What's all the hoopla, friend?
- This guy's crushing.

256
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,644
I'm literally running out
of room for my chips.

257
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,722
He's on the greatest
run I've ever seen!

258
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,201
Sir, you're gonna have to place a bet
if you want to stand at the table.

259
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,567
I don't know how to play
craps, but I'll tell you what,

260
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,483
Lady Luck's certainly been
in my corner as of late.

261
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,040
So I am in, okay? What do I do?

262
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,964
It's easy. Give me $60.
We'll place the six.

263
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,610
- $60.
- 60 bucks.

264
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,564
Wow, this is exciting. I got
to be honest, very exciting.

265
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,810
Sir, can I get you a drink?

266
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,846
You know what, how
much for a root beer?

267
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,890
'Cause I'm currently very invested in Mr.
Wynn's casino.

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,482
- Well, actually, it's complimentary.
- Complimentary.

269
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,449
I love it! Root beers
around the horn!

270
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,682
What do you... Just one is fine.
Just one.

271
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,006
Sir, come on. This
table's really hot.

272
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,889
- Give me 20 bucks for the hard six.
- Okay, $20.

273
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,166
- Give me $20 for the hard eight.
- $20.

274
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,924
- Give me $25 for the horn high yo.
- $25.

275
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,880
- Give me $20 on the field.
- That's all I have.

276
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,604
- The field is out there.
- No more bets.

277
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,331
All right! I've never
felt more alive!

278
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,004
Shooter, come on! Number...

279
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,206
Seven out. Craps.

280
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,364
- Loser!
- Fat guy ruined it.

281
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,249
- You lost everything.
- You suck!

282
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,603
Get your bets down, C and
E's, horn bets, high-lows.

283
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,251
- Get this game going.
- Your root beer, sir.

284
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,481
Thank you.

285
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,046
Yeah, I would love that.

286
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,920
That's a very good choice.
Nice. Gold.

287
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,604
Yeah, exactly. It was him.
You guys...

288
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,681
Let's go.

289
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,330
How long have you worked here?

290
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,721
Not too long. Is that your dad?

291
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,247
I wish I could say no right now.
I'll be right back.

292
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,604
- Dad?
- Hey!

293
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,648
See you later, Tom and Rita. You
guys are awesome. Take care.

294
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,324
I'll see you at the reception.
I'm not gonna go.

295
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,731
I'm not gonna go.
I'm not gonna go.

296
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,371
- Dad, are you spying on me?
- Spying?

297
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,240
- No. No, no, no. I...
- Dad, you're embarrassing me!

298
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,527
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'll leave you alone.

299
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,761
Please.

300
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,681
Blart!

301
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,364
Saul Gundermutt,

302
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,284
head of the Security
Officers Trade Association.

303
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,728
- I catch you at a bad time?
- No. No, no. It's a pleasure, sir.

304
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,086
Pleasure's mine.

305
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,604
And I just want you to know that I
got you sitting at my table tonight.

306
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,769
I got to say, sir, I
am just so excited.

307
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,763
I'm gonna be honest, I
did hear rumblings.

308
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,807
- Rumblings?
- About the keynote.

309
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,451
Yeah. Well, with good reason.

310
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,726
Nick Panero's giving it.

311
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,046
Great guy, great guy-

312
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,964
Yeah, Nick Panero. Those
were the rumblings.

313
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,008
That is just terrific.

314
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,048
It really is. That's...
I'm so happy.

315
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,760
You know, maybe I could
meet him sometime.

316
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,928
- Pick his brain...
- Here's your chance.

317
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,402
Blart, Officer Nick Panero
and Officer Gino Chizetti.

318
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,404
- Hey, Officer Panero.
- Hold the applesauce, hotshot.

319
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,410
I heard of you. Rumor has it you thought
you were giving the keynote tonight.

320
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,369
- He thought he was giving it.
- You thought you were giving it?

321
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,090
- No. You know what, I never said...
- Man, you gotta stop

322
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,969
bringing up that Black
Friday thing, Blart.

323
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,088
- It was, like, six years ago.
- You got to let it go.

324
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,049
I never brought up Black Friday.

325
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,403
I heard you're pretty good
on one of those things.

326
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,244
I've been known to dabble.

327
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,688
I... I really shouldn't.

328
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,441
Actually, sir, you can't.

329
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,171
I'll need a valid driver's license if
you want to take it for a test drive.

330
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,562
Yeah, I'm all-access, if you'll
peep the laminate, okay?

331
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,325
Let me just nudge her
out of whisper mode.

332
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,364
Okay, well, I see you know
your way around a pl 33.

333
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,011
I do, I do, but this
gal's a bit tired.

334
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,525
I got a modified i2
Commuter myself.

335
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,125
Still gonna need a
valid license, though.

336
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,611
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

337
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,201
How's that? Is that
valid enough for you?

338
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,045
That was pretty valid, huh?

339
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,122
- Yeah.
- Please be careful, sir.

340
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,690
It's about weight distribution.

341
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,445
Make sure both your hands
are firmly on the grips.

342
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,762
I guess you wouldn't
want me doing this!

343
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,725
- Yeah!
- Please don't.

344
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,767
Missed.

345
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,487
Blart!

346
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,085
- You see that?
- That's not good.

347
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,888
Still got the laminate.

348
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,446
Dad, are you okay? You should
really get checked out.

349
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,000
Pumpkin, my body's fine.

350
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,082
It's my ego that took a hit.

351
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,002
It turns out I'm not giving
the keynote tonight.

352
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,401
Well, you know what?

353
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,723
You should call a cop,
because you got robbed.

354
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,326
Well, thanks, kitten.
Technically, I don't need a cop.

355
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,890
- It's a figure of speech, Daddy.
- No, no, I know.

356
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,691
I'm just saying, you know, just
that cops think they're all that,

357
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,649
and I don't like it.

358
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,441
I do not like it.

359
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,131
Boy. We got a
meet-and-greet in 15.

360
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,409
I was wrong! The body does hurt.

361
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,767
Lactic acid!

362
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,441
Honey, you're not even dressed.
Come on.

363
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,286
As exciting as that sounds, I think
I'm just gonna take a bath and a nap.

364
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,486
I'm kind of tired.

365
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,603
Okay, yeah. I mean,
no, you should...

366
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,802
You should get some rest.

367
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,441
Well, I'll come back and get
you for dinner at Bartolotta,

368
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,369
'cause we got
reservations at 6:00.

369
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,165
- It's supposed to be the real deal.
- Gotcha.

370
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,761
Hey. Dad?

371
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,768
I'm really sorry
about the speech.

372
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,325
I'll see you later.

373
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,089
I got this one guy against the wall. He's
really sweating. He knows it's over.

374
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,128
Then out of the corner of my
eye I see this other guy,

375
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,329
and then I turn to him and I
say, "Hand over the yogurt."

376
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,970
It was over that fast.

377
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,804
- Lights out.
- Lights out.

378
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,360
Hey, how much you
pay for that belt?

379
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,762
I don't know. It was a
gift from my daughter.

380
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,764
You got a guy?
'Cause I got a guy.

381
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,568
No, I don't have a belt guy.

382
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,720
- That's crazy. What, you don't got a belt guy?
- No, I don't have a belt guy.

383
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,530
Khan Mubi. Nice to meet.

384
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,804
Khan Mubi. Nice to meet.

385
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,723
Nice to meet you.

386
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,451
It's been a heck of a day, and
that embrace certainly helped.

387
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,922
So thank you. First one warmed
me up, this one brought it home.

388
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,205
I think you kissed the shoulder.
All right, thank you.

389
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,520
My pleasure.

390
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,610
- Okay.
- It's time to go.

391
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,087
It is. And I think the
doors are open, so...

392
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,561
What's the latest, friend?

393
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,051
The Big Sticky Mess.

394
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,282
A grenade launcher
that shoots glue foam.

395
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,324
Marbles. You can't run with
these under your feet.

396
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,765
You can't even stand.

397
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,887
The Vitru Sonic Taser
renders your assailant

398
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,765
incapacitated for five
seconds at a time.

399
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,285
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey, Saul. What you got there?

400
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,567
It's getting revealed
tomorrow at the luncheon.

401
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,081
It's a prototype. I'm not
supposed to show anybody,

402
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,563
but since you're into gyro-performance
vehicles, take a gander.

403
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,761
Things will never be the same.

404
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,360
No!

405
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,091
Are you kidding me? Great.

406
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,607
- Are you okay?
- Thank you so much.

407
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,209
- Okay, here we go.
- Thanks.

408
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,964
- See you.
- Have a good day.

409
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,042
Hey, check it out, guys.

410
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,282
When you want them to pay the
price, you reach for The Finisher.

411
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,160
The most effective non-lethal beanbag
firearm on the market today.

412
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,448
Why don't you give it a spin?

413
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,562
- Me?
- Yeah. It's easy.

414
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,241
Okay.

415
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,050
Laser focus.

416
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,331
Exhale, pull the trigger.
Predator.

417
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,730
The adjustments are off on the sight.
I can tell, it's a little off here.

418
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,404
That's the problem.

419
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,727
- Paul Blart, Mall Cop.
- Yes, sir?

420
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,531
Eduardo Furtillo, head of
security of Wynn Las Vegas.

421
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,967
Pleasure to meet a
fellow brother-in-arms.

422
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,281
You know, a fun fact for
you, you might not notice,

423
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,842
but Mr. Furtillo here, being
the head of security,

424
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,251
is in a black coat while...

425
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,288
- I'm sorry, son, I didn't get your name.
- Jenkins.

426
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,169
Jenkins is in a purple coat.

427
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,768
See, there's a hierarchy of coat colors
based on their security responsibilities.

428
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,208
Black, gray, pine, and
then, last, purple.

429
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,770
Sorry, no offense.

430
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,202
You're wearing a polyester
shirt with Spanx underneath.

431
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,126
Yes. Good catch.

432
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,248
- I see you admiring the non-lethals.
- Yeah.

433
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,449
I guess they don't trust
you with the real stuff?

434
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,562
No, they do, but
we choose not to.

435
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,881
I mean, what are you
really guarding anyway?

436
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,086
Cell phone covers and Cinnabon?

437
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,162
There's also three ATMs
and a Dave & Buster's

438
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,250
that just is off the hook after 9:00.
It just gets crazy.

439
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,403
By the way, as a
professional courtesy,

440
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,724
I'm happy to keep my eyes peeled for any
irregularities while I'm here, so...

441
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,723
Hey. Closer.

442
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,201
Closer.

443
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,725
Since I was named head of
security five years ago,

444
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,571
we have not had so much
as a towel go missing.

445
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,246
Your mother must be very proud
of your accomplishments.

446
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,371
That got real.

447
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,441
Wow, that was impressive.

448
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,046
Was it me, or did he smell
like tobacco and vanilla?

449
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,202
'Cause I got a... I don't
know if it's cologne...

450
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,441
Let's just get some yogurt.

451
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,371
Maya?

452
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,442
Honey, I've been
thinking about the menu,

453
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,127
and I don't care, I'm
going double parm. So...

454
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,049
Sunshine, you still in the tub?

455
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,525
Honey?

456
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,131
Get me security!

457
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,923
That's so cool, you got into UCLA.
You must be stoked!

458
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,444
Not really. I haven't
been able to tell my dad.

459
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,681
Why not? That's huge! Don't
you think he'll be excited?

460
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,245
I don't think he can handle it.

461
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,846
My parents were thrilled
when I got my GED.

462
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,571
That is so cool your parents
support you like that.

463
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,529
Yup. Third time was the charm.

464
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,925
I'm not kidding. Was
closer to four, actually.

465
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,885
No. I got to go. I was supposed
to meet my dad for dinner.

466
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,611
- Okay, cool. Maybe I'll see you later.
- Yeah. I hope so.

467
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,681
Yeah, okay.

468
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,802
My daughter's missing. She's
not answering her phone.

469
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,647
Mr. Blart, I want you to know that
we will get to the bottom of this,

470
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,165
despite our differences.

471
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,326
Differences?

472
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,244
We need to establish motive.
Do you have a lot of money?

473
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,810
- Define "a lot." I mean, there's...
- Any.

474
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,611
No. Actually, I don't
have a lot, no.

475
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,166
All right, are you
an important man?

476
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,880
Well, you know, that
depends who you ask.

477
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,206
I got to be honest.

478
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,042
Could this be some
domestic situation?

479
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,724
- Your wife got angry?
- I'm not married.

480
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,371
- Your girlfriend found out you...
- No girlfriend, I don't have a girlfriend.

481
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,160
- Does anybody love you?
- Yes. My daughter,

482
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,326
and she's been kidnapped.

483
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,481
You know, since she's an adult,

484
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,602
normally we're not gonna file
a missing persons report

485
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,200
till she's gone for
at least 24 hours.

486
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,520
Well, let me tell you something.

487
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,291
I've been in the security
game for over 16 years,

488
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,880
and I've seen things that
you would not comprehend.

489
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,521
Understand this. We are
pulling the trigger, boys.

490
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,082
Now, I need you to establish a
perimeter and lock down the premises.

491
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,806
- You going to answer that?
- We're losing precious time!

492
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,885
This is Officer Blart. I
need to keep this line...

493
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,610
Yep. No, no. Okay. I see.

494
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,929
Yes. No, no, I can't...
I can't...

495
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,889
I can't talk about it right now.

496
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,962
Okay, okay, okay. Now,
we're gonna talk...

497
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,690
We're gonna talk about it later.
We're gonna talk about...

498
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,683
I gotta get going. I'm going.

499
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,966
Yeah, that was my daughter. She's
calling from the restaurant.

500
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,929
She just... She just called.

501
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,729
She's good.

502
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,884
My agents are highly
trained professionals

503
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,367
that do not have time
to let you play out

504
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,809
your little fantasies about
being a real cop, Mr. Blart.

505
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,406
Totally understand. I get it.
Yeah, you're right.

506
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,768
It is Officer Blart.

507
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,201
Hey, Dad. I ordered
your favorite.

508
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,771
Really? Well, you know what?
I've lost my appetite.

509
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,889
What has gotten into you?
You lied to me.

510
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,525
You said you were taking a nap.

511
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,649
- Well, I was going to, but...
- You never called me once.

512
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,883
You leave the bath filled, which
could have caused water damage,

513
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,440
candles lit, which could have
burnt down Las Vegas, Nevada.

514
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,330
I'm sorry. It's just that Lane
invited me to go out to the pool...

515
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,051
Lane? Lane? That's what
this betrayal's about?

516
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
Chicken Chow Lane?

517
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,728
Dad, people are looking.

518
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,801
What happened to her, Maya?

519
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,611
What happened to the pristine
girl who could never tell a lie?

520
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,569
What happened to my
little George Washington?

521
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,449
- George Washington?
- He could never tell a lie.

522
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,960
He was full truth
in a powdered wig.

523
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,010
- I think you're overreacting.
- Really?

524
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,760
And when were you gonna
tell me about that?

525
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,362
- Where did you find this?
- Please, Maya,

526
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,090
I'm a highly trained
security specialist.

527
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,128
You can't expect to
keep secrets from me.

528
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,323
I didn't think I'd get in.

529
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,248
I didn't even know
you applied there.

530
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,891
What happened to Central Jersey
Applied Technical Junior College?

531
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,440
We're talking about UCLA here.

532
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,329
Yeah, I thought we were
talking about CJATJC.

533
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,481
Dad, you don't understand.

534
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,642
I have a chance to
go to California.

535
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,611
Maya, California,
it's too far away.

536
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,924
Well, think about it this way.

537
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,970
You could come visit me in the wintertime
when it's really cold in Jersey.

538
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,123
Of course I can, if I want some
smog on my earthquake flakes!

539
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,171
You know what? I've decided.
I'm going.

540
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,561
Wait, wait. You just decided?

541
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,041
Well, you know what?
Decision overruled.

542
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,770
Judge Blart now in session!

543
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,809
I know you've lost a lot
lately, and you're scared,

544
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,769
but what you're doing
right now is so wrong.

545
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,249
I'm going to UCLA.

546
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,889
Maya, Maya, you get back...

547
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,801
Maya.

548
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,401
Paul? I catch you at a bad time?

549
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,050
I want you to meet the wife.

550
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,049
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

551
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,043
- Nice to meet you, yeah.
- Are you here with your wife?

552
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,531
- Daughter.
- Yeah.

553
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,810
It's our last trip together
before she goes off to college.

554
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,001
Crusher.

555
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,606
- Gosh, ours just went last year.
- Yeah.

556
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,963
It was just as
depressing as Idaho.

557
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,170
Yeah, the silence
was unbearable.

558
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,320
I mean, the house was like
a cold tomb of loneliness.

559
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,885
Anyway...

560
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,803
- I would get so sad.
- Honey.

561
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,529
When you would leave for work,

562
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,649
I would just fire up the Sarah
McLachlan, walk into her closet

563
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,087
and smell the sweaters
that she left behind.

564
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,240
Yeah, I smell them. I
smell the sweaters.

565
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,363
Well, at least I have this
little angel to get me through.

566
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,440
I mean, can you imagine

567
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,249
- trying to get through it alone?
- No, I couldn't do it.

568
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,240
- Could not do it.
- I could never do that alone.

569
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,082
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

570
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,329
Can't wait to meet your wife.

571
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,890
- Yeah, that'd be terrific.
- Yeah.

572
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,327
- Vegas, baby!
- Let's hit the tables!

573
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,009
Have her call me if you want to
get her nails done or whatever.

574
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,206
All right.

575
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,641
Problem?

576
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,886
They've already upgraded the lock on Mr.
Van Gogh to the dual control.

577
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,967
You said the upgrades weren't
scheduled till tomorrow.

578
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,361
Because that is what the
security e-mail said.

579
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,401
Now, I do have a
guy on the inside

580
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,841
who was supposed to alert
me if the schedule changed.

581
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,285
Obviously, he didn't.

582
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,806
Options.

583
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,087
We disable both controls
at the exact same moment

584
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,685
with a thermal lance.
Now, it can be done,

585
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,444
but that's gonna push us back.

586
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,489
Okay. Let's switch out all the other
pieces before the rest get upgraded.

587
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,164
Then we can focus
on the van Gogh.

588
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,961
It's number one on our buyer's list,
and I am not leaving without it.

589
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,925
Everybody listen up.

590
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,801
We're going now.

591
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,520
Now, we're leaving the
van Gogh for last,

592
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,131
so Nadia will coordinate
the new order.

593
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,488
They say Las Vegas has the
best security in the world.

594
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,449
Well, we're about to find out.

595
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,763
Bring me your guy on the inside.

596
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,884
- What'd I do?
- You don't get it.

597
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,200
- You just do not get it.
- Get what?

598
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,805
I said you had nice
hair and nice teeth.

599
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,770
- Officer needs assistance.
- Don't you get it?

600
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,481
You smell like peat moss and curry,
and I think I'm gonna throw up.

601
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,369
You don't want to
go out with me?

602
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,241
Whoa. Seems to me like two nice people
are trying to board the peace train,

603
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,004
but she seems to have derailed.

604
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,331
Look, this hairy, drunk rent-a-cop
confused "go away" for "hit on me."

605
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,129
- Hey...
- Ma'am, Officer Panero here,

606
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,646
who, in my professional
opinion, doesn't seem drunk,

607
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,405
has at least three years'
training in distress recognition.

608
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,802
I'm sure he sensed that an
attractive lady sitting by herself

609
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,360
most likely seemed a bit lonely.

610
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,047
So before you retreat behind
that wall we all put up,

611
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,489
just know that Officer
Panero was here for you.

612
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,325
Maybe I overreacted.

613
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,727
And he's giving the
keynote tonight.

614
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,402
- Pleasure to be here.
- He's blotto.

615
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,880
Sort of like someone's
mother last Columbus Day.

616
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,287
Will you let it go? It
was a half box of wine.

617
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,445
She's very patriotic.

618
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,603
Well, there's no way
Panero can go on.

619
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,810
We need a leader right now that can
step up, take the reins and inspire us.

620
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,927
I understand.

621
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,561
I tried contacting Officer Ferguson from
TSA, but he must have his phone off.

622
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,806
I mean, my hands are tied.

623
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,841
Paul?

624
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,806
Can you step up to the
plate and save us?

625
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,601
I'm gonna need my dress whites.

626
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,681
Come on.

627
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,042
- Your uniform, as requested, Officer Blart.
- Thank you very much.

628
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,131
Here you go.

629
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,966
I am the general manager of this
resort, so I don't take tips.

630
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,202
And I don't normally deliver
dry cleaning either,

631
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,129
but I just... I
wanted to clarify

632
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,811
that I was not making
advances towards you earlier,

633
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,962
nor would I, ever.

634
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,081
Look, I understand you
have no control over this.

635
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,484
Integrity is a bewitching gumbo,

636
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,848
but I'm preparing now,
internally, to give the keynote.

637
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,570
So if you don't mind, okay?

638
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,642
Look, this is crazy.

639
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,402
I'm actually dating someone.

640
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,166
Please, ma'am, I practically
invented the fake boyfriend thing.

641
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,401
What?

642
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,041
Listen, you have no bearing
on my life whatsoever.

643
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,363
Your lip is sweating.
It's sweating.

644
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,161
There is an audience out there
of security professionals

645
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,325
that paid good money
to hear you speak.

646
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,885
They want to hear you.

647
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,965
That's not true. They didn't pay
anything, but they do deserve your best.

648
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,724
They deserve it.
They deserve it.

649
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,404
Yeah, come on, man.

650
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,642
Just loosen up, baby, loosen up.

651
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,131
Coming at you! I'm
gonna be coming.

652
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,043
Bring it to them,
bring it to them.

653
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,249
I'm getting tight.
I'm getting tight.

654
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,970
I can't breathe, man.

655
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,651
That's orange chicken.

656
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,848
What am I gonna say?
What am I gonna say?

657
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,924
I got to get air. I got to
get air, I got to get air.

658
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,604
I got to get some air.

659
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,284
I got to get air,
I got to get air.

660
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,931
This is nice.

661
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,968
And pulse back in range.

662
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,046
Okay.

663
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,125
Thank you.

664
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,251
Get out of here.

665
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,201
All right.

666
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,282
Hey! Nope, nope, move along.

667
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,649
Get away. Move along.

668
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,925
Get away from me. Hefeweizen!

669
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,045
Get out of here!

670
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,365
Get out of here.

671
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,880
Get out!

672
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,761
My God!

673
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,603
Is there someone you can call?

674
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,328
Can you help me? Can
you call backup?

675
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,809
I hurt my neck, I hurt my neck.

676
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,801
Okay.

677
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,405
Hey, thanks for all your help.

678
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,849
There you are.

679
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,207
- We're about to announce you.
- Okay.

680
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,927
Come on, Maya.

681
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,210
Thanks.

682
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,123
Cool party. Whose suite is this?

683
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,089
The housekeepers are all
good friends of mine.

684
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,084
They let me know when the high
rollers check out early, so...

685
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,484
- You okay?
- Yeah. Everything's great.

686
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,924
I'll be right back. I
got something for you.

687
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,650
I think you're gonna like it.

688
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,446
Yeah!

689
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,760
Very kind, very kind.

690
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,561
Ladies and gentlemen, I know
you're here to see Nick Panero

691
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,608
deliver the keynote speech.

692
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,208
However, due to circumstances
beyond our control,

693
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,170
we've had to bring in a
different speaker tonight.

694
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,082
Yeah, I know, I'm
disappointed, too.

695
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,209
So, instead, how about a
nice, warm Expo welcome

696
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,726
for Officer Paul Blart.

697
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,441
Thank you, Officer Gundermutt.

698
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,206
Is it warm in here,

699
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,568
or am I ordering my next uniform
from Rochester Big and Humid?

700
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,962
I am honored to be here,

701
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,168
in the presence of the
greats from the past.

702
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,407
Just looking at these faces reminds me
of the questions so many people ask.

703
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,685
Why do we do it?

704
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,525
Why walk a beat knowing
that on a typical day

705
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,683
you'll get zero
pats on the back?

706
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,011
But you know what you will get?

707
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,923
A whole lot of ridicule.

708
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,364
What are you doing here?

709
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,283
I thought Mini Kiss was playing.

710
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,560
What are you doing here?

711
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,166
I get it. We're easy targets.

712
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,689
People call us heavy,
skinny, lumpy.

713
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,683
They point out our bad skin.

714
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,401
What is it that we
all have in common?

715
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,644
In the words of Joseph Conrad,

716
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,167
who wrote some really long
books about sailing and stuff,

717
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,160
"We live as we dream."

718
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,530
"Alone."

719
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,526
<i>Turns out I am giving
</i> the keynote after all,

720
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,206
<i>so it'd mean a lot</i> if you
could be there, peanut.

721
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,085
You were supposed to tell me

722
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,525
- if the schedule got moved.
- Let's calm down.

723
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,170
And no one told me anything.

724
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,050
I'm sorry. Bye.

725
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,251
Get her.

726
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,131
And yet, when people ask
me, "Why do you do it?"

727
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,611
I have to laugh.

728
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,929
'Cause they think
I have a choice.

729
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,526
I don't.

730
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,568
I, like you, didn't
choose security.

731
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,849
Security chose me!

732
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,449
Every morning, I pull my
pants on one leg at a time,

733
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,170
and I slip on my
soft-soled shoes,

734
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,083
and I hear the same
calling you do.

735
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,041
"Help someone today."

736
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,207
Come on, Dad.

737
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,450
"Help someone today."

738
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,124
Sounds easy, doesn't it?

739
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,407
But if being a security officer
was easy, anybody could do it.

740
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,086
Anyone can do it.

741
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,244
Takes a certain breed.

742
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,247
Someone who has Spidey-senses
when things are going wrong.

743
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,129
Sure, you can meet all kinds of
people in this line of work.

744
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,964
Your shoplifters,
your pickpockets,

745
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,164
your freeloaders

746
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,602
stealing a nap in a
Brookstone massage chair.

747
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,843
- They're the worst.
- Don't get me started.

748
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,527
And there's the old lady who can't
find her car in Parking Level F

749
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,490
'cause she doesn't have a car.

750
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,449
And there is no Parking Level F.

751
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,803
It only goes up to D.

752
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,520
And all of a sudden
you're asking yourself,

753
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,291
"Why do I do it?"

754
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,367
Till the little boy, tears in his
eyes, is tugging on your sleeve.

755
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,487
He says to you,

756
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,522
"Mister, mister, mister."

757
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,169
"Can't find my mommy."

758
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,924
That's why you do it.

759
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,161
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

760
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,569
I Will close with this.

761
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,690
If you believe the purpose of
life is to only serve yourself,

762
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,922
then you have no purpose.

763
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,401
Help someone today!

764
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,524
- Jackpot!
- You nailed it! You nailed it!

765
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,284
Way to 90, Blart!

766
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,169
You go, Paul Blart!

767
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,649
Maya, look, I know
you're mad at me.

768
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,768
<i>- Dad!</i>
- But hear me out.

769
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,121
<i>- Look, I feel just terrible.</i>
- I <i>need</i> your <i>help!</i>

770
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,362
Yeah, and I need your help.
This is what I'm trying to say.

771
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,205
Dad! I saw something in
the Presidential Suite

772
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,850
I guess I wasn't
supposed to see.

773
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,809
<i>- And now they're after me.</i>
- Who?

774
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,881
I don't know.

775
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,407
Angel, please don't worry. I know
exactly what you're dealing with.

776
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,369
It was just somebody
trying to intimidate you.

777
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,084
Trust me, they're all
bark and no bite.

778
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,527
They're coming for me!

779
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,929
Misread it. Okay, sweetheart.

780
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,650
Stay on the phone with me.
I'm on my way!

781
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,170
Maya, use your pepper spray!

782
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,649
<i>Maya, Maya, what's happening?</i>

783
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,520
Maya?

784
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,802
- Maya!
- Thank you.

785
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,002
- Who <i>is this?</i>
- This is Officer Paul Blart

786
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,162
from the West Orange Pavilion Mall.
Who am I speaking with?

787
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,401
Don't you worry about that.

788
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,640
Well, that's not fair. I
already told you my name.

789
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,564
- Now, where's my daughter?
- Your daughter.

790
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,490
Wow, you don't know when to
shut your mouth, do you?

791
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,568
Listen, I don't think you have a
clue to who you're messing with.

792
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,689
Actually, I don't need a clue.
You just told me.

793
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,445
And if you decide to
go to the real cops,

794
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,281
attempt to track this cell phone or
make any attempt to come after me,

795
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,129
boy, I am so crazy,

796
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,851
I'll put you and your
daughter in a world of pain.

797
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,528
Yeah? Well, here's a few things
you don't know about me.

798
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,331
First off, pain is my
copilot, so no problem there.

799
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,606
And second off...

800
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,123
Hello. Hello?

801
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,121
Hello? Hello?

802
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,281
Strange. Okay, let's go.

803
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,881
Get rid of this.

804
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,323
Hey, Yo, have you
guys seen Maya?

805
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,324
- Who's Maya?
- I introduced you to her.

806
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,402
She was the girl I was
talking to right over there.

807
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,245
Dude, he's hammered. She was on
the phone and went that way.

808
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,600
- That way?
- Yeah.

809
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,521
Enjoy-

810
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,446
Maya?

811
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,285
Maya?

812
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,525
Maya?

813
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,810
Looking for someone?

814
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,249
Okay, clear this place out.

815
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,368
This location's
been compromised.

816
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,488
Bring those two to the villa.

817
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,805
<i>Sugar.</i>

818
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,641
<i>Sugar.</i>

819
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,611
Daddy, look at the beautiful flowers.
Can I draw on them?

820
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,286
Not now, honey. Daddy's on the phone.
Go with Mommy.

821
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:00,766
Must get sugar.

822
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,770
Come on, sugar.

823
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,525
- Please, sir, please.
- Just let us out.

824
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,602
We're not gonna cause any trouble.
We're not gonna say anything.

825
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,842
- Please, sir. Please.
- Sir, please let us out!

826
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,204
- What the heck is going on?
- I think they're stealing art from the hotel.

827
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,601
- From the what?
- From the hotel.

828
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,841
- What is that?
- I got this for you.

829
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,560
Here. It's either
this or sunblock.

830
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,527
Maya.

831
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,201
Have sweet mercy! Oh, my!

832
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,885
I am so sorry, ma'am.

833
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,440
Nope, my fault. I startled you.

834
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,402
- I just feel terrible.
- No. I deserved it.

835
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,563
Can I help you up or get you
some medical attention?

836
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,721
Not necessary.

837
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,486
This just shifts the focus
away from my arthritis.

838
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,844
- You're sure?
- I'm fine.

839
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,086
- Are you gonna want turndown service?
- No, thank you!

840
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,610
Officer, how can I help you?

841
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,569
I need to know who's staying
in your Presidential Suite.

842
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,801
Okay, first of all, you need
to slow things down a bit.

843
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,207
And, secondly, that's actually
against resort policy. So...

844
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,281
I got this, Heath.

845
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,402
Sir, I can help you down here.

846
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,001
Well, I guess I've
been overruled.

847
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,961
Now, what can I do for you?

848
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,487
I need information on who's staying in
your Presidential Suite. It's urgent.

849
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,086
- What's going on?
- I can't divulge that at this moment.

850
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,049
It's top secret stuff, okay?
Just...

851
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,404
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Blart,

852
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,847
but, unfortunately, I won't be
able to give you that information,

853
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,365
because it is against protocol.

854
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,250
See? I told you I feel
no admiration for you,

855
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,529
so sorry, there are
no special favors.

856
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,123
You're breathing in double time.

857
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,521
Just tell me who's
staying there.

858
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,203
I can't say no to you.

859
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,290
He's a high roller who books
his rooms through his company.

860
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,010
Norbertine Shipping out
of Hamburg, Germany.

861
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,206
Shipping. Thank you.

862
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,611
You're so...

863
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,924
Come on. No.

864
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,128
I think I can short this
and get us out of here.

865
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,849
Or maybe we should
just do what they say.

866
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,083
We've seen what they look like, Lane.
They're not gonna let us go.

867
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,644
- Can I help you?
- Hey.

868
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,531
Muhrtelle.

869
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,446
It's pronounced like
"turtle" or "girdle."

870
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,205
No, Muhrtelle. I got it right away.
I'm pretty good.

871
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,409
- Why are you back here?
- No, I'm from shipping, so...

872
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,130
- I'm from shipping.
- Yeah, I know.

873
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,409
I'm from corporate, so...

874
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,165
If you could give me a moment, I'd
like to place a telephone call.

875
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,368
No, no, no, no. No need, really.

876
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,761
Okay, actually, I'm...

877
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,764
I'm from Internal Affairs Shipping.
Yeah.

878
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,606
Corporate sent me here to check
up on you and your coworkers.

879
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,445
Random selection. No
need to get too nervous.

880
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,808
- Is it okay I eat my lunch?
- Sure, yeah. You might as well.

881
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,644
I'm just gonna fire some
questions at you, though,

882
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,291
vis-a-vis this particular
shipment here.

883
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,566
Now, where exactly did...

884
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,610
Wow, that is the brownest
banana I've ever seen.

885
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,401
That's borderline black. I wouldn't
eat that if I were you. That's...

886
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,329
You're eating it.
He's eating it.

887
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,323
I'm gonna throw up a
little bit, I think.

888
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,250
I think that's poison.

889
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,206
That's sickening.

890
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,728
Where did this ship from?

891
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,360
I don't know. Some man brought
a bunch of these down

892
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,209
from the Presidential Suite.

893
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,928
You mind opening it for me?

894
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,971
Internal Affairs, so I just...

895
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,370
Do you have any identification?

896
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,966
Don't you worry
about that, Turtle.

897
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,361
- I'll ask the questions here.
- Wait.

898
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,204
I want to ask a question.

899
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,525
What do you think you're
doing with that crate?

900
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,682
I was just simply
just checking that...

901
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,721
- Someone's messing with the shipment!
- Radio.

902
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,888
Unacceptable. Kill him.

903
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,610
A mall.

904
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,842
Home-court advantage.

905
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,566
Bingo.

906
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,641
Pain!

907
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,121
This is it. I'm going down.

908
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,766
Took care of some cop.

909
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,081
- For <i>good?</i>
- Don't worry about it. He's gone.

910
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,091
He sleeps with the fishes.
Literally.

911
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,527
Excellent.

912
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,849
Not today, death! Not today!

913
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,486
Sir.

914
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,327
We ask that guests dry off
before entering the casino.

915
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,528
Absolutely. I should
have thought of that.

916
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,284
Why don't you come with me, sir.
I'll get you a dry towel.

917
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,725
That would be great.

918
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,643
On second thought, I think
I'd rather air-dry.

919
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,926
Because you're not who
you say you are...

920
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,051
Ramos.

921
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,721
Excuse me?

922
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,401
The buttons on your
uniform are rivet brass,

923
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,482
made by Cintas uniform supply,

924
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,370
which stopped using that
particular type of metal,

925
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,489
due to humanitarian
reasons, 18 years ago.

926
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,528
Since there's no way
you're a day over 30,

927
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,807
and the Security Association
restricts the hiring

928
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,365
of anybody under the age of 18,

929
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,240
there is no way you are
a security guard here.

930
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,926
You're right.

931
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,200
Headbutt!

932
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,648
That's a very good defense.
One more!

933
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,241
I'm definitely done.
Not this time!

934
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,686
- That was the last one. You have my word.
- All right.

935
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,765
Hey, what's going on?

936
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,802
- Hey. Sorry. Guy's drunk.
- Well, Why'd you let him run off?

937
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,281
- I'll make sure I get him back to his room.
- You do that.

938
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,249
Security's been breached.

939
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,010
Of course.

940
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,048
Eduardo's in on it.

941
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,168
Fool me once, shame on me.

942
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,084
Fool me twice, shame on me.

943
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,167
No, that's me twice.
That doesn't work.

944
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,887
Hey!

945
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,450
Gosh. Come on.

946
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,001
Hey!

947
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,330
That's Paul Blart.

948
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,363
- I'd love to see you up there.
- I would if I had a good hamstring.

949
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,360
- I don't got a good hamstring.
- It's all right.

950
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,049
Who is this guy?
What's going on?

951
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,849
Sorry. Big man on a rope!

952
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,047
Sorry.

953
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,006
This whole thing's like a pool
inside, like an indoor pool.

954
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,127
- It's unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

955
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,170
Take a dip! Yeah!

956
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,730
Yeah! Sorry. Tuck and roll.

957
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,126
This ain't real.

958
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,445
Thank you, Paul!

959
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,127
What a guy!

960
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,120
Come on, man. I know
you're in here.

961
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,841
Okay.

962
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,290
It looks like we've come
to a fork in the road.

963
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,361
What?

964
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,601
A little too much club.

965
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,446
Okay.

966
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,685
There you go.

967
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,561
Yeah.

968
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,644
<i>- Ramos, it's Henk. Where are you?</i>
- Le RÃªve theater.

969
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,245
Some cop may be onto us.

970
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,165
Wait. Big guy? Mustache?
Snug pants?

971
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,402
<i>- Yeah, that's the one.</i>
- I thought he was dead.

972
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,642
- This guy's like a cockroach.
- Where are <i>you?</i>

973
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,051
<i>We're about to move the Botero.</i>

974
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,167
Roger that.

975
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,846
Henk, Ramos, Botero.

976
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,160
Who are these guys?

977
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,488
Come on, Paul, think for Maya.
Think!

978
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,409
<i>All this for stupid art.</i>

979
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,845
Who is Art?

980
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,924
Come on, think.

981
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,130
Windershins! It's about the art!

982
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,402
They're stealing art
from the hotel!

983
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,328
Ramos, this is Henk.

984
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,761
Did you get the new
locations yet?

985
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,481
Henk, you didn't tell
me where you are.

986
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,489
We're in the casino.
Stop calling me.

987
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,201
<i>- Vincent wants you, out.</i>
- Let the games <i>begin.</i>

988
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,806
Found our friend.

989
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,288
Didn't see it. Didn't see it.

990
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,850
That's clean glass. Okay.

991
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,801
- So?
- I'm gonna need about 20 minutes, Vincent.

992
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,765
Move as fast as you can.

993
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,290
No, no, no!

994
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,487
Vincent. Vincent, this is Henk.

995
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,166
- Where are <i>you?</i>
- Waiting for the van Gogh. Where are you?

996
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,770
I'm on my way.

997
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,205
I'm coming for you, Maya.

998
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,849
Could you press one, please?

999
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,882
- Good crowd tonight?
- Yeah.

1000
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,287
- Did you guys play <i>Bet"?</i>
- No.

1001
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,723
- Great hair.
- Thanks. It's not mine.

1002
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,210
- Told you we should play <i>Beth.</i>
- Not now, Frank!

1003
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,166
This hotel is solid.

1004
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,251
This gift is adorable, but...

1005
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,324
The globe lights up
with copper wiring.

1006
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,244
My father insists that I keep
an extra phone battery on me.

1007
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,246
Stand back.

1008
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,411
That should do it.

1009
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,886
Come on.

1010
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,567
<i>The helicopter is
fueled and ready.</i>

1011
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,564
Perfect. What are you doing?

1012
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,449
From the hotel gift basket.

1013
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,969
- What is that in your hand?
- Oatmeal cookie.

1014
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,168
I'm deathly allergic. What
are you trying to do to me?

1015
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,805
- Sorry.
- Get rid of it.

1016
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,125
- Double back.
- Doubling.

1017
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,489
We can't get out through there.

1018
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,762
- Pocketknife keychain. Just in case.
- In case what?

1019
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,241
I get kidnapped by bad
guys and held hostage.

1020
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,607
- It's happened before.
- What?

1021
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,128
Room 3402. Charge it, please.

1022
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,489
- Hey! Can you help us?
- Absolutely.

1023
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,451
Five more minutes, Vincent,
and then we are done.

1024
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,289
Secure the painting and
let's get out of here.

1025
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,488
We've got less than three
hours to meet our buyer.

1026
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,006
Roger that.

1027
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,085
All right, Vincent, since you
took something precious from me,

1028
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,891
I'm taking something
precious from you.

1029
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,367
It's a bad day to be bad people.

1030
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,688
Paul, <i>mi</i> amor!

1031
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,731
No!

1032
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,208
<i>- Van Gogh is traveling.</i>
- Excellent.

1033
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,851
I want the truck waiting
in JuÃ©rez in one hour.

1034
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,607
Yeah!

1035
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,285
Enjoy the ride.

1036
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,206
See you.

1037
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,730
Where's that phone?

1038
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:46,961
Come on.

1039
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,211
- Please tell me Blart is dead.
- Yeah, if <i>by</i> dead, you mean

1040
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,924
taking out your crew one by one,

1041
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,844
and being in possession of
one of your prize paintings.

1042
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,607
- Which one?
- I'm gonna say...

1043
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,809
- I don't know, sunflowers?
- That's a van <i>Gogh,</i> you <i>idiot.</i>

1044
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,885
Yeah, you know what? Well, it's van gone
if you don't ramp down the hurtful words.

1045
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,602
- What do you want?
- I want to make a <i>deal.</i>

1046
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,648
A swap. A trade.

1047
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,203
Suggesting we make an exchange.

1048
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,443
<i>- You see, I have the painting...</i>
- I <i>got it.</i>

1049
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,807
<i>Meet me at the
Grand Hall, alone.</i>

1050
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,081
Time to even the playing field.

1051
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,125
Come on, man.

1052
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,205
I'm sorry.

1053
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,481
You know what?

1054
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,130
I made my decision.

1055
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,170
If we live, I'm not
going to UCLA.

1056
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,889
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

1057
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,286
I can't abandon him.

1058
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,643
He's never been alone.

1059
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,291
We've always lived
with my grandma.

1060
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,249
Until a milk truck took
her to a better place.

1061
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,568
And then there was those
six days of marriage.

1062
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,800
I mean, he still sleeps
with a night light.

1063
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,887
Really?

1064
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,770
- Is that bad?
- No.

1065
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,683
No, a lot of people
are like that.

1066
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,524
Yeah, a lot of six-year-olds.

1067
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,806
You, come with me.

1068
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,211
Have Robinson take
him to the helipad.

1069
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,441
- Let's go.
- Maya.

1070
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,601
Let's go!

1071
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,683
- That's far enough.
- Maya, you okay?

1072
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,247
I'm okay.

1073
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,446
Well done, Blart.

1074
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,488
You thinned my manpower
significantly.

1075
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,921
Must be getting pretty...

1076
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,203
Lonely out there.

1077
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,481
You scared?

1078
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,287
Not following you.

1079
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,522
Your fear of being alone.

1080
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,289
- First your wife dumps you at the altar.
- Wrong.

1081
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,124
- She was with me six days.
- Great.

1082
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,969
So she got to sample
the merchandise

1083
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,530
and was glad she
kept her receipt.

1084
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,081
And then your mom

1085
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,281
kisses a bus.

1086
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,568
It was a milk truck, but
I'll give you that one.

1087
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,804
And now your daughter can't
wait to get away from you.

1088
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,041
That's not true, Dad.

1089
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,446
Well, she's following her
destiny, and I support it fully.

1090
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,491
Flag on the play, sloppy.

1091
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,122
She says you can't be alone

1092
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,722
and that you're doing everything
in your pathetic power

1093
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,245
to keep her under your thumb.

1094
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,290
- I didn't say that exactly, Dad.
- It's okay, sweetheart.

1095
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,365
See, Vincent, I'm
fiercely independent,

1096
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,647
yet I'm not a big
fan of being alone.

1097
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,486
I'm a contradiction.

1098
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,051
I told you I was crazy.

1099
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,808
And I told you that I'm crazy.

1100
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,805
You can't out-crazy me.

1101
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,406
My crazy will take your crazy,
shove it in a metal tube,

1102
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,448
fill it with rats,
then blowtorch it

1103
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,683
until the rats have no way to escape except
eating their way through your crazy.

1104
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,286
Wow. You are oblivious to
the avalanche of insanity

1105
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,486
I am about to unload.

1106
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,925
You don't know what
I will do to you!

1107
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,525
You don't know what
I'll do to you!

1108
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,922
I will spin around until I throw
up on you and your friends.

1109
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,451
I simply don't care!

1110
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,569
I'll stick your face in maple
syrup and make you sing gospel!

1111
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,130
How does that blow
your hair back, Blart?

1112
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,249
I will crawl inside you and
lay eggs like a baby spider!

1113
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,367
I welcome it!

1114
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,090
I've got two different
colored eyes!

1115
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,400
Shows you how I live my life!

1116
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,926
I will bring a folk guitar
to a pumpkin fight,

1117
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,207
because that's the way
I was brought up!

1118
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,490
Okay, you lost me
on that last one.

1119
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,688
Because that's how crazy I am!

1120
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,000
Now, give me back my daughter!

1121
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,525
Give me my painting!

1122
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,920
Pick it up. Pick it up
before he ruins it.

1123
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,726
Get back!

1124
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,483
Did you honestly think that
I was gonna be thwarted

1125
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,770
by some sweaty, sluggish
non-entity like yourself?

1126
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,730
"Non-entity."

1127
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,360
See, I knew you
couldn't be trusted,

1128
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,880
so I took out an
insurance policy.

1129
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,366
Allow me to introduce you
to a few of my associates.

1130
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,085
Gino Chizetti,

1131
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,845
Staten Island
Industrial Complex.

1132
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,003
Saul Gundermutt,

1133
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,686
Philadelphia Farmers' Market.

1134
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,610
Khan Mubi,

1135
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,523
King's Landing Walmart.

1136
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,003
And last but not least,

1137
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,727
Donna Ericone, Mall
of freaking America.

1138
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,130
You got to... You got
to fan out, guys.

1139
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,641
He can't see you.

1140
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,364
Fan it out, fan it out.

1141
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,489
You have your own superhero.

1142
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,686
What's with the cape?

1143
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,081
Why are you wearing
a cape, Khan?

1144
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,770
I came straight from a haircut.

1145
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,170
Vincent, you just
don't get it, do you?

1146
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,566
Fool me once, shame on you.

1147
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,041
Fool me twice, shame on me.

1148
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,406
Are you sure about that?

1149
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,165
You see, I have a little
insurance policy of my own.

1150
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,047
See, I thought I took
all of you out, what...

1151
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,171
Non-lethal. I get it now.

1152
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,566
Shame on you.

1153
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,441
We are trained to detect,
deter, observe, and report.

1154
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,764
But one day, six years ago,
a man did more than that.

1155
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,003
And I am that man!

1156
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,684
We are that man!

1157
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,850
And so I say to you, sir...

1158
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,485
Foot Locker!

1159
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,209
Give me the gun. Finish them.
Go!

1160
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,680
There's a lip on that carpet.

1161
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,690
Someone's gonna have to call
that in, get that changed, okay?

1162
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,048
Foot Locker!

1163
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,401
Dad!

1164
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,930
I'm going to the helipad!

1165
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,921
Saul! Help me! Help me!

1166
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,321
Get back here.

1167
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,530
What? What?

1168
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,360
- Oh, no.
- You couldn't stay out of the way, could you?

1169
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,562
Eduardo, I knew you
were part of this.

1170
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,047
How is it a man like you
could win the heart

1171
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,805
of a woman like Divina?

1172
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,288
What are you talking about?
My daughter's been kidnapped!

1173
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,407
- Come on, man!
- Look!

1174
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,080
We'll never get to them on time.

1175
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:18,245
Hey, Blart. I heard you
need a little backup.

1176
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,722
Fun fact for you, there's
no helipad up here.

1177
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,684
But there is over there.

1178
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,206
Got it.

1179
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,091
We don't have much time.

1180
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,602
- Thanks, Nick.
- No hard feelings.

1181
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,283
Hold on, Paul!

1182
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,203
Oh, boy.

1183
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,122
Do not look down!

1184
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,011
Don't look up, either!

1185
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,611
Knot jump!

1186
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,160
Coming in hot!

1187
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,485
Dad. Come on.

1188
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,161
Hey!

1189
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,565
You finish loading.
I'll finish this.

1190
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,166
UP YOU go, missy.

1191
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,207
All right, guys. Who
took my show hair?

1192
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,689
I think Maya's just
seen her future.

1193
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,765
Nice punch.

1194
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,566
Now, don't move.

1195
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,450
You don't move.

1196
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,764
Looks like we got ourselves
a sticky situation.

1197
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,207
That doesn't sound like something
that can be fixed here.

1198
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,850
- You done?
- I am.

1199
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,081
Great. So am I.

1200
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,809
Oatmeal!

1201
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,767
Always bet on Blart.

1202
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,726
Dad!

1203
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,922
<i>So Paul Blart hadn't
</i> officially peaked after all.

1204
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,486
<i>Eduardo and I got
past our differences.</i>

1205
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,530
<i>I told him that if he ever wanted
to go</i> where the real action was,

1206
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,683
<i>there would always be a job for him
</i> at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

1207
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,121
Officer Blart.

1208
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,609
<i>He turned me down immediately.</i>

1209
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,163
<i>But I did get to meet
the man himself...</i>

1210
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,207
Mr. Wynn.

1211
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,329
<i>Who was appreciative</i> that I
saved his art collection.

1212
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,531
<i>Very appreciative.</i>

1213
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,611
Holy crawfish!

1214
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,367
<i>With ail things going my way,</i> I figured
it was time to make a decision

1215
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,727
<i>that would change
my life forever.</i>

1216
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,881
Paul?

1217
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,721
You...

1218
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,570
- Look at me now.
- Yeah, okay.

1219
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,722
You are a fearless man,

1220
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,801
a loving father, a strange,

1221
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,725
misshapen superhero.

1222
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,201
- Thank you.
- And my heart is yours.

1223
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,691
Okay, Divina, listen
very intently.

1224
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:25,445
Some people think that holding
on is what makes one strong.

1225
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,564
But in reality,

1226
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,011
our only power is in letting go.

1227
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,045
But I love...

1228
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,210
That's just it.

1229
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:39,201
See, it's easy to fall in love, but
hard to find someone to catch you.

1230
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,486
Besides,

1231
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,121
you don't love me.

1232
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,161
- But I...
- What you love is the mystery.

1233
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,765
That's all I am to you.

1234
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,683
You know, I'm a lone cowboy.

1235
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,205
A renegade.

1236
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,850
A Rocky Mountain steed.

1237
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,649
But truth be told, Divina,
I'm none of those things.

1238
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,410
I'm a simple man.

1239
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,765
Now, the qualities you
seek, they're in him.

1240
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,610
That man, sitting right over there.
That man,

1241
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,561
just longing to catch... He's
crying right now, isn't he?

1242
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,251
Yep, he's Crying-

1243
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,045
That's a full-on cry.

1244
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,602
But he's the real deal, Divina.

1245
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,286
He swung in on a rope like
a knight in shining armor,

1246
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,045
and he rescued my daughter
and me, and he loves you.

1247
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,125
Now, go to him.

1248
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,041
Go.

1249
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,370
You're right.

1250
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,882
But don't kid
yourself, Paul Blart.

1251
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,561
You are a Rocky Mountain steed.

1252
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,251
That actually felt really good.

1253
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,402
I might have made a
colossal mistake.

1254
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,887
Colossal.

1255
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,570
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1256
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:58,929
<i>to commemorate his long
career</i> of undying loyalty,

1257
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,686
<i>honor, and acts of heroism,</i>

1258
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,766
<i>above and beyond
the call of duty,</i>

1259
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,041
<i>twice,</i>

1260
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:11,570
<i>the Security Officers Trade Association
</i> is proud to bestow on Officer Paul Blart

1261
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,971
<i>its highest</i>

1262
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,247
<i>and, really, only award,</i>

1263
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,402
<i>the Safety Medal of Honor.</i>

1264
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,890
<i>The road of life is hard.</i>

1265
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:25,121
<i>But once you reach the
top,</i> the view is amazing.

1266
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,725
Look, I've given it
a lot of thought.

1267
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:47,920
And I'm gonna be really happy

1268
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,281
at Central Jersey Applied
Technical Junior College.

1269
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,046
- Really?
- Yeah.

1270
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,043
So they don't have
a football team

1271
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,485
OF a campus.

1272
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,766
I mean, who cares?

1273
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:59,650
The last couple of days really
reracked my priorities.

1274
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,326
Well, if you want to stay home
with me and keep me company,

1275
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,847
maybe for a year or two until I
get settled, then I have to say,

1276
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,560
I think you're crazy.

1277
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,684
You're going to UCLA.

1278
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,130
And, besides...

1279
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,926
Holy crawfish!

1280
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,208
That's exactly what I said.
I said that.

1281
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,162
Now, go. Have fun.

1282
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,166
Not too much fun.

1283
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,131
All right.

1284
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:44,565
<i>But as for this renegade, some
of us are meant to ride alone.</i>

1285
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,051
<i>All by my--</i>

1286
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,526
<i>What do we have here?</i>

1287
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,205
- Hey!
- Sorry.

1288
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,165
You know what you just did?

1289
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,810
You jaywalked in a
business district, sir.

1290
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,928
Actually, it's "officer."

1291
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:40,971
I apologize.

1292
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,362
I should've recognized the steely-eyed
gaze of a fellow brother-in-arms.

1293
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,124
You're still giving me a ticket?

1294
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,281
Nope.

1295
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,685
I'm gonna give you
my phone number.

1296
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,042
In case you want to
grab a drink sometime.

1297
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,567
I don't drink.

1298
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,485
But I do ride!

1299
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,961
- Are you okay?
- Nope.

1300
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,368
But I've never been better.
