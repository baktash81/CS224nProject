<i>~ From now on ~</i>

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,650
<i>Okay, there are two things that</i>
<i>I remember about my childhood.</i>

30
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,330
<i>I just don't remember it</i>
<i>being this orange.</i>

31
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,860
<i>First, I remember being with my dad.</i>

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,110
<i>He would get these</i>
<i>far-off looks in his eye,</i>

33
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,610
<i>and he would say,</i>

34
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,970
<i>"Life doesn't always turn out</i>
<i>the way you plan."</i>

35
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,970
<i>I just wish I'd realized at the time</i>
<i>he was talking about my life.</i>

36
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,040
<i>But that never stopped us</i>
<i>from taking our adventures together.</i>

37
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,670
<i>He would pack up</i>
<i>our sometimes-working car,</i>

38
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,240
<i>and he would tell me amazing stories</i>
<i>about strange and exotic lands</i>

39
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,620
<i>as we headed off to exciting</i>
<i>destinations like Milwaukee.</i>

40
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,700
<i>It's amazing how exotic Wisconsin... isn't.</i>

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,570
<i>But my favorite memories</i>
<i>were the stories</i>

42
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,940
<i>that he would tell me about my mom.</i>

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,500
<i>He would take me to the church</i>
<i>where they got married,</i>

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,410
<i>and I'd beg him to tell me more</i>
<i>about the ceremony</i>

45
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,830
<i>and about my crazy Uncle Irwin,</i>

46
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,970
<i>who fell asleep</i>
<i>in the macaroni and cheese.</i>

47
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,400
<i>And I asked my dad when he</i>
<i>knew that he truly loved my mom.</i>

48
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,820
<i>And he said to me, "Lucy,</i>
<i>your mother gave me a special gift.</i>

49
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,240
<i>"She gave me the world."</i>

50
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,520
<i>Actually it was a globe with a light in it.</i>

51
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,120
<i>But for the romantic that he was,</i>
<i>it might as well have been the world.</i>

52
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,020
<i>Well, the first time I saw him,</i>

53
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,970
<i>he didn't exactly give me the world.</i>
<i>It was a dollar-fifty train token.</i>

54
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,510
<i>But I looked forward to it</i>
<i>every single day.</i>

55
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,120
<i>He started coming to my booth</i>
<i>between 8:01 and 8:15 every morning,</i>

56
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,680
<i>Monday through Friday,</i>
<i>and he was just perfect.</i>

57
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,270
<i>My Prince Charming.</i>

58
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,260
<i>Well, we've never actually spoken,</i>
<i>but I know someday we will.</i>

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,640
<i>I know it. I just know it.</i>

60
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,600
<i>And I know that someday</i>
<i>I will find a way to introduce myself,</i>

61
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,620
<i>and that's gonna be perfect.</i>

62
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,040
<i>Just like my prince.</i>

63
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,350
$45 for a Christmas tree
and they don't deliver?

64
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,910
You order $10 worth of chow chow mein
from Mr. Wong's,

65
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,180
they bring it to your door.

66
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,040
I should've gotten the blue spruce.
They're lighter.

67
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,960
Lucy!

68
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,710
Nature of claim,
Christmas tree through window.

69
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,710
How am I gonna put that on my insurance?

70
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,490
They're still pissed
about the fire we had

71
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,700
when Joe Jr. Barbecued in the stairwell.

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,160
- I missed that one.
- Great sausage.

73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,640
- Look, I'll pay for this.
- That's okay, Lucy.

74
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,130
My brother Julie's
in the glass business.

75
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,650
I almost forgot.
Merry Christmas.

76
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,410
Aw, Lucy.

77
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,350
You didn't have to do that.

78
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,930
Well, I wanted to.

79
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,770
I haven't even gotten
to my shopping yet.

80
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,150
Hey, Pop.

81
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,650
Can I give that bottle of Blue Nun

82
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,630
from cousin Ornella
to my probation officer?

83
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,790
Can't you see
we got some company?

84
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,090
- Say hello.
- Hello, Luce.

85
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,010
Nice...

86
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,490
Sweater.

87
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,850
- Thank you.
- It's over there.

88
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,150
Lucy, you're a nice girl.
Joe Jr.'s still single.

89
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,780
Yeah, it's a shocker.

90
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,440
What'll you have?

91
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,130
- The usual.
- What's that?

92
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,740
- Mustard, Coke.
- Lucy. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

93
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,700
- Hi, Jerry.
- I'm glad to find you here.

94
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,540
I was hoping you'd find me in Bermuda.

95
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,580
Bermuda?
That's good.

96
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,420
I am recommending you
for Employee of the Month.

97
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,890
The usual.

98
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,420
Really? I didn't know there was
an Employee of the Month.

99
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,570
Yeah.

100
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,590
"Supervisor Jerry Wallace
nominates Lucy Moderatz

101
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,740
"for Employee of the Month.

102
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,770
"Lucy is never tardy,
always works holidays,

103
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,310
"even if she has worked
the previous holiday.

104
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,150
"Just because she worked Thanksgiving,

"Lucy is willing to work Christmas, too."

106
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,250
Jerry, I'm not working Christmas.

107
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,330
You'll get a nice plaque
with the mayor's stamp on it.

108
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,370
- I didn't vote.
- You get to ride on a float.

109
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,950
- Saint Paddy's Day.
- I hate parades.

110
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,000
Did I mention extra holiday pay?

111
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,060
- I hate you.
- Lucy.

112
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,130
Look, Violet is sick
and Celeste can't switch

113
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,130
because she's got some big family thing.

114
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,130
And I promised my kids
I'd be there for them this year.

115
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,390
It stinks, Jerry.

116
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,820
I know it isn't fair,
and I can't make you do it.

117
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,770
But, Lucy, you're the only one...

118
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,450
Without family.

Hi.

a man was brought in...

- What's his name?
- I don't know it.

158

- I need to know his name.
- He's right there.

159
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,800
You don't know his name?
Why don't you...

160
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,830
- You can't go in.
- You can't go in there.

161
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,990
- You don't understand.
- You family?

162
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,050
- Family only.
- No, you don't understand.

163
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,920
- I was...
- You wait there.

164
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,980
Okay, guys, what do we got here?

165
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,230
I was gonna marry him.

166
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,570

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,970
- Let him hear your voice, hon.
- Okay.

170
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,180
Hi.

171
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,760
Everything is gonna be okay. I know it.
It's gonna be fine.

172
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,050
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

173
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,850
Is that the woman that saved his life?

174
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

175
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,910
It gets even better than that.
She's his fiancée.

176
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,400
Excuse me, ma'am.

177
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,570
I'm sorry, but I need to ask you
a few questions.

178
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,220
- Okay.
- Officer, may I interrupt you?

179
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,450
- Sure. I'll be right over there.
- Thank you.

180
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,250
- I'm Dr. Rubin.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

181
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,320
Don't tell me about passes.
Where the hell is he?

182
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,920
- Dad, don't embarrass me.
- He's so pale. Oh, my God.

183
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,250
- What is this?
- This is my son. How is he?

184
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,180
You can't come
bursting into this unit.

185
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,050
- He'll be all right, right? Right?
- What happened? What's going on?

186
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,140
- He's in a coma.
- On Christmas Day.

187
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,260
Jesus.

188
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,280
His vital signs are strong,
his brain waves are good.

189
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,020
- Brain waves?
- He's going to get through this.

190
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,290
- Are you a specialist?
- How did this happen?

191
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,130
He was pushed from the platform
at the train station.

192
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,410
Who's she?

193
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,950
- She's his fiancée.
- His fiancée?

194
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,740
- Yeah.
- Peter's fiancée?

195
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,410
- Peter's engaged?
- Yeah, I thought...

196
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,120
No, no, you don't understand.

197
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,920
I mean,
he would have told us, right?

198
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,130
Maybe he was busy.

199
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,310
Too busy to tell his own mother
he's getting married?

200
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,910
- Don't yell at him.
- I'm not yelling at him.

201
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,670
- If only Jack were here.
- Grandma?

202
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,260
- Is she okay?
- She's got a little heart problem.

203
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,020
She's had three attacks already.

204
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,540
They weren't attacks.
They were episodes.

205
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,860
- Nothing wrong with her hearing.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

206
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,520
What is she doing in here?

207
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,000
Hey, buddy, she saved his life.

208
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,130
You saved his life?

209
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,700
Yeah, yeah, but...

210
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,030
I thought he was pushed
off a train platform.

211
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,910
She jumped on the tracks.

212
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,140
You jumped on the tracks?

213
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,460
Doctor, it's supposed to be family only.

214
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,100
- She is family.
- She's the fiancée, you idiot.

215
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,920
- Look, I'm sorry, you don't understand.
- I'm awfully sorry.

216
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,360
We haven't seen him for a long time,
so we didn't know.

217
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,660
I always wanted him to find a nice girl.

218
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,030
I'm so glad he found you.

219
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,160
Peter.

220
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,660
- Why did you say that?
- Say what?

221
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,290
- I'm not his fiancée.
- Why did you tell me that you were?

222
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm not engaged.
I've never even spoken to the guy.

223
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,170
What? But downstairs you said...
You said you were gonna marry him.

224
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,920
I was talking to myself.

225
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,090
Well, next time you talk to yourself,

226
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,690
tell yourself you're single
and end the conversation.

227
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,890
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

228
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,560
She held me so tight.
You know, I couldn't tell her.

229
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,200
- I know.
- Excuse me, nurse.

230
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,190
- Is there a pharmacy in the hospital?
- What do you need?

231
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,610
Elsie, she wants nitroglycerin.

232
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,280
For her heart problem?

233
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,670
Problem?

234
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,210
Problems.

235
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,260
You know something,
I think you saved her life.

236
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,070
In fact, I think you saved
the whole family.

237
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,100
Bless you.

238
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,210
Why don't you come with me?
I'll take you down there.

239
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,920
So,

240
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,840
tell us how you met Peter.

241
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,790
Ma, she doesn't wanna
talk about that now, okay?

242
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,620
Why not?
Could use a nice story.

243
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,170
- How do you know it was nice?
- Of course it was nice.

244
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,630
Why shouldn't it be nice?

245
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,210
What about that other girl?
The one he met in the bar.

246
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,510
What's that got to do
with the price of eggs?

247
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,440
- Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
- Ox.

248
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,420
All I know is
she was pretty high and mighty

249
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,790
for someone named after breakfast meat.

250
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,120
Well, he has a nice girl now.

251
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,330
So did you steal him from Ashley?

252
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,090
I bet it was love at first sight. Right?

253
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,320
I have a sense about these things.

254
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,860
- Elsie, let her tell it.
- She is telling it.

255
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,240
I bet that he picked you up
in that fancy car of his...

256
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,220
What was it about him that,
you know, first struck you?

257
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,810
- It was his, smile.
- They're caps.

258
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,560
Six hundred bucks a tooth.

259
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,610
Well, we saw each other

260
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,570
and, he smiled.

261
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,450
And...

262
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,850
And I knew that my life
would never be the same.

263
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,580
So...

264
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,340
- Tomorrow night, 8:00.
- What?

265
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,760
I got <i>Ice Capades</i>.
I know a guy.

266
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,390
Hi.

267
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,150
Bet you're wondering what I'm doing
here in the middle of the night?

268
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,450
Well, I thought
I should introduce myself.

269
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,990
My name's Lucy.

270
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,210
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz.

271
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,840
Think you should know
your family thinks we're engaged.

272
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,840
Never been engaged before.
This is all very sudden for me.

273
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,980
What I really came here to tell you
was that

274
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,020
I didn't mean for this to happen.

275
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,490
I don't know what to do.

276
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,030
I mean, if you were awake,
I wouldn't be in this mess.

277
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,910
Oh, God.
Not that I'm blaming you. Sorry.

278
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,030
It's just that, you know,
when I was a kid,

279
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,200
I always imagined what I would be like,

280
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,720
or where I would be,
or what I would have when I got older.

281
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,390
And, you know, it was the normal stuff.

282
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,670
You know, I'd have a house and family
and things like that.

283
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,500
You know, not that I'm complaining
or anything,

284
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,940
because, you know, I have a cat.

285
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,360
I have an apartment.

286
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,990
Sole possession of the remote control.
That's very important.

287
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,910
It's just...

288
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,000
I never met anybody
that I could laugh with, you know?

289
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,050
Do you believe in love at first sight?

290
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,550
No, I bet you don't.
You're probably too sensible for that.

291
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,210
Or have you ever, like, seen somebody,

292
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,810
and you knew that if only that person
really knew you, they would...

293
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,750
Well, they would of course dump
the perfect model that they were with

294
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,820
and realize that you were the one
that they wanted to just grow old with.

295
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,750
Have you ever fallen in love with
somebody you haven't even talked to?

296
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,850
Have you ever been so alone you spend
the night confusing a man in a coma?

297
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,560
<i>Brian Lynch. Mr. Brian Lynch,</i>
<i>please call Amber Lynch at 2617.</i>

298
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,440
Oh, my God.

299
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,200
Bye.

300
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,730
- Lucy. We didn't know you were here.
- Hi.

301
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,150
- Hi.
- Hi.

302
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,980
- Were you here all night?
- Yeah.

303
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,590
You're like me.
I could always sleep anywhere.

304
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,510
And believe me, she has.

305
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,260
Way to go, Gram.

306
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,000
So how's Peter?

307
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,270
Well, he's got more color.

308
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
He has some color.
Looks like he has some color.

309
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,350
Yeah.

310
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,510
Well, I have to go,
so it was great to see you guys again.

311
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,940
- Why don't you tell her? Go on, tell her.
- Yeah.

312
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,910
We didn't get to celebrate Christmas,

313
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,660
so it would be nice if you could join us.

314
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,570
I would love to, but I can't.

315
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,490
- Jack's gonna be there.
- That's right. You haven't met Jack yet.

316
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,910
- No, not yet.
- He'll be so happy to meet you.

317
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,040
So you'll come tonight?

318
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,580
I really shouldn't,
because I have to work. I can't.

319
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,710
Look, here.
Put your phone number and address there.

320
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,590
Midge'll call you and talk you into it.

321
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,740
Okay.

322
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,190
Here's another card
for when you change your mind.

323
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,180
We're in the estate-furniture business.

324
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,360
We buy furniture from dead people.

325
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,440
Okay. All right, well, I have it, so bye.

326
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,580
- Bye, dear. See you later.
- Bye.

327
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,980
- Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
- What? What is this?

328
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,440
I'm sorry, Mrs. Callaghan.
These are your husband's things.

329
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,030
He's not my husband.

330
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,590
I'm sorry. Your fiancé.

331
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,680
You're Peter's fiancée?

332
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,590
- Okay.
- Dalton Clarke.

333
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,400
Colleague of Peter's
at Lubel, Parker, Jacobs and Fink.

334
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,760
- I have to go now.
- He's a great guy.

335
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,140
He's had a tough year.

336
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,150
What with the accident
last month and all.

337
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,980
- Accident?
- Well, of course it was an accident.

338
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,290
I mean, it wasn't my...
Did he tell you it was my fault?

339
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,880
We're playing basketball, all right?
I carry a pencil. I'm a lawyer, I do that.

340
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,660
- Okay.
- Jesus, what's he...

341
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,550
It's gonna be okay.

342
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,780
So, what's the big deal?

343
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,540
What's the big deal? Jerry, they
think I'm their future daughter-in-law.

344
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,530
And the grandmother,
she's got this heart thing.

345
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,090
If I tell the truth, she's gonna have
a heart attack and die,

346
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,440
and it's gonna be on my head.

347
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,550
Well, then, go along with it.

348
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,720
And when Peter comes out of the coma,

349
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,510
the family will be so happy,
they won't care that you lied to them.

350
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,780
They'll probably even thank you for it.

351
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,780
Just mustard.

352
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,650
Okay, what if he doesn't
come out of his coma?

353
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,440
Well, then who's to know?

354
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,960
- I don't know.
- Now, look, look. Lucy.

355
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,950
When my mother found out
I was getting married to my wife,

356
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,740
her intestines exploded.

357
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,620
- Oh, my God.
- Now, you tell them now,

358
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,970
you might as well shoot Grandma.

359
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,480
Come on, Mel. Mel...
Psst, psst, psst!

360
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,000
What am I doing?

361
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,710
Lucy.

362
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,950
- Hi, Saul. Hi.
- You made it?

363
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,720
- Yeah.
- How do you feel?

364
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,580
Okay. Okay.

365
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,720
Come on, keep me company for a while.
I don't like to smoke in the house.

366
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,890
- Listen, you want one?
- I'm trying to quit.

367
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,930
That's good.

368
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,890
Here, sit down.

369
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,670
They don't bother you, do they?

370
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,770
No, no, I'm fine.

371
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,820
Did you know
that I was Peter's godfather?

372
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,360
Really?
I thought you had to be Catholic for that.

373
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,370
Ox fudged it over.

374
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,500
He donated 50 folding chairs
to Father Shea's bingo night.

375
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,880
You know, being a godfather
is very important to Catholics.

376
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,950
It means you're practically
part of the family.

377
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,920
Well, you're lucky.

378
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,550
It's really important to have family
around this time of year.

379
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,220
Are you...

380
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,620
I mean, are your parents with you?

381
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,250
No, no.
My mom died when I was really young.

382
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,840
And a couple years ago, my dad got sick.

383
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,800
And we moved from Indiana to Chicago
so he could go to a research hospital.

384
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,240
Research.

385
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,600
A medical term for "very expensive"?

386
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,690
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I had to quit school
and then I started working for the CTA.

387
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,810
And about a year ago,

388
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,190
he decided he had had enough research,

389
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,210
and he passed away.

390
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,240
My wife of 51 years passed away
two years ago, February the 9th.

391
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,660
I'm sorry.

392
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,240
Yeah, it was a rough time for me.

393
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,180
- Yeah.
- But Ox got me through.

394
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,810
- You're good friends?
- The best.

395
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,360
Lucy, the Callaghans...

396
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,320
Well, they took me in
as part of their family.

397
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,740
I'd never let anyone hurt them.

398
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,410
Neither would I.

399
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,950
I believe you wouldn't.

400
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,960
Lucy?
You came?

401
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,280
Hi, Saul. This is great.
Okay, come on in, you two.

402
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,840
It's freezing out here.
Elsie made her eggnog.

403
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,760
- Word to the wise, drink soda.
- Okay.

404
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,850
Ox, Mom, look who's here.
Lucy came.

405
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,040
What a surprise.

406
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,790
- Hi, Mary.
- Come on in. It's cold out there.

407
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,340
Oh, sweetheart.

408
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,550
We've got the most wonderful dinner.

409
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,760
It smells so good.

410
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,910
Hi.

411
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,860
This is so beautiful.

412
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,020
- That's Peter on the right.
- He's so sweet.

413
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,360
Yeah, the squirrels.

414
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,130
Eggnog, everyone.

415
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,410
Ma, where are you?
I'm serving your eggnog.

416
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,420
I'm getting my camera.

417
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,530
Come on, everybody.
Get close to the tree.

418
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,390
Christmas pictures.

419
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,000
- Lucy, come on.
- Come on, Lucy.

420
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,020
- Let's go.
- I...

421
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,020
Watch the birdie.

422
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,020
Ma, take it again.
I blinked.

423
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,730
You're lucky. I'm blind.

424
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,680
Yeah, I love it.

425
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,410
- Excuse me.
- I don't drink anymore.

426
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,780
I don't drink any less either.

427
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,660
- Perhaps I should.
- You got me on that one.

428
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,230
Look at this.

429
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,150
More presents.
I'll take these two.

430
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,380
- What is this?
- Open it.

431
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,280
- What is that?
- Turn them over.

432
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,050
Pierced?
Really?

433
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,660
Oh, my God, thank you.

434
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,950
- We'll go to Wal-Mart on Monday.
- Thank you.

435
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,780
Don't thank me. If it was up to me,
I would've gotten you a Barbie.

436
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,280
- Did you like that?
- More presents.

437
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,100
- We hit the jackpot.
- Mom, this is for you.

438
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,090
"To Ox, from Uncle Al."

439
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,510
Who the hell is Uncle Al?

440
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,260
Uncle Al.
You know, Uncle Al from Buffalo.

441
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,710
- You remember Al.
- Uncle Al?

442
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,880
To Lucy, from Santa.

443
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,600
- You remember Uncle Al.
- Remember Al? He was here.

444
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,350
Yeah, that Uncle Al.

445
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,960
That was
a real good Christmas.

446
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,820
Seven bow ties, I bet.

447
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,880
- You shouldn't have.
- That's right, she made these.

448
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,120
The gold watch.
I love it.

449
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,480
Sweetheart, it's so expensive.

450
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,310
Gram, these are so great.
Thank you.

451
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,440
They're so pretty.

452
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,810
You remember Uncle Al,
don't you?

453
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,060
No. Yeah, yeah.
Well, he wasn't really uncle.

454
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,430
- I never got him anything.
- He had this moustache.

455
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,310
He was Daddy's friend, right?

456
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,540
- I know an Uncle Ed.
- No, Uncle Al.

457
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,640
<i>This is Callaghan.</i>

458
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,650
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you. Ciao.</i>

459
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,580
<i>Hi, it's Ashley.</i>

460
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,920
<i>Lisbon is absolutely gorgeous,</i>
<i>but I'm cutting my trip short,</i>

461
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,690
<i>because I have been doing</i>
<i>a lot of thinking,</i>

462
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,670
<i>and what the hey,</i>

463
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,440
<i>I will marry you.</i>

464
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,220
Jack.

465
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,980
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

466
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,230
Don't wake Lucy.

467
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,320
Who's Lucy?

468
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,950
Lucy's Peter fiancée.

469
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,100
No, that's not Peter's fiancée.

470
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,040
You haven't met her?

471
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,450
No.

472
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,120
Well, she's great.
You're gonna love her.

473
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,710
You know what, kid?
Maybe I'll stay the night.

474
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,780
Don't eat my cereal
in the morning.

475
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,450
So it's Mary's special cereal.

476
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,130
Last time you took
the toy surprise, remember?

477
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,090
Good morning.

478
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,630
Oh, God.

479
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,050
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

480
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,140
Good morning, Jack.

481
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,680
I guess I don't remember meeting you.

482
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,020
Well, it's probably because
we've never met.

483
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,020
That might have something to do with it.

484
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,720
Cab. I have to go.
I'm really late, because I have to go.

485
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,580
But it was nice to meet you, Jack.
So, bye.

486
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,690
- Lucy.
- Okay, look.

487
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,880
- I know that I...
- Hey.

488
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,090
Welcome to the family.

489
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,010
Thank you.

490
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,510
Bye.

491
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,760
We pray that the Lord's healing presence

492
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,740
will be felt by those who are sick
and by their families.

493
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,890
Especially Jo-Jo Goreki,
Peter Callaghan,

494
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,580
Craig Little and Peggy Dunne.

495
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,370
We pray to the Lord.

496
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,940
- Lord, hear our prayer.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

497
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,700
O, God, you call us to live as one family.

498
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,380
- Save us from...
- So who's this Lucy?

499
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,050
She's your brother's fiancée.

500
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,000
You'd think
if Peter were getting married,

501
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,180
he would have announced it
in the <i>Tribune</i>.

502
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,190
- We read the <i>Sun Times</i>. Amen.
- Amen.

503
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,050
So why did she sneak out this morning?

504
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,420
She has a job.

505
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,800
I like Mass better in Latin.

506
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,700
It's nicer when you don't know
what they're saying.

507
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,080
- Did you get the Bourbeau estate?
- Got it.

508
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,270
- What about Downey's?
- Got it.

509
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,170
- Himmelstein's?
- Yeah.

510
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,250
- Did you get Van Allan?
- Himmelstein's took too long.

511
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,610
- For Chrissake, Jack.
- Stop swearing.

512
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,820
Look, you're running the business now.

513
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,570
There's something I'd like to talk about.

514
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,040
- Talk about that later, okay?
- Talk about it now.

515
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,210
- He can't kill you in church.
- Will you please pipe down?

516
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,250
Hey, be nice, pally. We're in church.

517
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,880
- You're disrupting the Mass.
- Who made you the pope?

518
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,030
Ox.

519
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,940
How did Joe Kelly get to be a lector?

520
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,720
He takes marijuana.

521
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,870
Amen.

522
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,340
- Hi, Luce.
- Hi, Lucy.

523
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,740
Hi, Lucy.

524
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,650
Come on, you stupid wing nut.
Your mother's...

525
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,920
Excuse me, do you live here?

526
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,420
Live here?
I own this place.

527
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,930
Great. Well, then you would know
the woman that lives in 201.

528
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,100
Know her?
I'm dating her.

529
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,900
Very clean.

530
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,780
Kitty?

531
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,950
Kitty?
Rich kitty?

532
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,450
Come here. Mealtime.

533
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,370
Kitty, kitty, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty.

534
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,840
Kitty.

535
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,380
Kitty?

536
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,720
Food. Kitty, kitty, kitty. Come here.

537
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,770
Come here. Come on, honey.
Where are you?

538
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,070
I'm so sorry.

539
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,570
Nice shot.

540
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,690
I'll get you some ice. I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting anybody.

541
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,660
Hey, how'd you get in here?

542
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,370
Key?

543
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,110
Key.
You stay here a lot?

544
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,470
You know, feed the cat.

545
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,760
Peter doesn't have a cat.

546
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,220
Hello.
Hello, honey.

547
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,780
Fluffy.
Hello, Fluffy.

548
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,070
You must be so hungry.

549
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,790
Are you gonna get that?

550
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,670
No, I'm gonna let the machine get it.

551
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,960
Hello?

552
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,970
It's for you.

553
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,810
Hello.

554
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,320
Okay. Bye-bye.

555
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,480
That was the hospital.

556
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,620
They say it's customary for friends and
family to come down and give blood.

557
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,370
Let's go together.

558
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,120
You know what?
I think maybe we should take your truck.

559
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,160
No, we ought to take Peter's car.

560
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,310
Okay.

561
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,260
You know where it's parked, don't you?

562
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,980
Yeah, I... Yeah.

563
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,320
Hey, we'll have to get
your picture for the mantel.

564
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,280
- Of me?
- No, of you and Peter.

565
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,780
I'm not that photogenic.

566
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,480
I doubt that.

567
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,070
All right, now, I want you to sit here
and sip this or you'll get woozy.

568
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,780
When did you start seeing Peter?

569
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,750
September 17th.

570
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,050
- Three months. That's quick.
- You have no idea.

571
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,660
- That's fast. That's...
- Miss.

572
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,790
I'm fine.

573
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,330
- That's a fast engagement.
- Wait, I'm not finished.

574
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,480
I got it. I got it. I got it.

575
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,300
What the hell's he got a TV for?
He's in a coma for Chrissakes.

576
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,780
Ox. You know, he might hear you.

577
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,970
Then get him a radio.

578
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,640
Maybe he'd like us to sing to him.

579
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,330
Maybe Lucy knows his favorite song.

580
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,870
- Puff the Magic Dragon.
- Dragon.

581
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,460
Dragon.

582
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,000
Which one of the Three Stooges
was Peter's favorite?

583
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,630
- Curly.
- Curly.

584
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,250
- He's everybody's favorite.
- Well, I like Shemp.

585
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,000
- Favorite ice cream?
- Baskin-Robbins.

586
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,090
- Favorite baseball team?
- Chicago.

587
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,750
Cubs or White Sox?

588
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,730
What the heck is going on?

589
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,530
Why are you asking her
all these questions?

590
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,610
Don't ask me. Ask her boyfriend.

591
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,770
That isn't very funny, you know.

592
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:40,580
No, no. Not this boyfriend. Joe Fusco.

593
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,860
Joe Jr?

594
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,040
That's right.
Mr. Joe Fusco, Jr.

595
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,280
He said that you were intimate.

596
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,430
Yeah, well, he also said
he invented aluminum foil.

597
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,780
He's delusional.

598
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,620
He was very lucid when I talked to him.

599
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,700
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

600
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,440
- Ma, are you okay?
- You see what you did?

601
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,630
What did I do?

602
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,110
You know, if she wanted to prove it,
she'd prove it.

603
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,790
Peter has one testicle.

604
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,820
- No way.
- Way.

605
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,320
About a month ago,

606
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,910
there was an accident,
and he was playing basketball,

607
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,100
and his friend had a pencil
in his back pocket.

608
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,810
Maybe...

609
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,650
No.

610
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,780
Oh, no.

611
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,940
- Well, somebody's gotta look.
- Don't look at me.

612
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,640
- No.
- Yeah, maybe...

613
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,660
- Listen, it's not my...
- Okay, I'm his mother.

614
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,690
Oh, Ma.

615
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,960
Well, look at the bright side.

616
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,520
He's got more room in his Jockey shorts.

617
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,020
Ma.

618
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,500
- Who is it?
- What gives?

619
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,940
- You stood me up.
- For what?

620
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,990
- Our date.
- What date?

621
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,410
To the <i>Ice Capades</i>.
I had to eat your ticket.

622
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,280
I never said
I would go on a date with you.

623
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,620
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

624
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,970
- Did.
- Didn't.

625
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,350
- Who is it?
- Lucy, it's Saul.

626
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,050
- Oh, my God.
- What, are you two-timing Joe Jr?

627
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,920
I'm not two-timing.
I never one-timed.

628
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,220
- Hey, I'll fight the guy.
- Hey. Get in the closet.

629
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,240
- Not a word.
- Nice panties.

630
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,370
Hey.

631
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,080
I like boxer shorts, but I'll try these if...

632
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,150
- Sorry.
- Have you got company?

633
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,160
No, TV. It's on. Next door.

634
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,870
Do you want some coffee
or tea, or something?

635
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,180
No, no. Not a thing.

636
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,430
Lucy, there's something you should know.

637
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,180
What?

638
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,630
Well, the night you visited Peter,
I was outside the door.

639
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,440
I know the truth.

640
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,440
Sorry. You know,
you don't have to worry,

641
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,120
because I'm gonna tell them everything.

642
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,950
Don't tell them a thing.

643
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,440
You remember the day you said

644
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,220
you'd never do anything
to hurt the family?

645
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,660
- Yeah.
- Well, since they met you,

646
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,920
they figure they have Peter back.

647
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,670
Now, if you tell them the truth,
you'll take him away again.

648
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,720
They need you, Lucy.
Just like you need them.

649
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,270
Now, look, I know you're a good girl.

650
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
And I know you'll do the right thing.

651
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,980
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Yes, you will.

652
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,100
By the way, how did you know about the...

653
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,120
Peter, with the one...

654
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,620
You know something?
I don't wanna know.

655
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,670
Bye.

656
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,260
Oh, my God.
What are you... What?

657
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,090
- What are you doing?
- I slipped.

658
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,970
- You're trying on my shoes?
- No.

659
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,370
When I fell, my foot went

660
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,110
right into the shoe.

661
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,960
- Who is it?
- It's me, Jack Callaghan.

662
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,630
Oh, my God, doesn't anybody
use a phone anymore?

663
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,530
- I do.
- I'm not talking about 900 numbers.

664
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,070
Who told?

665
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,330
Hi. So, more questions?

666
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,750
No. I have an engagement present
for you.

667
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
You really shouldn't have.

668
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,050
I didn't.
It's from my parents.

669
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,010
It's furniture.
You want me to bring it up?

670
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,510
Hey, was that Saul I saw leaving?

671
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,560
What's that?

672
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,180
Cat.

673
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,140
Big cat?

674
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:34,110
I think you should bring it to...
Bring it to Peter's apartment.

675
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,260
- You don't know what it is.
- Well, you know,

676
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,910
anything would look nicer
in Peter's apartment.

677
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,990
You know what?
I'll come with you.

678
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,810
You know what?
I think you parked too...

679
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,340
You know, I think you parked
too close to the other car.

680
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,700
I had to. We gotta unload the furniture.

681
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,410
Ready for your surprise?

682
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,320
Ta-da!

683
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,710
That is great.
That is so great.

684
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,460
- You like that?
- Yeah.

685
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,470
Too bad. Ox bought you the love seat.

686
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,140
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. I made this.

687
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,270
- This? No, you didn't.
- Shocking, isn't it?

688
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,520
- Can I sit in it?
- Rock out.

689
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,990
My God, this is perfect.

690
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,320
You should go into business
or something.

691
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,120
Well, that gets tricky.

692
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,040
Yeah, working with your
dad and everything, right?

693
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,520
The business used to be called
Callaghan and Sons,

694
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,450
and when Peter went off to law school,
it became Callaghan and Son.

695
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:11,970
If I were to leave, it'll just be Callaghan.

696
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,100
Let's take a second here
and unlock the doors...

697
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,560
No, I got it, I got it. See?
Here we go.

698
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:29,240
This technique. It's always very...
A very modern technique.

699
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,220
Excuse me, sir.
What apartment?

700
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,370
57G.

701
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,330
Well, sir, I'm sorry, but guests
have to be announced, you know?

702
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,500
Well, I'm with her. I'm helping her.

703
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,500
- So?
- You don't know her?

704
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,210
No.

705
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,720
But I'm new here.

706
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,560
Well, she's Peter Callaghan's
fiancée in 57G.

707
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,850
Yeah.

708
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,480
They told me about her, sir.

709
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,760
She's scary.

710
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,190
Tell me about it.

711
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,270
Be careful.

712
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,660
Maybe we should angle it a little bit.

713
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,480
I think it's wedged.

714
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,790
Why don't you step back for a little bit?
I'm gonna try an old trick.

715
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,110
What's the trick?

716
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,420
Push it really hard.

717
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,170
Okay.

718
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,890
Okay, okay, push.

719
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,640
I did.

720
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,430
Do you want me to help you now?

721
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,150
- All right, a little help would be good.
- Okay.

722
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,650
Ready?
One, two, three.

723
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,870
I think the sofa should go right there.

724
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:07,720
Oh, no. No, no, no. Look at this.
Idiot has blocked me in.

725
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,100
- But I told you not to park that close.
- Aargh.

726
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,720
Hey, check the meter, see what time.

727
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,110
It's 6:00. They can pretty much stay
here all night if they wanted to.

728
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,360
All night?

729
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,890
Good night.

730
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,920
You're just gonna leave me here
with the truck?

731
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,770
Basically, yeah.

732
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,980
Well, maybe I ought to walk you back.

733
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,500
Well, what for?

734
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,710
- For protection.
- No, I'm fine. I'm okay.

735
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:39,090
For me. I don't wanna be here
by myself. This is Chicago.

736
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,050
You look cold.

737
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:54,250
- You look cold.
- Probably because I am cold.

738
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,500
How about you?

739
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,260
This jacket's reversible.
I'm wearing the warm side now.

740
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,610
I see.

741
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,360
You need a better coat.

742
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,160
- This is my dad's.
- Then he's probably freezing.

743
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,910
He passed away.

744
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,000
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

745
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:17,040
He passed away last year.
I don't even remember my mom, so...

746
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,410
Well, what was he like?

747
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:22,880
He was a lot like me.
Dark hair, flat chest.

748
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,040
What do you remember most about him?

749
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,020
That. Okay.
Well...

750
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,090
He liked maps.

751
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:36,190
Yeah, I live by maps.
My truck's filled with them.

752
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:40,090
He used to hear of a place on the TV,
we would pull out the atlas,

753
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:44,270
we'd find where it was and we'd route
out this, like, little way to get there.

754
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,700
If there was one place
in the world where you'd go...

755
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,240
Florence.

756
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,520
Italy? I haven't delivered
any furniture to Florence yet,

757
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,650
- but I'm told it's nice.
- Yeah.

758
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,490
I take it you've never been there.

759
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:59,550
Well, you know, the L doesn't exactly
make it all the way to Florence, so...

760
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,930
But I do have...

761
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:06,830
My passport.

762
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,670
- You have your passport? With you?
- Yes, I do.

763
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:12,130
Yes, well, just in case I need to
quickly leave the country.

764
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,520
- You need to...
- Yeah, it's perfect. It's great.

765
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,990
You're right.
You're not very photogenic at all.

766
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,950
Just joking.

767
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,780
There aren't any stamps in that.

768
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,150
Yeah, well, I haven't gone anywhere yet.

769
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,710
But, you know, I'm planning
the trip to Florence really soon,

770
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,750
so, you know, I'll go.

771
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,950
That'll make your dad very proud.

772
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:36,100
Yeah.

773
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:43,050
You know, in a very small way,
you kind of remind me of him a little bit.

774
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:45,730
I see.

775
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,870
So he was a classy guy,
always a gentleman.

776
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:49,970
A working man, who...

777
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,250
Who just stepped in doggy poopy.

778
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:57,740
Now, that's classy.
That's classy.

779
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,370
All right, tell me more.
Where did you grow up?

780
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,980
God, you've just become
Mr. Chatty this evening.

781
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,270
The fact is,
I'm about to start shivering,

782
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,000
and making conversation
keeps my face from freezing.

783
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,180
Thank you. I had a good time.

784
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,080
- It's slippery here. Come on.
- I'm fine.

785
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,180
We got this far,
I'll take you the rest of the way.

786
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,420
You gotta watch out. A little icy.

787
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,310
So you gonna go see Peter tomorrow?

788
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:35,680
- All right.
- Do not take me with you.

789
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,450
- No, it's all right. Not too bad.
- You got it? Good? Okay.

790
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,320
This is big.

791
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,090
- There we go. All right.
- Okay.

792
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,760
- All right?
- Yeah.

793
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,050
I think we're all right now.
Yeah. Let's just move this way.

794
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,450
This way.

795
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,220
- Whoa. Ow.
- Ow.

796
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,950
What was that?

797
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,100
Was that my pants or my muscles?

798
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,770
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

799
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,580
- Whoa.
- Okay.

800
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,710
Oh, man.

801
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,380
Do you have an extra pair of pants
in your apartment?

802
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,420
If you fit into my pants, I will kill myself.

803
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,240
- You don't have to follow me.
- No, you're blocking the wind.

804
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,100
I'll wait till you get inside.

805
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,860
Well, good night.

806
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,980
Night.

807
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,210
- I'll see you when I see you?
- Yeah.

808
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,960
All right, Lucy, it's either me or him.

809
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,110
Him.

810
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,490
You don't have to answer right away.

811
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,980
I'm having an affair.
I like Jack.

812
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,390
Who's Jack?

813
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:00,210
- Peter's brother.
- So?

814
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:02,550
- So he thinks I'm engaged.
- To who?

815
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,020
To Peter.

816
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:08,010
Lucy, I really don't have time for this.

817
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:11,400
Oh, no, no, no.
You have to tell me what to do.

818
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,700
Tell the truth.

819
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,290
If I tell Jack that I lied to his family,
he will never speak to me again.

820
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,770
And Ox and Midge and Mary and Saul.

821
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,290
Saul?
Who's Saul?

822
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:27,630
He's the next-door neighbor.
But you know what? Actually, he knows.

823
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,200
Lucy, you're born into a family.

824
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,800
You do not join them
like you do the Marines.

825
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,310
You have to tell me what to do.

826
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,730
Pull the plug.

827
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,310
- You are sick.
- I'm sick?

828
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,940
You're cheating on a vegetable.

829
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,900
Down and dirty.

830
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,280
Are you gonna fold?

831
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,910
You're not gonna fold?

832
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:58,500
He is staying in with a pair.

833
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,790
Very impressive. Very bold, confident.

834
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,420
Full house.

835
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,290
You are unlucky at cards.

836
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,550
But lucky in love.

837
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:19,100
Remember in, like, fifth or sixth grade,

838
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,900
I was starting to get
really good at poker,

839
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,740
and going home with lots of lunch money?

840
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,450
I got to know the principal's
office really well.

841
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,370
He always used to say to me,

842
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,000
"How come you can't be more
like your brother Peter?"

843
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:40,710
Well, you know what?
I was all right with that.

844
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:44,010
I had no problems with that,
because I was proud of you.

845
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:48,050
And I was never envious
of anything that you had.

846
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,060
Until now.

847
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,320
I'll cut the deck.

848
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,490
High card gets Lucy.

849
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,000
All right, we'll go best out of three.

850
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,150
So, Lucy, have you and Peter decided

851
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,200
where you're gonna go on your honeymoon?

852
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,880
I went to Cuba.

853
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,430
Ricky Ricardo was Cuban.

854
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,620
Didn't Peter look great today?

855
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,720
That kid.

856
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,300
You know, he should've been an actor.

857
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,420
He's tall.

858
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,270
All the great ones were tall.

859
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,770
Lucy, you think you can find me
a nice girl for Jack?

860
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,180
Mom, come on.

861
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,950
Well, I really don't know Jack's type,
so I'm not one to...

862
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,530
I like blonds. Chubby ones.

863
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:49,190
Alan Ladd wasn't tall.

864
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,540
Marshal Dillon was 6'5".

865
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,790
Well, we all know
who Lucy's type is.

866
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,960
These mashed potatoes are so creamy.

867
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,470
You like brunettes.

868
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,810
I could never make a good pot roast.

869
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,140
You need good beef.

870
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,390
Argentina has great beef.
Beef and Nazis.

871
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,640
John Wayne was tall.

872
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,770
Dustin Hoffman was 5'6".

873
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,780
Would you wanna see Dustin
Hoffman save the Alamo?

874
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,560
These mashed potatoes
are so creamy.

875
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,810
- Spain has good beef.
- Mary mashed them.

876
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,160
- Cesar Romero was tall.
- Cesar Romero was not Spanish.

877
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,330
I didn't say Cesar Romero was Spanish.

878
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:27,790
Well, what did you say?

879
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,480
I said Cesar Romero was tall.

880
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,970
- We all know he's tall.
- Well, that's what I said.

881
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,340
Cesar Romero was tall. That's all I said.

882
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,650
So if you need any help
with history, don't call me.

883
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:41,370
Now, remember, honey, if you're free
for New Year's, we wanna see you.

884
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:42,750
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

885
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,550
- I had a great time. Thank you.
- Us, too.

886
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,580
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Lucy.

887
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,210
Hey, look, you guys.
You're under the mistletoe.

888
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,550
- Kiss her then. It's mistletoe.
- Yeah.

889
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,370
- It's tradition.
- It's Christmas.

890
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,860
Come on, idiot, kiss her.

891
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,970
- There you go.
- Yeah.

892
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,690
- Good night.
- Bye.

893
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:05,900
Good night.

894
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,650
Mary,
we're on dish detail tonight.

895
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:08,870
- Let's go.
- Ma.

896
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,030
I don't wanna hear
any excuses.

897
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,550
Since the first year, I remember.

898
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,720
Regular fare.

899
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,690
One token, please.

900
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,840
My God, Mary, what are you doing here?

901
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,470
Hi. You wanna come through?

902
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,450
- We can?
- Yeah, absolutely.

903
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,560
Come on in.

904
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,330
Transfer, please.

905
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

906
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,940
Hey, who's this?

907
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,860
- I'm Mary. This is Beth.
- Hi.

908
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,440
Mary's my...

909
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,860
Lucy's going to marry my brother Peter.

910
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,500
What?
Lucy, you're getting married?

911
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,780
Well, it hasn't
really been announced.

912
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,740
So it's a little awkward for
me to say anything, and...

913
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,580
- The train is here.
- Train. Okay, I'll see you later.

914
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,590
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to meet you, Beth.

915
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,300
Girl, are you pregnant?

916
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,050
Yes, I'm pregnant, Celeste.

917
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,880
Lucy, you're not telling me
what's going on.

918
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,050
You're not giving me details.
What's going on?

919
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:14,560
Celeste, you have to have sex
in order to be pregnant.

920
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,240
But I thought you were engaged.

921
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,950
Well, we're waiting.

922
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,080
Waiting?

923
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,610
<i>Peter?</i>
<i>Hi, it's Ashley.</i>

924
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,170
<i>Is this machine working?</i>

925
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,780
<i>Look, I'm back in Chicago</i>

926
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,660
<i>and I'm kind of shocked</i>
<i>that you haven't called me back.</i>

927
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,580
<i>Look, I really would like to</i>
<i>hear from you,</i>

928
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,310
<i>and I'd like to see my cat. Call me.</i>

929
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,000
New Year's Eve hasn't been the same
since Guy Lombardo died.

930
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,880
I love a clarinet.

931
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,010
You know, nobody plays the clarinet
anymore.

932
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:50,030
Guy Lombardo didn't play the clarinet.

933
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,490
I didn't say Guy Lombardo
played the clarinet.

934
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,260
- Hey, Pop.
- Your Benny Goodman,

935
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,890
he could play the licorice stick.

936
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:58,100
- We got the Van Allan estate.
- Hey, way to go.

937
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,390
- Attaboy.
- That's great.

938
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,360
- That's great. Attaboy.
- Way to go.

939
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,040
Hey, everybody.

940
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,920
Lucy's pregnant.

941
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:08,160
How did you find out?
What do you mean she's pregnant?

942
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,200
- How do you know?
- That's what Beth said.

943
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,370
Jack, do you know anything about this?

944
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:13,520
Go up to your room.

945
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,680
- Who is it?
- Joe Jr.

946
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,350
I'm not here.

947
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,310
I know that trick.

948
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,010
Hey, my old man's got a set of keys.

949
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:29,780
That is illegal and you know it, Joey.

950
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,270
Ta-da!

951
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,910
I told them to give me the same ones

952
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,540
they use in the winner's circle
at Arlington.

953
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,540
They're beautiful.

954
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,910
I can't accept them.

955
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,710
I could move in here.

956
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:46,530
I bet you Pop would knock
50 bucks off the rent.

957
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,900
I have six months left to live.

958
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,710
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

959
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,210
It's that other guy, isn't it?

960
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,580
What do you mean?

961
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,790
I've seen the way you look at him.

962
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,550
What?
How do I look at him?

963
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,870
Like you just seen your first Trans Am.

964
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,400
Here, take them.

965
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,740
You can lay them on my coffin.

966
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,080
Thank you.

967
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,210
Are you wearing the black bra?

968
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:27,550
I love black underwears.

969
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,190
Jack.

970
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,060
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

971
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:43,180
You're going to a party.

972
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,260
Yeah, my friend Celeste
is having a party tonight.

973
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,480
Great. Hey, I'll drive you.

974
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:50,010
You know what?
It's really not that far. It's fine.

975
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,910
No, come on, come on.

976
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,000
Okay, but it's really not that far.

977
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:57,460
I move a lot of things with this truck.

978
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,990
So is everything okay?

979
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:01,780
Why?
Why wouldn't it be okay?

980
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,530
You're just acting really weird.

981
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,650
- No, I'm not being weird.
- Yes, you are.

982
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,690
No, I'm not being weird.

983
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:11,310
- So, what about Peter?
- What about Peter?

984
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,340
Peter is going to have a lot
to deal with when he wakes up.

985
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,350
- Lucy, hi. How are you?
- Hi.

986
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,090
Come in, come in. Hey, everybody.

987
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,150
Lucy and her fiancé are here.

988
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:26,110
- Lucy. How's it going?
- Jerry, you know Peter, right?

989
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,530
Thank you. Hi. Take his coat, Cindy.

990
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,480
- Is this Peter?
- I gotta talk to you.

991
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,850
Well, jeez, he looks good.

992
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,340
That's not Peter, that's Jack.

993
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,900
- Who's Jack again?
- Peter's brother.

994
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,030
- Peter's the guy who's in the coma?
- Yeah.

995
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,490
So then why did you bring Jack?

996
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,530
I didn't bring Jack. He followed me here.

997
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:45,450
- So Jack's the fiancé?
- No, Peter.

998
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:47,040
Peter doesn't even know you exist.

999
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,540
- I know.
- So Jack is Peter?

1000
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,640
Yeah.

1001
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,040
- Lucy.
- Yeah?

1002
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,900
They have doctors for this kind of thing.

1003
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,070
Hey.

1004
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:00,760
- That's spiked.
- Thank God.

1005
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,930
- You shouldn't have any.
- Why not?

1006
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,530
Because it's not good for the baby.

1007
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,740
Wait a minute, will you?

1008
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,860
- It's freezing.
- Watch out, watch out.

1009
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,980
This whole evening did not work out
well at all, and...

1010
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,040
And I'm supposed to share
some responsibility in that?

1011
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:21,520
No. Would you slow down a little bit?

1012
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:25,800
Look, it was just a misunderstanding,

1013
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,600
and on top of the Joe Jr. Thing...

1014
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,780
Excuse me?

1015
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,060
It's nothing.

1016
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,160
No, no, no, there's no nothing now.
What Joe Jr. Thing?

1017
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,020
The leaning thing.

1018
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,400
The leaning thing?

1019
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,830
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1020
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:45,450
What do you mean by the leaning...
Because he gave me flowers?

1021
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,660
And then you leaned.

1022
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,950
- And then I leaned.
- Yeah.

1023
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:52,240
Okay. How did I lean when I leaned?

1024
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,580
- How were you leaning?
- Yeah.

1025
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,210
It was a lot different than hugging.
Hugging's very different.

1026
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:59,230
Hugging, that involves arms and hands,

1027
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,780
and leaning is whole bodies
moving in like this.

1028
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,400
Leaning involves wanting

1029
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:12,490
and accepting, leaning.

1030
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,960
Hey, Luce.

1031
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:19,670
Is this guy bothering you?

1032
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,900
No, no.

1033
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,550
Are you sure?
Because it looks like he's leaning.

1034
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,310
Thank you. See?

1035
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,960
I'll be right over here
if you need me.

1036
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,110
Okay, thank you very much.

1037
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,000
I know karate.

1038
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,710
Okay, is...

1039
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:50,270
Now, all right,
what about the other thing?

1040
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:52,880
The other thing?
The other misunderstanding?

1041
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,420
Why did you think I was pregnant?

1042
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,050
Well, Mary said that she had heard
something like that.

1043
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,970
And you believed her?

1044
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:04,090
I didn't have any reason
not to believe her.

1045
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:07,610
So the only reason your brother
would wanna marry someone like me

1046
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,000
is if I was pregnant, right?

1047
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,550
No, no.

1048
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,850
Good night.

1049
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,150
The fact is,
you're not really Peter's type.

1050
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:22,900
Yeah, Jack? All right.
Whose type am I?

1051
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:28,790
- Thank you.
- Look, it's a great idea, you and Peter.

1052
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,990
It's just not obvious
to the whole world, that's all.

1053
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,830
You know what, Jack?
I've had a really lousy Christmas.

1054
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,590
You've just managed
to kill my New Year's.

1055
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:38,410
If you come back on Easter,
you can burn down my apartment.

1056
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:41,840
- Hey, come on, Lucy.
- What do you want from me, Jack?

1057
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,200
I want you not to be unhappy.

1058
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,370
And what are you,
the happiness guru, Jack?

1059
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:47,470
Are you happy?

1060
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:50,380
I don't remember you having
had a conversation with your father.

1061
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,120
You wanna leave the business, don't you?

1062
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:55,220
Is this just another miscommunication
that we are having here?

1063
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,050
What do you know about my family?

1064
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,330
Spending a week with them
does not make you an expert.

1065
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:02,200
Spending a lifetime with them
hasn't made you one either.

1066
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:08,730
Yeah, well, I know that keeping
your family happy gets complicated.

1067
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:11,860
Would your father be happy knowing
you're sitting in a token booth

1068
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,130
planning vacations
that you aren't taking?

1069
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,220
No, he wouldn't. You're right.

1070
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,720
But you have no idea
what it's like to be alone.

1071
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,230
Hey, you have Peter.

1072
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,520
I don't have anybody.

1073
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,180
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1074
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,780
Good night.

1075
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,990
Happy New Year!

1076
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,940
Happy New Year!

1077
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,680
<i>~ For auld lang syne, my dear ~</i>

1078
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:57,140

1082
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,970
Ox, they called me
and told me to get down here.

1083
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,070
- What happened?
- He's awake.

1084
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:20,900
<i>Will the Meyers family</i>
<i>please meet in the solarium?</i>

1085
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,700
- Boy, will he be glad to see you.
- Yeah.

1086
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,500
Peter.

1087
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,700
Peter.

1088
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:32,420
Your family's here, Peter.

1089
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:11,840
Who are you?

1090
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,580
My God.

1091
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,350
He's got amnesia.

1092
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,140
Lacunar amnesia is a condition

1093
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,130
in which memory loss
is localized and patchy.

1094
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:36,620
Limited to isolated events.

1095
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,810
- Selective amnesia?
- Okay, exactly.

1096
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:45,290
I'm sorry. I need to tell you
something that is really important.

1097
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,710
- I was never...
- Pregnant?

1098
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:52,180
We know. Jack called us.

1099
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:55,600
- Jack.
- Hey, so he's come out of it?

1100
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:57,580
I'm so glad you're here, honey.

1101
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,730
Excuse me, Doctor?
He's up again.

1102
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,500
All right, let's go.

1103
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,060
Jack.
I'm so glad you're here.

1104
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:06,970
- Saul.
- Now, now, listen. Let me handle it.

1105
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:09,930
I'm too old a friend and too old a person
for them to kill.

1106
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:11,680
- I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

1107
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,520
- And I'll do it right now. Come on.
- Okay.

1108
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,180
I'm right behind you.

1109
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,040
- How you feeling, champ?
- I don't know.

1110
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,120
Hi.

1111
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,840
Hey, remember her?

1112
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,550
- Should I?
- Look closely.

1113
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,170
She looks a little familiar.

1114
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,880
- Why?
- I think it's coming back.

1115
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:41,050
- I think so.
- What's coming back? Tell me.

1116
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:43,520
- Tell me. What?
- Peter, you have amnesia.

1117
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:45,070
I do?

1118
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:47,610
Peter, you're engaged.

1119
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:49,970
- To who?
- To Lucy.

1120
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:52,410
Lucy. Who's Lucy?

1121
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,100
You don't remember, do you?

1122
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,170
Excuse me.
Got some Jell-O for you today.

1123
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,590
Do I like Jell-O?

1124
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,400
I think he's had enough excitement
for one evening.

1125
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,610
- Let's all go home.
- Hang in there, champ.

1126
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:07,330
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Mom.

1127
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:10,290
- It's so good to see you.
- Mom.

1128
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:12,910
- He looks so good, you know?
- He's going to be fine.

1129
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,670
- I think he looked wonderful.
- All right, we'll be back.

1130
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,770
Jack, you, too. Come on.
Let's go home.

1131
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,880
Saul, where have you been?

1132
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,840
What?
I'm not allowed to go to the bathroom?

1133
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,890
- Saul.
- I'm handling it.

1134
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:27,760
- I will tell them.
- When? When?

1135
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:28,860
On my golden anniversary?

1136
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,930
- Lucy, I'll tell them.
- You better tell them.

1137
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,880
I said I'd tell them.

1138
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:36,120
<i>~ A, B, C, D, E, F, G ~</i>

1139
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,040
Jack, you've been really great
this week.

1140
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,210
Yeah, like when I accused
you of lying to everybody.

1141
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:23,720
Or when I accused you
of having a relationship with Joe Jr.

1142
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:28,600
Or when I thought you were pregnant,
and I announced it to all your friends.

1143
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,060
You've had a really busy week
this week, haven't you?

1144
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,770
Look, Jack, I...

1145
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:43,360
Starting tomorrow, things are
probably gonna be kind of different.

1146
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:45,950
Yeah.

1147
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:51,440
I just wanted you to know
that you've become

1148
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,050
a really good friend.

1149
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,180
Okay.

1150
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:07,100
Good friend.

1151
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,100
- Lucy.
- Yeah?

1152
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:15,300
I didn't mean what I said
about you and Peter.

1153
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,360
I think you two are gonna
make a really terrific couple.

1154
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,240
And I'm really glad
that you won't be alone anymore.

1155
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:30,150
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1156
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,430
Jack?
Is that you?

1157
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:24,640
Hey, Pop.

1158
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,650
- Brought you some donuts.
- You're a savior.

1159
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,950
Your mother's got me eating
these fat-free bran muffins.

1160
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:34,950
They taste like plywood.

1161
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,020
Catching up?

1162
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,240
It's been almost a week
since I read the obituaries.

1163
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,960
You know, we missed a lot of good
stuff the day after Christmas.

1164
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,380
Been a hell of a week, hasn't it?

1165
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:51,630
Life is a pain in the ass. I'll tell you.

1166
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:55,850
You know, you work hard,
try to provide for the family,

1167
01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:00,270
and then for one minute,
everything's good.

1168
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:04,860
Everyone's well, everyone's happy.

1169
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:08,070
In that one minute, you have peace.

1170
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,360
Pop.

1171
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,570
This isn't that minute.

1172
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:17,620
What do you mean?

1173
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,050
You remember that rocking chair
I made for Grandma?

1174
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,740
Are you kidding me?

1175
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,880
It's so fancy, she won't even sit in it.

1176
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:32,410
This fancy chair, two months ago,
I sold three just like it.

1177
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,600
I've sold two dining tables.
I got orders for six more.

1178
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,940
Well, that's a good side business.

1179
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:41,910
It's not a side business.
This is good business.

1180
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,780
Wait a second.

1181
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,400
You don't want my business?

1182
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,160
No, I don't.

1183
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:05,090
- How long have you felt this way?
- A long time.

1184
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,630
Well, why didn't you say
something sooner?

1185
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,850
I could have sold the whole damn thing
to Uncle Eddy for twice its value.

1186
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,390
I could have taken your mother on
the cruise with Kathie Lee Gifford.

1187
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,770
You're not mad at me?

1188
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,770
Are you nuts?

1189
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:26,110
You are nuts.
You wanna make rocking chairs.

1190
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:31,410
Hey, Mrs. Fletcher finally went?

1191
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:34,310
Her dining room alone
has got to be worth 40 grand.

1192
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:36,560
Yeah.
Those McMurphy boys,

1193
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,900
they were moving in
before the deed was done.

1194
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,650
That's their problem. They're too pushy.

1195
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,120
- They're pushy, aren't they?
- We'll call them next week.

1196
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,840
You call them next week.

1197
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:48,140
That's right, I'll call them next week.

1198
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,270
Yeah.

1199
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:51,860
- Do I get a donut?
- I'm sorry.

1200
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,250
22, 10, 40.
Eighth-grade locker combination.

1201
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:58,010
Birth date, 3-11-59.

1202
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,670
You have to remember Lucy.

1203
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:02,930
Social security number, 144-60-6894.

1204
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:06,400
You love her. You just don't remember.

1205
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:09,450
Three-point-seven-three grade point
average, Northwestern University.

1206
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,040
Can I talk to Peter alone?

1207
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:14,540
- Everything okay, Saul?
- Senior class president, 1981.

1208
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,410
I just wanna talk to my godson.

1209
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,900
- Let me take that for you.
- Thanks.

1210
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,850
- We'll be back.
- We'll see you later.

1211
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,240
- You sure, Saul?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

1212
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:23,990
- See you, son.
- See you, Dad.

1213
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,590
Peter, I've known you
since you were born.

1214
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:32,800
I've been to every major event
in your life from Cub Scouts to...

1215
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,140
Well, to the day you discovered
hair on your schmeckel.

1216
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:39,440
You've got a good education.

1217
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,000
You're very popular
with all those friends of yours.

1218
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:44,100
You make a nice living.

1219
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,030
And everybody knows
you're a good-looking kid.

1220
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,530
But, Peter, you're a putz.

1221
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,660
Excuse me?

1222
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,520
Now, look, I'm your godfather.
I mean, I love you.

1223
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:59,290
I couldn't love you any more
if you were my own son.

1224
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:03,130
But the fact of the matter is you're...

1225
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,800
Well, you're a putz.

1226
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:08,130
Is there a point to this?

1227
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:10,010
Lucy.

1228
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,980
Peter, there's something
you have to know about her.

1229
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:18,770
You see, she...

1230
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,690
Well...

1231
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,030
She's...

1232
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,700
You know...

1233
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,310
She's not only your fiancée,
she's your guardian angel.

1234
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:38,710
Yeah.
Peter, she saved your life.

1235
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,840
Now, she's coming to see you today,

1236
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,960
and I want you to do yourself a favor.

1237
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,800
I want you to look deeply into her eyes
and listen with the heart of a man

1238
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,220
who has just been given
a second chance at life.

1239
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:54,930
And after two minutes,
if you're not madly in love with her,

1240
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:57,810
why, tell her you wanna break up.

1241
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,230
And you can go back to being a putz.

1242
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,030
But if in the two minutes,

1243
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:04,860
you see what the rest of us
only took seconds to see,

1244
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:08,220
you will propose to her
for the second time,

1245
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,080
and marry her
before she has a chance to escape.

1246
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:18,570
Before she comes, take a little time

1247
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:22,240
and think about
what an old putz just told you.

1248
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,760
All right?

1249
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,970
You know, if I was 40 years younger,
I'd marry her myself.

1250
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,520
That is, if she'd convert.

1251
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,770
- Hey, that's a joke.
- I know.

1252
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,340
Lucy.

1253
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:02,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

1254
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:08,770
I came to bring you back your things.

1255
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,810
Would you like a sandwich?

1256
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,110
No, no. I'm okay, thanks.

1257
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,480
Can I get you anything?

1258
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,240
I wish I had my own clothes.

1259
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,490
Well, I like your blue pinstripe.

1260
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:23,950
- Double-breasted?
- Yeah.

1261
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,560
- That's my favorite.
- Really?

1262
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:26,710
Yeah.

1263
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:30,400
Please sit down.

1264
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:45,870
I saw a picture of you
when you saved the three squirrels.

1265
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,920
They never call, they never write.

1266
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:50,780
That was a long time ago.

1267
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,510
Yeah, I guess we don't get to do
many heroic things as an adult.

1268
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,640
That's for sure.

1269
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,550
You do, though.

1270
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:02,270
No. Jumping in front of
that train was unusual.

1271
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,440
I don't think I've done anything
truly heroic my whole life.

1272
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,360
I chased a purse snatcher once.

1273
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,240
Well, that's something.

1274
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:13,200
I pretended to pull a hamstring.

1275
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:17,650
Well, most guys probably wouldn't have
chased after him in the first place.

1276
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,880
I mean, I work at the L.
Believe me, I know.

1277
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,170
You give up your seat
every day in the train.

1278
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:25,800
Well...

1279
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:28,180
That's not heroic.

1280
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,720
It is to the person who sits in it.

1281
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,020
And you always gave me something
to look forward to every day, so...

1282
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,940
You know, you do remind me of someone.

1283
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:43,740
It's probably you.

1284
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:55,410
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.
What apartment?

1285
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,840
- You're new.
- Yes, ma'am. What apartment?

1286
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,740
I'm going to Peter Callaghan's
apartment.

1287
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,450
And your name, please?

1288
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:06,430
Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
I am Peter's fiancée.

1289
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,510
You're not his fiancée.

1290
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:14,880
Hey, looking good.

1291
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:17,130
Yeah, well, they're moving
me to the second floor.

1292
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:19,470
Great. Mind if I drove?

1293
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:21,800
No problem. See you by the elevators.

1294
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,280
All right. Okay. There we go.

1295
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,220
It's a little drafty.

1296
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,910
Here, I brought you some contraband.

1297
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:33,540
Chocolate peanut butter. Thanks.

1298
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,110
Hey, Lucy's pretty terrific, isn't she?

1299
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:38,630
- Yeah.
- We're engaged, you know.

1300
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:41,380
Yeah, I heard that.

1301
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,280
Now, this, I remember.

1302
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:47,560
Everything is better.
Everything looks better, feels better.

1303
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:50,850
Even this chocolate peanut
butter tastes better.

1304
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,600
Good. It's fudge mint.

1305
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:56,400
Whatever. I'm reborn.

1306
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,300
If you were a priest right now,
I'd confess everything to you.

1307
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,880
No, no, don't confess.
I'm trying to be positive right now.

1308
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:03,310
Just eat your ice cream.

1309
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:05,940
I don't know what my secretary
sent Mom and Dad for Christmas.

1310
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,120
It was a fruit basket.
Now, look, I don't wanna...

1311
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,600
- I've never been faithful.
- I'm gonna leave.

1312
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:12,830
Remember the squirrels?

1313
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,170
Don't even say it.

1314
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:19,340
First I knocked them out
of their nest with a rock.

1315
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,840
Peter.

1316
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,550
Then I saved them.

1317
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:26,620
Did you say any of this to Lucy?

1318
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,420
That was in the past.
I'm making a clean start with Lucy.

1319
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,770
She is... She is... She...

1320
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:38,190
What is she?
She's...

1321
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:41,720
I'd say that she gets under your skin
as soon as you meet her.

1322
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,060
She drives you so nuts,

1323
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,200
you don't know whether to hug her
or just really arm-wrestle her.

1324
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:51,670
She would go all the way to Europe
just to get a stamp in her passport.

1325
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,530
I don't know if that amounts to insanity

1326
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:58,420
or just being really, really likeable.

1327
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,890
No, that's not it.

1328
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:06,560
But she's gotta be really special.
She's gotta be.

1329
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,150
And I can spend the rest of my life
finding out why.

1330
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,730
I don't have to know now,
I don't have to know tomorrow.

1331
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:17,650
I don't have to know in a year,
or 10 years.

1332
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:19,830
I don't have to...

1333
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:21,870
I don't have to have
all the answers today, or...

1334
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:23,230
Maybe someday I'll have a clue,

1335
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:27,080
but it doesn't mean I can't
make a lifetime commitment.

1336
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,210
Does this make any sense?

1337
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:33,750
Not really, but that's
common after a head injury.

1338
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:35,590
My shoes.

1339
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:40,260
- Hi.
- What'd they say?

1340
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:43,430
- Who?
- The Callaghans. Are they inside?

1341
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:44,970
You missed them.

1342
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:47,580
Well, what was their reaction
to the news?

1343
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,510
- I didn't tell them yet.
- What do you mean, Saul?

1344
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:53,510
- Now, what about Peter?
- Well, I didn't tell him either.

1345
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:55,280
What?
You said you were gonna handle this.

1346
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,970
- I'll handle it.
- This is handling it?

1347
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,520
- This is handling it.
- Saul.

1348
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,700
- What?
- You're fired.

1349
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,290
Fired?

1350
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,040
- Sorry.
- Pardon me.

1351
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,050
- Two, please.
- Four, please.

1352
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:29,130
<i>Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.</i>

1353
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:32,900
<i>Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.</i>

1354
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,990
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1355
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:37,950
- Ashley.
- Scumbag.

1356
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,370
You're engaged?

1357
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:45,480
May I remind you
that you proposed to me?

1358
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,380
You said no. We broke up.

1359
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:50,860
No, no. I was confused.
We stepped back.

1360
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,320
You moved to Portugal.

1361
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,870
Yes, well, I didn't think
you were going to run out

1362
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,330
and marry the first bimbo
that you came across.

1363
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:58,770
Lucy's not a bimbo.

1364
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,110
Lucy?
Lucy who?

1365
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:03,300
I don't remember.

1366
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,750
Liar.

1367
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:09,690
I don't remember proposing.
I was in a coma, I have amnesia.

1368
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:12,860
Amnesia?
Well, now, that's rich.

1369
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:15,600
All right, fine.
I want my stuff back.

1370
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,750
Fine.

1371
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,160
- Then I want my stuff back.
- What stuff?

1372
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,700
Your nose.

1373
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:23,480
You can't take my nose back.

1374
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:24,880
I paid for it.

1375
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:27,710
Well, then here. You paid for these, too.

1376
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:31,510
Keep them. I'm a changed man, Ashley.

1377
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:37,810
Go ahead. Go ahead and marry her,
you one-balled bastard.

1378
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:46,780
Holy buckets, Peter.
Moving on to greener pastures.

1379
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:48,610
Yeah.

1380
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,240
You got it, pal.

1381
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,930
- So we should come back later?
- Yes, the doctor...

1382
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,060
- Lucy, they moved him.
- They moved him?

1383
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,200
Come with me, downstairs.

1384
01:25:58,110 --> 01:25:59,210
Lucy.

1385
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:00,920
What?

1386
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:03,820
- Lucy.
- Hi, Peter.

1387
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,060
My God, you look really good.

1388
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,710
I feel really good. You know what?

1389
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,840
Facing death makes a man
evaluate his life.

1390
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,940
And I've been thinking about mine
and haven't liked what I've seen.

1391
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,600
I've seen a man who has
courtside tickets to the Bulls,

1392
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,940
a lucrative investment portfolio.

1393
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:22,170
An apartment
on la rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.

1394
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:24,020
- Where?
- Paris.

1395
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,310
But I've also seen a man
who has no one to trust,

1396
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,280
no one to wanna have a son with.

1397
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:31,950
You were there when I needed
someone the most.

1398
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:34,160
You gave me a second chance at life.

1399
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:39,280
It took a coma to wake me up.
My family loves you.

1400
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:42,250
I might as well love you.

1401
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,560
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz,

1402
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:47,290
will you marry me?

1403
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:52,050
Wanda?
Wanda, are you all right?

1404
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:54,810
Honey?
Wanda?

1405
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,210
Your hair is looking
very big tonight.

1406
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:00,300
Why, thank you.
I love your new cologne.

1407
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,010
Yeah, it's called Paris Guy.
It's from France.

1408
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:04,200
- Nice.
- How you doing?

1409
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,610
- Hey, are you going to see Lucy?
- Yeah.

1410
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:10,350
She is the best-looking chick
in this building.

1411
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:11,500
Hey.

1412
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:17,020
But you are the best-looking chick
on the third floor.

1413
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,580
- Joe Jr.
- Phyllis.

1414
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,390
No?
This one?

1415
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:29,970
This one?

1416
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,460
I don't want any flowers from you,

1417
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,670
I am not wearing black underwear,

1418
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:39,480
and I definitely do not wanna
move in with you...

1419
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:41,940
Jack.

1420
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,050
Well, I don't have any flowers,

1421
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:45,880
I wouldn't mind
seeing the black underwear,

1422
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:49,130
but under the circumstances, I don't
think we should move in together.

1423
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,130
- I thought you were Joe Jr.
- I get that a lot.

1424
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:01,340
Do you wanna come in?

1425
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:02,720
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1426
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,890
Wow. So that's the wedding dress?

1427
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:15,940
The wedding dress.

1428
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:19,820
It works good as a tie, too.

1429
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,700
Yeah.

1430
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:25,480
I just wanted to give you this

1431
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:28,240
before all the presents
started to pile up.

1432
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:32,110
I was dropping off some
furniture in Little Italy,

1433
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:34,170
I look in a window, and...

1434
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:41,640
Florence.

1435
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,060
Thank you. It's really beautiful.

1436
01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:56,480
And I wanted to say that I think that

1437
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,780
Peter is a very lucky guy.

1438
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:05,230
Thank you.

1439
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:07,950
I had to say that because
you're gonna be my sister-in-law.

1440
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,870
Ha, ha, ha.

1441
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,960
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other then.

1442
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,050
- I'd better get going.
- Yeah.

1443
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:27,270
Hey, Jack?

1444
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,640
- Jack.
- Yeah?

1445
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:36,070
Can you give me any reason
why I shouldn't marry your brother?

1446
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:44,410
I can't.

1447
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:09,210
- What's this?
- It's a wedding invitation.

1448
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:13,020
Wait a minute.
This is your wedding invitation.

1449
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,360
So?

1450
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,610
Whom are we marrying?

1451
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,740
Jerry, Peter Callaghan.

1452
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,520
The coma guy?
Are you insane?

1453
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:25,150
Yes, Jerry, I'm insane.

1454
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:28,520
Every day I go and I sit in a booth
like a veal.

1455
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:32,100
I work every holiday, I go home to a cat.

1456
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,480
And now a rich and handsome man
has asked me to marry him,

1457
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:36,690
and I have said yes.

1458
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:39,940
Okay, okay, that makes me
a raving, total lunatic.

1459
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,070
The wedding is tomorrow, Lucy.

1460
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:45,410
I know it's tomorrow, Jerry.
But I even wish it were yesterday.

1461
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:48,810
That would mean that today
that I would be on my honeymoon,

1462
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:51,170
that I would finally have a stamp
in my passport,

1463
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:53,520
and that it would say Italy on it.

1464
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:58,900
What happened with the other guy?

1465
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,140
He didn't want me.

1466
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:19,930
- Maybe she forgot.
- A woman doesn't forget her wedding.

1467
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,850
Maybe she's stuck in traffic.

1468
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,580
- This isn't... Does this look ridiculous?
- No, you look fine.

1469
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:27,800
- All right. Well, you got the rings?
- Yeah, I got the rings.

1470
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,840
What's the matter with you, Jack?

1471
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,690
You suck.

1472
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:36,570
I suck or the outfit sucks?

1473
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:38,490
It's a toss-up.

1474
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:40,450
What do you mean?

1475
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:45,450
Here she is.

1476
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,380
She's a little nervous.

1477
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:12,110
She's lovely.

1478
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:40,040
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join...

1479
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,480
I object.

1480
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:46,900
I didn't get to that part yet.

1481
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:50,030
I would have to object, too.

1482
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:52,450
What about you?

1483
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:56,030
- I'm thinking.
- What the hell is going on?

1484
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:03,040
I am in love with your son.

1485
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:06,670
- I know.
- Not that one.

1486
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,840
That one.

1487
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:13,080
Jack, what the hell did you do?

1488
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,330
He didn't do anything.
He didn't do anything.

1489
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:18,520
It was me. It was all me.

1490
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:22,020
Elsie, how are you doing?
You doing okay?

1491
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:26,800
Do you remember
that day at the hospital?

1492
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,870
Of course you remember
that day at the hospital.

1493
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:31,560
Well, there was a little mix-up.

1494
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:35,870
I saw Peter get pushed onto the tracks,
and I saved his life.

1495
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:39,310
But when I got to the hospital,
they wouldn't let me see him,

1496
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:45,050
so someone told the doctor
that I was his fiancée.

1497
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:47,030
Only...

1498
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:49,880
It's not true.

1499
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,060
I was never engaged to Peter.

1500
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,070
Why didn't you say something?

1501
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:06,320
Because I didn't know how to tell you.

1502
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:11,360
We never even met
until that day on the tracks.

1503
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,520
It's just when we were
in the hospital room,

1504
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:17,690
everything happened so fast,
and I couldn't tell you the truth.

1505
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:20,280
And then I didn't wanna
tell you the truth,

1506
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:23,630
because the truth was that

1507
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,270
I fell in love with you.

1508
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,930
You fell in love with me?

1509
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:32,430
No. No. Yes. All of you.

1510
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:38,190
I went from being all alone
to being a fiancée,

1511
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:42,690
a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister,

1512
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:45,240
and a friend.

1513
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:49,100
I might have saved your life
on the tracks, but you know what?

1514
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,120
You really saved mine.

1515
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:54,200
You allowed me
to be a part of your family.

1516
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,120
And I haven't had that
in a really long time.

1517
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,460
And I just didn't wanna let go of that.

1518
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:06,500
So even though
it was just for a little while,

1519
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,640
I will love them always.

1520
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,140
I'm very sorry.

1521
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:21,230
And I'm very sorry about your carpet.

1522
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,640
What about my carpet?

1523
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:29,100
Peter Callaghan is engaged to me.

1524
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,830
I object to this wedding.

1525
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:32,170
Get in line.

1526
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:33,980
And I object to your objection.

1527
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,150
Who's that?

1528
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,630
Ashley's husband.

1529
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:39,250
You proposed to a married woman?

1530
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:43,170
Yes, and I was in a coma
when my brother makes a play for my...

1531
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:44,950
Sort of my fiancée.

1532
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:48,260
- Peter, how could you do this?
- Listen, a deal is a deal.

1533
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:51,020
You two are better off together.

1534
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,100
Stop yelling.

1535
01:35:56,590 --> 01:35:57,690
Hey.

1536
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:00,360
Hold on.
Hold on, just hold it right there.

1537
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:25,390
Hey, Luce.

1538
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:29,830
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

1539
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:32,140
things didn't work out with that guy.

1540
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,800
And, you know, right now,
you should get in touch

1541
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,400
with the child within

1542
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:44,200
and explore your feminine side.

1543
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,190
And, you know, don't start eating
cookies and cake and stuff like that,

1544
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:53,580
because you'll blow up
like my Aunt Roberta, you know?

1545
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:57,760
You deserve better than that.

1546
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:09,230
So how are things going
with Miss Third Floor?

1547
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:11,770
She's...

1548
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:17,820
- Joey, Joey.
- She said that I...

1549
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:21,600
- What?
- Do you have any cookies?

1550
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,310
No. You know what?

1551
01:37:23,410 --> 01:37:25,790
- We can try on some of my shoes.
- Okay.

1552
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:38,100
- Hey. Last day?
- Yeah.

1553
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,210
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

1554
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:42,920
- We'll see each other.
- You better.

1555
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:44,520
- Of course.
- All right?

1556
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:47,020
- Bye.
- See you.

1557
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,000
Lucy?

1558
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:17,220
I need to ask you a question.

1559
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:21,510
Get down on your knee.
It's more romantic.

1560
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:24,130
He's proposing. Let him do it.

1561
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:26,520
I am letting him do it.

1562
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:34,610
Can I come in there, please?

1563
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,620
I can't.

1564
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,080
Not without a token.

1565
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:56,330
He just put the token in.

1566
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,260
Really?
I didn't notice.

1567
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:03,560
Marry me?

1568
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:05,310
Yeah.

1569
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:07,940
I love you.

1570
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:10,780
I love you back.

1571
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,410
- That's nice.
- I'm so happy.

1572
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,780
<i>So I had planned to marry</i>
<i>Peter, but I married Jack instead.</i>

1573
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:41,380
<i>Thank goodness my father was right.</i>

1574
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:43,940
<i>Life doesn't always turn out</i>
<i>the way you plan.</i>

1575
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:49,740
<i>But Jack, Jack gave me the perfect gift,</i>

1576
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:52,240
<i>a stamp in my passport.</i>

1577
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,910
<i>He took me to Florence</i>
<i>for our honeymoon.</i>

1578
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:57,990
<i>I guess you might say</i>
<i>he gave me the world.</i>

1579
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:03,040
<i>Peter once asked me when</i>
<i>it was that I fell in love with Jack.</i>

1580
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:04,790
<i>And I told him,</i>

1581
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:07,190
<i>"It was while you were sleeping."</i>

1582
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:30,930
<i>~ When my world is turnin' ~</i>

1583
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:34,880
<i>~ When it's turnin'</i>
<i>upside down ~</i>

1584
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:39,900
<i>~ When all I see is rain ~</i>

1585
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:44,610
<i>~ When I think</i>
<i>the night won't end ~</i>

1586
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:48,230
<i>~ I just think of you ~</i>

1587
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:52,910
<i>~ And I can see</i>
<i>the sun again ~</i>

1588
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:59,210
<i>~ Ooh, wherever would I be ~</i>

1589
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:01,800
<i>~ Without ya ~</i>

1590
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:05,300
<i>~ - If I didn't have you</i>
<i>- If I didn't have you ~</i>

1591
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:09,050
<i>~ Whatever would</i>
<i>I do now, baby ~</i>

1592
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:13,890
<i>~ Wherever would I be</i>
<i>without ya ~</i>

1593
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:17,190
<i>~ - I'd be nowhere</i>
<i>- Nowhere ~</i>

1594
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:21,440
<i>~ - I'd be nowhere</i>
<i>- Nowhere ~</i>

1595
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:24,150
<i>~ When the dreams I dream</i>
<i>all seem ~</i>

1596
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:27,730
<i>~ A million miles away ~</i>

1597
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:32,370
<i>~ When I'm sure</i>
<i>I'll never win ~</i>

1598
01:41:34,770 --> 01:41:37,920
<i>~ When it's lookin' like</i>
<i>I lost my faith ~</i>

1599
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:41,920
<i>~ - I just look at you, baby</i>
<i>- Baby ~</i>

1600
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:46,430
<i>~ And I got reason</i>
<i>to believe again ~</i>

1601
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:51,760
<i>~ Ooh, wherever would I be ~</i>

1602
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:53,930
<i>~ Without ya ~</i>

1603
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:57,900
<i>~ - If I didn't have you</i>
<i>- Ooh, if I didn't have you ~</i>

1604
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,690
<i>~ Whatever would</i>
<i>I do now, baby ~</i>

1605
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:06,480
<i>~ Wherever would I be</i>

1606
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:09,900

1607
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,080
<i>~ - I'd be nowhere</i>
<i>- Nowhere ~</i>

1608
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:17,180
<i>~ Without you ~</i>

1609
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,830
<i>~ - To love me</i>
<i>- To love me ~</i>

1610
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:23,000
<i>~ Just be wastin' time ~</i>

1611
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:29,390
<i>~ - Goin' out of my mind</i>
<i>- My mind ~</i>

1612
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:35,390
<i>~ Wherever would I be</i>
<i>without you ~</i>

1613
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:38,940
