Hey, good game, Sweets!

180
00:09:58,685 --> 00:09:59,773
BASKETBALL FAN:
Good game, Sweets!

181
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:03,559
[indistinct chatter
in background]

182
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,916
PLAYER 6:
Hey Sweets...

183
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,657
[chuckles lightly]

184
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:18,313
PLAYER 6:
Did you see Mikan's face when you blocked his shot?

185
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:21,098
[chuckles]

186
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:24,928
Fellows, we might be sleeping
here tonight,

187
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,627
but first,
it's pay time.

188
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,586
Excellent job.

189
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,849
Thank you so very much
for what you do.

190
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:33,937
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

191
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,243
Thank you.

192
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,462
Looking great out there,
honestly and truly.

193
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:38,812
- BABE: Thanks, Abe.
- Thank you.

194
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:41,728
- There's Pops.
- POP: Thanks, Abe.

195
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,817
And last,
but certainly not least,

196
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,384
thank you.

197
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,605
Ahan.

198
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,477
What?

199
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:53,957
Oh, don't give me that look,
Sweetwater.

200
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,872
You got something to say,
just say it to my face.

201
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,352
I can take it,
spit it out.

202
00:10:57,395 --> 00:11:00,442
We beat them Lakers.

203
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:01,704
The NBA champs.

204
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,706
Yeah, we certainly did.

205
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,187
It wasn't easy, honey.

206
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,537
No. No, it wasn't.

207
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,147
They're the... best.

208
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:13,237
So, we didn't expect it
to be easy.

209
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,586
And if I guess it
ain't my business

210
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,763
how much they get paid?

211
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,678
It's none of your beeswax.

212
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,332
You're not hearing what
I'm saying, Abe.

213
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,119
I would say everyone is hearing
what you're saying loud

214
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,033
and clear.

215
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:30,298
And on behalf of Sweetwater,

216
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,779
I would like to further thank
each

217
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,346
and everyone of you out
of my own.

218
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,826
[players chuckling]

219
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,699
Take from tonight,
'cause you earned it.

220
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,266
Sorry.

221
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,225
- Alright.
- Don't miss it.

222
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:45,705
Extra cabbage.

223
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:48,011
[chuckles]

224
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:50,318
Fellows I got big plans
more importantly,

225
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:53,451
tonight's win allows us
to now travel the world

226
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:55,366
with your talent.

227
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,456
South America, Europe,
all the way to China.

228
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,155
Places you've only dreamt about.

229
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,635
Internationally known
Globetrotters.

230
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,855
Bigger than Jesse Owens.

231
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:06,987
- Right?
- PLAYER 7: Hmmm.

232
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,684
- GOOSE: That's right.
- ABE: Joe Lewis.

233
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:12,383
They're just gonna be talking
about you now.

234
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:15,430
And I got new plays,
new routines you're gonna love.

235
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:16,692
And one day,

236
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:21,741
one day,
we're gonna be an NBA team.

237
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:30,706
Get some rest.

238
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,753
We're going to change the
world, Abe.

239
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:34,797
ABE:
Yeah, that's right.

240
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,323
Thanks, brother.

241
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:47,810
NBA BOARD MEMBER 1:
This is your opportunity to level the playing field.

242
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:48,811
Give these boys a chance
and let's get them on the court!

243
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:49,943
[overlapping speech]

244
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,901
This is not a Negro league!

245
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:54,251
- And never will be! Come on!
- DAN: I second the

246
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:55,296
- gentleman's opinion.
- What are you talking about?!

247
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,819
- Whoa, whoa, easy.
- Yes, thank you.

248
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,560
Easy!

249
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:01,215
[chuckles]
What's with all the yelling?

250
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:04,696
Now, I think we should proceed
with a...

251
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,438
with an atmosphere
of respect, okay.

252
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:08,613
And decorum.

253
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,269
And as
for Mr. Walter Brown's inquiry

254
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:16,186
regarding drafting Negro
players for the Celtics,

255
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,232
the bylaws are clear.

256
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,974
You are not limited
to whites only.

257
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,019
It says players.

258
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:24,586
Players.

259
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,849
So, anyone of you wants
to draft a negro player,

260
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,503
go be my guest.

261
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:32,507
The Celtics are very interested
in drafting a negro player.

262
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,682
- And...
- Out!

263
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,988
Alright.

264
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,251
I'd like to speak out
on behalf of my team

265
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:38,861
and our interest in this league

266
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:42,256
when I say it's unnecessary
to have all this razzle dazzle,

267
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,300
hot dog,
and bull crap on our courts.

268
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,562
[members chuckle]

269
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,826
And that's what
the negro players will do.

270
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,611
Can I-- can I just say something
for a change here, okay?

271
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:51,091
Just listen to me.

272
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,788
I think I can personally
guarantee

273
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,965
that no one in this room
loves basketball more than I do.

274
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,662
- [members chuckling]
- Oh, come on, stop!

275
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,534
Yes, that's right!
And this stuff you call,

276
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:00,883
"razzle dazzle",

277
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,798
well, I find it exciting,

278
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
and quite honestly,
entertaining.

279
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,281
Like...
like a dance!

280
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:08,717
- Oh, like a dance?
- Yes, like a dance.

281
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,284
Oh, it's-- it's a dance.

282
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,676
- Yes, a dance!
- Okay. Thank you very much.

283
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,765
They're supposed to put points
on the board,

284
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,637
and paying customers
in the seat.

285
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,206
Because, basketball after all
is a business.

286
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,903
Or haven't you heard?

287
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,339
Let's take a vote.

288
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:25,865
Hm? A gentlemen's agreement
if you will.

289
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:29,564
I move that the NBA is
for white players only.

290
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:32,045
Ahh... I uh...

291
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,699
I want to be on record
to saying,

292
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,572
that it's a mistake
to go on record with that.

293
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:44,100
[♪♪♪]

294
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:45,275
BARKER:
I reiterate.

295
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,410
I move that the NBA

296
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:52,195
is for white players only.

297
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,631
I second!

298
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,938
BARKER:
Thank you.

299
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,722
Okay, there's a motion
on the table.

300
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,028
It says uh,

301
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,857
the NBA wants to remain
an all white league.

302
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
All those in favor,
please say aye.

303
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:04,773
- Aye!
- Aye.

304
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:05,730
Those opposed?

305
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,210
Nay.

306
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:08,472
You guys have it.

307
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:11,867
Did you stand--
did you stand up?

308
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,129
NED:
I tried. Of course, I did.

309
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:15,218
- JOE: Did you?
- What do you think?

310
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:17,525
- Of course, I did.
- Who-- who made the decision?

311
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,962
- Podoloff?
- Him, board of governors,

312
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:20,963
- team owner--
- Oh!

313
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,617
It was kind of unanimous,
actually.

314
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,272
The-- the NBA champs

315
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:28,318
got their asses kicked
by an all-negro team. Okay!

316
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,364
Well, if memory serves me well,
it was a pretty close game.

317
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:32,409
Okay.

318
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:36,152
If the Trotters had a franchise
in this league,

319
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:37,980
there isn't a team
in the NBA

320
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,025
that could beat them.

321
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,243
I know.

322
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:44,117
It's not my decision, okay?

323
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:47,990
It is what it is, Joe.

324
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,731
It doesn't have to be that way.

325
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,213
But what do you wanna do?

326
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,261
I'm starting to think
this is where I resign.

327
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,828
Oh, that's smart.

328
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,395
That's really smart.

329
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:02,744
Now that we have
the ingredients

330
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,441
for a championship team,
you wanna quit?

331
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:06,487
Huh?

332
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,359
These kids are counting on you
to take them to the finals.

333
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,492
You wanna let them down?

334
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,189
Go ahead, tell 'em. Go ahead.

335
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,277
Alright, alright.

336
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:16,584
- Yeah.
- Okay.

337
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:18,542
[indistinct chatter
in background]

338
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,153

[whistles]

340
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:26,289
Alright,
let's work our rebounds.

341
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,464
Let's go, guys!

342
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,684
Line it up.

343
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:38,475
[cheering]

344
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,174
Babe!

345
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,132
Goose!

346
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,439
[cheering]

347
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:47,049
There it is.

348
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,095
[grunts]

349
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:51,793
GOOSE:
Yeah! I got him! I got him!

350
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,055
Oh yeah, I got him, I got him.

351
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,535
I got him! I got him!

352
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,754
I got him! I got him!

353
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,060
No, that's 2-2 on the whole.

354
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,757
Whoa! What? Wait! What?

355
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:00,932
Yeah, that's called "a foul".

356
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,195
You called it on me?

357
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:03,892
Yes, sir. You're 2-2.

358
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,328
Alright, I'm sorry, Ref.

359
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:06,199
- Alright. Give me the ball--
- Here you go, bud.

360
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:07,678
[laughs]

361
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:08,897
Thank you, sir.

362
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,074
[Goose chuckles]

363
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,728
What the hell kind of call
is that?

364
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,469
- You don't want it that way?
- That's fine. It's fine.

365
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:16,426
[claps]

366
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,558

White ball.

GOOSE:
Alright. Come on, now.

369
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,215
Hey, hey! Alright, alright.

370
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,433
Hey, hey, hey.

371
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,480
Keep going, keep going.

372
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,179
Hey!

[Abe cheers]

374
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,502
Got my hat on.

375
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:51,244

377
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,011
POP:
That damn clutch, again?

378
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,318
No, that's the sound
of an empty tank.

379
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:24,059
Forgot to fill up
in the city.

380
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,684
So, I did my part tonight.

381
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:41,729
So, who got bag duty,
'cause it ain't me.

382
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,426
- GOOSE: Not me.
- Not it. Not it.

383
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,036
- SWEETWATER: It ain't me.
- I think it's the person

384
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,647
with the least amounts of points
tonight.

385
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,083
ABE:
Yeah, so...

386
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,258
- Who is that?
- GOOSE: Ohhh...

387
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:50,346

388
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,870
Ohhh!

Alright, man. Alright, I'll-- I'll get the bags.

390
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:55,786

That's right. Nice move.

[players chuckling]

393
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,276
Step away, boy.

394
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,981
You need to move away
from my lily-white pumps,

395
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,113
nigger.

396
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,986
We mean no harm, sir.

397
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,641
All we need is some gas,
so, we can get on our way.

398
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,426
[chuckles]

399
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:28,341
You're a brave one talking back.

400
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,387
You see this gun?

401
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,824
It's loaded.

402
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,001
I know how to use it.

403
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:38,873
Let me tell you somethin'.

404
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,570
I've used it before.

405
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:43,834
Like I said,
we need some gas.

406
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:45,271
The tank is dry as dust.

407
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:48,926
Mm-hmm. And if I let you
pump some gas,

408
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,885
how you gonna pay for it,
boy?

409
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:00,111
[chuckles]

410
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:01,504
Your money ain't no good here.

411
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,597
Well, now who doesn't love
American cold hard cash, sir?

412
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,730
Abe Saperstein at your service.

413
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,688
Allow me to introduce

414
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:14,169
the gentleman that you're
somewhat pointing that,

415
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,736
powerful looking weapon
at...

416
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:18,608
This is basketball legend!

417
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,480
Nat Sweetwater Clifton.

418
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,351
One of the stars
of the Globetrotters,

419
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:25,006
the world renowned
Globetrotters.

420
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,443
We just uh, need a couple of
gallons of your gas, sir.

421
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:29,053
We'll be on our way.
In fact, I see

422
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:31,099
the prices have doubled,
which we're happy to pay.

423
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:34,102
Youse that negro basketball
team?

424
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,321
You are a clever one, sir.

425
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,540
Yes, we'se are
except myself, of course.

426
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:38,976
I coach the team.

427
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,687
Right uh...

428
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,906
To Jen, my girlfriend,
on this side.

429
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,041
Sure. Let me just see if there's
a pen on the bus, sir.

430
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:03,218
Oh, well I've got this,
I do signs with.

431
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,437
- There we are.
- Here you go.

432
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,786
That'll work.

433
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,135
Yes, indeed.

434
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,050
Be happy to do that.

435
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,660
That's uh...

436
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,488
That's gonna have some value
on the open market right away,

437
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:14,708
but if you hold on to it,

438
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,624
like a piano or real estate,
or a painting,

439
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,757
that will go up in value
over time.

440
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:21,802
Yes, indeed.

441
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,282
Y'all play a game today?

442
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,154
ABE:
We did! Yes, yes, a great game!

443
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:27,416
And even better crowd!

444
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,896
Weren't they something,
Sweetwater?

445
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,248
Yup, some of the better
basketball fans we've seen.

446
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,294
Good local folk you have here,
sir.

447
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,774
ABE:
Yeah, but terrific local team, too,

448
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:39,733
if you had the pleasure of
seeing them play--

449
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:41,778
I'll tell you what?
It'll be an honor of mine to

450
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:42,997
provide you
with the finest seats

451
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,085
in the house for yourself.

452
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:45,391
The missus and the kids,
next time

453
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:47,349
the Globetrotters pass through
your

454
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:48,872
warm and inviting county.

455
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:51,310
Who won that game today?

456
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:56,227
[chuckling]

457
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:59,187
Well, who do you think
won the game?

458
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,887
Thank you for the autograph.

459
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:08,849
ABE:
That went well.

460
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,373
[spits]

461
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:14,724
Just get back in the bus.

[panting]

464
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:14,305
Uh, I'm sorry, we have
absolutely no rooms available.

465
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,831
You have no rooms?

466
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:19,920
This is our busiest
time of year.

467
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,617
Yeah, I can see that.

468
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:25,404
A lot of keys there behind you.

469
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,971
You sure you don't wanna take
one more look

470
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,409
to see if there are any rooms?

471
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:33,324
Ah, it'd be a waste of time,
sir.

472
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:38,199
I'll tell you what, you should
check out The Dunbar.

473
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,679
They're right across town.

474
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,420
I'm sure they'd be willing
to accommodate you.

475
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:44,684
Across town, huh?

476
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,903
Yeah.

477
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:49,123
What about him?
Is he at the Dunbar, too?

478
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,473
Oh no. He's here, sir.

479
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,736
- What?
- Yeah, Mr. Bananas,

480
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,521
he's-- he's staying with us.

481
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:56,913
Yeah, he's just working
at the theatre

482
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:58,393
- right across the street.
- Is that right?

483
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,743
- Yeah.
- And he's got his own room here?

484
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,792
Well, he...

485
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:07,750
Him and his trainer.

486
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:11,493
Sure. Somebody's got to order
the room service, right?

487
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,452
Let me see if I understand this.

488
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:18,152
Mr. Bananas,
this chimp is so talented,

489
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,762
he's named
after the food he eats,

490
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:21,329
whereas my fellas,

491
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:24,201
who are the most talented
basketball players in the world,

492
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,681
they've got no room here.

493
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,075
[sighs]

494
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:31,426
Look uh, I don't make the
rules,

495
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,819
okay?

496
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:34,081
Times like this...

497
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:35,038
Hmmm.
...wish the hell I did.

498
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,779
Yeah, you don't make the rules.

499
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:40,348
You just follow 'em,
like at Nuremberg.

500
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,393
Does that ring a bell?

501
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:43,482
Let's go, fellas.

502
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,614
Wish you luck.

That was very yummy, mom.

505
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,327
I'm so glad you liked it,
sweetie.

506
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,287
Dad, may I be excused?

507
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,122
It's okay.

Have never seen you
so distraught.

511
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,795
It's the wall.

512
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:39,015
MRS. LAPCHICK:
What wall?

513
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,800
Ugh.

514
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:42,932
That Sweetwater Clifton
represents everything

515
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,978
that I have been fighting for,
you know that.

516
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,328
The guy is the future
of basketball,

517
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:51,680
and there is this wall,
that the league built,

518
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,769
and he won't be able
to break through it.

519
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,771
Alright?

520
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:59,079
By the time he does,
we'll be grandparents.

521
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,478
Look at me.

522
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,352
You are Joe Lapchick.

523
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,572
[scoffs]
Yeah.

524
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,312
You don't have to break
through a wall.

525
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,186
You just go get Sweetwater,

526
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:21,797
and you climb over that wall
with him.

527
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:42,209

00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:01,854
I didn't mean to wake you.

No, no, that's okay.

I don't ever really sleep.

534
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:07,642
Ah, well,
at least your team is awake.

535
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,774
Right?

536
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,819
We should take this up
to the Catskills.

537
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:13,735
Saperstein and Lapchick,
some Lapshtick, right?

538
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,868
- That's good.
- You know?

539
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,826
To what do I owe the pleasure?

540
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,523
Listen, I know you're not
fully conscious,

541
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,830
but I would just love
to pitch you something.

542
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:23,832
If you got a minute.

543
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:26,443
Ah, bring the Globetrotters
back to the garden.

544
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:27,967
[chuckles] I don't think so.

545
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,882
Huh.
They'll sell it out again.

546
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,710
No, we sold out,

547
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:35,148
because it was the NBA champion
Lakers playing the Trotters,

548
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:36,758
for an unofficial
world championship.

549
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,151
It was a bragging rights, Joe.

550
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:41,241
The fans did not come out
to see the Lakers.

551
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:43,504
They paid their money
to see the Trotters,

552
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:44,853
'cause
that's great entertainment.

553
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:46,159
Other than
the Ringling brothers,

554
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:48,335
we don't sell tickets,
you know that.

555
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:49,771
Trotters sell out everywhere
they go.

556
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,730
Yeah, in the boondocks, Joe.

557
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:52,992
Tiny gyms.

558
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,863
This is no comparison
to the garden.

559
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,999
- This is Ned.
- MICKEY: <i>Hi Ned, it's Mickey.</i>

560
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,696
Oh hey, Mickey,
what's going on?

561
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,744
What if the Trotters played
an All-Star college team?

562
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,615
That will put the butts
in the seats.

563
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:10,531
Hold on, Mickey.

564
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:17,538
[sighs]

565
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,279
I don't wanna talk
to that Saperstein guy.

566
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:20,802
Already taken care of.

567
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:21,803
Thanks, boss.

568
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,109
Go ahead, Mickey.

569
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,424

That's it, fellas.
Steal the rhythm.

Show some magic.

- Go ahead, Michael
- PLAYER 8: Go ahead, man!

580
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,085
ABE:
Now that's entertainment.

581
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:28,739
[cheering]

582
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:31,003
Basketball as its finest.

[indistinct chatter]

584
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,316
And skills.

585
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,491
Skills.

586
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,800
NED:
Ringling brothers.

587
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,846
Yeah, it comes in handy though.

588
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:50,631
Believe me, and by the way,
people love it.

589
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:52,241
All that
and they can actually play.

590
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,810
It's just a lot of fancy stuff.

591
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,768
JOE:
Yeah, but it sells, you know it does.

594
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:05,907
No, no, no, no, no, no.

595
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,822
Don't just finger roll it in,

596
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,954
around the back
or something,

597
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:10,042
and then stuff it.

598
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,217
Razzle dazzle!

599
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,261
Remember that!

600
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,394
That's what the fans pay for.

601
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:17,310
Don't start playing white on,
you're gonna put them to sleep.

602
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:19,268
Five-minute break,
and I mean, five!

603
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:31,237
Hey, you pay no mind to Sap.

604
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,762
You go over there
and handle your business.

605
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:35,981
You're gonna see,
he's a great kid.

606
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:38,722
Just try not to scare him.

607
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:44,032
I want you to meet Ned Irish.

608
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:46,252
He owns the Knickerbockers,
and the Garden.

609
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:48,428
No fooling, huh?

610
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,125
Nice to meet you, Mr. Irish.

611
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:51,953
Great to meet you too, Nat.

612
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,389
Hey, let me see those hands.

613
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,089
Oh, wow.

614
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,568
[Ned chuckles]

615
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:00,135
Well, welcome back
to the Garden.

616
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,398
Uh, yes sir, thank you.

617
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:05,097
No, what's with this sir stuff?
Call me "Ned".

618
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,533
Sorry.

619
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:09,275
Just a habit left over
from my days in the army.

620
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:11,103
You fought in the war?

621
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,452
Yes sir, Joe.

622
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,412
- Here, have a seat.
- JOE: Have a seat.

623
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,590
Saperstein's a little tough
on you, huh?

624
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,202
He knows what he wants.

625
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:24,725
Yeah.

626
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:26,640
He wants a show,
that's what he wants.

627
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,860
SWEETWATER:
Abe's got to win all the time.

628
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,993
That's what we get paid to do.

629
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,212
However, much that is.

630
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:35,823
And I'm telling you,
it ain't much.

631
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:40,349
NED:
So uh, you win all the time and you get paid for it?

632
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:43,352
[chuckles]
Sounds like a champagne problem to me.

633
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:45,964
It ain't like that, Mr. Irish.

634
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:50,142
You see, Abe sets up these
games with white players

635
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,187
for us to win.

636
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:54,276
What gets me is why set it up,

637
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,148
when we're better
than all these white teams,

638
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:57,714
that can beat 'em anyways.

639
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,021
NED:
It's not like he's asking you

640
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:01,980
to take a dive
in the 12th round.

641
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:04,678
You see, Mr. Irish,

642
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,508
we do things
with this basketball,

643
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:10,771
don't even exist in your dreams.

644
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,515
And I get people paying
for that.

645
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:18,039
But I ain't interested
in being part of no circus.

646
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,693
Okay, nap time's over.

647
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,564
We got a big game tonight.

648
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:23,001
A bunch of college idiots

649
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,132
who can't wait
to get their butts kicked.

650
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:26,091
Let's go. Sweets!

00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:32,010

654
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,374
Yeah!

655
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:49,418
Sweetwater!

656
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,031
Okay, Caleb and Andrew,

657
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:56,121
I want you guys out there
double-teaming Sweetwater.

658
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,905
But every time we step
on this court,

659
00:33:57,948 --> 00:33:59,689
- it means something.
- Right.

660
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:01,256
So, let's make these
last seconds count.

661
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,518
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.

663
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,391
I got something up my sleeve.

00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:14,835
Wait.

00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:28,501
It worked, man.

673
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:29,806
Alright, man,
I'll tell you

674
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,244
after a win like that,
I'm going out tonight.

675
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,897
Looking like Superman
with them shoulder pads on.

677
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,162
Where we going tonight?

678
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,338
If you want to meet the fellows,
you just need to tell me.

679
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:43,124
- Later.
- [indistinct speech]

680
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:45,083
Okay fellas, grab your stuff.
Let's get on the bus.

681
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,910
- Here we go!
- POP: Irish.

682
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,086

you, thank you.

Good to see you there, Mr. Irish.

Great game, great game.

You make sure there's money out there...

[indistinct speech]

688
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,571
It really is your lucky day.

689
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,138
How lucky am I?

690
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:59,053
About 2 grand lucky.

691
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,403
You're not so bad after all,
Irish.

692
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,101
Wish I could say the same
about you, Abe.

693
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,276
[chuckles]

694
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:05,712
What about the other team?

695
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:07,148
Took care of them
from my end.

696
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,280
Like we agreed.

697
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,282
- 100 shekels each?
- NED: 100 a man.

698
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,110
- Paid in full.
- Alright, I gotta skedaddle.

699
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,286
We got another show
upstate in the boonies.

700
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,896
Looks like you're working
too hard.

701
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:19,117
Oh, if I had your money,
I'd give mine away.

702
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,248
Huh.

703
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:24,426

[♪♪♪]

705
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:54,108
Special place, isn't it?

706
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,153
Oh yeah.

707
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,112
She is beautiful.

708
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,896
Yeah.

709
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,203
I won a couple of championships

00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,285
Here we go, okay.

886
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:07,982
McGuire, what are you doing?

887
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:09,157
Okay, keep it moving.

888
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:11,246
Extra pass. Extra pass.

889
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,510
What are you--
Hold on a second.

890
00:46:14,554 --> 00:46:16,556
If we keep coming
without the ball,

891
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:18,688
let's go again, alright.
Give and go.

892
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:20,821
As soon as you give it,
just make that cut.

893
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:22,257
Make-- Don't ever stop.

894
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:23,476
- KNICKS PLAYER 1: Okay.
- JOE: This doesn't stop.

895
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:24,607
Let's go, let's go.

896
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:26,000
Movement.

897
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:28,481
Make that cut. There we go.

898
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,222
Okay. Perfect.

899
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:31,310
Alright?

900
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:32,572
That's how it's done.

901
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:34,879
There's more options
from the post.

902
00:46:34,922 --> 00:46:36,271
- Who's that?
- Oh, look at that.

903
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:39,144
Good to see you, Joe.

904
00:46:39,187 --> 00:46:40,319
[Joe chuckles]

905
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:42,408
You too, Sweetwater.

906
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:43,452
Give me the ball.

907
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,935
Alright, fellas, same play.

908
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:49,807
Set it up.

909
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,635
Max, Vandeweghe,
criss cross right there.

910
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:53,898
McGuire, cut now!

911
00:46:55,682 --> 00:46:56,988
Hey. Yeah!

912
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:57,815
[Joe chuckles]

913
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:59,077
Nice layout!

914
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,165
Nice shot.

915
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,732
Not bad for a bunch
of white guys.

916
00:47:02,776 --> 00:47:03,951
Now, that's a well-coached team.

917
00:47:03,995 --> 00:47:04,430
Hmm.

918
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:06,040
[chuckles]

919
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:07,433
SWEETWATER:
That's a well. Thanks for this one, fellas.

920
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,478
- Absolutely.
- See you around, Joe.

921
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:14,048
NED:
Hey Joe, can I have a word, please?

922
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:15,397
KNICKS PLAYER 4:
Alright, guys, come on.

923
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:16,703
Give me a second, guys.

924
00:47:19,097 --> 00:47:22,143
NED:
Um, what do you think you're doing?

925
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:23,884
What are you talking about?

926
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:26,147
You do realize letting him play
is a violation of league policy?

927
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:28,367
No. League policy says that you
can't

928
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,673
draft a player of color.

929
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:31,761
It doesn't say that you
can't practice.

930
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:33,285
Oh, come on, Joe.

931
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:36,984
No one moves like Sweetwater.

932
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:38,203
No one, no one posts up
like him.

933
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,421
No one can pass.

934
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:41,249
Maybe Cousy, but he's not 6'8".

935
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:43,773
Sweetwater is an older player.

936
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:46,080
And more importantly,
you're forgetting that he's a...

937
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:47,168
A negro?

938
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:51,129
We could win a title
with that negro.

939
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:54,436
He'd make a great Knickerbocker.

940
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,698
That's just my two cents.

941
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,224
Thank you.

942
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:05,578
Alright, guys.

943
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:06,753
Let's hit the shower.

944
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:08,059
Good work today.

945
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:09,234
Let's go, fellows.

946
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,941
Look, I know that the league

947
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:23,726
and the owners are gonna fight
you on this to no end--

948
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,772
- Huh.
- But I want this.

949
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:27,687
I want it bad, Ned. Alright?

950
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,951
You saw it was sellout crowd,
right?

951
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:33,171
The fans are gonna
eat it up.

952
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:34,868
Yeah, well, have you ever
thought of the fact

953
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,609
that maybe Sweetwater's best
years might be behind him?

954
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:37,653
Oh, come on, that's--

955
00:48:37,697 --> 00:48:39,307
You know that's not true.

956
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:41,788
We all know that's not true.

957
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:45,444
Look, Sweetwater knows this game
better than anyone,

958
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,446
young or old.

959
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:49,622
You know how long,

960
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:53,582
and how hard I have fought
to break down barriers?

961
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:56,237
I will fight for this.

962
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:58,979
I wanna fight with you.

963
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,506
It's not an easy mountain
to climb, Joe.

964
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,855
Yeah, we'll climb it together.

965
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:09,816
Could get ugly.

966
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:10,948
I was born ugly.

967
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:15,909
- Thanks very much.
- MECHANIC: You're welcome.

968
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,432
- Take care of yourself.
- MECHANIC: Thank you.

969
00:49:20,522 --> 00:49:22,655
Hey, Saperstein.

970
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:24,135
Great game yesterday.

971
00:49:24,178 --> 00:49:26,006
About that,

972
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,312
listen I'm glad I saw you.

973
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:29,140
I wanted to thank you
for the accommodations

974
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:32,317
your urine-soaked alleyway
has been very nice to me.

975
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,667
You're welcome, anytime.

976
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:38,932
So uh,
I think this belongs to you.

977
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,456
What?
We settled up last night.

978
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,023
New day new deal.

979
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:44,720
Yeah, but what is it?

980
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:46,722
It's about 5,000 in cash.

981
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:47,810
What?

982
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:48,811
Why?

983
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:50,552
Why?

984
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:52,946
Well, it's not a raise.

985
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,600
I want
to buy Sweetwater's contract.

986
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:57,951
[both laughs]

987
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,866
I like you, Irish.

988
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:00,823
You're funny.

989
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,434
[chuckles]

990
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:04,088
Did you talk to Sweets
about this?

991
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:06,438
- Not really, no.
- No, didn't think so.

992
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:09,049
I should keep this cash
to pay for the insult.

993
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:10,659
- It's not happening.
- Why?

994
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:13,227
I thought you'd be interested
in getting rid of a headache.

995
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:15,012
Yeah, it's quite the headache
I get

996
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:17,014
from counting all the money
he makes me.

997
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:18,145
Forget it.

998
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:20,974
Let me ask you something.
You don't really think

999
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,671
Sweetwater's gonna play
in the NBA?

1000
00:50:22,715 --> 00:50:24,238
Lapchick, I understand,
he wants to move the

1001
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:25,935
color line and I respect that,

1002
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:27,894
but what is your angle?

1003
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:29,069
I don't know.

1004
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:33,030
Fill the Garden, win a couple of
championships, maybe.

1005
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:34,509
- For the glory?
- For the glory.

1006
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:36,468
- Why not?
- Okay.

1007
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:38,557
I just don't see you
spending a dime

1008
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,862
on a negro player,

1009
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:43,214
when you know the league
will never let him play.

1010
00:50:43,257 --> 00:50:45,564
'Cause of the rules.

1011
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:47,044
I like breaking the rules.

1012
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:51,004
You did pretty good
with no Jew,

1013
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,658
especially one
with five negros,

1014
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:54,834
will ever play in the Garden.

1015
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:57,402
- Did I say that?
- That's a quote.

1016
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:58,359
- Oh.
- This is not happening

1017
00:50:58,403 --> 00:51:00,535
- in your lifetime.
- Okay.

1018
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:02,276
I mean, I can't change your
mind at all.

1019
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,278
I mean, think about it,

1020
00:51:04,322 --> 00:51:06,324
you get to sleep
in a real bed,

1021
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,848
with real sheets,
not on the floor of a bus.

1022
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:10,676
Come on!

1023
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,547
- Sheets?
- Sheets.

1024
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:13,853
What kind of sheets?

1025
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:15,594
Egyptian cotton,
you're gonna love it.

1026
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:16,812
You son of a bitch.

1027
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:19,859
- Get out of here.
- Ah, you're a f--

1028
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:21,948
You're the funny one,
Saperstein.

1029
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:24,298
You know I like you,
you know that?

1030
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:26,344
Why don't you call me, when you
get back from the boondocks?

1031
00:51:26,387 --> 00:51:27,606
- Okay?
- It's not enough.

1032
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:28,781
NED:
Okay.

1033
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:37,398
[♪♪♪]

1034
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:15,306
Okay. You guys are looking good
with the matching uniforms,

1035
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:16,829
and fancy shoes.

1036
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:18,787
Alright. [chuckles]

1037
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:20,006
Here we are, Ref.

1038
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:22,400
Alright. Count it, boys.

1039
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:25,011
Should be 75 shekels a piece
in there for you.

1040
00:52:25,054 --> 00:52:26,578
I counted it myself,
now,

1041
00:52:26,621 --> 00:52:28,971
let's go over the game plan,
shall we?

1042
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:31,191
You play along with the
shenanigans on the court.

1043
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:33,715
The Trotters win, and everything
works out for everybody.

1044
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:35,282
Easy, right?
Any questions?

1045
00:52:35,326 --> 00:52:36,762
No? Great!

1046
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:38,720
- Alright!
- Mr. Saperstein?

1047
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:39,982
- Yeah!
- I just want to say

1048
00:52:40,026 --> 00:52:41,549
this is so generous.

1049
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:42,724
Right, right, yeah, yeah.

1050
00:52:42,768 --> 00:52:43,899
Let's not count it out here.

1051
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:45,249
It's Saperstein, yeah.

1052
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:46,380
Okay.

1053
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:47,599
Sweet!

1054
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,428
What are you doing, pal?

1055
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:52,386
Come on, we got a game
in five minutes.

1056
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:58,218
You ready?

1057
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:00,177
What's the matter?

1058
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,830
Oh, buddy, come on,
we're gonna have some fun.

1059
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,530
Boom chick-a-boom.
Here we go.

1060
00:53:05,573 --> 00:53:07,749
[crowd cheering]

1061
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:09,055
Alright, alright,
you got him.

1062
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:09,838
[indistinct speech]

1063
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:10,883
Here we go.

1064
00:53:12,145 --> 00:53:13,277
Yeah!

1065
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,408
Alright, alright.

1066
00:53:14,452 --> 00:53:15,627
Hey!!

1067
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,368
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it.
Hey!

1068
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:18,369
Between your legs!

1069
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:21,241
[ladies chuckle]

1070
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:23,112
Over your head, ah!

1071
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:27,421
Watch it, watch it, watch it,
watch it!

1072
00:53:30,337 --> 00:53:32,209
Yeah!

1073
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:35,864
Just wait a minute.

1074
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:41,218
Who believes in magic?

1075
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:42,262
[chuckles]

1076
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,263
LADY IN THE BACK:
I do! I do! Me!

1077
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:44,003
What is this?
What's happening?

1078
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,178
Hey Sap!

1079
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,832
Just sit back
and enjoy the magic.

1080
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:47,963
Right.

1081
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:49,704
Oh, I think I see somebody.

1082
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:52,403
Excuse me.

1083
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:55,493
- Come.
- ABE: Oh, now, wait second.

1084
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:58,322
Just go with it.

1085
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:02,587
Come on,
now, you show me the magic.

1086
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:06,504
All you gotta do is believe.

1087
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:10,986
[cheering]

1088
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,380
Do I gotta pay the kid now?

1089
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:14,599
Didn't that feel good?

1090
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:16,296
That felt great.

1091
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,732
[crowd chuckles]

1092
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:20,126
Alright, let's wrap it up.

1093
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:21,693
Hold on, fellas!

1094
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:24,739
What's the score?

1095
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:31,093
[chuckles]
Hey man, it's a little bit to a lot.

1096
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:33,226
Well, let's make it a little
bit more funny.

1097
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,054
What you talking about, Sweet?

1098
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:36,011
Follow me.

1099
00:54:37,186 --> 00:54:41,147
[crowd cheering]

1100
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:44,324
You're scoring on the other
team's basket.

1101
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:46,065
I'm gonna count on it.

1102
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:47,936
I'm gonna count--
That's for you guys.

1103
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,460
Yes.
They just made you get this.

1104
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,333
These are all counting.

1105
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,640
SWEETWATER:
Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going.

1106
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:56,771
Okay, that's 60!

1107
00:54:56,815 --> 00:55:00,340
[indistinct chatter]

1108
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:04,431
That's enough.

1109
00:55:04,475 --> 00:55:08,740
[cheering]

1110
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:11,220
SWEETWATER:
Now hold on now. Goose!

1111
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:12,744
GOOSE:
It's tied up.

1112
00:55:12,787 --> 00:55:14,049
Whoa!

1113
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:16,791
And we only have three seconds
left.

1114
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:18,053
Everybody!

1115
00:55:18,097 --> 00:55:21,492
CROWD:
3, 2, 1.

1116
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:22,536
You better make that.

1117
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:28,020
[cheering]

1118
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:32,981
And a regulation,

1119
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:35,332
that shot counts,
Harlem wins by 2.

1120
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,725
Yeah, thanks.

1121
00:55:38,857 --> 00:55:39,771
GIRL 1:
Wow.

1122
00:55:39,814 --> 00:55:41,729
SWEETWATER:
Oh, absolutely.

1123
00:55:44,036 --> 00:55:46,081
Sweetwater, what the hell
was that about?

1124
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,692
Well, that's entertainment.

1125
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:49,302
That's what you pay me to do.

1126
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,304
No, I pay you to stick
to my game plan.

1127
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:54,699
We won.

1128
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:56,004
Just like you planned.

1129
00:55:57,484 --> 00:55:58,964
Scoring baskets
for the other team

1130
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:00,357
was never part of my plan.

1131
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,184
It never will be.

1132
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:04,186
Okay, Abe.

1133
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,319
But I heard you say something
about some shenanigans.

1134
00:56:08,103 --> 00:56:09,366
Yeah.

1135
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:13,413
On the bus now!

1136
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:14,806
Let's go! Let's go!

1137
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,375
- Thanks, everybody.
- Yeah. We gotta go.

1138
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:20,289
Bus leaves in five minutes with
or without you,

1139
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,335
and I mean five.
Let's go, let's go.

1140
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:25,120
- Thanks, folks.
- What's your name?

1141
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:28,907
Hey, that bit with the kid,
now that is entertainment.

1142
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,736
Special, Sweets.

1143
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:32,867
Keep doing your thing.

1144
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:34,129
Hmm.

1145
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:37,829
- Thank you, Pop.
- Yeah.

1146
00:56:37,872 --> 00:56:38,873
Thank you, ma'am.

1147
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:41,093
I love the hat.

1148
00:56:43,008 --> 00:56:44,966
- What a finish.
- GOOSE: Yes.

1149
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,446
You signed them autographs,
Goose?

1150
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,970
GOOSE:
Thanks, man. [chuckling]

1151
00:56:49,014 --> 00:56:50,450
SWEETWATER:
Pretty good game.

1152
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,451
Yeah, thank you.

1153
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:53,453
Great game indeed.

1154
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:54,585
- Fantastic.
- Thanks Abe.

1155
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:55,803
[Pop chuckles]

1156
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:57,805
ABE:
Great job. Fantastic.

1157
00:56:57,849 --> 00:56:59,198
POP:
Fans loved that.

1158
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:01,461
- ABE: Wonderful.
- SWEETWATER: It's great.

1159
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:02,810
Yeah, I see that right.

1160
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:15,649
Say Marcus,
how much you got?

1161
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:19,436
- Hm?
- 50.

1162
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:21,916
Goose, you?

1163
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,570
50.

1164
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:25,006
Pop?

1165
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:27,792
Oh, I see what's going on.

1166
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:29,271
Come on now, how much you got?

1167
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:34,755
That'll be 50.

1168
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,104
50!

1169
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:39,412
Yeah, me too.

1170
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:45,113
Tell the boys how much you pay
the other team, Abe.

1171
00:57:45,157 --> 00:57:47,333
Hm.

1172
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:48,508
Is there a problem?

1173
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:52,730
We whipped their butts!

1174
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:54,601
And they get paid more
than we do.

1175
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:55,689
[indistinct chatter]

1176
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:57,517
SWEETWATER:
Now that sound right.

1177
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:58,649
Does it, fellas?

1178
00:57:58,692 --> 00:57:59,954
PLAYERS:
No, no.

1179
00:57:59,998 --> 00:58:03,218
Them white boys get paid more
to lose,

1180
00:58:03,262 --> 00:58:05,786
than we get paid to win.

1181
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:09,181
I mean I don't know,
maybe I should switch teams.

1182
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:10,443
- No.
- GOOSE: Come on.

1183
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,401
Make a little extra cabbage
next time.

1184
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:15,840
Big question is,

1185
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:19,626
how much are you making, Abe?

1186
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:31,638
Oh, you were but a babe,
when I created this team.

1187
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,556
Hell, when I turned
the Savoy Big Five

1188
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,821
into the Harlem Globetrotters,
you were just starting to walk.

1189
00:58:40,865 --> 00:58:42,214
I created this team.

1190
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:43,911
I named this team.

1191
00:58:43,955 --> 00:58:46,958
I sowed the costumes
you're wearing.

1192
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:50,788
Most importantly,
I'm your boss.

1193
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,314
I'm the reason this team exists!

1194
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:59,884
I'm the reason
it's such a success.

1195
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:01,276
Why do I do this everyday?

1196
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:03,757
For you!

1197
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:06,368
I do whatever it takes
to get your next meet.

1198
00:59:06,412 --> 00:59:08,588
To get you the recognition
for what you do better

1199
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:12,287
than any other human being
on this planet,

1200
00:59:12,331 --> 00:59:13,854
which is play basketball.

1201
00:59:15,464 --> 00:59:17,641
There's nobody better.

1202
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:20,774
So just,
stick to playing basketball.

1203
00:59:21,949 --> 00:59:23,560
That's what you do.

1204
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:28,042
This ain't about basketball,
Abe.

1205
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:30,915
We're just part of your circus,
man.

1206
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,308
I mean you say,

1207
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:36,137
nobody does it better than us.

1208
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,400
We beat the world champs, man.

1209
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:39,663
[indistinct chatter]

1210
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:42,622
We feel we can beat any team
anywhere,

1211
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:44,232
fair and square.

1212
00:59:45,538 --> 00:59:47,279
Listen, Abe,
all we's saying is,

1213
00:59:47,322 --> 00:59:49,629
you can pay the other team.

1214
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:51,239
but don't you pay 'em to lose?

1215
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:56,767
That take away all the fun
out of whipping their butts!

1216
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,595
- That's right.
- Yes! Right, yeah.

1217
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:02,599
Okay.

1218
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:05,950
Fine.

1219
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,562
You need me to remind you

1220
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,782
what I thought everyone
in this bus,

1221
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:14,262
thoroughly understood.

1222
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:17,526
As a negro, you will not play
professional basketball,

1223
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,006
unless you play for me.

1224
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:23,097
This is my team.
I don't care who you are.

1225
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:27,058
Nobody, especially you,
is gonna tell me how to run it!

1226
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:32,933
I got big plans for you, fellas.

1227
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:36,981
[door knocks]

1228
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:45,598
A barn?

1229
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,557
Wow.

1230
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:50,211
What now?

1231
01:00:50,255 --> 01:00:52,736
It's nice to see you too, Abe.

1232
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:55,434
Come on,
someone wants to say hi to you.

1233
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:00,352
[grunts]

1234
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,662
Well, I can't imagine

1235
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:08,142
what brought you two city folks
all the way out here

1236
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:09,491
to the boondocks.

1237
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:10,449
Abe.

1238
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:14,279
You're wasting your time
and mine.

1239
01:01:14,322 --> 01:01:16,542
You know, it beats the hell out
of me,

1240
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:18,196
what got into you,

1241
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,678
putting together a group
of negro basketball players.

1242
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:24,724
From Timbuktu Illinois,
you got the whole world,

1243
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,160
thinking you guys are
from Harlem.

1244
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:30,164
And now you're the best team
on the planet.

1245
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:32,210
Greatest thing that ever
happened to basketball.

1246
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,650
I recognize the brilliance
in you, Abe.

1247
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,565
We're here to finish what
you started.

1248
01:01:39,608 --> 01:01:42,960
A negro basketball player
will walk on to an NBA court,

1249
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:45,092
so help me God.

1250
01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:46,746
What do you think about that,
Irish?

1251
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,574
You think that's gonna happen?

1252
01:01:48,617 --> 01:01:50,315
Don't be a sap, Saperstein.

1253
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,361
How much does it ring?

1254
01:01:53,405 --> 01:01:55,059
Huh.

1255
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:56,234
I'm starting to like this guy
more than I thought I would.

1256
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:57,931
[both chuckle]

1257
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:05,286
In this envelope,
is my final offer.

1258
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,419
10,000 sheckles
as you call it.

1259
01:02:07,462 --> 01:02:09,900
Now, that's more money
than anyone will pay

1260
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:11,162
for a negro player.

1261
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:14,339
And I'm certain,

1262
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:16,994
that you'll make sure,
Sweets gets some of it.

1263
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,750
Don't even think about it,
that's my car.

1264
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:36,796
You're never getting my car,
Abe.

1265
01:02:41,018 --> 01:02:42,236
What do they call that?

1266
01:02:43,368 --> 01:02:44,891
What?

1267
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:47,589
When someone comes into an
unexpected good fortune.

1268
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:49,766
Luck of the Irish?

1269
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:51,506
That's it!

1270
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:53,552
Irish, today's your lucky day.

1271
01:02:55,032 --> 01:02:56,947
I'm gonna take your $10,000.

1272
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:00,820
You're gonna take Sweetwater
back with you

1273
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:03,692
in that beautiful jalopy.

1274
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:05,216
But when you get there,

1275
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:08,045
you're gonna find
another 2500 in cash,

1276
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,265
that you'll give to Sweetwater,

1277
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:12,658
so he can get on his feet,
while he waits

1278
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:15,661
for his big Knickerbocker
salary to kick in.

1279
01:03:15,704 --> 01:03:17,315
That's my final offer.

1280
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,539
Okay.

1281
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,106
You're all out of excuses, Abe.

1282
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:30,807
How about that?

1283
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:36,595
How about that?

1284
01:03:36,638 --> 01:03:37,726
What do you know?

1285
01:03:39,772 --> 01:03:42,557
Hey Irish,
I got this idea,

1286
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:43,863
if a player can sink at basket

1287
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:46,387
for much, much further
than normal,

1288
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,563
much further out than normal,

1289
01:03:48,607 --> 01:03:50,304
he should get more
than two points.

1290
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:52,089
I call it a "three-pointer".
What do you think?

1291
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:53,264
Phew.

1292
01:03:53,307 --> 01:03:55,048
Jazz up the game a little?

1293
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:56,702
I don't know,
it sounds pretty crazy, Abe,

1294
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:57,834
but I don't know if the league
will ever go for it.

1295
01:03:57,877 --> 01:03:59,313
Run it by Podoloff.

1296
01:03:59,357 --> 01:04:01,228
You run it by Podoloff.
What am I, your errand boy?

1297
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:03,665
Oh, for he--
I'm gonna remember that.

1298
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:05,711
[chuckles] This guy.

1299
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:06,712
Hey, Irish.

1300
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:09,236
- Yeah?
- Promise me

1301
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,542
you'll fight for Sweetwater

1302
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:11,848
to get enough playing time,

1303
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:15,329
so the NBA can see
what he can actually do.

1304
01:04:15,373 --> 01:04:16,940
Yeah, sure.

1305
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:29,039
[sighs]

1306
01:04:32,564 --> 01:04:33,957
[chuckles]

1307
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,220
- We got Sweetwater.
- Yeah, thank you.

1308
01:04:39,788 --> 01:04:41,051
[indistinct chatter]

1309
01:04:41,094 --> 01:04:42,269
Hey, hey, listen up.

1310
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:45,882
Made a decision.

1311
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:47,144
Sweetwater,

1312
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,887
that was your last game
wearing a Trotter uniform.

1313
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,149
Oh, come on, Abe.

1314
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:53,411
Come on,
he's just messing around.

1315
01:04:53,454 --> 01:04:54,978
Hey, I was just having some fun
out there.

1316
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:57,110
You know, I didn't mean
no harm by that.

1317
01:04:57,154 --> 01:04:59,243
Yeah, your nonsense
on the court

1318
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:01,723
had nothing to do
with my decision.

1319
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:02,855
You're done here.

1320
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:06,946
Ned Irish just bought
your contract from me.

1321
01:05:08,426 --> 01:05:12,821
So, your next game will be
in a Knick jersey.

1322
01:05:15,868 --> 01:05:17,217
- Huh.
- ABE: The famed New York

1323
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:21,308
Knickerbockers, has just hired
Sweetwater Clifton

1324
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:26,139
with a starting salary
of $2,500,

1325
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:29,447
and I am the Jewish Abe Lincoln.

1326
01:05:30,796 --> 01:05:34,931
You are free to play
in the NBA.

1327
01:05:42,503 --> 01:05:43,809
Hey, come on,

1328
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:47,247
I'm representing all of us,
huh.

1329
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:48,509
Got some.

1330
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:51,948
Take me with you.

1331
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:54,254
[chuckling]

1332
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:58,519
Love you, brother.

1333
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:28,027
Welcome to the Knickerbockers,
Sweetwater.

1334
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:30,029
Thank you, Mr. Irish.

1335
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:31,509
You ready to change the game?

1336
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:33,163
Oh, I was born ready.

1337
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:35,034
[chuckles]
I believe it.

1338
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:36,949
- Come on, let's go.
- Alright.

1339
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:39,256
Welcome.

1340
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:41,127
Thank you, coach.

1341
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:43,086
No, no.

1342
01:06:43,129 --> 01:06:46,045
[grunts]
Sweetwater, in the front.

1343
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:51,311
It's okay.

1344
01:06:51,355 --> 01:06:52,791
Oh, okay.

1345
01:06:54,923 --> 01:07:03,932
[♪♪♪]

1346
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:22,864
[Ned chuckles]

1347
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:39,707
BARKER:
But Irish, you know you can't play him.

1348
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:42,406
Huh. The hell I can't,
and you can bet I will.

1349
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:45,670
I like to think of him
as the uh,

1350
01:07:45,713 --> 01:07:48,238
as the Jackie Robinson
of the NBA.

1351
01:07:48,281 --> 01:07:51,154
Irish, when you put
a colored player on the court,

1352
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:54,026
a white player
is sitting on the bench.

1353
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,898
Which America are you living
in, joker?

1354
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:59,336
'Cause your head is
so far up your ass,

1355
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:01,033
you forgot what
the land of the free,

1356
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,904
and the home of the brave,
stands for.

1357
01:08:02,948 --> 01:08:04,384
Mm-hmm.

1358
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:06,560
Okay, uh, excuse us
for one second, please?

1359
01:08:06,604 --> 01:08:07,866
Come here, come here.

1360
01:08:09,259 --> 01:08:10,695
You gotta help me out.

1361
01:08:10,738 --> 01:08:13,045
I got a board here,
who thinks,

1362
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,699
that you're violating
the decree.

1363
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:18,485
I'm talking about the future
of the game here, Mo.

1364
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:23,751
Now, we can either stand
in the way of progress,

1365
01:08:23,795 --> 01:08:26,493
or we can be a part of it.

1366
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:28,669
You proceed with
a separate agenda like this,

1367
01:08:28,713 --> 01:08:30,932
you're gonna start a war.

1368
01:08:30,976 --> 01:08:32,325
And I'll fight it with you.

1369
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,242
- Okay, as I was saying-
- Okay, ah, excuse me.

1370
01:08:36,286 --> 01:08:38,984
Ah, what-- what my colleague
over here is trying to say

1371
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:42,118
is that he thinks,
that Sweetwater's style of play

1372
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:45,643
is going to be uh,
disrespectful to his fans.

1373
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:47,166
- Exactly.
- Wrong again,

1374
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:49,690
my distinguished colleagues.

1375
01:08:49,734 --> 01:08:52,606
Sweetwater's style
is pure showmanship.

1376
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:54,695
And the fans love it.

1377
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:56,088
That's why he's a big draw!

1378
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,831
That's right.
This league, our league,

1379
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:01,354
is not gonna survive.

1380
01:09:01,398 --> 01:09:05,010
Not with this vanilla style
of play.

1381
01:09:05,053 --> 01:09:07,186
We need some of that,
what'd you call it?

1382
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,840
"Razzle dazzle"?

1383
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:10,668
Razzle dazzle, indeed.

1384
01:09:10,711 --> 01:09:12,539
- Wh-- what's he doing here?
- Just hear him out.

1385
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,150
Thanks, boss, I appreciate it.

1386
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:15,107
EDDIE:
Hey, Joe.

1387
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:18,023
Gentlemen, I will be very brief.

1388
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:21,809
Sweetwater Clifton's style
of play,

1389
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:23,681
is creative.

1390
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:24,986
It's innovative.

1391
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,685
And it brings
about a much needed change

1392
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:28,903
to this game.

1393
01:09:28,947 --> 01:09:30,775
I know change is hard
for you gentlemen,

1394
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:32,472
but this is the game,
that is--

1395
01:09:32,516 --> 01:09:34,387
that is being played
on the streets.

1396
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:36,215
It's being played
in colleges.

1397
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:37,564
The street game
in college plays,

1398
01:09:37,608 --> 01:09:39,523
it's not the pro ranks,
Lapchick.

1399
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:40,741
It's the future...

1400
01:09:40,785 --> 01:09:42,439
- Oh...
- JOE: ...Of the NBA.

1401
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:44,310
Look, we already took a vote,
Ned.

1402
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:47,052
Yeah well, the fans didn't vote
that way.

1403
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:48,575
Let me ask you a question.

1404
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:50,925
Who sells more tickets
than any other basketball team?

1405
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:52,623
Go ahead, take a guess,
go ahead.

1406
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:54,799
We all know it's the Trotters,
Irish.

1407
01:09:54,842 --> 01:09:57,062
That's right.
And since it's been decided

1408
01:09:57,105 --> 01:09:58,585
by the board of governors,

1409
01:09:58,629 --> 01:10:00,805
to not let the Trotters

1410
01:10:00,848 --> 01:10:02,372
I say,

1411
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:05,549

and put 'em on our teams.

1414

We each pick one player.

1415
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,905
I mean, how hard is that?

1416
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:14,906
It's what the fans want.

1417
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:16,124
That's New York fans.

1418
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:17,822
You don't know my fans.

1419
01:10:17,865 --> 01:10:20,433
What we're trying to get
through to you,

1420
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:22,087
it's that times change.

1421
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,915
You know,
it wasn't too long ago,

1422
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:26,918
that a Jew wasn't permitted
to set foot on a hardwood,

1423
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:28,963
never mind own a team.

1424
01:10:29,007 --> 01:10:31,357
Now, I have three Jewish
players on my roster.

1425
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:33,794
So, what I'm trying to say
to you is, schmuck!

1426
01:10:33,838 --> 01:10:34,882
Don't be a schmuck!

about this,

1429
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,148
- it's good for business.
- Now, you're talking.

1430
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:42,455
Irish, let's say that I

1431
01:10:42,499 --> 01:10:45,241

what does that make me?

1433
01:10:48,026 --> 01:10:49,549
Does that make me your friend?

1434
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:52,726
You know what this is?

1435

1437

That, is my gate take
for the Knickerbocker season.

1438

Be my guest.

1442
01:11:07,654 --> 01:11:12,180
Irish, why are you fighting
so hard for this negro player?

1443
01:11:12,224 --> 01:11:13,486
Because he fought for us.

1444
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:17,098
Sergeant Sweetwater Clifton

1445
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:19,884
is a veteran
of the United States Army.

1446
01:11:19,927 --> 01:11:21,625
Sounds pretty distinguished
to me.

1447
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:24,367
So uh,

1448
01:11:25,716 --> 01:11:27,326
shall we continue
with the draft?

1449
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:31,852
Okay, uh, next up
is the Celtics' Walter Brown.

1450
01:11:31,896 --> 01:11:35,116
The Boston Celtics pick
Chuck Cooper from Duquesne.

1451
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,337
We all know we allow
colored players into the draft,

1452
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:41,906
but by gentlemen's agreement,
we don't actually select them.

1453
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:43,516
He's eligible for the draft,
isn't he?

1454
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,691
Yeah.

1455
01:11:44,735 --> 01:11:47,128
Well, then, I don't care
if he's striped,

1457

I'm not telling you again,

1464
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:05,712

we'll start with you.

1478
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,083
How does it feel to be
competing to become

1479
01:12:29,127 --> 01:12:31,172
the first color player?

1480
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:32,609
To play in the NBA?

1481
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:35,786
Oh man, um...

1482
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:40,704
I'm just a small town kid, man,
um, you know.

I'll be lying to you, man,
if I--

1484
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:47,363
if I didn't tell you that it
is, it's quite frightening.

1485
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:48,842
Right. Thank you.

1486
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,061
Mr. Cooper?

1487
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:52,019
Same question.

1488
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:53,456
I can say,

1489
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:54,935
I probably feel
how Jackie Robinson

1490
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,981
felt a couple of years ago.

1491
01:12:57,024 --> 01:13:00,071
Um, for me,
this is a dream come true.

1492
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:01,377
I grew up playing basketball.

1493
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,815
and now I get to play
at the highest level.

1494
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:07,121
And to get paid to do
what I love.

1495

It's-- it's crazy.

1496
01:13:10,908 --> 01:13:12,779
Mr. Clifton,

1497
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:14,868
before signing with the Knicks,

1498
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:18,089
you were a basketball star
in your right.

1499
01:13:18,132 --> 01:13:19,395
And some say,

1500
01:13:19,438 --> 01:13:21,875
the best basketball player
in the world.

1501
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,487
And now, you're in the NBA.

1502
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:26,967
What's going through your mind?

1503
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:30,231
I don't think it's about
who's the best.

1504
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:34,148
Yeah, see.

1505
01:13:34,192 --> 01:13:38,370
Ever since I was a young boy,
I always felt like I'm adapting.

1506

My whole life's been like that.

1507
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:45,551
That's something we get
from our parents to survive.

1508
01:13:47,248 --> 01:13:50,687
I believe that the three of us,

1509
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:55,561
Chuck Cooper, Earl Lloyd,
and myself

1510
01:13:55,605 --> 01:13:58,303
can walk away from the past.

in a white man's game.

1583
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,068
You, singing them blues.

1584
01:18:04,636 --> 01:18:06,420
T-Bone came by the club earlier.

1585
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:10,511
Wants me to officially
go on the road with him.

1586
01:18:10,555 --> 01:18:11,730
Hmm.

1587
01:18:11,774 --> 01:18:12,775
I leave tomorrow morning.

1588
01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:14,864
Haha.

1589
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:17,649
You are a happening.

1590
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,173
And that happening,
is thanks to you.

1591
01:18:20,217 --> 01:18:21,522
Oh.

1592
01:18:21,566 --> 01:18:24,961
It's happening 'cause you
are one talented soul.

1593
01:18:27,093 --> 01:18:29,487
Black folk gonna love you.

1594
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,749
White folk gonna love you.

1595
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:33,317
Oh, and they already do.

1596
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,711
[chuckles]

1597
01:18:39,976 --> 01:18:41,368
I'm forever grateful.

1598
01:18:42,413 --> 01:18:43,370
Hm.

1599
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:46,373
[kisses]

1600
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:06,393
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, Irish?

1601
01:19:06,437 --> 01:19:07,873
- Yeah.
- I got a message.

1602
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:11,007
[grunting]

1603
01:19:13,531 --> 01:19:14,706
You want to stay healthy?

1604
01:19:15,838 --> 01:19:17,578
Don't play the negro.

1605
01:19:17,622 --> 01:19:20,277
[yells]

1606
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,366
Damn, son of a bitch!

1607
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:28,851
- Mr. Irish.
- Get him, Tom!

1608
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:30,417
Get him!

1609
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:31,592
[grunting]

1610
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:33,246
TOM:
Hey, stop!

1611
01:19:34,378 --> 01:19:36,728
[grunts]

1612
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,948
- RICHARD: Okay.
- JOE: Thank you.

1613
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:40,384
Okay, here you go.

1614
01:19:40,427 --> 01:19:41,559
Thank you, buddy.

1615
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:48,305
[telephone rings]

1616
01:19:48,348 --> 01:19:49,480
I will go get that.

1617
01:19:49,523 --> 01:19:50,307
JOE:
Alright.

1618
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,834
Hello. Lapchick residence.

[♪♪♪]

1621
01:20:03,015 --> 01:20:04,321
Who was it, sweetie?

1622
01:20:04,364 --> 01:20:05,191
I don't know.

1623
01:20:05,235 --> 01:20:06,453
They mumbled and hung up.

1624
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,369
It's probably a wrong number.

1625
01:20:09,413 --> 01:20:10,327
Yeah.

1626
01:20:12,024 --> 01:20:13,112
RICHARD:
Dad?

1627
01:20:13,156 --> 01:20:15,071
Yes.

1628
01:20:15,114 --> 01:20:17,508
My friends at school
say we're nigger lovers.

1629
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:18,596
Is that true?

1630
01:20:24,471 --> 01:20:27,648
[steps away]

1631
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:34,003
Son, that is a word
of disrespect.

1632
01:20:34,046 --> 01:20:37,615
And we don't ever use that word
in this household, ever.

1633
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:39,225
You understand?

1634
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:40,879
Never again, never again.

1635
01:20:42,228 --> 01:20:43,316
I understand, dad.

1636
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:51,150
KNICKS PLAYER 5:
Nice shot.

1637
01:20:51,194 --> 01:20:52,978
Nice shot.

1638
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:54,501
NED:
Wait till you see this kid.

1639
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:56,982
[overlapping speech]

1640
01:20:57,026 --> 01:20:59,289
KNICKS PLAYER 6:
Come on. Put it up, put it up.

1641
01:20:59,332 --> 01:21:00,290
Watch this guy.

1642
01:21:02,509 --> 01:21:04,772
Hey, hey, newest New York Knick.

1643
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,998
Don't know how you missed
that free though.

1644
01:21:14,217 --> 01:21:17,524
You're an All-Star, right?

1645
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,004
Having an off night,
you know how that goes?

1646
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:22,486
Oh... Me, I can't afford
to have an off night.

1647
01:21:22,529 --> 01:21:27,839
And I especially can't afford
to miss any free throws.

1648
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,930
They're free.

1649
01:21:31,974 --> 01:21:35,586
[players chuckle]

1650
01:21:35,629 --> 01:21:36,761
I like this guy, he's fun.

1651
01:21:38,284 --> 01:21:40,069
Alright, come on now.

1652
01:21:40,112 --> 01:21:41,374
Let me show y'all something.

1653
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:42,767
Over there, McGuire.

1654
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,421
Max, Vandeweghe.

1655
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:46,031
Vince.

1656
01:21:46,075 --> 01:21:47,815
You keep it.

1657
01:21:47,859 --> 01:21:48,947
I'll take that, Mr. Clifton.

1658
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:53,082
Alright.

1659
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:57,086
Alright, pass to Vandeweghe,
criss cross in front of me.

1660
01:21:57,129 --> 01:21:58,261
Oh, no. Hold on.

1661
01:21:58,304 --> 01:21:59,697
Stop, stop. Go back.

1662
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,872
Go back to him.

1663
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:06,008
You see this ball?

1664
01:22:07,487 --> 01:22:09,881
This ball has life.

1665
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,231
You can't just treat it
any kind of way.

1666
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:15,713
You got to cherish it.

1667
01:22:15,756 --> 01:22:17,454
Give it your best.

1668
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:19,543
Put some love in it.

1669
01:22:19,586 --> 01:22:21,284
And watch what
it give you back.

1670
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:24,113
So, don't just pass the ball
any kind of way,

1671
01:22:24,156 --> 01:22:25,897
put some love in it.

1672
01:22:27,203 --> 01:22:29,205
You got to cherish it.

1673
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,467
Right.

1674
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,121
Just like that, snap it!

1675
01:22:32,164 --> 01:22:33,905
No. On target.

1676
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:34,819
Have a goal.

1677
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:36,342
Accomplish it.

1678
01:22:36,386 --> 01:22:38,214
Right, put some love on it.

1679
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,261
The man is taking control.

1680
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:46,613
Yeah.

SWEETWATER:
Free for Vandeweghe.

1682
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:52,837
Oh!

1683
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,535
Don't worry about it,
you'll get the hang of it.

1684
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:56,623
What are you guys
talking about it?

1685
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:57,842
His pass is way more
faster than you.

1686
01:22:57,885 --> 01:22:59,191
Alright, gentlemen.

1687
01:22:59,235 --> 01:23:01,193
Enough clowning around.

1688
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:03,630
Max, let's run up some plays.

1689
01:23:03,674 --> 01:23:05,154
A little half court offense.

1690
01:23:05,197 --> 01:23:06,503
Let's go, gentlemen.

1691
01:23:06,546 --> 01:23:07,721
[whistles]

1692
01:23:07,765 --> 01:23:08,722
Okay.

1693
01:23:08,766 --> 01:23:10,637
Keep it, keep it moving.

1694
01:23:10,681 --> 01:23:12,030
Find the extra pass.

1695
01:23:12,074 --> 01:23:13,162
Get that momentum.

1696
01:23:13,205 --> 01:23:15,860
Get that-- okay.

1697
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:17,253
Alright. [chuckles]

1698
01:23:17,296 --> 01:23:21,083
I'm telling you, Mo,
this story is big.

1699
01:23:21,126 --> 01:23:22,867
All the radio
and the news...

1700
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:25,000
Oh come on, come on.

1701
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:27,176
Everybody likes good press.

1702
01:23:27,219 --> 01:23:28,699
The attention's good
for everyone.

1703
01:23:28,742 --> 01:23:30,701
Not everyone.

1704
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:32,964
Ah, that's nothing.

1705
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,922
All these guys,
they're gonna fall into line,

1706
01:23:34,966 --> 01:23:36,141
once they see the fans
in the seats.

1707
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:37,621
Just to admit to me,

1708
01:23:37,664 --> 01:23:41,364
this is causing some
serious problems.

1709
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:42,887
You met the man.

1710
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:44,236
Now that I know which one he is.

1711
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,716
No,
but you've never met him, right?

1712
01:23:45,759 --> 01:23:46,891
No, I haven't met him,
but he's in the middle practice.

1713
01:23:46,934 --> 01:23:48,066
Well, let's go say hi to him.

1714
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:49,372
Come on, let's go say hi.

1715
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:50,851
Well, he's busy.

1716
01:23:50,895 --> 01:23:52,157
I don't wanna break
his concentration--

1717
01:23:52,201 --> 01:23:56,074
Mo, Mo, he's not gonna
bite you, okay.

1718
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:00,078
Hey Sweets,

1719
01:24:01,906 --> 01:24:04,256
I want you to meet
the President of the League.

1720
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,128
This is Maurice Podoloff.

1721
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:09,087
Mo, meet
Nat Sweetwater Clifton.

1722
01:24:09,131 --> 01:24:12,177
Mr. Podoloff,
a pleasure, sir.

1723
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:13,265
Ah.

1724
01:24:13,309 --> 01:24:16,007
Sergeant, it is my honor.

1725
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,357
Oh, listen, it's...
It's nice to be here.

1726
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:22,579
Actually, before I forget,
this is yours.

1727
01:24:27,758 --> 01:24:30,369
A check,
to a colored man?

1728
01:24:32,241 --> 01:24:34,069
That'll bounce higher
than a basketball.

1729
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,854
- Right.
- Ah.

1730
01:24:36,897 --> 01:24:39,030
If we could figure out
a cash situation.

1731
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:41,641
Thank you, Sergeant,

1732
01:24:41,685 --> 01:24:44,035
for bringing it
to our attention.

1733
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,950
And I want to tell you
how happy we are

1734
01:24:45,993 --> 01:24:49,127
that it's you, who's breaking
the color line in the NBA.

01:25:13,325 --> 01:25:14,761
Someone's here early.

1740
01:25:14,805 --> 01:25:16,546
Oh, going to get some shots up,
you know,

1741
01:25:16,589 --> 01:25:17,808
get stretched out and all.

1742
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:19,331
How about little one-on-one
rematch?

1743
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:20,419
I don't think you want that,

1744
01:25:20,463 --> 01:25:21,812
- coach.
- I was trying

1745
01:25:21,855 --> 01:25:22,987
- to kill your confidence.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1746
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:24,293
Have you guys seen
today's paper?

1747
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:26,686
Huh? Here, read, read.

1748
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,123

01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,777
Earl Lloyd played for the

1750
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:32,823

"Earl Lloyd...

I don't under...

1757
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:45,705
The season starts tonight.

1758
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:47,446
Yeah, supposed to, should have.

1759
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,578
Didn't!

1760
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:51,885
[sighs]

1761
01:25:54,236 --> 01:25:57,891
Listen, that's good
for Earl Lloyd.

1762
01:26:02,592 --> 01:26:04,681
I think I know who's
responsible for this.

1763
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,991
[telephone rings in background]

1764
01:26:11,035 --> 01:26:11,992
[door opens]

1765
01:26:13,255 --> 01:26:14,473
Hey Mo, what's this uh,

1766
01:26:14,517 --> 01:26:18,912
October 31st game
in Rochester crap, huh?

1767
01:26:18,956 --> 01:26:20,958
It's not even
a regular season game.

1768
01:26:21,001 --> 01:26:22,960
According to the official
NBA schedule,

1769
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:24,222
the season starts tonight.

1770
01:26:24,266 --> 01:26:25,745
November 1st,
in the Garden!

1771
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:27,225
Yeah, not this year, Ned.

1772
01:26:27,269 --> 01:26:28,487
"Oh, don't worry, Ned.

1773
01:26:28,531 --> 01:26:30,228
I got your back.
I'll fight your war for you."

1774
01:26:30,272 --> 01:26:31,577
Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure!

1775
01:26:31,621 --> 01:26:33,536
Hey! Hey!

1776
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:35,320
Just for the record,

1777
01:26:35,364 --> 01:26:38,323
the president has every right
to change the schedule

1778
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:39,672
at his discretion.

1779
01:26:39,716 --> 01:26:40,891
It's in the bylaws.
Look it up.

1780
01:26:40,934 --> 01:26:42,153
Why'd you do it, Mo?

1781
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,676
Why? Why?

1782
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,375
There was a prediction
of a severe weather storm

1783
01:26:46,418 --> 01:26:49,378
in Rochester tonight!

1784
01:26:49,421 --> 01:26:50,553
So, I changed the schedule.

1785
01:26:50,596 --> 01:26:52,337
Oh, what a load of bull.

1786
01:26:52,381 --> 01:26:54,470
Yesterday, was great
for the league.

1787
01:26:54,513 --> 01:26:57,212
No! It was fantastic for the
league!

1788
01:26:57,255 --> 01:27:00,084
But that was supposed
to be Sweetwater's moment!

1789
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:02,086
Tonight! In my Garden!

1790
01:27:02,129 --> 01:27:04,088
In New York!
Everybody knew that!

1791
01:27:04,131 --> 01:27:05,350
You knew that!

1792
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:09,398
You took it away
from the game!

1793
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:10,660
From the fans!

1794
01:27:12,357 --> 01:27:13,750
But more importantly,
you took it away

1795
01:27:13,793 --> 01:27:14,968
from Sweetwater.

1796
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,624
Too much power for one negro.

1797
01:27:18,668 --> 01:27:20,452
Too big a moment
for the bozos, right?

1798
01:27:20,496 --> 01:27:22,628
Hey. There's nothing I can do
about predicting the weather.

1799
01:27:22,672 --> 01:27:25,109
Oh, don't give me that crap, Mo!

1800
01:27:25,152 --> 01:27:27,242
New York City is center stage!

1801
01:27:27,285 --> 01:27:29,896
The impact here would have been
heard everywhere.

1802
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,985
Just level with me.
Give me a reason.

1803
01:27:32,029 --> 01:27:34,205
You just heard it,
you just said it,

1804
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,902
you just heard it.

1805
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:37,948
Change is happening.

1806
01:27:37,991 --> 01:27:41,430
But I don't know that my city
can take it, do you?

1807
01:27:41,473 --> 01:27:42,779
Are you sure?

1808
01:27:42,822 --> 01:27:45,303
I don't care about uh...

1809
01:27:45,347 --> 01:27:46,783
confusion in Rochester.

1810
01:27:46,826 --> 01:27:48,785
Who cares?

1811
01:27:48,828 --> 01:27:52,092
But Madison Square Garden,
in the middle of Manhattan?

1812
01:27:53,224 --> 01:27:55,052
You want blood on the floor?

1813
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:59,317
You want rioting
on Madison Square Garden?

1814
01:28:00,536 --> 01:28:02,320
Huh, I don't-- I don't want
that.

1815
01:28:02,364 --> 01:28:03,713
I don't want that.

1816
01:28:05,758 --> 01:28:07,543
Is that a good enough reason
for you?

1817
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,026
So, Earl Lloyd, Rochester,

1818
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:15,028
he-- he gets to make history,
and we got what?

1819
01:28:15,072 --> 01:28:17,988
Nothing.
Sweetwater gets nothing.

1820
01:28:18,031 --> 01:28:21,034
Because of what? Some-- some
freaking scheduling glitch.

1821
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:23,863
Some, some freaking
history making.

1822
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:28,477
History-making scheduling
glitch.

1823
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:41,664
You gonna play
Sweetwater tonight?

1824
01:28:41,707 --> 01:28:43,492
[♪♪♪]

1825
01:28:43,535 --> 01:28:44,406
What if I do?

1826
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:48,192
Dangerous, could be trouble.

1827
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,630
I certainly hope so.

1828
01:28:51,674 --> 01:28:52,370
[door opens]

1829
01:28:52,414 --> 01:28:53,893
Save me a seat.

1830
01:28:53,937 --> 01:28:55,504
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1831
01:28:58,898 --> 01:29:03,512
[crowd cheers]

1832
01:29:03,555 --> 01:29:04,687
HOWARD:
And tonight marks

1833
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:07,777
Nat Sweetwater Clifton's
first game

1834
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,387
as an NBA player.

1835
01:29:09,431 --> 01:29:10,693
That remains to be seen,

1836
01:29:10,736 --> 01:29:13,304
if Clifton can really complete
in the NBA.

1837
01:29:15,437 --> 01:29:16,916
Set the tone early.

1838
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,265
Fundamental basketball.

1839
01:29:18,309 --> 01:29:19,658
Leave your heart
on that court.

1840
01:29:23,445 --> 01:29:25,229
Sweet, you're starting.

1841
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,723
SPECTATOR 1:
Hey, that's Sweetwater!

1842
01:29:40,766 --> 01:29:44,466
[spectators cheering]

1843
01:30:27,334 --> 01:30:28,466
And this is the moment

1844
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:30,773
we've all been waiting for.

1845
01:30:30,816 --> 01:30:32,427
History in the making.

1846
01:30:38,476 --> 01:30:40,652
Folks, I wish you could see
what I'm seeing right now.

1847
01:30:40,696 --> 01:30:43,394
The emotion on Sweetwater's face

1848
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,265
and the crowd here looking
at Clifton,

1849
01:30:45,309 --> 01:30:47,790
there is history in the air
here at the Garden.

1850
01:30:50,183 --> 01:30:53,273
[crowd cheering]

1851
01:30:54,884 --> 01:30:56,320
NBA REFEREE 1:
That's a travel.

1852
01:30:56,363 --> 01:30:57,495
Indianapolis ball.

1853
01:30:59,845 --> 01:31:01,456
Good call, good call.

1854
01:31:03,066 --> 01:31:04,284
SWEETWATER:
Rebound, rebound.

1855
01:31:04,328 --> 01:31:05,808
Rebound. Rebound.

1856
01:31:10,595 --> 01:31:12,162
HAROLD:
There we go. Break it.

1857
01:31:12,205 --> 01:31:13,250
On the break.

1858
01:31:14,512 --> 01:31:15,034
Beautiful.

1859
01:31:15,078 --> 01:31:16,253
[crowd cheers]

1860
01:31:16,296 --> 01:31:17,994
Yeah!

1861
01:31:18,037 --> 01:31:20,344
No! No basket!

1862
01:31:20,387 --> 01:31:21,476
That's a travel.

1863
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:22,868
Blue ball.

1864
01:31:22,912 --> 01:31:24,130
What are you talking about,
Donnie?

1865
01:31:24,174 --> 01:31:25,131
What are you calling here?

1866
01:31:25,175 --> 01:31:26,350
[crowd boos]

1867
01:31:26,393 --> 01:31:27,569
Good call, Donnie.

1868
01:31:33,749 --> 01:31:34,358
OLYMPIAN PLAYER 1:
Come on.

1869
01:31:34,401 --> 01:31:36,273
[Referee whistles]

1870
01:31:36,316 --> 01:31:39,537
That's a foul,
number eight New York.

1871
01:31:39,581 --> 01:31:40,886
Olympian ball.

1872
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:45,195
HOWARD:
Olympians with the ball.

1873
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:47,110
It's up, it's good.

1874
01:31:47,153 --> 01:31:48,328
A good start
for the Olympians.

1875
01:31:48,372 --> 01:31:49,547
What a great move.

1876
01:31:51,723 --> 01:31:53,595
JOE:
Open there.

1877
01:31:53,638 --> 01:31:54,857
Get it to Sweets.

1878
01:31:57,686 --> 01:31:59,383
HOWARD:
Out of bounds, on the Knicks,

1879
01:31:59,426 --> 01:32:01,559
and Sweetwater continues
to struggle

1880
01:32:01,603 --> 01:32:03,387
in these opening minutes
of the game, folks.

1881
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,911
Oh yeah! That's it.

1882
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:07,217
That's what we're looking for.

1883
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:09,001
Come on, guys.

1884
01:32:09,045 --> 01:32:10,568
JOE:
We gotta put past. There you go.

1885
01:32:10,612 --> 01:32:12,570
HOWARD:
McGuire passes to Gallatin,

1886
01:32:12,614 --> 01:32:14,311
hook shot,
and it's no good.

1887
01:32:14,354 --> 01:32:17,314
- JOE: It's okay, kid.
- CROWD: Oh!

1888
01:32:17,357 --> 01:32:19,969
Sweetwater goes down hard.

1889
01:32:20,012 --> 01:32:21,840
Oh my goodness,
I hope he's not injured.

1890
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:25,278
That's a foul.

1891
01:32:25,322 --> 01:32:26,976
JOE:
Get the pass. There you go.

1892
01:32:27,019 --> 01:32:28,151
There you go,
keep it moving.

1893
01:32:29,631 --> 01:32:31,415
Get back on team.
Get back on team.

1894
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:32,416
Come on, Sweets.

1895
01:32:32,459 --> 01:32:33,809
HOWARD:
And the Olympians score,

1896
01:32:33,852 --> 01:32:36,246
as they continue
to build on their league.

1897
01:32:39,336 --> 01:32:40,990
JOE:
There we go, there we go.

1898
01:32:41,033 --> 01:32:43,296
HOWARD:
And here's Sweetwater, with a little razzle dazzle.

1899
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:45,081
A beautiful move
to the basket, and it's good!

1900
01:32:45,124 --> 01:32:46,996
[Referee whistles]

1901
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:48,606
Let's go. Giddy up, giddy up.

1902
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:50,086
Yeah!

1903
01:32:50,129 --> 01:32:51,348
JOE:
Hold on.

1904
01:32:59,486 --> 01:33:00,400
[Referee whistles]

1905
01:33:00,444 --> 01:33:04,317
[spectators cheer]

1906
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:05,971
What was that, Howard?

1907
01:33:06,015 --> 01:33:07,625
I think that was a new kind
of shot.

1908
01:33:07,669 --> 01:33:10,497
Looked like a donut being
dunked in a cup of coffee.

1909
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:11,586
Let's call it a "dunk".

1910
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:14,980
[Donnie whistles]

NBA REFEREE 1:
What's going on?

1912
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:19,245
Was that...

1913
01:33:19,289 --> 01:33:20,638
[mumbles]

1914
01:33:20,682 --> 01:33:21,813
I got it, I got it.

1915
01:33:21,857 --> 01:33:23,467
Alright, that's gonna be
a technical foul.

1916
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:25,034
[crowd boos]

1917
01:33:25,077 --> 01:33:27,602
DONNIE:
No basket, no basket. Indianapolis ball.

1918
01:33:27,645 --> 01:33:28,864
Technical foul?

1919
01:33:28,907 --> 01:33:30,213
- DONNIE: Yeah.
- No, no basket?

1920
01:33:30,256 --> 01:33:32,258
Did you miss me doing this?
This is no basket.

1921
01:33:32,302 --> 01:33:34,260
I don't understand,
but what is the actual call?

1922
01:33:34,304 --> 01:33:35,348
DONNIE:
They did not do a basketball move.

1923
01:33:35,392 --> 01:33:36,785
This is just because,
you didn't--

1924
01:33:36,828 --> 01:33:39,483
you've never seen it before,
doesn't make it illegal.

1925
01:33:39,526 --> 01:33:40,919
We got a technical foul.

1926
01:33:40,963 --> 01:33:42,442
In number eight
of the New York Knicks.

1927
01:33:42,486 --> 01:33:44,314
- Tell me what the call is.
- Get off the court!

1928
01:33:44,357 --> 01:33:45,620
Get behind the line!

1929
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:46,969
You're-- you're out of line,
Donnie!

1930
01:33:47,012 --> 01:33:49,145
Here we go. Technical foul!

1931
01:33:49,188 --> 01:33:50,363
All the coach in the Knicks
have it. [indistinct speech]

1932
01:33:50,407 --> 01:33:52,278
That's a ridiculous call!

1933
01:33:52,322 --> 01:33:54,672
- You don't know...
- I did not want to do this, Joe.

1934
01:33:54,716 --> 01:33:55,804
I did not wanna do it.

1935
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:56,979
I didn't wanna do it!

1936
01:33:57,022 --> 01:33:57,936
Did not want to do it.

1937
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:59,416
[Referee whistling]

1938
01:34:01,113 --> 01:34:01,810
DONNIE:
Let's go. [indistinct speech]

1939
01:34:01,853 --> 01:34:02,898
We're gonna...

1940
01:34:02,941 --> 01:34:04,682
You have to stop
with the hotdogging.

1941
01:34:04,726 --> 01:34:05,857
You think there's
an outside chance

1942
01:34:05,901 --> 01:34:07,598
it was a bad call, Joe?

1943
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:09,644
Have a seat.
Simmons in for Sweetwater.

1944
01:34:09,687 --> 01:34:10,601
- Coach--
- Don't--

1945
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:11,689
don't even give them
a reason.

1946
01:34:11,733 --> 01:34:12,690
Don't give 'em a reason.

1947
01:34:12,734 --> 01:34:14,910
Have a seat. Thank you.

1948
01:34:14,953 --> 01:34:16,563
Simmons, get in there
for Sweetwater.

1949
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:18,130
Let's go. Back out there.

1950
01:34:18,174 --> 01:34:19,654
- SIMMONS: Alright, let's go.
- JOE: Keep it up,

1951
01:34:19,697 --> 01:34:21,046
don't stop moving.

1952
01:34:22,744 --> 01:34:25,094
Well, it looks like
Sweetwater's gonna be benched.

1953
01:34:25,137 --> 01:34:27,531
It's clear to
the fans here anyway,

1954
01:34:27,574 --> 01:34:29,446
that his flashy game,

1955
01:34:29,489 --> 01:34:31,883
is throwin' a curve ball
into the NBA.

1956
01:34:38,237 --> 01:34:39,325
JOE:
Here we go.

1957
01:34:39,369 --> 01:34:41,023
HOWARD:
McGuire passes to Gallatin.

1958
01:34:45,505 --> 01:34:46,637
Hook shot.

1959
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:47,986
It's good!

1960
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:51,294
Back on D. There we go.

1961
01:34:51,337 --> 01:34:53,426
HOWARD:
Here come the Olympians.

1962
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,732
And they score again.

1963
01:34:54,776 --> 01:34:58,170
[crowd cheering]

1964
01:35:02,348 --> 01:35:03,785
JOE:
Keep it moving. Get that rebound.

1965
01:35:03,828 --> 01:35:05,569
HOWARD:
Vandeweghe misses the shot.

1966
01:35:05,612 --> 01:35:06,701
Back on team!

1967
01:35:14,099 --> 01:35:16,754
[buzzer rings]

1968
01:35:16,798 --> 01:35:19,801
That my friends, marks the end
of the first half.

1969
01:35:21,193 --> 01:35:23,239
JOE:
Look, okay, let's not beat ourselves up.

1970
01:35:23,282 --> 01:35:24,849
Alright? Let-- hey!

1971
01:35:24,893 --> 01:35:26,764
Let's not get down!
Let's not get down!

1972
01:35:26,808 --> 01:35:28,897
Take a breath, everybody.

1973
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:30,289
Fundamentals.

1974
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:31,943
That's what wins games.

1975
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:34,772
That's what wins
championships.

1976
01:35:34,816 --> 01:35:36,818
Alright, take a beat. Be smart.

1977
01:35:36,861 --> 01:35:38,341
Find the open man.

1978
01:35:38,384 --> 01:35:40,125
Take that extra pass,
that's alright,

1979
01:35:40,169 --> 01:35:43,520
and find our rhythm
offensively.

1980
01:35:43,563 --> 01:35:45,652
That's it.
Don't get in our own way.

1981
01:35:45,696 --> 01:35:47,045
- Alright.
- Show me some fundamentals

1982
01:35:47,089 --> 01:35:48,568
out there!
Let's go guys!

1983
01:35:48,612 --> 01:35:49,831
MCGUIRE:
Let's go, Sweets. I know we can do this!

1984
01:35:49,874 --> 01:35:51,484
- We can do this!
- Let's go, Sweets. Come on.

1985
01:35:51,528 --> 01:35:52,572
This is the half that matters.

1986
01:35:52,616 --> 01:35:53,878
Come on,
it's a whole new ball game.

1987
01:35:53,922 --> 01:35:55,053
Let's go.

1988
01:35:56,968 --> 01:36:00,189
I get one more technical foul,
and I'm out, right?

1989
01:36:00,232 --> 01:36:01,625
Yeah, you're out.

1990
01:36:01,668 --> 01:36:03,105
That's why you're not gonna
get a technical foul.

1991
01:36:03,148 --> 01:36:04,410
You're gonna get 30 points.

1992
01:36:04,454 --> 01:36:06,456
Let's go.

1993
01:36:06,499 --> 01:36:09,415
See, when you first come to me,
you were talking about change.

1994
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:13,245
I still believe in that.

1995
01:36:14,725 --> 01:36:17,684
Change I'm talking about,
though is changing the game.

1996
01:36:19,164 --> 01:36:21,340
You see, this ain't about the
color of my skin no more.

1997
01:36:22,689 --> 01:36:24,953
It's about what I do.

1998
01:36:26,998 --> 01:36:28,304
And how I do it.

1999
01:36:29,827 --> 01:36:32,874
It's about being true
to the game of basketball.

2000
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:35,877
And right now,

2001
01:36:37,269 --> 01:36:39,489
you've seen it
with your own eyes.

2002
01:36:44,668 --> 01:36:46,844
My game don't belong here.

2003
01:36:51,893 --> 01:36:54,286
My game belong on the streets.

2004
01:36:55,766 --> 01:36:57,420
Not in the NBA.

2005
01:36:58,725 --> 01:36:59,988
[licks teeth]

2006
01:37:00,031 --> 01:37:01,859
Figures.

2007
01:37:01,903 --> 01:37:04,993
Oh, wonder if I can convince
Abe to give me my 12,500 back?

2008
01:37:05,036 --> 01:37:07,560
Oh, cut the gas!

2009
01:37:07,604 --> 01:37:09,693
12,5?

2010
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,392
For my ass?

2011
01:37:17,483 --> 01:37:18,789
Damn!

2012
01:37:26,318 --> 01:37:29,408
It's uh, it's not about
the money, Sweets.

2013
01:37:30,714 --> 01:37:32,107
Never was.

2014
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,893
- I'll see you on the court.
- Yeah.

2015
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,767
And if you're feeling up
to breaking the scoring record,

2016
01:37:40,811 --> 01:37:42,857
we're down by 17.

2017
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,641
[chuckles]

2018
01:37:46,251 --> 01:37:49,515
[children shouting]

2019
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,696
Yeah!

2020
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:57,697
Go!

2021
01:37:57,741 --> 01:37:59,612
Let's go!

2022
01:37:59,656 --> 01:38:02,659
Nat Clifton,
in my office.

2023
01:38:02,702 --> 01:38:03,878
Right.

2024
01:38:10,536 --> 01:38:11,973
I gotta tell you,
that that was

2025
01:38:12,016 --> 01:38:14,540
one of the most incredible
performances

2026
01:38:14,584 --> 01:38:17,630
on the basketball court
that I've ever seen.

2027
01:38:19,632 --> 01:38:21,243
As much as I loved it,

2028
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:25,116
don't you ever do that again!

2029
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:28,119
Huh?

2030
01:38:28,163 --> 01:38:30,948
They don't like your style.

2031
01:38:30,992 --> 01:38:33,646
Your hotdogging bigger style.

2032
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:36,214
Even though it's full of grace,
they don't like it.

2033
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:41,741
They want you
to maybe grab a rebound,

2034
01:38:41,785 --> 01:38:43,265
block a shot or two.

2035
01:38:43,308 --> 01:38:45,223
Yes, win the game.

2036
01:38:46,746 --> 01:38:49,184
But just not like
how you did it today.

2037
01:38:51,577 --> 01:38:54,189
And then
when they get off your back,

2038
01:38:55,668 --> 01:38:57,192
and let you stand up straight,

2039
01:38:59,455 --> 01:39:03,154
the world would then be able
to see what you do.

2040
01:39:06,592 --> 01:39:08,943
HOWARD:
We're five minutes into the second half of play, folks,

2041
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:12,511
and there's still no sign
of Sweetwater Clifton.

2042
01:39:12,555 --> 01:39:14,122
MAN:
That's beautiful.

2043
01:39:14,165 --> 01:39:15,558
Excellent!

2044
01:39:15,601 --> 01:39:17,473
HOWARD:
And the Olympians score again!

2045
01:39:24,784 --> 01:39:27,222
MARTY:
Vandeweghe shoots and scores!

2046
01:39:30,051 --> 01:39:32,140
HOWARD:
Sweetwater has finally rejoined his team

2047
01:39:32,183 --> 01:39:33,358
on the bench.

2048
01:39:40,887 --> 01:39:44,021
[crowd cheering]

2049
01:39:44,065 --> 01:39:46,371
JOE:
Sweets, let's go.

2050
01:39:46,415 --> 01:39:47,807
FAN 1:
Come on, here we go!

2051
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:52,073
[spectators cheering]

2052
01:39:52,116 --> 01:39:53,726
HOWARD:
And Sweetwater Clifton

2053
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:56,207
is coming back
into the game, folks.

2054
01:40:00,168 --> 01:40:01,343
[Referee whistles]

2055
01:40:01,386 --> 01:40:03,345
Ball! Ball!

2056
01:40:03,388 --> 01:40:04,737
[indistinct chatter]

2057
01:40:09,046 --> 01:40:10,265
Yeah, get it, go.

2058
01:40:12,354 --> 01:40:13,616
Ah.

2059
01:40:16,184 --> 01:40:19,883
[cheering]

2060
01:40:19,926 --> 01:40:21,058
How do you like them apples?

2061
01:40:21,102 --> 01:40:22,407
That's why I like it.

2062
01:40:25,062 --> 01:40:27,804
MARTY:
Get inside, get inside and rebound.

2063
01:40:27,847 --> 01:40:28,805
Let's go!

2064
01:40:28,848 --> 01:40:29,849
HOWARD:
Clifton blocks the shot!

2065
01:40:29,893 --> 01:40:31,764
DONNIE:
No!

2066
01:40:31,808 --> 01:40:34,071
Foul on number eight
on the Knicks!

2067
01:40:34,115 --> 01:40:35,551
What are you talking about?
That was the best

2068
01:40:35,594 --> 01:40:36,682
freakin' block ever.

2069
01:40:36,726 --> 01:40:38,032
Right here.

2070
01:40:38,075 --> 01:40:39,033
Inches away.

2071
01:40:39,076 --> 01:40:40,643
[crowd boos]

2072
01:40:40,686 --> 01:40:42,079
- Watch out.
- Alright. It's alright.

2073
01:40:42,123 --> 01:40:43,863
- Alright.
- Sweetwater Clifton

2074
01:40:43,907 --> 01:40:44,951
has just been handed

2075
01:40:44,995 --> 01:40:47,302
his fourth foul of the game.

2076
01:40:47,345 --> 01:40:50,392
One more,
and it's bye bye, Sweetwater.

2077
01:40:50,435 --> 01:40:52,829
And now Coach Lapchick
has to make the inevitable move

2078
01:40:52,872 --> 01:40:54,831
and pull Sweetwater out
of the game.

2079
01:40:56,224 --> 01:40:58,443
HOWARD:
It's back to the bench for Sweetwater.

2080
01:40:58,487 --> 01:40:59,575
JOE:
Get that extra pass.

2081
01:40:59,618 --> 01:41:00,619
Don't back down.

2082
01:41:00,663 --> 01:41:02,012
Get that rebound. Get a rebound.

2083
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:03,231
HOWARD:
Another miss.

2084
01:41:03,274 --> 01:41:04,232
Get back on D, everyone.

2085
01:41:04,275 --> 01:41:05,494
Get back on D.

2086
01:41:05,537 --> 01:41:07,322
What are you doing?
Get back on D.

2087
01:41:09,759 --> 01:41:12,022
HOWARD:
The Knicks, unable to score, as the Olympians

2088
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:12,979
- extend their league.
- JOE: Alright, that's it.

2089
01:41:13,023 --> 01:41:13,850
We're getting a time-out.

2090
01:41:13,893 --> 01:41:15,765
Time-out.

2091
01:41:15,808 --> 01:41:17,071
Time-out. New York.

2092
01:41:17,114 --> 01:41:18,942
There's a time-out
on the floor.

2093
01:41:18,985 --> 01:41:21,466
Don't ever give up on a play!

2094
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:23,642
I don't know what you're doing.

2095
01:41:23,686 --> 01:41:26,210
Now-- Wh-- what happened
to our defense, okay?

2096
01:41:26,254 --> 01:41:28,299
We're gonna run some pick
and rolls from McGuire.

2097
01:41:28,343 --> 01:41:30,388
- Coach--
- Don't stop... what?

2098
01:41:30,432 --> 01:41:32,869
We're a much better team
with Sweets in there.

2099
01:41:32,912 --> 01:41:34,958
Listen, coach,
you put me on that floor,

2100
01:41:35,001 --> 01:41:37,134
all focus goes on me.

2101
01:41:37,178 --> 01:41:40,181
We can use that
to our advantage, alright?

2102
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:43,097
- Let us take this game over!
- Alright.

2103
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:43,967
[Referee whistling]

2104
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:45,055
You heard the man, let's go.

2105
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,970
Come on, guys.
Let's go, let's go.

2106
01:41:47,013 --> 01:41:50,930

This is a crucial moment
in the ball game.

If it goes the other way,
Clifton is out.

Alright, we got a personal foul.

The foul was on Gallatin.

DONNIE:
Two shot Blue.

2164
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:37,358
It's gonna be number 11.

2165
01:44:37,401 --> 01:44:39,838
It's not gonna go
on Sweetwater Clifton.

2166
01:44:39,882 --> 01:44:41,579
He will stay in the ball game.

2167
01:44:41,623 --> 01:44:44,016
The Knicks just dodged
a huge bullet right there.

He's looking around.

2179
01:45:24,535 --> 01:45:26,450
He's gonna take the ball
himself.

a barn burner, Marty.

2188

What are the Knicks gonna
do now?
