1
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,714
You want some?

2
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,563
- How'd we do?
- $27.

3
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,232
Nobody questions shrink wrap.

4
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,072
- Are you hungry?
- A little bit. The dog probably is a lot.

5
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,116
Good job.

6
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,452
Can you stop touching my hair?

7
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,746
Hey, his collar slipped off.

8
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,831
And you waited right here.

9
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,084
What a good boy. Yes, you are!

10
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,337
Oh, we missed you too, buddy.

11
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,174
I hope he knows what we go through
just to feed him.

12
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,551
All right, here you go, Friday.

13
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,847
I've never seen a dog
eat that much. Ever.

14
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,269
Here you go.

15
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,689
Nice catch.

16
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,650
Go.

17
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,363
Meet us at home, Friday.

18
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,614
Excuse me, miss.

19
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,450
That's her.
She's the one who ripped me off.

20
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,369
Thank goodness you're here, Officer.

21
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,955
This guy's been stalking me all day,
and it's really freaking me out.

22
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,311
Okay, thanks. I really appreciate it.

23
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,356
Either I call you or
I have to fill out all the forms.

24
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,775
- Love to Alice.
- Yeah. Same to Carol.

25
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,152
Central City PD, precinct desk.

26
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,780
Hold on, I'll transfer you.

27
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,325
Put it down.

28
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,077
- Hey.
- Hey, Bernie.

29
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,789
Don't "Hey, Bernie" me.

30
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,042
You know I have half a mind
to leave you two here?

31
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,712
You're sprung. Come on, let's go.

32
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,842
Hurry up.

33
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,388
I'll do the rest of my yelling
while I'm taking you back.

34
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,770
Look, the guy
could have pressed charges.

35
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,648
You sold him a rock in a box
for 20 bucks.

36
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,192
Oh, that's funny?

37
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,864
It's not funny. It's anything but funny.

38
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,075
What if they'd called Carl and Lois
instead of me?

39
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:38,039
I guess you'd have to find us
new foster parents, then.

40
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,086
Is that what you're trying to do?

41
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,340
You guys, that's
a very dangerous game, I'm telling you.

42
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,967
One and...

43
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,557
No.

44
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,437
You know, the word "harmonizing"
comes from the word "harmony. "

45
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,690
- So?
- So I'm saying you're still half a step off.

46
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,860
Oh, really? Well, that's funny
because my vocal instructor,

47
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,989
who is a paid vocal instructor,
didn't notice that, but you did.

48
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,699
Here's the note.

49
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,085
You're late.
And you interrupted rehearsal.

50
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,712
I'm very sorry.

51
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,964
Get in there. Hurry up.

52
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,302
Babe, maybe we should skip this one
and just play the hit.

53
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,222
- They're all hits, baby.
- You're right.

54
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,098
- Hey, Bernie.
- Carl.

55
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,226
Your food's on your trays.

56
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,606
Yummy! It's too bad we already ate.

57
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,234
Fine. It'll be lunch tomorrow.

58
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,612
All right, could we just get back
to the issue at hand, okay?

59
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,572
I'm a kind woman. Okay?

60
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:57,160
In fact, everyone's always asking,
"Lois, why are you so kind?"

61
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,996
But we have rules. Okay?

62
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:04,501
We serve dinner at a certain time, so
we can finish dinner at a certain time.

63
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,588
So we can drop our rock manifesto
on the world at a certain time.

64
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,804
Okay, but those times have come
and gone. So...

65
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,305
Oh, where were they?

66
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,229
Look, this whole thing is my fault. Okay?

67
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:29,484
We were just getting caught up
and we were having so much fun...

68
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,902
Whoa. Yeah.

69
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,823
...that I just lost track of time.
I'm sorry, really. My apologies.

70
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,908
Now, why don't we just
get them to their room

71
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:42,122
and you guys can continue
making that magic.

72
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,634
- Thanks for covering for us.
- Andi, Andi. Listen!

73
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,053
You cannot afford to screw this up.

74
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,639
You've only been here
two months, okay?

75
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,517
This is your fifth set
of foster parents in three years.

76
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,062
The Johnsons don't count,
we were there for two hours.

77
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,316
Do you know the reaction I get
when I tell people

78
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,776
I'm trying to place
11 and 16-year-old siblings?

79
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,488
It ain't a good one. Okay?
You guys mess this up, that's it.

80
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,157
I don't have any more favors
I can call in.

81
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,367
I'm gonna have to
place you two separately.

82
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,954
No! You know I won't
let that happen, Bernie.

83
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,497
We stay together.

84
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,708
All right, then
take a little advice from me, okay?

85
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,170
A technique that I've learned.
When somebody who I...

86
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,799
...who I don't particularly like is saying
something that I don't want to hear,

87
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,053
I just nod and I go, "Mmm-hmm. "
It works wonders.

88
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,929
Mmm-hmm.

89
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,228
Okay, I'm through with you guys.

90
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,067
I'll tell you what, I better not get
any more phone calls

91
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,320
about a trick with a brick
or a scam with a ham...

92
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:09,209
Okay, it was a good talk, Bernie.
Thank you very much for stopping by.

93
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,086
What are you guys...

94
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,438
Good boy. Somebody's tired today, huh?

95
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,190
I am.

96
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,619
Friday.

97
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,998
- Andi.
- Yeah.

98
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,875
- Friday's gone.
- What?

99
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,046
- Friday, come here.
- Where'd he go?

100
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,927
Good God.

101
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,972
You two are just a bundle of energy.

102
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,850
Good morning!

103
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,102
Stop shouting.

104
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:56,274
My vocal instructor said getting
frightened is bad for my pitch.

105
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,151
What are you doing up so early?

106
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,029
- Just thought we'd get some...
- Breakfast!

107
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,658
All right, so, I unlocked the pantry.

108
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,495
Your cereal's in there.
You know how to get it.

109
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,747
I'm not your servant. All right?

110
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,834
I am obliged to prepare two meals
a day, that's lunch and dinner.

111
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,420
Friday!

112
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,047
What?

113
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,926
I said,
"Bruce, what is the day after Thursday?"

114
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,594
- Friday!
- Thanks.

115
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,972
Fine. Get weird on me.
I can handle weird.

116
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,734
Okay, I don't need your attitude
about setting the table, okay?

117
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,277
Don't be lazy.

118
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,116
It needs cinnamon.

119
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,036
Or is it cinnamon that Carl's allergic to?

120
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,206
Well, one way to find out, I guess.

121
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,459
Let's see him harmonize
with a tongue the size of a beehive.

122
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,420
Wait! You just reminded me
of this really funny story.

123
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,589
I was walking and I stepped on a bee
and it stung me.

124
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,925
So then, I went and took care of my foot,

125
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,221
then I went back for the bee
to throw it outside and I thought,

126
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,391
"You know, I'd be safe because
bees can't sting you more than once. "

127
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,270
Right? I mean, right? It was crazy.
I mean, isn't that crazy?

128
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,231
Excuse me.

129
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,693
You owe me 30 seconds of my life,
and I will collect.

130
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,244
Thanks for the heart attack.

131
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,913
Of course I checked in there,
maybe they're in the kids' room.

132
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,374
Carl, did you eat the bacon?

133
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,209
Stay close, Friday.

134
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,926
Did I leave my whitening strips in here?

135
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,217
He'd usually be here by now.

136
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,386
You know, maybe he can't hear it.

137
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,930
It's mealtime.
He could hear it on the moon.

138
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,557
He's probably just wandering around.

139
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,357
Friday! Friday!

140
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,654
- What are we gonna do?
- Come on. Friday!

141
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,493
Friday! Come on!
Maybe he ran down this alley.

142
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,204
Friday!

143
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,335
You don't think he went in there,
do you?

144
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,677
No. Why would he go in there?
He's probably just out looking for food.

145
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,971
Friday!

146
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,433
How cute. I want one.

147
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,445
Nice haircut.

148
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,907
Thanks, Dave.
I was hoping you'd notice.

149
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,869
Oh, I was actually
talking about the Pomeranian.

150
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,705
But yours is, yours is really nice, too.

151
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,499
- You did something new to it.
- I did.

152
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,835
And I'm pretty sure you could tell
when I first got it done

153
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,254
because you kind of looked at me
and then looked away,

154
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,548
and then looked back like,
"Hey, something's different. "

155
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,009
But then you didn't say anything
and I was like, "Men. "

156
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,303
So then the next day I tried
to compliment you on your hair,

157
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,013
you know,
giving you a little hint here but...

158
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,641
No, absolutely. I totally remember that.
Anyways, it looks great.

159
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,276
Can I help you?

160
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,741
No, no, we're just looking for our dog.

161
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,078
I don't suppose you've seen him,
have you?

162
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,121
No.

163
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,332
Friday? That's a funny name.

164
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,128
I bet when you find him, you'll say,
"Thank God it's Friday. "

165
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,050
Right? It's a joke. So...

166
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,678
I don't think
I've ever seen you around here before.

167
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,891
- Do you go to Thomas Jefferson?
- I will actually, in the fall. Andi.

168
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,267
Dave.

169
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,853
My family just moved here
a couple of months ago.

170
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,606
That's cool. How do you like it so far?

171
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,817
What's not to like?

172
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,864
- We have to go.
- No problem.

173
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,370
You know, if he doesn't show up soon,
you might want to check the pound.

174
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,573
- Friday! Friday! There he is!
- There he is.

175
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,283
- There he is.
- There he is! Friday! Friday!

176
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,702
- Your dog?
- Yeah, that's our dog!

177
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,800
Yeah, he just got in.

178
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,761
Yeah, I know, we just saw him.

179
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,724
Well, I'm always glad
when these things have a happy ending.

180
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,351
We're open till 6:00. Get your parents,
come back, we'll figure it out.

181
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,936
Wait! Wait...

182
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,106
Come on, we're already here.
It's our dog.

183
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,944
Yeah, well, there's a lot of paperwork.
Grown-up paperwork.

184
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,864
There's always a guy
who screws up the paperwork.

185
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,617
But you see this guy? I'm not that guy.

186
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,988
We can't let him out alone anymore.

187
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,158
I mean, if he gets picked up again,
we might not get him back.

188
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,954
And things are gonna get
so much harder when school starts.

189
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,375
Look, Bruce, I think we need
to find Friday a new home.

190
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,544
- Well, you know, I've got a few ideas.
- No.

191
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,838
We've been hiding him
in alleys and garages,

192
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,424
in the woods for three years.

193
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:06,389
Don't you think he deserves
a real home with a real family?

194
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,850
But we are a real family.

195
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,361
Let's get out of here.

196
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:30,079
- You kids! Hold it right there!
- We can't get in trouble again.

197
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:34,041
- But we didn't do anything wrong.
- You want to tell them that?

198
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,558
Oh, my God.

199
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,032
- Friday! No! Get back here!
- Bruce!

200
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,410
Come on.

201
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,095
- You got anything?
- No.

202
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,557
Forget it.

203
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,231
Let's just find Friday
and get out of here.

204
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,111
Friday!

205
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,658
Circuits are fried.

206
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,702
Friday!

207
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,626
Bruce, stay close.

208
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,256
Wow. Andi, look at all this stuff.

209
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,186
Careful.

210
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,814
Friday?

211
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,411
Friday, where are you, boy?

212
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,919
- What's that?
- It's just an old hotel.

213
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,506
Hotels don't make footsteps.

214
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,844
People make footsteps when they walk
through hotels with their feet.

215
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,225
Good point. Come on!

216
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,355
Go, go, go!

217
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,887
Friday, stay back.

218
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,200
Do you think they belong to anyone?

219
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,410
If they did, would they be here?

220
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,704
Better here than the pound.

221
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,247
Friday! Wait!

222
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,770
- Look at that.
- Okay.

223
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,121
What about just, you know,
leaving Friday with them tonight?

224
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,548
One night.

225
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,142
Good night, guys. Sleep tight.

226
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,297
So I mean it's supposed to be
a teacher appreciation lunch, right?

227
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,299
But then it ends up
being more work for us

228
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,426
if we have to set it up
and then clean it up.

229
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,552
I mean, sometimes, you know,

230
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,180
I could appreciate
a little less appreciation, you know?

231
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,018
Don't nod and "Mmm-hmm" me.
I taught you the nod and "Mmm-hmm. "

232
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,687
Yeah, that's true,
but I'd like to think I've made it my own.

233
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,147
Oh, really?

234
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,070
- What's wrong?
- It's these kids, the other night.

235
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,532
- Andi and Bruce?
- Yeah.

236
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,076
- Are they okay?
- I don't know.

237
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,246
I mean, it's bad enough
they lost their parents.

238
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,332
If they can't work this situation out,

239
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,042
I don't know if we're gonna be able
to find a family

240
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,419
that's gonna take the both of them.

241
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,546
You do everything you can for them,
you know.

242
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,175
You can't bring home
your work and let it make you crazy.

243
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,094
- You're right.
- Yeah.

244
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,513
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

245
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,018
It's too bad.
You know, they really are good kids.

246
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,236
It's three hungry dogs.
Grab as much as you can.

247
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,086
That's quite a load there.

248
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,673
Yeah. Just getting some breakfast.

249
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,676
What, are you feeding
the whole neighborhood?

250
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,682
Okay, you wouldn't even touch this
the first time.

251
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,601
I don't eat, you're angry.
I eat, you're angry.

252
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,480
Okay, fine, people, eat.
Lucky for you I saved your dinners.

253
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,525
You can start with those.

254
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,828
Come on.

255
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,302
What is that?

256
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,976
You know, if you would eat
the meals I make,

257
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,019
you wouldn't be so hungry
in the morning.

258
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,731
You're right. Thank you so much, Lois.

259
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,497
Done.

260
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,339
I'm hearing something.

261
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,031
What?

262
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,334
- What's his problem?
- I don't know. Why are you asking me?

263
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,211
Stop howling, please.

264
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,444
Yes, I'd like to call in a complaint
about a howling dog.

265
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,744
That's it?

266
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,747
All that just so
you could look out a window?

267
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,752
Never mind.

268
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,444
Wow. Even Lenny
and Georgia won't touch it.

269
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,699
We need to go get
some real dog food for them.

270
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,617
Wait, who?

271
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,370
Lenny and Georgia.
That's what I named the new dogs.

272
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,705
No. No naming them.

273
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,206
If you name them,
you're gonna get attached.

274
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,168
Andi, look at her.
Tell me she's not a Georgia.

275
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,378
Bruce, I'm not kidding, okay?

276
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,506
I'm glad
that Friday's getting along well with

277
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:29,177
dog number one and dog number two,
but we're barely keeping our dog safe.

278
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,889
I mean, do you know what happens
if we get caught in here?

279
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,474
Trespassing, breaking and entering.

280
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:38,437
You heard what Bernie said.
They'd split us up and ship us off.

281
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,731
Are you even listening?

282
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,129
So I'll stay here and keep them quiet

283
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:08,008
while you go out
and get some real food. Okay?

284
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:13,513
Okay, fine. But just for now.
And I'll be back.

285
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:19,269
Stay, Friday. Stay, Georgia.

286
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,483
You better keep them quiet.

287
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,069
You like to fetch.

288
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:22,958
- Hey. I see you found your dog.
- Yeah. He's fine.

289
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,127
That's great.

290
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,923
- Can I help you find anything?
- No, just getting some dog food.

291
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:34,553
- That's 40 pounds, by the way.
- Yeah, that's probably right.

292
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,848
For that little dog on the flier,
40 pounds?

293
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,517
Well, the thing is, I actually...
I have three dogs,

294
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,269
two of them are strays.

295
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,605
- My parents, they just love animals.
- That's great.

296
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,776
Yeah. You know, they're the best.
I'm really lucky.

297
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:54,114
We have this big yard
and we just rescue dogs all the time.

298
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,202
- All the time?
- Well, yeah, whenever.

299
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,291
You know what? Here, come with me.

300
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,299
- They're so cute.
- Yeah.

301
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,553
We adopt out dogs here,

302
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,514
but we can't get anybody
to take these guys.

303
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,852
They're not puppies anymore,
and everybody always wants puppies.

304
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,978
Tell me about it.

305
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,315
They're also kind of...
Well, they're loveably defective.

306
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,902
Cooper, he's my favorite.
I think he's actually half goat.

307
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,987
There's not a substance on Earth
he can't chew through.

308
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,617
He's been through pocketbooks,
cell phones, shoes, handbags,

309
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,328
even ate through a license plate once.

310
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,872
This is Shep.

311
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,418
Yeah, she's got some herding issues.

312
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,382
- Pushy.
- I like pushy.

313
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,011
So, they've got quirks.
I mean, they're still adorable.

314
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,640
Good, I'm glad you think so,
because you're taking them.

315
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,433
What? No.

316
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,856
The owner says
we can't keep them forever

317
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,194
and if I can't find a place to put them,
then they're going to the pound.

318
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,071
Look, I'm sorry,
but there's no way that I can just...

319
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,825
You're already taking care
of a few strays, what's three more?

320
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,911
- Three?
- Oh, yeah. You're gonna love this guy.

321
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,248
Romeo. Romeo. Romeo.

322
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,043
Whoa.

323
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,923
What if you just took them
for a little while?

324
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,051
Until I can figure something out.
I'll pay for food.

325
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,471
I get an employee discount.
It's the least I can do.

326
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,988
Georgia, I'm sorry, but I can't stand here
all day playing fetch with you.

327
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,656
Georgia, zip it.

328
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,742
No.

329
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,499
Guys, come on! Please! Oh, no!

330
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:13,295
What's it gonna take for me
to get you guys to...

331
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,516
Sweet ride.

332
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,604
Yeah, it's pretty much a chick magnet.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

333
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:36,067
Getting close. Right there. That's it.

334
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,197
This is where you live?

335
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,241
Actually, my parents are out of town,

336
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,244
so I kind of had to make
other arrangements.

337
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,169
This place looks condemned.
What are we doing here?

338
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,338
It's where we keep the dogs.

339
00:36:56,422 --> 00:37:00,467
- Well, are you allowed to be in there?
- No, so let's move it.

340
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,433
All right, guys, watch this.

341
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,894
Ready?

342
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,068
Are you sure it's safe in here?

343
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:22,322
Yeah. We've been poking around here
for a couple of days, actually.

344
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,246
Okay, that hurt.

345
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,301
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

346
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:49,099
Bruce, you remember Dave, right?
Dave from the pet store.

347
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,852
Hi, Dave.

348
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,189
He just needed a place
to keep a couple of dogs

349
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,359
and I thought, you know,
"Hey, we have a place. "

350
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,028
So you made this?

351
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,948
Yeah. It's a work in progress.

352
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,036
And how did you learn
how to make that?

353
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,997
My dad.

354
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,418
Wouldn't it be easier
just to throw it, though?

355
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,629
Yeah, but that's not really the point.
The point is when I get it working,

356
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:23,174
she should be able to play fetch
even when we're not here.

357
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,221
Can you give me free pay-per-view?

358
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,224
Oh, poop!

359
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,229
Literally!

360
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,275
What is going on here?
I mean, who poops on the floor?

361
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,905
- Sorry. I need to work on that.
- How did you find us?

362
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,950
I followed the van
with the ears and the tail.

363
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,662
You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

364
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,751
Why would I tell?
I'm gonna help you guys.

365
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,919
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,505
I love dogs, and there's a lot more
to taking care of them

367
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,258
than throwing a stick and feeding them.

368
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,968
You guys need me.

369
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,935
I say she's in.

370
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,439
Okay. I mean,
how much trouble can they be?

371
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,702
Come on, guys.

372
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,627
Do you really think we can do this,
like, every day?

373
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,463
Yeah, why not? This is a piece of cake.

374
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,479
- Guys, come back! Come back!
- Guys, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

375
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,439
Treat! Who wants a treat?

376
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,316
Friday, no! Where is Romeo?

377
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,152
Okay, Heather, you go that way,
I'll go this way.

378
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,531
Aren't we supposed
to be wearing them out?

379
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,491
This is totally normal.

380
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,749
- Oh, so you think this is funny?
- No, no, not at all.

381
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:24,421
Actually, I was just about to thank you
for reminding me to watch where I...

382
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,798
...step.

383
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,446
You know, I think we might
be in a little over our heads.

384
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,823
It's 4-6, we're outdogged.

385
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,248
Guys, it's really not that bad.

386
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,751
I mean, if you look at it,
dogs have three basic needs.

387
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:07,547
That's eating, sleeping
and then peeing and pooping.

388
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,551
- That's four.
- No, I think peeing and pooping's one.

389
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,888
I've stepped in both,
and I'd have to disagree.

390
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,478
Look, guys, I'm serious.
I really think I can make this work.

391
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,062
How?

392
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,108
What do you think?

393
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,790
Thanks.

394
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,019
No, no, no, no. No.

395
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,539
Ready?

396
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,751
That's disgusting.

397
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,962
That has to be the grossest thing
I've ever seen.

398
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,923
That's awesome.

399
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:44,263
We just wandered in here.
I'm not really sure what that thing was.

400
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,313
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

401
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,858
In fact, if you let me,
I'd love to help you guys.

402
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:00,238
I just work down the street, you know,
I could keep an eye on the fuzz,

403
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,492
could run interference,
massage your shoulders.

404
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,286
- Okay, easy there, tiger.
- Yeah.

405
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,748
Thanks for the offer,
but I think we got it under control.

406
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,000
Could I have a word with you?

407
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,050
All right. I've got to be honest.

408
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,595
I'm at a critical point
in my social development

409
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,890
and those are two fine-looking,
hot women you have behind you,

410
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,852
and let's face it,
you can't date them both.

411
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,564
So, who do you have dibs on?

412
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,860
Dibs? I don't have dibs, per se.

413
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,653
Gotcha.

414
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,325
Name's Mark.

415
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,163
Hi, Mark. You're on poop duty.

416
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:54,834
Okay. So, how many dogs
are we talking here?

417
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,502
- Just six.
- Seven.

418
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,924
What is that?

419
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,096
Actually, this is the newest member
of our family.

420
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,514
This is Henry.

421
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,350
The poor guy was scrounging for food
in the junkyard.

422
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,227
- Bruce, that...
- Andi.

423
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,855
Honestly, we have enough room.
We could take one more.

424
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,775
One more? We can fit, like, 10 more.
Think about that.

425
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,359
Oh, yeah,
why don't we just wander the streets

426
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,653
and rescue every stray we see?

427
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,451
That was funny.

428
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,207
Dispatch to 22. We have a stray
on Saint Andrews and Sixth.

429
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,250
Saint Andrews and Sixth.

430
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,006
Okay, guys, we've got a stray
on Saint Andrews and Sixth.

431
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,383
That's Saint Andrews and Sixth.

432
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,137
It's right near the pound, so hurry.

433
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,900
Hello? Hi. Sorry to bother you.

434
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,819
We were wondering
if we could have a minute of your time.

435
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,112
- Not interested.
- We work for the school newspaper

436
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,156
and we would love an interview.

437
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,991
All right. You know what?
I don't have time for this.

438
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,536
You guys just get out of here.
Skedaddle and play somewhere else.

439
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,703
Okay.

440
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,416
What's the matter?

441
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,336
Never seen a husky kid
in a hoodie before?

442
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:25,091
All right, guys,
get over to the old railroad depot ASAP.

443
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,386
Over there. That's them.

444
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:35,101
- He's stuck.
- Is she hurt?

445
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,358
That's so sweet. They stayed together.
You okay?

446
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,610
You're safe now.
We're gonna take care of you guys.

447
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,112
Give me paw.

448
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,617
There's that white one again.

449
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,828
Let's get him.

450
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,540
Here, doggy. Here, doggy.

451
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,962
All right, come on, guys.
You're being rescued.

452
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,340
Here, dog.
Hey, come back here, you mangy mutt.

453
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,175
Hey! Come back here.

454
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:14,432
All right, come on! Come on, everybody.

455
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,101
Come on. Come on. Come on.

456
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,397
- Head to tail. Head to tail. Come on.
- Come on. Get across, guys.

457
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,857
Go, go, go!

458
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,987
Come on, trust it.
You can do it. Come on. Come on.

459
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,326
Good boy.

460
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,368
Passengers loaded.

461
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,495
- Heading back to base.
- Copy that.

462
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,662
- One, two, three, go!
- Okay. Okay. Go!

463
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,747
- Wait!
- Oh, what's that?

464
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,874
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

465
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,585
- Thumb war.
- Thumb war? Any calls?

466
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,254
Nothing.

467
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,178
Where are all the dogs?

468
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:01,247
Thank you for riding the simulator.
Please exit for the next customer.

469
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,583
Out!

470
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,712
Next.

471
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:15,886
And please keep your paws
inside the vehicle at all times.

472
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,994
Come on. Come on. Come on.

473
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,331
There's gotta be something
you like to do.

474
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,188
Go get her. Go get her.

475
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,267
I'll get it.

476
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,273
- Bernie.
- Oh, hey, Bernie.

477
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,108
Excellent. Bernie.

478
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,819
Carl, Lois, I'm gonna borrow the kids
for a second, is that okay?

479
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,323
I don't know if you heard, but Lois and I
got a gig this weekend. Paid.

480
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,908
Wow. Really?

481
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,077
I'm gonna RSVP you and the missus
as a yes, right?

482
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,289
I'm not sure that I'm actually gonna
be able to make it.

483
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,541
What about that friend of yours
that owns the club?

484
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,834
Oh, yeah, he's definitely gonna be there.

485
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,586
Yeah? Excellent.

486
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,632
- I told you.
- Yeah.

487
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,510
- So what is this emergency?
- Who cares? At least we're out of there.

488
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,137
They were about to start band practice.

489
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,597
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Jason.

490
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,018
Hey, guys, I think I may have found
the perfect foster parents for you.

491
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,812
- Perfect?
- They're perfect.

492
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,023
They had two foster kids
that just went off to college

493
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,358
and they're looking for two more,

494
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,944
and I think
you guys are really gonna love them.

495
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:04,114
So that's it, no more Carl and Lois.
You guys get packed, you're out of here.

496
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,658
Thank you, Bernie. Thank you.

497
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,868
Best part about it is
it's only three hours away.

498
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,662
You guys are free.

499
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,291
- What?
- That far?

500
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,338
Yes. What's the problem?

501
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:25,552
- Well, we really like the area.
- We've made a lot of great friends.

502
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:30,140
Yeah, and you know, Carl and Lois'
singing really grows on you.

503
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,102
You hate Carl and Lois.

504
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,814
Guys, what's going on?

505
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,234
I mean, they want to make you
a part of their family.

506
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,612
Look, we appreciate
everything you've done, but...

507
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,201
Guys, you're not gonna get
another chance like this.

508
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,537
I really think you should go.

509
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,874
We'd like to stay.

510
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:03,590
Well, I...
I have no idea what you guys are doing.

511
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,970
We're really sorry.

512
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,119
We're doing the right thing,
aren't we, Friday?

513
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,711
Hey. What's up, puppy.

514
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,174
Is everything okay?

515
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:48,635
Yeah, yeah, just... Just looking.

516
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,221
- You come up here a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

517
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,516
I'm just guessing this is the kind of view
I wouldn't be able to afford

518
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,935
if this place were a real hotel.

519
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:02,775
So, what are you doing tomorrow night?

520
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:08,405
Sneaking out,
serving 60 pounds of kibble,

521
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,741
maybe mopping up some drool.

522
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,702
'Cause a friend of mine
is having this party?

523
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,623
And you could come and meet some
people you'll be going to school with.

524
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,376
The keyword here really being "people. "

525
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,921
Good point.

526
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,925
Great. So, where should I pick you up?

527
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:33,555
Why don't you just tell me where it is?
I can meet you there.

528
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,973
All right.

529
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,402
That's dinner.

530
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,227
- Hey, guys.
- You guys ready for dinner?

531
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,731
Are you hungry, buddy?

532
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,530
Smells great.

533
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,366
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

534
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,203
Thanks.

535
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,822
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

536
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:17,910
So, Heather,
it's kind of like a dinner date, isn't it?

537
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,422
To us. To a real family.

538
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,092
- To us.
- To us.

539
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,761
- Cheers!
- To us.

540
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,221
Let's eat.

541
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,613
If cartoon birds and mice were ever
going to make me a dress for the ball,

542
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,657
now would be a good time.

543
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:05,499
- How long are you gonna be gone?
- A few hours, maybe. It's just a party?

544
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,878
What if anything goes wrong?

545
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,005
Bruce, you can handle it.
You can handle anything.

546
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,675
I mean, have you stopped
and looked around the hotel?

547
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,009
I could disappear for a week

548
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,178
and you'd be able
to keep everything running.

549
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,640
Yeah, but you're not gonna
disappear for a week, right?

550
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,100
Of course not.

551
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:26,562
Now, if you could just build me a dress,
then you'd be a real wizard.

552
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,855
You should check out room 502.

553
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:26,496
You look... Wow, you...
You look gorgeous.

554
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,373
What, this old thing?

555
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,252
Here, come on in.
Let me show you around.

556
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,299
No! No, Lois!
That's my personal, that's...

557
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,725
- So what else have you stolen?
- Nothing.

558
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:50,896
- So you admit you did steal it.
- Never said that, Lois.

559
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,065
You might as well tell the truth.

560
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,942
Do you really think
you could outsmart us?

561
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,613
I'd rather not answer that question, Carl.

562
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:05,535
- I love your dress.
- Thanks.

563
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,204
Marianne, this is Andi.

564
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,956
She's gonna be going to school
with us next year.

565
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,042
- Nice to meet you.
- Andi.

566
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,006
- Hey, Jason.
- Hey.

567
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,257
- How you doing?
- All right.

568
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:23,095
- You guys already know each other?
- Yeah, it's Andi, right?

569
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,097
Do I know you from somewhere?

570
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,433
Yeah, you live in my grandmother's
building with the Scudders.

571
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:32,145
No, I'm over on Oak.
I have one of those faces, though.

572
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,606
No, you live with the Scudders.

573
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,275
Come on, help me out here,
I'm not crazy.

574
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:41,613
They're your foster parents,
you and your little brother... Barry.

575
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,033
- Bruce?
- Bruce, Bruce, Bruce. That's it, Bruce.

576
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,704
Andi, what is he talking about?

577
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,916
Oh, my God, you guys, it's no big deal.

578
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:56,378
So I guess the Scudders have been
foster parents before, big deal.

579
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,296
They're also our aunt and uncle.

580
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:02,300
We're just staying with them
while our parents are traveling in China,

581
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,886
and we just call them our parents
because it is easier

582
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,390
than talking about
this whole long boring story, okay?

583
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,518
I'm thirsty, anyone else?

584
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,479
Anyone?

585
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,904
Andi, I...

586
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,867
Andi!

587
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,741
- Did you get a hold of Bernie yet?
- I'm on hold!

588
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,911
Well, tell them it's an emergency.
Tell them I'm being stolen from.

589
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,914
Tell who? I'm on hold!

590
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,919
Don't think this means that...

591
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,006
You let him get away!

592
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,323
Friday?

593
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,092
- Hurry up!
- I'm wearing heels!

594
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,677
Well, so am I!

595
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:39,684
- I can't believe they own a hotel.
- Oh, God, Carl, you're such an idiot!

596
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,861
Stay close to me, baby.

597
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:55,951
What was that?

598
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,332
Don't answer it.

599
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:13,343
Hey, that's my wah-wah pedal.
No wonder my sound's been off.

600
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,053
Yeah, that's why.

601
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,389
This crap is amazing.

602
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:21,017
Yeah, 'cause it's our crap.
They've been robbing us blind.

603
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:27,357
Good girl. Drop it! Georgia, drop it!

604
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,734
- Bruce, Bruce!
- Let go. Georgia, let go of it!

605
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,778
- Drop it, please!
- Bruce!

606
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,156
What happened?

607
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,450
Don't ask.

608
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,829
What happened with you?

609
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,301
Oh, no!

610
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:09,774
- Let's get out of here. Where's the exit?
- Like I left bread crumbs.

611
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,235
Quick, guys, go, go!

612
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:19,743
- Put the lights back on!
- I didn't do it!

613
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:25,915
What is that?

614
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,422
- I don't know. Let's get out of here!
- Oh, God! Shut it!

615
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,146
Are you sure they said
it was coming from here?

616
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,606
Don't know.

617
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,193
Let's check upstairs.

618
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:59,074
- Did you hear the cops?
- I don't know.

619
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:00,950
Oh, good.

620
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:04,204
Well, if those were cops,

621
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:07,665
we're gonna turn them in ourselves,
'cause I smell reward.

622
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,418
I don't think that's reward you smell.

623
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,221
Where are we?

624
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,015
We're in deep doo-doo.

625
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:36,027
Okay. Stop breathing like that.

626
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,705
No. No.

627
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,460
- No.
- Don't.

628
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,237
Get them in there.

629
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:34,252
No! What are you doing? Friday!
You can't do this! No! Friday!

630
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,962
- Bruce!
- Friday!

631
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:41,092
Friday! Let go of me! That's my dog!

632
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,760
Bruce! Just go!

633
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,803
It's okay.

634
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:31,476
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

635
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,983
- We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we?
- Yeah.

636
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,989
But Bernie's doing
everything he can to help. Okay?

637
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,826
Look, is there any way
that they could just stay with you

638
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,329
for a little while longer
until I can find a family that'll take them?

639
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:55,792
Not a chance. God knows
how much they've stolen from us.

640
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:59,921
We have a lot of very rare
and valuable items in our home, okay?

641
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,840
And we are gonna go
and do a full inventory

642
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:06,678
and we're letting you know, all right?
This is an outrage. An outrage!

643
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,515
I'm suing you. I'm suing those kids.
I'm suing the state.

644
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,892
I'm suing the guy
that invented shrink wrap.

645
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,686
I'm suing everyone!

646
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:23,361
So you're gonna send us
to that other house now, right?

647
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,071
That nice couple?

648
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:29,033
- Bruce...
- Bruce, we're gonna be fine.

649
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,536
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

650
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:37,208
Come on, Bernie.
You have to help us, please.

651
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,836
Bruce needs me.
He's gonna get chewed up out there.

652
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:43,214
Andi, I'm sorry, okay?
There's nothing I can do about it.

653
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,799
You can't separate us, okay?

654
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:47,927
Don't punish him
just because I screwed things up.

655
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,430
Listen, the best thing you can do
for Bruce right now

656
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,724
is let him have a fresh start.

657
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:55,226
I'm sorry.

658
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:59,063
Can't I just say one thing to my sister?

659
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:16,372
Look, Andi, don't worry about me, okay?
I'm gonna be fine.

660
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:20,668
I was supposed to keep us together.
I was supposed to protect us.

661
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,129
Andi, we had to protect the dogs.

662
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:28,051
If I had to do it over again,
I'd do the exact same thing.

663
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,360
First come, first served!

664
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:48,339
- Tomorrow morning for all of them.
- Yep.

665
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:00,101
- We're gonna be busy.
- I can use the overtime.

666
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,430
And which one are you?

667
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:23,309
They must have left you behind.
You're the lucky one.

668
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,061
Come here, buddy.

669
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:29,292
I know how to sit,
how to fetch and how to roll over.

670
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:34,589
What I don't know
is how I ended up in here.

671
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,259
Could you please turn that off?

672
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,391
- Please.
- I did turn it off.

673
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,794
Hey!

674
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:41,197
- You busy?
- Friday!

675
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,453
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

676
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:48,621
So what's the plan?

677
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:51,999
The dogs have less than a day left.
We've got to get them out of there now.

678
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,377
Okay, that's really
more a goal than a plan.

679
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:56,337
There's a no-kill shelter outside the city,

680
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:58,547
so if we can get them out of the pound
and over the county line,

681
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,257
then they're home free.

682
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,134
- Right.
- But we gotta move quick.

683
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,303
Andi, what happens to us?

684
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:07,390
It's...

685
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:11,185
Look, Bruce, it's not gonna be good.

686
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:14,772
We're gonna be in more trouble
than we've ever been in.

687
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:20,027
But we're gonna save the dogs.

688
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,738
It's what we're supposed to do, right?

689
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:24,949
Okay, guys.

690
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:30,413
Okay, so here's the pound,
and this is the county line,

691
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:31,997
and this is what we're gonna do.

692
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:40,798
Are we ready?

693
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:44,427
Let's do this!

694
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,971
Got sausage.

695
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:51,809
Fire! Fire! Fire! Hello?

696
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:54,061
When a young girl is screaming for help
and yelling, "Fire,"

697
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,646
- you're supposed to get moving!
- I have water.

698
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,065
Fire! Hello?

699
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:01,652
- Where?
- And they say chivalry is dead.

700
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,612
It's right over there.

701
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,659
Hey!

702
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,956
A bunch of kids eager to adopt, I bet.

703
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,584
- Where are the keys?
- There!

704
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:21,714
You didn't think we'd forget you,
did you?

705
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:23,924
Come on! Let's go. Come on.

706
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,970
I missed you guys, too.
Come on. Let's go! Come on!

707
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,015
Let's go, Shep! Come on, let's go!

708
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:35,394
- Let's go for a run, you guys, come on!
- Go, go, go!

709
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,112
Checking out.

710
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:46,614
We're gonna get you guys out of here.
Come on.

711
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,699
Hurry up, Thor, gotta go!

712
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,205
Let's go, let's go!

713
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,583
Way to go, Shep! Good girl.

714
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,878
Okay, the coast is clear.
Bring her on back.

715
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:06,133
What's going on here?

716
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:09,094
I know you. All right, let's go.
You're going to jail.

717
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,513
Trouble! Trouble!

718
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:14,725
We can do this hard or we can do it
easy. Let's go, missy. Come on.

719
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:17,478
Keep your paws off of her.

720
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:23,818
Heather, save yourself!
Save yourself! Go! I have him!

721
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,700
Nobody's going anywhere.

722
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,413
Get back in there.

723
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,172
Keys.

724
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,263
Hey!

725
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:04,525
Okay, Friday,
you're gonna lead the pack.

726
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,528
- Mark!
- Yes?

727
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:09,572
Thank you!

728
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:12,950
Come on, Friday. A little faster, buddy!
You can do it!

729
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:16,120
Follow the sausage, Friday.
Follow the sausage!

730
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:22,334
- Well, that went well.
- Yeah, well, we're not done yet.

731
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,554
Come on, Friday, lead your pack!
Good boy!

732
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:37,516
Come on, guys, follow the meat!
Come on! That's it, Friday, let's go.

733
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,044
Oh, that's not good.

734
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:32,488
Hey!

735
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:40,537
- You guys, are we there yet?
- We're almost there, just up ahead.

736
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:54,551
Wait. What? Oh, no!

737
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:00,933
Friday!

738
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:06,897
Guys, come back! This way!
Problem. They just went the other way.

739
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,107
What?

740
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:15,906
Where are they going?

741
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,286
Home. They're going home.

742
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:07,708
Block the exits.
Make sure they don't get back out.

743
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,168
Let's get some more
Animal Control out here.

744
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:11,295
- How much?
- All of it.

745
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:17,342
We need all available Animal Control
units. All available Animal Control units.

746
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:38,322
It is pure bedlam down here

747
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:40,532
as authorities try
to take control of the situation.

748
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:43,035
This scheme was supposedly
the work of several juvenile delinquents.

749
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,913
Upstairs, right now, let's go!

750
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:49,500
There's no need to get upset, Officer.
Animal Control is on the scene.

751
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:51,418
All right, everybody,
if you can just let us do ourjob,

752
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,337
we'll have all these
dangerous canines rounded up

753
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,881
and out of your hair presently.

754
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:57,216
- Stop!
- Can I get through here?

755
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,717
- Watch out. Please?
- Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.

756
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,385
Oh, no, no, no, no! Not you again!

757
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,430
- Those dogs belong to us.
- They're family.

758
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,516
Yeah, we're not gonna let you
coverall-wearing goons

759
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:08,185
take them away from us.
And you can put that in your report.

760
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:11,313
Officer, would you please arrest
these young felons right now

761
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:14,191
- so we can get back to work?
- Fine! Just leave the dogs alone!

762
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:16,527
Andi! There he is!

763
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,278
That's our dog!
You can't just take him away!

764
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:22,074
- Oh, what do we got here? A puppy!
- Just leave my dog alone!

765
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,202
Stop!

766
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,044
- Okay. Now, who are you?
- I'm Bernie Wilkins.

767
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:41,009
Social Services.

768
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:44,054
Okay, get them out of here!

769
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:47,975
Come on, listen.
Can you just hear me out

770
01:25:48,059 --> 01:25:52,479
before you throw these kids in jail
and destroy all these innocent dogs?

771
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:59,820
I see no reason
why we can't hear both sides.

772
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:05,075
Look. I'm responsible for these kids,
and I know what they did was wrong.

773
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:10,706
But I gotta tell you,
I wish I had the guts to do what they did.

774
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:17,045
I've been trying to place kids
in good homes for 15 years

775
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,423
and most of the time,
I'm not successful.

776
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:22,301
But these kids,
they didn't make excuses.

777
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,720
They didn't get frustrated
with the system and give up.

778
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:28,098
They just went out and did it.
They saved everybody.

779
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,146
They created their own little family.

780
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:38,233
You call this a family? A bunch
of mangy strays in an old hotel?

781
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,826
"Madison. "

782
01:26:52,582 --> 01:27:01,465
Madison.

783
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:04,927
"August 3rd,

784
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:09,681
"found hiding in a backyard after the
family moved away and left her behind. "

785
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,393
Viola and Sebastian, the twins.

786
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,231
"Together since they were puppies.

787
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:19,024
"Viola got snagged on a fence,

788
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:22,361
"but Sebastian refused
to leave his sister behind. "

789
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:24,196
"Chelsea.

790
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:28,450
"Chelsea lost her leg in an accident.

791
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:32,037
"The owner didn't pay the bill
and abandoned her at the vet. "

792
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:35,791
"Coco, Rocky and Harley.

793
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:42,214
"Found living together
in the woods near a dump. "

794
01:27:42,298 --> 01:27:44,091
And there's many more.

795
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:45,342
"Ginger.

796
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:49,137
"Henry, Romeo, Juliet.

797
01:27:50,556 --> 01:27:51,848
"Cooper.

798
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:55,519
"Shep.

799
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,898
"George"? Does that say "George"?

800
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:03,568
Georgia! Her name's Georgia.

801
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:05,362
And Lenny.

802
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:11,535
Georgia and Lenny.

803
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:17,040
They're the first two residents
in this hotel.

804
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:18,834
The Hotel for Dogs.

805
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,505
No one was turned away
when they needed a home.

806
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:28,218
Nobody was abandoned
when they were looking for a family.

807
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:32,472
Are you really gonna tell me that
we're gonna just abandon them now?

808
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:47,070
They don't look like
mangy strays, Officer.

809
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:49,573
But you don't mind
if we take a look upstairs, do you?

810
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:52,576
I think it's in the public's best interest.

811
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:56,580
Be my guest.

812
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:30,322
- You did great.
- You don't think I was too pushy?

813
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,699
I like pushy.

814
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:46,963
- Mark?
- Heather.

815
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:51,510
So, is this when the hero gets the girl?

816
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:55,097
Baby steps.

817
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:00,644
Do you mind if I...

818
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:05,357
No. Okay, sorry.

819
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,405
You kids are heroes.
You should be proud.

820
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:12,572
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

821
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:14,783
Yeah, but the bad news is, in all this,

822
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:19,413
I still haven't been able to find a foster
family that's willing to take you guys.

823
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,915
That's okay, Bernie,
we know you tried your best.

824
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:23,834
But the good news is,

825
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:27,796
I have found some real parents
that might be willing to adopt.

826
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,925
- Adopt?
- Yeah.

827
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,343
See, the mom is excellent.

828
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:35,720
She's a teacher,
so she's really great with kids.

829
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:38,432
And he cannot cook to save his life.

830
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:43,812
And he shouts during football games
like the players can actually hear him.

831
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,856
But he has a great heart.

832
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:50,569
Wait a minute.

833
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:53,947
Do they like dogs?

834
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:56,867
We love dogs.

835
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:23,393
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

836
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,521
I'd like to welcome you
to the Hotel for Dogs.

837
01:31:29,942 --> 01:31:32,736
Thanks to the generosity
of the entire city,

838
01:31:32,778 --> 01:31:36,573
we are now able to take care
of all your canine needs.

839
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:38,366
Thank you, Georgia.

840
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:42,787
Room 320 is now available.

841
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:49,920
