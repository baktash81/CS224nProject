1
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,695
Long before the myths began,

2
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,160
it was primitive, unforgiving.

3
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,749
But in that vast, limitless space,

4
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,869
man had one ally.

5
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:12,757
The horse.

6
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
What's wrong?

7
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:02,522
Henry?

8
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,536
Henry?

9
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,126
Answer me, are you spooked or somethin'?

10
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,878
I've been spooked ever since
I left my mother's tit.

11
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,460
That's what keeps me from dying.

12
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,267
Well, if there's nothing
there but your spooks,

13
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,517
what say we move on?

14
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,081
Whoa, ho, whoa!

15
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,511
If I were you, I'd make
this my first and last job.

16
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,718
Head back east and get myself
behind a store counter.

17
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,708
If I were you, I'd turn
around and head upstream,

18
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,844
and save the advice.

19
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,355
No wonder you got kicked out of the army.

20
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,643
I didn't get kicked out
of the army, I walked out.

21
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,062
And I scattered a few
teeth along the way, too.

22
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,010
Any sign of him?

23
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,010
Not a fart in the wind.

24
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,155
Why are you doin' that?

25
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,459
Scavengers.

26
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,670
That's why.

27
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,588
Wolves of one kind or another.

28
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,334
Just lookin' for the trail
of someone on their own.

29
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,434
God damn Indian.

30
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,188
We could hunt and trap for six months,

31
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,690
and not get the pelts he
could trade in one day.

32
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,144
What difference does it make,
we're in no hurry, are we?

33
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,448
I am.

34
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,815
I'll feel a lot safer the
sooner I get back to the post.

35
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,536
I thought you traded
regular with the comanche?

36
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,523
Yeah, I walk through
rattlesnake country, too.

37
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,783
I'm just careful how I do it.

38
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,668
Where did you learn to handle hide?

39
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,049
You'd be surprised at
the things I know, Henry.

40
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,137
I've been a shoemaker, a cook,

41
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,594
worked for a slave trader once.

42
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,432
I even played in a
minstrel show a few times.

43
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,855
All that before you kicked out of the army?

44
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,208
Maybe your heathen friend
got sick or somethin'.

45
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,869
That wouldn't stop him riding.

46
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,381
Killed, then.

47
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,907
He's got a god damn horse
like an eagle's wing.

48
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,417
No ordinary man is gonna stop him.

49
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,182
Well, as long as we're
not having any guest,

50
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,059
what say we have a drink on our own?

51
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,415
This territory's littered with the bones

52
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,104
of the likes of you.

53
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,986
Oh, you mean young and handsome?

54
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,139
I mean people who began
drinking early in the morning

55
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,945
back east because they couldn't take it.

56
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,158
Then they came out here because
they thought it'd be easier.

57
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,337
I don't know what you're
talking about, Hank.

58
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,312
That's enough, that's
for trading, put it down.

59
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,499
I'll tell you something about me, friend.

60
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,629
I don't like anybody telling me what to do.

61
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,045
Your recklessness and
bragging could get me killed.

62
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,418
You signed on to do a job, now you do it!

63
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,881
You gonna have me flogged?

64
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,057
Cheers, friend.

65
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,563
Now, listen to me.

66
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,579
I'm not interested in winning a fight here.

67
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,761
I'm not interested in winning a fight.

68
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,193
I'd like to win a friend,
a man I can work with.

69
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,492
A man that I can trust.

70
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,477
What the hell are you
always so damn nervous about?

71
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,497
You!

72
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,417
You really are scared, aren't ya?

73
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Why?

74
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,071
Your life out here won't depend on how many

75
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,173
teeth you knocked out in the army,

76
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,800
but on how fast you can use your brains.

77
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,054
I'm here to get a job done
and drinking won't help.

78
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,182
We can work together, if
you're just here to fight,

79
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,477
then you might as well have
stayed in the calvary.

80
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,230
Are you interested?

81
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,270
I'm offering you my hand, not my fist.

82
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,657
No one ever shook my hand before.

83
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,619
After a fight, I mean.

84
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:30,348
Just what the hell are you
running from, pike, huh?

85
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,602
Nothin'.

86
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,439
I just wanna be my own man my own way.

87
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,386
You can't be your own man
when you're always polishing

88
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,441
someone else's boots.

89
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,275
So you wanna live out here,

90
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,069
and huntin' pelts, tradin'
with the Indians?

91
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,083
Why not?

92
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,126
I'll try anything once.

93
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,230
How long have you been with the company?

94
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,089
About four years now.

95
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,427
What are you runnin' from?

96
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,257
I'm not runnin' from anything.

97
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,845
I came out here to make money.

98
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,311
There was a big demand for furs
back east, there still is,

99
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,767
there always will be.

100
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,030
Coyote.

101
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:30,697
Sounds like coyote.

102
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,442
Well, I said it sounds like coyote.

103
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,184
I was never in the calvary.

104
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,237
I was just a regular foot soldier.

105
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,942
I stole the segment.

106
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,450
See you in the mornin', pike.

107
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,010
Got it!

108
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,305
There we go.

109
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,028
God damn it!

110
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,158
J alas, we have dried beans again j

111
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,996
j we got red beans, black beans,
Lima beans, human beings j

112
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,253
j beans, beans, beans

113
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,600
Pike!

114
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,895
What? - Indians!

115
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,232
Where?

116
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,526
Where are they, Henry?

117
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,059
Get across the river!

118
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,944
Wait for me!

119
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,184
Stand and fight, bastards!

120
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,602
Thieving, cowardly bastards!

121
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,243
Bastards!

122
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,920
Far away, the night is falling.

123
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,462
And the twilight home light's calling.

124
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,674
And from open door and window,

125
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,222
they will greet me as I come.

126
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,805
All the years have turned to hours.

127
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,350
All the tears to wayside flowers.

128
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:57,606
I'm one of those who wander down
the village street at home.

129
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,278
Au revoir, Henry.

130
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,258
My god.

131
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,617
Just take it easy, please.

132
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,912
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.

133
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:05,042
I'm just as scared as you
are, I promise you.

134
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,338
And, uh, I'm really sorry to interfere.

135
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,550
I got nothing against your
religion, but I'm sure

136
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,804
that old fella's spirit can
travel just as well without

137
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,998
this fine horse, I'm gonna
take him off your hands, okay?

138
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,458
I'm not gonna steal him, mind you...

139
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:37,869
No.

140
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,118
Tim? - Ah, yes, lunch.

141
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,421
We must feed the body,

142
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,664
even though the heart
is full to overflowing.

143
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,548
They want their lunch, Judith.

144
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,335
He didn't have to snap his fingers at me.

145
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,673
I'm not a dog.

146
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,339
Then prove it by learning a
few simple words of Spanish.

147
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,275
There.

148
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,436
I know more Spanish than they do english.

149
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,650
Which is not the point, dear sister.

150
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,441
Remember, I owe much to my generous patron.

151
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,280
And you owe much to me.

152
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:09,896
Oh, god.

153
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,305
Why did I ever leave Ireland?

154
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,609
So you could eat.

155
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,873
So you could be your brother's housekeeper.

156
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,319
Serving him who serves god.

157
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,668
What's he saying now?

158
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,372
He was welcoming her to his home.

159
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,836
And if you don't mind your tone,

160
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,339
your own welcome will be short-lived.

161
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,921
Do you expect me to act like her?

162
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,711
She is his brother's widow, it is,

163
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,221
after all, a little awkward for her.

164
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,926
Oh, don't judge, Judith.

165
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,934
Only god knows what is in her heart.

166
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,141
When we were at that hacienda last night,

167
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,808
I think I saw what was in her heart.

168
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,408
How many more hours of this today?

169
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,740
We won't be there till nightfall.

170
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
God.

171
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,089
Judith.

172
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,381
Tell him from me, father,

173
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,135
that if he's ever in Dublin,
I'll buy him a jar.

174
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,849
Hey, oop!

175
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,726
Hey, oop!

176
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,645
Hey!

177
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,778
Don't anger him, Judith, he's a child.

178
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,220
Tim?

179
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,515
Tim!

180
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,143
Tim!

181
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,512
Don't let him take me.

182
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,566
Please.

183
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:40,526
Good boy.

184
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,164
Easy, boy.

185
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,538
Easy, easy, easy.

186
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,832
It's okay.

187
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,287
Good boy.

188
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,587
That's a boy.

189
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,217
That's right.

190
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,215
There you are.

191
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,048
Steady, that's it.

192
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,015
That's it.

193
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,679
Open up.

194
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,391
Come on, babe, open up, one time.

195
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,930
Good boy, hey!

196
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,233
That a boy.

197
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,832
Good boy, good boy!

198
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,135
Good boy!

199
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,146
Good boy!

200
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,317
Well, old friend, your
workin' days are over.

201
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,698
You can eat your way to
Kansas, if you want to.

202
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:37,995
So long.

203
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,423
I'm an eagle now!

204
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,286
Oh, holy Mary, mother of god.

205
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,490
Please help me.

206
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,255
What the hell is wrong with you?

207
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,960
Haven't I got enough problems here?

208
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,643
Aw, to hell with...

209
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,261
Whoa ho!

210
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,392
Whoa ho!

211
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,192
Henry?

212
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,891
The bell, ring the bell!

213
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,056
Bell, the bell?

214
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,455
Wake up!

215
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,379
We were attacked by...

216
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,956
J do ye Ken John peel at the break of day j

217
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,119
j do ye Ken John peel in his coat so gay j

218
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,834
j do ye Ken John peel
when he's far, far away j

219
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,671
j with his hounds and his
horns in the morning

220
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,336
j twas the sounds of his horns
brought me from my bed j

221
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,051
j and the cry of his hounds
which he oft times led

222
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:48,140
j for peel's view holloa
would awaken the dead j

223
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,730
j or a fox from his lair in the morning j

224
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,267
you don't like my singing?

225
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,061
Well, you'll have to get used to it, I did.

226
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,772
Where should it be, my friend?

227
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,781
Mexico, Canada?

228
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,317
No, Canada's too cold.

229
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,362
Hell, we could stay right here.

230
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:10,123
Eat the buffalo and the sweet
grass, drink the cool water.

231
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,582
What say you, my friend, do you care?

232
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,418
I sure as hell don't, I'm my own man now.

233
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,976
I hope it breaks your teeth!

234
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,537
You bastard!

235
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,913
I wonder where your breed is from.

236
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,870
Spain, more than likely, eh?

237
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:45,553
Well, one thing is certain,
my friend, there's not a man

238
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:48,305
in this territory who wouldn't
give his vitals to own you.

239
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,430
How does that make you feel?

240
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,125
Oh my god.

241
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:12,802
I'll be damned.

242
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,930
He's wearing my coat.

243
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,513
He's one of the heathens that killed Henry.

244
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,315
Shoot your little sticks,
my heathen friend!

245
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,276
Shoot "em all, if you want to.

246
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,575
Just keep coming.

247
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,996
Whoa ho!

248
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,510
I'll lead your merry chase, my friend,

249
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:56,926
right down the barrel of my gun.

250
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,562
If you wanna catch me,
you'll have to sprout wings.

251
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,776
Like some kind of bird, eh?

252
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:07,811
Gobble gobble, gobble gobble.

253
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,480
Whoa, oh shit.

254
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,795
Well, nothin' can creep up on us here.

255
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,095
Except the wind.

256
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,809
God damn it!

257
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,515
Easy, boy.

258
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,189
One man took him, and by god,
one man will take him back.

259
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,554
Just leaving a trail like you don't care.

260
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:02,851
Squall, maybe.

261
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:04,971
I hope so.

262
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,886
That ought to slow him down some.

263
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:17,401
God damn heathen.

264
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,409
We're gettin' close, boy.

265
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,789
We've got a chance.

266
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:37,553
More than a chance.

267
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,180
The bastard.

268
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,042
So...

269
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:13,498
We've got us an Indian with a squall,

270
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:15,208
and we've got us a boozy Indian.

271
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,442
What the hell kinda heathen is this?

272
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,096
Well, if he's got a piano with him,

273
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,697
I'll teach him a few minstrel tunes.

274
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:58,011
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

275
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,770
Blessed art thou amongst women,

276
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,978
and blessed be the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

277
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,110
Holy Mary, mother of god.

278
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:11,361
Pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death.

279
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,995
Amen.

280
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,428
Oh, Christ.

281
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,952
I'll be a son of a...

282
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:33,604
You slowed me down some.

283
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:38,101
But you're never gonna stop me,
you heathen son of a bitch.

284
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:40,238
Never.

285
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:11,955
Comanche.

286
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,181
I can catch up by sundown.

287
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:04,476
If I don't bleed to death by then.

288
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:20,498
You stole more than a horse, heathen.

289
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:01,080
And you've been a long way from home.

290
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:03,673
A long, long way.

291
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,758
I'll follow you to Canada if I have to!

292
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:32,521
You're gonna have to kill
me to keep that horse!

293
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:36,354
If I don't kill myself
trying to get it back.

294
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:05,842
Touche.

295
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:08,465
Please.

296
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:11,468
Help me.

297
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:57,050
Help me.

298
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:01,214
Please, help me.
