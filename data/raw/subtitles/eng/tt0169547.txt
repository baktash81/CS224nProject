00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:04,505
- How would it look
if I showed up with no one?
- You always end up ignoring me.

329
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:08,074
Now, listen to me.
This is an important business function.

330
00:30:08,152 --> 00:30:11,349
As you know, my business
is selling an image,

331
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:13,754
and part of my job
is to live that image.

332
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:18,318
Honey, do me a favor and say
whatever you want to say
and spare me the propaganda.

333
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:21,296
All right.
Hi, Shirley!

334
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:25,734
Listen. Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.

335
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:30,604
- [High Voice] I am happy, honey!
- You're not... Oh, that's Buddy!

- Hi.

337
00:30:34,245 --> 00:30:36,713
Good to see you again.

338
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,307
- It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.

339
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,353
Oh, Carolyn! Of course.
How are you?

340
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,356
- Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
- Hello.

341
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,426
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.

342
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:56,626
Oh, we've met before,
actually. This thing last year.
Christmas at the Sheraton.

343
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,998
Oh, yeah!

344
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:02,163
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.

345

Honey, don't be weird.

346
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:11,679
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.

you want me to be.

even tell you this if I weren't

I'm in complete awe of you.

364
00:32:48,078 --> 00:32:50,512
I mean, your firm...

365
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:54,574
is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,

366
00:32:54,652 --> 00:32:58,179
and your personal
sales record is...

367

It's very intimidating.

I'm the competition,

371

I don't flatter myself...

Excuse me?

Well, I guess when
