1
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,753
Do I ignore you? No.
So please don't ignore me.

2
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,831
I have called you twice.

3
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,869
Very expensive.

4
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,996
- Really?
- No.

5
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,236
First lesson, front room,
eight o'clock tonight. Don't be late.

6
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,998
<i># Well, I'm just out of school
I'm real, real cool</i>

7
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,117
<i># I got the jump, got the jive
Got the message I'm alive</i>

8
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,831
Glasses, John!

9
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,718
<i># I'm gonna keep a-shakin'
I'm gonna keep a-moving, baby</i>

10
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,189
<i># Don't you cramp my style
I'm a real wild child</i>

11
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,271
<i># Come on, baby, shake all night long</i>

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,749
<i># Shake until the meat
come off the bone</i>

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,034
<i># Cos I'm a wild one</i>

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,917
<i># Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one</i>

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,595
Hey, Tarbuck. Keep out of the chippie,
you fat bastard.

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,989
- Lennon, you prick!
- He thinks he's hard.

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,718
He couldn't batter a fish!

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,119
Marie, my angel face.

19
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,033
Show us your jugs.

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,917
Cock off, Lennon!

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,472
Or cock out?

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,834
<i># Sugar, now don't be late</i>

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,831
<i># We're gonna move it all night long</i>

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,472
<i># Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one</i>

25
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,954
<i># I'm gonna keep a-shakin'
Gonna keep a-moving baby</i>

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,235
<i># Don't you cramp my style
I'm a real wild child</i>

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,635
You'll be lucky to find a job on the
docks because you're going nowhere.

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,110
Here at Quarry Bank generally...
nowhere.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,710
Is "nowhere" full of geniuses, sir?
Because then I probably do belong there.

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,709
<i># But I'm a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one</i>

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,193
<i># I'm gonna keep a-shakin'
Gonna keep a-moving, baby</i>

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,589
<i># Don't you cramp my style
I'm a real wild child</i>

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,796
<i># I'm a real wild child
I'm a real wild child</i>

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,995
<i># I'm a real wild child</i>

35
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,112
There we go.
Stand by your beds.

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,509
And so, Judgement Day.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,192
- Go on.
- Watch it.

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,430
- What?
- You're standing on it.

39
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,950
Come here. Hey!

40
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,315
Hey, mind the walls.

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,677
- Got you!
- Mimi!

42
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,751
Mimi, he's hurting me!

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,718
It works!

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,791
Mimi, it works!

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,678
Can we turn it over,
see if something else is on?

46
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,548
<i>No, John,
we do not turn Tchaikovsky over.</i>

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,390
<i>We'll slide the cockpit open
to see what's wrong.</i>

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,950
<i>Good evening.</i>

49
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,551
<i>It ain't half cold out here.</i>

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,197
<i>- What's that?
- It ain't half cold out here.</i>

51
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,235
Hey, hey, come on, cheeky git.

52
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,108
- You'll get me in trouble.
- Yeah, well, you're always in trouble.

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,509
- What, with Mimi? Don't be daft.
- She never looks happy.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,797
Ever been married to me?

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,719
Right, now, go on, you're missing
your show and I'm missing me pub.

56
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,394
<i>- What's this one?
- Don't touch it!</i>

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,594
<i>Ooh, it's the ejector seat.</i>

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,834
<i>Come back, where are you?</i>

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,838
Uncle George?

60
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,597
- Mimi, we were only mucking about.
- He's just had a fall.

61
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,116
There's nothing to see.
Stop fussing, he'll be right as rain.

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,192
- But, Mimi...
- Stay here, we'll be back soon enough.

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,592
Mimi?

64
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,913
He's dead.

65
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,639
Please, let's not be silly.

66
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,950
If you want to do that,
you go to your room.

67
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,757
It's just the two of us now
so let's get on with it, shall we?

68
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,633
<i>God will show us
the path of life.</i>

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,036
In His presence is the fullness of joy.

70
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,472
At his right hand,
there is pleasure for evermore.

71
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,511
...brother George.

72
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,390
Give thanks for his life
and comfort one another in our grief.

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,312
Fancy Blackpool tomorrow?
Play the arcades, go on some rides.

74
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,356
I don't need looking after, Stan.

75
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,194
I know. I'm just asking
if you want to go to Blackpool.

76
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,799
He was my uncle, too.

77
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,270
Yeah, but he was more than
just an uncle to me, wasn't he?

78
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,557
You saw her, too, right?
The one with the red hair?

79
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,478
Where is she now?

80
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,591
Do you want me to ask Aunt Mimi?

81
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,516
John wants to know where Aunt Julia is.

82
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,397
She was busy, apparently.
Things to do.

83
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,079
You should call her Mum, you know.
The one with the red hair.

84
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,597
John?

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,197
- John, have you got your glasses?
- They're in my pocket.

86
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,555
And is your pocket blind?

87
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,189
Now, you will be careful.
Be careful who you talk to.

88
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,430
It's only Blackpool, Mimi.

89
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,157
I found out where your mum lives.

90
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,593
- You wanted to see her, right?
- Yeah, but...

91
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,989
- We don't have to.
- No, no.

92
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,351
- What bus do we get?
- We don't. We walk.

93
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,397
Are you coming or what?

94
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,795
Blackpool's loss, our gain.

95
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,558
But we love Blackpool,
don't we, girls? Fun, fun, fun!

96
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,995
I knew you were coming, though.
Do you want to know how I knew?

97
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,629
Because I baked a cake!

98
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,910
What do you think? Nice, eh?

99
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,592
Vanilla buns.

100
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,318
- One for you, Julia.
- Thank you.

101
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,470
- One for you, Jackie.
- Thank you.

102
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,638
Hey, steady on.

103
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,868
Ooh, a mouthie! Let's have a look.

104
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,988
Hohner. German.
Boo! Down with the Krauts!

105
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,071
Good at mouthies, though.

106
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,151
Not so good at war.

107
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,558
- Do you mind?
- No.

108
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,995
Your spit's my spit, anyway.

109
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,270
Good lungs on it.

110
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,035
Uncle George gave it me
just before he died.

111
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,358
He'll be missed. He was a good man.

112
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,549
Come on.

113
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,190
<i># Mr Sandman, bring me a dream</i>

Do you know what it means, rock'n'roll?

137
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,789
Sex.

Bobby! John, here!

144
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,352
Hello, John.

145
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,354
We've been to Blackpool,
haven't we, John?

146
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,830
- We found Ike Turner on the South Pier.
- Oh, yeah, was he lost?

147
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,359
Stan brought him over. You know Stan?

148
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,708
Stan looked after the girls
while we were out.

149
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,190
- They should be in bed, eh?
- I know, but John's here.

150
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,276
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Yeah, and it's late.

151
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,875
<i>Come on, you two, wake up.
Let's go. Come on.</i>

152
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,309
I'll take them up. Come on.

153
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,873
Come on, John. It's getting dark.

154
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,592
Next time I'll make Eccles cakes.
I love those.

155
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,838
Don't tell Mimi, please.
This is our secret.

156
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,998
Promise me.

157
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,513
We'll have an even better time
next time, OK?

158
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,351
Go now, go!

159
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,718
<i>I love you!</i>

160
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,391
You're my dream!

161
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,272
Don't forget that.

162
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,191
<i>Mummy?</i>

163
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,116

<i>Mummy?</i>

165
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,358
<i>What happened next
was described as a miracle of...</i>

<i>Lennon!</i>

167
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,552
<i>John. John!</i>

168
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,676
- Churchill.
- Churchill, sir.

169
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,478
Too late!

170
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,598

Shit. I've nicked the wrong stuff here.

Hang on.

197
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,760
- Jazz shit.
- Hey, cool it!

198
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,356
- Have some respect. Music is music.
- Well worked out, clever clogs.

199

No man's vinyl
deserves to be tossed in the drink.

200
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,877
- But it's jazz.
- Jazz is cool.

201
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,269

- Tell Billie Holiday that.

Sure, where is he?

Yous are rock'n'rollers, right?

204

- Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Killer, baby!

209
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,756

- No. I bet Mum has. Mum knows everyone.

210
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,192

211

It doesn't sound like that.

226
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,236
They forgot to lock the zoo. I never
knew you fucked monkeys, Marie.

227
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,673
We can fuck you, dickhead.

228
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,274
- We're joking.
- I don't have primates for mates.

229
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,069
Ooh, fucking killer, baby!

230
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,436
Come on, then, brains,
it's not hard. Push.

231
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,830
Come on, that's enough.

Marie, my guardian angel.
Lads. Always a pleasure.

Let's not leave it so long, eh?

235
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,877
- Screamin' Jay Hawkins!
- I'll put a spell on you, Shotton.

236
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,428

238
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,150
Tut-tut,
your boyfriend wouldn't be happy.

239
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,038
- He's not my boyfriend.
- What is he? Apart from ugly.

240
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,917
He's my cousin.

241
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,791

Your parents and your aunt
will get letters in the post.

268
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,754
I don't want you near this school
for at least a week.

269
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,397
I don't even know when I want you back.

270
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,073
Questions?

271
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,469
Any chance I can get
the magazine back, sir?

272
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,598
- I didn't see you there.
- Where did you see me, then?

273
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,839
How was school?

274
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,912
Alright.
Killing us with homework, though.

275
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,390
Tonight we've got maths,
chemistry, physics

276
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,710

Where have you been?

278

Veronica Connor tells me
she saw you on the roof of a bus.

279
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,950
It's as if you choose to embarrass me.
Just remember all I have done for you.

280
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,838
Without me, you'd be in
a children's home. Remember that.

281
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,592

Don't you walk away.

288
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,836

- I'm a student at the university.

289
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,275
- A student of what?
- Of biochemistry.

290
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,353
Come in.

291
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,557

295
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,750
Michael! How's things?

296
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,719
- Not bad, John. Yourself?
- Fine, thank you. How's school?

297
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,360
- You mean university.
- Same thing.

298
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,752
Biochemistry, right? What does that mean
you'll be when you grow up?

299
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,549
- A biochemist, I hope.
- Really? You must be so excited.

300
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,598
See you, Fishy.
Stay out of trouble, lad.

310
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,231

- What about school?

311
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,992
I've been suspended, me and Pete.

312
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,868
John! What for?

313
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,952
Showing pornography

314
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,117
You've not told Mimi, have you?

315
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,078
No point going through her bollocks
if you don't have to.

316
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,230
Why? She has to go through yours.

317
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,356
I never asked her to, did I?

318
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,399
Can I stay with you?
Just during the day.

319
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,678
It's covered. I burnt the suspension
letter. Mimi still thinks I'm at school.

320
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,830
She won't find out, I swear.

321
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,959
Please?

322
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,350
You know, be a mate.

Hold it like this.
Arm horizontal from the elbow.

324
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,758
Strum from the wrist. Think Bo Diddley.

325

"Strum from the wrist. "

326
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,032
John, be serious
or I'll phone Mimi myself.

327
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,071
Now, just strum.

328
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,397

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,599
Yes. No, Mr Pobjoy,
there's no need to introduce yourself.

341
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,272
I see.

342
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,751
Where is he?

343
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,598
<i># Well, that'll be the day</i>

344
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,433
<i># When you say goodbye, yeah</i>

345
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,431
<i># That'll be the day</i>

346
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,511
<i># That you make me cry</i>

347
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,114
<i># Oh, you say you're...
Come on, Mum!</i>

348
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,234
- You're missing it. Come on.
- No, Julia!

349
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,313
This may be your life,
one big, common mess, but it is not his.

350
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,595
Are you aware he has been suspended?

351
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,238
Yes.

352
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,591
Come on, out.

353
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,678
I mean it!

354
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,638
Get out of my house. Go, Mimi.

355
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,992
My boy!

356
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,797
My boy.

357
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,831
Come on, you, eat your chips.

358
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,275
- Getting a little dry at the mouth.
- Don't be disgusting!

359
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,669
You wouldn't mind lighting my fag?

360
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,111
You'll set the house on fire.

361
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,434
I've stolen little Julia's bed.

362
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,954
She's your sister.
She's happy you're here.

363
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,792
How long can I stay?

364
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,192
Nighty-night.

365
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,272
<i>Mummy?</i>

366
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,837
<i>Daddy?</i>

367
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,638
<i>Mummy?</i>

368
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,312
<i>Daddy? Mummy?</i>

369
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,159
<i>John?</i>

370
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,395
<i>I could get a job.
Please, Bobby!</i>

371
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,233
<i>I know I could make this work.
Let's try.</i>

372
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,788
<i>Who's gonna look after the girls?</i>

373
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,158
<i>Just part time. I'll ask
at the café. Anywhere. I could do this.</i>

374
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,916
<i>No, you can't!
It'll be too much for you. Eh?</i>

375
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,198
Everything will get too much for you
again and I'll lose you again.

376
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,548
And I need you.
Well, the girls need you.

377
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,790
I need John. I am his mother.

378
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,440
Mimi's been looking after him
since he was five.

379
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,512
I never wanted that!
Bobby, it's not fair!

380
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,797
Yeah, well, that's how it turned out,
didn't it?

381
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,555
- Mimi needs John.
- I need him!

382
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,836
- I need him to be mine!
- Look, he'll be OK.

383
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,790
Listen to me.

384
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,190
For the girls. We can't lose you again.

385
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,594
Alright? He's got to go. OK?

386
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,672
- OK.
- Yeah. Good.

387
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,592
Come here.

388
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,752
That's it.

389
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,953
I think I'll just go.
It's wrong taking little Julia's bed.

390
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,116
Thanks for the banjo lessons.

391
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,192
Mum?

392
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,478
Mum?

393
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,319
Hey.

394
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,956
Come on.

395
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,752
Have you decided
where you're living nowadays?

396
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,594
She'll hurt you.
You know that, don't you?

397
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,228
I'm gonna start a rock'n'roll group.

398
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,231
Be like Elvis.

399
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,194
<i># Well, I'm gonna get me
some rockin' shoes</i>

400
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,475
<i># And I'm gonna rock away
all of my blues</i>

401
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,596
<i># I'm a rockin' daddy</i>

402
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,148
<i># Yeah, a rockin' daddy</i>

403
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,835
<i># I'm a rockin' daddy
from Ding Dong, Tennessee</i>

404
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,708
<i>It's just three chords.
That's rock'n'roll, it's simple.</i>

405
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,554
- Do you have to be simple to like it?
- Funny. Well done.

406
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,278
Your sarcasm worries me.

407
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,557
What? Not up to your high standards?

408
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,509
Not exactly Bach, though, is it?

409
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,397
- The Gallotone Champion?
- Yeah.

410
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,678
Bangs out a solid tune. Guaranteed
not to split and a very good price.

411
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,797
- What's very good about it?
- Eight pounds and four shillings.

412
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,839
- That's not very good, is it?
- Borderline mediocre, if you ask me.

413
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,912
- Very good would be...
- Seven pounds, cash.

414
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,797
That's very good.

415
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,872
Just don't shoot, OK?

416
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,479
- At ease, fuckwits.
- What's up, John?

417
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,835
I take it we're not here
for a communal crap.

418
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,912
You've been picked to be in my band.

419
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,911
- A band?
- A band, John?

420
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,116
I don't know how to play.

421
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,270
It's a skiffle band.
You don't have to know.

422
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,875
What's important is I've chosen you
and we're going to be great.

423
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,518
But what if we're shit?

424
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,556
- Shut up, tool.
- It's a good question.

425
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,677
- Eric, you've got a guitar, right?
- Yeah.

426
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,228
- Len, tea chest bass.
- What the hell's that?

427
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,629
A tea chest
with a broom handle and string.

428
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,349
- Easy, you just do a bit of this.
- Sounds sexy. Thanks, John.

429
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,716
Pete, washboard, son.

430
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,074
Great, lovely.

431
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,109
- Rodders, you own a banjo, right?
- That's right. My uncle is a busker.

432
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,031
What about me, John?

433
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,114
Manager.

434
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,036
Now, wash your hands, you dirty bugger.

435
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,032
All we need now
is a drummer with his own kit.

436
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,112
A lad called Colin who lives behind me
has his own kit.

437
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,398
He's in. First practice, six. Pete's
air raid shelter in his back yard.

438
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,392
If you don't come,
I'll batter the lot of yous. Questions?

439
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,040
- My air raid shelter.
- Shut it, Spunky.

440
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,635
- Questions? Anyone?
- Do we have a name?

441
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,198
Yes, Rodders, we do.

442
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,871
Crazy fool.

443
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,790
Right, are we ready to do this, boys?

444
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,871
- Yeah.
- I said, are we ready to do this?

445
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,951
- Yeah.
- Good.

446
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,509
- Let's fucking do it, then.
- Let's go.

447
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,955
<i>...local youngsters
performing for the very first time.</i>

448
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,237
<i>Please give them your support,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

449
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,312
<i>Local boys, the Quarrymen!</i>

450
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,595
Go, Johnny boy!

451
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,877
Where have you gone? I've lost you.

452
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,511
No, I haven't, there you all are.

453

<i># I was flat and stony broke</i>

471
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,550
That was great, that was great.
You were all shitting yourself.

472
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,636
Hey, John. John?

473
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,190
Paul, a mate of mine from school.
Paul plays too.

474
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,078
What, with himself?

475
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,751
I do, all the time.
It's good for the wrist muscles.

476
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,233
- I'm John.
- Paul.

477
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,791
- Want a beer?
- I'd love a tea.

478
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,268
- Is there any tea left?
- There's no tea left.

479
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,351
No, I didn't think so.

480
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,673
- So, did you watch us play?
- Yeah, yeah.

481
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,194
- And?
- Yeah, you're alright.

482
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,475
We're alright?

483
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,477
You're alright.
Ivan likes you and he's alright.

484
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,950
- How alright are you on one of those?
- I'm alright.

485
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,594
You got that back to front,
haven't you, mate?

486
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,473
Any requests?

487
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,358
That pink carnation is very dandy.
Can I borrow it?

- How old are you?
- 15.

500
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,671
- When?
- Last month.

501
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,638
- I can do Little Richard as well.
- Sorry. Tick-tock.

502
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,280
Nice to meet you
but we've got to rehearse.

503
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,157
- Well, I've got to get off anyway...
- Ta-ta, then.

504
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,639
Alright.

505
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,200
I'd rather him in our band
than anyone else's.

506
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,310
John, your little friend is here.

507
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,595
It goes A.

508
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,671
But you start on D.

509
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,796
Bollocks! Hang on a sec.

510
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,037
Keep going.

511
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,476
- It's my Buddy Holly look.
- Good.

512
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,555
- D.
- Right, yeah, D.

513
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,831
So from D, it goes to E minor.

514
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,912
No, B minor, that's a banjo chord.

515
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,869
- So B minor, it's...
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

516
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,598
To G.

517
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,796
G.

518
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,472
To A.

519
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,591
And then it just starts again.

520
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,957
B minor to G.

521
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,194
<i># Blue moon</i>

522
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,392

523
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,193

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,312
That's much better acoustically. Thanks.

526
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,390
So, Mummy's cool about baby Paul
wanting to be Elvis?

527
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,238
- She would have loved it.
- Bollocks!

528
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,237
- She's not around any more.
- What?

529
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,959
Well, she...
She sort of died last year.

530
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,879
You know, if we're going to do this,
we should write our own stuff.

531
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,758
Then you don't get stiffed
by record companies.

532
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,718
I write stuff.

533
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,990
Not songs, more poetry...
you know, stories.

534
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,798
Add a tune and you've got a song.

535
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,599
- Have you written any?
- A couple.

536
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,270
How do you know so much?

537
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,920
You don't seem like
the rock'n'roll kind of guy.

538
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,788
You mean I don't go round smashing
things up and acting like a dick?

539
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,915
Yeah.

540
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,833
No. It's the music.

541
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,354
That's it, it's just music. Simple.

542
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,469
Where is it?

543
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,239
- Mimi, where's my guitar?
- I've had your report.

544
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,311
You promised me hard work.

545
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,552
Lie and cheat all you want with others.
Do so with me and expect consequences!

546
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,751
- Where is it?
- I've sold it.

547
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,757
- You can't.
- I can and I have.

548
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,957
- But we've got gigs.
- What a shame.

549
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,599
Oh, boo-hoo!

550
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,875
- But it's my group.
- Grow up, John.

551
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,032
- Stop behaving like a child.
- Well, fuck off, Mimi.

552
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,873
- What did you say?
- I said fuck off!

553
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,071
<i># I'm leaving town, baby</i>

554
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,276

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,149

566
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,399
So I got it back.
Yeah, Mum bought it for me.

567
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,795
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

568
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,670
Next, the Scouse Duane Eddy
will play Moving and Grooving.

569
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,990
I present to you Mr Paul McCharmly.

570
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,071
Ta.

571
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,157
- Thanks, John. Kind words.
- I didn't mean them.

572
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,873
Whoo!

573
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,109
This is George.
He's a mate of mine.

574
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,239
- He should be in the group.
- He should be in bed.

575
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,393
- No, I've been to bed. Couldn't sleep.
- Go on, George, show them.

576
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,877
What? Magic tricks?

577
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,394
No, I've left my top hat at home.

578
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,191
Abracadabra eh, John?

579
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,710
Gorgeous, isn't he?

580
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,111
I need to calm down now.
I'm embarrassing myself.

581
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,795
- That was brilliant.
- Wasn't bad, was it?

582
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,915
It was so good.

583
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,798
We need to celebrate... everything.

584
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,350
It's John's birthday soon so let's have
a party, at mine, Saturday. OK?

585
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,796
- Can we get boozed up?
- Only if I can.

586
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,998
- What about birds, Mrs Lennon?
- Let's just keep them in their cages.

587
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,795
What do you reckon then, Johnny boy?

588
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,518
I think... I need a piss.

589
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,231
Who has got a light for a lady?

590
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,151
Have you got a ticket?

591
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,429
If you don't want her hanging
around the band, do something about it.

592
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,397
It's my fucking band.

593
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,590
John, the driver's not stopping.

594
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,999
Thanks for that. Give us a ciggie.

595
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,678
Excuse me. That's very cosy.

596
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,353
He said it's the police or the navy.

597
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,749
My old man's giving me no other choice.

598
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,195
Imagine me in a copper's uniform,
nicking people.

599
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,591
Nicking you.

600
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,395
I sometimes wish I had tits, you know?

601
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,075
Not in a weird way,
just to have a little mess around with.

602
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,316
- Hey, Winston?
- What?

603
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,277
- This party.
- Yeah.

604
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,952
We don't have to go.

605

00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,991

That was for her, wasn't it? Your mum.

617
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,032
It was awful. Taken away from you...
It's not fair.

618
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,350
She had cancer.

619
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,792

620
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,076

Can someone turn that bloody record off
before I start crying... in pain?

629
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,759
Give us a few words, Johnny boy.

630
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,310
Cock, balls, fuck.

631
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,597
- Is that allowed?
- Speech! Speech!

632
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,796
Well, ta, for turning up.
You're very special to me...

633
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,952
...in that I hate you all equally.

634
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:54,319
Apart from you, Mum, obviously.

635
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,391
Thanks for all this.

636
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,835
Well, big clap, folks,
you know, for Julia.

637
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,229
And my band. What can I say?

638
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,278
You really are there for me. Never
on time, usually looking like shite,

639
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,920
but, nevertheless,
you're there or thereabouts.

640
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,831
Speak for yourself, eh, Lennon!

641
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,310
- So, where are we going, boys?
- To the toppity top, Johnny.

642
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,188
That's right.
To the toppity of one's topness.

643
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,953
Except the boy Shotton wants out.

644
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,635
I know. Apparently, washboard players
don't get enough chicks

645
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,508
and he feels like a pansy
in his mum's sewing thimbles.

646
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,353
Come here, spunkhead.

647
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,636
Worth a few bob when we're famous.

648
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,517
He's alright.

<i>For fuck's sake!</i>

650
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,634
- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a ciggie.

651
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,278
Have one here.

652
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,591
I wonder if someone's up there on Mars,
having a quick cigarette like me.

653
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,079
Where's Dad?

654
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,670
They're called dads, right?
Most people I know have got one.

655
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,355
- I don't think...
- Don't you, Mum? Well, I do.

656
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,829
Think, think, think. That's all I do.

657
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,793
Where's Daddy, Mummy?
Alf, that's his name, right?

658
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,793
- Where's fucking Alf?
- Please don't swear, John.

659
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,552
Make you feel uncomfortable?

660
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,428
Try being me for 17 years when everyone
asks why your auntie is your mum.

661
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,795
Now, that's uncomfortable.

662
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,509
Here we go.

663
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,473
Who turned the taps on?

664
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,076
- Please don't be horrible to me, John.
- Me being horrible to you?

665
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,948
I see. Horrible John,
naughty John, poor Julia.

666
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,919
No, no. No walking away. I know
you're good at it, but not tonight.

667
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,195
Where is he?

668
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,155
- New Zealand, maybe. I don't know.
- Not round the corner, like you?

669
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,395
He was in the merchant navy.

670
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,314
No letters, no money. He abandoned us.

671
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,277
Then you abandoned me!

672
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,079
It was a temporary thing. Mimi agreed.

673
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,515
Temporary? I'm still living with her.

674
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,388
- I always wanted you back.
- I believe you. Honest.

675
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,948
She never gave you back.

676
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,237
But surely I'm not Mimi's to give.

677
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,197
You're my mum.

678
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,753
She... She loves you so much.

679
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,397
Yeah, more than you.

680
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,676
<i>Mummy? I'm tired now.</i>

681
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,358
- Are you sad again?
- Mummy's not sad. Look.

682
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,795
I'm coming in now, honey.

683
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,472
Go on.

684
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,318
I do love you. Believe me.

685
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,073
Believe me, I would love to.

686
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,555
- John, where are you going?
- Away from you.

687
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,034
<i>Mimi.</i>

688
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,991
You said you'd be back.

689
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,071
I think I'll just...
I've got some work to finish.

690
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,470
It was meant to be a surprise.

691
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,029
A Hoffner!

692
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,553
Mimi.

693
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,909
You stink of alcohol.

694
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,195
Mum threw a party for me.

695
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,995
That's a waste, isn't it?

696
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,358
<i>Tell your friends the party's over.</i>

697
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,191
No, thanks.

698
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,394
- We've got a gatecrasher.
- I need to talk to John.

699
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,471
More talking? Wow!

700
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,358
You see, me and Mum
have had a bit of a heart-to-heart.

701
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,353
Yes, she told me things about...
What's his name...? Alf.

702
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,716
And about you, funnily enough.
Yeah, she said you stole me.

703
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,792
- What do you reckon, Mimi?
- I never said that.

704
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,270
You said, quote, "She," as in you,
Mimi, "never gave you back. "

705
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,955
When I don't give things back,
I've got to admit, I'm usually stealing.

706
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,918
What on earth have you
been telling him, Julia?

707
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,195
Did she say why I stole you?

708
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,669
Well, there she is. Ask her yourself.

709
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,116
Did she mention having another man's
child to deal with? A daughter?

710
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,394
Mimi, please.

711
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,075
Please what? Stop? Look at him.

712
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,673
Do you think we can stop now?

713
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,192
Whose child?

714
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,549
Go on, tell him, as you're
so keen for him to know the truth.

715
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,356
What daughter?

716
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,072
Your mother has always needed company.
Do you understand what I mean?

717
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,911
Rock'n'roll, eh, Mum?

718
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:38,237
And she found it, with a young soldier
whilst your father was away at sea.

719
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,675
You have another sister. Victoria.

720
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,597
Where is she? Where?

721
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,275
We don't know. Salvation Army took her.

722
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,877
Then, after that,

723
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,238
your mother decides to shack up
with another fancy man, Bobby.

724
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,515
Still married to your father,
I might add,

725
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,036
and then bring you up as if that was
acceptable, as if that was normal.

726
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,235
When your father came home
after the war,

727
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:16,108
he wanted to try and save the marriage,
but she'd have none of it.

728
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,191
She told him to get lost.

729
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,033
But Alf wasn't giving up that easily.
Was he, Julia?

730
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,510
Feel free
to join the conversation.

731
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,391
No, I didn't think she would.

732
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,597
You were staying here with me
at Mendips

733
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,875
when Alf turned up out of the blue.

734
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,789
He said he wanted to take you
into Liverpool.

735
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,714
I thought he was genuine but he took you
to Blackpool instead. He kidnapped you.

736
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,553
Turned out he'd organised
a passage to New Zealand.

737
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,030
Got himself a job out there.
Wanted to take you with him.

738
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,958
We hadn't a clue where you were.
I was distraught!

739
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,677
The Seaman's Mission had an address
for a relative in Blackpool

740
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,796
so we went to find you,
to bring you back.

741
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,159
<i>Alf wouldn't let me in. Said
it was between him and your mother.</i>

742
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,118
<i>He pleaded with her
to give the marriage another chance,</i>

743
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,159
<i>to keep the family together,
but, again, it was of no use.</i>

744
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,755
But what to do with you?

745
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,277
So, in all their great wisdom...

746
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,238
Who do you want to be with,
me or your mum?

747
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,273
<i>...they decided to ask you,
a five-year-old boy,</i>

748
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,158
who you wanted to spend
the rest of your life with.

749
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,708
And you said...

750
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,755
My daddy.

751
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,039
Daddy.

752
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,510
<i>So knowing that Alf was planning
to take you to New Zealand</i>

753
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,273
<i>and knowing she
would probably never see you again,</i>

754
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,793
your mother walked out.

755
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:09,113
Mum! Please! Stop.

756
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,278
<i>And that is when I stole you!</i>

757
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,189
And if that's stealing, I'm a thief!

758
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,271
I had no choice!

759
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,876
You had a choice.

760
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,829
You chose to take my son.

761
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,110
John,
I was never going to leave you.

762
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,192
You walked out the fucking house,
down the street!

763
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,555
Yes, yes, I did, but I was ill.

764
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,949
- I get ill.
- You left because you were ill?

765
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,429
I don't think straight. I don't sleep.

766
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,034
I've seen doctors
but they don't understand.

767
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,918
I don't understand.
But I am here now.

768
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,355
I am here. I never meant to leave you.

769
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,433
Please, John, please. I love you, John.
I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

770
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,476
- No... No!
- Please, John.

771
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,959
I said no!

772
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,118
Can't you see what you're doing to me?

773
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:09,398
I'm going out of my brain
and that's not fair!

774
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,918
Is it?

775
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,675
This is your fault and yours.

776
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,871
So, why should I go mad?

777
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,598
Fuck it, it's over!

778
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,198
Go home, Julia.

779
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,795
Hey! You idiot.

780
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,598
No chance. Get to fuck.

781
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,198
Forgive me, angel.

782
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,790
Come on, Marie. He's a loser.

783
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,998
Did you love him?

784
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,073
- You frightened me to death.
- Right place for it.

785
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,397
Did you?

786
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,869
Well, that's a horrible thing to say.

787
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,157
- You never showed it.
- You just didn't see it.

788
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,630
With my eyesight, possibly.

789
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,591
I'm not going to hold it against her,
what she did in Blackpool.

790
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,478
- Forgive and forget, I suppose.
- Forget?

791
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,633
I wish.

792
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,474
There's just no point
hating someone you love.

793
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,791
I mean, really love. Is there, Mimi?

794
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,434
- I should move out.
- What?

795
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,988
The house seems a bit crowded
all of a sudden.

796
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,914
Who knows, with me gone,

797
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,549
maybe you and Mum might remember
you were sisters once.

798
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,589
- Have you ordered?
- Yes, tea.

799
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,313
It's good to see you.

800
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,995
- Here you are.
- Lovely. Do you have any Earl Grey?

801
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,868
You're confusing us with Buckingham
Palace, love. It's easily done.

802
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,592
I am not here to say I was wrong, Julia.
Not about John.

803
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,671
I want that to be perfectly clear.

804
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,599
But...

805
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,595
Perhaps I haven't always been right.

806
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,074
I do love you.

807
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,156
I hope you know that.

808
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,958
<i>Do you own a licence
for those legs, ladies?</i>

809
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,991
<i>It's a nice day for it, then.</i>

810
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,753
Everything feels so different
in the sunshine.

811
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,229
Yes, usually warmer.

812
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,392
How was college?

813
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,597
A woman came in, took her kit off
and we painted her breasts.

814
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,989
Not actually physically.

815
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,160
I've got my eye on you two.

816
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,313
Where are you going?

817
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,675
Paul's waiting for me at his.

818
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,149
- What about dinner?
- I'm not hungry.

819
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,232
- Well, you will be.
- He could have his dinner at my house.

820
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,312
Just with him being near,
you know, at Paul's.

821
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,597
I mean, if you're not making
anything special, Mimi.

822
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,672
Saves me from cooking, I suppose.

823
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:30,629
Get to it, Fishy lad. Privets
don't prune themselves, you know?

824
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:35,668
Go on. Sit down for a bit.

825
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,993
<i># Hello, little girl</i>

826
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,470
<i># Hello, little girl</i>

827
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,278

830
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,990
<i># Hello, little girl</i>

831
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,798
<i>- Don't be silly.
- # When I see you passing by, I cry</i>

832
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,916
<i># Hello, little girl</i>

833
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,594
<i># When I try and catch your eye, I cry</i>

834
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,513
<i># Hello, little girl</i>

835
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,751
- Is John at home?
- At Paul's. I'm seeing him later.

836
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,558
Tell him I've got a new booking.

837
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,359
- The Stanley Abattoir Social Club.
- Not there.

838
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,238
- Why not?
- You'll get slaughtered!

839
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,995
<i># So I hope there'll come a day
when you say</i>

840
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,469
<i># You're my little girl</i>

841
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,874
<i># You're my little girl</i>

842
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,272
<i># You're my little girl</i>

843
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,388
What is this? Fucking group practice?
I don't think so.

844
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,074
- John, it's your mum's.
- She's fucking dead!

845
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,313
John!

846
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,799
John!

847
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,916
Do you want to hit me, too?

848
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:58,829
Well, go on, then.

849
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,189
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

850
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,194
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

851
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,915
I was just getting to know her.

852
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,999
I know.

853
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,517
She's never coming back.

854
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:38,195
No. No, she's not.

855
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,878
I'm a dick.

856
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,998
I'm sorry, son.

857
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:20,672
Right. Everyone stop fucking crying.

858
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,752
We're supposed to be a rock'n'roll
band, for Christ's sake.

859
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,399
John.

860
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,992
She was saving this for you.

861
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,030
There's a few bob in there.

862
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,593
<i># In spite of all the danger</i>

863
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,994
- 17 and six.
- It's all there.

<i># If you'll be true to me</i>

892
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,190
- Why didn't you telephone?
- I don't have a phone.

893
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,989
Do you have anything of use
in that hole you call a home?

894
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:44,709
Ashtrays, some of Stu's paintings...
But ashtrays, mostly.

895
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,314
You'll catch something rotten.

896
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,116
To what do I owe the pleasure?

897
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,918
I'm off to Hamburg.

898
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,076
- It's in Germany, Mimi.
- Hamburg? Humbug.

899
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:01,948
I'll be gone a couple of months.
Maybe even more.

900
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,229
And is this with the new group, the...
What are they called again?

901
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:16,068
- Do you care?
- They all sound the same to me.

902
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,358
We leave Saturday.

903
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:24,079
Have you got my birth certificate?
I need it to get a passport.

904
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,718
Could you sign this, please?

905
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,430
- Where do I sign?
- Where it says "parent or guardian".

906
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,636
But which am I?

907
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,519
Both.

908
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,991
Don't be silly.

909
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,238
John!

910
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,073
Glasses.

911
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,115
I'll call when I get to Hamburg, OK?

912
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,953
Don't forget. Please.

913
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,390
<i># Goodbye</i>

914
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,991
<i>OK, start now.</i>

921
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,192

922
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,588

01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:16,796
<i># Goodbye</i>

924
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,798
<i># Father, you left me</i>

925
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,998
<i># But I never left you</i>

926
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,595
<i># Oh, I needed you</i>

927
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,598
<i># You didn't need me</i>

928
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,272
<i># Oh, no</i>

929
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,072
<i>Yes, yes.
Well, that was more like it.</i>
