1
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:52,849
Hyperion!

2
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:16,537
<i>When this world
was still young...</i>

3
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:22,615
<i>long before man or beast
roamed these lands...</i>

4
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:29,319
<i>there was a war in the heavens.</i>

5
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,490
<i>Immortals, once thought
incapable of death...</i>

6
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:39,389
<i>discovered they had the power
to kill one another.</i>

7
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:45,698
<i>- Lost in this war was a weapon</i>-

8
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:48,200
<i>The Epirus Bow.</i>

9
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:53,339
<i>The victors declared themselves gods</i>

10
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:57,474
<i>while the vanquished
were renamed Titans,</i>

11
00:03:57,606 --> 00:04:01,748
<i>and forever imprisoned
within the bowels of Mount Tartarus.</i>

12
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:07,922
<i>Eons passed. Mankind flourished.</i>

13
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,894
<i>And the great war
receded from memory.</i>

14
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:16,864
<i>But the evil that once was...</i>

15
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,239
<i>has re-emerged.</i>

16
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:07,417
Stop. You cannot enter here.
This is sacred ground.

17
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:09,922
Sacred for who?

18
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,123
What do you want with us?

19
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,323
Where is the virgin oracle?

20
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:24,528
Defile this house further
and you will risk the wrath of the gods.

21
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:29,506
The gods?

22
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:35,180
Gods.

23
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,611
Gods.

24
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,745
Go ahead, call upon them.

25
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:46,022
Pray. Ask for their help.

26
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,898
Pray to the same gods
who idly stood by...

27
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:57,165
as my wife and my children
were stricken by disease.

28
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:00,835
I, too, cried to the heavens for help.

29
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:08,913
But instead of mercy,
I was met with silence.

30
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:11,415
And the wretched sight of my family...

31
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:15,812
suffering like animals
until their deaths.

32
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:18,682
Your gods will no longer mock me.

33
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:24,887
I will release the Titans.

34
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,694
It's not too late to end this madness.

35
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:30,326
Salvation can be yours, if you wish it.

36
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,300
Let me enlighten you, priest.

37
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:44,083
I will end the reign of gods.

38
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,901
You wield that ax well, Theseus.

39
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:07,338
Maybe someday we'll see you use
the same determination to find a wife.

40
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:10,304
Are you conspiring with my mother now?

41
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:12,075
She worries about you.

42
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:14,270
There's no need to worry about me.

43
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,045
You know, being a warrior...

44
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:21,985
is not just being able to strike
your opponent down with a sword.

45
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,820
It's finding good reason
to draw your sword in the first place.

46
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,888
I draw my sword
to protect those that I love.

47
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:32,396
What about the others?

48
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,695
- The others turn their backs on me.
- The weak?

49
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:38,896
The defenseless?
Who's going to protect them?

50
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,969
Careful. Too much worrying
will make you an old man.

51
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:58,914
- Whore.
- Oh!

52
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:02,155
Last lights for the labyrinth.

53
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,992
Last lights for the holy labyrinth.

54
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:12,902
Let the ancestors rest in peace.

55
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:36,553
Theseus...

56
00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:39,524
May the gods be with you.

57
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:43,066
Thank you for the offerings.

58
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,534
Another accident?

59
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:52,107
Theseus. Maybe one day
you'll join me in prayer.

60
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,908
Ask the gods to grant me grandchildren
before I'm too old.

61
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:59,417
Mother, your gods are children's
stories. My spear is not.

62
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:04,315
And you know, Mother, it takes more
than lighting candles to make babies.

63
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,524
Besides, our priest
wears a ridiculous hat.

64
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:10,552
Theseus.

65
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:45,491
Mother, stay here.

66
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,963
Theseus.

67
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,355
Fellow Hellenics!

68
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,958
It is with great concern
that I stand before you.

69
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:17,422
The Heraklion king, Hyperion,
has seized the Sibylline Monastery.

70
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,030
He is only a day's march from here.

71
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:24,160
We must evacuate
this village immediately.

72
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,999
We must fight him
at the gates of our village!

73
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,506
Silence, please! Quiet!

74
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,166
Villagers, we stand no chance!

75
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:33,370
- I said fall in, Lysander!
- We stand no chance!

76
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,175
He is weary from battle!

77
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:40,048
Please. We ask that every man, woman
and child gather your belongings.

78
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:41,813
Leave for Mount Tartarus

79
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:45,753
Seek refuge behind the safety
of the great wall!

80
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:47,656
There you will be protected.

81
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:51,025
Anyone who needs more time,
the old, the infirm,

82
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:52,894
we will escort in a day's time.

83
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:55,467
- Only what you can carry.
- Prepare your departure.

84
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,161
Leave it. It's not essential.
Give me that.

85
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:02,204
Leave that.

86
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:04,536
Move along now.

87
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,243
You're with the wrong party.

88
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:09,710
Is this not the caravan
traveling to Tartarus?

89
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:12,284
It is, but you will not
be traveling among us.

90
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:14,981
Go in the morning with your own kind.

91
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:16,849
My kind?

92
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:20,520
Peasants and undesirables
travel tomorrow.

93
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:24,789
My kind's blood
is the same color as yours.

94
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,456
- Should we spill some to prove it?
- Theseus.

95
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:27,828
Mother.

96
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:29,458
What happens here?

97
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,662
This bastard and his whore mother...

98
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:44,449
Stop! Fall back!

99
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,585
Fall back!

100
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,590
- Put the sword down.
- I will not!

101
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:55,285
- Kill him!
- Try! He dies first.

102
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:58,195
What is it that you want, brother?

103
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,699
It seems as though my kind
travel in the morning.

104
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:04,003
I want them to have a proper escort.

105
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:11,536
Move again, and I will bury this
in your skull.

106
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,113
- What's your name?
- Theseus.

107
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:18,241
Now is not the time
for violence, Theseus. Let him go.

108
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,279
Only if I have your word the rest
of the village will be protected.

109
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,688
You have my word. I will leave
capable men for the caravan tomorrow.

110
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,997
- Kill this traitor!
- Enough with your spectacle!

111
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:35,624
Restrain him! Get him out of my sight!

112
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:37,395
He's a bastard!

113
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,436
Take him away and disarm him.

114
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:40,562
Mother...

115
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:45,303
Save your bloodlust
for Heraklion veins, Theseus.

116
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:49,210
Join our ranks.
You have been trained well.

117
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,476
I had a good teacher.

118
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:56,987
I could use men of your skill at our
side to defeat Hyperion's legions.

119
00:12:57,112 --> 00:13:01,561
Why would I serve you?
You who would so easily abandon us

120
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,062
Let's go, Mother.

121
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:13,695
Lysander. You're no longer
pan of this army.

122
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:19,139
Relinquish your shield, your spear...

123
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,407
and remain here to travel
with the peasants tomorrow.

124
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:24,414
- But you saw him...
- It's done.

125
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:32,589
I'll see you later.

126
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:40,498
Where are your things, old man?
Are you not prepared for the march?

127
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,038
Such odysseys were meant
for the young and expectant,

128
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:48,573
not for a worn-out old goat like me.

129
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,837
Please reconsider.
You know staying here is suicide.

130
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:58,381
If the Heraklions show up,
at least I'll be spared a slow death.

131
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:03,478
From what I understand,
indecision is not their style.

132
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:06,253
You are mad.

133
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:07,621
No.

134
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,394
Just tired.

135
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:17,295
It's not living as such
that's important, Theseus.

136
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:19,868
It's living rightly.

137
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:29,205
They fight with a ferocity
unlike anything I've seen.

138
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:33,552
It was as if they could
see in the darkness.

139
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,653
As though it suited them.

140
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,485
You speak as if they're not human.

141
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:44,254
They are human.
The Heraklions bleed just as we do.

142
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,133
The only difference is
they fight for a belief

143
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:50,998
which allows them to kill
without restraint.

144
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,398
That is why they will win.

145
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:57,065
Lysander. I thought Helios
ordered you disarmed.

146
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,800
He did.

147
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,519
Reveal yourself.

148
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:54,724
Reveal yourself.

149
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,705
- Father.
- Athena.

150
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:13,644
- Zeus.
- No need for formalities.

151
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,186
None of the other gods
are looking, are they?

152
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:22,384
What?

153
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:26,362
When you walked up here just now,
you actually looked like a father.

154
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:28,966
Or maybe a grandfather.

155
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:34,671
We must tread carefully here.
Heed the law.

156
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:38,300
None of the mortals on Earth
should witness us in our immortal form.

157
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,413
But, Father, you've come
dangerously close.

158
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:43,778
You've been influencing
the boy Theseus for years.

159
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:46,784
Yet as one of them. Never as a god.

160
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,353
Only as his friend.

161
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:52,288
And why him?

162
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,260
He does not fear danger.

163
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:04,559
Nor pain, defeat, or ridicule.

164
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,636
He fears only the failure to defend
that which he holds so dear.

165
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,438
His loved ones.

166
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:17,981
If there is one human who could
lead them against Hyperion...

167
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,450
it would be Theseus.

168
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:24,286
But it must be his choice.

169
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:37,597
He's a defector.
He wants to meet the king.

170
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,001
Move.

171
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,363
You are a defector, I understand.

172
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:25,877
- Yes, my king.
- I am not your king.

173
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:30,683
But I wish you to be.

174
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:34,415
But you are a traitor by definition,
are you not?

175
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:39,220
What would I want
with a traitor in my midst?

176
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,921
I can tell you of a village
that lies unprotected...

177
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:49,460
where you can gather young women.
I have plenty of women.

178
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,538
- Slaves and weaponry.
- I have plenty of weapons.

179
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:57,332
What I want is the Epirus Bow.

180
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:04,014
Like this monastery, I have moved every
precious stone your people worship upon

181
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,147
And I have yet to find it.

182
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:28,767
Have you ever met
a Sibylline monk, traitor?

183
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:34,209
Monks of his order are unwavering
in their obedience to the virgin oracle.

184
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:38,884
With the right prodding, the oracle
could see where the Bow rests.

185
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,152
Couldn't she, monk?

186
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:47,959
Tell me where she is.

187
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:00,439
I know of your faith, monk.

188
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:05,700
Sybellines are forbidden to take a life
under any circumstance...

189
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:08,244
even their own.

190
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:13,177
You have no choice
but to tell me what I want to know.

191
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:26,989
A monk can be made to talk
with or without his tongue.

192
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:31,334
Give him to the beast. Make him tell you
where the oracle is being kept.

193
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:39,538
Do you have any children?

194
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:42,270
Not yet.

195
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:46,745
A man's seed can be
his most brutal weapon.

196
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:52,221
For generations, your people will
stare into the eyes of their sons

197
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,656
and they will see my likeness.

198
00:21:56,517 --> 00:22:00,055
I will be remembered
in every glance, every smile,

199
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:03,465
every tear that is shed for eternity.

200
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:07,403
But before your baptism,
understand that you are not

201
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:12,068
drawn here to my flame on instinct.

202
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:20,648
But you ran here
because you are a coward.

203
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:28,158
And the world does not need
any more cowards.

204
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:37,193
So, I shall do this world a great favor.

205
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,495
Mark you as one of us...

206
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:46,335
and rid you of your ability
to populate the Earth.

207
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:50,480
Traitor.

208
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:52,346
Although you will not hear them...

209
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,815
your forefathers weep
from their graves...

210
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:01,586
for the future of their bloodline...

211
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,494
ends with you here tonight.

212
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:14,364
Old Man?

213
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:19,136
Old Man.

214
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:30,613
Hello?

215
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,405
Your anger rules you, Theseus.
You must learn to master your emotions.

216
00:23:58,406 --> 00:24:02,013
Rhythm, Theseus. Rhythm.

217
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,363
You! Burn that down!

218
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:56,608
Get over here!

219
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:00,937
- No!
- Huh?

220
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:01,910
Theseus!

221
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:37,340
Wait.

222
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,857
Witness hell.

223
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:55,694
No!

224
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,368
No!

225
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:04,401
No!

226
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:06,767
Not him.

227
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:08,712
No!

228
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:12,249
Give him to the jailer.
He can work in the salt mines.

229
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,682
His pain has just begun

230
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:36,471
<i>Hyperion's legions
show no mercy.</i>

231
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,715
<i>They have destroyed every holy shrine
in their quest for the Epirus Bow.</i>

232
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:51,120
It is only a matter of time
before they find it.

233
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:57,028
I've noticed their king
takes the greatest care

234
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:59,495
with all women who carry a child.

235
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:03,000
And personally sees
to their slaughter.

236
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,563
He ventures to eradicate
a Hellenic future.

237
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,767
They honor no rules of engagement.

238
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:15,574
Effective. At least thus far.

239
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:16,704
Effective?

240
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:21,382
- Cowardly.
- That may be...

241
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,451
but the Hellenics have yet to adapt,
and until they do...

242
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,856
Isn't it time to intervene, Zeus?

243
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:33,263
How can you stomach bearing witness
to such atrocity whilst doing nothing?

244
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:38,359
I obey the law. No god shall interfere
in the affairs of man

245
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,733
unless the Titans are released.

246
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:44,172
If we are to expect mankind
to have faith in us,

247
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:46,039
then we must have faith in them.

248
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,704
We must allow them
to use their own free will.

249
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,245
And what if they unearth the Bow?

250
00:27:57,478 --> 00:28:01,483
If any of you come to the aid of man

251
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:05,688
or otherwise influence
the affairs of mankind as a god

252
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:09,263
the punishment will be death.

253
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,122
Who are they?

254
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:18,028
The virgin oracles. The Heraklions
must have found their temple.

255
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:22,333
- You don't know of them?
- I don't.

256
00:29:22,997 --> 00:29:24,999
I wouldn't mind knowing them all
for a night.

257
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:50,666
When cloudless
skies thunder, stand fast.

258
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:15,190
You were a thief?

259
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,425
I am a thief, my lady.

260
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:23,130
Were it not for these chains,
I'd steal your heart.

261
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,728
Tonight we must flee this place.

262
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:29,738
Whichever are strong enough to fight.

263
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,444
And that man there.

264
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:36,878
He didn't even go for the water.
He won't make it till morning.

265
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,244
Just be ready.

266
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:06,776
Stay apart.

267
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:11,038
Inside.

268
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,612
Stay alive.

269
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:12,470
Only one of them is the true oracle.
A seer. She is pure.

270
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:17,079
The others are there
to protect her identity.

271
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:23,719
The virgin oracle is blessed
with visions of the future.

272
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:29,219
Were she to be violated,
her gift of prophecy would be corrupted.

273
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:32,094
What a waste.

274
00:33:09,623 --> 00:33:11,660
- Guards!
- Keys!

275
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:53,509
You should get some sleep.

276
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,784
Do you know, I am stronger than I look?

277
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,687
I'll be fine.

278
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:14,326
Perhaps...

279
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:17,863
Perhaps you have
trouble sleeping because...

280
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,800
you're haunted by your visions.

281
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,439
A warrior who reads minds.

282
00:34:33,473 --> 00:34:37,546
Some people do consider
my visions to be a gift.

283
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:41,592
Gift? How can it be considered a gift

284
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:44,753
when you can see the future but you
don't have the power to change it?

285
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,537
Sony.

286
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,803
Why would you do such a thing?

287
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:05,209
You risked your life
to save a complete stranger.

288
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,282
Only a faithless man
would ask such a question.

289
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:11,752
My mother was a woman of faith

290
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:14,484
and her gods were absent
when she needed them the most.

291
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:22,597
As was I.

292
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,635
So we both mourn.

293
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,873
You for what has passed and...

294
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,271
and I for what is to come.

295
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:02,270
What happened to them?

296
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,178
I gave an order
for them not to be touched.

297
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:11,714
They tried to flee, my king.

298
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,318
Seven of our best men
were killed in the struggle.

299
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:20,318
Seven of your best men killed by women?

300
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:25,496
I wish to know where
the Epirus Bow rests.

301
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,730
Which of you can tell me this?

302
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:37,498
Which of you are the true oracle?

303
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:46,784
If I'm forced to son you out
by other means

304
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:49,717
you will experience discomfort.

305
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:53,356
Discomfort unique to your gender.

306
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:58,522
So you tell me, which one of you is her?

307
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,062
I am the one you seek.

308
00:37:04,624 --> 00:37:05,932
No, it is I.

309
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:08,765
I am the one you seek.

310
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:14,543
The other one said the same thing.
They all claim to be the oracle.

311
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:15,976
The other one?

312
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:18,647
Yes, my king.

313
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,177
The other one? What other one?

314
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:22,981
There were four of them.

315
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:25,916
One of them escaped.

316
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:30,123
With a group of slaves
from the watering hole.

317
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,233
- Mondragon.
- Sire.

318
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,403
Find the one that escaped.

319
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:49,741
Bring her to me alive.

320
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,293
The dark seas.

321
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,996
These waters are thick with oil.

322
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:14,498
- And the boat?
- It's a Heraklion merchant ship.

323
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:17,939
Our best bet is to ambush it
and head south.

324
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:21,011
- South is not our journey
- It is for me.

325
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:25,914
From what I hear...

326
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:29,886
the women down there can get
to the meat of a Malaccan chestnut

327
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,455
with only their tongues.

328
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:38,222
Shall you and I test the limits
of that desire, my dear?

329
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:45,569
The gods have given me vision. Yet all
you do is dream of your appetites.

330
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:49,299
I'd rather follow my appetites
than the hallucinations of a harlot.

331
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:52,273
- She's a high priestess.
- It doesn't matter to me.

332
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,675
High priestess or whore,
I'm heading south.

333
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:03,212
Was it something I said?

334
00:39:04,711 --> 00:39:07,191
Well, friend, what will it be?

335
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:11,924
South with me, or will you follow...

336
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:15,130
the lady?

337
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:17,097
Neither.

338
00:39:19,893 --> 00:39:23,807
I'm taking that ship north,
to Hyperion's camp at the monastery.

339
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:29,973
Your savior sounds a lot
like a madman to me, Your Highness.

340
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:36,644
Personally, I'd rather fight
with a madman than against one.

341
00:40:08,174 --> 00:40:09,551
Are you minding this?

342
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,618
That is the mortal
your father so extols, is it not?

343
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:24,932
And he is with the oracle.

344
00:40:25,058 --> 00:40:29,302
Poseidon, if Zeus were to suspect you,
we will come to your defense.

345
00:40:46,646 --> 00:40:47,647
The rear!

346
00:40:50,884 --> 00:40:52,488
I thought you said
this was a merchant ship!

347
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:55,695
I guess I was wrong.

348
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:58,894
The sea has forever been
an unpredictable domain.

349
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:23,393
When the cloudless skies thunder...
stand fast.

350
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:27,622
- We gotta jump now!
- Stand fast!

351
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:52,841
You knew that wave would save us.

352
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:02,089
What I see is only a glimmer
of what may come to pass.

353
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,654
Your actions and desires
shape what lies ahead.

354
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:11,558
What else have you seen?

355
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:20,004
A body wrapped in a shroud on a rock.

356
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,172
You holding the Epirus Bow...

357
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,250
and...

358
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:33,214
embracing Hyperion. Impossible.

359
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:35,826
I would never embrace Hyperion.

360
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,193
He killed my mother.

361
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:41,159
Your mother.

362
00:43:42,522 --> 00:43:44,593
Was she given a proper burial?

363
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:48,699
No.

364
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:52,441
She still lies
where Hyperion cut her down.

365
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:57,346
Then you must bury your mother.
Her faith demands it.

366
00:43:58,104 --> 00:43:59,674
I do not believe in the gods.

367
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:01,684
But she believed.

368
00:44:03,443 --> 00:44:06,287
She believed, Theseus.

369
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:09,224
You must return to your village.

370
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:33,342
Have you found the oracle?

371
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:37,319
We did, my Lord, but our men were lost
before we could recover her.

372
00:44:37,443 --> 00:44:39,582
A storm swept them to sea.

373
00:44:41,047 --> 00:44:42,390
And the oracle.

374
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:45,655
Did she survive?

375
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:48,493
She travels towards Kolpos
with the slaves.

376
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:50,990
She could be leading them to the Bow.

377
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:56,164
Mm.

378
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:03,672
Send the Beast to Kolpos
We will go to Tartarus.

379
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:06,442
- Mondragon?
- Sire.

380
00:45:07,106 --> 00:45:11,816
You stay here...
and set an ambush in the pit.

381
00:46:42,235 --> 00:46:44,374
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you, Mother.

382
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:52,923
But I promise you our family name
will not die with me.

383
00:51:48,874 --> 00:51:51,354
<i>Hyperion's legions
are gathering at Tartarus.</i>

384
00:51:52,678 --> 00:51:54,589
That's where Hellenes will fall.

385
00:51:55,948 --> 00:51:57,359
That future is not set.

386
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:02,396
But likely. It will be a slaughter.

387
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:06,893
- You have no faith.
- Heathens.

388
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:12,500
That is true, Dareios, but not always.

389
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:17,809
When I was just a boy,
I prayed to the gods... for a horse.

390
00:52:17,937 --> 00:52:22,579
The gods never answered me,
so I stole one instead.

391
00:52:27,913 --> 00:52:29,824
We're surrounded by heathens.

392
00:54:10,182 --> 00:54:13,356
It's all right. It's all right, Theseus.

393
00:54:15,621 --> 00:54:17,294
What happened to me?

394
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:20,336
Your arm. You were poisoned.

395
00:54:26,532 --> 00:54:28,136
Where are the others?

396
00:54:29,135 --> 00:54:31,809
They're putting Dareios' body to rest.

397
00:54:50,756 --> 00:54:52,099
She was right.

398
00:54:56,128 --> 00:54:58,074
For all those years, I doubted her.

399
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:04,003
Doubted their existence.

400
00:55:06,071 --> 00:55:09,052
Your mother's death
was not in vain, Theseus.

401
00:55:11,377 --> 00:55:15,587
It was fate that brought you back.
For the Bow.

402
00:55:20,019 --> 00:55:22,590
And in your hands, Theseus...

403
00:55:24,056 --> 00:55:26,161
it will bring Hellenes victory.

404
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:07,635
You were right, Theseus.
My visions are a curse.

405
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,166
I want to see the world
through my own eyes.

406
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:15,268
And feel with my own heart.

407
00:57:15,901 --> 00:57:17,972
And touch with my own flesh.

408
00:57:34,753 --> 00:57:38,633
Hey, monk, I did a little shopping
last night. Good weapon, huh?

409
00:57:52,705 --> 00:57:54,548
Good to you see you're still alive.

410
00:57:55,074 --> 00:57:57,645
I was worried that cow
had gotten the best of you.

411
00:57:58,377 --> 00:58:01,449
It almost did. She saved my life.

412
00:58:04,149 --> 00:58:05,719
Looks like she did more than that.

413
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:11,156
Careful.

414
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:15,569
Just because you have that bow doesn't
mean I'm going to treat you differently.

415
00:58:16,228 --> 00:58:18,868
Good. We march to the monastery.

416
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,443
We have a war to fight.

417
00:58:26,939 --> 00:58:31,513
The faithful believe the Titans
are still buried deep within the mountain.

418
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:41,729
The Great Wall is the Hellenics'
only hope against your army.

419
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:50,200
Defenses?

420
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:54,835
Originally it was a dam,
but the Hellenics have since adapted it.

421
00:58:57,169 --> 00:59:00,844
No one could have anticipated the enemy
you have become.

422
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,083
How many are there?

423
00:59:03,742 --> 00:59:06,780
How many have made it here,
Your Majesty, I'm not sure.

424
00:59:06,945 --> 00:59:08,117
How many?

425
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:10,554
I'm not sure, Your Majesty.

426
00:59:12,885 --> 00:59:15,764
- Eight hundred.
- And the gate?

427
00:59:15,888 --> 00:59:20,268
Twenty feet of marble stone,
weighing over 12 tons.

428
00:59:20,392 --> 00:59:23,635
It was designed to be impenetrable,
Your Majesty.

429
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:31,245
Have you ever known of a gate
designed to be anything but?

430
00:59:41,747 --> 00:59:43,556
Go be of service somewhere else

431
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,639
Where is he? I thought Hyperion
was supposed to be camped here.

432
01:00:05,771 --> 01:00:10,584
We should continue. Tartarus is another
two days along this ridge.

433
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,253
What is that sound?

434
01:00:43,909 --> 01:00:46,389
Stay down, monk! Stavros, help me!

435
01:00:47,412 --> 01:00:48,891
Help me keep him down!

436
01:00:52,451 --> 01:00:54,692
No! No!

437
01:00:56,221 --> 01:00:59,896
My sisters! My sisters!

438
01:01:00,692 --> 01:01:02,228
They're in the bull!

439
01:01:08,867 --> 01:01:09,868
No!

440
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:26,756
- I am the true oracle.
- It's me, Phaedra!

441
01:01:26,885 --> 01:01:28,364
I am the oracle.

442
01:01:31,523 --> 01:01:32,593
Theseus.

443
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:34,735
They're still here.

444
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:42,504
Wait, monk!

445
01:01:44,636 --> 01:01:45,979
It's a trap!

446
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,097
Monk!

447
01:02:20,172 --> 01:02:21,480
Theseus.

448
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,897
Do not stop until you reach Tartarus

449
01:03:10,026 --> 01:03:12,199
The horses will run
until their hearts give out.

450
01:03:12,328 --> 01:03:15,434
Hyperion will soon have the Bow. Leave.

451
01:03:42,058 --> 01:03:44,834
Forgive me, Father. Forgive me.

452
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:49,067
I only broke the law
to protect the mortal.

453
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,614
No god will ever again come to your aid.

454
01:04:34,944 --> 01:04:36,617
You are on your own!

455
01:04:39,249 --> 01:04:41,923
Do you understand, mortal?

456
01:04:43,086 --> 01:04:45,532
I have faith in you, Theseus.

457
01:04:46,256 --> 01:04:50,170
Prove me right.

458
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,296
Lead your people.

459
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:35,474
Halt!

460
01:05:52,622 --> 01:05:54,602
The horse I prayed for when I was a boy.

461
01:05:55,258 --> 01:05:56,430
What is wrong with him?

462
01:05:59,228 --> 01:06:00,332
They're dying.

463
01:06:22,185 --> 01:06:24,256
Where are the men?

464
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:26,458
They have yet to return, sire.

465
01:06:27,323 --> 01:06:29,667
What does the sight
of the bird tell you?

466
01:06:32,895 --> 01:06:33,896
Speak.

467
01:06:36,766 --> 01:06:37,904
The gods.

468
01:06:40,303 --> 01:06:42,112
They came from above.

469
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:44,184
The gods?

470
01:06:44,307 --> 01:06:46,947
They appeared and laid waste
to the men, my king.

471
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:50,953
The gods.

472
01:06:53,816 --> 01:06:55,056
The gods.

473
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:59,191
They protected the slave
who travels with the oracle.

474
01:07:02,759 --> 01:07:05,569
The gods fight on their behalf, sire.

475
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,403
If the men hear of this,
there will be panic.

476
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:17,346
I know. I know.

477
01:08:05,555 --> 01:08:08,695
In peace, sons bury their fathers.

478
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:13,606
In war, fathers bury their sons.

479
01:08:21,404 --> 01:08:23,213
Are we at war, Father?

480
01:09:04,413 --> 01:09:06,359
I have important information
for the council.

481
01:09:06,482 --> 01:09:07,654
Theseus.

482
01:09:08,284 --> 01:09:09,991
I know this man. Let him through.

483
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,002
I hope you've come to join the fight.

484
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,483
Where's the army?

485
01:09:42,485 --> 01:09:44,226
Tell me about the slave.

486
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,563
He's from your village, is he not?

487
01:09:51,427 --> 01:09:53,236
- Answer me!
- Yes.

488
01:09:54,764 --> 01:09:56,607
He was a peasant.

489
01:10:00,903 --> 01:10:02,678
As was I.

490
01:10:03,673 --> 01:10:05,653
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

491
01:10:05,775 --> 01:10:08,016
- I meant no...
- Quiet.

492
01:10:08,144 --> 01:10:10,522
And his family?

493
01:10:10,646 --> 01:10:15,061
His mother was raped by some villagers.
Nobody would many her.

494
01:10:17,687 --> 01:10:19,132
He was a bastard.

495
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:24,969
And his name?

496
01:10:25,828 --> 01:10:26,932
Theseus.

497
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:30,137
Very well. I'll meet him.

498
01:10:40,543 --> 01:10:43,524
Helios tells me you have information
that could be of use to us.

499
01:10:43,646 --> 01:10:45,922
Hyperion is in possession
of the Epirus Bow.

500
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:49,930
- The Epirus Bow?
- Yes, it's a weapon forged by Heracles.

501
01:10:50,086 --> 01:10:52,760
Oh, please. I heard the same stories
you did as a child.

502
01:10:52,889 --> 01:10:57,235
There are gods living in the clouds.
Titans buried in the rocks.

503
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:02,332
Listen, I was a disbeliever just like
you are. But the Epirus Bow exists

504
01:11:02,465 --> 01:11:07,710
I understand there are many Hellenics
who put faith in the myths and the gods,

505
01:11:07,837 --> 01:11:10,579
but we on the Hellenic council do not.

506
01:11:10,706 --> 01:11:13,585
They are metaphors, son. Nothing more.

507
01:11:13,709 --> 01:11:17,623
We are a society of laws
based on negotiation and reason.

508
01:11:17,747 --> 01:11:21,058
If you try and negotiate with Hyperion,
you will be the death of us all.

509
01:11:21,183 --> 01:11:24,164
If I were to accept your counsel,

510
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:26,927
Theseus from Kolpos, what would it be?

511
01:11:27,056 --> 01:11:29,593
Seal the gates and prepare for war.

512
01:11:29,725 --> 01:11:31,898
We have Hoplite battalions returning.
We can't seal the gate.

513
01:11:32,028 --> 01:11:35,942
No one will return! We are the last!

514
01:11:36,065 --> 01:11:38,443
I'm sure you'll understand
if I don't accept the advice

515
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:41,912
of an alluring palm reader
and her peasant lover.

516
01:11:43,572 --> 01:11:45,745
Sir, a Heraklion envoy approaches.

517
01:11:49,278 --> 01:11:53,556
There, you see? No ruler wishes for war.

518
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:57,631
They only wish to be taken seriously
at the bargaining table.

519
01:11:58,454 --> 01:12:00,866
Alert the council. Prepare a delegation.

520
01:12:05,127 --> 01:12:06,197
Bows!

521
01:12:10,433 --> 01:12:11,434
Stop!

522
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:18,985
Stop! Remain still,
or we'll be forced to fire upon you.

523
01:12:23,179 --> 01:12:24,920
Extend your arms outward.

524
01:12:28,784 --> 01:12:30,786
He bears the olive branch of peace.

525
01:12:32,121 --> 01:12:36,797
My king wishes to speak
to the one called Theseus from Kolpos.

526
01:12:41,097 --> 01:12:42,440
Theseus.

527
01:12:44,934 --> 01:12:47,505
Hyperion's envoy
desires a word with you.

528
01:12:48,971 --> 01:12:52,817
Like the vision,
he sends for you with arms open.

529
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:56,415
Seeking an embrace of loyalty.

530
01:12:56,545 --> 01:12:58,218
Phaedra.

531
01:12:59,448 --> 01:13:01,155
Have you never been wrong?

532
01:13:14,463 --> 01:13:16,170
We can't protect you beyond this gate.

533
01:13:23,305 --> 01:13:24,943
I am Theseus!

534
01:13:25,474 --> 01:13:28,478
Come closer. I have a message for you.

535
01:13:29,412 --> 01:13:30,482
Don't risk it.

536
01:13:35,284 --> 01:13:36,888
At worst, you lose a peasant.

537
01:13:47,163 --> 01:13:49,769
- Better?
- Uh-huh. Yes.

538
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,380
Why do you cover your face?

539
01:13:53,502 --> 01:13:56,244
All are equal in Hyperion's midst.

540
01:13:56,372 --> 01:13:59,683
I myself am only a vessel
for his demands. Nothing more.

541
01:14:00,776 --> 01:14:04,246
- And he asks me by name?
- Indeed he does.

542
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,791
And how does he know it?

543
01:14:05,915 --> 01:14:08,657
There's little the king does not know.

544
01:14:08,784 --> 01:14:10,991
He knows that you have no father.

545
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,397
And like him, you were cast aside
by your own people.

546
01:14:14,523 --> 01:14:16,196
Does he know of my rage?

547
01:14:17,626 --> 01:14:21,039
Does he know that I live only to see
his blood at the end of my sword?

548
01:14:21,163 --> 01:14:23,200
Does he know he butchered my mother?

549
01:14:31,373 --> 01:14:35,480
Now that he's seen your face, he knows.

550
01:14:44,854 --> 01:14:46,197
You wouldn't make it.

551
01:14:47,456 --> 01:14:48,935
Coward!

552
01:14:49,058 --> 01:14:50,867
Embrace me, Theseus.

553
01:14:51,994 --> 01:14:55,066
They will never give you a seat
at their table

554
01:14:55,197 --> 01:14:56,972
but you could sit at the head of mine.

555
01:14:58,367 --> 01:15:03,612
Long after this war is over, my mark
will be left on this world forever.

556
01:15:06,175 --> 01:15:09,850
The sun will never set
on my blood, Theseus.

557
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:13,654
This is what I offer you. Immortality.

558
01:15:14,817 --> 01:15:18,060
Deeds are eternal. Not the flesh.

559
01:15:22,858 --> 01:15:26,032
The gods may be on your side,
but tomorrow...

560
01:15:27,363 --> 01:15:29,070
I unleash the Titans.

561
01:15:33,736 --> 01:15:35,238
What was discussed?

562
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:38,115
Seal the gate.

563
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,346
- What were his demands?
- Seal the gate.

564
01:15:42,511 --> 01:15:44,115
Theseus.

565
01:15:46,582 --> 01:15:48,391
Ahh...

566
01:16:10,539 --> 01:16:13,679
- That was him, wasn't it?
- I was that close.

567
01:16:45,608 --> 01:16:48,487
I don't know if I can do
what Zeus asks of me.

568
01:16:52,181 --> 01:16:54,559
By doubting one
comes the truth, Theseus.

569
01:16:59,321 --> 01:17:00,800
The gods chose well.

570
01:18:49,398 --> 01:18:52,504
Sir, there's movement on the front.

571
01:19:16,225 --> 01:19:17,898
What is he holding?

572
01:19:21,163 --> 01:19:22,198
The Bow.

573
01:19:39,214 --> 01:19:42,354
The commanders
are all dead! Fall back!

574
01:19:49,358 --> 01:19:51,269
Hold! Stand your ground!

575
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:54,272
Hold! Stand your ground!

576
01:20:06,975 --> 01:20:08,318
Listen to me!

577
01:20:11,814 --> 01:20:12,986
Listen!

578
01:20:16,385 --> 01:20:20,492
- Who are you to tell us what to do?
- I am nobody to tell you what to do!

579
01:20:20,622 --> 01:20:24,035
I am Theseus, a common man! One of you!

580
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:27,663
I share your blood!
And I share your fear!

581
01:20:28,564 --> 01:20:33,707
But to run now would offer our souls
and the souls of our children

582
01:20:33,836 --> 01:20:35,543
to a terrible darkness!

583
01:20:45,314 --> 01:20:48,158
Hold! We must stand and fight!

584
01:20:48,684 --> 01:20:52,496
Their numbers count for nothing
in the tunnel! Stand your ground!

585
01:20:54,823 --> 01:20:58,066
Stand your ground!
Who are they that we are not?

586
01:21:00,729 --> 01:21:04,199
Just because they scald their faces
and scar their bodies...

587
01:21:04,967 --> 01:21:08,505
does not mean they are braver
or stronger than we are.

588
01:21:09,204 --> 01:21:10,478
They are cowards!

589
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,842
They hide behind their masks.

590
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:17,319
They are human,
and they bleed like you and I.

591
01:21:23,685 --> 01:21:25,028
Listen to me!

592
01:21:26,121 --> 01:21:27,566
Stand your ground!

593
01:21:28,423 --> 01:21:30,300
Fight for honor!

594
01:21:30,425 --> 01:21:32,166
Fight for the man beside you!

595
01:21:32,294 --> 01:21:34,604
Fight for the mothers who bore you!

596
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:36,300
Fight for your children!

597
01:21:36,431 --> 01:21:37,876
Fight for your future!

598
01:21:38,567 --> 01:21:40,103
Fight so your name survives!

599
01:21:41,603 --> 01:21:42,581
Fight...

600
01:21:43,539 --> 01:21:45,485
for immortality!

601
01:21:52,548 --> 01:21:55,586
Let us write history
with Heraklion blood!

602
01:22:03,592 --> 01:22:06,300
Ready! Move!

603
01:23:29,778 --> 01:23:31,553
King Hyperion.

604
01:23:32,981 --> 01:23:36,326
We can negotiate. I see no reason...

605
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:48,563
Theseus!

606
01:23:49,665 --> 01:23:53,010
Here I am! Theseus of Kolpos!

607
01:23:56,705 --> 01:23:58,912
- Where's your king?
- He is no king.

608
01:24:20,796 --> 01:24:22,002
Stavros! The shrine!

609
01:24:46,054 --> 01:24:48,193
Theseus! I'm right behind you!

610
01:25:05,474 --> 01:25:06,817
Phaedra!

611
01:25:09,778 --> 01:25:11,485
Phaedra!

612
01:25:11,613 --> 01:25:12,956
Stay in the shrine.

613
01:25:45,013 --> 01:25:46,185
Hyperion!

614
01:25:58,293 --> 01:25:59,397
No!

615
01:26:23,218 --> 01:26:24,561
Theseus, wake up!

616
01:26:30,325 --> 01:26:31,633
Theseus!

617
01:26:35,197 --> 01:26:36,505
Theseus!

618
01:26:57,352 --> 01:26:58,626
Theseus!

619
01:27:00,188 --> 01:27:01,531
I got the Bow!

620
01:27:02,424 --> 01:27:03,903
Stavros.

621
01:27:05,627 --> 01:27:08,369
I got the Bow.
Get out of here while you can!

622
01:27:10,365 --> 01:27:11,435
I'll hold them off!

623
01:27:11,566 --> 01:27:12,772
Stavros.

624
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:15,973
Go now! I got the Bow!

625
01:27:16,104 --> 01:27:17,606
I'll hold them off while I can!

626
01:27:17,739 --> 01:27:20,743
Get out of here! Go!

627
01:27:25,814 --> 01:27:27,953
Which one of you are coming with me?

628
01:27:58,146 --> 01:28:00,592
None of you will leave this place.

629
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:16,670
Leave here!

630
01:28:17,866 --> 01:28:19,812
This is no longer your fight.

631
01:28:22,037 --> 01:28:23,380
Find Hyperion.

632
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:01,507
Die with your gods.

633
01:32:18,873 --> 01:32:20,318
Athena!

634
01:32:50,071 --> 01:32:51,209
Father!

635
01:32:54,342 --> 01:32:56,185
Don't forsake mankind.

636
01:34:19,427 --> 01:34:21,373
What does it feel like, knowing...

637
01:34:23,398 --> 01:34:25,776
knowing that there'll
be no memory of you?

638
01:34:27,902 --> 01:34:29,245
I have won.

639
01:34:31,472 --> 01:34:34,942
My death will make me a legend.

640
01:34:44,152 --> 01:34:45,495
My deeds...

641
01:34:47,689 --> 01:34:49,965
will go down in history.

642
01:34:56,497 --> 01:34:58,477
I'm writing your history.

643
01:35:25,293 --> 01:35:27,068
Do it!

644
01:35:44,145 --> 01:35:49,857
This... is our last embrace, Hyperion.

645
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:53,287
Look at me.

646
01:35:55,256 --> 01:35:56,735
Look at me.

647
01:35:59,193 --> 01:36:00,365
I'm the last thing...

648
01:36:01,996 --> 01:36:03,407
you will ever see.

649
01:36:07,735 --> 01:36:11,205
Witness hell.

650
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:36,855
<i>All men's
souls are immortal.</i>

651
01:38:39,987 --> 01:38:45,994
<i>But the souls of the righteous
are immortal and divine.</i>

652
01:38:50,464 --> 01:38:53,240
<i>Once a faithless man,</i>

653
01:38:53,367 --> 01:38:57,782
<i>Theseus gave his life
to save mankind</i>

654
01:38:57,905 --> 01:39:00,283
<i>and earned a place amongst the gods.</i>

655
01:39:03,544 --> 01:39:06,923
<i>They rewarded his
bravery with a gift.</i>

656
01:39:07,048 --> 01:39:10,393
<i>A son. Acamas.</i>

657
01:39:42,049 --> 01:39:45,053
Don't be afraid of your visions,
little one.

658
01:39:46,854 --> 01:39:49,198
- What's your name?
- Acamas.

659
01:39:49,824 --> 01:39:51,565
Acamas.

660
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,840
A strong name.

661
01:39:57,798 --> 01:40:02,372
I knew your father.
He was a very brave man.

662
01:40:06,107 --> 01:40:10,055
Soon, it will be your time

663
01:40:11,879 --> 01:40:13,483
My time for what?

664
01:40:13,614 --> 01:40:16,527
The fight against evil
never ends, Acamas.

665
01:40:16,651 --> 01:40:19,461
War is coming to the heavens.

666
01:40:20,855 --> 01:40:26,032
And your father will be there,
fighting for your future.

667
01:40:28,996 --> 01:40:29,997
Acamas.

668
01:40:30,665 --> 01:40:31,735
Acamas.

669
01:40:40,074 --> 01:40:41,553
Who was that, son?

670
01:40:42,243 --> 01:40:43,278
Just...

671
01:40:45,946 --> 01:40:47,448
Just an old man.
