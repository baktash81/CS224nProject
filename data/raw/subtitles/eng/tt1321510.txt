324
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,858
- What?
- Yo! Look who's home!

325
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:35,442
Look at you!
Why are you taller than me?

326
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:38,150
I know, my man grew a couple
inches, he think he a man.

327
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,150
- Man, shut up.
- I see you.

328
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:43,567
Listen, you down to march next
week?

329
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,983
Like we used to?

330
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,192
What's the cause?

331
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,358
They're talking about kicking
out all the DREAMers.

332
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:52,400
It's time to make some noise.
You want to come?

333
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:54,733
I know that voice!

334
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:58,567
Woo-hoo!

335
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,525
- Count me in.
- Yo. Later.

336
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,525
- Well, you do good? You done?
- Yeah.

337
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:08,108
- My man, who's watching the store?
- What?

338
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:09,900
- Yo!
- Shit!

339
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:12,192
Pete! You can't just take that!

340
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,525
Bro! Get back here, man!

341
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:17,733
That's on your tab, bro!
Both of y'all.

342
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,858
Oh, yes.

343
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,150
Hand-embroidered
by your mother.

344
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:33,817
May she rest in peace.

345
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,108
We'll use them for the party.

346
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:37,192
They're beautiful.

347
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:41,817
<i>Abuela Claudia never had kids,</i>

348
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,942
<i>so she adopted the whole
block as her own.</i>

349
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,650
<i>Adopted our</i> sueñitos <i>, too.</i>

350
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:55,775
When I got to Stanford...

351
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:57,775
...the isolation, Abuela.

352
00:18:57,858 --> 00:18:59,567
The loneliness.

353
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,775
I was, like, "What am I doing
here?"

354
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:06,650
<i>Mira</i>, when
my <i>mamá</i> came from Cuba...

355
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:09,650
Ay, <i>Dios mío.</i>

356
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:15,942
She felt like one tiny grain of sand
from the beaches we left behind.

357
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,442
What did she do?

358
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:26,275
She bought a winter coat
and a pair of velvet gloves.

359
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:29,233
Her hands were cracked
from the cleaning fluids.

360
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:30,775
But the gloves hid that.

361
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:34,817
We had to assert our dignity in
small ways.

362
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,275
That's why these napkins are
beautiful.

363
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:42,983
That's why my mother's gloves
were beautiful.

364
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:47,942
Little details that tell the
world, we are not invisible.

it's no joke, Pop.

434
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:08,692
Yeah, when I left, y'all were,
like,

435
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:13,108
"It's gonna be great. Go show
'em who we are. Go represent."

436
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:16,025
The truth is...

437
00:24:16,108 --> 00:24:19,983
is that most of the time I'm at
Stanford feels like a betrayal.

438
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,942
<i>De verdad?</i> Of who?

439
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:24,733
Of my family.

440
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:26,192
My community.

441
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:29,108
Like the dean, he invited me
to this diversity dinner.

442
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:32,358
Super-wealthy donors, trustees,
the whole nine.

443
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:35,608
And I wore this black cocktail
dress and I was walking to my seat,

444
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:39,900
and one of the patrons shoved
her plate into my arms

445
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:42,942
and said, "I ordered the
vegetarian option."

446
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,608
- No.
- Yeah.

447
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,733
And all the servers, all
Latino, shot me this look,

448
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:50,608
like, "Ooh, what's this
<i>trigueña</i> gonna do?"

449
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:55,483
"Ooh, what's she gon' do?
Is she with us? Or is she with them?"

450
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:59,150
<i>Ah, bueno.</i> There's no
shame in waiting tables.

451
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,025
And there's no shame
in having a different path.

452
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:03,233
Like you.

453
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:10,692
Dad... the deadline passed.

454
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,108
The extension
on spring tuition.

455
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:16,317
- Yeah.
- But I didn't receive notice.

456
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,150
Yeah, they let me finish off my
classes, but we owe them.

457
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:21,400
No, don't you give it a second
thought. I'm on it. Hm?

458
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:23,108
Dad...

459
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:26,317
The deadline to pay and enroll
for next semester also passed.

460
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:29,942
How come you know
about all this before I do?

461
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:33,733
I switched the info.
I gave the finance office my dorm address.

462
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:37,317
Well, why would you do that?

463
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,733
Because you sold half the business,
and it barely covered freshman year.

464
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:41,525
I don't want you doing
something else crazy.

465
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:45,108
- <i>Espera</i>, that sale pulled us out of debt.
- No, no.

466
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:48,525
You and I both know that finances
were tenuous before getting into this.

467
00:25:48,608 --> 00:25:49,942
And this might not be feasible.

468
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,942
- I'm gonna call them right now.
- Dad, Stanford's over.

469
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:54,192
Stop overreacting,
Nina, please.

470
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:56,233
- Dad, I'm serious.
- <i>Oye!</i>

471
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:05,942
You don't tell me how much we
can afford.

472
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:13,650
You're not the parent. Hm?

473
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:18,275
God bless you. <i>Dios te bendiga.</i>

474
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:19,942
<i>Gracias!</i>

475
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,400
What's all over those pipes?

476
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:34,650
- Rust.
- Rust?

477
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,025
Lovely.

478
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:40,483
That's the roof.

479
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:42,192
On the floor?

480
00:26:43,108 --> 00:26:45,275

00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:47,775

482
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:51,233

in the Dominican Republic?

483
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:52,900
Just like my <i>mamá.</i>

484
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:57,567
Morning and night, year after
year... to what end?

485
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,525
To wake up and scrub another
floor till the day she died.

486
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:06,483
Yeah, but... here I work to
survive.

487
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:09,442
<i>El Sueñito</i> will be a
labor of love.

488
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:11,442
The <i>bodega</i> was only supposed
to be temporary,

489
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,608
but now... I'm like, almost 30.

490
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:16,525
The plan was always to go back.

491
00:27:18,192 --> 00:27:20,317
Hopefully, I won't be going
alone.

492
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:22,983
You, me and Sonny?

493
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:25,650
<i>Y Sonny?</i> Is he on board?

494
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:27,775
He's my next ask.

495
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:28,775
I'm not going without him.

496
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:32,150
Look, I got Sonny.

497
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,858
You know I can't go nowhere
without you.

498
00:27:37,608 --> 00:27:40,900
I took care of my community,
no?

499
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:42,817
Hell, yes!

500
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,608
<i>El Sueñito</i> 2.0.

501
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:48,692
The tropical air'll keep you
young, girl!

502
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:53,067
<i>Caramba</i>, buy me a bikini!

503
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,358
Let's go!

504
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:03,400
I don't know, man.
Leave Washington Heights?

505
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:05,608
I'd have to talk to my dad...

506
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:07,483
You're just a kid.

507
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,733
You don't even know. For real.

508
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:14,858
Dominican Republic's gonna blow
your mind.

509
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:16,692
Look...

510
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:20,983
You do you. It's all good.
But don't be roping me into your thing.

511
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,567
Yo...

512
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,817
Beach.

513
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,108
<i>Merengue</i>. <i>Carnaval.</i>

514
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:30,358
Summer all year 'round.

515
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,817
Who's gonna greet you in DR?

516
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,067
Some cousin you saw two
Christmases ago?

517
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,150
Best days of my life
were there.

518
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,775
That's the corniest thing I've
ever heard.

519
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:44,275
You came here when you was
eight.

520
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:48,358
You got... "island memories."

521
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:51,358
Not me. I was in Pampers
on that plane.

522
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:53,400
NYC's my spot.

523
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:58,358
I got my island, okay?
Go get yours.

524
00:28:58,442 --> 00:29:00,400
Don't forget how you got your
name.

525
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,275
- Yo...
- Just, fix the fridge.

526
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:09,275
Yeah, all right.
Bro, you think you're funny?

527
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:10,858
What's "Usnavi" mean, anyway?

528
00:29:10,942 --> 00:29:12,400
That sounds weird.

529
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:14,067
No, it doesn't.

530
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,067
- All right. All right, all right, all right.
- Shut up.

531
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,983
On my dad's first trip to
<i>Nueva York...</i>

532
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:20,900
<i>he saw a passing ship on
the horizon.</i>

533
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:26,442
And... he was, like, "Wow,
that's gonna be my son's name."

534
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:31,483
- Usnavi!
- Ohh...

535
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,233
Usnavi...

536
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:34,608
I like it.

537
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:36,900
Thank you.

538
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:49,233
- <i>Hi, Mr. Rosario?</i>
- Yes, yes, I'm here.

539
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:52,150
<i>Yes, I'm not sure the information
you received was correct.</i>

540
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:57,358
<i>In actuality, we're still accepting
tuition payments up until June.</i>

541
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,442
So the deadline hasn't passed?

542
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:03,067
<i>No, it has not passed. Would you
like to know the remaining balance?</i>

543
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,067
Yes. I have a pencil.

544
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,567
<i>Sure, the balance that's due
for the fall semester...</i>

545
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:19,108
<i>Now, remember,
the block was disappearing.</i>

546
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,608
<i>Exhibit A: Daniela's salon.</i>

547
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:24,733
<i>Moving in a week, after
decades of makeovers,</i>

548
00:30:24,817 --> 00:30:27,775
<i>the skin-deep kind
and the emotional kind.</i>

549
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:29,150
<i>No one could fill her shoes.</i>

550
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:32,025
<i>Literally, they were like
four inches high.</i>

551
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:33,442
He doesn't have an apartment.
He doesn't pay rent anywhere.

552
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:36,233
He's bouncing between
two girls' houses.

553
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:38,942
- Of course he is.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

554
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:41,567
You know what?
It's mad we allow ourselves to be hurt.

555
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,775
- We need to have a better standard.
- That's what I'm saying.

556
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:46,858
<i>Tres paradas...</i>
pickety, packety, poom,

557
00:30:46,942 --> 00:30:50,483
and you're at the new spot.

558
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:54,733
I'm too old,
and the Bronx is too far.

559
00:30:54,817 --> 00:30:57,567
<i>Que voy a hacer?</i>
I was priced out.

560
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,858
Most of my clients already up
and moved to the Grand Concourse.

561
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,317
Hey, built in customers.

562
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,608
My lunch break isn't long
enough for that trip, Dani.

563
00:31:06,692 --> 00:31:08,900
Jessica...

564
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:11,483
One: swipe the fare card.

565
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:13,692
Two: ride three stops.

566
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:15,733
Three: arrive at my new
location.

567
00:31:15,817 --> 00:31:17,483
Ten minutes max.

568
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:19,233
Ten minutes? <i>Cariño.</i>

569
00:31:19,317 --> 00:31:20,858
What are you riding, a time
machine?

570
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:23,358
Excuse me?

571
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:25,192
No, she didn't, right?

572
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:28,525
Our people survived slave ships.

573
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:32,025
We survived <i>Taino</i> genocide.

574
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:36,025
- We survived <i>conquistadores</i> and dictators.
- <i>Si.</i>

575
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:40,983
You're telling me we can't survive
the D Train to the Grand Concourse?

576
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:45,317
Okay, okay, okay.

577
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,983
And who cuts your hair better
than me?

578
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:52,692

I e-mailed you a few days ago,
but I brought an extra copy.

667
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:58,400
Here, just in case.
Sorry, here.

668
00:36:59,108 --> 00:37:00,525
Ah, Miss Morales.

669
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:02,692
- Yeah... yes.
- Right.

670
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:06,067
I'm sorry, honey. I meant to
call you.

671
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:09,192
Oh... Uh, I got bank checks.

672
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:12,358
First month, last month and
security. Good as cash.

673
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:17,525
It's just without a solid credit
check, there's not much I can do.

674
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:19,358
Maybe your parents could
co-sign.

675
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:22,525
Assuming they can prove income
40 times the rent.

676

five. I'll see what I can do.

- Hi.

678
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:29,525

- So good to see you.

679
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:31,442
- Thanks for having us.

Are we popping champagne?

685
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:47,067

this, and was, like... "No."

Well, nope on her.

690
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:08,942

692
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,733

696
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:36,567
Stop.

697
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:51,400
Tell your cousin...
Fiesta in the Heights.

698

Thank you very much.

1076
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:17,608
Christmas, summers...

1077
01:00:17,692 --> 01:00:21,067
Just so that he doesn't go too
long without seeing you.

1078
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,067
And, you know, I know
you're his dad,

1079
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:26,525
and I'm just his big cousin,
but...

1080
01:00:26,608 --> 01:00:30,275

this could be good for him.

1081

1087
01:01:15,733 --> 01:01:18,900

1088
01:01:21,317 --> 01:01:22,900
I thought about it.

1089
01:01:24,525 --> 01:01:26,525
But, I can't.

1090
01:01:26,608 --> 01:01:29,150
The kid doesn't listen to shit I
say, anyway.

1091
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,775
- So is that a yes?
- Is it a yes?

1092
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:41,192

1095
01:01:47,983 --> 01:01:50,733
That kid does well in school,
he works hard.

1096
01:01:50,817 --> 01:01:52,317
And I could tell you.

1097
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,400
I'm with him every day.
Working in my store.

1098
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:58,025
I got that kid working to the
bone, but look, I'm...

1099
01:01:58,108 --> 01:02:01,692
He has an opportunity to have a
life that you and me didn't have.

1100
01:02:02,608 --> 01:02:04,108
Come on, <i>Tio.</i>

1101
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:09,025

1102
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:14,692
Cash.

1103
01:02:15,525 --> 01:02:17,233

me come in last minute.

1109

The check is cashed.

1110
01:02:52,358 --> 01:02:54,150

like, if I wanted to hold off

1111
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:58,192

before... before I go.

I'm sorry, you just...
You look amazing.

1142
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,150
- Thanks.
- My favorite color.

1143
01:05:55,525 --> 01:05:57,400
Well, I...

1144
01:05:57,483 --> 01:05:59,900
have a date tonight, so...

1145
01:06:02,233 --> 01:06:03,775
Word.

1146
01:06:03,858 --> 01:06:05,942
Right. That's right.

1147
01:06:06,025 --> 01:06:08,025
You have a date.

1148
01:06:08,108 --> 01:06:10,400
- I have a date, too.
- Oh, you do?

1149
01:06:10,483 --> 01:06:13,442
We. We have a date.

1150
01:06:13,525 --> 01:06:15,733
We have a date.
This is a date.

1151
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:20,608
Let me get you a drink.

1152
01:06:20,692 --> 01:06:23,525
Think fast.

1153
01:06:29,775 --> 01:06:32,483
All right, let's clean this up
before Abuela gets here.

1154
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:37,233

Wow.

1166
01:07:28,442 --> 01:07:30,858
You don't want any of it?
Oh, yeah, you're trying to be vegan, right?

1167
01:07:30,942 --> 01:07:33,692
Let me give you
a vegan <i>pastel.</i>

1168
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:52,608
Nina!
You got sauce on my sleeve!

1169
01:07:52,692 --> 01:07:56,733
Tsk.
Pass me a tissue or something.

1170
01:07:56,817 --> 01:07:58,775
No, I got you.

1171
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,692
- You're good.
- Wow.

1172
01:08:01,775 --> 01:08:02,692
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1173
01:08:02,775 --> 01:08:05,858
- <i>Mirenlo.</i>
- Now you know.

1174
01:08:05,942 --> 01:08:08,150
- Be generous.
- Yeah, we're gonna get it out.

1175
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:11,150
- Wow.
- You know what I'm sayin'.

1176
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,358
Nice.

1177
01:08:18,067 --> 01:08:19,567
I take note.

1178
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:27,817
You know, my first
business, I was, like, seven or eight.

1179
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,817
You know what?
Every time you tell the story,

1180
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,608
you're a different age, and you
get younger

1181
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,817
- and younger and younger.
- I was seven or eight...

1182
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,775
I took a rag and a coffee can,

1183
01:08:36,858 --> 01:08:41,025
I went to the <i>plaza</i> in Arecibo
to shine shoes for a nickel.

1184
01:08:41,108 --> 01:08:44,108
But every nickel went to shoe
polish, right?

1185
01:08:44,192 --> 01:08:46,150
Because the next time I could
charge a dime.

1186
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:49,275
- Wow, my man was a hustler.
- 'Cause you got that investment brain.

1187
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,692
- Hey, Benny!
- Hey, yo!

1188
01:08:51,775 --> 01:08:54,025
- The party's just starting, <i>siéntate.</i>
- Sorry, I'm late.

1189
01:08:54,108 --> 01:08:56,900
- Let me make you a plate.
- No, no, I'm not hungry.

1190
01:08:56,983 --> 01:08:58,317
Benny, not hungry?

1191
01:09:01,858 --> 01:09:05,983
Yo, Kevin, that meeting I
walked in on with you and Pike Phillips...

1192
01:09:06,067 --> 01:09:07,442
Is that what I thought it was?

1193
01:09:07,525 --> 01:09:09,817
'Cause, you know,
I keep playing it on loop, and...

1194
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,483
<i>Adios.</i> I was saving that
news for dessert.

1195
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:14,650
What news?

1196
01:09:17,067 --> 01:09:22,275
You know, when Pike originally
approached me, he wanted the whole space.

1197
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,483
So today, I reopened the
conversation.

1198
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:27,733
- What?
- I knew it.

1199
01:09:27,817 --> 01:09:30,150
I guess we're gonna do this
now, huh?

1200
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,608
Nina... it was about your age

1201
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:37,650
that your mother and I,
God rest her soul, we came here

1202
01:09:37,733 --> 01:09:40,900
and we emptied our savings to
put a down payment on Rosario's.

1203
01:09:40,983 --> 01:09:44,817
Two burgundy Cadillacs,
that was your fleet!

1204
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,775
Start small, dream big.

1205
01:09:48,608 --> 01:09:50,900
I look at you, <i>mija,</i>
I see her.

1206
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:53,900
<i>Y te lo juro</i>, if she were here, she would've
done the same thing that I did today.

1207
01:09:53,983 --> 01:09:55,483
Dad...

1208
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:56,733
I sold Rosario's.

1209
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:57,983
- <i>Felicidades!</i>
- What?

1210
01:09:58,067 --> 01:10:00,025
- Raise a glass.
- <i>Felicidades!</i>

1211
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:03,358
Yes, get cash money!

1212
01:10:03,442 --> 01:10:07,317
To Nina, who can now finish
what she started at Stanford.

1213
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,025
To Nina!

1214
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,775
- To Nina.
- To Nina.

1215
01:10:11,858 --> 01:10:14,233
Nina, say, "Thank you, <i>Papi."</i>

1216
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,525
Dad... the deadline passed.

1217
01:10:17,608 --> 01:10:20,150
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- <i>Mentira, mentira!</i>

1218
01:10:20,233 --> 01:10:22,442
Stop with the lying. I called
them.

1219
01:10:24,317 --> 01:10:26,858
I called them!
Stop trying to protect me here.

1220
01:10:26,942 --> 01:10:28,942
There were other things other
than the finances.

1221
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:30,358
Did you not hear what I said?

1222
01:10:30,442 --> 01:10:32,192
Yes, about the ignorant
<i>idiotas</i>...

1223
01:10:32,275 --> 01:10:34,192
That's the same thing that
we foresaw when we came!

1224
01:10:34,275 --> 01:10:35,567
No, it's not the same thing, Dad.

1225
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:37,525
It is not
the same.

1226
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:40,608
When you came here and Mom came
here, you all had a Latino community

1227
01:10:40,692 --> 01:10:43,525
ready to welcome you, open
arms, babies and <i>abuelas,</i>

1228
01:10:43,608 --> 01:10:46,942
and teachers and lawyers,
first generation, fifth generation...

1229
01:10:47,025 --> 01:10:49,192
There's no community for me at
school.

1230
01:10:53,442 --> 01:10:54,775
I got searched.

1231
01:10:58,567 --> 01:10:59,775
Yeah.

1232
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:02,150
I got searched.

1233
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,608
On moving day...

1234
01:11:08,483 --> 01:11:13,150
my roommate lost
her pearl necklace and...

1235
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:17,233
the RA and her parents
came in...

1236
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:21,567
and searched me and they...

1237
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:25,567
emptied my drawers,
turned over my purse...

1238
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,150
and I just stood there.

1239
01:11:28,233 --> 01:11:31,733
I stood there
and didn't say anything.

1240
01:11:31,817 --> 01:11:34,983
And then eventually,
they found it... in her bag.

1241
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:38,692
You're the best
we've got, Nina.

1242
01:11:38,775 --> 01:11:40,608
If you can't stay in the ring,
what's that gonna say about us?

1243
01:11:40,692 --> 01:11:42,942
You can't keep putting your
life's work on my shoulders, Dad.

1244
01:11:43,025 --> 01:11:45,067
<i>Dile, mi gente,</i>
isn't she the best we got?

1245
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:47,233
And then I apologize
like an idiot.

1246
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:48,525
I stood there,
I didn't do anything,

1247
01:11:48,608 --> 01:11:50,692
and then I apologized.

1248
01:11:50,775 --> 01:11:51,442
Well, you keep
getting A's, baby,

1249
01:11:51,525 --> 01:11:54,108
that's your revenge.

1250
01:11:54,192 --> 01:11:55,775
- My God, you're not hearing her, Kevin.
- I'm not going back!

1251
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:57,275
- <i>Como?</i>
- I'm not going back!

1252
01:11:57,358 --> 01:12:00,025
So all of my decisions
can just go to hell here?

1253
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:03,275
- I'm doing this for you!
- No, you're doing it for you!

1254
01:12:03,358 --> 01:12:05,150
What if I refuse your money?

1255
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:06,983
What if I don't want it?

1256
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,442
I refuse.

1257
01:12:29,067 --> 01:12:30,483
She refused.

1258
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,692

Hey, Pop.

1576
01:33:06,275 --> 01:33:08,483
Best days of my life.

1577
01:33:20,483 --> 01:33:22,275
It's creepy quiet.

1578
01:33:23,608 --> 01:33:26,442
Usually, the One Train's
up there, screeching.

1579
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:38,900
Yo, I was thinking...
there's so much stuff going on.

1580
01:33:38,983 --> 01:33:43,650
And all it just got me thinking about is,
like... all the people I care about the most.

1581
01:33:46,692 --> 01:33:47,983
And I just thought about you.

1582
01:33:53,442 --> 01:33:55,733
You're about
to change zip codes.

1583
01:33:55,817 --> 01:33:57,650
Country codes, actually.

1584
01:33:57,733 --> 01:34:01,233
Yeah, but
that's not till August.

1585
01:34:01,317 --> 01:34:03,608
I mean, you know, we got time.

1586
01:34:03,692 --> 01:34:05,233
Usnavi...

1587
01:34:08,192 --> 01:34:10,608
I'm the girl who paints nails.

1588
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:13,775
There's plenty like me,
here and over there.

1589
01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:15,942
Stop!

1590
01:34:16,025 --> 01:34:18,108
Yo, you're an artist.

1591
01:34:29,192 --> 01:34:31,567
Yo, your senior year
lab book...

1592
01:34:34,483 --> 01:34:37,400
I should've been paying
attention to the board, but...

1593
01:34:39,817 --> 01:34:42,442
all them doodles you made.

1594
01:34:42,525 --> 01:34:44,317
Yo, it was like...

1595
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,817
<i>Wonder Woman</i> meets...

1596
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:49,317
<i>The Simpsons</i> meets...

1597
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,150
<i>Guernica.</i>

1598
01:34:51,233 --> 01:34:53,317
And I would...

1599
01:34:54,233 --> 01:34:56,275
I would watch, like...

1600
01:34:57,983 --> 01:35:00,983
I just want to see the whole
world through her eyes.

1601
01:35:24,275 --> 01:35:26,483
<i>Mira para allá.</i>

1602
01:35:26,567 --> 01:35:30,233
Benny, you know,
before I bought Rosario's...

1603
01:35:30,317 --> 01:35:32,233
it was O'Hanrahan's.

1604
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:35,900
The whole block was Irish.

1605
01:35:39,942 --> 01:35:41,525
You know why I bought it?

1606
01:35:41,608 --> 01:35:46,025
My dad, he, uh... he pulled me
out of high school,

1607
01:35:46,108 --> 01:35:49,442
so that I could work on
the same farm as him.

1608
01:35:49,525 --> 01:35:51,858
Making the same pennies.

1609
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:55,067
I thought to myself,
"No, no, no, <i>papi."</i>

1610
01:35:55,150 --> 01:35:57,483
"That don't make no sense."

1611
01:35:57,567 --> 01:36:01,442
I'm gonna drop out so somebody
else could get rich off of my work?

1612
01:36:03,817 --> 01:36:05,483
So I came here.

1613
01:36:06,567 --> 01:36:09,442
So I could make
my own damn work.

1614
01:36:09,525 --> 01:36:13,358
But, you never
finished high school?

1615
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,150
But Nina did.

1616
01:36:40,025 --> 01:36:44,858
<i>You asked me,
"What a</i> sueñito <i>means?"</i>

1617
01:36:44,942 --> 01:36:46,442
I'm not gonna sit here
and give you

1618
01:36:46,525 --> 01:36:49,025
some fairy tale version.

1619
01:36:49,108 --> 01:36:54,400
You know, a dream isn't some
sparkly diamond we get.

1620
01:36:54,483 --> 01:36:59,233
You know, sometimes, it's...
it's rough.

1621
01:36:59,317 --> 01:37:01,025
And it's not so pretty.

1622
01:37:01,108 --> 01:37:05,275
Yeah!

1623
01:37:05,358 --> 01:37:08,858
DACA was not a gift
from some benevolent saint, right?

1624
01:37:08,942 --> 01:37:11,525
- No.
- No!

1625
01:37:11,608 --> 01:37:14,317
- You made it happen, you fought for it.
- Yes!

1626
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,900
And that's why
it still continues now.

1627
01:37:19,025 --> 01:37:22,483
'Cause what about the people who
don't qualify, like my niece, right?

1628
01:37:22,567 --> 01:37:26,400
She gets into college
without papers, but...

1629
01:37:26,483 --> 01:37:30,233
no work-study for her,
no federal aid for her

1630
01:37:30,317 --> 01:37:32,983
so she doesn't get to go to college.
It's not right.

1631
01:37:33,067 --> 01:37:37,400
- What did she say?
- She said her niece couldn't go to college.

1632
01:37:37,483 --> 01:37:41,483
We can dream
bigger and better, right?

1633
01:37:50,608 --> 01:37:51,942
Yo, Sonny!

1634
01:38:02,942 --> 01:38:04,775
What's going on man?

1635
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:08,567
Let's do this. Yes!

1636
01:38:10,275 --> 01:38:11,900
I knew I couldn't
get a license.

1637
01:38:13,858 --> 01:38:15,733
But no college?

1638
01:38:15,817 --> 01:38:18,358
She was talking
about undocumented folks.

1639
01:38:31,775 --> 01:38:35,692
<i>I remember when I was your age,
they used to say...</i>

1640
01:38:35,775 --> 01:38:40,358
<i>"If you work hard
and you live by the rules,</i>

1641
01:38:40,442 --> 01:38:44,192
the money will come,
the things will come.

1642
01:38:44,275 --> 01:38:46,900
And that, those things
will complete you."

1643
01:38:51,942 --> 01:38:53,442
But, they won't.

1644
01:38:56,983 --> 01:39:02,733
<i>We work so hard to try and get there,
that we forget about what's right here.</i>

1645
01:39:03,525 --> 01:39:05,983
I was gonna be like you.

1646
01:39:12,192 --> 01:39:13,817
Share your stories!

1647
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:17,567
Share your stories.
There's nothing to be ashamed of!

1648
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:20,275
Tell our stories!
Tell our stories!

1649
01:39:20,358 --> 01:39:22,983
Tell our stories!
Tell our stories!

1650
01:39:23,067 --> 01:39:25,983
Tell our stories!
Tell our stories!

1651
01:39:35,358 --> 01:39:37,942
Dad, I know what I have to do.

1652
01:39:38,025 --> 01:39:41,442
You've given me this amazing
education and I just need to use it,

1653
01:39:41,525 --> 01:39:45,650
and figure out how every
undocumented kid gets a pathway.

1654
01:39:47,525 --> 01:39:51,525
Maybe Stanford isn't a way out.
Maybe it's a way back.

1655
01:39:51,608 --> 01:39:53,983
Like Abuela
always used to say...

1656
01:39:54,067 --> 01:39:56,608
asserting our dignity
in small ways.

1657
01:40:07,025 --> 01:40:08,233
Wow.

1658
01:40:08,317 --> 01:40:10,650
This is it, huh, <i>mija?</i>

1659
01:40:11,608 --> 01:40:12,942
What?

1660
01:40:13,025 --> 01:40:14,525
This is the moment
when you do better than me.

1661
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:17,608
Not because of
some fancy degree...

1662
01:40:18,983 --> 01:40:21,442
It's 'cause you can
see a future that I can't.

1663
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,692
Hey...

1664
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,442
You're <i>Nuyoricua.</i>

1665
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:34,858
We're a people on the move,
so yeah, bring us with you.

1666
01:40:37,358 --> 01:40:39,775
Ignore anyone who doubts you.

1667
01:40:41,275 --> 01:40:45,567
You take all the bruises, baby,
but you stay in the ring.

1668
01:41:19,442 --> 01:41:21,608
<i>I called,
and it's still available.</i>

1669
01:41:21,692 --> 01:41:26,358
But Vanessa needs a co-signer, and not
one who's about to leave the country.

1670
01:41:27,942 --> 01:41:29,067
Would you?

1671
01:41:30,775 --> 01:41:32,733
As a personal favor?

1672
01:41:32,817 --> 01:41:34,442
We're all ready, ma'am.

1673
01:41:37,983 --> 01:41:40,525
That's <i>señorita</i> to you.

1674
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:45,692
Yes. Yes, ma'am...
<i>Señorita.</i> Yes.

1675
01:41:50,817 --> 01:41:54,150
<i>Listas.</i> We'll follow behind.

1676
01:41:57,650 --> 01:42:00,233
- It's hotter in here.
- Put on the AC.

1677
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:05,317
Come find me in the Bronx.

1678
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:08,692
3843 Grand Concourse.

1679
01:42:12,067 --> 01:42:13,858
Where the hell is everybody?

1680
01:42:18,733 --> 01:42:22,025
<i>Diablo.</i> It's like
they've given up.

1681
01:42:57,150 --> 01:42:59,108
Bye, people!

1682
01:42:59,192 --> 01:43:00,650
Bye!

1683
01:43:00,733 --> 01:43:02,233
<i>Carajo.</i>

1684
01:43:02,317 --> 01:43:04,233
Ungrateful!

1685
01:43:04,317 --> 01:43:09,317
Our matriarch bites the dust,
and this is how we move on?

1686
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:12,483
We are not power-less.
We are powerful.

1687
01:43:12,567 --> 01:43:15,483
If Claudia was here,
she'd say, <i>"P'alante."</i>

1688
01:43:15,567 --> 01:43:20,983
In Puerto Rico, blackouts happen all
the time, and we still threw a fiesta.

1689
01:43:25,942 --> 01:43:27,233
This is like
<i>Gilligan's Ghetto Island.</i>

1690
01:43:27,317 --> 01:43:30,525
<i>Mi amor, cálmate,</i> huh?
What would Jesus do?

1691
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:35,650
Do I look like Jesus to you?

1692
01:43:35,733 --> 01:43:37,858
- I mean, sometimes when I squint.

How long
does this process take?

1957
02:01:26,525 --> 02:01:29,858
Well,
from the original application to court,

1958
02:01:29,942 --> 02:01:34,483
appearances, appeals,
to a final decision...

1959
02:01:34,567 --> 02:01:37,233
could be five months.

1960
02:01:37,317 --> 02:01:38,983
Or five years.

1961
02:01:39,067 --> 02:01:41,650
- Five years?
- Yeah.

1962
02:01:41,733 --> 02:01:46,233
For a green card
or a rejection.

1963
02:01:46,317 --> 02:01:49,608
See, the courts work
at their own speed.

1964
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:54,775
Then we start today.

1965
02:02:00,275 --> 02:02:02,275
This is worth 96,000.

1966
02:02:02,358 --> 02:02:05,275
How much fight
does this buy us?

1967
02:02:05,358 --> 02:02:09,275
I wanna pay for your fee,
and the rest put in a trust for Sonny.

1968
02:02:13,150 --> 02:02:14,317
- Dude.
- It don't matter.

1969
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,942
Holy shit,
that's a lot of money.

1970
02:02:16,025 --> 02:02:18,733
- Watch your mouth, bro.
- When did you get that?

1971
02:02:18,817 --> 02:02:20,608
What you mean, when did I get it?
Don't worry about when I got it.

1972
02:02:20,692 --> 02:02:23,442
Why you always
asking questions?

1973
02:02:23,525 --> 02:02:26,983
You know, payment in checks
is more common.

1974
02:02:27,067 --> 02:02:28,983
I leave on the first flight
in the morning.

1975
02:02:29,067 --> 02:02:30,900
I don't have time
to cash in now.

1976
02:02:32,275 --> 02:02:34,317
I wish I did, but I like...

1977
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:36,067
Please.

1978
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:41,567
All right.

1979
02:02:42,942 --> 02:02:44,983
<i>Bueno, mijo...</i>

1980
02:02:45,067 --> 02:02:47,567
...this is gonna be
an emotional rollercoaster.

1981
02:02:47,650 --> 02:02:50,692
It may end in heartbreak.

1982
02:02:50,775 --> 02:02:53,817
- But, there's a chance, right?
- Yeah.

1983
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:57,983
But it's my responsibility
to make sure that he knows...

1984
02:02:59,067 --> 02:03:01,650
the odds are against you.

1985
02:03:14,650 --> 02:03:16,942
Understood.

1986
02:03:26,775 --> 02:03:28,942
I still want to fight, though.

1987
02:03:31,983 --> 02:03:33,442
Okay.

1988
02:03:53,983 --> 02:03:55,233
Pete!

1989
02:03:57,025 --> 02:03:58,692
Seriously?

1990
02:03:58,775 --> 02:04:01,108
My bad. Use one of those rags.

1991
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:15,150
Hey...

1992
02:04:18,775 --> 02:04:20,233
How much for this?

1993
02:04:20,317 --> 02:04:22,525
Free. I got tons like that.

1995
02:04:43,358 --> 02:04:45,400

Hey.

02:08:14,567 --> 02:08:15,942
Do you have two minutes?

2053
02:08:17,733 --> 02:08:20,150
Yeah.

2054
02:08:20,233 --> 02:08:22,317
You said you wanted to see the

2055
02:08:23,608 --> 02:08:26,192
- Yeah.
- Come with me.

2056
02:08:29,150 --> 02:08:29,983
- No peeking.
- All right.

2057
02:08:30,067 --> 02:08:32,525
- Okay.
- All right.

2058
02:08:32,608 --> 02:08:34,317
Watch it.

2059
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:37,525
- Where am I going?
- Just stand right here.

2060
02:08:37,608 --> 02:08:39,233
- Where?
- No peeking.

2061
02:08:39,317 --> 02:08:41,817
- I'm not...
- I can feel you trying to open your eyes, okay?

2062
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:43,483
- I'm not trying...
- Just don't.

2063
02:08:44,608 --> 02:08:46,108
Hold on.

2064
02:08:48,108 --> 02:08:49,567
Okay, open.

2065
02:09:00,775 --> 02:09:04,317
After I left your place
last night, I just...

2066
02:09:05,233 --> 02:09:07,942
walked around for a while.

2067
02:09:08,025 --> 02:09:10,942
And then I ran into Pete.

2068
02:09:11,025 --> 02:09:13,900
And I saw one
of his drop cloths, and...

2069
02:09:15,733 --> 02:09:18,108
I thought that this
is my next piece.

2070
02:09:19,817 --> 02:09:22,442
So I called Sonny and I told
him to open up the bodega,

2071
02:09:22,525 --> 02:09:24,817
'cause my fingers
needed to move.

2072
02:09:36,567 --> 02:09:40,233
She started working and was
like, "I need more drop cloths."

2073
02:09:40,317 --> 02:09:41,692
So I started painting.

2074
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:00,442
Yo, how did you...

2075
02:10:03,150 --> 02:10:04,942
That's my dad's beach.

2076
02:10:05,025 --> 02:10:09,108
Yeah. You had all those photos
by the register.

2077
02:10:09,192 --> 02:10:11,025
I worked from memory.

2078
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:17,108
I did the crab in the corner.

2079
02:10:17,192 --> 02:10:18,608
What's so funny?

2080
02:10:18,692 --> 02:10:20,358
Who cares
about the crab in the corner?

2081
02:10:20,442 --> 02:10:22,358
What you mean,
the crab is like the best part.

2082
02:10:22,442 --> 02:10:24,233
No, it is not.
It's in the corner for a reason.

2083
02:10:24,317 --> 02:10:25,525
So what, are you saying
you don't like my crab?

2084
02:10:25,608 --> 02:10:27,817
I may be saying
a lot of things,

2085
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:30,025
that just looks like
a fourth-grader drew that.

2086
02:10:30,108 --> 02:10:31,983
- You could sell that.
- No, I cannot. For how much?

2087
02:10:32,067 --> 02:10:34,233
- 25 cents?
- No, I think a couple of grand.

2088
02:10:34,317 --> 02:10:35,400
What?

2089
02:10:35,483 --> 02:10:37,400
