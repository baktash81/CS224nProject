00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:20,323
I'm guessing it's the relay
or the spark plugs.

3
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,325
I got tools
back at the cabin.

4
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:24,393
Shouldn't be a big job.

5
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:25,660
Can I help?

00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,697
- [branches crack]

7
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,468
Dad?

8
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,671
Yeah. Yeah, sure you can help.

9
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:41,143
Is there a safe?
At the cabin.

10
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:42,811
Why?

11
00:01:42,945 --> 00:01:46,082
- You got valuables you trying to hide?
- [chuckles] No.

12
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:48,451
Worried I'm gonna steal
your baseball cards?

13
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,718
No.

14
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,486
I heard you on the phone
the other night.

15
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:53,488
You said you were
at a safe house.

16
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,791
It's just another word
for cabin.

17
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:58,394
So there's no safe?

18
00:01:58,526 --> 00:02:00,062
There's a fireplace, though.

19
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:03,933
Maybe we can roast
some marshmallows.

20
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,245
Hey. Hey. Hey.

21
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:18,747
Hey. We need to leave.

22
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,749
Right now. Come on.

23
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:22,251
Dad?

25
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:31,260
Dad, what's happening?

26
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,040
Do not move,
no matter what happens.

29
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,795
You were almost hard to find.

30
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:43,199
Let's have it.

31
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,872
All of it.

32
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:55,311

33
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:11,193

[panting]

35
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:35,650
Here is how I make decisions.

36
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,289
Win, you live.

37
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,158
Lose,

38
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,093
you die.

39
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:56,071
Now that's too bad.

40
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:58,840
Snake eyes.

41
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:01,877
What can I say?
House always wins.

42
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:03,811
No!

43
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:08,417
Run!

44
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,066
Kid's gone.

61
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:14,036
Snake Eyes!

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:17,206
[cheering continues]

63
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:23,512
They call you "Snake Eyes"
and yet you always win.

64
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,782
Of course,
your technique is a bit crude,

65
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,051
but that has its advantages.

66
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:32,654
I've been watching you
for a while now.

67
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,391
That ain't creepy at all.

68
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:38,594
When you grow up on the streets,
it's them or you, right?

69
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:42,865
My name is Kenta Takamura,
and I could use a man like you.

70
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:47,569
Ain't nothing personal,
but I don't work for guys like you.

71
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:48,937
Or anyone,
for that matter.

72
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,673
I know.
You are a drifter.

73
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:55,444
You fight until no one will bet
against you anymore and then move on.

74
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,146
Works for me.

75
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,682
They said you watched your old man
get killed when you were just a boy.

76
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:03,485
True?

77
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:07,556
I like to know
who I'm hiring.

78
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:15,631
I told you, I ain't interested.
You got the wrong guy.

79
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,766
- You haven't heard my offer yet.
- I don't care.

80
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:23,472
"Homicide victim recovered from
cabin fire is still unidentified."

81
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,242
My men found it
going through your motel room.

82
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:31,013
Sounds like the police
could never ID the body.

83
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:34,249
Nor did they
ever find the killer.

84
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:39,054
That, Mr. Snake Eyes,
is my offer.

85
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,929
I'm pretty good
at finding people.

86
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:48,497
Especially people
who kill other people.

87
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,468
Come work for me,

88
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,305
and I promise you,
I'll find the man who did this.

89
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:14,690
I'll find a spot for you
in my crew.

90
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,758
You can start
at the docks.

91
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,525
[Snake Eyes] Hey.

92
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,528
[chuckles]

93
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,968
Uh-oh.

94
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,236
Here comes Fish Boy.

95
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,605
Cover up! Cover up! Cover up!

96
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:05,707
Let me know
when you get a new joke.

97
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:07,944
Oi! [shouts in Japanese]

98
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:11,046
- Hey. Easy, easy. They're just kids.
- [kids shouting]

99
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:14,550
Throw it over. Yeah.

100
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,054
I'm guessing you were always
picked last on the playground, huh?

101
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:20,924
Hey! No, no, no! Huh?

102
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,291
Take it easy.

103
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:25,527
He meant no disrespect.
Right?

104
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:27,696
Yeah. Sure.

105
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:33,435
I don't know what your deal
is, but you have guts.

106
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,443
Boss.

107
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,337

Boss wants to talk to you.

Am I in trouble?

00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:23,886
Someone is.

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,456
Leave the knife. Mmm?

114
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,330
We operate on one currency.

115
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:40,836
Not money. Not fear.
Just one simple thing.

116
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:43,271
Trust.

117
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:47,476
See, 'cause without trust,
there can be no loyalty.

118
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:49,879
And without loyalty...

119
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:53,916
there is no yakuza.

127
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,581
I wouldn't have pictured you

128

in a place like this
with friends like these.

129
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:35,158
My cousin here is one of
Japan's most powerful sons.

130
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,826
And you are one
of its most disgraced.

131
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,363
This man betrayed our trust.

132
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:45,834
He's an undercover spy, acting out
of loyalty to his precious clan.

133
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:52,441
Let's show him what loyalty
really looks like.

I owe you a blood debt.

188
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:17,692
You saved my life. Why?

189
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:21,163
I'm not a murderer.

190
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:26,668
I looked into your eyes,
and I saw honor.

191
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:35,044
So why run guns
for the yakuza?

192
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:38,813
That was a mistake.

193
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:41,250
Well, you got that right.

194
00:20:42,817 --> 00:20:45,187
If Kenta
ever sees you again,

195
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,389
you are a dead man.

196
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:56,265
He called you cousins.

197
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:02,037
We grew up together.

198
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:05,975
We were both next in line
to become leader of our clan.

199
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:10,246
But there can only be one.

200
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,150
So Kenta tried
to have me killed.

201
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,654
When his treachery
was discovered...

202
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:24,659
I was given the responsibility
to decide his fate.

203
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,899
I ordered him banished.

204
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,168
And since then,

205
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:37,039
he has been trying to seize
power the only way he knows how.

206
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,610
Through greed and violence.

207
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:46,714
I didn't know till today it was
Kenta smuggling these guns to Japan.

208
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,185
I was ambushed.

209
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,853
You're his enemy now too.

210
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:56,691
Which means
your "Fish Boy" life in LA...

211
00:21:58,093 --> 00:21:59,328
is over.

212
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,236
There's no going back.

213
00:22:11,073 --> 00:22:12,874
Hey, where are we heading?

214
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,934
Really?

215
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:36,191
What is it exactly you do?

216
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:39,228
A little of this,
little of that.

217
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:44,900
- That your wife?
- No.

218
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:46,568
- Your girlfriend.
- Uh-uh.

219
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:47,835
Sister?

220
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,040
Akiko is our chief of security.

221
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:55,311
We value her advice,
but we don't have to take it.

222
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:05,888
The leader of our clan
rarely meets outsiders.

223
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:08,223
Don't forget to bow.

224
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:13,128
[door opens]

225
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:24,373
Snake Eyes,

226
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:29,178
I present the leader
of the clan Arashikage, Sen.

227
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,681
My grandmother.

228
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:36,685
The man who saved
my grandson's life.

229
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:40,022
We Arashikage
are in your debt,

230
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:43,459
which means Japan
is in your debt.

231
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,828
Don't worry about it.

232
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:49,098
I'll settle for a hot bath
and a plane ticket out of here.

233
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:52,401
I have a better idea.

234
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:55,471
Stay.

235
00:24:57,806 --> 00:25:00,008
I want you to join us.

236
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,111
Join the Arashikage.

237
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:05,881
Sen-sama.
If I may.

238
00:25:06,014 --> 00:25:08,517
Even allowing him
this much access is reckless.

239
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,587
- I vouch for him.
- With respect, Tommy-san,

240
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:14,289
you do not lead
this clan.

241
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:16,558
Not yet.

242
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:18,494
Someday I will.

243
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:25,601
And I will need a warrior
like this by my side.

244
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:30,305
Someone I can trust
with my life.

245
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:34,510
For 600 years,

246
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:39,148
our ninja have brought
peace and stability to Japan.

247
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:43,852
The secret blade and iron wall of
every government since the age of Edo.

248
00:25:43,986 --> 00:25:46,021
But things have changed.

249
00:25:46,155 --> 00:25:49,792
New threats
call for new strategies.

250
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,261
Even welcoming outsiders...

251
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:56,999
as you, of all of us,
should know, Akiko.

252
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:03,505
Any questions we have about
our new friend,

253
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,912
the Three Challenges of the
Warrior will answer them.

254
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:12,114
And will he submit
to the challenges?

255
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,220
He will.

256
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:32,835
I'm sorry, the Three
Challenges of the what now?

257
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:37,673
The Three Challenges are designed
to reveal an applicant's character.

258
00:26:38,707 --> 00:26:43,145
The first two will cleanse you of
ego, anger and fear

259
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,547
and ready you for the third.

260
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:48,550
That's the true test.

261
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:52,421
It will be up to you
whether you wish to take it.

262
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:54,690
What if I fail?

263
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,393
You die.

264
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:01,163
[chuckles]

265
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,733
You're being serious.

266
00:27:05,902 --> 00:27:09,204
I wouldn't put you in that position
if I thought it was likely.

267
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:15,544
I can't give you
a name or a past...

268
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,648
but I can offer you a purpose.

269
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:22,184
And something more important.

270
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:24,620
A home.

271
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,526
And why would you do that?

272
00:27:32,394 --> 00:27:35,163
Because I saw honor
in your eyes, too.

273
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:42,371
Come.

274
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:50,212
Get some rest.
You have time to decide.

275
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:11,600
In the meantime,
consider my home your home.

276
00:28:14,003 --> 00:28:16,238
So your toys,
my toys, huh?

277
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:17,839
[chuckles]

278
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:20,342
How American.

279
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:53,175
[man shouts]

280
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:57,312
[man shouts]

281
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,916
[Tommy] <i>You'll need
to get farther faster.</i>

282
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:01,416
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

283
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,886
<i>The Arashikage are more
than just brute force.</i>

284
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,389
<i>We are spies, scouts,
guardians, infiltrators.</i>

285
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:12,095
<i>You will be tested, you will be hurt,
you will suffer, and you will fail.</i>

286
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:16,032
<i>But the hardest part will be
listening to you complain about it.</i>

287
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:17,399
[groans]

288
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:26,808
[Akiko]
I still think this is a mistake.

289
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:31,914
Zero hits on his fingerprints.

290
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:35,051
Nothing on any of our
facial recognition platforms.

291
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:37,486
This stray dog of yours
is a ghost.

292
00:29:39,187 --> 00:29:40,756
I'm not scared of ghosts.

293
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,257
I'm serious, Tommy.

294
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:44,027
He was working for the
yakuza, for God's sake.

295
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,795
- He's not one of them.
- That doesn't make him one of us.

296
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:49,698
"Us"?

297
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:55,404
My name...

298
00:29:56,338 --> 00:30:00,275
My name is
Tomisaburo Arashikage.

299
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,680
You think
I would endanger this clan?

300
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:08,383
I am this clan.

301
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:11,954
Tommy-san, I wasn't
questioning your loyalty.

302
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:14,756
Just my judgment.

303
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:19,561
He saved my life, Akiko.

304
00:30:20,295 --> 00:30:21,697
I owe him this chance.

305
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,899
I understand it.

306
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:25,467
I'm just worried
you're moving too fast.

307
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,937
"Too quick to anger,
too quick to react."

308
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:30,772
Now you sound like Grandmother.

309
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:36,211
If I'm wrong about him,
we'll find out tomorrow.

310
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:40,183
80% of candidates
fail the first challenge.

311
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:41,583
Just saying.

312
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:46,221
Well, that means
20% pass, Akiko.

313
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,391
Just saying.

314
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,495
[Sen] For 600 years,

315
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,731
our fighters have been trained

316
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:59,334
by the greatest warriors
the world has ever known.

317
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:01,938
Hard Master.

318
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:12,414
And most honorable

319
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,283
Blind Master.

320
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:19,788
From them,
you will learn how to fight,

321
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:22,257
how to kill when necessary,

322
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,359
but most importantly,

323
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:28,730
how to live according to
the Arashikage Mindset.

324
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:30,465
Abandon ego.

325
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:33,435
Strike with honor.

326
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:38,573
Selflessness and truthfulness
will lead to harmony.

327
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:41,276
Any questions?

328
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,980
- What happens...
- Silence!

329
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:46,615
You are nothing.

330
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:48,918
This challenge
is a waste of time.

331
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:51,921
You will fail.

332
00:31:53,156 --> 00:31:56,792
Okay, Hard-on Master,
or whatever your name is.

333
00:31:58,426 --> 00:31:59,896
Let's go.

334
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:41,369
Challenge one.

335
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,475
Take this bowl from me.
I'll take that bowl from you.

336
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:49,912
Okay, I'll bite.

337
00:32:50,478 --> 00:32:51,780
What's the punch line?

338
00:32:51,914 --> 00:32:55,184
You must take my bowl
without spilling any water.

339
00:32:55,318 --> 00:32:58,955
Fail four times and your training
is over before it begins.

340
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:15,905
- [grunts]
- That's one.

341
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,505
[chuckles]

342
00:33:41,297 --> 00:33:42,564
Two.

343
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:11,060
[grunts]

344
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,502
That's three.

345
00:34:21,337 --> 00:34:23,505
[speaking Japanese]

346
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,841
[speaking Japanese]

347
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,046
[panting]

348
00:34:38,687 --> 00:34:40,488
[Tommy] <i>Abandon ego.</i>

349
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:44,961
<i>Selflessness
and truthfulness...</i>

350
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:48,563
<i>will lead to harmony.</i>

351
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:13,189
Hard Master.

352
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:19,527
I humbly request that you accept
my bowl in exchange for yours.

353
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:36,445
No congratulations?

354
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:38,014
One down, two to go.

355
00:35:38,147 --> 00:35:39,281
Congratulations.

356
00:35:39,415 --> 00:35:42,817
If I ever need a bowl of water,
I know who to ask.

357
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:46,355
You hide it well,

358
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:49,392
but I can tell you're
a little impressed with me.

359
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,994
What I think of you
is irrelevant.

360
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:55,197
You'll survive the
third test or you won't.

361
00:35:55,331 --> 00:35:57,799
Then it won't matter at all.

362
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:03,139
To Tommy, our future <i>toryo.</i>

363
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:06,909
May you be strong,
wise and honorable.

364
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:08,610
[Hard Master] To Snake Eyes.

365
00:36:09,178 --> 00:36:10,112
May you die well.

366
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:12,048
[all laughing]

367
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:13,315
<i>Kanpai.</i>

368
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:15,683
[all] <i>Kanpai!</i>

369
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:20,222
That word he used,
<i>"toryo."</i>

370
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:24,592
It means
"head of family."

371
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:27,329
I am the last of
the Arashikage bloodline.

372
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:31,866
Ever since I was a child,
I've been groomed to lead.

373
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:34,869
This is my destiny.

374
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:41,709
But if I'm to lead the clan
into the next hundred years,

375
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:44,046
I have to adapt.

376
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:47,749
We have to adapt.

377
00:36:49,385 --> 00:36:52,254
I need warriors like you,

378
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:55,590
who have lived in
and know the new world

379
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:57,725
but can master
the Arashikage Mindset,

380
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:00,963
to become
the future of the clan

381
00:37:01,097 --> 00:37:05,700
and fight side by side
as brothers.

382
00:37:07,503 --> 00:37:10,339
Anyway, eat.

383
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:25,955
Why is Hard Master
staring at me like that?

384
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:27,856
He isn't.

385
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:30,192
He is very nearsighted.

386
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:33,963
The Blind Master,
on the other hand...

387
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:36,899
he is watching you.

388
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:48,377
They say he knows a liar
when he hears one.

389
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:56,051
[man speaking Japanese]

390
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:58,454
Tommy said I could
borrow one of his bikes.

391
00:37:58,587 --> 00:37:59,522
His motorbikes?

392
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,223
- Bike... [Japanese]
- Yes.

393
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:03,192
[speaking Japanese]

394
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,294
That one.

395
00:38:25,548 --> 00:38:27,383
[people chattering]

396
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:29,218
Keep an eye on the bike.

397
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,930
[patrons chattering]

398
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:06,754
I didn't know
if you would show up.

399
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,892
Why?

400
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:13,095
Just because you left me to
bleed out on a dock in LA?

401
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:15,531
All you had to do was
get Tommy on that boat.

402
00:39:15,664 --> 00:39:18,601
Think you could've mentioned
that he'd wade through 50 yakuza

403
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,903
just for the chance
to kick your ass?

404
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:23,939
Hey, it worked.

405
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:25,840
You earned his trust.

406
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:27,643
You got in.

407
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:29,912
By the way, how did he like,

408
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:33,249
"I looked into your eyes
and saw honor"?

409
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,119
- He ate it up.
- I knew he would.

410
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,090
He told me
about your history.

411
00:39:41,223 --> 00:39:44,093
How you tried to kill him
and he cast you out of the clan.

412
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:47,062
Our family drama
is not your concern.

413
00:39:47,196 --> 00:39:49,797
Yeah, you're right about that,
'cause I'm out.

414
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,834
We had an agreement.

415
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:54,236
And I seem to be the only guy

416
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,538
who's keeping up his end of it.

417
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,941
And here I had
a gift for you.

418
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:04,013
You found him.

419
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:20,862
- Where?
- Easy now.

420
00:40:21,863 --> 00:40:25,100
I kept my word.
Now you have to keep yours.

421
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:27,369
They want me
to take three tests.

422
00:40:28,037 --> 00:40:29,505
I fail the third, I die.

423
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:32,574
So whatever you need me to
do, it better be quick.

424
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,209
It's up to you.

425
00:40:34,343 --> 00:40:39,048
There is a priceless artifact
hidden in the castle grounds.

426
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:42,251
The Jewel of the Sun.

427
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:46,055
It's a symbol
of Arashikage's power.

428
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:49,058
Find the jewel
and bring it to me...

429
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:52,860
and I'll give you
your father's killer.

430
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:10,879
[engine stops]

431
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,048
[kickstand flips]

432
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:30,865
[speaking Japanese]

[woman speaking Japanese

434
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:44,446
[speaking Japanese]

435
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,914
"You're welcome."

436
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:49,651
This place is built like a fortress.
What are you protecting?

437
00:41:50,486 --> 00:41:51,653
When I was young,

438
00:41:52,454 --> 00:41:56,492
I was told stories
of the Sun Goddess.

439
00:41:56,625 --> 00:42:00,529
Once, long ago, she wanted to
test the character of her people,

440
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:06,235
so she sent down a gift
in the form of a jewel.

441
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:12,374
A jewel that contained
the power of the sun.

442
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:15,811
We swore an oath to protect
it, but more important,

443
00:42:15,944 --> 00:42:18,147
to never use it ourselves.

444
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,949
As I grew, I realized why.

445
00:42:22,618 --> 00:42:26,155
We have the power to destroy
anyone who wrongs us,

446
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:29,124
but that is
a dangerous temptation.

447
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:32,227
True power
calls for discipline.

448
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:38,367
This is Morning Light.

449
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:43,439
My gift to you for passing
the first challenge.

450
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,883
It's easy
to shoot with a gun,

451
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:57,953
but the sword
is a weapon of honor.

452
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:02,090
[speaking Japanese]

453
00:43:04,993 --> 00:43:06,595
You know what I mean.

[speaking Japanese]

455
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:13,769
It suits you.

456
00:43:14,938 --> 00:43:18,540
Hey, there was nothing in that
brochure about a nuclear jewel.

457
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,209
Only a few have access.

458
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:23,979
My grandmother,
the masters...

459
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,014
and me.

460
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:28,817
Seems like a lot of protocol
for a fairy tale.

461
00:43:28,952 --> 00:43:32,421
Not protocol.
There's a DNA lock.

462
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:35,657
Like I said,
blood matters to my family.

463
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:40,128
[thunder rumbling]

464
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,724
[grunting]

465
00:44:57,372 --> 00:44:59,074
What are you doing here?

466
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:02,210
[chuckles] You.

467
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:03,812
I was going for a walk.

468
00:45:04,646 --> 00:45:06,748
Mm. With a sword?

469
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,387
I thought it was time to
get serious about my training.

470
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:15,324
That's Morning Light,
a weapon of honor.

471
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:18,093
What makes you think
you deserve it?

472
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:20,329
What makes you think
you can use it?

473
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:22,531
How hard could it be?

474
00:45:23,298 --> 00:45:24,666
Let's find out.

475
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:32,808
- How'd you get that scar?
- How did you get your name?

476
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:35,011
I'll tell you when
you get to know me better.

477
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:36,812
If you live that long.

478
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,317
- How about a wager?
- I'm all ears.

479
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:46,221
Land one blow on me
and I won't cut them both off.

480
00:45:46,855 --> 00:45:48,724
And if I lose?

481
00:45:48,857 --> 00:45:52,895
- You tell me why you're here.
- I thought I did. We're training.

482
00:45:53,528 --> 00:45:55,130
Here with the Arashikage.

483
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,502
- You're on.
- Hit me.

484
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:02,371
[grunts]

485
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:07,843
[sighs] With your sword.

486
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,584
Come at me like you mean it.

487
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:27,262
It's not your skill that's
lacking, it's your heart.

488
00:46:27,396 --> 00:46:30,900
If your heart is pure,
our secrets will reveal themselves to you.

489
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,634
If not...

490
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,745
they'll be your end.

491
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,347
[cell phone rings]

492
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,715
You gonna get that?

[ringing]

494
00:46:59,162 --> 00:47:01,630
A win without honor
is no win at all.

495
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:05,801
Are you sure it's Kenta?

496
00:47:05,935 --> 00:47:08,938
He found a new way
to bring his guns to Japan.

497
00:47:10,006 --> 00:47:12,141
He's taking delivery
of a shipment tonight.

498
00:47:12,274 --> 00:47:14,309
If I move fast,
I can get the jump on him.

499
00:47:14,443 --> 00:47:16,478
- You have a location?
- Shinjuku.

500
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:18,647
- I'll send a team.
- No.

501
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:21,783
I'll handle this myself.

502
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:24,786
You have that look
you get sometimes.

503
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:26,722
The shadow before a storm.

504
00:47:28,457 --> 00:47:30,893
That storm will pass
when I kill Kenta.

505
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:35,464
Tommy.

506
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:37,399
I'll come with you.

509
00:48:07,196 --> 00:48:09,331
[Akiko] I'll block the
alley from the street.

510
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:12,001
Tommy,
you handle the rest of them.

511
00:48:12,135 --> 00:48:13,468
And you, secure the weapons.

512
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:14,937
What about Kenta?

513
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:16,538
He's mine.

514
00:48:20,842 --> 00:48:22,044
They're here.

This is a lot of firepower.

533
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,923
What does Kenta want
with it all?

534
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:31,494
To start a war.
With us.

535
00:52:31,626 --> 00:52:35,331
Which means we're gonna need support.
Let's call Scarlett.

- Give me a second.

00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:58,686
Go ahead.

542
00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:00,555
Kenta is back in Tokyo

543
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:02,690
and aligning with Cobra.

544
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:04,726
This is recent?

545
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:06,561
<i>From tonight.</i>

546
00:53:07,629 --> 00:53:08,863
Hang on a sec, okay?

547
00:53:21,477 --> 00:53:23,812
[both grunting]

548
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:26,315
Should we be worried?

549
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:27,550
About Scarlett?

550
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:30,718
No. Major O'Hara
is with the Joes.

551
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:32,154
The what?

552
00:53:32,288 --> 00:53:35,091
An elite global
counterterrorism unit.

553
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:36,992
They're the good guys.

554
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,061
[groans]

555
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:47,970
[groans]

556
00:53:49,105 --> 00:53:49,871
Cobra.

557
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:51,440
So what's the deal with Cobra?

558
00:53:51,574 --> 00:53:53,242
The deal is,

559
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,045
they're a secret network of
terrorist cells, crime syndicates,

560
00:53:56,178 --> 00:53:58,713
arms manufacturers
and paramilitary groups

561
00:53:58,847 --> 00:54:01,683
linked under
a single centralized command.

562
00:54:01,816 --> 00:54:05,854
A shadow organization devoted to
bringing about global revolution

563
00:54:05,988 --> 00:54:09,191
through violence,
extortion and fear.

564
00:54:13,229 --> 00:54:14,363
[Kenta] <i>Major?</i>

565
00:54:14,497 --> 00:54:16,865
Major O'Hara? Major?

566
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:19,201
[Scarlett] <i>I just sent
you a mission brief.</i>

567
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:22,737
I've been keeping tabs on an old friend
of mine who just landed in Japan.

568
00:54:22,871 --> 00:54:24,306
I don't think
it's a coincidence.

569
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,276
<i>Her name's Ana DeCobray,
aka "Baroness."</i>

570
00:54:27,409 --> 00:54:29,844
<i>Since we lost touch,
she's been busy.</i>

571
00:54:31,147 --> 00:54:32,915
She killed a member
of parliament?

572
00:54:33,048 --> 00:54:35,885
<i>Along with 200 other passengers
on the same train,</i>

573
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:37,586
<i>just to influence an election.</i>

574
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:40,055
<i>She's been linked to bombings,
assassinations and civil unrest</i>

575
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:41,991
<i>everywhere from Nanzhao
to Borovia.</i>

576
00:54:42,124 --> 00:54:43,993
<i>In short,
she's top-echelon Cobra.</i>

577
00:54:44,126 --> 00:54:47,930
If Kenta's linked up with the Baroness,
the threat to you is significant.

578
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,232
I'll be in Tokyo
as soon as I can.

579
00:55:56,532 --> 00:55:57,900
[tires screech]

580
00:56:25,561 --> 00:56:28,097
[music plays nearby]

581
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:02,698
I didn't sign up
to work for terrorists.

582
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:06,402
[Baroness] A little late to grow
a conscience, don't you think?

583
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:13,575
We each have our own agenda.

584
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:19,648
There is no reason this triangle of
ours can't be purely transactional.

585
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:22,117
We all have something
the other wants.

586
00:57:24,753 --> 00:57:25,954
Baroness.

587
00:57:26,088 --> 00:57:29,857
I know who you are
and what you've done.

588
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:32,995
That rock you want me to steal,
it's for Cobra, isn't it?

589
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:36,498
No.

590
00:57:36,632 --> 00:57:38,767
I didn't sign up for this.

591
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:42,705
As I said,
ours is a series of exchanges.

592
00:57:42,837 --> 00:57:45,174
Kenta wants to
destroy the clan.

593
00:57:45,873 --> 00:57:48,277
The clan
has something I want.

594
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,112
And we have something you want.

595
00:57:50,245 --> 00:57:52,548
Now of course,
if you've had a change of heart,

596
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:54,516
you are free to go.

597
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:57,953
But then, so is he.

598
00:58:00,589 --> 00:58:02,391
He goes by Augustine.

599
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:05,160
The man who
took your father's life...

600
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:07,463
and yours.

601
00:58:16,472 --> 00:58:17,940
Tell me where he is.

602
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:20,609
Under lock and key.

603
00:58:20,743 --> 00:58:24,747
But I promise you,
back out now

604
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,282
and you will never
see him again.

605
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:31,553
All that rage...

606
00:58:32,821 --> 00:58:35,057
for all these years.

607
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:38,227
Are you sure you're ready
to give up the hunt

608
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,163
when you're so close
to finding peace?

609
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,534
Think about it.

610
00:58:47,603 --> 00:58:49,304
You have three days.

611
00:58:50,506 --> 00:58:52,141
Then I let him go.

612
00:59:03,285 --> 00:59:05,521
Trust me. He'll do it.

613
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:07,990
He'd better.

614
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,259
Or I kill you both.

615
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:12,461
[door slams]

616
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:23,305
[Blind Master] <i>Every warrior has
a weakness your enemy can exploit.</i>

617
00:59:23,439 --> 00:59:26,910
The second challenge
will expose it.

618
00:59:27,042 --> 00:59:32,080
To avoid harm, you must first
learn how you harm yourself.

619
00:59:32,815 --> 00:59:35,250
Most can't manage and fail.

620
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,889
Where is everybody else?

621
00:59:40,022 --> 00:59:42,892
This test is private
and unique to you.

622
00:59:43,025 --> 00:59:44,993
You face it alone.

623
00:59:47,996 --> 00:59:51,066
The light will reveal all.

624
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:53,202
Follow it.

625
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,675
[groans]

626
01:01:20,957 --> 01:01:22,391
I'm sorry, Dad.

627
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,795
I couldn't stop him.

628
01:01:40,809 --> 01:01:42,444
It's not your fault.

629
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:44,513
You were just a kid.

630
01:01:48,283 --> 01:01:49,818
I couldn't save you.

631
01:01:51,054 --> 01:01:52,821
You saved yourself.

632
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:56,425
That's the only thing
that mattered to me.

633
01:02:10,806 --> 01:02:12,841

634
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:43,605
[breathing heavily]

635
01:02:53,615 --> 01:02:55,051
Did I pass?

636
01:02:55,183 --> 01:02:58,487
This is more than a test
you pass or fail.

637
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,891
It is a mirror
to reveal your weakness.

638
01:03:02,025 --> 01:03:08,397
Even if it causes you more pain,
you must unburden yourself.

639
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:12,834
It is the only way
to overcome the third challenge.

640
01:03:12,969 --> 01:03:14,469
And I assure you,

641
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:17,806
this is not a challenge
you want to fail.

642
01:04:25,307 --> 01:04:27,009

649
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:20,362
I miss something?

650
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:26,535
I followed you
into the city.

651
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:28,804
But you know that.

652
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:29,972
Where did you go?

653
01:05:31,506 --> 01:05:34,576
You've been looking for a reason
not to trust me from the start.

654
01:05:34,709 --> 01:05:37,612
You're an unknown.
That's dangerous.

655
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:44,653
- I think you can handle yourself.
- Dangerous to this clan.

656
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:47,689
You don't know
what this place means to me.

657
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:50,592
I owe the Arashikage everything.

658
01:05:50,725 --> 01:05:53,029
I never knew family
before I arrived here.

659
01:05:53,628 --> 01:05:55,797
Can you understand that?

660
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:13,348
You want to know why
I've been a ghost for so long?

661
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:20,522
My father was murdered
when I was a kid.

662
01:06:21,756 --> 01:06:25,328
When I tried to find out why,
it was as if he didn't exist.

663
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,729
False identities, false papers.

664
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:30,665
Everything about him was a lie.

665
01:06:33,501 --> 01:06:34,971
Even my own name.

666
01:06:42,144 --> 01:06:44,412
That's why
I couldn't find you.

667
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:48,717
If I pass
the third challenge...

668
01:06:50,152 --> 01:06:52,121
I'm Arashikage, right?

669
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:54,856
If you pass.

670
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:57,392
I have to pass.

671
01:06:59,794 --> 01:07:04,100
I've done unforgivable things I
wish I could tell you, but I can't.

672
01:07:05,533 --> 01:07:07,535
But if I could become
part of this family,

673
01:07:07,669 --> 01:07:09,071
be its protector...

674
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,975
I think
that would make it right.

675
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:23,718
Then empty your heart.

676
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:28,291
Whatever you're hiding
in there,

677
01:07:28,423 --> 01:07:30,792
the challenge
will see right through it.

678
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:38,466

679
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,869
[Blind Master] <i>I see that
you have a clouded mind.</i>

680
01:07:41,003 --> 01:07:44,073
You live on both sides
of the mirror.

681
01:07:44,206 --> 01:07:47,709
Only you know whether
you are ready to take this test.

682
01:07:47,842 --> 01:07:50,512
Be certain
that you wish to proceed.

683
01:07:50,645 --> 01:07:52,781
Once the third challenge
begins,

684
01:07:52,915 --> 01:07:54,884
there is no turning back.

685
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,221
I'm sure.

686
01:08:00,655 --> 01:08:04,327
Those who pass are
accepted into the Arashikage.

687
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,461
If you survive,
you will gain access

688
01:08:06,594 --> 01:08:09,798
to our knowledge
and our power.

689
01:08:10,832 --> 01:08:14,736
But you must swear loyalty
to our clan.

690
01:08:14,869 --> 01:08:17,106
Do you accept
this condition?

691
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:20,809
I do.

692
01:08:28,683 --> 01:08:30,152
What do I do
when I get down there?

693
01:08:30,286 --> 01:08:32,355
[Blind Master]
There is a particular tile.

694
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:35,157
Step on it
and wait for judgment.

695
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,591
[chuckles]

696
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,161
Something funny?

697
01:08:39,594 --> 01:08:41,130
You will see,

698
01:08:41,263 --> 01:08:42,630
Snake.

Giant anacondas
as old as time.

703
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,183
They never harm
those who are pure of heart.

704
01:10:07,316 --> 01:10:09,018
What about everybody else?

Go!

Go!

01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:52,881
She knows our rules.
She will be punished.

- Grandmother...
- You brought him among us.

716
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:58,254
The fault
is not hers alone.

717
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:00,822
No, Sen-san.

718
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:04,226
The fault is mine.

719
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,895
Explain yourself.

720
01:13:07,029 --> 01:13:10,165
The penalty of lying is death.

721
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:14,270
We are all listening.

722
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:21,876
My heart is not pure.

723
01:13:22,911 --> 01:13:24,446
I seek vengeance.

724
01:13:25,714 --> 01:13:27,316
My father
was murdered.

725
01:13:28,183 --> 01:13:30,286
I have dedicated my life

726
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:32,787
to finding the man
who did it...

727
01:13:33,788 --> 01:13:35,324
and killing him.

728
01:13:40,696 --> 01:13:45,134
[inhales, exhales]
This is all I've ever wanted.

729
01:13:51,173 --> 01:13:52,941
He speaks the truth.

730
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:57,146
Your honesty
wins you your life,

731
01:13:57,812 --> 01:14:00,049
but not among
the Arashikage.

732
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:18,000
Snake!

733
01:14:59,742 --> 01:15:01,276
You should have told me.

734
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:04,279
We could have been brothers.

735
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:07,483
I know I failed you.

736
01:15:08,617 --> 01:15:11,987
You are the only brother
I've ever known.

737
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:15,057
And I would pay you back
with my life if I had to.

738
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:10,045
Keep it.

739
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,599
[chattering]

740
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:19,147
[alarm blaring]

741
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:23,752
[PA: woman speaking Japanese]

742
01:17:25,153 --> 01:17:29,558
[PA: woman continues
speaking Japanese]

743
01:17:56,752 --> 01:17:57,786
[man shouts]

744
01:18:17,773 --> 01:18:21,476
[beeping]

745
01:18:35,157 --> 01:18:37,793
[speaks Japanese]

746
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:57,646
[man shouts in Japanese]

747
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:45,928
[beeping]

748
01:20:14,589 --> 01:20:16,491
I was hoping
you wouldn't do that.

749
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:19,294
Akiko.

750
01:20:20,295 --> 01:20:23,032
Still want to know
how I got my scar?

751
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:24,967
From the last man I trusted.

752
01:20:25,834 --> 01:20:28,637
Trust is a hard thing to
come by these days.

753
01:20:32,075 --> 01:20:33,675
Time for you to learn a lesson.

754
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,218
[grunts]

755
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:46,555
[groaning]

756
01:20:56,032 --> 01:20:59,601
[alarm continues blaring]

757
01:21:11,446 --> 01:21:14,016
You have placed
the clan at risk.

758
01:21:15,084 --> 01:21:16,651
You must atone.

759
01:21:17,285 --> 01:21:19,621
We will return
the Jewel...

760
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:24,994
and bring you the head
of Snake Eyes.

761
01:21:39,008 --> 01:21:40,675
[engine stops]

762
01:21:48,184 --> 01:21:49,417
[Baroness] So?

763
01:21:50,019 --> 01:21:51,319
Do you have it?

764
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,823
You're gonna start a war
with the Arashikage, aren't you?

765
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:56,658
What do you care?

766
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,464
Remember our deal,
and you will get what I promised.

767
01:22:26,588 --> 01:22:29,091
[train rumbling]

768
01:22:36,132 --> 01:22:37,934
This isn't my fight.

769
01:22:50,246 --> 01:22:51,479
Come here.

770
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:11,901
Mmm.

771
01:23:17,106 --> 01:23:18,406
Please,

772
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,542
enjoy your reward.

773
01:23:39,328 --> 01:23:42,764
[Kenta] You will get the Jewel
once I've destroyed the clan.

774
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,823
[breathing heavily]

775
01:24:45,428 --> 01:24:46,661
Who are you?

776
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:51,733
You killed my dad.

777
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:57,306
You're going to have to be
a little more specific.

778
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:01,010
I killed a lot of people.

779
01:25:07,116 --> 01:25:09,484
[panting]

780
01:25:15,224 --> 01:25:16,258
Roll.

781
01:25:18,027 --> 01:25:19,694
Win, you live.

782
01:25:20,396 --> 01:25:22,164
Lose, you die.

783
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:27,635
Roll!

784
01:25:28,636 --> 01:25:29,972
Roll!

785
01:25:33,342 --> 01:25:34,876
Snake eyes.

786
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:38,147
You better think!

787
01:25:40,116 --> 01:25:41,616
[trembling]

788
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:44,286
Okay, okay. All right.

789
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:47,655
Now I remember you.
You attacked me, tried to save your dad.

790
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:49,791
Why did you kill him?

791
01:25:49,925 --> 01:25:52,660
Cobra gives an order,
you don't question it.

792
01:25:56,298 --> 01:25:57,799
[exhales]

793
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:06,308
You're Cobra.

794
01:26:08,244 --> 01:26:09,677
I was.

795
01:26:10,678 --> 01:26:12,014
Until three weeks ago,

796
01:26:12,148 --> 01:26:15,650
when that bitch dragged me
off a chopper at gunpoint.

797
01:26:20,122 --> 01:26:24,626
You must be a big man for
the Baroness to hand me over.

798
01:26:29,864 --> 01:26:31,766
Let's go. Let's do this.

799
01:26:46,482 --> 01:26:47,715
[grunts]

800
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:52,888
[panting]

801
01:27:03,966 --> 01:27:06,202
I have to stop Kenta.

802
01:27:17,645 --> 01:27:18,981
[Akiko] There he is.

803
01:27:19,647 --> 01:27:21,083
Follow him.

804
01:27:33,728 --> 01:27:35,164
[Tommy] What's he doing?

805
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:37,333
[Akiko] Looks like he's
heading back to the castle.

806
01:27:51,779 --> 01:27:54,016
[horn honking]

807
01:27:55,618 --> 01:27:56,952
Let's go.

808
01:27:59,455 --> 01:28:01,789
[speaking Japanese]

809
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:25,381
Did you see that?
Snake's fighting on our side.

810
01:28:49,605 --> 01:28:51,140
Tommy, listen to me.

811
01:28:51,273 --> 01:28:54,310
Kenta's got the Jewel
and is headed for the castle.

812
01:28:54,443 --> 01:28:55,611
Can you hear me?

813
01:28:55,743 --> 01:28:57,079
Tommy! Akiko!

814
01:28:57,213 --> 01:28:58,447
Shit!

815
01:29:27,476 --> 01:29:29,545
[guards shouting]

816
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:30,878
We have to keep you safe.

817
01:29:31,013 --> 01:29:32,747
Nothing matters
but the safety of the clan.

818
01:29:32,881 --> 01:29:34,283
You are the clan!

819
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,352
I am nothing by myself.

820
01:29:40,589 --> 01:29:42,891
[shouting]

821
01:30:09,585 --> 01:30:11,987
[shouting]

822
01:30:33,309 --> 01:30:34,376
[shouting]

823
01:30:48,157 --> 01:30:50,125
I guess the party started early.

824
01:31:13,282 --> 01:31:16,385
- He needs help.
- He deserves to die.

825
01:31:49,051 --> 01:31:51,019
[tires squealing]

826
01:31:55,424 --> 01:31:56,625
[screams]

827
01:32:11,673 --> 01:32:13,142
[shouts]

828
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,360
[chuckles]

829
01:33:03,826 --> 01:33:07,129
[shouts]

830
01:33:07,963 --> 01:33:11,266
We have to stop Kenta.
He has the Jewel.

831
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:14,303
[gunfire]

832
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:18,640
This isn't over.

833
01:33:29,919 --> 01:33:32,754
Leave! Now!

834
01:34:09,124 --> 01:34:11,493
I am the Arashikage.

835
01:34:13,428 --> 01:34:15,464
This is a terrible idea.

836
01:34:40,822 --> 01:34:44,159
[panting]

837
01:34:48,263 --> 01:34:51,266
[speaking Japanese]

838
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:58,206
Very noble.
But the promise is not yours to make.

839
01:35:01,945 --> 01:35:03,111
The Jewel.

840
01:35:03,245 --> 01:35:05,213
The clan is destroyed.

841
01:35:05,347 --> 01:35:07,349
We kept our side
of the bargain.

842
01:35:07,482 --> 01:35:09,618
I trust you'll keep yours.

843
01:35:15,223 --> 01:35:19,328
With this jewel,
Cobra will be invincible.

844
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:23,632
[Kenta]
Maybe I'll just keep it.

845
01:35:23,765 --> 01:35:25,434
No good deed, huh?

846
01:35:26,134 --> 01:35:27,235
Shut up.

847
01:35:27,369 --> 01:35:29,805
Cobra will annihilate you.

848
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:37,245
You protect my grandmother.
I'll go after the Jewel.

849
01:35:39,781 --> 01:35:41,884
When you cast me out,

850
01:35:42,018 --> 01:35:45,654
I warned you
this day would come.

851
01:35:46,755 --> 01:35:47,789
Kneel.

852
01:35:51,094 --> 01:35:52,594
Very well, then.

853
01:35:54,998 --> 01:35:56,231
Die.

854
01:35:58,634 --> 01:36:01,303
We're under attack!
It's Tommy.

855
01:36:06,009 --> 01:36:07,242
Snake.

856
01:36:09,177 --> 01:36:10,646
[Scarlett clears throat]

857
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:16,618
- You're in a tight spot, huh?
- I've been in worse.

858
01:36:16,752 --> 01:36:19,154
Still, I'd like to propose
a very temporary alliance.

859
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:21,523
All right.
But when it's over, I walk.

860
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:24,259
Not a chance,
but I'll give you a head start.

861
01:36:40,175 --> 01:36:42,411
[shouting, grunting]

862
01:36:46,082 --> 01:36:49,919
You're losing your touch.
I saw you a mile away.

863
01:36:51,453 --> 01:36:52,754
Sure you did.

864
01:36:52,889 --> 01:36:55,857
[Hard Master] Good of you
to join us, Tommy-san.

865
01:36:55,992 --> 01:36:57,659
And just in time.

866
01:36:58,727 --> 01:37:00,429
I count 20 men.

867
01:37:01,097 --> 01:37:02,031
[sighs]
Heavy odds.

868
01:37:02,165 --> 01:37:03,933
Yeah. For them.

869
01:37:04,299 --> 01:37:06,535
[shouting]

870
01:37:31,827 --> 01:37:32,929
Snake Eyes,

871
01:37:33,062 --> 01:37:36,732
betray our trust again,
I'll kill you myself.

872
01:37:38,233 --> 01:37:39,568
What is she doing here?

873
01:37:39,701 --> 01:37:42,838
Let's just say our goals
are temporarily aligned.

874
01:37:46,109 --> 01:37:47,542
[Baroness] Just for tonight.

875
01:37:56,052 --> 01:37:57,385
[groans]

876
01:38:27,315 --> 01:38:28,885
[shouts]

877
01:38:29,018 --> 01:38:30,352
They're mine.

878
01:38:43,298 --> 01:38:44,733
[chuckles]

879
01:39:17,465 --> 01:39:19,035
[grunts]

880
01:40:05,314 --> 01:40:06,748
Yo, Joe.

881
01:40:11,053 --> 01:40:13,488
[all shouting]

882
01:40:13,622 --> 01:40:16,025
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

883
01:40:42,084 --> 01:40:43,986
[panting]

884
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,420
[coughs]

885
01:40:45,553 --> 01:40:46,855
Fuck this.

886
01:41:08,144 --> 01:41:12,148
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

887
01:41:52,021 --> 01:41:53,222
[Sen] Tommy!

888
01:42:01,063 --> 01:42:03,132
[shouts]

889
01:42:03,265 --> 01:42:05,667
Tommy-san, no! Tommy-san!

890
01:42:26,654 --> 01:42:28,190
Kenta's gone.

891
01:42:30,493 --> 01:42:31,726
Where's Snake?

892
01:43:08,397 --> 01:43:09,999
[Kenta] Just stay down.

893
01:43:30,618 --> 01:43:31,987
[groans]

894
01:43:37,093 --> 01:43:39,261
[panting]

895
01:43:39,395 --> 01:43:41,197
Abandon ego.

896
01:43:42,098 --> 01:43:43,165
[grunts]

897
01:43:44,266 --> 01:43:46,302
Practice selflessness.

898
01:43:49,371 --> 01:43:52,108
Strike with honor.

899
01:43:53,542 --> 01:43:56,278

906
01:45:08,651 --> 01:45:10,685
This is where you die.

01:45:43,252 --> 01:45:44,887
[hissing]

911
01:46:44,313 --> 01:46:46,482
The Jewel of the Sun
is secure.

912
01:46:53,956 --> 01:46:56,158
And it always will be.

913
01:46:57,192 --> 01:46:59,962
At least
for another generation.

914
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:08,337
I will be the last of our family
to lead the Arashikage.

915
01:47:11,006 --> 01:47:12,441
But Sen-sama...

916
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:17,980
I had no choice.

917
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:23,585
I only used the Jewel
to defend our people.

918
01:47:24,286 --> 01:47:26,088
There is always a choice.

919
01:47:26,221 --> 01:47:29,792
Our clan swore an oath
to never use the Jewel,

920
01:47:29,925 --> 01:47:31,826
only to protect it.

921
01:47:33,095 --> 01:47:34,563
You can never...

922
01:47:36,932 --> 01:47:38,233
lead the clan.

923
01:47:38,367 --> 01:47:39,101
With respect...

924
01:47:39,234 --> 01:47:41,136
Remember your vows,
Tommy,

925
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:44,173
to forever serve the clan
in any capacity.

926
01:47:44,306 --> 01:47:45,507
"Serve"?

927
01:47:50,579 --> 01:47:52,014
[shouts] Serve?

928
01:47:54,817 --> 01:47:59,655
I have given my life
to this clan!

929
01:47:59,788 --> 01:48:02,224
I have sacrificed
everything!

930
01:48:02,358 --> 01:48:03,392
Tommy.

931
01:48:04,026 --> 01:48:07,029
It is my blood right!

932
01:48:17,606 --> 01:48:21,944
You offered me your life.

933
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,117
Next time we meet...

934
01:48:29,651 --> 01:48:33,021
I will take it.

935
01:48:36,492 --> 01:48:38,227
Tomisaburo, wait.

936
01:48:40,396 --> 01:48:43,298
You will always
be a part of this family.

937
01:49:04,686 --> 01:49:06,288
I serve no one.

938
01:49:43,625 --> 01:49:46,562
- I'm going after Tommy.
- I had a feeling you might.

939
01:49:47,329 --> 01:49:48,898
Are you sure that's wise?

940
01:49:49,031 --> 01:49:51,200
In his state,
who knows what he might do?

941
01:49:51,333 --> 01:49:53,435
That's why
I have to find him.

942
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:56,505
This is all my fault.

943
01:49:56,638 --> 01:49:59,208
I have to do everything
I can to make it right.

944
01:50:00,476 --> 01:50:03,412
Well, this might be useful.

945
01:50:16,558 --> 01:50:18,126
Be careful.

946
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:20,897
[clears throat]

947
01:50:21,029 --> 01:50:22,097
Excuse me.

948
01:50:22,231 --> 01:50:24,333
My commander,
General Joe Colton,

949
01:50:24,466 --> 01:50:27,002
wanted to share this
with you.

950
01:50:48,257 --> 01:50:49,791
I don't understand.

951
01:50:49,926 --> 01:50:52,661
Your father was one of us.
A Joe.

952
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:56,131
He was a Joe?

953
01:50:56,265 --> 01:50:58,667
You'll find no record
of you in there.

954
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,403
He kept you off the grid
to protect you.

955
01:51:02,939 --> 01:51:04,239
So why was he killed?

956
01:51:04,373 --> 01:51:06,642
Your father infiltrated
a Cobra cell.

957
01:51:06,775 --> 01:51:08,744
But they found out.

958
01:51:08,877 --> 01:51:11,613
By the time we got there,
he was dead and you were gone.

959
01:51:13,081 --> 01:51:16,818
But you should know the intel he
provided saved thousands of lives.

960
01:51:18,387 --> 01:51:20,088
At the cost of his own.

961
01:51:20,222 --> 01:51:21,557
It was a price
he was willing to pay

962
01:51:21,690 --> 01:51:24,560
to make the world a safer place
for the rest of us.

963
01:51:24,693 --> 01:51:26,595
Safer for his son.

964
01:51:28,697 --> 01:51:31,366
He left some big shoes
to fill, your dad.

965
01:51:33,569 --> 01:51:36,505
It hasn't been easy finding
the right person to fill them.

966
01:51:36,638 --> 01:51:40,309
[chuckles] So you're
saying I could be a Joe?

967
01:51:40,442 --> 01:51:42,277
Anything's possible.

968
01:51:44,713 --> 01:51:46,748
We all make mistakes.

969
01:51:46,883 --> 01:51:49,551
It's what we do next
that really matters.

970
01:51:51,386 --> 01:51:54,590
When you're ready,
Akiko knows where to find us.

971
01:52:01,396 --> 01:52:03,665
There's something
I need to do first.

972
01:52:04,466 --> 01:52:07,269
Let's find Tommy
and bring him home.

973
01:52:53,315 --> 01:52:55,617
Something to drink
before takeoff?

974
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:05,794
I'm not here to kill you.

975
01:53:17,406 --> 01:53:19,307
I came to make you an offer.

976
01:53:24,312 --> 01:53:27,649
[scoffs]
You've lost an army, Tommy.

977
01:53:30,619 --> 01:53:32,554
But I can get you a better one.

978
01:53:40,462 --> 01:53:41,830
Storm Shadow.

979
01:53:47,836 --> 01:53:50,739
Call me Storm Shadow.

980
01:53:55,270 --> 01:54:00,270
