01:31:51,853 --> 01:31:55,050
[ Young Man ] And should you think
this is just a shaggy-dog story...

1151
01:31:55,156 --> 01:31:59,616
told by a senile man to his
young, impressionable grandson,

1152
01:31:59,727 --> 01:32:01,957
l`d ask you to come
to South Wales,

1153
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:04,190
to the village
where l was born.

1154
01:32:04,299 --> 01:32:06,597
And as you drive north
from Cardiff,

1155
01:32:06,701 --> 01:32:08,931
look for
the first big hill--

1156
01:32:09,037 --> 01:32:11,301
not just a hill,
but a mountain--

1157
01:32:11,406 --> 01:32:14,842
and the children
of the people who built it.

1158
01:32:24,686 --> 01:32:29,589
However, just before this film was made,
the mountain was remeasured...

1159
01:32:29,691 --> 01:32:33,821
and found to be 997 feet.

1160
01:32:33,928 --> 01:32:37,489
Thus the mound
had settled back into a hill.

1161
01:32:38,867 --> 01:32:40,892
[ Ghostly Voice ] A hill ?
