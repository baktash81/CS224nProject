I'll give it to you for 30. It's okay.

-I did.
-How did she die?

23
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:33,255
Cancer.

24
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,255
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
Who was she?

25
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,255
Nice choice.

26
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:42,755

You can start your own!

135
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:49,130
Gayle and I started a club
called the Southern Belles.

Oh, is that a fact, Vicki?

137
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:51,921
I'm not allowed to join.

138
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:56,463

It's not called the Wisconsin Belles.

I have to explain that to you.

is the Senior Showcase.

Well, I mean, I'll, uh...

147
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,046
Obviously, I will be sure
and check my calendar.

148
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,671
-Great.
-But if you'll excuse me, ladies,

149
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:23,255
I just want to say thanks for the tour.

150
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:25,046
I should get going, though.
I really should--

151
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,880
Wait. No, you haven't done
your safety training.

it's my job to keep our residents safe.

156

I run a team of highly trained volunteers,
just like Dorris here.

157
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,921
Say hi, Dorris.

158

-Hello, Dorris.

Overgrown hedges.

163
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:51,880
Excessive lawn ornamentation.

164
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:55,380

past New Years, that's a big one.

Well, let's just say it's July

169
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:06,171
and my neighbor hasn't taken down
his Christmas lights.

170
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:08,380
Are you gonna have the guts
to do what it takes?

171
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:09,546
Well...

172
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:13,088

-Hey, you don't play poker, do you?

194

Because I run a weekly game,

195
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:03,130

196
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:07,088
It's all very hush-hush because
gambling's not allowed around here,

00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:38,255
about taking you to that wake.

350
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:40,671
I know you didn't like it. I'm sorry.

351
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:41,671
It was...

352
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:42,588
Anyway,

353
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:44,171
<i>give me a call, would you?</i>

354
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:45,505
<i>I haven't seen you.</i>

355
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,880
<i>I'd love to... You know, bingo's fun.</i>

356
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:51,838
[cell phone ringing]

357
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:57,171
[Sheryl] <i>Oh, hi, Martha.</i>
<i>I was hoping you'd pick up.</i>

358
00:16:57,255 --> 00:17:00,046
<i>We're going bowling</i>
<i>and we'd love you to join us.</i>

359
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,088
<i>I can teach you.</i>

360
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:03,005
<i>It's simple. It's all in the wrist.</i>

361
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,796
<i>So give a call, why don't you?</i>

362
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,046
Bye!

363

365
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,213
Oh.

366
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:17,421
Oh.

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,255
<i>Now, death can be expensive.</i>

370
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,505
<i>There's the embalming, the caskets,</i>

371
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,713
<i>the flowers,</i>
<i>the funeral and cemetery fees,</i>

372

What?

382
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,463
What?

-[clattering continues]
-[sighs]

384
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,630

[Sheryl screams]
What the hell are you doing?!

388
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,421
What am I doing?

389
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:28,338
Oh, my God! I thought you were a burglar!

390
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:31,588
You haven't been out of this place
for days!

391
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:34,546
I thought you'd slipped in the shower
or something.

392
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,588
I was worried the cats
were getting at you.

393
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:38,796
I don't have cats.

394
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:40,713
Jesus Christ!

395
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:43,171
-You could've killed me with that thing!
-I know.

396
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:44,796
Who are you?

397
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:46,338
[Sheryl] Let's have some wine.

398
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:47,588
-Come on, let's sit down.
-Oh!

399
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:48,880
Okay, yeah. [screams]

400
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,838
Oh, my God, Jesus Christ.

401
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:56,005
I'm really sorry
about being such a bitch at the wake.

402
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:58,380
I was mad about something else,
and, you know,

403
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:01,796
I shouldn't have
taken it out on you, and...

404
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,755
No, I'm sorry for telling you what to do.

405
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:08,088
You're a grown-ass woman.
You can do whatever you want.

406
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:09,005
Yeah.

407
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:13,421
What's this?

408
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:16,088
Oh, no, it's just a bunch of old junk.

409
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,296
You were a cheerleader?

410
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:21,838
Oh, aren't you full of surprises?

411
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:23,213
Ms. Pep Squad.

412
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,130
Queen of the campus.

413
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,338
Yeah, in another life,
I guess you'd call it.

414
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:31,380
I used to just come running home
so that I could practice all afternoon,

415
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,171
and it drove my mom totally crazy.

416
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:36,005
That's how bad I wanted it.

417
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:37,338
Yeah.

418
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:40,963
And I tried out three times
and I never made the cut.

419
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,046
But get this.

420
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:43,963
Finally, in my senior year,

421
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:46,005
I made the varsity squad.

422
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:47,255
Better late than never!

423
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:49,880
Yeah. On the day before our first game...

424
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:56,796
I found out
that my mother was very sick, so...

425
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,963
I, uh...

426
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:04,463
I quit the team, you know,
started to take care of her.

427
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,171
Man, you know. [laughing] Oh, my God. I...

428
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,255
You know, I never... [laughs]

429
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:13,255
I never did perform.

430
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,546
-[Sheryl] Oh.
-No, that's...

431
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:18,546
Maybe you should give it another shot.

432
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,338
Yeah, maybe the Dallas Cowgirls
have an opening, right?

433
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,338
[Sheryl laughs]

434
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:23,880
Yeah.

435
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:26,088
-You know what?
-What?

436
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,213
I really love this.

437
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:31,380
-[Martha] Mm-hmm.
-I think it's kinda... sexy.

438
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,255
Don't you think? [laughs]

439
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:34,338
Uh, hey...

440
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,338
Could I borrow this?

441
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,588
-No.
-[laughs]

442
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:38,880
No, I can't?

443
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:40,880
-No, of course you can!
-[laughs]

444
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:44,505
'Cause I'm taking pictures
for my Jdate profile.

445
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:46,005
I didn't know you were Jewish.

446
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:47,130
Oh, I'm not.

447
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:49,005
Hey.

448
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:52,546
I'm glad you're not cat food.

449
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,963
[laughs] Yeah, thanks.

450
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,296
-See ya.
-Yeah, see you.

458
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:47,963
[Martha] Hello?

459
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:50,755
-Hello?
-Hey. Shh.

460
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:51,755
Sheryl's not here.

461
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,338
Who are you anyway? I mean...

462
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:57,088
And don't give me that nonsense
about being the gardener--

463
00:21:57,171 --> 00:22:00,213
I live here. They don't let anyone
under 55 live here,

464
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:02,171
so I gotta keep a low profile.

465
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:05,088
Oh. So Sheryl likes 'em young,
does she, huh?

466
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:06,171
What?

467
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,088
Oh.

468
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:09,588
-What?
-Sheryl is my-- my grandma.

469
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:10,505
Oh.

470
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:12,088
Yeah.

471
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,296
And where is she anyway, huh?

472
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:16,921
She substitute teaches at my school

473
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:19,463
when she needs the extra cash,
so she's down there.

474
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,588
Sheryl's a teacher?

475
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:21,963
[both laugh]

476
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:25,963
If you can call it that.
I pretend to be sick whenever she's there.

477
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:27,338
It's kinda humiliating.

478
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:31,130
Miss Ferris is away sick,
so we'll be watching a movie.

479
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:33,588
-Yes?
-What's the movie?

480
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:35,588
It's an educational video

481
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:38,588
about the dangers of STDs.

482
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,713
Are you even qualified to be teaching us?

483
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:43,088
What's your name?

484
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:44,005
Chloe.

485
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:48,463
Well, Chloe, the state of Georgia
has surprisingly low standards

486
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:50,171
for substitute teachers.

487
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:51,755
If you've got a problem with that,

488
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:54,171
you take it up with your congressman.

489
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:57,421
Okay, but we're supposed to be studying
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

490
00:22:57,505 --> 00:22:59,963
Well, today you'll be studying gonorrhea.

So you're a teacher, huh?

501
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:27,713
Well, I like to think of myself
as more of a life coach.

502

[Martha laughs]

503
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:30,713
I was a teacher.

504
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:32,630
-Yeah?
-Yes, yes.

505
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,005
Do you ever miss it?

506
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:38,380
Sometimes. I mean, God, the hours
were long and the pay was ridiculous,

507
00:23:38,463 --> 00:23:39,588
but yeah, I guess I...

508
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:41,088
I guess miss it.

509
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,880
[Sheryl] So, what are you doing here?

510
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:46,421
I have an announcement to make.

511
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:52,213
We're starting a cheerleading club
at Sun Springs.

512
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:53,796
[laughs]

513
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,755
Is that the set-up or the punchline?

514
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:58,005
No, no, no. I'm really serious, right?

515
00:23:58,296 --> 00:23:59,713
I mean, I have to join a club.

516
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:01,713
I don't like any of their clubs, so...

517
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:03,421
I'm creating my own.

518
00:24:04,046 --> 00:24:05,505

-Yes, come on, seriously!

519
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:07,505
You do know how old you are.

520
00:24:07,588 --> 00:24:10,880
What's the difference? I mean, we'll learn
a few moves. There's nothing to it. I--

Hey, what's this "we"?

523
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,213
I can't do it without you.

00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,921
I took a sewing class last year,

701
00:32:31,005 --> 00:32:33,963
and he had to make his own dinners
on Wednesday nights.

702
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,588
Well, that sounds traumatic, of course.

703
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,255
What if we practiced in the morning,

704
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:41,755
and then you could get home
in time for dinner?

705
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:42,671
Yeah!

706
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,713
Yeah, well, it's not just that.

707
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,630
-No?
-No.

708
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,213
-He's worried about the morality of it.
-The morality?

709
00:32:48,296 --> 00:32:51,921
Yes, he says that anyone who wants to be
a cheerleader at my age

710
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,838
is either a slut or a whore.

711
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:56,130
-And probably both.
-[Sheryl laughs]

712
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:58,713
Maybe he should just take
his caveman-like opinions

713
00:32:58,796 --> 00:33:00,463
-and shove them up his you know what.
-Hey!

714
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:03,921
-I mean-- Oh, sorry.
-Alice, we're just a bunch of nice ladies.

715
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:07,380
-looking for some clean, wholesome fun.
-Okay, yes.

716
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:09,046
What do ya say?

717
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:13,005
Well, I always did
want to be a cheerleader.

718
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:14,546
[sighs]

719
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,213
Maybe I could ask him one more time.

720
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:18,130
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

721
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:19,630
-Okay.
-Go on.

722
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,463
[chuckles]

723
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,713
Good luck.

724
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:25,963
-"Good luck." Oh, my gosh.
-[door opens]

725
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:27,963
[door closes]

726
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,713
She's a sweetheart.

727
00:33:29,796 --> 00:33:31,630
She's very sweet.

728
00:33:31,713 --> 00:33:32,838
Very sweet.

729
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:35,671
God, he really loves golf.

730
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,546
-[Martha] He sounds like such an asshole.
-[Sheryl] Okay, here she comes.

731
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,046
So... [chuckles]

732
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,046
[Martha chuckles]

733
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:48,088
-Did you ask him?
-I did.

734
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:50,546
[Sheryl] And? What'd he say?

735
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,296
"Over my dead body!"

736
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,671
[Sheryl laughs]

737
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:54,588
[Alice sighs]

738
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,463
[Martha] Oh, God.
That was fast, wasn't it?

739
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:04,880
A little too fast, if you ask me.

740
00:34:04,963 --> 00:34:06,838
No, he confused his meds.

741
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:09,713
I'm sure Alice didn't want to kill him.

742
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:12,380
Well, she always
wanted to be a cheerleader.

743
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:14,380
Oh, come on. The woman is devastated.

744
00:34:14,463 --> 00:34:17,171
I'm sure it was the last thing
that was on her mind.

745
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:21,005
See you at practice.

746
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:26,505
[indistinct chatter]

747
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:28,463
Hello, everyone!

748
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:29,380
Hi!

749
00:34:29,463 --> 00:34:30,630
-Good morning.
-Hi.

750
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:32,546
-[Phyllis] Morning.
-Wow, look at you all.

751
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,796
I think we should try
something very simple to begin.

752
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:38,421
So, if you don't mind,
I would really enjoy

753
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,296
seeing you getting into a straight line.

754
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:43,921
We're gonna try
some very simple positions.

755
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:44,963
Now, watch me.

756
00:34:45,046 --> 00:34:46,421
So, it's on the count of three.

757
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:48,963
It's one, two, three, boom!

758
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,213
You got that? Straight arms!

759
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:53,755
One, two, three, boom!

760
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:54,671
Jump!

761
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:57,921
Not quite good.

762
00:34:58,005 --> 00:34:59,838
-[chuckling]
-What-- what's the matter?

763
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:00,755
I'm sorry.

764
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:03,296
-[stammers] I have a sore shoulder.
-You can't bend it?

765
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,255
I had to take an aspirin...

766
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:06,713
-Oh!
-Oh, honey!

767
00:35:06,796 --> 00:35:08,171
Can I put this down? I have--

768
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:09,838
Yeah. Okay, that's fine. Good.

769
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:11,880
-I have to be careful!
-[Martha] Hm?

770
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:14,005
I had my knee replaced last year.

771
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:17,046
Well, that's-- No, that's perfectly fine.
You can just bend at your hips.

772
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,213
I can't jump too much 'cause I get dizzy.

773
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,088
When I jump too much, I get dizzy.

774
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:22,171
-You do?
-Yeah.

775
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:26,671
Martha, maybe we should make a list
of everybody's conditions.

776
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:28,005
[unintelligible chatting]

777
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,713
We're not making a list.

778
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:35,713
-You got my dizziness down, right?
-Yeah, got that.

779
00:35:35,796 --> 00:35:36,713
And sciatica.

780
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:39,046
-I have the sciatica.
-Oh, right.

781
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,213
-[Olive] And my wrist.
-Oh!

782
00:35:40,296 --> 00:35:42,213
Did I mention I had chlamydia?

783
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:45,213
Yeah, that and a shocking amount
of other personal information,

784
00:35:45,296 --> 00:35:47,505
so can we get back to rehearsing?

785
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:49,088
But what about you, Martha?

786
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:50,755
Do you have anything to report?

787
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:52,921
No. I'm fine. I'm actually-- I'm--

788
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:54,963
I'm just as fit as a fiddle.

789
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,338
[birds chirping]

790
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:11,463
Uh, hi. Excuse me, are-- are you Martha?

791
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:12,963
And you are who?

792
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:15,505
I'm Tom Lendl. I'm Helen's son.

793
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:17,046
Is everything all right?

794
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,921
Well, no. Uh, it isn't.

795
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:23,088
My mother said she needs $100
for some cheerleading club?

796
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:25,338
Yeah, why is that any of your business?

797
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:26,921
I handle my mother's finances.

798
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:29,213
Well, if Helen has a problem,

799
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,046
she can talk to me,
we'll work something out.

800
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,671
-My mother doesn't need money. Okay?
-Okay.

801
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:36,921
She's got plenty of money.
My father left her... quite a lot.

802
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:38,921
It's up to me to make sure
she spends it wisely.

803
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:39,921
[Martha] Mmm.

804
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:43,380
I'm sure you're aware of the fact
that your mother is an adult.

805
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:45,130
Well, I don't know if you're aware,

806
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:48,088
but this place is a cesspool...

807
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:50,588
-[Martha scoffs]
-...of con artists and salesmen.

808
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:52,713
All trying to take advantage
of gullible old women.

809
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:53,630
It's true!

810
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,421
Thank you, Carl.

811
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,380
I can handle this, okay?

812
00:36:58,546 --> 00:36:59,380
[Martha sighs]

813
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:01,213
One hundred dollars.

814
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:02,838
For what?

815
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:04,921
Uniforms for the Senior Showcase.

816
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:05,963
Uniforms?

817
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:07,421
-Yeah!
-[laughs]

818
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:08,546
Funny?

819
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:10,921
-[scoffs]
-You think that's funny?

820
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:12,588
A little. Yes.

821
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:15,171
Nobody wants to see
a bunch of 80-year-olds

822
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:16,463
running around in short skirts.

823
00:37:16,546 --> 00:37:17,505
Uh-huh.

824
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,755
It's not gonna happen.

825
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:24,338
Let's go.

826
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,213
[answering machine beeps]

827
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,838
[Vicki] <i>Martha, Vicki here.</i>

828
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:41,255
<i>The committee regretfully denies</i>

829
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:45,088
<i>your request for more time to rehearse</i>
<i>in the recreation center.</i>

830
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:47,338
<i>Now, I'm sure you understand.</i>

831
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:51,255
<i>We have to prioritize</i>
<i>the more established clubs</i>

832
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:54,380
<i>-in the lead-up to the Senior Showcase.</i>
-[exhales]

833
00:37:58,421 --> 00:37:59,255
[exhales]

834
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:04,380
So, what's the first thing you're gonna do
when you get your driver's license?

835
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:07,671
-Got any hot dates planned? [chuckles]
-[Ben scoffs]

836
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:10,671
I don't even have a car.

837
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,796
Yeah, so? I mean, get a job and buy one.

838
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,130
-I have a job.
-[Martha] Oh?

839
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:17,796
But most of my money goes to Sheryl
to help out with the rent.

840
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,255
I work at this pizza place.

841
00:38:19,671 --> 00:38:21,338
So, hang on.
Why don't you come work for us?

842
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:23,921
Because we need music in our rehearsals...

843
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:26,046
-[Ben chuckles]
-...and you'd be a great DJ.

844
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:27,921
No, thank you.

845
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,296
-[Martha] Yes!
-I think it's embarrassing enough already.

846
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,046
No, come on.
How about 40 bucks a rehearsal?

847
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:36,921
Huh?

848
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,338
[Martha] I've gotta show you
something, here.

849
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:44,630
Mmm...

850
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:46,005
Look at this!

851
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:47,296
[cheering]

852
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,296
Look at this, we got pom-poms!

853
00:38:49,796 --> 00:38:51,880
Great! Fantastic!

854
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:54,088
[excited chatter]

855
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:57,630
Oh, my goodness! [laughs]

856
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:01,005
[Martha] All right, everybody?
Okay, you ready?

857
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:01,921
Okay, here I go.

858
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:05,588
Now, five, six, seven, eight.

859
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:06,963
Jump one, hold two.

860
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:08,588
Arms three, hold four.

861
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:10,338
Hips five, six.

862
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:12,213
Clap seven, punch eight!

863
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:14,963
Got it? Should we do it again?
Want me to do it one more time for you?

864
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:16,213
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

865
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:17,421
-This is crazy.
-Ready, and...

866
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,421
Jump one!

867
00:39:19,505 --> 00:39:21,255
Hold two, arms three.

868
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:22,713
Hold four.

869
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:25,130
Hips five, six.

870
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,588
Clap seven.

871
00:39:26,671 --> 00:39:27,880
Punch eight!

872
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:29,421
Do you think you have it? All right!

873
00:39:29,505 --> 00:39:31,630
Know what we're gonna do?

so now that he's gone,
I'm gonna give it a shot.

I'm in big trouble at the school.

00:53:47,713 --> 00:53:49,338
but we've seen you. We have.

1220
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,713
You're good.

1221
00:53:50,796 --> 00:53:52,421
-Yeah.
-And we need some of that.

1222
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:55,463
But... [stammers] with school
and cheering, I...

1223
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,880
I just don't have the time.

1224
00:53:57,963 --> 00:54:00,463
-Oh.
-Oh, that's a shame.

1225
00:54:00,546 --> 00:54:01,630
Isn't it, Martha?

1226
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,213
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's a real shame.

1227
00:54:06,296 --> 00:54:09,005
Oh, but you know
what would be a real shame?

1228
00:54:09,088 --> 00:54:10,171
[Sheryl] What's that?

1229
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:15,255
If Chloe's parents found out
about this totally epic party.

1230
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:17,713
Oh, that'd be a terrible shame.

1231
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,213
You wouldn't.

1232
00:54:19,671 --> 00:54:21,130
[laughs] We might.

1233
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:22,713
Try us.

1234
00:54:23,421 --> 00:54:24,630
[groans]

1235
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,588
God.

1236
00:54:28,505 --> 00:54:30,046
[Martha] Good morning, ladies.

1237
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:33,671
What is she doing here?

1238
00:54:34,046 --> 00:54:35,880
This is Chloe, right?

1239
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:39,505
Chloe has something
that she wants to say to everyone.

1240
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:44,880
I was the one who took the video.

1241
00:54:44,963 --> 00:54:46,463
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, come on. Jeez.

1242
00:54:46,546 --> 00:54:48,921
Look, I-I never meant
for it to be posted online,

1243
00:54:49,005 --> 00:54:50,296
and [stammers] I'm sorry.

1244
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:53,796
-I'm really sorry.
-Glad you got that off your chest.

1245
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,130
I'm sorry, but there's more
that Chloe has to say. Go on, Chloe.

1246
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,213
Uh...

1247
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:03,171
And I would really love
to help coach you guys.

1248
00:55:03,255 --> 00:55:04,213
[laughter]

1249
00:55:04,296 --> 00:55:06,296
Why would we let her coach us?

1250
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,463
Because, Olive,
in case you haven't noticed,

1251
00:55:08,546 --> 00:55:10,130
we could do with a little help.

1252
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:12,338
We're not even a club anymore.

1253
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:15,046
-Vicki banned us.
-Oh, forget Vicki!

1254
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,171
-We will practice in secret.
-Practice for what?

1255
00:55:18,255 --> 00:55:19,546
The Showcase is over.

1256
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,505
We're gonna find someplace else
to perform, okay?

1257
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:24,796
We humiliated ourselves. Everybody saw it.

1258
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,130
And that's the reason
why we need to do this.

1259
00:55:27,213 --> 00:55:28,296
To prove we're not some joke

1260
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,421
and to show the world
what we can really do!

1261
00:55:31,463 --> 00:55:32,755
We really can do this

1262
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:35,255
if we do this together.

1263
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:36,796
Huh?

1264
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:45,046
All right, ladies. I want you to look
at your reflection in the mirror, okay?

1265
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,255
What are we doing?

1266
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:49,130
Just look at your reflection, Ruby.

1267
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:53,171
I want you to really, really look
in that mirror,

1268
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:56,713
and take in yourselves, right?

1269
00:55:56,796 --> 00:55:57,838
Look closely.

1270
00:55:58,546 --> 00:56:01,380
We're all so self-conscious,

1271
00:56:01,463 --> 00:56:04,088
and we're all so worried

1272
00:56:04,171 --> 00:56:06,755
about what everyone else is thinking,

1273
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:09,546
when, of course, the only thing
that really matters

1274
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,255
is what we think of ourselves.

1275
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:15,963
Really, I want you to take yourself in.

1276
00:56:16,213 --> 00:56:18,088
Now, on the count of three,

1277
00:56:18,713 --> 00:56:22,130
I want you to say one thing

1278
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:24,130
you like about yourselves.

1279
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:25,380
Oh, gosh.

1280
00:56:26,046 --> 00:56:28,130
You can't be serious.

1281
00:56:28,213 --> 00:56:29,130
My tits!

1282
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:31,130
-Uh, not yet. Not yet.
-[laughter]

1283
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:33,046
Let's wait until the count of three.

1284
00:56:33,546 --> 00:56:35,171
What if you don't like anything?

1285
00:56:36,005 --> 00:56:38,546
Well, what do you mean?
Then you're not looking hard enough.

1286
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:41,755
You just have to find
what's great about yourselves, okay?

1287
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,755
All right. Ready?

1288
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:47,421
Look.

1289
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:53,130
Now...

1290
00:56:53,505 --> 00:56:54,463

1291
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:56,463

So beautiful.

1297
00:57:07,338 --> 00:57:08,380
Thank you.

1298
00:57:08,463 --> 00:57:09,296
[Martha] And?

1299
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,838
My hands.

1300
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:12,463
My hands.

1301
00:57:12,546 --> 00:57:13,421
My smile.

1302
00:57:14,546 --> 00:57:16,921
[Martha] Look at that smile. Okay.

1303
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:18,921
-Damn it.
-And no...

1304
00:57:19,005 --> 00:57:19,963
Okay, my wrist.

-Okay.

-I found another good feature of yours.
-[laughs]

1308
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:29,130
Well...

1309
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,755
But what about me? What's good about me?
There's not one thing.

1310
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:34,213
Oh, stop!

1311
00:57:34,296 --> 00:57:35,880
[laughter]

1312
00:57:35,963 --> 00:57:38,755
[Martha] All right, let's work! Let's go!

1313
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:40,088
[laughing]

1314
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:42,380
-Oh.
-[Martha] Hm?

1315
00:57:42,463 --> 00:57:43,755
-A competition?
-[Martha] Mm-hmm.

1316
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:45,588
[Chloe] This is a really big deal.

1317
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,630
People come from all over to compete.

1318
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:50,088
You guys can't compete
next to real cheerleaders.

1319
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:53,380
-Yes, we can!
-The oldest category is 18 plus!

1320
00:57:53,463 --> 00:57:56,213
-[Martha] Uh-huh.
-So what? We're 18 plus.

1321
00:57:56,296 --> 00:57:57,921
-[Martha] Yeah.
-Eighteen plus 50.

1322
00:57:58,005 --> 00:57:58,838
Yeah.

1323
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:00,338
-Oh, look.
-[Martha] What?

1324
00:58:00,421 --> 00:58:02,088
It's on in three weeks.

1325
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:04,421
Well, that's okay, because
Chloe's gonna help us.

1326
00:58:04,505 --> 00:58:05,380
-Right, Chloe?
-No!

1327
00:58:05,463 --> 00:58:08,255
No, you guys didn't say anything
about a competition!

1328
00:58:08,505 --> 00:58:10,296
Do you know how much training
that involves?

1329
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,421
People train for a year, not three weeks!

1330
00:58:14,588 --> 00:58:15,421
Okay...

1331
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:18,088

a little wider than shoulder width,

01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:03,171
Anyway...

1562
01:08:04,921 --> 01:08:07,171
The doctor says you'll be out tomorrow.

1563
01:08:07,255 --> 01:08:09,713
And once they drain away all the fluid,

1564
01:08:09,796 --> 01:08:11,588
you'll be feeling fine, and...

1565
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:14,338
that's good because
the competition's in three days.

1566
01:08:14,921 --> 01:08:15,755
I'm not going.

1567
01:08:16,213 --> 01:08:18,505
Oh, yes, you are. The hell you're not.

1568
01:08:18,588 --> 01:08:20,963
-No, you don't even need me! What am I--
-Yes, we--

1569
01:08:21,046 --> 01:08:22,796
Of course we need you!

1570
01:08:23,088 --> 01:08:24,255
You're the leader.

1571
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:27,713
And I'm not gonna let you quit
just like that.

1572
01:08:27,796 --> 01:08:29,921
You are coming to the competition

1573
01:08:30,338 --> 01:08:32,421
if I have to drag you there myself.

1574
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,755
I'm dying.

1575
01:08:42,755 --> 01:08:43,588
Well...

1576
01:08:45,546 --> 01:08:48,088
you were dying yesterday, and you're...

1577
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:50,421
you're gonna be dying next week.

1578
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:53,130
And in the meantime,

1579
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:56,130
you should be dancing your ass off.

1580
01:08:57,671 --> 01:08:59,546
Isn't that what this was all about?

1581
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,255
[sniffles]

1582
01:09:03,463 --> 01:09:04,546
I'm scared.

1583
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:08,755
[crying]

1584
01:09:09,463 --> 01:09:11,713
-I'm scared, okay?
-I know, I know.

1585
01:09:11,796 --> 01:09:13,963
I'm sorry, it's just--

1586
01:09:14,046 --> 01:09:16,171
I know you're scared, of course.

1587
01:09:16,838 --> 01:09:18,130
I'm so scared.

1588
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:21,713
Sometimes you just
have to look that shit in the face

1589
01:09:21,796 --> 01:09:23,171
and tell it to go to hell.

1590
01:09:23,546 --> 01:09:24,546
[laughs]

1591
01:09:27,713 --> 01:09:28,713
Thank you.

1592
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,296
-Okay.

1593
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:32,838
Thank you...

[sniffles]

1595
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,130
for being my friend.

1596
01:09:41,255 --> 01:09:43,088
-Your feet are cold.
-I know.

1597
01:10:13,796 --> 01:10:15,838
-I don't think she's coming.
-[Phyllis] Mm-mm.

1598
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:17,963
-[Olive] Yeah, I don't know.
-We're gonna be late.

1599
01:10:18,338 --> 01:10:19,546
Maybe we should just go on--

1600
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:22,546
No, Ruby! You sit your ass down.

1601
01:10:22,796 --> 01:10:25,755
Nobody's going anywhere without Martha.

1602
01:10:26,796 --> 01:10:27,630
[Ruby groans]

1603
01:10:27,713 --> 01:10:28,963
[vehicle approaching]

1604
01:10:29,046 --> 01:10:29,880
It's okay.

1605
01:10:29,963 --> 01:10:30,796
[honking]

1606
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,713
[all] Oh!

1607
01:10:32,713 --> 01:10:33,546
See?

1608
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,546
[Ruby] She's here! What took you so long?

1609
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,838
-Oh, I know. I know, I know.
-Girl, what took you so long?

1610
01:10:37,921 --> 01:10:41,421
-Well, everybody's here.
-No, we got a stop to make.

1611
01:10:42,463 --> 01:10:43,338
Okay?

1612
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:45,463
-We gotta get Helen.
-[Ben] Hey, I--

1613
01:10:46,005 --> 01:10:48,088
[stammering] I can't do this.

1614
01:10:48,171 --> 01:10:49,963
[Martha] Yes, you can.
You're gonna be fine.

1615
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:53,130
And Chloe, why don't you sit in the front
with Ben, okay?

1616
01:10:53,213 --> 01:10:54,421
-All right.
-All right.

1617
01:10:56,921 --> 01:10:58,380
Do you want some free advice?

1618
01:10:58,713 --> 01:10:59,713
Sure.

1619
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:03,505
You cannot wait
for Chloe to notice you, okay?

1620
01:11:03,588 --> 01:11:05,171
What? I'm not!

1621
01:11:05,255 --> 01:11:06,130
Yeah, no, no.

1622
01:11:06,213 --> 01:11:08,796
A girl like that,
she gets a lot of attention,

1623
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,755
and you have to be reckless. Right?

1624
01:11:12,255 --> 01:11:13,088
What does that mean?

1625
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:14,671
It means life is short,

1626
01:11:15,005 --> 01:11:17,046
and make your move already, okay?

1627
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:19,005
