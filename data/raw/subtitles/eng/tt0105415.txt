1
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,677
I was living in this duplex.
For the first time, I was alone.

2
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:22,517
No dorm, no roommates,
my own place. I was so happy.

3
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,772
I had my own parking space.

4
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,334
Where I come from,
they don't keep them in cages.

5
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,214
They keep them in bins, you know,
so you can reach in and touch them.

6
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,567
-Hello.
-Need some help?

7
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,278
No, l...
Well, yeah, thanks.

8
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,706
I'm from Spain.

9
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,502
-Really? Which part?
-Galicia.

10
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,297
I'm taking engineering at U of W.
I like Seattle.

11
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,718
"U-Dub."
That's what people call it here.

12
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,722
Finally, a local tells me
some secrets.

13
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,769
You don't have to stay.
This is gonna take some time.

14
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,188
Where else do I have to go?

15
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:55,568
In one week, I have to go back
to Spain. My visa runs out.

16
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,946
U-Dub.

17
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,314
This is Linda Powell from
the Seattle Environmental Council.

18
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,026
Okay, great. Thank you. Bye-bye.

19
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:40,405
Yes, that's right,
there's another spill in Bellingham.

20
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,450
We gotta get somebody out there...

21
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,328
Ruth, how long have I been saying
there are no guys?

22
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,872
Forever.

23
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,834
I met one. I met one
when I was least expecting it.

24
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,502
You held out on me.

25
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,297
He's an engineering student
from Spain.

26
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,343
His visa runs out in two days. He's...

27
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,513
He's like a comet. What do I do?

28
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,891
I wish you could stay.

29
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:12,187
If I overstay my visa,
I can't come back for five years.

30
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,733
-Were you ever gonna come back?
-Well, now I have a reason.

31
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,073
I want you to have this.

32
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,745
I wish I was better able to tell you
what I am thinking.

33
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:33,792
But this is a symbol of our future.

34
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,633
I want to return in two months
and see you again.

35
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:51,393
I don't really have much
to give you, but...

36
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,021
It's important to me.

37
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,485
Use this when you get back.

38
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,825
You'll always have a parking space.

39
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,924
Hello.

40
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,303
Don't wake up. I'm getting
on the plane. I wanted to say bye.

41
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:34,144
-I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Linda.
-Goodbye, honey. I miss you already.

42
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,275
Did you perform any other acts
with him before he left?

43
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:46,573
It's amazing. We can't hide things
in language. We speak in basics.

44
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,366
"Basics"?

45
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:54,080
If I married him, he could live here.
I'd always have someone to go out with.

46
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,667
You're talking
about marrying this guy?

47
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,129
I'm tired of all the games.

48
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,178
If you were married,
would we still go out dancing?

49
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,098
-We will always go out dancing.
-What?!

50
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:16,019
We will always go out dancing!

51
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:17,163
This is the Genie. Can't go wrong
with this garage-door opener.

52
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,210
Here's the Liftrex and the Liftrex
Super. Might be more than you need.

53
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,588
And, of course,
the Linear pocket pager, beeper...

54
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,342
...garage-door opener combo.

55
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:34,431
Give me the best one you have.
I'll never lose it again.

56
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:51,114
I recently broke up with Jennifer,
my last girlfriend.

57
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,576
I did it in a crowded restaurant.

58
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,205
She just stared at me with that look:
"How can you pass me up?"

59
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,209
I told her we weren't right,
all the stuff we both knew.

60
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,922
I realized I was wrong, tried to get
back with her. She won't see me.

61
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,717
Now she's with Tony.

62
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,890
Tony knows my friend Bailey, who's
friends with Tony's other girl, Rita.

63
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,435
Rita, who I broke up with
to go out with Jennifer.

64
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,397
So do I tell Jennifer I know
Tony's going out with Rita...

65
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,942
...or do I tell Rita I know
about Tony and Jennifer?

66
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,654
Tony will tell Jennifer I was
dating Rita when I was with her.

67
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,408
How does stuff get so complicated?
I don't know.

68
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:41,581
Sometimes I wish it was as simple as
this postcard somebody sent me once.

69
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,671
Isn't that great?

70
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,260
I don't know. I think...

71
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,805
Cliff! I'm talking here, man.

72
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,018
I'm back to the beginning.

73
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,355
My dad left home when I was 8.
He said to me:

74
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,109
"Have fun. Stay single."

75
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,569
I was 8.

76
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,574
My mom's a teacher. She took me
to a doctor to learn about sex.

77
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,909
He was from Boston.

78
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:23,373
The father and the mother
have finally learned to come together.

79
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,502
The father inserts his penis...

80
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,673
You do know what the penis is,
don't you, Steve?

81
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:39,347
The father inserts the penis
into the mother's vagina.

82
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:45,311
This is called intercourse,
and what comes out is called sperm.

83
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:50,650
And then, the man keeps moving until
something squirts out of his penis.

84
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,737
-What?
-Yeah, what comes out?

85
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,407
-Spam!
-Oh, man!

86
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,372
So maybe it was never simple.
I'll tell you this...

87
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:09,627
...for the next three years,
I'm going to concentrate on work.

88
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,715
Work is the only thing
I have complete control over.

89
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,217
Work.

90
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,261
I gotta go.

91
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,460
I'm 23. Remember how old 23
seemed when you were little?

92
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:55,298
I thought people would be traveling
in air locks and I'd have five kids.

93
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,301
Here I am, 23.

94
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,347
Things are...
They're basically the same.

95
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:06,142
I think time's running out
to do something bizarre.

96
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:11,481
Somewhere around 25,
bizarre becomes immature.

97
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,695
I get inspiration from my boyfriend.
He's a musician.

98
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:36,673
His band put out an independent album
last month. He's a good artist too.

99
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,560
He's like a Renaissance man.

100
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,354
I'm so glad he moved into my building.

101
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:14,336
Janet. What's the ordeal?

102
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:19,674
Your machine wasn't on, and I was
supposed to see you Saturday but...

103
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,553
So I just thought I'd come by
and say, hi.

104
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,222
-Hi.
-Hey.

105
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,602
-So how about this weekend?
-This weekend we're really busy.

106
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,063
-We got that show, right?
-Yeah, that show.

107
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,024
-We got these guys coming from L.A.
-Great.

108
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,610
-It's gonna be rocking.
-Bye, Cliff.

109
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,279
-So come over after.
-Deal.

110
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,702
Look, Janet, you know
I see other people still, right?

111
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,872
You do know that, don't you?

112
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,668
You don't fool me.

113
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,004
Janet, I could not
be fooling you less.

114
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,591
Cliff, you gotta move your truck, man.

115
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,761
I know what you're thinking.
We connected.

116
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:09,432
And when you make the connection,
chemistry takes care of itself.

117
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:14,437
So sit back and enjoy it because
you know when it's real. This is real.

118
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,774
We just don't even have to discuss it.

119
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,820
Janet, you're spazzing off on me.

120
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,785
Hey, Cliff, while we're young.

121
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:44,300
So I'll see you Saturday, and then
I'll help you with your speakers.

122
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:51,850
What can I say, man?
She's crazy about me.

123
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,856
Check it out, my new Gortec watch.

124
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,568
I can store 20 numbers.
Tonight, I'll fill it.

125
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,030
All or nothing.
Tonight, I'll be the super me.

126
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:10,035
What if the super you meets the super
her, and the super her rejects you?

127
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,704
-Then it's no problem.
-Why?

128
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:16,458
Because it was never you.
It was just an act.

129
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,921
-I live my life like a French movie.
-What?

130
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,217
Webster and 24th, it should be here.

131
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,680
Let's ask this clown
where the club is.

132
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,808
Hey, man...

133
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,227
...where's De Soto?

134
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,192
I get it, you're a mime.
Mime the address.

135
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:46,237
Well, give me a ride,
and I'll show you.

136
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,908
Where's De Soto? Our car broke down.

137
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:57,248
I'll tell you about love.
Love disappears, baby.

138
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,670
When I've been broke,
babe has been off like a prom dress.

139
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,297
Maybe it's the girls you choose.

140
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,217
Maybe I've been hurt,
or I've been dogged!

141
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:11,304
-Know where this place is?
-Do I look like a Thomas Guide?

142
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,765
-You really shouldn't speak.
-Yes.

143
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,267
-Where do you work?
-I'm a maître d' .

144
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,771
-Department of Transportation.
-Solving the gridlock.

145
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,232
I build airplanes.

146
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,494
-Hey.
-Hello.

147
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,420
My friend and I have this argument,
and here it is.

148
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,256
He says when you're
at a place like this...

149
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,677
...you can't just be yourself,
you need an act.

150
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,471
So anyway, I saw you standing there...

151
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,225
...so I thought,
A: I could just leave you alone.

152
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:26,648
B: I could come up with an act,
or C: I could just be myself.

153
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,192
I chose C.

154
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,861
What do you think?

155
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,324
I think that
A: You have an act...

156
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:41,413
...and that
B: Not having an act is your act.

157
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,917
Thank you.

158
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:57,303
Cliff, any comments on the Seattle
sound and Citizen Dick's place in it?

159
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,266
I don't like to reduce us just
to being part of Seattle.

160
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,810
I think of us expanding more.

161
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,771
We're huge in Europe right now.

162
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:10,942
We've got records...
A big record just broke in Belgium.

163
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:20,660
A song like "Touch Me, I'm Dick"
is about what?

164
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,956
I think "Touch Me, I'm Dick, "
in essence, speaks for itself.

165
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:29,794
I think, you know, that's basically
what the song is about.

166
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,629
It's about, you know...

167
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:35,467
A lot of people might think
it's actually about...

168
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,386
...my name is Dick,
and you can touch me...

169
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:42,140
...but I think, you know,
it can be seen either way.

170
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,644
-Hey, excuse me! Hello.
-Hi.

171
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,439
-Want to meet up later?
-Where you going?

172
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,734
-Anywhere you're going.
-Anywhere you're going.

173
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,819
-We're going home.
-Going home.

174
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,114
-Do you have a...?
-See you.

175
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,326
"Anywhere you're going."

176
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,371
Always get their numbers.
I got 20 numbers.

177
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,914
Twenty numbers.

178
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:10,502
Bailey, you got 20 numbers
of 20 girls that you will never call...

179
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,672
...never go out with,
never see in the daylight.

180
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:18,968
Twenty numbers that exist only to make
you feel like you can get 20 numbers.

181
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,429
-Watch the volume.
-Sorry. Tinnitus.

182
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:25,642
-Club disease.
-You kids are all going to be deaf.

183
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,018
Bailey.

184
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,729
This is my night.

185
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,107
-What?
-Look.

186
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:36,194
Linda, don't look over.

187
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:25,452
Cliff, I need another double latte,
no cream, skim milk, decaf.

188
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:29,831
I'm going to use that video date
you got me last Christmas.

189
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,625
-It was a joke.
-I know. I know.

190
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:37,047
You think it's something desperate
people do. You are wrong!

191
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:41,634
Expect the Best is the best
video-dating in the country. Hi!

192
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,554
Debbie Hunt.
Call me before I go to Cabo.

193
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,891
-Your medication, Miss Hunt.
-Thank you.

194
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:52,479
You make the greatest coffee.
Doesn't he make...? You...

195
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:56,691
My roommate has no domestic...
Guys just don't know...

196
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,406
-Did you get the tunnel stuff?
-I'll call you back.

197
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:07,869
The l-90 construction is behind.
No green time from the exits.

198
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:11,331
The Times asked why
there's gridlock on the l-5.

199
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,709
It's God's way of saying,
"Listen to the radio."

200
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,504
Did you read my proposal?
What'd you think?

201
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,423
I liked it.
You have to move it past Stu.

202
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,800
-Stu?
-After lunch.

203
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,552
After lunch, okay. After lunch, Stu.

204
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:28,014
-Ted, what's up?
-Making music with my fingers.

205
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,518
And what a beautiful sound it is.

206
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:44,239
Linda Powell, Steve Dunne. Hey.

207
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:48,785
Yeah, I met you 61 hours ago.
Yeah, that was me.

208
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:51,955
Listen, you want to get
some dinner or...?

209
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:55,417
Busy. How about some lunch?
Have a lunch.

210
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,127
Coffee?

211
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:00,588
Water? How about some water?

212
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:05,385
I'll meet you where you're having
lunch, and we'll have some water.

213
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,639
I think that this whole decade
will be about cleaning up.

214
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,019
Our project spent last year studying
the Alaskan Exxon spill.

215
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:20,400
And now... And now
with all the Exxon kickbacks, it's...

216
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,903
-God, yes. The worst.
-Yes.

217
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,908
I'm trying to put together a group
to go study the whole coast.

218
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,454
I'm having a little trouble
trying to get a boat.

219
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,581
I think it will work out.

220
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:42,964
-What?
-There's just no privacy anymore.

221
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,844
I thought he was literally
gonna swallow her.

222
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,263
-Me too.
-My God.

223
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,515
Do you know what time it is?

224
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,684
-Yeah, 3:30.
-Oh, I'm so late.

225
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,021
-I'm glad your lunch date didn't show.
-Me too.

226
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,858
-Did you really have a lunch date?
-No.

227
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,153
-Maybe...
-I'm getting over somebody.

228
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,990
-Nothing big.
-I think it's a bad time to get...

229
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,909
-Okay.
-Okay.

230
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:15,121
Here's my car.
Let me give you a ride back to work.

231
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,750
Okay. Thanks.

232
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,383
Thanks.

233
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,153
I really like your take
on the supertrain.

234
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,115
It's ambitious.
If it were up to me...

235
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:54,786
She opened my car-door button.
Unmistakable sign.

236
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,163
I like this girl.

237
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,874
Gotta handle this one really well.

238
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:04,212
The thing I like about you the best
is that you listen to me.

239
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:09,384
-You're a realist-slash-dreamer.
-Thanks.

240
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,931
I get so pissed off
when I think about it.

241
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:21,771
That some jerk could trash the Mona
Lisa or an ocean or someone's life.

242
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:26,526
So who are your neighbors?

243
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:31,239
That's Bailey, right there.
He's a maître d' .

244
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:34,075
He keeps us all on free meals.

245
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:38,413
And on the corner there,
that's Debbie Hunt.

246
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,335
She actually consumes men
instead of food.

247
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:50,425
And that is Cliff.
He delivers flowers, has four jobs...

248
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,678
...works in the coffee shop
around the corner.

249
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:56,139
Upstairs is Janet Livermore.

250
00:25:56,306 --> 00:26:00,226
She works there too. She's
saving for architecture school.

251
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,687
Cliff and Janet.

252
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,525
That's it.

253
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,655
You sound like me talking
about my family.

254
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:17,160
Wanna go upstairs
while your stuff is still drying?

255
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,971
That's a good picture of you.

256
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:41,351
Let me ask you a question.
You think about traffic?

257
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:47,232
Because I do, constantly. Traffic
is caused by the single car driver.

258
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:51,069
900,000 single people
get in their cars every morning.

259
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:54,280
They drive and wonder why
there's gridlock.

260
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:58,535
This is what I've been working on.
If you had a supertrain...

261
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:04,207
...you give people a reason to get out
of their cars. Coffee, great music...

262
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:07,210
...they will park and ride.
I know they will.

263
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:10,046
But I still love my car, though.

264
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,382
Well... Oh.

265
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:17,053
The Sonics.
They've got a good team this year.

266
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,848
Good thing they traded
Xavier McDaniel.

267
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:24,477
-Is he a boxer or a basketball player?
-You dare to rip the X-Man.

268
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:30,734
"Kiss at the Hotel de Ville."
You have this too. I have this.

269
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,113
And albums.
Oh, I miss albums.

270
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:41,327
-I was a deejay in college.
-Really?

271
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:44,456
That's why I still have records.

272
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,765
So any boyfriends?

273
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:05,352
You don't want to know.
I've had bad luck.

274
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:11,608
But there was this one guy, Rich.
All my girlfriends loved him.

275
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,737
That stuff I told you
about the money I inherited?

276
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,949
I made that up. Plus, I got
back together with Lynn last night.

277
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:23,286
So you probably want to go ahead
and freak out.

278
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:31,044
Oh, man. That was
like a professional hit.

279
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,714
I didn't wanna get close
to anybody for a long time.

280
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:35,965
And then l...

281
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,635
-I'm talking too much.
-No, go ahead.

282
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:42,639
Well, I thought for sure I would
meet someone in college.

283
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:47,852
A perfect combination of Mel Gibson
and Holden Caulfield...

284
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:52,691
...and the sexual revolution
would just sweep us both away.

285
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:55,235
I was a semester too late.

286
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,133
Hi.

287
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,521
Condoms. They're free.

288
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:45,493
You know, it's okay
to loathe these people.

289
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,537
Really?

290
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:52,542
There is so much life in you.

291
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:57,756
And so much emotional larceny
in these others.

292
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:03,470
-I'm Andy.
-I'm Linda.

293
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,638
Emotional larceny?

294
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:10,935
We talked about how passion didn't
matter as much as comfort, stability.

295
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:13,146
-That's bullshit.
-No kidding.

296
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,607
-Sorry.
-It's cool.

297
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:22,113
We lived together for two years.
We're still friends, but...

298
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,948
I did the same thing.

299
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:28,161
One day, one of you goes
for groceries and never comes back.

300
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,498
Everyone I know wants
everything to be easy.

301
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:36,086
-Why did I have to meet you in a club?
-I don't know.

302
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:41,800
Oh, I love this song.

303
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,820
My clothes.

304
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:06,825
This is you?

305
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:10,245
This gas-guzzling monster?
The environmentalist?

306
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:13,623
-I inherited it.
-Not sure how I feel about that.

307
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:19,629
So let's maybe do something
this weekend or...

308
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,674
-Okay. I'll call you.
-Okay. Don't forget.

309
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:24,134
I won't.

310
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,600
Good night.

311
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,072
Good night.

312
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:48,408
Good night.

313
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,291
Listen, next time, why don't you...

314
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:00,045
...park underground?

315
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,718
I should go.

316
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,877
Grab whatever you can.
Keep whatever you want.

317
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:44,798
It's all yours free,
only at Shop for Less.

318
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:07,445
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

319
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:30,510
Burglar, burglar, burglar,
burglar, burglar.

320
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:54,117
Neighbors.

321
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:58,663
It's Andy. Just calling
to make sure you're okay.

322
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,583
I was thinking about the conversation.

323
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,627
Trust him, although
he's putting on moves.

324
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,756
Passive-aggressively speaking.
I'm a guy.

325
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:10,842
I don't like that I know them,
but I know.

326
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:15,013
I think that you can trust him,
but you certainly want to...

327
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,725
If he doesn't treat you right,
I'll kick his ass.

328
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:23,146
Starring Fred MacMurray.

329
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:30,487
Can you wait?
Just a little longer. Okay?

330
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:34,824
-Whenever, whenever.
-You're amazing.

331
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:38,912
I feel like I'm being pulled
inside you.

332
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,123
We're being too loud.

333
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:49,297
What are you thinking
right now?

334
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,219
I play good, hard-nosed basketball.

335
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:57,389
Things happen in the game.
Nothing you can do.

336
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:00,892
I don't go and say,
"I'm gonna beat this guy up."

337
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:04,938
-Anything else, X?
-Yes. Steve, don't come yet.

338
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:27,377
God, I'm in love with my neighbor.
Why don't you call me, Cliff?

339
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:34,759
What can I eat? I'm tired
of starving myself for this guy.

340
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,887
Salad. I'll have a salad.

341
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:45,520
If I call him, that's being desperate.

342
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:51,192
He's late or he forgot. I refuse to
call him to remind him he forgot.

343
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,030
If he shows up, I'll listen.
No way do I call him.

344
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:59,993
Of course, men do like to be called.

345
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,582
I'll call him in 10 minutes. That will
be one hour, and that is very late.

346
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:11,880
He is offiicially very late.

347
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:19,596
If I make this basket,
that's fate telling me to call him.

348
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,724
Two out of three.

349
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:32,275
Wait. Did no basket mean call him
or don't call him?

350
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:40,408
Busy. That's a sign.
That's fate saying don't call.

351
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:45,246
Forget it. I am not desperate. I have
many people to spend time with.

352
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:50,293
-Quit getting involved with neighbors.
-That broke us up?

353
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,796
-We're better as friends.
-Absolutely.

354
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:57,050
The thing about Cliff is,
he has all this fierce integrity.

355
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,552
-I know.
-Except when it comes to women.

356
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,722
He likes these club-type women...

357
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:05,892
...these huge, hourglass,
Amazon women.

358
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:11,398
It's great you're together,
but you've got to protect yourself.

359
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:15,402
So I'm not an Amazon woman?

360
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:19,948
You're from the high plains, Janet.

361
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:28,123
I'm so glad I live here.

362
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:52,022
-Are my breasts too small for you?
-No.

363
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,525
God.

364
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:07,704
Because, I mean, I look around,
and all I see are these...

365
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:13,126
...posters and billboards
and magazines and TV shows...

366
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:16,171
...all with these women
with huge breasts.

367
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:19,507
I guess I just...
I guess I just wanted to ask.

368
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:23,261
Is that what men really want?
Is that what you want?

369
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,637
You know?

370
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:30,018
Don't lie because when you do, your
eye twitches, and I know it anyway.

371
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,817
Okay, ask me.

372
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:42,447
Are my breasts too small for you?

373
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:51,373
Sometimes.

374
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,144
Have you had implants before?

375
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:16,231
What do you think?

376
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,692
No.

377
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:24,280
Yes. Well, you take a couple of days
and make up your mind.

378
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:27,867
We skew the size specifically
to what you want...

379
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:30,620
...by graph. Right.

380
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,956
Well, what's painful?

381
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:37,752
It can be mildly painful, and certainly
safety is on everybody's mind...

382
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:40,005
...mine in particular.

383
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:45,885
Right. Okay, you take a couple
of days and think about it.

384
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:49,222
All right. Bye-bye.

385
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,350
-Hi.
-Hi.

386
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:56,855
Heard you on the phone. I'm in.
I don't need a couple of days.

387
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:02,068
How about that?

388
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:16,124
Maybe for your frame,
something a little less hourglass.

389
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:21,755
If you're going to have the operation,
you know, have the operation.

390
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:30,096
-Whoa. Do you jog?
-A little.

391
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:34,184
See, maybe, here.

392
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:40,106
-Split the difference?
-Split the difference.

393
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:08,176
Hi, it's me.
I'm tired of doing the right thing.

394
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:11,638
I'm tired of waiting for you
to call me.

395
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:17,852
I'm on the bed right now, wearing
something really outrageous.

396
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:21,606
I've got no underwear on.

397
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:26,361
I need to be touched.
I'm burning for you, Cliff.

398
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:31,825
I think you've got the wrong number,
lady, but I'll be right over.

399
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,294
-This guy plays no games.
-That's great.

400
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:44,754
Yeah.

401
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:48,341
-I've got to play this one perfectly.
-Go with it.

402
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:52,012
-What do your instincts say?
-Not to listen to you guys.

403
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:55,432
-There you go.
-Don't tug at her bra strap.

404
00:41:55,598 --> 00:42:00,395
She wants mystery, drama, excitement.
I know women.

405
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:04,774
I don't want drama or excitement.
I just want to trust him.

406
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:08,987
-Should I trust him?
-Yeah.

407
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:13,533
-Not all guys are like Luiz.
-You're right.

408
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,911
You're right. Steve is different.

409
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,499
Just follow your instincts.
Don't treat this like casual sex.

410
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,254
Casual sex doesn't even exist anymore.
It's lethal. It's over.

411
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,845
What are you thinking?

412
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:39,476
If I had a conversation with God,
I would ask him to create this girl.

413
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:42,228
My chest hurts.

414
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:46,566
-You didn't, like, leave a note?
-No, I left my blue T-shirt.

415
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:49,861
-There are no mistakes.
-What?

416
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,656
What is that? What's that mean?
Give me the phone.

417
00:42:53,865 --> 00:42:58,703
I'm going to call my
new semigirlfriend.

418
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,414
You're gonna scare her off.

419
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:04,542
She's beautiful.
Anyone would call her.

420
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:08,505
-Distinguish yourself by not calling.
-Yep.

421
00:43:08,713 --> 00:43:13,218
-P.S., that's how you get her.
-No, Bailey, you don't understand.

422
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:18,181
Am I the only one that remembers
your last three girlfriends?

423
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,977
You're right.

424
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:28,149
I gotta let this one breathe.

425
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:34,489
Yes. You're concerned about dioxins.
Let me give you Greenpeace's number.

426
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:41,913
-So how'd it go?
-I got the boat.

427
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:45,333
-The trip to Alaska's set.
-Oh, great, Linda.

428
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:48,336
-That is great.
-Yeah.

429
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:55,927
-Oh, Steve on two.
-Four days he waits to call me.

430
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:58,847
So, what do I tell him?

431
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:03,018
-Tell him I went out for groceries.
-Okay.

432
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:05,937
She went out for groceries.

433
00:44:06,187 --> 00:44:09,107
Bye-bye.

434
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:11,943
He's coming right over.

435
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:14,779
-What do you mean, nothing?
-Nothing is wrong.

436
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:17,907
Really. Thanks.

437
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:20,994
-We connected.
-This is a small office.

438
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:24,330
-Is this because I didn't call?
-Did you call?

439
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:28,043
I don't know why you're
being like this. I like you.

440
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:31,588
I'll call you, or you call me.

441
00:44:38,636 --> 00:44:44,642
-I'm sorry if I blew it by not calling.
-You don't owe me anything.

442
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:48,355
-Is this about your ex who calls?
-Andy doesn't.

443
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:49,898
-Ponytail, right?
-No.

444
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:54,527
-Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.
-He is not Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.

445
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:04,120
-You're scared of getting close to me.
-You don't know me.

446
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:07,457
-I think I do.
-No, you don't.

447
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:11,961
Look, let's not play games.

448
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,925
Games? If I was playing games,
I would have waited a week to call.

449
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,263
-What I mean is...
-I've gotta work, Steve.

450
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:26,434
-Linda? I left my blue T-shirt at...
-Bye, Steve.

451
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:41,491
Why? Why do you talk such a good game?

452
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:48,289
You talk about things that matter,
that get me excited, that get me hot.

453
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,131
But it's like you're lobotomized.
Why can't I just protect myself?

454
00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:01,052
Why can't I just be a buddy?

455
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:06,099
Glad I caught this one in time.
I can't leave myself open.

456
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:08,560
It's better to be the dumper.

457
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:11,896
Mom... Mom! Yeah.

458
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:17,110
Listen, Mom, if he invited you
to Hawaii, yes, he wants something.

459
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,741
And who cares?
Dad's been gone for two years.

460
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:26,119
Listen. Listen, Mom!

461
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:30,915
I'm having a bad sugar crash.
Do you think you could hold it down?

462
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:36,129
Wait, Mom. Rinse your dishes before
you put them in the dishwasher.

463
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,006
I rinsed them, Debbie.

464
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:41,760
You have to rinse off
the food or it gets all over.

465
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:46,639
I found this big, little chunky thing
on my glass. No biggie.

466
00:46:46,806 --> 00:46:51,936
So. Yeah, wish me luck on my video
for Expect the Best.

467
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:02,155
Hi.

468
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:05,992
-This is for Expect the Best, right?
-I brought clippings.

469
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,244
Possible looks for my video.

470
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:12,749
Here we have
the Edie Sedgwick. You know?

471
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,420
Pseudo-Brigitte Bardot.

472
00:47:18,004 --> 00:47:23,843
Or we jet on over to Spain
for the depressed millionairess.

473
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:30,475
And I love these earrings
that nobody loves but me.

474
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:33,019
Truth?

475
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:35,522
Truth.

476
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:44,030
I will create your new look.
I will have men dying at your feet.

477
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:48,118
Ten bucks extra,
and Brian will shoot your video.

478
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:53,873
Twenty.

479
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:58,128
He doesn't even know me.

480
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:00,338
Debbie...

481
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:04,759
...he is only like the next
Martin Scor-ceese.

482
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:09,681
Okay. Okay, I'm in your hands.

483
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:22,318
I am Debbie Hunt.

484
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:26,573
If you want to see how I look,
rewind and freeze-frame.

485
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:30,744
But I am not about looks.

486
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,376
Hi.

487
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:42,380
I crave responsibility,
respectability and love.

488
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:48,219
My goals are serenity and knowledge
and men who can understand me.

489
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:51,348
Oh, no druggies, please.

490
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:55,935
I'm fairly intense, and
I'm an advertising exec...

491
00:48:56,102 --> 00:49:01,649
...at KRWE-TV. That's me.

492
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:07,697
Come to where the flavor is.
Come to Debbie country.

493
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:19,167
Yeah.

494
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:24,005
"Debbie country." It's funny.

495
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:34,307
-"Doghouse" as an encore?
-Six songs.

496
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:37,519
-They want me.
-They are just our friends.

497
00:49:37,727 --> 00:49:41,773
-"Doghouse" as an encore.
-You can't start out with that.

498
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,526
Why make them clap
so we come out again?

499
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:47,320
-You don't get it.
-I agree with Cliff.

500
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:51,408
-Hey, a review of our record.
-Whoa, read it out loud.

501
00:49:51,616 --> 00:49:54,327
"When the shirtless Cliff
starts to sing..."

502
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:59,666
Wait a minute, man. I don't
want to hear anything negative.

503
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,085
Go on.

504
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:27,193
Other than that, "He was ably backed
by Stone and Jeff...

505
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:31,531
...and drummer Eddie Vedder."
That's good. That's a good review.

506
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:36,619
-A compliment for us is one for you.
-No, man.

507
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:40,373
This negative energy
just makes me stronger.

508
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,085
We will not retreat.
This band is unstoppable.

509
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:47,797
This weekend, we rock Portland.

510
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:50,925
Yeah!

511
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:58,683
Okay, are you sure
you want to do this?

512
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:02,395
Yep. My mind is made up.

513
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:05,148
Want to read a magazine?

514
00:51:05,398 --> 00:51:08,651
Thanks for doing this with me, Steve.

515
00:51:08,943 --> 00:51:11,696
I didn't want you to go alone.

516
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:26,878
Tell me, from a girl's point of view,
what do you want from a guy?

517
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:31,424
Well, when I first moved
out here from Tucson...

518
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:34,719
...I wanted a guy with...

519
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:39,432
...Iooks, security, caring.

520
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:42,310
Someone with their own place.

521
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:47,232
Someone who said "bless you"
or "gesundheit" when I sneezed.

522
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:51,444
Someone who liked the same
things as me, but not exactly.

523
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:54,322
And someone who loves me.

524
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:58,952
-Tall order.
-Yeah, I scaled it down a little.

525
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,621
What is it now?

526
00:52:01,996 --> 00:52:06,459
Someone who says "gesundheit, "
although I prefer "bless you."

527
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,378
It's nicer.

528
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:12,382
-Janet, sorry you had to wait.
-Dr. Jamison.

529
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:14,759
This is my friend, Steve.

530
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,179
-Doctor.
-Hi, Steve. Come on in.

531
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:21,516
Hey, last chance.

532
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:28,398
Here we go.

533
00:52:28,606 --> 00:52:32,193
I'm going to say something
that I haven't said...

534
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:36,156
...in three years of being an HMO.

535
00:52:36,948 --> 00:52:41,703
I will perform the operation,
but I don't think you need it.

536
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:43,830
I think you're perfect.

537
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:49,711
If your boyfriend doesn't appreciate
you the way you are, then ask:

538
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:55,008
"Are you his Miss Right,
or are you his Miss Maybe?"

539
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:57,719
Wow.

540
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:00,513
What's that mean, "wow"?

541
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:04,476
-Did my check bounce?
-No.

542
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:06,311
Janet...

543
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:10,648
...I really have
a feeling about you.

544
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:16,613
Thanks, but I love my boyfriend.

545
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:18,782
Okay.

546
00:53:19,824 --> 00:53:24,496
-I still feel good about what I said.
-Oh, no, you should. It's good.

547
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:31,169
-Can I say something to you?
-Sure.

548
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:34,881
Your face wants
a different part, your hair.

549
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:39,094
-My hair?
-Yeah.

550
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,640
Yeah, there you go.

551
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:46,017
Now you look vaguely rocking.

552
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:49,020
You are a happening guy, you know?

553
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:51,981
You're Dr. Jamison.

554
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:58,405
You've got nice eyes, and you've got
those great trustworthy eyebrows...

555
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:02,951
...and you're a surgeon, man.
Many, many babes are into that.

556
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:04,994
Yeah.

557
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:07,539
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

558
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:12,794
No, really. Listen, I have friends
who would love you.

559
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:15,505
See, I don't know how to have fun.

560
00:54:15,755 --> 00:54:20,135
I'm 33 years old, and I don't
know how to have fun.

561
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:30,103
There. Now was that fun or what?

562
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,939
Yeah, that was fun.

563
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:51,374
-Doc.
-Yeah, I know, the operation.

564
00:54:56,463 --> 00:55:00,133
I want Cliff to like me the way I am.

565
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:04,929
Thanks.

566
00:55:08,558 --> 00:55:13,355
A few days later, she leaves the hive.
Now she's ready to mate.

567
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:18,943
High in the sky, the only
male bees, the drones...

568
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:22,697
So Portland, maybe it wasn't our city.

569
00:55:22,947 --> 00:55:26,368
Man, where are the anthems
of our youth?

570
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:30,080
What happened to music
that meant something?

571
00:55:30,246 --> 00:55:33,917
The Who at the Kingdome
or Kiss at the Coliseum.

572
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:40,715
Where is the "Misty Mountain Hop"?
Where is the "Iron Man" of today?

573
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:45,387
-We're not going out tonight, are we?
-Look at this.

574
00:55:45,553 --> 00:55:52,227
These bands are bottles of bleach.
It's beer and lifestyle music.

575
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:56,898
It's like the next world war's
gonna be sponsored by...

576
00:55:57,148 --> 00:55:59,984
...I don't know, I mean, what?

577
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:03,363
We could just take a bath.

578
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:08,952
Just remember one thing,
we are loved in Belgium and in Italy.

579
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,622
The yellow jacket wasp
has come looking for food.

580
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:15,709
The alarm is sounded.

581
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:30,015
Hey, babe, don't get me sick.
I'm playing this weekend...

582
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:37,564
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

583
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:44,195
I don't have to be here.
I could just break up with him.

584
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:55,957
I've always been able to do this.
Break up and never look back.

585
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:05,050
Being alone,
there's a certain dignity to it.

586
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:41,419
Hi!

587
00:57:41,586 --> 00:57:46,549
Hi, did I overreact?

588
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,135
Do you know who this is?

589
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:23,670
We spent a couple
of great weeks together.

590
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:30,427
But whenever things are at their best,
I start waiting for them to fall apart.

591
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:36,641
I can't fiigure out if I do it to myself
or if life does it for me.

592
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:42,647
-I'm a bit late this month, that's all.
-Well, how...? How late?

593
00:58:44,774 --> 00:58:46,484
Late.

594
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:07,380
-Steve Dunne.
-Yeah.

595
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:09,966
Doug Hughley. Mr. Deegan's class.

596
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:14,429
-What is up? How you doing, man?
-Okay, man.

597
00:59:14,637 --> 00:59:17,682
You know how much homework
I missed because of you?

598
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:22,228
I loved your radio show.
That was the best. Thanks, man.

599
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:26,941
We're throwing down tonight
on Aloha Street. It's gonna be insane.

600
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:29,903
-Would you do some wheels of steel?
-Oh, no.

601
00:59:30,153 --> 00:59:31,696
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

602
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:37,077
You're the only man I know who can mix
Elvis Costello and Public Enemy.

603
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:50,090
You're the best, man!
You are the king.

604
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:54,177
You gotta be there, man.
You must be there!

605
00:59:55,303 --> 00:59:58,139
Of course, you may be busy.

606
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:04,604
Ten minutes and we pour
X into B. If it's blue...

607
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:08,566
-Then we have a big talk.
-Yeah.

608
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:18,201
-I have some time right now.
-Then let's talk right now.

609
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:22,205
-My body knows it's going to be blue.
-It's not gonna be blue.

610
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:24,624
-It won't be blue.
-You're right.

611
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:29,087
I'm probably sterile.
It runs in my family.

612
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:36,720
-Do you know where my other shoes are?
-No, maybe they're by the door.

613
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:39,305
-That would be wild.
-What?

614
01:00:39,514 --> 01:00:42,017
Having a kid.

615
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:47,147
-lf you were pregnant.
-lf I were pregnant, but I'm not.

616
01:00:47,355 --> 01:00:51,526
And I would not expect you
to deal with it anyway.

617
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:55,238
Well, I'd be with you.
We'd deal with it.

618
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,536
To friendship.

619
01:01:08,918 --> 01:01:12,172
-That's bluish, right?
-It's fairly blue.

620
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:15,008
-Well...
-Put it against something blue.

621
01:01:15,258 --> 01:01:18,219
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

622
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:22,807
Well, wait. Let's try and put it
against something white.

623
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:32,442
-What are you gonna do today?
-Meet the deputy mayor.

624
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:38,365
-Sets up the thing with the real mayor.
-I have stuff to do. Do, or call you...

625
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:39,949
-Okay.
-Bye.

626
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,619
-Bye.
-Bye.

627
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:47,749
-Finally...
-Interesting.

628
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:54,214
...if we get the single car driver on
the supertrain, we can change the city.

629
01:01:54,464 --> 01:01:57,217
It's all in the proposal.

630
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:07,018
Well, flirts with brilliance.
Wish it were up to me.

631
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:10,980
Let me get you 15 minutes
with the mayor.

632
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:12,982
Thank you.

633
01:02:14,192 --> 01:02:19,364
Basically, that's kind of what
we're all about, give or take a little.

634
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:25,036
I'd kind of like to leave it up to you.
Figure out what you'd like to do.

635
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:30,250
I think that will be great. Yeah.
You've explained it really well.

636
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:35,839
All right, these
are the men who want me.

637
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:40,593
But I'm more than just a good body.
Feelings, man.

638
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:45,223
I have a lot of tender feelings
waiting for the right woman.

639
01:02:45,473 --> 01:02:49,644
It's hard to get it across
when you look like this.

640
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:54,983
My name is Spiro. I'm an artist.
My painting is displayed behind me.

641
01:02:55,233 --> 01:03:00,447
I'm a very meticulous person
in appearance and also very precise.

642
01:03:00,655 --> 01:03:03,742
If two people really
believe in each other...

643
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:07,704
...love can go around the world
and through their souls.

644
01:03:07,912 --> 01:03:09,998
But love is very delicate.

645
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:14,544
In fact, if you're both not very
nurturing, that love can:

646
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:17,964
I'm looking for a woman
who is unpredictable.

647
01:03:18,214 --> 01:03:22,761
Someone who is complex.
Someone who is willing to experiment.

648
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:26,056
I like the way the world
looks from a bicycle.

649
01:03:26,222 --> 01:03:31,227
I'm looking for someone who feels
the same way I do about a bicycle.

650
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:35,106
Am I too intense?
I can be intensely laid-back too.

651
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:40,653
I am very, very, very lonely.

652
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:51,498
-Who?
-Definitely the bicycle guy.

653
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,625
The bicycle guy.

654
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:56,920
He's like your soul mate.

655
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:58,755
Guy with the bicycle.

656
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:20,068
Nice outfit.

657
01:04:20,443 --> 01:04:23,196
-Is he late?
-Yeah.

658
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:27,784
-Yeah, but I expect the best.
-Yeah.

659
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:32,706
Why did you pick this Sea Merchant?
The First Avenue one is happening.

660
01:04:32,872 --> 01:04:36,292
-There's another Sea Merchant?
-Yeah, the new one.

661
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:38,128
Oh, no.

662
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:42,090
-On your right!
-On your right!

663
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,761
-On your right!
-On your right!

664
01:05:00,942 --> 01:05:04,195
Was there a Jamie
looking for a Debbie Hunt?

665
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:07,198
Yes, and he left you a message:

666
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:11,828
"I got your address from Expect
the Best. I'll be at your house."

667
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:14,914
He was hot.

668
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:30,638
Desperation, it's the world's
worst cologne.

669
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:35,226
-Lot of salt.
-You are good at that.

670
01:05:35,393 --> 01:05:37,687
-This is the key to popcorn.
-Is it?

671
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:40,815
-Swirl with the bowl.
-Good, put the bowl down.

672
01:05:40,982 --> 01:05:43,610
-Let's make some more.
-You want more?

673
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:46,071
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

674
01:05:57,749 --> 01:06:00,585
-More popcorn.
-Stop, stop, stop.

675
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:02,962
-What, what, what?
-Stop, stop, stop.

676
01:06:03,129 --> 01:06:05,215
-Want more?
-How does this work?

677
01:06:06,007 --> 01:06:08,760
-Do you want butter?
-Do I want butter?

678
01:06:08,927 --> 01:06:10,178
-Hi.
-Hi.

679
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:12,222
-Debbie.
-Jamie.

680
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:17,310
-Wow, you represent well in real life.
-Thanks a lot. So do you.

681
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:18,770
Thank you.

682
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:22,315
When I missed you,
I just buzzed down.

683
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:25,610
Look who I ran into,
Pammy from U-Dub.

684
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:28,530
-Pamela. I'm Pamela.
-Oh, you're Pamela.

685
01:06:28,738 --> 01:06:33,243
Pam-ela, did you see that package
out on the porch for you?

686
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:38,748
-No, Jamie and l, we're making popcorn.
-Yeah, popcorn with Kermit.

687
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:42,919
I would love to show you
this package on the porch.

688
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:46,464
-Just for a second.
-Okay. All right.

689
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:47,966
-Okay.
-See you.

690
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:49,426
Sure.

691
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:56,474
-We always said, separate lives, Pam.
-It's no biggie, all right?

692
01:06:56,641 --> 01:06:59,978
-It's a major biggie!
-Look, I knew him first.

693
01:07:00,186 --> 01:07:03,898
I guess that gives you the right
to bone him in my kitchen.

694
01:07:04,649 --> 01:07:08,445
If I wanted that guy,
I wouldn't need a video date.

695
01:07:08,653 --> 01:07:11,948
You'd wait for me to meet him
and then make popcorn!

696
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:17,412
-I make popcorn with whomever I want.
-You've done it with half the city!

697
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:20,498
At least I don't have to chase
the popcorn.

698
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:26,463
I don't think we should
take this vacation together.

699
01:07:26,629 --> 01:07:30,675
Remember how you told me to
tell you when you're being plastic?

700
01:07:30,925 --> 01:07:33,011
This is so unfair.

701
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:35,889
-How much do you want for him?
-$200.

702
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:38,808
-Outrageous.
-That's what I paid.

703
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:40,435
-Seventy-five.
-150.

704
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:42,645
80 and I'll do the dishes all month.

705
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:43,855
-Deal.
-Deal.

706
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:45,106
-Fine.
-Fine.

707
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:54,491
-We need to talk.
-I think we do.

708
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:56,659
There's something I need to say.

709
01:07:56,826 --> 01:07:59,204
-Let's get married...
-You want out.

710
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:03,083
Everyone's together
for the wrong reasons...

711
01:08:03,249 --> 01:08:07,545
...or they bail out.
This is life telling us something.

712
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:09,214
-Oh, God.
-What?

713
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:12,175
Don't make me remember
this chilidog.

714
01:08:12,425 --> 01:08:16,930
Remember it. Make that
a historic chilidog.

715
01:08:17,305 --> 01:08:20,392
Take your time. Think about it.

716
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:26,940
You don't even have to use words,
just take a bite if the answer is yes.

717
01:08:30,985 --> 01:08:33,113
-I want to be logical.
-Okay.

718
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,949
Say we're married, we have the kid...

719
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:41,162
...will we be anything like we are now?
It's like the great unknown.

720
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:45,792
I've got that coastal trip to Alaska,
and you've got your thing.

721
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:51,214
I want to be logical. I think
I can love you and still be logical.

722
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:55,093
What? What is that look?

723
01:08:55,802 --> 01:09:00,724
Someone who really cares about you
must scare you to death.

724
01:09:02,058 --> 01:09:05,103
Forget logic.

725
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:08,273
What's in your heart?

726
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:14,070
I want to do it.

727
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:18,116
-This is life telling us something.
-So that's a yes?

728
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:20,994
Yes.

729
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:26,291
-You're gonna feel good about this.
-Oh, really?

730
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:33,131
Mom, I wanna get out!
Mom, can't we get out?

731
01:09:33,548 --> 01:09:37,052
-Did we make the right decision?
-I don't know.

732
01:09:37,218 --> 01:09:39,804
Please, Mom!

733
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:41,056
-Yes.
-Yes.

734
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:42,307
-Yes.
-Yes.

735
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:46,853
Xavier McDaniel
made the All-Star team.

736
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:49,814
-Why does he pick fights with players?
-Like?

737
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:52,150
Like Charles Barkley.

738
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,028
-That's a Bobby Van.
-Who's Bobby Van?

739
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:58,490
He was the host of Make Me Laugh.

740
01:10:02,118 --> 01:10:05,538
I never got to finish
that chilidog, you know?

741
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:09,042
That light's on yellow
way too long.

742
01:10:18,885 --> 01:10:21,221
You, okay?

743
01:10:22,555 --> 01:10:24,349
-You all right?
-I'm okay.

744
01:10:24,599 --> 01:10:26,559
Are you all right?

745
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,979
Are you all right? Let's get out.

746
01:10:30,146 --> 01:10:31,856
Come on, let's get out.

747
01:10:33,733 --> 01:10:35,819
James.

748
01:10:37,028 --> 01:10:38,613
James.

749
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:45,620
-Who's James?
-I don't know.

750
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:48,331
Honey?

751
01:10:48,665 --> 01:10:54,254
James Worthy is a star.
X is just a player.

752
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:59,843
-This a conversation you had earlier?
-Yes.

753
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,511
It's a good sign.

754
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:05,348
-What?
-Hey.

755
01:11:05,598 --> 01:11:07,684
-Hey.
-Hi.

756
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:11,646
We had an accident, baby.
You're in the hospital.

757
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:21,281
I lost it, right? It's all over.

758
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:30,582
If we can't make it through this,
if you do not know you're not alone...

759
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:34,961
-Linda?
-I lost the baby.

760
01:11:36,629 --> 01:11:38,423
Will you look at me?

761
01:11:42,969 --> 01:11:47,098
I was flunking high school,
overweight, had a dead-end job.

762
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:52,228
I didn't feel good about myself.
My future did not look very bright...

763
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:53,438
-Hey.
-Hi.

764
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:58,610
-How are you doing today?
-I'm better. I'm better.

765
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:03,073
I think I've read every
single magazine in the world.

766
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:08,078
-Did you go to work today?
-No. It's been two weeks.

767
01:12:08,244 --> 01:12:11,247
I think they're going to fire me.

768
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:18,797
-I need some time alone.
-Alone?

769
01:12:18,963 --> 01:12:21,049
Yeah.

770
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:26,262
I have a new emotion
every five seconds.

771
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:36,314
I think I should take
that research trip.

772
01:12:36,856 --> 01:12:43,154
I should just be out somewhere
in the middle of the ocean, alone.

773
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:46,408
I know I'm right about this.

774
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:50,453
It's just a month. It's just work.

775
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:54,624
See you in a month!

776
01:12:56,209 --> 01:12:58,795
I'll miss you!

777
01:13:05,635 --> 01:13:09,055
Hey, Janet. Come here.
I got a present for you.

778
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:15,186
Give me another chance.
One, two minutes. Come on.

779
01:13:16,938 --> 01:13:20,525
-Hey. This'll be great.
-Oh.

780
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:23,653
You're gonna love me for this.

781
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:31,661
I installed your new stereo.

782
01:13:31,828 --> 01:13:36,291
Oh. Great.

783
01:13:52,932 --> 01:13:55,518
Yeah.

784
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:05,320
Yeah.

785
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:30,220
-I'll replace the windows.
-Thanks.

786
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:58,790
Work. Work has never been better.

787
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:05,422
I miss her.

788
01:15:09,676 --> 01:15:13,596
What are we going to say to each other
when she gets back?

789
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:31,197
-Hi.
-Hi. Welcome back.

790
01:15:31,364 --> 01:15:33,033
-You look great.
-You too.

791
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:35,535
How are you? How was it?

792
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:37,370
-It was really good.
-Yeah?

793
01:15:37,537 --> 01:15:38,788
Yeah, really good.

794
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:42,250
-You want to go home? Out someplace?
-Whatever.

795
01:15:42,417 --> 01:15:48,214
-Let me think of the place...
-There's Costas, I guess, or whatever.

796
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:53,219
-The 3-2-1? We could go... Or Costas...
-Whatever. I don't really care.

797
01:15:58,183 --> 01:16:04,522
Jesus. We both could sink
from all the pressure in the air.

798
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,149
I know.

799
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:10,737
-I really got into my job again.
-Me too. I was working my ass off.

800
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:15,325
I had the Coast Guard working for us.
It was real exciting.

801
01:16:15,575 --> 01:16:17,744
That's great.

802
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,917
We don't have to try and be
what we were.

803
01:16:25,418 --> 01:16:28,254
Thanks. I've been thinking
the same thing.

804
01:16:32,884 --> 01:16:35,178
Great.

805
01:16:36,429 --> 01:16:38,682
Friends.

806
01:16:40,892 --> 01:16:45,397
Let's be the first people in history
to say it and really mean it.

807
01:16:48,483 --> 01:16:51,319
How do you always say
the perfect thing?

808
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:10,380
That obnoxious mime?
Was right. Love disappears.

809
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,685
-Come on, man!
-Let's go!

810
01:18:05,852 --> 01:18:07,395
We got people out here!

811
01:18:07,645 --> 01:18:11,316
-Hello.
-I gotta go piss, man! Let's go!

812
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:17,822
Linda. It's me. I had to call you.

813
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:21,576
It's about midnight. I was just
having many beers and...

814
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:24,245
...I wanted to say...

815
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:27,832
What I should have said at the dock.

816
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:34,130
I fucking chickened out. I lied when
I acted casual, like Mr. Casual...

817
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:36,925
...and I should have said it.

818
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:44,140
You belong with me!

819
01:18:45,975 --> 01:18:47,686
We belong together and...

820
01:18:47,936 --> 01:18:51,398
...and what really pissed me off
is that you thought...

821
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:54,693
...I proposed only because
you were pregnant.

822
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:56,903
I've got to go piss!

823
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:00,824
-I've got to go...
-Hey, this is not the bathroom!

824
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:05,995
And maybe if I'd said this at the dock,
it would make a difference because...

825
01:19:06,162 --> 01:19:11,292
I think we made a big mistake because
we had good times and bad times...

826
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:13,294
...but we had times.

827
01:19:13,545 --> 01:19:17,090
And I would like to start over.

828
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:20,010
I would like to be new to you.

829
01:19:20,176 --> 01:19:24,222
I want to be new to you.
I want to be Mr. New...

830
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:29,352
...so call me back if you want to,
but this is the last time I'll call.

831
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:39,362
And if you really needed to know how
I really feel, that's it. I love you.

832
01:19:39,529 --> 01:19:43,241
And... That's something
you should know, so...

833
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:55,295
I won't bother you again,
so good night and goodbye and...

834
01:19:55,462 --> 01:20:00,091
...I love you. Call me back. Goodbye.

835
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:22,822
This thing just eats tapes.

836
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:39,839
We're talking about 900,000 to
a million people by the time it's done.

837
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:45,345
Provide an environment safer and better
than their cars. Why not, Mr. Mayor?

838
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:49,891
-So it's a train.
-A supertrain.

839
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:53,228
I've been burned by this
train business before.

840
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:57,148
-You people all seem to forget.
-We can change this city.

841
01:20:57,315 --> 01:20:59,609
People love their cars.

842
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:04,447
Yes. But...

843
01:21:04,614 --> 01:21:07,200
-But if you give them great...
-Coffee.

844
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:10,620
Coffee... And great music. If you...

845
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:16,251
I'll put it to you like this, and then
I'll thank you for your time.

846
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:18,169
My answer is...

847
01:21:19,587 --> 01:21:21,631
...no.

848
01:22:03,882 --> 01:22:05,300
Hi. May I help you?

849
01:22:05,633 --> 01:22:11,181
Ticket to Cabo San Lucas through Los
Angeles, first class, please. And...

850
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:17,854
Could you seat me next to a single guy?

851
01:22:20,982 --> 01:22:24,069
I think I'll put you in seat 3C.

852
01:22:24,652 --> 01:22:26,946
Thank you.

853
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:34,704
Tell me everything there is to know
about you.

854
01:22:35,288 --> 01:22:37,874
I've got a special feeling about you.

855
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:42,504
Don't feel bad about her.
I'll tell you what happened.

856
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:46,841
Kid talks her ear off the whole flight.
Dad picks him up.

857
01:22:47,008 --> 01:22:50,470
He's divorced. He meets Debbie.
His first words are:

858
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:53,515
Look at those fantastic earrings.

859
01:22:55,225 --> 01:23:00,689
And that's all it took.
Debbie was in love.

860
01:23:04,025 --> 01:23:05,568
Got back two weeks ago.

861
01:23:05,735 --> 01:23:09,322
He sends her the big basket every day.
Every third one...

862
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:13,702
...she sends back, just to be
mysterious. I don't know, games.

863
01:23:13,868 --> 01:23:15,995
He wants her to move to Mexico...

864
01:23:16,162 --> 01:23:20,667
...and if she gets a job at the TV
station down there, she's going.

865
01:23:27,632 --> 01:23:30,844
Oh, thanks.

866
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:40,437
Tomorrow, I gotta spell her name in
rose petals. Do you believe this job?

867
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:13,595
It's so easy to fall back into
old patterns.

868
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:16,973
Back with Andy. One week
and we're already like...

869
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:23,021
...one of those old couples, who sit
around in Denny's and don't speak.

870
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:24,898
What am I doing?

871
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:27,859
Why did I chicken out?

872
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:31,988
Do you have the...?

873
01:24:38,286 --> 01:24:44,417
No, this is good. Being with Andy
is like being alone. Together.

874
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:48,713
At least I'm not out there dating.

875
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:53,593
-Love you.
-Love you too.

876
01:26:00,618 --> 01:26:03,163
-What?
-Hi.

877
01:26:03,413 --> 01:26:04,456
Hey.

878
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:16,509
Hey. I was worried about you.

879
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:22,223
I'm fine. I am great! Been working.
I read half of Exodus.

880
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:25,602
Steve, I think you're
going through a phase.

881
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:28,813
Do you realize, Janet,
that in modern society...

882
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:34,235
...there is almost no need
to leave the house?

883
01:26:34,402 --> 01:26:36,821
-At all.
-Steve, you're wigging.

884
01:26:38,156 --> 01:26:41,534
I'm not wigging.
What, you think I'm wigging?

885
01:26:44,954 --> 01:26:50,460
This is hang time. I'm just...
I'm just regrouping.

886
01:26:50,627 --> 01:26:54,214
I'm spending some time with myself,
getting stronger.

887
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:58,343
Thinking about... Regrouping.
I'm thinking about...

888
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:04,391
...how I listened to my instincts, and
they were wrong. The opposite of right.

889
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:09,354
Well, I just wanted to bring you
your mail.

890
01:27:11,314 --> 01:27:15,985
And maybe this isn't the right time
to share this with you, but...

891
01:27:16,152 --> 01:27:18,822
...things do turn around, Steve.

892
01:27:18,988 --> 01:27:22,826
I mean, I don't even think
about Cliff anymore.

893
01:27:23,076 --> 01:27:25,745
I'm having the best time,
on my terms.

894
01:27:25,912 --> 01:27:28,998
You know what else?
I'm going back to school.

895
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:30,959
-Really?
-Yeah.

896
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:34,879
Got all my architecture classes.
My first project is...

897
01:27:35,046 --> 01:27:38,508
...redesigning the fountain so we
can sit in it.

898
01:27:38,758 --> 01:27:41,761
-That's good news.
-It is.

899
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:50,437
People need people, Steve.
It's got nothing to do with sex.

900
01:27:50,895 --> 01:27:55,692
Maybe 40 percent. Sixty percent.
Forget it.

901
01:27:55,942 --> 01:27:57,777
Forget it.

902
01:27:58,028 --> 01:28:00,572
Tell you what.

903
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:03,408
If I have any kind of news
of any kind...

904
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:09,372
...something good and nice that I
want to share with you or something...

905
01:28:09,539 --> 01:28:12,417
I will knock four times, okay?

906
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:17,505
It's gonna be our secret code.

907
01:28:17,672 --> 01:28:20,425
-How?
-Okay? What?

908
01:28:20,592 --> 01:28:21,718
-How?
-How what?

909
01:28:21,885 --> 01:28:23,928
How will you knock?

910
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:26,014
Oh.

911
01:28:28,141 --> 01:28:31,728
Like that.

912
01:28:31,895 --> 01:28:34,064
Okay.

913
01:28:35,648 --> 01:28:40,195
Take care of yourself, Steve. Please.

914
01:28:57,045 --> 01:29:00,715
In a parallel universe,
we're probably a great couple.

915
01:29:02,884 --> 01:29:04,844
But in this one...

916
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:06,304
Neighbors.

917
01:29:38,128 --> 01:29:40,046
-Hi.
-Hi.

918
01:29:40,213 --> 01:29:43,425
You get my message last night?
Because I called.

919
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:44,634
I know.

920
01:29:45,593 --> 01:29:50,974
You know, I didn't appreciate you,
even though I thought I did.

921
01:29:55,478 --> 01:30:01,234
I used to live out by the airport,
underneath the flight patterns.

922
01:30:01,401 --> 01:30:05,572
It was really noisy with the planes
going by all day.

923
01:30:05,739 --> 01:30:10,285
I used to have cookouts, and no one
would come because of the noise.

924
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:14,706
I got used to it.
And then, when I moved...

925
01:30:14,873 --> 01:30:17,917
...I missed the noise.
I missed those planes.

926
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:25,258
-Cliff, what are you talking about?
-I don't know.

927
01:30:27,052 --> 01:30:32,098
I miss you. The way
you used to look at me...

928
01:30:32,349 --> 01:30:36,478
-Don't. I'm finally over you.
-Really?

929
01:30:36,728 --> 01:30:42,609
Yeah. I mean, you know, I still really
do like you, you know?

930
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:45,820
I think you're very...

931
01:30:46,613 --> 01:30:48,156
What?

932
01:30:48,865 --> 01:30:49,908
Entertaining.

933
01:30:53,745 --> 01:30:56,498
That's me. I gotta go.
My break's over.

934
01:30:57,957 --> 01:31:00,460
Janet, you rock my world.

935
01:31:55,557 --> 01:32:00,770
I'm walking down the avenue

936
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:09,696
And I'm looking at the garbage cans

937
01:32:12,824 --> 01:32:17,829
I'm laughing at the people I see

938
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:24,461
Something like that. I'm playing
with the lyrics. It's not set in stone.

939
01:32:24,627 --> 01:32:28,465
Give me a call. I don't know
what you're doing tonight...

940
01:32:28,631 --> 01:32:31,134
...but give me a call, huh?

941
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:38,350
Talk to me, talk to me.
40 résumés, bring me back something.

942
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,852
Here we go.

943
01:33:02,749 --> 01:33:04,918
Hi.

944
01:33:05,085 --> 01:33:08,588
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

945
01:33:12,717 --> 01:33:17,222
I don't need to be your girlfriend.
I just want to know you again.

946
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:21,768
What took you so long?

947
01:33:23,978 --> 01:33:25,730
I was stuck in traffic.

948
01:34:18,033 --> 01:34:22,287
Well, that's the way it happens.
Steve's moving out tomorrow.

949
01:34:22,454 --> 01:34:24,706
They're finding a place,
and I'm happy for them.

950
01:34:24,873 --> 01:34:28,793
-Coming down. Look out.
-No problem.

951
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:34,758
I may live here forever. That's fine.
Not everybody needs to be with someone.

952
01:34:34,924 --> 01:34:38,428
For a lot of people,
living alone is a nasty hang.

953
01:34:38,595 --> 01:34:43,558
Not for me.
My music is all the juice I'll need.

954
01:34:43,725 --> 01:34:48,897
I'm a self-contained unit.
I'm a solo artist.

955
01:34:49,064 --> 01:34:52,609
Well, I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.

956
01:35:00,658 --> 01:35:03,828
-Hey.
-Hey. Going out?

957
01:35:03,995 --> 01:35:08,166
-Yep. You?
-Yeah.

958
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:14,214
That's a very nice hat, and I don't mean
that in an Eddie Haskell kind of way.

959
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:16,800
Thanks.

960
01:35:20,762 --> 01:35:24,057
-Bless you.
-Thank you.

961
01:35:44,119 --> 01:35:46,496
Does everybody go through this?

962
01:35:46,663 --> 01:35:49,833
No, I think, just us.

963
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,043
I'm going to be celibate forever.

964
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:55,046
I could spend my life with that person.

965
01:35:55,213 --> 01:35:58,258
-All you see is her head, Tommy.
-I know my type.

966
01:35:58,425 --> 01:36:02,012
-Met someone new today.
-She's more my type than yours.

967
01:36:02,178 --> 01:36:06,391
-You always say they're your type.
-Tell me I'm not like Shelly.

968
01:36:06,558 --> 01:36:09,561
-She should try living alone...
-lt took two dates...

969
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:12,397
Hi, it's me. I just thought I'd call...

970
01:36:12,564 --> 01:36:17,777
-You said that I said...
-I don't play games.

971
01:36:19,237 --> 01:36:21,698
I can't believe I feel this way!
