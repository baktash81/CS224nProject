1
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:14,791
<i>GOD FORGIVES... I DON'T!</i>

2
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,623
Joe, come here!

3
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,160
It's dangerous!

4
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,547
The train is coming!

5
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:03,372
But there's nobody...

6
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:08,455
What's going on?

7
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,758
They killed Mr. Hoskins.

8
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,304
They attacked the train!

9
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:17,428
They're all dead!

10
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,466
All of them!

11
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:42,468
Thirty.

12
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,627
One hundred more.

13
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:05,430
I'm in.

14
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:16,787
Three hundred.

15
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:57,777
I'm in.

16
00:06:04,784 --> 00:06:05,816
Me too.

17
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:17,266
Served.

18
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:28,382
One for me.

19
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,948
Five hundred.

20
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:47,167
I'm in.

21
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,349
That too.

22
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:14,294
A thousand more.

23
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:23,854
Think carefully, buddy,
he said one thousand.

24
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,814
I want to see the money.

25
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,393
He's right, he doesn't know us.

26
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:30,118
But we're honest people.

27
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,251
Fine, I'll vouch for Ronnie.

28
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:38,303
With cash or tobacco?
Because you're out of cigars.

29
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,945
I think you didn't understand.

30
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,603
I said I'll vouch for him.

31
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:55,161
This place is... peaceful.

32
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,344
I won't forget it.

33
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:17,956
One moment.

34
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,554
Do you vouch for me too?

35
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:23,133
Of course.

36
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:26,853
You need three thousand to see.

37
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,094
He'll need a guarantee too.

38
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,380
Very well.

39
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:52,946
I see that you don't
want to play anymore.

40
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,155
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

41
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:11,261
To be honest, I might as well
vouch for myself...

42
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:25,785
Please, forgive me.

43
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:28,452
Come on!

44
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:19,948
Keep quiet...

45
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,955
You might wake them up.

46
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:01,708
It's closed.

47
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:05,406
I'm hungry, I'dd like to eat.

48
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:08,185
I said it's closed.

49
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,874
Where can I find something to eat then?

50
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,703
In hell.

51
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:20,163
You're a funny guy.

52
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,925
And you, you're breaking my balls...

53
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,446
- ''Will you vouch for me?''
- ''Of course.''

54
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,566
- ''For me too?''
- ''Sure!''

55
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,837
And they started to fight.

56
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:42,972
- Did you see him before?
- Of course not.

57
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:46,388
You don't forget a guy like that.

58
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,105
Do you know him?

59
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,359
I think I do.

60
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:13,315
He's the man I'm looking for.

61
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:27,839
A thousand more.

62
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,539
Stupid fool.

63
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:36,928
You stayed alone, Doc.

64
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,561
It's better to play alone.

65
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,861
I never go for a walk at night.

66
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,665
Especially since I believe in ghosts.

67
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,092
You were looking for me?

68
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,413
Yes.

69
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:03,354
Why?

70
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:06,709
A week ago,
a MKT train has been attacked.

71
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:11,534
They stole 300,000 dollars in gold.

72
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:14,142
A lucky move.

73
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,757
Everybody got killed.

74
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:22,329
Nobody left to tell what happened.

75
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:25,804
It's the work of a specialist.

76
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:31,671
How many people would be able
to pull out something like that?

77
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:36,141
Many.

78
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:45,999
I lied, they didn't all die.

79
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:48,252
There was one survivor.

80
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:53,092
He told me what happened...

81
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:55,121
and who did it.

82
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:02,345
Come on...

83
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:05,747
try harder. Tell me everything.

84
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,711
Talk.

85
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:11,084
Bill.

86
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,638
Our good old friend Bill Sant'Antonio.

87
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,185
What's your point?

88
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:21,717
Exactly what I just told you.

89
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,849
That's why you believe in ghosts.

90
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:33,873
Listen to me carefully.

91
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:38,568
Here are the 300 miles of rails
from El Paso to Canyon City.

92
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,924
The gold was loaded in El Paso.

93
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,817
The robbers tracks seem to show...

94
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,924
that the attack happened here.

95
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:51,231
But it was just a trap.

96
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,997
Two days before the train left...

97
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,158
the robbers went this way.

98
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:02,028
They just wanted to leave tracks
near the rails.

99
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,920
And they went north.

100
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:05,287
To the river.

101
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,374
There, they turned around
and went back to El Paso...

102
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:13,841
where they waited for
the train to leave.

103
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,436
They bought tickets and...

104
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:18,648
went in the train as passengers.

105
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:23,030
After an hour,
near the Mexican border,

106
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:26,141
20 miles from Puntal, a small village...

107
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:28,413
they drew their guns and killed everybody.

108
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,964
The driver, a judge and
everybody else.

109
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:33,965
They stopped the train...

110
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:39,210
and unloaded all the gold.

111
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:43,770
Two of them left the train just
before it got to its last stop.

112
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:47,069
All the searching was
done in the north.

113
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:52,225
Except that nobody will find
these men there.

114
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:56,046
Because they're safe in the south.

115
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,512
I only know one man able
to organize something like that.

116
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:06,441
It's Bill Sant'Antonio.

117
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,001
He's the one who attacked the train.

118
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,892
The dead would have fun
robbing trains?

119
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:19,156
I don't know what happened a year ago,
but I know one thing:

120
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,514
Bill is alive.

121
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:25,452
And since the one who saw him
on the train is dead...

122
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:27,654
we're the only ones to know.

123
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,535
There's just me

124
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,233
and you, now.

125
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,085
Even if you don't believe it yet.

126
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:39,058
We have a few advantages over him.

127
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,163
First, he doesn't know that
we know he's alive.

128
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:45,724
Then, we know where he's hiding.

129
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:52,110
And finally, considering what happened,
he feels safe now.

130
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,741
Don't you have anything to say?

131
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:04,514
Where's your interest in all this?

132
00:17:04,662 --> 00:17:09,956
Harold Bank had the gold insured
by an agency.

133
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:13,092
I happen to work for this agency.

134
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,869
You haven't changed, you stupid fool.

135
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,976
Tell me what happened that night.

136
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:31,013
Go to hell.

137
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,968
Tell me what happened that night.

138
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,329
Come, Rose.

139
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:32,285
You're lucky tonight, niÃ±o

140
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,386
It couldn't be any better.

141
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:35,742
Hello, you!

142
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:40,057
You know, Bill,
your friend is quite good-looking.

143
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:42,644
Why did I never see him before?

144
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:45,988
He wasn't here, my dear.
He just arrived.

145
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:51,730
She's a lady...

146
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:54,096
Everything in its own time.

147
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:56,339
How dared you hit me?

148
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:57,388
Come over here!

149
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,509
Have her shut the fuck up!

150
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,098
One hundred.

151
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:12,787
Two hundred.

152
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:18,960
Five hundred.

153
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:23,603
I'm in.

154
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,023
My turn to deal the cards this time,
we'll see if you're gonna win.

155
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:40,150
What do you mean?

156
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,113
Nothing...

157
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:46,587
I never met someone so lucky.

158
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,114
Luck has nothing to do with it.

159
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,439
What is it then?

160
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,373
You've always had the same skill in cards...

161
00:19:58,276 --> 00:19:59,484
a newbie.

162
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:02,063
Are you sure?

163
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:12,867
I asked you a question.

164
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:15,841
You're too curious.

165
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,132
And that, you have to pay for it.

166
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:22,828
I'm curious to know if you cheat.

167
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:24,975
Quiet!

168
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:27,255
I won't let you laugh at a friend.

169
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,788
Especially an old friend like you.

170
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:32,808
No one is allowed to laugh.

171
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:35,819
Except me.

172
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:43,849
Don't move.

173
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,480
No, niÃ±o.

174
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,341
You shouldn't have done that.

175
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,487
In the past...

176
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:00,299
you'd have never considered
doing something like that.

177
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,607
Because I'm the one who gave you
those tools...

178
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:08,503
and taught you how to use them.

179
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:11,377
Yeah, in the past...

180
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,772
I'm sure you wouldn't have done that.

181
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:19,131
You're talking because you're
carrying a gun.

182
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:23,070
Calm down, buddy, you'll get one too.

183
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:26,520
Don't worry.
Stay calm.

184
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:30,739
A man like you would never
accept to fight...

185
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,676
someone who makes a living
playing cards...

186
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,765
without first thinking of
the consequences.

187
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:42,171
I've heard that...

188
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:46,295
you have good reflexes with your gun.

189
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:51,288
If you're as good as you are
playing cards then I should be careful.

190
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,485
Because I have many responsibilities.

191
00:21:58,225 --> 00:21:59,305
For example...

192
00:22:00,812 --> 00:22:02,889
I must think about my men.

193
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,178
Look at them.

194
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:09,199
What would they do...

195
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,103
the poor boys?

196
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:14,419
They would get my gold share
if I was dead.

197
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:19,278
I'm generous with my men,
but they're not the only ones.

198
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:20,562
There's Paquita too.

199
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:24,612
What would she do if I was dead?
What would she do?

200
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:26,187
What would you do?

201
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,075
And let's not forget the funeral.

202
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:37,428
I want an unforgettable funeral.

203
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:41,374
With music,
everybody will cry,

204
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,171
the priest will make his speech...

205
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:46,811
And a funeral is expensive.

206
00:22:47,773 --> 00:22:49,850
I shouldn't be the one paying for it.

207
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:53,210
Nor my men, Paquita and the villagers...

208
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,703
who have a hard time making a living,
unlike you.

209
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,460
I think you should...

210
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:08,835
put back on the table what you won.

211
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:14,570
Because it's my money.
It was my money, wasn't it?

212
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:17,559
And also, I'm sure...

213
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:21,835
that you'd be willing to pay for
my funeral if you killed me.

214
00:23:34,185 --> 00:23:36,429
Here, that's good.

215
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:40,949
Very well.

216
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:44,512
You really think you can kill me.

217
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,128
At least my buddies have guts.

218
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:52,692
You thought that he wasn't a friend... 

219
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:55,935
and that he didn't want to
pay for my funeral...

220
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,903
but you were wrong: he's a friend.

221
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:02,124
It's a shame to kill him.
But I respect my friends.

222
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:05,341
If he wins, you'll let him go.

223
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,950
Now all of you go outside,
nobody will see us fight.

224
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,088
No one will watch the fight.

225
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,739
Bud will make sure that
the rules are respected.

226
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:18,177
Once you're outside,
he'll set the house on fire.

227
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:23,130
No one will see the body of Bill
Sant'Antonio or of his opponent.

228
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,515
If I win,
this money will be used for his burial.

229
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,646
And now get out, everybody outside!

230
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:34,010
Give him a gun, Bud.

231
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,212
Now go outside and follow my orders.

232
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:43,196
When the flames will reach the roof,
this matter will be settled.

233
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:50,591
And now Doc,
it's between you and me.

234
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:53,975
I always liked jokes.

235
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:58,189
This one might be the best.

236
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:26,819
You won't make it alive.

237
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,951
Even if you're faster than me...

238
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:34,227
my men will look for you everywhere...

239
00:25:34,863 --> 00:25:36,857
and will get revenge.

240
00:25:40,745 --> 00:25:43,748
There's quite a few of my men, Doc.

241
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:47,122
What are you doing?
What are they waiting for?

242
00:25:54,348 --> 00:25:55,380
Ready when you are...

243
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:06,221
You won't make it alive.
Even if you're faster than me...

244
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:10,311
my men will look for you everywhere...

245
00:27:11,358 --> 00:27:13,352
and will get revenge.

246
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,413
There's quite a few of my men, Doc.

247
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,739
There's quite a few of my men...

248
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,134
Will you buy me a drink, stranger?

249
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,440
No, get lost!

250
00:28:11,434 --> 00:28:12,467
Fat coward!

251
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:41,358
There's quite a few of my men...

252
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,866
I always liked jokes.

253
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:14,645
This one might be the best.

254
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:53,447
Hey, you!

255
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:56,624
A guy will come through here soon.

256
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,327
You'll recognize him easily,
he will have walked 20 miles on foot.

257
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:01,787
And he hates walking.

258
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:04,456
Give him this horse.

259
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,169
Rose!

260
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:16,640
Come here!

261
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,076
Where are you going?

262
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,886
I'll be right back.

263
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:45,254
Shut up.

264
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:48,383
I'm not here to kill you.

265
00:31:53,624 --> 00:31:55,583
When did you arrive?

266
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:59,143
You very well know that
you might be killed here.

267
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,834
I must hurry, I'm expected somewhere.

268
00:32:05,982 --> 00:32:07,941
It won't take long.

269
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:11,559
I just want to know one thing.

270
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:15,126
I thought you were here for me...

271
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,526
I went up to redo my makeup...

272
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,382
I'm starting to need some.

273
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:23,428
Rose...

274
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:27,815
You must tell me what happened
after that night.

275
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,542
What night?

276
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:32,142
Don't put on an act.

277
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,071
It was a century ago.

278
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:35,994
Ten months.

279
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:37,518
It's a long time to me.

280
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:39,215
Listen carefully, Doc.

281
00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:41,147
I don't blame you.

282
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:44,040
But I lost my man.

283
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,302
And it seems you're
the one who shot him.

284
00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:49,228
- Who are you talking about?
- Joe Tam-Tam.

285
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:51,273
You didn't miss much.

286
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:58,183
I became attached to him
and he was generous...

287
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:00,775
More generous than the others.

288
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:03,451
I wasn't the one who looked for trouble.

289
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:08,720
I know, but you should understand,
you got them.

290
00:33:09,214 --> 00:33:10,378
You must be very rich now.

291
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:13,579
What?

292
00:33:14,017 --> 00:33:18,685
People say that you stole the money
during Bill's funeral.

293
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,179
Listen to me, Rose.

294
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,884
Your Tam-Tam was a stupid fuck.

295
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:30,087
But you, you're everything but a fool.

296
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,268
Who was it then?

297
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:36,838
Yes?

298
00:33:36,926 --> 00:33:39,087
Rose, what are you doing?
We're waiting for you.

299
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:43,792
I'll be right here.

300
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,432
- Did you lock yourself up?
- Wait a minute.

301
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:48,106
You won't let me in?

302
00:33:49,223 --> 00:33:50,337
Not now.
Later.

303
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:52,339
Who were you talking to?

304
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:56,629
I've started talking alone
since I've met you...

305
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:58,948
Open!

306
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,070
I'll smash the door!

307
00:34:00,143 --> 00:34:01,176
I'll lose him...

308
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:04,945
I told you to go to hell!

309
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,536
I hope he didn't hurt himself.

310
00:34:20,461 --> 00:34:22,503
He's a nice man after all.

311
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:29,840
Come on, tell me everything you know.

312
00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:34,301
And quick.

313
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:38,561
I don't have much time.

314
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:41,708
Me neither.

315
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:55,844
Bill had one kind of a funeral,
exactly as he wished.

316
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:29,059
I had never seen such a good ceremony.

317
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:32,055
Yes, it was a first rate funeral.

318
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:52,175
Then Bill's men left
to split the gold.

319
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:55,629
They were even about to split
Bill's share among themselves.

320
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:00,228
Tam-Tam intended to forget the past.

321
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:03,040
He wanted to start a new life with me.

322
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:07,182
But the worst kind of surprise
was waiting for them there.

323
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:15,111
The gold had disappeared.

324
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:21,290
Only one man could have done
that and I know who he is.

325
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:24,415
We should never have let him go.

326
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:27,454
Because he didn't really leave.

327
00:37:27,672 --> 00:37:29,750
He stayed to watch us.

328
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:34,241
He stole the gold while we
were at the funeral.

329
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:38,049
But I'll make sure he won't enjoy it.

330
00:37:39,911 --> 00:37:42,759
Bill said that our band is finished.

331
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:46,478
But he didn't expect such a low blow.

332
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:49,657
He managed to convince them.

333
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:53,728
Then they all went looking for you.

334
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:55,909
Tam-Tam came back a month later.

335
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,059
He told me that Bud was
the first to disappear.

336
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:06,036
So it's Bud who said it was me.

337
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,557
The others were still looking for you...

338
00:38:08,825 --> 00:38:10,474
but each on his own.

339
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,669
They were all hoping to find you
to keep all the gold.

340
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,683
I tried to stop Tam-Tam,
but it was pointless.

341
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,253
He only stayed for a night.

342
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:27,386
He promised me that he would
come back before he left.

343
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:37,567
But you're the one who came back.

344
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,135
He was a good-looking man.

345
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,692
He was so generous!

346
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:51,422
Bud gave me the gun that night.

347
00:38:51,722 --> 00:38:53,050
Give him a gun, Bud.

348
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:03,483
I have to go, Rose.

349
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,201
Since they left, a year ago...

350
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:32,330
I stopped working and
there are no more dead.

351
00:39:33,152 --> 00:39:36,108
Except for the natural deaths.

352
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:39,462
People have to supplement one's income.

353
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:44,742
That's why I'm doing small precision jobs.

354
00:39:50,312 --> 00:39:51,827
If you let me, I'll continue...

355
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,101
Tell me, old man...

356
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:57,663
is it you who made Sant'Antonio's coffin?

357
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,917
Of course it's me.

358
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:03,090
And is it you who put him in it?

359
00:40:03,823 --> 00:40:05,007
Yes.

360
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:11,511
Even if I must confess that
there wasn't much left of him...

361
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:13,518
What do you mean?

362
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:17,283
It was an ugly sight.

363
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:20,585
He looked like he had already been home.

364
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:23,165
In hell, I mean.

365
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,437
If you were asked to swear...

366
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:34,275
that the one you put in the coffin
was Bill Sant'Antonio...

367
00:40:34,617 --> 00:40:36,528
would you do it?

368
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,606
Aren't you the one who killed him?

369
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:43,163
I'm waiting for your answer.

370
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,401
I already answered!

371
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,359
No one could have identified
the remains of this burned corpse.

372
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:57,396
You're wasting my time
with these riddles.

373
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:09,090
If you told me that you never
shot Bill Sant'Antonio...

374
00:41:09,273 --> 00:41:11,249
I'd say that...

375
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,886
this bastard is still alive.

376
00:41:18,714 --> 00:41:21,837
Because I don't believe in ghosts...

377
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:24,255
even if some people of the village...

378
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:29,619
swear that they've seen him
riding his damn black horse...

379
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:31,734
during full moon nights.

380
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,369
You can say that...

381
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:43,017
Bill Sant'Antonio was
such an important man...

382
00:41:43,142 --> 00:41:45,814
that people can't forget him.

383
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:48,447
I agree.

384
00:41:48,503 --> 00:41:52,506
But not so important as
to make him a legend.

385
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:56,908
But people love legends.

386
00:41:57,327 --> 00:42:00,017
Otherwise they wouldn't have
anything to tell during the evenings...

387
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:03,829
they wouldn't know
what to talk about.

388
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:07,476
Thanks for everything, old man.

389
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:10,138
It was nice to see you again.

390
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,244
And don't forget...

391
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:15,634
that if I didn't know
it was you who shot him,

392
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:20,353
I could swear that
Bill Sant'Antonio is still alive.

393
00:42:22,396 --> 00:42:23,594
Indeed, he's still alive.

394
00:42:26,274 --> 00:42:29,361
But he'll regret not being dead.

395
00:42:50,522 --> 00:42:52,373
Too bad you've been so curious.

396
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:53,962
All you had to do...

397
00:42:54,617 --> 00:42:58,014
was to keep doing your job.

398
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:19,760
Gimme something to drink.

399
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,966
Listen, assholes.

400
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:41,176
I've got some good news for all of you.

401
00:44:49,448 --> 00:44:50,646
Aren't you interested?

402
00:45:14,236 --> 00:45:15,408
Here.

403
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,501
It's better.

404
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:21,921
A very important man will come soon.

405
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:30,740
The new lawman needs
to be welcome with dignity.

406
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:33,312
Get up, assholes!

407
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:42,830
Don't let him wait outside,
he could catch a cold.

408
00:46:00,578 --> 00:46:03,533
Let's make the introductions.

409
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:06,753
If he's in charge of
protecting your rights...

410
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:11,925
the new lawman will
have to know you well.

411
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:15,641
Come here.

412
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,676
The new commander wants
to know your name.

413
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,074
You must tell it to him.

414
00:46:27,225 --> 00:46:30,312
- Jose...
- Very good, Jose what?

415
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:32,304
Hernandez.

416
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:34,703
Does this name ring a bell?

417
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:38,793
What? Is that him who called you?

418
00:46:40,232 --> 00:46:43,140
I'm disappointed...

419
00:46:43,543 --> 00:46:45,406
And he told you that we...

420
00:47:21,534 --> 00:47:23,695
That's true,
they deserve to be punished.

421
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:28,108
You're way too harsh...

422
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:30,651
They're good men...

423
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:33,076
they won't make the same mistake twice.

424
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:42,288
Tell it to the commander.
You won't make the same mistake again.

425
00:47:43,848 --> 00:47:45,890
Did you hear, commander?

426
00:47:46,303 --> 00:47:50,033
He said they won't do it again.

427
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:53,918
Stop!

428
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:55,604
You can't...

429
00:47:56,037 --> 00:48:00,121
It's a good thing that we're here
to make sure people respect the law!

430
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:03,715
Jose, give the commander a drink.

431
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:08,596
A lawman is always sensitive
at the sight of blood.

432
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:12,350
Come on, give the commander a drink.

433
00:48:20,372 --> 00:48:21,455
Mr. Hernandez...

434
00:48:26,592 --> 00:48:27,625
Move.

435
00:48:35,026 --> 00:48:37,946
Cheer up and move.

436
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:47,634
The new commander of the village
won't bother us anymore.

437
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,439
Where was he?

438
00:52:49,684 --> 00:52:52,611
Not far... from the village.

439
00:52:53,996 --> 00:52:56,142
He was about to arrive.

440
00:52:57,085 --> 00:52:58,509
Did someone see you?

441
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:01,540
Nobody saw us.

442
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:05,493
Then Bud got a great idea.

443
00:53:05,642 --> 00:53:06,557
Which one?

444
00:53:17,392 --> 00:53:20,348
It's nothing, it was just a joke...

445
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,345
Tell me.

446
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,161
It was just a joke!

447
00:54:15,254 --> 00:54:18,037
You know that I hate jokes!

448
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:20,669
If they're made by others.

449
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:24,103
My orders were clear.

450
00:54:24,296 --> 00:54:28,298
You had to get rid of the
commander far from the village.

451
00:54:29,886 --> 00:54:32,010
I want to know who will come and when.

452
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:36,545
No one must make it out of here alive,
like three days ago.

453
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:42,330
Bud is a nice boy,
but he doesn't have a good memory.

454
00:54:43,173 --> 00:54:45,381
That'll teach him.

455
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:52,438
I can teach a lot more things, Bud.

456
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:54,892
Except one thing that you'll never have.

457
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:58,927
That's what it is.

458
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,214
You're stupid, Bud.

459
00:55:03,316 --> 00:55:05,358
You must know it.

460
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,120
Retard!

461
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:25,728
Haven't you realized that
you're a retard yet?

462
00:55:44,773 --> 00:55:46,768
I'd like a room.

463
00:55:51,837 --> 00:55:52,868
What's up?

464
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:55,088
Nothing...

465
00:55:57,592 --> 00:56:02,888
I need a bed to rest before I leave.

466
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,162
First room on the right.

467
00:56:08,171 --> 00:56:10,213
I don't want to be disturbed.

468
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:12,871
You didn't pick the right place.

469
00:59:55,756 --> 00:59:57,750
Stupid animal.

470
01:00:00,094 --> 01:00:01,126
What was it?

471
01:00:04,612 --> 01:00:05,728
Go on, hand out the cards.

472
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:07,752
Come on, out!

473
01:01:10,919 --> 01:01:12,330
Walk!

474
01:01:14,094 --> 01:01:18,049
And don't move if you want to see
your chiquita again!

475
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:39,157
That's good, amigo... 
you'll get used to it soon, you'll see.

476
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:31,359
Who is this guy?

477
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:33,497
- Do you know him, Jesus?
- No.

478
01:03:33,782 --> 01:03:34,898
And you, Miguel?

479
01:03:35,537 --> 01:03:36,989
Ask him.

480
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:39,392
I'd like to know how you got here.

481
01:03:40,169 --> 01:03:42,247
There's only one door.

482
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:43,917
Let me down.

483
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,788
Did you hear, Miguel?
He wants to get down.

484
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:52,938
Come on, tell us who you are
and what you're doing here.

485
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:56,291
Let me down,
I'll only talk to Sant'Antonio.

486
01:04:02,711 --> 01:04:04,706
Are you crazy?

487
01:04:05,277 --> 01:04:06,308
Who do you want to talk to?

488
01:04:06,573 --> 01:04:07,737
To Sant'Antonio.

489
01:04:08,195 --> 01:04:10,656
And then you'll want to talk to God?

490
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:15,734
I want to talk to your boss
whatever his current name is.

491
01:04:15,998 --> 01:04:19,003
You'll have to do with us.

492
01:04:19,367 --> 01:04:21,492
He's got better things to do.

493
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,502
Well, well, look who's here.

494
01:05:38,431 --> 01:05:40,305
Let me down.

495
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:07,432
I owe you one.

496
01:06:44,993 --> 01:06:47,948
It's the gold from the train, I was right!

497
01:06:51,237 --> 01:06:52,321
Your hands.

498
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:54,485
They'll be here soon.

499
01:06:58,734 --> 01:07:00,492
Forget it, Bud.

500
01:07:00,997 --> 01:07:02,109
I'm thirsty.

501
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,631
The two of us will never
be able to carry this chest.

502
01:07:42,702 --> 01:07:45,826
You're right, it's impossible with just two.

503
01:07:57,668 --> 01:07:59,664
There's something new.

504
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,591
If you knew who came today...

505
01:08:17,826 --> 01:08:20,925
Why didn't you tell me
we had some visitors?

506
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,716
I didn't know you were interested.

507
01:08:26,044 --> 01:08:28,168
I didn't say that I'm interested.

508
01:08:29,586 --> 01:08:30,501
Who is it?

509
01:08:30,928 --> 01:08:32,622
A stranger, he's leaving tomorrow.

510
01:08:33,007 --> 01:08:36,094
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, sleeping.

511
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,681
Go, beast, quick!

512
01:08:56,468 --> 01:08:58,379
It's so damn heavy!

513
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,683
Now, go under it.

514
01:09:11,452 --> 01:09:12,485
Pull.

515
01:09:17,297 --> 01:09:19,154
Pull, faster!

516
01:09:22,817 --> 01:09:24,365
Follow my boots.

517
01:09:36,329 --> 01:09:37,445
I'll never make it.

518
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,536
You will if you don't want to die under it.

519
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:44,521
What are you doing?
You're leaving?

520
01:09:53,533 --> 01:09:55,345
He's a heavy sleeper.

521
01:09:56,599 --> 01:09:57,596
What?

522
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,802
He doesn't answer.

523
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:20,482
Get out, my friend!

524
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:23,341
What about a game?

525
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,511
Let's go, quick!

526
01:10:47,297 --> 01:10:48,579
We'll settle it later!

527
01:10:49,607 --> 01:10:50,688
Come!

528
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,827
- Get it down yourself!
- No, you'll die under it.

529
01:10:56,968 --> 01:10:58,600
Quick, get it down!

530
01:10:58,771 --> 01:11:02,194
Bill will roll on the floor laughing
when he'll find you under this chest.

531
01:11:02,694 --> 01:11:07,110
He'll think that you're just a thief
who wanted to steal his gold.

532
01:11:07,483 --> 01:11:10,488
That's enough,
I can't bear it any longer.

533
01:11:10,552 --> 01:11:11,633
Listen to me, beast.

534
01:11:12,631 --> 01:11:15,885
Bill thinks that you're just
a brainless mountain of muscles.

535
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:18,780
And he's right.

536
01:11:19,336 --> 01:11:23,358
You're also a coward, a fat coward!

537
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:54,577
Hurry, get in.

538
01:12:29,907 --> 01:12:31,107
Why did you stop?

539
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:56,310
This wagon will never get there.

540
01:12:57,525 --> 01:12:58,474
The chest will.

541
01:12:59,642 --> 01:13:01,603
The chest will?

542
01:13:15,996 --> 01:13:17,255
Miguel!

543
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,483
- They took the gold!
- And the wagon too!

544
01:13:33,554 --> 01:13:34,741
Follow me!

545
01:14:10,963 --> 01:14:13,206
He's just like me, he doesn't like water.

546
01:14:47,647 --> 01:14:50,576
We have to swim to the shore.
Look!

547
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,953
- Don't even think about it!
- I forgot that you couldn't swim.

548
01:14:54,599 --> 01:14:56,033
I don't care.

549
01:14:58,936 --> 01:15:01,405
Water isn't really warm, but...

550
01:15:02,011 --> 01:15:03,451
Come on, don't be stupid.

551
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:05,335
Hang on to me.

552
01:15:07,779 --> 01:15:11,911
What did you tell me when
I was carrying the chest?

553
01:15:12,723 --> 01:15:16,891
I remember, you said that I was a fat coward!

554
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:19,000
Come on, hurry.

555
01:15:20,932 --> 01:15:22,073
I'm going.

556
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:25,682
Wait.

557
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,776
Come on!

558
01:16:23,388 --> 01:16:26,880
It was a good idea to burry this chest.

559
01:16:30,195 --> 01:16:34,327
It'll be safer on the hill than inside a bank

560
01:16:34,622 --> 01:16:36,699
while we're away.

561
01:16:40,352 --> 01:16:41,781
- While we're away?
- Yes.

562
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:44,664
We have to warn the agency...

563
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:48,593
You want to stay here?

564
01:16:51,484 --> 01:16:55,280
Your buddy still owes me
10,000 dollars from the last game.

565
01:16:55,484 --> 01:16:57,562
No, no. You'll come with me.

566
01:17:00,254 --> 01:17:02,905
The fact that you got me
out of the water...

567
01:17:03,456 --> 01:17:06,796
doesn't give you the right
to tell me what I must...

568
01:17:08,992 --> 01:17:10,632
or mustn't do.

569
01:17:10,855 --> 01:17:15,616
I should have left you there.

570
01:17:17,427 --> 01:17:19,702
You wouldn't have gone far.

571
01:17:19,971 --> 01:17:21,109
Anyway,

572
01:17:21,544 --> 01:17:26,673
once we'll have warned the agency
your share of gold will be enough...

573
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,819
to pay for Bill's debts.

574
01:17:29,891 --> 01:17:31,970
It's another story.

575
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:36,531
Also, do you really think
that I'd be satisfied...

576
01:17:37,879 --> 01:17:39,920
with a small share?

577
01:17:43,347 --> 01:17:47,395
You're the one working for
this agency, not me.

578
01:17:49,394 --> 01:17:51,218
If that's how you take it...

579
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,622
you'll come with me for sure.

580
01:17:54,386 --> 01:17:58,470
Or we can settle this affair right now.

581
01:17:59,262 --> 01:18:01,469
Gunshots make a lot of noise.

582
01:18:04,424 --> 01:18:07,711
And I don't think it's the right
time to make some noise.

583
01:18:12,642 --> 01:18:15,681
There's another way to convince you.

584
01:18:23,446 --> 01:18:25,734
There's one thing that I don't understand.

585
01:18:32,533 --> 01:18:33,601
What is it?

586
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:44,062
Why do you want me to smash....

587
01:18:47,742 --> 01:18:50,699
your dirty dog face?

588
01:19:07,705 --> 01:19:09,241
Get down!

589
01:19:09,347 --> 01:19:10,296
I'm coming.

590
01:20:04,942 --> 01:20:06,937
You fucking bastard!

591
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,923
Cheers...

592
01:20:30,563 --> 01:20:34,235
I would have never thought that
the three of us would meet again...

593
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,406
after all this time.

594
01:20:37,691 --> 01:20:39,324
Me neither.

595
01:20:44,361 --> 01:20:46,486
You should be more wary
of your old friends.

596
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,664
I wanted to have some peace...

597
01:20:49,657 --> 01:20:51,387
minding my own business...

598
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,145
then you came, killed 3 of my men...

599
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,761
robbed me...

600
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:02,257
and wanted to leave without
even saying good bye.

601
01:21:07,018 --> 01:21:10,058
Tell me, ghost,
what's your new name?

602
01:21:12,298 --> 01:21:16,346
If only people could mind
their own business...

603
01:21:18,157 --> 01:21:21,245
Yet, you tried to see me a year ago.

604
01:21:21,493 --> 01:21:24,018
Are you upset for a few blank bullets?

605
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:25,424
Yours were real.

606
01:21:28,142 --> 01:21:30,135
You should thank me, Doc.

607
01:21:30,423 --> 01:21:34,592
I could have killed you if I wanted to.

608
01:21:35,238 --> 01:21:36,354
It wouldn't have helped your affairs.

609
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:43,414
You managed to get rid of your men
since they went looking for me.

610
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:49,271
It was a good idea.

611
01:21:49,984 --> 01:21:56,026
This trick helped me to get rid of
all those who wanted me dead...

612
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,948
my men included.

613
01:22:00,628 --> 01:22:02,753
They weren't of any use to me anymore.

614
01:22:03,557 --> 01:22:05,596
It's great to be alive...

615
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:09,138
without anybody knowing it.

616
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:15,268
So I'd like to know who
told you that I was around here.

617
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:19,398
You didn't kill all the
passengers on that train.

618
01:22:20,948 --> 01:22:22,104
One of them survived...

619
01:22:23,228 --> 01:22:28,440
and told me that you were still alive.

620
01:22:32,834 --> 01:22:37,713
That's why I have to do everything
by myself, isn't it Bud?

621
01:22:41,153 --> 01:22:43,276
I'll remember it next time.

622
01:22:47,325 --> 01:22:50,532
There won't be a next time, ghost.

623
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,009
You're so ungrateful.

624
01:22:58,788 --> 01:23:02,919
I saved you because they would
have killed you for sure.

625
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:07,135
And you won't tell me where
you've hidden my gold.

626
01:23:08,371 --> 01:23:11,541
Why hide it anyway?
Only Bud could believe...

627
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:15,190
that it's been lost in the river.
It's obvious.

628
01:23:15,452 --> 01:23:17,445
Otherwise, why would you fight?

629
01:23:18,852 --> 01:23:22,140
I'll finally know who is
the bravest of you two.

630
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,643
It looks like it's Ayrton,
but we never know.

631
01:23:27,945 --> 01:23:32,244
What do you think, Bud?
No, Bud isn't allowed to think.

632
01:23:34,668 --> 01:23:35,932
If he could...

633
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,589
he would have killed you already.
But you see, Bud...

634
01:23:40,586 --> 01:23:44,754
they're the only ones to
know where our gold is.

635
01:23:45,405 --> 01:23:47,234
You probably think...

636
01:23:50,504 --> 01:23:52,545
that they won't talk.

637
01:23:54,187 --> 01:23:55,351
But you're wrong.

638
01:23:55,872 --> 01:23:59,091
And do you know who will
help us to find the gold?

639
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:01,577
The weakest?
No, not at all.

640
01:24:03,264 --> 01:24:08,227
If you keep two men perfectly matched,
just like two animals...

641
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:12,028
they'll never die at the same time.

642
01:24:18,507 --> 01:24:21,512
Even if it's just for a second...

643
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:23,700
one of them will survive.

644
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,047
I've known you for too long...

645
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:33,174
I know you far too well to not
be aware of your weaknesses.

646
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:10,219
So?

647
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:16,020
Raise your arm when
you'll feel like talking.

648
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:17,742
I'm not in a hurry.

649
01:25:55,466 --> 01:25:57,083
Pull him up, quick.

650
01:26:20,872 --> 01:26:23,458
So?
Did you change your mind?

651
01:26:32,725 --> 01:26:33,904
To the bottom!

652
01:26:40,724 --> 01:26:42,520
Targo, come here!

653
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,525
Nobody must come in here
while I'm away, understood?

654
01:26:51,661 --> 01:26:52,810
Not Bud nor Pedrito.

655
01:26:53,121 --> 01:26:56,292
Nobody must come in here,
whatever the reason.

656
01:26:56,789 --> 01:26:58,914
Shoot those who disobey, understood?

657
01:27:00,183 --> 01:27:02,864
It'll take him some time
to change his mind.

658
01:27:03,241 --> 01:27:04,856
But we're in no hurry.

659
01:27:05,226 --> 01:27:08,350
I'm counting on you, do a good job.

660
01:27:09,456 --> 01:27:10,489
Lock yourself up.

661
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:17,698
I don't want to see those faces!

662
01:27:19,157 --> 01:27:20,768
We'll get our gold back.

663
01:27:21,037 --> 01:27:23,163
Bud and Targo know what to do.

664
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:28,149
Nobody must disturb them.

665
01:27:28,296 --> 01:27:30,421
But keep an eye on them still.

666
01:27:30,768 --> 01:27:34,173
You two!
Go and watch Bud at the well.

667
01:27:35,123 --> 01:27:36,297
Hurry!

668
01:27:38,088 --> 01:27:41,340
Shoot him in the legs if he gets away.

669
01:27:43,269 --> 01:27:47,274
I don't want anybody dead,
because the dead don't talk.

670
01:27:47,577 --> 01:27:50,274
Pedrito and his men will watch the cave.

671
01:27:50,378 --> 01:27:52,884
Targo mustn't move from there either.

672
01:27:53,734 --> 01:27:56,392
Why can't we take care of the gringos?

673
01:27:56,779 --> 01:27:58,313
Obey me!

674
01:28:00,616 --> 01:28:02,392
Let's go.

675
01:28:18,997 --> 01:28:22,000
Get up, it's time for a bath.

676
01:28:27,566 --> 01:28:30,690
I'll take you there
if you don't tell anybody.

677
01:28:44,573 --> 01:28:48,703
You won't have to share it
with anyone, Bud.

678
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:50,066
Think about it.

679
01:29:52,037 --> 01:29:53,280
What is...

680
01:30:53,524 --> 01:30:56,612
It's not the time to rest.
Stand up!

681
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:01,937
And if I told you that we've arrived?

682
01:31:14,299 --> 01:31:16,293
Calm down, buddy.

683
01:31:17,047 --> 01:31:19,290
We make mistakes when
we're in a hurry.

684
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:22,573
I never said that we don't.

685
01:31:24,798 --> 01:31:26,073
Your gun...

686
01:31:27,203 --> 01:31:29,328
Your hand is next to it...

687
01:31:37,005 --> 01:31:38,192
Very well.

688
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:41,880
Untie me.

689
01:31:53,973 --> 01:31:55,883
Move, quick!

690
01:32:15,294 --> 01:32:17,254
The gold should be here.

691
01:32:20,787 --> 01:32:21,784
Dig!

692
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:29,732
No, now, it's your turn to dig.

693
01:32:30,615 --> 01:32:32,741
I told you to dig.

694
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,305
Didn't anyone ever tell you...

695
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,264
that you're a fucking asshole?

696
01:33:16,437 --> 01:33:17,578
Where is he?

697
01:33:18,488 --> 01:33:19,522
Where is he?

698
01:33:24,643 --> 01:33:25,711
Stop!

699
01:33:28,027 --> 01:33:28,836
When?

700
01:33:28,861 --> 01:33:32,539
They had an agreement.
Otherwise they wouldn't have escaped.

701
01:33:32,636 --> 01:33:33,634
It's not true!

702
01:33:33,722 --> 01:33:34,636
When?

703
01:33:35,016 --> 01:33:38,680
I noticed it at dawn.
The texan was supposed to watch him.

704
01:33:38,787 --> 01:33:42,919
When I woke up, he was there,
near the well...

705
01:33:43,075 --> 01:33:44,219
his throat slit.

706
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:46,850
So you were sleeping?

707
01:33:47,502 --> 01:33:51,149
Just for a few minutes.
He was the one supposed to watch Bud.

708
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:52,390
And you didn't follow them?

709
01:33:53,181 --> 01:33:54,703
- The horses...
- What?

710
01:33:54,883 --> 01:33:56,399
They set them free.

711
01:33:56,489 --> 01:33:58,567
They probably had an agreement.

712
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:03,563
There's no way that
this scumbag didn't hear them.

713
01:34:03,674 --> 01:34:05,141
What?

714
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:07,148
What?

715
01:34:13,434 --> 01:34:16,474
They put some clothes around
the horses hooves.

716
01:34:17,003 --> 01:34:19,723
A good job... but it takes time.

717
01:34:21,683 --> 01:34:24,686
You only slept for a few minutes?

718
01:34:35,866 --> 01:34:36,862
Let's go!

719
01:34:38,895 --> 01:34:40,856
What about us, what do we do?

720
01:34:41,371 --> 01:34:43,413
Try to not fall asleep.

721
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:53,825
Gimme something to drink.

722
01:35:10,031 --> 01:35:14,115
You must be the man I need.

723
01:35:16,557 --> 01:35:17,637
For what?

724
01:35:20,984 --> 01:35:25,069
Can you repeat the few words
I'm going to tell you?

725
01:35:28,922 --> 01:35:29,954
Very well.

726
01:35:34,211 --> 01:35:37,401
Take the horse and go tell to
the leader of these men...

727
01:35:37,602 --> 01:35:40,809
that the time has come to
finish the game started a year ago.

728
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:48,648
You know what I mean?

729
01:35:51,757 --> 01:35:52,796
Yes...

730
01:35:53,077 --> 01:35:54,492
I think I do.

731
01:35:56,444 --> 01:35:57,478
Great.

732
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:08,270
Since you have a good memory...

733
01:36:13,592 --> 01:36:15,634
do me another favor.

734
01:36:15,753 --> 01:36:17,350
Of course.

735
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,705
Tell him that I hate latecomers.

736
01:36:33,657 --> 01:36:34,634
Open, you bastard!

737
01:36:34,972 --> 01:36:36,005
Open!

738
01:36:36,372 --> 01:36:38,495
I want to talk to the gringo!

739
01:36:41,366 --> 01:36:42,362
Open!

740
01:36:43,397 --> 01:36:46,521
The other gringo is gone,
he left with Bud.

741
01:36:47,276 --> 01:36:50,069
Open, I want to take care of this one.

742
01:36:50,534 --> 01:36:52,982
Leave him to me!
I'm telling you to open!

743
01:36:58,630 --> 01:37:02,715
Dirty son of a bitch!

744
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:08,766
Leave me alone,
I must talk to your boss.

745
01:38:09,082 --> 01:38:10,712
Don't worry, tell us everything.

746
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,087
Hey, you!

747
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:17,318
Where did you get this horse?

748
01:38:17,613 --> 01:38:21,306
Let me go,
I must talk to Mr. Bud now.

749
01:38:22,174 --> 01:38:25,344
He'll thank me for the information I'll give him.

750
01:38:26,056 --> 01:38:28,133
It's a good thing that I met you.

751
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:30,613
Take me to him please.

752
01:38:31,088 --> 01:38:33,082
Who gave you this horse?

753
01:38:33,329 --> 01:38:35,324
The American.
He's the one who gave it to me.

754
01:38:35,588 --> 01:38:36,622
Where is he?

755
01:38:38,369 --> 01:38:39,933
At the inn.

756
01:38:40,169 --> 01:38:42,248
He's waiting. He told me...

757
01:39:21,797 --> 01:39:22,831
Come here.

758
01:39:36,988 --> 01:39:37,985
Wait!

759
01:39:38,683 --> 01:39:39,716
Don't kill him!

760
01:39:40,819 --> 01:39:43,433
He must be alive, understood?

761
01:39:54,736 --> 01:39:55,815
Too many people.

762
01:39:58,689 --> 01:39:59,730
Yes...

763
01:40:00,132 --> 01:40:01,247
Too many people.

764
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:08,928
Calm down, buddy.
Calm down.

765
01:40:09,878 --> 01:40:13,047
You'll be the only one to shoot
if it's so much fun to you.

766
01:40:13,442 --> 01:40:15,015
I hate playing without an outlay.

767
01:40:15,088 --> 01:40:19,546
And during a real game,
we put the outlay on the table.

768
01:40:20,771 --> 01:40:21,888
All right.

769
01:40:24,038 --> 01:40:25,201
Come on, come.

770
01:40:27,225 --> 01:40:28,389
Wait.

771
01:40:29,424 --> 01:40:31,085
We're not in a hurry.

772
01:40:31,504 --> 01:40:33,582
I have a proposition to make.

773
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:38,744
I had to plan this job a year ago.

774
01:40:38,955 --> 01:40:43,123
People were coming from everywhere
to kill me and get a reward.

775
01:40:43,286 --> 01:40:45,882
I couldn't trust anybody.

776
01:40:46,093 --> 01:40:48,053
Not even my men.

777
01:40:51,835 --> 01:40:55,468
It was the only way to get
rid of everybody.

778
01:40:56,607 --> 01:40:58,816
But you had nothing to do with it.

779
01:40:59,843 --> 01:41:01,753
I'm sorry.

780
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:03,946
I'll make it up to you.

781
01:41:05,264 --> 01:41:08,223
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

782
01:41:09,527 --> 01:41:11,521
In business, the strongest is in charge.

783
01:41:11,581 --> 01:41:15,714
Yesterday, I was the strongest,
but I had to meet someone...

784
01:41:15,859 --> 01:41:19,966
very important who couldn't wait.

785
01:41:20,457 --> 01:41:21,491
And I did the right thing.

786
01:41:21,754 --> 01:41:26,921
I made a better deal than the
one we're currently talking about.

787
01:41:31,723 --> 01:41:35,538
My proposition is very simple.

788
01:41:37,128 --> 01:41:39,254
We could be partners.

789
01:41:40,174 --> 01:41:41,171
Me and you.

790
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,741
Like good old time.

791
01:41:44,507 --> 01:41:45,706
What about our friend?

792
01:41:47,296 --> 01:41:49,413
Let me tell you.

793
01:41:49,788 --> 01:41:51,829
You'll accept.

794
01:41:52,161 --> 01:41:53,952
And what about our friend?

795
01:41:54,577 --> 01:41:57,413
No need to worry about him.

796
01:41:57,843 --> 01:41:59,091
He's in good hands.

797
01:42:13,310 --> 01:42:15,388
Calm down, Targo, calm down.

798
01:42:17,274 --> 01:42:19,103
Don't shoot!

799
01:42:46,384 --> 01:42:49,472
There's one thing you didn't understand.

800
01:42:51,328 --> 01:42:54,499
I'm the one handing out
the cards this time.

801
01:42:57,844 --> 01:43:00,884
Our ways of thinking are way too different.

802
01:43:01,723 --> 01:43:03,717
If I wanted to see you...

803
01:43:05,773 --> 01:43:09,988
it's most definitely not to
do some business with you.

804
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:13,642
Think about it a little.

805
01:43:14,892 --> 01:43:20,017
Do you want to know where what the
idiots call my luck come from?

806
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:22,493
Why I've managed to pull...

807
01:43:22,621 --> 01:43:25,875
lucrative jobs without any trouble
for years?

808
01:43:26,562 --> 01:43:27,560
Let me tell you.

809
01:43:28,018 --> 01:43:33,183
The owner of the El Paso bank
is insuring the transportation of his goods.

810
01:43:33,733 --> 01:43:38,030
He gives me the day and the time
of the train departure...

811
01:43:38,852 --> 01:43:43,814
as well as all the safety measures
taken by the agency.

812
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:46,858
I take care of the rest.

813
01:43:47,752 --> 01:43:52,610
There's no risk.
Not for him, not for me.

814
01:43:52,873 --> 01:43:56,392
It's always lucrative jobs,
without anything unexpected.

815
01:43:57,344 --> 01:44:00,384
He's a contact you have
to keep very closely.

816
01:44:00,977 --> 01:44:04,147
He's the one who advised me
to disappear last year.

817
01:44:05,154 --> 01:44:06,353
Listen to me, Doc.

818
01:44:08,049 --> 01:44:11,711
You're the only one
to whom I ever told that.

819
01:44:12,844 --> 01:44:13,923
And do you know why?

820
01:44:16,773 --> 01:44:17,890
Why?

821
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:22,720
Because I know I can trust you.

822
01:44:23,936 --> 01:44:25,182
You're wrong, ghost.

823
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:31,071
We don't share the same point of view.

824
01:44:34,052 --> 01:44:37,056
I only agree on one thing.

825
01:44:50,129 --> 01:44:52,289
We'll put the outlay on the table.

826
01:45:10,004 --> 01:45:12,127
Do you know what I'm gonna do, ghost?

827
01:45:14,987 --> 01:45:19,237
I'll offer you the same thing
you did last year.

828
01:45:20,201 --> 01:45:24,536
I don't see how you'll be able
to set those rocks on fire.

829
01:45:25,185 --> 01:45:26,386
It's a little difficult.

830
01:45:28,263 --> 01:45:30,257
I'm not talking about fire.

831
01:45:34,338 --> 01:45:36,298
But about dynamite.

832
01:45:56,549 --> 01:46:01,057
A charge enough to make you fly.

833
01:46:02,104 --> 01:46:04,146
There won't be any trap this time.

834
01:46:52,728 --> 01:46:54,722
Drop your guns!

835
01:47:00,817 --> 01:47:02,942
Don't you want to come to the party?

836
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,806
We don't fight with hyenas in my family.

837
01:47:07,503 --> 01:47:09,547
It's a shame.

838
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:12,047
Dead hyenas don't talk.

839
01:47:13,078 --> 01:47:15,155
Explain yourself, bastard.

840
01:47:15,712 --> 01:47:18,835
As you can see,
the chest is where we left it...

841
01:47:19,681 --> 01:47:21,925
but it doesn't mean that
it's full of gold.

842
01:47:23,016 --> 01:47:25,314
You can check it if you want.

843
01:47:27,567 --> 01:47:29,478
You were cheating then.

844
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:34,629
Don't be upset by a little joke.

845
01:47:35,163 --> 01:47:36,112
You love jokes.

846
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:38,128
Shut up!
And move back.

847
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:39,626
It's your last dirty trick, ghost.

848
01:48:41,415 --> 01:48:42,564
Quick!

849
01:48:44,338 --> 01:48:48,636
It doesn't matter if you lost a leg.

850
01:48:51,253 --> 01:48:54,293
We'll see if you're gonna fool me again.

851
01:49:52,999 --> 01:49:55,042
Crawl, you dirty vermin.

852
01:50:29,626 --> 01:50:32,666
You're one hell of a troublemaker.

853
01:51:36,767 --> 01:51:39,726
You know, I dreamed...

854
01:51:40,824 --> 01:51:45,039
that a mountain was falling on me.

855
01:51:46,357 --> 01:51:48,482
My shoulders still hurt.

856
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,392
Where are we going?

857
01:51:53,482 --> 01:51:57,864
North, we must remove the lead 
that's inside your body.

858
01:51:59,301 --> 01:52:01,261
Stupid fool...

859
01:52:03,317 --> 01:52:04,567
And what about all this?

860
01:52:07,611 --> 01:52:10,733
We'll talk about it when you'll be able 
to defend yourself again.
