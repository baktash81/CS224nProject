1
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,479
Mod f x square dx.

2
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:43,404
So please finish Percival
by next time.

3
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:47,446
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.

4
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,407
Thank you, Steven.

5
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:59,709
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

6
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:02,507
And I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

7
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:05,383
Now, the person to do so
will not only be in my good graces...

8
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,759
but also go on to fame and fortune...

9
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:11,639
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

10
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:14,682
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

11
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:18,676
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

12
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:23,438
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. Professors.

13
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,025
Well, that's all.

14
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:29,444
If you have any questions,
I'm sure that Tom has the answers.

15
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,978
- Hi, Will.
- Kirsten, how you doing?

16
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,393
- I'm all right. How are you?
- Good.

17
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:13,895
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.
- No?

18
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:15,306
- No.
- Why not?

19
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:18,361
- I don't know. Cathy!
- What?

20
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:21,856
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty
little hoochie-woochie you usually throw at me?

21
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:25,739
Oh, fuck you and your Irish curse,
Chuckie.

22
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:29,736
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

23
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:33,205
- So go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

24
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,243
Toot-Toots!

25
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,461
She's missin' a tooth, Will.

26
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,589
She's got skin problems.
I don't...

27
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,337
Plus, it's like 5-to-2, Morgan ends
up marryin' her, you know what I mean?

28
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:47,504
There's only so many times you can bang
your friend's future wife.

29
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:50,093
It's wrong.
Where you goin'?

30
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:54,683
- I'm gonna take off.
- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's like, what, 10:00?

31
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,016
I'm tired.

32
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:01,182
Irish curse?

33
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:04,186
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

34
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,458
- Out!
- Stop brushing me back.

35
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:18,749
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

36
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,001
You're gonna get charged,
you know that.

37
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,883
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

38
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:31,639
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar, uh, at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

39
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,843
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:37,974
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
You'll probably fit right in.

41
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,520
Ow! Fuckin' punk!

42
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:45,359
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

43
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,817
- You want this?
- Ah, come on, come on. That's it.

44
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:55,610
I'd hold you forever here

45
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:59,328
In my arms

46
00:07:59,457 --> 00:08:01,034
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

47
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,998
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

48
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:08,912
Come here. It's Saturday!

49
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:11,539
Unless you want to have a drink
with me tonight.

50
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:14,676
Maybe. We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

51
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:18,468
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

52
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:44,316
This is correct.
Who did this?

53
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:46,659
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

54
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:49,413
- Nemesh?
- No way.

55
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:56,249
- Come on, Joey Mac!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

56
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,752
Come on, kid!

57
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:01,124
- Joey, dig it out of there. Dig it out!
- I love the pitch!

58
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:04,674
Lay it down, Mac. That's how to do it!
Attaboy! Take two, Mac, take two!

59
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,385
- Nice hit.
- Taylor, you're up.

60
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:12,215
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with
the striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

61
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,269
- Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

62
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:18,847
Lt's that fuckin' guinea. I hate
that little bitch. Will knows him.

63
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:21,354
- You know him?
- Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.

64
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:23,477
That kid used to beat the shit out of me
in kindergarten.

65
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:25,354
- That guy?
- Yeah.

66
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:29,404
Fuck this.
Let's get some food.

67
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,656
Oh, what, Morgan,
you're not gonna go talk to her?

68
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:33,113
Fuck her.

69
00:09:33,244 --> 00:09:35,865
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

70
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:38,997
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's
just 'cause you like the take-out girl.

71
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:43,536
- It's 15 minutes out of our way.
- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?

72
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:46,913
Double burger.

73
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,542
Double burger?

74
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:54,918
Chuck I had a double burger

75
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:57,759
Would you shut the fuck up?
I know what you ordered. I was there.

76
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,891
- So give me my fuckin' sandwich.
- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.

77
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,726
Morgan, how much money you got on you?

78
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:06,766
I said I'd get change when I get the snow
cone. I said that before when we pulled up.

79
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,104
Why don't you just gimme my sandwich
and stop bein' a prick?

80
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:13,811
All right, well, give me your fuckin' 16 cents that you
got on you now. We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.

81
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,812
Here we go. Keep it right up here
for ya. We'll put you on a programme.

82
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:21,234
Every day you come in with your six cents.
At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.

83
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:25,068
- Are you gonna be an asshole?
- What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare?

84
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:26,996
I think you should establish
a good line of credit.

85
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:30,408
Like how you bought your couch:
Payment plans.

86
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,294
Remember how your mother brought
in ten dollars every day for a year?

87
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,163
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

88
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:38,582
- Can I have my food now, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

89
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:42,756
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold up, Chuck.

90
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:45,175
- Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

91
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:47,878
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

92
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:51,265
- Yeah, you, you skank face!
- Shut the fuck up!

93
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:54,347
- Let's get outta here. - What are
you worried about? - Come on, Will.

94
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,139
Why don't you lick my love stick?

95
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:59,688
We just seen the guy 15 minutes ago at the park.
If we was gonna fight him, we should fight him then.

96
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:02,652
- We got snacks now.
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.

97
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,936
- I'm not goin'. - So
don't go. - I am not goin'!

98
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:07,479
Fuckin' go, Morgan.

99
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:11,944
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not out there in
two fuckin' seconds, when I'm done with them, you're next.

100
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,122
Carmine, it's me. It's me, Will.
Remember? We went to kindergarten together.

101
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:20,625
Way down the street
there's a light in his place

102
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:23,289
He opens the door
He's got that look on his face

103
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:33,884
- Fuckin', let's go, man!
- Step on his fuckin' head.

104
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:37,962
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

105
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:46,308
Motherfucker, die!

106
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,978
- Carter!
- Come on!

107
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:04,653
Will! Will, come on! Come on.

108
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:08,161
Will, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

109
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,994
- Easy, brother, easy.
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.

110
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:15,003
- Come here.
- Whoa, whoa!

111
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,839
Fuck!

112
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:35,438
Ls this just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

113
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:40,979
Well, by no stretch of my imagination do I
believe you've all come here to hear me lecture.

114
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:46,105
Or rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

115
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:51,032
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

116
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:05,795
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

117
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:08,711
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

118
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:12,461
However, um, my colleagues and I
have conferred...

119
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:15,632
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

120
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:17,888
that took us more than two years
to prove.

121
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:22,551
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down...

122
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:26,732
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigour.

123
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,444
- Hi.
- When's the arraignment?

124
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,452
Next week.

125
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:14,689
- Sorry. - What are
you doing? - Sorry.

126
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:17,187
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

127
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:20,069
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

128
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:23,148
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

129
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:47,501
Oh, my God.

130
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:56,306
Looks right.

131
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:14,649
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

132
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:17,356
I mean, how hard is it to push
a motherfuckin' broom around the room?

133
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:19,948
Mitch, you got fired from pushin'
a fuckin' broom.

134
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,822
I got fired 'cause management
was restructuring.

135
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,909
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.

136
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,117
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

137
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:30,620
- At least I got a motherfuckin' job right now, don't I?
- Yeah.

138
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:35,297
- Why did you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Uh, management was restructuring.

139
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:39,339
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.
- Can he do that?

140
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,716
- You kiddin' me? I asked you yesterday if I could get a job.
- And I told you "no" yesterday.

141
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:46,386
- What's up, Case? - What's
up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?

142
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:52,478
Let's sit over here.

143
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:02,272
Oh, this is,
this is a Harvard bar, huh?

144
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:04,944
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the walls.

145
00:16:06,826 --> 00:16:10,693
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

146
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:21,796
Time-out. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.

147
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:25,421
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

148
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:43,898
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

149
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:45,933
- Hi, how are ya?
- Fine.

150
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:48,107
- So, do you ladies, uh...
- Come here often?

151
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:53,230
Do I come here? I come here a bit. I'm
here, uh, uh, you know, from time to time.

152
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,607
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

153
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:59,610
- Yeah. That's it. Yes, I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah?

154
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:02,071
- What class?
- History.

155
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,124
- Maybe.
- Yes, I think that's what it was.

156
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:08,750
You don't necessarily... May not
remember me. You know, I like it here.

157
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:11,085
It doesn't mean 'cause I go here,
I'm a genius.

158
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:12,494
- I am very smart.
- Hey.

159
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,838
- Hey! How's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

160
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,505
- You wanna...
- What, uh... What class did you, did you say that was?

161
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,510
- History.
- History. Yeah.

162
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,137
Just history? Lt must've been
a survey course then, huh?

163
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,808
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

164
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,603
You should check it out. It's
a good course. It'd be a good class.

165
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:29,187
How'd you like that course?

166
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:34,188
You know, frankly, I found the class,
you know, rather, uh, elementary.

167
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:36,393
Elementary. You know,
I don't doubt that it was.

168
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:39,777
- Yeah.
- I, uh, I remember that class.

169
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:43,653
It was, um, it was
just between recess and lunch.

170
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:46,274
Clark, why don't you go away?

171
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,486
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go just away?

172
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,494
I'm just having fun with my new friend.
That's all.

173
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:53,576
- What, we gonna have a problem?
- No, no, no, no, no. There's no problem here.

174
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:57,622
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...

175
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:01,003
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

176
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:04,915
My contention is that, uh,
prior to the Revolutionary War...

177
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:09,298
the economic modalities,
especially in the southern colonies...

178
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,051
could most aptly be characterized as...

179
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:13,973
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you something. All right?

180
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:16,342
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

181
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:19,644
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian, Pete Garrison, probably.

182
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:22,642
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

183
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:26,024
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

184
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:28,939
were entrepreneurial and capitalist
way back in 1740.

185
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:32,570
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood...

186
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,700
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

187
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:40,120
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

188
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:44,245
Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because
Wood drastically underestimates the impact of...

189
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:48,076
"Wood drastically, Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of social distinctions...

190
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:51,249
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth"?

191
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:55,545
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?

192
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,168
Yeah, I read that, too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?

193
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,969
Do you have any thoughts, uh,
of your own on this matter?

194
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,677
Or do you... Is that your thing?
You come into a bar.

195
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,269
You read some obscure passage and then
pretend... You, You pawn it off as your own...

196
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:13,141
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?

197
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:16,893
See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years
you're gonna start doin' some thinkin' on your own.

198
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,400
And you're gonna come up with the fact
that there are two certainties in life.

199
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:22,200
One: Don't do that.

200
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:25,076
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

201
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:28,368
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.

202
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,995
Yeah, but I will have a degree...

203
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:37,039
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

204
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:41,589
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.

205
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:46,299
But I mean, if you have a problem with that, I mean,
we could just step outside. We could figure it out.

206
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:51,676
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.

207
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:54,049
- It's cool?
- Yeah. - Cool.

208
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:56,592
- Fuckin' damn right, it's cool.
- How do you like me now?

209
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,972
My boy's wicked smart.

210
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:07,397
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place, and run into a barney, huh?

211
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:11,318
Well, there it is.
Hello, nice to meet ya.

212
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,403
They were fine, man. I was gonna...
We was gonna close the deal...

213
00:20:14,535 --> 00:20:17,821
but then Chuck, uh,
Billy insulted one of 'em...

214
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:21,537
and the heavyset girl said that I even had a
receding hairline, and I was a few pounds overweight.

215
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,908
And I was like, "Go fuck yourself. "

216
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:27,417
I swallowed a bug.

217
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:30,089
Hi.

218
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:32,920
- You're an idiot.
- What?

219
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:37,428
You're an idiot. I've been sitting over there for
45 minutes waiting for you to come and talk to me.

220
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:39,796
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

221
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:42,601
And I, I couldn't sit there any more
waiting for you.

222
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:44,683
- Wh... I'm Will.
- Skylar.

223
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,435
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way...

224
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:50,013
that guy over there,
Michael Bolton clone...

225
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,106
he wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.

226
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,107
Yeah, I know.
I kinda got that impression.

227
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:57,402
Good. Okay.
Well, I've got to go.

228
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,479
Gotta get up early and waste some
more money on my overpriced education.

229
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:04,154
- No, I didn't mean you. I...
- Ah, that's all right.

230
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:07,571
There's my number. So maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.

231
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:11,749
All right, yeah. May-Maybe we can just
get together and eat a bunch of caramels.

232
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:15,623
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it, it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.

233
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:18,375
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

234
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:21,507
- Uh, right, then.
- Come on.

235
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:31,433
- Yo! - Fuck you, bitch!
- Hey, fuck you the same.

236
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,141
- There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with their skiin' trip.
- Hold up. Hold up.

237
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,436
I should've beat that old bitch's ass.

238
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,979
Do you like apples?

239
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:50,482
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

240
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:55,409
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

241
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:04,499
We arrived tonight

242
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:09,336
The miles were over me

243
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:16,209
I turned off the light

244
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:21,219
So, come on, night

245
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:28,312
Everyone is gone

246
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:34,103
Home to oblivion

247
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:41,365
So come on

248
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:45,704
So come on by

249
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,413
Tom.

250
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,537
Excuse me. Is this the Buildings
and Grounds office?

251
00:22:57,673 --> 00:22:59,879
Yeah. What can I do for you?

252
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:01,965
I just need the name of a student
who works here.

253
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:04,465
- No students work for me.
- Well, could you please check?

254
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,718
I have this guy who works
in my building. He's about this high.

255
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:09,516
- Which one is your building?
- Two.

256
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:11,800
Two. Building two.

257
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,390
- Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.
- No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

258
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:22,435
I just need his name.

259
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,439
I can't give you his name
unless you have a complaint.

260
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,738
- This is Professor Lambeau.
- And this is Professor Hayes.

261
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,439
Tom, please.

262
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,703
This is important. Please.

263
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:40,745
Willy didn't show up for work today.

264
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:42,952
Got this job through his P.O.
You can call him.

265
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:47,084
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

266
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:52,842
Thank you.

267
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:56,011
Asshole.

268
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:03,432
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honour, going back to 1789...

269
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:06,812
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

270
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,233
if that act is deemed a defence against
tyranny, a defence of liberty.

271
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,689
Your Honour, Henry Ward Beecher, in Proverbs from
the Plymouth Pulpit, 1887, said, and I quote...

272
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,194
- 1887? This is the 20th century, Your Honour.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

273
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,068
- He's gonna make a mockery of the courtroom.
- I am afforded the right...

274
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:24,245
to speak in my own defence, sir, by
the Constitution of the United States.

275
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:27,206
- This is the same document which guarantees my liberty.
- Don't tell me about the Constitution of the United States.

276
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,787
And liberty, in case you've forgotten,
is a souI's right to breathe.

277
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:32,373
And when it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

278
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:34,791
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

279
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:38,006
- Ibid., Your Honour.
- Son, my turn.

280
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:42,794
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

281
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:46,795
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

282
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:49,008
September '93, assault.

283
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:52,641
Grand theft auto, February of '94.

284
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,981
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

285
00:24:57,107 --> 00:25:01,436
"free property rights of horse
and carriage" from 1798.

286
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,902
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

287
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:08,980
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

288
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:12,700
I'm also aware that you've
been through several foster homes.

289
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:16,992
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

290
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:21,252
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

291
00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:25,671
Motion to dismiss is denied.
$50,000 bail.

292
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,336
- Thank you.
- Court, rise.

293
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:33,002
- Hello?
- Uh, Skylar?

294
00:25:33,138 --> 00:25:35,296
- Yep.
- Hey, uh, it's Will.

295
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:37,009
- Who?
- It's Will.

296
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:40,177
You know, the really funny, good-looking
guy you met at the bar the other night.

297
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,845
I don't recall meeting anyone who matched
that description. I think I'd remember.

298
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,146
Oh, all right, you got me. It's
the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

299
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:49,397
who got hammered
and wouldn't leave you alone all night.

300
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:53,570
Oh, Will! I remember.

301
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:56,946
- How are you? I-I was wondering
if you'd call me. - Yeah, look.

302
00:25:57,074 --> 00:25:58,782
- I was wondering...
- Yo, so, baby. What's up?

303
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:00,569
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing?

304
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:03,110
- Hey!
- What's up, baby? Want some of my ass?

305
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:06,864
- Herve! I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
- What's up, baby? What you doing?

306
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,206
Ah, yeah, sorry about that. Um...

307
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:12,039
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together, um, sometime this week.

308
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,495
You know, sit out at a cafe.
Maybe have some caramels.

309
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:16,919
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.
- Yeah?

310
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,923
Yeah. Sure. Where are you?

311
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:21,838
Um, well, actually, this is, uh,
this is just a shot in the dark...

312
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,299
but, uh, there's no chance that you're,
uh, pre-law, is there?

313
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:33,555
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

314
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:35,598
Nice talking to ya.

315
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:40,184
What the fuck do you want?

316
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,944
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

317
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:45,729
The professor you told
to fuck himself.

318
00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:50,241
Well, what the fuck do you want?

319
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:54,449
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

320
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,615
- Really?
- Yeah.

321
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,745
- But under two conditions.
- What are those?

322
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:07,372
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

323
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:11,043
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on...

324
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:15,756
get into some, some more advanced...

325
00:27:15,891 --> 00:27:18,927
combinatorial mathematics...

326
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,934
finite math.

327
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:24,937
Sounds like a real hoot.

328
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:31,020
And the second condition is that,
that you see a therapist.

329
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:39,193
And I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

330
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:42,328
And if you fail to meet with any
of those conditions...

331
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:44,328
you will have to serve time.

332
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:48,833
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

333
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:52,792
It's better than spending that time
in jail, isn't it?

334
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,639
I read your book, and, uh, and, and
"Mike" was havin' the same problems...

335
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:03,060
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.

336
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,143
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will. Very nice.

337
00:29:06,276 --> 00:29:07,853
Thank you.

338
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:11,188
Will, the pressures,
and I'm not judging them...

339
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:13,991
I'm not, uh, labelling them...

340
00:29:14,116 --> 00:29:17,069
but they are destroying
your potential.

341
00:29:17,202 --> 00:29:22,195
Now no more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

342
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:25,118
You're right.

343
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,124
God, I know.

344
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:31,040
You know, you're not gonna get off
that easily. Come on, Will, a bit more.

345
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:32,879
Well, I mean, I do, I do do things,
you know? I mean...

346
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:35,462
What, uh, what kind of things?

347
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:38,795
I do things that, you know, I, uh... You
know, I mean, I hide from, from people.

348
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:43,720
- You hide, do you?
- No, no. I mean, I like... I, I go places. I interact, you know.

349
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,387
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

350
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,557
More. That's nice, yes.
What sort of clubs?

351
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,687
- Like, um, like Fantasy.
- Fantasy?

352
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:53,688
- It's not bad.
- Bit more.

353
00:29:53,816 --> 00:29:58,228
It's just something like when you get
in there and, the music like owns you.

354
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:00,899
It's like that house music.
It's like...

355
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:08,735
- You know, you start dancin'. It's just...
- Boom, boom, boom. Yes.

356
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:12,746
- Yes.
- Yeah.

357
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,663
Do you find it hard to hide the fact
that you're gay?

358
00:30:16,794 --> 00:30:19,747
What are you... What are you...
What are you talking about? What?

359
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,417
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

360
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:25,751
A jump? Are you...

361
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:28,043
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you.
But...

362
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:30,883
I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

363
00:30:31,014 --> 00:30:34,797
What are you... P-Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

364
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:40,140
A difficult theorem
can be like a symphony.

365
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,311
It's very erotic.

366
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,109
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

367
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:48,437
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

368
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,029
Ah, Henry.

369
00:30:50,155 --> 00:30:53,440
Hi, Gerry. Hey, you know something?
I can't do this pro bono work any more.

370
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:55,448
It's just not... It's not worth it.

371
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:58,149
- What happened?
- Well, I'm going on national television next week.

372
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:02,118
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you,
much less talk to that raving loony in there.

373
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:04,953
An absolute lunatic, he is.

374
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:07,160
Henry.

375
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:10,295
Okay, you are in your bed, Will.

376
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:14,122
Now, how old are you?

377
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,133
Seven.

378
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:19,752
What do you see?

379
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:23,298
Something's in my room.

380
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:26,387
What is it?

381
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,264
Lt's like a, uh... It's a figure.
It's, it's hoverin' over me.

382
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:34,932
You are in a safe place, Will.

383
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:38,650
It's t... It's touching me.

384
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:41,352
Where is it touching you?

385
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,241
Lt's touching me down there.

386
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:47,825
And, uh, I'm nervous.

387
00:31:47,954 --> 00:31:51,654
You don't have to be nervous, Will.

388
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,622
We start dancin' and dancin'.

389
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:59,619
It's just beautiful,
'cause we can make...

390
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:04,168
A lot of love before the sun goes down

391
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:09,091
Skyrockets in flight

392
00:32:09,222 --> 00:32:11,891
Afternoon delight

393
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:15,598
- Hey, hey afternoon delight
- Jesus.

394
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,012
Skyrockets in flight

395
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:22,562
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

396
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,692
Hey, hey afternoon delight

397
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:29,437
Come on, one dance! You, you really
hypnotized me, you know.

398
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,565
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on.

399
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,691
I... He left.
You can't pin that on me.

400
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,447
I told you to cooperate
with these people.

401
00:32:36,578 --> 00:32:39,413
- Look into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

402
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:44,034
- I don't need therapy.
- That's enough! Get out!

403
00:32:45,544 --> 00:32:47,418
I called Mel Weintraub this morning
to see...

404
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:50,036
Oh, what's the use?

405
00:32:50,173 --> 00:32:52,331
What do you want to do?

406
00:32:56,595 --> 00:32:58,753
- Well, there is someone.
- Who is he?

407
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:01,973
He used to be my, um...

408
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,388
my roommate in college.

409
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,644
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

410
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:13,933
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

411
00:33:14,068 --> 00:33:16,737
Why is trust
the most important thing...

412
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,234
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

413
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:25,952
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

414
00:33:26,078 --> 00:33:27,952
Vinnie?

415
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,492
Um, because, uh...

416
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:35,745
Trust is, uh... Trust is life.

417
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:39,460
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

418
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,048
Next time, get the notes
from your brother.

419
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:45,717
You know, if a patient doesn't feel safe enough
to trust you, then he won't be honest with you.

420
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,802
Then there's really no point for them
being in therapy.

421
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,930
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you know,
you're never gonna get them to sleep with you.

422
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:52,931
And that should be the goal
of any good therapist.

423
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:55,135
Nail them while they're vulnerable.
That's my motto.

424
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:59,557
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

425
00:34:01,024 --> 00:34:04,724
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

426
00:34:06,904 --> 00:34:11,613
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

427
00:34:11,742 --> 00:34:15,988
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

428
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,907
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

429
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,791
Lt's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

430
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:25,416
Except they only give it out
once every four years.

431
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:28,462
It's, it's a great thing.
It's an amazing honour.

432
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:30,582
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.
Thanks. Um...

433
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:33,503
We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

434
00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:37,467
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

435
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,347
How are you?

436
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:43,012
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

437
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:44,341
- Sean?
- Yeah?

438
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:47,229
I think I got
something interesting for ya?

439
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:49,810
What? You have to have blood and urine?
What's up?

440
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:55,527
- Why didn't you come to the reunion?
- Time. You know, I'm... I've been busy.

441
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:57,611
- You were missed.
- Really?

442
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:00,858
So, how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

443
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,325
- Before Nancy died.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

444
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:06,860
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

445
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:08,704
I got your card.
It was nice.

446
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:15,877
- Come here.
- Now, that's a good takedown.

447
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:19,871
Hey, uh, what happened?
Did you, uh, get leniency or what?

448
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:24,799
I got, uh, probation and then, uh,
counselling two days a week.

449
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:28,379
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

450
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:32,720
Hey, Bill, just, just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

451
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:34,809
- I've got a full schedule.
- Sean, Sean. - I'm very busy.

452
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:37,891
This, this boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

453
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:41,107
What makes him so incredible, Gerry?

454
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:45,480
- Ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

455
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:50,238
It's a man. He lived over 100 years ago.
He was, uh, Indian.

456
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:53,071
- Dots not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

457
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,242
Well, he lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

458
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:57,612
He had no formal education.

459
00:35:57,748 --> 00:36:00,285
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

460
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,493
- You, sir? - Just
a little. - And, um...

461
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,915
But he came across
this old math book.

462
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:07,715
And from this simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

463
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,749
that had baffled mathematicians
for years.

464
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:12,919
Yes. Continued fractions.
Yeah, he, he wrote, uh...

465
00:36:13,052 --> 00:36:16,919
- Well, he, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah. Cambridge. Yeah.

466
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:20,259
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...

467
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:23,891
and brought him over to England, and
then they worked together for years...

468
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,771
creating some of the most exciting
math theory ever done.

469
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:29,139
Uh, This, this Ramanugan...

470
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:33,319
his, his genius was unparalleled, Sean.

471
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:36,694
Well, this boy's just like that.

472
00:36:36,823 --> 00:36:40,357
But he's, um, he's a bit defensive.

473
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:43,528
And I need someone
who can get through to him.

474
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:46,283
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

475
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:49,118
- Why?
- Well, because you have the same kind of background.

476
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,499
- What background?
- Well, you're from the same neighbourhood.

477
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:55,201
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

478
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,580
Boy genius from Southie.

479
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:03,052
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

480
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,839
- Let me guess. Barry?
- Yeah.

481
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:07,466
- Henry? -
Yeah. - Not Rick?

482
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,634
Sean, please,
just meet with him once a week.

483
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:12,677
Please?

484
00:37:15,772 --> 00:37:18,975
Lt's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

485
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:21,978
He's probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

486
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:24,436
It's gonna be hard for him to find.

487
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:26,065
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

488
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:28,154
This is Sean Maguire. Will Hunting.

489
00:37:28,283 --> 00:37:30,690
How are ya?

490
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,494
- Yeah, let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

491
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:38,662
I'm pumped!
Let's let the healing begin.

492
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:42,290
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

493
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,962
- You, too, Gerry.
- Yeah, of course.

494
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,841
How are you?

495
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:58,345
Where are you from in Southie?

496
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:01,428
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Oh, thanks.

497
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:04,846
Do you buy all these books retail,
or do you send away for like...

498
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,016
a shrink kit that comes
with all these volumes included?

499
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,648
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

500
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:14,315
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

501
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,818
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

502
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:20,732
What about the ones on the top shelf?
You read those?

503
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:24,486
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

504
00:38:24,622 --> 00:38:27,539
Hey, I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

505
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,374
I did. I had to.

506
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:33,284
- It must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

507
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:44,302
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.

508
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:57,098
Jesus.

509
00:38:57,233 --> 00:39:00,518
If you wanna read a real history book, read Howard
Zinn's A People's History of the United States.

510
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:02,526
That book will fuckin' knock you
on your ass.

511
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:04,563
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

512
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:08,397
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

513
00:39:09,535 --> 00:39:11,492
You spend all your money
on these fuckin' fancy books.

514
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,241
You surround yourselves with 'em.
They're the wrong fuckin' books.

515
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:18,239
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?
- Hey, whatever blows your hair back.

516
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:21,080
Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

517
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:25,160
Hey, you know you'd be better off shoving that cigarette
up your ass. It'd probably be healthier for you.

518
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:29,425
- Yeah, I know. It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

519
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:32,256
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

520
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:34,380
- Uh, Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

521
00:39:34,514 --> 00:39:36,091
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
- Free weights, huh?

522
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:38,015
- Yeah, big time. -
Yeah? - Just like that.

523
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,431
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

524
00:39:42,854 --> 00:39:44,930
You paint that?

525
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:48,480
Yeah. You paint? Do you sculpt?

526
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:50,436
- No.
- Do you like art?

527
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,939
Do you like music?

528
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:57,112
This is a real piece of shit.

529
00:39:57,242 --> 00:39:59,115
Oh. Well, tell me
what you really think.

530
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:02,576
Uh, just, uh, the linear
and impressionistic mix...

531
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,946
makes a very muddled composition.

532
00:40:05,082 --> 00:40:08,865
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey, uh, rowin' the boat there.

533
00:40:09,002 --> 00:40:10,875
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

534
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:13,624
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

535
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:16,163
- Just the colouring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

536
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:18,292
Lt's paint-by-number.

537
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:20,881
Is it colour-by-number? Because
the colours are fascinating to me.

538
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:22,589
- Aren't they, really? What about that?
- You bet.

539
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:25,639
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

540
00:40:25,766 --> 00:40:27,841
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

541
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:31,724
Think I should move to the south
of France, change my name to Vincent?

542
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:33,681
You ever heard the sayin',
"any port in a storm"?

543
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:36,731
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Maybe that means you.

544
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:38,234
In what way?

545
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,645
- Uh, maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

546
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:44,780
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

547
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:47,113
The oars are about to snap.

548
00:40:47,242 --> 00:40:48,902
You just piss in you pants.
You're cryin' for the harbour.

549
00:40:49,035 --> 00:40:51,324
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

550
00:40:51,454 --> 00:40:53,779
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

551
00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:57,497
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

552
00:40:59,878 --> 00:41:03,626
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

553
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,707
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

554
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:12,177
Ah.

555
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,431
Mmm, that's it, isn't it?

556
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,802
You married the wrong woman.

557
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:26,684
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

558
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,106
Was she, you know,
banging some other guy?

559
00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:34,611
Lf you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

560
00:41:34,741 --> 00:41:36,780
I will fuckin' end you.

561
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:38,700
Got that, chief?

562
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:44,702
- Time's up.
- Yeah.

563
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,884
At ease, gentlemen.

564
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:07,932
You okay?

565
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:17,098
Look, I'll, I'll understand
if you don't wanna meet with him again.

566
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:20,935
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.

567
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:25,486
Yeah.

568
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:27,526
Thanks.

569
00:43:32,632 --> 00:43:34,754
Well, you look lovely in those glasses.

570
00:43:34,884 --> 00:43:36,627
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

571
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,799
Yes, I always wanted
dark blue eye shadow.

572
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:40,802
Wonderful.

573
00:43:43,432 --> 00:43:46,468
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.

574
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:52,141
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

575
00:43:52,273 --> 00:43:56,484
Then Harvard. Hopefully med school.

576
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,188
You know, I figured out,
at the end...

577
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,112
my brain's gonna be worth $250,000.

578
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,482
That sounded horrible, didn't it?

579
00:44:07,453 --> 00:44:09,326
Bring me another mai tai!

580
00:44:10,455 --> 00:44:13,372
No, that's cool, I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

581
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,627
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

582
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:21,122
Wow. Well, is, uh,
is Harvard gettin' all that money?

583
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:24,126
No. Stanford. I'm going there in June
when I graduate.

584
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:28,469
All right, so you just wanted to, to use
this sailor and then, uh, run away, huh?

585
00:44:28,596 --> 00:44:32,640
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

586
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:34,723
Oh, in that case, that's fine.

587
00:44:34,851 --> 00:44:36,724
Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks,
Skylar?

588
00:44:36,853 --> 00:44:39,308
- Of course.
- All right. Promise...

589
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,431
All right.

590
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:47,267
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait, you need my wand.

591
00:44:47,403 --> 00:44:50,024
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

592
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:52,148
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

593
00:44:52,282 --> 00:44:55,034
You ready? Ready.

594
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,697
One, two, three.

595
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:03,373
They're all gone. Yeah. That, that was...
It works better when I have my rabbit.

596
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,370
Well...

597
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,958
I don't really date, you know,
that much.

598
00:45:09,088 --> 00:45:12,373
How very unfortunate, I think for me.

599
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:17,254
You know what I mean.
I know you've been thinking about uh...

600
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:19,130
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

601
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:22,347
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have! You were hoping to get a good night kiss.

602
00:45:22,474 --> 00:45:26,721
No, you know, I tell ya.
I was hoping to get good-night laid.

603
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:30,304
But I'll settle for like a good kiss,
you know.

604
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:33,890
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

605
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:36,979
No, I was, I was hopin' for a kiss.

606
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:41,571
Well, I think we should just get it
out of the way now.

607
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:45,189
- Right now?
- Yeah.

608
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:47,200
Come on.

609
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,248
I think I got some of your pickle.

610
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:11,513
You again, huh?

611
00:46:12,892 --> 00:46:14,386
Come with me.

612
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:26,726
So what's this? A Taster's Choice
moment between guys?

613
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:30,112
This is really nice.
You got a thing for swans?

614
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,774
Ls this like a fetish? Ls it something
like maybe we need to devote some time to?

615
00:46:35,578 --> 00:46:39,789
I thought about what you said to me
the other day. About my painting.

616
00:46:39,915 --> 00:46:41,113
Oh.

617
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:43,870
Stayed up half the night
thinkin' about it.

618
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:47,417
Something occurred to me.

619
00:46:47,546 --> 00:46:52,006
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.

620
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:55,087
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

621
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:59,347
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

622
00:46:59,473 --> 00:47:02,972
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

623
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:05,426
You've never been out of Boston.

624
00:47:07,688 --> 00:47:09,312
Nope.

625
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,433
So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give
me the skinny on every art book ever written.

626
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:18,436
Michelangelo.
You know a lot about him.

627
00:47:18,572 --> 00:47:21,941
Life's work. Political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

628
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:26,535
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

629
00:47:26,662 --> 00:47:30,909
I bet you can't tell me what
it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

630
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:37,170
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

631
00:47:39,965 --> 00:47:42,503
Seen that.

632
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:44,508
If I ask you about women...

633
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:48,218
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites.

634
00:47:48,347 --> 00:47:50,838
You may have even been laid
a few times.

635
00:47:56,646 --> 00:47:59,812
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

636
00:47:59,941 --> 00:48:02,265
and feel truly happy.

637
00:48:05,487 --> 00:48:07,360
You're a tough kid.

638
00:48:09,157 --> 00:48:12,739
I ask you about war, you'd probably, uh,
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

639
00:48:12,868 --> 00:48:16,153
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends. "

640
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:20,784
But you've never been near one.

641
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:23,668
You've never held
your best friend's head in your lap...

642
00:48:23,794 --> 00:48:27,791
and watch him gasp his last breath
lookin' to you for help.

643
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:33,542
I ask you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet...

644
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:39,555
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

645
00:48:39,682 --> 00:48:43,762
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

646
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:48,390
Feelin' like God put an angel on Earth
just for you...

647
00:48:48,523 --> 00:48:51,228
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

648
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,644
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel...

649
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:57,814
to have that love for her
be there forever.

650
00:48:57,948 --> 00:49:02,408
Through anything. Through cancer.

651
00:49:02,535 --> 00:49:06,579
And you wouldn't know about sleepin' sittin' up in
a hospital room for two months holding her hand...

652
00:49:06,705 --> 00:49:08,614
because the doctors could see
in your eyes...

653
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:11,868
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

654
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:15,792
You don't know about real loss...

655
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:19,586
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

656
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:24,424
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

657
00:49:27,348 --> 00:49:32,341
I look at you, I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.

658
00:49:34,562 --> 00:49:37,931
I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.

659
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:42,983
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

660
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:46,693
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

661
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:49,776
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.

662
00:49:49,908 --> 00:49:52,577
You ripped my fuckin' life apart.

663
00:49:56,581 --> 00:49:58,537
You're an orphan, right?

664
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:06,543
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been...

665
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:09,245
how you feel, who you are...

666
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:12,668
because I read Oliver Twist?

667
00:50:12,803 --> 00:50:15,210
Does that encapsulate you?

668
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:19,969
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that.

669
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,260
Because you know what? I can't learn anything
from you I can't read in some fuckin' book.

670
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:31,061
Unless you want to talk about you,
who you are.

671
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:36,613
Then I'm fascinated.
I'm in.

672
00:50:38,574 --> 00:50:41,326
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

673
00:50:43,954 --> 00:50:45,827
You're terrified
of what you might say.

674
00:50:51,919 --> 00:50:53,911
Your move, chief.

675
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:03,677
Hello? Hello?

676
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:06,641
Hello?

677
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:09,600
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

678
00:52:13,404 --> 00:52:14,435
Freak.

679
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:19,200
Oh. Oh, God.

680
00:52:19,326 --> 00:52:22,529
- Christ, who did you call?
- No one. I forgot the number.

681
00:52:22,662 --> 00:52:26,113
You fuckin' retarded? You went all the way out
there in the rain, and you didn't bring the number?

682
00:52:26,249 --> 00:52:29,415
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

683
00:52:29,543 --> 00:52:32,746
Why don't we get off of mothers?
I just got off of yours.

684
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:37,498
That's pretty funny, Morgan.
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch!

685
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:39,875
- Keep antagonizing me, watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

686
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,801
- Watch what happens. - All right,
then, Morgan! - Watch what happens.

687
00:52:41,928 --> 00:52:43,968
- What are you gonna fuckin' do to me?
- Keep fuckin' with me.

688
00:52:50,102 --> 00:52:51,975
No smoking.

689
00:53:23,922 --> 00:53:26,377
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

690
00:53:26,508 --> 00:53:29,710
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

691
00:53:29,844 --> 00:53:32,548
- It's pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

692
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,629
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

693
00:53:36,766 --> 00:53:40,633
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighbourhood?

694
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:44,719
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.

695
00:53:44,857 --> 00:53:48,723
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

696
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:52,904
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

697
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,944
- But I can do the sum.
- Well, it's how you group the terms, Alexander.

698
00:53:57,075 --> 00:53:59,992
But, Gerry, if we do the whole thing
this way, then...

699
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:02,824
Hey, look, look.

700
00:54:02,955 --> 00:54:05,956
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.

701
00:54:16,884 --> 00:54:19,801
Sometimes people get lucky.

702
00:54:19,928 --> 00:54:21,837
You're a brilliant man.

703
00:54:59,169 --> 00:55:01,707
You know, I was on this plane once.

704
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:04,411
And I'm sittin' there, and, uh...

705
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:08,131
the captain gets on, he does his whole, you
know, "We'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet. "

706
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,299
But then he puts the mike down,
he forgets to turn it off.

707
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:14,223
And so he turns to the copilot.
He's like, "You know...

708
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:18,677
all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee. "

709
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:22,808
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin' up from the
back of the plane to tell him the microphone's still on.

710
00:55:22,939 --> 00:55:25,644
This buy in the back of the plane's like,
"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee. "

711
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,192
You ever been on a plane?

712
00:55:30,321 --> 00:55:33,274
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

713
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:35,280
Yeah, it does.

714
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:40,361
I have been laid, you know.

715
00:55:40,496 --> 00:55:42,986
Really? Goody for you.

716
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:44,700
- Big time. Big time.
- Big time, huh?

717
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,917
Yeah. I went on a date last week.

718
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,961
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

719
00:55:51,088 --> 00:55:52,831
- You goin' out again?
- I don't know.

720
00:55:52,965 --> 00:55:54,756
- Why not?
- Haven't called her.

721
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:58,133
- Christ, you're an amateur. -
I know what I'm doin'. - Really?

722
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:02,424
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

723
00:56:02,556 --> 00:56:04,844
Yeah, but this girl is like,
you know, beautiful.

724
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:09,470
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

725
00:56:09,604 --> 00:56:11,430
So call her up, Romeo.

726
00:56:11,564 --> 00:56:13,355
Why? So I can realize
she's not that smart?

727
00:56:13,482 --> 00:56:15,723
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't...

728
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:19,310
This girl is like fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna r-ruin that.

729
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:23,321
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

730
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:26,989
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.

731
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:31,365
That way you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

732
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:37,499
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

733
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,952
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

734
00:56:40,088 --> 00:56:43,290
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.

735
00:56:44,258 --> 00:56:46,215
Sorry I shared that with you.

736
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:49,842
And one night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

737
00:56:52,765 --> 00:56:54,473
She woke up and gone like,
"Was that you?"

738
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,553
I said, "Yeah. " I didn't have the heart
to tell her. Oh, God.

739
00:56:57,686 --> 00:57:00,177
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

740
00:57:05,317 --> 00:57:10,524
Oh, Christ. Ah, but, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.

741
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,360
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

742
00:57:13,491 --> 00:57:17,820
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

743
00:57:17,953 --> 00:57:21,119
The little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

744
00:57:21,247 --> 00:57:23,572
That's what made her my wife.

745
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:26,911
Boy, and she had the goods on me, too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

746
00:57:27,836 --> 00:57:31,419
People call these things imperfections,
but they're not.

747
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:34,038
Oh, that's the good stuff.

748
00:57:34,175 --> 00:57:37,674
And then we get to choose who we let
into our weird little worlds.

749
00:57:39,638 --> 00:57:41,630
You're not perfect, sport.

750
00:57:41,765 --> 00:57:43,804
And let me save you the suspense.

751
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:46,934
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

752
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:50,809
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

753
00:57:50,939 --> 00:57:54,308
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

754
00:57:55,443 --> 00:57:56,937
Now, you can know everything
in the world, sport...

755
00:57:57,069 --> 00:58:00,438
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

756
00:58:00,572 --> 00:58:03,277
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

757
00:58:03,408 --> 00:58:07,785
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

758
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:12,869
Yeah, why not? You told me
every other fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

759
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:15,407
You fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.

760
00:58:15,543 --> 00:58:19,623
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

761
00:58:19,755 --> 00:58:21,664
Yeah.

762
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:30,251
- You ever think about gettin' remarried?
- My wife's dead.

763
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:33,508
- Hence the word "remarried. "
- She's dead!

764
00:58:36,436 --> 00:58:39,306
Yeah. Well, I think that's
a super philosophy, Sean.

765
00:58:39,438 --> 00:58:41,478
I mean, that way you can actually
go through the rest of your life...

766
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:43,398
without ever really knowing anybody.

767
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:48,016
Time's up.

768
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:05,160
Hold it open.

769
00:59:05,294 --> 00:59:07,286
- Okay.
- Thank you.

770
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:23,100
I am happy with you

771
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:28,265
I know I'm about to love you

772
00:59:28,396 --> 00:59:33,734
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know him

773
00:59:33,859 --> 00:59:36,813
Oh, my, you made me...

774
00:59:36,945 --> 00:59:39,317
"G" minor seventh.
Saddest of all chords.

775
00:59:41,741 --> 00:59:43,532
- Hello.
- Hey.

776
00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:46,494
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I've been like...

777
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:49,241
I've been really busy, and...
But, um...

778
00:59:49,372 --> 00:59:51,945
Me, too. Yeah.

779
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:54,870
I... I thought you'd call.

780
00:59:56,587 --> 00:59:58,413
Yeah. Um...

781
00:59:58,547 --> 01:00:00,504
- I mean, we had a really good time.
- I had a really good time, too.

782
01:00:00,632 --> 01:00:02,671
I mean, I just... I...

783
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,709
I'm sorry, you know.
I, I blew it.

784
01:00:04,844 --> 01:00:07,169
No, no. I mean, you know,
it's all right.

785
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:12,428
Yeah. Uh, so I was, I was wonderin' if, uh,
if, you know, you'd give me another crack at it.

786
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,223
- You know, let me take you out again.
- Oh, I can't.

787
01:00:17,438 --> 01:00:19,347
- All right.
- Oh, no. I didn't...

788
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:23,313
I didn't mean I can't, like ever.
I just can't right now.

789
01:00:23,443 --> 01:00:26,396
I've got to assign the proton spectrum
for "ebogamine. "

790
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:28,438
All that sounds really, really
interesting.

791
01:00:28,572 --> 01:00:30,446
It's actually fantastically boring.

792
01:00:30,574 --> 01:00:33,278
- All right, um...
- But, um, maybe some other time.

793
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:36,778
- Like tomorrow?
- Um, yeah, all right.

794
01:00:36,913 --> 01:00:39,201
- Okay.
- Okay.

795
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:41,205
- Bye.
- Bye.

796
01:00:56,262 --> 01:00:59,049
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

797
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:04,223
- Where the fuck did you get this?
- I had to sleep with someone in your class.

798
01:01:04,352 --> 01:01:08,017
Oh, I hope it was someone with the
open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.

799
01:01:10,107 --> 01:01:13,974
- Come on, let's go have some fun.
- No, I... I've got to learn this.

800
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,648
Well, you're not goin' to his surgery
tomorrow, are you?

801
01:01:16,779 --> 01:01:18,772
- No.
- Let's go.

802
01:01:22,868 --> 01:01:26,319
Oh, my God. My dog is winning!

803
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:28,741
Come on, Misty!

804
01:01:28,873 --> 01:01:31,494
Come on, run! Look at that!
Come on!

805
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,499
Look, there he goes.
Misty, run! Come on!

806
01:01:34,503 --> 01:01:38,500
- And Misty flying down the track.
- We won.

807
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:40,540
I totally won!

808
01:01:42,593 --> 01:01:46,507
- So did you grow up around here, then?
- Not far. South Boston.

809
01:01:49,224 --> 01:01:51,465
- Still glowing from my win.
- Yeah, I know. Look at you.

810
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:53,474
You're so happy.

811
01:01:55,646 --> 01:02:00,603
- What was that like then?
- It was, you know, normal I guess. Nothin' special.

812
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,024
Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?

813
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:06,774
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

814
01:02:06,905 --> 01:02:08,944
Well, Irish Catholic,
what do you think?

815
01:02:09,074 --> 01:02:11,481
Right. That's right.

816
01:02:12,952 --> 01:02:16,700
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

817
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:21,451
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

818
01:02:21,584 --> 01:02:24,787
Seven? Eight? How many?

819
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,043
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not have 12 brothers.

820
01:02:27,172 --> 01:02:29,959
I swear to God, I swear to God.
I'm lucky 13 right here.

821
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:32,961
Do you know all their names?

822
01:02:33,094 --> 01:02:35,798
- Do I... Yeah, they're my brothers.
- What are they called?

823
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:41,218
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

824
01:02:41,351 --> 01:02:43,427
Say it again.

825
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:47,890
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

826
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:51,233
- And Willy.
- Willy?

827
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,734
- Yeah.
- Will.

828
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:55,896
Wow! Do you still see all of them?

829
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:58,817
Yeah, well, they all live in Southie. I'm,
I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.

830
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:00,064
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

831
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,067
- Well, I'd like to meet them.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

832
01:03:05,163 --> 01:03:06,573
Oh, you know, I read your book
last night.

833
01:03:06,706 --> 01:03:09,327
Oh, so you're the one.

834
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,367
Do you still, uh, do you still
counsel veterans?

835
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:12,699
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

836
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:14,911
Well, I gave it up
when my wife got sick.

837
01:03:17,631 --> 01:03:20,751
You ever wonder what your life
would be like if you, uh...

838
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:23,256
if you never met your wife?

839
01:03:23,386 --> 01:03:25,842
- What, wonder if I'd be better off without her?
- No, no, no.

840
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:28,593
- I'm not saying like better off. I didn't mean it like that.
- No, it's all right.

841
01:03:28,724 --> 01:03:31,262
It's an important question.

842
01:03:31,393 --> 01:03:33,718
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

843
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:36,012
to the good stuff
you weren't paying attention to.

844
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:38,688
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

845
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:41,437
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

846
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:45,897
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

847
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:54,120
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

848
01:03:54,246 --> 01:03:56,915
October 21, 1975.

849
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,032
Jesus Christ, you know the fuckin' day?

850
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:04,124
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the
World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.

851
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:05,452
Yeah, sure.

852
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:09,289
My friends and I had, you know, slept out
on the sidewalk all night to get tickets.

853
01:04:09,425 --> 01:04:12,876
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar...

854
01:04:13,012 --> 01:04:16,462
waitin' for the game to start,
and in walks this girl.

855
01:04:16,598 --> 01:04:19,433
It was an amazing game, though. You
know, bottom of the 8th, Carbo ties it up.

856
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:22,096
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.

857
01:04:22,228 --> 01:04:26,972
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped Carlton
Fisk, old Pudge. Steps up to the plate.

858
01:04:27,107 --> 01:04:28,814
- You know, he's got that weird stance.
- Yeah, yeah.

859
01:04:28,942 --> 01:04:31,812
And then, boom!
He clocks it, you know. High!

860
01:04:31,944 --> 01:04:34,351
Fly ball down the left field line!

861
01:04:34,488 --> 01:04:37,405
35,000 people on their feet
yellin' at the ball.

862
01:04:37,532 --> 01:04:39,904
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

863
01:04:40,034 --> 01:04:41,777
- You know, "Get over! Get over!"
- Yeah, I've seen that. Right. Right.

864
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:45,114
"Get over!" And then it hits
the foul pole.

865
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:49,908
Well, he goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans,
you know, they charge the field. You know?

866
01:04:50,043 --> 01:04:52,331
- Yeah, and he's fuckin' blowin' people outta the way.
- And he's goin', goin', "Look out!

867
01:04:52,461 --> 01:04:54,501
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!"

868
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:57,749
I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets to
that fuckin' game! Did you rush the field?

869
01:04:57,883 --> 01:05:00,883
No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field.
I wasn't there.

870
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:04,011
- What?
- No, I was in a bar having a drink with my future wife.

871
01:05:04,138 --> 01:05:06,095
- You missed Pudge Fisk's home run?
- Oh, yeah.

872
01:05:06,223 --> 01:05:08,511
To have a fuckin' drink with some lady
you never met?

873
01:05:08,642 --> 01:05:10,848
Yeah, but you should've seen her.
She was a stunner.

874
01:05:10,977 --> 01:05:13,515
- I don't care if fuckin'...
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

875
01:05:13,646 --> 01:05:16,600
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room! That's game six!
- Oh, Helen of Troy.

876
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:19,768
Oh, my God. And who are these fuckin' friends
of yours? They let you get away with that?

877
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:22,522
- Oh, they had to. - What do you mean,
they had? W- What did you say to 'em?

878
01:05:22,654 --> 01:05:25,025
I just slid my ticket across the table
and I said...

879
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:28,489
"Sorry, guys. I gotta see about a girl. "

880
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:30,775
"I gotta go see about a girl"?
Yeah, that's what you said?

881
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:32,321
- I had to.
- And they let you get away with that?

882
01:05:32,454 --> 01:05:35,158
Oh, yeah. They saw it in my eyes
that I meant it.

883
01:05:35,289 --> 01:05:38,373
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

884
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,038
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

885
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:44,253
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.

886
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,871
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

887
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:49,878
I don't regret the six years I had to
give up counselling when she got sick.

888
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:52,797
And I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

889
01:05:54,347 --> 01:05:57,597
And I sure as hell don't regret
missin' a damn game.

890
01:05:57,725 --> 01:05:59,302
That's regret.

891
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:01,308
Wow!

892
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:09,315
Would've been nice
to catch that game, though.

893
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:11,768
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

894
01:06:14,864 --> 01:06:19,407
You know, I'm very, very useful
on the court. I'm extremely tall.

895
01:06:21,453 --> 01:06:24,158
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

896
01:06:26,874 --> 01:06:30,243
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

897
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:33,544
"Lt is decidedly so. " Hmph.

898
01:06:36,382 --> 01:06:39,418
Why do we always stay here?

899
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:41,628
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

900
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:44,169
Yes, but I've never seen your place.

901
01:06:44,306 --> 01:06:46,464
I know.

902
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:49,090
When am I gonna meet your friends
and your brothers?

903
01:06:49,227 --> 01:06:52,560
Oh. Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

904
01:06:52,688 --> 01:06:54,846
Well, I think I can make it
to South Boston.

905
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:58,771
It's kind of a hike.

906
01:06:58,901 --> 01:07:02,601
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

907
01:07:02,738 --> 01:07:05,738
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

908
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:08,617
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.

909
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:13,285
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

910
01:07:18,752 --> 01:07:22,452
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

911
01:07:22,588 --> 01:07:25,957
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.

912
01:07:26,091 --> 01:07:29,175
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

913
01:07:29,302 --> 01:07:33,548
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get like an advance payment?

914
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:35,638
I don't know. Let's ask.

915
01:07:37,017 --> 01:07:39,258
- "Outlook does not look good. "
- What?

916
01:07:39,394 --> 01:07:41,967
Fuck the... Hey, Chuck. No, nothing.
Go back to sleep.

917
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:45,188
"Outlook does not... " That's the same thing that told
you you was gonna play in the N.B.A. I think I'm in.

918
01:07:45,316 --> 01:07:48,352
Well, exactly, so look out. You better
start buying some season tickets.

919
01:07:51,112 --> 01:07:54,730
I- I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

920
01:07:54,865 --> 01:07:56,656
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

921
01:07:56,784 --> 01:07:59,488
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

922
01:07:59,619 --> 01:08:01,777
Maybe I'm all about three points.

923
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,704
I'm all about home runs.

924
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:09,493
Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.

925
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:24,178
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

926
01:08:24,307 --> 01:08:27,971
And Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind... "

927
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,185
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

928
01:08:34,315 --> 01:08:36,355
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.

929
01:08:36,484 --> 01:08:40,481
You know, my Uncle Marty drinks. You know.
He'll go on a bender for six, eight months.

930
01:08:40,612 --> 01:08:43,150
I ever tell you what happened to him when he
was drivin' up there and he got pulled over?

931
01:08:43,281 --> 01:08:45,024
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, Marty, yeah.

932
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:46,901
Let me tell you about... Let me tell ya
what happened to my Uncle Marty...

933
01:08:47,034 --> 01:08:49,276
because you oughta know this.

934
01:08:49,411 --> 01:08:52,827
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here, he's got another story.

935
01:08:52,956 --> 01:08:56,787
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead, just say it anyway. Go ahead.

936
01:08:56,918 --> 01:09:00,701
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

937
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:04,835
Um, yeah, my Uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

938
01:09:04,966 --> 01:09:09,711
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked!

939
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,336
This state trooper, uh, sees him
and pulls him over.

940
01:09:12,472 --> 01:09:15,390
So my uncle's fucked, basically. Got him out
of the car, and tried to make him walk the line.

941
01:09:15,517 --> 01:09:20,143
He gets out of the car, you know, pukes and the
guy statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

942
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:23,888
So, he's about to throw the cuffs on him
and put him in jail.

943
01:09:24,024 --> 01:09:28,068
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road
there's this huge fuckin' boom, right?

944
01:09:28,194 --> 01:09:31,728
- So statie gets real spooked, and he turns around...
- He got shot?

945
01:09:31,864 --> 01:09:33,524
- No, no.
- So, so...

946
01:09:33,657 --> 01:09:36,574
- You've heard this story before.
- Yeah, Morgan, stop it. Stop it.

947
01:09:36,701 --> 01:09:40,152
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
Okay? There was an accident.

948
01:09:41,872 --> 01:09:44,742
- Anyway... Shut the fuck up!
- How could he hear the other car accident if it wasn't right behind him?

949
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:47,412
- I'm gonna break your neck. - You're driving
him nuts, Morgan. - Shut up! Okay, shut up.

950
01:09:47,544 --> 01:09:49,251
- Sorry.
- He told you the story once before. Go ahead.

951
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:51,786
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move. "

952
01:09:51,922 --> 01:09:56,085
So statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.

953
01:09:56,218 --> 01:09:59,800
After a few minutes of, of just lyin'
in his own piss and vomit...

954
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,254
my uncle st-starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

955
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:04,714
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

956
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:07,767
Well, the next mornin',
my uncle's just passed out...

957
01:10:07,894 --> 01:10:09,933
and he hears this knocking at the door.

958
01:10:10,063 --> 01:10:13,147
So he goes downstairs,
fuckin' pulls the door open. "What?"

959
01:10:13,274 --> 01:10:15,266
Lt's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

960
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:18,022
Statie says, "Fuck you mean, 'What? '
You know what.

961
01:10:18,153 --> 01:10:20,940
I pulled you over last night is what,
and you fuckin' took off. "

962
01:10:21,072 --> 01:10:23,360
He's like, "Bet you I never seen you
before in my life.

963
01:10:23,491 --> 01:10:26,361
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are. "

964
01:10:26,493 --> 01:10:29,696
He said, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage. "

965
01:10:29,829 --> 01:10:32,118
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let met get in your garage. "

966
01:10:32,248 --> 01:10:34,917
My uncle's like, "All right, fine. " Takes
him 'round to the garage, opens the door.

967
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:40,118
And there's... The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

968
01:10:41,589 --> 01:10:45,254
He was so fuckin'... He was so fuckin'
hammered, he drove the wrong car home.

969
01:10:45,384 --> 01:10:48,966
And the best part about it is
the fuckin' state trooper...

970
01:10:49,096 --> 01:10:51,551
had been so embarrassed,
he didn't do anything...

971
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:55,050
'cause he'd been drivin' around all night
in my uncle's Chevelle lookin' for the house.

972
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:59,098
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

973
01:10:59,229 --> 01:11:01,138
Well, he goes away.
That's the point.

974
01:11:01,273 --> 01:11:04,641
- All right. Well, question. Are you...
- Come on, stop.

975
01:11:04,776 --> 01:11:07,147
I'm tryin' to clarify somethin', probably
'cause you're too embarrassed to ask...

976
01:11:07,278 --> 01:11:09,151
'cause you know
it doesn't make any sense.

977
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:12,114
It does make sense if you listen
to the story and quit askin' questions.

978
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,490
Morgan, let's see if you can get this
one. I've got a little story for ya.

979
01:11:15,618 --> 01:11:21,074
All right. There's an old couple
in bed. Mary and Paddie.

980
01:11:21,206 --> 01:11:25,998
And they wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

981
01:11:26,127 --> 01:11:28,499
And Mary looks over
and gazes adoringly at Paddie.

982
01:11:28,629 --> 01:11:33,623
She's like, "Oh, Jesus, Paddie. You're
such a good-lookin' fella. I love ya.

983
01:11:33,758 --> 01:11:35,916
I want to give ya
a little present.

984
01:11:36,052 --> 01:11:39,088
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

985
01:11:39,221 --> 01:11:41,095
What would you like?"

986
01:11:41,223 --> 01:11:45,683
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

987
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:50,721
Now, in 50 years,
there's one thing that's been missin'...

988
01:11:50,856 --> 01:11:55,517
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

989
01:11:55,652 --> 01:11:58,439
I would like for it. "
And Mary's like, "All right. "

990
01:11:58,571 --> 01:12:02,900
She takes her teeth out, puts them in
the glass, and she gives him a blow job.

991
01:12:03,033 --> 01:12:06,864
And afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah,
geez, now that's what I've been missin'.

992
01:12:06,995 --> 01:12:10,862
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

993
01:12:10,998 --> 01:12:13,074
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

994
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:16,292
Ls there anything
that I can do for you?"

995
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:21,045
And Mary looks up to him
and she goes, "Give us a kiss. "

996
01:12:21,173 --> 01:12:24,423
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

997
01:12:24,551 --> 01:12:26,876
- That's filthy.
- Not that filthy. I've heard filthier.

998
01:12:31,349 --> 01:12:33,555
Get off of me! Lt's this fuckin'...

999
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:36,684
- All right, see you guys later.
- All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1000
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,061
So, Skylar, thanks for comin' by.

1001
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,147
Changed my opinion of Harvard people.

1002
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:46,442
Ah, well, you don't want to rush the judgment on
that one 'cause, you know, they're not all like me.

1003
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,321
Oh, well, I'm sure.
But it was nice to meet ya.

1004
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:52,151
- Take it easy.
- Oh, all right.

1005
01:12:52,283 --> 01:12:54,821
- Slowly back away.
- Oh, come on. Hey. Brother.

1006
01:12:54,952 --> 01:12:58,155
I don't know what you're doin', dude.
You're givin' us a ride.

1007
01:12:58,288 --> 01:13:00,446
- What the fuck do I look like to you?
- Come on, Chuck.

1008
01:13:00,582 --> 01:13:02,657
Else you're walkin', bitch.
WilI's takin' the car.

1009
01:13:03,876 --> 01:13:05,915
All right. Thanks, Chuck.
I appreciate it.

1010
01:13:06,045 --> 01:13:08,831
Wait, wait. I don't know what
you're gettin' all serious about.

1011
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:10,837
You're droppin' me off first.

1012
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:13,456
- Dude, it's really out of the way.
- Oh, okay.

1013
01:13:13,593 --> 01:13:15,881
- It's real far. - Just 'cause you have
to sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1014
01:13:16,011 --> 01:13:17,671
- don't start thinkin' you're bad.
- All right, come on.

1015
01:13:17,804 --> 01:13:20,046
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1016
01:13:20,181 --> 01:13:23,099
- No, not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night, hon.

1017
01:13:23,226 --> 01:13:27,009
He knows once you see that little shit-hole,
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1018
01:13:27,146 --> 01:13:29,185
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

1019
01:13:29,314 --> 01:13:31,603
No. We're gonna do that another time.

1020
01:13:31,733 --> 01:13:33,606
All right.

1021
01:13:35,486 --> 01:13:37,893
Need them keys.

1022
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:41,944
The stewardess hears this and
goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1023
01:13:42,075 --> 01:13:45,360
And I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee. "

1024
01:13:45,495 --> 01:13:48,199
No shit!
You didn't say that.

1025
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:50,323
- For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.
- Yeah.

1026
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:52,580
- I know someone that it actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke?

1027
01:13:52,709 --> 01:13:55,793
- Gerry. Have trouble findin' the place?
- Hi. No, I took a cab.

1028
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,751
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1029
01:13:59,882 --> 01:14:02,668
- How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.
- Pleased to meet ya.

1030
01:14:02,801 --> 01:14:06,501
- Can I get you a beer?
- Uh, no, just a Perrier.

1031
01:14:06,637 --> 01:14:08,464
That's French for club soda.

1032
01:14:08,597 --> 01:14:11,847
- Huh. Club soda, yeah.
- Yeah. A couple of sandwiches, too.

1033
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:13,303
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1034
01:14:13,435 --> 01:14:15,593
You ever plan on payin' your tab?

1035
01:14:15,728 --> 01:14:17,970
Yeah, chief. Got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1036
01:14:18,105 --> 01:14:19,647
- What's the jackpot?
- $12 million.

1037
01:14:19,773 --> 01:14:24,482
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- Yeah, but it'll cover your sex change operation.

1038
01:14:27,738 --> 01:14:30,110
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1039
01:14:34,286 --> 01:14:37,156
So, you wanted to talk about Will.

1040
01:14:37,288 --> 01:14:39,826
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1041
01:14:42,793 --> 01:14:45,497
Have you talked to him at all
about his future?

1042
01:14:45,629 --> 01:14:49,163
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1043
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:52,833
Well, maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

1044
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:56,799
- What kind?
- Well, cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1045
01:14:56,930 --> 01:15:00,263
The kind of place where a mind
like WilI's is given free rein.

1046
01:15:00,391 --> 01:15:02,929
That's, that's great
that there are offers...

1047
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,017
but I, I don't really think
he's ready for that.

1048
01:15:09,774 --> 01:15:11,897
I'm not sure you understand, Sean.

1049
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:16,023
- Well, what don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1050
01:15:16,154 --> 01:15:18,028
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1051
01:15:18,156 --> 01:15:22,153
Just so you don't get
sticky fingers, huh?

1052
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:25,487
Tim, can you help us?
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

1053
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:26,901
Uh-oh.

1054
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:30,454
- You ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1055
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:33,204
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1056
01:15:35,504 --> 01:15:38,707
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1057
01:15:40,008 --> 01:15:42,498
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1058
01:15:42,635 --> 01:15:44,508
- So, who won the bet?
- I did.

1059
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:49,888
This isn't about me, Sean. I'm...

1060
01:15:51,809 --> 01:15:53,885
I'm nothing compared to this young man.

1061
01:15:57,481 --> 01:15:59,354
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1062
01:15:59,483 --> 01:16:02,483
In 1905 there were hundreds
of professors renown...

1063
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:05,397
for their study of the universe,
but it was a...

1064
01:16:05,529 --> 01:16:08,696
It was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk...

1065
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:11,397
doing physics in his spare time
who changed the world.

1066
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:13,408
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1067
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:15,991
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night?

1068
01:16:16,122 --> 01:16:20,747
We all would've lost something.
Tim would never have heard of him.

1069
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,911
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1070
01:16:24,045 --> 01:16:26,582
This boy has that gift.

1071
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:29,169
He just hasn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1072
01:16:29,299 --> 01:16:31,920
Hey, Gerry,
in the 1960s...

1073
01:16:32,052 --> 01:16:34,542
there was a young man graduated
from the University of Michigan.

1074
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,882
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

1075
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,257
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

1076
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:42,431
Then he went on to Berkeley.
He was assistant professor.

1077
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:46,510
Showed amazing potential. Then he moved to
Montana and he blew the competition away.

1078
01:16:46,647 --> 01:16:49,517
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1079
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:51,441
Haven't heard of him.

1080
01:16:51,568 --> 01:16:52,979
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1081
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:56,277
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1082
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:02,902
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
We gotta give this kid direction.

1083
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:05,741
He can contribute to the world, and,
and we can help him do that.

1084
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:08,576
- Direction's one thing. Manipulation's another, all right?
- Sean!

1085
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:12,041
- We have to let him find...
- Sean, I'm not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache...

1086
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:15,086
and hatching a, hatching a plan
to ruin this boy's life.

1087
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:18,130
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was, when I was 18...

1088
01:17:18,257 --> 01:17:21,127
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1089
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,133
Well, maybe he doesn't want
what you want.

1090
01:17:23,262 --> 01:17:25,966
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1091
01:17:26,097 --> 01:17:29,929
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1092
01:17:30,059 --> 01:17:32,217
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Gerry.
Let's talk about the boy.

1093
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:35,306
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1094
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:38,641
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1095
01:17:38,775 --> 01:17:41,312
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick.

1096
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:46,147
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I came here today.

1097
01:17:46,281 --> 01:17:48,404
I came here out of courtesy.
I- I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1098
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:50,609
Oh, nice to be in the loop.

1099
01:17:50,743 --> 01:17:54,277
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1100
01:17:54,413 --> 01:17:58,410
Well, Will, uh, I'm not
exactly sure what you mean.

1101
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:00,415
We've already offered you
a position.

1102
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:02,831
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1103
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:06,413
You think you can find somebody who does,
let me tell you, you have my blessin'.

1104
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:09,714
But I think we all know that person's
not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1105
01:18:09,843 --> 01:18:12,962
Will, our offer
i- is $84,000 a year plus...

1106
01:18:13,095 --> 01:18:18,006
Retainer
Retainer.

1107
01:18:18,141 --> 01:18:20,762
You want us to give you cash
right now?

1108
01:18:20,894 --> 01:18:24,938
Whoa-ho-ho. Go easy.
Now, I didn't say that.

1109
01:18:25,064 --> 01:18:30,188
Allegedly, your situation, for you...

1110
01:18:30,318 --> 01:18:32,524
would be concurrently improved...

1111
01:18:32,653 --> 01:18:36,401
if I had $200
in my back pocket right now.

1112
01:18:37,824 --> 01:18:41,987
Well, I don't think I-I can, uh, uh...
Larry?

1113
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,283
- I've got $73.
- Uh, will you take a cheque?

1114
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:51,036
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

1115
01:18:51,169 --> 01:18:53,327
Yeah, you.

1116
01:18:53,463 --> 01:18:57,626
I don't know what your reputation is
in this town...

1117
01:18:57,758 --> 01:19:02,004
but after the shit you tried to pull
today, you can bet I'll be lookin' into you.

1118
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:07,047
Now, any business
we have heretofore...

1119
01:19:07,183 --> 01:19:09,720
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1120
01:19:10,977 --> 01:19:14,891
Good day, gentlemen.
And until that day comes...

1121
01:19:15,023 --> 01:19:16,896
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1122
01:19:31,161 --> 01:19:33,070
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1123
01:19:33,205 --> 01:19:35,280
Yeah.

1124
01:19:35,415 --> 01:19:38,249
Good.

1125
01:19:38,376 --> 01:19:41,411
- You want some help?
- No.

1126
01:19:41,545 --> 01:19:44,249
- Come on. Give me one little peek, we'll go to the batting cages.
- No.

1127
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:50,167
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1128
01:19:50,302 --> 01:19:54,086
- It's really important to me. Okay?
- All right. All right.

1129
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:59,094
- So, why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1130
01:20:01,478 --> 01:20:05,061
All right, Mr Nosey Parker.

1131
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:09,566
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls...

1132
01:20:09,694 --> 01:20:11,567
let me ask you a question.

1133
01:20:11,695 --> 01:20:13,771
All right.

1134
01:20:13,906 --> 01:20:17,737
Do you have a photographic memory?

1135
01:20:17,867 --> 01:20:19,741
I don't know.
I just kinda remember, you know?

1136
01:20:19,869 --> 01:20:23,368
I mean, how do you remember your
phone number? You know? You just do.

1137
01:20:23,497 --> 01:20:26,450
- Well, have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1138
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:29,287
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1139
01:20:29,419 --> 01:20:32,205
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1140
01:20:32,338 --> 01:20:34,875
Are you mad?

1141
01:20:35,007 --> 01:20:39,134
Have you completely lost your mind?
Nobody studies it for fun.

1142
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:42,296
It's not a, a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

1143
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,671
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1144
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:48,934
Someone who divides their time fairly
evenly between batting cages and bars.

1145
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,969
I mean, I would hardly say
it was a necessity.

1146
01:20:51,104 --> 01:20:52,479
Oh.

1147
01:20:53,856 --> 01:20:56,643
You know, there are very smart people
here at Harvard.

1148
01:20:56,775 --> 01:21:00,642
And even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1149
01:21:00,778 --> 01:21:04,526
And yet, you do it so easily.

1150
01:21:04,657 --> 01:21:08,155
I don't understand. I, I, I don't
understand how your mind works.

1151
01:21:08,285 --> 01:21:10,989
- Do you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1152
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,160
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1153
01:21:13,289 --> 01:21:17,666
- Yeah, a bit.
- All right. So when you, when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

1154
01:21:17,793 --> 01:21:21,327
- I see "Chopsticks. "
- All right. Well, Beethoven, okay?

1155
01:21:21,463 --> 01:21:25,294
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

1156
01:21:25,424 --> 01:21:27,713
- So, what are you saying? You play the piano?
- No, not a lick.

1157
01:21:27,843 --> 01:21:31,674
I mean, I look at a piano, I see a bunch
of keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

1158
01:21:31,805 --> 01:21:36,513
But Beethoven, Mozart,
they saw it, they could just play.

1159
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:40,260
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1160
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,269
And I can't play the piano.

1161
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:46,061
But you can do my O-chem paper
in under an hour.

1162
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:48,267
Right. Well, I mean, when it came
to stuff like that...

1163
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:50,359
I could always just play.

1164
01:21:53,114 --> 01:21:55,023
That's the best I can explain it.

1165
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,987
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?

1166
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:01,824
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

1167
01:22:01,955 --> 01:22:04,031
Well...

1168
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:23,047
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1169
01:22:23,181 --> 01:22:26,217
I've been here for four years...

1170
01:22:26,351 --> 01:22:29,055
and I've only just found you.

1171
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:32,220
Well, you found me.

1172
01:22:44,074 --> 01:22:46,113
Are you awake?

1173
01:22:46,242 --> 01:22:48,199
Nope.

1174
01:22:49,162 --> 01:22:51,201
Yes, you are.

1175
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:57,327
Will, come to California with me.

1176
01:22:58,961 --> 01:23:00,835
What?

1177
01:23:02,881 --> 01:23:05,633
I want you to come to California
with me.

1178
01:23:10,888 --> 01:23:12,762
You sure about that?

1179
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:15,427
Oh, yeah.

1180
01:23:15,559 --> 01:23:18,595
Yeah, but how do you know?

1181
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:22,642
I don't know.
I just know.

1182
01:23:22,773 --> 01:23:25,643
Yeah, but h-how do you know?

1183
01:23:25,776 --> 01:23:30,852
I know because I feel it.

1184
01:23:30,988 --> 01:23:33,561
- 'Cause that's a really serious thing you're sayin'. I mean...
- I, I know.

1185
01:23:33,699 --> 01:23:36,154
You could be in California next week,
and you know...

1186
01:23:36,285 --> 01:23:39,783
you might find out something about me
you don't like, and, you know...

1187
01:23:39,913 --> 01:23:42,913
maybe you wish you hadn't said that, but
you know it's such a serious thing...

1188
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,448
that you can't take it back,
and now I'm stuck in California...

1189
01:23:45,584 --> 01:23:48,371
with someone that doesn't really want to
be with me, just wish they had a take-back.

1190
01:23:48,503 --> 01:23:51,836
A what? What's a take-back?

1191
01:23:51,965 --> 01:23:54,289
I don't want a take-back.

1192
01:23:54,425 --> 01:23:58,007
I just want you to come
to California with me.

1193
01:23:58,136 --> 01:24:01,469
Well, I can't go to California
with you, so...

1194
01:24:03,933 --> 01:24:08,927
- Why not?
- Well, one, because I, I, I got a job here.

1195
01:24:09,062 --> 01:24:11,553
And two, because I live here.

1196
01:24:11,689 --> 01:24:15,639
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me because...

1197
01:24:15,776 --> 01:24:18,777
I'm not sayin' I don't love you.

1198
01:24:18,904 --> 01:24:24,146
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1199
01:24:24,283 --> 01:24:26,240
What am I so scared of?

1200
01:24:26,369 --> 01:24:29,784
Well, what aren't you scared of?

1201
01:24:29,913 --> 01:24:33,697
You live in this safe little world where no one challenges
you, and you're scared shitless to do anything else.

1202
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:36,869
- Because that might mean that you'd have to change.
- Don't, don't tell me about my world. Don't tell me about my world.

1203
01:24:37,003 --> 01:24:39,244
I mean, you just wanna have your little fling
with like the guy from the other side of town.

1204
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:42,380
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1205
01:24:42,507 --> 01:24:44,499
who your parents will approve of,
and just sit around...

1206
01:24:44,634 --> 01:24:48,216
with the other trust-fund babies and talk
about how you went slummin', too, once.

1207
01:24:48,345 --> 01:24:51,262
Why are you saying this?

1208
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,927
What is your obsession with this money?

1209
01:24:54,059 --> 01:24:58,519
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1210
01:24:58,646 --> 01:25:03,984
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

1211
01:25:04,109 --> 01:25:06,018
That I would give it back in a second...

1212
01:25:06,152 --> 01:25:08,690
if it meant I could have one more day
with him, but I can't.

1213
01:25:08,821 --> 01:25:10,897
And that's my life,
and I deal with it.

1214
01:25:11,031 --> 01:25:14,151
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1215
01:25:14,284 --> 01:25:16,905
I'm afraid? W-W-What am I afraid of?
So, what the fuck am I afraid of?

1216
01:25:17,036 --> 01:25:19,527
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.

1217
01:25:19,664 --> 01:25:21,952
And you know what?
I'm afraid, too!

1218
01:25:22,082 --> 01:25:25,202
But fuck it, I wanna give it a shot.
And at least I'm honest with you.

1219
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:29,249
- I'm not honest with you?
- No. What about your 12 brothers?

1220
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:31,289
All right.

1221
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:33,581
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

1222
01:25:33,717 --> 01:25:36,552
What do you wanna know? What?
That I don't have 12 brothers?

1223
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:39,050
- That I'm a fuckin' orphan? No, you don't wanna hear that.
- I didn't know that. I didn't know that.

1224
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:42,798
No, you don't wanna hear that. You don't wanna hear that I
got fuckin' cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid.

1225
01:25:42,933 --> 01:25:45,056
- Honey, I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1226
01:25:45,185 --> 01:25:48,554
That the motherfucker stabbed me.
You don't wanna hear that shit, Skylar!

1227
01:25:48,688 --> 01:25:51,179
- I do wanna hear that.
- Don't tell me you wanna hear that shit!

1228
01:25:51,315 --> 01:25:54,399
- I wanna hear it because I wanna help you, because I wanna be with you.
- Help me? What the fuck!

1229
01:25:54,526 --> 01:25:57,231
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?

1230
01:25:57,362 --> 01:25:58,820
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1231
01:25:58,947 --> 01:26:02,860
- No! God, I just want to be with you because I love you.
- Don't bullshit me. Don't bullshit me.

1232
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:05,826
- Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!
- I love you. I love you.

1233
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:08,408
I love you.

1234
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:13,745
I wanna hear you say
that you don't love me.

1235
01:26:13,876 --> 01:26:15,915
Because if you say that...

1236
01:26:17,754 --> 01:26:19,793
then I won't call you...

1237
01:26:21,174 --> 01:26:24,210
and I won't be in your life.

1238
01:26:30,682 --> 01:26:32,923
I don't love you.

1239
01:26:36,812 --> 01:26:38,685
You don't...

1240
01:27:12,926 --> 01:27:16,970
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1241
01:27:17,096 --> 01:27:19,800
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

1242
01:27:19,932 --> 01:27:23,466
They get convinced they're stupid.

1243
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:26,518
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing...

1244
01:27:26,646 --> 01:27:29,931
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you...

1245
01:27:30,065 --> 01:27:32,271
not against you.

1246
01:27:36,154 --> 01:27:38,027
Hello, Will.

1247
01:27:39,031 --> 01:27:41,273
Tom, can you get us some coffee?

1248
01:27:41,408 --> 01:27:43,282
Sure.

1249
01:27:46,829 --> 01:27:48,738
Now, let's see.

1250
01:27:54,794 --> 01:27:57,997
Good. This is correct.

1251
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:01,878
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1252
01:28:02,009 --> 01:28:05,128
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but...

1253
01:28:06,137 --> 01:28:08,509
This can't be right.

1254
01:28:10,975 --> 01:28:13,465
This would be very embarrassing.

1255
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,517
- Did you ever consider...
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1256
01:28:19,649 --> 01:28:21,522
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?

1257
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:25,944
Because I, I gotta knock off work to
come here and the commute is killing me.

1258
01:28:26,071 --> 01:28:27,446
Yeah, sure.

1259
01:28:27,572 --> 01:28:29,648
- But did you think of the possibility...
- It's right.

1260
01:28:30,825 --> 01:28:34,822
It's right.
Just take it home with you.

1261
01:28:38,123 --> 01:28:40,032
What happened at the McNeil meeting?

1262
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:45,336
I couldn't go. I had a date.
So, uh, so I sent my chief negotiator.

1263
01:28:49,174 --> 01:28:52,708
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.

1264
01:28:52,843 --> 01:28:55,548
But when I set up a meeting with,
with my associates...

1265
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,134
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1266
01:28:58,265 --> 01:29:00,553
- Well, then don't set up any more meetings.
- Well, I won't.

1267
01:29:00,683 --> 01:29:03,008
I'll cancel them.

1268
01:29:03,144 --> 01:29:06,678
I'll give you a job myself. I, I just
wanted you to see what was out there.

1269
01:29:06,813 --> 01:29:09,980
Look, maybe I don't wanna spend the, the rest of my
fuckin' life sittin' around explaining shit to people.

1270
01:29:17,614 --> 01:29:20,568
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1271
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:23,784
A little appreciation? Do you know
how easy this is for me?

1272
01:29:23,911 --> 01:29:27,077
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1273
01:29:27,206 --> 01:29:29,079
And I'm sorry you can't do this.
I really am.

1274
01:29:29,207 --> 01:29:31,745
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin'
sit here and watch you fumble around...

1275
01:29:31,876 --> 01:29:33,785
and fuck it up.

1276
01:29:38,549 --> 01:29:42,166
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1277
01:29:42,302 --> 01:29:46,844
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1278
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:03,107
Yeah, you're right, Will.

1279
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:07,948
I can't do this proof.

1280
01:30:09,575 --> 01:30:12,777
But you can. And when it comes to that,
it's only about...

1281
01:30:12,911 --> 01:30:16,244
It's just a handful of people in the world
who can tell the difference between you and me.

1282
01:30:16,372 --> 01:30:18,448
- But I'm one of 'em.
- Sorry.

1283
01:30:18,582 --> 01:30:20,740
Yeah, so am I.

1284
01:30:21,668 --> 01:30:24,040
Most days I wish I never met you...

1285
01:30:26,756 --> 01:30:28,629
because then I could sleep at night.

1286
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:31,628
And I didn't, I didn't have to walk
around with the knowledge...

1287
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,677
that there was someone like you
out there.

1288
01:30:40,809 --> 01:30:44,260
I- I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1289
01:30:51,485 --> 01:30:53,810
Bill, hold it.

1290
01:30:53,946 --> 01:30:56,152
Did you hear that?

1291
01:30:57,073 --> 01:30:58,947
Morgan!

1292
01:30:59,075 --> 01:31:01,612
Lf you're watchin' pornos
in my mom's room again...

1293
01:31:01,744 --> 01:31:03,819
I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'.

1294
01:31:20,426 --> 01:31:23,380
What's up, fellas?

1295
01:31:23,512 --> 01:31:26,466
Morgan, dude, why don't you jerk off
in your own fuckin' house, dude?

1296
01:31:26,598 --> 01:31:30,844
- That's fuckin' filthy.
- I don't got a V.C.R. At my house.

1297
01:31:30,977 --> 01:31:34,844
- You're kiddin'.
- Come on. Not in my glove.

1298
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:37,352
I didn't, I didn't use the glove.

1299
01:31:37,482 --> 01:31:39,356
That's my Little League glove.

1300
01:31:41,694 --> 01:31:44,399
What do you want me to do?

1301
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:46,688
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1302
01:31:46,823 --> 01:31:48,863
You'll hump a baseball glove?

1303
01:31:48,992 --> 01:31:52,360
I didn't. I didn't.
I just used it for the, for cleanup.

1304
01:31:53,454 --> 01:31:56,027
Will you stop jerkin' off
in my mother's room, please?

1305
01:31:56,165 --> 01:31:59,367
- Is there another V.C.R. In the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1306
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:05,836
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?

1307
01:32:05,965 --> 01:32:09,167
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

1308
01:32:09,301 --> 01:32:12,301
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology
that you wouldn't see anywhere else...

1309
01:32:12,428 --> 01:32:15,215
because we've classified it.

1310
01:32:15,348 --> 01:32:18,882
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1311
01:32:19,017 --> 01:32:22,018
Code breaking.

1312
01:32:22,145 --> 01:32:24,766
Well, that's one aspect
of what we do.

1313
01:32:24,897 --> 01:32:26,771
Oh, come on.
I mean, that is what you do.

1314
01:32:26,899 --> 01:32:29,935
You guys handle 80%
of the intelligence workload.

1315
01:32:30,068 --> 01:32:32,559
You're seven times the size
of the C.I.A.

1316
01:32:32,696 --> 01:32:35,731
We don't like to brag
about that, Will.

1317
01:32:35,865 --> 01:32:39,031
But you're exactly right.

1318
01:32:39,159 --> 01:32:42,362
So, the way I see it,
the question isn't...

1319
01:32:42,495 --> 01:32:45,068
"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"

1320
01:32:45,206 --> 01:32:47,744
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"

1321
01:32:47,875 --> 01:32:51,623
Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?

1322
01:32:51,753 --> 01:32:55,702
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

1323
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,247
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
And somebody puts a code on my desk.

1324
01:32:58,384 --> 01:33:00,257
Somethin' no one else can break.

1325
01:33:00,386 --> 01:33:02,342
Maybe I take a shot at it,
and maybe I break it.

1326
01:33:02,471 --> 01:33:04,629
And I'm real happy with myself
'cause I did my job well.

1327
01:33:04,764 --> 01:33:08,215
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East.

1328
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:11,719
And once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1329
01:33:11,854 --> 01:33:16,064
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1330
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:19,191
Now the politicians are sayin', "Oh,
send in the marines to secure the area. "

1331
01:33:19,318 --> 01:33:21,856
'Cause they don't give a shit. It won't
be their kid over there gettin' shot.

1332
01:33:21,987 --> 01:33:23,861
Just like it wasn't them
when their number got called...

1333
01:33:23,989 --> 01:33:26,111
'cause they were all pullin' a tour
in the National Guard.

1334
01:33:26,241 --> 01:33:29,075
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1335
01:33:29,202 --> 01:33:31,277
He comes back to find that the plant
he used to work at...

1336
01:33:31,412 --> 01:33:33,784
got exported to the country
he just got back from...

1337
01:33:33,914 --> 01:33:36,036
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

1338
01:33:36,166 --> 01:33:39,083
'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day
and no bathroom breaks.

1339
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:41,617
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...

1340
01:33:41,754 --> 01:33:44,790
was so that we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.

1341
01:33:44,923 --> 01:33:48,707
And, of course, the oil companies used a little
skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1342
01:33:48,843 --> 01:33:50,717
A cute little ancillary benefit
for them...

1343
01:33:50,845 --> 01:33:53,335
but it ain't helpin' my buddy
at $2.50 a gallon.

1344
01:33:53,472 --> 01:33:55,464
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil back, of course.

1345
01:33:55,599 --> 01:33:57,805
Maybe they even took the liberty
of hirin' an alcoholic skipper...

1346
01:33:57,934 --> 01:34:01,100
who likes to drink martinis and
fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs.

1347
01:34:01,229 --> 01:34:03,304
It ain't too long till he hits one,
spills the oil...

1348
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:05,976
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1349
01:34:06,108 --> 01:34:08,266
So now by buddy's out of work.
He can't afford to drive...

1350
01:34:08,401 --> 01:34:10,477
so he's walkin' to the fuckin'
job interviews, which sucks...

1351
01:34:10,611 --> 01:34:13,232
because the shrapnel in his ass
is givin' him chronic haemorrhoids.

1352
01:34:13,364 --> 01:34:15,771
And meanwhile, he's starvin' 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat...

1353
01:34:15,908 --> 01:34:20,783
the only blue plate special they're servin'
is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

1354
01:34:20,912 --> 01:34:22,785
So what did I think?

1355
01:34:22,914 --> 01:34:26,412
I'm holdin' out for something better.

1356
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:29,744
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy...

1357
01:34:29,878 --> 01:34:31,751
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy...

1358
01:34:31,879 --> 01:34:34,335
hike up gas prices, bomb a village,
club a baby seal...

1359
01:34:34,465 --> 01:34:37,169
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1360
01:34:37,301 --> 01:34:39,838
I can be elected president.

1361
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:43,172
- You feel like you're alone, Will?
- What?

1362
01:34:44,265 --> 01:34:46,672
Do you have a soul mate?

1363
01:34:46,809 --> 01:34:49,478
Do I have a...
Define that.

1364
01:34:49,603 --> 01:34:51,512
Somebody who challenges you.

1365
01:34:52,647 --> 01:34:54,556
- Uh, Chuckie.
- No, Chuckie's family.

1366
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:57,263
He'd lie down
in fuckin' traffic for you.

1367
01:34:57,401 --> 01:35:00,900
No, I'm talkin' about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.

1368
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:06,531
- I got... I got...
- Who?

1369
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:09,328
- I got plenty.
- Well, name 'em.

1370
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:12,655
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...

1371
01:35:12,789 --> 01:35:15,706
- That's great. They're all dead.
- Not to me they're not.

1372
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:18,122
Nah. You don't have
a lot of dialogue with them.

1373
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:21,335
You can't give back to them, Will.

1374
01:35:21,463 --> 01:35:23,870
Not without some serious smelling salts
and a heater.

1375
01:35:24,007 --> 01:35:26,046
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1376
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:29,632
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1377
01:35:29,762 --> 01:35:31,968
where you're always afraid
to take the first step...

1378
01:35:32,097 --> 01:35:35,596
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1379
01:35:35,725 --> 01:35:38,132
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

1380
01:35:38,269 --> 01:35:39,644
- No.
- Look, I didn't want the job.

1381
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:42,177
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

1382
01:35:42,314 --> 01:35:45,398
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1383
01:35:46,901 --> 01:35:50,400
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1384
01:35:50,529 --> 01:35:52,652
I mean, there are guys who work
their entire life layin' brick...

1385
01:35:52,781 --> 01:35:55,236
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1386
01:35:55,367 --> 01:35:57,822
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1387
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,359
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind, "I didn't ask for this. "

1388
01:36:00,496 --> 01:36:03,829
What do you mean, "cop out"? I mean,
w- w-what's wrong with layin' brick?

1389
01:36:03,957 --> 01:36:06,708
- Nothin'.
- There's nothin' wrong with it. That's, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1390
01:36:06,835 --> 01:36:11,543
Right. My day laid brick, okay? Busted
his ass so I could have an education.

1391
01:36:11,672 --> 01:36:15,171
Exactly. That's an honourable profession.
What's wrong with, with fixin' somebody's car?

1392
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:17,755
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. There's honour in that.

1393
01:36:17,886 --> 01:36:20,044
Yeah, there is, Will. There's honour
in that. And there's honour in...

1394
01:36:20,179 --> 01:36:22,171
you know, taking that
40-minute train ride...

1395
01:36:22,306 --> 01:36:24,761
so those college kids could come in
in the morning and the floors are clean.

1396
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:26,599
And the wastebaskets are empty.
That's real work.

1397
01:36:26,726 --> 01:36:29,051
- That's right.
- Right. And that's honourable.

1398
01:36:29,187 --> 01:36:32,887
Sure, that's why you took that job.
I mean, for the honour of it.

1399
01:36:33,023 --> 01:36:34,932
I just have a little question here.

1400
01:36:35,067 --> 01:36:37,736
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1401
01:36:37,861 --> 01:36:41,525
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1402
01:36:41,656 --> 01:36:44,905
And why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...

1403
01:36:45,033 --> 01:36:48,900
that only one or two people in the world
could do, and then lie about it?

1404
01:36:51,581 --> 01:36:53,905
'Cause I don't see a lot of honour
in that, Will.

1405
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:59,535
So what do you really want to do?

1406
01:37:03,758 --> 01:37:06,711
- I wanna be a shepherd.
- Really?

1407
01:37:06,843 --> 01:37:09,050
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little spread...

1408
01:37:09,179 --> 01:37:11,088
get some sheep
and tend to them.

1409
01:37:11,222 --> 01:37:14,092
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1410
01:37:14,225 --> 01:37:16,929
You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't
you just do it at home with a moist towel?

1411
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,602
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1412
01:37:18,729 --> 01:37:20,637
- Hey, no, no, no. Time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1413
01:37:20,772 --> 01:37:23,013
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- Listen, you're not gonna answer my questions.

1414
01:37:23,149 --> 01:37:25,984
- You're wastin' my fuckin' time.
- What? I thought we were friends. What do you mean, you...

1415
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:29,644
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Well, why you kickin' me out, Sean? I mean, what... I mean...

1416
01:37:29,779 --> 01:37:33,113
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1417
01:37:33,241 --> 01:37:35,399
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1418
01:37:35,534 --> 01:37:38,570
Where's your soul mate? You wanna talk
about soul mates? Where is she?

1419
01:37:38,704 --> 01:37:40,779
- Dead.
- That's right, she's fuckin' dead.

1420
01:37:40,914 --> 01:37:43,583
She fuckin' dies, and you just
cash in your chips and you walk away?

1421
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:47,835
- Hey, at least I played a hand.
- Oh, and you played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1422
01:37:47,961 --> 01:37:51,295
And some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1423
01:37:51,423 --> 01:37:54,507
Look at me.
What do you wanna do?

1424
01:38:01,556 --> 01:38:05,505
You and your bullshit. You got
a bullshit answer for everybody.

1425
01:38:05,643 --> 01:38:09,474
But I ask you a very simple question,
and you can't give me a straight answer.

1426
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:13,514
Because you don't know.

1427
01:38:15,151 --> 01:38:17,357
See ya, Bo-Peep.

1428
01:38:20,447 --> 01:38:22,605
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1429
01:38:27,328 --> 01:38:29,367
Shepherd.

1430
01:38:29,497 --> 01:38:31,572
White little prick.

1431
01:38:32,916 --> 01:38:34,790
I just wanted to, you know, um...

1432
01:38:34,918 --> 01:38:38,369
call you up, uh, before you left, um...

1433
01:38:38,504 --> 01:38:40,543
I've been takin' all these, uh,
job interviews and stuff...

1434
01:38:40,673 --> 01:38:42,795
so I'm not gonna be
just a construction worker.

1435
01:38:42,925 --> 01:38:45,795
Well, you know,
I never really cared about that.

1436
01:38:47,387 --> 01:38:49,260
Yeah.

1437
01:38:52,391 --> 01:38:53,766
I love you.

1438
01:38:59,105 --> 01:39:00,599
Will?

1439
01:39:02,149 --> 01:39:03,524
You take care.

1440
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:07,185
Someone's always comin'
around here

1441
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,858
- Trailin' some new kill
- Bye.

1442
01:39:12,074 --> 01:39:14,150
Says I seen your picture

1443
01:39:14,284 --> 01:39:18,910
On a hundred dollar bill

1444
01:39:19,038 --> 01:39:23,118
What's a game of chance to you

1445
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:25,705
In this world

1446
01:39:27,379 --> 01:39:30,794
Of real skill
So glad to meet you

1447
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:35,300
Angeles

1448
01:39:37,095 --> 01:39:39,171
Pickin' up the ticket shows

1449
01:39:39,305 --> 01:39:43,005
There's money to be made

1450
01:39:44,893 --> 01:39:46,886
Go on, lose the gamble

1451
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:51,646
That's the history of the trade

1452
01:39:51,774 --> 01:39:57,064
Did you add up
all the cards left to play

1453
01:40:00,323 --> 01:40:04,272
To zero
And sign up with people

1454
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:07,031
Angeles

1455
01:40:08,538 --> 01:40:12,073
Don't start with me tryin'

1456
01:40:14,502 --> 01:40:16,909
Will, come on.
Will!

1457
01:40:19,089 --> 01:40:21,330
Will, that's it.
We're done here.

1458
01:40:21,466 --> 01:40:24,466
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

1459
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:30,051
Well, it's ten past 5:00.
An hour and ten minutes late.

1460
01:40:30,182 --> 01:40:33,882
I can make you satisfied
in everything

1461
01:40:34,018 --> 01:40:36,141
Well, what if he doesn't show up
and I file a report...

1462
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:38,144
saying he wasn't here
and he goes back to jail?

1463
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:41,023
Lt won't be on my conscience.

1464
01:40:41,149 --> 01:40:44,103
Now becoming true

1465
01:40:44,235 --> 01:40:46,726
Okay. Fine.

1466
01:40:48,864 --> 01:40:50,738
What's up?

1467
01:40:52,659 --> 01:40:54,532
Thanks.

1468
01:40:59,415 --> 01:41:01,288
Fuck, that's good.

1469
01:41:04,961 --> 01:41:07,084
So how's your lady?

1470
01:41:07,213 --> 01:41:09,086
Ah, she's gone.

1471
01:41:10,382 --> 01:41:12,588
Gone? Gone where?

1472
01:41:12,718 --> 01:41:17,094
Uh, med school.
Medical school in California.

1473
01:41:17,221 --> 01:41:18,419
- Really?
- Yeah.

1474
01:41:18,556 --> 01:41:21,093
- When was this?
- It was like a week ago.

1475
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:28,220
That sucks.

1476
01:41:30,733 --> 01:41:34,350
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetin's?

1477
01:41:34,486 --> 01:41:36,359
I think the week after I'm 21.

1478
01:41:36,488 --> 01:41:39,157
Yeah? They gonna hook you up
with a job or what?

1479
01:41:39,282 --> 01:41:43,493
Yeah. Fuckin' sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1480
01:41:43,619 --> 01:41:46,952
Ah, probably make some nice bank though.

1481
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,953
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

1482
01:41:49,082 --> 01:41:52,450
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1483
01:41:52,585 --> 01:41:54,411
Well, uh, what do I want a way
out of here for?

1484
01:41:54,545 --> 01:41:57,082
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin' live here
the rest of my life.

1485
01:41:57,213 --> 01:41:59,289
You know, be neighbours.
You know, have little kids.

1486
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:02,294
Fuckin' take them to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1487
01:42:05,596 --> 01:42:08,051
Look, you're my best friend
so don't take this the wrong way...

1488
01:42:08,181 --> 01:42:11,929
but in 20 years,
if you're still livin' here...

1489
01:42:12,059 --> 01:42:15,262
comin' over to my house to watch the
Patriot's games, still workin' construction...

1490
01:42:15,395 --> 01:42:17,471
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1491
01:42:17,606 --> 01:42:20,227
- That's not a threat. That's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.
- What?

1492
01:42:20,358 --> 01:42:22,481
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1493
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:26,559
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on. W-Why is it always this?

1494
01:42:26,697 --> 01:42:29,781
I mean, I fuckin' owe it to myself to do
this or that. What if I don't want to?

1495
01:42:29,908 --> 01:42:33,905
Oh, no, no, no. No, fuck you.
You don't owe it to yourself.

1496
01:42:34,036 --> 01:42:36,194
You owe it to me...

1497
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:38,820
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna wake up
and I'll be 50...

1498
01:42:38,957 --> 01:42:41,792
and I'll still be doin' this shit.

1499
01:42:41,918 --> 01:42:43,875
And that's all right. That's fine.

1500
01:42:44,003 --> 01:42:46,672
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1501
01:42:46,797 --> 01:42:50,497
And you're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

1502
01:42:52,677 --> 01:42:55,346
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1503
01:42:55,471 --> 01:42:58,341
So would any of these fuckin' guys.

1504
01:42:58,473 --> 01:43:00,929
It'd be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1505
01:43:01,059 --> 01:43:04,178
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1506
01:43:04,312 --> 01:43:05,889
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1507
01:43:06,022 --> 01:43:08,097
- No, you don't know that.
- Oh, I don't know that.

1508
01:43:08,232 --> 01:43:10,105
Let me tell you what I do know.

1509
01:43:10,233 --> 01:43:13,400
Every day I come by your house
and I pick you up.

1510
01:43:13,528 --> 01:43:17,525
And we go out and we have a few drinks
and a few laughs, and it's great.

1511
01:43:17,656 --> 01:43:20,277
You know what the best part
of my day is?

1512
01:43:20,409 --> 01:43:24,702
For about ten seconds, from when I pull
up to the kerb and when I get to your door.

1513
01:43:24,829 --> 01:43:26,868
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there
and I'll knock on the door...

1514
01:43:26,998 --> 01:43:29,535
and you won't be there.

1515
01:43:29,666 --> 01:43:33,082
No "goodbye," no "see ya later. "
No nothin'. You just left.

1516
01:43:34,837 --> 01:43:38,455
I don't know much, but I know that.

1517
01:43:49,934 --> 01:43:52,140
This is a disaster, Sean.

1518
01:43:52,269 --> 01:43:54,842
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy.

1519
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:57,055
- Not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy, Gerry.

1520
01:43:57,190 --> 01:44:00,641
I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy! I
don't care if you have a few laughs, even at my expense.

1521
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:03,314
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

1522
01:44:03,445 --> 01:44:06,481
- Undermine?
- This boy is at a fragile point right now.

1523
01:44:06,614 --> 01:44:09,698
I do understand. He is at a fragile
point, okay? He's got problems.

1524
01:44:09,825 --> 01:44:13,324
Well, what problems does he have, Sean? That he's
better off as a janitor? That he's better off in jail?

1525
01:44:13,453 --> 01:44:16,370
Better off hanging out with a bunch
of retarded gorillas?

1526
01:44:16,498 --> 01:44:20,411
Oh, why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Do you have any fuckin' clue why? Hmm?

1527
01:44:20,543 --> 01:44:23,958
He can handle the problems. He can handle
the work, and he obviously handled you.

1528
01:44:24,087 --> 01:44:28,167
Gerry, listen to me. Listen. Why is he
hiding? Why doesn't he trust anybody?

1529
01:44:28,299 --> 01:44:31,668
Because the first thing that happened to him, he was
abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most.

1530
01:44:31,802 --> 01:44:34,174
- Oh, come on, don't give me that Freudian crap.
- Oh, no, listen, Gerry.

1531
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:37,174
And why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1532
01:44:37,307 --> 01:44:41,090
Because any one of them, if you asked them to,
would take a fuckin' bat to your head. Okay?

1533
01:44:41,227 --> 01:44:43,136
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1534
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:47,219
And who is he handling? He pushes people
away before they have a chance to leave him.

1535
01:44:47,357 --> 01:44:49,848
It's a defence mechanism, all right?

1536
01:44:49,984 --> 01:44:52,522
And for 20 years he's been alone
because of that.

1537
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:55,358
And if you push him right now, it's
gonna be the same thing all over again.

1538
01:44:55,489 --> 01:44:57,362
And I'm not gonna let
that happen to him.

1539
01:44:57,491 --> 01:44:59,150
- Now, don't you do that, Sean.
- What, Gerry?

1540
01:44:59,284 --> 01:45:02,154
Don't you do that. Don't infect him
with the idea that it's okay to quit.

1541
01:45:02,286 --> 01:45:05,203
That it's okay to be a failure,
because it's not okay, Sean.

1542
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:08,913
And if you're angry at me for being, being
successful, for being what you could have been, Sean...

1543
01:45:09,042 --> 01:45:11,829
- I'm not angry at you, Gerry.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me, Sean.

1544
01:45:11,961 --> 01:45:16,207
You resent me. But I'm not gonna
apologize for any, any success I've had.

1545
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:18,877
You're angry at me for doing what
you could have done.

1546
01:45:19,009 --> 01:45:23,255
But ask yourself, Sean. Ask yourself
if you want Will to feel that way.

1547
01:45:23,387 --> 01:45:26,672
- Lf you want him to feel like a failure.
- Oh, you arrogant shit!

1548
01:45:26,807 --> 01:45:29,380
That's why I don't come
to the goddam reunions.

1549
01:45:29,518 --> 01:45:31,391
'Cause I can't stand
that look in your eye.

1550
01:45:31,519 --> 01:45:34,389
- You know, that condescending embarrassed look?
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1551
01:45:34,522 --> 01:45:36,561
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

1552
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:39,607
And I'm proud of what I do.
It was a conscious choice.

1553
01:45:39,735 --> 01:45:41,442
I didn't fuck up.

1554
01:45:41,569 --> 01:45:43,858
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1555
01:45:43,988 --> 01:45:47,688
You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around
going, "The Field's medal! The Field's medal!"

1556
01:45:47,825 --> 01:45:50,909
Why are you still so fuckin' afraid
of failure?

1557
01:45:51,036 --> 01:45:54,736
Lt's about my medal, is it? Oh, God, I could
go home and get it for you. You can have it.

1558
01:45:54,872 --> 01:45:58,205
Oh, please don't. You know... You know what, Gerry?
Shove the medal up your fuckin' ass, all right?

1559
01:45:58,334 --> 01:46:02,413
'Cause I don't give a shit about your medal because
I knew you before you were a mathematical god.

1560
01:46:02,545 --> 01:46:06,080
When you were pimple-faced and homesick, and
didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1561
01:46:06,215 --> 01:46:08,006
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.

1562
01:46:08,133 --> 01:46:10,209
So don't blame me for how your life
turned out. It's not my fault.

1563
01:46:10,344 --> 01:46:14,257
I don't blame you. It's not about you,
you mathematical dick!

1564
01:46:14,389 --> 01:46:16,926
Lt's about the boy.
He's a good kid.

1565
01:46:17,058 --> 01:46:20,426
And I won't see you fuck him up like
you're trying to fuck up me right now.

1566
01:46:20,561 --> 01:46:23,134
I won't see you make him feel
like a failure, too.

1567
01:46:23,271 --> 01:46:26,106
- He won't be a failure, Sean!
- But, but if you push him, Gerry...

1568
01:46:26,232 --> 01:46:29,067
- If you ride him...
- Sean, I am what I am today...

1569
01:46:29,193 --> 01:46:32,443
because I was pushed and
because I learned to push myself.

1570
01:46:32,571 --> 01:46:34,943
He's not you! Do you get that?

1571
01:46:37,116 --> 01:46:40,117
- I can come back.
- No, come in. Uh...

1572
01:46:40,244 --> 01:46:42,651
I was just leaving.

1573
01:46:52,963 --> 01:46:56,628
A lot of that stuff goes back a long way
between me and him.

1574
01:46:56,758 --> 01:46:58,964
You know. Not about you.

1575
01:47:04,306 --> 01:47:07,591
- What is that?
- This is your file.

1576
01:47:07,725 --> 01:47:10,097
I have to send it back to the judge
for evaluation.

1577
01:47:10,228 --> 01:47:13,014
Oh.

1578
01:47:13,147 --> 01:47:15,305
Hey, you're not gonna fail me, are you?

1579
01:47:19,068 --> 01:47:20,942
What's it say?

1580
01:47:22,446 --> 01:47:24,485
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1581
01:47:27,951 --> 01:47:30,157
Have you had any, uh, experience
with that?

1582
01:47:30,286 --> 01:47:33,820
Twenty years of counselling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1583
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:38,205
I mean, have you had any experience
with that?

1584
01:47:42,255 --> 01:47:44,662
Personally?

1585
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:46,791
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I have.

1586
01:47:48,426 --> 01:47:49,837
It sure ain't good.

1587
01:47:53,931 --> 01:47:58,343
My father was an alcoholic.
Mean, fuckin' drunk.

1588
01:47:59,894 --> 01:48:02,811
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1589
01:48:02,939 --> 01:48:06,390
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't
go after my mother and little brother.

1590
01:48:08,402 --> 01:48:11,023
Interesting nights
were when he wore his rings.

1591
01:48:12,864 --> 01:48:16,315
Yeah, he used to just put
a, uh, a wrench...

1592
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:19,154
a stick and a belt
on the table...

1593
01:48:19,286 --> 01:48:21,574
and just say, "Choose. "

1594
01:48:21,705 --> 01:48:23,364
Well, I gotta go with the belt
there, then.

1595
01:48:23,498 --> 01:48:27,542
- I used to go with the wrench.
- Why the wrench?

1596
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:29,744
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1597
01:48:29,878 --> 01:48:33,211
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1598
01:48:33,339 --> 01:48:38,333
So, uh, you know, what is it? Like Will has
an attachment disorder? Ls it all that stuff?

1599
01:48:39,970 --> 01:48:42,543
Fear of abandonment?

1600
01:48:42,681 --> 01:48:45,883
Ls that why, uh, is that why
I broke up with Skylar?

1601
01:48:46,017 --> 01:48:49,350
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1602
01:48:49,478 --> 01:48:51,554
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1603
01:48:55,566 --> 01:48:58,139
Hey, Will?

1604
01:48:58,277 --> 01:49:00,316
I don't know a lot.

1605
01:49:01,697 --> 01:49:04,780
But you see this?
All this shit?

1606
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:11,779
This is not your fault.

1607
01:49:13,874 --> 01:49:16,245
Yeah, I know that.

1608
01:49:16,376 --> 01:49:18,249
Look at me, son.

1609
01:49:19,545 --> 01:49:21,870
It's not your fault.

1610
01:49:22,005 --> 01:49:26,417
- I know.
- No. It's not your fault.

1611
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:31,426
- I know.
- No, no, you don't.

1612
01:49:31,555 --> 01:49:33,761
It's not your fault.

1613
01:49:35,767 --> 01:49:37,558
- I know.
- It's not your fault.

1614
01:49:37,685 --> 01:49:40,721
- All right.
- It's not your fault.

1615
01:49:43,565 --> 01:49:45,439
It's not your fault.

1616
01:49:45,567 --> 01:49:47,476
Don't fuck with me.

1617
01:49:50,321 --> 01:49:53,108
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me. All right?

1618
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:56,276
- Don't fuck with me, Sean. Not you.
- It's not your fault.

1619
01:50:05,584 --> 01:50:08,157
It's not your fault.

1620
01:50:13,174 --> 01:50:15,047
Oh, my God!

1621
01:50:16,259 --> 01:50:20,173
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Oh, God.

1622
01:50:34,859 --> 01:50:36,767
Fuck them, okay?

1623
01:52:03,225 --> 01:52:05,550
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm, uh, Will Hunting.

1624
01:52:05,685 --> 01:52:09,469
- I'm here about a position.
- Could you just have a seat for a moment?

1625
01:52:13,358 --> 01:52:16,893
Yes, there's a Mr Hunting in the lobby.
He's here for his appointment.

1626
01:52:36,878 --> 01:52:38,917
Which one did you take?

1627
01:52:39,047 --> 01:52:43,791
I was over at, uh, McNeil. It's one of
the jobs the professor set me up with.

1628
01:52:43,926 --> 01:52:48,254
Uh, I haven't told him yet, but I went, I
went down there and I talked to my boss, and...

1629
01:52:48,388 --> 01:52:51,341
My new boss.
He seemed like a good guy.

1630
01:52:51,474 --> 01:52:54,427
Is that what you want?

1631
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:57,264
Yeah, you know, I think so.

1632
01:52:57,395 --> 01:53:00,479
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

1633
01:53:00,606 --> 01:53:02,480
Thanks.

1634
01:53:05,611 --> 01:53:07,484
Time's up.

1635
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:13,609
So that's, so that's it?
So we're, we're done?

1636
01:53:13,743 --> 01:53:16,447
Yeah, that's it.

1637
01:53:16,578 --> 01:53:18,950
You're done. You're a free man.

1638
01:53:20,748 --> 01:53:25,374
Well, um, I just want you
to know, Sean, that...

1639
01:53:25,502 --> 01:53:27,376
You're welcome, Will.

1640
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,801
So, you know, I, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1641
01:53:35,928 --> 01:53:38,253
Yeah, me, too.

1642
01:53:38,388 --> 01:53:41,009
I'll be travelling around a bit,
and it'll be a little hard, but, uh...

1643
01:53:41,141 --> 01:53:44,805
I've got an answering machine at
the college I'll be checking in with.

1644
01:53:44,936 --> 01:53:48,386
So, here's the number.

1645
01:53:48,522 --> 01:53:51,059
You call that, and I'll
get back to you right away.

1646
01:53:52,817 --> 01:53:55,604
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1647
01:53:55,736 --> 01:53:59,069
put my money back on the table
and see what kind of cards I get.

1648
01:54:01,783 --> 01:54:04,155
You do what's in your heart, son.
You'll be fine.

1649
01:54:07,455 --> 01:54:09,162
Yeah.

1650
01:54:09,289 --> 01:54:11,365
- Thank you, Sean.
- Yeah.

1651
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:13,492
Thank you, Will.

1652
01:54:15,211 --> 01:54:18,461
Hey, does this violate the, uh,
patient-doctor relationship?

1653
01:54:18,589 --> 01:54:20,795
Nah. Only if you grab my ass.

1654
01:54:24,511 --> 01:54:26,717
- Take care.
- You, too.

1655
01:54:26,846 --> 01:54:28,719
Yeah.

1656
01:54:30,682 --> 01:54:32,556
Hey.

1657
01:54:32,684 --> 01:54:35,009
Good luck, son.

1658
01:54:46,154 --> 01:54:48,193
Two beers!

1659
01:54:52,451 --> 01:54:55,700
- What's up? Did you guys go?
- No. I had to talk him down.

1660
01:54:55,829 --> 01:54:57,453
Why didn't you yoke him?

1661
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:59,786
Uh, little Morgan's got
a lot of scrap to him.

1662
01:54:59,915 --> 01:55:03,082
You know, people try to whip his ass
every week. Fuckin' kid won't back down.

1663
01:55:03,210 --> 01:55:08,001
- What are you sayin' about me?
- Was I talkin' to you? Mind your fuckin' business.

1664
01:55:08,923 --> 01:55:11,330
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers.

1665
01:55:11,467 --> 01:55:13,625
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1666
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,259
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch? Fuckin' come on.

1667
01:55:17,389 --> 01:55:20,424
- Come on. I got ya first.
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1668
01:55:20,558 --> 01:55:22,681
- All right, who's first?
- Come on, motherfucker.

1669
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:26,427
- All right. Who's first? Come on. Who's first?
- Oh, Danny boy

1670
01:55:26,563 --> 01:55:28,555
Here's your present.

1671
01:55:30,108 --> 01:55:31,650
- Come on, brother.
- What?

1672
01:55:31,776 --> 01:55:35,524
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1673
01:55:35,654 --> 01:55:40,232
And, anyway, I wasn't gonna
fuckin' drive you every day, so...

1674
01:55:40,366 --> 01:55:42,026
- Fuckin' can't be.
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

1675
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:44,401
That's not what I was sayin'.

1676
01:55:44,536 --> 01:55:46,861
But, uh, 21 now, so...

1677
01:55:46,997 --> 01:55:50,496
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for you, kid, was a car.

1678
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:52,950
- How do you like it?
- This is like...

1679
01:55:55,713 --> 01:55:59,757
This is the ugliest fuckin' car
I ever seen in my life.

1680
01:55:59,883 --> 01:56:03,002
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1681
01:56:03,135 --> 01:56:05,377
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts...

1682
01:56:05,512 --> 01:56:08,846
and, uh, Morgan was out
panhandlin' for change every day.

1683
01:56:08,974 --> 01:56:12,140
- I had the router do all the bodywork.
- Yeah, I have a fuckin' job, too, brother.

1684
01:56:12,268 --> 01:56:15,352
Guy's been up my ass for two years about
a job. I had to let him help with the car.

1685
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:16,938
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan?

1686
01:56:17,064 --> 01:56:19,140
Yeah, had one.
Now I'm fucked again.

1687
01:56:19,274 --> 01:56:22,440
- So what is it, a lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1688
01:56:22,569 --> 01:56:24,608
Me and Bill rebuilt this engine
ourselves here.

1689
01:56:24,737 --> 01:56:27,821
It's a good car, dude.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1690
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:32,239
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1691
01:56:40,709 --> 01:56:42,618
Hi.

1692
01:56:42,752 --> 01:56:44,745
Come on in.

1693
01:56:47,423 --> 01:56:50,340
- Sean, I, um...
- Me, too, Gerry.

1694
01:56:51,885 --> 01:56:53,794
Yeah. Good.

1695
01:56:55,805 --> 01:56:57,513
- I heard you're takin' some time.
- Yeah.

1696
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:01,767
I'll travel a little bit,
maybe write.

1697
01:57:01,893 --> 01:57:03,767
So where are you going?

1698
01:57:03,895 --> 01:57:07,809
India and China and Baltimore.

1699
01:57:09,567 --> 01:57:11,606
Oh.

1700
01:57:11,735 --> 01:57:17,155
- You know when you'll be back?
- Well, I got this flyer the other day.

1701
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:20,235
It says, uh, class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1702
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:22,241
Yeah, I got one of those, too.

1703
01:57:22,369 --> 01:57:24,112
Why don't you come?
I'll buy you a drink.

1704
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:26,989
The drinks at those things are free.

1705
01:57:27,123 --> 01:57:30,657
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

1706
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,417
Oh.

1707
01:57:37,548 --> 01:57:40,121
How about a drink right now?

1708
01:57:40,259 --> 01:57:42,002
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1709
01:57:42,136 --> 01:57:44,461
Come on. This one's on me.

1710
01:57:47,265 --> 01:57:49,388
- Got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh.

1711
01:57:49,517 --> 01:57:51,675
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1712
01:57:52,853 --> 01:57:55,344
This is my ticket to paradise.

1713
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:57,354
Sean, do you know what the odds are
against winning the lottery?

1714
01:57:57,482 --> 01:58:00,518
- What, four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

1715
01:58:00,651 --> 01:58:04,600
- I still have a shot, you know?
- Yes, just about as big a chance...

1716
01:58:04,738 --> 01:58:07,692
as you being hit by lightning
here on the staircase right now.

1717
01:58:07,824 --> 01:58:09,567
Aw, that's a possibility, too, Gerry.

1718
01:58:09,701 --> 01:58:12,072
- I mean, 32 million. If you look at the size...
- Sean!

1719
01:59:41,528 --> 01:59:43,935
Will!

1720
02:00:02,879 --> 02:00:04,788
Will?

1721
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,057
He's not there.

1722
02:01:31,121 --> 02:01:35,070
I'll fake it through the day

1723
02:01:35,207 --> 02:01:38,410
Sean, if the professor calls
about that job...

1724
02:01:38,543 --> 02:01:40,702
just tell him sorry.

1725
02:01:40,837 --> 02:01:44,040
I had to go see about a girl.
Will.

1726
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:49,883
Son of a bitch.
He stole my line.

1727
02:01:53,681 --> 02:01:55,555
<i>With two tickets</i>

1728
02:01:55,683 --> 02:01:59,894
<i>Torn in half for LA</i>

1729
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:03,638
<i>With nothing to do</i>

1730
02:02:03,773 --> 02:02:07,058
<i>Do you miss me</i>

1731
02:02:07,193 --> 02:02:10,857
<i>Miss Misery</i>

1732
02:02:10,987 --> 02:02:14,190
<i>Like you say you do</i>

1733
02:02:16,576 --> 02:02:20,822
<i>I know you'd rather see me gone</i>

1734
02:02:20,954 --> 02:02:23,789
<i>Than to see me</i>

1735
02:02:23,915 --> 02:02:28,078
<i>The way that I am</i>

1736
02:02:28,210 --> 02:02:32,955
<i>But I am in the life anyway</i>

1737
02:02:33,089 --> 02:02:35,924
<i>Next door</i>

1738
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:40,213
<i>The TV's flashing blue</i>

1739
02:02:40,346 --> 02:02:43,928
<i>Frames on the wall</i>

1740
02:02:44,057 --> 02:02:46,927
<i>It's a comedy</i>

1741
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:49,550
<i>Of errors, you see</i>

1742
02:02:49,687 --> 02:02:54,478
<i>It's about taking a fall</i>

1743
02:02:56,901 --> 02:02:58,775
<i>To vanish</i>

1744
02:02:58,903 --> 02:03:03,066
<i>Into oblivion</i>

1745
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:06,898
<i>It's easy to do</i>

1746
02:03:07,035 --> 02:03:09,786
<i>And I try to be</i>

1747
02:03:09,912 --> 02:03:13,992
<i>But you know me
I come back</i>

1748
02:03:14,124 --> 02:03:18,370
<i>When you want me to</i>

1749
02:03:18,503 --> 02:03:21,918
<i>Do you miss me</i>

1750
02:03:22,047 --> 02:03:25,665
<i>Miss Misery</i>

1751
02:03:25,801 --> 02:03:29,299
<i>Like you say you do</i>

1752
02:03:44,733 --> 02:03:47,853
<i>Gonna find my baby
Gonna hold her tight</i>

1753
02:03:47,986 --> 02:03:51,568
<i>Gonna grab
some afternoon delight</i>

1754
02:03:51,697 --> 02:03:54,568
<i>My motto's always been
When it's right, it's right</i>

1755
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:58,199
<i>Why wait until the middle
of a cold, dark night</i>
