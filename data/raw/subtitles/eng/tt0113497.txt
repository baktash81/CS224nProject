1
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,475
Don't worry. It's just a pack of wolves.
Come on. We're almost rid of it.

2
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,162
- Caleb, it's after me!
- Grab on!

3
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,873
Run! Run!

4
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:26,544
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.
Come on. Help me bury it.

5
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,550
What if someone digs it up?

6
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,889
May God have mercy
on his soul.

BRANTFCRD, NEW HAMPSHIRE

9
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,383
- Hi, Alan.
- Hi, Miss Magruder.

10
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,844
- Good afternoon, Alan.
- Hey, Frank.

11
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,438
- All yours, Alan.
- Thanks, Bill.

12
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,621
Get him!

13
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,254
Prepare to die, Parrish!

14
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,133
Hey, Parrish,
what's the rush?

15
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,850
He's go in' to
his dad's factory!

16
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,772
Alan wants his daddy now!

17
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,455
Go ahead, Parrish.
Run to Daddy. We'll be waiting.

18
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,188
- Hi, Carl.
- Hey, Alan, I gotta show you something.

19
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,775
Come here. Now, I've been
working on this for almost a year.

20
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:58,488
I got an appointment this afternoon
with your father to show him this.

21
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,282
Go ahead. Take it.

22
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,493
So what do ya think?
Ya think he'll like it?

23
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,913
- What is it?
- What is it?

24
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,500
Man, this is the future. If I can
get Wilt Chamberlain to wear 'em...

25
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,129
I predict there'll be a pair of those
in every closet in America.

26
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,339
That's gonna be
the height of fashion.

27
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,301
What's wrong?

28
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,347
- Nothin'.
- Alan !

29
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,892
Thanks, Bob.
What are you doing here?

30
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,312
I've told you before. This factory
isn't a playground. It's dangerous.

31
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,816
- Dad, can I have a ride home?
- Look, Alan.

32
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,861
Is Billy Jessup
picking on you again?

33
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,282
Son, you're gonna have to
face him sooner or later.

34
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:47,037
Look, if you're afraid of something,
you've got to stand and face it.

35
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,248
Now, run on, son.

36
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,877
Carl, you should know better
than to let the boy play in here.

37
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,046
Sorry, sir.

38
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:00,050
- What was it you wanted to show me?
- Just a minute, sir.

39
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,893
What the devil--

40
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,606
Get an extinguisher.

41
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,910
Who did this?

42
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,454
Well?

43
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,417
I did, sir.

44
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,851
Just because you're a Parrish doesn't
mean you can hang around my girlfriend.

45
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,731
- We're just friends.
- Not anymore. Get him!

46
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,571
- Let's go!
- Okay, I've got his bike.

47
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,995
Jerks!

48
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,863
Wow.

49
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,664
Neat.

50
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,674
Alan. Are you home?

51
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:21,686
Oh, Alan, not again.
Come on.

52
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,609
Hard work, determination,
a cheerful outlook--

53
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,528
attributes that have exemplified
the Brantford spirit...

54
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,532
since our forefathers
first settled this town.

55
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,787
Despite the harshness of our native
clime and the granite of our soil...

56
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,956
- we have--
- Prospered.

57
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,002
- I knew the damn thing this morning.
- You'll know the darn thing tonight.

58
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,048
- All right. Let's go.
- Sam. We have to talk to Alan.

59
00:09:56,304 --> 00:10:00,809
- Well, we're on our way.
- Okay.

60
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:05,146
I told your father what you told me this
afternoon. It wasn't just Billy Jessup.

61
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,774
Look, if I'd known that,
Alan, I wouldn't have--

62
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,528
- It's okay, Dad.
- I want you to know I am proud of you.

63
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,322
I mean, you faced them, even
though you were outnumbered.

64
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,409
And since you
took it like a man...

65
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,453
your mother and I have decided
that you're ready to go...

66
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,831
to the Cliffside School for Boys.

67
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,375
- There.
- Congratulations, sweetheart.

68
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,922
- You don't want me living here anymore?
- Alan.

69
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,093
It's always been the plan that you go
to Cliffside when you were ready.

70
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,514
I mean, Parrishes have been going
to Cliffside ever since the 1700s.

71
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,517
Even your Uncle Skylar
went there.

72
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,229
- Look at this. Parrish Hall.
- It's the main dormitory.

73
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,862
Oh, this is great. Kids are on my
case here because I'm a Parrish.

74
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,532
Just wait till I'm living in
a building named after me.

75
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,035
It was named
after my father.

76
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,580
- Good. Why don't you live in it?
- I did!

77
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,624
I wouldn't be who I am today
if it weren't for my years there.

78
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:12,047
Maybe I don't wanna be who you are.
Maybe I don't wanna be a Parrish.

79
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,844
You won't be.
Not till you start acting like one.

80
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,138
Get your coat!

81
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,353
I guess I'm not ready
for Cliffside then!

82
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:31,149
We're taking you there next Sunday! l
don't wanna hear another word about it!

83
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:35,403
You won't.
I'm never talking to you again!

84
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,911
- Sam--
- Don't!

85
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,330
- Sam--
- What?

86
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,664
Nothing. Just--

87
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,362
- What are you doing here?
- I brought your bike back.

88
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,491
You didn't have to. I was going
over to Billy's to get it myself.

89
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,370
I told Billy to stop
picking on you.

90
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,207
You shouldn't have wasted your breath.
We'll talk about this some other time.

91
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,710
What was that?

92
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,381
- You heard it too?
- Of course I heard it.

93
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,052
Come on. I found this weird game
in the factory.

94
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,887
A game?

95
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,864
"Jumanji.

96
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:05,535
A game for those who seek to find
a way to leave their world behind.

97
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,205
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles gets another turn.

98
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,584
And the first player to reach
the end wins." You wanna play?

99
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,421
I quit playing board games
five years ago.

100
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,384
Sarah.

101
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:31,227
- It's gotta be magnetized or something.
- Alan, look.

102
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,108
"At night they fly,
you better run...

103
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,820
these winged things
are not much fun."

104
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,456
- What was that?
- I don't know.

105
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,417
- Put it away, Alan!
- Okay.

106
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,969
Oh, no.
The game thinks I rolled.

107
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,139
What do you mean,
"The game thinks"?

108
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,144
"In the jungle you must wait...

109
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:17,232
until the dice
read five or eight."

110
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:22,070
"In the jungle you must wait--"
What's that mean?

111
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,883
Roll the dice!

112
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,717
I think a bed-and-breakfast
is just what this town needs.

113
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,554
Well, it's pretty hard to pass up,
especially full of furniture.

114
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,725
Oh, boy! I keep forgetting
how big this place is.

115
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,394
Judy, Peter,
come look at this.

116
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,730
I'm gonna put
a reception area over here.

117
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,817
And a bar over here
in the parlor.

118
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:51,493
That sounds lovely. I'm sure you and
your kids are gonna be very happy here.

119
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:56,039
Oh. Well, actually,
they're my late brother's.

120
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,084
He and his wife passed away
just last winter.

121
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,923
Is this something,
or what?

122
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,259
It sure is.

123
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,443
So, what do you think, young man?
Is it big enough for you?

124
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,000
Peter hasn't spoken a word
since it happened.

125
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,881
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.
How terribly awful.

126
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:52,053
It's okay.
We barely even knew our parents.

127
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:56,975
They were always away-- skiing in
Saint Moritz, gambling in Monte Carlo...

128
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,937
seafaring in darkest Africa.

129
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,441
We didn't even know
if they loved us.

130
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,444
But when the sheik's yacht
went down, well...

131
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,530
they managed to write us
a really beautiful good-bye note...

132
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:15,285
that was found floating in
a champagne bottle amongst the debris.

133
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,619
Excuse me.

134
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,590
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.

135
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,634
- So you'll send me those escrow papers?
- First thing tomorrow.

136
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,753
I'll have to get a locksmith
out for this one.

137
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,339
Peter, pick up your toys,
please.

138
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:19,307
Peter, take this suitcase
up to the attic.

139
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,852
Then we can all have
ice cream and bourbon.

140
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,965
What? What is it?

141
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:56,553
- I'm going to Motel 6.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.

142
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,206
I don't see any guano.

143
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,715
- He said it looked like that.
- That's an African bat.

144
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,468
Some kid said she saw a bunch
of those back in the '60s.

145
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,971
But we don't get bats
like that in New England.

146
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:43,933
- But that's what he saw.
- Well, whatever it was...

147
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,436
is gone now.

148
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,607
Bats aren't what I'd worry about
in this house any ways.

149
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,484
What would you worry about?

150
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,611
Well, personally...

151
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,739
I wouldn't wanna live in a house
where someone was murdered.

152
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,826
- Murdered?
- Yep.

153
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,913
Little Alan Parrish.
I say his father did it.

154
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:10,085
There's a thousand and one places he
could have hid the body in this house.

155
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,172
Especially if he
chopped it up first.

156
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:18,718
Hey, up there! You kids don't wanna
be late for your first day of school.

157
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,934
- Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
- Ya hear that?

158
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,729
There is nothing
to be afraid of in this house.

159
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,676
I can't believe I have to see
your principal after the first day.

160
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,344
What am I gonna do?

161
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:08,393
Let's just try to relax and finish our
dinner and talk about something else.

162
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,895
Well, we found out why
you got this house so cheap.

163
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:15,567
Twenty-six years ago, a kid named
Alan Parrish used to live here.

164
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,861
Then one day,
he just disappeared...

165
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,906
'cause his parents chopped him up in
little pieces and hid him in the walls.

166
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,910
Okay, that's it. I am sick and tired of
your lies, young lady. You're grounded.

167
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:33,001
Fine. There's nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway.

168
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:36,880
And just for your information,
that wasn't a lie.

169
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,420
Did you hear anything
a little while ago?

170
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,592
Do you miss Mom and Dad?

171
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:27,180
- No.
- Liar.

172
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,767
If you don't cut that out,
they're gonna send you to a shrink.

173
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:34,646
Where do you think they're gonna
send you if you don't start talking?

174
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,834
If I get held up at the permit office,
I'll give you a call.

175
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:59,170
School bus should be here
any minute.

176
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,716
You guys still have
your house keys?

177
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,719
You guys listening to me?

178
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,014
Hello?

179
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,809
- Hello?
- What?

180
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,938
Maybe I should wait
with you till the bus comes.

181
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:21,026
Did your parents used
to put you on the bus?

182
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,653
- No. No.
- Are you sure?

183
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,531
I could drop you off.

184
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:30,660
No, don't worry about us.
The bus'll be here any minute.

185
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:33,955
Okay.
Please be good today.

186
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:47,427
- You do hear it.
- Hear what?

187
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,778
Where's it coming from?

188
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,268
Wow.

189
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,771
Let's bring it over here.

190
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,328
Weird. They're stuck.

191
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:59,874
"Jumanji. A game for those who seek to
find a way to leave their world behind.

192
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,752
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles get another turn.

193
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:06,131
The first player
to reach the end wins."

194
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,139
It's gotta be microchips
or something.

195
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,101
You go first.

196
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,271
Okay.

197
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,775
Six.

198
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:43,001
"A tiny bite can make you itch,
make you sneeze, make you twitch."

199
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,332
Don't!

200
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,881
"This will not be
an easy mission...

201
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,676
monkeys slow the expedition."

202
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,682
What is that?

203
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,059
I bet those monkeys came from the game.
The mosquitoes too.

204
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:28,440
Uh-oh.
I didn't see this part.

205
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:34,571
"Adventurers beware."

206
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:44,956
"Adventurers beware. Do not begin
unless you intend to finish.

207
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,792
The exciting consequences
of the game will vanish...

208
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:51,087
only when a player has reached
Jumanji and called out its name."

209
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,256
- The monkeys are gone.
- Good.

210
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,425
- Put it away.
- Wait!

211
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,303
The instructions say if we
finish the game, it'll all go away.

212
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,805
We better do it,
or Aunt Nora's gonna pitch a fit.

213
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:04,434
We should just get through it quickly.
I mean, there's no skill involved.

214
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,815
No, you rolled doubles.
You get another turn.

215
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,442
Roll !

216
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,652
Five.

217
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:22,410
"His fangs are sharp.
He likes your taste.

218
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:26,748
Your party better move
poste haste."

219
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,459
I don't like the sound of that.

220
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:33,463
Judy, someone's in here.

221
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:58,029
It's not real, Peter.
It's a hallucination.

222
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,786
Run, Peter!

223
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,713
I'm back.

224
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,020
Somebody roll
a five or an eight?

225
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,648
He did.

226
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,907
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you !

227
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:54,456
Thank you.
Sorry if I scared you.

228
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,833
Sorry if I scared you.
Thank you.

229
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:00,837
I'm back! Mom! Dad!

230
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,342
I'm home!

231
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,969
I'm back!

232
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:12,265
It's me!
It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad!

233
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,393
I'm home! I'm back.

234
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:19,105
Are you my little sister?

235
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:22,567
No.
I'm Judy and he's Peter.

236
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,236
Where's Mom?
Is Dad at the factory?

237
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:30,033
Are you Alan Parrish?

238
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:33,244
Yeah.
Who are you?

239
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:35,246
We live here now.

240
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:40,418
- Where's my mom and dad?
- We don't know.

241
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:45,131
This house has been empty
for years.

242
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:47,592
Everyone thought you were dead.

243
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,063
Sorry.

244
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,405
- Gimme that description again.
- I said, red fur and long fail.

245
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:21,292
Get down off of my car, please.

246
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,420
And get up on the sidewalk.

247
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:28,466
- What year is it?
- It was brand new.

248
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:32,095
No.
What year is it?

249
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:35,098
- Uh, 1995, remember?
- '95.

250
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,310
You got some l.D.? Oh, let me guess.
You left it in your other Tarzan outfit?

251
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:42,522
- Twenty-six years.
- Are you from around here?

252
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:45,859
I was!
But I've been in Jumanji.

253
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:48,611
Indonesia.
He was in the Peace Corps.

254
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,157
Bentley.

255
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,205
- Carl Bentley, the Soleman.
- Is this man related to you?

256
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:03,460
- Yes, sir. He's our uncle.
- Does he always dress like that?

257
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,171
Well, yeah,
he's a vegetarian.

258
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,423
Get out of there!

259
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,015
Monkeys! Monkeys.

260
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:19,684
Is he all right upstairs?

261
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:23,938
Uh, he suffered a head injury
a few months ago.

262
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:37,118
Hey! Hey-- What?

263
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:40,997
Don't you move!
Freeze! Hey!

264
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:43,041
Don't move. Don't move.

265
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:48,171
- Wait a minute! Where are you going?
- To find my parents!

266
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,383
Come on.

267
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:19,035
Wait!

268
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:16,134
My dad used to
make shoes here.

269
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:19,763
They were the best shoes
in New England.

270
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,434
Hey!

271
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:32,442
Sorry.

272
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:36,488
Easy, girl.

273
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:44,162
Do you know what happened
to this shoe factory?

274
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:50,210
Yeah, it folded up,
like everything else in this town.

275
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:53,797
Hey, it's pretty cold out there.
How 'bout some coffee?

276
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,925
Why would they close
Parrish Shoes?

277
00:36:57,717 --> 00:37:02,138
When his kid ran away, Sam put
all he had into trying to find him.

278
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,224
His time, his money.

279
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:06,309
Everything.

280
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:09,479
After a while,
he stopped comin' to work.

281
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:12,857
He just quit carin'.

282
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:17,070
I don't think anybody
loved his boy more than Sam did.

283
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,824
Here.

284
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:25,203
You're gonna freeze out there.

285
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:30,208
Thank you.
Are the Parrishes still around?

286
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:34,170
- I see 'em now and then.
- Yeah?

287
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,007
They're over on Adams Street.

288
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,111
Our parents are dead too.

289
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,658
They were in the Middle East
negotiating peace when--

290
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,542
Our dad was in advertising.

291
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:18,757
I bet you miss him, huh?
Me too.

292
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,929
There he goes again.

293
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,269
Listen, I know you're upset and all, but
I kinda feel we should finish the game.

294
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,605
We?
Why do you need me?

295
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,691
Just in case any other
scary stuff comes out.

296
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:39,486
Plus, there's a lion in my aunt's
bedroom. What should I do about that?

297
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:43,239
- Do I look like a Ringling Brother?
- But she'll be home soon.

298
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:47,160
Won't she be surprised.
Hope she's not allergic to cats.

299
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:04,928
Larry, we need the wheels.
Gimme a hand.

300
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:06,971
Did we hit her that hard?

301
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:10,058
No, it looks like another one
of those weird bites.

302
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:17,816
It's another one.

303
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:20,860
Geez, that's over 50.
What the hell's goin' on?

304
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:22,195
Easy now.

305
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:25,448
- Hey, look. Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
- Who's that?

306
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:28,827
- The realtor.
- Quiet. Listen.

307
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,413
You hear that?

308
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:35,166
- Hear what?
- Get in the car.

309
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:44,759
Okay, think.
What came out of the game before me?

310
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:49,180
- There was a lion, a bunch of monkeys--
- That!

311
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:54,811
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just a bug.

312
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:58,481
But we're safe in here.
See? We're fine.

313
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:05,655
As long as we stay low, he can't get
through there too far. Don't worry.

314
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,490
We're fine.

315
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:10,618
Hey, he can't get us in here.
He can't get through the glass.

316
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:12,871
We're safe.

317
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:19,878
Either one of you know how to drive?
No? Well, that's no problem.

318
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:25,383
Well, my dad used to let me back
the car down the driveway once.

319
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,510
- So what's the big deal?
- Buckle up.

320
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:30,305
Here we go!

321
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,061
Oh, wait a minute.
What-- Wait.

322
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:42,859
Alan, the top!

323
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,170
Piece of cake.

324
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:05,215
Yeah.

325
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:25,944
Keep that thing away from me!

326
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:28,863
When are you gonna
help us play?

327
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:31,533
We've gotta hurry.
Our aunt's gonna be home soon.

328
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:36,079
Well, good. You can inform her
that she's the ex-owner of this house.

329
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:40,500
I hope you realize, with my parents
gone, this home belongs to me.

330
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:47,048
Oh, thank you.

331
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,050
No more banana leaves.

332
00:41:55,765 --> 00:41:58,977
What do you think those monkeys are
gonna do to the ecosystem around here?

333
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,187
Just sit right back
and you'll hear a tale

334
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,773
- A tale of a fateful trip
- Hello!

335
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:06,735
That started out on this tropic port
aboard this tiny ship

336
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:09,404
The mate was
a mighty sailor man

337
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:11,573
The skipper
brave and sure

338
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:15,994
Five passengers set sail that day
for a three-hour four

339
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:37,182
What happened to you?
You shave with a piece of glass?

340
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:40,060
What happened to you?
The Clampetts have a yard sale?

341
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:43,188
What do you want?
I've never shaved before.

342
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,190
Where are you going?

343
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:50,236
How 'bout Peter and I play,
and you just sort of watch?

344
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,863
No, thanks.
I've seen it.

345
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,034
So if you're not gonna help us,
what are you gonna do?

346
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:59,913
I don't know.
Pretty much take up where I left off.

347
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:02,874
I wonder if Mrs. Nedermeyer's
still teaching sixth grade.

348
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:15,261
Come on, Judy.
He's not gonna help us. He's afraid.

349
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:18,390
What did you say?

350
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:22,185
You're afraid.
It's okay to be afraid.

351
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,233
Let's go set it up
in the living room.

352
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,072
No, you have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

353
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:38,493
Whatever it is, we'll handle it
by ourselves. We don't need your help.

354
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:40,412
I don't think so.

355
00:43:40,453 --> 00:43:45,041
You think monkeys,
mosquitoes and lions are bad?

356
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:48,128
That's just the beginning.

357
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:52,007
I've seen things you've only
seen in your nightmares.

358
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:55,343
Things you can't even imagine.

359
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,846
Things you can't even see.

360
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:02,183
There are things that'll
hunt you in the night.

361
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:06,604
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eat.

362
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,650
And you hope to God
that you're not dessert.

363
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:13,278
Afraid?

364
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:16,531
You don't even know
what afraid is.

365
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:19,451
You will not last
five minutes without me.

366
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:24,414
So are you gonna help us?

367
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,793
I'll watch.

368
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:34,883
But I'm not afraid.

369
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:47,937
Peter, that was very cool.

370
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:52,776
That's reverse psychology.
Dad used to pull it on me all the time.

371
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:56,446
- Ready?
- Yeah.

372
00:44:57,364 --> 00:44:59,032
Alan, ready?

373
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:01,034
There is no "ready."

374
00:45:11,002 --> 00:45:13,088
I'll try it again.

375
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,639
It's not working.

376
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:34,526
Oh, no. It's not your turn.

377
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:36,611
Yeah. I rolled first...

378
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:39,656
and then Peter twice 'cause he got
doubles, and now it's my turn again.

379
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:44,744
No, look. Two of those
pieces are yours, right?

380
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:46,079
Whose are the other pieces?

381
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:51,209
The elephant was mine.

382
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:57,340
You're playing the game
I started in 1969.

383
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:01,428
I'm gonna have to play.

384
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:08,476
It's not my turn.

385
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,478
Whose turn is it?

386
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:16,192
Sarah Whittle.

387
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:26,036
This is where
she used to live.

388
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:29,706
This place gives me the creeps.

389
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:43,219
We used to play
on this porch.

390
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:48,433
I knew she still
wouldn't live here.

391
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:51,227
Probably married Billy Jessup and
they're living in a trailer park.

392
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:54,397
- Let's go.
- Maybe she'll know where Sarah went.

393
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,150
Of course she'll know where Sarah went.
She's a psychic.

394
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:58,693
Good point.

395
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:04,366
- I remember the porch being bigger.
- Hello?

396
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:09,412
- Um, can you help us?
- Do you have an appointment?

397
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,748
No, we're just trying
to find someone.

398
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,919
- Madam Serena can't see you right now.
- Maybe you can help us.

399
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:21,341
What is it?

400
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,551
We're looking for someone
who used to live here.

401
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:26,221
No, I've lived here
my whole life.

402
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:28,807
Well, then you must know
Sarah Whittle.

403
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,772
What do you want
with Sarah Whittle?

404
00:47:40,568 --> 00:47:42,821
No, I don't go
by that name anymore.

405
00:47:46,908 --> 00:47:48,451
What do you want?

406
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:54,874
Twenty-six years ago, you played a game
with a little boy down the street.

407
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:59,504
A game with drums.

408
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:05,427
How do you know that?

409
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:09,973
I was that little boy,
Sarah.

410
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,654
You killed her.

411
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:27,866
Leave a message and the doctor
will call you back...

412
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:30,827
at his earliest convenience.

413
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:32,954
Dr. Boorstein.
Sarah Whittle calling.

414
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,457
If you could call me back
as soon as you can...

415
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,376
I think I need to have
my dosage checked.

416
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,503
That event we've been discussing
for a long time now...

417
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:43,214
the one that
didn't really happen--

418
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:47,218
I'm havin' an episode here with the
little boy that didn't really disappear.

419
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,430
I'm sittin' in his living room
drinkin' lemonade.

420
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:53,808
If you could call me, I'd really
be interested in your interpretation.

421
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:57,562
Thank you so much. He'll call me back
ten minutes before the hour.

422
00:48:57,645 --> 00:49:00,398
- While we're waiting--
- Whoa, God!

423
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:03,068
- Sarah!
- No, no, no, no!

424
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:06,237
- Sarah, please!
- I spent over 2,000 hours in therapy...

425
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:08,406
convincing myself that
that doesn't exist.

426
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:10,450
What happened to you was so awful,
I made up that whole thing.

427
00:49:10,575 --> 00:49:14,496
- Sarah, it was awful. It really was.
- Am I crazy?

428
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:18,333
It was real. Real.

429
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:20,335
No, no, no.
It wasn't real.

430
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:22,837
Your father murdered you and
chopped you up in little pieces.

431
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:27,884
Sarah, come on.
My dad did that?

432
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:31,554
My father could
barely hug me...

433
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:34,015
let alone cut me
into little pieces.

434
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:36,726
Twenty-six years ago...

435
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:39,646
we started playing
a little game.

436
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:43,608
And now we're all
gonna sit down...

437
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,568
and we're
gonna finish it.

438
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:48,738
And guess what?
Your turn.

439
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:56,121
No!

440
00:49:59,874 --> 00:50:01,292
Play the game.

441
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:04,295
- Oh, no, no, no.
- All right.

442
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:10,427
Just gimme the dice and you can go home.
You don't have to play.

443
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,137
Thank you, Alan.

444
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:16,099
Oh, my God!
How could you do that?

445
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:19,561
It's the law of the jungle, Sarah.
You'll get used to it.

446
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:23,773
And I think of all the energy I spent
visualizing you as a radiant spirit.

447
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:25,316
Go on, read it.

448
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:35,994
"They grow much faster than bamboo.
Take care or they'll come after you."

449
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:43,918
- Oh, great.
- Oh, God. Tell me this isn't happening.

450
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:45,920
Oh, it is.

451
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:48,757
Stay away from the walls.
Don't touch anything.

452
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,176
No quick movements.

453
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:59,434
- Wow, they're beautiful.
- Oh, yeah, they're beautiful.

454
00:50:59,517 --> 00:51:02,687
Don't touch the purple ones.
They shoot poisonous barbs.

455
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:04,939
And definitely
stay away from the pods.

456
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:07,108
The big yellow ones.

457
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:09,319
What big yellow ones?

458
00:51:12,697 --> 00:51:14,574
Peter!

459
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:16,785
I got ya!
Get his arms!

460
00:51:16,868 --> 00:51:19,037
Get it off me!

461
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:28,755
Oh, my God!

462
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:37,972
- Hang on, boy.
- Grab him!

463
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,808
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, my God!

464
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:42,852
Sorry, Angus.

465
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:49,317
Whoa. Harvest time!

466
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,160
Are you okay?

467
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,920
Oh, my God!

468
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:13,633
My car.
Oh, my car.

469
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:17,887
Has anybody seen Carl?

470
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:20,640
- I can't believe this. Start. Please.
- Carl, come in please.

471
00:52:24,352 --> 00:52:26,771
- Carl here.
- Where have you been?

472
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:29,232
We've got a serious
animal control situation.

473
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:32,068
You gotta get Stan and Willy on it.
I'm headin' to the old Parrish place...

474
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,320
to check a suspicious character.

475
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,074
I should've been a fireman.

476
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:53,048
Get your hands off me!

477
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:56,468
- The game is not over yet, Sarah.
- It is for me.

478
00:52:56,509 --> 00:53:01,514
You are not in the jungle anymore. Stop
this! You don't treat people like this.

479
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:19,282
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.

480
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:28,333
Alan, please. Last time I played
this game, it ruined my life.

481
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:32,462
It ruined your life?

482
00:53:32,545 --> 00:53:36,841
"In the jungle you must wait,
till the dice read five or eight."

483
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:40,970
I was a little girl, Alan.

484
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:43,973
You disappeared.

485
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:48,645
And a bunch of bats surrounded me
and chased me down the street.

486
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:50,855
I was afraid.

487
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,526
I'm sorry, Alan.

488
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:57,362
No one believed me.
I was all alone.

489
00:53:57,445 --> 00:53:59,364
So was I.

490
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:01,866
For 26 years, Sarah.

491
00:54:03,618 --> 00:54:06,830
Me too.

492
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:10,333
It's okay, Sarah.
We're scared too.

493
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:13,795
But if we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

494
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:17,924
- What if I get stuck in the game?
- You won't.

495
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:22,137
Because I won't stop playing.

496
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,557
- And neither will I.
- I won't either.

497
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,735
- Come on, Sarah.
- Please?

498
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:47,412
I knew this was
gonna be a bad day.

499
00:54:48,913 --> 00:54:51,541
Hey, come on.
We'll be fine.

500
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,710
We just have to
keep our heads.

501
00:54:55,962 --> 00:54:57,464
Roll with the punches.

502
00:55:15,857 --> 00:55:20,779
"A hunter from
the darkest wild...

503
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:24,699
makes you feel
just like a child."

504
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:28,745
- What is it?
- Van Pelt.

505
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:39,464
You miserable coward!
Come back and face me like a man.

506
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:50,016
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.

507
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,394
Coming, ready or not.

508
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,123
Hey, you !

509
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:20,088
Drop your gun and get
your hands in the air!

510
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:48,324
Man, I don't believe this.

511
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:59,336
Even if Alan gets out of this,
the same kind of thing's...

512
00:56:59,377 --> 00:57:01,338
gonna happen over and over again.

513
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:06,634
When you carry around so much anger,
it attracts a lot of negative energy.

514
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:10,347
And things happen, like ending up
in the jungle. That was no accident.

515
00:57:10,388 --> 00:57:13,016
- There are no accidents.
- Whose turn is it?

516
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:16,686
- It's my turn.
- Really? Great.

517
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:19,564
You might have told us there was a man
in there with a rifle that hunts people.

518
00:57:19,647 --> 00:57:22,567
I didn't know, okay?
It's just the roll of the dice.

519
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,111
Is he the reason
you didn't wanna play?

520
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:29,657
You didn't wanna play either...

521
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:33,703
Mr. We-Started-Something-26-Years-Ago-
And-Now-We-Gotta-Finish-It?

522
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:38,833
- What's the deal with you and this guy?
- He's a hunter.

523
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:42,545
He kills things. Right now,
he wants to hunt me and kill me.

524
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:45,090
- Why you?
- Why me? I don't know.

525
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:48,093
Everything about me he finds offensive.
You think it'd be a waste of his time.

526
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:51,763
- Maybe he needs something for his wall.
- It's your turn.

527
00:57:51,846 --> 00:57:54,933
You ever thought about sitting down
and talking about your differences?

528
00:57:55,016 --> 00:57:56,976
What, are you crazy?
The man has a gun.

529
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,270
Don't ever call me crazy, Alan.

530
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:01,940
Ever. 'Cause everyone in this town
has called me crazy...

531
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:04,526
ever since I told the cops
you were sucked into a board game.

532
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:07,946
- Maybe I should roll.
- You know what it's like to be known...

533
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:10,073
as the little girl
who saw Alan Parrish murdered?

534
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:12,617
You think anybody showed up
at my 14th birthday party?

535
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:15,412
- Hello. I'm rolling now.
- Billy who?

536
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:18,957
- I'm gonna roll.
- Are you an owl?

537
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:21,584
- Dig into your higher consciousness...
- Here, just roll.

538
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:24,921
and find the memory
of your old boyfriend.

539
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:28,049
- The kid who stole your bicycle?
- No, the kid who took you to movies.

540
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:30,593
"Don't be fooled.
It isn't thunder.

541
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,721
Staying put
would be a blunder."

542
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:34,723
- No, you're immature.
- You are.

543
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:36,933
I know you are,
but what am I?

544
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:40,228
Do you feel that?

545
00:58:41,312 --> 00:58:42,939
Listen.

546
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:07,964
Run !
It's a stampede!

547
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:11,259
The game!

548
00:59:18,183 --> 00:59:19,351
Don't look back!

549
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:48,004
Not the game!

550
00:59:57,555 --> 01:00:00,141
Why didn't you
grab the game, Peter?

551
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:01,976
Ignore him, honey.
He's a Libra.

552
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,312
- Where are you going?
- He'll head for water!

553
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:10,110
Judy, it's Aunt Nora.
Where have you been?

554
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:13,279
I'm sorry, dear.
You have the wrong number.

555
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:17,450
Wait for me!

556
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,930
- What can I do for you?
- I want a gross of these.

557
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:42,517
You know, they stopped
making these in 1903.

558
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,229
Damn. I shall need
a replacement weapon.

559
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:47,897
There's a waiting period...

560
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:50,025
and you'll have to...

561
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:52,027
fill out these.

562
01:00:53,528 --> 01:00:55,363
Or I could fill these out.

563
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,458
Now, anyone asks,
you didn't get this here.

564
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:13,590
You're not a postal worker,
are you?

565
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:22,474
Quiet.

566
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:35,153
Okay.

567
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:45,330
No!

568
01:02:58,069 --> 01:03:00,697
- Peter, that was great.
- Are you okay?

569
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,324
I can't believe you did that.
That was so cool.

570
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:05,535
- You gave me chills.
- It was great.

571
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:12,917
It's nice work.
Come on, gimme the game. Let's go.

572
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,231
Act natural.

573
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:41,738
- Hey!
- Hide the game.

574
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:50,955
I don't believe this. Every time
there's trouble, I run into you.

575
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,917
Me? I don't know
what you're talking about.

576
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,252
- I'm taking you in for questioning.
- I'm not going anywhere.

577
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:04,803
Just a second.
You can't take him. He's--

578
01:04:04,886 --> 01:04:07,597
- Her fiance.
- I thought he was your uncle.

579
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:11,059
It's all right.
I'll be back soon.

580
01:04:16,314 --> 01:04:17,482
Blast.

581
01:04:17,565 --> 01:04:20,318
Remember you said you'd never
abandon your friends?

582
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:23,405
- We'll finish the game later.
- Later?

583
01:04:25,824 --> 01:04:28,952
I suggest you all
go home now.

584
01:04:28,993 --> 01:04:30,495
Okay.

585
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:38,294
Now how are we supposed
to finish the game?

586
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:40,630
We can't. We can't finish it
without him.

587
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,342
What?

588
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,263
What happened?

589
01:04:48,346 --> 01:04:51,516
I thought I could end the game.
I was only ten spaces away.

590
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,310
"A law of Jumanji
having been broken...

591
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:56,771
you will slip back
even more than your token."

592
01:04:57,939 --> 01:04:59,607
You tried to cheat?

593
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:02,861
No. I tried to drop the dice
so they'd land on 12.

594
01:05:02,944 --> 01:05:05,280
Oh, okay, honey.
Well, that would be cheating.

595
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,701
Peter, your hands!
Look at your hands!

596
01:05:35,977 --> 01:05:37,729
Ray, come in, this is Willie.

597
01:05:37,812 --> 01:05:40,482
They cleaned out Larry's Hardware,
and they're headed for Parrish Common.

598
01:05:40,565 --> 01:05:44,402
I can't stop 'em, Lorraine. You gotta
get the National Guard down here now!

599
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:47,197
What is this about?
I know you know.

600
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,201
Yes, I do, but you wouldn't believe me
even if I told you, Carl.

601
01:05:51,284 --> 01:05:54,746
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?

602
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:56,706
I know a lot more than that.

603
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:59,751
I know you used to work on the
stamping line at Parrish Shoes.

604
01:05:59,834 --> 01:06:01,878
They used to call you
Soleman.

605
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,547
Soleman.
Yeah, that's right.

606
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:08,009
I was in there too, until
old man Parrish fired me.

607
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:10,220
- He fired you?
- Yeah, man.

608
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:13,598
And I had something I could've turned
this whole town around.

609
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:16,101
- Your shoes.
- Right.

610
01:06:16,142 --> 01:06:18,103
Listen, Carl...

611
01:06:19,479 --> 01:06:22,482
I know it doesn't mean much
after 26 years...

612
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:25,735
but I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

613
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:30,573
- Sorry for what?
- It's me, Alan.

614
01:06:34,786 --> 01:06:37,247
Thank you.
Come on.

615
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:41,084
- What's going on?
- Apparently there's a sale happening.

616
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:49,634
You just saw three monkeys
go by on a motorcycle, didn't you?

617
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:51,636
- Yes.
- Good girl. Come on.

618
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:56,391
Maybe we can bail him out
with a check.

619
01:06:56,474 --> 01:06:57,976
Thanks.

620
01:06:58,059 --> 01:07:00,979
You tell that sniveling coward
from me, if he wants--

621
01:08:01,831 --> 01:08:04,709
Give me that, boy!

622
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:09,172
Hey! Help me!

623
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:11,800
Get me outta here!

624
01:08:11,883 --> 01:08:14,719
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Peter. Come on.

625
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:44,332
There it is!

626
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:46,251
Wait here.

627
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,928
Got ya, girlie.

628
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,558
When Alan hears
of your predicament, he'll come.

629
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:05,353
He doesn't know I'm here,
so this isn't gonna work. I'm going.

630
01:09:07,772 --> 01:09:10,775
Don't move or I'll blow
your blinking brains out!

631
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,736
Call the cops!

632
01:09:12,777 --> 01:09:14,779
- That should do it, don't ya think?
- Oh, yeah.

633
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:21,286
Price check.

634
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:28,543
If you let me go,
I can stop all this.

635
01:09:29,836 --> 01:09:32,380
It sounds like something out of the
Twilight Zone, but it's true.

636
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:35,050
Please.
You gotta help me on this.

637
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:36,593
I know I'm gonna regret it.

638
01:09:38,803 --> 01:09:40,722
Just hold still.

639
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:46,853
There. I let you go.
Now what are we gonna do?

640
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:49,481
- You are gonna stay here.
- Those are my keys!

641
01:09:49,564 --> 01:09:51,149
It's for your own good.
You just stay there.

642
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:54,611
- My handcuff keys. Wait.
- This is something I have to do.

643
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:56,905
- Alan !
- You'll thank me someday.

644
01:09:56,988 --> 01:10:01,701
Hostage situation at Sir Sav-a-lot
involving a woman and two children.

645
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:05,163
Sounds like the armed perpetrator in
the pith helmet and khakis you reported.

646
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:08,500
- Carl? Come in, Carl.
- Lorraine, come in. Lorraine!

647
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:10,585
- What's Sir Sav-a-lot?
- It's a discount store.

648
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:13,630
- Move over.
- Wait. Gently.

649
01:10:13,713 --> 01:10:15,465
All right.

650
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:18,051
Don't worry.
I've done this before once.

651
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:45,912
- Where's Sir Sav-a-lot?
- Monroe and Elm.

652
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:48,123
- The Episcopal church.
- No, it's not a church anymore.

653
01:10:48,206 --> 01:10:51,501
Now it's a Speedy Burger, or it was.
I don't know what's left of it.

654
01:10:51,584 --> 01:10:53,169
People in this town
are goin' loopy.

655
01:11:05,765 --> 01:11:07,726
We got company.

656
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:10,687
It's all right.
That's a traffic cop. He'll back us up.

657
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,451
- Here's the game.
- Come on. Get outta here.

658
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:34,938
- Turn the siren off. Right there!
- I got it.

659
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:36,606
Okay!

660
01:12:43,488 --> 01:12:46,449
Stop your cringing.
I could have shot you at any moment.

661
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:47,909
Then why didn't you?

662
01:12:47,992 --> 01:12:50,620
You didn't roll the dice.
Alan did.

663
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:52,997
There it is.
Hit the brakes.

664
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:55,125
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hittin' 'em.

665
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:58,461
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hittin' the brakes!

666
01:12:59,838 --> 01:13:01,840
He should be here any moment.

667
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,364
You're all right?

668
01:13:26,448 --> 01:13:29,159
- Where's Peter?
- I'm here.

669
01:13:31,828 --> 01:13:33,663
Oh, great.

670
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:37,584
So remember...

671
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:41,212
circumstances are never ever
out of your control.

672
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,257
End of tape three.

673
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:49,137
...update on the events unfolding
in Brantford, New Hampshire...

674
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:52,098
where at least 98 people have been
hospitalized with symptoms...

675
01:13:52,182 --> 01:13:54,309
ranging from fevers and rashes...

676
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:56,061
to violent seizures.

677
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:58,772
Local resources have been
strained to the breaking point.

678
01:13:58,855 --> 01:14:02,525
State health officials are asking
anyone experiencing symptoms...

679
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:04,861
to dial 9-1-1.

680
01:14:50,281 --> 01:14:51,908
I got it.

681
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:56,746
Alan, talk to him. Please?

682
01:14:56,788 --> 01:14:59,165
What? We don't have time
for this, okay?

683
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:02,836
I know, but he's a kid
and he was trying to help.

684
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:05,296
- All right.
- Thank you.

685
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,137
I warned you about this,
Peter.

686
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:14,806
No, you wanted
to play the game.

687
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:20,061
What, are you crying? You don't cry,
all right? You keep your chin up.

688
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:22,731
Keep your chin up.

689
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:25,775
Crying never helped anybody
do anything, okay?

690
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:30,280
You have a problem,
you face it like a man.

691
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:41,958
I'm sorry.

692
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:46,254
Twenty-six years buried in the jungle
and I still became my father.

693
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,131
It's okay.
Come here. I'm sorry.

694
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:50,258
Hey.
It's all right.

695
01:15:50,342 --> 01:15:53,345
Remember what you told me?
It's all right to be afraid.

696
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,930
It's not that.

697
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:58,475
What is it?

698
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:12,530
Okay. Ready?

699
01:16:15,992 --> 01:16:20,997
Don't worry. We're gonna have you turned
back into your old self in no time flat.

700
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:23,667
'Cause we're gonna go in here,
and together...

701
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:26,252
we're gonna sit down,
we're gonna finish that game...

702
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:29,339
no matter what.

703
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:44,354
Suddenly, I feel right at home.

704
01:17:16,594 --> 01:17:18,763
Lorraine, this is Carl.

705
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:23,268
I know who's behind this. I'm headin'
to the Parrish place. Gimme backup.

706
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:33,028
Wait!

707
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:35,947
- Now what?
- Stop!

708
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:37,949
Wait, stop!

709
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:42,871
Is there a problem, ma'am?

710
01:17:42,954 --> 01:17:45,623
- Can I have a ride home?
- Where do you live?

711
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:48,710
Jefferson Street.
The old Parrish place.

712
01:17:48,793 --> 01:17:51,296
Do you have children?
A boy and a girl?

713
01:17:51,379 --> 01:17:55,383
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- Get in. I'll explain it on the way.

714
01:18:24,829 --> 01:18:27,457
Fine! Take it!

715
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:29,626
We gotta get to that house.

716
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,801
- Shouldn't we play someplace else?
- No.

717
01:18:37,842 --> 01:18:40,929
I grew up in this.
It's out there that scares me.

718
01:18:42,305 --> 01:18:44,224
Okay, it's my turn.

719
01:18:44,307 --> 01:18:46,434
If you roll a 12, you win.

720
01:18:48,561 --> 01:18:51,147
Okay, ready? Here I go.

721
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:56,695
It's okay.

722
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:59,489
"Every month at the quarter moon...

723
01:18:59,572 --> 01:19:02,200
there'll be a monsoon...

724
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:04,285
in your lagoon."

725
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:07,455
Monsoon.
Well, at least we're inside.

726
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:11,793
Yeah, right.

727
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:36,234
Well, a little rain
never hurt anybody.

728
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:39,195
Yeah, but a lot could kill you.

729
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:51,332
- What do we do now?
- We get to higher ground!

730
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:54,544
- Okay.
- Come on! Stay together!

731
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:11,728
You all right?

732
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:16,941
Alan. What is that?

733
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,780
Swim! Go! Go!

734
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:29,245
Swim fast! Move!

735
01:20:31,998 --> 01:20:34,209
Keep goin'!

736
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:38,797
Get on the table!
Peter, get out of the water!

737
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:45,428
On the chandelier!

738
01:20:53,269 --> 02:41:44,870
Come on, Sarah.

739
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:11,871
Hang on, Sarah !

740
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,793
Are you okay?

741
01:21:30,515 --> 01:21:33,435
Where is he?

742
01:21:42,736 --> 01:21:44,779
- Judy! Peter!

743
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:48,241
Ma'am, step back and let me handle this,
please. It's probably nothing.

744
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:50,368
They probably left the TV
on too loud.

745
01:21:55,248 --> 01:21:57,876
I always wanted to do this.
Could you step back, please?

746
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:19,397
Give me your hand.

747
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,404
- Grab my hand!
- I got it! No!

748
01:22:47,884 --> 01:22:50,595
Take the game.
Here you go.

749
01:22:57,227 --> 01:22:59,145
- You okay?
- Yeah.

750
01:23:04,901 --> 01:23:07,445
Alan, you wrestled
an alligator for me.

751
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:12,117
It was a crocodile.

752
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,079
Alligators don't have
that little fringe on their hind leg.

753
01:23:17,163 --> 01:23:18,790
Come on.

754
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:24,170
My mistake.

755
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:45,608
Come on.

756
01:23:50,905 --> 01:23:53,616
Okay, it's my turn.

757
01:23:53,658 --> 01:23:58,121
I've got it. Colonel Mustard
in the library with a wrench.

758
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:02,959
Clue.

759
01:24:14,846 --> 01:24:18,016
"Beware the ground
on which you stand...

760
01:24:18,099 --> 01:24:20,977
the floor is quicker
than the sand."

761
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:28,651
- Help me.
- Okay. Stay calm.

762
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:29,819
Don't struggle.

763
01:24:29,861 --> 01:24:31,863
- Stay calm.
- I'm calm.

764
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:35,116
- Grab on!
- Pull.

765
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,118
Okay, I got it.

766
01:24:37,202 --> 01:24:38,995
Pull !

767
01:24:42,332 --> 01:24:44,834
Stay calm!

768
01:24:44,959 --> 01:24:46,086
Come on.

769
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,964
Oh, good!

770
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:54,469
I got you.

771
01:24:54,552 --> 01:24:56,846
Stop giving me things
that come apart!

772
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:02,477
- "There is a lesson--"
- All right.

773
01:25:05,313 --> 01:25:07,065
"There is a lesson
you will learn:

774
01:25:08,024 --> 01:25:09,150
I got you.

775
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:14,489
sometimes you must
go back a turn."

776
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:19,577
- Did I hurt you?
- Oh, no.

777
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:21,579
Oh, dear.

778
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:24,749
Oh, thank you, Judy.
Thank you.

779
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:26,543
That was quick thinking.

780
01:25:26,626 --> 01:25:29,421
Sarah and I would like
to get out of the floor...

781
01:25:29,504 --> 01:25:31,423
so it's your turn, Peter.

782
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:33,133
Okay.

783
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,183
I thought I lost you again.

784
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:44,561
Thanks for stickin' around
this time.

785
01:25:50,191 --> 01:25:52,736
"Need a hand
while you just wait...

786
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:56,781
we'll help you out,
we each have eight."

787
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:08,084
- What's that? What is it?
- Nothing.

788
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:09,711
You don't go "Waah!"
for nothing.

789
01:26:12,172 --> 01:26:13,715
- Oh, my.
- Peter!

790
01:26:13,798 --> 01:26:16,760
My dad kept an ax
in the woodshed. Get it.

791
01:26:16,801 --> 01:26:18,928
- Okay.
- Hurry! Go, go, go!

792
01:27:28,623 --> 01:27:31,543
Aunt Nora, it's me, Peter.

793
01:27:35,964 --> 01:27:37,382
Oh, God!

794
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:40,552
Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'll explain later.

795
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:43,054
- What?
- It's your turn.

796
01:27:43,138 --> 01:27:46,057
- You can finish if you roll a 7.
- I can't roll!

797
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:48,893
Put the dice in your mouth--

798
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:51,062
Bring the game!
Hurry!

799
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:08,747
- Judy, are you okay?
- I'm fine. Help them.

800
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:14,753
Come on, Judy.

801
01:28:18,131 --> 01:28:19,591
Gimme the dice!

802
01:28:28,641 --> 01:28:30,685
"You're almost there
with much at stake...

803
01:28:31,644 --> 01:28:33,897
but now the ground
begins to quake."

804
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:39,361
- Oh, my God!
- What?

805
01:28:44,824 --> 01:28:47,577
I wish Mom and Dad were here.

806
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:49,621
So do l.

807
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:03,760
Our only chance is if
we finish the game!

808
01:29:03,802 --> 01:29:05,720
It's your turn !

809
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:07,263
Oh, my God.

810
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:23,905
- Get the game! The game!
- No, I won't let you go!

811
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:54,602
Don't move!

812
01:29:59,065 --> 01:30:00,692
Stand up.

813
01:30:05,697 --> 01:30:07,532
What's in your hand?

814
01:30:10,035 --> 01:30:11,202
Drop it.

815
01:30:21,379 --> 01:30:23,465
End of the line, Sonny Jim.

816
01:30:23,548 --> 01:30:26,301
Game's up.
Stop running.

817
01:30:28,553 --> 01:30:29,679
No.

818
01:30:31,222 --> 01:30:35,018
- Aren't you afraid?
- I'm terrified.

819
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:37,812
But my father told me...

820
01:30:39,022 --> 01:30:41,483
you should always face
what you're afraid of.

821
01:30:46,237 --> 01:30:49,866
Good lad.
You're finally acting like a man.

822
01:30:51,826 --> 01:30:53,203
Any last words?

823
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,590
Jumanji.

824
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:13,014
No, Alan !

825
01:32:42,854 --> 01:32:44,689
Forgot my speech notes.

826
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:52,113
I'm so glad you're back.

827
01:32:52,197 --> 01:32:54,115
I've only been gone
five minutes.

828
01:32:55,992 --> 01:32:58,661
It seems like
a lot longer to me.

829
01:33:00,246 --> 01:33:03,291
I thought you told me you were never
gonna talk to me again.

830
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:09,255
Whatever I said, Dad...

831
01:33:09,381 --> 01:33:11,675
I'm sorry.

832
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:18,181
Look, Alan, I was angry.

833
01:33:18,223 --> 01:33:21,351
I'm sorry too. I'm sorry.

834
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:30,151
You don't have to go to Cliffside
if you don't want to.

835
01:33:33,196 --> 01:33:36,658
Let's talk it over tomorrow,
man-to-man.

836
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:41,329
How about father-to-son?

837
01:33:42,747 --> 01:33:45,417
All right.

838
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,795
Hey, I gotta get going.
I'm the guest of honor.

839
01:33:50,964 --> 01:33:52,424
Dad?

840
01:33:56,428 --> 01:34:00,765
Back in 196--
I mean, today in the factory...

841
01:34:00,849 --> 01:34:03,101
it wasn't
Carl Bentley's fault.

842
01:34:03,184 --> 01:34:06,354
I put the shoe
on the conveyor belt.

843
01:34:08,606 --> 01:34:11,109
I'm glad you told me, son.

844
01:34:11,234 --> 01:34:13,111
Thanks.

845
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:16,197
Bye, Dad.

846
01:34:16,281 --> 01:34:18,199
Good-bye.

847
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:29,961
Holy smokes!
Judy and Peter!

848
01:34:32,213 --> 01:34:34,132
They're not there.

849
01:34:34,215 --> 01:34:37,761
It's 1969.

850
01:34:37,802 --> 01:34:40,430
They don't even exist yet.

851
01:35:10,168 --> 01:35:12,921
I'm starting to forget
what it's like to be a grown-up.

852
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:16,800
That's okay. As long as
we don't forget each other.

853
01:35:16,925 --> 01:35:18,718
Or Judy and Peter.

854
01:35:20,303 --> 01:35:22,889
Alan, there's something
I've been wanting to do...

855
01:35:24,015 --> 01:35:27,644
and I better do it
before I feel too much like a kid.

856
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:50,792
They probably don't teach
driver training in the sixth grade, huh?

857
01:35:52,877 --> 01:35:55,547
God and sinners reconciled

858
01:35:55,547 --> 01:35:56,840
God and sinners reconciled

859
01:35:56,881 --> 01:36:00,927
Joyful all ye nations rise

860
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:05,807
Join the triumph of the skies

861
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:09,686
Merry Christmas.
Want to try one of these?

862
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:13,398
Christ is born in Bethlehem

863
01:36:13,481 --> 01:36:17,027
Hark, The herald angels sing

864
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:20,864
No, Dad. It's a new cross-trainer.
It's doing fabulous.

865
01:36:20,905 --> 01:36:23,575
- It's not a bra. It's a shoe.
- Honey, they're here.

866
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:27,078
Dad, I gotta run. Merry Christmas.
We'll pick you up at the airport.

867
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:30,457
You'll be the best
Christmas gift of all. Bye-bye.

868
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:31,833
- They're here.
- Come on.

869
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:33,335
Let's go.

870
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:37,505
Pardon me.

871
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:40,050
- Jim, glad you could make it.
- Thanks.

872
01:36:40,133 --> 01:36:42,677
- This is my wife, Martha.
- Hi, Martha. This is Sarah.

873
01:36:42,761 --> 01:36:44,888
- Hi, Sarah.
- Where are the kids?

874
01:36:45,764 --> 01:36:47,724
Oh, my God, there they are.

875
01:36:48,933 --> 01:36:50,393
How'd you know?

876
01:36:50,435 --> 01:36:53,897
A guess. A guess, of course.
They're your kids.

877
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:56,066
You're right.
These are our children.

878
01:36:56,191 --> 01:36:59,402
Judy and Peter. Kids, say hi
to Mr. and Mrs. Parrish.

879
01:36:59,527 --> 01:37:02,739
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

880
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:06,951
You're just like
we remembered you.

881
01:37:09,204 --> 01:37:11,748
I feel like we know
so much about them...

882
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,625
because, you know--

883
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:16,127
- You've told Alan so much about them.
- And I told her.

884
01:37:16,211 --> 01:37:18,838
- Yeah.
- I'll go get the presents.

885
01:37:18,922 --> 01:37:20,382
Sure, honey.

886
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:22,425
Well, we love children.

887
01:37:22,467 --> 01:37:25,136
- Merry Christmas.
- Cool !

888
01:37:28,139 --> 01:37:31,184
- When can you start?
- Martha and I were thinking...

889
01:37:31,309 --> 01:37:34,270
of taking a little skiing holiday
up in the Canadian Rockies.

890
01:37:34,354 --> 01:37:35,563
No!

891
01:37:37,857 --> 01:37:38,900
Sorry.

892
01:37:38,983 --> 01:37:41,361
We-- We just--

893
01:37:41,444 --> 01:37:44,572
Need you to get that marketing
done on the new line pronto.

894
01:37:45,532 --> 01:37:48,201
No problem.
I could probably start next week.

895
01:37:48,284 --> 01:37:49,411
That'd be great.

896
01:37:49,494 --> 01:37:53,289
Let me introduce you to the rest of
the folks you'll be working with.

897
01:37:53,331 --> 01:37:55,959
Come on in.
Our house was your house.

898
01:37:56,042 --> 01:37:58,336
Is, anytime you like.

899
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:01,798
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas

900
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:07,095
We wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year

901
01:38:08,221 --> 01:38:10,306
What's that noise?
