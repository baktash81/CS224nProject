00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,177
Can't believe it.
They're right on time.

00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,745
Let's get these boys
to their party.

00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,951

Oh, God, my daughter!

Do the other side?

27
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:04,755
ATF New Orleans,
Agent Donnelly.

28
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:06,640
Listen,
call New Orleans PD.

29
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,343
I want all surveillance
from the Algiers dock.

30
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,628
Then call City Transit.

31
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:13,046
I want the Crescent City
Bridge surveillance,

32
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:14,515
<i>westbound between</i>
<i>10:00 and 11:00.</i>

33
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,665
All right, got it.

34
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:58,926
Hey. Seen an ATF
agent around here?

35
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:00,627
Yeah,
he went down below.

36
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:02,646
How do I get there?

37
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:04,565
The south side
of the bridge.

38
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:14,425
You Agent Minuti?

39
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:16,560
Larry Minuti, ATF?

40
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:19,096
No, Larry's my partner.
I'm Doug Carlin.

41
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:21,215
Paul Pryzwarra, FBI.

42
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:23,334
How you doing?
Where's Minuti?

43
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:24,919
On vacation.

44
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:28,572
Not anymore. We're calling in
half the region on this one.

45
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,424
You can, uh, reach him?

46
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:33,144
I tried. He's not
picking up his phone.

47
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,430
Well, try harder.
It's important.

48
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:37,831
Obviously.

49
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,834
What are you
looking for?

50
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,820
Anything that
doesn't belong.

51
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:48,442
You want to give me a spot?

52
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:50,911
Uh, yeah.

53
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:05,626
ANFO.

54
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:07,545
Ammonium nitrate,
water-soluble.

55
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:10,481
Fuel oil would have burned
off during the blast.

56
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,566
Between the river and the
rain, if ANFO was used,

57
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,134
the only place you'd
find it would be...

58
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,053
Underneath this bridge.

59
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,239
That's right.

60
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,424
We can't rule out an accident
at this point.

61
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:21,708
It's not officially
a crime scene yet.

62
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:22,843
Here's a thought.

63
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:24,277
Why don't we
double the perimeter

64
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:25,946
so we don't have wall-to-wall
trailers down there?

65
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:27,548
No, we're gonna need
all our manpower

66
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,450
for evidence control
and witness processing.

67
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:30,951
Now, we need to keep it tight

68
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:33,186
until we can determine that
it is a crime investigation.

69
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:35,472
It is a crime investigation.

70
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,442
Got a piece of electric blasting
cap and a strand of leg wire.

71
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:42,946
About a million of
those blue particles

72
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:44,782
washed up on
the Algiers side.

73
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,568
It's probably from a plastic
container or a barrel.

74
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:48,936
ANFO?

75
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:50,570
Most likely.
There was post-blast residue

76
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,572
under the Crescent
City Bridge.

77
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:55,375
The insulation on the
leg wire will inform us

78
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:57,611
of who the manufacturer
of the blasting cap is.

79
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,313
Then we go after
the switching mechanism

80
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:00,914
and the bomb's
power source.

81
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:02,633
We probably don't need
to wait for the lab

82
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:04,134
to tell us what
we already know,

83
00:12:04,202 --> 00:12:06,386
that this is an explosive
and a trigger.

84
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:07,855
And you are?

85
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:10,223
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Doug Carlin, ATF.

86
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,009
Who's in charge?
We're working on that now.

87
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:13,227
Gentlemen, please.

88
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,112
Ed Elkins. I'm in charge.

89
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,280
Oh, good, good, good.
Yeah.

90
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:18,115
You're in charge, then?
Okay.

91
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:20,150
First things first.
Where's the coffeepot?

92
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,768
Ed?

93
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,422
Come on, this is a police
investigation, right? Operation.

94
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:26,206
We gotta have a coffeepot.

95
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,092
Yeah, uh, uh,
you'll find it in the back.

96
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,359
Back there?
Yeah.

97
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:31,328
He is in charge.
Thank you, gentlemen.

98
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,153
See anything?

99
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,471
Uh, traffic.

100
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:58,956
Hit rewind for me.

101
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:02,092
Hey, did Larry call?

102
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:03,643
Still not answering his cell.
We left another message.

103
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:04,978
All right.

104
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:06,914
Say, that girl ever get ahold of you?
What girl?

105
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:09,549
You know, sexy voice, asked if you
were tall, dark and handsome.

106
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:11,051
I gave her two out of three.

107
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,336
Two out of three. That's very good.
Hit play.

108
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:14,337
Thank you.

109
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:20,611
Hey, Larry, this is Doug.
How you doing?

110
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,579
Listen, I know you're maybe
still pissed off at me,

111
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:24,548
but you need to get your
behind down here, all right?

112
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:25,899
Doug.
Yeah?

113
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,835
Doug, Orleans Parish on line one.
It's Sheriff Reed.

114
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:30,137
They pulled a body out of the
water, and they want a profile.

115
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:31,872
All right, tell him
they don't need a profile.

116
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,540
Just tell him to bag it.
I'll call him back.

117
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:35,192
Okay, got it.

118
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:38,278
Put this on
a candy wrapper?

119
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:39,563
It's all I had.

120
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:41,648
Cutting back, huh?

121
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:45,202
Hold it right there.

122
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:50,424
Yeah, this is ATF Agent Doug
Carlin returning your call.

123
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:53,760
My cell number
is 504-555-0130.

124
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:55,612
What's that?

125
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,364
Looks like
a dude on a bike.

126
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,333
Run it forward
a little bit.

127
00:14:01,352 --> 00:14:02,586
Stop right there.

128
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,290
What is he doing?

129
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:09,777
Going to the bathroom?

130
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:16,933
Run it forward,
run it forward.

131
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:22,572
What time does it say?

132
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,791
10:47.

133
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,475
That's before the explosion,
isn't it?

134
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,227
Right before.

135
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:31,181
<i>McCREADY: Can I have</i>
<i>your attention, please?</i>

136
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:32,933
<i>Thanks very much for coming.</i>

137
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,902
<i>I'm Jack McCready,</i>
<i>special agent</i>

138
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:37,470
<i>in charge of</i>
<i>this investigation.</i>

139
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:39,656
<i>First, let me say</i>
<i>our hearts go out</i>

140
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:42,159
<i>to all of those</i>
<i>affected by this tragedy.</i>

141
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:46,764
<i>Early estimates place</i>
<i>the number of casualties</i>

142
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:51,685
<i>at 543 men,</i>
<i>women and children.</i>

143
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,471
<i>Now, Lord knows this city</i>
<i>has seen its share of pain,</i>

144
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:56,891
<i>but unlike Katrina,</i>

145
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,493
<i>this disaster was</i>
<i>not an act of nature.</i>

146
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,196
<i>After careful review of evidence
retrieved at the scene,</i>

147
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:07,467
<i>we have concluded this was</i>
<i>a deliberate act of terrorism,</i>

148
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:10,170
<i>and the President concurs</i>
<i>with our assessment.</i>

149
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:12,873
<i>On our end, we have to
ask for your patience,</i>

150
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:14,658
<i>as the investigation</i>
<i>will take time.</i>

151
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:18,612
<i>It's a unique and complicated</i>
<i>crime scene.</i>

152
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,583
<i>There's no baggage checks.
There's no flight data recorder.</i>

153
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,267
<i>There are maximum casualties,</i>

154
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:28,055
<i>and most of the evidence is
under 100 feet of muddy water.</i>

155
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:31,408
<i>There are no shortcuts.</i>

156
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:34,912
Kevin, where's Doug?

157
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,230
You just missed him.

158
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:37,147
Well, his car's still here.

159
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,248
Took the streetcar.

160
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:39,449
What? Streetcar?

161
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:40,884
Hey, don't look at me.

162
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:43,687
It's part of his process.
He says it helps him think.

163
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:50,294
Sheriff Reed.

164
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,963
How you doing?
It's Doug Carlin returning your call.

165
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:56,550
Hey, Doug. I know you got
your hands full right now.

166
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,769
Yeah, that's okay.
What do you got for me, Bob?

167
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:00,871
Well, a couple of kids
found a woman

168
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,873
face down in the waters
off Algiers Point.

169
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,442
She was burned
over 30% of her body.

170
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,178
Right, well, you're gonna see a lot
of that over the next few weeks.

171
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:09,897
We've just set up ECC.

172
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:11,832
Just have Crime Scene
bag it for us.

173
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,467
<i>Well, we already done that.
The body's at the ME's right now.</i>

174
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:16,353
Crime Scene's
already been there?

175
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:17,921
<i>Yeah, they've been and gone.</i>

176
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:21,074
Well, exactly what time did
this woman wash up on shore?

177
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:26,079
Kid called it in
at 10:42 a.m.

178
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:28,632
You mean 11:42, don't you?

179
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,002
No, I mean 10:42.
I got the sheet right in front of me,

180
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,321
and I got my
reading glasses on.

181
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:42,779
Immediately evident is the focal
charring of the limbs and torso.

182
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:48,335
Anterior face, neck and chest
are intact,

183
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:51,271
though swollen from apparent
immersion in water.

184
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:02,048
Hold her hand
for me, will you?

185
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,299
Right here.

186
00:17:04,636 --> 00:17:06,219
There we go.

187
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:09,106
Each digit of the right hand
has been severed

188
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:12,926
between the middle and
distal phalanges. Thanks.

189
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:16,830
Angle of shearing indicates
a single sharp-force trauma,

190
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:18,698
possibly caused
by shrapnel.

191
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:22,402
No. No, it's too even
to be shrapnel trauma.

192
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:26,640
Posterior charring
gives off a strong odor,

193
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:29,642
suggesting perimortem
immersion in burning fuel.

194
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:31,778
Diesel.

195
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:33,847
Accelerant, maybe?
I don't know.

196
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,315
If she was that close
to the bomb,

197
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:37,518
she probably wouldn't
be laying here now.

198
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:40,120
What are you doing?

199
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:43,172
What are you doing?

200
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,575
You got a UV gun?

201
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:46,292
Yeah,
on the table behind you.

202
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:51,047
You see that?

203
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,949
Duct tape.
Mmm-hmm.

204
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,736
What's that stippling?
You see that?

205
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:59,572
Adhesive probably retained some
substance against the water.

206
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,158
Yeah.

207
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,463
Yeah, go ahead.

208
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:09,466
I ran down
those MPRs for you.

209
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:12,819
A Claire Kuchever was reported
missing this morning.

210
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,521
<i>Supposed to pick up her
father from the airport,</i>

211
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:15,822
<i>pulled a no-show.</i>

212
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,023
Okay.

213
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,778
All right, Phil, I want
you to do a full autopsy.

214
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:24,081
Concentrate on
time and cause.

215
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,767
Full spread of lab tests.
Everything.

216
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:31,137
Just pretend like the ferry explosion
never happened today, okay?

217
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:32,673
Absolutely.

218
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:37,310
Claire?

219
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,367
She's beautiful, huh?

220
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:44,501
Yeah.

221
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:45,752
Very.

222
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:20,103
You'll need a photograph for
your investigation, right?

223
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,440
There's plenty in the house.
Plenty to choose from.

224
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:31,130
Mr. Kuchever,
I'm sorry about this,

225
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:37,437
but I'm gonna need you to confirm
your daughter's identity.

226
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,245
Okay.

227
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:49,416
Uh, now, anything
that you can tell me

228
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:52,519
about your daughter's
activities over the weekend,

229
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:55,638
or any time, anything at
all, will be helpful.

230
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:57,474
Well, I don't know.

231
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:59,459
My flight got in
at 8:00 a.m. this morning,

232
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:02,628
and she was supposed to pick
me up, but she wasn't there.

233
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:04,564
I thought maybe
she just overslept,

234
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:07,901
so I took a cab and I went
straight to her house.

235
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,503
Her and Alan's car was gone,

236
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:12,339
so I thought maybe she'd
just finally sold it.

237
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:14,675
Who's Alan?
Her fiance.

238
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:16,459
Or ex-fiance.

239
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:19,096
They broke up
a few months ago.

240
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:20,797
And where is he now, Alan?

241
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:22,432
He moved to Montreal.

242
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:24,134
Okay.

243
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:26,853
She was too good
for him, anyway.

244
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,522
I got a sweater that she left,
if you want to take it.

245
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,541
No, that's okay.
But if you have keys

246
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,627
to her house,
I would appreciate it.

247
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:38,181
Oh, she--she had a date.

248
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:39,983
Last night on the phone,
she told me that

249
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:41,968
she was gonna
meet someone,

250
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:43,369
but she didn't say who.

251
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:45,055
Her friend Beth
set it up.

252
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:46,906
Beth.

253
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:50,260
Beth Walsh. Claire baby-sits her
daughter, Abbey, sometimes.

254
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:51,394
Okay.

255
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,382
Thank you.

256
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:57,350
That's good for now.

257
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:01,271
Somebody'll be in touch.

258
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:05,842
Agent Carlin?

259
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:08,094
Doug.

260
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:10,180
I want you
to take these.

261
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:12,532
Well, that's...

262
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:16,586
Just go through them
when you get a chance.

263
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:17,905
Well, it's really
not necessary.

264
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:19,856
Yes, it is.

265
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:23,426
See, I know how these
things go, Agent Carlin,

266
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:25,678
and I need her
to matter to you.

267
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,027
Monday, 7:48 p.m.</i>

268
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:22,995
<i>Hi, Claire. It's Dad.</i>

269
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:25,298
<i>My flight gets in</i>
<i>at 7:55 tomorrow morning,</i>

270
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:28,801
<i>so don't stay up too late.</i>
<i>Love you. Bye-bye.</i>

271
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:31,921
Tuesday, 9:44 a.m.</i>

272
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:34,140
<i>Claire? Hi, it's Beth.</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

273
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,608
<i>I'm sorry</i>
<i>to call you so early,</i>

274
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:37,177
<i>but you said you were gonna
call me when you got home,</i>

275
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:38,694
<i>and when you didn't,</i>
<i>I started to get worried.</i>

276
00:23:38,762 --> 00:23:41,114
<i>- Beth, is this a joke?</i>
<i>- Oh, hey, hey! No.</i>

277
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:42,899
<i>Like--Like I said, I was just
worried about you, that's all.</i>

278
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:45,218
<i>I can't talk right now. Someone's
here. I'll call you later.</i>

279
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:46,553
<i>Claire...</i>

280
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:52,075
Tuesday, 9:50 a.m.</i>

281
00:23:57,114 --> 00:24:00,767
<i>Tuesday, 10:04 a.m.</i>

282
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:04,871
<i>Claire, it's Dad.</i>
<i>I did say 7:55, didn't I?</i>

283
00:24:04,938 --> 00:24:07,040
<i>I'm here at the airport,</i>
<i>waiting for you.</i>

284
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:10,360
<i>If you're not coming, I hope
you're sending Beth or someone.</i>

285
00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:12,228
<i>Call me.</i>

286
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:17,100
Tuesday, 1:18 p.m.</i>

287
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:20,303
<i>Yeah, this is ATF Agent Doug
Carlin returning your call.</i>

288
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:23,489
<i>My cell number</i>
<i>is 504-555-0130.</i>

289
00:24:34,185 --> 00:24:37,603
<i>WOMAN Tuesday, 1:18 p.m.</i>

290
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:41,040
<i>Yeah, this is ATF Agent Doug
Carlin returning your call.</i>

291
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:44,460
<i>My cell number</i>
<i>is 504-555-0130.</i>

292
00:24:59,393 --> 00:25:02,479
The blast wave initiated
here, hit the bulkhead

293
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:05,214
and propagated fore and aft along
the path of least resistance

294
00:25:05,383 --> 00:25:07,867
until it hits
this access hatch.

295
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:09,885
Uh, and that's where
it gets really bad.

296
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:11,254
<i>The blast wave continues</i>

297
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:13,656
<i>into the engine room,</i>
<i>bursting the fuel tanks.</i>

298
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:16,108
<i>This utility shaft here</i>
<i>acts like a chimney,</i>

299
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:18,711
<i>draws the thermal components</i>
<i>into the engine room,</i>

300
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,898
which ignites the fuel vapor,
causing a secondary explosion

301
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:24,334
of far greater magnitude.

302
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:25,901
Essentially,
the initial device

303
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:27,670
turns the whole ferry
into a bomb

304
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:29,672
and detonates it.

305
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,658
And so our early guess

306
00:25:31,726 --> 00:25:33,976
is that the bomb vehicle
was a minivan or SUV.

307
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:35,644
Possibly red or tan.

308
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:37,113
McCREADY: Make and model?

309
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,949
Take weeks,
maybe months.

310
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:41,184
I got a partial on
the license plate.

311
00:25:43,354 --> 00:25:44,871
Shit.

312
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:47,340
Check all the SUVs and minivans
that are registered in the state.

313
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,059
Anything recently
rented or purchased,

314
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:51,661
anything tied to a theft
or a missing persons report.

315
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:52,946
Agent McCready?
Yeah.

316
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:54,764
Doug Carlin, ATF.

317
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:57,801
Oh, yeah. Oklahoma City.

318
00:25:57,868 --> 00:25:59,919
Right. That's right.

319
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:01,754
This afternoon,
I witnessed an autopsy

320
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:05,609
of a young woman who washed
up off the Poland Wharf.

321
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:09,162
Heavy fuel burns,
traces of PETN on her face.

322
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:13,033
PETN, that's the base explosive
used by domestic terrorists.

323
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,520
She also lost several fingers in
what appeared to be blast damage.

324
00:26:17,588 --> 00:26:19,055
Appeared?

325
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:21,607
That's right. I checked the tide tables
against the position of the blast.

326
00:26:21,675 --> 00:26:24,294
For her to have washed up that
early and that far upriver,

327
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:25,495
she would've had
to have been killed

328
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:27,346
two hours before
the ferry exploded.

329
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:29,232
Before?

330
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:32,952
She died before
the explosion?

331
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:34,770
She died before
the explosion, yeah.

332
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:36,872
Her name is
Claire Kuchever.

333
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,593
She washed up before the
explosion and against the tide.

334
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:42,195
Do you have a scenario?

335
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:43,896
Yes, I do.

336
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:47,167
I believe that somebody abducted
her in her home, taped her mouth,

337
00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:50,070
bound her wrists, burned her
alive, dumped her in the river

338
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:53,339
so she would appear to be
just another disaster victim.

339
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:55,875
A disaster that
hadn't happened yet.

340
00:26:55,942 --> 00:26:58,595
But the PETN tells us

341
00:26:58,663 --> 00:27:01,214
that the bomber came in direct
contact with the victim.

342
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:03,316
You solve her case,
you solve this case.

343
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:05,651
Why this woman?

344
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:08,437
Good question.
Her SUV is missing.

345
00:27:09,673 --> 00:27:12,308
It's a tan and red Bronco.

346
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:16,295
It could have been stolen to
drive the bomb to the ferry.

347
00:27:16,363 --> 00:27:17,613
Oh, one more thing.

348
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:20,616
The victim called
the local ATF office

349
00:27:20,684 --> 00:27:22,986
the morning
of the explosion.

350
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:24,971
Yeah.

351
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:27,022
We'll look into it.

352
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,123
Okay.

353
00:27:29,226 --> 00:27:30,860
All right.

354
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:32,729
Okay.

355
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:44,073
Where's Larry?

356
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,175
What?
Larry Minuti, my partner.

357
00:27:46,243 --> 00:27:49,596
That's his car right there.
Is he here?

358
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:52,165
I thought you said
he was on vacation.

359
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:54,134
Yeah, that's right.

360
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:58,153
What?

361
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:05,428
Those cars were brought here from
the Algiers ferry parking lot.

362
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:08,764
They're the vehicles
that belonged to the victims.

363
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,064
Sorry.

364
00:28:39,897 --> 00:28:41,347
So he's a former Marine?

365
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:43,432
Yes, sir. Yeah. Local, too.

366
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,718
He's born and bred
in New Orleans.

367
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:47,203
His family
still in the area?

368
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,272
Nope. Nothing, really,
but his job.

369
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,423
You like him?

370
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:52,992
He's smart.

371
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,894
Yeah, I like him, too.

372
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:56,513
All right.
Let's go find him.

373
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,190
Oklahoma City.

374
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:28,794
Yeah.

375
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,200
You and Larry were close?

376
00:29:34,268 --> 00:29:35,868
Yeah.

377
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:40,607
Yeah, you know, close enough
to get on each other's nerves.

378
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:44,977
Doug, I've been put in charge of a
newly-formed investigative unit.

379
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:48,848
The ferry disaster is our first
case, and I want you on the team.

380
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,516
Why me?

381
00:29:50,584 --> 00:29:53,385
We've got some unique
time constraints.

382
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:57,857
I need someone who can look at a
crime scene exactly one time,

383
00:29:57,925 --> 00:30:01,127
tell us what's missing, tell
us what shouldn't be there,

384
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:02,528
tell us what
we can ignore

385
00:30:02,596 --> 00:30:05,031
and, especially,
what we need to pursue.

386
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:08,534
Also, you're local. You know the
people and you know the area.

387
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:10,502
But why an ATF guy?

388
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,172
Why not?
It's your shot.

389
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:15,891
You want to find the guy
who killed Minuti, don't you?

390
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:19,928
Yes, I do.

391
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:45,305
I guess you've
got some questions.

392
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:49,142
For me to have questions, first
I'd need to know something.

393
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,155
Now I do have
some questions.

394
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:21,807
Don't touch anything.
We don't need you yet.

395
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,660
Doug, you remember
Dr. Alexander Denny.

396
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,263
Where's my audio?

397
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:29,816
Compensating for audio delay.
Just a second.

398
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:33,703
Oh, compensating for a technical
blunder by a tech guy...

399
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,270
Solid stream.
Minus four days,

400
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:37,840
six hours, three
minutes, 45 seconds.

401
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:40,143
And 14 and
a half nanoseconds.

402
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:42,645
Okay.

403
00:31:42,713 --> 00:31:46,048
Anytime you want to jump
in here, be my guest.

404
00:31:46,116 --> 00:31:47,349
Me?
Yeah.

405
00:31:56,994 --> 00:31:58,444
What are we looking for?

406
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:01,714
You know, clues, suspects,
anything out of the norm.

407
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:03,683
When was this taken?

408
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:04,617
Four and a half
days ago.

409
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:06,986
Gunnars, try the guy
with the backpack.

410
00:32:14,294 --> 00:32:16,028
Oh, that's tender.

411
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:18,398
I wish I had someone.
Okay, widen out.

412
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:21,934
Let's cruise the car deck for
a while, see what we got.

413
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,873
How can you
change the angle

414
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,109
on footage taken
four and a half days ago?

415
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:31,761
This is a digital recreation.

416
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:34,797
We're combining all the data
we've got into one fluid shot.

417
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:37,533
Any angle, any view
within the target area.

418
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:41,604
Okay, um,
let's cruise the breezeway,

419
00:32:41,672 --> 00:32:44,173
see what we get there.

420
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:46,325
It's a brand-new program.
It's called Snow White.

421
00:32:46,393 --> 00:32:48,678
Our primary data comes from
seven orbiting satellites,

422
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:52,415
but at any given time, as many as
four are surveilling one area.

423
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:54,317
It's like having
multiple eyewitnesses,

424
00:32:54,384 --> 00:32:57,186
each with their
own vantage point.

425
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:58,721
Snow White?

426
00:33:03,394 --> 00:33:05,094
Well, which one
of the seven dwarfs

427
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:07,930
can explain to me
how you get the audio?

428
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,754
I don't understand.

429
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:17,707
Why do you gotta
look at four days ago?

430
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:20,526
Why don't you just fast-forward
it to the day of the explosion?

431
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:22,478
We have to wait.
It takes four and a half days

432
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,897
to render this
single fluid shot.

433
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:26,332
The only thing
that matters

434
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,602
is that we have exactly
one look at any one time.

435
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,439
Yeah. We can't go back
10 minutes, you know?

436
00:33:33,507 --> 00:33:36,542
Can't look back and see
if there was a second gunman.

437
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:41,013
We can't watch the agent buying
10 pairs of cargo pants in 1983.

438
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,983
All right?
But given enough lead time,

439
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,418
we can look anywhere within
the target area, all right?

440
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:47,987
It's the when
that's always constant.

441
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:50,389
It's always four days
and six hours ago.

442
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:52,074
Always. You understand?

443
00:33:52,141 --> 00:33:57,579
It's like a single trailing
moment of now, in the past.

444
00:33:57,647 --> 00:34:02,684
Okay. So if--if--if--if you can't
move forward or backward in time,

445
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,703
how is it the image keeps
speeding up like that?

446
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:06,321
It's not the image
that's moving faster,

447
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:08,057
it's just our
shifting point of view.

448
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,558
The passage of time
remains constant,

449
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:10,943
but we can shift
our point of view

450
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:13,512
within the data stream
as fast as we want.

451
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,348
You understand?

452
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:17,483
Yeah. Yeah. No.

453
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:18,901
Yeah, I know.

454
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,769
So four days from...
Well, actually, three days from now,

455
00:34:20,837 --> 00:34:24,173
since it's after midnight,
you'll be able to look back

456
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,975
to the day of the explosion,
see who did it,

457
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:28,210
how they did it
and what they did it with.

458
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:29,545
Yeah, you got it.

459
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:31,447
The only thing is, you need
to tell us where to look,

460
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:35,485
'cause, you know,
we could miss it.

461
00:34:35,552 --> 00:34:38,504
Besides, three days could be
too late. He could leave the country,

462
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:40,255
could strike again.

463
00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:42,774
We need to do
whatever we can now.

464
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:45,060
We know he's out there
planning this.

465
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:47,296
We just don't
know where to look.

466
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:51,150
So, Agent Carlin,
where do we look?

467
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:57,473
Claire Kuchever's house.

468
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,978
Address is in range.

469
00:35:02,045 --> 00:35:04,446
All right, match the viewer
settings to the signal.

470
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:09,785
Signal's solid.

471
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:11,386
All right, dazzle me.

472
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,903
What?

473
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:30,806
You see, with Snow White
we can track through walls.

474
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:32,958
It's part of the same infrared
thermal-imaging stuff

475
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:34,193
they're using in Iraq.

476
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:35,962
<i>Hello. This is 877-504-8423.</i>

477
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:38,080
We triangulate
from four satellites,

478
00:35:38,147 --> 00:35:40,132
pick up the heat signal
and reconstruct.

479
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,384
Basically,
we can walk through walls.

480
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:46,188
Claire Kuchever.

481
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:47,389
<i>Claire? Hello?</i>

482
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:49,025
Did you know her?

483
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:51,727
We held hands once,
but no, I didn't know her.

484
00:35:51,794 --> 00:35:54,713
<i>Just checking in,</i>
<i>wondering how you're doing.</i>

485
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:58,000
<i>Montreal's fantastic,</i>
<i>but my boss is an ass.</i>

486
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,169
Can you, uh, rotate the view,
see what she's looking at?

487
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:01,704
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

488
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:02,921
<i>I want you to</i>
<i>come visit, though.</i>

489
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:05,190
<i>The city's phenomenal.</i>
<i>You're gonna love it.</i>

490
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:07,493
<i>Claire? Claire?</i>

491
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:09,278
555-0118.

492
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:10,880
Somebody got that?
Yeah.

493
00:36:10,948 --> 00:36:13,416
<i>Claire, you there?</i>

494
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:16,569
<i>Listen, I've had-- I've had</i>
<i>a lot of time to think,</i>

495
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,778
<i>and I need you to sell the
Bronco as soon as possible.</i>

496
00:36:31,802 --> 00:36:33,602
<i>Or at least</i>
<i>pay me back my half.</i>

497
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,754
<i>I just really need the money.</i>

498
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:38,324
<i>I love you, honey. Call me.</i>

499
00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:39,825
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

500
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:43,229
Where's she...
Can you follow her?

501
00:36:43,296 --> 00:36:44,897
No problem.

502
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:03,832
Yeah, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

503
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:07,569
What?

504
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:11,340
It's Stalhuth, at that house you found.
Female murder victim, Claire?

505
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:15,928
Right. What do you got?

506
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:18,163
We got some
bloody cotton swabs

507
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:19,764
and gauze strips
in the bathroom,

508
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:21,349
<i>some blood in the sink trap.</i>

509
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:22,968
<i>And, oh, hey, Carlin?</i>

510
00:37:23,036 --> 00:37:24,436
Man, when did
you completely forget

511
00:37:24,504 --> 00:37:26,405
how to investigate
a crime scene?

512
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:27,640
What do you mean?

513
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,141
This place is lousy
with your fingerprints.

514
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:31,293
They're all over the place.

515
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:38,934
Do me a favor.
Just describe

516
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:40,836
what you see for me, okay?
Just humor me.

517
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:45,892
Uh, woman's bedroom.
Vanity mirror.

518
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,978
Dressing table with makeup,
knick-knacks.

519
00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:50,212
Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

520
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:51,296
Is there anybody there?

521
00:37:51,364 --> 00:37:53,298
Anybody brushing their teeth?

522
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:57,803
No. Just a couple agents, including
Hendricks, who's bent over,

523
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,755
and I have a fine view
of the crack of his ass.

524
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:04,009
Okay, I get the picture.
Talk to you later.

525
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:05,978
You satisfied?

526
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:08,363
She was supposed to go on a
date the night before she died.

527
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:09,865
I want to get her
appointment books

528
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:11,466
and everything
brought down here,

529
00:38:11,534 --> 00:38:14,920
you know, her phone records,
credit cards, diaries, anything.

530
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:17,189
I wanna know everything there
is to know about this woman.

531
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:19,342
Well, shouldn't we be
concentrating on the ferry?

532
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:21,727
Well, yeah,
it's likely that our guy

533
00:38:21,795 --> 00:38:26,481
cased the ferry first,
but we don't know when.

534
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:28,217
We don't even know
what he looks like.

535
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:31,220
I mean, we could stare him right
in the face and not know it's him.

536
00:38:31,288 --> 00:38:34,356
But we will notice a change, even
a small change, in her life.

537
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,847
<i>- Hey, Beth.</i>
<i>- Claire.</i>

538
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:44,083
<i>That guy I've been telling you
about really wants to meet you.</i>

539
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:46,518
<i>Okay. Tell him</i>
<i>I'll meet him Monday night.</i>

540
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:48,120
Monday.

541
00:38:48,187 --> 00:38:49,772
<i>How about Sunday</i>
<i>if you're not doing anything?</i>

542
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,439
<i>No, Monday.
Great. I'll give him your number.</i>

543
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:53,208
<i>No, do not give him my number.
I'll go meet him.</i>

544
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:54,827
<i>He's not some psycho killer.
Who? Him who?</i>

545
00:38:54,895 --> 00:38:58,313
<i>I don't even know if I can
do it Monday. Hang on.</i>

546
00:38:58,381 --> 00:38:59,681
Show me the book.

547
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,068
<i>Monday works.</i>

548
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:04,136
Damn!
Shit!

549
00:39:04,203 --> 00:39:05,287
Can we go back?

550
00:39:05,355 --> 00:39:06,722
No.
Seriously?

551
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:09,158
No, it's far too much data for
any existing storage system.

552
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:10,509
It's a constant stream.

553
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:12,178
There's no rewind,
no second chances.

554
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:14,013
We can record what we're
seeing, but we can't go back

555
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,447
and choose to look
at something different.

556
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:17,599
Okay. You said we
can record, though?

557
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:18,901
Yes.
Okay.

558
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:25,006
Tell me,
is there any scientific

559
00:39:25,075 --> 00:39:27,509
or forensic insight
likely to be gained

560
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:30,312
by spying on this woman
in the shower?

561
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,632
Shanti, we're trying to make
sure the woman's clean.

562
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:37,586
All right, why don't you,

563
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:40,756
you know, look around the rest of
the bathroom? Can you do that?

564
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:50,633
Gunnars.

565
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,700
Yeah.

566
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:52,851
You back?
Sorry.

567
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:54,236
All right.

568
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:59,642
Icy Hot, Band-Aids, baby oil.

569
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:01,043
This woman needs a vice.

570
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:02,661
What's on the other
side of that wall?

571
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:03,946
Kitchen.

572
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:06,098
Let's take a look.

573
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:09,835
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

574
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:21,179
Maybe there's someone out there.
Maybe there's a stalker.

575
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:22,932
<i>Someone there?</i>

576
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:26,001
<i>Hey, Ginger.</i>

577
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:31,623
<i>Hello?</i>

578
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:35,844
Does she know I'm here?
Does she know we're here?

579
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:38,430
No, impossible.
Strictly one-way.

580
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,517
You sure?

581
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:42,584
Mmm-hmm.

582
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:53,979
<i>Hello?</i>

583
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:56,898
Okay, let's check
the perimeter.

584
00:41:03,557 --> 00:41:04,790
Nobody.

585
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:08,860
Who's watching her?

586
00:41:09,996 --> 00:41:11,230
We are.

587
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,015
<i>They will also take up
a request for more money for the...</i>

588
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,855
<i>God, thank you</i>
<i>for blessing me</i>

589
00:41:52,922 --> 00:41:54,823
<i>with this food</i>
<i>and with my life.</i>

590
00:41:56,676 --> 00:41:59,278
<i>I know today's</i>
<i>gonna be a great day.</i>

591
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:00,479
<i>Amen.</i>

592
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,352
<i>You guys singing?</i>

593
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:09,054
<i>You singing a love song? Huh?</i>

594
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:11,923
<i>You singing a love song</i>
<i>to one another?</i>

595
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:14,509
<i>What you doing?</i>

596
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,467
<i>Hi.</i>

597
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:48,927
<i>Yeah, it's been a while.</i>

598
00:42:58,337 --> 00:43:01,907
Everything God has done
will remain forever.

599
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:04,043
There is nothing to add to it,

600
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,061
nothing to take from it.

601
00:43:06,129 --> 00:43:09,064
God has done this so that
men should be in awe...

602
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:10,665
Ex didn't show.

603
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:12,134
Would you?

604
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:13,952
Whatever is
has already been,

605
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,388
and what will be
has been before.

606
00:43:17,123 --> 00:43:20,192
God calls forth the past.

607
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:29,068
Claire loved music.

608
00:43:29,135 --> 00:43:31,720
There's a church
near our house,

609
00:43:31,788 --> 00:43:35,173
and gospel fills
the neighborhood.

610
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:39,878
When she was little, Claire saw
a jazz funeral procession.

611
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:42,414
She asked me that day,

612
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:45,166
"Why do they always
wait until the end

613
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:48,637
"to play the good music?"

614
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:54,275
Claire, honey, the music's
playing for you now and forever.

615
00:44:13,296 --> 00:44:15,197
Were there four
limo drivers or five?

616
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:18,350
Four limos.
Must have been four drivers, right?

617
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:22,404
He was here.

618
00:44:27,677 --> 00:44:29,895
Address is in range.

619
00:44:31,214 --> 00:44:32,780
Palace Restaurant.

620
00:44:32,915 --> 00:44:34,816
They got good food there.

621
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:40,772
<i>I'm so sorry
for the wait. I really am.</i>

622
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,324
<i>Listen...</i>

623
00:44:42,392 --> 00:44:43,825
<i>Your table will be</i>
<i>ready in a few minutes.</i>

624
00:44:43,893 --> 00:44:45,443
<i>Drinks are on me,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

625
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:47,512
<i>It is gonna be a few more
minutes for your table...</i>

626
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,447
<i>Go upstairs and see if Table
45 is ready for desserts.</i>

627
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:50,649
<i>- All right?</i>
<i>- I will.</i>

628
00:44:50,716 --> 00:44:53,402
<i>Hold on. Hang on.</i>
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

629
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,637
<i>Hey, are you the lady</i>
<i>with the Bronco for sale?</i>

630
00:44:55,705 --> 00:44:57,272
That's him.
How do you know?

631
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:59,090
That's him.
Well, call up the phone list.

632
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:01,292
Let's see if it's
a number we've tracked.

633
00:45:02,762 --> 00:45:04,930
<i>Yes, that's me.</i>
<i>Just a second.</i>

634
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:06,131
<i>Cover for me,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

635
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:07,833
Keep that tape
running, too.

636
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,602
I'm gonna want a recording of this
conversation for voice analysis.

637
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:12,687
<i>- I'm here. Can you hear me?</i>
<i>- Well, hello, there.</i>

638
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:14,356
<i>Let me tell you, first off,</i>

639
00:45:14,424 --> 00:45:16,441
<i>I'm what you could call</i>
<i>a real motivated buyer.</i>

640
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:17,859
I bet you are.

641
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:19,477
<i>I'm ready to get</i>
<i>something right away.</i>

642
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:21,646
<i>That sounds great.
I need to sell something right away.</i>

643
00:45:21,714 --> 00:45:25,300
<i>Your price looks good,</i>
<i>model, mileage...</i>

644
00:45:25,368 --> 00:45:27,435
<i>So where can I</i>
<i>come by and see it?</i>

645
00:45:27,503 --> 00:45:28,720
Don't tell him.

646
00:45:28,788 --> 00:45:31,606
<i>Um, I'm at 827 Kings Oak,</i>
<i>in the French Quarter.</i>

647
00:45:31,674 --> 00:45:33,542
<i>Need directions?
Now he knows where she lives.</i>

648
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,728
<i>No, no, I'll find you.</i>
<i>Is tomorrow night good?</i>

649
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:39,414
<i>Actually, I...</i>
<i>Tomorrow night is not good.</i>

650
00:45:39,482 --> 00:45:41,132
Tomorrow?
<i>I'm going out tomorrow.</i>

651
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,384
Mmm-hmm. He wants to wait for the last
possible moment to steal her car,

652
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:45,170
then it's too late
to report it.

653
00:45:45,238 --> 00:45:46,554
<i>How does Tuesday sound?</i>

654
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,958
Got it. 504-555-0147.

655
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:51,410
I see it. Tracking.

656
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:53,328
<i>I think that's</i>
<i>gonna be too late.</i>

657
00:45:53,396 --> 00:45:55,280
<i>See, I need the vehicle</i>
<i>Tuesday morning.</i>

658
00:45:55,348 --> 00:45:57,916
<i>Is there anyone else there</i>
<i>that can show me the car?</i>

659
00:45:57,984 --> 00:45:59,651
<i>No. Sorry.</i>
<i>He's thinking.</i>

660
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:01,453
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>
<i>There's a K5 Blazer...</i>

661
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:03,355
A date means somebody's
gonna be expecting her

662
00:46:03,423 --> 00:46:04,906
and will miss her
if she doesn't show up.

663
00:46:04,974 --> 00:46:06,091
That could ruin his plans.

664
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:07,192
Shanti,
I want to see this guy.

665
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,061
No good.
It's an outdoor phone booth.

666
00:46:09,128 --> 00:46:11,296
Three miles out of range.

667
00:46:11,364 --> 00:46:13,114
<i>I hope to hear from you.</i>

668
00:46:13,182 --> 00:46:16,300
Can we get someone out there
with a goggle rig?

669
00:46:18,605 --> 00:46:20,805
What's that do?
Extend the range?

670
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:22,458
Yeah, it's immediate
line of sight.

671
00:46:22,525 --> 00:46:25,243
But we can use it to gather
data outside the target area.

672
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,678
Provided there's
any data to gather.

673
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:28,647
How long is this guy
gonna be at the phone booth?

674
00:46:28,715 --> 00:46:29,848
Not long.

675
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:31,549
<i>Have a good night.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

676
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:32,601
<i>Bye.</i>

677
00:46:33,803 --> 00:46:35,387
<i>Story of my life.</i>

678
00:46:35,455 --> 00:46:37,039
Yeah, story of my life, too.

679
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:39,041
All right, now we heard
the voice of our bomber,

680
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:41,192
now we're gonna go after him
the old-fashioned way.

681
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,244
Can we get video surveillance
on that phone booth?

682
00:46:43,313 --> 00:46:44,579
We can access
all surveillance

683
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:46,548
available to any
government agency.

684
00:46:54,223 --> 00:46:57,175
Okay, this is from the ATM
camera across the street.

685
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:03,598
All right. Let's fast-forward to the
exact time of his phone call to Claire.

686
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:08,637
Where are we
supposed to be looking?

687
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:10,339
Behind the guy
on the left.

688
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:13,458
Can you enhance it,
Gunnars?

689
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:16,761
Not enough for an ID.

690
00:47:19,448 --> 00:47:22,116
Wait, go back.
Can you rewind it just a little bit?

691
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:24,703
Stop. What is that
on the ground?

692
00:47:26,906 --> 00:47:28,974
Looks like
a camcorder bag, maybe.

693
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,408
We have facial
recognition software?

694
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:31,693
Yeah.

695
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:33,411
Let's use it on the bag.

696
00:47:33,479 --> 00:47:35,496
Cross-match it to all the bags
on the south side of the city

697
00:47:35,565 --> 00:47:38,567
in the 48 hours leading up
to the explosion, all right?

698
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,238
Don't think it's
ever been used this way.

699
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:45,540
Yeah, that's kind of a simple
image to go for a match.

700
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:47,492
Well, we got
nowhere else to go.

701
00:47:51,981 --> 00:47:53,265
Look, same bag.

702
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,150
Bingo.

703
00:48:00,907 --> 00:48:02,373
Okay, freeze it.

704
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:07,212
Yeah, looks like the same guy, too.
Where is this?

705
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,698
Security camera
at the Algiers ferry dock.

706
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:11,149
Okay, when is this?

707
00:48:11,217 --> 00:48:13,034
Two nights
before the explosion.

708
00:48:13,102 --> 00:48:15,437
Seven hours from now.

709
00:48:15,471 --> 00:48:17,588
Two nights before the explosion
is seven hours from now?

710
00:48:17,656 --> 00:48:19,524
Seven hours from now,
we will be able

711
00:48:19,591 --> 00:48:21,893
to access this point
in our time window.

712
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:23,361
Gotcha.

713
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:36,174
Kind of creepy, seeing that
lady's life go down in flames.

714
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:38,376
Yep.

715
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:41,379
Makes you
appreciate life.

716
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:44,115
I suggest you go home
and jump on whoever you got.

717
00:48:44,183 --> 00:48:46,918
That's what I'm gonna do.
Nobody home.

718
00:48:46,985 --> 00:48:49,037
How'd you let that happen?

719
00:48:51,007 --> 00:48:52,841
Everything you have,
you lose, right?

720
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:55,076
Mother, father, gone.

721
00:48:55,144 --> 00:48:58,096
Good looks,
Pryzwarra, gone.

722
00:48:58,163 --> 00:48:59,981
Loved ones
gone in a second.

723
00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:02,367
That's what this job
teaches you, doesn't it?

724
00:49:02,435 --> 00:49:04,369
No matter what,

725
00:49:04,437 --> 00:49:08,339
no matter how hard you grab onto
something, you still lose it, right?

726
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:12,477
Well, we're gonna grab onto
this guy in a couple hours.

727
00:49:12,545 --> 00:49:15,080
We're gonna nail
this son of a bitch.

728
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,450
What's wrong?

729
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,872
No matter what,
we still lose her.

730
00:49:26,259 --> 00:49:27,376
Right?

731
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:32,080
<i>...dot-com for
a link to the FEMA Web site.</i>

732
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:34,816
<i>Military helicopters that

<i>Mom asked me to say a prayer for

740
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:54,035
<i>Okay.
Mom is gonna be so mad at me.</i>

741
00:49:54,103 --> 00:49:57,139
<i>She's not gonna be mad at you.
Come on.</i>

742
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:59,041
<i>We'll just say</i>

743
00:49:59,108 --> 00:50:02,544

744
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:06,581
<i>We'll just pray that David
had a good day, all right?</i>

745
00:50:06,649 --> 00:50:08,550
<i>How about this?</i>
<i>You pray for David,</i>

746
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:10,435
<i>and I'll pray</i>
<i>for my mom, okay?</i>

747
00:50:10,503 --> 00:50:12,688
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

748
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:28,669
What's going on?
Give it a second.

749
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:30,338
- Gunnars.
- It's rebooting. It's coming back.

750
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:32,340
Are we online?
Wait.

751
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:33,642
Are we online?
Gunnars!

752
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,527
What the hell's going on?
Shanti, are we back online?

753
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:36,928
I don't know.
Something broached the field.

754
00:50:36,996 --> 00:50:38,196
What broached the field?

755
00:50:38,264 --> 00:50:39,480
That broached the field,
right there.

756
00:50:39,548 --> 00:50:41,016
That broached the field,
right there.

757
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,267
That's what
broached the field.

758
00:50:42,335 --> 00:50:44,419
Now, you wanna tell me
what the hell this thing is?

759
00:50:44,487 --> 00:50:45,937
It's not surveillance, Paul.

760
00:50:45,939 --> 00:50:48,173
It's not
electronic thermal imaging.

761
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,290
You guys have
figured out a way

762
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:50,692
to look into the past.
Yes or no?

763
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,793
No.
You're lying.

764
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,261
You're lying,
and you know it.

765
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:54,428
I've told you
everything I can.

766
00:50:54,496 --> 00:50:57,365
She saw it, Paul.
I pointed this thing at her just now,

767
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:59,918
and she responded to it from
four and a half days ago.

768
00:50:59,985 --> 00:51:02,571
Explain that to me.
All right.

769
00:51:02,638 --> 00:51:04,522
Somebody explain it!

770
00:51:06,242 --> 00:51:07,775
Hit it, Shanti.

771
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:11,229
For three years,
Cambridge has been working

772
00:51:11,297 --> 00:51:13,514
for National Reconnaissance
on an R & D grant.

773
00:51:13,582 --> 00:51:14,849
Okay.

774
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:17,068
We were attempting to use
concentrated bursts of energy

775
00:51:17,136 --> 00:51:19,554
to enhance the sensitivity
of optical telescopes.

776
00:51:19,622 --> 00:51:21,156
In the process,
we had a breakthrough.

777
00:51:21,224 --> 00:51:23,575
Given enough energy, we could
warp the very fabric of space.

778
00:51:23,642 --> 00:51:26,244
I said explain it to me,
not talk science.

779
00:51:26,312 --> 00:51:27,996
They found a way to...
Look, I'll tell you what.

780
00:51:28,064 --> 00:51:30,765
Why don't you guys just keep talking?
I'll just sit here

781
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:33,068
until you figure out what it
is you really wanna tell me.

782
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:36,153
They found a way to fold
space back onto itself.

783
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,326
All right, look. Uh, we're used
to viewing space as flat, right?

784
00:51:42,478 --> 00:51:43,294
- Like this piece of paper.
- Right.

785
00:51:43,362 --> 00:51:44,562
To see something
from a distance,

786
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:45,797
light has always
had to travel

787
00:51:45,865 --> 00:51:47,432
the long way across
the flat space in between.

788
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:49,067
But given what I
was trying to explain,

789
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:51,820
we can fold the space,
bring the target closer to us,

790
00:51:51,887 --> 00:51:53,755
create what's known as
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

791
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:55,223
otherwise known
as a wormhole,

792
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,808
suspend it via
gravitational field.

793
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,226
That's what we're looking at?
That's it.

794
00:51:58,294 --> 00:52:00,262
What's on the other end
of the bridge?

795
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:01,930
Claire's house.

796
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,350
Wow.

797
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:07,052
Basically, we're folding
space in a higher dimension

798
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,004
to create an instantaneous link
between two distant points.

799
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:11,940
Instantaneous?
Well, that's what we hoped for

800
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:14,276
and that's what we expected.
But the electrical force...

801
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:16,878
We used huge amounts of
energy to create this bridge.

802
00:52:16,946 --> 00:52:18,546
All right, how huge?

803
00:52:18,614 --> 00:52:20,314
You remember that little blackout
we had a few years back?

804
00:52:20,382 --> 00:52:21,482
Yes, I do.
New York blamed Canada.

805
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,784
Right.
Canada blamed Michigan.

806
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,836
Half the Northeast.
You're saying you guys...

807
00:52:24,904 --> 00:52:26,888
50 million homes. Right.
My bad.

808
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:28,723
Well, I still say
we blame Canada, but...

809
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,108
Okay, so why can't
I see this bridge?

810
00:52:31,176 --> 00:52:33,611
It's not visible to the human eye.
I mean, it's real, though.

811
00:52:33,678 --> 00:52:34,913
It's just as real
and just as solid

812
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,414
as a cell phone signal
or a radio wave.

813
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:38,817
Right. Well, I don't know
how a cell phone works.

814
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:42,821
I just know how to use it.
So how do we use this?

815
00:52:42,888 --> 00:52:44,305
We can look back
four and a half days.

816
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:45,974
And what,
we can look anywhere?

817
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,292
Limited radius.

818
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,210
Right, right, right.
Looking into the past.

819
00:52:49,278 --> 00:52:51,395
In a sense, we're always
looking in the past.

820
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:54,132
Even light reflected
from yourself in the mirror

821
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:55,700
takes some time
to reflect back.

822
00:52:55,768 --> 00:52:57,301
Let me get this straight.

823
00:52:57,369 --> 00:53:01,089
You're trying to tell me that on
the other side of this bridge

824
00:53:01,156 --> 00:53:03,091
is the actual past?
Yes.

825
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:04,425
- Wow.
- Yeah. But look, look, look.

826
00:53:04,493 --> 00:53:06,611
We created this thing by pure accident.
All right?

827
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:08,313
This--This--This
space and time...

828
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,499
This--This time window
is a complete fluke.

829
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,467
All right? And--And
everybody is terrified

830
00:53:13,535 --> 00:53:15,370
of screwing with it
for fear of losing it

831
00:53:15,437 --> 00:53:17,605
or suffering the consequences
of God knows what,

832
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:19,858
which is why it can only be
used as a retroactive tool...

833
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:21,859
Hey, let me ask you something.
Is she alive or is she dead?

834
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:23,611
You went to her funeral, Doug.
I know that,

835
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:25,013
but I think
the question still applies.

836
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,714
Is she alive
or is she dead?

837
00:53:26,782 --> 00:53:28,850
All right.
Life, like time and space,

838
00:53:28,918 --> 00:53:30,518
is not merely
a local phenomenon.

839
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:31,986
All right!

840
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:35,156
Am I asking a hard question?

841
00:53:35,224 --> 00:53:37,726
Looks like I picked
a bad week to stop snorting hash.

842
00:53:37,793 --> 00:53:39,026
All right,
I tell you what.

843
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:41,229
I'll speak slow,
so those of you

844
00:53:41,297 --> 00:53:43,698
with Ph.D.'s in the room
can understand.

845
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:46,000
It... Here. Look.
Here's a monitor, right?

846
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:52,040
Now the monitor is broken.
It's dead.

847
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:55,977
It is not temporarily transitioned
to another state of entropy.

848
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:57,595
It's dead, right?

849
00:53:57,663 --> 00:54:01,282
Now, is she alive
or is she dead?

850
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,783
She's alive.
All right.

851
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:04,286
Now we're getting somewhere.

852
00:54:04,353 --> 00:54:06,154
All right, now, you said light
could go back. What else?

853
00:54:06,222 --> 00:54:07,505
Nothing.
Something else could be sent back.

854
00:54:07,656 --> 00:54:09,607
Come on, Paul. Something.
What? A body? A human being?

855
00:54:09,675 --> 00:54:11,993
No.
Not a person. Not alive, anyway.

856
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,029
Why not?
Because you can't beat the physics.

857
00:54:14,096 --> 00:54:16,631
The electromagnetic field.
Look, you transition across

858
00:54:16,698 --> 00:54:18,566
what's known as the Wheeler
Boundary, all right?

859
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:20,868
An EM pulse annihilates
all electrical activity.

860
00:54:20,937 --> 00:54:22,938
That's your heartbeat, that's
brainwaves, that's everything.

861
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:25,006
So what? You--You
haven't tried a person?

862
00:54:25,074 --> 00:54:26,457
Let's just say that
we've done enough tests

863
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:28,276
to know that it's
not even possible.

864
00:54:28,343 --> 00:54:29,644
It's not even
theoretically possible.

865
00:54:29,711 --> 00:54:30,945
The hamster goes back, dead.

866
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:32,113
A drosophila fly, dead.

867
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:33,164
What about a radio signal?

868
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:34,582
What about that?
We could send a radio...

869
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:35,917
A radio signal?
Yeah, a radio signal.

870
00:54:35,985 --> 00:54:38,019
Won't work. Electrical.
The field would scramble it.

871
00:54:38,086 --> 00:54:40,238
All right, then a note, a warning note.
No.

872
00:54:40,306 --> 00:54:42,173
A single piece of paper. One sheet.
No.

873
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:43,708
If we keep the mass low...
No!

874
00:54:43,776 --> 00:54:44,793
This could work!
It could work.

875
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,360
Sure. We know where
the guy's gonna be.

876
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:47,712
We can apprehend him
and put him away

877
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,813
before he even
blows up the boat.

878
00:54:48,881 --> 00:54:49,947
And how do we
do that, exactly?

879
00:54:50,015 --> 00:54:51,549
We send it to ourselves!

880
00:54:51,617 --> 00:54:53,985
You send it to me. Yeah, send it to me.
Send it to my office.

881
00:54:54,052 --> 00:54:55,937
Send it to my office
four and a half days ago,

882
00:54:56,005 --> 00:54:59,174
an anonymous tip, and we can capture
this guy before he even meets Claire.

883
00:54:59,241 --> 00:55:01,076
We know he's
gonna be at the dock.

884
00:55:01,143 --> 00:55:02,310
Whatever you did,
you did it already.

885
00:55:02,378 --> 00:55:03,478
Whether you send
this note or you

886
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:05,279
don't send this note,
it doesn't matter.

887
00:55:05,281 --> 00:55:08,583
You cannot change the past.
It's physically impossible.

888
00:55:08,651 --> 00:55:10,835
What if there's
more than physics?

889
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:15,306
Okay.
Something spiritual, right?

890
00:55:15,374 --> 00:55:16,290
Yeah, something spiritual.

891
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:18,042
Okay, okay, okay. Look.

892
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,527
J-Just try to
think of it this way.

893
00:55:19,594 --> 00:55:21,662
God's mind is made up
about this. All right?

894
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,398
I mean, you know, call it fate,
call it destiny, whatever.

895
00:55:24,466 --> 00:55:26,834
But it already happened,
it will keep happening,

896
00:55:26,902 --> 00:55:28,419
and it always will happen.

897
00:55:28,487 --> 00:55:29,337
Maybe.

898
00:55:29,405 --> 00:55:30,571
And why don't
we call it fate,

899
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:32,373
since we're
calling it something?

900
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:34,409
Maybe--Maybe you're right. Maybe you
guys are exactly right. I don't know.

901
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:36,660
All I know is this.
For all of my career,

902
00:55:36,728 --> 00:55:38,379
I've been trying
to catch people

903
00:55:38,446 --> 00:55:39,947
after they do
something horrible.

904
00:55:40,015 --> 00:55:41,549
For once in my life,

905
00:55:41,616 --> 00:55:43,751
I'd like to catch somebody before
they do something horrible.

906
00:55:43,819 --> 00:55:45,853
All right?
Can you understand that?

907
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:52,643
Address is in range.

908
00:55:57,616 --> 00:56:01,019
Two L's.
"Surveilling," two L's.

909
00:56:01,087 --> 00:56:03,755
Since this is such a tremendous
waste of taxpayer money,

910
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:05,439
the least we could do
is get the spelling right.

911
00:56:05,507 --> 00:56:06,858
That's not necessarily true.

912
00:56:06,926 --> 00:56:08,326
Branching universe theory
holds that you can do...

913
00:56:08,393 --> 00:56:09,527
Oh,
branching universe theory.

914
00:56:09,595 --> 00:56:10,678
Look, hold it.
All right.

915
00:56:10,745 --> 00:56:13,031
No, no, no.
I'll show you.

916
00:56:13,098 --> 00:56:14,899
The traditional
view of time is linear,

917
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:18,036
like a river flowing from
the past toward the future.

918
00:56:18,103 --> 00:56:20,221
But you can change
the course of a river, right?

919
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:24,208
Exactly. Introduce a significant enough
event at any point in this river

920
00:56:24,276 --> 00:56:25,927
and you create a new branch,

921
00:56:25,995 --> 00:56:29,381
still flowing toward the future,
but along a different route.

922
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:30,665
Changed.

923
00:56:30,732 --> 00:56:33,034
Yeah, but that river
is the Mississippi,

924
00:56:33,036 --> 00:56:34,985
and we're lobbing what
amounts to a pebble into it.

925
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:36,770
That's a very few
tiny ripples in a kind of

926
00:56:36,922 --> 00:56:38,456
big body of water,
don't you think?

927
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:39,990
Traditionalist.

928
00:56:40,058 --> 00:56:41,726
Say we do create
this new branch.

929
00:56:41,794 --> 00:56:44,279
What happens to the old one?
To--To this one?

930
00:56:44,281 --> 00:56:46,531
Ask the radical.

931
00:56:46,598 --> 00:56:50,284
Well, it might continue
parallel to the new branch,

932
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:52,654
but most likely
it ceases to exist.

933
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:55,072
The idea is,
we cease to exist.

934
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,375
All right?
This version of us, anyway.

935
00:56:58,444 --> 00:57:00,678
You know, we never came here.
We didn't meet Doug.

936
00:57:00,746 --> 00:57:03,297
We don't remember
it ever happening.

937
00:57:03,365 --> 00:57:05,733
Well, that's worth
$10 billion right there.

938
00:57:10,572 --> 00:57:13,390
Would've been a lot faster
if you'd written it yourself.

939
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:15,276
Right. Then I recognize
my own handwriting

940
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:17,645
and the universe blows up.

941
00:57:33,261 --> 00:57:34,612
We're ready.

942
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,281
All right, third floor,
southwest corner.

943
00:57:36,348 --> 00:57:39,467
That's where we are.

944
00:57:39,535 --> 00:57:42,286
<i>- How'd you get that information?
- Good police work.</i>

945
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:43,838
That's me. I can hear me.

946
00:57:43,906 --> 00:57:45,039
<i>I don't wanna play games with you.
Where am I?</i>

947
00:57:45,106 --> 00:57:46,841
<i>I'm not playing games.</i>
<i>Yeah, you are.</i>

948
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:48,076
<i>No, I'm not.
There are protocols... Yeah, you are.</i>

949
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:49,377
There I am.

950
00:57:49,444 --> 00:57:51,145
Is that Minuti?

951
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:52,763
<i>There's procedures...
Yep. That's my partner, Larry.</i>

952
00:57:52,831 --> 00:57:54,665
<i>Look, I know how this job works,
you know how this job works.</i>

953
00:57:54,733 --> 00:57:56,634
Jesus, I forgot
all about this part.

954
00:57:56,702 --> 00:57:59,820
All right, let's find a nice, happy
place to push the note onto.

955
00:57:59,822 --> 00:58:01,656
That your desk?
Yeah, that's my...

956
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:03,608
Okay. Line us up.

957
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:07,228
<i>When I peg a guy on a hunch,</i>
<i>that's good police work,</i>

958
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:10,331
<i>not some conspiracy to keep you
out of the loop, all right?</i>

959
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:11,616
<i>You know what, Doug?</i>

960
00:58:11,684 --> 00:58:12,666
Okay, kid, start pushing.

961
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:14,352
Expand the wave
past the note.

962
00:58:14,419 --> 00:58:15,904
<i>I can't watch your back</i>
<i>if you're holding out on me.</i>

963
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:17,205
<i>Why not?</i>

964
00:58:17,273 --> 00:58:19,140
If my memory serves me right,
we better hurry up,

965
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:20,775
'cause I think
I'm about to leave.

966
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:22,744
- I need more cowbell.
- I'm trying.

967
00:58:22,746 --> 00:58:24,078
<i>Okay, well, I...</i>
<i>Good!</i>

968
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,062
Just give me a second.

969
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:26,230
Don't talk to each other.

970
00:58:26,297 --> 00:58:27,331
Expand.

971
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:29,017
I'm about to leave.

972
00:58:29,084 --> 00:58:30,184
<i>...another partner?
How about that? How about that?</i>

973
00:58:30,252 --> 00:58:31,886
Everybody relax.
<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

974
00:58:31,954 --> 00:58:33,187
Let's go.
I'm working on it.

975
00:58:33,255 --> 00:58:34,989
Prepare for the final
power surge. Ready?

976
00:58:35,056 --> 00:58:36,457
<i>Have a good vacation.</i>

977
00:58:36,524 --> 00:58:38,326
All right. Go, go, go!

978
00:58:39,945 --> 00:58:41,412
<i>Walk away.</i>

979
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:52,840
What the hell happened?

980
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:54,325
I don't know.

981
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:55,926
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Pull it back!

982
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:57,611
Did it go through?
I don't know! I don't know!

983
00:58:57,679 --> 00:58:58,763
Pull it back.

984
00:59:07,122 --> 00:59:08,973
There it is.
It went through.

985
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:10,408
That's right.
It's through.

986
00:59:10,475 --> 00:59:11,859
- It went through!
- Great.

987
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:13,327
Whoa, whoa.
No, wait a minute. Hang on.

988
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:15,596
It ain't great yet.
I don't come back.

989
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:33,230
Put it down, Larry.
I'm not coming back.

990
00:59:41,489 --> 00:59:43,291
Put it down, Larry.

991
00:59:44,409 --> 00:59:46,176
Larry, don't do it.

992
00:59:47,446 --> 00:59:49,213
Follow him.
I'm on him.

993
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:12,886
All right, look, let's... You know what?
Let's cut away from Minuti.

994
01:00:12,954 --> 01:00:14,288
The bomber's on
his way to the dock.

995
01:00:14,356 --> 01:00:15,822
He's due there any minute.

996
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,710
We'll come back to Minuti when
he gets there, all right?

997
01:00:22,197 --> 01:00:23,631
All right.

998
01:00:24,366 --> 01:00:26,183
Okay, where is he?

999
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:31,822
Can we, uh, circle it?

1000
01:00:35,894 --> 01:00:38,462
We should be able
to see him by now.

1001
01:00:46,105 --> 01:00:48,006
That's him.
There he is. All right.

1002
01:00:48,073 --> 01:00:49,823
- Holy shit.
- All right.

1003
01:00:49,825 --> 01:00:50,675
Move in on him real close.

1004
01:00:50,742 --> 01:00:52,293
I want to see his...
That's him.

1005
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:53,611
That's him.

1006
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,481
That's our guy.
That's him.

1007
01:00:56,548 --> 01:00:58,115
At the bridge,
the cemetery, the ATM.

1008
01:00:58,183 --> 01:00:59,300
That's our guy.

1009
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:01,585
Shanti, see if you can get
an ID, facial ID on him.

1010
01:01:01,653 --> 01:01:02,553
Give me some time.

1011
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,422
Okay. All right.
Take your time.

1012
01:01:08,143 --> 01:01:09,076
There's your partner.

1013
01:01:09,227 --> 01:01:10,378
I see him.

1014
01:01:10,446 --> 01:01:11,813
Try to move in
on his truck.

1015
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,664
See if we can
get a plate.

1016
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:16,617
No plate.
Get back on him.

1017
01:01:20,806 --> 01:01:22,272
Stay on him.

1018
01:01:27,129 --> 01:01:28,445
Where's Minuti?

1019
01:01:28,513 --> 01:01:30,848
<i>Federal agent!</i>
<i>Turn the engine off!</i>

1020
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:33,400
<i>Turn the engine off!</i>

1021
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,784
Tilt back down.

1022
01:01:51,836 --> 01:01:53,671
He's still breathing.

1023
01:02:09,788 --> 01:02:11,522
What can we do?

1024
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:13,324
I don't know what to do.

1025
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,430
He's traveling east.
He's traveling out of range.

1026
01:02:19,497 --> 01:02:21,432
Okay, what can we do? Anything?
I don't know,

1027
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:24,117
but if we don't do something
fast, I'm gonna lose this guy.

1028
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:25,853
We're losing the signal.

1029
01:02:25,971 --> 01:02:27,054
We have to boost the signal.

1030
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:29,390
We need to chase him
with the goggle rig.

1031
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:31,225
Yeah, well, Gunnars is
a little busy right now,

1032
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,411
and he's the only one
who can use it.

1033
01:02:35,264 --> 01:02:36,714
Where is it?
What, the rig? It's...

1034
01:02:36,782 --> 01:02:38,449
Yeah, the rig.
Where is it?

1035
01:02:38,517 --> 01:02:40,267
It's in his--
It's in his Hummer.

1036
01:02:43,372 --> 01:02:45,256
Keys in there?
Yeah.

1037
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,518
All right, quiet,
everybody. It's him.

1038
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:15,119
Carlin.

1039
01:03:15,187 --> 01:03:16,504
Where's he now?

1040
01:03:16,571 --> 01:03:17,989
Is he going east?

1041
01:03:19,775 --> 01:03:20,858
Yes.

1042
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:23,493
Okay, he's going east,
going up on De Gaulle.

1043
01:03:23,561 --> 01:03:26,781
All right, just try to keep him in
sight, and keep feeding me directions.

1044
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:29,750
I'll try and track him
with this goggle rig.

1045
01:03:29,868 --> 01:03:30,734
Can he do that?

1046
01:03:30,802 --> 01:03:31,868
Yeah, if he can
catch up to the image

1047
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:34,555
and keep him in sight,
that could work.

1048
01:03:37,726 --> 01:03:39,477
Hey, how do you
turn this thing on?

1049
01:03:39,544 --> 01:03:42,263
There's an on-off button
on the back of the rig.

1050
01:03:42,414 --> 01:03:43,997
Okay, I see it.

1051
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:46,283
It's really simple. Wherever you look,
the eyepiece will auto-focus,

1052
01:03:46,351 --> 01:03:48,702
and we'll see what you see.

1053
01:03:52,574 --> 01:03:54,024
Okay, you're live.
You're on.

1054
01:03:54,092 --> 01:03:56,593
<i>Try the goggles.
Hang on, hang on.</i>

1055
01:04:00,682 --> 01:04:01,965
He's gone.
Out of range.

1056
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:03,166
What?

1057
01:04:03,301 --> 01:04:04,368
Where's he headed?

1058
01:04:04,436 --> 01:04:05,970
<i>He's headed toward the I-10.</i>

1059
01:04:06,038 --> 01:04:08,055
East or west?

1060
01:04:08,123 --> 01:04:10,173
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1061
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:12,076
East or west?

1062
01:04:12,143 --> 01:04:13,961
We lost the signal.
We're blind in here.

1063
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:14,745
<i>I don't know.</i>

1064
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:16,313
All right, hang on.

1065
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,967
Oh, shit!

1066
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:25,339
What? What happened?
What happened?

1067
01:04:30,228 --> 01:04:32,579
This is trippy.

1068
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:33,681
Doug, look straight ahead.

1069
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:35,332
We've got the window slaved
to your goggles.

1070
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,386
We are seeing what you're
seeing four days in the past.

1071
01:04:39,854 --> 01:04:42,039
Okay, I got him. I got him.
He's back in range.

1072
01:04:42,107 --> 01:04:43,507
He's going west, not east,

1073
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:45,375
<i>on the Crescent City Bridge.</i>

1074
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:51,632
There he is.
That's him. Opposite lane.

1075
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:53,267
I got him.
That's him. That's him.

1076
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:54,618
I got him!

1077
01:04:56,154 --> 01:04:57,754
Watch the traffic.

1078
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:07,865
What was that?

1079
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:09,066
I think he hit something.

1080
01:05:12,337 --> 01:05:16,123
Doug, you've gotta stay with him.
You're gonna lose him again.

1081
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:17,675
Doug, what's happening?

1082
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:24,498
I got him! I got him.

1083
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,551
All right,
all right, all right.

1084
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:29,887
Good.
Now stay with him.

1085
01:05:29,954 --> 01:05:32,689
Send paramedics
to the Crescent City Bridge.

1086
01:05:32,757 --> 01:05:34,225
Got that?

1087
01:05:36,995 --> 01:05:38,228
I lost him.

1088
01:05:47,623 --> 01:05:49,923
- I got him! I got him!
- All right. All right.

1089
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:51,492
That's him.

1090
01:05:51,543 --> 01:05:53,527
He's headed for
the 10 to the bayou.

1091
01:06:13,465 --> 01:06:16,350
I can see him.
He's right in front of me.

1092
01:06:25,427 --> 01:06:26,927
Carlin!

1093
01:06:26,995 --> 01:06:28,746
What was that?
What the hell was that?

1094
01:06:28,813 --> 01:06:30,331
Doug, are you all right?

1095
01:06:33,868 --> 01:06:35,085
<i>Doug!</i>

1096
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:37,070
Doug?

1097
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:41,175
I think it's broken.
I can't see anything.

1098
01:06:41,243 --> 01:06:44,561
We still have a signal here.
You're still transmitting.

1099
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:45,813
You can see?

1100
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:47,214
We'll talk you through it.

1101
01:06:47,281 --> 01:06:49,183
Can you still drive?

1102
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,734
Yeah, yeah.
Where is he?

1103
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:54,121
Give us a 360
with the goggle rig.

1104
01:06:54,189 --> 01:06:57,007
There! There he is!
Pan the thing around.

1105
01:06:57,074 --> 01:06:58,893
Which way?
<i>To your right.</i>

1106
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,377
To your right.

1107
01:07:01,613 --> 01:07:03,414
There! There he is!

1108
01:07:03,482 --> 01:07:04,948
He's taking
the road to the bayou!

1109
01:07:05,016 --> 01:07:06,634
Right there?

1110
01:07:06,702 --> 01:07:08,318
The road is blocked.

1111
01:07:08,386 --> 01:07:09,987
Take the expressway.
It parallels the road.

1112
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:11,539
Go. Go, go!

1113
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:26,420
See him?

1114
01:07:26,488 --> 01:07:27,888
Pan right. Pan right!

1115
01:07:28,756 --> 01:07:30,658
You still see him?

1116
01:07:30,725 --> 01:07:32,259
He's at the end
of the bridge.

1117
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:34,845
You hear me?
He's at the end of the bridge.

1118
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:41,218
Keep talking to me.

1119
01:07:41,285 --> 01:07:42,202
I don't know what else
to tell you.

1120
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,238
I feel very, very close
to you right now.

1121
01:07:45,173 --> 01:07:47,324
He took the exit
ramp beneath you.

1122
01:07:47,391 --> 01:07:48,725
Take the next off-ramp.

1123
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:50,677
Take the next off-ramp!

1124
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:55,782
All right,
I'm on the off-ramp.

1125
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:57,651
Go right,
then double back on yourself.

1126
01:07:57,719 --> 01:07:59,286
All right, I got it.

1127
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:04,108
All right,
take another right.

1128
01:08:09,347 --> 01:08:11,665
Still see him?

1129
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:14,184
He's heading to the bayou.
Take a left here.

1130
01:08:20,275 --> 01:08:21,842
Good, good, good.

1131
01:08:21,909 --> 01:08:23,777
<i>Take it easy, Doug.</i>
<i>He's dead ahead of you.</i>

1132
01:08:23,845 --> 01:08:25,312
Okay, okay, okay.

1133
01:08:32,137 --> 01:08:34,922
He's slowing down, coming to a fence.
Do you see it?

1134
01:08:38,192 --> 01:08:39,727
Yeah, I see it.

1135
01:08:54,526 --> 01:08:56,426
<i>Doug, if you're gonna leave
the Hummer, take the backpack.</i>

1136
01:08:56,494 --> 01:08:58,629
<i>It's the power</i>
<i>source for the rig.</i>

1137
01:09:26,357 --> 01:09:28,108
Can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1138
01:09:28,175 --> 01:09:30,494
Yeah, we can hear you.
We can hear you.

1139
01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:31,662
All right.

1140
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,590
What's he doing now?

1141
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:49,280
He's pulled around
the back of the building.

1142
01:09:53,001 --> 01:09:54,952
Looks like a bomb went off.

1143
01:09:55,019 --> 01:09:58,805
Really? We--We see
an intact structure here.

1144
01:09:59,641 --> 01:10:01,091
No damage?

1145
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:02,659
<i>No, none.</i>

1146
01:10:04,478 --> 01:10:06,680
Looks like
a vehicle's inside.

1147
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:08,698
An ambulance.
You see that?

1148
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:11,735
No. Nothing.

1149
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:37,510
See anything?

1150
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:39,679
He's dead ahead of you.

1151
01:10:39,748 --> 01:10:41,732
Doug, he's pulling Minuti
out of the car.

1152
01:10:41,799 --> 01:10:43,033
Where?

1153
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:45,001
All right, now pan to the right.
Pan to the right.

1154
01:10:45,069 --> 01:10:46,337
- More right.
- You got him.

1155
01:10:46,404 --> 01:10:48,154
Yeah, he's dragging
him out of the car.

1156
01:10:48,156 --> 01:10:49,389
Do you see him?

1157
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:52,009
Yeah.
Yes. Right in front of you.

1158
01:10:52,076 --> 01:10:53,727
Boost the audio for me.

1159
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:55,596
Audio boosted.

1160
01:10:55,663 --> 01:10:59,065
<i>Turn around.</i>
<i>Turn around behind you.</i>

1161
01:10:59,133 --> 01:11:01,635
Larry?
<i>Pan back to the right.</i>

1162
01:11:01,703 --> 01:11:03,153
You've got him now.
<i>Where is he?</i>

1163
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:05,222
He's being
dragged on the concrete.

1164
01:11:07,975 --> 01:11:09,209
Larry!

1165
01:11:13,682 --> 01:11:15,365
What's that sound?

1166
01:11:16,284 --> 01:11:18,518
<i>What's the sound?</i>

1167
01:11:18,586 --> 01:11:22,739
He's pouring some kind of
accelerant over Agent Minuti.

1168
01:11:22,807 --> 01:11:26,193
I think it's the diesel fuel,
like at the ferry.

1169
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,020
He's waking up.

1170
01:11:37,022 --> 01:11:40,173
Brace yourselves. I think you're
about to witness a murder.

1171
01:12:53,547 --> 01:12:55,449
If we hadn't sent him there,
he wouldn't be dead now.

1172
01:12:55,516 --> 01:12:58,401
No, he was already dead from the ferry.
We just changed how he died.

1173
01:12:58,469 --> 01:12:59,602
We don't know that.

1174
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,337
He could've been standing
right next to you,

1175
01:13:01,405 --> 01:13:02,823
right until we
sent that note.

1176
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:04,508
<i>You'd need a branching
multiple universe for that to happen.</i>

1177
01:13:04,575 --> 01:13:07,694
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>We can't change anything.</i>

1178
01:13:07,696 --> 01:13:08,979
We didn't change anything.

1179
01:13:09,046 --> 01:13:10,914
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1180
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:13,499
I'll tell you what we did.

1181
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:16,903
The suspect used a stolen
Blazer to case the dock.

1182
01:13:16,971 --> 01:13:18,772
So now he has
a truck big enough

1183
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,474
to drive a bomb
onto the ferry.

1184
01:13:21,542 --> 01:13:24,194
<i>Now Larry shows up, right?</i>

1185
01:13:24,262 --> 01:13:26,997
Larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield.

1186
01:13:27,064 --> 01:13:28,164
You want a mask?

1187
01:13:28,232 --> 01:13:29,666
No. No, I'm good, thanks.

1188
01:13:29,734 --> 01:13:31,802
Larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield,

1189
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:33,203
<i>leaves blood all</i>
<i>over the back seat,</i>

1190
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,238
<i>so now our bomber</i>
<i>needs a new truck,</i>

1191
01:13:35,306 --> 01:13:37,891
you understand?
Claire's truck.

1192
01:13:39,794 --> 01:13:41,178
<i>You hungry?</i>

1193
01:13:41,246 --> 01:13:42,346
Yeah, we changed one thing,

1194
01:13:42,413 --> 01:13:45,048
but by changing one thing,
we didn't change anything.

1195
01:13:45,116 --> 01:13:46,850
<i>What's on TV?</i>

1196
01:14:23,854 --> 01:14:25,272
Hey, hey, hey,
we got a name.

1197
01:14:25,339 --> 01:14:27,457
- Carroll Oerstadt.
- What?

1198
01:14:27,525 --> 01:14:28,442
Who is that?

1199
01:14:28,509 --> 01:14:30,610
Owner of that
bait camp Doug found.

1200
01:14:30,678 --> 01:14:33,614
Truck registration,
airboat registration, match.

1201
01:14:33,681 --> 01:14:34,915
And another property.

1202
01:14:34,983 --> 01:14:37,818
5874 Mullie Ave.,
Ninth Ward, New Orleans.

1203
01:14:37,885 --> 01:14:40,287
Is this a he or a she?
It's a he. Let's go.

1204
01:15:14,321 --> 01:15:15,638
Clear!

1205
01:15:43,901 --> 01:15:46,803
<i>Testing,</i>
<i>one, two, three, four.</i>

1206
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:50,773
<i>Testing,</i>
<i>one, two, three, four.</i>

1207
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:55,445
<i>ATF New Orleans, conducting
interview with Carroll Oerstadt.</i>

1208
01:15:55,513 --> 01:15:57,196
<i>You've waived your right</i>
<i>to counsel, right?</i>

1209
01:15:57,264 --> 01:16:00,183
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

1210
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:04,504
<i>I'm fascinated</i>
<i>with your precision.</i>

1211
01:16:04,572 --> 01:16:07,357
It's not very often we see that
level of expertise around here,

1212
01:16:07,424 --> 01:16:09,876
and if it's all right with you,
I'd like to use this interview

1213
01:16:09,944 --> 01:16:13,630
to educate my colleagues
in law enforcement.

1214
01:16:13,697 --> 01:16:14,848
Yes, sir.

1215
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:16,783
Good. Good.

1216
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:17,900
Let's talk about motive.

1217
01:16:17,968 --> 01:16:21,622
Why would you use explosives
against the US Navy?

1218
01:16:23,023 --> 01:16:25,925
Correction, sir.
US Government.

1219
01:16:25,993 --> 01:16:28,094
US Government.

1220
01:16:28,162 --> 01:16:31,481
It says here that you tried
to enlist in the Marines.

1221
01:16:31,549 --> 01:16:33,416
You were rejected.
You tried to enlist in the Army,

1222
01:16:33,484 --> 01:16:35,468
you were rejected again.

1223
01:16:35,536 --> 01:16:37,920
Why do you think
they did that?

1224
01:16:39,423 --> 01:16:42,359
Because they
don't want patriots.

1225
01:16:42,427 --> 01:16:46,046
The military no longer recognizes
commitment and purpose.

1226
01:16:46,114 --> 01:16:50,951
They thought I was overcommitted
and psychologically unstable.

1227
01:16:51,018 --> 01:16:53,269
They didn't want to
understand my value.

1228
01:16:53,337 --> 01:16:55,589
They understand it now.

1229
01:16:55,656 --> 01:16:57,624
I believe so. Yes, sir.

1230
01:17:01,245 --> 01:17:03,497
You're ATF, right?
Yes, I am.

1231
01:17:04,532 --> 01:17:05,882
Got a smoke?

1232
01:17:05,949 --> 01:17:07,016
No, I don't.
But I can get you one.

1233
01:17:07,084 --> 01:17:08,668
Would you like one?
Yes.

1234
01:17:08,736 --> 01:17:11,487
Okay. Anything you want to
say, just talk into the mike.

1235
01:17:11,555 --> 01:17:14,791
A man can always use more
alcohol, tobacco and firearms.

1236
01:17:14,859 --> 01:17:16,927
I can think of
one more thing.

1237
01:17:20,681 --> 01:17:22,766
<i>It's like the Revolutionary
War, you know what I mean?</i>

1238
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:26,636
<i>"One man's terrorist is another
man's patriot," isn't it?</i>

1239
01:17:26,704 --> 01:17:28,805
<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- Exactly.</i>

1240
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:30,490
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>You get it.</i>

1241
01:17:32,576 --> 01:17:34,294
This wasn't about revenge.

1242
01:17:34,362 --> 01:17:35,628
What was it about?

1243
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,300
Destiny.

1244
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:41,434
Destiny?

1245
01:17:42,803 --> 01:17:44,320
You've been asking me
about my motives.

1246
01:17:44,389 --> 01:17:46,089
Right. Right.
My methods.

1247
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:49,543
They're all connected.

1248
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:51,344
Everything's connected.

1249
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:53,580
Okay. How was Claire
Kuchever connected?

1250
01:17:53,648 --> 01:17:55,248
I needed a car.

1251
01:17:55,316 --> 01:17:56,732
And that's it?
No, well, something

1252
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,885
that couldn't be traced back to me.
Right.

1253
01:17:58,953 --> 01:18:02,288
I had one ready till
that cop showed up.

1254
01:18:02,356 --> 01:18:05,025
That cop was a federal agent.

1255
01:18:05,092 --> 01:18:07,527
Lawrence Minuti.
My partner. You shot him.

1256
01:18:07,595 --> 01:18:10,547
He... I was about to burn him
and he was waking up, you know?

1257
01:18:10,614 --> 01:18:12,432
I mean, I'm not cruel.

1258
01:18:14,735 --> 01:18:19,205
Well, why didn't you "do that"
for Claire Kuchever?

1259
01:18:20,575 --> 01:18:26,062
Well, because I needed her
to look like a ferry victim,

1260
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:27,647
and a bullet
would've given it away.

1261
01:18:27,714 --> 01:18:28,932
I see.

1262
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,985
I went to her house on the
pretense of buying her car.

1263
01:18:32,053 --> 01:18:33,836
I took her from behind,
taped her mouth

1264
01:18:33,904 --> 01:18:35,472
and threw
a hood over her head.

1265
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:36,706
Then?

1266
01:18:36,774 --> 01:18:37,957
<i>I bound her wrists</i>
<i>and her ankles</i>

1267
01:18:38,025 --> 01:18:39,526
<i>and I drove her</i>
<i>back to my place.</i>

1268
01:18:39,594 --> 01:18:41,377
<i>I loaded</i>
<i>the device into her car</i>

1269
01:18:41,445 --> 01:18:43,129
<i>and then I soaked her</i>
<i>with the gasoline.</i>

1270
01:18:43,197 --> 01:18:44,431
Jesus.

1271
01:18:44,498 --> 01:18:45,582
And?

1272
01:18:45,649 --> 01:18:47,217
I think you know
what happened after that.

1273
01:18:47,284 --> 01:18:49,085
No, I don't know. I want you to tell me.
You gotta talk.

1274
01:18:49,153 --> 01:18:51,370
I mean, you know, come on, hero.
What happened after that?

1275
01:18:51,438 --> 01:18:52,538
I'll tell you what
happened after that.

1276
01:18:52,606 --> 01:18:56,042
You killed 543 people.
How do you feel about that?

1277
01:19:01,065 --> 01:19:04,817
I think that you were a murderer
right from the beginning.

1278
01:19:07,288 --> 01:19:10,890
Sometimes a little human
collateral is the cost of freedom.

1279
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,842
To me, those people
were war casualties,

1280
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:14,945
<i>but to you,</i>
<i>they're just evidence.</i>

1281
01:19:15,012 --> 01:19:17,380
That'll do. We got him.

1282
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:18,681
<i>What'd you say?</i>

1283
01:19:18,749 --> 01:19:20,901
You think you know
what's coming?

1284
01:19:20,968 --> 01:19:22,618
You don't have a clue.

1285
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,821
I know where you're going.

1286
01:19:24,889 --> 01:19:29,492
I know you're gonna be away
for a long time. I know that.

1287
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,294
This case will
never even go to trial.

1288
01:19:31,361 --> 01:19:32,428
No?

1289
01:19:32,496 --> 01:19:33,529
Uh-uh.

1290
01:19:33,597 --> 01:19:34,798
'Cause I seen what's coming.

1291
01:19:34,865 --> 01:19:36,666
Did... Have you? What?

1292
01:19:37,401 --> 01:19:38,935
What is in this glass?

1293
01:19:39,003 --> 01:19:40,603
You've seen
what's coming, huh?

1294
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:43,673
Okay, what's coming?
You tell me.

1295
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:46,442
I told you earlier
I have a destiny,

1296
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:48,545
a purpose.

1297
01:19:48,612 --> 01:19:52,182
Satan reasons like man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1298
01:19:52,249 --> 01:19:54,367
Well, I prostrate
myself before a world

1299
01:19:54,434 --> 01:19:56,703
that's going to hell
in a handbag,

1300
01:19:56,771 --> 01:20:00,089
'cause in all eternity, I am
here and I will be remembered.

1301
01:20:00,157 --> 01:20:02,308
That's destiny.

1302
01:20:02,376 --> 01:20:04,527
A bomb has a destiny,

1303
01:20:04,595 --> 01:20:07,680
a predetermined fate set by
the hand of its creator.

1304
01:20:07,748 --> 01:20:11,167
And anyone who tries to alter
that destiny will be destroyed.

1305
01:20:11,235 --> 01:20:14,638
Anyone who tries to stop it from
happening will cause it to happen.

1306
01:20:14,705 --> 01:20:16,789
And that's what
you don't understand.

1307
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:19,008
We're not here to coexist.

1308
01:20:19,076 --> 01:20:20,844
I'm here to win.

1309
01:20:20,911 --> 01:20:23,780
So you'd better have some
divine intervention, buddy.

1310
01:20:24,648 --> 01:20:26,833
You're gonna need it.

1311
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,752
You'd better
have some K-Y.

1312
01:20:28,819 --> 01:20:30,554
You're gonna need it.

1313
01:20:42,449 --> 01:20:44,518
What am I supposed to do?

1314
01:20:45,936 --> 01:20:47,387
We're shutting you down.

1315
01:20:47,538 --> 01:20:48,688
What?

1316
01:20:48,756 --> 01:20:49,956
Yeah, we got what we need.

1317
01:20:50,023 --> 01:20:52,275
The forensics, the suspect,
a confession. We're done.

1318
01:20:52,342 --> 01:20:55,879
Sir, perhaps we should continue
and watch the actual crime.

1319
01:20:55,946 --> 01:20:57,497
The ferry bombing.
Right. He's right.

1320
01:20:57,648 --> 01:20:59,816
I mean, we--we can't just
go on the confession alone.

1321
01:20:59,883 --> 01:21:01,017
We need an airtight case.

1322
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:02,585
We need to collect
more evidence.

1323
01:21:02,653 --> 01:21:04,537
Well, collecting evidence
would've been fine, Agent Carly.

1324
01:21:04,605 --> 01:21:05,738
You took it
a little further than that.

1325
01:21:05,806 --> 01:21:07,207
Agent Carlin. Carlin.

1326
01:21:07,274 --> 01:21:08,508
My name is Carlin, not Carly.

1327
01:21:08,626 --> 01:21:09,759
We had protocols in place.

1328
01:21:09,827 --> 01:21:11,227
There's strict protocols.

1329
01:21:11,328 --> 01:21:13,963
And then you had to push it,
and now an agent's dead.

1330
01:21:14,031 --> 01:21:16,483
Sir, by one theory,
that already happened.

1331
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,934
We're done.
Power it down.

1332
01:21:18,002 --> 01:21:20,236
Pack it up.
On to the next case.

1333
01:21:20,303 --> 01:21:22,572
What about Claire?
What...

1334
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,591
Lookit, charging Oerstadt
in the Kuchever murder

1335
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:26,176
is gonna raise
too many questions

1336
01:21:26,243 --> 01:21:27,376
about how we
obtained the evidence.

1337
01:21:27,444 --> 01:21:28,878
I understand that, sir,
but what about Claire?

1338
01:21:28,946 --> 01:21:30,312
Are we just
gonna drop the case?

1339
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,298
We got him on
the ferry bombing,

1340
01:21:31,365 --> 01:21:32,865
we got him on
killing a federal agent.

1341
01:21:32,933 --> 01:21:35,068
That's enough to get him the needle.
I cannot accept that, sir.

1342
01:21:35,136 --> 01:21:37,737
Well, you know, I don't give a
rat's ass what you can accept.

1343
01:21:37,805 --> 01:21:40,340
She doesn't matter.
He's gonna kill her.

1344
01:21:40,408 --> 01:21:41,874
In 12 hours,
he's gonna kill her.

1345
01:21:42,076 --> 01:21:44,060
He killed her four days ago.

1346
01:21:44,062 --> 01:21:46,829
You were at the funeral.
What's wrong with you?

1347
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:52,151
It had to happen.

1348
01:21:52,219 --> 01:21:56,389
I delayed turning in my report
till we caught the guy.

1349
01:21:56,457 --> 01:21:58,607
Hey, mission accomplished.

1350
01:21:58,675 --> 01:22:00,610
This is a victory, Doug.

1351
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:10,770
Hey. Now, my job
is closure.

1352
01:22:10,837 --> 01:22:13,406
Your job is to help
facilitate that closure.

1353
01:22:13,474 --> 01:22:15,775
Then you tell me,
what do I tell her father?

1354
01:22:15,842 --> 01:22:17,944
We caught the son of a bitch.

1355
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:19,245
We can't save the victims.

1356
01:22:19,313 --> 01:22:22,899
It's not our job to make
the relatives feel better.

1357
01:22:22,901 --> 01:22:28,121
We lose everything that we care about.
Those are your words.

1358
01:22:28,189 --> 01:22:31,190
Doug, it's not your fault
that Claire dies.

1359
01:22:33,727 --> 01:22:35,594
Yeah, that's one theory.

1360
01:22:40,117 --> 01:22:43,285
<i>Lieutenant Junior</i>
<i>Grade Dianne Kerry.</i>

1361
01:22:43,353 --> 01:22:45,237
<i>Martin Kyle.</i>

1362
01:22:46,407 --> 01:22:49,575
<i>Commander</i>
<i>Francis Lacey, retired.</i>

1363
01:22:49,643 --> 01:22:52,645
<i>Elaine Lacey.</i>

1364
01:22:52,713 --> 01:22:55,264
<i>Chief Petty Officer</i>
<i>Darren McAndrews.</i>

1365
01:22:56,017 --> 01:22:58,167
<i>Lorraine McAndrews.</i>

1366
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:02,772
<i>Electronics Technician</i>
<i>Lisa Melville.</i>

1367
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,675
<i>Chaplain Rabbi</i>
<i>Benjamin Mendelsson.</i>

1368
01:24:22,552 --> 01:24:24,454
Denny? It's Doug.

1369
01:24:24,456 --> 01:24:27,690
Well, I can't say
I wasn't expecting this call.

1370
01:24:27,758 --> 01:24:30,326
Look, you know what happens
if you try this.

1371
01:24:30,394 --> 01:24:32,028
We both know
what happens if I don't.

1372
01:24:32,096 --> 01:24:34,664
Well, not a lot of
guinea pigs volunteer

1373
01:24:34,731 --> 01:24:36,465
to die in the name
of science.

1374
01:24:36,533 --> 01:24:38,067
Well, then we have
to make sure

1375
01:24:38,135 --> 01:24:40,436
I end up somewhere
besides the morgue.

1376
01:24:41,071 --> 01:24:42,572
Can you help me?

1377
01:24:47,043 --> 01:24:49,261
I'll see you
when you get here.

1378
01:24:50,831 --> 01:24:51,815
Doug?

1379
01:24:57,938 --> 01:25:02,942
Do me a favor.
When you finish, turn off the lights.

1380
01:25:23,497 --> 01:25:27,100
You do that one more time, you set
off every alarm in the joint.

1381
01:25:31,255 --> 01:25:32,421
Can't take it.

1382
01:25:32,489 --> 01:25:34,157
Gotta keep the mass
as low as possible.

1383
01:25:34,225 --> 01:25:36,276
You gotta take
everything off.

1384
01:25:41,682 --> 01:25:44,133
You can keep
your underwear on.

1385
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:45,668
Thank you very much.

1386
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:49,672
Thought you said you didn't
believe in changing the past.

1387
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:52,408
Right. Well, I also
believe in God.

1388
01:25:52,476 --> 01:25:53,909
Just don't tell anyone.

1389
01:25:54,078 --> 01:25:56,412
I'm gonna tell everybody.
Yeah?

1390
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,048
You know, when I open up the
throttle on this thing...

1391
01:25:59,116 --> 01:26:02,969
Yeah, I know. EM field, flatline.
I got it.

1392
01:26:03,036 --> 01:26:05,805
Thing of it is, no matter
how clever we think we are,

1393
01:26:05,873 --> 01:26:08,475
the most probable outcome
of our little experiment

1394
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:09,742
is that four
and a half days ago

1395
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:12,311
you get a call from
the coroner's office.

1396
01:26:12,379 --> 01:26:14,581
"Hey, Agent Carlin,
I want you to come down here.

1397
01:26:14,648 --> 01:26:16,532
"There's something
you should see."

1398
01:26:16,599 --> 01:26:19,518
And next thing you know,
you're standing over a corpse

1399
01:26:19,586 --> 01:26:21,420
and it's you.

1400
01:26:21,488 --> 01:26:26,842
Well, you can be wrong a million times.
You only gotta be right once.

1401
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:29,195
Besides, I think I'd remember
if that happened, right?

1402
01:26:29,262 --> 01:26:31,564
So I gotta face out
toward you?

1403
01:26:31,632 --> 01:26:34,266
Yeah, face out.
Just like the note, only bigger.

1404
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:37,170
You ready?

1405
01:26:37,238 --> 01:26:38,204
No.

1406
01:26:39,223 --> 01:26:41,490
You don't have to do this.

1407
01:26:43,243 --> 01:26:45,227
What if I already have?

1408
01:26:45,829 --> 01:26:47,080
Right.

1409
01:27:00,394 --> 01:27:01,494
Doug?

1410
01:27:03,497 --> 01:27:04,697
<i>Doug?</i>

1411
01:27:04,765 --> 01:27:07,617
Hey. Hello?

1412
01:27:07,685 --> 01:27:09,736
You okay in there?
<i>Yeah.</i>

1413
01:27:09,803 --> 01:27:11,554
You good?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

1414
01:27:11,622 --> 01:27:14,389
I'm beside myself.

1415
01:27:17,144 --> 01:27:18,745
<i>Am I still here?</i>

1416
01:27:18,812 --> 01:27:20,179
For now. You ready?

1417
01:27:20,246 --> 01:27:21,948
<i>Yeah, I'm ready.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

1418
01:27:22,115 --> 01:27:23,916
<i>Looking forward to walking
up to you four days ago</i>

1419
01:27:23,984 --> 01:27:25,201
<i>and blowing</i>
<i>your mind, though.</i>

1420
01:27:25,268 --> 01:27:26,586
Well, if that happens,
maybe you can tell me

1421
01:27:26,653 --> 01:27:28,053
what it's like to
meet your younger self.

1422
01:27:28,121 --> 01:27:30,223
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I'll let you know.</i>

1423
01:27:30,225 --> 01:27:32,208
All right, remember,
the ferry blows

1424
01:27:32,275 --> 01:27:34,994
at 10:50 on Fat Tuesday,
okay?

1425
01:27:35,795 --> 01:27:36,812
<i>Yeah.</i>

1426
01:27:38,081 --> 01:27:39,382
Here we go.

1427
01:27:40,667 --> 01:27:41,784
See you yesterday.

1428
01:27:41,852 --> 01:27:43,302
God willing.

1429
01:28:08,012 --> 01:28:09,445
<i>Good, good.</i>

1430
01:28:09,512 --> 01:28:10,562
<i>- You don't have to do this.</i>
<i>- Hello?</i>

1431
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:12,030
<i>Maybe I already have.</i>

1432
01:28:12,098 --> 01:28:13,449
<i>Maybe I already have.</i>

1433
01:28:16,486 --> 01:28:18,254
- What the hell?
- All right, hold on, everybody.

1434
01:28:18,322 --> 01:28:21,441
The reserve generators
should kick in. Nobody move.

1435
01:28:21,508 --> 01:28:23,359
That was interesting.

1436
01:28:26,913 --> 01:28:28,514
Doctor!
Who the hell is that?

1437
01:28:28,582 --> 01:28:31,684
Where'd he come from?

1438
01:28:31,752 --> 01:28:35,220
All right, let's get him into Trauma.
Trauma 2, Trauma 2!

1439
01:28:40,476 --> 01:28:42,011
This is weird.

1440
01:28:43,863 --> 01:28:45,881
Defib.
Clear!

1441
01:28:45,949 --> 01:28:47,783
Recharge it again.

1442
01:28:48,402 --> 01:28:50,302
Clear!

1443
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:52,271
Recharge to 300.
Charging.

1444
01:28:52,439 --> 01:28:53,673
Clear!

1445
01:28:55,358 --> 01:29:00,063
Resume CPR. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1446
01:29:26,206 --> 01:29:27,823
<i>...thirty-four degrees.</i>

1447
01:29:27,891 --> 01:29:30,309
<i>Forty-nine was our low
temperature at the airport.</i>

1448
01:29:30,377 --> 01:29:33,779
<i>Gonna be at that or just maybe
above that for tonight.</i>

1449
01:29:33,847 --> 01:29:34,963
<i>Let me show you why.</i>

1450
01:29:35,031 --> 01:29:36,548
<i>Look,</i>
<i>the winds are starting...</i>

1451
01:29:55,419 --> 01:29:57,153
...a few of them
come back.

1452
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,421
I'm thinking about
getting a tattoo.

1453
01:30:00,424 --> 01:30:01,624
Whoa!
I'm a federal agent.

1454
01:30:01,626 --> 01:30:03,859
I need your keys.
I need a vehicle.

1455
01:30:03,927 --> 01:30:05,811
There's keys
in the truck there.

1456
01:30:05,879 --> 01:30:07,963
Which one? Right here?
Put your hands down.

1457
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:11,149
Hands on the table.
Hold your donut. Hands right there.

1458
01:30:13,069 --> 01:30:14,087
Water it.

1459
01:30:36,093 --> 01:30:38,961
<i>This might be a
metaphor for existence itself.</i>

1460
01:30:39,028 --> 01:30:41,497
<i>A fish</i>
<i>struggles instinctively</i>

1461
01:30:41,565 --> 01:30:44,516
<i>against an almost</i>
<i>formless antagonist.</i>

1462
01:30:44,584 --> 01:30:46,585
<i>The fish is</i>
<i>a largemouth bass.</i>

1463
01:31:00,934 --> 01:31:03,168
<i>Here's the news at 8:30.</i>

1464
01:31:03,236 --> 01:31:06,055
<i>Federal officials are still
baffled by the massive blackout</i>

1465
01:31:06,122 --> 01:31:07,973
<i>that darkened</i>
<i>the entire eastern half</i>

1466
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:10,042
<i>of the country</i>
<i>early this morning.</i>

1467
01:33:05,124 --> 01:33:06,358
Hey!

1468
01:34:28,224 --> 01:34:29,875
Jesus.

1469
01:34:35,999 --> 01:34:38,934
Wait a minute.
Hey, it's okay. Wait a minute!

1470
01:34:39,002 --> 01:34:40,852
Listen. Claire!

1471
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,723
I'm a federal agent.
Hang on, hang on.

1472
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:46,258
All right, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

1473
01:34:46,326 --> 01:34:48,927
I'm a federal agent.
It's okay. It's okay.

1474
01:34:50,196 --> 01:34:51,897
You're safe.
You're all right, okay?

1475
01:34:51,965 --> 01:34:54,049
I'm a federal agent.
You're safe.

1476
01:34:54,117 --> 01:34:56,151
You're safe.
Look at me. Come here.

1477
01:34:56,218 --> 01:34:58,703
You're safe.
He's gone. All right?

1478
01:35:00,957 --> 01:35:02,158
Get me out of here!

1479
01:35:02,225 --> 01:35:03,392
All right. All right.

1480
01:35:03,459 --> 01:35:05,594
Get me out of here!

1481
01:35:05,662 --> 01:35:09,215
It's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

1482
01:35:10,784 --> 01:35:11,950
Get me out of here.

1483
01:35:12,018 --> 01:35:13,518
All right,
let me get your feet.

1484
01:35:13,586 --> 01:35:16,405
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

1485
01:35:19,092 --> 01:35:21,576
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

1486
01:35:21,645 --> 01:35:24,263
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1487
01:35:24,331 --> 01:35:25,847
All right.

1488
01:35:40,247 --> 01:35:43,282
How'd you know there'd
be keys in this truck?

1489
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:46,101
That's a good question.
I didn't know.

1490
01:35:49,522 --> 01:35:51,640
He's a terrorist?
Yeah.

1491
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:54,159
His name is
Carroll Oerstadt.

1492
01:35:54,227 --> 01:35:56,228
I'm a part of a special
surveillance unit.

1493
01:35:56,296 --> 01:35:57,913
We've been tracking him.

1494
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:02,283
He's planning on blowing up the
Canal Street Ferry today at 10:50.

1495
01:36:05,722 --> 01:36:07,089
So we're going
to the police?

1496
01:36:07,156 --> 01:36:08,874
No, it's too complicated.

1497
01:36:08,942 --> 01:36:10,809
By the time we get them up to
speed, the ferry will be gone.

1498
01:36:10,877 --> 01:36:12,578
We gotta go straight
to the Algiers dock.

1499
01:36:12,645 --> 01:36:13,845
I don't think
you're gonna make it.

1500
01:36:13,913 --> 01:36:15,448
You're losing
too much blood.

1501
01:36:15,482 --> 01:36:17,183
No, I gotta make it.
I only got an hour and 40 minutes

1502
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:18,667
to catch up to this guy.

1503
01:36:18,735 --> 01:36:22,204
What if you don't make it?
What happens then?

1504
01:36:22,271 --> 01:36:24,223
If I don't make it...

1505
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:27,626
What?

1506
01:36:28,694 --> 01:36:29,895
Your house is on the way.

1507
01:36:29,963 --> 01:36:31,563
We'll go by your house,
and I'll get cleaned up.

1508
01:36:31,765 --> 01:36:33,682
I'll drop you off.
All right?

1509
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:35,584
All right.

1510
01:36:36,519 --> 01:36:38,104
Hey, Ginger.

1511
01:36:38,871 --> 01:36:40,789
She hates strangers.

1512
01:36:40,857 --> 01:36:42,257
You need anything?

1513
01:36:42,325 --> 01:36:44,226
You get cleaned up.
I'll take care of this.

1514
01:36:44,293 --> 01:36:45,678
You sure?
I could bind that for you.

1515
01:36:45,745 --> 01:36:47,796
No, I'm sure.
You go ahead.

1516
01:36:47,863 --> 01:36:50,232
I'm gonna need to borrow one of
your boyfriend's jackets, though.

1517
01:36:50,299 --> 01:36:51,567
Sure.

1518
01:37:38,748 --> 01:37:40,932
Hey, uh, listen.

1519
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,284
You shouldn't wear that.

1520
01:37:42,352 --> 01:37:44,352
What?

1521
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:45,821
Why don't you put on
a different one?

1522
01:37:45,889 --> 01:37:49,124
The blue and white one.
Anything. It's just...

1523
01:37:49,191 --> 01:37:50,759
Just trust me.

1524
01:37:50,827 --> 01:37:54,480
The victim wore a dress like
that and it wouldn't be good.

1525
01:37:55,998 --> 01:37:58,333
Okay.
Trust me.

1526
01:37:58,401 --> 01:38:02,754
All right, uh, I--I'll go change.
I'll be right out.

1527
01:38:13,166 --> 01:38:15,100
Stop right there!
Don't move!

1528
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:17,319
Don't move.
I'm calling the police.

1529
01:38:17,386 --> 01:38:19,037
I am the police.
No, you're not.

1530
01:38:19,105 --> 01:38:20,772
Yes, I am.
No, you're not!

1531
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:21,857
You didn't ask me
any questions.

1532
01:38:21,924 --> 01:38:23,392
You didn't take
a statement.

1533
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:27,145
And you knew where my house
was, what's in my closet.

1534
01:38:27,213 --> 01:38:28,697
Who are you?

1535
01:38:28,765 --> 01:38:31,116
I'm Doug Carlin.
I'm an ATF agent.

1536
01:38:31,184 --> 01:38:33,919
I'm part of a special surveillance
unit that's been tracking the man

1537
01:38:33,986 --> 01:38:35,754
who was trying to kill you.
How do I know that?

1538
01:38:35,821 --> 01:38:37,522
I had a hood over my head.
You could be him.

1539
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:38,674
Just think about it, Claire.

1540
01:38:38,741 --> 01:38:40,375
Look at my face.
You scratched the man's face.

1541
01:38:40,443 --> 01:38:42,127
Do I have a scratch
on my face?

1542
01:38:42,195 --> 01:38:44,313
You scratched him,
didn't you?

1543
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:46,147
Get on the floor.

1544
01:38:47,249 --> 01:38:49,067
Now! Get on the floor!

1545
01:38:52,055 --> 01:38:53,606
All the way!

1546
01:38:56,826 --> 01:38:58,960
ATF New Orleans,
Agent Donnelly.

1547
01:38:59,028 --> 01:39:03,231
Yes, is there an Agent Douglas
Carlin working out of that branch?

1548
01:39:03,299 --> 01:39:06,201
<i>Yes, there is,</i>
<i>but he's not here right now.</i>

1549
01:39:06,269 --> 01:39:08,119
Would you like to
leave a message?

1550
01:39:08,187 --> 01:39:10,138
Can you describe
him for me, please?

1551
01:39:10,206 --> 01:39:12,707
How tall, skin color.

1552
01:39:12,775 --> 01:39:17,779
I don't know. He's 6'3",
black, not bad-looking.

1553
01:39:20,516 --> 01:39:23,084
Okay, have him call me back

1554
01:39:23,152 --> 01:39:26,672
at 877-504-8423.

1555
01:39:26,739 --> 01:39:28,473
Okay, wait.
My phone pad's empty.

1556
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:29,825
All right, got it.

1557
01:39:31,627 --> 01:39:32,494
Hello?

1558
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:38,967
Get up.

1559
01:39:46,209 --> 01:39:48,326
Are you gonna
tell me the truth?

1560
01:39:48,394 --> 01:39:51,679
Are you gonna tell me why you're
here, why this is happening

1561
01:39:51,698 --> 01:39:54,449
and none of it makes sense?
None of it.

1562
01:39:56,102 --> 01:39:57,469
What if you had
to tell someone

1563
01:39:57,537 --> 01:39:58,837
the most important
thing in the world,

1564
01:39:58,905 --> 01:40:01,239
but you knew they'd
never believe you?

1565
01:40:03,209 --> 01:40:04,392
What would you do?

1566
01:40:05,462 --> 01:40:07,629
I'd try.

1567
01:40:07,696 --> 01:40:10,399
You never know
what someone might believe.

1568
01:40:16,722 --> 01:40:21,192
I don't understand what's...
What's happening.

1569
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:47,436
I gotta hurry up
and get down there.

1570
01:40:47,503 --> 01:40:50,338
Why are you the only one
who can stop him?

1571
01:40:50,406 --> 01:40:52,491
Well, because I'm the only
one that knows his plan.

1572
01:40:52,559 --> 01:40:54,092
I'm the only one that knows
where he's gonna be

1573
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:55,827
and exactly
what he's gonna do.

1574
01:40:55,895 --> 01:40:57,529
How do you know that?

1575
01:40:57,597 --> 01:41:00,432
I mean, how'd you know
those things about me?

1576
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,267
Well,
for the sake of argument,

1577
01:41:02,334 --> 01:41:04,937
let's just say that the
government has a special device

1578
01:41:04,954 --> 01:41:09,191
that allows me to know what's
gonna happen ahead of time.

1579
01:41:09,259 --> 01:41:11,643
Then how come you didn't know I
was gonna pull a gun on you?

1580
01:41:11,711 --> 01:41:14,279
I did. No, I didn't.

1581
01:41:17,967 --> 01:41:20,085
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's good.

1582
01:41:21,504 --> 01:41:23,071
One second.

1583
01:41:27,627 --> 01:41:30,778
I think that's gonna stay.
Is that okay?

1584
01:41:30,847 --> 01:41:32,147
Yeah, it's great.

1585
01:41:32,215 --> 01:41:32,997
Okay.

1586
01:41:35,217 --> 01:41:37,052
All right.
I'm not very good at this.

1587
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,787
You're very good.

1588
01:41:52,285 --> 01:41:54,102
What's the matter?

1589
01:41:55,104 --> 01:41:56,621
Jesus.

1590
01:41:59,909 --> 01:42:03,078
I haven't changed a thing.

1591
01:42:03,145 --> 01:42:05,413
I gotta go.
And you gotta go with me. Come on.

1592
01:42:05,481 --> 01:42:07,148
What?

1593
01:42:07,216 --> 01:42:08,449
I thought you said
I was safe now.

1594
01:42:08,518 --> 01:42:09,718
I was wrong.
I was wrong.

1595
01:42:09,785 --> 01:42:11,753
You gotta go with me now.
Right now.

1596
01:42:12,755 --> 01:42:14,956
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't answer it.

1597
01:42:17,293 --> 01:42:18,560
Don't answer it.
I'll prove it to you.

1598
01:42:18,628 --> 01:42:19,761
That's your friend
Beth calling.

1599
01:42:19,829 --> 01:42:21,662
Let the machine pick it up.
She's gonna say,

1600
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:23,215
<i>"Hi, Claire.
It's Beth. Are you there?</i>

1601
01:42:23,282 --> 01:42:25,000
"I'm sorry to
call you so early,

1602
01:42:25,067 --> 01:42:28,570
"but when you didn't call me
last night I got worried."

1603
01:42:28,638 --> 01:42:31,423
<i>Claire? Hi, it's Beth.</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

1604
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:33,075
<i>I'm sorry to</i>
<i>call you so early,</i>

1605
01:42:33,142 --> 01:42:34,960
<i>but you said you were gonna
call me when you got home,</i>

1606
01:42:35,028 --> 01:42:37,095
<i>and when you didn't,</i>
<i>I started to get worried.</i>

1607
01:42:37,163 --> 01:42:38,830
Beth, is this a joke?
<i>Oh, hey, hey! No.</i>

1608
01:42:38,897 --> 01:42:40,581
<i>Like--Like I said, I was just
worried about you, that's all.</i>

1609
01:42:40,649 --> 01:42:42,901
I can't talk right now.
Someone's here. I'll call you later.

1610
01:42:42,968 --> 01:42:44,269
<i>Claire...</i>

1611
01:42:44,337 --> 01:42:47,138
Believe me, the only one you're
gonna be safe with is me.

1612
01:42:47,206 --> 01:42:49,107
Okay.
Let's go.

1613
01:42:54,030 --> 01:42:55,663
I don't understand.

1614
01:42:55,731 --> 01:42:59,600
Why not just call the police and
have them arrest him at the dock?

1615
01:42:59,668 --> 01:43:01,753
He'll set the bomb off
right there on the spot.

1616
01:43:01,821 --> 01:43:03,388
He can't know
he's been compromised

1617
01:43:03,456 --> 01:43:05,557
until it's too late for him
to do anything about it.

1618
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:08,493
He'll set the timer, walk away
on foot, get on his motorcycle

1619
01:43:08,561 --> 01:43:11,330
and ride to the Crescent
City Bridge to watch.

1620
01:43:11,332 --> 01:43:13,498
Okay, then what?

1621
01:43:13,566 --> 01:43:15,384
You defuse the bomb?

1622
01:43:15,451 --> 01:43:17,619
Then I defuse the bomb.

1623
01:44:15,761 --> 01:44:17,629
There's my truck.

1624
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,240
All these people.
There he is.

1625
01:44:29,308 --> 01:44:30,826
Where?

1626
01:44:30,893 --> 01:44:34,012
You see the military jacket
coming this way?

1627
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:39,585
It's just what you said.

1628
01:44:39,652 --> 01:44:42,921
All right, you see those
officers behind you?

1629
01:44:42,989 --> 01:44:45,223
Yeah.
When the ferry pulls off,

1630
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:47,742
I want you to tell them
about the bomb, all right?

1631
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:50,195
They'll believe me?
They better believe you.

1632
01:44:50,263 --> 01:44:51,612
Come on,
they'll arrest me.

1633
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:52,530
They won't arrest you.

1634
01:44:52,598 --> 01:44:53,982
They'll take you
into custody.

1635
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:56,584
You'll be fine.
That's a good thing.

1636
01:44:56,652 --> 01:44:58,136
Don't turn around.

1637
01:45:04,693 --> 01:45:05,927
Doug...

1638
01:45:08,964 --> 01:45:10,365
Be careful.

1639
01:45:43,316 --> 01:45:45,183
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1640
01:45:45,251 --> 01:45:47,736
<i>Passengers are not allowed</i>
<i>on the car deck</i>

1641
01:45:47,803 --> 01:45:50,555
<i>when the ferry is in motion.</i>

1642
01:45:57,363 --> 01:45:58,730
Sir! Sir.

1643
01:45:58,798 --> 01:46:01,516
Excuse me, sir, you're gonna
have to move to the upper deck.

1644
01:46:01,518 --> 01:46:02,584
Passengers
aren't allowed here.

1645
01:46:02,652 --> 01:46:04,002
Okay.

1646
01:46:43,493 --> 01:46:45,693
Can't believe it.
They're right on time.

1647
01:46:45,761 --> 01:46:48,046
Let's get these boys
to their party.

1648
01:47:10,702 --> 01:47:12,670
Mama!

1649
01:48:55,057 --> 01:48:57,308
Excuse me, sir? Sir!

1650
01:48:57,376 --> 01:49:00,912
There's no passengers allowed
on the car deck during transit.

1651
01:49:04,032 --> 01:49:06,350
No passengers allowed, sir.

1652
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:21,916
Let's go! Let's go!

1653
01:50:19,641 --> 01:50:22,377
It's destiny, Oerstadt.

1654
01:50:22,445 --> 01:50:25,413
Satan reasons like a man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1655
01:50:28,134 --> 01:50:29,917
What did you say?

1656
01:50:29,985 --> 01:50:33,304
I'm saying it's gonna take a little
divine intervention here, buddy.

1657
01:50:35,424 --> 01:50:37,108
I'm coming out.

1658
01:50:45,117 --> 01:50:46,967
What'd you say?

1659
01:50:47,853 --> 01:50:49,704
I thought you were a patriot.

1660
01:50:49,772 --> 01:50:51,122
Oh, I am.

1661
01:50:52,190 --> 01:50:54,942
Patriotism
requires sacrifice.

1662
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:56,745
I'm willing to sacrifice.

1663
01:50:56,812 --> 01:50:58,312
Yeah? Who? Her? Me?

1664
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:01,182
You're willing to sacrifice
others, but not yourself.

1665
01:51:01,249 --> 01:51:03,101
The Tree of Liberty
must be refreshed

1666
01:51:03,169 --> 01:51:05,537
with the blood of
patriots and tyrants.

1667
01:51:06,806 --> 01:51:07,839
Right.

1668
01:51:07,906 --> 01:51:09,174
Sometimes
a little human collateral

1669
01:51:09,241 --> 01:51:11,709
is the cost of freedom,
isn't it?

1670
01:51:16,649 --> 01:51:18,550
Who are you, Oerstadt?

1671
01:51:21,787 --> 01:51:23,071
Who are you?

1672
01:51:25,891 --> 01:51:28,059
It's not supposed
to be this way.

1673
01:51:55,671 --> 01:51:57,271
You all right?

1674
01:52:00,492 --> 01:52:01,809
I killed him.

1675
01:52:01,876 --> 01:52:03,428
No, you didn't. I did.

1676
01:52:03,496 --> 01:52:06,381
<i>It's 10:48</i>

Hit the gas!

1682
