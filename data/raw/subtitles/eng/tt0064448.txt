2
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:54,597
- What round is it?
- It's still the first.

3
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:58,195
- I've been on this floor 3 times.
- 4.

4
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:02,965
Why set a world's record, huh?

5
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,716
Now what?

6
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,199
Now we go back to Paris.

7
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:22,396
And then what?

8
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,603
Then we go get us a cold beer.

9
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:30,402
You're running out
of things to do, my friend.

10
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:36,086
It's time to go home, Reno. Take a
job on your brother's chicken ranch.

11
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:38,882
Write the book you're always
taking about.

12
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:40,999
Make something of yourself.

13
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:44,838
Chickens get up awfully early, Louis.

14
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:52,400
- A tire?
- Didn't sound like it.

15
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,042
Somebody's shooting at us!

16
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,159
Little past your bedtime, isn't it?

17
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:18,806
Get a load of this.

18
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:23,202
- Oh, it's very small.
- Big enough to steal a Beretta.

19
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,998
What are you going to do about him?

20
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:29,396
I don't know.

21
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,206
Come on. Mush.

22
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:47,876
Who do I see about his kid?

23
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,876
Paul.

24
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:07,199
Looks like you've been out for
a walk in your pajamas and slippers.

25
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:09,359
Or running away from home, maybe?

26
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:13,000
You didn't leave me a note.
You didn't kiss me goodbye.

27
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:16,844
- Maybe you don't love me anymore.
- I was going to come back.

28
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:22,046
That's good to hear. It wouldn't be
much fun around here without you.

29
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,715
I see you brought home a friend.

30
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:29,641
Davis is the name. The beef is
that kid tried to kill me...

31
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,678
on the Bois de Boulogne
not 15 minutes ago.

32
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,998
This 58 pound boy tried to kill you?

33
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:35,476
He sure as hell did.

34
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:37,958
He won't go to the bathroom
alone if it's dark.

35
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:41,320
Besides, I put him to bed myself
at 7:30 with his teddy bear.

36
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,558
He got out again with a gun.

37
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:49,236
Lady, I came within 2 inches of
being cold meat in the Paris morgue!

38
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,723
- What are you gonna do about it?
- He's 8 years old. You're scaring him.

39
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:54,686
Dammit! He scared me!

40
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:57,606
Paul, I think
we must have an explanation.

41
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:01,966
- I this man telling the truth?
- I wasn't aiming at him.

42
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,999
I was only trying out the gun.

43
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:10,165
Take him upstairs.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

44
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:12,600
Hold on a minute.

45
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,242
If we had a woodshed handy
we'd settle it out there.

46
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,837
As there isn't, you grab a deep
breath and say, "I'm sorry sir."

47
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,842
Anything along that line'll do.

48
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:27,325
I'm sorry sir.
I didn't mean to alarm you.

49
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:31,198
I apologize for any inconvenience
I may have caused you.

50
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,517
More than I bargained for but ok.

51
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,998
- Dismissed?
- Dismissed.

52
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:45,526
My name is Claude de Gonde, I'm
the boy's much chagrinned uncle.

53
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:46,636
Reno Davis.

54
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:51,083
Paul's father is dead.
He has no one to follow.

55
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:52,316
You must forgive us.

56
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:59,316
When my old man died, I crawled
under the porch for 3 days.

57
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:02,721
They had to get a fireman
with a hockey stick to get me out.

58
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,925
Then you won't find it necessary
to mention this to the police.

59
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,116
Forget it.

60
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:11,842
May I compensate you in
any way for your trouble?

61
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,082
No trouble.
I can find the door.

62
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:17,959
I wish there was
something we could do.

63
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,203
There is. You can run bed
check on that boy from now on.

64
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,364
Leaving town Mr. Davis?

65
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,842
- Trying to.
- Can't you get any action?

66
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,405
Looks like I'm getting some now.

67
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:10,956
Get in.

68
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,042
- Broke?
- Well...

69
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,355
If I bought I nickel
candy bar it would dent me.

70
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,322
I've gone through a lot
of trouble tracking you down.

71
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,725
Your concierge told me I might
find you here if I hurried.

72
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,520
What have you got in mind Lady?

73
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:47,876
My son thinks you're the greatest
thing since vanilla icecream.

74
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,926
- That's nice.
- I'm looking for a tutor for him.

75
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,563
Not the usual kind.
He's had those.

76
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,959
But he's never seen America. I'd
like for him to know what it's like.

77
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:03,283
4th of July, opening day at
the ballpark, trick or treat.

78
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:04,886
Why don't you take him there?

79
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,561
I could bring it to him
with someone like you.

80
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:12,555
You don't know anything about me.

81
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,564
You don't know anything
about me either.

82
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:17,399
Do you want to take it on, yes or no?

83
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:19,676
Lady...

84
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,839
I'm no Mary Poppins.

85
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:24,482
It pays 3000 francs a month...

86
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,159
that's 600 American dollars.

87
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:29,087
That's a great little kid you got,
I love him already.

88
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,800
I thought you might be available.

89
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:32,958
For hire, nor for sale.

90
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:36,238
I want a TV set,
American coffee, and...

91
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:39,516
every Sunday off.

92
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,559
- Every other Sunday.
- Ok.

93
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,037
I'll see you later,
back at the house.

94
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:40,836
Reno Davis.

95
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:42,996
I know.

96
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,676
This way.

97
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:09,039
I'll take one of your cigarettes.

98
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:14,400
An American this time. I suppose
you'll want a bath every day.

99
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,598
- That's right.
- And no garlic in your food.

100
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,840
Americans worry about their breath.

101
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,198
Not me. Mine's sweet as a baby's.

102
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:28,319
We had one before you. He wore
silk shirts and Italian shoes.

103
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,279
Yeah? What happened to him?

104
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:33,796
Dead.

105
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,766
The work that hard?

106
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,800
My name is Jeanne-Marie.
I'll be looking after you.

107
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:45,324
Doing your room, your laundry,
whatever else required.

108
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:46,966
I expect to be tipped.

109
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:51,118
- What's the going rate?
- I'll leave that up to you.

110
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:55,247
Where do I leave the money?
On the dresser?

111
00:13:56,287 --> 00:14:00,166
Why not?
You'll get very good service.

112
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,718
But I'm kind of hard to please.

113
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:06,477
I like somebody there to pick up
the soap in the shower when I drop it.

114
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:07,596
Stuff like that.

115
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,839
You don't look like the type.

116
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:13,444
The other men in this house
find me attractive.

117
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:17,681
They're right.
You are really yummy.

118
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:22,759
It's just that I like to put
the ball into play myself.

119
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:27,445
So where's your room doll?

120
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:31,484
If you are so independent...

121
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:33,796
find it!

122
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,964
Allow me to present you to
the rest of the family.

123
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,676
My mother in law,
Madame Gabrielle de Villemont...

124
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,758
the most venerated
member of our family.

125
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,158
Monsieur Vosier, my cousin.

126
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:49,756
And his charming wife.

127
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:00,121
Oh yes, my secretary,
Monsieur Bourdon.

128
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,087
We dress for dinner in this house.

129
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:11,925
I would have worn my navy blue suit,
except I hocked it.

130
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:14,967
My governess took
her meals in the kitchen.

131
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:18,162
We grow alarmingly democratic.

132
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,757
Proust once called Madame a snob.

133
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,758
She regarded it as a great compliment.

134
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:26,802
What will you drink?
Montrachet, Chambertin?

135
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:27,996
Equally pleasant.

136
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:30,718
- I don't know.
- Try the Montrachet.

137
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:35,204
You'd better drink something.
The going can get rough these dinners.

138
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:38,044
Anne's afraid I'll bore
you with our misfortunes...

139
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,920
we talk a great deal about
the old days, all that's been lost.

140
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,123
We had the most beautiful house.

141
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:45,806
Of white stone.

142
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:49,324
Grapes from the table came
from our own vineyard.

143
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:55,479
You see, we're colonials run out of
Algeria, stripped of everything.

144
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,517
Exiled from the home we love
and can never see again.

145
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:35,157
I'm displeased with you for not
consulting me about the American.

146
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,205
Anne made the choice.

147
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:41,241
- Complications will arise from him.
- I don't foresee any.

148
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:44,485
They've already begun.

149
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:02,526
You're over 21. Do you have to show
your license her to get a drink?

150
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,280
She's the head of the house.
We differ.

151
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:09,085
You're not a falling down drunk,
are you?

152
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,155
I'd like to be.

153
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:16,919
I might to if I had to visit the
plantation in Algeria every night.

154
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:20,398
Twice on Sunday.
But that's not why I drink.

155
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:22,600
You got better reasons?

156
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:27,117
I am a poor little widow woman
and when everybody goes to bed...

157
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:30,040
and turns out the lights,
the bats begin to fly.

158
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:33,481
You seem tired my dear.
Why don't you go to bed?

159
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,756
I'm not ready yet.

160
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:39,436
You need your rest. Madame
has not been well lately.

161
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:41,883
Madame has been crazy lately.

162
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:43,926
Madame is crazy now.

163
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:46,997
As a matter of fact, I just
got off the happy farm.

164
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:51,282
People keep dieing all around me
like I was one big traffic accident.

165
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:53,406
It's the damnest thing.

166
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:57,555
Paul has fallen asleep. Would you
mind taking him to his room?

167
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,080
- Now.
- Sure.

168
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:04,915
Just to keep me in the picture,
what happened to the guy before me?

169
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,160
He was found in the river.

170
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,275
Floating on top like
a Japanese paper.

171
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:12,922
Is that right?

172
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:16,201
If I don't make the grade,
just can me.

173
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:02,840
I thought I'd met 'em all.

174
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:06,757
I'm not a member of the family,
Mr. Davis.

175
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:11,161
I'm Dr. Morillon.
Anne de Villemont is my patient.

176
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,523
This is Paul de Villemont.

177
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:17,326
You've got the wrong room Doc.

178
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,765
I look after the child as well.

179
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,279
I call by every night,
we have a quiet time together...

180
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:25,476
before he goes to sleep.

181
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,756
He might sleep easier
if they moved him out of here.

182
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:33,837
This isn't a kid's room.
It's a battalion headquarters.

183
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:38,519
These standards may
look like rags to you...

184
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:41,207
but men have wrapped
themselves in them and died...

185
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:44,679
in Senegal, in the Sudan,
at Dienbienphu...

186
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,046
He can sleep under them.

187
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:50,326
You're the doctor.

188
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:51,836
I'm more than that.

189
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:54,965
I was his father's closest friend.

190
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,197
He died in a hot street in Algeria.

191
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:02,477
They threw a bomb in
the open window of his car.

192
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:06,805
The ashes from the fire
settled on our white suits.

193
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:10,999
There are times
I wish I died with him.

194
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:14,476
At any rate...

195
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,366
we still have his son.

196
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,321
The line is unbroken.

197
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,957
There will be another
General de Villemont.

198
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:25,723
Supposing he blows it and
turns out to be a dentist.

199
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,606
This one will drill men Mr. Davis...

200
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:36,435
not teeth.

201
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:46,966
Alright Paul!

202
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,476
Strike.

203
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:50,115
- This hand.
- This.

204
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:52,556
Man on second, lined up...

205
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:56,117
Pitch.
Strike two.

206
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,242
One more strike and we got him out.

207
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:18,246
He's out!

208
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:20,396
That a boy!

209
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:21,996
Mr. Davis!

210
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,643
I don't want my child
disappearing on me.

211
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:31,360
I want to know where
he is every minute.

212
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:33,956
If you leave the house, check
with me first. Is that clear?

213
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,765
You don't just bundle him off.

214
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,919
Look lady, that kid has got
to be let off the leash...

215
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:40,685
and you are holding up the game.

216
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:44,599
Here Louis, see if
he can handle a curve.

217
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,036
Have a seat in the bleachers?

218
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:50,641
Who's the man?

219
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:53,397
My friend Louis, nice man.

220
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:56,355
Keeps elevator doors from
closing on little old ladies.

221
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,566
Also likes kids.

222
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,237
Who doesn't?
I wish I had a dozen of them.

223
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,282
What's stopping you?

224
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:05,360
I don't happen to have a husband.

225
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:09,006
You're young, good looking.
You'll get another crack at it.

226
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,725
I'm not interested in
getting married again.

227
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:15,085
And I'm not in the least anxious to
discuss my personal affairs with you.

228
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,076
Furthermore...

229
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:21,126
I don't want you to do any night
prowling while you in my house.

230
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:25,286
So stay away from the maid,
I've got a youngster to think about.

231
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:29,756
Don't worry. There's only one woman
on the premises that interests me.

232
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:31,316
That's his mama.

233
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:37,082
I pay you to look after my son.
And you concentrate on that.

234
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,245
It's the only thing
that concerns me.

235
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:41,275
Maybe too much.

236
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,843
Sometimes in bed at night,
I think that he's gone.

237
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:49,518
I run into his room and he's there.

238
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,238
But one night he won't be.

239
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:54,997
- You've been threatened?
- No.

240
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:57,916
- Then forget it.
- I'm afraid I can't.

241
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:03,484
If it'll make you feel any better...

242
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:05,603
I'll bunk in with him and
never let him out of my sight.

243
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:09,886
- That's not enough.
- Short of a gun, what else can I do?

244
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,158
Carry one. This one.

245
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,995
You can blow a very big hole
through a man with this.

246
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:19,515
Maybe you could lady.

247
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:28,518
- Where did you get this?
- The lady of the house.

248
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:32,079
Her fear of kidnapping.

249
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:36,878
It's come up before. She's treated
by our doctor for this very thing.

250
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:42,320
I understand. Her husband was killed
by terrorists in Algeria.

251
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:46,520
The boy is very like him. She's
afraid he might become a victim too.

252
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:49,526
But there's no threat.
There's no plot.

253
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:52,839
No danger to the boy.
Except one.

254
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,316
Anne herself.

255
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:59,000
It might become necessary
to protect the boy from her.

256
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:16,286
You seem agitated.

257
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,236
Why?

258
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:19,956
No. It's nothing.

259
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:25,916
Still.

260
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:29,597
Our young American friend
grows curious.

261
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:33,877
Why should there be
any curiosity about us?

262
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:38,878
Dr. Morillon, the eminent
psychiatrist, Vosier...

263
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:41,324
a celebrated bon viver...

264
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,802
you, a prominent man of business...

265
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,081
my own modest self,
a publisher of some...

266
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:49,676
repute. All of us...

267
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:52,316
pillars...

268
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,039
of the French society.

269
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:58,157
Sampson pushed pillars
and the temple fell.

270
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:03,683
Our temple is not going to fall.

271
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:09,038
No, you my dear De Gonde,
are going to give a party...

272
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:11,323
And invite our young gentleman.

273
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,156
Yes.

274
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:19,283
We'll soon see if our American
Sampson must be shorn.

275
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:39,440
Here below is the King of Cups.

276
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,277
It means there is a powerful man...

277
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,643
who may either become
your good friend...

278
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:46,160
or your deadly enemy.

279
00:25:46,687 --> 00:25:49,076
This is now being weighed
in the balance.

280
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,679
You drew the tower my dear.

281
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,319
Are you sure you're
dealing off the top?

282
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:59,121
You may make light of it,
but in Tarot...

283
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:03,283
this card predicts
ruin and disaster.

284
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:07,676
I didn't get your name.

285
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:10,238
- Davis, Reno.
- What do you know?

286
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:11,926
I'd sure rather run into
an American around here.

287
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:14,283
Jesse Hardee, tractors and hardware.

288
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:16,683
You like this town son?
You having yourself a good time?

289
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:19,156
Ring a ding.

290
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:22,878
Well you're young. I've had an
acid stomach ever since I got here.

291
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:26,198
They can keep their fancy wines.
Give me good old Milwaukee beer.

292
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:28,284
What are you?
A friend of the family or what?

293
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:29,960
I work for 'em.

294
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,605
These are inspired people Davis.

295
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,720
They see the termites gnawing away
at the foundations of the house...

296
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,124
and intend to do something about it
before the walls cave in.

297
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:43,240
I saw you fight in the Vel d'Hiv
about a year ago...

298
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:45,443
the night you knocked out
that big Senegalese.

299
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:46,556
I got lucky.

300
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,161
Right. If you hadn't run him to
death, he'd have cut you to pieces.

301
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:51,755
I'm Leschenhaut.
I was a boxer myself...

302
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:55,044
also one time priest,
an unfrocked communist...

303
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:59,078
a bad poet, a good lover,
a big eater... What are you?

304
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,237
I'm a vaccinated, white,
protestant American male...

305
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:03,806
with a slight sinus condition.

306
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:08,479
You're more than that. You write.
I read your something...

307
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,116
in the "Paris Review".
Wasn't your Papa Hemingway...

308
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:12,879
handy with his fists?

309
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:14,760
He laid out a few
critics in his time.

310
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:16,405
What would you like to fight for?

311
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:19,202
I don't know.
A place in the subway maybe.

312
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:21,039
What about a new world without...

313
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:25,559
any weaklings, without any would be
suicides who don't have the guts...

314
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,120
to slit their own throats?

315
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,678
Sounds groovy, but
what do you do for laughs?

316
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:31,961
As a writer you have a duty...

317
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:34,766
to reveal
the true nature of the enemy.

318
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:40,961
Join us in our great crusade. The
black and yellow hordes are advancing.

319
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:43,880
We must hold them off.

320
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:47,276
Sieg Heil.

321
00:27:50,527 --> 00:27:53,837
Would you believe me if
I told you I'm freezing to death?

322
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:55,956
Yes.

323
00:27:56,207 --> 00:28:00,200
I guess it's this marble staircase.
It's been a lifelong problem.

324
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:03,799
- Would you like to go someplace else?
- Where?

325
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:09,367
We could got to the kitchen,
raid the icebox.

326
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,920
I've never seen the kitchen.

327
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:13,840
I own the damn house and
I've never seen the kitchen.

328
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:15,880
How do you get at
the leftover turkey?

329
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:20,242
I ring bells and
I get things on trays...

330
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:22,887
under little silver covers.

331
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:24,596
Tough life!

332
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:26,476
Lonesome.

333
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:30,085
I never see the milkman.

334
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:38,002
You don't approve of all this.
What do you approve of, Mr. Davis?

335
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:42,400
I started out approving of you lady.
Very much.

336
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,684
Now you're beginning
to change your mind?

337
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,519
Let me change it back for you.

338
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:54,116
- Goodnight boss.
- No. It's early.

339
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:57,518
But I don't want to
turn into a pumpkin.

340
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,316
- Good grey doctor.
- Good evening Madame.

341
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:07,879
You're late. It must
be pretty sick out.

342
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:10,484
- My apologies.
- Mr. Davis...

343
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:15,162
May I present Dr. Morillon,
the man who polices my psyche.

344
00:29:15,927 --> 00:29:17,918
Mr. Davis is my son's nanny.

345
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:20,396
We have met.

346
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,764
You've missed
several appointments lately.

347
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:26,316
Guilty.

348
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:30,926
I think you should take your
situation a little more seriously.

349
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,245
I know I'm in trouble.

350
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:37,839
Lead a quiet life Madame.
A discrete one.

351
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,523
Be more concerned for your health.

352
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:45,005
I don't really care that much.

353
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:55,079
Mr. Davis...

354
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:59,242
would you help steer
me up these stairs?

355
00:30:00,847 --> 00:30:03,042
I'm not so sure
I can make it under my own steam.

356
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:22,796
Nighty night.

357
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:27,155
Mr. Davis,
please don't leave.

358
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:36,283
I want you to help me
to get out of here.

359
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:43,638
- I'll pay you a lot of money.
- Where do you want to go?

360
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:45,841
New York...

361
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:48,798
Zanzibar, Iceland...

362
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:54,405
- any place out of France.
- Buy a ticket. Get on a jet.

363
00:30:56,087 --> 00:31:00,205
I tried that. Paul and I
got as far as the airport.

364
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,321
They brought us back.

365
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:05,996
Who?

366
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:10,724
My brother in law, De Gonde
and the other one, Edmond.

367
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:12,475
Dragged you back, huh?

368
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:13,882
You don't believe it?

369
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:17,606
I'm listening.

370
00:31:17,767 --> 00:31:19,166
I had a breakdown.

371
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:22,558
They put me in a sanitarium at Issy.

372
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:26,727
I spent 3 months cutting out
paper dolls...

373
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:30,119
and there was only
one way to get out.

374
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:33,842
I had to put myself under
De Gonde's charge.

375
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,041
That's where I am now.

376
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:38,436
Under house arrest, huh?

377
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,436
That's right.

378
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,723
You think I'm making it
up as I go along?

379
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:49,040
I don't want to hurt your feelings but
we have to take into consideration...

380
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,800
the possibility that you're
a little out of your skull.

381
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:55,161
Your doctor thinks so,
so does your brother in law.

382
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:59,846
And so do you.
How can I overcome that Mr. Davis?

383
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:03,995
How do I get your help?

384
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:10,956
If I can't buy it, do you
want me to go to bed with you?

385
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,641
The idea has a lot of merit.

386
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,646
But somehow I reached my manhood...

387
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:24,847
without using slugs in the telephone
or taking advantage of distress cases.

388
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:46,519
Scotch.

389
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:48,236
Mr. Davis...

390
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:53,763
I've left my cigarettes in my coat, would
you be good enough to get them?

391
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,678
You want me to get your cigarettes?

392
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:00,839
Do you find the suggestion outrageous?

393
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:03,239
Not if both your legs are broken.

394
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:06,283
You must forgive me if
I misunderstood your position.

395
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:09,235
I thought you were a servant.

396
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:13,316
Have one of mine.

397
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:20,164
You take a great interest in Madame.
And she in you.

398
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:27,403
- You make housecalls yourself doc.
- Let me speak to you plainly.

399
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:30,957
Let me tell you what I think
of a man that tries to...

400
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:33,726
make love to an unstable
neurotic woman.

401
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,325
It belongs in the clinical textbook...

402
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,676
along with your other degenerates.

403
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:42,837
You better have some aspirin
in that little black bag of yours.

404
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:45,161
'Cause you're gonna have
a hell of a headache.

405
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:59,202
You're too tense Pablo.
They'll never bite.

406
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:04,325
- But how can they tell?
- Believe it. They can tell.

407
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,035
Hey Reno!

408
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:11,802
Only for such men of character
would I arrive at 6 in the morning.

409
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:40,396
Reno...

410
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,996
How do you like my little Veronique?

411
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:46,678
- She replaces Adele.
- Who replaced Marie.

412
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:48,155
I found her in the police station...

413
00:34:48,247 --> 00:34:51,000
when I went to pay
a fine for committing...

414
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,766
a public outrage.

415
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:55,725
Louis, I've been warning
you about that.

416
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,885
This time I was caught
writing on the wall.

417
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:04,120
Anyway. This little pigeon is going
to see if there is a dossier...

418
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:05,641
on your Dr. Morillon.

419
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:09,126
While the Prefect of Police
is pinching her bottom...

420
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:11,125
she'll be pinching the papers.

421
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:14,439
I could lose my job.
What if I do?

422
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:18,205
You won't baby, we've decided
to let the matter drop.

423
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,359
- Why have you changed your mind?
- 'Cause of an hour ago...

424
00:35:21,927 --> 00:35:23,645
the lady doesn't want me to mix in.

425
00:35:24,407 --> 00:35:27,240
I'm not surprised.
It fits in with my theory.

426
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:29,918
I have one you know.

427
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:32,758
That the lady and her lover...

428
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:35,357
this handsome, virile doctor...

429
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:37,239
did away with her husband.

430
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,720
And that murder breeds others.

431
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:44,519
There is a delicate, young man
named Sidney Scott.

432
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:46,035
Her son's tutor.

433
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:50,243
Madame gets drunk one night and
lets him in on the secret.

434
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,883
Voilà!
Another victim.

435
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:55,686
You like this scenario?

436
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,047
It might run second on a double bill.

437
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:06,476
Duck!

438
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:18,083
Take the kid to your place.
And fast!

439
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:25,203
Just like Saturday night television,
huh Pablo?

440
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:28,046
The good guys, the bad guys.
Only we're ok now.

441
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:32,035
Reno, my friend, I am sorry.

442
00:38:11,847 --> 00:38:14,759
Touching.
Such tenderness.

443
00:38:15,447 --> 00:38:16,880
I've told him what happened.

444
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:19,476
It was you.

445
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:23,200
You're lying in your teeth.

446
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:28,758
Somebody was waiting in this room.

447
00:38:30,087 --> 00:38:31,076
Who was it?

448
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:34,280
Nobody but you, his best friend...

449
00:38:34,407 --> 00:38:36,637
with a knife in your hand.

450
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:39,795
The boy was here, standing
right there. Where is he?

451
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:42,477
What boy?
There was no boy!

452
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:45,361
Where is he?
Talk lady while you still can!

453
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:47,756
Swine!

454
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,246
I'll be there when
the guillotine drops.

455
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:51,967
I hope so sweetheart,
right under it.

456
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,244
My dear fellow,
what are you doing here?

457
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:52,596
Where is everybody?

458
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:55,440
- Where's the boy?
- The family has taking a holiday.

459
00:40:55,647 --> 00:40:59,003
Gone to their country residence
in Dijon, an annual occasion.

460
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:03,086
A friend of mine just had
his throat cut ear to ear.

461
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,165
The boy I was responsible for...

462
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:06,726
has disappeared into a rabbit hole.

463
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,646
Are you trying to tell me that
everybody's off on a picnic?

464
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,919
I'm about to join them myself.

465
00:41:15,327 --> 00:41:18,364
Every cop in Paris is looking
for me, I need that kid.

466
00:41:18,927 --> 00:41:22,283
He had a grandstand seat. He's the
only ticket I got out of this jam.

467
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,563
You and I are gonna find him pronto.

468
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,241
If I don't agree?

469
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:32,636
If I wind up in the paddy wagon
some of the family'll be with me.

470
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:34,195
How would you accomplish that?

471
00:41:34,687 --> 00:41:37,724
What could you say about one
of the first families of France?

472
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:39,957
That the great General de Villemont...

473
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:42,959
got handed his head by his
loving wife and his best buddy.

474
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,678
How would you like to read that
over your morning croissant?

475
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:47,806
Not particularly.

476
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:50,757
But if, as you say the police
are one step behind you...

477
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:53,202
how do you get to the garage
without the danger of being seen?

478
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:56,685
This is a big house.
There must be another way out.

479
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:57,876
There isn't.

480
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:00,405
Find one or dig one, Eddie.

481
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,446
If I'm framed for one murder,
I'd just as soon go for two.

482
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:06,956
Alright.

483
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:37,160
There's no light down here.

484
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,156
Turn it out.

485
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:53,526
Make love not war.

486
00:42:54,927 --> 00:42:58,317
The cause is just. I serve
in his ranks willingly.

487
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:01,444
Just another well motivated soldier.

488
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:04,845
What would you know
about these matters?

489
00:43:05,047 --> 00:43:08,801
What did you ever earn that
couldn't be tossed on a dump heap?

490
00:43:10,127 --> 00:43:12,687
My vineyards in Algeria brought
me in a million a year.

491
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,357
Until France took them and gave them
to savages who leave filth in...

492
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,404
- the house my grandmother was born.
- Ok.

493
00:43:19,407 --> 00:43:22,399
You had a nice piece of real estate,
you took a loss on it.

494
00:43:24,447 --> 00:43:27,996
No you blind kids in the streets,
check plastic bombs into apartments...

495
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:30,885
and leave sharpshooters on corners
to knock off your elected officials.

496
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:37,080
One day we shall. One day
France will be ours.

497
00:43:38,287 --> 00:43:41,359
I'd hate to see that happen.
You'd lose the tourist trade.

498
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:36,836
Wait there.

499
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:52,361
Shall we walk Mr. Davis?
Beautiful day.

500
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,764
You may observe a little
architectural resemblance...

501
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:57,843
between this place and
our Paris residence.

502
00:44:59,327 --> 00:45:01,557
Both contain an element of
gracious living...

503
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:04,485
combined with massiveness, solidity.

504
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:06,999
It's fascinating
to study architecture.

505
00:45:08,527 --> 00:45:10,597
Edmond tells me you've
been through our cellar.

506
00:45:11,407 --> 00:45:13,716
It looks like Chicago when
Capone was a big cheese.

507
00:45:15,247 --> 00:45:17,158
We are men who have an answer.

508
00:45:17,607 --> 00:45:19,837
There was a time when I'd
hoped to enlist you as one of us.

509
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:23,845
You don't want me.
I voted for Adlai Stevenson.

510
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,723
No. As it turns out
we don't want you Mr. Davis.

511
00:45:27,407 --> 00:45:31,400
You've been meddlesome and shown a
distressing curiosity in family affairs.

512
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:34,965
I didn't come here to smell your
cigar smoke and have my ear bent.

513
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,237
- I'm in a bind Mister.
- Indeed you are.

514
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:39,718
I want to see the mother and
after that I want to see the kid.

515
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:42,442
Madame is not well,
she's not to be disturbed.

516
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,721
Then I'll settle for the kid.

517
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:47,516
I'm certain you would. Unfortunately
the witness you need isn't with us.

518
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:49,997
- He moved pretty fast.
- Of necessity.

519
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:53,040
- What did you do with him?
- Out of reach.

520
00:45:55,247 --> 00:45:56,282
But you're not.

521
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,726
Are you threatening to thrash
the information out of me?

522
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:02,836
There are 40 muscular
young men about this place.

523
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,563
Even a small Japanese Karate expert.

524
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:07,440
We only lack a moat in fact.

525
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,395
Sounds impressive.

526
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:15,477
We're prepared to offer you 2 choices.

527
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,603
One very pleasant,
the other less so.

528
00:46:18,327 --> 00:46:20,158
You can have an amusing life
in South America...

529
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:22,005
with its mild climate
and lovely women...

530
00:46:23,007 --> 00:46:25,919
or end life in a shallow ditch
by a country road.

531
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:28,196
Which is it to be?

532
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:32,964
I think I'll brush up on my Spanish.

533
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:36,320
In a few days we will
take you to Marseilles...

534
00:46:36,647 --> 00:46:38,478
and give you passage
on a ship for Argentina.

535
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,560
In the meanwhile you will
have a room in the chateau...

536
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:43,365
and be made
as comfortable as possible.

537
00:46:43,647 --> 00:46:45,080
You have made a wise decision.

538
00:46:45,847 --> 00:46:47,758
One should cling to live
above everything else.

539
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:13,043
I'll have this taken to your room.

540
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,123
I see you finally got to my room.

541
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:17,165
- It's taken you a while.
- Sorry about that.

542
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:20,400
You came over the roof?

543
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,156
Had to.

544
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:25,120
The management's acting like I
haven't been paying my hotel bill.

545
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:28,717
I hear you have stepped
on somebody's feet.

546
00:49:32,327 --> 00:49:33,885
What are they going to do with you?

547
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,604
Knock me off or buy me off,
it's up for grabs.

548
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,441
What do you want with me?

549
00:49:52,207 --> 00:49:54,846
You are going to take me
to Madame de Villemont.

550
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:12,796
For how much?

551
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:17,796
50 bucks.

552
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:20,163
- That's all?
- That's all I got.

553
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:22,564
Unless you'll let me
put you on a credit card.

554
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:41,760
The door on the end.

555
00:50:59,727 --> 00:51:01,285
Back to your room.

556
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:11,436
Open up!

557
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:06,765
The table's dead, the cues are
crooked, we're short on balls...

558
00:52:06,887 --> 00:52:09,321
but as they say back home,
it's the only game in town.

559
00:52:09,607 --> 00:52:10,676
Grab a stick.

560
00:52:13,487 --> 00:52:14,840
What the hell is your name again?

561
00:52:15,847 --> 00:52:17,599
Davis, Reno Davis.

562
00:52:18,087 --> 00:52:20,601
I'm bad on names,
remember the face.

563
00:52:21,127 --> 00:52:22,765
So, you joined the team?

564
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:25,278
If you can't lick 'em...

565
00:52:25,487 --> 00:52:28,320
You're gonna fit right in,
big strapping kid like you.

566
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:33,838
You'll work with me. This outfit's
got frogs and wasps and what have you.

567
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:36,601
But you and me will work the
American side of the street.

568
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,604
- Buck a point. Alright with you?
- Lf I win.

569
00:52:41,887 --> 00:52:43,605
You know when you're being hustled.

570
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:48,003
I told Leschenhaut the night we met
you had a lot of lead in your pencil.

571
00:52:48,327 --> 00:52:49,362
We ought to get you.

572
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:52,525
Leschenhaut?
He's the team captain.

573
00:52:53,127 --> 00:52:56,039
You better know it.
But I run things in the States.

574
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,235
How long since you been there?

575
00:52:58,687 --> 00:53:00,917
- Some time.
- You wouldn't know the place anymore.

576
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:03,326
Sex and smut.

577
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:05,759
Smut and sex.

578
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:08,718
The magazines, the movies...

579
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:11,401
Dirt to get you all worked up,
everywhere you look.

580
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:14,685
My own family doctors told me
sex is exhaustive and destructive.

581
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:17,077
It can damage your
nervous system and shorten life.

582
00:53:17,247 --> 00:53:18,362
We're going to stop it.

583
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:20,358
- Hey now, wait a minute Jesse.
- We mean business.

584
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:23,361
We've got weapons stashed
from New York to California.

585
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:25,120
9 mm machine guns...

586
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:27,522
easy to handle,
deadly accurate.

587
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:30,117
We've got rifle clubs and
minute men on the ready.

588
00:53:30,447 --> 00:53:31,926
We'll take the country back.

589
00:53:33,047 --> 00:53:35,436
Alright. You don't believe me.

590
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,361
You know what this is?

591
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:43,044
A list of commanders of action groups,
their names and addresses.

592
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:46,279
Half of them are in the States,
rest are in Leschenhaut's territory.

593
00:53:47,047 --> 00:53:49,515
So you see, we're not just
whistling through our teeth.

594
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:52,796
This boy is going to be
a red hot addition to my staff.

595
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:54,725
I like my men with flat guts...

596
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:56,564
clear eyes, clean finger nails.

597
00:53:56,687 --> 00:53:59,406
Mr. Davis was involved in
a killing yesterday in Paris.

598
00:53:59,887 --> 00:54:02,526
Now on the way to South America
just a few steps ahead of the police.

599
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:04,922
Damn! Let me give this some thought.
See if I can't come up with...

600
00:54:05,127 --> 00:54:08,085
a way of getting him back in
the country, by way of Mexico.

601
00:54:08,247 --> 00:54:10,397
We will work something out.

602
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,196
You will come with me.

603
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:21,161
You owe me 20 bucks.

604
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:26,200
If you're short on cash, get me
a 2 year subscription to Playboy.

605
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:32,247
You're a difficult man
to confine Mr. Davis.

606
00:54:32,887 --> 00:54:35,242
Actually I see no reason why you
shouldn't have the run of the house.

607
00:54:35,327 --> 00:54:36,806
Since escape from it is impossible.

608
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:40,525
Even if you managed that,
you'd be wasting your time.

609
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:45,518
You might tell your tale to
a diplomat, but he's ours.

610
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:48,761
You might get word to a newspaper,
but it belongs to us.

611
00:54:50,007 --> 00:54:53,602
Might even go to the police,
you'll find us there once more.

612
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:56,643
So if you wish to play games...

613
00:54:57,567 --> 00:55:00,001
please join me for
chess after dinner.

614
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:25,360
Can you make it to my room?

615
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:26,476
Yes.

616
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,525
- Are you ok?
- I will be.

617
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:39,159
Is my face badly marked?
I'm afraid to look at it.

618
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,439
Don't... for a couple of days.

619
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:45,886
He was wearing a ring
a heavy gold one.

620
00:55:46,047 --> 00:55:48,641
I gave it to him
on his 18th birthday.

621
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:52,039
Why don't you lie down for a while?

622
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:54,797
No. You have been very kind.

623
00:55:56,247 --> 00:55:58,203
They are going to murder you,
you know?

624
00:55:59,327 --> 00:56:03,115
It is planned that you and Anne will
be taken South by car tomorrow night.

625
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:06,199
There'll be an accident on the road.

626
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:10,203
The two of you will be found dead
at the foot of the mountain.

627
00:56:12,047 --> 00:56:13,162
Why the lady?

628
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:16,086
I thought she was a paid up
member in good standing.

629
00:56:16,727 --> 00:56:19,241
The Doctor suspects she's
having an affair with you.

630
00:56:19,727 --> 00:56:23,959
He has turned against her.
They're completely made. All of them!

631
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:25,676
Tell me.

632
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:29,041
I can help you...

633
00:56:32,007 --> 00:56:33,679
but, we must make a bargain.

634
00:56:35,007 --> 00:56:35,996
Like what?

635
00:56:36,367 --> 00:56:39,006
Edmond and I are going
to the village tonight.

636
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:41,159
We will be back at 9 o'clock.

637
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:46,044
You must be in the hallway by the
door when we step out of the car.

638
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:50,236
I will leave the motor running.
You take it and you get away.

639
00:56:51,647 --> 00:56:53,285
Let's get down to the nitty gritty.

640
00:56:54,847 --> 00:56:56,121
What do you want from me?

641
00:56:57,887 --> 00:56:59,878
You are going to kill Edmond.

642
00:57:04,407 --> 00:57:05,476
Lady, you play rough.

643
00:57:06,087 --> 00:57:08,043
There will be a gun
under the car seat.

644
00:57:08,287 --> 00:57:09,686
You will be close to him for a second.

645
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,720
- That is all the time you will need.
- One small point...

646
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:14,639
before we go cooking anybody's goose.

647
00:57:14,887 --> 00:57:18,197
Where have they got my little
friend stashed? Where's Paul?

648
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:21,079
I cannot tell you that.

649
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:25,243
Then you'll spend you're golden
wedding anniversary with lover boy.

650
00:57:25,687 --> 00:57:27,643
Unless he kicks the hell out of you
before you get there.

651
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:32,167
They child is with his
grandmother at the Villa Frascati...

652
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:34,361
their home by the lake.

653
00:57:35,207 --> 00:57:38,199
They'll be watching all the cars,
I need a train ticket.

654
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:40,958
It will be in the glove compartment.

655
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:46,920
Ok lady, you made yourself
a grizzly little deal.

656
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:52,238
I'll wear black for one year,
then dove grey and then white.

657
00:57:52,647 --> 00:57:54,399
As I did when I was a child.

658
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:58,323
I will take his gold cufflinks,
and his tie pins...

659
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:02,122
and his signet rings and have them
melted down to make a candle stick...

660
00:58:02,327 --> 00:58:03,646
for the church.

661
00:58:05,807 --> 00:58:07,525
What about the gold in his teeth?

662
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:20,323
Fire!
Fire!

663
00:58:40,007 --> 00:58:42,999
Let's get out of here.
I just set the house on fire!

664
00:58:46,207 --> 00:58:47,196
Wait!

665
00:58:49,087 --> 00:58:50,076
Let's go!

666
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:12,523
Dark glasses. You look more
conspicuous with them than without.

667
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,361
What the devil is going on?

668
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,076
I beg you...

669
00:59:34,727 --> 00:59:36,558
Stop him!
Kill him!

670
00:59:37,047 --> 00:59:38,446
It's the American!

671
00:59:53,847 --> 00:59:55,599
You can stop and let me out anytime.

672
00:59:57,887 --> 01:00:01,766
Where I go, you go.
Could be a long haul, so hang loose.

673
01:00:03,207 --> 01:00:04,196
I'll grow on you.

674
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:05,716
I doubt it.

675
01:00:05,807 --> 01:00:09,083
I'm missing something, Mr. Davis.
A small boy.

676
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:13,603
He started with you and never came
back, that doesn't endear you to me.

677
01:00:14,887 --> 01:00:16,639
I'm still your best bet, honey.

678
01:00:17,727 --> 01:00:19,877
Your in-laws were gonna
put our lights out.

679
01:00:21,007 --> 01:00:22,804
A car wreck on a mountain road.

680
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,437
We were scheduled to make
it for eternity.

681
01:00:28,687 --> 01:00:30,166
Last night they drank to my health.

682
01:00:31,247 --> 01:00:33,238
No wonder.
They knew how frail it was.

683
01:00:33,887 --> 01:00:35,081
We're gonna find Paul.

684
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:38,881
He's at a like house,
near Villa Frascati.

685
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:41,085
It's their summer house,
outside of Rome.

686
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,478
First thing we got to do
is dump this car.

687
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,280
See if there's
a railroad ticket in there?

688
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,677
There is. One to Villa Frascati.

689
01:00:55,287 --> 01:00:56,356
And 20 francs.

690
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:59,406
4 bucks? We can't get off
the ground with that.

691
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:00,995
What have you got?

692
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:07,238
Passport, peppermint life savers,
false eyelashes...

693
01:01:08,527 --> 01:01:09,960
That's all?

694
01:01:11,287 --> 01:01:13,881
No money, no cigarette case?
Nothing to hock?

695
01:01:16,247 --> 01:01:18,238
I thought you had 15 million.

696
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:20,125
I don't carry it around with me.

697
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,719
We're gonna have to do some
cheese pairing.

698
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:27,727
If we buy a candy bar, it'll get
split right down the middle.

699
01:01:28,287 --> 01:01:30,755
If there's only one bed,
I'll be in half of it.

700
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:33,959
You can have all of it.
I'll be on the floor.

701
01:01:35,967 --> 01:01:37,036
Suit yourself.

702
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,396
Get onboard.

703
01:01:46,487 --> 01:01:48,557
Go to the compartment.
If the berth isn't made up...

704
01:01:48,647 --> 01:01:51,081
tell you don't feel well
and have it made up.

705
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:52,961
Then dimple up to the Conductor...

706
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:55,163
have him settle the Customs
declaration first thing.

707
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,646
Where will you be?

708
01:01:57,087 --> 01:01:59,317
Getting our dinner.
What's the compartment number?

709
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:02,125
Compartment 2 car 8.

710
01:02:02,247 --> 01:02:04,477
- Good. See you there.
- What'll you do for a ticket?

711
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:05,756
Freeload.

712
01:02:05,927 --> 01:02:08,043
Have that fender fixed, and...

713
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:10,164
tell Bobby not to beat his sister.

714
01:02:25,247 --> 01:02:26,726
Two apples please.

715
01:02:34,007 --> 01:02:34,996
Hey monsieur!

716
01:03:00,847 --> 01:03:02,917
I'm almost glad to see you.

717
01:03:03,407 --> 01:03:06,922
- I was getting ready to panic.
- Save it. I'll tell you when.

718
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:09,766
The Conductor has my passport.
He's changing the money into lira.

719
01:03:10,047 --> 01:03:11,924
He said we'll be in Rome
at 3 in the morning...

720
01:03:12,047 --> 01:03:14,607
and we change trains to
Villa Frascati at 4.

721
01:03:16,407 --> 01:03:19,365
- He was helpful so I let him pinch me.
- He would have anyway.

722
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:23,086
- Where will you be when he comes back?
- We're gonna go to bed together.

723
01:03:23,727 --> 01:03:25,877
Sorry. Where else am I gonna hide.

724
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:28,596
Alright.

725
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:33,442
I don't want to be nosy but
have you got anything on under that?

726
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:34,836
Certainly.

727
01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:38,999
Get down to whatever it is and
hang the rest in plain sight.

728
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:41,316
Come on.

729
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:13,245
There isn't much room is there?

730
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:16,884
I don't think I could
fade back for a pass.

731
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:20,281
I trust not.

732
01:04:23,007 --> 01:04:25,077
Can you open the door from there?

733
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,725
- Yes.
- Ok.

734
01:04:29,287 --> 01:04:32,643
When the Conductor comes back,
open it like that.

735
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:38,081
Take the money and the passport
without letting him in.

736
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,637
I went squirrel hunting
in Maine once...

737
01:04:51,727 --> 01:04:55,037
and slept in a sleeping bag
with a girl named Bobo Henderson.

738
01:04:56,367 --> 01:04:58,323
I was 15, she was 14.

739
01:05:00,847 --> 01:05:03,407
- Did you get any squirrels?
- No...

740
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:06,319
I didn't get Bobo Henderson either.

741
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:09,641
Just as I was about to
her daddy happened by...

742
01:05:09,687 --> 01:05:13,600
and gave me the word, and the
business end of a shovel.

743
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:16,045
It was like that
all the time I was growing up.

744
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:18,756
Bad luck.

745
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:21,518
When did you finally bag your pray?

746
01:05:22,447 --> 01:05:23,800
I'm still working on it.

747
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:28,000
Washed your hair today, didn't you?

748
01:05:30,087 --> 01:05:31,076
Yes.

749
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:39,686
Smells good.
Makes my pulse whack a little.

750
01:05:41,287 --> 01:05:43,039
You also have bony ankles.

751
01:05:44,847 --> 01:05:46,678
I'm getting to know
quite a lot about you.

752
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:51,239
I also have a large mole
which you will not come upon.

753
01:05:51,807 --> 01:05:53,320
I'm sorry to hear it.

754
01:05:54,127 --> 01:05:57,085
- You don't even like me.
- Not a hell of a lot.

755
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:00,038
Still you'd make love to me,
wouldn't you?

756
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:05,240
Take any man in the country and
jam him against a woman...

757
01:06:05,367 --> 01:06:06,925
wearing half an ounce
of lace underwear...

758
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:08,321
Why don't you like me?

759
01:06:08,527 --> 01:06:11,041
Because you're about
as dangerous as an open manhole.

760
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:14,167
A lot of guys have dropped in
and never been heard from again.

761
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:17,078
Take the late Sidney Scott?

762
01:06:19,527 --> 01:06:22,200
They drowned him in a bathtub.
Like they'd drown an animal.

763
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:28,646
Then they threw his body in the Seine,
because he wanted to help me and Paul.

764
01:06:29,207 --> 01:06:32,005
What about your husband?
You didn't pull the plug on him?

765
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:46,086
I have your passport, Madame and
I have changed you money to lira.

766
01:06:46,727 --> 01:06:47,716
Thank you.

767
01:06:48,287 --> 01:06:51,518
I am afraid you will have to
sign your receipt for the money.

768
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,686
I'm in bed, as you can see.

769
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:55,564
Nonetheless, Madame.

770
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:58,556
Very well.

771
01:07:09,687 --> 01:07:11,598
You appear to be staring at me.

772
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:13,725
Madame for 30 years my wife...

773
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:18,198
has worn a green flannel
nightdress to bed, a tent...

774
01:07:18,487 --> 01:07:21,524
with a high neck, long sleeves
and many, many buttons.

775
01:07:22,407 --> 01:07:25,444
Naturally I stare.
Do you blame me.

776
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:26,836
No indeed.

777
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:31,916
Thank you.

778
01:07:39,447 --> 01:07:41,915
- You keep your cool, don't you?
- Yes.

779
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:48,242
And I intend to see you keep yours.

780
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:08,520
Look out the window and
tell me what you see.

781
01:08:16,487 --> 01:08:18,159
I see a man eating a sandwich.

782
01:08:18,407 --> 01:08:19,886
Oh I wish I had one.

783
01:08:20,447 --> 01:08:21,436
What else?

784
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:28,482
I see two men with raincoats
at the exit gate.

785
01:08:29,007 --> 01:08:30,884
They're checking everyone
that goes through.

786
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,599
One of them is
looking at a newspaper.

787
01:08:37,007 --> 01:08:38,599
I made the front page last night.

788
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:41,318
Then they're the police.
How are we going to get through?

789
01:09:20,247 --> 01:09:21,236
Watch out!

790
01:09:25,007 --> 01:09:26,360
Watch out morons!

791
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:29,357
Get out of the way!

792
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,918
Morons! You know who
you're talking to?

793
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:33,276
Forget it.

794
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:35,755
Get going.

795
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:41,081
The train for Villa Frascati please?

796
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,807
It's too late for that train now.

797
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:46,197
The train for Frascati at this time...

798
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,675
What held you up?

799
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,122
I freshened up and then
I bought a lipstick.

800
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:28,476
- Lady, we only have 4 bucks!
- I bought a toothbrush too...

801
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:31,519
and a comb and soap
and a razor for you.

802
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:33,086
It just made me feel better.

803
01:10:54,807 --> 01:10:56,923
I have nothing of
any great value my son.

804
01:10:58,647 --> 01:10:59,636
What are you looking for?

805
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:07,395
Maybe a pistol padre.

806
01:11:08,327 --> 01:11:11,763
- A man of God with a gun?
- A man of God with a manicure?

807
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:15,915
There's a reason for
my hands being as they are.

808
01:11:16,887 --> 01:11:20,562
I am Fra Pietra de Chioggia,
gardener of our monastery.

809
01:11:20,807 --> 01:11:24,117
I was given the honour or
presenting some of these bulbs...

810
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:25,920
to his Holiness in person.

811
01:11:26,327 --> 01:11:29,080
When arrived in Rome yesterday
I noticed my nails...

812
01:11:29,247 --> 01:11:33,320
were a disgusting sight,
so I did this extraordinary thing...

813
01:11:34,047 --> 01:11:35,924
for the first time in my life.

814
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:40,716
Who are we gonna run into?

815
01:12:40,927 --> 01:12:43,885
Senora Braggi, the caretaker.
There shouldn't be anyone else.

816
01:12:44,647 --> 01:12:47,161
Wait a minute.
In case there is...

817
01:12:47,607 --> 01:12:49,802
Be careful. I want Paul
back just the way she was...

818
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:52,363
with nothing but a vaccination mark.

819
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:53,796
That's the way I want him.

820
01:13:21,247 --> 01:13:24,239
- Who's in the cottage?
- Only Mama.

821
01:13:50,127 --> 01:13:52,004
You ought to get this kid
to help with the housework...

822
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:53,395
instead of working on her suntan.

823
01:13:53,607 --> 01:13:56,679
What are you doing going
around naked?

824
01:13:57,487 --> 01:13:59,398
- Take your hands off her!
- Where's my son?

825
01:13:59,927 --> 01:14:02,964
- Senora De Villemont, so it's you...
- Where's my son?

826
01:14:03,247 --> 01:14:06,956
Gone. Dr. Morillon himself
came to take the child away.

827
01:14:07,367 --> 01:14:10,245
- Where did they take him?
- I have no idea.

828
01:14:10,407 --> 01:14:12,284
You better give your memory
a little jog Mama.

829
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:13,846
This thing's got a big bite.

830
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,119
You'll get nothing from me.

831
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,517
Give me a hunk of that
clothes line, tie her up.

832
01:14:21,407 --> 01:14:22,396
Sit down.

833
01:14:23,207 --> 01:14:24,526
What are you going to do?

834
01:14:25,287 --> 01:14:28,677
- Even if you torture me, I won't speak.
- Sit down!

835
01:14:29,287 --> 01:14:30,436
The only kind of torture I know...

836
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,643
is when the laundry
shrinks my jockey shorts.

837
01:14:33,847 --> 01:14:38,204
I'm just gonna kill some time.
Mess around a little bit.

838
01:14:40,847 --> 01:14:42,200
What's your name honey?

839
01:14:44,327 --> 01:14:45,316
Daniela.

840
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:48,319
Tell you what Daniela...

841
01:14:49,247 --> 01:14:53,877
We're gonna go in the other
room, you and me. Do some wrestling.

842
01:14:55,687 --> 01:14:57,439
Two falls out of three, eh pussy?

843
01:14:59,367 --> 01:15:00,356
Murderer!

844
01:15:01,887 --> 01:15:05,243
God himself will strike you down
if you harm that girl.

845
01:15:05,607 --> 01:15:07,120
Where did they take the kid?

846
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,246
Burn in hell!

847
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:30,595
You're not scared?

848
01:15:31,767 --> 01:15:33,166
What can I do?

849
01:15:34,487 --> 01:15:35,636
You have a gun.

850
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:38,276
Besides...

851
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,603
I've had a long boring summer.

852
01:15:45,647 --> 01:15:46,716
Ay! You bastard! That hurt!

853
01:15:46,887 --> 01:15:48,115
Let her alone!

854
01:15:48,847 --> 01:15:51,361
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you what you want to know!

855
01:15:54,647 --> 01:15:58,037
Now you stay in here
and keep your mouth shut.

856
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:13,486
The child was taken back to Rome,
to the Villa Montecastallani.

857
01:16:14,007 --> 01:16:15,156
An hour ago.

858
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:36,521
No! That would be a mistake!

859
01:16:41,967 --> 01:16:45,846
It's no longer Fra Pietro, I'm afraid.
I am Pietro Rossi.

860
01:16:46,887 --> 01:16:51,199
I regret that I'm not the gentle
brother, so benevolent so simple.

861
01:16:51,847 --> 01:16:53,439
So different from myself.

862
01:16:54,207 --> 01:16:55,879
It's a role I enjoy playing.

863
01:16:57,127 --> 01:16:58,719
Now I take your gun.

864
01:17:06,087 --> 01:17:10,365
Very well, We just wait.
It won't be long.

865
01:17:42,687 --> 01:17:45,406
Your boyfriend didn't bring any
two pound box of chocolate this trip.

866
01:17:45,847 --> 01:17:47,246
Why is he going in the house?

867
01:17:47,847 --> 01:17:50,486
It's gonna be a nasty accident.
He doesn't want any witnesses.

868
01:17:51,207 --> 01:17:52,356
What can we do?

869
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:54,879
You think of something,
you've been in the sack with him.

870
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:57,036
Yes I have.

871
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:01,643
You should have tried harder honey.
We might have made it to Medicare.

872
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,799
Let's not face each other with guns.

873
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:30,645
I've had my man put his away.

874
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:38,125
Don't you think the time has come
to come to an understanding?

875
01:18:39,967 --> 01:18:41,036
Can we talk?

876
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:55,882
How tired you look. All this
running in circles, so pointless.

877
01:18:57,127 --> 01:18:59,163
I'm sure you're planning
a long rest for me.

878
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:01,883
Last time it was to be
a car wreck in the mountains.

879
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:04,483
What is it to be now?
A drowning in the lake?

880
01:19:04,927 --> 01:19:09,364
If you persist in these delusions
you'll end up in the madhouse.

881
01:19:10,087 --> 01:19:11,964
I've been living in one with you.

882
01:19:12,687 --> 01:19:15,838
My I present my husband of 10 years.

883
01:19:16,607 --> 01:19:19,246
General Sebastian
Henri René de Villemont...

884
01:19:19,407 --> 01:19:23,320
6 times decorates, 3 times wounded,
Chevalier of France...

885
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:27,362
a butcher in blood up to his armpits
for the sake of the New Order.

886
01:19:27,927 --> 01:19:30,919
A father who turned over his own son
to a bunch of fascist bastards...

887
01:19:31,007 --> 01:19:32,201
to save his own hide.

888
01:19:32,327 --> 01:19:34,887
He's a hero and a half
my General de Villemont!

889
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:36,356
Yes.

890
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:40,162
If I die, Paul will die.

891
01:19:41,927 --> 01:19:44,600
Do you think I love our son
any less than you?

892
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:47,484
If I hadn't agreed to
this terrible arrangement...

893
01:19:47,567 --> 01:19:51,606
you would have gladly sent me to
the guillotine long ago.

894
01:19:52,807 --> 01:19:56,163
You would have betrayed the one
movement capable of making...

895
01:19:56,287 --> 01:19:58,801
this world a fit place for my son!

896
01:20:01,247 --> 01:20:03,078
You have some papers belonging to me.

897
01:20:03,447 --> 01:20:04,516
Is that right?

898
01:20:05,127 --> 01:20:07,687
For all I know, all I got on
me is my driver's license.

899
01:20:08,367 --> 01:20:09,800
You know exactly what I mean.

900
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:15,125
You stole a list of names from
a rather stupid countryman of yours.

901
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:17,683
Oh yeah. Those papers.

902
01:20:23,927 --> 01:20:24,916
I want them!

903
01:20:55,047 --> 01:20:57,038
There's brandy up at the house.
Let's tie into it.

904
01:21:07,007 --> 01:21:10,682
The marriage ended for me in Algeria
when he planned his own death.

905
01:21:12,087 --> 01:21:15,636
He went underground to collect
his army of crackpots...

906
01:21:17,287 --> 01:21:20,438
and he picked a boy of 25 to die...

907
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:22,839
just because he looked like him.

908
01:21:23,287 --> 01:21:26,996
- And plastic surgery did the rest.
- You want another shot of this?

909
01:21:27,927 --> 01:21:30,805
No, Paul is only an hour ahead of us.

910
01:21:30,967 --> 01:21:32,605
I don't want to lose time.

911
01:21:33,407 --> 01:21:35,284
We're short on cash.
It's a long walk.

912
01:21:35,887 --> 01:21:40,199
His sister keeps a car, that she
uses only for weddings and funerals.

913
01:21:43,127 --> 01:21:46,676
I'm not in the market for either one.
But let's grab it.

914
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,402
Don't worry. He'll be alright.

915
01:22:53,567 --> 01:22:54,556
Hungry?

916
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:58,518
No, and we'll need what money
we have to buy gas.

917
01:23:00,207 --> 01:23:01,686
Funny you should bring that up...

918
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:22,117
That's all we got left.
It adds up to 1 American cent.

919
01:23:22,647 --> 01:23:24,877
Not even enough to put on
a dead man's eyes.

920
01:23:30,447 --> 01:23:33,803
- Come on. We've got a long walk.
- Then what?

921
01:23:34,647 --> 01:23:36,365
We attack by night.

922
01:24:08,287 --> 01:24:10,005
I don't think we should do it.

923
01:24:10,687 --> 01:24:12,120
We need gas don't we.

924
01:24:13,047 --> 01:24:14,844
This money goes to charity.

925
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:18,242
It's gravy for the guys
that clean the fountain!

926
01:24:20,647 --> 01:24:24,560
Anyway, if it's for the needy,
I'm sure as hell one of them.

927
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:28,316
Wade in.

928
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:53,806
How much have we got?

929
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:56,803
This only gives us
driving around money.

930
01:24:57,007 --> 01:24:59,157
Half of what I'm getting
are bottle caps.

931
01:25:00,287 --> 01:25:03,120
How can people be so damn dishonest?

932
01:25:08,807 --> 01:25:09,876
We got company.

933
01:25:10,087 --> 01:25:12,043
- Where?
- Don't turn around!

934
01:25:12,327 --> 01:25:13,476
You're about to be kissed.

935
01:25:13,887 --> 01:25:16,276
And unless you want to spend
the night in the pokey...

936
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:18,881
I suggest you give it all
you got and then some.

937
01:25:22,487 --> 01:25:25,047
Hey Marcello, Sofia!

938
01:25:26,807 --> 01:25:28,286
Good evening officer.

939
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:33,437
There aren't enough park benches?

940
01:25:33,687 --> 01:25:37,521
There aren't enough hotel rooms?
What are you doing in there?

941
01:25:37,927 --> 01:25:41,636
We just come over from Philadelphia.
We're Americans.

942
01:25:42,127 --> 01:25:44,846
Welcome.
How would you like to go to jail?

943
01:25:45,487 --> 01:25:48,957
I can explain this. Of course
it might sound a little funny...

944
01:25:49,527 --> 01:25:53,406
If it's funny I laugh, otherwise
you pay a very large fine.

945
01:25:55,407 --> 01:25:56,396
Well...

946
01:25:57,887 --> 01:26:01,038
My wife Mildred here got a hold of
one of those sex books by a doctor.

947
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:05,524
It says anything 2 people want to
try is Ok, as long as both enjoy it.

948
01:26:06,367 --> 01:26:07,846
You're enjoying this?

949
01:26:08,407 --> 01:26:09,476
Well, officer...

950
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:12,482
once Mildred gets
a bee in her bonnet...

951
01:26:13,607 --> 01:26:16,075
I have 11 children.

952
01:26:16,327 --> 01:26:19,160
All of them conceived
in the same double bed...

953
01:26:19,367 --> 01:26:23,121
with the door closed,
blinds drawn and the lights out.

954
01:26:24,487 --> 01:26:26,443
No embellishments were necessary.

955
01:26:26,567 --> 01:26:28,000
Get out of the fountain!

956
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:29,725
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

957
01:26:56,807 --> 01:27:00,277
You got to give them this:
They like their houses roomy.

958
01:27:01,127 --> 01:27:05,405
No. Drive round the block a
few times. We need an outside man.

959
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:24,999
Mr. Davis, how nice.

960
01:27:26,607 --> 01:27:28,086
We were expecting you.

961
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:48,443
I get the feeling the former
occupants were inclined to meditate.

962
01:27:48,807 --> 01:27:50,126
Quite right, Mr. Davis.

963
01:27:50,327 --> 01:27:53,046
This was once a seminary.
Curious, isn't it?

964
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,757
That was a room for contemplation.

965
01:27:57,607 --> 01:27:59,916
Now it's our communications center.

966
01:28:00,887 --> 01:28:02,843
- You will see Mr. Davis...
- Yeah?

967
01:28:04,127 --> 01:28:05,446
We also have a mission.

968
01:28:05,767 --> 01:28:09,885
Yeah? Where's the fat man?
At his prayers?

969
01:28:11,327 --> 01:28:13,841
- Well hardly.
- He better be.

970
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:35,281
I had hoped to see the last of you...

971
01:28:36,087 --> 01:28:38,647
instead you did away with two
of my most trusted friends.

972
01:28:38,807 --> 01:28:40,957
Run out boy and
fetch us some Champagne.

973
01:28:41,927 --> 01:28:43,485
Would you care for some fruit?

974
01:28:43,847 --> 01:28:47,681
These black grapes
come from my garden.

975
01:28:47,847 --> 01:28:49,166
They're quite harmless.

976
01:28:50,647 --> 01:28:52,126
Where will I spit the pits?

977
01:28:52,287 --> 01:28:54,323
I've very little else to
offer you I'm afraid.

978
01:28:54,487 --> 01:28:59,436
We strive for the aesthetic life.
Simple food, simple pleasures.

979
01:28:59,647 --> 01:29:01,000
Sounds simpleminded.

980
01:29:01,487 --> 01:29:05,002
A bit simpleminded of you,
wasn't it? To come here?

981
01:29:07,487 --> 01:29:08,556
You'll never leave, you know.

982
01:29:09,047 --> 01:29:13,563
Oh, I'll leave chum. I got something
tucked away you're real hot for.

983
01:29:14,727 --> 01:29:17,195
- Now what could that be?
- A list.

984
01:29:22,927 --> 01:29:23,916
Yes...

985
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:27,522
that is one thing that
leaves me rather vulnerable.

986
01:29:27,807 --> 01:29:30,446
Yeah.
It's a meat hook right through you.

987
01:29:30,687 --> 01:29:33,565
Mama, I take it, has the valuables.

988
01:29:34,847 --> 01:29:35,916
And the price?

989
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:38,156
Cheap.

990
01:29:40,327 --> 01:29:41,760
You hand over the boy.

991
01:29:45,527 --> 01:29:48,564
I'm not a graceful loser.
Childish, isn't it?

992
01:29:49,487 --> 01:29:51,603
Suck your thumb
if you'll feel better.

993
01:29:52,287 --> 01:29:55,404
The boy isn't far away. We could
finish our business in half an hour.

994
01:29:59,207 --> 01:30:02,358
Not here.
I want elbow room, lots of it.

995
01:30:06,127 --> 01:30:07,480
What about the Colosseum?

996
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:09,886
What could be roomier?

997
01:30:11,247 --> 01:30:12,316
Shall we say at dawn?

998
01:30:16,127 --> 01:30:17,480
You do want the boy?

999
01:30:20,687 --> 01:30:21,961
Meet you in the royal box.

1000
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:34,085
I must say Mr. Davis, this precaution
shows a deplorable lack of trust.

1001
01:30:35,367 --> 01:30:37,756
I don't want to hurt your feelings
but let's face it...

1002
01:30:38,007 --> 01:30:40,362
You are a sneaky,
murderous old bastard.

1003
01:30:42,327 --> 01:30:43,316
Yes.

1004
01:30:50,207 --> 01:30:52,767
I assume you'll rely
on my skills in the morning.

1005
01:30:53,807 --> 01:30:55,684
Your skills? Oh no...

1006
01:30:56,647 --> 01:30:59,320
I have more exotic plans
for the Colosseum.

1007
01:31:00,767 --> 01:31:02,246
I insist on being there.

1008
01:31:02,887 --> 01:31:04,206
You are the saucy one.

1009
01:31:04,327 --> 01:31:06,158
- Well I witnessed the murder.
- Who's murder?

1010
01:31:06,287 --> 01:31:09,245
Mr. Davis' friend. I know it was
you behind the door, that you did it.

1011
01:31:09,367 --> 01:31:11,119
My testimony
could clear the American.

1012
01:31:11,207 --> 01:31:13,801
This is how you repay your
indulgent old protector?

1013
01:31:13,887 --> 01:31:17,004
Is there some trinket from Cartier's
I've neglected to buy you?

1014
01:31:17,167 --> 01:31:20,762
I think I'm entitled to due respect
now that I'm basic to your survival.

1015
01:31:20,887 --> 01:31:24,596
My dear, being basic to my survival
can be very dangerous.

1016
01:31:24,967 --> 01:31:26,878
Besides, what is Mr. Davis
to fear from the Law.

1017
01:31:27,007 --> 01:31:30,044
Before the sun has
cleared the Roman rooftops...

1018
01:31:31,967 --> 01:31:33,036
he'll be dead.

1019
01:31:52,247 --> 01:31:57,162
When in Rome, live it up.

1020
01:31:57,727 --> 01:32:00,639
Wait half an hour, if you haven't
heard from me call your embassy.

1021
01:32:02,047 --> 01:32:03,685
I'd rather not think about that.

1022
01:32:04,527 --> 01:32:06,358
Or am I getting in over my head.

1023
01:32:08,807 --> 01:32:10,445
What's given is given lady.

1024
01:33:46,567 --> 01:33:48,523
You're in the wrong ballpark
aren't you sweets?

1025
01:34:01,287 --> 01:34:03,243
I play all sorts of games, Mr. Davis.

1026
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:06,884
Leschenhaut pulled a switch, huh?

1027
01:34:07,207 --> 01:34:09,801
No. This satisfies a personal need.

1028
01:36:34,087 --> 01:36:35,076
Paul!

1029
01:36:45,727 --> 01:36:47,285
Where are my documents?

1030
01:36:51,207 --> 01:36:52,276
So is he.

1031
01:36:53,727 --> 01:36:54,716
I don't see him.

1032
01:37:09,087 --> 01:37:10,076
Paul.

1033
01:37:13,847 --> 01:37:14,916
He's going to kill you.

1034
01:37:17,247 --> 01:37:18,919
I've told him to kill you.

1035
01:37:19,647 --> 01:37:24,357
He must do it.
He knows he must kill you.

1036
01:37:26,087 --> 01:37:28,806
I've told him how
you murdered his doctor.

1037
01:37:30,127 --> 01:37:33,199
I've told him of the blood congealed
around those dreadful wounds.

1038
01:37:34,767 --> 01:37:36,280
He knows what he must do.

1039
01:37:37,127 --> 01:37:39,766
He knows what his honour
and his pride demand.

1040
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:42,118
His great name demands.

1041
01:37:43,327 --> 01:37:45,045
He is determined to kill you.

1042
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:47,596
He must.

1043
01:37:48,927 --> 01:37:49,916
He will.

1044
01:37:54,647 --> 01:37:55,841
Now.

1045
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:58,475
At this moment.

1046
01:38:35,847 --> 01:38:36,836
French police?

1047
01:38:37,007 --> 01:38:39,646
No exactly.
Counterespionage.

1048
01:38:40,527 --> 01:38:44,236
As you may have surmised we've been
interested in this for some time.

1049
01:38:44,367 --> 01:38:45,880
I haven't surmised a damn thing.

1050
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:48,637
In any case,
we've picked up the others...

1051
01:38:48,727 --> 01:38:51,161
as they were following you
and the lady to the hotel.

1052
01:38:51,367 --> 01:38:53,961
- Where is she?
- In my car, outside.

1053
01:38:56,961 --> 01:39:00,961
