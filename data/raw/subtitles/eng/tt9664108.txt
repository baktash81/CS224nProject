2
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:10,006
As the Earth continues to heat up

3
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,502
and devastating droughts
and famine plague the population,

4
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:17,863
science is looking for a new planet
on which human life can thrive.

5
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,067
And it finds that in year 2063.

6
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:27,706
The blue
indicates water.

7
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,475
The red is oxygen.

8
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:34,278
This is our best chance
to find a habitable planet.

9
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:35,881
One we can colonize

10
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:39,517
and so ensure the
survival of our species.

11
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:41,854
With the deteriorating
situation here on Earth,

12
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,188
it's essential we send
a scouting mission

13
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:46,959
as soon as possible.

14
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:50,361
The voyage there will
take 86 years.

15
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:53,197
So, the crew will
reproduce onboard the ship,

16
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:57,335
and their grandchildren will be
the ones who reach the planet.

17
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,784
Nobel
laureate in physics,

18
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:18,691
say hello to
MIT bio-engineer.

19
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:56,595
Our first challenge was finding
30 qualified crew members

20
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:59,430
able to cope with the stress
of prolonged confinement.

21
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:02,534
That and the knowledge that
they won't be coming back.

22
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:06,504
Our solution,
breed and raise our own crew.

23
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:09,875
Train them in isolation
so they won't miss Earth.

24
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:12,443
Then the next
step is to assess

25
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,047
when they'll be
ready to go.

26
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,449
The younger they are,
the longer we can conserve resources

27
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:21,352
and extend the timeline
of the mission.

28
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:24,388
But they will be on
the ship alone.

29
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:26,759
And while I have every
confidence in our education

30
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,326
and management system,

31
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:32,664
I'm most concerned
that they

32
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:33,832
be able to combat
the dangers

33
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,500
they may face
along the way.

34
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,338
Some we're just
beginning to understand.

35
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,885
<i>Decontamination complete.</i>

36
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,839
- Richard!
- Richard!

37
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,144
Richard.

38
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:59,450
How would you
solve that one?

39
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:10,028
Good.

40
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:17,836
Sleep well,
Christopher.

41
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,939
Sleep well, Sela.

42
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,074
Sleep well, Zac.

43
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:24,877
I'm scared.

44
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:27,613
Of what?

45
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:29,513
I don't know.

46
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:31,016
There's nothing
to be scared of.

47
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:33,451
You're safe.

48
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:41,593
I want
to go with them.

49
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,163
It's a one-way
trip, Richard.

50
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:47,431
There is no
coming back.

51
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:48,767
You'll die up there.

52
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,936
I'll die down
here eventually.

53
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:52,871
Seems the same
to me.

54
00:05:52,905 --> 00:05:55,607
The whole reason
we're raising them this way

55
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,542
is for their
mental health.

56
00:05:57,576 --> 00:06:01,947
So they don't miss wide open
spaces, sunlight, people.

57
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,749
Now you,
on the other hand,

58
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:04,650
are going to have a hard
time dealing with...

59
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:05,951
I wouldn't miss a thing.

60
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,154
It's not part
of the plan.

61
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:11,690
I know, I know,
but think of it like this.

62
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:13,759
You'll be able
to launch sooner

63
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:15,794
if I go with them.

64
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:19,463
Four years instead
of seven.

65
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,602
Someone should be
there to raise them.

66
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:26,504
To protect them.

67
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,509
You know I'm right.

68
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,786
<i>T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

69
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,924
<i>We are go for launch.
13, 12, 11...</i>

70
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,826
<i>Switch from GLC to OBC.</i>

71
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:51,563
<i>...6, 5...</i>

72
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,532
<i>Go main engines.</i>

73
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:56,168
<i>...3, 2, 1...</i>

74
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:43,048
- All right.
- You good?

75
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:44,282
Yeah.

76
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:45,984
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

77
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,157
<i>Hatch closing.</i>

78
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:25,790
TEN YEARS LATER

79
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:18,677
<i>You are the link between past</i>

80
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,679
<i>and future generations</i>

81
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:22,981
<i>and have been entrusted with
the survival of our species.</i>

82
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:24,983
<i>You will have children
onboard the ship,</i>

83
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:27,719
<i>and your grandchildren will be
the ones to reach the planet.</i>

84
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:29,421
<i>On-ship reproduction will occur</i>

85
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:32,057
<i>via artificial fertilization
and incubation</i>

86
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,161
<i>during each generation's 24th year
in order to maximize resources.</i>

87
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:06,785
<i>Well, we're the first generation,
so we won't ever see the planet.</i>

88
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:08,186
We'll never know
what they discover.

89
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,488
That's true.

90
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:12,824
Our lives
are unimportant.

91
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:14,859
No, your life,

92
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:16,895
my life is as
important as anyone's.

93
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:18,763
Here or on Earth.

94
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,135
Let me show
you something.

95
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,174
Not supposed to let
anyone see these.

96
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:34,179
That is my father
and his parents.

97
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:36,147
My grandparents.

98
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:39,417
I never knew them,
but I know they lived an honest life.

99
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:43,154
You know, they took care of their
family, they provided for the future.

100
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:44,889
That's all any
of us can do.

101
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:52,223
What's up?

102
00:12:52,257 --> 00:12:53,992
There's a toxin in
the irrigation water.

103
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:58,430
Well, replace the filter
and test it again.

104
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:00,932
It's coming from us,
it's in our urine.

105
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,067
Yeah, it's from
something we've eaten.

106
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,637
Are we eating
something toxic?

107
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,940
Maybe toxic for a plant
that relies solely on water,

108
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:10,075
but you're stronger
than that.

109
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:14,412
What is it?
What's the chemical?

110
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:17,082
I don't know.
Just change that filter.

111
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:35,333
Hey.

112
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,602
What do you
make of this?

113
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:40,573
It's an ingredient
in something we eat.

114
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,510
Why would that
be unavailable?

115
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:57,122
Let's go.

116
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:12,237
How'd you get
past the firewall?

117
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,573
By connecting
directly to the processor.

118
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:16,675
It's the same way I got
into the design plans.

119
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:24,949
- Hmm.
- Try "Nutrition."

120
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:28,587
It's not there.

121
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:30,221
Is it some kind
of vitamin?

122
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:31,256
Maybe

123
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,124
medication.

124
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:39,297
Here we go.

125
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:47,673
"...the active ingredient
in daily beverage A.02."

126
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,109
"Combine with blue
alkaline syrup

127
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:52,277
"to counter
stomach irritation."

128
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,311
Blue.

129
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:55,480
It's the blue.

130
00:14:57,315 --> 00:15:00,151
"...effect is enhanced when
consuming it with food."

131
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:02,387
What effect?

132
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,023
I thought it was just
an enzyme for digestion.

133
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:11,196
"...personality
becomes dull and docile..."

134
00:15:11,229 --> 00:15:14,700
"...eliminates sexual
desire and sensation..."

135
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,434
"...decreased pleasure
response..."

136
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:18,470
Decreased pleasure
response?

137
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:22,140
I want
increased pleasure.

138
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:26,044
They're drugging us.

139
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,317
So they
can control us.

140
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:34,219
Pacify us.

141
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:38,189
They don't want us
to reproduce naturally.

142
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:39,725
They don't want us
to have sexual relations.

143
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:43,194
So we don't feel what
that feels like.

144
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:45,163
And so we don't
overpopulate the ship.

145
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:47,065
To conserve food.

146
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:49,535
I don't care.

147
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:51,604
I'm not
drinking it.

148
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:05,483
So, Richard
lied to you.

149
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:07,686
The mission lies.

150
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,387
What else aren't
they telling us?

151
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,192
Well, Christopher found
a hidden compartment.

152
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:15,393
In the
ship's plans.

153
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:16,729
Where is it?

154
00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:19,264
In Pod-23.

155
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:20,633
Unmarked behind
a wall.

156
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:23,569
What's inside?

157
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:25,103
I don't know yet.

158
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,437
Don't tell Richard
you went off the blue.

159
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:28,506
He's going to force
them back on it anyway.

160
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,276
Yeah, maybe. By then,
we'll know what it feels like.

161
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,444
What does it
feel like?

162
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:35,246
Has anything changed
since you stopped?

163
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,348
- Yes, but...
- Where's my pleasure?

164
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:46,457
Here.

165
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:50,663
Ow.

166
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:55,768
A little jolt.

167
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:57,435
- A bolt.
- A bite.

168
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:59,170
You know that's a
waste of electricity.

169
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:02,473
Go away.

170
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,376
So...

171
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:09,480
What have you been thinking
about since our last session?

172
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:12,183
Nothing.

173
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:15,621
Come on,
nothing?

174
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:18,523
Well, I guess
I was wondering

175
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:19,625
why do you lie to us?

176
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:23,127
What do you think
I lied about?

177
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:24,697
Well, I found
out that...

178
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:28,399
What?

179
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:33,404
There's an unmarked
compartment.

180
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,875
Pod-23.

181
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:40,746
Well, mission withholds certain
information for various reasons.

182
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:42,548
You know,
even from me.

183
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:45,249
It's not quite lying,

184
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:47,553
but I get what you mean.

185
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:49,622
How'd you find it?

186
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:54,392
I just did.
What's inside?

187
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:57,362
I don't know.

188
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:59,765
I don't know. It must be
for the third generation.

189
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:02,166
But why's it hidden?
Aren't you curious?

190
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,201
I am...

191
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:06,471
It's probably
reserved for them.

192
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:08,774
It's for
your grandchildren.

193
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:12,176
That's a profound thought.

194
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,946
I mean, you're going
to have children,

195
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:15,581
and you're going
to have grandchildren.

196
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,149
What do you
think about that?

197
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:25,824
Yeah,
they're normal kids.

198
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:27,860
They're sensitive
and smart

199
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:30,395
which means they know when I'm
not telling them the truth.

200
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:32,798
And that's my point.

201
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,901
I want to be honest with
them about everything.

202
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:41,940
Otherwise, they'll lose
faith in me.

203
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:46,645
So...

204
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,748
I'm going to need a quick
response from you on this.

205
00:18:49,782 --> 00:18:50,949
That's all for now.

206
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,891
Sela?

207
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,761
What?

208
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:11,697
You look different.

209
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:13,832
I'm the same.

210
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:15,901
No, you're not.
Neither am I.

211
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:19,370
What are you
talking about?

212
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:20,773
I don't know.
You've changed.

213
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,273
Everything about you.

214
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:24,475
Yeah, I've grown up.

215
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:28,680
That's exactly what I
want to talk to you about.

216
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:30,582
You have, but you're not
feeling what I'm feeling.

217
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:31,750
No grabbing, Zac.

218
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:36,487
I wasn't grabbing.

219
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:37,723
Easy with the hands.
You know the rules.

220
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:08,319
Yeah!

221
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,763
Yeah!

222
00:22:00,105 --> 00:22:02,174
C'mon.

223
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:03,742
I hate
those noises.

224
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,941
Anything?

225
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:37,576
No.

226
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:39,578
So what's causing
the sounds?

227
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:41,179
Richard says
it's the cooling

228
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:42,814
and contracting of the
ship when we power down.

229
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:44,616
I don't think the
temperature differential

230
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,752
is enough to affect
the structure that way.

231
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:48,519
Plus, Richard's a liar.

232
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:53,524
So what is it?

233
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:55,928
You think it's something
on the outside, don't you?

234
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:58,563
If there's life on the
planet, why not out here?

235
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,633
What else can
explain those sounds?

236
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,058
What is it?

237
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:28,193
Sage.

238
00:23:28,226 --> 00:23:30,494
Plant that grows
in warm climates.

239
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:40,706
Pine needles.

240
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,842
- It's beautiful.
- Hmm.

241
00:24:29,588 --> 00:24:30,922
You see that?

242
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:35,060
He can touch her.
But I can't.

243
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:52,177
We've lost
contact with Earth

244
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,014
because overnight there was a
malfunction in the LCT transmitter.

245
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:57,582
I'll have to go
exterior to fix it.

246
00:24:57,616 --> 00:24:59,051
Zac will come with me.

247
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:01,720
And the rest of you
know your roles.

248
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:07,626
Right here.

249
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:11,630
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

250
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,950
This sensor goes on your
wrist and it attaches here,

251
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:33,351
but it's tricky because
it can come loose,

252
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:34,586
so just
make sure...

253
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:39,391
Make sure you
pull the cuff over

254
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:41,159
the inner sleeve
so that it...

255
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:00,846
Hey! Hey! Hey!

256
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:04,149
What's happening here?
Zac, what are you doing?

257
00:26:06,284 --> 00:26:08,386
You're going to lose food rations if
you don't tell me what's going on.

258
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,721
You okay?

259
00:26:09,754 --> 00:26:10,922
I'm fine.

260
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:13,792
Zac!

261
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:24,202
Zac.

262
00:26:32,244 --> 00:26:33,245
Zac.

263
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,182
Phoebe, have you
seen Zac?

264
00:26:37,215 --> 00:26:39,718
No. But I heard
what he did.

265
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:41,253
Has he done anything
like that before?

266
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:43,855
I don't know,
but he stopped taking the blue.

267
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:48,093
Are you sure?

268
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:49,895
I saw him
pour it out.

269
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:54,099
Christopher.

270
00:26:55,901 --> 00:26:57,035
You seen Zac?

271
00:26:58,904 --> 00:27:00,305
You heard
what he did?

272
00:27:02,741 --> 00:27:04,309
Oh, you think
that's okay?

273
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:05,744
No.

274
00:27:05,777 --> 00:27:07,979
Good, I'm glad
to hear it.

275
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:10,482
He's not taking
the blue. Are you?

276
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:12,384
Why would I?

277
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:15,954
It's a drug.
You're drugging us.

278
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:18,123
Mission made a decision
to administer medication

279
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:22,260
to help with
impulse control.

280
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:25,764
To prevent exactly this kind
of thing from happening.

281
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:30,135
It's the only way to
deal with living like this.

282
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:31,836
We didn't ask
to be here.

283
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,705
Nobody chooses what
they're born into.

284
00:27:36,408 --> 00:27:38,076
But you have to find
a way to live your life.

285
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:39,477
You gotta

286
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:41,681
decide what kind of person
you want to be.

287
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:44,082
You gotta try to be good.

288
00:27:44,115 --> 00:27:46,051
Why?

289
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:47,152
We're just gonna
die in the end,

290
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:49,521
so why can't we do
what we want?

291
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:51,356
What's the difference
whether we're good or not?

292
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:53,124
- There's a big difference.
- Well, I don't see it.

293
00:27:53,158 --> 00:27:54,459
Are we still
doing the repair?

294
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:57,162
Yeah.

295
00:27:58,997 --> 00:27:59,998
C'mon.

296
00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:08,773
All right,
put this on.

297
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:11,376
- Why?
- You're coming with me.

298
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:13,178
I don't
want to go.

299
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:17,849
Look, I get that
you're angry,

300
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:19,417
but I need your
help with this.

301
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:22,420
And the sooner
we fix it,

302
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:23,488
the sooner you can
voice your objections

303
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:24,823
to mission control.

304
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:27,892
I'll back you up.

305
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:55,453
<i>Depressurization in progress.</i>

306
00:28:57,088 --> 00:28:58,323
<i>90%.</i>

307
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:01,293
<i>80%.</i>

308
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:04,229
<i>Kai, you ready
in the systems room?</i>

309
00:29:04,262 --> 00:29:05,330
Yes.

310
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:08,567
Control room set.

311
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,536
<i>Med Bay

312
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:17,208
<i>Depressurization complete.</i>

313
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:18,343
<i>Opening hatch.</i>

314
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,015
Who's with him?

315
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:25,317
Christopher.

316
00:31:15,026 --> 00:31:17,061
<i>We're at junction box 1.</i>

317
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:19,532
<i>Starting the repair.</i>

318
00:31:19,565 --> 00:31:21,700
<i>Shut down power
to LCT 1 transmitter.</i>

319
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:25,370
Copy that.
LCT 1 shutting down.

00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:45,423
<i>Opening

321
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,360
<i>Copy that.</i>

<i>LCT 1 repair complete.</i>

323
00:31:58,704 --> 00:32:00,271
Going to LCT 2.

324
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:03,408
<i>Copy that.</i>

325
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:06,211
<i>LCT 2 shut down.</i>

326
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:22,561
There it is.

327
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:24,395
It's just the ship.

328
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:25,731
Richard told us
what it is.

329
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:51,590
Do you see anything?

330
00:32:54,425 --> 00:32:55,761
Because there's
nothing there.

331
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:09,642
Richard!

332
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:18,182
Richard!

333
00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:19,852
Richard!
Do you read me, Richard?

334
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:21,620
- What happened?
- I don't know.

335
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:23,154
Switching to emergency power.

336
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:25,156
Check the breakers.

337
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:26,190
<i>We have
a fire in the systems room.</i>

338
00:33:56,889 --> 00:33:58,557
Navigation errors.

339
00:33:58,591 --> 00:33:59,558
I don't know.
We're trying to check.

340
00:33:59,592 --> 00:34:00,759
Negative. No effect.

341
00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:03,294
Communications.

342
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:05,496
The whole system's down.
We're not transmitting or receiving.

343
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,305
No, keep the oxygen.
We're going to go again.

344
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:27,185
It's not working.

345
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,659
Are you pronouncing
him dead?

346
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,896
It says the chief medical
officer should note

347
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,130
the time of death.

348
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:00,418
Okay.

349
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:02,788
14:35 ship time.

350
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:19,170
I just don't understand.

351
00:35:20,673 --> 00:35:21,907
What actually happened?

352
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,274
You didn't see it?

353
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:24,810
I was facing
the other way.

354
00:35:24,843 --> 00:35:26,344
There was
that sound.

355
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,648
Creaking.

356
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:32,751
Just before
it happened.

357
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:34,285
Was anyone watching
the monitor?

358
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:36,487
Yes. We didn't
see anything.

359
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:37,522
I did.

360
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:40,592
And?

361
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,493
What'd you see?

362
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:43,729
It looked like...

363
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:47,766
Like a force
jumping into him.

364
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,636
What do you mean?
Like a meteoroid?

365
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:51,937
He means
something else.

366
00:35:53,504 --> 00:35:54,707
Something alien.

367
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,307
What?

368
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:02,380
It's okay.

369
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:04,282
It's going
to be okay.

370
00:36:04,315 --> 00:36:05,584
What's going
to happen to us?

371
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:08,987
We'll be okay.

372
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:11,590
Whatever it was,
it was on the outside.

373
00:36:11,623 --> 00:36:13,391
We're safe
inside the ship.

374
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:14,860
But without
Richard...

375
00:36:14,893 --> 00:36:17,261
We were going to be on our
own at some point anyway.

376
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:20,899
It just happened early.

377
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,436
If we keep it together,
we'll be all right.

378
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:36,380
<i>System restarting.</i>

379
00:36:44,322 --> 00:36:45,858
Did you get an image?

380
00:36:45,891 --> 00:36:48,560
Everything
recorded is gone.

381
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:50,863
So we can't see
what happened?

382
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:52,363
The fire
in the systems room

383
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:53,599
destroyed the
surveillance archive.

384
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:01,272
The program says we need to
choose a new chief officer.

385
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:04,408
I'll be
chief officer.

386
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,512
I'm head
engineer now,

387
00:37:07,546 --> 00:37:08,914
it makes sense
that I be chief.

388
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:12,383
Well, what
about Sela?

389
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:15,053
She's head
medical officer.

390
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:17,089
I don't want
to be chief.

391
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:18,924
It says everyone
gets a vote.

392
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:22,060
We have an election.

393
00:37:33,071 --> 00:37:35,406
And the new
chief officer is...

394
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:38,309
Christopher.

395
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:53,692
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

396
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:55,694
First thing we have to
do is repair the damage.

397
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,664
The LCS is down,

398
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:00,532
so we won't be hearing from
Earth until we fix it.

399
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,002
We're on our own now,

400
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:05,838
but we can work our
way out of this.

401
00:38:11,076 --> 00:38:12,678
<i>We'll need
the entire crew</i>

402
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:15,681
<i>in the damaged area
working on the repairs.</i>

403
00:38:15,714 --> 00:38:18,684
<i>The fire knocked out
most of the systems room.</i>

404
00:38:18,717 --> 00:38:21,053
<i>We'll look at electrical
and communications first.</i>

405
00:38:21,086 --> 00:38:23,354
<i>Pull out all the burned
equipment and replace it.</i>

406
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:27,926
<i>Then we'll work
on the surveillance system.</i>

407
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,728
<i>Try to get it up and running</i>

408
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:30,929
<i>so we can see what
really happened to Richard.</i>

409
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:37,836
Okay.

410
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:42,774
Edward said the fire
destroyed all the surveillance.

411
00:38:42,808 --> 00:38:43,942
Yeah.

412
00:38:43,976 --> 00:38:46,011
The connections
are burned.

413
00:38:46,044 --> 00:38:47,846
But maybe the drives
are still intact.

414
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:44,770
Hey.

415
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:47,773
You okay?

416
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:48,840
Yeah.

417
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:51,910
What are you
doing in here?

418
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:54,212
I'm supposed to destroy
his personal archive.

419
00:39:56,214 --> 00:39:57,515
Why?

420
00:39:57,549 --> 00:39:59,517
It's in
the program.

421
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:00,919
They don't want
us to see it.

422
00:40:02,688 --> 00:40:03,689
Do I have to do it?

423
00:40:04,923 --> 00:40:06,591
Yes. Of course.

424
00:40:10,729 --> 00:40:12,130
That's Richard
when he was ten.

425
00:40:12,965 --> 00:40:14,232
That's his sister.

426
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:16,768
That's his parents.

427
00:40:16,802 --> 00:40:17,836
His parents...

428
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:20,572
We only have
genetic donors.

429
00:40:20,605 --> 00:40:21,606
It's the same.

430
00:40:22,774 --> 00:40:23,976
Is it?

431
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:25,610
We still get our
natures from them.

432
00:40:27,212 --> 00:40:28,914
Why did he show
you all this?

433
00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:32,584
He wanted someone
to talk to.

434
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,887
What else?

435
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:37,089
What do you mean?

436
00:40:37,122 --> 00:40:38,190
We saw...

437
00:40:38,223 --> 00:40:40,258
We saw him
touching you.

438
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:41,727
And we thought that
you and Richard...

439
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,928
I didn't do anything
with Richard.

440
00:40:43,962 --> 00:40:45,097
We were just friends.

441
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:50,102
He showed me his things.
He would tell me about his life.

442
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,671
But why?

443
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,040
He felt

444
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:57,075
alone.

445
00:41:01,146 --> 00:41:03,315
<i>Day 1,240.</i>

446
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:04,916
<i>I'm not gonna be able
to keep up the count...</i>

447
00:41:06,651 --> 00:41:09,755
<i>It's hard to explain.
On one hand, I...</i>

448
00:41:09,788 --> 00:41:11,890
<i>I didn't feel like I had
anybody at home.</i>

449
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:14,760
<i>The kids</i>

450
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:17,963
<i>seemed like my only
relationship, so...</i>

451
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:19,831
<i>I didn't want to lose that.</i>

452
00:41:19,865 --> 00:41:21,967
<i>And then,
on the other hand,</i>

453
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,169
<i>I believe
it's a noble mission,</i>

454
00:41:24,202 --> 00:41:26,972
<i>in the great tradition
of exploration. You know...</i>

455
00:41:27,005 --> 00:41:28,940
<i>What's out there?
Why are we here?</i>

456
00:41:30,942 --> 00:41:32,010
<i>Where are we going?</i>

457
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:36,248
<i>I won't get to
see the answer,</i>

458
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:38,617
<i>but maybe I can move us
a little closer to it.</i>

459
00:41:40,152 --> 00:41:44,656
<i>But I think the real
reason why I came is,</i>

460
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:46,124
<i>I wanted to make
sure they're okay.</i>

461
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:50,862
<i>And I want to protect them.</i>

462
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,269
Protect us from what?

463
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:39,344
Everything okay?

464
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:41,413
Yes.

465
00:42:41,446 --> 00:42:43,748
How's it going with
the surveillance?

466
00:42:43,782 --> 00:42:44,816
Not sure yet.

467
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:47,953
Where is everyone?

468
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:03,235
Hey, what's going on?

469
00:43:04,703 --> 00:43:06,204
Why isn't everyone
at their jobs?

470
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:08,373
We have to repair
the damage.

471
00:43:08,406 --> 00:43:09,741
We have to secure
the ship.

472
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:12,410
What are you
doing in here?

473
00:43:12,444 --> 00:43:14,346
Bit of an emergency.

474
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:17,315
That short circuit cut the
power to the refrigerators.

475
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:18,917
We're doing
everything we can

476
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,285
to get them back before
we lose any food.

477
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:21,686
Oh.

478
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,754
Somebody should
have told you.

479
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,125
- Can you fix it?
- Yes.

480
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:28,193
But there's a bunch
of food we need to eat

481
00:43:28,226 --> 00:43:30,095
before it goes
bad and...

482
00:43:32,364 --> 00:43:34,099
I was thinking we
could have a party.

483
00:43:34,132 --> 00:43:35,200
A feast.

484
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:39,171
What for?

485
00:43:39,204 --> 00:43:41,173
To celebrate our
new chief officer.

486
00:44:02,794 --> 00:44:04,963
Don't drink the blue.
Don't drink it.

487
00:44:06,097 --> 00:44:07,432
Why not?

488
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:09,067
Zac says
we shouldn't.

489
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,435
It's medication
to control us.

490
00:44:25,984 --> 00:44:27,252
- <i>Richard.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

491
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,471
Kai!

492
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:20,091
What are you doing?

493
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:23,629
Get out of here now.

494
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,369
Everyone go!

495
00:47:45,383 --> 00:47:46,384
Get out.

496
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:03,435
Just remember,

497
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,504
Richard isn't here
to protect you.

498
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:08,173
I don't need him
to protect me.

499
00:48:15,748 --> 00:48:17,148
Is she all right?

500
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:20,285
She doesn't want me
to touch her.

501
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:30,488
Sela?

502
00:49:32,156 --> 00:49:33,391
You in there?

503
00:49:33,424 --> 00:49:34,827
Looking
for Sela?

504
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,728
She's in the Med Bay.
I just saw her.

505
00:49:43,802 --> 00:49:44,803
Hi.

506
00:49:48,774 --> 00:49:50,241
Everything all right?

507
00:49:51,677 --> 00:49:53,511
Yeah.

508
00:49:54,345 --> 00:49:55,346
Sela?

509
00:50:01,185 --> 00:50:02,186
Stop.

510
00:50:03,756 --> 00:50:04,757
What are you doing?

511
00:50:06,825 --> 00:50:08,159
What does it
look like?

512
00:50:09,662 --> 00:50:11,262
Looks like you
got here fast.

513
00:50:18,403 --> 00:50:19,738
Get out.

514
00:50:19,772 --> 00:50:21,506
Wait.

515
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,274
- Whoa.
- You're just like him.

516
00:50:23,308 --> 00:50:24,543
No, you don't
understand.

517
00:50:24,577 --> 00:50:25,644
He was coming in
here to get you.

518
00:50:25,678 --> 00:50:26,879
I was trying
to help you.

519
00:50:26,912 --> 00:50:28,714
Why don't you help
the rest of the crew?

520
00:50:28,747 --> 00:50:31,149
It's getting out of control.
You're the leader.

521
00:50:31,182 --> 00:50:32,283
You should do
something about it.

522
00:50:46,832 --> 00:50:47,866
Why'd you do that?

523
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,369
What?

524
00:50:51,402 --> 00:50:52,503
You knew I was going
to find Sela,

525
00:50:52,538 --> 00:50:54,472
and you went
right to her.

526
00:50:54,505 --> 00:50:56,642
You need to
leave her alone.

527
00:50:56,675 --> 00:50:58,209
You think 'cause
you're chief officer,

528
00:50:58,242 --> 00:50:59,678
- you can tell me what to do?
- No.

529
00:50:59,712 --> 00:51:01,847
- Good.
- I'm telling you as a friend.

530
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,214
Stay away from her.

531
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:04,583
I'll do what I want.

532
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:57,435
Kai!

533
00:51:57,468 --> 00:51:58,637
What are you doing, Kai?

534
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,601
What's up?
No, I'm good.

535
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,807
Tayo...
Tayo, get down from there.

536
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,908
Don't sit
on the table.

537
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:40,012
That's right.

538
00:52:40,045 --> 00:52:41,512
You're not supposed put your
feet where you're eating.

539
00:52:41,547 --> 00:52:43,882
Shut your face.

540
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:45,617
All right.
That's enough.

541
00:52:48,754 --> 00:52:50,354
- Kai.
- What?

542
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,560
No, no, no! Stop!

543
00:52:54,593 --> 00:52:55,728
Stop!

544
00:53:00,498 --> 00:53:02,433
Let go!

545
00:53:02,467 --> 00:53:03,969
- Let go!
- Let it go.

546
00:53:04,002 --> 00:53:05,537
- Let it go!
- Come on!

547
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:06,672
- Let go!
- Stop!

548
00:53:32,831 --> 00:53:35,466
Let's get them treated.

549
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,935
And then I want everyone
in the common room.

550
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:47,813
There's no more fighting.

551
00:53:49,548 --> 00:53:51,516
It has to stop.

552
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,051
It's not how we resolve
our conflicts.

553
00:53:53,919 --> 00:53:54,920
Do you understand?

554
00:53:58,757 --> 00:54:00,592
Also, some of us
aren't doing our work.

555
00:54:01,994 --> 00:54:03,962
No one's
maintaining the ship.

556
00:54:03,996 --> 00:54:06,364
Why should we if
no one else does?

557
00:54:06,397 --> 00:54:07,699
Because
if you don't, who will?

558
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:09,601
It isn't fair.

559
00:54:09,635 --> 00:54:11,335
We have to repair the damage
and safeguard the ship.

560
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:12,938
I want everyone
finishing those two jobs.

561
00:54:12,971 --> 00:54:14,338
The ship
is secure.

562
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,708
We've done
our job.

563
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:19,545
Then everyone should
be in the systems room.

564
00:54:19,578 --> 00:54:21,980
No. Now we're working
on the food supply.

565
00:54:22,014 --> 00:54:23,549
This is more important.

566
00:54:23,582 --> 00:54:24,883
More important
than food?

567
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:28,887
No, you're wrong
about that.

568
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:31,023
You haven't been working
on the food anyway.

569
00:54:31,056 --> 00:54:32,724
You haven't been
doing anything.

570
00:54:33,725 --> 00:54:35,127
No one has.

571
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,929
And if we don't,
the mission won't survive.

572
00:54:36,962 --> 00:54:38,831
Who cares?

573
00:54:38,864 --> 00:54:39,932
We won't make
it anyway.

574
00:54:39,965 --> 00:54:41,033
But somebody will.

575
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:44,468
And it's our job
to support them.

576
00:54:44,502 --> 00:54:45,571
To lay the groundwork.

577
00:54:45,604 --> 00:54:46,939
For our grandchildren.

578
00:54:46,972 --> 00:54:49,507
Who cares about them?
We'll be dead.

579
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,877
Listen, we're going to get that
whole section up and running,

580
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,612
and everyone's going
to work on it.

581
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:55,047
I don't want to work
in the systems room.

582
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,050
- Why not?
- I just don't.

583
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:00,552
He thinks the alien
is living in there.

584
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:02,154
What? That doesn't
make any sense.

585
00:55:02,187 --> 00:55:03,889
It's on
the outside.

586
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:05,489
He says we brought it
inside with Richard.

587
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:08,794
Christopher
brought it in.

588
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:10,394
Now it's hiding in
the damaged area.

589
00:55:11,597 --> 00:55:13,131
That's not true.

590
00:55:13,165 --> 00:55:15,033
I, for one,
don't know if there is an alien.

591
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:16,802
Who cares what
you don't know?

592
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:18,170
If we repair
the damage,

593
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:19,738
we can watch the
surveillance video and see...

594
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:22,841
Shut your fat,
pus-filled face.

595
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,643
I've got
a right to talk.

596
00:55:24,676 --> 00:55:26,812
You talk too much as it is,
you bloated, wheezing blister.

597
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:28,847
Zac, she can talk.

598
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:30,782
You shut up, too.

599
00:55:30,816 --> 00:55:33,417
Who are you?
Telling people what to do.

600
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:34,686
I'm chief officer.

601
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,921
Why should that make
any difference?

602
00:55:35,954 --> 00:55:37,155
Because I was chosen.

603
00:55:37,189 --> 00:55:39,157
It's in the program.
It's in the rules.

604
00:55:39,191 --> 00:55:40,759
Who cares about
the rules?

605
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:42,426
Zac! Come on.

606
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,763
We're strong,
we can do what we want.

607
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,568
Stop it!
Both of you. Stop!

608
00:55:49,601 --> 00:55:51,036
I'm not listening to
Christopher anymore.

609
00:55:51,069 --> 00:55:52,204
He's chief officer.

610
00:55:52,237 --> 00:55:53,705
You're not
a commander.

611
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,743
- You're not a leader.
- I'm trying to keep us on track.

612
00:55:57,776 --> 00:55:59,745
Anyone who wants
to follow me can.

613
00:56:01,146 --> 00:56:03,481
- I'll make more food.
- That's our food, too.

614
00:56:03,514 --> 00:56:04,816
And I'll protect you
from the alien.

615
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:05,918
Especially if he's
inside the ship now.

616
00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:07,418
You're just trying
to scare them.

617
00:56:10,622 --> 00:56:11,823
Are you calling
me a liar?

618
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,527
Zac, why are you
doing this?

619
00:56:20,999 --> 00:56:22,100
We need a new leader.

620
00:56:24,736 --> 00:56:26,171
He doesn't know
how to feed you.

621
00:56:27,806 --> 00:56:30,242
He can't protect you.

622
00:56:30,275 --> 00:56:32,144
And I'm not going to
listen to him anymore.

623
00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:39,051
Anyone who wants to be a
part of my group is welcome.

624
00:56:41,753 --> 00:56:44,156
We'll have more food,
so we're strong...

625
00:56:44,189 --> 00:56:46,925
Strong enough to fight
the alien, strong enough

626
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:49,460
to kill it.

627
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:01,540
Anyone who wants

628
00:57:03,141 --> 00:57:04,142
can come with me.

629
00:57:21,259 --> 00:57:23,128
What if Zac is right
about the alien?

630
00:57:43,582 --> 00:57:45,050
If we can just
get that surveillance drive,

631
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:46,651
then we can see what
really happened.

632
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,155
You don't think it's living in
there, do you?

633
00:57:51,256 --> 00:57:52,591
I don't know.

634
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:31,997
What are you doing?

635
00:58:32,931 --> 00:58:34,299
Nothing.

636
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:35,567
Where's Christopher?

637
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:37,636
I... I don't know.

638
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:41,873
Who's in the
systems room?

639
00:58:41,907 --> 00:58:42,941
No one.

640
00:58:48,647 --> 00:58:50,248
You all stay here.

641
00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:51,783
Don't let anyone
come in.

642
00:59:19,744 --> 00:59:20,846
What do you think?

643
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:25,383
What's through there?

644
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:49,274
What is that?

645
00:59:51,076 --> 00:59:52,744
- Get behind it.
- Try to close the door.

646
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:58,183
Go! Go! Go!

647
01:00:00,385 --> 01:00:02,154
Close it! Close it!

648
01:00:02,187 --> 01:00:04,322
What was that?
What happened?

649
01:00:04,356 --> 01:00:06,024
What was it?

650
01:00:14,432 --> 01:00:17,002
The surveillance drive.

651
01:00:17,035 --> 01:00:20,005
- There was really something in there?
- What was it?

652
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,009
- I don't know.
- Not Christopher?

653
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:25,443
- No.
- What did it look like?

654
01:00:26,778 --> 01:00:28,880
It was dark.
We couldn't see.

655
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,721
Okay...

656
01:00:42,994 --> 01:00:44,930
<i>Start shutting down
the transmitter circuits now.</i>

657
01:00:44,963 --> 01:00:46,131
It's pretty damaged.

658
01:00:46,164 --> 01:00:47,899
You can't
see anything.

659
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:49,201
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Let's try a different angle.

660
01:00:56,441 --> 01:00:58,143
I can clean this up.

661
01:00:58,176 --> 01:00:59,411
It's not as bad as it looks.

662
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:04,983
Everything all right?

663
01:01:05,016 --> 01:01:06,418
No.

664
01:01:07,118 --> 01:01:09,087
What is it?

665
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,989
Zac and Kai were in the systems
room right after you left.

666
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:13,858
They said they
saw the alien.

667
01:01:13,892 --> 01:01:15,393
- They fought it.
- What?

668
01:01:15,427 --> 01:01:16,861
It wasn't there
when I was inside.

669
01:01:16,895 --> 01:01:18,763
And the room
looks destroyed.

670
01:01:18,797 --> 01:01:20,098
There are pieces of the
surveillance unit everywhere.

671
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:23,902
The alien did that?

672
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:25,136
Or they did it
themselves.

673
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:30,475
It doesn't matter.

674
01:01:30,508 --> 01:01:31,743
We have all the
data right here.

675
01:01:33,845 --> 01:01:35,013
But if it was
Zac and Kai,

676
01:01:35,046 --> 01:01:36,214
they did it
for a reason.

677
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:41,786
To destroy the record.

678
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,441
<i>Who's with him?</i>

679
01:02:03,475 --> 01:02:05,477
<i>Christopher.</i>

680
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:07,846
<i>It was supposed
to be me.</i>

681
01:02:07,879 --> 01:02:09,147
<i>Richard looked for you.</i>

682
01:02:12,117 --> 01:02:14,019
<i>All right,
go into LCT 2.</i>

683
01:02:14,052 --> 01:02:16,221
<i>Copy that.
Shutting down LCT 2.</i>

684
01:02:20,158 --> 01:02:22,127
<i>You should give him a
little zap for his trouble.</i>

685
01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:25,163
<i>For my trouble...</i>

686
01:02:26,965 --> 01:02:28,266
<i>A little spark.</i>

687
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,834
- <i>A sting?</i>
- <i>A stab.</i>

688
01:02:37,175 --> 01:02:38,943
<i>You could do it.</i>

689
01:02:38,977 --> 01:02:41,212
- <i>I know I could.</i>
- <i>He'd be surprised.</i>

690
01:02:42,347 --> 01:02:44,449
<i>He'd be shocked.</i>

691
01:02:49,521 --> 01:02:50,822
<i>You hear that?</i>

692
01:02:52,924 --> 01:02:54,926
<i>Yeah, it's just
the ship.</i>

693
01:02:54,959 --> 01:02:56,461
He knew it
was the ship all along.

694
01:02:59,264 --> 01:03:00,265
<i>This one?</i>

695
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:02,233
<i>Yes.</i>

696
01:03:06,438 --> 01:03:07,606
<i>He didn't feel it.</i>

697
01:03:12,077 --> 01:03:13,411
<i>Nothing.</i>

698
01:03:13,445 --> 01:03:15,013
<i>Is he touching the cable?</i>

699
01:03:15,046 --> 01:03:17,248
<i>Yes. But his gloves
are insulated.</i>

700
01:03:30,663 --> 01:03:31,863
Murder...

701
01:03:42,307 --> 01:03:44,577
Don't mention
this to anyone.

702
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,244
Not until we decide what to do.

703
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:52,618
How could Zac do that?

704
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,555
Why have they
all gone crazy?

705
01:03:58,256 --> 01:03:59,424
Maybe they haven't.

706
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,461
Maybe this is what
they're really like.

707
01:04:05,063 --> 01:04:06,931
We have our rules
that keep us in line,

708
01:04:09,602 --> 01:04:11,503
but deep down,
maybe this is our true nature.

709
01:04:13,505 --> 01:04:14,506
No.

710
01:04:16,609 --> 01:04:18,644
It can't be.
I'm not like that.

711
01:04:19,645 --> 01:04:21,146
You're not like that.

712
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:24,015
You're not.

713
01:04:26,518 --> 01:04:30,188
And the crew will be on our
side once they know the truth.

714
01:04:31,156 --> 01:04:32,223
I'm not so sure.

715
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:34,593
They don't care anymore.

716
01:04:38,631 --> 01:04:40,064
Sometimes,
I don't either.

717
01:04:40,766 --> 01:04:41,966
You care.

718
01:04:44,068 --> 01:04:45,069
I know you do.

719
01:04:49,174 --> 01:04:50,375
I should leave
you alone.

720
01:04:53,378 --> 01:04:54,412
No.

721
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,083
I want you to stay.

722
01:06:30,241 --> 01:06:31,544
Time to
wake up, Sela.

723
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:41,620
Go away!

724
01:06:44,355 --> 01:06:46,491
Oh, we're not going away.
We're coming in.

725
01:06:59,872 --> 01:07:02,173
What are you doing?

726
01:07:02,206 --> 01:07:03,308
What are
you doing?

727
01:07:04,877 --> 01:07:07,278
I see I'm breaking up a
nice little thing here.

728
01:07:07,312 --> 01:07:08,681
What do you want?

729
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:10,415
We're having
a celebration.

730
01:07:10,448 --> 01:07:11,650
Right now?

731
01:07:11,684 --> 01:07:13,151
Yes.

732
01:07:13,184 --> 01:07:14,185
Sela's invited.

733
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,288
I guess you
are, too.

734
01:07:17,322 --> 01:07:18,724
Come eat.
If you want.

735
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:21,459
Don't if you don't.

736
01:07:50,589 --> 01:07:51,590
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

737
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:54,760
Get some food.

738
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:56,795
You must be hungry.

739
01:08:11,877 --> 01:08:13,344
All right, listen up,
everybody.

740
01:08:17,549 --> 01:08:21,419
Now I know we've had some
disagreements in the past.

741
01:08:21,452 --> 01:08:22,821
We're going to put
all that behind us.

742
01:08:24,489 --> 01:08:25,591
I'm chief officer now,

743
01:08:27,325 --> 01:08:28,426
and that's the way
it's gonna be.

744
01:08:30,629 --> 01:08:32,731
From now on,
we'll do the work,

745
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:35,734
but we'll do it when we
want and how we want.

746
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:39,838
We'll make the rules,

747
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,709
and anyone who breaks them

748
01:08:43,742 --> 01:08:45,176
will have to answer to me.

749
01:08:46,511 --> 01:08:48,914
The alien's somewhere
in the ship.

750
01:08:48,947 --> 01:08:52,383
We'll fight it again if we have
to, and we'll defeat it.

751
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:54,753
You'll be safe now
'cause I'll protect you.

752
01:08:58,489 --> 01:09:00,859
Hey, what are you doing?

753
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:02,861
Sit down.

754
01:09:05,998 --> 01:09:07,700
Richard was killed

755
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:09,868
at 13:58:37.

756
01:09:09,902 --> 01:09:12,437
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- He was electrocuted.

757
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:14,907
<i>Shutting down LCT 1.</i>

758
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,240
<i>Who's with him?</i>

759
01:09:17,341 --> 01:09:18,544
<i>Christopher.</i>

760
01:09:18,577 --> 01:09:20,679
<i>It was supposed to be me.</i>

761
01:09:20,713 --> 01:09:22,915
<i>You should give him a
little zap for his trouble.</i>

762
01:09:23,649 --> 01:09:24,850
<i>A little spark.</i>

763
01:09:24,883 --> 01:09:25,984
- <i>A sting?</i>
- <i>A stab.</i>

764
01:09:27,418 --> 01:09:29,353
- <i>This one?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

765
01:09:29,387 --> 01:09:30,622
<i>He didn't feel it.</i>

766
01:09:30,656 --> 01:09:31,990
<i>Is he touching
the cable?</i>

767
01:09:32,024 --> 01:09:33,692
<i>Yes,
but his gloves are insulated.</i>

768
01:09:40,532 --> 01:09:42,333
Zac killed Richard.

769
01:09:43,736 --> 01:09:45,470
There is no alien.

770
01:09:45,503 --> 01:09:48,607
Not out there, not in here.
There's only Zac.

771
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,576
He's been lying to you
the whole time.

772
01:09:53,078 --> 01:09:54,580
But now you
know the truth.

773
01:09:55,914 --> 01:09:59,383
You've seen it
with your own eyes.

774
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:02,855
Zac should go to his compartment
while we consult the program.

775
01:10:02,888 --> 01:10:04,590
Then we'll decide
what to do.

776
01:10:13,632 --> 01:10:14,633
It's true.

777
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:16,568
I did it.

778
01:10:19,805 --> 01:10:21,006
I killed him.

779
01:10:25,978 --> 01:10:28,714
But I did it for you.

780
01:10:31,016 --> 01:10:33,384
I did it to protect you.

781
01:10:33,417 --> 01:10:37,756
I did it because I saw
the alien in him.

782
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:40,793
The alien was in Richard,

783
01:10:40,826 --> 01:10:42,426
and then Christopher
brought it inside.

784
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,595
That's not true.

785
01:10:43,629 --> 01:10:45,463
He shouldn't have.

786
01:10:45,496 --> 01:10:47,800
He knew something was
wrong, but he did it anyway.

787
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:51,103
He brought the alien
into the ship.

788
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:53,005
Just watch the rest
of the video.

789
01:10:53,038 --> 01:10:54,540
You'll see he's lying.

790
01:10:54,573 --> 01:10:56,340
I killed Richard
to protect the crew,

791
01:10:56,374 --> 01:10:58,844
but now the alien's inside
the ship somewhere.

792
01:10:58,877 --> 01:11:00,979
We need to find out
where so we can stop it.

793
01:11:01,013 --> 01:11:02,346
So we can kill it.

794
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:04,683
That's right.
We'll kill it.

795
01:11:04,716 --> 01:11:06,484
We'll take
back control.

796
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:09,822
We've been drugged and betrayed
and programmed by liars,

797
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:12,591
but we're not going to
follow the program anymore.

798
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:16,360
We can't escape this life,

799
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:18,664
but we won't just lay
down and give up.

800
01:11:18,697 --> 01:11:20,431
We won't be afraid.

801
01:11:20,464 --> 01:11:21,800
We won't be terrorized.

802
01:11:21,834 --> 01:11:23,367
We'll fight back,
we'll find it!

803
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:24,435
There's nothing
to find.

804
01:11:24,468 --> 01:11:25,503
Where is it now?

805
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:28,807
First,

806
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:30,042
it was inside Richard.

807
01:11:33,045 --> 01:11:34,813
Now maybe it's hiding
in someone else.

808
01:11:37,049 --> 01:11:38,449
One of you.

809
01:11:40,552 --> 01:11:41,553
It could be you.

810
01:11:47,626 --> 01:11:48,627
Or you.

811
01:11:52,865 --> 01:11:53,866
Or you.

812
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:56,902
We'll kill it.

813
01:11:56,935 --> 01:11:59,805
Yes. We'll find it
and kill it.

814
01:11:59,838 --> 01:12:01,773
- Kill it.
- We have to find it.

815
01:12:01,807 --> 01:12:03,675
- It could be you.
- Or you.

816
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:04,710
Or you.

817
01:12:11,116 --> 01:12:12,117
Or him.

818
01:12:14,853 --> 01:12:16,788
It's him.

819
01:12:16,822 --> 01:12:18,957
- It's him!
- Him...

820
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:20,759
It's him!

821
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:22,194
It's him.

822
01:12:22,227 --> 01:12:23,695
Him.

823
01:12:25,197 --> 01:12:26,732
Get him!

824
01:12:51,857 --> 01:12:52,858
Stop! Stop it!

825
01:13:37,803 --> 01:13:39,104
It's okay.

826
01:13:39,137 --> 01:13:41,707
He had the alien
inside of him.

827
01:13:43,709 --> 01:13:45,210
- I don't know.
- He did.

828
01:13:46,144 --> 01:13:47,145
Don't worry.

829
01:13:50,315 --> 01:13:52,918
Unless it's you
who has it inside.

830
01:13:54,853 --> 01:13:55,854
No.

831
01:13:57,189 --> 01:13:58,190
It's not me.

832
01:14:00,993 --> 01:14:02,861
Grab anything that can
be used as a weapon.

833
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:08,533
Scalpels, scissors,
anything sharp.

834
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:11,303
We have to arm
ourselves to fight.

835
01:14:11,336 --> 01:14:13,105
We need something that
will make him back down.

836
01:14:14,306 --> 01:14:16,575
Maybe we should
just give up.

837
01:14:16,608 --> 01:14:17,809
We can't give up.

838
01:14:17,843 --> 01:14:19,778
But there's nothing
we can do right now.

839
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:21,813
We accused him of murder.
He's not going to forget that.

840
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:23,915
We should join
his group.

841
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:25,217
I mean, that's all he
really wants anyway.

842
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,685
Maybe later
we can detain him.

843
01:14:26,718 --> 01:14:27,886
That's right.

844
01:14:27,919 --> 01:14:29,788
When things calm down.

845
01:14:29,821 --> 01:14:31,990
Eventually,
things will calm down and be okay.

846
01:14:32,024 --> 01:14:34,259
Right now,
it is too dangerous.

847
01:14:34,292 --> 01:14:35,894
We can't
stay separate.

848
01:14:35,927 --> 01:14:37,029
There's no way
to fight him.

849
01:14:37,062 --> 01:14:38,063
We don't have
any weapons.

850
01:14:40,832 --> 01:14:41,833
Weapons.

851
01:14:45,937 --> 01:14:47,806
You know where they are.

852
01:14:47,839 --> 01:14:49,207
I do?

853
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:50,275
He said you did.

854
01:14:50,308 --> 01:14:52,811
- Who did?
- Richard.

855
01:14:52,844 --> 01:14:56,181
I was watching his video diary,
and he said you knew about the weapons.

856
01:17:32,103 --> 01:17:33,104
Chief.

857
01:17:34,839 --> 01:17:35,840
Wake up.

858
01:18:24,889 --> 01:18:26,124
Was it the alien?

859
01:18:27,926 --> 01:18:28,960
It was Christopher.

860
01:19:17,108 --> 01:19:19,511
Must be for the third
generation.

861
01:19:19,545 --> 01:19:20,979
When they reach
the planet.

862
01:19:24,015 --> 01:19:25,016
No, these are for us.

863
01:19:51,943 --> 01:19:52,944
Chief.

864
01:20:00,586 --> 01:20:02,120
They want
to join us.

865
01:20:05,924 --> 01:20:07,258
Why should
we let you?

866
01:20:08,493 --> 01:20:10,395
What else
can we do?

867
01:20:10,428 --> 01:20:12,097
Is the alien
inside you?

868
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:13,264
There isn't an...

869
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,101
No. It's not.

870
01:20:18,403 --> 01:20:19,904
Where're they hiding?

871
01:20:22,641 --> 01:20:24,476
There they are.

872
01:20:24,509 --> 01:20:25,944
What are they holding?

873
01:20:27,145 --> 01:20:28,146
Weapons.

874
01:20:29,548 --> 01:20:31,916
And we just
have this.

875
01:20:34,219 --> 01:20:35,621
That's not going
to help us.

876
01:20:35,654 --> 01:20:37,021
Maybe it will.

877
01:20:39,491 --> 01:20:41,126
We can say we want
to join his group.

878
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:43,928
Like Anda and Alex.

879
01:20:43,962 --> 01:20:45,196
He'll never believe it.

880
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:46,331
All we need is a moment.

881
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:48,199
Why?

882
01:20:49,968 --> 01:20:51,604
So we can get close.

883
01:20:51,637 --> 01:20:53,138
And then what?

884
01:20:57,442 --> 01:20:58,644
And then I'll kill him.

885
01:20:59,978 --> 01:21:01,312
Kill him?

886
01:21:01,346 --> 01:21:02,615
Or he's going to kill us.

887
01:21:02,648 --> 01:21:05,049
- No, he's not.
- They're moving.

888
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:31,443
They cut
the power.

889
01:21:31,476 --> 01:21:33,646
- What do we do?
- We stay in here.

890
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:35,180
No.

891
01:21:35,213 --> 01:21:37,282
We should go out there,
talk to them.

892
01:21:37,315 --> 01:21:39,117
Tell them we don't want
to fight. And then...

893
01:21:41,787 --> 01:21:43,188
They're here.

894
01:21:52,397 --> 01:21:54,332
Don't do anything.

895
01:21:54,365 --> 01:21:56,067
Don't resist.

896
01:22:17,656 --> 01:22:19,057
Grab him.

897
01:22:20,559 --> 01:22:21,560
Get off me!

898
01:22:22,595 --> 01:22:23,729
This way.

899
01:22:27,465 --> 01:22:28,801
Wait!

900
01:22:28,834 --> 01:22:30,034
Wait a minute!

901
01:22:32,337 --> 01:22:33,505
Get back, Sela!

902
01:22:37,509 --> 01:22:38,510
Zac.

903
01:22:39,545 --> 01:22:41,179
You can't stop us.

904
01:22:41,212 --> 01:22:42,347
Let me talk to you.

905
01:22:43,816 --> 01:22:45,450
What for?

906
01:22:45,483 --> 01:22:46,552
Privately.

907
01:22:49,087 --> 01:22:51,724
You can say whatever
you want to say right here.

908
01:22:55,728 --> 01:22:57,262
I want to be with you.

909
01:23:00,398 --> 01:23:01,634
You want
to join my group,

910
01:23:02,635 --> 01:23:04,302
or you want
to be with me?

911
01:23:05,403 --> 01:23:06,404
Both.

912
01:23:08,273 --> 01:23:09,374
I bet you do.

913
01:23:10,108 --> 01:23:11,109
I do.

914
01:23:13,177 --> 01:23:15,146
I'm glad you've finally
come to your senses.

915
01:23:16,114 --> 01:23:17,181
I have.

916
01:23:20,251 --> 01:23:22,253
I'll do anything
you want.

917
01:23:22,287 --> 01:23:23,454
I'm sure you will.

918
01:23:27,593 --> 01:23:29,160
Only problem...

919
01:23:32,263 --> 01:23:33,599
...is I don't
want you to.

920
01:23:35,901 --> 01:23:37,570
You want to be with me,

921
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:41,406
but I don't want
to be with you.

922
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:47,278
Maybe someone else does.

923
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:50,248
But not me.

924
01:23:50,281 --> 01:23:52,751
Have you
all gone crazy?

925
01:23:54,687 --> 01:23:56,087
Have you?

926
01:23:56,889 --> 01:23:58,323
Don't you see?

927
01:23:58,356 --> 01:24:00,693
All of this is
against our nature.

928
01:24:00,726 --> 01:24:02,360
This is not
who we are.

929
01:24:02,393 --> 01:24:05,363
This is who
we are.

930
01:24:05,396 --> 01:24:07,098
But we don't have
to act this way.

931
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:09,133
We can think.

932
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:10,603
We can decide
to be different.

933
01:24:10,636 --> 01:24:12,871
Shut up,
you genetic defect.

934
01:24:12,905 --> 01:24:15,506
We can decide
which is better.

935
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:16,709
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

936
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:18,711
Let me speak!

937
01:24:18,744 --> 01:24:22,213
We're trying to make sense
here, and you're not listening.

938
01:24:22,246 --> 01:24:23,348
Shut up.

939
01:24:23,381 --> 01:24:24,783
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

940
01:24:24,817 --> 01:24:26,250
Shut up.
Shut up.

941
01:24:26,284 --> 01:24:27,553
Which is better?

942
01:24:27,586 --> 01:24:30,421
To have rules
and agree, or...

943
01:24:30,455 --> 01:24:32,423
Or to run wild
and fight?

944
01:24:32,457 --> 01:24:35,193
To run wild.

945
01:24:35,226 --> 01:24:38,463
Do you want to listen to
reason and figure out a plan,

946
01:24:38,496 --> 01:24:40,532
or do you want to...

947
01:25:18,469 --> 01:25:19,538
You see?

948
01:25:21,506 --> 01:25:22,741
You see what I can do?

949
01:25:44,763 --> 01:25:45,931
Which way?

950
01:25:45,964 --> 01:25:47,533
You go that way.
I'll check down here.

951
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,609
This way.

952
01:26:24,636 --> 01:26:26,905
Check in the vats.
Check in the refrigerators.

953
01:26:35,313 --> 01:26:36,447
Tayo.

954
01:26:36,481 --> 01:26:37,482
Check in there.

955
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:42,788
No way they
could fit.

956
01:26:42,821 --> 01:26:43,989
Check all of them.

957
01:26:51,897 --> 01:26:52,998
This one's been opened.

958
01:27:01,106 --> 01:27:02,406
Move back, Tayo.

959
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,842
- What?
- Get out of the way.

960
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,061
Zac, that's
for our food.

961
01:27:27,398 --> 01:27:28,466
Go see if
we got them.

962
01:27:55,694 --> 01:27:56,929
We should stay...

963
01:27:58,496 --> 01:28:00,732
Check the drawers,
try to find something.

964
01:28:06,504 --> 01:28:08,874
Next to you,
in the cabinet.

965
01:28:35,133 --> 01:28:36,467
They're in
the Med Bay.

966
01:28:57,823 --> 01:28:58,824
Hey!

967
01:29:07,032 --> 01:29:08,634
You're okay.
You're okay.

968
01:30:17,269 --> 01:30:18,870
Get into a space suit.

969
01:30:18,904 --> 01:30:20,605
If we go out,
we'll never get back in.

970
01:31:33,278 --> 01:31:35,147
<i>Close hatch.</i>

971
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:36,181
<i>Close hatch.</i>

972
01:31:37,182 --> 01:31:39,117
<i>Close hatch.</i>

973
01:31:39,151 --> 01:31:40,886
<i>Emergency oxygen released.</i>

974
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:49,628
<i>Enter closing code.</i>

975
01:31:56,301 --> 01:31:57,803
<i>Hatch closing.</i>

976
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:05,177
<i>Oxygen level 70%.</i>

977
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:10,849
<i>Oxygen level 50%.</i>

978
01:32:20,325 --> 01:32:23,061
- <i>Oxygen level 30%.</i>
- No!

979
01:32:42,114 --> 01:32:43,315
<i>Pressurize now.</i>

980
01:32:44,683 --> 01:32:46,017
<i>Pressurize now.</i>

981
01:32:59,698 --> 01:33:01,233
<i>Hatch stopped.</i>

982
01:34:09,201 --> 01:34:10,202
Tayo.

983
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,208
Put your guns down.

984
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:18,376
Zac's gone.

985
01:34:53,311 --> 01:34:55,213
How do we make sure
it doesn't happen again?

986
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:09,127
<i>So tomorrow we go.</i>

987
01:35:10,996 --> 01:35:12,430
<i>And as we begin our journey,</i>

988
01:35:12,464 --> 01:35:15,800
<i>I think about the world
we are leaving behind.</i>

989
01:35:15,834 --> 01:35:18,169
<i>And how I've seen it
at its best and its worst</i>

990
01:35:19,404 --> 01:35:20,438
<i>and how</i>

991
01:35:22,107 --> 01:35:24,075
<i>we'll have our own bad times.</i>

992
01:35:24,109 --> 01:35:25,977
<i>I mean, they're coming.
There is nothing I can do about it.</i>

993
01:35:27,512 --> 01:35:29,447
<i>But I also know that
you will prevail.</i>

994
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:33,118
<i>And our best will live on.</i>

995
01:35:36,221 --> 01:35:37,522
<i>That we are worth saving.</i>

996
01:35:52,103 --> 01:35:56,007
And the new Chief is...
Sela.

997
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:57,576
We are voting
on everything now.

998
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:59,110
Trying to reach consensus.

999
01:36:01,313 --> 01:36:04,983
It's not easy, but it's how
we want to move forward.

1000
01:36:05,016 --> 01:36:08,186
And we've decided
to not go back on the blue.

1001
01:36:10,155 --> 01:36:11,923
We feel that it is the
best course of action.

1002
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:13,325
That we can do better.

1003
01:36:27,906 --> 01:36:30,075
Hey, Chief,
we just started those updates.

1004
01:36:41,319 --> 01:36:42,588
Still been
having headaches?

1005
01:36:43,689 --> 01:36:44,989
She just kicked.

1006
