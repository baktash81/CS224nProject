1
00:00:55,133 --> 00:01:00,304
- Okay Boan, how much you got here?
- About 1,800.

2
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:03,474
- What's going on?
- There's Bagley.

3
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:09,897
Mr. Bagley! Something haywire.
We haven't loaded enough pipe.

4
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:13,986
- Less than 2,000 feet.
- That'll be enough.

5
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:20,285
On Huangatan, it didn't come
until we were past 26,000 feet.

6
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:24,538
This hole proves out within 2,000,
or it's a write-off.

7
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,936
How are you this evening?

8
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:53,942
All right.

9
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:10,042
The barometer is still falling.
It's a lousy forecast all right.

10
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:13,921
We should stay here
another 48 hours.

11
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:18,551
Every hour we delay gives others
a chance of beating us to the island.

12
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,846
- I thought only we knew...
- We'll sail right away.

13
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:25,350
You'll be sorry.

14
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:29,313
All right, Mr. Carnahan,
ready to let go.

15
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:35,568
- Stand by fore and aft.
- OK, haul the gangway ashore!

16
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:13,567
Let it go.

17
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,578
- Roy.
- Fred.

18
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:30,667
Well, here's to the big one.

19
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:51,396
MAIN TITLE

20
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:01,781
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

21
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,619
<i>Mayday.</i>

22
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:25,847
I'm reminded of Amsterdam.

23
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:32,062
Ever eat a raw herring with a beer
chaser and a scoop of ice cream?

24
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,832
<i>- Captain here.
- I picked up a mayday call.</i>

25
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:56,253
<i>- It faded before I could get a fix.
- Keep listening.</i>

26
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:59,965
Let me know if you get anything.

27
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:09,851
Like you said:
"The hell with the weather. "

28
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:18,484
We can get out of this
by backtracking around Timor.

29
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:23,322
- It'll only cost us a few days.
- Keep on course, I'm fine.

30
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:31,957
I gotta admit, for a New York
desk guy, you got a lot of guts.

31
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:35,669
I sold this one to the board.

32
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:41,300
If that island doesn't produce huge,
I'll be wiping windshields.

33
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:58,817
Men.
Carnahan.

34
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:09,079
I'd have told you earlier,
but I couldn't risk any talk.

35
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:17,379
Men, we may be sailing into
the history books. Hit the lights.

36
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:23,468
I believe we're headed for
the biggest oil strike ever.

37
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:27,596
- Here in the magic circle.
- It's magic all right.

38
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:32,142
Are we supposed to find oil
under 2,000 fathoms of sea?

39
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:38,692
Just sea is what the charts say.
Now let's take a look a low angle.

40
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:43,613
This was taken in 1943.

41
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,951
This wake was left by the ship
that took the photograph.

42
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:54,208
No sign of land. Here's a fog bank
you wouldn't look at twice.

43
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:57,711
Let's look at another picture.

44
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,966
This is taken from precisely
the same angle.

45
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:06,429
Same area, same fog bank.

46
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:14,520
This was taken two weeks ago.
35 years later.

47
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,191
A bank of fog that doesn't change
a wisp in 35 years. Fantastic.

48
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:24,530
Still nothing to explore,
except for one reason.

49
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,326
A spy satellite photographed it
by mistake.

50
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:35,833
I got hold of the classified pictures
via a donation to someone.

51
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:40,297
No names, but he lives
on Pennsylvania Ave.

52
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,132
OK, fellas.

53
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:47,929
Roy Bagley, would you take over
and let science make the point?

54
00:09:54,895 --> 00:10:00,485
The satellite was to analyse
exhaust gases from a missile test.

55
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:04,989
So it was loaded with
two special kinds of film.

56
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:08,950
No, first the infrared.

57
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:15,457
The different colors represent
different surface temperatures.

58
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,461
- You mean there's land there?
- Correct, Joe.

59
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:23,591
An island,
hidden by a perpetual fog bank.

60
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:28,887
Never seen by human eye
nor walked by human foot.

61
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,811
The infrared patterns aren't like
any I've ever seen.

62
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:39,691
More surprising, though, is
what the spectrograph picked up.

63
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:43,903
Chemical composition
of our mysterious fog bank.

64
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:50,077
Free hydrocarbon radicals,
excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide.

65
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:54,331
And, not poisonous
but very damn curious...

66
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,337
This has to be caused by vapors
seeping up through the ground.

67
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:04,591
- Vapors from petroleum deposits.
- Yes!

68
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:11,015
That island is the tip of a huge
underground tankjust waiting for us.

69
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:15,601
- I'm betting everything I've got.
- I'll take 50 cents of that.

70
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:21,025
The excess CO2 might also be
accounted for by animal respiration.

71
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:25,822
- Turn the lights on.
- Animal breathing.

72
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:28,032
Are you crazy?

73
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:33,996
And I'm not so sure human feet
have never walked the island before.

74
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:40,252
In 1605, Fernando De Queres
was blown south from Tenotang.

75
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:46,092
He wrote of the piercing the
white veil. That's the cloud bank.

76
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:50,056
And landing on the beach of the skull,
where he heard the roar -

77
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:54,351
- of the greatest beast...

78
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:00,316
The rest of that log entry
was suppressed by Rome.

79
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:05,613
In 1749, a water-logged lifeboat
was found in the same area.

80
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:11,785
It was empty,
but drawn in blood on the port -

81
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:19,043
- was a likeness of a huge,
slouchy humanoid thing.

82
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:21,878
And this strange warning:

83
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:28,636
"From thy wedding with the creature
who touches heaven, lady, -

84
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:33,307
- God preserve thee. "

85
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:39,605
I also heard of a note in a bottle
from a dying Japanese in 1944...

86
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:43,527
What the hell are you talking about?
Who is this joker?

87
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:47,155
- Beats me.
- He's wearing a crew jersey.

88
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:50,200
I'll pay any fair amount
for my... passage.

89
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:53,578
- You're a stowaway?
- Jack Prescott. From Princeton.

90
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:56,915
- Dept. Of Primate Paleonthology.
- You lying hippie!

91
00:12:57,123 --> 00:13:01,919
You're from another oil company!
The meeting's over.

92
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:06,050
He's got one of our T-shirts.

93
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:16,394
This doesn't mean a thing. Gulf
or Exxon can fix a fake passport.

94
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:20,273
- Who the hell are you?
- I am Jack Prescott...

95
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:27,654
My interest in your island
has got nothing to do with oil.

96
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:32,034
You're not even a good liar. You
couldn't find out where we're going.

97
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:38,542
- You bought charts!
- Come on. Who'd you pay off?

98
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:46,174
They hadn't sold charts for this area
in years. A friend tipped me.

99
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:51,012
I did pick up
some charts in Surabaya.

100
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:57,102
Take this spy below till he's hungry
enough to stop spouting ape shit.

101
00:13:57,311 --> 00:14:00,564
Let's go. Come on.

102
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:15,872
- There's something out there.
- Oh, come on!

103
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:20,166
- Honest to God, look!
- Quit horsing around.

104
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,380
Come back here!

105
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,635
There's something out there!
About 2 o'clock. Use your glasses.

106
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:33,764
Son of a bitch, it's a raft!

107
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:58,623
All stop.

108
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,368
She's alive!

109
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,969
Gently.

110
00:15:54,973 --> 00:16:00,102
I've had first-aid training, Captain.
Will you all clear out of here?

111
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:03,022
- You have to undress her, huh?
- It's usual.

112
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:07,526
In case of internal injury
or shock syndrome.

113
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:10,905
- Get outta here!
- Clear out.

114
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,920
Eye Magnate. Beverly Hills.

115
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:29,883
There's no sign of
injuries anywhere.

116
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:36,723
C- Y-N-A-R-A. Sounds like a yacht.

117
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:42,647
- Careless yachtsman, to lose this.
- Remember that mayday call?

118
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,367
You can stop sweating. Navy
record's clean, it all checks out.

119
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:56,828
Fingerprints.
The guy's kosher.

120
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:02,375
I know just how to use him, too.

121
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:11,759
The girl's about to come to. She
could be hysterical, so follow me.

122
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:21,729
- Can I get a cheeseburger here?
- You went to medical school, right?

123
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:25,858
What have you got, crystal balls?

124
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:29,111
There's nothing I haven't checked.

125
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:33,074
I know the day and hour
you completed your toilet training.

126
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:37,703
Now we gotta figure a way for you
to work off your room and board.

127
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:44,377
- You're pretty good with a camera.
- I've snapped a few monkeys.

128
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:49,673
Congratulations.
You're now our official photographer.

129
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:20,372
Hello. Everything's fine.

130
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:25,168
You're safe and well
on an American merchant vessel.

131
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:32,008
Where's Harry and everyone?

132
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,270
- You mean they're gone?
- Do you remember anything?

133
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:51,737
No. No.

134
00:18:57,494 --> 00:19:00,495
Yeah...

135
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:06,085
I was on deck and then...

136
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,842
- Then I was swimming to a star.
- To a light.

137
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:15,595
Let her call it a star.

138
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:21,393
The life-raft was blown over board
near you. It had an automatic flare.

139
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:25,273
I'm Fred Wilson, I'm in charge.

140
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:29,651
The yacht didn't get very far
after the SOS.

141
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:35,907
The radio reported that someone
found a piece of charred hull.

142
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:40,579
We're sorry, ma'am.

143
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:45,542
So am I.

144
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:51,049
Harry had discovered me.

145
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:58,389
He was going to put me in a movie
he was making in Hong Kong.

146
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:01,726
Dumb luck.

147
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,316
But I guess I really can't complain.

148
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:14,655
When you're alone adrift
in the Pacific and somebody just...

149
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:19,994
- Who spotted me, by the way?
- That young fellow.

150
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:27,169
How can I ever thank you?

151
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:34,135
I'm Dwan.

152
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:42,601
D- W-A-N. That's my name.
Like Dawn, -

153
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:48,691
- except that I switched two letters
to make it more memorable.

154
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:54,072
- I'm a mere Jack.
- You must be kidding.

155
00:20:54,322 --> 00:21:00,328
How could anybody
who saved my life be mere to me?

156
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:03,956
You need some rest.

157
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:09,295
I haven't had a good one of those
in years.

158
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:16,051
- Are we headed back to Singapore?
- Not directly, ma'am.

159
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:27,647
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm in no rush.

160
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,156
Harry probably wouldn't have
put me in that movie anyhow.

161
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:45,249
Oh, my God!

162
00:21:48,293 --> 00:21:52,214
What a meaningful miracle!

163
00:21:52,465 --> 00:21:56,843
- I owe my life to a movie.
- Is that so?

164
00:21:57,054 --> 00:22:00,221
I swear to God.

165
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:04,268
Harry was showing
this film that I refused to watch.

166
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:09,648
That's why I was up on deck
when the yacht exploded.

167
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,822
Did you ever meet anyone whose
life was saved by "Deep Throat"?

168
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:19,701
Come on, men, let her rest.

169
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:29,293
Maybe my luck has changed.

170
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:28,624
You know something?

171
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:33,505
I always wondered how Cortes felt
when he first saw the Inca treasure.

172
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:37,551
It was Pizarro,
and he died busted.

173
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:02,159
Here we go...
Solid land all right.

174
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:08,332
This is its profile east to west.
Typical Pacific formation...

175
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:13,130
This would be the slope at the beach,
the mountainous sector at the west.

176
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,631
Let's get in closer.

177
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:21,430
- What was that?
- Just a glitch.

178
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,808
- False echo off a flock of birds.
- Spot anything unusual?

179
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:29,895
- Not a thing.
- Look at the screen, Fred.

180
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:41,908
All those going ashore,
report to the companionway.

181
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:50,542
Hi there.
How do you like this for beach wear?

182
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:54,921
Fantastic. I'm afraid
you can't come ashore, though.

183
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:58,383
Wait a minute.

184
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:03,055
You said I could come
on the first boat.

185
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:06,933
You should wait
till the recon is gone.

186
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:10,937
You want full coverage
of this landing, don't you?

187
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:15,276
I must be in it. The all-American
girl saved from a yacht -

188
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:18,988
- by "Deep Throat".

189
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:25,202
- Don't print those, I'm married.
- Guaranteed to be on People Magazine.

190
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:29,540
- Printjust one.
- Really, Mr. Wilson...

191
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:33,837
I need a break,
and you owe it to me.

192
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:39,258
Because I am a holder of
a Petrox credit card. I really am!

193
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:42,262
Ask your computer.

194
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,643
<i>I may be late on my payments, but
you take 18%% % interest plus charges.</i>

195
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:55,609
Dwan, you come ashore with us.
Captain, she'll come ashore.

196
00:26:55,858 --> 00:27:01,073
Good luck. As soon as you get
through, get on the horn.

197
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,874
Hey, Jack? Maybe it's him.
Fred Wilson.

198
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:17,132
I had my horoscope done
before I flew to Hong Kong.

199
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:20,510
- It said that I was...
- Here you go.

200
00:27:22,344 --> 00:27:24,888
It said that I was going to cross
over water -

201
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,768
- and meet the biggest person
in my life.

202
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:22,114
That's interesting. The current is
18 degrees cooler than the air.

203
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:27,620
- What does that mean?
- The fog might lift at the edge.

204
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,000
Crossing 20 fathoms.
Shallowing rapidly.

205
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:41,093
Standing up ahead.
I think I hear breakers.

206
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:02,698
Shore boat to Explorer.
There's a curtain around the island.

207
00:29:02,947 --> 00:29:05,785
We just broke through.
There's a beach dead ahead.

208
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:09,455
<i>In two words: No problem.</i>

209
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:16,355
Let me get down! I haven't
touched the ground in weeks.

210
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,326
That's good.

211
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:31,955
Jack! I'm coming ashore.

212
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:37,128
Wait, hold it. All right.

213
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,551
Beautiful.

214
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:54,396
Let's start getting a line on this
island. Bring the mosquito spray!

215
00:30:54,604 --> 00:31:00,860
We won't have to start wondering
which way to go.

216
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:04,948
You want to start setting
seismic charges this morning?

217
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:10,787
- Yes. Got to knock the stucture.
- All right, move out!

218
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,803
There's a waterfall ahead!

219
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:30,391
Last one to get in
is a rotten egg.

220
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:17,814
Don't go running off anymore.

221
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:22,361
We'll wait here for them.

222
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:29,451
Just stick close by me, OK?

223
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:57,625
Holy Mother!
That looks as old as the pyramids.

224
00:33:57,876 --> 00:34:04,132
Could be. But the pyramids
weren't repaired six months ago.

225
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:10,555
There's earth on those timbers. It has
to be replaced after each monsoon.

226
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:15,019
Are you telling me
there's people here?

227
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:19,690
What's more, I'll characterize them.
Scared people.

228
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:24,695
- Scared of what?
- I don't exactly what it is.

229
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:31,160
But apparently, they thought
they needed a wall to keep it out.

230
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,873
Let me straighten you out
on a couple of points.

231
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:40,669
One: This wall is an ancient ruin.

232
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,466
Two: The island is uninhabited.

233
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:58,814
And three: There's an uninhabited
German beer hall in there.

234
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,649
Let's go.

235
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:17,686
Fred? Look down there.
Take your binoculars.

236
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:23,525
- What?
- Down there, that pool.

237
00:36:34,244 --> 00:36:39,041
- Do you think it could be?
- The surface seems viscous.

238
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,211
It sure as hell could be oil.

239
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:48,093
Sweet Jesus! Rockefeller!

240
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:13,451
- Maybe it's a wedding.
- A good guess.

241
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:18,331
It's scheduled for the night
when the moon's full.

242
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,381
Where's the groom?

243
00:37:34,097 --> 00:37:38,143
See the one
in the ape mask?

244
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:43,232
You might say
that's the groom's stand-in.

245
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:47,069
The groom is
on the other side of the wall.

246
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:51,449
You mean it's bad luck if they
see each other before the wedding?

247
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:54,201
Ghastly luck
for the whole congregation.

248
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:25,983
Oh, Christ!

249
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:35,536
You want to talk for us?

250
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:40,457
I'll try.

251
00:38:40,665 --> 00:38:43,919
Shoot in the air only.

252
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,180
What's he bitching about?

253
00:38:55,431 --> 00:39:01,105
He's probably telling us we've
contaminated their magic.

254
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:26,504
No.

255
00:39:32,552 --> 00:39:36,139
Remember, in the air.

256
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:01,207
What is it?

257
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:07,129
He wants to make a deal.
Six of them for Dwan.

258
00:40:07,337 --> 00:40:11,091
Tell them that I like him, too,
but not that way.

259
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:17,014
In the air!

260
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:47,983
- You'll have trouble with the chief.
- I will buy the chief.

261
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:51,903
What have we got
that wogs go for?

262
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:56,826
Radios, pots and pans,
all sorts ofjunk.

263
00:41:57,075 --> 00:42:02,206
This is no longer the 19th century.
You can'tjust grab their island.

264
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:05,375
I'll check that with the UN.
In the meantime -

265
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:08,670
- we scare them into the boondocks
with a July 4th number.

266
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:11,758
Are your men ready
to set the charges?

267
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:14,260
Kong! Kong!

268
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:19,098
You heard him chant.
He exists. You saw the wall.

269
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:22,226
Who do you think they were planning
to give the girl to?

270
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:28,483
It's some nutty religion.
A priest dresses up and gets laid.

271
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:32,236
We'll humor Jack.
Take plenty of TNT.

272
00:42:32,445 --> 00:42:36,116
Any sign of a monkey bigger
than four feet, send it bang-bang.

273
00:42:36,324 --> 00:42:39,160
- You wouldn't.
- Bet me.

274
00:42:42,455 --> 00:42:49,420
Even you wouldn't be asshole enough
to wipe out a unique new species.

275
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:56,512
The kids would burn every
Petrox gas station in the country.

276
00:43:09,274 --> 00:43:13,236
- He could be right.
- Kong, Kong, Kong...

277
00:43:15,782 --> 00:43:20,327
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to steal a boat.

278
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:25,833
- Seriously?
- As soon as I've swiped supplies.

279
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:31,047
- I'm going on a camera hunt.
- That sounds dangerous.

280
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:36,468
It's a chance of a lifetime. You
either grab it or you're dead meat.

281
00:43:36,721 --> 00:43:43,768
You shouldn't go ashore tonight.
It's not a good night for Aries.

282
00:43:44,018 --> 00:43:47,356
How did you know I was an Aries?

283
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,112
By the shape of your ears.

284
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:58,908
All right, I asked Fred Wilson.
He knows everything about you.

285
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,166
- I really wish you wouldn't go.
- Is it better to watch an old movie?

286
00:44:05,415 --> 00:44:07,876
There's nothing else to do.

287
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:11,130
Use your imagination.

288
00:44:13,132 --> 00:44:17,763
80 times around the deck
is a mile. We could jog.

289
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:32,193
I guess my camera hunt can wait
a couple of hours.

290
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:38,950
Excuse me, I'll just finish stealing
in the galley.

291
00:44:39,158 --> 00:44:43,037
You'll disappoint me if you're here
when I get back.

292
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:49,211
- What do you mean?
- I hope you'll wait in your cabin.

293
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:27,667
Here you are, son.
Get it out right away.

294
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:30,752
All right.

295
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:37,927
I said that pool might be oil.
We can't be sure...

296
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:43,975
Think positive. Guys who think
negative don't get far at Petrox.

297
00:45:44,226 --> 00:45:48,772
"Has to be the biggest ever.
No problems at all. "

298
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:55,319
- Well, you're the boss.
- Don't worry about it, Roy.

299
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:19,087
Help!

300
00:54:22,841 --> 00:54:26,261
Help me!

301
00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:39,483
No!

302
00:55:25,988 --> 00:55:29,951
We're too late.
Set off the show.

303
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:16,624
- Help him with that bolt.
- Cover the gate.

304
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:22,297
Get on the other side!
Pull!

305
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:30,138
Open that gate!

306
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:38,855
The lights will hold him back!
Don't shoot.

307
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:09,805
- He's taken her.
- No one's taken her.

308
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:14,600
Who do you think went through
there, some guy in an ape suit?

309
00:57:20,272 --> 00:57:24,402
- You all right?
- I just fell in a Goddamn hole.

310
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:28,989
No, you didn't.
You're not in a hole.

311
00:57:29,198 --> 00:57:32,201
That's a footprint.

312
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:54,182
Carnahan here. We've gone over two
miles. There's still no sign of her.

313
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:59,855
- It's better than finding remains.
- Unless he's gobbled her down.

314
00:58:00,064 --> 00:58:05,069
Give me that thing.
Mostjungle apes eat only fruit.

315
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:09,531
Mostjungle apes don't have
a size-90 foot.

316
00:58:09,782 --> 00:58:13,285
The men have had it.
I'm going to pitch camp.

317
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:16,539
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
Come on.

318
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:19,374
Keep moving.

319
00:58:23,087 --> 00:58:26,174
Carnahan's right.
It makes more sense to stop.

320
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:30,093
All right, Carnahan.
You know the drill.

321
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:34,640
We'll plant seismic charges
for mapping and fire rockets...

322
00:58:34,892 --> 00:58:40,022
- Right, right!
- Will somebody be on the radar?

323
00:58:42,941 --> 00:58:49,364
Any large, furry blimp seen moving
in your direction, you'll know.

324
00:58:51,574 --> 00:58:56,830
That footprint measured 6.4 feet.

325
00:58:57,081 --> 00:59:01,125
If that were for real.
How high would that make him?

326
00:59:01,335 --> 00:59:05,714
Multiplied by about eight, I guess.

327
00:59:07,925 --> 00:59:10,676
He'd make a hell of a commercial.

328
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:15,849
"The battles we at Petrox fight
to fill your tank. "

329
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:33,909
If he's not going to eat her,
why did he take her?

330
00:59:37,163 --> 00:59:42,042
Apes are very territorial.
He'll probably take her to his turf.

331
00:59:42,293 --> 00:59:44,586
What for?

332
00:59:44,796 --> 00:59:49,342
Joe said you said that the ape
was going to marry her.

333
00:59:49,592 --> 00:59:55,014
- Is that some kind ofjoke or...
- I don't know, Carnahan!

334
00:59:55,265 --> 01:00:00,770
I'm as ignorant as you. Quit asking
me so many dumb questions.

335
01:03:01,248 --> 01:03:04,416
I can't stand heights.

336
01:03:07,505 --> 01:03:14,552
Honest I can't. When I was ten I got
sick in the Empire State Building.

337
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:24,313
Put me down!

338
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:31,236
You put me down!

339
01:03:37,075 --> 01:03:41,205
You put me down!

340
01:03:43,624 --> 01:03:47,420
Put me down.

341
01:03:52,634 --> 01:03:56,221
Please put me down.

342
01:04:10,652 --> 01:04:14,405
You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape!

343
01:04:14,657 --> 01:04:19,119
What are you waiting for?
You wanna eat me?

344
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:26,335
Then go ahaed! Do it!
Go ahead and eat me!

345
01:04:26,543 --> 01:04:30,922
Go ahead! Choke on me!

346
01:04:37,054 --> 01:04:42,101
I didn't mean that.
Sometimes I get too physical.

347
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:47,482
It's a sign of insecurity,
like when you knock down trees.

348
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:57,117
Such a nice ape.
Such a nice, sweet monkey.

349
01:04:58,701 --> 01:05:02,623
We're going to be great friends.

350
01:05:02,872 --> 01:05:09,505
I'm a Libra, what sign are you?
No, don't tell me.

351
01:05:09,755 --> 01:05:14,675
I'll bet you're an Aries.
Of course you are.

352
01:05:14,927 --> 01:05:18,262
I think that's just wonderful.

353
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,784
Help me!

354
01:06:24,164 --> 01:06:26,374
Help me!

355
01:07:15,675 --> 01:07:19,179
Radar had him on the screen.

356
01:07:19,429 --> 01:07:26,394
3.6 kilometres west of your flare.
He moved in a random manner.

357
01:07:26,603 --> 01:07:31,150
- Not in our direction?
- Affirmative. Random. Like a circle.

358
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:35,987
Maybe he's lost her. She got away
and he's searching for her.

359
01:07:36,238 --> 01:07:39,325
Carnahan! Wait a minute!

360
01:07:39,575 --> 01:07:43,955
<i>- Have you set seismic charges?
- The men are doing it now.</i>

361
01:07:44,163 --> 01:07:48,543
- Don't move until it's finished.
- He's nuts.

362
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:54,632
The girl might be running for her life
from a gigantic turned-on ape.

363
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:58,678
I know how you feel.

364
01:07:58,928 --> 01:08:01,597
But there's an energy crisis.

365
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:06,477
We must all rise above
our self-interests.

366
01:08:06,686 --> 01:08:12,191
- You hypocritical bastard...
- Save your wind, he's signed off.

367
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,861
Let's get going.

368
01:08:15,069 --> 01:08:18,322
I ain't busting my ass for no whites.

369
01:08:18,573 --> 01:08:24,497
OK. Who gives a shit that
the ape's headed in our direction?

370
01:10:40,218 --> 01:10:45,182
- There's Roy.
- Well, Fred...

371
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:48,894
I finished testing the samples
from that pool.

372
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:53,523
- It'll be real great oil!
- Son of a bitch!

373
01:10:54,983 --> 01:10:57,653
Fred Wilson is crazy, is he?

374
01:10:57,861 --> 01:11:02,741
Wait till those candy-asses
in New York hear about this.

375
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:07,205
- I'll grind them...
- Like I said, it will be great oil.

376
01:11:07,412 --> 01:11:13,086
As soon as Mother Nature
finishes cooking it a little longer.

377
01:11:13,294 --> 01:11:15,713
How much longer?

378
01:11:15,962 --> 01:11:21,968
Hardly a tick of clock, in geological
terms. Say 10,000 years.

379
01:11:23,222 --> 01:11:29,393
Till then you'd get better mileage
filling your Cadillac with mule piss.

380
01:11:31,646 --> 01:11:34,316
Oh, my God!

381
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:39,738
I hate to kick a fella when he's dead,
but I told you.

382
01:11:39,988 --> 01:11:45,119
You shouldn't have told New York
you were bringing in the big one.

383
01:11:48,454 --> 01:11:52,751
The big one. Jesus!

384
01:11:55,045 --> 01:11:59,758
Who says I ain't gonna?
Wilson to Explorer.

385
01:12:00,008 --> 01:12:03,762
Get me a channel to Surabaya,
I want an engineer drop.

386
01:12:20,864 --> 01:12:23,699
OK, Jack, you go first.

387
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,989
- Come on, it's solid as a rock.
- OK, let's go.

388
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:21,550
- Stop firing!
- Jack!

389
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:48,493
Boan! Try to make it back.

390
01:15:51,454 --> 01:15:54,708
I'm going on.

391
01:16:24,572 --> 01:16:28,160
<i>All hands, stand by for recovery.</i>

392
01:16:47,262 --> 01:16:50,807
- Over and out.
- Recharge the batteries.

393
01:16:51,016 --> 01:16:55,353
- Air drop done, right on target.
- Perfect. Haul your asses.

394
01:16:55,562 --> 01:16:59,608
Get that equipment working.

395
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:02,444
- You think I'm crazy?
- You said it.

396
01:17:02,652 --> 01:17:07,991
If I had found oil, Gulf, Shell, Exxon
would be crawling all over here.

397
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:12,245
Not this one, pal.
Kong is all me and Petrox.

398
01:17:12,455 --> 01:17:18,211
A Fred S. Wilson exclusive.
Move your ass, Shorty.

399
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:25,802
You think it'll ring the bell?
Promise oil, bring back a monkey?

400
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:31,474
Look at Exxon's
"We'll Put a Tiger in Your Tank".

401
01:17:31,682 --> 01:17:37,146
Beach green to Carnahan.
Report back immediately.

402
01:17:37,355 --> 01:17:40,858
Do nothing to endanger Kong.
Acknowledge.

403
01:17:42,235 --> 01:17:47,490
Carnahan, do you read me?
Do you read me?

404
01:18:20,233 --> 01:18:23,903
Give us a hand over here.

405
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:33,746
Wilson!
Still no contact with Carnahan.

406
01:18:33,954 --> 01:18:38,126
- The radio's not working. No sweat.
- I want to take out a search party.

407
01:18:38,334 --> 01:18:43,506
- I can't spare any men.
- Six guys are cut off in the bush.

408
01:18:43,715 --> 01:18:49,305
And you're building monkey traps.
You're playing with their lives.

409
01:18:49,512 --> 01:18:52,432
Don't worry about it.

410
01:18:58,354 --> 01:19:01,857
Boan!

411
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:08,365
Where's the others?

412
01:19:48,115 --> 01:19:52,076
Come on, Kong, forget about me.

413
01:19:52,284 --> 01:19:57,957
This is never going to work.
Can't you see?

414
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:28,028
Jack!

415
01:23:51,196 --> 01:23:54,117
We've got to do it.

416
01:23:54,325 --> 01:23:57,494
Are you ready?

417
01:24:24,524 --> 01:24:29,819
Radar update. Monkey spotted
1,800 yards west by north-west -

418
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:35,367
<i>- heading 0-89,
velocity 2.2 miles per hour.</i>

419
01:24:35,576 --> 01:24:40,289
<i>Estimated time to your position,
five minutes or less.</i>

420
01:24:40,496 --> 01:24:44,501
Kill the lights.
Everybody clear out!

421
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:58,599
- Logan, how are you doing?
- Almost finished. One minute more.

422
01:25:03,062 --> 01:25:07,525
- That's enough.
- All set, Mr. Bagley!

423
01:25:10,195 --> 01:25:14,699
- Ready, Boan?
- OK. It's hot now.

424
01:25:14,908 --> 01:25:20,079
Are you sure that monkey will
be able to bust through that gate?

425
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:25,125
Pull back the bolt halfway.

426
01:25:32,259 --> 01:25:35,428
- Come on.
- I can't.

427
01:26:15,262 --> 01:26:18,597
Open the gate! Help!

428
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:24,354
- Help!
- Jack!

429
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:29,108
It's Prescott, open the gate.

430
01:26:45,959 --> 01:26:48,713
Come on!

431
01:27:02,935 --> 01:27:05,354
Close the bolt!

432
01:28:42,787 --> 01:28:46,666
Wilson, blow the Goddamn thing!

433
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:44,725
Still want to play?

434
01:31:46,684 --> 01:31:50,814
Dwan! Congratulations.

435
01:32:02,993 --> 01:32:06,372
Hey, Jack.
Do I look different?

436
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:13,087
- Yeah, you shine.
- That's right.

437
01:32:13,295 --> 01:32:16,216
- I'm a star.
- It's all set.

438
01:32:16,423 --> 01:32:22,389
Coast-to-coast tour. We open in
New York. Lights, cameras, Kong!

439
01:32:22,596 --> 01:32:25,809
And probably Nureyev and Fontaine.

440
01:32:26,016 --> 01:32:31,440
I want Balanchine to choreograph
"The Beauty and the Beast".

441
01:32:33,358 --> 01:32:36,235
Any chance of you two
getting married?

442
01:32:36,445 --> 01:32:41,365
I don't know.
This is so sudden.

443
01:32:41,574 --> 01:32:46,955
We could think of some nutty way
of Kong giving away the bride.

444
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:57,300
It'd be tough to get him to do it.
Probably just old-fashioned, huh?

445
01:32:57,507 --> 01:33:02,220
I don't know.
What do you think, Jack?

446
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:13,899
Christ.

447
01:33:17,195 --> 01:33:23,909
After all these years,
I'll finally end up with a shrink.

448
01:33:31,334 --> 01:33:35,171
How can I become a star
because of someone -

449
01:33:35,378 --> 01:33:40,761
- that was stolen off that gorgeous
island and locked up in that tank?

450
01:33:40,968 --> 01:33:47,392
It's not someone. It's an animal
that tried to rape you.

451
01:33:47,601 --> 01:33:52,189
That's not true.
He risked his life to save me.

452
01:33:52,397 --> 01:33:55,150
He tried to rape you, honey.

453
01:33:55,358 --> 01:33:59,654
Ask the natives what they thought
of losing Kong.

454
01:33:59,863 --> 01:34:04,158
- They'll miss him a lot.
- Like leprosy.

455
01:34:04,368 --> 01:34:10,958
You're dead wrong. He was the
terror, the mystery of their lives.

456
01:34:12,251 --> 01:34:17,172
A year from now, the island
will be full of burned-out drunks.

457
01:34:17,381 --> 01:34:21,635
When we took Kong,
we kidnapped their god.

458
01:34:25,597 --> 01:34:28,768
It's like there's a curse
on all of us.

459
01:34:28,976 --> 01:34:31,979
I'm tired of your trying to confuse
this girl.

460
01:34:32,188 --> 01:34:35,900
This is her big chance. And yours.
There's stars at Princeton -

461
01:34:36,108 --> 01:34:41,073
- just like in Hollywood. You want
me to get Kong another keeper?

462
01:34:41,281 --> 01:34:44,408
Coast-to-coast tours?
"Beauty and the Beast"? It's a farce.

463
01:34:44,618 --> 01:34:49,079
Just say the word and your contract
is torn up. Tell me right now.

464
01:34:54,127 --> 01:34:57,046
See you opening night.

465
01:35:09,852 --> 01:35:14,106
Oh, God,
I'm tired of thinking.

466
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:31,500
- The ape had the right idea.
- What's that?

467
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:45,158
Wait a minute.

468
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:51,497
I'll be right back.

469
01:37:38,504 --> 01:37:41,965
<i>All hands on deck!</i>

470
01:37:46,553 --> 01:37:50,475
<i>Fire detaiI,
report to the controI room.</i>

471
01:37:54,104 --> 01:37:58,232
<i>This is the captain.
Sea water pumps to full pressure.</i>

472
01:37:58,442 --> 01:38:03,071
<i>Prepare to flood tank No. 4.
I"m ordering the ape drowned.</i>

473
01:38:06,575 --> 01:38:10,912
Hey, Kong! Here I am.

474
01:38:16,459 --> 01:38:21,215
Do you remember me?
Remember your blind date?

475
01:38:21,422 --> 01:38:24,468
You haven't forgotten, have you?

476
01:38:33,185 --> 01:38:38,358
Dwan! Come back here!
He's going berserk.

477
01:38:38,566 --> 01:38:42,736
- Stop, or I'll jump.
- Dwan, please.

478
01:38:42,945 --> 01:38:47,533
- You can't help him now.
- Don't come any closer.

479
01:38:47,742 --> 01:38:50,286
OK.

480
01:38:52,913 --> 01:38:58,879
Hey, Kong? Why are you waking up
all these people?

481
01:38:59,086 --> 01:39:04,384
No one's going to hurt you.
You're just going to be a star.

482
01:39:13,477 --> 01:39:17,772
Don't flood the tank! She fell in.

483
01:41:25,945 --> 01:41:28,741
You could've...

484
01:42:30,053 --> 01:42:34,015
Jack! I'm so glad to see you.

485
01:42:36,977 --> 01:42:42,608
- What is it? You're not dressed.
- That's right.

486
01:42:42,816 --> 01:42:47,321
I was wrong when I called this
thing a farce, it's a tragedy.

487
01:42:47,529 --> 01:42:52,869
- I'm quitting your circus, Fred.
- You signed a contract.

488
01:42:53,076 --> 01:42:55,996
- You took an advance.
- I donated it in your name.

489
01:42:56,205 --> 01:43:01,669
To the SPCA Fund for Sending
Kong Home. Here's your receipt.

490
01:43:01,878 --> 01:43:06,799
- Sue me.
- Don't leave me tonight, please.

491
01:43:07,009 --> 01:43:11,137
- My horoscope says...
- Shut up. I love you.

492
01:43:15,057 --> 01:43:20,313
Come with me right now.
The hell with the contract.

493
01:43:20,521 --> 01:43:25,486
Go ahead. But I promise you
you'll never get another booking.

494
01:43:25,693 --> 01:43:29,656
You'll end up tap-dancing
at rotary clubs.

495
01:43:32,116 --> 01:43:37,331
- Don't you understand?
- Yeah...

496
01:43:37,538 --> 01:43:42,211
I do. Sorry.

497
01:43:44,838 --> 01:43:48,091
Stay well.

498
01:44:10,949 --> 01:44:14,786
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of our TV-satellite audience, -</i>

499
01:44:14,994 --> 01:44:18,832
<i>- you are seeing this
live around the world-</i>

500
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:24,711
<i>- as it is happening
here in New York City.</i>

501
01:44:24,922 --> 01:44:31,719
<i>You have better seats than these
lucky King Kong contest winners.</i>

502
01:44:52,866 --> 01:44:58,621
Thus, Beauty set foot on the
forbidden island and was seized.

503
01:44:58,831 --> 01:45:02,208
Great was the fear
as Beauty was lashed -

504
01:45:02,418 --> 01:45:07,465
- to the dreadful bridal altar
of the Beast.

505
01:45:07,673 --> 01:45:11,636
Now the earth booms.

506
01:45:45,796 --> 01:45:51,009
Kong's power!
Superpower!

507
01:45:53,054 --> 01:45:56,265
Hail the power!

508
01:46:29,465 --> 01:46:34,930
That's the power of Kong,
and Petrox!

509
01:46:46,941 --> 01:46:49,779
No! Don't push her around!

510
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:02,082
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is nothing to fear!

511
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:08,840
That is an escape-proof cage
certified by the city government.

512
01:47:32,614 --> 01:47:36,701
Come on out! Easy.

513
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:40,580
His feet are still chained.

514
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:46,002
It's all right. Come on.

515
01:49:44,707 --> 01:49:47,210
We're in position.

516
01:49:47,419 --> 01:49:52,257
The Queensboro Bridge is buttoned
up. What's the situation at Brooklyn?

517
01:49:52,466 --> 01:49:56,637
<i>I"II tell that monkey to spread
before he crosses it.</i>

518
01:49:59,306 --> 01:50:02,602
Come on, there's a train coming.

519
01:52:04,185 --> 01:52:06,728
Hit the lights.

520
01:52:22,369 --> 01:52:26,541
<i>This is a message to all traffic.</i>

521
01:52:26,748 --> 01:52:30,710
<i>Clear all streets.
Proceed to shelters.</i>

522
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:38,386
<i>Repeating: Clear all streets. Any
person found looting will be shot.</i>

523
01:52:56,488 --> 01:52:59,365
Keep running.

524
01:52:59,574 --> 01:53:04,412
Jack! Buy me a drink, will you?

525
01:53:04,621 --> 01:53:07,541
Come on, buy me a drink.

526
01:53:07,748 --> 01:53:11,879
Ten more blocks and we've got
the key to a great apartment.

527
01:53:12,087 --> 01:53:15,007
We've put a river between us.

528
01:53:15,215 --> 01:53:19,635
The bridges are mined, and apes
don't swim. Your book says so.

529
01:53:19,846 --> 01:53:25,600
Please, buy me a drink.
Buy me a drink over there.

530
01:53:28,062 --> 01:53:30,398
OK.

531
01:53:33,775 --> 01:53:36,737
What's the matter?

532
01:53:36,946 --> 01:53:42,494
Déjà vu. I don't know where,
but I've seen this view before.

533
01:54:16,986 --> 01:54:20,156
Here.

534
01:54:20,365 --> 01:54:24,161
We don't want to get shot as looters.

535
01:54:24,370 --> 01:54:28,749
OK, get smashed.

536
01:54:28,958 --> 01:54:34,004
How about that nice offer
you made me? Do you still want me?

537
01:54:36,967 --> 01:54:42,972
Look, chinchilla.
Looks great on you.

538
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:48,226
I asked you a question.

539
01:54:48,435 --> 01:54:52,273
- You know what I earn?
- Do you think I need furs?

540
01:54:52,482 --> 01:54:58,696
Yes. Excitement is in your blood
like dope.

541
01:55:00,407 --> 01:55:05,162
You're going to need new fixes
I'm not able to give you.

542
01:55:05,370 --> 01:55:08,707
Don't be stupid.

543
01:55:46,037 --> 01:55:48,830
It's OK.

544
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:56,213
Probably some National Guardsman
ran his tank into a powerhouse.

545
01:55:56,422 --> 01:55:59,592
Do you remember that black-out?

546
01:55:59,801 --> 01:56:05,223
And all the babies born
exactly nine months later?

547
01:56:05,431 --> 01:56:10,269
Well, here's to all the future
sons and daughters of King Kong.

548
01:56:11,479 --> 01:56:14,524
I'll drink to that.

549
01:56:17,026 --> 01:56:23,784
The hell with furs. Tell me,
does that nice offer still stand?

550
01:56:25,577 --> 01:56:32,334
It depends on Kong. He's bigger
than both of us, know what I mean?

551
01:56:32,544 --> 01:56:35,337
Don't tease me, I'm serious.

552
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:45,306
Of course. I know
where I've seen that view before.

553
01:56:58,570 --> 01:57:03,449
I think we've got a chance. Sit tight,
I've got to make a phone call.

554
01:57:04,868 --> 01:57:08,620
Keep it down, everyone.

555
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:12,834
What do you think?
Is he flipped out or not?

556
01:57:13,041 --> 01:57:17,672
Hello? Hello...

557
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:21,510
Excuse me, Professor. You say
you know where Kong is headed.

558
01:57:21,719 --> 01:57:25,346
Yes.
You can trap him without danger.

559
01:57:25,556 --> 01:57:30,018
Get some helicopters and
blasting nets on top of him.

560
01:57:30,227 --> 01:57:35,523
No problem. Where is he headed,
Professor Prescott?

561
01:57:35,733 --> 01:57:41,489
Promise me to capture him
without injury and I'll tell you.

562
01:57:50,663 --> 01:57:54,960
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, Professor.

563
01:57:55,169 --> 01:57:57,670
Where is Kong heading?

564
01:57:57,881 --> 01:58:03,553
A place in Manhattan that looks
exactly like his natural habitat.

565
01:58:03,762 --> 01:58:08,098
Let him climb to the top of
the World Trade Center.

566
01:58:47,430 --> 01:58:50,351
Jack!

567
01:59:20,506 --> 01:59:25,471
He's coming down Fifth Avenue
on schedule.

568
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:31,559
The power is back on.
Keep quiet, get in the shadows.

569
02:00:13,978 --> 02:00:16,355
No.

570
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:17,251
Hold on! Close your eyes!

571
02:01:17,459 --> 02:01:21,715
The helicopters are coming
to net him!

572
02:02:06,761 --> 02:02:09,430
Hold on!

573
02:03:30,263 --> 02:03:33,016
Kong...

574
02:04:06,133 --> 02:04:10,888
What are those men doing up there?
Didn't they get my orders?

575
02:05:33,055 --> 02:05:35,684
The rotten bastards!

576
02:05:53,785 --> 02:06:00,210
He's still got the girl. Follow me
in a tight holding pattern.

577
02:06:21,105 --> 02:06:25,359
No! Don't put me down.

578
02:06:25,567 --> 02:06:29,364
Hold on to me.

579
02:06:31,783 --> 02:06:35,577
Hold on to me, or they'll kill you.

580
02:06:42,877 --> 02:06:45,420
Now!

581
02:06:53,096 --> 02:06:55,598
Oh, God.

582
02:07:11,282 --> 02:07:13,701
Wait.

583
02:07:21,542 --> 02:07:24,211
Hold on to me.

584
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:28,340
Please don't let me go.

585
02:07:40,728 --> 02:07:43,106
Don't kill him!

586
02:07:45,775 --> 02:07:48,319
Don't kill him!

587
02:08:00,832 --> 02:08:03,667
Assholes!

588
02:09:09,068 --> 02:09:11,614
Kong.

589
02:11:00,516 --> 02:11:03,311
Dwan!

590
02:11:03,519 --> 02:11:06,231
Jack!

591
02:11:07,732 --> 02:11:10,819
Jack!
