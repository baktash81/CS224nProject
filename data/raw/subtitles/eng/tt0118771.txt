1
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:16,802
Jesus!

2
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:20,999
Asshole!

3
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,007
Man, did you see that?

4
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,171
I mean, he pulled right 
out in front of me.

5
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:28,809
Took my eyes off the road for 
a second, but I mean, come on.

6
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:32,345
Maybe it's time we take a little break.

7
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:34,324
Yeah.

8
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:39,789
Pull over the next chance we get.

9
00:04:17,197 --> 00:04:17,925
Nice car.

10
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,362
Thanks.

11
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,266
You got your air... CD...

12
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:28,103
Leather.

13
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:34,376
Looks to me like you sprung 
for the whole nine yards.

14
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,244
Yeah. I guess so.

15
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:39,989
But err... 'spose that rig
of yours there is what you...

16
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,989
really need out here, huh?

17
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,853
Why would you want
a piece of shit like that...

18
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:46,066
when you got a ride like this?!

19
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,600
What a man needs out here is a C.B. Radio.

20
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:57,164
Yeah, is that right?

21
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,809
'Course if you use a C.B. 
you gotta have a handle.

22
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:03,750
I'm thinking, for you...

23
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:05,074
'Shit For Brains'.

24
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:07,050
Tell me something, do you 
even care that you...

25
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,001
damn near killed us
back there, boy?!

26
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:11,512
I didn't really, even,
see you, ok? I mean...

27
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:12,553
you kinda pulled
out in fronta me...

28
00:05:12,553 --> 00:05:13,761
Like hell I did!

29
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:14,987
I saw what happened!

30
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:16,112
Let's just forget this, ok?

31
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:19,329
I mean... I'm sorry it 
ever happened.

32
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:21,329
I don't want any 
trouble... I mean...

33
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:24,691
No, I'll bet you don't.

34
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:29,529
Howdy, Ma'am.

35
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,268
Oughta be more careful 
who you ride with.

36
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:35,670
- What was <i>that</i> all about?
- Nothing.

37
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,243
Guy in the truck.

38
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,312
Thinks I tried to hit him!

39
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:46,090
Come on, Honey, let's go.

40
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,174
Do you want me to drive?

41
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:49,182
No l.. later. Just... get in.

42
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,155
How 'bout if I promise not
to sidewipe anyone?

43
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:54,529
Just get in!

44
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,118
I'm kidding!

45
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:24,962
You getting ready for 
the Grand Prix?

46
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:29,619
What'd you get?

47
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:32,958
Oh, junk food fiesta.

48
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,197
Let's see...

49
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:36,196
Sno Balls.

50
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,095
Yoo Hoo.

51
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:40,905
And Moon Pies.

52
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,975
Can you believe they still 
make this stuff?

53
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:47,389
Kidding? It's probably gourmet
cuisine around here!

54
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:59,593
Ha, ha, ha. This is crazy, 
look at this...

55
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:04,399
It says, 'if you win this mail-in contest'...

56
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,103
'you can choose between 
ninety-thousand dollars'...

57
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,843
'or, ninety-thousand donuts'.

58
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:19,513
What would you <i>do</i> with 
ninety-thousand donuts?

59
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:22,384
I don't know... sell them 
for thirty cents each...

60
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,484
and pay off this car.

61
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:25,382
No kidding.

62
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,486
Ninety-thousand dollars!

63
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,118
That'd solve some problems.

64
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,197
What the hell's?

65
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:42,564
What did you do?

66
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:43,863
Oh, nothing... I...

67
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,570
Hang on, I can't steer.

68
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,025
Unbelieveable!

69
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:38,614
Perfect.

70
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:40,088
Outta range?

71
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:45,168
Well, so much for taking 
the scenic route.

72
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,704
Well, looks like the baffle 
gasket's burned out.

73
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:51,363
What?

74
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,274
Yeah, It's connected to the 
err... connecting rod.

75
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:56,467
Oh God... shut up!

76
00:08:57,677 --> 00:09:00,202
Oh man, can you believe this?

77
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:04,318
This could be the worst decision
you've ever made.

78
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,044
- What are you doing?
- No, just listen... I mean...

79
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:08,812
We're changing jobs.

80
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:09,723
- Yeah?
- Right.

81
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:12,427
Our finances are... 
pretty well fucked, and...

82
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:13,527
Yeah.

83
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,595
And we are, out in the 
middle of nowhere, so...

84
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:18,898
Yeah, I'd say this <i>is</i> the worst
decision you've ever...

85
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:21,189
Get out of here, you're bugging me.

86
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:23,093
Okay, sweetie.

87
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:25,733
Good luck, 'cos I'm going to California.

88
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:28,208
No problem, just leave 
me the Moon Pies.

89
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,373
- Ah, Jeff?
- And the donuts.

90
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,410
No, no, there's a car.

91
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,480
Oh Christ, not these guys.

92
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,527
Assholes.

93
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,701
Jeff...

94
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:19,484
What the hell is...

95
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,121
- Mmm... what's he doing?
- I don't know.

96
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:30,230
Ahh, this... this isn't good.

97
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,668
Hey! Ho!

98
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:03,531
Hi. Folks alright?

99
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,499
Fine. Our... car broke down.

100
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,504
Yeah... saw that.

101
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:09,909
You want me to give you a hand
pushing it off the road?

102
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:10,503
Thanks for the help.

103
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:12,611
- Honey, you wanna steer?
- Yeah.

104
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:16,218
Right, ok.

105
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:21,481
Massachusetts plates. 
You folks on vacation?

106
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,779
No... we're moving.

107
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:26,019
Oh yeah? Whereabouts?

108
00:11:26,526 --> 00:11:27,720
Ahh, San Diego.

109
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:32,059
Listen, you think we could 
could use your C.B.?

110
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,934
Radio a tow truck to help us?

111
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:35,070
I wish I could, mister...

112
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,472
but I blew a fuse on that 
thing this morning...

113
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm waiting 'til I get down to the
truckstop at I40 to get it fixed.

114
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,368
How far is that?

115
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,172
About 60 miles.

116
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:44,001
Oh... well...

117
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:45,634
just driving along 
and she quit on me.

118
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:48,841
Oh dear. Oil... belts...
battery's working.

119
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:51,555
You know, used to be you 
could give these things...

120
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,122
a kick and a holler and
they'd start right up.

121
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:55,422
Now they got computers.
and chips, and, shh...

122
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,081
It is a new car.

123
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:58,692
You know, that could be it.

124
00:11:58,792 --> 00:11:59,850
You been riding this 
thing pretty hard?

125
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,498
'Cos they tend to overheat
when they're new.

126
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:08,236
Well, yeah, I admit 
a little, but I...

127
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:10,961
Tell you what.

128
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,001
I can give you a 
ride to Belle's...

129
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,508
little diner about five miles
down the road.

130
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,370
They got a payphone.

131
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,478
You call a tow truck, they just
come in and haul you out.

132
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:19,506
Ahh...

133
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,200
you know...

134
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,717
that's really nice of
you to offer.

135
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:23,317
But I think you got it.

136
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:26,286
I think we'll just... let her cool 
off a little bit and...

137
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:28,622
Thanks a lot, we really
appreciate it.

138
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:30,337
I wish you luck getting
it started.

139
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:32,180
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

140
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,520
- Honey.
- Ahh, I think he's right.

141
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,030
I think it's probably
just overheated.

142
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,367
Right, but what if 
it's not, I mean...

143
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,367
we don't wanna be 
stuck out here do we?

144
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,996
No, but I... just give it 
it some time.

145
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,040
Let it cool off.
We'll be alright.

146
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,912
Getting... pretty toasty
out here...

147
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:52,112
you sure you wanna
blow this ride?

148
00:12:52,112 --> 00:12:53,979
No, but...

149
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,484
don't know if I wanna leave
the car alone either.

150
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,823
Ok... what if I take the ride,
call a tow truck, and...

151
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:02,823
order a nice, cold, iced tea?

152
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:04,001
Mmm hmm.

153
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:06,359
And I stay here with 
a nice hot car.

154
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,090
Right.

155
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,921
Right.

156
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:12,699
Sure you're alright?

157
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,563
No, I'll be fine, Honey.

158
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,194
Hello! Excuse me!

159
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:22,242
Care if I take you
up on that ride?

160
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:23,570
Sure. Step on up.

161
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,200
Sure your husband doesn't 
wanna come with us...

162
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,500
there's plenty of room in the back?

163
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,776
No, no, he's gonna stay 
the car. But thank you.

164
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:33,416
Ok... good luck.

165
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,009
What the... hell?!

166
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:55,307
Ha!

167
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:01,897
Tow truck, my ass!

168
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:48,613
Excuse me. I was supposed 
to meet my wife here.

169
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:52,659
Err, she's dark-haired, 
about... five-five...

170
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,763
wearing like a... a white
Benetton sweater.

171
00:15:56,863 --> 00:15:57,797
White what?

172
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:58,661
Err, Benetton sweater.

173
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:00,490
Hank!

174
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,357
Your order's up.

175
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,671
Look I'm pretty busy here,
people come and go.

176
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:06,584
Well... this was within 
the last half-hour.

177
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:07,225
Excuse me.

178
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,509
She... she might have 
been with a trucker.

179
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,066
Trucker?

180
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,348
Yeah, a guy wearing
a baseball cap.

181
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,248
Err... driving a big 
eighteen-wheeler.

182
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:16,212
Doesn't ring a bell.

183
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:18,841
You sure?

184
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,089
Hey, the man here's 
looking for his wife.

185
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:26,292
Dark hair... got a white,
button-on sweater.

186
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:27,956
Travelling with a guy 
with a baseball cap.

187
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:29,859
Has anybody here seen 'em?

188
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:37,573
Looks like she got away 
from you, Cowboy.

189
00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:43,011
You err... you think maybe she 
could have left a message...

190
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:45,511
with one of your other
other employees? Or...

191
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:46,800
I don't see how that's possible. 

192
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,616
You see, I'm the only 
one that works here.

193
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:51,716
Well...

194
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:54,821
is there another 
another Belle's Diner?

195
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:58,355
No siree. Definitely not! Ha ha.

196
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:40,070
Excuse me.

197
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,727
She and I must have got
our signals crossed here.

198
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,001
How far is the next town?

199
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:46,936
'Bout twenny miles.

200
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:48,638
Could you do me a favour?

201
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:50,877
If my wife comes in,
her name's Amy...

202
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:52,281
would you just, tell 
here I was here...

203
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,381
and tell her to stay put...

204
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:55,581
'til I get back, and not move?

205
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:57,277
Could you do that, please?

206
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:00,442
- Yeah, Okay.
- Thanks.

207
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:07,054
Hey! Pull over!

208
00:19:09,154 --> 00:19:10,930
Pull over!

209
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,156
I don't believe it.

210
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:23,458
Jesus!

211
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,403
Christ!

212
00:19:57,503 --> 00:19:58,401
Hey, man...

213
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:02,709
The hell you doing, buddy?

214
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:04,768
I was trying to get you to 
pull over. Didn't you see me?!

215
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:05,979
Yeah!

216
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,841
Well?

217
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,105
Err... never mind. Listen, I, I, I... 
I'm looking for my wife.

218
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:10,917
What?

219
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,145
My wife. Where is she?

220
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:15,488
How should I know
where your wife is?

221
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,999
I'm the guy with the Jeep.

222
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,555
You gave my wife a ride.

223
00:20:18,555 --> 00:20:20,193
You were supposed to drop
her off at Belle's Diner.

224
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:21,100
Not me, sorry.

225
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,861
Wait a minute... 
what you mean 'sorry'?

226
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,692
This was like a half an hour
ago, for Christ's sake.

227
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:26,466
You don't remember?!

228
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,535
Look, I don't know how 
to tell you this...

229
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:30,772
but I've never seen you
before in my life.

230
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:33,500
What are you doing?

231
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:37,574
Amy!

232
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:42,817
Amy, are you in there?!

233
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,215
Look, mister, I don't
know what you want...

234
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:49,599
I want my wife back,
is what I <i>want</i>!

235
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,699
Now what have you done...

236
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,599
Hey!

237
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:02,236
Officer! Officer, I need 
you help here.

238
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,100
- What's the problem?
- I don't know...

239
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,305
I think this guy's done 
something with my wife.

240
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:09,142
Alright. Calm down, sir.
Tell me what's going on.

241
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:10,576
I don't know what the
hell's going on.

242
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:13,114
Last I saw her, she 
was with this guy...

243
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:14,214
in his truck.

244
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:16,672
Now he's saying he's 
never seen her.

245
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,851
Officer... I don't know what
he's talking about.

246
00:21:18,951 --> 00:21:19,951
Don't lie. You son-of-a-bitch!

247
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:20,999
Alright, alright, calm down.

248
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,999
Alright, now tell me exactly
what happened, sir.

249
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:24,123
Ok. Alright.

250
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:26,992
Our car broke down.

251
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:30,225
Now he stopped, offered to help...

252
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,998
took my wife to a pay phone
but she... she never showed up.

253
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,303
Sir, what do you have 
to say about this?

254
00:21:37,403 --> 00:21:38,370
Officer, I don't know.

255
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:42,302
I'm driving along... this 
fella runs me off the road...

256
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:43,669
starts hollering about his wife.

257
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:46,248
I swear, I've never seen 
him before in my life.

258
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,848
And you didn't give 
his wife a ride?

259
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:50,973
- No, sir.
- He's lying!

260
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:57,413
Sir, would it be alright with
you if I search your truck?

261
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:58,518
Hell, yes. Go ahead.

262
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:02,095
Name's Barr, by the way.
Red Barr.

263
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,354
All my, err, permits 
are current.

264
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:04,563
You can see 'em, they're
right up in there.

265
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:05,563
That won't be necessary.

266
00:22:05,563 --> 00:22:07,727
Just stand back behind 
the line, both of you.

267
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:48,600
I need to see your license
and registration, please.

268
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:13,194
Those yours?

269
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:15,701
Yeah.

270
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:18,068
It's my, err, personal stuff.
You wanna take a look?

271
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:28,548
No... no, I think we're
pretty much done here.

272
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:29,505
You're free to go.

273
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:31,482
Wait a minute, whoa, whoa, 
whoa, wait a second... that's it?

274
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:33,310
You're not gonna question
him anymore?

275
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,715
Sir, I've searched the truck.

276
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,001
There's no evidence of 
suspicious activity here.

277
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:38,591
- No sign of a struggle.
- What?

278
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:39,691
Look, I don't mean 
to butt in, but...

279
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:41,427
maybe you confused my truck 
with somebody elses.

280
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:42,888
Go to hell you son-of-a-bitch!
Let me see that...

281
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:47,323
Hey! Now hold on a second.
You wanna get arrested?

282
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,565
Now, the man's got a point here.

283
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:53,060
This is a very plain looking truck.
A lot of trucks look just like it.

284
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:56,310
Now maybe you did 
get 'em mixed up.

285
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,001
Hey! 

286
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,224
You stay put.

287
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,188
Mr. Taylor?

288
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:19,370
Come on.

289
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,402
It was him.

290
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:27,535
It was <i>this</i> truck.

291
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:29,039
Uh-huh, I can see that.

292
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,205
Did you get a license plate
number on that truck?

293
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,546
What? No!

294
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,115
How about the information 
on that door panel...

295
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:36,115
you recall any of that?

296
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:39,554
I wasn't paying attention.
Come on, Officer. 

297
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:43,215
Mr. Taylor, did you err...

298
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,526
by any chance have a beef
with your wife today?

299
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:49,896
What has <i>that</i> got to do 
with <i>anything</i>?!

300
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:50,996
Well, for starters, maybe...

301
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,261
is there a possibility 
she could have left you?

302
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,967
I don't... I don't  believe this.

303
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,634
My wife did <i>not</i> leave me!

304
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:01,677
Mr Taylor, I've seen it a
hundred times...

305
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:03,001
you put two people in
a car long enough...

306
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,477
they're gonna go at it.

307
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:06,212
Lovers, married couples, 
gay guys.

308
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:08,182
Hell, I've seen men dump their
women on the side of the road...

309
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:09,582
and vice versa.

310
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:10,640
Officer, err...

311
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:13,624
I'd really like to stay 
and help but, err...

312
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:15,624
I got a long haul to Fresno.

313
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,724
I understand, go ahead,
'preciate your cooperation.

314
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:21,761
This is insane. 
Officer, please.

315
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:24,104
I've got his information, alright.
If I need to find him later...

316
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:26,204
I know where to look.

317
00:25:27,304 --> 00:25:28,504
Sir.

318
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:33,932
Much obliged.

319
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:36,774
And ahh...

320
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:40,938
Look, it's no hard feelings. 
I really do hope you find your wife.

321
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:42,954
Thanks.

322
00:25:48,554 --> 00:25:50,786
Mr. Taylor, you wanna 
come with me.

323
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:22,581
Sir, I  believe you that 
your wife's missing.

324
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:24,001
Alright, now maybe 
you got confused...

325
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,694
about what kind of 
truck she got into...

326
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:26,494
and maybe you didn't.

327
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,494
Point is, I'm trying to help.

328
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:30,896
The town of Brackett's thirty-one
miles back that way.

329
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:33,566
My deputy's name is Len Carver.
He's a good man.

330
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,338
He'll help you fill out all the
necessary forms...

331
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:37,999
if you wanna report 
your wife missing. Right?

332
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:40,438
Sheriff, this is dispatch...

333
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:42,438
Mrs. Gilbert's locked out of 
her trailer again.

334
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:43,967
Can you help her?

335
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,406
Ten Four, dispatch. Tell her
I'm on my way.

336
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:47,403
Will do.

337
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,738
Mr. Taylor, do yourself 
a favour.

338
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:53,385
Go see my deputy.

339
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:23,749
This a recent picture?

340
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,214
It's a... couple months old.

341
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:28,180
She still wear her hair like this?

342
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,925
Yeah.

343
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:37,363
Well... we'll certainly do 
our best, Mr Taylor.

344
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:39,467
You know there's over a hundred
thousand people go missing...

345
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:41,567
in this country, every year.

346
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:43,762
Runaways, deadbeat dads...

347
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:47,073
dropouts. Folks hiding 
from the IRS.

348
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:49,266
All vanishing without a trace.

349
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:51,413
We get these kind of 
pictures all the time...

350
00:27:51,513 --> 00:27:53,513
from all over the place.

351
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:57,183
I'm not saying that your 
wife is one of 'em.

352
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:58,181
I sure hope not.

353
00:27:58,651 --> 00:27:59,951
But... 

354
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:01,333
unless there's been a
ransom demand...

355
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,001
or evidence of forced
abduction...

356
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:05,127
believe me, the FBI won't 
even look at your case...

357
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:08,427
until it's been 
twenty-four hours.

358
00:28:08,427 --> 00:28:12,473
Nevertheless, we will certainly
keep our eyes peeled.

359
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,437
Mr. Taylor.

360
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:24,305
Why don't you go back to Belle's?

361
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,147
Get a cup of coffee.
Wait for your wife.

362
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:31,584
If anything comes up, 
I'll contact you first thing.

363
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:32,548
How's that sound?

364
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:35,545
Yeah.

365
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:00,577
Did my wife come in?

366
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:03,578
Didn't see her.

367
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,999
You didn't see her, or
she didn't come in?

368
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,700
Look, like I told you 
the last time...

369
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,900
maybe she was in, 
maybe she wasn't.

370
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,500
All I'm saying is that
I didn't see her.

371
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,271
It ain't none of my
business, mister, but...

372
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:27,895
I's you... I'd check
the ladies' room.

373
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:43,182
Amy?

374
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:46,893
Amy!

375
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:49,999
I'll be right with you, cowboy.

376
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,571
I wanna see your order slips.

377
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:38,467
What?

378
00:30:38,777 --> 00:30:40,980
You write down the names.
I wanna see 'em.

379
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,174
Are you nuts? I don't have 
to show you jack-shit!

380
00:30:45,784 --> 00:30:50,190
If my wife came in here... then
her name's in that pile.

381
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,382
You calling me a liar?

382
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:55,992
Let me see these fucking slips!

383
00:31:04,092 --> 00:31:06,735
Mister. I had just about
enough of you.

384
00:31:36,835 --> 00:31:37,369
Operator.

385
00:31:37,469 --> 00:31:39,001
Operator... give me 
the Sheriff's office.

386
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,341
One moment, please.

387
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,341
Come on!

388
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:43,999
My name's Billy.

389
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:48,799
You the fella looking for his wife?

390
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:51,088
Yes!

391
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:54,088
Yeah, how'd you know?

392
00:31:54,188 --> 00:31:55,950
Did you see her?

393
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,190
You seen her?

394
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,092
Please, if you know
something, tell me!

395
00:32:00,192 --> 00:32:02,895
Well, I, I, I, seen 
her... maybe.

396
00:32:02,995 --> 00:32:03,962
Where? When?

397
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:07,258
Inside, a little while ago.

398
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,331
She came in on a truck.

399
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:11,270
Right.

400
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,031
- A big semi.
- Then what?

401
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:18,367
Well... then she left, on...

402
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:19,812
on another truck.

403
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:21,243
Another... with who?

404
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,443
Oh... some men.

405
00:32:26,218 --> 00:32:28,787
Oh they think I'm a
dummy, but I ain't.

406
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:31,156
I'm gonna get my trucker's 
license one day.

407
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,181
This is very important...

408
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:35,629
Did you see where 
they took my wife?

409
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:36,629
Uh-huh.

410
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:41,533
Route Seven, North.
Up by the river.

411
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:43,500
By the river? Where?

412
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:51,977
Oh, they don't tell me 
that kind of thing.

413
00:32:52,077 --> 00:32:53,942
Who doesn't? The bartender?

414
00:32:54,746 --> 00:32:55,713
The men in the truck?

415
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:59,318
Oh, I, I ain't talking 
to you no more.

416
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:00,318
Wait a minute...

417
00:33:00,318 --> 00:33:02,357
You need to come with
me to the police.

418
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,557
You tell them what you saw,
they can help me.

419
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:07,081
Well now, you the dummy.

420
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,695
What's that supposed
to mean?

421
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:11,568
Well don't you get it? 

422
00:33:11,668 --> 00:33:14,668
Police is the one's in on it.

423
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:33,278
Come on. Work, godammit it.

424
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,197
Hello? Yeah, Steve? 
This is Jeffrey Taylor...

425
00:33:44,197 --> 00:33:45,197
you remember...

426
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:46,197
right.

427
00:33:46,197 --> 00:33:47,824
Don't put me on hold, please.

428
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,058
Listen, I need a favour.

429
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:53,672
I gotta talk to that friend
of yours at the FBI.

430
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:56,775
Right. Ah, It's about Amy.

431
00:33:56,889 --> 00:33:58,143
Now something's 
happening...

432
00:33:58,243 --> 00:33:59,286
Amy, yeah I think 
she's been...

433
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:01,486
she's missing. 
I think she's...

434
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:03,286
Hello? Fuck!

435
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:07,286
Yeah?

436
00:34:07,386 --> 00:34:10,789
Steve? Yeah. No. 
No don't call me back!

437
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,789
Don't... Steve! Steve!

438
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,951
Shit!

439
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,951
What the...?!

440
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:41,410
- Get out of the car now!
- Oh shit!

441
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,410
Damn, son-of-a-bitch!

442
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,410
Arrgh!

443
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,410
Son-of-a-bitch!

444
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,374
What do you want?

445
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:31,994
He's getting away!

446
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:39,413
What the hell is going on?

447
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:41,324
Got away. Went down the river.

448
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:21,527
Yeah... we're pulling it out now.

449
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:25,001
Careful. Don't let it come loose.

450
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:26,661
I got it.

451
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:31,400
This is what happens when you
get one, without the other.

452
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,143
Stop worrying.

453
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:34,012
How the hell we gonna explain
this to Warren?

454
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,740
I ain't gonna explain it.

455
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:44,500
Hey. You all right?

456
00:39:57,302 --> 00:40:00,001
Now, according to your wife...

457
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,400
you got a good pile of cash sitting
in your bank account at home.

458
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,651
Is that true?

459
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,944
What? Th... there's 
some, yeah.

460
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:08,880
Mmm, well, 'some' just 
don't cut it.

461
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,219
She gave us an exact
dollar amount.

462
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,719
Now, I want that same
figure from you.

463
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:15,001
Wha... what do you...

464
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:18,085
I don't... it's different accounts.

465
00:40:18,723 --> 00:40:20,020
Balance fluctuates, I don't...

466
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:21,351
Fluctuates my ass.

467
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:25,402
If some hotshot fuck like you
ain't watching his bottom line...

468
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:27,402
it'd be the <i>first</i> time in history!

469
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:31,764
What do you think, Earl?

470
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,131
What I think is we been lied to.

471
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:36,303
He ain't no goddamn donut king!

472
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:38,973
The slut was lying to save her ass.

473
00:40:39,111 --> 00:40:40,105
Piece of shit.

474
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,601
- Jesus! No!
- I'm gonna do 'im.

475
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:43,007
Ninety-thousand!

476
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:46,808
Ninety-thousand dollars.

477
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,881
Now you crawl your 
ass outta there.

478
00:41:15,981 --> 00:41:19,384
You're a tough man 
get hold of, Jeffrey.

479
00:41:19,484 --> 00:41:20,280
What do you want?

480
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,350
Huh... it's not what <i>I</i> want, 
it's what <i>you</i> want.

481
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:27,387
How bad do you want it? 
'Cos it is gonna cost ya.

482
00:41:28,493 --> 00:41:29,892
Can't show it to you right now...

483
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:33,198
It's about five-five, a hundred
and fifteen pounds.

484
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:35,266
Three or four of that just pure tit.

485
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:38,759
Nice curly brown hair 
upstairs and down.

486
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:41,436
Interested?

487
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:44,936
Why?

488
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:47,178
What does... why, why us?

489
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:49,192
Huh.

490
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:50,589
Bring him up here.

491
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:02,930
Town of Brackett, Jeff.

492
00:42:03,665 --> 00:42:06,870
Two-bit shit-hole in the 
middle of nowhere.

493
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,905
See that bank down there?

494
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:13,040
Few mintues you're 
gonna walk in...

495
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,600
tell the manager you 
want an express wire...

496
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,406
in the amount of ninety
thousand dollars...

497
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:18,406
from your bank account 
in Boston.

498
00:42:18,407 --> 00:42:20,114
Cash.

499
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:24,681
How do I know she's still alive?

500
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,989
- Arrrgh!
- Shut up!

501
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:32,555
Come on, Jeff.

502
00:42:32,624 --> 00:42:34,091
Need you to pay attention.

503
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:43,035
Now you see that building with the
flagpole coming out the top of it?

504
00:42:43,135 --> 00:42:44,035
Yeah.

505
00:42:44,135 --> 00:42:45,729
That's the sheriff's station.

506
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:47,700
There's exactly two cops
in this town...

507
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,004
one of them's pulling 
desk duty right now...

508
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:51,509
the other one's on patrol
in the foothills.

509
00:42:51,609 --> 00:42:52,999
A minute ago, Billy here...

510
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:55,877
called in an accident on 
the l-40 connector.

511
00:42:57,882 --> 00:42:59,999
See? There he goes.

512
00:43:02,554 --> 00:43:03,800
It's gonna take about 
twenty minutes...

513
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,292
for that cracker to get 
out to the connector...

514
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:07,292
another ten minutes to
see there's no accident...

515
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:08,650
another twenty minutes
to get back in.

516
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,687
That's fifty minutes.

517
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,536
That is exactly the amount
of time you have...

518
00:43:11,636 --> 00:43:13,436
to get me my money.

519
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:20,600
And before you get any
half-baked ideas...

520
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,140
about calling in the Cavalry...

521
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,001
just remember we're gonna
be watching you...

522
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:25,410
every step of the way.

523
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:29,047
And we're gonna be listening
on those scanners.

524
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:30,978
And if we see anything unusual...

525
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:33,009
an unmarked car, a plane,

526
00:43:33,184 --> 00:43:37,022
one human being who 
even smells like a cop...

527
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:40,425
well you can just keep your
fucking money, Jeff.

528
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:43,959
And I'll send you pieces of her 
from time to time.

529
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:47,593
Billy.

530
00:43:49,033 --> 00:43:49,897
Give him the jacket.

531
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:55,999
Well go on. Put it on, Jeff.

532
00:43:56,141 --> 00:43:59,513
Can't go into a bank looking 
like that, now can you?

533
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:02,800
We don't have to do this...

534
00:44:02,825 --> 00:44:06,384
because I can get you that
money. I swear to God.

535
00:44:06,384 --> 00:44:09,909
Promise you'll Just let 
my wife go, please!

536
00:44:10,488 --> 00:44:11,716
Forty-nine minutes, Jeff.

537
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,580
Time to get the show 
on the road.

538
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,884
Here's my... driver's license,
credit card. If you need it.

539
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:14,886
Account number for
my bank in Boston.

540
00:45:14,986 --> 00:45:16,300
How long's this gonna take?

541
00:45:16,488 --> 00:45:20,070
- Erm, eh. Are you, erm... all right?
- Yeah, I am. Fine.

542
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,560
Look I only got five-thousand 
dollars in that account, and erm...

543
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,500
how much can you advance
me on my... my credit card?

544
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,500
Oh... now. Excuse me?

545
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,998
Credit card. It's got six 
thousand loan limit...

546
00:45:27,999 --> 00:45:29,834
can you advance me the
whole six-thousand?

547
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,927
No... I, sorry, I can't.

548
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,975
The, err... limit for 
non-customers...

549
00:45:34,075 --> 00:45:36,976
is five-hundred dollars a day.

550
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:42,047
Sir... are you <i>sure</i> 
you're alright?

551
00:45:43,147 --> 00:45:44,943
Yeah, I'm fine.

552
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,306
Just...  transfer the
money. Ok?

553
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:09,498
I'm gonna tell you something.

554
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:14,408
What I'm about to tell you...

555
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:20,289
you can't call anyone. 
Do you understand?

556
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:22,289
Yes...?

557
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:27,881
Whatever happens, just...
just keep writing on that pad.

558
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,989
Please, now. Just
keep writing.

559
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:36,100
They're probably watching
me right now, they...

560
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:38,736
they've got voice
scanners and...

561
00:46:38,736 --> 00:46:42,275
the whole town's under 
surveillance.

562
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:46,172
If I don't walk out of here...

563
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:48,047
with...

564
00:46:49,147 --> 00:46:51,505
'Scuse me. You the manager?

565
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:52,708
Yes, I am.

566
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:56,087
Lady back there said I should
see you 'bout a car loan.

567
00:46:56,187 --> 00:46:57,313
Certainly, erm...

568
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:01,048
If, err, you would just, err,
take a seat...

569
00:47:13,148 --> 00:47:15,048
Yes?

570
00:47:24,148 --> 00:47:25,586
Just err...

571
00:47:25,686 --> 00:47:27,488
f...f... forget it...
I, I ,I had a...

572
00:47:27,588 --> 00:47:28,588
car accident, you know.

573
00:47:28,688 --> 00:47:30,388
Minor... an acci... just...

574
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:32,512
I'm just, kinda...

575
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,050
How long's this gonna take?

576
00:47:35,793 --> 00:47:37,354
It'll, erm...

577
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:40,408
well it's... going to take
a few minutes.

578
00:47:50,408 --> 00:47:57,780
Yeah, I um, I'm calling regarding 
account number 98258103.

579
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:01,242
A Jeffrey Taylor.

580
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:04,423
Uh-huh.

581
00:48:05,523 --> 00:48:08,347
Well, he'd like to... liquidate 
his account, and err...

582
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:13,347
that's right, the <i>full</i> transfer.

583
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:30,038
Shit!

584
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:40,972
It's me.

585
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,404
No shit. I can see that. 
How much you got?

586
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:52,323
The whole thing.
Ninety-thousand.

587
00:50:52,423 --> 00:50:53,117
That's good.

588
00:50:53,758 --> 00:50:54,700
Now I want you to turn left...

589
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,001
start walking toward 
the main road...

590
00:50:56,002 --> 00:50:57,500
and get in the first
car that stops.

591
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,064
You get that?

592
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:01,461
When do I see my wife?

593
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:05,575
Soon enough, Jeff.
Just start walking.

594
00:52:17,675 --> 00:52:19,999
Just throw the money right
up here on the seat.

595
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,012
No.

596
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,947
First you tell me where she is.

597
00:52:24,181 --> 00:52:25,226
Wrong, asshole...

598
00:52:25,326 --> 00:52:27,352
first you give me the money
and then you find out.

599
00:52:28,452 --> 00:52:30,349
'Less you want me just to 
shoot your ass dead...

600
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:33,142
right here on the side 
of the highway?

601
00:52:51,142 --> 00:52:52,006
Turn around.

602
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:55,373
Do it!

603
00:53:02,486 --> 00:53:03,976
Put your hands behind you.

604
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,001
Step toward the truck.

605
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:21,205
Now get up in the truck. 
On your knees.

606
00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:23,237
Get in here, goddammit!

607
00:53:41,926 --> 00:53:44,531
I gave you the money.
Now let her go.

608
00:53:44,631 --> 00:53:47,531
Ha, ha, ha.

609
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:49,277
- The the hell do I...
- Shut up!

610
00:53:58,377 --> 00:53:59,277
Yup.

611
00:54:00,377 --> 00:54:01,309
Yeah, it's a done deal.

612
00:54:02,379 --> 00:54:03,175
I'm heading in.

613
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:05,823
Yeah, I got you.

614
00:54:12,923 --> 00:54:15,194
You gotta be the dumbest 
motherfucker yet.

615
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:19,262
Think we just picked you 
out of the clear blue?

616
00:54:20,297 --> 00:54:21,355
Shiny new car.

617
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,967
Massachusetts plates.

618
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:26,527
Probably be a week before
anybody even misses you.

619
00:54:27,671 --> 00:54:31,842
Should have got that bumper
sticker that goes with that car:

620
00:54:31,942 --> 00:54:35,137
'Rich Assholes Looking For Trouble'.

621
00:54:49,237 --> 00:54:50,695
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

622
00:54:50,795 --> 00:54:52,232
Sure wish I'd been there.

623
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:53,500
See the look on your face...

624
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,166
when your car seized 
up on you.

625
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:57,534
Maybe next time you'll learn...

626
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,660
don't leave your hood open
when you go in the store.

627
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:20,094
The hell is that?!

628
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,201
These ain't nothing but
goddamn singles!

629
00:55:25,301 --> 00:55:27,201
Lying son-of-a...

630
00:56:14,301 --> 00:56:15,201
Shit!

631
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,201
Hey!

632
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,201
Whaddya doing in there?!

633
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:35,201
Hey!

634
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:38,131
Where is she?!

635
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,237
Fuck you!

636
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,329
No... fuck you!

637
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,878
You like that? 
How 'bout this?

638
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:49,411
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

639
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:51,715
The fuck you don't know.

640
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,582
Stop... stop.

641
00:56:58,656 --> 00:57:00,624
What's that? You want
me to stop?

642
00:57:00,624 --> 00:57:01,648
You really want me to stop?

643
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:04,925
'Cos I'll bet this baby stops
on a fucking dime!

644
00:57:19,209 --> 00:57:20,176
What the hell?!

645
00:57:28,786 --> 00:57:29,445
Where is she?!

646
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,687
She's with Billy.

647
00:57:30,955 --> 00:57:31,444
Where?

648
00:57:31,522 --> 00:57:33,450
I dunno they're driving
around somewhere.

649
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,513
Bullshit!

650
00:57:35,693 --> 00:57:38,662
I'm in pursuit of a 
black, Ford F150 pickup truck.

651
00:57:39,063 --> 00:57:40,394
Contact the State Police.

652
00:57:40,597 --> 00:57:43,001
We're headed northbound.
Highway 31.

653
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,369
I need backup. 
Repeat, backup.

654
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:46,829
Where were you taking
the money?

655
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:48,005
To the truck stop.

656
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:49,500
Where, exactly? Where?!

657
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,410
On the main highway. 
The Texaco.

658
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,410
Son-of-a-bitch!

659
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,001
Officer! Officer, you gotta help
me, my wife's been kidnapped!

660
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,135
- Drop the gun!
- Woah, woah, wait. I... you got it!

661
00:58:03,235 --> 00:58:03,614
Get down!

662
00:58:03,716 --> 00:58:04,900
I know where 
she is. 

663
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,800
She...

664
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,686
Get down on the ground!

665
00:58:06,786 --> 00:58:08,799
- Do it!
- Alright, I'm down.

666
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:09,899
Listen to me.

667
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:10,883
He's in on it.

668
00:58:10,983 --> 00:58:12,918
He's with the trucker.
They kidnapped my wife.

669
00:58:13,018 --> 00:58:15,001
There's four of 'em. Th... they 
all work together.

670
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:16,763
They got her right now 
at a truck stop, at Texaco.

671
00:58:16,863 --> 00:58:17,763
Face down!

672
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:18,727
Shut up!

673
00:58:20,332 --> 00:58:21,592
You in the pickup, 
you alright?

674
00:58:21,592 --> 00:58:23,400
(Oh... please... you have 
to believe me...)

675
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,700
(why else would I be out
here in the middle of...)

676
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,828
Yes, sir, I'm okay.

677
00:58:25,928 --> 00:58:27,500
Can you get out?

678
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,742
Yes I can, Sir. Please
don't shoot me.

679
00:58:29,842 --> 00:58:30,850
There's a bag with
money in there...

680
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,100
and I swear to God it's
right in there...

681
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,515
Face down, spread-eagle
and shut up!

682
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:38,479
Get out, damn it!

683
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:40,719
Godammit, listen to
what I'm telling you!

684
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:42,150
Shut the <i>fuck</i> up!

685
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,499
Arrgh!

686
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,759
Hey, shit-for-brains.

687
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:57,023
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...

688
00:59:18,123 --> 00:59:19,393
Shots fired.

689
00:59:21,493 --> 00:59:22,460
Officer down.

690
00:59:28,367 --> 00:59:29,493
Suspect identified.

691
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:35,544
Sheriff? This is State 
Police dispatch.

692
00:59:35,644 --> 00:59:36,644
What is your twenty?

693
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:40,646
Get an ambulance,
he's been shot.

694
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:42,440
Who is this?

695
00:59:42,748 --> 00:59:43,610
Sheriff, can you respond?

696
00:59:43,649 --> 00:59:45,479
They're coming.

697
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:52,494
Sheriff, hang on. We're 
bringing you an ambulance.

698
00:59:55,594 --> 00:59:57,600
All units! All units!
Officer down!

699
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,011
Repeat, Officer down!

700
00:59:59,111 --> 01:00:01,011
I repeat...

701
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:07,011
Sheriff?

702
01:01:19,111 --> 01:01:20,600
Look, I don't know dammit, he 
was supposed to be here...

703
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,800
a half an hour ago.

704
01:01:22,948 --> 01:01:24,450
And I heard a report on 
the police band...

705
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:25,785
about a cop down.

706
01:01:26,785 --> 01:01:29,056
I'm leaving. I can't... there's too
much heat around here.

707
01:01:29,156 --> 01:01:30,956
So, stay off the airwaves...

708
01:01:31,056 --> 01:01:33,034
get his wife and meet
me at the barn.

709
01:01:33,134 --> 01:01:36,234
I don't <i>care</i> if you have
to drive all night!

710
01:05:36,134 --> 01:05:37,158
Daddy, you're home!

711
01:05:37,336 --> 01:05:40,360
- Hey... Deke! Miss me?
- Yeah.

712
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,762
Deke, get back to bed.

713
01:05:42,207 --> 01:05:44,241
Warren, I thought you were
coming back next week.

714
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:46,945
Yeah, well I finished early.
And now I'm home.

715
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,414
Al and Billy are coming over
in a little while too.

716
01:05:49,514 --> 01:05:52,451
But it's six in the morning. Can't
they come some other time?

717
01:05:52,551 --> 01:05:53,999
Look, we got some 
stuff to do, Ok?

718
01:05:53,999 --> 01:05:55,850
It's gonna take a
couple a hours.

719
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,823
Why don't you go in 
and make breakfast?

720
01:05:57,923 --> 01:05:58,617
Hey, Deke!

721
01:05:58,717 --> 01:05:59,725
Yeah?

722
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:00,985
Wanna open the barn 
for your Dad?

723
01:06:01,085 --> 01:06:02,126
Ok.

724
01:06:34,226 --> 01:06:36,895
He-he-hey, Dekey.
Hey, thanks.

725
01:06:36,995 --> 01:06:38,600
Hey, I got something for you.

726
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,799
Ready? Mmm?

727
01:06:40,899 --> 01:06:41,999
Here you go, Son.

728
01:06:42,334 --> 01:06:43,959
Look at that.

729
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:45,769
- Cool!
- Cool.

730
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:48,840
Ha, ha. A real Swiss 
Army knife.

731
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:49,999
Good boy.

732
01:07:32,984 --> 01:07:33,609
Deke?

733
01:07:35,487 --> 01:07:36,613
Deke, you back there?

734
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:35,240
If I never see another 
couple from Massachusetts...

735
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,808
it'll be too soon.

736
01:09:36,908 --> 01:09:39,001
- Yeah.
- Ok, ok, we gotta a lota work to do.

737
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,645
First off, you got any 
word on Earl?

738
01:09:40,745 --> 01:09:41,473
Not a thing.

739
01:09:41,813 --> 01:09:42,438
Me neither.

740
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:43,100
Fuck!

741
01:09:43,948 --> 01:09:45,497
Ok, we gotta get this
stuff off the truck.

742
01:09:45,497 --> 01:09:46,697
Now, anything...

743
01:09:46,697 --> 01:09:49,697
that can trace us back to 
that fuck, we get rid of.

744
01:09:49,697 --> 01:09:51,797
Anything, Billy. You got that?

745
01:09:58,897 --> 01:09:59,800
You know, none of this
would've happened...

746
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,001
if you'd gotten that jerk...

747
01:10:01,001 --> 01:10:02,358
the same time as his wife.

748
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:05,100
Wouldn't get in the
fucking truck.

749
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,600
I suppose you'd just 
pick up a gun...

750
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,107
chase him out into
the desert?

751
01:10:08,207 --> 01:10:09,007
Fucking idiot!

752
01:10:09,107 --> 01:10:10,165
Look, I'm just saying...

753
01:10:10,475 --> 01:10:11,450
you should have gotten 
rid of 'em...

754
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:12,778
just like that couple in Ohio.

755
01:10:12,878 --> 01:10:13,600
Nice 'n clean.

756
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,683
So we stay out of the area 
for a couple of months.

757
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,500
Big deal!

758
01:10:18,783 --> 01:10:21,119
- Al!
- Yeah?

759
01:10:21,219 --> 01:10:21,947
Come on.

760
01:10:27,393 --> 01:10:29,985
Alright, honey. Time to get up.

761
01:10:31,463 --> 01:10:34,897
- Let's go! Come on, come on!
- Come on, move it!

762
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:35,661
Get up!

763
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:38,865
Dead?

764
01:10:40,638 --> 01:10:43,266
Must have died from the 
exhaust, or... suicide! 

765
01:10:44,342 --> 01:10:47,109
Couldn't be any cleaner 
than that now, could ya?

766
01:10:48,012 --> 01:10:50,660
Get that plastic man, we'll bury
her out back before sun-up.

767
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,200
Alright, come on, let's go.

768
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,400
- Got it?
- Yeah.

769
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,001
- Jesus! 
- Goddamn!

770
01:11:04,662 --> 01:11:05,999
Scared me to <i>death!</i>

771
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,400
Let me do her, Red.
I'll cut her head off, right now.

772
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,803
Warren, you in there?

773
01:11:11,803 --> 01:11:13,700
Shh, it's my wife. Come on.

774
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,628
Cover her up, quick.
Put her in the freezer.

775
01:11:15,728 --> 01:11:16,628
Warren?

776
01:11:16,728 --> 01:11:18,728
- Warren!
- Be right there, Arleen.

777
01:11:35,728 --> 01:11:38,252
Hey... she's a feisty one, ain't she?

778
01:11:41,352 --> 01:11:43,844
That's right, lady!
You just keep it up.

779
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,579
Alright, don't give
me any trouble.

780
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:57,582
Godammit! Cut your 
fucking squirming!

781
01:11:57,682 --> 01:12:00,385
Aww, come on, baby. It's not
as bad as it sounds.

782
01:12:00,485 --> 01:12:02,852
Take take you about ten minutes 
to suck all that air out.

783
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:04,063
Probably won't even feel it!

784
01:12:04,163 --> 01:12:05,063
Ha, ha, ha.

785
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:14,104
Come on, fellas.
Come on.

786
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:16,104
Breakfast's burning, dude.

787
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:21,051
- Let's go eat!
- Glad to.

788
01:12:32,151 --> 01:12:34,083
- Well.
- Hey, Mrs. C.

789
01:12:34,118 --> 01:12:36,754
Finally. Are you coming
to breakfast?

790
01:12:36,754 --> 01:12:37,584
I've been calling you.

791
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:39,586
Yeah, we sure could use
some of them pancakes.

792
01:13:12,686 --> 01:13:15,100
Hey Billy... now come 
in the house!

793
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:08,244
So what happens?

794
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:11,001
This rooster. Must've
been huge.

795
01:15:11,001 --> 01:15:12,850
They must've weighed
about ten pounds.

796
01:15:13,344 --> 01:15:16,922
He starts reaching out...
to the highway patrolman.

797
01:15:17,022 --> 01:15:17,922
Yeah.

798
01:15:18,022 --> 01:15:20,022
Reaches way out
from the...

799
01:15:24,022 --> 01:15:24,852
Give me the key.

800
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:27,814
Mister...

801
01:15:27,925 --> 01:15:30,328
Don't 'mister' me you
son-of-a-bitch!

802
01:15:30,428 --> 01:15:33,454
My wife is locked up in a hole
in your fucking barn!

803
01:15:33,865 --> 01:15:35,669
And if you don't give
me the key...

804
01:15:35,769 --> 01:15:37,869
I'm gonna blow your
<i>fucking head off!</i>

805
01:15:37,869 --> 01:15:38,793
Warren, what's going on?

806
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,072
I don't know, Honey. 
Just stay calm.

807
01:15:41,072 --> 01:15:43,400
Your husband's a murderer and a
kidnapper, what's going on.

808
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,643
Now give me the fucking key!

809
01:15:45,743 --> 01:15:46,573
Freeze, Mister.

810
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,390
You don't wanna do that, kid.

811
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,290
Put the gun down.

812
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,390
Don't listen to him, Deke.

813
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:02,394
You just keep that gun
right on him.

814
01:16:03,494 --> 01:16:06,164
My daddy keeps his rifle 
loaded all the time.

815
01:16:06,264 --> 01:16:09,100
He showed me in case I need to
protect Mommy when he's away.

816
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,868
I understand that and I'm
not going to hurt your mom.

817
01:16:10,968 --> 01:16:11,866
He's lying, Deke.

818
01:16:13,504 --> 01:16:14,471
Now, go on, Son.

819
01:16:16,374 --> 01:16:17,773
Squeeze that trigger, go on.

820
01:16:19,077 --> 01:16:20,237
Don't listen to him, kid.

821
01:16:20,511 --> 01:16:21,307
Go on, Deke.

822
01:16:21,446 --> 01:16:23,181
Don't listen to him.
He's wrong.

823
01:16:23,281 --> 01:16:25,017
Do what I tell you to do.
Squeeze that trigger now.

824
01:16:25,117 --> 01:16:26,117
Come on!

825
01:16:26,117 --> 01:16:29,189
Put it down, Deke. 
Nothing's gonna happen.

826
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:31,721
Do it!

827
01:16:33,821 --> 01:16:35,061
Arrgh! Goddamn!

828
01:16:37,161 --> 01:16:38,128
<i>Don't</i> move.

829
01:16:41,332 --> 01:16:42,230
Nobody move!

830
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:45,002
Get down here, kid.

831
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,241
- Get over here... get by your mom.
- Come here, Honey.

832
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:50,141
It's alright.

833
01:16:50,241 --> 01:16:51,038
Get over there.

834
01:16:51,138 --> 01:16:53,212
Get over there!

835
01:16:54,312 --> 01:16:54,937
Shit!

836
01:16:58,037 --> 01:17:00,085
Alright.

837
01:17:01,185 --> 01:17:02,821
Everybody stick together 
and get out that door!

838
01:17:02,999 --> 01:17:04,445
Right now! Move it!

839
01:17:04,545 --> 01:17:06,691
- Go! Get outta here! Move it!
- Come on, Honey. Let's go.

840
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:10,023
Turn around! <i>Turn a-round!</i>

841
01:17:15,233 --> 01:17:15,790
Open it!

842
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:32,400
Get down there, 
open that freezer up.

843
01:17:33,818 --> 01:17:35,649
Warren... what is this?

844
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:38,544
Just pull the chain, Arleen.

845
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:45,185
Open it!

846
01:17:51,669 --> 01:17:54,433
You'd better pray... she's alive.

847
01:17:58,533 --> 01:18:00,012
Ohh!

848
01:18:01,112 --> 01:18:01,703
Amy.

849
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:03,999
Jeff.

850
01:18:06,951 --> 01:18:09,387
You made it, baby.
Come on.

851
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:10,454
Get away from me!

852
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:14,265
Come on, honey.
Come on up.

853
01:18:14,365 --> 01:18:15,265
Come on, honey.

854
01:18:17,365 --> 01:18:18,265
It's alright.

855
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:23,968
Alright, you son-of-a-bitch.
Get down there!

856
01:18:24,068 --> 01:18:25,092
All of you. Get down there!

857
01:18:27,192 --> 01:18:28,011
It's ok.

858
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,600
Ok, it's alright.

859
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:35,681
You <i>better</i> remember 
this, fella...

860
01:18:35,781 --> 01:18:37,907
- 'Cos no matter where you go...
- You... <i>FUCK!!</i>

861
01:18:38,007 --> 01:18:39,427
Uggh!

862
01:18:47,527 --> 01:18:48,427
Jeff!

863
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:51,256
It's alright. It's alright.

864
01:18:51,796 --> 01:18:54,000
Now listen to me. 
Amy, listen to me.

865
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,000
Honey, listen to me.

866
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,999
There's one more still 
out there, you understand?

867
01:18:59,937 --> 01:19:02,419
Now we have to get 
out of here, fast!

868
01:19:15,519 --> 01:19:16,076
Shit!

869
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:30,603
Can you make it to that
pickup truck?

870
01:19:31,703 --> 01:19:32,603
Ok.

871
01:19:32,703 --> 01:19:33,603
Come on.

872
01:19:55,703 --> 01:19:58,703
Ok. Ok, come on.

873
01:19:58,803 --> 01:20:00,418
- Help!
- Billy!

874
01:20:00,418 --> 01:20:01,418
Billy?!

875
01:20:01,999 --> 01:20:02,850
Hang on!

876
01:20:10,518 --> 01:20:13,218
- We gotta find those keys.
- Ok.

877
01:20:19,318 --> 01:20:22,081
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Taylor. 
This is an emergency.

878
01:20:22,181 --> 01:20:23,954
Listen to me, I need
the police.

879
01:20:23,954 --> 01:20:26,891
Someone's trying to kill me and
my wife. Do you understand?

880
01:20:26,991 --> 01:20:29,483
I don't know the address.
We're on a farm.

881
01:20:30,394 --> 01:20:32,825
Just... start tracing 
this call, right now!

882
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:35,720
Got 'em!

883
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,614
- Jeff!
- Get away!

884
01:20:49,999 --> 01:20:50,339
Come on.

885
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:52,752
Come on!

886
01:20:54,852 --> 01:20:55,716
Give me the keys!

887
01:21:03,816 --> 01:21:04,999
Jeff!

888
01:21:08,099 --> 01:21:08,690
Come on!

889
01:21:10,835 --> 01:21:11,426
Go!!

890
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:31,611
Do you see him?

891
01:21:31,956 --> 01:21:33,581
- Do you see him?!
- No!

892
01:21:46,003 --> 01:21:47,950
- Are you alright?
- Yes!

893
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:51,050

- Damn!

894
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:00,999
Want some? Come on!

895
01:22:04,946 --> 01:22:05,414
Damn!

896
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:26,414
Shit!

897
01:22:28,001 --> 01:22:29,200
I can't... oh...

898
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,946
- Watch out!

899
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,201
Fuck!

900
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,201
Crazy bastard!

901
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:50,201
Fucker... you're gonna die!

902
01:22:58,301 --> 01:22:59,201
Oh God!

903
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:14,201

904
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:24,926
Shit!

Stop!

911
01:24:09,403 --> 01:24:10,403
Don't. Jeff!

912
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,943
- No, I can't get out!
- Gotta get outta here!

913
01:24:19,043 --> 01:24:20,100
I can't get out!

914
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:20,800
Oh!

915
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,943
Oh, I can't get out!

916
01:24:46,043 --> 01:24:47,943
Arrgh, my leg!

Don't move.

01:26:54,211 --> 01:26:54,768
Don't move.

01:27:07,001 --> 01:27:08,189
Gonna get you out now.

01:27:10,461 --> 01:27:13,234
Come here. Come on.
Come on. Alright.

We're gonna do this.
