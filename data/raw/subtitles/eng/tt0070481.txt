1
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,767
Bring the rope.

2
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:15,804
Get on your feet, keyes.

3
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:21,776
You gotta give him one thing, sergeant.
He's a gambler.

4
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:27,080
No gamble when you got nothing to lose.
Put it on him.

5
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:29,549
Come on, gambler.

6
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:33,553
If I can't trust you on a horse,
you're gonna have to walk.

7
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:36,622
Start getting used to that
rope around your neck.

8
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:06,611
Get that rope off of him.
Put him back on his horse.

9
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:16,953
Corporal! Let 'em rest!

10
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:19,889
Down. Sit down. Rest.

11
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:27,762
Sergeant Raines, sir.

12
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:30,965
Lieutenant cummins of
Stewart's troop, fort dorado.

13
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:35,569
- Where you headed, sergeant?
- We're escorting a prisoner to general crook's command.

14
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,810
<i>Your prisoner looks a little
worse for wear, sergeant.</i>

15
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:48,614
- What happened to you, soldier?
- I fell off my horse.

16
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:53,618
He tried to make a break for it three times, sir.
I can sure use another man.

17
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,486
Well, I'm sorry, sergeant.
I can't spare one.

18
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:59,394
We're still two days from dorado. You
can reach the general by tomorrow.

19
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,255
Yes, sir. Good luck.

20
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,490
Move him out, schrader.

21
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:18,269
<i>About face!</i>

22
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,605
<i>Left face!</i>

23
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,840
<i>Order, arms!</i>

24
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:31,780
Platoon, dismissed!

25
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,600
Lieutenant cummins reporting, sir,
with 19 hostiles. Cheyenne, sir.

26
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,627
This far South,
in apache country?

27
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,862
I ran onto them
just north of Santa Fe.

28
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,965
Their braves must be dead
or on a reservation, I guess.

29
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:56,767
You guess?

30
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:00,871
Well, lieutenant, that's just
what we needed for Christmas.

31
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:03,506
Some of the men are gonna
have to miss the holidays,

32
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:07,009
taking this crew to
the Cheyenne-arapaho agency.

33
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:08,777
You'll be in charge
of the detail.

34
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,613
<i>That's all.</i> Yes, sir.

35
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,520
Have the doctor examine them.

36
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,623
He can set up a quarantine
tent outside if it's needed.

37
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,658
And let the rest sleep in
the old barracks. Yes, sir.

38
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,495
Corporal, move them out
over the barracks!

39
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,663
Right this way.

40
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:36,799
You people, move over this way.

41
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:44,640
Right this way.
All right, spread 'em out.

42
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:47,876
Spread 'em out. Sit 'em down here
on the porch. All along here.

43
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:51,045
<i>Sit down. Sit.</i>

44
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:54,815
<i>Mail call! Mail call!</i>

45
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:57,951
Mail call!

46
00:05:57,953 --> 00:06:00,653
Hey, terrific! Let's go!

47
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:08,560
All right, now.

48
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:12,463
<i>I'm gonna look at you one at a time.
Nothing to be afraid of.</i>

49
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,832
<i>You understand?</i>

50
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,900
<i>Any of you sick, we're
gonna try to help you.</i>

51
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,837
<i>Will you stand up here, please?</i>

52
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,506
Go get him.

53
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:28,776
Open your shirt, please.

54
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:31,811
Will you open your shirt.

55
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:34,513
<i>Oh, not like that. What's
the matter with you?</i>

56
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,486
Smith, w.G. Here.

57
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,889
<i>Hicks. Carter.</i>
<i>Right here. Here.</i>

58
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:46,924
<i>Phillips. Here.</i>

59
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:49,092
<i>Springer. Yo.</i>

60
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:51,060
<i>Miller. Here.</i>

61
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,862
<i>Carlisle. Yo.</i>

62
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:56,865
<i>O'brien. Murphy. Hey.</i>

63
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,867
<i>Yo. Johnson.</i>

64
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:01,536
Here.

65
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,504
<i>Here's one for you, Wheeler.</i>

66
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,572
<i>Simpson. Yo.</i>

67
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:08,808
<i>Anderson. Anderson.</i>

68
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,911
<i>He's on duty.</i>

69
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:39,803
Hey, come back here! Here, doc.

70
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:42,505
<i>Hey, what's going on? Hey,
boy, give me that horse.</i>

71
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:57,819
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

72
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:03,557
Give me your hand. Never mind me.
Get the kid.

73
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:09,461
- Come back here, fella.
- You men,

74
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:11,529
<i>get after those mules.</i>

75
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:13,764
Come back here.

76
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:18,702
Give me a hand here, Murphy.
Come here, you.

77
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,814
Hey, kid, come here. Look out.

78
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:42,589
Stop him, chaplain.

79
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:46,792
<i>Son, come on back.</i>

80
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,793
<i>He's a real wildcat, he is.</i>

81
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:55,832
He's white, sir.
I'm not blind, sergeant.

82
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,968
Come on. Get down from there.

83
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,704
The guardhouse is empty, isn't it?
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

84
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,973
- Then lock him up.
- You can't just sentence him to the guardhouse.

85
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,709
I am not sentencing him, John.

86
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:09,477
But I gotta put him someplace
while I figure out...

87
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,712
<i>What to do with him.</i>

88
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:13,947
I suppose there's no chance
of finding his parents.

89
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:16,516
None at all, John.

90
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:18,985
He's probably one of those captured by the
Cheyenne after the sand creek massacre.

91
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:21,654
<i>Indians raised him</i>
<i>as a member of the tribe.</i>

92
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:26,057
What I mean, sir, is
I-I'd like to take him.

93
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:32,763
<i>He'll have to be kept</i>
<i>under lock and key.</i>

94
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:36,532
I want him out of the way when we send
those others to the reservation next week.

95
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,067
Yes, sir, I understand.
<i>All right.</i>

96
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:42,036
I'll hold both of you
responsible.

97
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:44,605
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

98
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:47,640
Well, come on, son.

99
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:51,844
Come on, you.

100
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:09,928
You're being given a name.
Do you understand?

101
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,737
Dearly beloved, none can
enter the kingdom of God,

102
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,041
except he be regenerate and born
anew of water and the holy ghost.

103
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:28,910
Who speaks for this child?

104
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:33,314
Sergeant.

105
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,316
Uh, I do.

106
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:42,621
Dost thou in the name of the
child renounce the devil...

107
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:44,689
<i>And all his works?</i>

108
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,624
I do.

109
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:52,329
- The child's name?
- Mark.

110
00:10:57,835 --> 00:11:00,835
I baptize thee... Mark...

111
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:05,739
In the name of the trinity.

112
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,775
From this day forward,
you'll be known as mark...

113
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,776
To all men.

114
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:17,948
¶ Kindly light amid
the encircling gloom ¶

115
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,851

¶ for me ¶

123
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:51,188
¶ amen ¶

124
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,749
you men can put out
your candles now.

125
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:11,826
<i>During the offertory,</i>
<i>we'll sing "silent night."</i>

126
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:20,999
¶ Silent night ¶

127
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:25,770
¶ holy night ¶

128
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:29,940

¶ Christ the savior is born ¶

146
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:27,875
you look for Cheyenne?

147
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:57,369
He can't have gone far. You check over there.
I'll look on this side.

148
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:59,437
Did you see the boy come out?
No, sarge.

149
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:41,463
Ho.

150
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:48,435
Hyah! Let's go.

151
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,074
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

152
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,259
Boy.

153
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:26,635
Let me see that arm.

154
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:29,771
Ah, that's not too bad.

155
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:31,706
Come on. We'll put
something on it.

156
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:36,176
All right, now sit down there.

157
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:38,444
I'll get you some water.

158
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:46,584
<i>Oh, shut up, you rotten,</i>
<i>no good piece of...</i>

159
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:51,454
here. Drink some of this.

160
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:56,692
Don't overdo it. Slowly.

161
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,132
Got some carbolic in here.

162
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:08,868
I can promise you, it's gonna
hurt you more than it will me.

163
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,704
Give me that arm.

164
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:23,580
That ought to keep it
from festerin', anyway.

165
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:31,888
<i>That military disaster</i>
<i>over there,</i>

166
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,557
<i>we call rosebud.</i>

167
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:37,893
You can call her Rosie,
if you've a mind to.

168
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:46,465
Shut up.

169
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:58,909
Give me that gun.

170
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,814
I said give me that gun before
I break it over your backside.

171
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:21,863
All right, I shot you.

172
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:23,764
Now we're even.

173
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:28,802
Next time you use a Winchester,

174
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:33,573
you just make sure there's a
cartridge in the chamber, huh?

175
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,779
What's your name?

176
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:43,549
I'm not gonna ask you again.

177
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:48,486
Mark.

178
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:50,955
Mark? Mark what?

179
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:53,824
Just mark.

180
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,593
I'm Clint keyes.

181
00:20:57,661 --> 00:21:00,501
What are you doing out here all by your lonesome?
Where are your folks?

182
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,570
Can't leave you
out here by yourself.

183
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,472
<i>I'll take you</i>
<i>as far as those mountains.</i>

184
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,740
Then I'm heading South,
to Mexico.

185
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:16,708
You understand that, boy?

186
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,715
<i>That's the thirstiest critter I ever saw.
He don't even know he's a camel.</i>

187
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,253
Thirsty?

188
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:33,621
Appears to me
he answered to that.

189
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:35,856
I been looking for a handle for him.
Come here, thirsty.

190
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:38,959
<i>Come here. Come on.</i>

191
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:42,562
Ah, camels don't cotton
to me too much.

192
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:44,564
<i>Why don't you call him.
</i> Here, thirsty.

193
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:50,769
Come here, thirsty.

194
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:55,873
Seems like he knows
who he is when you say it.

195
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:04,514
All right. Down. Come on.

196
00:22:04,516 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>Coosh, coosh, coosh.</i>

197
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:10,619
Coosh. Down. Coosh. Coosh.

198
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,795
Most miserable animal
I ever saw.

199
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:22,863
What I need is a good horse.

200
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:28,468
Come on over here and get up.

201
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:36,575
There you go.

202
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:39,678
Okay. Clamp a jaw on that, huh?

203
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,780
Up, Rosie. Up.

204
00:22:41,782 --> 00:22:43,882
Up, up.

205
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:16,613
Two camels. Keyes here.

206
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,519
Small boy here also.

207
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:29,589
A small boy?

208
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,724
Girl, maybe.

209
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:51,009
Thirsty.
If thirsty can't keep up,

210
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:53,811
<i>she'll have to go it alone.
</i> Thirsty!

211
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,655
Now, who told you
to do that? Huh?

212
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:09,457
One more time, and you're
gonna be camel stew.

213
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:11,859
You're not lovable
and you're not ridable.

214
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:14,628
Maybe you're eatable.
<i>Come on, thirsty.</i>

215
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,796
Come on.

216
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:27,505
<i>We'll go a little slower. First
decent place we find, we'll stop.</i>

217
00:24:29,775 --> 00:24:31,608
Come on. Bring it along.

218
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:48,591
Okay, Rosie. Let's do
it right for a change.

219
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:52,594
Rosie, you rotten
animal. Rosebud!

220
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:56,764
All right, that does it.
Mark, go get me a stick.

221
00:24:56,766 --> 00:25:00,467
Shut up.

222
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:02,635
I'm gonna teach
this big bag of trouble...

223
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:06,472
It can be more painful sitting
down than standing up and walking.

224
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,506
Up, Rosie. Up.

225
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,582
Come on.

226
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,885
- What are you laughing at?
- You look like big Cheyenne chief.

227
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,427
Well, you're gonna look like a
wet papoose 'cause you're next.

228
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:02,990
All right, now, come here.
Come on.

229
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:07,694
You don't catch me. Can't catch me.
Come on. It ain't gonna hurt you.

230
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:09,696
Come here!

231
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,334
All right, all right.
You win. Forget it.

232
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:17,869
<i>You wanna stay that way,</i>
<i>you stay that way.</i>

233
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:21,105
Whoo! Whew!

234
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:23,907
Bring me my boots,
my britches, there.

235
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,088
No!

236
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,992
Whew! You haven't had those buckskins
off since they sewed 'em on you.

237
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
Stop!

238
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,897
You ain't any more Cheyenne
than I am.

239
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:54,166
Well, that white skin ain't gonna
get you out of taking a bath.

240
00:26:54,168 --> 00:26:57,669
I'm tired of walking
downwind of you.

241
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,709
No! No! Stop!

242
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,181
- All right, give me those britches.
- No. No.

243
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,050
You give me those britches or
I'm coming in there to get 'em.

244
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,889
Give 'em here.

245
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:32,098
Now, here, use that. It's soap.

246
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,967
<i>Go on and use it. Nobody
ever died from it.</i>

247
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:37,368
<i>Go on. Rub. It won't hurt.</i>

248
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,639
<i>You see? Doesn't hurt</i>
<i>a bit, does it?</i>

249
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:52,647
You don't know your name or
who your folks were, huh?

250
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:54,782
Where did you learn
to speak English?

251
00:27:54,884 --> 00:27:57,818
We had other white eyes.

252
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,653
Other captives?

253
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:04,391
You long knife now?

254
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:07,994
I was a soldier.

255
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:14,166
Now you'd call me
a... deserter.

256
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:18,369
They were gonna hang me until
I busted out of the guardhouse.

257
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:25,074
<i>I couldn't figure out a way to
get a horse out of that fort.</i>

258
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:28,377
Had what was left
of the camel corp outside,

259
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:32,447
so I grabbed that
moth-eaten bag of misery,

260
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:36,884
not knowing she was the mother of
your friend thirsty over there.

261
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:38,852
You take me to blue feather?

262
00:28:39,955 --> 00:28:42,922
Who's that? <i>My</i> mother.

263
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:45,024
Oh, I see.

264
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:48,393
You take me?

265
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:52,463
Well, I can't do that, son.

266
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:55,465
You see I'm headed
for Mexico, in a hurry.

267
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,468
I go then.

268
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:04,372
Wait a minute.
You're not going anywhere.

269
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:07,007
Not with that patrol
on my tail, you're not.

270
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:12,945
Look, mark, by now they know
you're traveling with me.

271
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:15,180
You know where I am
and where I'm headed.

272
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:18,049
If they grab you,
they'll sweat it out of you.

273
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:21,418
I don't talk.

274
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,454
Well, I don't take chances.

275
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:30,426
I'll turn you loose when I think
it's safe and not before.

276
00:29:30,428 --> 00:29:34,096
In the meantime, mark,

277
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:36,831
we gotta trust each other.

278
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:41,868
You understand?

279
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:10,194
Boy with keyes. Water two camels.
Last night.

280
00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:12,396
No fresh sign?

281
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:16,399
See if you can pick up
their trail.

282
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,440
Hold it.

283
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,476
Now turn around and face
the water, all of you.

284
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:39,384
Drop your weapons behind you.

285
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,394
This ain't gonna make it
any easier for you, keyes.

286
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:53,130
Nobody ever made it easy
for me, Raines.

287
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:00,936
All right, now,
after those horses.

288
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:04,572
Both of you first. And, Raines,
you stay right in front of me.

289
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:06,507
Move.

290
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,067
Schrader, get rid
of the horses!

291
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:49,948
<i>All right, move, move, move!</i>

292
00:31:55,954 --> 00:31:58,387
That's far enough.

293
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:01,556
<i>All right, schrader,</i>
<i>where's your gun?</i>

294
00:32:08,464 --> 00:32:11,465
Well, sergeant,
you better get moving.

295
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:14,468
With no horse, it's
gonna be a long, dry walk.

296
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:22,075
Yeah, I know. Now, get moving.

297
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:43,962
We do good, huh, Clint?

298
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:46,965
Oh, sure. Sure.

299
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:50,568
No horses, no grub.
We really cleaned up.

300
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,938
<i>They'll be back.</i>
<i>You can count on it.</i>

301
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,575
Come on.
See if we can fool 'em.

302
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,444
We'll hide out in these
mountains for a couple of days.

303
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:04,646
Right now, though, we
better find us some grub.

304
00:33:17,393 --> 00:33:20,560
That's cattle. I
hear long time ago.

305
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:24,063
Thanks for telling me.

306
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:36,074
- Ow!
- What's the matter, Clint?

307
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:39,544
You talk to camels.
Tell her to get off my foot.

308
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:43,112
Move, Rosie.

309
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:46,581
You...

310
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:59,993
<i>that's beef</i>
<i>for fort dorado, likely.</i>

311
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:03,429
<i>Bacon. I smell.</i>

312
00:34:04,598 --> 00:34:07,465
You'd like
a little of that, huh?

313
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:10,434
Clint, we got nothing to eat.

314
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:13,103
Cheyenne quiet. I steal.

315
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:18,474
You've got to get over the idea that anytime
you want anything, you can just go steal it.

316
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:21,009
We'll wait till
they quiet down.

317
00:34:23,113 --> 00:34:25,646
Then I'll steal the bacon.

318
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,759
Something wrong, boss? They're
kinda spooky tonight.

319
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,745
I'm gonna get me some water.

320
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:01,747
I'm kinda thirsty myself.

321
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:31,775
Drink. Much obliged.

322
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:34,611
Yeah, they look
kinda antsy, at that.

323
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:37,046
Well, it's funny.
No wind, no sand.

324
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,181
Nothing to make 'em spook.

325
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:44,785
We better keep an eye on 'em.

326
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,644
Rosie! What are you doing here?

327
00:36:14,746 --> 00:36:16,745
Come on, Rosie.

328
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,818
Coosh. Coosh down.
Rosie, get down.

329
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,787
Get up. Get up. They're spookin'.
Get your horses quick.

330
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:28,822
Get up over there. Let's go.

331
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:31,457
Get down.

332
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:36,661
Pull 'em in, tom. Pull 'em in.

333
00:36:36,663 --> 00:36:40,731
<i>- Come on. Get 'em in.</i>
- Oh, you dumb... Rosie. Easy.

334
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,467
What was that? I don't know.

335
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,304
Let's go, Rosie.
Let's go. Ho! Ho!

336
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:50,774
<i>Let's go, Rosie. Go. No, Rosie.</i>

337
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,846
Rosie, Rosie.

338
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:09,557
Rosie. Aw, Rosie, stop.

339
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,765
Rosie!

340
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:22,534
Whoa. Whoa!

341
00:37:25,472 --> 00:37:28,806
Rosie, now you've gone far enough.
No, Rosie. No.

342
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:52,728
Whoa! Whoa!

343
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:20,519
Ow! Ow!

344
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:24,689
How many more?

345
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,893
I know about those.
How many more?

346
00:38:29,895 --> 00:38:31,828
Not many, Clint.

347
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:39,768
What are you doing, Rosie? Get out of here.
Go on. Git. Git, Rosie.

348
00:38:39,836 --> 00:38:42,303
Ow!

349
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:44,672
She's sorry, Clint.

350
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:49,009
<i>Yeah, she's sorry.</i>

351
00:38:49,011 --> 00:38:51,878
<i>Before getting mixed up with her, I
should've stayed in the guardhouse...</i>

352
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,947
<i>And let 'em hang me,</i>
<i>peaceful-like.</i>

353
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:56,848
That's all, Clint.

354
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:05,989
Carbolic. Like you said,

355
00:39:05,991 --> 00:39:08,624
it's gonna hurt you
more than me.

356
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:13,995
Aah!

357
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:21,769
Won't fester.

358
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:30,844
Whoa, Rosie. Whoa.

359
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:33,580
I gotta get down, kid.

360
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:36,049
Take this. Here.

361
00:39:46,728 --> 00:39:49,795
I've sat on campfires
that were more comfortable.

362
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,533
<i>Come on, Rosie.</i>

363
00:40:21,692 --> 00:40:23,658
Whoa.

364
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,830
Well, this looks like
as good a place as any.

365
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:39,605
<i>¶</i> What's that?

366
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,580
<i>¶</i>

367
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:52,983
<i>¶ All in a wood</i>
<i>there grew a tree ¶</i>

368
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:56,486
¶ the finest tree
you ever did see ¶

369
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:59,689
¶ and the green leaves
grew around and around ¶

370
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,792
¶ and the green leaves
grew around ¶

371
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,829
- let's do it again, mama.
- Uh, all right.

372
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,598
One more chorus, and then we
have to finish our packing.

373
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,536
¶ And on this tree
there grew a limb ¶

374
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:18,640
¶ the finest limb
you ever did see ¶

375
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:22,644
¶ the limb was on the tree ¶

376
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,580
<i>¶ the tree was in the wood ¶</i>

377
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,982
they don't have camels in
new Mexico, do they, mama?

378
00:41:27,984 --> 00:41:30,784
No, dear, they don't.

379
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:33,787
<i>¶ And the green leaves grew around and
around ¶</i> something's eating at our corn.

380
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:38,558
¶ And the green leaves
grew around ¶

381
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:43,529
Judas priest, it<i> is</i> a camel.

382
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:46,565
But you said that... <i>I know what I said.
Get back inside.</i>

383
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:48,967
<i>Oh, it's only</i>
<i>a little camel, mama.</i>

384
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:52,737
Well, let's hope it's big enough
to know what a shotgun is.

385
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:56,807
Git. Come on. Get out of my corn.
I said git!

386
00:41:56,909 --> 00:42:00,110
Get out of here! Git! Git!

387
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:03,646
Don't go in the barn! Git!

388
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:08,717
Nothing to be afraid of, ma'am.

389
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,019
Who are you?

390
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:12,987
Howdy.

391
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:17,758
- What do you want?
- Well, we'd just like something to, uh...

392
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,595
<i>well, to eat,</i>
<i>if you've got it, ma'am.</i>

393
00:42:21,597 --> 00:42:25,131
We-we'll be leaving here in a few days.
You can take everything then.

394
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:28,000
Oh, well, we'll be gone
long before that.

395
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:32,137
Uh, are... is there
anyone else here?

396
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:35,573
No. Just me and my little girl.

397
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:38,576
We sold everything,
even the stock.

398
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,514
You can take anything you want.
Just leave us alone, please.

399
00:42:43,516 --> 00:42:46,850
Well, there's no need to worry, ma'am.
We're camped nearby. Here.

400
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:49,586
No, we won't make any trouble.
Come on, mark.

401
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:56,559
Is he yours?

402
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:59,561
I never knew anyone
who had a camel before.

403
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:13,541
They're here!

404
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,984
These are fresh this morning.
Well, thank you.

405
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:27,753
My name is Clint keyes,
and this is mark.

406
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:30,989
Oh, I'm Doris mciver.
This is my daughter Martha.

407
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:34,325
- Are you with the army, Mr. Keyes?
- Well, not just now.

408
00:43:34,327 --> 00:43:36,060
<i>No, ma'am.</i> Where's the camel?

409
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:38,861
- We left it back at camp.
- I don't understand.

410
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:41,864
I didn't know they had camels
in the middle of new Mexico.

411
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:45,767
Well, Jeff Davis brought 'em over when he was
secretary of war, for the desert troops.

412
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:48,936
- But yours is just a baby.
- We have the mother camel too.

413
00:43:49,038 --> 00:43:52,806
A big camel?
Mama, can I see it, please?

414
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:55,741
- Mark would love to show it to her.
- Oh, well, I don't know.

415
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:58,343
<i>It's all right. Mark loves</i>
<i>to show 'em off. Go on.</i>

416
00:44:02,615 --> 00:44:05,649
<i>You said you were leaving. Maybe
there's something I can do to help.</i>

417
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:07,784
Oh, no, thank you.

418
00:44:07,886 --> 00:44:10,887
They're sending a wagon out from
town for us tomorrow morning.

419
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:13,789
We'll take the stagecoach
from there.

420
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:17,659
We're going back to Colorado.
Mountain creek.

421
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:20,828
We came out here
for my husband's health.

422
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,731
But it was no use.
It was too late.

423
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:26,799
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, ma'am.

424
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:29,001
Look, if you'll take these,
I'll cut some wood.

425
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:31,069
Oh, well, thank you.

426
00:44:32,138 --> 00:44:34,338
Ah... oh, Mr. Keyes.

427
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,773
I notice you're limping.
Are you hurt?

428
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:39,876
Oh, I just had
a little accident.

429
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:43,646
Well, I've had some nursing.
Would you like me to look at it?

430
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:47,383
No, ma'am. Oh, it'll
be fine. Just fine.

431
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:59,327
Do you ride it? Sure.

432
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:02,663
Could I...
could I ride it, please?

433
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:07,667
Could I ride the little one?

434
00:45:07,669 --> 00:45:09,635
Why not?

435
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:16,874
- You're a girl.
- Well, she's the mother. She's a girl too.

436
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,647
All right. You ride.

437
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:35,024
Coosh, Rosie. Coosh.

438
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:38,694
Coosh down. Coosh. Coosh.

439
00:45:38,696 --> 00:45:40,429
Coosh.

440
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:52,806
Coosh. Ready? Yeah.

441
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:54,874
Up, Rosie. Up.

442
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:01,780
Come on, Rosie.

443
00:46:07,353 --> 00:46:09,720
Take this requisition
to fort dorado.

444
00:46:09,722 --> 00:46:12,389
They'll give you cash for
your saddles and side arms...

445
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:14,991
And replace them horses
we're taking there.

446
00:46:14,993 --> 00:46:19,862
Fine. Ah, this man
you're after...

447
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:22,297
if it ain't a government
secret, what'd he do?

448
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:24,932
Mutiny. Deserted up in Wyoming.

449
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:27,868
We caught up with him, took him
to general crook's headquarters.

450
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:31,071
Busted out of the guardhouse there and
attacked a noncommissioned officer.

451
00:46:31,073 --> 00:46:36,008
Oh. And you say he
was headed for Mexico?

452
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,810
Heading South, figures.

453
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:40,811
Well, may be.

454
00:46:40,913 --> 00:46:45,015
But if it was me on the run,
I'd stay off that open desert.

455
00:46:45,017 --> 00:46:49,085
Hole up in these mountains
around here for a while.

456
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,757
You just may be right. Thanks.

457
00:46:55,759 --> 00:46:57,458
Good luck, sergeant.

458
00:47:05,434 --> 00:47:07,400
Oh, thank you.

459
00:47:07,402 --> 00:47:09,402
Oh, say, there's
more than enough fish...

460
00:47:09,404 --> 00:47:11,804
If you and the boy'd
care to stay for supper.

461
00:47:11,806 --> 00:47:14,072
Well, no, than... I don't think we ought to.
That's very kind of you.

462
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,506
You mean you don't like fish?

463
00:47:16,808 --> 00:47:19,809
Well, no, ma'am, it's not that.
It's just that...

464
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:22,945
Mark and I aren't exactly
dressed, I haven't shaved...

465
00:47:22,947 --> 00:47:25,347
oh, well, there's plenty of
time if you wanna shave.

466
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:29,350
Well, the truth is,
I just lost my razor.

467
00:47:29,418 --> 00:47:32,051
Well, you're welcome to use
my husband's, if you like.

468
00:47:32,053 --> 00:47:34,386
Oh, well, you're already packed. I
wouldn't wanna cause you any trouble.

469
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:36,321
Oh, no trouble.

470
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,127
Why don't you and mark
sleep in the barn?

471
00:47:43,129 --> 00:47:45,028
You'll be more
comfortable there.

472
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,463
I'm obliged again, ma'am.

473
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:55,170
<i>Come on, mark.</i>

474
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:05,913
He depends on you a lot,
doesn't he?

475
00:48:05,915 --> 00:48:08,081
Oh, I guess.

476
00:48:08,183 --> 00:48:12,451
But mostly he's just trying to
use me to get to blue feather.

477
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:16,054
Are you going to take him?

478
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:21,625
I can't. I'm headed for Mexico.

479
00:48:21,627 --> 00:48:25,962
Oh, I didn't know that.
With the boy?

480
00:48:25,964 --> 00:48:28,063
No, ma'am.

481
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:33,201
What are you gonna do with him?

482
00:48:35,638 --> 00:48:39,439
- That's my problem, I guess.
- You just can't leave him.

483
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,674
Well, I know that.

484
00:48:41,676 --> 00:48:44,543
But he doesn't belong
in Mexico...

485
00:48:44,645 --> 00:48:48,579
Any more than he belongs
in a tepee on a reservation.

486
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:54,618
What he needs is a home...

487
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,453
And a family.

488
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:08,429
It's a mite hard to tell whether
a camel loves you or hates you.

489
00:49:08,497 --> 00:49:12,465
- Either way they're ornery as sin.
- I love 'em.

490
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:14,433
I guess you gotta
give them credit, though.

491
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:17,435
The heat doesn't bother 'em.
Neither does the cold.

492
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,204
<i>The, uh, biggest ones</i>
<i>can travel...</i>

493
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:24,208
<i>Fifteen, sixteen Miles an hour,
carrying a ton of weight.</i>

494
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,410
<i>They can outlast any horse.</i>

495
00:49:26,412 --> 00:49:30,080
Well, you certainly know
a lot about camels, Mr. Keyes.

496
00:49:30,082 --> 00:49:32,649
- Well, just hearsay.
<i>- Oh.</i>

497
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:34,583
Where... where are you going?

498
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:37,118
Camels.

499
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,486
First you say excuse me,

500
00:49:39,488 --> 00:49:41,988
and then you say thank
you to Mrs. Mciver.

501
00:49:48,996 --> 00:49:50,428
Go on. Say it.

502
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,134
Uh, Martha...

503
00:49:58,136 --> 00:50:01,570
I just wanna talk to mark. I think
you better go to bed now, dear.

504
00:50:01,672 --> 00:50:04,639
- But it's early.
- Martha, we're leaving tomorrow.

505
00:50:04,641 --> 00:50:07,541
Now, it's gonna be
a very long, hard day.

506
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:27,726
I can't figure out
what's eating mark.

507
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:31,095
Oh, he just feels out of place.
And a little jealous, I think.

508
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:35,165
<i>I don't mean to pry,</i>

509
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:38,535
but is there some reason you can't
take him to Mexico with you?

510
00:50:38,637 --> 00:50:41,570
Yeah, there sure is.

511
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,040
Uh, Doris, I'm on the run.

512
00:50:49,244 --> 00:50:53,079
- You mean somebody's after you?
- An army patrol.

513
00:50:56,217 --> 00:50:58,217
Well.

514
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,724
What I did, I'm...

515
00:51:05,726 --> 00:51:09,093
Not exactly proud of, but I'm
not ashamed of it either.

516
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:15,031
Well, I'm sure what you did
you thought was right.

517
00:51:18,536 --> 00:51:22,203
Well, I guess
I better put these away.

518
00:51:24,106 --> 00:51:26,172
Let me help you.

519
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:35,781
I don't know exactly how to say this,
but, uh, you've been honest with me.

520
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:40,452
I'd like to explain to you about mark.
What about him?

521
00:51:40,454 --> 00:51:43,154
Well, let's not pretend.
You've been hinting all day,

522
00:51:43,156 --> 00:51:45,422
trying to get me to say
I'd take the boy.

523
00:51:47,225 --> 00:51:49,825
Well, you're right. I have.

524
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:53,662
You say what he needs
is a home and a family.

525
00:51:53,764 --> 00:51:56,798
A family. Not half a family.

526
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,768
<i>I'd be less than human if my
heart didn't go out to the boy.</i>

527
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:04,238
But I can't listen to my heart. It's
gonna be hard enough for Martha and me.

528
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,640
I'll teach a little piano
and do a little nursing.

529
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:13,012
But a mother and daughter
can always get along.

530
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:15,480
Why, oh, you figure I'm just
trying to get shut of the boy.

531
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,784
Right now that's true.
If I had a choice...

532
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:23,821
- but you don't have a choice.
- I know that.

533
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:26,657
I can't keep him either.

534
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:28,558
<i>I know that too.</i>

535
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,563
Could I dry the dishes
for you or something?

536
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:39,133
No. I... I'll just let 'em soak.

537
00:52:39,135 --> 00:52:41,568
I think you better go out
and see how he is.

538
00:53:06,627 --> 00:53:08,627
Clint.

539
00:53:10,831 --> 00:53:13,631
I'll tell you what I<i> will</i> do. I'll
take mark up north with me tomorrow.

540
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:17,568
<i>I'll do my level best</i>
<i>to find him a good family.</i>

541
00:53:17,636 --> 00:53:22,704
- That's the most I can promise.
- Well, nobody could ask for more than that.

542
00:53:22,706 --> 00:53:24,572
I wanna thank you.

543
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,711
Well, I've got
a busy day tomorrow.

544
00:53:30,713 --> 00:53:32,479
Doris.

545
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:39,818
Doris, uh...

546
00:53:42,255 --> 00:53:46,790
<i>Doris, I forgot</i>
<i>to give this back to you.</i>

547
00:53:46,892 --> 00:53:49,692
Oh. Why don't you just keep it?

548
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:52,628
Oh, well, I can make
good use of it. Thank you.

549
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,696
I must say,
it's made quite an improvement.

550
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,631
Hmm? <i>You.</i>

551
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,232
Without the beard.

552
00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:06,438
Good night, Doris.

553
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:46,643
Clint? Yeah?

554
00:54:48,947 --> 00:54:52,615
I do wrong, huh, Clint?

555
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:56,685
Well, they're
good people, mark.

556
00:54:56,687 --> 00:55:01,456
You eat their food, a little
thank you's not too much to ask.

557
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,594
It's one of those things
you'll have to learn.

558
00:55:12,567 --> 00:55:14,567
But you not mad at me now?

559
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,903
No.

560
00:55:18,005 --> 00:55:19,971
No. We're friends, aren't we?

561
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:24,575
You good friend, Clint.
I not forget.

562
00:55:49,034 --> 00:55:51,434
Mark.

563
00:55:51,436 --> 00:55:53,269
I have something to tell you.

564
00:55:53,504 --> 00:55:55,537
- You're going to come with us.
- Shh.

565
00:56:02,845 --> 00:56:04,978
Mark!

566
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:16,455
Clint would've taken you,
if he could.

567
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:19,491
But he thought it was better if you
stayed with us for a little while.

568
00:56:29,702 --> 00:56:33,036
You'll love Colorado. We're
gonna ride on the stagecoach.

569
00:56:33,038 --> 00:56:35,872
<i>Mark, let me talk to you.</i>

570
00:56:35,874 --> 00:56:38,975
Please, mark, listen.

571
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:42,444
<i>Martha and I both</i>
<i>want you to go with us.</i>

572
00:56:42,512 --> 00:56:45,713
You can stay with us
as long as you like.

573
00:56:45,715 --> 00:56:47,548
Mark.

574
00:56:48,517 --> 00:56:50,950
Wait.

575
00:56:51,052 --> 00:56:53,752
Please.

576
00:56:53,754 --> 00:56:56,454
Please.

577
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:03,692
Cheyenne don't cry.

578
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:21,475
Mark.

579
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,915
Where's Clint keyes?

580
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:32,017
Keyes?

581
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:38,456
Schrader, search the house.
Dixon, you take the barn.

582
00:57:48,901 --> 00:57:51,534
I said, where's keyes?

583
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:58,006
I'm gonna find out, ma'am.
That's my job.

584
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:03,545
- Anything?
- Uh-uh.

585
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:14,688
- Give me the boy.
- He's done nothing wrong.

586
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,157
If you won't tell me
about keyes, he'll have to.

587
00:58:17,626 --> 00:58:21,661
Leave him alone.
Mr. Keyes isn't here.

588
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:23,963
<i>He left last night.</i>
Which way did he go?

589
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:26,932
I don't know.
I didn't see him leave.

590
00:58:27,034 --> 00:58:29,567
You might as well tell me
the rest of it.

591
00:58:30,903 --> 00:58:34,704
Um, well, he talked
about north, I think.

592
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:38,941
Try South.

593
00:58:50,887 --> 00:58:52,820
<i>Jimmy wolf!</i>

594
00:58:54,023 --> 00:58:57,691
<i>Any signs?</i> Camel tracks.
This way.

595
00:58:57,759 --> 00:59:01,627
<i>Get after him. Much obliged
for your help, ma'am.</i>

596
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,799
Giddap! Come on!

597
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:19,041
<i>Mark!</i>

598
00:59:19,043 --> 00:59:22,944
<i>Martha! Martha!</i>

599
00:59:22,946 --> 00:59:27,014
Martha, it's time to go!

600
00:59:29,952 --> 00:59:32,886
<i>Mama, I can't find mark</i>
<i>anywhere.</i>

601
00:59:32,888 --> 00:59:36,322
I know, but you've been looking
and calling for a long time now,

602
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:38,724
and we really have to go now.
<i>That's right, ma'am.</i>

603
00:59:38,726 --> 00:59:41,126
We better hustle. You're
gonna miss your stage.

604
00:59:41,128 --> 00:59:43,862
We just can't leave mark, mama.

605
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:46,064
I don't want to leave him any
more than you do, Martha,

606
00:59:46,066 --> 00:59:49,567
but he must be Miles away
from here by now.

607
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:52,803
He's not. He's still here.
I know he is.

608
00:59:52,805 --> 00:59:56,640
Martha, he'll find Mr. Keyes.
I'm sure he will.

609
00:59:56,642 --> 00:59:58,642
Now, come on.

610
00:59:58,644 --> 01:00:00,577
Now, up we go.

611
01:00:07,852 --> 01:00:12,921
- <i> Giddap!</i>
- Mark! Mark!

612
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:17,792
Good-bye, mark!

613
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:20,060
Bye!

614
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:24,364
<i>Bye, mark!</i>

615
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,599
<i>Bye!</i>

616
01:00:34,908 --> 01:00:39,944
<i>Rosie, ho! Ho!</i>

617
01:00:39,946 --> 01:00:42,379
Rosie, you wanna be the only
hopeless camel in the world,

618
01:00:42,647 --> 01:00:44,380
you just keep that up.

619
01:00:44,648 --> 01:00:49,116
Coosh! Coosh! Coosh! Coosh!

620
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:55,822
Steady now. Easy, girl. Ho.

621
01:00:55,824 --> 01:00:58,624
Ho, girl.

622
01:00:58,626 --> 01:01:01,360
Up, Rosie. Up.

623
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,748
Hyah! Hup! Hup! Hyah!

624
01:01:28,421 --> 01:01:30,421
Ho.

625
01:01:30,423 --> 01:01:34,425
Well, Rosie,
it's the end of the line.

626
01:01:46,137 --> 01:01:48,670
Whoa, Rosie.

627
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,708
All right, Rosie,
hightail it out of here.

628
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,678
Rosie, it's what you've
always wanted. Now, go.

629
01:02:02,718 --> 01:02:05,018
Rosie, don't go gettin'
sentimental on me now.

630
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:08,888
I haven't got that much time.
Now get outta here. Go on.

631
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:11,390
<i>All right, Rosie!</i>
<i>Hyah, hyah, hyah!</i>

632
01:02:41,888 --> 01:02:43,854
Camel. This way.

633
01:02:45,791 --> 01:02:47,871
Looks like we're driving him
down towards the desert.

634
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:28,797
Come, thirsty. This way.

635
01:03:57,859 --> 01:03:59,558
Carbolic?

636
01:04:14,374 --> 01:04:16,006
Sure bet you didn't expect
him to trap himself...

637
01:04:16,108 --> 01:04:18,374
In no box canyon, huh, sarge?

638
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:22,444
Shut up, Dixon. You just be ready
when he flushes him out of there.

639
01:04:24,047 --> 01:04:27,448
What'd you see from the rim?
He's not there.

640
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:30,484
What do you mean, he's not there?
Where is he?

641
01:04:30,486 --> 01:04:33,185
We follow empty camel.

642
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:40,024
Follow empty camel.

643
01:04:40,026 --> 01:04:42,593
Dixon, go get that camel.

644
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:46,997
<i>We're headin' back.</i> What do we
need that old camel for, sarge?

645
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:49,899
Because we haven't got
but four horses.

646
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:52,835
Or would you rather
ride double with keyes?

647
01:04:52,837 --> 01:04:55,404
Move!

648
01:04:55,406 --> 01:04:58,373
Tell schrader he can
quit lookin' for keyes.

649
01:05:14,924 --> 01:05:16,857
Help! Ohh!

650
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,462
<i>Rope him, you dumb John!</i>
<i>Come back!</i>

651
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:25,164
<i>Hold on, Dixon!</i>

652
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,866
Whoa! Whoa!
Help us, schrader! Stop!

653
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:36,605
Whoa! Stop! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

654
01:05:36,607 --> 01:05:39,574
Ohh!

655
01:05:46,882 --> 01:05:49,949
I wish I'd have let you
rode double with keyes.

656
01:06:36,462 --> 01:06:38,628
All I was tryin' to do
was find you a family.

657
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:43,565
<i>That's nothing</i>
<i>to get sore about.</i>

658
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:46,568
I only promised to take you as
far as the mountains, remember?

659
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,703
You left me.

660
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:51,439
Sure, I left you.

661
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:54,208
I left you with Mrs. Mciver
so you could live regular,

662
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,611
<i>maybe go to school and make
somethin' out of yourself.</i>

663
01:07:02,384 --> 01:07:04,550
I'll fix you somethin' to eat.
<i>Not hungry.</i>

664
01:07:18,498 --> 01:07:20,464
Why didn't you
go with 'em, mark?

665
01:07:20,566 --> 01:07:24,601
I go to blue feather.
You take me now?

666
01:07:24,603 --> 01:07:26,636
Now, you know I can't do that,

667
01:07:26,638 --> 01:07:28,738
not with that patrol
still on my tail.

668
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,740
I'd lose too many Miles.

669
01:07:30,742 --> 01:07:33,209
I got good idea, Clint.

670
01:07:33,477 --> 01:07:36,744
Yeah? What kind of idea?

671
01:07:37,046 --> 01:07:40,580
You take me to Cheyenne. They hide you.
They my friends.

672
01:07:40,582 --> 01:07:44,116
The Cheyenne hide me?

673
01:07:44,118 --> 01:07:48,487
Kid, neither one of us could get within
spittin' distance of that reservation.

674
01:07:48,489 --> 01:07:50,755
Set one foot inside that fort,

675
01:07:50,757 --> 01:07:54,692
and they'd grab you just like
they did at fort dorado.

676
01:07:54,694 --> 01:07:57,361
To them, you're...

677
01:07:57,363 --> 01:08:00,063
you're just a white captive
kidnapped by Indians,

678
01:08:00,065 --> 01:08:02,625
and to the Indians, you're nothin'
but trouble, and they know it.

679
01:08:04,569 --> 01:08:07,636
<i>Now, mark,</i>

680
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:09,771
uh, blue feather...

681
01:08:12,108 --> 01:08:16,443
blue feather won't take you
back because she can't.

682
01:08:16,545 --> 01:08:18,545
<i>You gotta understand that.</i>

683
01:08:26,588 --> 01:08:29,088
Son, I...

684
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:32,357
I'm sorry.

685
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:35,426
I'm sorry. I know it's tough.

686
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,595
It's not like
you're gonna be alone.

687
01:08:38,597 --> 01:08:40,763
You'll be with me.

688
01:08:40,765 --> 01:08:43,599
I'm not gonna leave you here.

689
01:08:43,601 --> 01:08:48,470
I know I left you at the farm,
but I explained about that.

690
01:08:51,107 --> 01:08:53,440
We always got along.

691
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:55,475
We're partners, ain't we?

692
01:08:57,078 --> 01:09:00,045
'Spose we can go on down
to Mexico together.

693
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,647
We can make it down there.

694
01:09:02,649 --> 01:09:04,782
No.

695
01:09:04,784 --> 01:09:07,050
You don't want me.

696
01:09:07,052 --> 01:09:09,118
I go to Cheyenne.

697
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,187
Now, wait a minute, kid.

698
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:15,590
I'm tired of arguing with you.

699
01:09:15,592 --> 01:09:17,825
All right,
you want your Indians?

700
01:09:20,062 --> 01:09:22,062
I'll show you how to get there,

701
01:09:22,164 --> 01:09:25,064
and I hope you like
what you get.

702
01:09:25,066 --> 01:09:27,099
Here's our Mountain right here.

703
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:29,601
You go on the other side of it.

704
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:33,171
When you get over there,
you go north three, four days...

705
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:36,474
Till you hit the Canadian river, and
it's gonna be high this time of year.

706
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:38,843
When you hit it, you turn east,

707
01:09:38,845 --> 01:09:41,745
maybe seven, eight days.

708
01:09:41,747 --> 01:09:43,680
And right here
is your reservation,

709
01:09:43,748 --> 01:09:45,748
<i>long knives and all.</i>

710
01:09:47,818 --> 01:09:50,618
<i>We got you surrounded, keyes!</i>

711
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:50,644
Rosie.

712
01:11:02,023 --> 01:11:04,289
Hold it, keyes!

713
01:11:19,772 --> 01:11:22,005
All right, corporal.

714
01:11:23,274 --> 01:11:27,042
This time... I give the party.

715
01:11:51,566 --> 01:11:54,500
<i>¶</i>

716
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,303
<i>Troopers, fall in!</i>

717
01:12:02,608 --> 01:12:05,308
<i>Dress right! Dress!</i>

718
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:07,677
<i>Ready, front!</i>

719
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,913
<i>Parade... dress!</i>

720
01:12:13,817 --> 01:12:17,051
Whoa! Ten-hut!

721
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:25,592
Take 'em out, sergeant.
Forward!

722
01:12:38,606 --> 01:12:40,572
Welcome back, sir.
How'd the maneuvers go?

723
01:12:40,574 --> 01:12:45,109
Lieutenant, what is that thing
doing on my parade ground?

724
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:49,780
It's a gallows, sir.

725
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,882
What I want to know,
lieutenant,

726
01:12:51,884 --> 01:12:55,952
is why is it there and who
authorized its construction.

727
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:58,721
A patrol under sergeant...

728
01:12:58,723 --> 01:13:01,924
Raines brought in a prisoner. He
has orders from general crook...

729
01:13:02,026 --> 01:13:05,694
well, lieutenant, you bring that
sergeant and his patrol to my office.

730
01:13:05,696 --> 01:13:08,530
Yes, sir. And on the
double, lieutenant!

731
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:18,972
What are you, sergeant, some
sort of traveling hangman?

732
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:23,742
No, sir. My orders are to capture
the prisoner and execute him,

733
01:13:23,744 --> 01:13:27,746
signed by general crook, sir.

734
01:13:27,748 --> 01:13:32,616
Your orders also refer to the usual
courtesies extended a commanding officer.

735
01:13:34,086 --> 01:13:36,786
I didn't know when
you'd be back, sir.

736
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:38,854
Nobody here could tell me.

737
01:13:38,856 --> 01:13:41,523
You simply took over
my command.

738
01:13:41,525 --> 01:13:44,993
No, sir. I was just
following my orders.

739
01:13:54,003 --> 01:13:56,570
Where is the prisoner?

740
01:13:56,572 --> 01:13:58,638
- I can get him for you, sir.
- <i> Sergeant!</i>

741
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,107
When I need your help,
I'll tell you.

742
01:14:03,844 --> 01:14:05,844
I asked you where he is.

743
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:08,579
He's in the guardhouse, sir.

744
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:12,782
Have the prisoner
brought in here.

745
01:14:16,921 --> 01:14:19,554
You're corporal Clinton keyes?

746
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:21,656
Yes, sir.

747
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:25,559
You took part in McKenzie's raid
on dull knife's village? Yes, sir.

748
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:29,128
You were convicted of
mutiny and desertion.

749
01:14:31,732 --> 01:14:34,566
That's all it says here.
I'd like to know what happened.

750
01:14:36,636 --> 01:14:38,902
There were 173 lodges
in dull knife's village.

751
01:14:39,004 --> 01:14:41,571
We destroyed them all.

752
01:14:41,673 --> 01:14:43,572
Man next to me started
shooting the women,

753
01:14:43,674 --> 01:14:45,740
so I hit him with my rifle.

754
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:49,477
<i>When you say a man,</i>
<i>you mean another trooper?</i>

755
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:51,778
<i>Yes, sir. Then what did you do?</i>

756
01:14:54,682 --> 01:14:57,849
I tried to help the braves
with their families.

757
01:14:57,851 --> 01:15:00,585
Against your officers
and your fellow troopers?

758
01:15:00,587 --> 01:15:03,788
If you mean did I
shoot at them, no, sir.

759
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:07,625
- But you did mutiny.
- <i> That's what they called it.</i>

760
01:15:16,102 --> 01:15:20,871
Corporal, you seem to feel that each man
has a right to consult his conscience...

761
01:15:20,873 --> 01:15:22,939
And decide which orders
he will obey...

762
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:25,508
And which he will disobey.

763
01:15:26,744 --> 01:15:28,710
Take him out.

764
01:15:38,922 --> 01:15:41,856
Sergeant, I want this execution
finished as quickly as possible.

765
01:15:41,858 --> 01:15:43,891
There will be no formalities.

766
01:15:43,893 --> 01:15:46,860
No members of my command will
participate in any way whatsoever.

767
01:15:46,862 --> 01:15:49,829
You are solely responsible,
sergeant. You understand?

768
01:15:49,831 --> 01:15:52,832
- Sir, my orders state that...
- Dismissed, sergeant.

769
01:16:35,774 --> 01:16:38,674
I'm, uh, glad you asked for me,

770
01:16:38,742 --> 01:16:41,876
but I wanted you to know that
I'd have come in any event.

771
01:16:41,878 --> 01:16:43,878
Uh, now, is there anything...

772
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:48,115
I know all that, reverend.
Uh, reverend,

773
01:16:48,117 --> 01:16:50,951
do you remember a boy
that was brought here...

774
01:16:50,953 --> 01:16:52,919
With some Cheyenne
by the name of mark?

775
01:16:52,921 --> 01:16:56,555
Mark? Yes, I do.

776
01:16:56,557 --> 01:16:58,590
Is he all right? Where is he?

777
01:16:58,692 --> 01:17:00,692
Well, that's what I don't know.

778
01:17:00,694 --> 01:17:02,627
By now he should be
halfway across the desert,

779
01:17:02,629 --> 01:17:04,695
if he's still heading
towards the reservation.

780
01:17:04,697 --> 01:17:06,763
- Looking for blue feather.
- Yeah.

781
01:17:06,765 --> 01:17:09,632
How do you know about the boy?

782
01:17:09,634 --> 01:17:11,767
Oh, I ran onto him
north of here.

783
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:15,603
We were sort of partners for a
while till we had a little set-to.

784
01:17:18,641 --> 01:17:23,076
<i>I guess I sort of forgot which one was
the man and which one was the boy.</i>

785
01:17:23,078 --> 01:17:25,111
Chaplain, what I
want to ask is a favor.

786
01:17:25,113 --> 01:17:27,713
Anything, if I can.

787
01:17:27,715 --> 01:17:30,849
Well, if the boy makes it
to the reservation,

788
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:32,884
the army will grab him
for sure.

789
01:17:32,886 --> 01:17:35,720
They'll need a home for him.

790
01:17:35,722 --> 01:17:38,989
I ran onto this widow woman up in
the mountains where we stopped.

791
01:17:38,991 --> 01:17:42,092
She had a little daughter.

792
01:17:42,094 --> 01:17:46,795
They were headed toward Colorado.
Place called Mountain creek.

793
01:17:46,797 --> 01:17:49,831
Her name is Doris mciver.

794
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:05,345
Now?

795
01:18:06,781 --> 01:18:10,315
Just a minute.
Uh, one minute, please.

796
01:18:14,954 --> 01:18:17,988
I want you to know that I'll do
everything I can to find that boy.

797
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,756
Thank you.

798
01:18:19,758 --> 01:18:23,126
You...

799
01:18:23,128 --> 01:18:27,630
would you, uh, like me
to go up there with you?

800
01:18:31,702 --> 01:18:34,102
It's funny.

801
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:39,339
I memorized whole books of words
to say at a time like this.

802
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:45,344
I just can't remember
any of them.

803
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:50,314
I've had to live with this
for a long time, chaplain.

804
01:18:50,382 --> 01:18:52,782
I won't need any words.

805
01:20:37,519 --> 01:20:41,120
<i>Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!</i>

806
01:20:54,868 --> 01:20:56,467
Hold on!

807
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:08,077
<i>Look out! Run on the porch!</i>

808
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:10,145
Get out of the way!

809
01:21:20,957 --> 01:21:23,490
Get keyes!

810
01:21:28,429 --> 01:21:30,862
- Clint!
- Here, mark!

811
01:21:41,974 --> 01:21:45,508
- Let's go, mark!
- <i> Hey, you! Come here!</i>

812
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:48,477
Go, Rosie!

813
01:21:55,018 --> 01:21:57,551
Let's get after him!

814
01:21:57,553 --> 01:22:01,354
Gotcha! You're not gettin'
away this time! Come on!

815
01:22:38,592 --> 01:22:41,326
G'yup there! G'yup!

816
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:44,395
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Hyah!

817
01:22:49,968 --> 01:22:52,335
Come on! Come on! Hyah!

818
01:22:52,337 --> 01:22:55,538
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

819
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:59,008
Come on, Rosie! Hyah! Hyah!
Move! Let's go!

820
01:23:03,647 --> 01:23:06,047
Ho.

821
01:23:06,049 --> 01:23:07,982
Sergeant, that camel's
faster than the horses.

822
01:23:08,084 --> 01:23:10,584
Never gonna catch 'em this way.

823
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:18,991
Gimme that Springfield!
On the double!

824
01:23:30,237 --> 01:23:32,203
Missed.

825
01:23:32,205 --> 01:23:34,605
Let's get back to the fort.

826
01:23:34,607 --> 01:23:37,007
Rose, come on, now.

827
01:23:37,009 --> 01:23:41,077
You can outrun 'em. Come on,
don't quit on me now, Rosie.

828
01:23:48,519 --> 01:23:51,186
Come on, Rosie. Don't quit...

829
01:23:58,128 --> 01:24:00,194
All right, Rosie. Easy.

830
01:24:02,164 --> 01:24:05,231
Okay, okay, girl.

831
01:24:05,233 --> 01:24:08,467
Okay. I ain't going anyplace.

832
01:24:11,138 --> 01:24:13,471
It's all right, girl.

833
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:18,809
I know he's in the guardhouse, John.
I ordered him put there.

834
01:24:18,811 --> 01:24:21,144
If you think you're taking him back
to the chapel, you can forget it.

835
01:24:21,212 --> 01:24:23,579
No. Only temporarily, sir.

836
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:26,615
Now, I have an idea...
John, you...

837
01:24:29,252 --> 01:24:31,452
excuse me, captain.
It's urgent.

838
01:24:31,454 --> 01:24:33,454
I need fresh horses and more men.
Sergeant...

839
01:24:33,556 --> 01:24:35,556
he outrun us, sir,
but he can't keep runnin'.

840
01:24:35,558 --> 01:24:38,125
When he stops to rest, why, we'll jump him.
There'll be no more horses.

841
01:24:38,227 --> 01:24:40,760
No more men.
Your manhunt is over.

842
01:24:43,498 --> 01:24:46,198
Sir, you read
general crook's orders.

843
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:49,668
General crook's orders call for
the hanging of corporal keyes.

844
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:51,703
A noose was placed
around his neck,

845
01:24:51,705 --> 01:24:54,806
the trap was sprung,
the man was hung.

846
01:24:54,808 --> 01:24:57,508
<i>It is my personal view, sergeant,
that corporal keyes...</i>

847
01:24:57,610 --> 01:25:01,078
Has more than paid for his
misdeeds, such as they were.

848
01:25:01,146 --> 01:25:04,480
I have no intention of hanging a
man twice for the same crime.

849
01:25:04,482 --> 01:25:06,482
<i>Dismissed, sergeant.</i>

850
01:25:30,539 --> 01:25:32,205
Tell him I won't
give him any trouble.

851
01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:43,249
I came to tell you you're free.

852
01:25:44,785 --> 01:25:46,718
I don't think I understand.

853
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:51,155
Well, the captain says you've
been hung once already anyway.

854
01:25:51,157 --> 01:25:53,724
He's sending that patrol
back onto general crook.

855
01:25:55,194 --> 01:25:57,494
That's mighty good news,
reverend.

856
01:25:58,763 --> 01:26:01,230
Real good news.

857
01:26:01,498 --> 01:26:04,198
Uh, reverend, what about mark?

858
01:26:04,433 --> 01:26:07,767
Oh, he's fine.
I brought your things.

859
01:26:11,672 --> 01:26:13,638
Look, if the cavalry
doesn't want me,

860
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,573
is there any reason
why I can't see the boy?

861
01:26:18,244 --> 01:26:21,478
Well, he's a ward of the army.

862
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:24,247
I'm supposed to, uh,
find a home for him.

863
01:26:24,249 --> 01:26:28,251
I told you about
that Mrs. Mciver.

864
01:26:28,486 --> 01:26:31,153
The home he really
wants is with you,

865
01:26:31,155 --> 01:26:33,421
only he's afraid
that you don't want him.

866
01:26:33,423 --> 01:26:37,224
That ain't true. I offered to take
him with me once. He knows that.

867
01:26:37,226 --> 01:26:42,495
Yes, but was that because you wanted
him or because you just had no choice?

868
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:46,265
Well, things
were different then.

869
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:51,735
Look, how do you truly feel
about the boy now?

870
01:26:54,573 --> 01:26:57,574
Well, I don't know if anybody will
trust me with my record and all,

871
01:26:57,576 --> 01:27:00,944
but if I could have the boy,
reverend, well,

872
01:27:00,946 --> 01:27:03,179
you bet I want him.

873
01:27:27,738 --> 01:27:32,540
We do good, huh, Clint? Yeah,
you did just great. Just great.

874
01:27:32,542 --> 01:27:35,209
Well, I guess I'd better be
gettin' on back.

875
01:27:35,211 --> 01:27:38,645
<i>This, uh, arrangement</i>
<i>was my decision.</i>

876
01:27:38,647 --> 01:27:42,649
<i>I might have some explaining
to do to the captain.</i>

877
01:27:42,651 --> 01:27:44,283
<i>Thank you, chaplain.</i>
<i>Thanks for everything.</i>

878
01:27:44,285 --> 01:27:46,618
<i>That's all right.</i>

879
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:22,016
She's dead.

880
01:28:23,819 --> 01:28:27,487
Yeah, well...

881
01:28:27,489 --> 01:28:29,989
she wasn't much to look at.

882
01:28:29,991 --> 01:28:34,460
Pure impossible to
get along with, but...

883
01:28:34,528 --> 01:28:37,729
She saved both our lives
more than once.

884
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:46,704
You know,

885
01:28:46,706 --> 01:28:50,007
there near the end,
I think she...

886
01:28:50,009 --> 01:28:52,709
Even kind of enjoyed hatin' me.

887
01:28:54,813 --> 01:28:57,947
Well, maybe
a little anyway, huh?

888
01:29:28,011 --> 01:29:31,045
Clint. Yeah?

889
01:29:31,047 --> 01:29:33,013
When you take me
to see blue feather?

890
01:29:33,015 --> 01:29:36,082
Well, how about next summer?

891
01:29:36,551 --> 01:29:38,984
We'll go visit her on the
reservation, the both of us.

892
01:29:38,986 --> 01:29:40,952
After we go to Mexico?

893
01:29:40,954 --> 01:29:45,523
Yeah, well, Mexico, uh...

894
01:29:45,525 --> 01:29:47,658
you know, seein' how
I'm a free man,

895
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:50,460
I've been thinking
maybe we could, um,

896
01:29:50,462 --> 01:29:53,563
oh, run up maybe to...

897
01:29:53,565 --> 01:29:55,765
Mountain creek, Colorado,
someplace like that instead.

898
01:29:55,867 --> 01:29:58,467
<i>What do you think?</i>

899
01:30:02,473 --> 01:30:04,473
All right, come on.

900
01:30:09,813 --> 01:30:13,581
Well, looks like we're back
to ridin' double again.

901
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,482
Come on, thirsty.
