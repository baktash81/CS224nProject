1
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
Whoo-hoo!

2
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,900
G-a-b, hey! G-a-b, hey!

3
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,000
It's so much soul

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,900
Who's got the souls
of Rolling Stones?

5
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,000
On the road that's cold

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
What do we do? We G-a-b

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,900
With the groove, with the vibe

8
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,100
With the rhythm completely

9
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,400
Jump on the mike, I bet

10
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,900
We got soul, and don't you forget it

11
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
So come, come, come,
come, come again

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm rocking on the mike

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,700
So much soul

14
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,200
We're young, we're hip

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,900
Get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up...

16
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,800
Come on, man. Let's go.

17
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,500
We've got soul

18
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Uh, uh, uh, uh-huh

19
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,100
I got it, you got it

20
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,400
I got it, you got it

21
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,000
He's got soul

22
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,100
I got it, you got it

23
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,800
Here we go, here we go

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,500
You got it

25
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
1, 2, here we go again

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
Your mouth's ready to blow again

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,500
Making sure, jack...

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,800
"Reihi was a Taniwha.

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
"She lived at the bottom
of a huge lake.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,100
"She spent most of her time

31
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,900
"taking care of a greenstone wall.

32
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,100
"The wall stopped the water

33
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,600
"from flooding over the people

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
"who lived by Reihi's lake.

35
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,800
"Once a month, the people would bring

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
"a huge piece of greenstone

37
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,900
to help Reihi keep the wall strong. "

38
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,300
especially if you drive around

39
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,600
the big towns, people.

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,500
Hope you love my wife, you know...

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,100
I was just checking out

42
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,400
the weather situation.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,300
A few showers as well

44
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,300
and light winds at first,

45
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,300
but it's going to be getting better

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,100
throughout the day and the night...

47
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,300
A bit of cloud
and a bit of rain as well.

48
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,000
People, I've just had
a phone call from Darren.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Now, apparently, Darren's
just lost his girlfriend.

50
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,600
Brother...

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
I'd say we are in business, my man.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,800
What's happening, everybody?

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,800
Aah!

54
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,300
Settle down!

55
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,000
"Then the children
would run and laugh

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,400
as they collected all the fish
Reihi had left for them. "

57
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,100
Was it a good story, kids?

58
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, I liked it.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,100
No. It's dumb.

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,900
What's a Taniwha?

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
It's a creature
that looks after people.

62
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,200
Where the fuck is everyone?!

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,700
What are you doing home?

64
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,200
I got something for you.

65
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Come on, Hu, let's go!

66
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Go on, open it.

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,700
What do you reckon, kids?

68
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,000
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Oh, yum!

70
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,600
- Oh, Jake!
- Look at all the kai moana!

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,000
Bloody oceans of the stuff!

72
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,500
- I'm hungry!
- Me, too!

73
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,300
Go on, kids. Grab some.

74
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,600
Take it outside.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,100
Come on, Hu.

76
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,900
Got to eat them outside.

77
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,300
Where the fuck you off to?
Come have a feed, boy.

78
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,400
No.

79
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Fuck him.

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
Jake, not on the table, hon.

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, why not? I want a feed.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
Well, the kids might come in.

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,200
Well, what about the chair?

84
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,200
Remember?

85
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
So...

86
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,800
where did all the seafood come from?

87
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,300
I got lucky.

88
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
I got laid off.

89
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,500
What?

90
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,900
Whoa, whoa, woman. Let me finish.

91
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,100
Jake Heke, you've got
a family to feed.

92
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
- You've got bills.
- Look, I've signed up for the dole.

93
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,600
It's only 17 bucks a week
less than my wages.

94
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Well, don't look like that.
It's not the end of the world.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,400
What about our house?

96
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,200
We got a house,

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,900
and the government ain't
going to kick us out.

98
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,200
The rent's cheap.

99
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,600
I want us to have
our own home, Jake.

100
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Damn you. We can't make
bloody ends meet as it is.

101
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Forget the bloody house.

102
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,600
Let's talk about the bedroom.

103
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,800
Oh, don't, Jake!

104
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,900
You fucking got to spoil
everything, don't you?

105
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,600
Fuck you!

106
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,100
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

107
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Scoo da da do wa oh

108
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,200
Ooh, I left this mark
on this world

109
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,000
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

110
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Scoo da da do wa oh

111
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,700
Yo, Toot.

112
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,600
Yo, G.

113
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
What you up to?

114
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,500
Oh, you know, a bit
of this and the other.

115
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,300
You never know when
the Queen might drop by.

116
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,100
Well, if she does,
here's something to feed her.

117
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,200
Bloody Santa Claus!

118
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,400
Do you think we'll ever
get out of here, Toot?

119
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,700
I don't know.

120
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,200
Maybe.

121
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,900
You know, when I'm old enough
to get the dole,

122
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,200
I might just do this baby up
and drive on out.

123
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,300
Can I come, too?

124
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,000
Of course. You're my best mate.

125
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey, Gracie, did you
bring your book?

126
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,100
Oh, I forgot.

127
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,900
I just finished a new story, too,

128
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,500
but I can remember most of it.

129
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,800
Choice!

130
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,200
The story was about a Taniwha.

131
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,800
Do you know what a Taniwha is?

132
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,800
Well, Reihi was a Taniwha.

133
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,600
She lived at the bottom
of this lake.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
Now, she spent most of her time

135
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,700
looking after this huge
greenstone wall.

136
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,200
The wall stopped the water

137
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,900
from flooding over the people

138
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
who lived by Reihi's lake.

139
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,900
Once a month, the people would bring...

140
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,100
Beth Heke?

141
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,700
What now?

142
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,600
Been keeping bad company.

143
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,200
Was that before or after
you picked him up?

144
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,100
So what's the charge?

145
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,300
Oh, he's lucky this time.

146
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,800
Two older boys stole the car.

147
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
He's just hanging around
with the wrong crowd.

148
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,500
Still, it's not going
to look good tomorrow

149
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,800
when he appears in court
on those other charges.

150
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,600
You think you know everything
about us, don't you?

151
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,100
It's my job.

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,100
Is she a Taniwha, Mom?

153
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,800
No, son.

154
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,100
Well, we'll leave
Boogie with you, then.

155
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,600
- Mark.
- Pardon?

156
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,700
My son's name is Mark.

157
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,900
Well, that's not
the name he gave us.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,800
You get those lonely, lonely

159
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,900
Lonely, lonely blues

160
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,600
When you're on your own.

161
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,700
Mm-hmm

162
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,300
So all you've got to do

163
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,500
Is call up on the phone

164
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,000
No need to be alone.

165
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,300
Mm-hmm

166
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,300
And if you lose your way

167
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,700
And you've got nowhere to go...

168
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,400
The usual.

169
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,000
What's your fucking problem?

170
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,400
Check that out, bro.

171
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
The man can sure pack a punch.

172
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
He's been behind bars, I bet.

173
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,900
Yeah, right. Bloody zoo.

174
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,000
If I wanted to drink with women,

175
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'd drink in the bloody
lounge bar, huh?

176
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,900
I've had women up to here.

177
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,600
Come on, Polly. Help your sister.

178
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,400
Set the table, girl.

179
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,800
There are reports that they've had

180
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
at least one sighting of the Virgin.

181
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh, no wonder we got it...

182
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,300
Why, Boog?

183
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,600
Don't know.

184
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,900
You don't know?

185
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,300
Do you know you
have to go to court tomorrow?

186
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,100
Do you remember what Bennett said?

187
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,300
Jeez, Boog, what's
bloody wrong with you?

188
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,300
Don't know.

189
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,400
When you were a kid,
you wouldn't even take

190
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,500
a piece of fruit without asking.

191
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,600
You're going to come
tomorrow, aren't you, Mom?

192
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,400
Yes, we'll be there. Will you?

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,300
Yeah. Just keep your hands

194
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,700
in your pockets there, brother.

195
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,200
Come on, bro. I'd just
like to see them smile.

196
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Oh, you mean like this?

197
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
You dirty bastard.

198
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
I can make mine smile all right.

199
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,900
I just can't make the woman happy.

200
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I took a big feed
of seafood home today...

201
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,500
bloody everything.

202
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,400
Just wanted to put
a smile on her face.

203
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,700
You think she'd let me? No chance.

204
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,600
All I told her was I got laid off.

205
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,700
Anyone would have thought I told her

206
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,600
that my prick dropped off.

207
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Laid off twice in one day, eh, bro?

208
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,700
Poor bastard.

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,700
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,900
You're leaving home in the morning

211
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,100
You come on home in the night

212
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,300
Ooh, babe...

213
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,300
Fucking beautiful.

214
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,200
And when I ask you, babe

215
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,900
You just say, you're right

216
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
But you don't know

217
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,500
What my heart's been going through

218
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
Staying up late

219
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Just waitin' on you

220
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,900
When will you be the one for me?

221
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Oh, yeah, without your love

222
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,700
I can't make it

223
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,300
You're all...

224
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,300
Gee, where did you
get those muscles from?

225
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,800
Bro, you've been lifting
those weights, huh?

226
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,300
What, you've done lag?
Am I right?

227
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,000
You want to fuck with me?

228
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,600
You should learn
to pay your respects.

229
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,400
In case you want
to know, it's Jake...

230
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Jake the Muss.

231
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,500
Mmm, loving you is all I need, boy

232
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,000
I was right... too much weights,
not enough speed work.

233
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,900
Useless prick.

234
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Cheers.

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,900
Into me

236
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,800
Am I not enough for you...

237
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Party at my place tonight, boys.

238
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,800
Come on, Poll. Bed.

239
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,100
Come on, Hu.

240
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,000
Hurry up, Polly.

241
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500
Thanks, Bub.

242
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,300
- Good night, Mum.
- Night-night, Polly.

243
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,900
You, too, mister.

244
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,300
You've got a big day tomorrow.

245
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,600
You won't forget, eh, Mum?

246
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,800
How can I forget

247
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
with you reminding me
every 5 minutes?

248
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,700
Good night, son.

249
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,300
Good night, Mum.

250
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,500
Whoo-hoo!

251
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,300
Your old man was
sure swinging tonight.

252
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
He'll be swinging, all right,

253
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,000
by the time I've finished with him.

254
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,000
Did you hear he got the sack?

255
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,200
Doesn't surprise me, girl...

256
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,500
days he took off.

257
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,100
Beth, babe.

258
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,000
Dooley!

259
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,800
You should have seen
the Muss in action.

260
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
It was beautiful.

261
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,000
He decked a bloody gorilla.

262
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,600
He was big. Man, was he big.

263
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,300
Fucking huge.

264
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
It has to be said...

265
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
almost as big as that
thing in Bully's pants.

266
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,700
Notice he said almost, ladies?

267
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,300
Yeah, right.

268
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,500
Hey, girl, you should have
seen him, though.

269
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Dool's right... big...

270
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,200
and bloody ugly.

271
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,200
Well, he didn't get
everything right, though.

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,500
Well, it's just that Bully
isn't that big, girl.

273
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

274
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,200
Mmm, you're hot tonight, girl.

275
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, ever since Jake

276
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,100
put his hand halfway up my skirt.

277
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,800
Ooh, I might have to
go home early tonight.

278
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,000
Yo, Mave. Give us a song.

279
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,500
Come on, Mave!

280
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,800
How about you and Beth sing for me?

281
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,800
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

282
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,900
OK, OK, OK.

283
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,200
Give us a G. Give us a G.

284
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,200
Well, I've tried

285
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,000
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

286
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,400
As hard as I can

287
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,200
Just to make you

288
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,300
Understand

289
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,100
'Cause the world

290
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,900
It won't stop

291
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,100
It keeps goin'

292
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,200
Goin' round and round

293
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,100
I guess the nature

294
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,300
The nature of love

295
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,500
Hurts always, always

296
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,300
What are you doing?

297
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,800
Couldn't you sleep, either?

298
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,900
Aren't they beautiful
when they're like that?

299
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,900
I wish I could see them.

300
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,700
I remember

301
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,200
They're just drunk. That's all.

302
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,300
All those yesterdays

303
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,100
People show their true feelings
when they're drunk.

304
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
Understanding

305
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,300
Man, Gracie, you've got
some far-out ideas.

306
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,100
I thought Mum said
you were growing up.

307
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,900
At least I'm not going
to court tomorrow.

308
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, sorry, Boog.

309
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,300
I didn't mean it.

310
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,100
Oh, what the hell.

311
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,900
What's the worst that can happen?

312
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,700
The nature of love

313
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,400
And it's always,
always been this way

314
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,600
So, now, my lover

315
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,400
There'll be no other

316
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,300
The stars in the heavens

317
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,900
Will shine forever

318
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,800
Moments we treasure

319
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,600
You and I in love

320
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,200
So, darlin'

321
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Here is my heart

322
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,700
So, darlin'

323
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,300
Here is my heart

324
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,700
So, darlin'

325
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,900
Here is my heart

326
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
Ohh

327
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,500
Yeah

328
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,500
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

329
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
You're a hard lady, Bethie.

330
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,900
And you're a hard man, Jakey.

331
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Play another one, someone.

332
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,300
Next time, watch what you say

333
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,900
in front of the fucking women!

334
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,300
How's that for true feelings?

335
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Oh, don't play that shit, friend.

336
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,900
Play something we all know.

337
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,200
Later!

338
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,000
Have a feed. Have a feed.

339
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,900
Have a feed.

340
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,800
Hey, Mavis, come have
a drink with me, mate!

341
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
What's up with bloody Millie?

342
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,200
Is she spoiling the party, or what?

343
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,600
Too much gin and not enough sex.

344
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,600
Hey, hey, hey.

345
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,300
I'm not going to miss out tonight.

346
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,700
Dooley, eh?

347
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,400
Strike when the pants
are ready to drop.

348
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Looks like they've
already dropped, Mave.

349
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,000
Bloody bastard!

350
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,500
Never mind him, Mave.
Come have a feed.

351
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,400
There's still a bit left
in the bottom.

352
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,700
Dooley, what the fuck
are you doing?

353
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,200
You're with me!

354
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,200
Got any money?

355
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,600
Money?

356
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,300
What for?

357
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,400
You don't need money.

358
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,300
You got everything
you want right here.

359
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,700
You got booze, food.

360
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,500
The old man.

361
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,200
Don't give me your bullshit excuses!

362
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
Come on. Let's go.

363
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Have a drink with me, son.

364
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,300
Remember how we used to
talk and laugh?

365
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,900
We could talk and talk,
you and me.

366
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Remember?

367
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,100
You're drunk.

368
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,100
I'm not drunk.

369
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm happy.

370
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,300
Then you're out of your fuckin' head.

371
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
Oh, I'm so sorry, babe.

372
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,200
I didn't... hang on.

373
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,900
Hang on, son. I got some money.

374
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Hey, cook us some eggs, eh, Beth?

375
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,000
Ooh, and some bacon.

376
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,900
Fuck off!

377
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,100
What the fuck's going on?

378
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
I asked for some eggs, but...

379
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,100
Cook the man some eggs.

380
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
You want eggs?

381
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Well, have the bloody lot of them!

382
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,900
It's OK, man.

383
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,900
Cook the man some fucking eggs.

384
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,500
Do it yourself, Jake!

385
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,300
I'm not the fuckin' slave
around here, Jake!

386
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,000
No, you can...

387
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,900
You're a fuckin' coward!

388
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,900
Leave her alone,
you fucking bastard!

389
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,400
Stop it! Stop it!

390
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,100
It's OK, Poll.

391
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,700
Shh! Shh!

392
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,400
Shush, Hu.

393
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,200
Shh!

394
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,600
I want Mummy!

395
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,700
Shush, Hu.

396
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's OK, Poll.

397
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,800
Your fuckin' mouth!

398
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,400
You do as you're fucking told!

399
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,800
Fuck. Last time, I got 20 bucks.

400
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,700
So what are you up to, Gracie?

401
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,000
You could help.

402
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,900
Not me. Waste of bloody time.

403
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,000
You should leave it.

404
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,200
There'll be plenty of time
for you to clean up

405
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,000
after drunken fucking parties.

406
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,900
What do you mean?

407
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,200
When you get married, girl.

408
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,900
Who said I want to?

409
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,800
It's just the way things are.

410
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,200
No. The fellas around here
are too ugly.

411
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,300
It's just a matter of time, Gracie.

412
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Who did the prick smack over?

413
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,800
Grace?

414
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,900
The fuckin' bastard!

415
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,100
Where are you going?

416
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,900
Out of this fuckin' hole!

417
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,600
They've eaten the whole lot.

418
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,300
I'm hungry.

419
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,100
How about some Chinese?

420
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,100
Yuck!

421
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,500
Where's Mum?

422
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,000
Well, she's not bloody here, is she?

423
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,500
Look, there's one more pea.

424
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,600
Mum?

425
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah, I know, Boog.

426
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,100
Do you want an aspirin?

427
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Listen, Boog...

428
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,600
Grace can go with you, eh?

429
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,300
Give a good impression.

430
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,300
I'm not feeling the best, son.

431
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,800
Just give me time to wash up.

432
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,700
Nothing that a good
coffee won't fix.

433
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,100
I'll catch a later bus.

434
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,400
OK, Boog?

435
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,700
Ya, sure.

436
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,500
We love the reggae girls,
we love the reggae girls

437
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,500
The reggae music make you
jump and stomp, yes

438
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,800
The reggae music make you
dance and prance, yes

439
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,300
So everybody come
and shake your butt, yes

440
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,700
'Cause this the music,
and I'm the best, yes

441
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,600
And this is something
that they must confess, yes...

442
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,300
Do you reckon we should go in?

443
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,800
Nah. Wait for Mum.

444
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,500
Come on, son. We're running late.

445
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,200
Didn't I tell you I was
picking you up this morning?

446
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,800
Forgot.

447
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,900
Come on.

448
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,000
Bit of trouble
at your place last night.

449
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,800
Look, Mark, I have to be honest.

450
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
You're on remand.

451
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,400
The cops say they
found you on the streets.

452
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,700
They're going to try
and persuade the judge

453
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,800
that your parents can't control you.

454
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,300
I've seen your mother.

455
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,100
I don't think she's going
to make it here this morning.

456
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,300
She's going to catch a later bus.

457
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,000
- Morning.
- Hi.

458
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,500
Mark, you ready? Better go in.

459
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,300
Come on.

460
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,200
Nig Heke, eh?

461
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,300
Son of Jake the Muss.

462
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,800
You a bit of a chip off
the old block, boy?

463
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,700
I'm nothing like him.

464
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,800
Yeah, we'll see.

465
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,600
So today's the day, boy.

466
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,600
Judgment day.

467
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
How bad do you want in?

468
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,500
Didn't hear you, boy.

469
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,700
I want a patch.

470
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,600
You hear that, brothers?

471
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,400
He wants a patch.

472
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,400
You'll have to get through me first.

473
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,000
Do all right with women, boy?

474
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,200
I do all right.

475
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,100
Must be your flashy smile, eh?

476
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,700
Value your teeth?

477
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,500
You like your pretty-boy face.

478
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,100
Call you Michael Jackson,

479
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,700
except we'll rearrange it for free.

480
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,100
You think about that, boy,

481
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,300
before you think about any patch.

482
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,900
Is that right, Mark?

483
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,800
You admit to the burglaries?

484
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,900
And what about these
motor-vehicle charges?

485
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,000
Will you be withdrawing those?

486
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,700
Yes, your honor, but we recommend

487
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,400
that Mark goes into
social welfare custody.

488
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
Take your hat off, please, sergeant.

489
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,600
We picked him up yesterday.

490
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Sir, it's pretty clear
that his parents

491
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,900
can't look after him.

492
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
And, um...

493
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,300
what do you two have?

494
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,900
I'm in a difficult position.

495
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,600
I've had no contact
with Mark's parents, and...

496
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,700
Yes, well, I was hoping

497
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,400
the boy's mother would be here today.

498
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,400
I was around there this morning,

499
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,200
and after what I saw...

500
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,600
I don't think Mark
should be at home.

501
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,500
Yes. Yes. All right.

502
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,400
Things seem to be going
from bad to worse

503
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,300
for you, don't they, Mark?

504
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Under the circumstances,

505
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,800
if your parents can't control you,

506
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,600
I'll have to remand you
in social welfare custody.

507
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,900
Nig Heke's brother.

508
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Looks like a fucking poofter to me.

509
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,300
Baby, you can fuck
with me any day.

510
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,500
Now, you can either
do this the hard way,

511
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,100
or you can make it work for you.

512
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,400
- It's your choice.
- What do you mean?

513
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,400
You can let me help you,

514
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
and you might learn something,

515
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,900
or you could end up in jail.

516
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,000
Because that's where you're heading.

517
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,800
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I see you a moment?

518
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,300
Uh, yeah. I'll see you outside.

519
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,700
Please try, Boog.

520
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,500
It can't be that bad, eh?

521
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,600
At least you'll be doing
something different.

522
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,100
Hey, I could even write to you.

523
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,600
I've never had anyone
to write to before.

524
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,400
Gee, girl, you started without me.

525
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,500
Jeez, woman, is that the result

526
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
of one hell of an orgasm or what?

527
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,800
What the hell happened?

528
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,000
Same old story.

529
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,100
Never learn to keep my mouth shut.

530
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,400
Help yourself to a beer.

531
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,400
Ah, what the hell.

532
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,200
Surprised there's any left.

533
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,100
Well, you know the rules, girl.

534
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Keep your mouth shut
and your legs open.

535
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,200
Didn't get to court, then, eh?

536
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,100
Like this?

537
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,900
Do more harm than good.

538
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,600
Welfare came round this morning.

539
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,200
Promised Boog I'd be there for him.

540
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
That boy's got to learn
to stand on his own two feet.

541
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
You're going to
have to take a chain saw

542
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,700
to those apron strings, girl.

543
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,800
He's not strong
like the others, Mave.

544
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,000
Ah, shit. I remember
when he was a wee fella.

545
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,100
Couldn't tear him off you.

546
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,900
He'll be all right.

547
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,200
It's Nig I'd worry about.

548
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,400
It doesn't seem
like that long ago

549
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,000
that Nig was a baby.

550
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,400
Well, he's not a baby anymore,

551
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,200
that's for sure!

552
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,400
Jeez, you should have
seen Jake, Mave,

553
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,400
boasting about his baby boy...

554
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,000
till Nig started crying at night.

555
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,000
That's about when those
two parted company.

556
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,900
Ain't that the truth?
Bloody men.

557
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,600
Jeez, he was a beautiful baby, Mave.

558
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,100
Oh, enough bloody talk, girl.

559
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,500
Hit the fella over the head!

560
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,400
Tell him to wake his ideas up.

561
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,700
Bloody gangs.

562
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,100
Kati!

563
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,200
So how you doing, boy?

564
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,700
The brothers can't hear you, boy.

565
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,900
Timata!

566
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,200
Kati!

567
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,900
Brother,

568
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,700
now you've met your new family.

569
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
Grace!

570
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,500
I wanted to be there, Grace.

571
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,100
I couldn't.

572
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,300
They'd have sent him away.

573
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
You've seen the state of me, Bub.

574
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,300
They did.

575
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,100
They did, Mum.

576
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,300
They sent Boog away.

577
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,600
But how can they do that...

578
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,900
just take someone's son away?

579
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,300
It's OK, Mum.

580
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,400
Boog seemed OK.

581
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,200
He should be at home with us.

582
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,500
Can't a man get some
fuckin' sleep around here?

583
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,500
Fuck, woman, you look fucking awful.

584
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,900
Go clean yourself up.

585
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,600
This is as cleaned up

586
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,200
as I get, you bastard.

587
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,700
Tried getting cleaned up
all morning

588
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,600
so I could go to court with our son.

589
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,700
Our son, Jake!

590
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,800
What the fuck's Nig been up to?

591
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,600
You have no idea, do you?

592
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,200
Boogie!

593
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,100
Boogie? Is that right?

594
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
He's gone, Jake.

595
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,900
He's gone to welfare, and you slept

596
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,900
through the whole bloody thing.

597
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Is that all?

598
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,000
Is that what all this
slamming of fucking doors,

599
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,700
crying, and carrying on is about?

600
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,700
Fuck!

601
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,900
The boy is soft.

602
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,200
It'll toughen him up.

603
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,800
Anyone would think
he bloody died or something.

604
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,900
Hey, so go do something
about the way you look.

605
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,800
You're starting to
make me feel fucking sick.

606
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,700
You did this to me, you bastard.

607
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,500
I hope you spew your guts out.

608
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,600
You know your fucking
problem, eh, woman?

609
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,700
You're too bloody lippy,

610
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,100
too bloody smart-mouthed.

611
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,200
You're a bad example
for the fucking kids.

612
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,700
Always writing, aren't you?
Too fucking smart.

613
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,800
You'll end up like
your mother here.

614
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,200
I hate him.

615
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,300
Bring your book here, Bub.

616
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,700
What you been writing?

617
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,600
I was going to write to Boog.

618
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,600
You got a good nature, girl.

619
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,400
Mr. Bennett said we could visit.

620
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,200
It's all right for those fellas.

621
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,900
They've got everything
at their fingertips...

622
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,500
flashy car, plenty of money.

623
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,300
Easy for them.

624
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,800
Knew we couldn't.

625
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,100
I didn't say we couldn't.

626
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,400
It just won't be easy.

627
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,400
Got to find the money.

628
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,300
Do you think we could?

629
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,000
Yes. Yes, I do.

630
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,000
I promise.

631
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,900
I love you, Mum.

632
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,000
I love you, too, Bub.

633
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,100
Come and suck on this.

634
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,700
You fellas are too ugly.

635
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,000
Did you hear? Boog got sent away.

636
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,400
Yeah, I heard.

637
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,800
- Boys' home, right?
- Ya.

638
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,700
- You want a puff?
- Nah.

639
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,700
Well, yeah. Why not?

640
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,300
He's going to be OK, though.

641
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,400
And you know why?

642
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,300
Because Mum said we can visit...

643
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,800
you know, as a family.

644
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,300
Isn't that choice?

645
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,400
Yeah. Yeah. Choice.

646
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
What do you think
it'll be like?

647
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,900
What? The boys' home?

648
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,700
Got to be better than this car.

649
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,900
You going to hold on to that

650
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,000
till it goes out?

651
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,400
Oh. Sorry.

652
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,300
You're the only one
I can talk to.

653
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,200
You know that, Toot?

654
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,300
Yeow, G. Best mates...

655
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,300
forever.

656
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,200
250 smackeroonies.

657
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,700
Fuckin' beautiful.

658
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,600
Fuckin' tin-ass.

659
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,100
Must be your shout, eh, bro?

660
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,700
Yeah, all right, all right.

661
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,700
Well, bloody hell.

662
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,300
I should have brought
the video camera.

663
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,900
Get out and stay out,

664
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,000
you fucking bastard!

665
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,400
Hey, Muss.

666
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,100
Have a win on the Gigis, Muss?

667
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,200
Look at the bloody
state of you, man.

668
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,900
You're a fucking mess.

669
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,900
Don't you ever speak
to me again, you hear?

670
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,900
You might spoil my night.

671
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,500
Good evening, ladies.

672
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
I've just had a bit of a windfall,

673
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,900
and since you're looking
so bloody beautiful,

674
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,900
I thought I might buy
you gals a drink,

675
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,000
especially the one
standing here

676
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,300
in his fucking party dress.

677
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Barman, 6 milk shakes, eh?

678
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,100
Easy on the ice cream.

679
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,300
Ooh. Forget it, lady.

680
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,300
You looked better
before you turned around.

681
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,200
Fuck, boy, you're too much.

682
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,500
If you want to be
like your old man,

683
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,100
learn how to stand
on your own two feet.

684
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,500
Fuck. Is that your old man?

685
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,000
Piss off.
I don't have an old man.

686
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,000
You're still a bloody
attractive woman.

687
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,400
You mean after you
take to me with your fists?

688
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,000
You make me sick.

689
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,100
Oh, hon, you still
on about the other week?

690
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,800
I told you, I'm sorry.

691
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,300
And I told you
when I get like that,

692
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,100
get out of my way.

693
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,700
But you have to get
all lippy on me.

694
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,200
I got a temper on me,
but who hasn't?

695
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,900
You're priceless.

696
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,900
Well, at least I try
to make it up to you.

697
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,400
Get off me, Jake.

698
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,400
Oh, you're a hard lady.

699
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

700
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,000
Sit down and keep a man company.

701
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,500
I've got things to think about.

702
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Like what?

703
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,200
Since when were you interested?

704
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,800
Well, if you can't tell

705
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,400
by the way I just grabbed you,

706
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,600
I must be losing my touch.

707
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,500
If you're not gonna take me
seriously, Jake...

708
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,200
Take it easy. Talk to Jakey.

709
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,300
It's just...

710
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,400
It's just what?

711
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,500
Jeez, you're pretty.

712
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,700
I want us to visit Boogie.

713
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,300
Is that all?

714
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,700
Go together, as a family.

715
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,500
You know, make a day of it,

716
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,500
take up a nice picnic lunch.

717
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,800
Maybe we could rent
a car for the day.

718
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,300
Oh, yeah. Maybe we could
fuckin' fly.

719
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,700
It's not impossible, Jake.

720
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,200
I've worked it out.

721
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,100
There's the money Auntie Matawai
sent me at Christmas.

722
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,600
If I put a bit aside each week

723
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,500
from the housekeeping,

724
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,600
in a month, maybe we could go.

725
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,200
Please, Jake?

726
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,900
And this whole day
means a lot to you, huh?

727
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,800
Yes.

728
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,500
Book the fuckin' limousine.

729
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,800
Horses, babe.

730
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,500
Honest.

731
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,500
Now, will you come here?

732
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,800
Tell Jakey you love him.

733
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,900
That's the trouble,
Jake. I do.

734
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,700
- What's going on?
- It's Heke, sir.

735
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,800
He's got your taiaha, sir.

736
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
If you want to smash things, boy,

737
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,500
you start with me!

738
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,500
You think you're man enough
to hold a taiaha, boy?

739
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,800
I hate this fucking place!

740
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,800
You're not supposed to like it!

741
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,500
Let me go, you black bastard!

742
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,900
We are the same color, boy!

743
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,000
The British used to think

744
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,700
the bayonet was the most lethal

745
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,300
of all hand-to-hand
combat weapons,

746
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,300
till they came across our warriors,

747
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,100
who fought with a taiaha.

748
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,200
You think your fist
is your weapon?

749
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,100
When I have taught you,

750
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,100
your mind will be.

751
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,300
You'll carry your
taiaha inside you.

752
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,100
Come on.

753
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,700
Whoa, this is the life, eh, kids?

754
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,200
Don't even have to change gears.

755
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,200
Want to come and visit
your brother, son?

756
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,700
Nah. Got something else on.

757
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,100
Oh, come on, son...
as a family.

758
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,500
What? Too fucking busy
to visit your own brother, boy?

759
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,000
Rather be with a pack of wankers.

760
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,600
He would have come, Jake,

761
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,700
if you would have waited.

762
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,200
He would have.

763
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,400
Visits don't start
till after lunch.

764
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,100
We may as well take
a drive, eh, kids?

765
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,000
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

766
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,200
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

767
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,800
What's the time?

768
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,200
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

769
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,700
What's the time?

770
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,200
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

771
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,700
What's the time?

772
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,600
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

773
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,300
What's the time?

774
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,500
I said 1:00

775
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,700
2:00

776
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,900
3:00

777
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,100
4:00

778
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,400
5:00

779
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,800
6:00

780
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,200
Spooly, spooly,
spooly ooly dooly booly

781
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,200
7:00

782
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,600
8:00

783
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,900
9:00, widdly widdly widdly,
wee, wee, oh

784
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,500
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

785
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,300
What's the time?

786
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?

787
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,400
What's that place over there, Mum?

788
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,700
Taku Whenua Tuturu.

789
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,100
My piece of dirt.

790
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,300
That's where I was
brought up, kids.

791
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,800
What's that big house
over there, Mum?

792
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,300
That's the Wharenui.

793
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,900
It was a lot different
when I was a girl.

794
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,400
It was always impressive.

795
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,400
What's impressive?

796
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,800
Choice.

797
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,900
It was always choice.

798
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,200
And inside are the most

799
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,100
choicest carvings.

800
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,800
Go on, mum.

801
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,000
Oh, and inside are photos

802
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,600
of the old people

803
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,200
and the Tukutuku panels.

804
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,900
You know, I used to help Nannie

805
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,800
and Auntie Matawai repair them.

806
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,400
Well, why don't we
ever go there, Mum?

807
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,700
One day we'll all end up there.

808
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,300
See over there to the right?

809
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,000
That's the Urupa...

810
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,100
the family cemetery.

811
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,100
All my family are buried there.

812
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,300
I'd love to go and see them.

813
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,500
Not before me, you don't.

814
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,900
Your father and I
were going to get hitched there.

815
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
Except we didn't.

816
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,800
I wasn't bloody good enough...

817
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,800
not for their royal highness.

818
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,100
Tell them everything,
why don't you?

819
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,200
Your mother was beautiful...

820
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,800
pride of the fucking tribe...

821
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,400
And this old black-ass comes along

822
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,400
and steals her away.

823
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,100
And you know where
I come from, kids?

824
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,000
A long line of slaves.

825
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,200
Fucking slaves.

826
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,400
I'd like to see those wankers

827
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,500
call Jake the Muss that now.

828
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,200
Ah, this place gives me the creeps.

829
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,200
Come on, kids.

830
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,700
Doesn't give me the creeps.

831
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,400
You never met my grandmother.

832
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,800
Eh, Jake?

833
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,200
Jake?

834
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,600
Just want to show
our flash car to my mates.

835
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,900
Whoa, bro, you know what
the penalty is for car theft?

836
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,700
Just one beer, huh?

837
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,600
One, Jake.

838
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,100
Just the one.

839
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,500
Promise?

840
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,100
Cross my heart.

841
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,100
Cheer.

842
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,400
Cheer.

843
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,600
Ah, cheer.

844
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,400
Cheer, bro.

845
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,900
Cheer.

846
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,300
Cheer.

847
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,200
How long is Dad gonna be?

848
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,500
I'd get that tone out of your voice

849
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,200
if I were you.

850
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,200
How many times have
you seen your father

851
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,900
like today, Grace?

852
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,400
Never... that's how many,

853
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,800
so just give him a chance, eh?

854
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,800
Now running on the track,

855
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,400
it's Robin the Fair...

856
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,400
Bethie! Name your poison.

857
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
Oh, no, thanks, Dooley.

858
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,500
Jake and I are going to
visit our son Boogie.

859
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,000
- Aren't we, Jake?
- Yeah, yeah. Just a minute.

860
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,600
I'm trying to listen
to the horse race.

861
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:32,700
You promised, Jake.

862
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,400
Shut up, woman.

863
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,600
You'll make me miss
who won the fuckin' race.

864
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,900
The kids are hungry.

865
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,600
Well, feed them.

866
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,200
You got bootloads of the stuff.

867
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,200
We'll be waiting.

868
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,100
Come on, come on.
Come up, come up.

869
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,600
So he's not coming?

870
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,600
Oh, he's coming, all right.

871
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,500
You're hopeful.

872
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,500
No, Grace.

873
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,000
It's just a woman's
lot, that's all.

874
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,000
One day you'll understand.

875
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

876
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,800
Stop, stop.

877
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,500
It's good, but it's
not good enough!

878
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,300
I've told you fellas
time and again,

879
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,200
this haka won't work

880
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,600
until you get the first action right!

881
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,800
You're reaching up
for all these ancestral lines,

882
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,800
and you're pulling them
down into your body!

883
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,500
The weight of your ancestors.

884
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,600
Some of you look
as though you're reaching

885
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,900
for butterflies or something.

886
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,700
Now, let's do it again...

887
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,500
and wake up!

888
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,500
And I in love

889
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,400
So, darling, here is my heart

890
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,100
Give me the keys, Jake.

891
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,000
I said, give me the keys.

892
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,200
What for?

893
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,900
I'm going to visit Boogie.

894
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:40,800
Bad idea.

895
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,800
The problem is
you've spoiled the boy.

896
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,700
You've got to toughen him up.

897
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,600
Give me the bloody keys!

898
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,100
That's it, woman. Just fuck off!

899
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,700
Take a bloody taxi.

900
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,200
You got all my bloody money.

901
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,000
Fuck.

902
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,000
I remember

903
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,800
All those yesterdays

904
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:17,900
Come on kids.

905
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,000
We'll walk around
to the taxi stand.

906
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,700
Taxi? What for?

907
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,100
We're going home.

908
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,200
No. We're going to see Boogie.

909
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,700
You promised.

910
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,800
Please, Grace, try to understand.

911
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,400
I don't want to listen
to any more of your lies.

912
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,700
I hate you! I hate you both!

913
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,600
Come on, kids.

914
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,900
Boogie? Son?

915
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,400
We were on our way.

916
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,700
We rented a car for the trip.

917
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,000
We had a bit of an accident, son.

918
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,700
Oh, well, you know

919
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,400
what your father's like

920
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,700
when he gets behind the wheel.

921
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,200
Had a picnic lunch all prepared.

922
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,400
Stayed up all last night.

923
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,500
I got in just what you like.

924
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,700
It was just a stupid accident.

925
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,800
Whoa. Party at my place tonight, boys.

926
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,100
- Hello!
- Hey!

927
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,600
Fuck. I need to piss.

928
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,900
Thanks, mate.

929
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,000
We really needed to know that.

930
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,200
Bethie, you awake?

931
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,500
Come party with us.

932
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,400
No.

933
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,100
No more, Jake.

934
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,600
I could tell straightaway

935
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,000
it was a holding.

936
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,600
What's more, it's
my mate's holding.

937
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,000
Next thing I know,
I give him a smack.

938
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,800
Oh, if it isn't Gracie.

939
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,000
Hu wanted some water.

940
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Come and give your uncle a kiss.

941
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,000
You're growing up fast, girl.

942
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,100
Where's mum?

943
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,100
She's in bed, where you should be.

944
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,000
What happened then, Jake?

945
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,200
He comes back at me
with this crowbar.

946
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,400
Yeah? And then what?

947
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,100
I take the crowbar off him

948
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,000
and give him another smack.

949
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,300
Good night, Hu.

950
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,000
Night-night.

951
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,500
Shh. Shh. It's OK, Gracie.

952
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,000
Uncle Bully is going
to be gentle with you...

953
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,500
as gentle as a lamb.

954
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,700
Shh.

955
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,300
Shh. Shh.

956
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,900
Your mum and dad are going to be

957
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,200
real angry at you,

958
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,100
turning me on like that...

959
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,100
coming downstairs in nothing

960
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,200
but that flimsy little nightie.

961
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,700
Shh, shh, shh.

962
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,100
It's our secret, hey, Gracie?

963
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,600
You hear me, girl?

964
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,400
Keep your mouth shut.

965
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,200
Did Huata wet the bed again, Bub?

966
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,900
You should have left it.
I'd have done that.

967
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,900
Just go away.

968
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,300
Go away.

969
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,900
Look, I don't blame you, Grace.

970
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,600
I wanted to see Boogie

971
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,000
as much as you.

972
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,400
You don't care about any of us.

973
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,600
That's not true.
I love you all.

974
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,100
But you're a liar!

975
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,200
Go on...

976
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,100
got your period, Bub.

977
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,600
It's bound to make you
a bit uptight...

978
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,700
Get out! Get out!

979
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,000
What's for breakfast?

980
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,600
You want something to eat,

981
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,400
fix it yourself.

982
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,000
Give me a coffee.

983
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Go and have a wash, Jake.

984
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,900
Clean your ears out
while you're at it.

985
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,900
What the fuck's up with you?

986
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,100
I'm not going to
take this anymore.

987
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,900
Do you hear me, Jake Heke?

988
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,100
No more.

989
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,300
We never got to see Boogie.

990
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,800
I don't want any more
of these drunken parties

991
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,100
or your bloody ugly
mongrel mates coming around.

992
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,800
It's no good...

993
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,100
no good for the kids,

994
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:13,800
especially now Grace is growing.

995
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,600
Who the fuck do you
think you are, eh?

996
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,400
Sitting there like
Lady Bloody Muck,

997
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,900
telling me in my own house

998
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,400
who I can and can't have here.

999
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,200
Well, I've asked
them back tonight,

1000
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,500
and you'd better be ready for it.

1001
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,100
Do you hear me?!

1002
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,600
Now, get off your fat ass

1003
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,000
and get busy.

1004
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,500
Oh, Grace!

1005
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,700
Leave that kid alone!
You know, that's your problem.

1006
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,800
You spoil the lot of them!

1007
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,700
No wonder they're all
so fucking screwed up!

1008
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,300
It's got nothing to do with you,

1009
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,300
eh, Jake Heke?

1010
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,300
You're such good father material!

1011
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,600
You chased Nig off!

1012
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,800
You couldn't give a damn
about Boogie!

1013
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,600
You're not gonna
hurt my babies anymore...

1014
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,800
not while I can do
something about it.

1015
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,500
Oh, you want something to eat?

1016
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,400
Learn how to cook.

1017
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,400
Grace!

1018
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,200
Grace!

1019
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,600
What's up?

1020
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,600
What?

1021
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,300
I said, what's up?

1022
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,000
How long have you
been sitting there?

1023
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,000
Why is everything so black, Toot?

1024
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,200
Don't know.

1025
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,400
Maybe 'cause we're all bloody Maoris.

1026
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,900
You got something...

1027
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,800
you got something to sniff?

1028
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,300
Yeah. A couple of old socks.

1029
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,300
What's going on, G?

1030
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,300
I thought you said
we were best friends.

1031
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,000
If you're too bloody mean,
just forget it.

1032
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,100
Hang on. Hang on.

1033
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,500
No glue, OK? OK?

1034
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,300
But I've got some dope.

1035
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,000
You want some of that?

1036
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,100
Ya.

1037
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,400
What's going on with you, Bub?

1038
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,900
What colors are you seeing now, G?

1039
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,400
Still all black?

1040
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,500
Not an old black in sight.

1041
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,200
Notice how you never see black
in a rainbow, do you?

1042
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,100
Just bright colors.

1043
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,700
Must be their pot.

1044
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,600
You know, the pot at
the end of the thing.

1045
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,900
Oh, dumb.

1046
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,500
Pot... the end of the thing.

1047
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,700
You're shit!

1048
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,300
You're just like
everyone else around here.

1049
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,000
I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1050
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,100
You're just a stupid kid

1051
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:34,100
that lives in an old wreck of a car.

1052
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,300
G! G! Come back, G!

1053
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,700
G, come back! What did I do?

1054
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,200
Please, G!

1055
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,000
I'm sorry!

1056
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,500
Please.

1057
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:54,500
This is the day
that the Lord has made

1058
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,300
That the Lord has made

1059
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,400
We will rejoice

1060
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,800
We will rejoice and be glad in it

1061
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,500
And be glad in it

1062
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,500
Whoa, for this is the day

1063
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,900
That the Lord has made

1064
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,600
We will rejoice and be glad in it

1065
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,200
This is the day, this is the day

1066
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,800
That the Lord has made

1067
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,800
This is the day
that the Lord has made

1068
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,800
That the Lord has made

1069
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,000
We will rejoice

1070
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,300
We will rejoice and be glad in it

1071
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,100
And be glad in it

1072
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,900
This is the day

1073
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,000
That the Lord has made

1074
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:40,300
We will rejoice and be glad in it

1075
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:44,000
This is the day, this is the day

1076
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,800
That the Lord has made

1077
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,600
Shit. It's nearly on empty.

1078
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,700
I've got money.

1079
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,900
Forget the money. It's just no good.

1080
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,700
We've been driving around for hours.

1081
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
When was the last time
you phoned home?

1082
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Uh, about 9:00.

1083
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,100
Jeez. It's nearly 11:00.

1084
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,000
I've got those

1085
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely blues

1086
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:49,600
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely blues

1087
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,000
I've got those

1088
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:57,100
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely blues

1089
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:01,100
Lonely, lonely blues

1090
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,100
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

1091
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,700
- Bring your ass in here, girl!
- Look what she done...

1092
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,900
I said in here! Move!

1093
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,000
Your mother's been out

1094
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,600
all day, half the fucking night!

1095
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,400
Now, where the fuck you been?

1096
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,900
Come on, bro, she's home now.

1097
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,900
Let the kid go to bed.

1098
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,200
Come on, Jake.

1099
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,600
Play the guitar, man.

1100
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,800
Go on. Piss off to bed.

1101
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,500
Hey, come on, give your Uncle Bully

1102
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,600
a kiss good night.

1103
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,500
I don't want to.

1104
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,700
What? I didn't hear you.

1105
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,400
I said I don't want to.

1106
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,400
What, you got
a hearing problem, girl?

1107
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,500
Hey, no. Leave it.

1108
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,200
Daddy, no!

1109
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,600
Daddy!

1110
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,700
I told you about this thing, eh?

1111
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,500
No fucking wonder you don't do
what you're fucking told!

1112
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,200
Take it easy, Jake.

1113
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,100
She's just a kid.

1114
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,400
Fuck! Get out of here!

1115
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,500
Bully, play us a song.

1116
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,800
Go on, dude.

1117
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,200
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

1118
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,700
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby

1119
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,700
Look what she done...

1120
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,800
Where is she?

1121
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,500
Stop your panic, woman.

1122
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,600
She's home.

1123
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,800
She won't be taking off anymore.

1124
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,300
Where is she, Jake?

1125
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:52,500
She pissed off out the back.

1126
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:00,200
What the fuck?

1127
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,500
Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh!

1128
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,000
Some-someone help me
get her down!

1129
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,100
Please! Please!

1130
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,200
Come on, baby. Come on, girl.

1131
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,000
It's all right, baby.

1132
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,300
Mummy's home. Mummy's home.

1133
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:29,700
Come on, Grace. Oh, God.

1134
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,500
We've got to do something.

1135
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,100
Jake!

1136
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,400
My baby!

1137
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,900
I'll get help.

1138
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,100
No, Grace!

1139
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,800
Don't cry, Mavis.

1140
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,900
Doesn't do any good.

1141
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,000
Auntie Matawai?

1142
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,400
It's Beth.

1143
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,100
Ka mata oku tamahine...

1144
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,600
last night.

1145
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,200
I want to bring her home, Auntie.

1146
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,700
Will you come and get us, please?

1147
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,300
Thank you.

1148
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,000
We're going to play spacies.

1149
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,500
Come on, you two.

1150
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,600
Oh, where's Gracie?

1151
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,200
She's having a long sleep.

1152
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,500
No, she's not. Her bed's empty.

1153
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,900
That's enough, Polly. Come on.

1154
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,100
What the fuck's going on here?

1155
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,400
I want us to take Grace back home

1156
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,400
to the Marae.

1157
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,200
This is her fucking home.

1158
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,600
No, it's not.

1159
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,500
This was never her home...

1160
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,200
never.

1161
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,400
And that fucking place is?

1162
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,700
Fucking Maoris who think they're better

1163
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,800
than the rest of us?

1164
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,000
I hate them.

1165
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,100
Bastards living in the fucking past.

1166
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,500
It's our past, too, Jake.

1167
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,200
What's that supposed to mean?

1168
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:09,200
I want Grace to be with her people.

1169
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,800
We should have gone back
a long time ago.

1170
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,900
Fuck off!

1171
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,400
You're not taking her anywhere.

1172
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:19,300
I'm taking her, Jake,
with or without you.

1173
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,900
I wasn't there
when Grace needed me.

1174
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:23,900
This time I'm going to do

1175
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:25,500
the right thing by her,

1176
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,000
and you're not going to stop me.

1177
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,200
You fucking do,

1178
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,100
and I won't be here
when you get back.

1179
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,700
Well, go on, then.

1180
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,500
Go! Get the hell out of here!

1181
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,700
I'm taking her.

1182
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:41,200
I'll kill you first!

1183
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,900
Well, go on. Do it.

1184
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,400
You're still a slave, Jake...

1185
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,500
to your fists, to the drink,

1186
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,600
to yourself.

1187
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,900
Well, go on.

1188
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,800
Kill the bloody lot of us!

1189
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,200
Stay out of my fucking way...

1190
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,500
or I'll kill you.

1191
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,600
You've come home, Grace.
We're home.

1192
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,300
Oh, my baby.

1193
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,700
Am I that much of a bastard, eh?

1194
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,300
You're my mates. You tell me.

1195
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,800
It's not too late
if you want to go to the Tangi.

1196
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,200
We'll drive you.

1197
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,000
Fuck off.

1198
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,200
I'm not going to give them
the satisfaction.

1199
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,300
I was never fucking good enough,

1200
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:02,300
not for their Beth.

1201
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,300
I'll knock her bloody head in.

1202
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,400
Never mind, bro.

1203
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,500
What's the key to her, man?

1204
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,900
You think I was tough on the kid?

1205
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:15,500
Na... it wouldn't have been
just that, mate.

1206
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,900
Bull, what do you think?

1207
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:20,000
You think I was tough on her?

1208
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,500
Fucked if I know, bro.

1209
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:27,300
I'll try and tell you
a story, eh, Gracie?

1210
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:31,000
The story about a young girl

1211
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,900
growing up in this beautiful place.

1212
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,400
She was given an honor.

1213
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,700
She was made Puhi of the Marae.

1214
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,800
The special one.

1215
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,900
Well, you see, the girl fell in love,

1216
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:55,200
as all young people do.

1217
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,200
But you see, the problem was...

1218
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:04,400
the old people
wouldn't agree to the fella.

1219
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,800
The girl, being headstrong,

1220
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:12,600
went with him anyway.

1221
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,500
Her father said she'd be back...

1222
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,400
that when everything
went to hell, she'd be back.

1223
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:26,000
So the girl...
made a promise to herself

1224
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,700
and said she wouldn't.

1225
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:34,700
No matter what, she wouldn't.

1226
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,900
You see, Grace...

1227
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,200
I did know how to keep a promise.

1228
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,200
I did.

1229
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,800
I'm so sorry, Bub.

1230
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,100
I'm so sorry.

1231
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:56,300
I should have been
there for you, sis.

1232
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:02,500
You were always there for us.

1233
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,700
Oh, son.

1234
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,600
Hey, G.

1235
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,000
Best friends... forever.

1236
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,600
Remember?

1237
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,400
That's all I meant. Honest.

1238
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,400
But you were right.

1239
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,500
I'm just a stupid kid

1240
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:49,400
who lives in an old wreck of a car.

1241
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,800
She loved you, man.

1242
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,000
She loved you.

1243
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,300
What's the time?

1244
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,700
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1245
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,500
What's the time? Say, it's 1:00

1246
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,400
Have you ever seen so much piss?

1247
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,600
That's because they love you, man.

1248
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,300
Yeah.

1249
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,700
Yeah. Why not?

1250
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,800
I'm a lovable chap.

1251
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,400
Jake the Muss.

1252
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,600
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1253
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,100
Ohh ohh

1254
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,900
There's Mr. Daddy-Longlegs

1255
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:29,600
Crawling onto the ceiling

1256
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,200
The sun don't shine,
the sun don't shine

1257
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,200
The sun don't shine...

1258
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,200
Where the fuck are you?!

1259
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,600
You bastard!

1260
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,800
Fucking bastard.

1261
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,300
Don't forget your hat, eh, uncle?

1262
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,800
Hey, uncle, did you
get all the ghosts?

1263
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,200
I sure did.

1264
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,000
Got the whole lot of them.

1265
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
You come and stay.
Bring the kids with you.

1266
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,200
We've got a lot of work
to do back home.

1267
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:30,100
And here, too, auntie.

1268
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:32,200
You sort out here first.

1269
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,600
Be strong.

1270
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,400
Good-bye, auntie.

1271
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,600
You made me real proud today, son.

1272
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Me, too, eh, Mum?
I made you proud today.

1273
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,900
You sure did, Bub.

1274
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,300
Well, I suppose I'd better
be taking off, then.

1275
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:18,500
Take off? Where to?

1276
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:21,200
I don't know.
Probably back to my car.

1277
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,500
I like it there.

1278
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:26,400
Well, do you think
you could like it here, with us?

1279
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,200
Because we like having you.

1280
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,400
Don't we, kids?

1281
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,500
Ya!

1282
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,400
Well, whatever you say, Mrs. H.

1283
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:38,500
I mean, if you need me,
that'll be great.

1284
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,400
I do need you.

1285
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,400
Need you all.

1286
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:00,000
Well, we'll say grace.

1287
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,500
Grace!

1288
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,900
Thank you for my family,

1289
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,700
and thank you for the food. Amen.

1290
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,700
Good look, bro.

1291
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,500
Would you like one, bro?

1292
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:35,200
No, thanks, man.
I wear mine on the inside.

1293
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:48,000
Don't you think you should
take the car back, son?

1294
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,100
In the morning.

1295
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,100
Your mates did you proud today.

1296
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,100
There.

1297
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,700
Mrs. H, could you read me
one of G's stories?

1298
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,900
I can't. That's why she reads to me.

1299
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,100
I mean used to.

1300
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,900
Yeah, the one about the Taniwha.

1301
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,200
OK.

1302
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:46,800
What's wrong, Mum?

1303
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:51,400
Toot, put the kids in the car.

1304
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,100
Thanks, bro.

1305
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,700
Same place... same fucking place
same thing happed with me.

1306
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:03,400
Anyway, this fucking ape
comes over to me,

1307
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,600
takes off his shades,
and says the classic line.

1308
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,900
The classic line! Wait for it.

1309
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,100
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

1310
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:14,100
"What the fuck you staring at, man?"

1311
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,800
So I say to him, cool-ass,

1312
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,600
"Well, not you, mate.
Your spunky missis. "

1313
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,900
Trouble is, she was
fucking uglier than him.

1314
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,400
- Then all hell broke loose.
- Old Jimmy, eh?

1315
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:31,400
Hey, you can stay at
my place tonight, mate.

1316
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,100
Yeah, fuck it. Why not?

1317
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,500
Beth! Bully, give the lady a seat.

1318
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,800
You fucking animal.

1319
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,300
What the fuck?

1320
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:46,200
Women and children, eh?
You fucking coward!

1321
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,700
Please, control your
missis there, mate.

1322
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:51,200
Who the fuck do you think you are

1323
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,300
coming in here
mouthing off at my mates?

1324
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,500
Get the fucking hell out of here

1325
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,100
before I kick your bloody head in.

1326
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,100
That's always your
answer, eh, Jake?

1327
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,400
Violence.

1328
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,100
It's bad enough that you did it here,

1329
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,500
but you brought it home with you

1330
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,400
and I damn well let you.

1331
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,900
What the fuck are you on about now?

1332
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:10,600
It was violence
that killed my Grace.

1333
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,200
She didn't have an ounce
of violence in her, Jake,

1334
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,400
but we made damn sure
it was all around her.

1335
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,700
She killed herself!

1336
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:18,000
You bloody bastard!

1337
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,200
It was your bloody mate

1338
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,800
who handed her the rope!

1339
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,000
Hey, I don't have a clue
what you're on about.

1340
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,600
- You fucking child...
- Shut up, Nig!

1341
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,600
You animal.

1342
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,100
You raped a 13-year-old girl,

1343
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,100
then sat here drinking
with her father

1344
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:35,000
while the rest of us buried her.

1345
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,600
She's off her fucking head, man.

1346
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,000
Sneaking around my house

1347
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,600
and laying your dirty, filthy,

1348
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,500
fucking hands on my baby!

1349
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,400
My Grace!

1350
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,900
Hey, you're not
on the fucking Marae now,

1351
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,200
so don't come in here
accusing my mates of shit!

1352
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,400
Hey, come on, man.

1353
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,900
Look, no one's thinking straight.

1354
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,400
We're family. Right?

1355
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,600
Beth. Sit down. Have a drink.

1356
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,600
I won't drink with
you fucking animals!

1357
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,500
Read it.

1358
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:25,700
Uncle Bully.

1359
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,800
Uncle fucking Bully!

1360
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,600
Let's go, son.

1361
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,000
You dumb bastard, Bully!

1362
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:38,800
Fuck you, Beth. Where are you going?

1363
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,100
I found something better, Jake,

1364
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:50,300
and I'm going to make damn sure
my kids have it all.

1365
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:51,900
From now on,

1366
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:55,200
I make the decisions for my family.

1367
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,700
Fuck off, then!

1368
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,600
You'll get nothing from me.

1369
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,200
You've got nothing I want.

1370
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:06,200
Our people once were warriors,

1371
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,300
but not like you, Jake.

1372
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:13,100
They were a people
with mana, pride.

1373
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,600
People with spirit.

1374
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,100
If my spirit can survive

1375
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,400
living with you for 18 years,

1376
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,100
then I can survive anything.

1377
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,800
Maybe you taught me that.

1378
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,800
Oh, you are fucked, lady!
Really fucked!

1379
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:35,000
You think I need you
and your fucking spirit?

1380
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,900
Fuck off! Go on, go!

1381
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:39,800
I don't want you, ever!

1382
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,100
I'll knock your fucking head off!

1383
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:46,000
Fuck you! You'll be back.

1384
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,700
Fuck this warrior shit.

1385
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:50,000
You'll be back!

1386
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,600
Fuck you, Beth!

1387
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,700
Do you hear me, Beth?!

1388
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,300
Fuck you!

1389
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,800
Where are we going, Mum?

1390
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,200
We're going home.

1391
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:10,600
Oh, fuck all that
fucking warrior shit!

1392
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:14,600
You'll be back! You'll fucking see.

1393
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,600
You'll need me!
You'll fucking want me!

1394
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,700
You'll be back. Fuck you, Beth!
