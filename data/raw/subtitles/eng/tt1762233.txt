1
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,882
Water.

2
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,676
Falling on a city.

3
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,686
The sound of nature
all around us.

4
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,785
Listen to what
the rain has to say.

5
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,958
Follow it up to the clouds

6
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,095
that sweep across
the turning earth.

7
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,769
Far, far away.

8
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,436
To find a land

9
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:29,359
where water
shapes all life.

10
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,284
Where nature still holds sway.

11
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,825
Africa!

12
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,999
Realms of fire and ice.

13
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,210
Water and wind.

14
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,876
Heat and dust.

15
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,016
Worlds within worlds.

16
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,353
Where we can be swept
back into nature.

17
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,741
The rainforest.

18
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,253
The very heart
of this vast continent.

19
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,050
The wettest place in Africa.

20
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:44,066
What lies hidden beneath
this dense canopy of green?

21
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,515
The mysterious forest.

22
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,955
With so much sun and rain,

23
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,497
it grows relentlessly.

24
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,418
And all around
the tangled forest

25
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,009
is the noise
of numberless creatures.

26
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,807
More animals live here

27
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,094
than in any other realm.

28
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,763
But they're hard to find.

29
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,549
Hardly any light gets through.

30
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,301
And down here,
on the forest floor,

31
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,555
a leaderless army
of blind ants

32
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,340
is on the move.

33
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,898
Driver ants.

34
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,697
A swarm, five million strong.

35
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,913
You don't want to get
in their way.

36
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,174
They eat everything
in their path.

37
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,390
These tiny ants
can overcome creatures

38
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,055
thousands of times bigger
than them.

39
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,657
It's war.

40
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,990
Animal devouring animal
in the darkness.

41
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,165
While plants struggle desperately
with each other

42
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,826
to reach the light.

43
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,252
Life here can be
a constant struggle.

44
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,674
But it's only a short walk
to paradise.

45
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,887
In a glade in the forest,

46
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,644
a family rests in the sun.

47
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,937
Gorillas.

48
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,450
Some of our closest relatives.

49
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,161
Just like us,
they live in families.

50
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,252
Mothers and children,
uncles and aunts.

51
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,844
The big silverback -
he's in charge.

52
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,143
He keeps an eye on everyone.

53
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,231
For this family,

54
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,447
the forest is really
the Garden of Eden.

55
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,869
All the food they need
is within easy reach.

56
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,485
They play,
they talk, they quarrel,

57
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,200
they learn
and make friends for life.

58
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,162
It's an idyllic place
to grow up.

59
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,121
This is their world.

60
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,954
They are really
comfortable here.

61
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,963
And if anything
threatens the peace...

62
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,301
...the silverback is ready
to protect his family.

63
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,181
Rain and sun
made this rich forest.

64
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,892
But in the world beyond,

65
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,775
another very different realm
is being forged

66
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,904
by a far more brutal clash
of the elements.

67
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,984
The underworld.

68
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,135
The heart of a volcano.

69
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,763
A fiery furnace.

70
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,676
Where rocks melt
before your eyes

71
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,937
at temperatures
of a thousand degrees.

72
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,730
You're seeing
the earth stretch open.

73
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,317
When our planet
was first formed,

74
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,532
the whole world
was like this.

75
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,375
Underground,
the furnace still burns,

76
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,791
making new land every day.

77
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:29,643
A world built from sulfur and salt
belched from below.

78
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,736
Like an alien planet.

79
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,705
Acid pools and choking gases.

80
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,587
You can't even
breathe the air.

81
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,802
Almost nothing can live here.

82
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,642
But sometimes,
in the realm of the volcanoes,

83
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:08,432
the fires breed life
out of the poisoned water.

84
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,120
Lake Bogoria,

85
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,452
where boiling springs
from the underworld

86
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,289
spill into a vast lake.

87
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,418
These waters are far saltier
than the sea,

88
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,210
yet they draw life
from hundreds of miles away.

89
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,558
Flamingos.

90
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,181
'Flame' birds.

91
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,627
Occasionally, when the water conditions
are just right,

92
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,385
the lake blooms
with masses of tiny algae.

93
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,264
A delicacy for the flamingos.

94
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,747
Their food contains
a red pigment,

95
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,786
so the more they sip,
the pinker they glow...

96
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,584
...as if they're blushing.

97
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,939
Now, the more they blush,
the more desirable they become.

98
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,561
And when they're all
looking beautiful...

99
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,156
..they start to dance.

100
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,711
# You

101
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,921
# You and me

102
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:29,348
# You
# You

103
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:37,483
# You and me. #

104
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:46,066
Enflamed by the waters
of the volcanic lake,

105
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,736
they seek out partners
in the crowd.

106
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:57,251
Who will choose who
in this great gathering?

107
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,505
Somewhere out there
is the perfect match.

108
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,347
Out of the fires...

109
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,133
...comes love.

110
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,971
Flamingos mate for life.

111
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,497
They are leaving
the bubbling lake

112
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,792
to find a place to nest.

113
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,235
Soon they'll be gone,
the lake empty for another year.

114
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,322
But there are realms
in Africa so dry,

115
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,454
they seem permanently empty.

116
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,884
The Namib Desert.

117
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,725
It's been here
for over 50 million years.

118
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:09,023
One of the oldest, hottest,
driest places on earth.

119
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,776
A great sea of sand

120
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,192
as restless as the ocean.

121
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:01,200
How can anything survive
in this wasteland?

122
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,073
But some do.

123
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,497
Millions of years have taught them
the necessary tricks.

124
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,130
A desert viper,

125
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:19,923
side-winding to get a grip
on the loose sand.

126
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,841
Food's hard to find,

127
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,555
so the viper hides

128
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,312
and waits for it
to come to him.

129
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,069
If you're going to hunt
for a meal...

130
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,323
...it helps if you have eyes
in the back of your head.

131
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,922
Meet the Namaqua chameleon.

132
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,108
He sets his sights
on an armoured ground cricket.

133
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,506
His eyes are bigger
than his stomach.

134
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,728
Better try again
for a lighter lunch.

135
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,048
Delicious.

136
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,924
In the middle of the day,

137
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:50,057
the sand is so hot,
most creatures can't stand it.

138
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,565
This little lizard's
no bigger than your little finger

139
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:02,774
and to stop his feet burning,
he's got to dance.

140
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,072
The shovel-snouted lizard
can handle the heat,

141
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:59,369
but all that dancing
works up an appetite.

142
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,458
He'd better be careful, though.

143
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,918
Not everything here
is what it seems.

144
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,664
Tempting-

145
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,298
But is it safe?

146
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,065
That was too close.

147
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,481
Time for a vanishing act.

148
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,453
With so little moisture
in the dunes,

149
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,115
there's only
a sprinkling of life,

150
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,454
and all of it's small.

151
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,622
But if there's rain,
even a little,

152
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:30,133
the water can change
the whole character of a place.

153
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:46,810
East of Namib lies the realm
of the scorched plains.

154
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,280
Water occasionally
softens the earth,

155
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:59,367
but now the land
is bone dry.

156
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,299
It's a desperate time
for elephants.

157
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,715
They have to drink more than
any other animal on earth.

158
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,062
To find enough water

159
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,598
at this time of year,

160
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,186
the family must trek

161
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,147
huge distances.

162
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,444
The smallest
just have to keep up.

163
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:47,169
This is a family of females
with their young.

164
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,755
One mother is in charge.

165
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,591
She has an incredible memory.

166
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,472
She can remember
the few places

167
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,599
where there might
still be water.

168
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:35,209
They can't afford to rest
until they find a drink.

169
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,424
They must push on
through the night.

170
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,634
It's a dangerous time.

171
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,803
There are hunters about.

172
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:54,563
Leopards, hyenas, lions.

173
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,449
To keep their babies safe,

174
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,536
the family
needs to stick together.

175
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,982
Another family nearby
have not been so careful.

176
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,538
This youngster
has strayed too far.

177
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,991
Our family has survived.

178
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,583
The mothers were wise
to keep their babies close.

179
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:40,384
Together
their search continues.

180
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,918
Water at last.

181
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,500
The mother has led them
to a special place

182
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,882
where there's water
underground.

183
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,677
To reach it,

184
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,133
the elephants have dug wells

185
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,674
with their feet and tusks.

186
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:42,358
Some of them are pretty deep,

187
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,944
so the longer your trunk,
the better.

188
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,055
A few mouthfuls
can make all the difference.

189
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,392
Especially when you're small.

190
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,803
Thirsty bulls barging in
for a drink.

191
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,415
Fortunately,
the family's drunk enough

192
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:30,088
and the mother knows somewhere
nearby where they can all relax.

193
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:40,811
Too dirty to drink,
but perfect for a mud bath.

194
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:07,666
A quick cool-off,
a splash of the muddy sunscreen

195
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,961
and it's time
to move on again

196
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,927
to find food
and more fresh water.

197
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,934
Someone needs
a bit of help.

198
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,700
Generations of elephants

199
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,986
have gone on journeys like this
and survived,

200
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,622
passing on their knowledge
and their courage.

201
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,333
They'll keep on travelling.

202
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:46,292
Always on the move,
always thirsty...

203
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,424
...until the rains arrive.

204
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:15,276
Fresh water is what brings
the dry kingdoms of Africa to life.

205
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:22,954
These fingers of mist
don't promise healing showers,

206
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:27,121
but they beckon us towards
another magical realm...

207
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,250
...just beyond these sands.

208
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,090
The sea.

209
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,719
An eternal, restless empire

210
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,934
at the boundaries
of what we know.

211
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,689
Battering the shoreline
of Africa

212
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,945
from all points
of the compass.

213
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,623
Barracuda.

214
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,750
Cruising in a shoal.

215
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,551
They seem to sense
the path to take.

216
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,484
The traffic of the deep.

217
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,567
Ocean travellers,
moving as one

218
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,279
towards a wonderful creation
of the sea.

219
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:08,411
The most vibrant
of all Africa's realms.

220
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,086
A coral reef.

221
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,384
Reefs can only grow
at the perfect temperature,

222
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,217
at the perfect depth
and with plenty of sunshine.

223
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,052
So they're rare.

224
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,852
But when it all comes together,

225
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,858
you get this.

226
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,446
A crowded city under the sea.

227
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,557
A hawksbill turtle
looking for food.

228
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,900
Like any human city,

229
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,660
there are lots of
different places to live.

230
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,040
And being so crowded,

231
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,042
it pays to get along
with the neighbours.

232
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:08,007
A quarter of all life in the sea
lives on coral reefs.

233
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,561
It may be beautiful,

234
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,063
but don't let
the bright colours dazzle you.

235
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:24,937
Like most cities,
the reef has its darker side.

236
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,982
When you leave
the light behind,

237
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,446
you never know
quite what you'll find.

238
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:05,944
These sweeper fish
like to shelter in caves.

239
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,902
But they seem pretty spooked.

240
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,932
A gang of lionfish
on the prowl.

241
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,488
Beautiful, but deadly.

242
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,341
Their spines
are highly poisonous.

243
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:21,390
And the stripes warn others
not to mess with them.

244
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,018
Lionfish use
their outstretched fins

245
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:32,109
to corner their prey
against the walls.

246
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:34,049
Sunbeams pierce the depths

247
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,802
direct from the heavens.

248
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,851
Ride them to a kingdom
in the sky...

249
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,271
...among a sea of clouds

250
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,683
to reach the top
of the world.

251
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,926
A realm of ice and snow,
right on the equator.

252
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:25,431
Mount Kenya,
towering over three miles high.

253
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,694
Hidden among
these snow-capped peaks

254
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,322
is a secret world
of strange plants.

255
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,234
# Carry me
Oh, carry me

256
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,154
# Oh, strong wind, carry me

257
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,663
# Through the misty cloud

258
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,415
# Through
the misty cloud

259
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,575
# Through the misty cloud... #

260
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:41,302
Life up here
beats to a magical rhythm.

261
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,589
# On the road to the mountain

262
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,481
# Through the valley
and the stars

263
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,510
# You'll find me there

264
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,797
# Sittin' in the starry sky

265
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,591
# Thinkin' on the reasons why

266
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,805
# I'll be here forever... #

267
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:38,726
As night falls,
temperatures plunge.

268
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:45,359
And this whole place
becomes a crystal kingdom.

269
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,865
# You'll find me there

270
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,656
# Sittin' in the starry sky

271
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,951
# Thinkin' on the reasons why

272
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,495
# I'll be here forever

273
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,460
# You'll find me there

274
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,376
# Sittin' in the starry sky

275
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,091
# Thinkin' on the reasons why

276
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,130
# I'll be here forever

277
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,924
# I'll be here
forever

278
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,263
# You'll find me there

279
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,895
# Dancin' in the starry sky

280
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,058
# Thinkin' on the reasons why

281
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,318
# I'll be here forever... #

282
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,023
To avoid freezing,

283
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:26,487
the plants wrap themselves
in a blanket of leaves.

284
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,994
Like snuggling under a duvet.

285
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:55,432
As they sleep, everything
around them turns to ice.

286
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,341
It's winter every night.

287
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:59,584
# Oh, when love comes

288
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:04,794
# There's nothing
we can't do... #

289
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:09,552
Each morning, the sun brings
the mountains back to life.

290
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,465
# When love comes

291
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,977
# We'll find another day... #

292
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,139
It's summer every day.

293
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:26,812
# Oh, when love comes

294
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,605
# There's nothing

295
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:34,152
# We can't do

296
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,912
IOh

297
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:40,917
# When love comes

298
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:44,705
# We'll find out... #

299
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,918
IOh

300
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:54,680
# When love comes

301
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:01,517
# There's nothing
we can't do. #

302
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:15,238
Across the highlands,
everyone's waking up.

303
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,447
Geladas.

304
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:25,165
They live only up here,
in the mountains of Ethiopia.

305
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:30,875
Woken by a touch of the sun,

306
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,636
as has been the way
for millions of years.

307
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,866
Their luxuriant fur
has kept them warm at night,

308
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:07,912
but needs a lot of attention
to keep it clean.

309
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:29,270
Pwoah!

310
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,724
Life up here
is all about simple routine.

311
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,887
Easy days
beneath the eternal sky.

312
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:23,200
As the day heats up,
everyone heads off to find food.

313
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,866
Families join up
in their hundreds,

314
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,251
searching for the best grass.

315
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,761
With so many monkeys together,

316
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,922
things sometimes
get a bit out of hand.

317
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,484
Most of the time,
no-one comes to any harm.

318
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,944
It's just the males
showing off.

319
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,285
All part of the daily routine.

320
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,920
As the day ends,

321
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,501
it's time
to find somewhere to sleep

322
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,541
and huddle from the cold.

323
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,257
The same as every night

324
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,013
they can ever remember.

325
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,599
Winter, then summer.

326
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,860
Summer, then winter.

327
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,112
Like a whole year in a day.

328
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:24,863
On and on...forever.

329
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,269
From a land where each day
and each night

330
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,854
are the same as those before

331
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,692
comes a world
of constant change.

332
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,006
This is how rivers are born.

333
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:25,135
Drop follows drip
follows drop,

334
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:29,639
a trickle that becomes a flow
and then a stream.

335
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:37,014
And then it goes on and on.

336
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,182
Always downhill.

337
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,398
Always looking
for the lowest level.

338
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,631
Africa's rivers create
a mercurial realm

339
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,591
of great highways.

340
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:15,220
Legends like the Nile,
Congo, Zambezi.

341
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,413
Victoria Falls.

342
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,173
The smoke that thunders!

343
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,819
Even the wildest rivers
calm down eventually.

344
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,990
This place
might look peaceful,

345
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,875
but don't be fooled.

346
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:25,659
Wildebeest.

347
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:29,420
Always on the move
looking for fresh grass.

348
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,800
But they have to stop to drink.

349
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:38,156
This is the closest thing
to a dragon you'll ever see.

350
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,332
The biggest crocodiles
in Africa.

351
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,623
Some weigh over a tonne.

352
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,552
Monsters like these
have been around

353
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,930
since the time
of the dinosaurs.

354
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:08,058
They have the most powerful jaws
of any animal on earth.

355
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,912
It's been almost a year
since these crocs last ate

356
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:10,290
and there's no guarantee
the herds will come back.

357
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:20,045
Even if they do,
they might drink elsewhere.

358
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,882
It's a long and winding river.

359
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:38,436
But if there's one thing
crocodiles are good at...

360
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,404
...it's being patient.

361
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:53,621
The wildebeest have to drink
eventually.

362
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:23,221
Even the biggest crocs in Africa
can't stop them all.

363
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,097
They have to keep moving

364
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:28,107
to find a place

365
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,360
where there's fresh grass.

366
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:33,863
That means chasing the rain.

367
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,122
It's hard to predict

368
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,500
when the rain will come
to the savanna,

369
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,127
but the animals seem to know.

370
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,832
They follow the clouds.

371
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:16,277
And they come into a world
being created anew.

372
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,488
A world at the tipping point.

373
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:35,712
The sun and the rain,
the light and the water...

374
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,086
...have come with a miracle.

375
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,342
A transformation.

376
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:22,212
Rain brings the world
into flower.

377
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:26,679
And every living thing
blossoms too.

378
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,772
Something extraordinary
is about to happen.

379
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,225
Africa.

380
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,391
Bursting into life again.

381
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:42,599
A happy ending after
so many difficult journeys.

382
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,203
The long search for water
is over

383
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:41,241
and there is joy in the world
once more.

384
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:45,287
Endless delight
in being alive.

385
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:00,889
# There's a wild wind blowing

386
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:04,601
# Down the corner of my street

387
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:10,441
# Every night there
the headlights are glowing

388
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:15,491
# There's a cold war coming

389
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:20,155
# On the radio I heard

390
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:25,669
# Baby, it's a violent world

391
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:32,717
# Oh, love, don't let me go

392
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:40,050
# Won't you take me
where the streetlights glow?

393
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:44,804
# I can hear it coming

394
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,395
# I can hear
the sirens sound

395
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:54,860
# Now my feet
won't touch the ground... #

396
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:03,665
We can be swept back
into nature

397
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:06,041
and feel the joy of it...

398
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,670
...if we let the world
show us the way.

399
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:14,208
# Time came a-creepin'

400
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:17,754
# Oh, and time's a loaded gun

401
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:24,223
# Every road is a ray of light

402
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:29,224
# It goes on

403
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:32,519
# Time will leak
and lead you on

404
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:39,489
# Still, it's such
a beautiful night

405
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,368
# Oh, love

406
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:46,033
# Don't let me go

407
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:53,252
# Won't you take me where
the streetlights glow?

408
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:57,923
# I can hear it coming

409
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:01,635
# Like a serenade of sound

410
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:07,850
# Now my feet
won't touch the ground... #

411
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:17,317
The natural world
is so powerful,

412
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,822
so enchanting,

413
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:20,324
that even here,

414
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,735
even in the city,

415
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:26,030
we can be
swept back into nature.

416
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,621
It's all around us.

417
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,713
And in every one of us.
