00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,208
like as if he can tell me

192
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,208
what I can do!

193
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,333
- Like, I mean, like, it sounds

194
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,333

195
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,166

197
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,750
that you guys gotta work out.

198
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,500
- Whose side are you on?

199
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,000
- I'm with you, girl,

200
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm with you. Keep going.

201
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,958
- All I said was that

202
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,958
he's a nice guy...

204
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,916

205
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,916
<i>when I told my dad about a trip</i>

206
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,916
<i>I was taking.</i>

207
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,375
- Oh, by the way,

208
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,416
I've decided to take

209
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,416
a trip to Africa.

210
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,416
- "By the way?" That's it?

211
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,625
- I need inspiration.

212
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,625
- For what? (Laughs)

213
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,625
- No offense Dad, but I didn't

214
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,625
go to art school

215
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,208
so that I could work

216
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,208
in your hardware store.

217
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,916
- One day Johnson's Hardware

218

Store is gonna be all yours.

219
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,791
Think about that.

220
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,541
- I wanna be an artist.

221
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,875
- No one's saying you can't

222
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,875
do your art.

223
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,958
But I don't see how art's going

224
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,958

225
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,166
- Baby, do you think that

226
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,166
going to Africa

227
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,375
is going to give you

228
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,375
inspiration?

229
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,041
- Yes, I do, Grandma.

230
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,416
- Then I think it's a great

231
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,416
idea.

232
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,416
- So, how long are you

233
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,416
going for?

234
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,750
- Um, she's not going.

235
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,416
- Three weeks.

236
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,250
- Did you hear what I just said?

237
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,041
- Well, it's too late, 'cause

238
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,041
I already bought my ticket.

239
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,541
I leave next Friday.

240
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,125
- You're not going.

241
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,125
- Why not?

242
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,833
- A young woman traveling alone,

243
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,500
I mean, anything could happen!

244
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,083
- You're just upset because I

245
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,083
didn't ask you first.

246
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,000
- That's right, you should've

247
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,000
asked me first!

248
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,750
- What's the point of asking

249
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,750
you, if I already know

250
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,541
What you're gonna say?!

251
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,541
- Because you don't make

252
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,250
those kinds of decisions

253
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,250
without talking about it!

254
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,208
- Okay, whoa, whoa, girl,

255
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,208
you need to just calm down

256
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,041
for a second, all right?

257
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,041
You should chill out.

258
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,041
You need to have a heart

259
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,041
to heart with your father.

260
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,958
- You don't have a heart

261
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,958
to heart with my father.

262
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,541
He dictates, and you listen.

263
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,708
- Well, just... keep going,

264
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,708
what happened next?

265
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,125
- Well, I'm going,

266
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,125

267
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,250

00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,375
I met when I first got here?

380
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,000
- I do.

381
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,000
- Well...

382
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,208
we're getting married.

383
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,625
- What-w-w-what do you mean,

384
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,625
getting married?

385
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,125
- Mtumbie asked me

386
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,125
to marry him!

387
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,166
- Who the hell's Mtumbie?

388
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,750
- I've been talking about him

389
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,750
the entire time I've been here.

390
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,666
- He's the nice man that

391
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,666
was taking her around,

392
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,125
showing her the sights,

393
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,125
remember?

394
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,125
- Dad, when you meet him,

395
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,125
you will love him.

396
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,958
Ed: Look Maya,

397
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,958
I was young once.

398
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,208
I-I know what it's like.

399
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,291
You go off to some far off

400
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,291
exotic country,

401
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,000
and everything seems new

402
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,000
and exciting.

403
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,375
But trust me,

404
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,375
it ain't gonna last.

405
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,041
- Ed!

406
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,875
- Well, first of all, this

407
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,875
is not some spring break fling,

408
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,750
and secondly,

409
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,750
we're getting married,

410
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,500
like it, or not.

411
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,833
- (Laughs) You're pulling

412
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,833
my leg, right?

413
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,000
- I'll take that as your way

414
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,000
of saying congratulations.

415
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,708
- Let me-let me get

416
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,708
this straight.

417
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,125
This guy is uh, this guy

418
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,125
is African, right?

419
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,000
- Yeah, do you have

420
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,000
a problem with that?

421
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,708
- N-no, I'm just trying

422
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,708
to get the big picture.

423
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,708
- I thought you wanted me

424
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,708
to settle down,

425
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,500
and get married.

426
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,500
- What's really happening here?

427
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,375
This guy, he needs a green

428
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,375
card, or something?

429
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,041
- Okay, for your information,

430
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,041
he is very wealthy,

431
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,250
and he certainly does not need

432
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,250
any green card!

433
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,291
- You're not getting married,

434
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,291
and that's all I have to say.

435
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,666
- Well, it's my decision

436
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,666
to make,

437
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,750
and we're getting married,

438
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,750
like it or not!

439
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,541
- I want you to get on the next

440
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,541
plane, and come home,

441
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,208
and I don't want to hear

442
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,208
any more about it!

443
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,541
- I will come home when

444
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,541
I'm good and ready!

445
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,375
Clara: Maya, listen,

446
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,375
your father means well.

447
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,916
It's just that he's surprised

448
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,916
by this news, that's all, and--

449
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,250
- And-and another thing is,

450
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,250
as long as you're under my roof

451
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,166
you're gonna do what I say,

452
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,166
when I say it and that's--

453
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,958
- Oh! (Scoffs)

454
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,291
(Dial tone sounds)

455
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,291
- What?

456
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,791
- Wow, so what'd your mom

457
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,791
have to say about it?

458
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,166
- Um, she passed away

459
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,166
when I was twelve.

460
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,458
- Oh... uh, I'm sorry

461
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,458
to hear that.

462
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,291
- But I have an aunt

463
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,291
who's like a mom,

464
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,375
and she is all for it.

465
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,833
So I went to Mtumbie

466
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,833
to cry on his shoulder...

467
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,125
Mtumbie?

468
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,125

Mtumbie: Ohhh!

471
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,583
- Mtumbie?

472
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,291
(Mtumbie gasps)

473
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,833
- Qui est elle?

474
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,833
- Oh! Uh...

475
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,166
- (Gasps)

476
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,208
- Ooh! Damn!

477
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,791
I mean, sorry.

478
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,625
Mtumbie: Maya, wait!

479
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,583
Let me explain,

480
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,583
she doesn't speak English,

481
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,541
There was a misunderstanding!

482
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,625
She doesn't understand

483
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,625
the word no!

484
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,708

advantage of me?

he's coming...

543
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,333

- Mhmm.

business to finish,

548
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,541

that you called it off?

557
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,250

the satisfaction

out one way or another.

00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,375
(Door bell jingles)

569
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,333
Wow.

570
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,125
- Someone ripped us off!

571
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,125
- What?

572
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,958
- Someone broke into

573
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,958
our hotel room,

574
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,666
and stole my damn boots!

575
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,500
- Uh, hold on, you got beat

576
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,500
for a pair of boots?

577
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,375
- That's where I stashed

578
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,375
the cash!

579
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,958
- I thought you were

580
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,958
in the room the whole time.

581
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,166
Huh?

582
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,166
- I was sleeping.

583
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,000
- You were sleeping?

584
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,000
- Yeah.

585
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,000
- Like a baby?

586
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,000
- Where the hell were you?

587
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,375
- What are you, five years old?

588
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,666
- What is--

589
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,666
- Hey!

590
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,375
- Thank you for what you did.

591
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,250
When my husband told me,

592
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,250
I couldn't believe it.

593
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,083
You're a saint.

594
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,375
- Eh, listen, I don't know what

595
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,375
you're talking about, woman.

596
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,458
You have yourself a good day,

597
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,458
okay? Thank you.

598
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,125
- From the pool hall,

599
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,125
yesterday.

600
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,416
- Uh-ah-ah! Uh uh uh!

601
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,416
- Hmm?

602
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,875
- You know what,

603
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,875
hey, you tripping.

604
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,750
Okay, you should go on

605
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,750
about your business,

606
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,166
or I'm gonna call the police.

607
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,333
- Okay...

608
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,333
- Yes, now, thank you.

609
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,666
- So what is it that you do

610
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,666
for Farmer Brown

611
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,000
that she's not gonna forget?

612
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,416
- (Nervous chuckle) Man...

613
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,166
Oh, come on, Ty,

614
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,166
you know she's like,

615
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,208
the girl is crazy.

616
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,083
Have some coffee, relax.

617
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,666
- Are you nuts? Huh?

618
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,666
That was my money!

619
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,875
My money!

620
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,875
- Listen to me, all right--

621
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,416
- I saved over three grand

622
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,416
in that damn boot!

623
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,041
- Look, we'll get it back,

624
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,041
okay?

625
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,375
It's not that big of a deal.

626
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,958
- (Laughs humourlessly)

627
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,708
- Hey Ty, Ty.

628
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,708
- Not that big of a deal...

629
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,250
- Ty, where you going, man?

630
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,250
Hey Ty, come on, where you--

631
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,125
- You're a dead man.

632
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,666
You're a dead man, Malcolm.

633
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,541
(Door slams)

634
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,083
- Oh my God.

635
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,833
(Blinds rattle)

636
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,250
Oh no!

637
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,125
(Panicked breathing) Oh!

638
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,041
Oh shit.

639
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,958
(Dishes clink)

640
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,916
Oh! Come on!

641
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,958
(Dishes clatter)

642
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,250
- Where'd he go?

643
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,250
Where's the back door?

644
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,541
Waiter: I don't want

645
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,541
any trouble,

646
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,083
I don't want to call

647
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,083
the police.

648
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,916
- Where's the back door?

649
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,916
- Through the kitchen.

650
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,458
- Oof! Ohhh...

651
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,000
(Coughs)

652
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,875
(Gas pump rattles)

653
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,833
(Malcolm pants heavily)

654
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,000
(Rustles)

655
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,166
(Gasping for breath)

656
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,708
Maya: Here you go.

657
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,083
(Footsteps thud)

658
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,708
(Truck door slams)

659
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,625
(Keys jingle)

660
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,166
(Engine turns)

661
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,166
- Hey!

662
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,541
(Engine rumbles)

663
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,541
Hey!

664
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,500
(Truck roars)

665
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,125
(Car engine roars)

666
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,291
(Thumping sound)

667
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,291
Malcolm: Ow!

668
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,208
- Oh my God! Aah! Aah!

669
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,208
- Hey, hey, shh!

670
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,916
Shh, shh, shh! It's me,

671
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,916
it's me, from the diner.

672
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,708
- What are you doing

673
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,708
in my truck?!

674
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,375
- Just don't stop,

675
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,375
I will explain later,

676
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,416
just keep on driving, okay?

677
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,416
- Okay, you can have my truck,

678
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,833
and there's money in my wallet,

679
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,833
just please don't hurt me!

680
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,500
- I don't want your money,

681
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,500
I don't want your truck!

682
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,541
Just please,

683
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,541
don't slow down, okay?

684
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,041
If he catches up to us,

685
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,041
I'm a dead man, okay?

686
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,666
- If who catches up to us?

687
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,666
- The guy in the orange car

688
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,666
behind us.

689
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,333
(Car rumbles)

690
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,666
He's got a gun,

691
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,666
and he's after me!

692
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,500
- Wait, why-why is he

693
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,500
after you?

694
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,916
- Because he thinks I stole

695
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,916
his money.

696
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,083
- What-what? Did you?

697
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,083
- No! No.

698
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,750
Gosh!

699
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,833
Sort of. Sort of, sort of.

700
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,833
- What do you mean, sort of?

701
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,375
Just keep talkin'!

702
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,375
- Okay look,

703
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,333
I met him at a pool hall

704
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,333
in Montreal,

705
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,083
and we were both headed west,

706
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,083
that's it.

707
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,708
- Wait, you're Canadian?

708
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,708
You don't sound Canadian!

709
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,708
- I was born in Montreal,

710
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,708
raised in Jersey,

711
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,291
he's Canadian too, all right?

712
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,291
- Oh, so a Canadian

713
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,125
with a gun is after you?

714
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,125
No, that does not sound right.

715
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,333
- We're just a bunch

716
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,333
of pool hustlers!

717
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,250
- You're a pool hustler?

718
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,250
- It's a long story,

719
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,791
but please,

720
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,791
you've gotta help me!

721
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,166
- Why should I?

722
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,166
- Why should you?

723
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,375
(Laughs) I mean, he's only

724
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,375
got a gun, right?

725
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,833
Sure, no big deal.

726
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,541
(Gasps) What if I helped

727
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,541
with your problem?

728
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,041
- What problem?

729
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,041
What're you talking about?

730
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,583
- Your folks think your

731
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,583
fiancee's coming.

732
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,833
And we both know that ain't

733
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,833
gonna happen, hm?

734
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,416
- Are you saying what I think

735
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,416
that you're saying?

736
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,416
- Yes! I'm your man!

737
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,208
- Okay, my fiancee is African.

738
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,000
- Yeah, but where do you think

739
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,000
the "African"

740
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,375
in "African-American"

741
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,375
comes from, huh?

742
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,500
Hm, now I got you thinking.

743
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,000
- (Sighs) Okay, hold on.

744
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,416
(Engine roars)

745
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,291
(Truck whooshes by)

746
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,458
(Tires squeal)

747
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,916
(Truck accelerates loudly)

748
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,541
(Birds chirp)

749
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,833
(Car rumbles)

750
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,250
(Rumble fades away)

751
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,875
(Plane rumbles)

752
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,625
(Passengers chatter)

753
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,541
- Honey, don't be so nervous.

754
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,375
You look beautiful.

755
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,500
(Maya sighs)

756
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,333
(Passengers chatter)

757
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,541
- Oh God, I'm such an idiot.

758
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,500
Why don't I learn?

759
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,666
- Honey, I don't think

760
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,666
there's anyone left.

761
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,333
Maybe he missed his flight.

762
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,916
- Maybe he's come

763
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,916
to his senses.

764
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,125
- Ed, I mean it.

765
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,166
- Well look, he's not here,

766
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,166
is he?

767
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,875
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

768
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,250
- Well, that's the first

769
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,250
sensible thing you've said

770
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,916
since you reached puberty.

771
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,000
- (Sighs) Aunt Clara,

772
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,000
there's something I should...

773
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,416
probably tell you.

774
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,000
- I uh...

775
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,000
- Uhmbowa tomobmba!

776
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,166
It is I...

777
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,500
Mtumbie,

778
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,500
your future son in-law.

779
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,291
- Oh!

780
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,291
- This is for you.

781
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,083
- For me?

782
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,083
- Yes, open it, please.

783
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,833
- Oh, okay, um...

784
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,833
uh... um, a spoon!

785
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,500
- Yes.

786
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,500
- Yes, no problem.

787
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,083
Oh my goodness!

788
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,083
Oh you are so beautiful, huh?

789
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,666
- Oh, thank you!

790
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,500
You are making my heart beat

791
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,500
like African drum.

792
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,208
- Oh, thank you.

793
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,208
- I see where beauty runs

794
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,958
in the family, Maya.

795
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,958
My goodness! (Laughs)

796
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,833
Wow, is this the-- yes!

797
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,625
King Lion, come here.

798
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,625
- Ah, it's okay.

799
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,416
- Oh, good meeting you.

800
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,416
- Yeah.

801
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,666
It is an honour to meet you,

802
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,666
sir.

803
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,666
- I'm sure it is.

804
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,208
- What are you waiting for,

805
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,208
go to him!

806
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,291
- Hi, baby. Hi.

807
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,291
- Hi!

808
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:04,625
- Mm. Mm. Mm.

809
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:04,625
(Clara gasps)

810
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,000
Mm. Mm. Ah.

811
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,000
Ooh, strawberries.

812
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,500
- (Laughs uncomfortably)

813
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,500
Um...

814
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,625
look at her, she's speechless!

815
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,666
- Well, that's a first.

816
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,666
- Ed, get--

817
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,458
Come, come.

818
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,791
- Get a room.

819
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,791
- Oh! Come!

820
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,208
- Coming, coming.

821
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,416
- Ed!

822
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,166
Grandma Rose: Hello!

823
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,166
Malcolm: Oh!

824
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,416
- Welcome.

825
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,416
- Oh, thank you.

826
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,916
Maya: This is my Grandma Rose.

827
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,333
- Oh! It is so nice

828
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,333
to meet you.

829
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,041
- Well, it's so nice

830
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,041
to meet you.

831
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,666
(Both laugh)

832
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,333
- Wow. Wow...

833
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,791
Clara: So, Mtumbie, I know

834
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,791
you must be exhausted

835
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,250
from that long trip,

836
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,458
and we've got a spare room

837
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,458
for you upstairs.

838
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,000
- Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

839
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,666
So let's go get you

840
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,666
set up upstairs.

841
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,708
- Uh, wait, um...

842
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,250
if you're not too tired,

843
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,250
there's a Tarzan marathon

844
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,083
running on TV tonight.

845
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,083
- Dad!

846
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,583
- What? I mean, if you think

847
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,583
it'll make you homesick,

848
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,166
you don't have to watch.

849
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,208
- I love Tarzan.

850
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,916
He is a national hero

851
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,916
in Africa.

852
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,875
- Really?

853
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,875
- Really?

854
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,666
- Really, yes.

855
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,666
(Laughs)

856
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,416
I'm sorry, it is a joke.

857
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,458
- Oh!

858
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,458
(All laugh)

859
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,708
- Yes! (Laughs)

860
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,708
LOL!

861
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,375
- Oh, you got me.

862
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,375
- Yes.

863
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,875
- Well, your man's got

864
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,875
a sense of humour,

865
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,875
maybe it'll rub off on you.

866
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,208
- Ooh. Wow.

867
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,916
You could fit an entire village

868
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,916
in your kitchen.

869
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,875
(All laugh)

870
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,000
Wow.

871
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,750
It's a zebra pattern wood.

872
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,750
Black and white.

873
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,583
Clara: Yes, yes, it is,

874
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,583
isn't it.

875
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,583
- That's something.

876
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,583
- Mhmm.

877
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,833
- Here you go.

878
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,333
(Suitcase thuds)

879
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,875
So...

880
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,791
what's with the accent?

881
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,166
- It's African.

882
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,166
- It's not African.

883
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,083
I don't know what it is,

884
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,083
but it's not South African.

885
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,375
And also, I told you

886
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,375
to buy a suit!

887
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,458
What's with the... robes?

888
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:12,833
- Haven't you seen

889
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:12,833
"Coming To America?"

890
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,333
Oh, come on.

891
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:18,083
- My God, you are as bad

892
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:18,083
as my father.

893
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,291
Make yourself at home.

894
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,000
(Door latch clicks)

895
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,458
- (Breathes deeply, groans)

896
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,000
(Dogs bark, muffled chatter,

897
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,000
music playing)

898
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,458
(Gasps)

899
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,875
Oh!

900
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,666
(Clara laughs)

901
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:41,916
- Aunt Clara, how could you

902
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:41,916
let me sleep in?

903
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,458
I'm supposed to open

904
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,458
the Rocky Point store!

905
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,291
- Well honey, that's the last

906
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,291
thing you need to think about

907
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:49,250
is the store, did you forget...

908
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:52,750
you have a wedding

909
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:52,750
in one week?

910
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:56,125
- No, I didn't forget.

911
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,208
- Well, I have Mike

912
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,208
covering for you,

913
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,500
so everything is fine.

914
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,500
Not to worry about it.

915
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:04,416
- It looks like somebody got

916
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:04,416
their freak on last night.

917
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,375
Hilary: Excuse me!

918
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:08,291
Did I teach you

919
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:08,291
to talk like that?

920
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,000
- I'm just saying.

921
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,458
- Maybe if you minded your

922
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,458
manners,

923
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,583
you'd be the one with a man.

924
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,583
- Hilary!

925
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,375
- Mom!

926
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,375
- I'm just saying.

927
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:17,958
- Okay, maybe I should go up

928
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:17,958
and check on Mtumbie, then.

929
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,833
- Oh, he's been up for hours.

930
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,708
He's out front

931
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,708
with your father.

932
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,916
- He's with dad?

933
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,916
- Mhmm.

934
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,416
Oh, and... (Chuckles)

935
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,083
your uncle Rufus

936
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,083
is on his way over.

937
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,000
(Hilary guffaws)

938
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,541
- When I told him you were

939
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,541
marrying an African,

940
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,708
he was so thrilled.

941
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,041
You know he considers himself

942
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,041
an expert on Africa.

943
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,958
(All laugh)

944
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,291
- He ain't been nowhere near

945
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,291
Africa, honey.

946
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,250
Hilary: He probably can't

947
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,250

00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,875
in a boating accident.

1135
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:36,916
- Drowned in a boating

1136
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:36,916
accident...

1137
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,083
- And then it's over

1138
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,083
and done with,

1139
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,416
I'm a respectable widow.

1140
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,708
- Okay look, you didn't say

1141
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,708
nothin' about no drowning or--

1142
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,666
- Oh, you don't really drown,

1143
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,666
you're just gonna fake it.

1144
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,833
- Fake it. Listen, I met

1145
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,833
your family, girl,

1146
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,833
and they seem like some nice,

1147
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,833
regular black folk.

1148
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,166
But what the hell

1149
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,166
happened to you?

1150
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:57,041
- (Scoffs) I saw that guy

1151
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:57,041
who was after you.

1152
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,666
If I had left you back there,

1153
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,666
you'd be dead for real.

1154
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,583
You owe me.

1155
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:06,166
- Whoo! You're a piece of work,

1156
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:06,166
you know that?

1157
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,166
- I'm goin' to bed.

1158
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,541
See you in the morning.

1159
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,250
(Door slams)

1160
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,375
- And I can swim, by the way.

1161
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,625
- (Yawning) Hi.

1162
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,333
- So we have to hurry, we have

1163
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,333
a nine o'clock appointment.

1164
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,791
And... oh, shoot.

1165
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,000
We'll just grab some food

1166
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,000
later, okay?

1167
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,416
Malcolm: (Singing) Day-O!

1168
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,416
Me say day me say day

1169
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,333
me say day me say day...

1170
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:34,708
- Ah... mmph!

1171
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,791
- Mm, strawberries.

1172
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,375
Good morning, sweetheart.

1173
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,958
- Good morning.

1174
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,958
- Good morning, Mtumbie.

1175
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,375
- Good morning, ladies.

1176
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,375
- So, listen.

1177
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:47,041
Maya and I have to make a run

1178
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:47,041
but Ed is out back,

1179
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,000
and I told him to show you

1180
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,000
around while we're gone.

1181
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,541
- Oh no, no, no, he can

1182
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,541
come with us.

1183
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,208
- No honey, don't be silly.

1184
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,375
It's bad luck for the groom

1185
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,375
to see the wedding dress.

1186
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,041
- Mhmm.

1187
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,041
- Okay?

1188
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,416
And he needs to spend time

1189
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,416
with your father.

1190
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,458
- Um...

1191
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,458
- Okay?

1192
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,875
- Okay.

1193
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,875
- It's good.

1194
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,125
- Bye.

1195
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,125
- Goodbye, ladies.

1196
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,791
- Have a good day.

1197
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,791
- You too.

1198
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,458
- Okay, come on.

1199
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,458
- Uh, we won't be long, right?

1200
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,250
- We've gotta look at flowers,

1201
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,041
and then you've gotta help me

1202
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,041
pick a dress!

1203
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,083
(Tools rattle)

1204
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:18,666
- Good morning, Ed.

1205
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:18,666
- Morning.

1206
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,750
- It is a such a beautiful

1207
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,750
day today, huh?

1208
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,625
(Both chuckle)

1209
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:27,000
So, what is it you

1210
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:27,000
are building?

1211
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,541
- A workshop.

1212
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,125

1213
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,333
(Ed grunts)

1214
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,333
- I got it.

1215
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,916
- Come on. Okay.

1216
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,833
(Hammers thud)

1217
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,500
- (Grunts)

1218
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:51,833
I'm gonna go down

1219
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:51,833
and get a beer.

1220
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,375
You want one?

1221
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:56,166
- Yes, Ed. Thank you.

1222
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,708
- Okay.

1223
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,916

1224
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,416

(Door creaks, bangs)

1226
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,208
- That boy is good

1227
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,208
with his hands.

1228
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,375
Ed: Yeah...

1229
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:21,083
who'dve thunk it.

1230
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,500
(Laughs softly)

1231
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,000
Clara: Okay, watch the box.

1232
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,000
Maya: Okay.

1233
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,666
- Yeah, I'll take these.

1234
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,666
- Okay.

1235
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,416
- Great.

1236
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,416
- Good.

1237
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:34,583
Got it?

1238
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:34,583
- Whew! Okay.

1239
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,416
Wow, we got a lot of stuff.

1240
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,833
- Well, we need every bit

1241
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,833
of it.

Malcolm: Hello, ladies.

1245
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,750

1246
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,750

Hi.

00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,750
- Hi.

1252
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,166
- Hey, Naomi. Ahem!

1253
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,875
- Girl, let me get that

1254
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,875

- Now, I like him.

1262
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:47,833
He reminds me of a young

1263
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:47,833
Denzel Washington.

1264
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,708

I have to go look

at wedding cakes.

1285
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,416
- No, no, Aunt Clara,

1286
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,416
I told you,

1287
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,166
I just wanna keep

1288
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,166
things simple.

1289
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,250
- Honey, you have

1290
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,250
to have a cake.

1291
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,583
Now, I know they have wedding

1292
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,583

1293
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,208
Don't they?

1294
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,000
- Anyway, stop talking

1295
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,000
to her about weddings.

1296
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,583
She don't know nothing

1297
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,583
about weddings!

1298
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:48,625
She ain't never been married.

1299
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,416
Just do what you're supposed

1300
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,416
to do.

1301
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,291
- Yes, ma'am.

1302
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,291

1303
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,375
But hush your mouth, all right?

1305
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:58,333

00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:58,333
the dimensions,

1307
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,750
and we'll put 'em here,

1308
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,750
and here.

1309
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,916
So the solar panels will be

arriving in two weeks.

1311
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,083
Are you sure you can

1312
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,083
install them?

1313
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,875
- Oh, that is no problem.

1314
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,750

1315
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,750
solar panels in two weeks?

1316
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:10,375

1318
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:12,916

1330
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,083
- You have my dad ordering

1331
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,083
solar panels that he thinks

1332
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,708
you're gonna install when we

1333
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,708
come back from our honeymoon.

1334
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,125

1335

Right.

- Oh yeah? Oh! Oh!

1509
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:36,083
Really nice.

1510
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,666
(Both laugh)

1511
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,666
- I am trying--

1512
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:41,583
I'm a real artist.

1513
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:41,583
- Hey, wait a minute!

1514
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,958
(Both laugh)

1515
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Oh wow.

1516
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
- Ah...

1517
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,333
It's actually not that bad.

1518
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,166
- Yeah, not bad. Hold on,

1519
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,166
one-one little...

1520
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:54,375
just one little touch, hold on.

1521
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,708
Wow, green suits you.

1522
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,416
- (Laughs)

1523
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:04,416
- You're not bad in purple.

1524
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,583
I think that...

1525
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:14,083
we need to shower.

1526
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:16,875
- Yeah.

1527
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:19,416
(Both laugh)

1528
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,708
- (Sighs)

1529
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,625
It's all yours.

1530
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,625
- Yeah, thanks, I'll--

1531
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,791
- Where you going?

1532
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,458
- To use the shower

1533
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,458
in the house.

1534
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,166
- Oh well, there's like,

1535
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,166
more than enough room

1536
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:36,708
in there for the two of us.

1537
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,166
- In your dreams.

1538
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,375
(Water splashes)

1539
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,333
(Water splashes)

1540
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,666
- (Whistling)

1541
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:04,708
(Humming)

1542
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,208
(Tap creaks)

1543
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,958
- Oh, oh, oh, let me

1544
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,958
get that for you.

1545
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,375
- Huh? Oh! Aah!

1546
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,000
- Better dry you off before

1547
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,000
you catch a cold.

1548
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:14,708
- Um-uh...

1549
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,000
- I am fine,

1550
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,000
but thank you very much.

1551
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:21,791
- Okay yeah, I can see that.

1552
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:23,333
You know what you need?

1553
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:27,500
- Yes, my clothes.

1554
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:27,500
- A woman who appreciates you.

1555
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:36,375
♪♪♪

1556
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:38,125
- Maya, she appreciates me

1557
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:38,125
very, very much.

1558
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:41,458
- Hmm, if I had a man like you,

1559
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,583
there would only be one

1560
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,583
thing on...

1561
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,875
- Oh! Ah.

1562
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,875
- my mind.

1563
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:49,375
- Oh my, what do you think

1564
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:49,375
you are doing?

1565
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,750
- The way you looked at me

1566
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,750
the other day.

1567
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,291
I felt the sparks,

1568
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,291
and so did you.

1569
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,250
- Uh, uh, uh, uh! No, no, no,

1570
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,250
no, you are her cousin!

1571
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:56,708
- Once removed.

1572
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,208
- Yeah, but we are getting

1573
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,208
married in two days.

1574
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,625
Two days.

1575
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:01,875
- You can do a lot in two days.

1576
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:01,875
- No, no, no, no, no.

1577
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,750
I don't want that,

1578
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,750
I am not that kind of a man.

1579
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:05,583
Oh goodness! No!

1580
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,916
- Look, it's obvious there's

1581
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,916
nothing between you and Maya,

1582
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,583
or you wouldn't have looked

1583
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,583
at me like that.

1584
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,916
- Looked at you?

1585
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,916
No, no, no, it was a mistake.

1586
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,541
- Mhmm.

1587
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,208
- Okay, it was hot,

1588
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,208
and I am sorry.

1589
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,875
- I know, it was hot,

1590
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:20,208
but the heat wasn't coming

1591
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:20,208
from the sun,

1592
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,166
if you know what I mean?

1593
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:26,875
- No, no, no, no, no.

1594
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:26,875
Maya and me, we have...

1595
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,458
bumboya.

1596
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,458
- Bumboya?

1597
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,458
- Yes, bumboya.

1598
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,833
It is when the Gods

1599
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,833
put love in the hearts

1600
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,958
of the man, and the woman,

1601
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,583
and if anyone gets in between

1602
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,583
their Bumboya,

1603
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,291
they will be cursed forever!

1604
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,291
(Snaps fingers)

1605
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,666
- Whoa! Okay.

1606
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,666
- Yes.

1607
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:49,333
- Okay well, you can't knock

1608
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:49,333
a girl for trying.

1609
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:52,000
I didn't know you guys

1610
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:52,000
had bumboya.

1611
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,875
No hard feelings?

1612
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:58,333
I guess I'll see you

1613
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:58,333
at the wedding.

1614
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,416
- Yes. Okay.

1615
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,125
Bumboya!

1616
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,250
Clara: So how many of the large

1617
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,250
ones do you have?

1618
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:14,041
- I have four.

1619
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:14,041
- Oh, okay.

1620
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,750
- But you could just

1621
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,750
hang that one.

1622
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,958
- Yeah, and then

1623
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,958
if we need more,

1624
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,333
we can always just get more.

1625
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:21,875
Then we have enough of these.

1626
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:21,875
Look, I don't want--

1627
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:23,625
- Oh! Ouch.

1628
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,625
Oh! Oh! Ah!

1629
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:31,541
- Hi, ladies.

1630
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:31,541
- Hi.

1631
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:35,375
- Bye, ladies.

1632
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:35,375
- Bye.

1633
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:43,083
Well! I declare.

1634
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:44,375
(Clara laughs)

1635
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:47,416
- Okay...

1636
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,708
(Sighs)

1637
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,583
(Knocks)

1638
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,625
(Door opens)

1639
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,750
- Hey.

1640
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,750
Whoa.

1641
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,750
(Slams door)

1642
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:05,291
Did I do something?

1643
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,666
(Knocks)

1644
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:12,625
I was--

1645
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:16,416
(Rustling)

1646
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:20,291
- What in the--

1647
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,583
I think Maya just threw

1648
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,583
the flowers out the window.

1649
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:24,041
- What?

1650
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:29,166
That's what she did.

1651
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:33,208
Well, maybe it's some kind

1652
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:33,208
of African custom.

1653
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,083
- Why'd you do that?

1654
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,083
- I just saw you with Naomi!

1655
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:36,708
- Naomi? What?

1656
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,583
- I warned you not to make

1657
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,583
a pass at her!

1658
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,208
- What are you talking about?

1659
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,375
- I just saw you behind

1660
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,375
the boathouse.

1661
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:43,916
- You just saw me behind...

1662
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,375
(Gasps) Oh! Mm-mm!

1663
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:49,041
Mm-mm, it ain't like that,

1664
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:49,041
honestly.

1665
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,541
It was just a misunderstanding,

1666
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,541
okay?

1667
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,500
- You expect me to believe

1668
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,500
that?

1669
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:56,333
God!

1670
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,583
(Sighs heavily)

1671
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,833
What?

1672
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,833
- You're jealous.

1673
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:07,166
- Of what?

1674
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:07,166
- Come on.

1675
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:10,541
Admit it, you've got

1676
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:10,541
feelings for me.

1677
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:12,875
Mhmm.

1678
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:12,875
- Feelings?

1679
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:16,250
- Yeah.

1680
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:16,250
- Yeah sure, I've got feelings.

1681
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:18,875
Let's start with nausea,

1682
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:18,875
repulsion,

1683
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:21,333
not to mention pity.

1684
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,083
- You've got it really bad.

1685
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,083
Ooh!

1686
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,041
- Oh, God! You know, you are

1687
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,041
one twisted individual!

1688
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,250
I couldn't care less if

1689
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,250
you're interested in Naomi.

1690
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:31,250
I'm sure she's your type.

1691
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:33,541
After this honeymoon is over,

1692
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:33,541
you're out of my life for good,

1693
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:35,541
thank God, and you can go

1694
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:35,541
and find some other Naomi

1695
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,500

1696

(Footsteps stomp)

1698
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,083

1699
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,250
- Maya, what--

1700
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:55,000
Wow! Um...

1701
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:58,416
What is going on?

1703

1704

listen to me, please?

1705
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,250
Oh great, where are you going?

1706
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,250
- I'm taking a drive.

1707

Get out!

1709

- No.

1710
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:14,500
- Get out of my car!

1711
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:16,166
- No, I'm not getting out

1712
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:16,166

1713
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:17,916

1714

Two more days and we're done.

1715

1719
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,375

1720
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,375
what you want for dinner.

1721
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:29,791

1723

1724
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:33,708
because we were just about

1725
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:33,708
to go out to dinner.

1726
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:37,291

doin' tonight?

1732
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,041

for two, please?

1734
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,958
- You're in luck, I've got

1735
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,958
a table with a great view.

1736
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,541
- Um, no, thank you.

1737
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,458
We'll just take one that's

1738
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,458

1746

1748
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:17,833
you'd be into that.

1749

Don't look, please!

1761

Can you just relax, please?

1762

Calm down, all right?

looking over there?

1774
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:52,041

2269
01:12:57,458 --> 01:13:00,500
- Hey, auntie.

2270
01:12:57,458 --> 01:13:00,500
- Hi, honey.

2271
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:02,208
- How's Maya?

2272
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,375
- Well, she's uh...

2273
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,375
she's holding up.

2274
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:06,333
- (Sighs)

2275
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:08,416
- Aww...

2276
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:14,625
- Who you looking for?

2277
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:14,625
- Tyrell, he's my date.

2278
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:17,000
- You brought a date

2279
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:17,000
to a wake?

2280
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:19,041
Rufus: Why can't you bring

2281
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:19,041
a date to a wake?

2282
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:22,000
I mean, in Africa,

2283
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:22,000
a wake is a celebration!

2284
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,041
Live music and libations.

2285
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:27,125
- But we're not in Africa,

2286
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:28,708
so I'm sure you'll forgive us

2287
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,833
if we're not up for partying

2288
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,833
right now.

2289
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:33,916
- I mean, Mtumbie would've

2290
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:33,916
wanted it this way.

2291
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:35,916
I'm just saying.

2292
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:39,291
- I'm just saying,

2293
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:39,291
give it a rest.

2294
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:40,166
- (Sighs)

2295
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:45,166
- Where is Maya?

2296
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:45,166
- She's up in her room, honey.

2297
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,875
- Okay.

2298
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:54,208
Naomi: Mtumbie was a great guy.

2299

2300
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:01,875
Maybe that's why you two

2301
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:01,875
couldn't keep your hands

2302
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:01,875
off each other.

2303
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:03,416
Oh, don't give me that look.

2304
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:05,291
I saw you guys on the beach.

2305
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,750
- I don't know what

2306
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,750
you're talking about!

2307
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:09,916
Hmph!

2308
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:12,333
Okay, yes,

2309
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:12,333
I made a pass at him.

2310
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:15,750
You know how I am,

2311
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:15,750
I can't help myself!

2312
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:18,625
- He was my fiancee.

2313
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:20,291
How could you do that to me?

2314
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,291
- Hey, I'm the one who

2315
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,291
should be upset.

2316
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,916
- You?

2317
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:26,833
- I've never had bumboya

2318
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:26,833
with anyone.

2319
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:30,791
- What is bumboya?

2320
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:34,958
- I don't know, some love

2321
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:34,958
thing from the Gods.

2322
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,708
Anyway, Mtumbie says

2323
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,708
you guys have it.

2324
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:41,041

this is her father, Ed.

Maya Johnson?

daughter to marry you?

2381
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:48,041
- Oh shit.

2382
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:50,375
- Forgive me, sir,

2383
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:50,375
how inconsiderate of me.

2384
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,875

2386
01:17:51,916 --> 01:17:54,041
to marry your daughter?

2387
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:57,291

2388
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:57,291

it's-it's normal.

2391

It's an African custom

2392
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:01,166
that when the husband--

2393
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:04,083
- Oh shhh!

2394
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:09,875
- There is no excuse

2395
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:09,875
for what I did.

2396
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:11,666
And I'm very sorry.

2397
01:18:13,416 --> 01:18:15,666

2398
01:18:13,416 --> 01:18:15,666
is she in on it?

2399
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,000
'Cause she sure had me fooled

2400
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,000
with all them tears

2401
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,625
she's been shedding over you.

2402
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,625
- Really?

2403
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:22,333
She was crying over me?

2404
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:26,333
- All right,

2405
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:26,333
that tells me that uh...

2406
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:28,333
she wasn't in on it.

2407
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:28,333
- (Groans)

2408
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,791
- Man, the only person being

2409
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,791
scammed here is me.

2410
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:33,166
- Right, right.

2411
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,875
- I was just doing it

2412
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,875
as a favor to her.

2413
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,375
She needed an African husband,

2414
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,375
and...

2415
01:18:36,416 --> 01:18:38,458
- An African?

2416
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,958
- Yeah, and I played the part,

2417
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,958
man.

2418
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,375
- (Laughs)

2419
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,375
- Right.

2420
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,833

2421
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,833
- Yeah...

2422
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:49,083
- After you left, I chased

2423
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:49,083
after you in my car.

2424
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:51,333
I drove very, very badly

2425
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:51,333
along a winding road,

2426
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,583
and the car went over the side.

2427
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,583
- Oh!

2428
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:57,583
- It flipped over many times,

2429
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:57,583
and I was hurt very badly.

2430
01:18:57,625 --> 01:19:00,083
The next thing I remember,

2431
01:18:57,625 --> 01:19:00,083
I am in a hospital.

2432
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:02,958

2433
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:02,958

2434
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,291

well, the machine was

2437
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:07,500
beep beeping no more.

2438
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:08,958
- Ohhh!

2439
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:08,958
- Huh?

2440
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,166
- And then an angel

2441
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,166
comes to me.

2442
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,625
- An angel?

2443
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,625
- Great big wings.

2444
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:14,791
And she whispers in my ear.

2445
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:14,791
- Uh...

2446
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,916
- "Go to Maya."

2447
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:18,750
Just like that.

2448
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:18,750
- Oh!

2449
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:20,958
- I cry out in catharsis,

2450
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:20,958
I must find my Maya,

2451
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,833
I must tell her,

2452
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,833
proclaim to her my love.

2453
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:27,625
And then, the machine starts

2454
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:27,625
beeping again.

2455
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:29,666
- Uh huh...

2456
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:29,666
- Hmph!

2457
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:32,458
- (Laughs) You take me

2458
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:32,458
for a damn fool, huh?

2459
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:35,958
Listen.

2460
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:39,083
I'm in 50/50,

2461
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,541
or I'm gonna bust a cap

2462
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,541
in your ass.

2463
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:47,125
- Then do it.

2464
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:47,125
- I ain't playin'.

2465
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:49,125
- I ain't playin' either.

2466
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:51,208
You gonna shoot me, do it now,

2467
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:51,208
and get it over with,

2468
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:54,083
'cause I ain't got nothing

2469
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:54,083
to lose, man.

2470
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,916
I'm already dead.

2471
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,125
- Where do you think

2472
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,125
you're goin'?

2473
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:59,583
Sit your ass-- hey!

2474
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:59,583
Malcolm!

2475
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:01,833
Dang it!

2476
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:04,833
Listen, man.

2477
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:04,833
Hey, hey, hey!

2478
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:06,958
What the hell is wrong

2479
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:06,958
with you, man?

2480
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,916
Look, all I'm asking for is my

2481
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,916
little piece of the action!

2482
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:10,375
- Aren't you listenin'

2483
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:10,375
to me man,

2484
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:12,208
there ain't no money, okay?

2485
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:12,208
If you're gonna shoot me,

2486
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:13,916
just do it now, and get it

2487
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:13,916
over with, all right?

2488
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:15,625
Do it. Just do it.

2489
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:20,625
- You're bluffing.

2490
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:20,625
- Oh, I'm bluffing.

2491
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:23,250
Okay, if I'm bluffing, call it.

2492
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,750
Call it. Call it!

2493
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:27,625
Or get your punk ass

2494
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:27,625
outta here.

2495
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:29,708
- (Chuckles)

2496
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:29,708
- Yeah.

2497
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:32,750
- Oh, a tough guy

2498
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:32,750
all of the sudden.

2499
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:36,541
It's the chick, huh?

2500
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,375
You fell for her. God!

2501
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:40,166
It's always a chick.

2502
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:43,541
- Please, will you still

2503
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:43,541
marry me?

2504
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,375
Please, Maya.

2505
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:52,250
What about South Africa?

2506
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:52,250
What about us?

2507
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:54,000
Your art? Maya!

2508
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:54,000
- I...

2509
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:56,666
- You ain't even worth

2510
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:56,666
me wasting,

2511
01:20:56,708 --> 01:21:00,083
because like you said,

2512
01:20:56,708 --> 01:21:00,083
you're already a dead man.

2513
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:03,583
(Chuckles meanly)

2514
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,500
(Laughs)

2515
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,625
You have a good day, princess.

2516
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:15,083
(Laughs to himself)

2517
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,833
(Engine turns and rumbles)

2518
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:26,250
(Brakes squeak)

2519
01:21:26,291 --> 01:21:29,125
(Tires squeal, engine revs)

2520
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:33,500
- (Laughs)

2521
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,875
- Please, Maya.

2522
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,875
- (Groans)

2523
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:44,416
- Um... okay everyone,

2524
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,416
there's something that I need

2525
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,416
to tell you.

2526
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:49,291
(Doorbell rings)

2527
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:55,125
- Oh!

2528
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:57,041
Grandma Rose: Who is it?

2529
01:21:58,125 --> 01:21:59,833
(Gasps)

2530
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:05,041
Is it really you?

2531
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:05,041
- It is I, G-mamma.

2532
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:07,625
(Clara cries out)

2533
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:12,708
- (Sobs) Oh! Ohhh!

2534
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,791
- What is going on?

2535
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,791
Grandma Rose: Look, everybody!

2536
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:18,083
- (Ed gasps, Maya sighs)

2537
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:21,916
(All gasp)

2538
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:22,708
- Johnsons.

2539
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:27,125
I am alive.

2540
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:31,000
- (Growls)

2541
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:33,791
- I made it out of the water.

2542
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:36,875
I swam to an island and then

2543
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:36,875
a fishing man picked me up.

2544
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:39,916
I had lost all of my memory,

2545
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:39,916
and...

2546
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:42,375
suddenly it just.. (snaps)

2547
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,000
came back to me.

2548
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,000
- Hmm.

2549
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:49,291
- That's almost the same story!

2550
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:49,291
All: Hmm...

2551
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:51,291
Maya: Malcolm, it's over.

2552
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,291
- What? What is over?

2553
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:55,750
And who is this Malcolm?

2554
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:55,750
- No, seriously.

2555
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:58,916
You don't have to do

2556
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:58,916
this anymore.

2557
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:00,833
It's just-it's time to tell

2558
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:00,833
everyone the truth.

2559
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,250
- What are you talking about?

2560
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:05,916
- Yeah, what are you

2561
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:05,916
talking about?

2562
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:07,916
- Um...

2563
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:10,250
After I told you I was engaged,

2564
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:14,541
I caught Mtumbie cheating on me.

2565
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:16,916
Malcolm: I...

2566
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:16,916
Cousins: Oh!

2567
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,666
- No, not-not Malcolm!

2568
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:20,875
The real Mtumbie.

2569
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:20,875
Ed: Grrr!

2570
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,416
After I found him I called

2571
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,416
off the engagement,

2572
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:27,291
and I came home.

2573
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:29,416
But when I saw you

2574
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:29,416
at the airport,

2575
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,541
I just couldn't tell you

2576
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,541
the truth so I lied,

2577
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:34,125
and said that he was coming.

2578
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:37,125
- But... he did come...

2579
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:39,416
didn't he?

2580
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:39,416
- Not really.

2581
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,625
- Mm! Mm! Mm!

2582
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:45,375
- I met Malcolm

2583
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:45,375
at a diner in town,

2584
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:52,000
and I convinced him to pretend

2585
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:52,000
to be Mtumbie.

2586
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:54,125
He was just doing me a favor.

2587
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,791
- This... (Gasps)

2588
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:00,500
- And we didn't really go

2589
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:00,500
to Africa on our honeymoon.

2590
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:02,208
We just...

2591
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,791
we stayed in L.A.

2592
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:06,625
And when I came back

2593
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:06,625
I made up the whole story

2594
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:07,916
about him drowning.

2595
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:07,916
- Oh lord.

2596
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:12,083
- Are you insane?

2597
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:15,666
I mean...

2598
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:18,000
I can't believe you did this.

2599
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:20,250
- I'm sorry.

2600
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:20,250
- I'm sorry?!

2601
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,208
You're sorry?!

2602
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:26,041
Your aunt Clara and your

2603
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:26,041
grandmother have been looking

2604
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:27,750
at pictures of your wedding,

2605
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:29,291
crying over this man that

2606
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:29,291
we thought was Mtumbie.

2607
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:31,125
I mean, I-I don't know

2608
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:31,125
what's worse,

2609
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,916
thinking that he was dead,

2610
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:35,125
or knowing that this

2611
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:35,125
is all a lie!

2612
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:37,416
- I didn't mean to hurt you.

2613
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:42,541
I didn't mean to hurt

2614
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:42,541
any of you.

2615
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,083
- Why did you do it?

2616
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:50,208
- Because I couldn't face you.

2617
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:54,791
- You did all this because you

2618
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:54,791
couldn't face me?

2619
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:56,458
That is the stupidest thing

2620
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:56,458
I ever heard!

2621
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,000
Clara and Grandma Rose: Ed!

2622
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:00,833
- See, this is exactly

2623
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:00,833
what I'm talking about!

2624
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:04,958
- Am I that horrible a dad

2625
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,875
that you couldn't come to me

2626
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,875
with the truth?

2627
01:25:06,916 --> 01:25:10,000
- I wanted to tell you,

2628
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:12,500
but every time I tried,

2629
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:12,500
you'd make some big deal

2630
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:13,958
about how he's from Africa,

2631
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,541
you don't want me to marry

2632
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,541
an African,

2633
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:16,916
and you think that I'm making

2634
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:16,916
a huge mistake,

2635
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:19,000
and so I clammed up!

2636
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:21,375
- Sweetheart, I didn't not want

2637
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:21,375
you to marry an African,

2638
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,166
I-I don't care where

2639
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,166
he was from.

2640
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:26,416
I just didn't want you

2641
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:26,416
to go away.

2642
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:31,916
That's why I built

2643
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:31,916
the art studio out back.

2644
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:34,208
- Wait, the workshop is for me?

2645
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:37,583
- I wanted you to have a place

2646
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:37,583
to do your art.

2647
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:39,750
It was going to be a surprise.

2648
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:41,125
All: Awww...

2649
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:46,416
- I'm really sorry, Dad.

2650
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:49,125
- Me too.

2651
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:52,166
(Both sigh)

2652
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:58,541
- But the truth is,

2653
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,208
(Sighs)

2654
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:05,416
I really fell in love

2655
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:05,416
with Malcolm.

2656
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:07,458
Clara: Ohh...

2657
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,208
- W-which one is Malcolm?

2658
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:14,583
- (Laughs)

2659
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:16,541
- Yeah, and I fell in love

2660
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:16,541
with Maya, too.

2661
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:19,166
- Well, don't tell us,

2662
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:19,166
go tell her!

2663
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:21,625
- Oh, G-mamma.

2664
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:24,416
She already knows.

2665
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:25,916
Come here, girl.

2666
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:27,541

2667
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:31,708
Cousins: Oh! Aww! Ohhh!

2668
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,833

2669
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,000
(All laugh)

2670
01:26:41,416 --> 01:26:44,500
- Hi. I don't think we've

2671
01:26:41,416 --> 01:26:44,500
actually haven't met yet.

2672
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:46,166
I'm Naomi.

2673
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:51,083
