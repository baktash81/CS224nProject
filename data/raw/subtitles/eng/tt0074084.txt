1
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,620
# In the mountains
we became wolves

2
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:06,210
# Our slogan is:
Freedom or death!

3
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:09,800
# We'll go down the valley
carrying our Uzis

4
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,712
# ready to fight.

5
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,796
# Among the victims
waiting for revenge

6
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,280
# among those skinny faces

7
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:24,160
# we'll pay them back
on the barricades

8
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:27,279
# a bullet for a bullet.

9
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,877
# We'll pay them back
on the barricades...#

10
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,079
War is over!

11
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,956
Why?

12
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,796
You all follow us! Run!

13
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,471
I've never even shot a hen!

14
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,791
I want one too.

15
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,319
Be careful, don't let them kill you!

16
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,075
Women, store the hay
or if it rains it'll get wet.

17
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,799
What do you want?

18
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,000
I want one too.
I cut off the phone lines.

19
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:04,836
Tigre, give one to me too!
You promised!

20
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,515
Leonida, come here!

21
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,315
Take the charger too.

22
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,759
- Where are you going Leonida?
- I want to kill them too!

23
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,865
..from the radio station of Milan
which we've just occupied.

24
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,399
Free at last, Milan
welcomes the Italian people.

25
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,000
This is the Command of the
Partisan Brigades "Giacomo Matteotti"

26
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:11,119
At this very moment of joy

27
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,560
our thought goes to all
those who died on every front

28
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:18,800
fighting against
the Nazi-fascist barbarians.

29
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,756
But above all...

30
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,276
Leonida! What are you doing here?

31
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,154
I didn't see you get in.

32
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,560
You look so serious!
What do you need that rifle for?

33
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:34,516
Away!

34
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,158
- Long live Stalin!
- Have you gone nuts?

35
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,552
Long live Stalin!

36
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,476
Attila and Regina!

37
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,076
Attila and Regina!

38
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,268
# Remember that day in April,

39
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,591
# a long train
which moved... #

40
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,556
Regina!

41
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,278
Regina!

42
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,036
Attila!

43
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,912
Here I am!

44
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,512
Come on here!

45
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,356
You asked for it!

46
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,956
Swallows are back

47
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,276
Wait please.

48
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,233
Did you know my
granddad died right there?

49
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,196
Sit down!

50
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,440
Did you know that each cow
has its own drinking trough in America?

51
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:51,433
But they're American cows,
they live in comfort.

52
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,600
Would you like
to go to America, Leonida?

53
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:58,556
Call me Olmo.

54
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,720
- You're not Leonida anymore?
- My name as a partisan is Olmo.

55
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:08,599
- Do you know who Olmo was?
- He was the bravest!

56
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,116
The bravest...

57
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,040
Well, my little warrior, what
do you think about your master?

58
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,270
There's no more masters.

59
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:25,975
MANY YEARS EARLIER

60
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,711
Verdi is dead!

61
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,669
Giuseppe Verdi is dead!

62
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,719
Push! Push! Push! Push!

63
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,760
- Push! Push!
- Here it comes!

64
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,750
Come on, push!

65
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,632
- Close the door.
- Be quiet kids.

66
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,799
It's a boy! It's a boy!

67
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,794
Rosina had a boy!

68
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,036
It's a boy!

69
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,476
It's a boy! It's a boy!

70
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,076
What about that
irresponsible woman?

71
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,159
Did you hear, darn woman?

72
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,240
The peasant was born
before his master's son!

73
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:39,708
Should I come up there
and draw out the baby?

74
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,880
Eleonora push!
Come on, let him out!

75
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,836
Push harder!

76
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,031
Come on, push!

77
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,837
Damn it!

78
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,356
Dad.

79
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,356
Dad..

80
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,475
Alfredo was born!

81
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:27,230
He'll be named after me!

82
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,276
- What if it's a girl?
- It's not a girl, is it?

83
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,840
You think I can't tell the difference?
This baby has a willy!

84
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:40,274
He's got his father's eyes.

85
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,435
And his grandfather's money.

86
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,580
He's got a willy!
He's got a willy!

87
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,930
Giovanni! Giovanni! Giovanni!

88
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:51,279
- What?
- How's his mother?

89
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,239
- She's well.
- Kiss her for me.

90
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,156
"Heaven sends us here
like a hot summer wind.

91
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:07,564
May he bring in his heart
his ancestors' noble virtues"

92
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:10,479
Okay, we understood.
Giovanni!

93
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,120
- Yes dad?
. Write to that playboy of your brother.

94
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:16,157
- Write to him, come on.
- Yes, dad.

95
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,591
"Ottavio..." But
haven't you got any paper?

96
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,075
"Ottavio Berlinghieri,
Hotel de Ben. Lido, Venezia.

97
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,154
We give notice of Berlinghieri's
first born in 20th century, period.

98
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,795
I'll pray for him
to be different from you, period.

99
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,120
Found a wife yet,
question mark. Hugs. Dad."

100
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,280
- Did you write everything down?
- Of course dad.

101
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:41,236
Good.

102
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,190
Sister Desolata is here!

103
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,960
- Dear brother.
- It's a boy.

104
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,916
Bravo! Bravo!

105
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,834
Take everything out of the car.
I'm not going back to the nunnery.

106
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,679
Monsignor ignores me,
he no longer cares for me.

107
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,640
He likes novices better.
If they came from good families at least!

108
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:29,600
- Listen. The other day I..
- My hat!

109
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:31,556
Alfredo!

110
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,356
May the Lord be praised.

111
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,394
My gosh, even this house is full of priests!
I can't escape them!

112
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,477
Hunchback, what do you see?

113
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,314
There's snow, like in winter.

114
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,840
- Then?
- A cathedral with spires!

115
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:09,832
- Then what?
- Bottles.

116
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,319
- Sorry?
- Bottles.

117
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,003
# To life, which smiles on you... #

118
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,160
Master, that's Heaven
and you're God almighty.

119
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:27,835
I wish I had the keys!
I'd be a nice drunk St. Peter!

120
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,999
Here! Get drunk!

121
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,600
Enough with work.
Let's drink now.

122
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:01,717
Cheers!

123
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,014
This is for you.
No work today.

124
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:09,069
Vincenzo, this wine is special.
Let's celebrate.

125
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,120
- Thank you master.
- But where's Leo?

126
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:14,919
Over there.

127
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,753
- No...
- Give it to me, dog!

128
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,870
Libero, do you know who died?
Look at this bottle!

129
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:50,421
It was fate for them
to be born on the same day.

130
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:52,692
Let's celebrate!

131
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,760
Mister Alfredo, do you
how many D'Alc? we are now?

132
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:59,839
I can't count them.

133
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,479
When I sit at the table
there are 40 of us eating.

134
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Come on Leo, think about it!
He's a peasant but he's a male!

135
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:12,074
Why? Males don't eat food?

136
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,436
What's wrong with you?

137
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,559
Mine was born before yours.

138
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,600
Everyone knows, peasants
came before their masters.

139
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,640
Masters, peasants, bullshit!
At birth we're all the same.

140
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:33,949
- All the same?
- Shut up you scoundrel!

141
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,396
Hey you!

142
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,276
What are you waiting for?
I told you to drink, you rascals!

143
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,556
Drink with me.

144
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,414
Ok, let's drink.

145
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,509
Born together!
It has to mean something.

146
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,360
It means the two of us
will die together.

147
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:52,272
Go to hell, philosopher
my butt!

148
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,628
My grandchild will be a notary.

149
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,278
- Mine'll be a thief.
- Then he can also be a priest.

150
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,800
- This isn't local wine.
- It's too good for you.

151
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,030
I didn't like it too.

152
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,439
Rigoletto, stop drinking,
run to the town hall.

153
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Tell them he's named after me,
Alfredo. Berlinghieri Alfredo.

154
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:30,796
Son of Giovanni
and Eleonora Rossetti.

155
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,258
Leo, what are you going to call him?

156
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,637
- What?
- What are you going to call your grandkid?

157
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,396
Olmo.

158
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,999
Olmo, like the elm tree.

159
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,993
Olmo D'Alc? son of Oscar
and Rosina Cop.

160
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,719
Oscar? He died 4 years ago!

161
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,040
It doesn't matter.
We must respect the dead.

162
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,796
What dogs you are!

163
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,720
# Summer comes
and it's very hot,

164
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:26,320
# two kids were born
close to each other. #

165
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,231
Come on, drink!

166
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,716
The hunchback didn't like it!

167
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,039
# Destiny played a trick.

168
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,909
# The son of the master
and the bastard peasant #

169
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,360
Leo, why don't take a ride too?

170
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:17,715
I'm not riding that devil.

171
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,480
So, I ploughed three hectares
in ten minutes and all by himself.

172
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,855
Six men need six hours.

173
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:50,229
And you think you did it well?

174
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,840
Mr. Giovanni, look at
all the hay you left behind...

175
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:58,400
That's nothing.
You don't believe me, do you?

176
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:01,959
This thing comes from
abroad, blockhead.

177
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,239
We're the first in the Bassa
to have a mechanic rake.

178
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,279
So Blessed are the last.
This thing has the teeth of a hyena.

179
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,590
Run, Nina, or he'll catch you!

180
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,748
- 19!
- You make me sick!

181
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,317
20! 20!

182
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,754
Wait and you'll see.

183
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,319
- Kiss it, kiss it!
- Go to hell!

184
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,480
Olmo is a bastard!
Olmo is a bastard!

185
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:01,155
Olmo is a bastard!

186
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,038
Olmo is a bastard!

187
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,230
Eat it!

188
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,320
- Coward!
- Run away, shit face!

189
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:19,359
You can only scare girls!

190
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,560
- If you're brave you have to do what I do.
- I'm brave!

191
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:25,551
And you go to hell!

192
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,596
Coward.

193
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,159
What are you doing?

194
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,116
I'm fucking the ground.

195
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,471
- What are you doing now?
- I can hear my dad speak to me.

196
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,468
In the telegraph pole?

197
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,349
I can't hear anything.

198
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,239
- Are you nuts?
- Let's see who's brave and who's a sissy.

199
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,640
When the train comes
close your eyes or you'll get blind.

200
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:42,269
- Now you can't run!
- Let go of me!

201
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,596
Coward!

202
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,670
Olmo! Olmo!

203
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,836
Olmo!

204
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,316
Are you dead or what?

205
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,470
Ding-dong, ding-dong. The hell
with it and kill the master!

206
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,160
How long does it take
from here to Madonna dei Prati?

207
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:38,196
About 3 kilometres.

208
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,398
Once I saw a train whose length was
from here to Madonna dei Prati.

209
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:46,576
And my dick's length
is from here to Piacenza!

210
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:48,231
And it's as fast as a train too?

211
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,574
Trains are real machines,
not that rake there.

212
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:59,309
I like to drive that rake,
you're against progress!

213
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,473
It makes me work less, and I'm happy.

214
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,999
- But who do you think pays for it?
- The master does.

215
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,079
We pay for machines with our work.

216
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,552
First he passed his lice on to Paride
and then to the little one

217
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,356
I tried to delouse him,
but he always runs away.

218
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:31,200
It's not only the lice! Today Olmo
made my Nina eat a living frog!

219
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:36,680
...and what do you know
about philosophy? Nothing!

220
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:42,200
I'm the only one who went
to the meeting of the League,

221
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:46,080
because you can go to meetings
only if you understand things.

222
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:49,959
Then you can go around
speaking of justice

223
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,559
inside the isolated cottages
where honest peasants work hard,

224
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,881
while the rich bourgeois
despises his labour.

225
00:31:57,981 --> 00:31:58,935
Amen.

226
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,318
Look at him!

227
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,720
- Who's crying?
- Rosina wants to send Olmo to the Seminary.

228
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:26,598
- Why?
- Because he's a devil!

229
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,036
They want to take away my son,
make him become a priest!

230
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,359
You wanted to had fun?
Now cry!

231
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,760
Leave her be, that's a long time ago!

232
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:50,228
All the bastards
end up being evil!

233
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,311
Bastard? Who's a bastard?

234
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,279
There are no bastards in my house.

235
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,800
Olmo is your children's brother
because his father is one of us.

236
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:07,759
Isn't it true, Rosina?

237
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,795
Tell them, Rosina,
as you know.

238
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,669
Of course I know. It's true.

239
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,911
Who else could know?

240
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,396
Olmo!

241
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,916
Olmo D'Alc?

242
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,406
Olmo, you're a big boy now...

243
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:06,450
yet you still poop in your pants...

244
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,489
Come here. Remember this,
you'll learn to read and write,

245
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:20,640
but you'll always be Olmo D'Alc?
the son of a peasant.

246
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,596
A poor unfortunate.

247
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,476
You'll serve in the army

248
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,200
and you'll see the world.
You must learn to obey.

249
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:34,555
And to be kicked in the ass!

250
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,039
You'll get married and will have to
work hard to raise your children.

251
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,360
- But who will you always be?
- Olmo D'Alc?

252
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:50,909
Olmo D'Alc? The peasant.

253
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,198
Understood?
No priests in this house.

254
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,279
- What have you got there?
- A coin. It's mine.

255
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,909
Mr. Giovanni gave it to me
in change for my frogs.

256
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,997
If it's yours then it's everyone's.

257
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,319
I'm flying!

258
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,720
Yes, fly, so the branch
will break, wet pants!

259
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:37,793
Alfredo, dinner's ready!

260
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,639
Listen to the Parisian!

261
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,231
"From the Ville Lumi?e
lots of love. Ottavio.

262
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:55,836
Alfredo!

263
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,199
"Love"! We haven't
seen him for a year!

264
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,320
- He doesn't feel at home here.
- He despises us.

265
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:08,468
He doesn't.

266
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,269
Your brother Ottavio
knows how to enjoy life.

267
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,040
Paris, Chez Maxime, cocotte...
we work and he eats up our money!

268
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:21,478
- That's not true. Alfredo, dinner's served!
- Regina!

269
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,655
- Give me the plate.
- Nice frogs.

270
00:36:27,755 --> 00:36:29,558
Really nice.

271
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,727
- Alfredo.
- I don't want them.

272
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,524
Eat and don't be a fool.

273
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,799
- They make me sick.
- Now I'll spank you!

274
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,640
When you're a soldier,
you'll have to eat all the ration.

275
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:50,438
Lies! Bullshits!

276
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,040
What did my brother say?

277
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,996
Regina.

278
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,040
- Who are those two girls?
- You ask me every night!

279
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:11,157
They're my sister
and her daughter Regina.

280
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,116
Alfredino... my supper.

281
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,874
Go, but hurry back.

282
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,759
He's getting worse every day.

283
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:39,920
- How long will he still live?
- Hey, he's 6 years younger than me!

284
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:43,196
And he's already dead for you!

285
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,359
Can you imagine if Ottavio
arrives for the funeral

286
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,879
and as he's the firstborn
he wants to be in command?

287
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,640
Ottavio is a real gentleman like me.
I wasn't born a nun!

288
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,110
I want to be a nun too!

289
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,278
- Do you want to fire a shot?
- Yes.

290
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,520
Put the rifle butt on your shoulder,
close your left eye,

291
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:25,795
look for the foresight.

292
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,713
Now look carefully.

293
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,309
- Do you see that family of sparrows?
- Yes.

294
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:36,230
- The black female with greedy eyes?
- Yes.

295
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:39,520
- It's your target.
- Bang! Bang!

296
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:43,638
You hit her! You stroke her!

297
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,959
My husband went to rack and ruin
and ran to South America

298
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,640
leaving me without money and
with a daughter. If I hadn't had you all...

299
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:01,393
I won't see my father anymore?

300
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,154
He's your new father now.
Aren't you, Giovanni?

301
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,480
Of course, if I don't
maintain them, who will?

302
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:15,712
But you keep calling me uncle.

303
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,800
- Here they are. I'll shoot Alcina!
- No, I'll shoot her.

304
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:28,239
Ready? Aim... Fire!

305
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,754
Good, between her eyes!

306
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,476
Ready? Aim... Fire!

307
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,276
What's happening?

308
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,876
I'll kill you!

309
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,750
What a jerk...

310
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,400
Go finish your dinner!

311
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,351
Now!

312
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,280
Shame on you too!

313
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,076
Go eat!

314
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,996
- Idiot!
- Aren't you ashamed at your age?

315
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,909
There's a gulf between us,
between me and you all!

316
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,519
Go on with your bullshit!

317
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,999
He buys machines,
while everything is going to hell.

318
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,791
You'll mower your butt
with that machine, Mr. Modernist!

319
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,516
Come on, eat!

320
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,080
Eat those frogs,
or you'll go to hell.

321
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:07,833
Shit face!

322
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,957
- Who taught you that?
- A friend of mine.

323
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,125
And no one will have my land,
not even a square yard of it!

324
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,479
You can say what you want
but your father has a thing for Ottavio.

325
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:26,160
I'm here only because I want
the land! All of it! Otherwise...

326
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:30,995
If you want to know the truth,
I've always envied Ottavio! Always!

327
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,799
I wish I could stay away
from this family problems!

328
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,352
Enjoy life! Eat up all the money
in 6 months! Have a new woman every day!

329
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,039
# Love is an arrow

330
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:56,311
# which brings my words to you... #

331
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,033
A fucking gulf.

332
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,399
Poor thing.
You didn't have to force him to eat!

333
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,835
He's my son, and no one
can tell me how to raise him.

334
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:25,765
Alfredo!

335
00:42:26,148 --> 00:42:29,112
Don't worry, when
he gets hungry he'll be back.

336
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:46,200
These aren't lice,
these are chickens!

337
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,236
Keep still.

338
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,320
You'll see, you'll look
like a nice ravish.

339
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:03,312
Don't move, stay still.

340
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,000
They'll never find me.
I'll leave with uncle Ottavio.

341
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:36,075
Alfredo?
Alfredo! where are you?

342
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,237
Get back home, Alfredo!

343
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,476
Hey you!

344
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,030
- Have you seen Alfredo?
- No.

345
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,833
Go to bed, bald head.

346
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,716
It's late.

347
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,359
Olmo! Olmo!

348
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,691
What do you want?

349
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:16,330
Come to bed, I can't sleep
when you're out at night.

350
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,479
If my father had been here
no one would have cut my hair.

351
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,560
Once I heard him call me
from the bottom of a well.

352
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:31,950
- Alfredo!
- Let's run away together!

353
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,675
He also called me from
an empty pumpkin: "Olmo!"

354
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,676
Alfredo!

355
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,193
And he called me
from a barrel of lambrusco wine.

356
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,276
Olmo!

357
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,551
- Alfredo?
- Olmo!

358
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,957
(SPEAKING DIALECT)

359
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,519
Hey carter, come back!

360
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,880
What a fool to leave a horse
in the middle of the road!

361
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:27,618
Come back at once!

362
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:30,356
Damn you!

363
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,596
I've not even got the strength
to give an order to a servant.

364
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,955
Listen... What lovely music.

365
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,698
Young people dance,

366
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:08,196
hug each other,

367
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,916
and make love before sunset.

368
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,238
There's no place for an old man here.

369
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,197
It's hot, master, isn't it?

370
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,839
- Who are you?
- I'm Irma, the daughter of Delina.

371
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,640
I've always walked barefoot,
and now my feet are swollen.

372
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:46,350
But they're nice, aren't they?
My mistress gave them to me.

373
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,358
Irma, follow me!

374
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,516
Come on!

375
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,313
Master?

376
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,513
Master?

377
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,916
Master?

378
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,678
Don't worry.

379
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,838
I'm not going to hurt you.

380
00:51:06,269 --> 00:51:07,024
Take it.

381
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,760
You scared me.

382
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,680
- Milk her.
- It's not milking time.

383
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:31,639
She's swollen, milk her.

384
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,636
Cows are full
of milk and shit.

385
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,998
We're all cursed.
Curse is inside us.

386
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,916
And it gets worse with age.

387
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,400
Do you know what
the worst curse is?

388
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:17,479
The hail?

389
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,190
The hail isn't a curse.

390
00:52:24,064 --> 00:52:26,595
Shit and milk in my head, that's it.

391
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,668
Not even war or pellagra are.

392
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,556
One is cursed when
it doesn't get hard anymore.

393
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,558
Milk and shit.

394
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,360
It's no use.

395
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,797
It doesn't want to get hard.

396
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,473
Put your hand inside.

397
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,870
Mr Alfredo,
no one can milk a bull.

398
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,790
Go back to dance.

399
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,600
- Go.
- I really can?

400
00:54:11,601 --> 00:54:14,592
Yes. Go, go.

401
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:22,870
Irma, when the party's
about to be over

402
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,790
- tell everyone I'm dead.
- Okay.

403
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,788
Tell them I'm dead
but they must keep dancing.

404
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,280
Will you remember? Dead.

405
00:54:39,281 --> 00:54:41,236
Okay.

406
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,479
Our master is dead.

407
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,438
Our master is dead!

408
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,869
Yes, our master is dead.

409
00:55:15,969 --> 00:55:18,312
- Is it the truth?
- Who knows.

410
00:55:18,412 --> 00:55:21,344
Take the water away!
Let's all get drunk!

411
00:55:21,463 --> 00:55:22,628
Fill it up.

412
00:55:22,856 --> 00:55:24,897
But the master
wants us to keep dancing.

413
00:55:24,997 --> 00:55:26,974
He wants
to rule after death too?

414
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:29,076
Let's play!

415
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,319
If you could see yourself, Mr. Alfredo!

416
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,117
You didn't die like a master!

417
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,280
And why did you untie all the cows?

418
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:32,840
To make me work harder?

419
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,716
Maybe...

420
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,839
Maybe the truth is

421
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,440
That when someone has nothing to do

422
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,399
they have too much time to think.

423
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,279
And thinking too much
they become dotards.

424
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:56,000
At least we knew each other,
I knew you were the one who ruled.

425
00:56:56,001 --> 00:56:59,356
Now it's a mess!

426
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,630
Who knows how everything will end.

427
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,199
"I, Alfredo Berlinghieri,

428
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,355
in possession of all my mental faculties

429
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,197
appoint as my sole heir

430
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,751
my youngest son Giovanni.

431
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,554
To my firstborn Ottavio

432
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,280
- What did he say?
- "My firstborn Ottavio".

433
00:57:40,281 --> 00:57:45,195
"I leave a life annuity

434
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,199
of 5,000 lire,

435
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,433
which he'll receive
for his lifetime

436
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,352
from my sole heir.

437
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,672
Moreover, I leave him

438
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,039
the flat I have in town,

439
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,794
provided that, unmistakably,

440
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:27,833
the entire Holding Berlinghieri..."

441
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,597
Go back to sleep,
your granny is not well.

442
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:40,877
"...the entire Holding Berlinghieri"

443
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,679
Granny!

444
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,479
Granny's dead!

445
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,031
"...id est nine-hundred hectares
of cultivations and the villa,

446
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,475
the machinery and the tools

447
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,158
and all the capital

448
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,596
consisting of cows

449
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,799
horses and swine

450
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:26,356
go to my son Giovanni."

451
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,999
This turban

452
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,028
was given to me by
a famous tiger hunter.

453
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,360
Uncle Ottavio, take me away with you.

454
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,120
Why, don't you like it here?

455
01:00:34,121 --> 01:00:36,759
Everyone's mean.

456
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,858
Where would you like to go?

457
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,623
- I'd like to sail.
- On a sailing boat?

458
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,030
Like this one?

459
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,116
What are you doing?

460
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,679
- Put it down!
- No!

461
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,194
You don't have to touch the silkworms!

462
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,759
- I touch them because I can!
- You're a fool!

463
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,121
I'm your master!

464
01:01:38,221 --> 01:01:41,152
The silkworms are mine,
you shouldn't come here.

465
01:01:41,252 --> 01:01:45,480
- Why?
- Because I feed them. Give me that!

466
01:01:45,481 --> 01:01:47,596
Why should I?

467
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,396
The silkworms are mine.

468
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,359
And the raisins.

469
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,160
And the mechanic rake.

470
01:02:03,161 --> 01:02:05,515
And the wheat.

471
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:12,833
And the cows, and the D'Alc?s family.

472
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,479
And you're mine too.

473
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,109
- Go to hell and give me the silkworm!
- No!

474
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,835
Go to hell!

475
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,913
Go to hell!

476
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,114
Now you're running? Coward!

477
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,748
Help me, or we'll both be spanked.

478
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,960
I can hurt you with a finger if I want.

479
01:02:56,961 --> 01:02:59,793
You make me laugh!

480
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,834
Here you are.

481
01:03:10,744 --> 01:03:13,941
There are only a few left.
The others have already nested.

482
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:18,400
Those aren't nests but cocoons.
I've seen one in a book.

483
01:03:18,401 --> 01:03:22,234
Take off those clothes,
they're all wet.

484
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:28,720
It's so light... Butterflies
come out of this hole.

485
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,319
I've never seen them.

486
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,950
Like my little sister. She was born
at night, then she flew away.

487
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,557
- Why did she fly away?
- Because she died.

488
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,715
When you die you don't fly away.

489
01:03:49,307 --> 01:03:50,958
They just put you in the ground.

490
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,035
Doesn't it hurt?

491
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,132
Hurt?

492
01:04:04,232 --> 01:04:07,258
- It seems hard.
- Show me yours.

493
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,676
It looks like a worm.
If you pull it, it'll become like mine.

494
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,950
- It doesn't.
- Pull harder.

495
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,203
It hurts.

496
01:04:26,636 --> 01:04:30,306
The worse for you. If you aren't
brave you aren't a socialist.

497
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,896
- What does it mean?
- I'm a socialist with holes in his pocket.

498
01:04:33,897 --> 01:04:39,105
- A socialist with holes in his pocket?
- Never mind. You don't understand anything.

499
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,840
- Come on, take this mantle.
- I don't want it!

500
01:04:43,841 --> 01:04:46,400
Don't act like a child!

501
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,636
It stopped hailing.

502
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,080
Come and see!

503
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,959
- What's that?
- It's the town.

504
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,838
That cannot be. It's too far away.

505
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,799
It's the town, I swear on God.

506
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:22,280
That's the Cathedral, I went there
with uncle Ottavio when I was small.

507
01:05:22,281 --> 01:05:27,400
- What tall houses!
- Those aren't houses, those are bell towers.

508
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,834
One of them is smoking!

509
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,036
- That's a factory!
- Who knows if they can see us too.

510
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:46,120
- Dad! We saw the town! It was big!
- Later.

511
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:47,759
Mr. Giovanni,

512
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,276
I don't remember another storm
like this one since I got married.

513
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,474
Call the men, and the labourers!

514
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,398
Make them come here!

515
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,360
- Orso!
- Orso!

516
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,220
- Duro!
- Duro!

517
01:06:06,221 --> 01:06:08,079
- Ceso!
- Ceso!

518
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,980
- Oreste!
- Oreste!

519
01:06:09,981 --> 01:06:11,790
- Moretto!
- Moretto!

520
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:13,599
- Vecio!
- Vecio!

521
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,400
- Bestione! Montanaro!
- Bestione, Montanaro!

522
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:20,358
Follow me, everyone!

523
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,673
To cut it short,
we lost everything.

524
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,358
Wine, tomatoes, potatoes,
grain, the whole harvest.

525
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:55,553
Therefore we must
all make sacrifices.

526
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,436
Don't we, Leo?

527
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,311
So? The cat stole your tongue?

528
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,110
Tell them how much wheat we lost.

529
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,879
- Half as much?
- At least.

530
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,040
Therefore it's simple. We
must live with half wage.

531
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:26,079
But when the harvest is double
we don't get double wage.

532
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:31,838
To be honest, if I had to
act out of my own interest,

533
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:37,919
I should send you all home,
especially you labourers!

534
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,599
You're a bunch of ignorants,
you should be grateful to me!

535
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,958
Because the only one
who's really losing here is me!

536
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,155
And by the way, who's the master?
Who rules here?

537
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,196
You.

538
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,280
We lost everything, didn't you hear me?

539
01:08:08,281 --> 01:08:13,115
And you have big ears too!

540
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,638
(SPEAKING DIALECT)

541
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,355
Let's get inside.

542
01:09:33,762 --> 01:09:35,380
Did you get hurt?

543
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,476
Yes.

544
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,674
- I got hurt working.
- Poor thing.

545
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,315
Dad, there's no more polenta.

546
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,119
Dad, I'm still hungry.

547
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,192
I'll make you forget you're hungry.

548
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,079
- Mr. Abele?
- Yes.

549
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,920
- News from the League!
- What do they say?

550
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:07,754
They said we gotta make a move,
they're preparing a strike.

551
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,037
- Where?
- Everywhere!

552
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,555
What's the matter then?

553
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,957
We all agree.
We'll go on strike.

554
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,476
Strike?

555
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,158
Do you know what strike means?

556
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,995
I asked you if you know
what it means.

557
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,767
It means I'll no longer
use these hands to work.

558
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:47,591
Good. He's right.

559
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:52,520
They won't sow, they
won't harvest the wheat.

560
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:56,399
They won't milk,
and so no more milk!

561
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,432
Everyone stands still,

562
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:06,880
and in the meantime the land
dies! Are you ready for that?

563
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:09,080
Yes. There's the League now.

564
01:12:09,081 --> 01:12:11,036
The League?

565
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,589
What's this League?

566
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:23,600
Did the League tell you
we'll end up eating grass?

567
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:27,354
And that we'll all get
mean? But really mean!

568
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:34,600
- Did they tell you this?
- Yes, the League is great and strong!

569
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:38,559
You want to know
what the League is?

570
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,871
Strike! Strike!

571
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:53,437
- Strike!
- Strike! - Strike!

572
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,154
I like this song.

573
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,750
Strike!

574
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,715
Poor things, they haven't
been milked for two days.

575
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:47,470
So? Are the maids on strike too?

576
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:51,680
Desolina, today you'll go
to the village to get some milk.

577
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:55,514
And don't stop talking to anyone!

578
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,028
That's crazy! We have to buy the milk
when the stable's full of cows!

579
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,034
Strikes are intolerably arrogant!

580
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,359
They're against civil principles.

581
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:16,720
Those people aren't reasonable,
the old man included!

582
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:19,519
They'll have to give up.

583
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,799
And cows will explode
and wheat will rot in the fields.

584
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,356
You, eat!

585
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,599
Listen:

586
01:14:31,646 --> 01:14:34,732
"Negotiations between
the Trade Union and

587
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:36,653
the Agrarian Association
have fallen through.

588
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,800
We'll send lancers
to the sites on strike.

589
01:14:40,801 --> 01:14:42,732
We'll reply to boycotts
boycotting the League."

590
01:14:42,832 --> 01:14:43,873
Stop it.

591
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,839
This is the Official Report!

592
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,840
"We'll reply to the strike with a lock-out.

593
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:52,359
We'll reply to violence with violence.

594
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:57,480
The whip is necessary against
subverting beastly instincts."

595
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,199
Granddad, who are the strike-breakers?

596
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,320
They're dogs who go
to work when the strike's on.

597
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:11,719
Why don't they like the strike?

598
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:15,080
Because they're poorer
and more ignorant than us.

599
01:15:15,081 --> 01:15:17,958
Granny, listen to the music!

600
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,039
I'm coming!

601
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,589
Lawyer you are here too?

602
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,036
Good morning Reverend.

603
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,196
Look!

604
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,878
Look how Mr Giovanni's running!

605
01:15:45,879 --> 01:15:49,117
Basetti works sitting, poor thing!

606
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,039
That one is Campanini!

607
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,560
There's the lawyer, and that
child with pigtails is his daughter.

608
01:15:57,561 --> 01:16:01,075
- All strike-breakers?
- All masters!

609
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,880
They're ridiculous!

610
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,612
Olmo!

611
01:16:26,122 --> 01:16:27,384
Olmo!

612
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:30,815
Come here!

613
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:36,718
Is that Socialism?

614
01:16:36,969 --> 01:16:42,769
The rich who sweat and
the poor who sit under a tree

615
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:47,349
doing nothing?
Too good to last.

616
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:51,529
- You're lucky, Olmo D'Alc?
- Why?

617
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:54,978
Why?

618
01:16:54,979 --> 01:16:59,655
It took me 73 years
to see masters work.

619
01:17:06,339 --> 01:17:10,457
Here, finish this trap for moles.

620
01:17:16,899 --> 01:17:18,855
Olmo.

621
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:24,378
Get some leaves,
fan me a little, will you?

622
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:35,248
The weather's going to change.

623
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:55,850
- Will you teach me to build traps?
- Shut up or you'll wake up granny.

624
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:03,818
How can he sleep with open eyes?

625
01:18:03,819 --> 01:18:06,856
He can do many things.
Once he saw Garibaldi!

626
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:13,378
Careful, if they catch you
with me they'll spank you.

627
01:18:13,379 --> 01:18:17,338
They won't. They know I'm a Socialist too.

628
01:18:19,059 --> 01:18:22,899
Come and see!
Now it looks like yours!

629
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,369
- What did you do?
- I pulled it.

630
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:29,008
Liar! You did this.

631
01:18:29,704 --> 01:18:34,732
- I'll teach you something.
- I know it. I'm a Socialist too.

632
01:18:59,264 --> 01:19:01,703
What's that dust cloud?

633
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:05,104
- Those are the children of the Bassa.
- Where are they going?

634
01:19:05,105 --> 01:19:09,903
- They're coming to Genova with us.
- To plant onions?

635
01:19:09,904 --> 01:19:14,644
No, they were sent here
after 3 months of strike.

636
01:19:14,645 --> 01:19:19,384
They've nothing left to eat, so
the Red Aid prepared a train

637
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:24,822
to Genova. Long live
the children of the Bassa!

638
01:19:29,904 --> 01:19:34,924
- What are you going to tell them?
- Wait, let me think carefully.

639
01:19:34,925 --> 01:19:38,538
The reformists want to give you
10 more cents per hour.

640
01:19:38,638 --> 01:19:40,069
Do they?

641
01:19:40,455 --> 01:19:45,984
Ten cents more per hour
multiplied 18 working hours

642
01:19:45,985 --> 01:19:48,343
makes about a million and a half!

643
01:19:48,344 --> 01:19:55,303
- Go drown in the channel!
- Be careful, you'll break my neck's BONDS.

644
01:19:55,304 --> 01:20:01,584
The revolutionaries say the land
must go to those who cultivate it

645
01:20:01,585 --> 01:20:06,578
and that there have to be
no slaves or masters. Understand?

646
01:20:06,864 --> 01:20:13,384
Yes I studied EYE-TALIAN!

647
01:20:13,385 --> 01:20:15,340
Italian!

648
01:20:15,704 --> 01:20:19,064
- I read it in the VACABULARY too.
- Vocabulary!

649
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:23,663
- I made up my mind!
- What?

650
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:27,423
I will say: long live the revolution!

651
01:20:27,424 --> 01:20:31,504
Long live the revolutionaries!
Long live the general strike!

652
01:20:31,505 --> 01:20:34,098
Hurray!

653
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:53,704
Sandrone, look who's
coming here. An officer.

654
01:20:53,705 --> 01:20:57,663
What's going to happen now?

655
01:20:57,864 --> 01:21:02,704
- Let's teach him a lesson. Fetch a bat.
- Yes!

656
01:21:02,705 --> 01:21:05,983
Let's see what they can really do.

657
01:21:05,984 --> 01:21:12,264
What happened? We found you!
We'll take you to prison!

658
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:16,815
- Enough now!
- Clear out!

659
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:23,540
Away!

660
01:21:33,704 --> 01:21:35,854
Come on kids!

661
01:21:46,304 --> 01:21:50,820
Aren't you ashamed
of getting angry with children?

662
01:22:00,104 --> 01:22:02,060
Clear the square!

663
01:22:10,184 --> 01:22:14,018
You're all corrupt! Go home!

664
01:22:19,384 --> 01:22:21,340
Olmo!

665
01:22:21,904 --> 01:22:24,657
Olmo, your bag!

666
01:23:03,344 --> 01:23:06,177
Olmo! Olmo!

667
01:23:38,144 --> 01:23:42,979
I'm not a coward Olmo.
I'm not a coward.

668
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:47,777
That's my house!

669
01:23:54,624 --> 01:23:58,014
Look! Look!

670
01:26:15,664 --> 01:26:19,864
Look at them! They're a disgrace to Italy!
Deserters, traitors!

671
01:26:19,865 --> 01:26:22,063
They look like criminals!

672
01:26:22,064 --> 01:26:25,898
They should be executed!

673
01:26:27,624 --> 01:26:30,223
Tura! Tura!

674
01:26:30,224 --> 01:26:37,619
Olmo, did they catch you too?
They're going to kill all of us!

675
01:26:37,704 --> 01:26:41,982
Damned be the king!
The hell with everyone!

676
01:26:44,144 --> 01:26:47,022
Olmo! Olmo!

677
01:27:53,024 --> 01:27:55,743
Regina, go away.

678
01:27:56,984 --> 01:28:02,944
Away! And change
your clothes, was is over!

679
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:06,144
- Yes, Lieutenant!
- Close the door!

680
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,620
Old fart!

681
01:28:19,144 --> 01:28:21,064
Son of a gun!

682
01:28:21,065 --> 01:28:23,020
Celso!

683
01:28:32,984 --> 01:28:34,940
Armida!

684
01:29:17,424 --> 01:29:20,423
I don't know what's
wrong with me, father,

685
01:29:20,424 --> 01:29:24,503
But I can't set my mind at rest
unless I find the three love oranges.

686
01:29:24,504 --> 01:29:30,104
Let me go and seek them.
The king said it was just a whim,

687
01:29:30,105 --> 01:29:33,414
but seeing him so thoughtful all the time..."

688
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:36,383
And? Keep reading!

689
01:29:46,424 --> 01:29:48,733
Anita, why did you stop reading?

690
01:30:12,544 --> 01:30:15,456
- You must be Olmo.
- I am.

691
01:30:17,104 --> 01:30:18,863
Who are you?

692
01:30:18,864 --> 01:30:21,458
Anita. Anita Furlan.

693
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,540
Venetian?

694
01:30:25,224 --> 01:30:28,580
- From Verona.
- Verona?

695
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,855
We set a camp in Verona.
Are you a refugee?

696
01:30:32,955 --> 01:30:33,764
Yes.

697
01:30:35,104 --> 01:30:38,062
I lost my family.

698
01:30:43,144 --> 01:30:45,100
Go now.

699
01:30:45,584 --> 01:30:47,343
It must be heavy.

700
01:30:47,344 --> 01:30:51,784
- Anita, how does the tale ends?
- Go ahead!

701
01:30:51,785 --> 01:30:54,856
- Please!
- Alright.

702
01:31:05,224 --> 01:31:07,023
At-tention!

703
01:31:07,024 --> 01:31:08,980
- Yes sir!
- Stand at ease!

704
01:31:15,984 --> 01:31:21,012
Dotard! You don't recognise
your friends? It's me, bonehead!

705
01:31:45,624 --> 01:31:49,014
Lieutenant, I'll demote you!

706
01:31:49,984 --> 01:31:54,614
War is over,
no one can give us orders now.

707
01:32:03,104 --> 01:32:05,703
Now I like you!

708
01:32:05,704 --> 01:32:08,457
Really? Then kiss me, my hero!

709
01:32:23,024 --> 01:32:25,944
No one took care of your silkworms.

710
01:32:25,945 --> 01:32:28,936
There's only mice in here now.

711
01:32:34,024 --> 01:32:36,174
Like in the trenches.

712
01:32:45,704 --> 01:32:51,184
Remember when we could see the town
from here but no one believed us?

713
01:32:51,185 --> 01:32:54,142
It seemed so close!

714
01:32:54,624 --> 01:32:57,980
Could you see
the war from here too?

715
01:33:14,344 --> 01:33:17,823
Master of the house,
may you rest in peace.

716
01:33:17,824 --> 01:33:24,377
Go to hell with your father,
your mother, etcetera. Amen.

717
01:33:37,504 --> 01:33:40,244
Olmo, put it back. That's not ours.

718
01:33:40,245 --> 01:33:42,983
Wasn't it half-and-half?

719
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:47,184
Olmo, when you were away
many things changed.

720
01:33:47,185 --> 01:33:49,023
We've always been
paid half harvest.

721
01:33:49,024 --> 01:33:52,464
The Master had to rent machines
and pay new labourers.

722
01:33:52,465 --> 01:33:55,581
- So what?
- It's been a bad year.

723
01:33:57,184 --> 01:34:00,303
Long live our hero!

724
01:34:00,304 --> 01:34:03,704
Even half harvest would be a theft,
because we're the ones who work!

725
01:34:03,705 --> 01:34:06,063
You don't even want to go fifty-fifty?

726
01:34:06,064 --> 01:34:08,903
Wanna know why I had
to hire so many labourers?

727
01:34:08,904 --> 01:34:13,424
Because you all went to die at war,

728
01:34:13,425 --> 01:34:19,344
- like idiots.
- Dad, you have no right to say that!

729
01:34:19,345 --> 01:34:22,564
Shut up and play with
tin soldiers if you wish.

730
01:34:22,565 --> 01:34:25,784
Wanna know how much it cost me
to keep you at home?

731
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:28,298
How much?

732
01:34:29,304 --> 01:34:33,784
- More than what you're worth.
- I wanted to go too, but you stopped me!

733
01:34:33,785 --> 01:34:35,183
Sure...

734
01:34:35,184 --> 01:34:38,779
That's a beautiful sword.

735
01:34:39,184 --> 01:34:42,602
Indeed it is.

736
01:34:42,603 --> 01:34:46,020
It's sharp too, very sharp.

737
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:48,619
Look, dad!

738
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:52,142
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

739
01:34:52,704 --> 01:34:56,617
Is that all you can do?

740
01:34:58,704 --> 01:35:03,424
When I was your age I got up
at 4 a.m. to check the stables.

741
01:35:03,425 --> 01:35:06,541
You all shouldn't forget that!

742
01:35:06,624 --> 01:35:09,303
I was the first to get up
in threshing times,

743
01:35:09,304 --> 01:35:14,059
and I was the last to go to sleep.
Try to deny it!

744
01:35:14,424 --> 01:35:17,823
Deny it if you can!

745
01:35:17,824 --> 01:35:23,137
- You're so good, little cousin.
- Thanks, I can do better.

746
01:35:25,144 --> 01:35:29,296
...to widen the farm.
These are no longer values!

747
01:35:29,584 --> 01:35:34,624
Respectability, devotion
to the Church, love for the land,

748
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:37,175
loyalty to one's family
and faith into the banks!

749
01:35:37,275 --> 01:35:38,792
Calm down please.

750
01:35:39,665 --> 01:35:43,942
And respect!
Respect! Respect! Respect!

751
01:35:44,264 --> 01:35:48,984
What the master means is
that there was no one left to work here,

752
01:35:48,985 --> 01:35:53,263
so he had to rent new machines

753
01:35:53,264 --> 01:35:58,577
which he paid grain for,
as he does with you all.

754
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:05,056
Machines which make life easier.
They're a change,

755
01:36:05,984 --> 01:36:07,863
they mean progress.

756
01:36:07,864 --> 01:36:11,573
They're great.

757
01:36:12,424 --> 01:36:14,380
Don't you agree?

758
01:36:18,464 --> 01:36:20,455
It's heavy, isn't it?

759
01:36:43,184 --> 01:36:45,175
Hey, what are you doing?

760
01:36:45,464 --> 01:36:47,420
Stop it!

761
01:36:48,264 --> 01:36:52,303
Stop it! The Army
didn't teach you anything?

762
01:36:52,304 --> 01:36:56,264
- Who's that?
- Attila Melanchini, my dad's new farmer.

763
01:36:56,265 --> 01:36:59,062
I'm a soldier like you.

764
01:36:59,304 --> 01:37:02,223
You heard the master.

765
01:37:02,224 --> 01:37:06,900
He gave you all what he could.

766
01:37:08,064 --> 01:37:11,659
From now on we'll work together.
By the way I understand you.

767
01:37:23,944 --> 01:37:26,060
No, Olmo! Olmo!

768
01:37:26,304 --> 01:37:28,056
Enough.

769
01:37:30,464 --> 01:37:33,695
Women, did you hear the master?

770
01:37:34,384 --> 01:37:38,264
It's our men's fault,
because they went to die in war.

771
01:37:38,265 --> 01:37:41,264
It's the labourers' fault too
because they work,

772
01:37:41,265 --> 01:37:43,983
and want to be paid for it.

773
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:48,824
It's our fault, because we get hungry
and catch pellagra!

774
01:37:48,825 --> 01:37:53,454
And it's also our fault if
2 out of 3 of our kids die!

775
01:37:55,824 --> 01:37:57,823
The master won't be ruined

776
01:37:57,824 --> 01:38:02,104
if we take some more of our grain
and leave the rest to him.

777
01:38:02,105 --> 01:38:05,062
Come on, help yourselves.

778
01:38:10,664 --> 01:38:14,504
- You speak too well to be a peasant.
- I'm a teacher.

779
01:38:14,505 --> 01:38:18,304
You're the first educated
girlfriend I've ever had.

780
01:38:18,305 --> 01:38:20,374
Excuse me, teacher.

781
01:38:22,704 --> 01:38:24,934
Are you done with your lesson?

782
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:32,304
Here comes the rooster!
Peck this!

783
01:38:32,305 --> 01:38:36,624
Peep peep peep!

784
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:38,580
Enough! Stop it!

785
01:38:39,104 --> 01:38:41,060
Alright then.

786
01:39:06,504 --> 01:39:08,383
What happened?
Where are you going?

787
01:39:08,384 --> 01:39:11,115
To celebrate Saint Martin.
It's November 11th.

788
01:39:11,193 --> 01:39:12,418
We were evicted.

789
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:16,663
Farmers always take advantage!

790
01:39:16,664 --> 01:39:20,064
They evicted us before
the expiry of our contracts.
