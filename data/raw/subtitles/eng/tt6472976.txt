<i>Human touch.</i>

3
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:38,865
<i>Our first form
of communication.</i>

4
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:41,866
<i>Safety, security, comfort,</i>

5
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:44,737
<i>all in the gentle caress
of a finger.</i>

6
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:47,940
<i>Or the brush of lips
on a soft cheek.</i>

7
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,610
<i>It connects us

<i>and love.</i>

11
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:07,491
<i>We need that touch
from the one we love</i>

12
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:09,762
<i>almost as much
as we need air to breathe.</i>

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:14,667
<i>But I never understood
the importance of touch.</i>

14
00:01:15,768 --> 00:01:17,069
<i>His touch.</i>

15
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:22,407
<i>Until I couldn't have it.</i>

16
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:45,930
Oh!

17
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:47,665
Oh, yeah.

18
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,434
Oh, yeah. This one's perfect.

19
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:53,604
Actually, though,
the tan lines
might be incredible.

20
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:56,173
Oh, my gosh. That doesn't even
cover half your boob.

21
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,512
This is actually cute.

22
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:02,847
that's actually really cute.

23
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:04,181
Let me see.

24
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:05,115
I like that.

25
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:06,717
Oh, yeah, that's actually
really pretty.

26
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,619
But I can't tell,
is it too trampy

27
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,487
or not trampy enough?

28
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:11,490
Hello!

29
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,123
Are you with us?

30
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,658
Okay, guess what.

31
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,527
Taylor and Mason
are meeting us

32
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:17,864
at the airport in the morning.

33
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:19,530
What's that face?

34
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:20,731
Oh, my God!

35
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,033
I know. I know, I know!

36
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:24,835
Dude,
Mason and Brooke broke up.

37
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:26,570
No, they didn't.

38
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:28,138
Oh, my God! Maya!

39
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,040
You're gonna do it!

40
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:33,012
I wish I could be there
to see that in person.

41
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,615
Just sucks
that you planned it this year

42
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:38,618
and you don't even get to go.

43
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:41,386
Well,

44
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:45,623
you can just Photoshop me in
with your fancy editing apps.

45
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,490
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:47,457
You know
what I'm talking about.

47
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,259
Why are you laughing?
No, I don't.

48
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:49,894
The one
where you get your pimples

49
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:51,629
and your little fake blush.

50
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,763
Shut up.

51
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,765
The lashes! Your lashes
aren't that long in real life.

52
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:55,833
You guys
are so annoying.

53
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,803
Okay, come on.
Thank you for the burgers.

54
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,572
Honestly, you guys
are gonna have so much fun.

55
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:02,773
Okay?

56
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:03,941
Bye. I love you.

57
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:05,042
I love you more.

58
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:06,176
I love you.

59
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:07,745
Miss you. Bye.

60
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,713
Mwah. Use protection.

61
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:11,117
Thanks, Mom.

62
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:01,832
So, I am back
in the hospital again

63
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,067
for another tune-up.

64
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,569
I need a few more rounds
of antibiotics

65
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:06,937
to get over
this little sore throat

66
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:08,105
that I've been...

67
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:09,640
Hi, Barb!

68
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:10,876
Sore throat?

69
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,577
Right, with a 102 fever?

70
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,012
I've had worse.
Say hi!

71
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,580
Stella, get that thing
out of my face.

72
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:18,215
You're looking good!

73
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,251
Stella will be right back
after we get her all set up.

74
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:22,955
You heard the boss lady.

75
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:27,691
I think this is her best work.

76
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,229
Wow.

77
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,832
Wow. A lot's changed
in the last six months.

78
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:35,899
Yep.

79
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,234
He's due in March.

80
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,836
Bend your arm, please.

81
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:39,903
What room's Poe in?

82
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,005
310.

83
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:45,511
And open up.

84
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:49,181
All right.

85
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,185
You are all set.

86
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:56,587
I'll see you in a bit.

87
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,921
Thank you, Julie.

88
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:01,792
Wow.

89
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:03,127
Are you sure this is okay?

90
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:05,162
I will still
be monitoring you.

91
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:07,698
And, yes, it's okay.

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,266
What would I do without you?

93
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,168
You'd die.

94
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,004
That's true.

95
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:16,040
So, Barb is letting me keep

96
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,275
my med cart
in my room this time.

97
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,077
And she left me
a bunch of pills,

98
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,246
some G-Juice.

99
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:24,982
Yum!
That's the liquid nutrition

100
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:26,283
that goes
straight to my stomach

101
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,718
through my G-tube.

102
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,920
So, to any of you girls
out there

103
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,222
wishing you could eat
5,000 calories a day

104
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:33,824
and not gain a pound,

105
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:35,594
I'll trade you any day.

106
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:40,130
Today I'll probably
be reorganizing this thing

107
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:44,234
because as many of you know,
I'm slightly anal.

108
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:47,306
By slightly anal,
I mean clinically OCD.

109
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,740
So, peace.

110
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:50,841
Bye, guys.

111
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:31,343
New baby upstairs.

112
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,412
Meet me in 15.

113
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,051
Hi, Cynthia.

114
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:40,686
Hi, Stella.

115
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:42,888
Hi.

116
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:58,936
I've already clocked
the nurse's schedule,

117
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:00,470
so unless you plant your ass
on that call button,

118
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:01,939
no one's gonna bother you
for, like, an hour.

119
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,841
Hey. I gotta sleep
on that bed, okay?

120
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:07,010
Wow. I mean,
we're not animals.

121
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,012
Don't worry, it's not even
gonna take that long.

122
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,114
Hey!
Whatchu talkin' about, Willis?

123
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:31,203
Okay, bye.

124
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,043
Saw you moving in your stuff.

125
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:14,311
It was, uh...

126
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:15,914
There was a lot of it.

127
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:18,417
Are you gonna be here
for a while?

128
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,820
Hello?

129
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:26,225
Oh.

130
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:28,794
You're deaf.

131
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:32,029
Shouldn't you be
procuring your room

132
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,397
for your guests?

133
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,465
You rent by the hour or what?

134
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:37,901
So, that was you
lurking in the hall.

135
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:40,404
Mmm, I don't lurk,
and you followed me here.

136
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:42,406
I wanted to introduce myself,

137
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:45,042
but that little attitude
of yours...

138
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,644
Let me guess.
You're the kind of guy

139
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:47,645
that ignores the rules

140
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:50,049
'cause it makes you feel
in control. Am I right?

141
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:51,582
You're not wrong.

142
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:52,885
You think that's cute?

143
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:54,820
Do you think it's cute?

144
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:58,288
Letting your friends
borrow your room for sex

145
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,590
is disgusting, so, no.

146
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:00,891
You don't like sex?

147
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,394
No, I like

148
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,331
sex. I like sex.

149
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,498
Sex is fine.

150
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:10,568
Fine isn't exactly
a ringing endorsement,

151
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,570
but I'll take some common
ground where I can get it.

152
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:14,104
We have nothing in common.

153
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,140
Ooh, that's cold.

154
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:18,944
What...
What are you doing up here?

155
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:22,547
Six feet at all times.
You both know the rules.

156
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,649
Will, get back to your room.

157
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:25,618
There you go.

158
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:29,589
A little name for
your psychological profile.

159
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:31,323
I'm Will Newman.

160
00:10:31,624 --> 00:10:33,025
And you are?

161
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:34,293
Deaf.

162
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,627
Stella, thank you
for putting your mask back on.

163
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,263
Stella.

164
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,899
You need to lighten up.

165
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:42,868
It's just life.

166
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,404
It'll be over
before you know it.

167
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,046
So, he's a CFer?

168
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:57,182
B. cepacia.

169
00:10:57,717 --> 00:11:01,186
Part of a new drug trial
for Cevaflomalin.

170
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,923
You contract that
and you can...

171
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:08,160
You can kiss the possibility
of new lungs goodbye.

172
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:12,131
There's no coming back
from that bacteria.

173
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:14,400
Stay away.

174
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:41,659
<i>Hello, world.</i>

175
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:44,261
Okay, AffloVest
for 30 more minutes,

176
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:45,262
then you're all set.

177
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,498
You need anything else
before I hit the road?

178
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,700
Chocolate pudding for two?

179
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:51,536
Oh, so, what?
I'm room service now?

180
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:54,104
Gotta take
advantage of the perks.

181
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:00,112
All right.

182
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,714
Good girl, good girl.

183
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:06,018
All right, good.
Right.

184
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,351
Right, sweetie.

185
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,453
I'll see you tomorrow.

186
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:10,521
Bye, Barb.

187
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:11,524
Okay.

188
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,333
<i>Like
all kids with cystic fibrosis,</i>

189
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:24,502
<i>I was born terminal,</i>

190
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:28,438
<i>which doesn't necessarily mean
I'm gonna die tomorrow,</i>

191
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,674
<i>but I could die tomorrow.</i>

192
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,107
<i>Anyone could die tomorrow.</i>

193
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,477
<i>I just have
a little bit less time</i>

194
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,511
<i>than everyone else.</i>

195
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:38,081
<i>My lungs are at about
50% function right now.</i>

196
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,349
<i>So at this rate,</i>

197
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:41,686
<i>Dr. Hamid says
that I'll need a transplant</i>

198
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:44,256
<i>by the time
I'm a junior in high school.</i>

199
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,125
<i>That'll be fun.</i>

200
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:49,596
<i>Hi, guys! Shh!</i>

201
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:51,696
<i>We're at the NICU</i>

202
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:53,564
<i>because I'm obsessed
with babies.</i>

203
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,232
<i>And Barb...</i>

204
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,702
<i>The beautiful Barb
is giving me permission</i>

205
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:59,604
<i>to come in here by myself now.</i>

206
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:02,740
<i>Cystic fibrosis, as you know,
is a genetic disease</i>

207
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:05,843
<i>that basically makes my body
produce a shit ton of mucus.</i>

208
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:09,246
<i>Fun fact, I have to be
extremely careful</i>

209
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,648
<i>around other people with CF.</i>

210
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,816
<i>The rule is that we're not</i>

211
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:13,618
<i>supposed to get
within six feet</i>

212
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,085
<i>because we could end up</i>

213
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,419
<i>catching
each other's bacteria.</i>

214
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,856
<i>A lot of people
don't realize that new lungs</i>

215
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:21,759
<i>generally only last
about five years,</i>

216
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:26,263
<i>which is okay actually
because most of us</i>

217
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,231
<i>are just trying to stay alive
long enough</i>

218
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,166
<i>for a new treatment
to come out.</i>

219
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:34,471
<i>Just chilling here
in my new AffloVest,</i>

220
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:35,640
<i>which is really cool</i>

221
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:38,408
<i>because now I don't have to be
hooked up to the wall,</i>

222
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,442
<i>which obviously I'm not</i>

223
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,746
<i>because I'm hanging
upside down on my bed.</i>

224
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:44,347
<i>This is actually good</i>

225
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:46,316
<i>for getting the mucus up
and stuff.</i>

226
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:47,618
<i>I know, cute, right?</i>

227
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:10,743
<i>Dang, girl.</i>

228
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,612
<i>You look worn.</i>

229
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:14,313
<i>Who is he?</i>

230
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:16,379
<i>Is it anyone I know?</i>

231
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,252
<i>What'd you get?</i>

232
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:24,254
<i>What?</i>

233
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:27,157
Are those truffles?
How'd you get truffles?

234
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,593
<i>Oh, you gotta
bring them with, sister.</i>

235
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:29,596
Wow.

236
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:33,800
Look at how spicy
that food cart is.

237
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:35,365
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

238
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,934
<i>All right,
let's talk about me.</i>

239
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:39,539
I'm single!

240
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:41,706
You broke up with Michael?

241
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,509
<i>Maybe he broke up with me.</i>

242
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:44,809
Did he?

243
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:46,178
It was mutual.

244
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,679
No, it wasn't.

245
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:51,849
<i>Why? You actually
really liked him.</i>

246
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,820
<i>And I thought
he was gonna be the one.</i>

247
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:55,755
He obviously isn't.

248
00:14:58,423 --> 00:14:59,659
<i>Screw him anyway, right?</i>

249
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,792
At least you got to do that.

250
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,228
Poe?

251
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:12,371
Poe?

252
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:14,304
Poe, you okay?

253
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:16,909
Choking, 310.

254
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:21,879
I'm sorry, Julie.

255
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,748
My leg hit the call button.

256
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,485
You scared us, Poe.

257
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:28,855
Yeah, try chewing next time.

258
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:30,723
Here, Stella.

259
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,625
Enjoy your truffles, asshole.

260
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,598
And please be careful.

261
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:40,931
I love you, Stella.

262
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:43,834
Phase one clinical trials

263
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:45,335
only started
only 18 months ago,

264
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:47,270
so we need to be patient

265
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:49,607
and Will needs to help us
with that.

266
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:52,375
The risk of cross infection
will be even higher now, so...

267
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:55,278
Don't cough
on any other CFers.

268
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,815
Well, don't get close enough
to touch them

269
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:59,819
for their safety and yours.

270
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,855
Six feet at all times.
I got it.

271
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,628
Will, in order for this
to work,

272
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:11,196
you need to keep up
with your regimen.

273
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,537
Okay, I will see you soon.

274
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,000
You're wearing
the bathing suit!

275
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:52,903
<i>Hi!</i>

276
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:56,507
Oh, I'm officially jealous.
That looks so fun!

277
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,576
<i>We miss you!</i>

278
00:16:58,578 --> 00:16:59,710
I miss you, too!

279
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:01,781
<i>You have
any cute boy visitors?</i>

280
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:04,382
No. No. He's not cute.

281
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,651
<i>What?</i>

282
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:07,551
<i>Boy?</i>

283
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:09,520
What?

284
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,725
<i>Show us! Show us!</i>

285
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,536
What are you doing?

286
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:00,540
Do you have a death wish
or something?

287
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:02,041
Hey!

288
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,974
My lungs are toast, okay?

289
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:08,413
Can you just let me enjoy
this view while I can?

290
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,516
Do you know how lucky
you are to be here?

291
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:14,720
To be a part of
this drug trial?

292
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:17,824
How do you know
about my drug trial?

293
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:20,493
You been asking about me?

294
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,894
Ugh.

295
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:24,864
If you don't care,

296
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:27,033
then leave.

297
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,099
Give your spot
to someone else.

298
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,971
Someone that wants it,
that wants to live.

299
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,375
Okay.

300
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:41,645
What are you doing?
Will?

301
00:18:43,716 --> 00:18:45,482
Will, stop, please!

302
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:47,450
Please get down now!

303
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:49,720
Will, stop!
Oh, my God!

304
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,794
God!

305
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:56,863
Relax!

306
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:02,635
Fine.

307
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:05,638
Stay up here then.

308
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,008
Come on. It was a joke.

309
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,077
Hey, it was a joke.

310
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:03,996
Damn it!

311
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,953
Where's your med cart,
and your pills,

312
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:31,055
and why's your AffloVest
on the floor?

313
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,192
Can... Can I see your regimen?

314
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:37,663
Uh... Not that it's
any of your business...

315
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,707
Is this... What?

316
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,274
Why would...

317
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:52,209
Is this what an aneurysm
looks like?

318
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,613
Why? Ugh!

319
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,714
Look, I get that you have
some kind of

320
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:58,215
save-the-world hero complex
going on,

321
00:20:58,217 --> 00:20:59,783
but can you leave me
out of it?

322
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:00,951
These meds are not optional.

323
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:01,819
Yeah, that's probably why

324
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:03,155
they keep shoving them
down my throat.

325
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:05,091
You're making me crazy.

326
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:13,165
Hey.

327
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:15,801
Stella, come on!

328
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:18,738
Six feet!

329
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:40,858
I need you
to follow your regimen

330
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,062
strictly and completely,
please.

331
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,195
Why don't...

332
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:48,298
Why don't you tell me
what's going on, actually?

333
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,969
Talk to me. I'm not gonna make
any jokes or laugh.

334
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,108
I have control issues.

335
00:21:57,143 --> 00:22:00,344
And I need to know
that things are in order,

336
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:02,312
and I know that you're
not doing your treatments

337
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:05,115
and it's really,
really messing me up.

338
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:08,018
Okay, I wanna help you.

339
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,021
I do.

340
00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:13,657
I don't even know how to do
what you're asking me to.

341
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:14,825
That's bullshit!

342
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:17,027
That's bullshit!
All CFers know

343
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:18,095
how to administer
their own treatments.

344
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:20,130
We're practically doctors
by the time we're 12.

345
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,365
Are you serious?

346
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,634
Am I actually messing you up?

347
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:24,637
Yes.

348
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:27,239
All right.

349
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,241
I'll help you.

350
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:31,343
But if I do,

351
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,748
what's in it for me?

352
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:38,715
No, not like...

353
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:41,754
I... I wanna draw you.

354
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:43,921
No.

355
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:45,858
Why not? I'm serious.

356
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:47,226
No.

357
00:22:52,064 --> 00:22:53,099
Okay.

358
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:55,701
Then no deal.

359
00:22:56,902 --> 00:22:59,236
You really can't practice just
a little bit of discipline

360
00:22:59,238 --> 00:23:00,871
even to save your own life?

361
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:03,674
Stella, nothing is going to
save our lives.

362
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:05,744
We're breathing borrowed air.

363
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:07,847
Enjoy it.

364
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:24,128
Fine.

365
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,230
But I'm not posing
for hours on end.

366
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,031
And your regimen,
we're doing it my way.

367
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,166
Okay, the first thing
you're gonna do

368
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:30,769
is get a med cart
in your room. Deal?

369
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:33,772
Deal.

370
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:35,107
Shake on it?

371
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:40,746
Funny.

372
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:56,729
Shit!

373
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:01,901
Oh, God, no, no, no!

374
00:24:03,135 --> 00:24:04,136
Hey.

375
00:24:06,805 --> 00:24:08,005
You missed the show.

376
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:09,840
Yeah.
You doing stunts in there?

377
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:11,975
Well, there's no better place
to break a leg.

378
00:24:11,977 --> 00:24:13,145
That's fair.

379
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:14,380
I'm Will.

380
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:18,951
I'm Poe.

381
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:21,987
B. cepacia.

382
00:24:23,022 --> 00:24:24,356
Damn, that's rough.

383
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:26,458
Yeah.

384
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,359
So, no lung transplant for me.

385
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:30,928
When did you contract it?

386
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,397
About eight months ago now.
It colonized so quickly.

387
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:36,035
I was on the transplant list
one minute and then...

388
00:24:40,206 --> 00:24:42,472
I'm sure that attitude
is what's giving Stella fits.

389
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:44,074
Yeah, what's up with that?

390
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:46,544
She told me that she has
control issues or something.

391
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:48,445
Call it what you want,
she's got her shit together.

392
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,249
She definitely keeps me
in line.

393
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,817
So, uh,

394
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:54,220
have you two...

395
00:24:55,888 --> 00:24:58,090
No.

396
00:24:58,324 --> 00:24:59,890
No, no, no.

397
00:24:59,892 --> 00:25:02,428
I've known that girl
since I was, like, seven.

398
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,895
I don't know, man.

399
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,296
Sounds like you love her.

400
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:07,931
Of course, I love her.

401
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:10,200
So, why haven't you done
anything about it?

402
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:11,370
Because

403
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:13,872
she's not a he.

404
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:21,345
Don't worry.
I don't like white boys.

405
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:32,523
Dr. Hamid said
that you suddenly

406
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:34,994
wanna be responsible
for your own regimen.

407
00:25:35,595 --> 00:25:37,497
Don't make me regret this.

408
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,840
Did you wipe everything down?

409
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,512
Yes. This wasn't
my idea, you know?

410
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:56,947
Are we still clear?

411
00:25:56,949 --> 00:25:58,450
Yes. Hurry up.

412
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,153
I'm almost done.

413
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,623
Okay. Your med cart's
all set up.

414
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,558
I built an app
for chronic illnesses.

415
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,925
It'll alert you when to do

416
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:43,126
your treatments,
and take your pills...

417
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:44,662
Built an app?

418
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:46,198
Like you built it?

419
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:47,833
Surprise.

420
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,000
It's pretty simple.

421
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:51,437
You should be able
to figure it out.

422
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,501
<i>Okay, Stella.</i>

423
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:25,670
Don't tell me that
the one time you're interested

424
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:27,938
in some guy, he's a CFer.

425
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,042
I just helped him set up
his med cart.

426
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:32,442
That... That's it.
That's all!

427
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,044
I know you, Stella.

428
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:36,215
Organizing a med cart
is like foreplay.

429
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:41,954
They're called manners!

430
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,169
<i>Are you doing your AffloVest?</i>

431
00:27:58,137 --> 00:27:59,238
Yeah.

432
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:00,673
<i>Show me.</i>

433
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:03,676
I can't.
I'm half-naked.

434
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:07,010
You're supposed to be doing
your AffloVest right now,

435
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:08,180
and did you take your Creon?

436
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:11,551
Are those the suppositories?

437
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:14,652
Okay.

438
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:16,219
<i>Okay, I can't trust you,</i>

439
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:18,388
<i>so this is how
it's gonna work.</i>

440
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,023
<i>We're gonna do
our treatments together</i>

441
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:21,759
so that way I know you're
actually doing them.

442
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:23,026
Okay?

443
00:28:23,028 --> 00:28:24,361
<i>Always looking for ways</i>

444
00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:26,396
<i>to spend more time with me,
aren't you, Stella?</i>

445
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:27,399
Bye.

446
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:30,969
I've been doing this
since I was a little kid.

447
00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:35,071
So you just pour them all
in the pudding

448
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:36,774
and stir it around.
Are you doing that?

449
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,361
Good night.

450
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:36,435
The Divorce Diet
doesn't look good on you, Mom.

451
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:38,503
What are you talking about?

452
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:40,470
You're too thin.
Dad needs a bath.

453
00:29:40,472 --> 00:29:41,608
You guys are stealing my look.

454
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,009
I'm stealing your look?

455
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:45,375
Mmm-hmm.

456
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:47,177
Okay, maybe I need this
more than you do.

457
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:49,312
No!

458
00:29:49,314 --> 00:29:50,483
Oh, my God!

459
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:52,750
How did that happen?

460
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:54,284
How did it happen?

461
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:55,452
Oh, man!

462
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:56,789
Give me napkins.

463
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,391
Aw, here, honey.

464
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:19,746
I love you so much.

465
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:24,416
I know.
I love you, too.

466
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:28,220
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

467
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:38,596
How does it feel?

468
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:40,533
Not great.

469
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:43,568
Let's try some Bactroban,

470
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,802
see how it looks
in a day or two.

471
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:46,469
Maybe we can clear it up, huh?

472
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:50,375
Oh. I'll be at the gym.

473
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:52,442
Thanks, Doc!

474
00:30:57,784 --> 00:31:00,185
Hey, you know, this sucks.

475
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:04,356
When does this deal of ours
become mutually beneficial?

476
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:06,924
I've done everything
you've asked

477
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:09,328
with no return
on my investment.

478
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:12,697
You really wanna draw me
after we work out?

479
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:14,199
Yeah.

480
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:15,602
No.

481
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:18,836
I'm gross, and sweaty,
and smell.

482
00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:20,871
"My hair is dirty.

483
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:22,840
"I'm too tired.

484
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:24,677
"My med cart is messy."

485
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:26,111
Fine.

486
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:29,181
I'll sweat harder then.
Just for you.

487
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:32,315
I'm going to draw that sweat.

488
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:43,462
What's that?

489
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:45,565
My to-do list.

490
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:47,500
To-do list?

491
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:51,434
That's pretty old-fashioned
for someone that builds apps.

492
00:31:51,436 --> 00:31:53,269
Yeah, well,
the app doesn't give me

493
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:55,440
the satisfaction of doing

494
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:57,142
that.

495
00:32:01,446 --> 00:32:03,650
What else is on
that to-do list of yours?

496
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:05,950
My master list
or my daily list?

497
00:32:05,952 --> 00:32:07,920
Yeah, of course
you have two lists.

498
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:10,657
The master list.
That's the big stuff, right?

499
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:12,923
Okay.

500
00:32:12,925 --> 00:32:15,826
Volunteer in an important
political campaign.

501
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:16,794
Done.

502
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:18,729
Study all the works of
William Shakespeare.

503
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:19,732
Done.

504
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,465
Share everything I know
about CF with other people.

505
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:23,734
That's my YouTube page.

506
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:26,839
So, your plan
is to die really smart

507
00:32:27,305 --> 00:32:28,572
so that you can join

508
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:30,242
the debate team of the dead
or something?

509
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:32,679
What about
traveling the world?

510
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:40,918
Learn to play piano.

511
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,187
Done.

512
00:32:42,488 --> 00:32:44,722
Speak fluent French.

513
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:49,227
Can you look at me for a sec?

514
00:32:50,496 --> 00:32:51,696
You wanna hear my list?

515
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:52,665
No.

516
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:56,201
Painting class with Bob Ross.

517
00:32:57,904 --> 00:33:00,638
He's dead.

518
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,809
Yeah, never mind. Uh...

519
00:33:03,876 --> 00:33:05,410
Sex in the Vatican.

520
00:33:05,978 --> 00:33:08,881
I'd rather help you
meet Bob Ross.

521
00:33:10,683 --> 00:33:11,684
I don't know.

522
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,287
I'd like to travel the world.

523
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:17,822
Actually get to see some of it

524
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,960
and not the inside
of these hospitals.

525
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:29,334
Thank you.

526
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:31,771
For what?

527
00:33:33,338 --> 00:33:34,974
For saying something real.

528
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:40,980
Was it the Vatican thing?

529
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:43,616
Can you hurry up?

530
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:04,001
<i>Okay. I just thought
you might want to know</i>

531
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:05,536
<i>how this feels. You ready?</i>

532
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:06,839
<i>And I brought a jumping buddy.</i>

533
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:09,474
<i>Don't worry.
I'll hold him tight.</i>

534
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:12,109
<i>All right, Abby,
ready to jump out of a plane?</i>

535
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:13,376
<i>Ready!</i>

536
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:15,047
<i>Happy Birthday, Stella.</i>

537
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:31,731
<i>I love you, Stella.
I'll see you soon.</i>

538
00:34:32,632 --> 00:34:33,800
I love you, too.

539
00:34:45,611 --> 00:34:47,511
I like seeing you like this.

540
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:48,813
Like what?

541
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:50,448
Hopeful.

542
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:53,753
All right.

543
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:57,089
Hey, Julie.

544
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,495
What if this doesn't work?

545
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,565
What if it does?

546
00:35:45,705 --> 00:35:47,137
Ha-ha!

547
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,348
<i>Why cartoons?</i>

548
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:57,683
<i>They're subversive.</i>

549
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:01,785
<i>They can be light and funny
but pack a powerful punch.</i>

550
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:03,554
<i>I think a well-drawn cartoon</i>

551
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:05,189
<i>can say a lot more
than words ever could.</i>

552
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:06,557
Yeah?

553
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,861
<i>What does this say exactly?</i>

554
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:12,698
A lot more than words
ever could.

555
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:14,967
<i>I think it's actually
pretty good.</i>

556
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,103
<i>I think that's really good.
Behind you.</i>

557
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,738
<i>What is that?</i>

558
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:21,471
<i>Oh, those are lungs.
That's brilliant.</i>

559
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:22,673
<i>Did you do that?</i>

560
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:25,609
Uh, no, my older sister, Abby.

561
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:26,679
<i>Wow. She's really good.</i>

562
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,181
I'd love to see more of
her stuff. Do you have any?

563
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,152
<i>We don't have to, uh,
share our stories, okay?</i>

564
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:37,590
<i>We can just do
our treatments together.</i>

565
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,098
<i>Hey, guys!
I have to get a nasal poly...</i>

566
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,166
Polypectomy.

567
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,702
We're removing polyps
from your nasal passages.

568
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:53,070
And Stella's nervous.

569
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:54,972
But I'm gonna be there
to sing her to sleep.

570
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:56,874
Just like always.

571
00:36:56,876 --> 00:36:59,610
<i>♪ I love you
A bushel and a peck ♪</i>

572
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:00,678
<i>♪ A bushel and a peck ♪</i>

573
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,712
Don't sing
the whole thing yet.

575
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:04,148

But seriously.

580
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,057
I'm gonna be there
when you go to sleep

581
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:14,894
and I'm gonna be right here
when you wake up.

582
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:17,964
Okay?

583
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:20,066
Okay.

584
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:22,702
I love you.

585
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,503
I love you, too.

586
00:37:24,737 --> 00:37:26,303
<i>My sister, Abby,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

587
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:28,572
<i>She's single, by the way.</i>

588
00:37:28,574 --> 00:37:29,942
<i>Her digits are...</i>

589
00:37:30,743 --> 00:37:31,976
That was last year.

590
00:37:31,978 --> 00:37:34,146
Abby's not in any of
the videos after that.

591
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:36,080
I found Abby's Instagram.

592
00:37:36,082 --> 00:37:38,015
I mean, it's mostly art,

593
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:40,617
her and Stella,
but you're right.

594
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,488
I mean,
she hasn't posted in a year.

595
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:57,201
Barb didn't see you come in,
did she?

596
00:37:57,203 --> 00:37:58,537
No.

597
00:38:10,683 --> 00:38:12,151
Abby's dead, isn't she?

598
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:18,090
You're as delicate
as a jackhammer.

599
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:22,028
We don't have time for
delicacy, Stella. We're dying.

600
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:26,132
Can you stop reminding me
that I'm dying?

601
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:28,966
I get it. I get that.

602
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:30,868
Okay? I just can't.

603
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,903
I have been dying
my whole life.

604
00:38:32,905 --> 00:38:35,906
Every birthday, we celebrated
it like it was my last one.

605
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:37,608
I know. Me, too.

606
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,646
Because then, yeah,
as you pointed out, Abby died.

607
00:38:42,782 --> 00:38:44,381
And then
my parents' marriage died.

608
00:38:44,383 --> 00:38:46,884
And it was supposed to be me.

609
00:38:46,886 --> 00:38:48,685
Everyone was ready for that.

610
00:38:48,687 --> 00:38:50,120
Everyone was prepared
for that.

611
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,924
I just, I can't die.

612
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,295
I just... My parents...
I can't.

613
00:38:57,229 --> 00:38:59,598
Is this why you're so obsessed
with your regimen?

614
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:03,667
You're not afraid of dying.
You have survivor's guilt.

615
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:04,601
Will?

616
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,270
You're a sick girl
with survivor's guilt.

617
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:08,305
This is out of your control.

618
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:10,707
I just don't have
any other choice, okay?

619
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:11,942
You do. But that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

620
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:13,913
I don't!
Will, I don't.

621
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:16,947
Okay, Stella.
Hey, I'm sorry.

622
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:18,115
We're supposed
to be meditating.

623
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:19,718
Stella, come on!

624
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,353
<i>You knew
he had boundary issues.</i>

625
00:39:23,355 --> 00:39:26,056
For what it's worth, I don't
think he meant to hurt you.

626
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:27,658
Yeah,
but it's still annoying.

627
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,326
Like, he said
"Abby" and "dead"

628
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:31,597
in the same sentence
like it was no big deal.

629
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,105
I should've been there.

630
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,808
I should've been there.

631
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,010
Stella, look at me.

632
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:47,179
You can't know.

633
00:39:47,713 --> 00:39:49,215
You just can't.

634
00:39:52,718 --> 00:39:54,820
Oh, this disease is a prison.

635
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:57,323
I wanna hug you.

636
00:39:58,324 --> 00:40:01,160
Just pretend
that I'm doing it right now.

637
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:04,730
I love you.

638
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:07,333
I love you, too.

639
00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:11,268
You wanna get ice cream?

640
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,172
Yes.

641
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:37,997
If the infection
gets into the bloodstream...

642
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,101
Hey.

643
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:45,836
It's gonna be okay.

644
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:47,838
You don't know that.

645
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,709
You're right. I don't.
It's risky.

646
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:53,179
But sepsis is
the bigger monster.

647
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:56,682
Hey.

648
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,117
You're a fighter,
Stella Grant.

649
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,420
You always have been.

650
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:06,458
So...

651
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,761
Yeah?

652
00:41:09,128 --> 00:41:10,429
Yeah.

653
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:13,132
Tomorrow morning, then.

654
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:16,936
I'll let your parents know.

655
00:42:09,888 --> 00:42:10,990
Hey.

656
00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:13,792
You're here.

657
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:15,526
I'm here.

658
00:42:15,528 --> 00:42:18,097
I got your cartoon.
You're forgiven. Back up.

659
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:23,367
You missed our treatment.
What's going on?

660
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:25,404
Infected G-tube.

661
00:42:26,038 --> 00:42:27,971
Dr. Hamid's worried
about sepsis,

662
00:42:27,973 --> 00:42:29,842
so she's replacing it
in the morning.

663
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:31,908
I'm going under general.

664
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,076
Shit.

665
00:42:33,078 --> 00:42:34,547
Are your lungs up for that?

666
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:39,985
Do your nebulizer at 8:00,
and your AffloVest, okay?

667
00:43:46,553 --> 00:43:48,287
What are you doing here?

668
00:43:49,154 --> 00:43:51,088
I thought this was
the bathroom, honestly.

669
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,494
It's your first surgery
without Abby.

670
00:43:55,628 --> 00:43:57,029
How do you know that?

671
00:43:57,229 --> 00:43:59,098
I've seen all your movies.

672
00:44:00,132 --> 00:44:01,634
Some might say

673
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,634
I'm your biggest fan.

674
00:44:03,636 --> 00:44:06,840
So, I really hope
that I don't mess this up.

00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:34,030
I had to Google it.
It's really old.

683
00:44:34,032 --> 00:44:35,098
I know.

684
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,433

Hey.

689
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,028
You ready to get this show

690
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:04,930
Yeah.

691
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:18,509
Oh, hell, no!

692
00:45:18,511 --> 00:45:19,712
Will!

693
00:45:24,116 --> 00:45:25,685
She was scared.

694
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:27,585
I just wanted to do
something nice.

695
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:34,326
Come on!

696
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,327
She's in more danger
under the anesthesia

697
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:39,131
than she is with me.

698
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:44,303
Trevor Von.

699
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,338
That's who you remind me of.

700
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,808
Trevor Von and Amy Presley.

701
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,677
Oh, they were...

702
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:55,080
They were in love.

703
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:58,816
And I let them break the rules
so they could be happy.

704
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:00,452
And let me guess,

705
00:46:01,453 --> 00:46:02,587
they died?

706
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:04,757
Yes, Will, they did.

707
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:08,327
On my watch.

708
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:14,501
And I'd be damned
if I let that happen again.

709
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:38,791
It's gonna be okay.

710
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:58,743
You know what to do.

711
00:46:58,745 --> 00:47:00,212
Mmm-hmm.

712
00:47:01,848 --> 00:47:05,215
Ten, nine...

713
00:47:05,217 --> 00:47:06,418
...eight,

714
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:08,555
seven...

715
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:12,090
Shh...

716
00:48:05,377 --> 00:48:07,780
Oh...

717
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:43,650
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

718
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:48,755
Call me
'cause I miss you, okay?

719
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:51,856
But don't call me, 'cause
I just got out of surgery

720
00:48:51,858 --> 00:48:53,526
and I'm really tired.

721
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:56,459
But call me though
when you get this,

722
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:59,431
because you're cute

723
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:02,502
<i>and I wanna see you</i>

724
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:06,238
<i>and your fluffy little hair</i>

725
00:49:06,906 --> 00:49:10,608
and your little skinny legs.

726
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,744
Okay?

727
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:13,811
<i>Don't call me, though,</i>

728
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:16,847
<i>because if I hear
your sexy voice,</i>

729
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:19,284
<i>I won't be able
to sleep, so...</i>

730
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,455
<i>Call me when you get this,
okay?</i>

731
00:49:24,524 --> 00:49:25,725
<i>Bye.</i>

732
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:43,268
Will's not coming.

733
00:50:45,104 --> 00:50:46,404
Will?

734
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,442
I'm not leaving
until you open the door.

735
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:55,347
I can't.

736
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,085
Just, please open the door
and we can talk about this.

737
00:51:01,087 --> 00:51:02,953
Okay? I don't care
what Barb said.

738
00:51:02,955 --> 00:51:05,057
Just open the door!

739
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:08,526
I can't.

740
00:51:08,528 --> 00:51:09,829
Will, come on.

741
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,377
Go away, Stella.

742
00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:31,816
Maybe it's better this way.

743
00:51:31,818 --> 00:51:34,051
No, I can figure this out.

744
00:51:34,053 --> 00:51:35,719
I need to figure this out.

745
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:37,355
We're not normal kids.

746
00:51:38,591 --> 00:51:40,591
We don't get to take chances
like this.

747
00:51:40,593 --> 00:51:42,860
Oh, come on. You're not gonna
give me that, too?

748
00:51:42,862 --> 00:51:44,362
Admit what's going on here.

749
00:51:44,864 --> 00:51:46,999
Will's a risk-taker,
just like Abby.

750
00:51:48,634 --> 00:51:50,536
What's that supposed to mean?

751
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:54,974
You think that I'm the one
that's afraid to take risks?

752
00:51:55,575 --> 00:51:56,974
What about you and your life

753
00:51:56,976 --> 00:51:58,843
and your relationships?

754
00:51:58,845 --> 00:52:01,411
You and Tim, you and Rick,
you and Michael.

755
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:03,013
Don't go there.

756
00:52:03,015 --> 00:52:05,082
They knew you were sick
and they loved you.

757
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:07,450
You were the one who ran.
Every time, you ran.

758
00:52:07,452 --> 00:52:08,451
You don't know
what you're talking about.

759
00:52:08,453 --> 00:52:10,955
You ruined every chance
you've ever had at love,

760
00:52:10,957 --> 00:52:12,992
so just keep your advice
to yourself.

761
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,010
Bitch.

762
00:53:38,644 --> 00:53:39,779
Asshole.

763
00:53:41,747 --> 00:53:43,416
You know, you're right.

764
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,651
I am afraid.

765
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:49,019
You know what someone gets
for loving me?

766
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:51,221
They get to pay
for all my care.

767
00:53:51,223 --> 00:53:53,059
And then
they get to watch me die.

768
00:53:54,794 --> 00:53:58,262
Deductibles, meds,
hospital stays, surgeries.

769
00:53:58,264 --> 00:54:01,598
When I turn 18,
there's no more full coverage.

770
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,100
Who should I put that on?

771
00:54:03,102 --> 00:54:05,470
Michael or my family?

772
00:54:05,972 --> 00:54:07,873
It's my sickness,
it's my problem.

773
00:54:10,242 --> 00:54:11,942
Maybe we can get Will
to marry you.

774
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:13,045
He's loaded.

775
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,649
He's not picky.
He likes you.

776
00:54:21,887 --> 00:54:23,189
I am sorry

777
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:26,125
about you and Will.

778
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,241
Stella?

779
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,711
What?

780
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,181
Stella?

781
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,845
<i>Hello.</i>

782
00:55:21,847 --> 00:55:24,348
<i>There is something
a little bit different</i>

783
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,552
<i>I want to talk about today.</i>

784
00:55:26,886 --> 00:55:29,088
Burkholderia cepacia.

785
00:55:29,755 --> 00:55:32,322
<i>The risks, the restrictions</i>

786
00:55:32,324 --> 00:55:35,025
<i>and the rules of engagement.</i>

787
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:39,296
B. cepacia
is a hardy bacteria.

788
00:55:39,298 --> 00:55:42,166
Okay? It is so adaptive

789
00:55:42,168 --> 00:55:45,271
that it literally feeds
on penicillin.

790
00:55:45,704 --> 00:55:49,339
So, our first line
of defense is

791
00:55:49,341 --> 00:55:53,811
Cal Stat, a hospital-grade
hand sterilizer.

792
00:55:53,813 --> 00:55:56,849
<i>Apply liberally and often.</i>

793
00:55:57,049 --> 00:56:01,418
Next is
good old-fashioned latex!

794
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,054
<i>Tried-and-true.</i>

795
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:07,660
<i>Used for protection
in all types of activities.</i>

796
00:56:08,427 --> 00:56:13,330
<i>B. cepacia thrives best
in saliva or phlegm.</i>

797
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:16,233
<i>Fun fact,
a cough can travel six feet,</i>

798
00:56:16,235 --> 00:56:19,436
<i>a sneeze can travel
up to 200 miles per hour.</i>

799
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:24,910
But the "no saliva" thing
also means no kissing.

800
00:56:25,277 --> 00:56:26,645
Ever.

801
00:56:27,046 --> 00:56:30,347
<i>So, our best defense
is distance.</i>

802
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:33,285
<i>Six feet at all times.</i>

803
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,986
<i>Ta-da!</i>

804
00:56:35,988 --> 00:56:37,287
<i>Here's a pool cue.</i>

805
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:40,059
<i>It measures
approximately five feet.</i>

806
00:56:41,393 --> 00:56:43,427
<i>Five feet.</i>

807
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:46,866
I've given a lot of thought
to foot number six.

808
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:49,802
And you know what?
It made me mad.

809
00:56:50,402 --> 00:56:54,673
<i>When you have cystic fibrosis,
so much is taken from you.</i>

810
00:56:55,141 --> 00:56:56,974
<i>You live
every day of your life</i>

811
00:56:56,976 --> 00:56:59,443
<i>according to treatments,
and pills, and schedules.</i>

812
00:56:59,445 --> 00:57:01,778
<i>Most of us
can't have children.</i>

813
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,347
<i>A lot of us
don't even live long enough</i>

814
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:04,948
<i>to try to have children.</i>

815
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:08,486
<i>Shit, it's complicated
to try to explain,</i>

816
00:57:08,488 --> 00:57:12,358
<i>but it's even hard
to fall in love.</i>

817
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:17,828
<i>So, after all that
CF has stolen from me,</i>

818
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:19,229
<i>from us,</i>

819
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:22,668
<i>I don't mind stealing
a little something back.</i>

820
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:24,370
One foot.

821
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:27,771
One fucking foot

822
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:29,306
of space, of distance,

823
00:57:29,308 --> 00:57:31,041
of length, or whatever
you wanna call it.

824
00:57:31,043 --> 00:57:33,445
I don't mind
stealing that back.

825
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,814
Because CF...

826
00:57:37,983 --> 00:57:40,186
you're not the thief anymore.

827
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:42,319
I'm the thief now.

828
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:56,869
Five feet apart.

829
00:57:57,236 --> 00:57:58,304
Deal?

830
00:58:01,508 --> 00:58:03,075
Are you in?

831
00:58:13,919 --> 00:58:15,287
I'm so in.

832
00:58:20,527 --> 00:58:23,762
Atrium. 9:00.

833
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:36,340
Why didn't I pack
anything nice?

834
00:58:36,342 --> 00:58:39,479
Oh, 'cause you always pack
for a hot hospital romance.

835
00:59:08,608 --> 00:59:10,409
Is this see-through?

836
00:59:11,143 --> 00:59:13,178
Don't even think about it, ho.

837
00:59:45,911 --> 00:59:46,945
Hi.

838
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:49,148
Hi.

839
01:00:13,038 --> 01:00:14,907
<i>He cut and ran
when I was born.</i>

840
01:00:15,207 --> 01:00:17,876
I guess having a sick kid
wasn't part of his plan.

841
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:19,845
What about your mom?

842
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,013
She's beautiful and driven
and smart.

843
01:00:23,015 --> 01:00:26,985
She's just focused on me
and me alone.

844
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,120
So, starting tomorrow,
when I'm 18,

845
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:32,523
I will be making the decisions
for myself.

846
01:00:32,525 --> 01:00:34,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

847
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,496
Tomorrow's your birthday?

848
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,196
You could have told me that.

849
01:00:39,198 --> 01:00:41,033
I don't have
a present for you.

850
01:00:42,635 --> 01:00:45,638
How about you just promise to
stick around for the next one?

851
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:50,510
Come on.

852
01:00:51,544 --> 01:00:53,480
I'm getting out of here.

853
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:58,350
There is this one theory
I like

854
01:00:58,618 --> 01:01:01,987
that says, "To understand death,
you have to look at birth."

855
01:01:03,155 --> 01:01:04,591
So, like,

856
01:01:05,157 --> 01:01:09,061
while we're in the womb,
we're living that existence

857
01:01:09,428 --> 01:01:12,362
not knowing
that our next existence

858
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:14,297
is just an inch away.

859
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:17,568
So, maybe it's the same
with death.

860
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:21,572
Maybe death is just
the next life,

861
01:01:21,574 --> 01:01:23,075
but an inch away.

862
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:27,946
Or maybe it's just
a big sleep, baby.

863
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:30,315
Lights out.

864
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,317
Done and done.

865
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:34,119
No.

866
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:38,155
There's no way

867
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:43,427
that Abby just blinked out.

868
01:01:43,429 --> 01:01:45,197
I refuse to believe it.

869
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:49,468
What happened with Abby?

870
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:57,075
She was cliff diving
in California.

871
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:01,113
She landed wrong,
broke her neck and drowned.

872
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:06,283
They said
she didn't feel any pain,

873
01:02:06,285 --> 01:02:10,255
but how would they know
if she felt pain?

874
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:15,160
I was supposed to be there
with her, but I got sick.

875
01:02:15,461 --> 01:02:17,162
Like I always do.

876
01:02:19,532 --> 01:02:23,035
I just keep imagining it
over and over again.

877
01:02:23,703 --> 01:02:25,237
What she was feeling.

878
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,044
Without knowing that,
she just never stops dying.

879
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:35,047
Stella.

880
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:38,549
Even if you were there,
you still wouldn't know.

881
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:40,185
But I wasn't there.

882
01:02:43,523 --> 01:02:45,257
She died alone.

883
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,762
Isn't that how
we're gonna die?

884
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:54,433
Drowning.
Just without the water.

885
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:57,504
Our own fluids
doing the dirty work.

886
01:03:01,574 --> 01:03:03,510
I think about
that last breath a lot.

887
01:03:04,777 --> 01:03:06,613
Gasping for air,

888
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,482
not getting any.

889
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:11,816
No air,

890
01:03:11,818 --> 01:03:15,387
just black.

891
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,524
But that's only on Mondays.

892
01:03:19,526 --> 01:03:21,628
Otherwise,
I don't dwell on it.

893
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,400
There's that smile.

894
01:03:33,338 --> 01:03:35,307
God, you're beautiful.

895
01:03:36,843 --> 01:03:38,310
And brave.

896
01:03:43,315 --> 01:03:45,217
I wish I could touch you.

897
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:34,834
I lied

898
01:04:35,802 --> 01:04:37,302
when we met.

899
01:04:40,405 --> 01:04:43,108
I've never had sex.

900
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:48,512
I've never wanted anyone
to see me.

901
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:50,115
The scars, uh,

902
01:04:53,753 --> 01:04:55,888
the tube,
nothing about it's sexy.

903
01:04:57,322 --> 01:04:59,424
Everything about you is sexy.

904
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,496
I think you're perfect.

905
01:07:10,556 --> 01:07:12,390
Good morning.

906
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:21,266
<i>See those lights out there?</i>

907
01:07:21,534 --> 01:07:23,601
Abby and I would
call them stars

908
01:07:23,603 --> 01:07:25,972
and we would make wishes.

909
01:07:27,807 --> 01:07:29,640
She'd never tell me
what her wish was,

910
01:07:29,642 --> 01:07:34,446
but I knew she wished
for new lungs for me.

911
01:07:35,715 --> 01:07:37,550
I hope she gets her wish.

912
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:39,986
Yeah, me too.

913
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:45,057
Mornin', Barb.

914
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:13,052
Where are they?

915
01:08:14,554 --> 01:08:15,555
Who?

916
01:08:16,589 --> 01:08:18,423
What are you talking about?

917
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:33,438
Oh, shit.
Barb knows we're gone.

918
01:08:33,706 --> 01:08:34,738
Okay.

919
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,710
Uh, she'll look for me first
in the NICU, so...

920
01:08:38,177 --> 01:08:40,479
Bye! Okay.

921
01:10:15,741 --> 01:10:17,576
I'm free!

922
01:10:18,277 --> 01:10:19,512
Oh...

923
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:21,712
Oh, my gosh!

924
01:10:21,714 --> 01:10:23,080
Happy Birthday!

925
01:10:23,082 --> 01:10:24,982
I'm so sorry.
I forgot.

926
01:10:24,984 --> 01:10:26,116
No, it's fine.

927
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:28,118
What are you doing? Are you
busy? Let's take a walk.

928
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,020
<i>I can't right now.</i>

929
01:10:30,022 --> 01:10:31,157
I'm sorry.

930
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:33,223
Studying.

931
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:34,593
<i>Maybe later?</i>

932
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:36,860
My friends
are actually coming later.

933
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:38,128
That's all right.

934
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:39,732
We'll figure something out.

935
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,601
I was just, uh,

936
01:10:43,169 --> 01:10:44,503
missing you.

937
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,108
Talk to you later.

938
01:10:49,308 --> 01:10:51,241
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

939
01:10:57,149 --> 01:10:58,484
Jason.

940
01:11:00,019 --> 01:11:01,318
Yeah, no. Don't...

941
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,255
No. Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

942
01:11:03,923 --> 01:11:05,958
<i>No, seriously, I'm not mad.</i>

943
01:11:07,259 --> 01:11:09,862
It's fine.
Just do your thing.

944
01:11:10,296 --> 01:11:11,931
<i>I'll talk to you tomorrow.</i>

945
01:13:50,723 --> 01:13:52,191
Thought you'd never find me.

946
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,760
I know it's late,

947
01:13:56,762 --> 01:13:59,798
but we had to wait
till the cafeteria closed.

948
01:14:00,099 --> 01:14:01,231
"We"?

949
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:02,234
Mmm-hmm.

950
01:14:06,972 --> 01:14:08,906
Surprise!

951
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:14,211
We felt so bad
for ditching you, dude.

952
01:14:14,213 --> 01:14:16,346
But your girlfriend DM'd us

953
01:14:16,348 --> 01:14:17,915
and convinced us
to surprise you, man.

954
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:19,517
"Girlfriend"?

955
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,886
You're so good.

956
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,487
Yeah, I'm good.

957
01:14:22,489 --> 01:14:24,087
I can't believe
he's real.

958
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:25,222
I know!

959
01:14:25,224 --> 01:14:27,758
And he's even hotter
in person.

960
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,825
Seriously.

961
01:14:28,827 --> 01:14:30,827
Hey,
the food's almost ready!

962
01:14:30,829 --> 01:14:32,231
And Happy Birthday!

963
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:43,075
Just wanted to observe
the master at work.

964
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:46,245
Are those roses?

965
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,179
They're so beautiful.

966
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:50,249
How do you do that?

967
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:52,318
I've been practicing.

968
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:57,387
'Cause next month,
Michael and I

969
01:14:57,389 --> 01:14:58,991
are gonna go see my mom.

970
01:14:59,425 --> 01:15:00,793
Really?

971
01:15:02,161 --> 01:15:04,463
He's coming to lunch tomorrow
and I'm gonna go for it.

972
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:07,166
Oh, my God!

973
01:15:09,268 --> 01:15:10,402
He loves me.

974
01:15:11,403 --> 01:15:13,072
And I love him, too.

975
01:15:13,906 --> 01:15:17,241
Aw, Poe, I'm so happy!

976
01:15:17,243 --> 01:15:18,408
Don't go all soppy on me.

977
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:20,377
You know
I can't let a girl cry alone.

978
01:15:22,348 --> 01:15:24,214
They're happy tears.

979
01:15:24,216 --> 01:15:27,317
I'm happy for you, Poe.

980
01:15:31,991 --> 01:15:33,192
Let's eat!

981
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:51,041
Poe, where did you get
all of this?

982
01:15:51,043 --> 01:15:52,976
Hospitals have VIP kitchens

983
01:15:52,978 --> 01:15:54,378
where they keep
all the good stuff.

984
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,882
You know,
for celebrities, politicians.

985
01:15:57,149 --> 01:15:59,818
But tonight, Birthday Boy,
it's for you.

986
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,421
<i>Salud!</i>

987
01:16:02,988 --> 01:16:04,491
<i>Salud!</i>

988
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:19,604
We were, like, ten!

989
01:16:19,606 --> 01:16:22,573
Yes. And we literally
put sheets over our head

990
01:16:22,575 --> 01:16:24,341
and ran
into the dementia ward!

991
01:16:28,047 --> 01:16:30,113
It was just like that!

992
01:16:30,115 --> 01:16:32,082
Woo!

993
01:16:32,084 --> 01:16:33,283
It was crazy.

994
01:16:33,285 --> 01:16:35,821
It was
the best Halloween ever!

995
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:38,155
We got in so much trouble.

996
01:16:38,157 --> 01:16:39,590
And it wasn't even our idea.

997
01:16:39,592 --> 01:16:42,259
Remember? Abby...
Abby came up with that.

998
01:16:52,004 --> 01:16:53,506
Abby was wild.

999
01:16:54,306 --> 01:16:56,507
She was free.

1000
01:16:56,509 --> 01:16:58,375
She always said
she was gonna live big

1001
01:16:58,377 --> 01:17:00,145
because Stella couldn't.

1002
01:17:01,113 --> 01:17:02,179
She did.

1003
01:17:02,181 --> 01:17:03,614
She lived big.

1004
01:17:03,616 --> 01:17:05,918
Bigger than any of us.

1005
01:17:06,452 --> 01:17:07,685
She would've loved
a clandestine party

1006
01:17:07,687 --> 01:17:08,887
like this one!

1007
01:17:09,188 --> 01:17:10,289
She would've.

1008
01:17:13,092 --> 01:17:15,060
To Abby.

1009
01:17:16,295 --> 01:17:17,497
To Abby.

1010
01:17:22,301 --> 01:17:27,137
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you! ♪</i>

1011
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:28,407
Whoo!

1012
01:17:30,109 --> 01:17:31,343
Make a wish!

1013
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:39,385
I can't blow the candles out
or else you guys can't eat it.

1014
01:17:45,224 --> 01:17:46,957
I made a wish for you.

1015
01:17:46,959 --> 01:17:48,358
Thank you.

1016
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,093
One. Two.

1017
01:17:50,095 --> 01:17:51,395
All right.

1018
01:17:52,965 --> 01:17:54,131
Yay!

1019
01:17:54,133 --> 01:17:56,368
Happy Birthday, Will!

1020
01:17:58,505 --> 01:17:59,506
Barb?

1021
01:17:59,706 --> 01:18:01,004
Hey!

1022
01:18:02,509 --> 01:18:04,307
We thought
you were off tonight.

1023
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:06,613
You want us
to fix you a plate?

1024
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,746
That's it. That's it.

1025
01:18:08,748 --> 01:18:10,347
You're all confined
to your rooms

1026
01:18:10,349 --> 01:18:11,649
while we get
respiratory cultures.

1027
01:18:11,651 --> 01:18:13,183
And you.

1028
01:18:13,185 --> 01:18:14,719
You'll be transferred
in the morning.

1029
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:16,721
Barb!
Barb, it wasn't his fault.

1030
01:18:16,723 --> 01:18:18,689
Well, you might be willing
to gamble with your lives,

1031
01:18:18,691 --> 01:18:19,757
but I'm not!

1032
01:18:19,759 --> 01:18:21,391
Just like when
we were kids.

1033
01:18:21,393 --> 01:18:23,528
But you're not kids
anymore, Poe.

1034
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:25,462
But we were safe
like you taught us to be.

1035
01:18:25,464 --> 01:18:26,764
Oh.

1036
01:18:26,766 --> 01:18:29,067
I'm sorry, but it was fun!

1037
01:18:44,383 --> 01:18:46,651
<i>All right, I'm gonna
let you go to sleep, okay?</i>

1038
01:18:46,653 --> 01:18:48,185
Good night.

1039
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:49,522
<i>Good night.</i>

1040
01:18:59,799 --> 01:19:01,264
A little pick-me-up?

1041
01:19:01,266 --> 01:19:02,267
Thank you.

1042
01:19:03,235 --> 01:19:05,538
It's just safer if he goes.

1043
01:19:06,305 --> 01:19:07,605
You're probably right.

1044
01:19:07,607 --> 01:19:09,540
She's gonna hate me.

1045
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:11,343
Mmm-hmm.

1046
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:15,447
What's up, Poe?

1047
01:19:17,282 --> 01:19:19,517
He probably sat
on the call button again.

1048
01:19:19,519 --> 01:19:20,520
I got it.

1049
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:26,291
Knock, knock. Poe?

1050
01:19:30,563 --> 01:19:32,532
Code Blue!

1051
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:36,801
<i>Attention,
all medical personnel.</i>

1052
01:19:36,803 --> 01:19:38,703
<i>Poe! Poe!</i>

1053
01:19:38,705 --> 01:19:40,072
Poe!

1054
01:19:40,339 --> 01:19:41,438
No pulse.

1055
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,106
Oh, God! Okay.

1056
01:19:43,108 --> 01:19:44,040
Stay with me, baby.

1057
01:19:44,042 --> 01:19:45,510
He's not breathing.
He's not breathing.

1058
01:19:45,512 --> 01:19:47,177
Come on, you can do it.
Come on.

1059
01:19:47,179 --> 01:19:49,047
Bag him.
Start chest compressions!

1060
01:19:50,182 --> 01:19:51,649
Come on!

1061
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:52,717
Give him an Epi!

1062
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:53,718
Come on, baby!

1063
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,520
It's a massive
tension pneumothorax.

1064
01:19:55,522 --> 01:19:56,587
His lung is collapsing!

1065
01:19:59,559 --> 01:20:01,091
Put the pads on him!
Put the pads on him!

1066
01:20:01,093 --> 01:20:02,325
Come on, buddy.

1067
01:20:02,327 --> 01:20:04,294
Come on, sweetie.
Come on, sweetie!

1068
01:20:04,296 --> 01:20:05,462
Come on, buddy!

1069
01:20:05,464 --> 01:20:06,531
Barb, what's happening?

1070
01:20:06,533 --> 01:20:08,098
Somebody get her out of here!

1071
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,165
Close that door!

1072
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:10,637
Barb, what's happening?

1073
01:20:17,844 --> 01:20:19,376
Dr. Hamid?

1074
01:20:19,378 --> 01:20:20,645
Not now, Stella.

1075
01:20:20,647 --> 01:20:22,347
Dr. Hamid?

1076
01:20:25,818 --> 01:20:27,419
I'm sorry.

1077
01:20:28,353 --> 01:20:29,556
I'm so sorry.

1078
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:31,123
No!

1079
01:20:33,191 --> 01:20:34,393
No!

1080
01:20:35,193 --> 01:20:37,597
I'm so sorry.

1081
01:20:49,842 --> 01:20:50,908
No!

1082
01:20:56,516 --> 01:20:57,784
Oh, my God!

1083
01:21:00,252 --> 01:21:02,689
Oh, my God!
He's gone!

1084
01:21:03,623 --> 01:21:05,489
Michael's never gonna
see him again.

1085
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:07,560
His parents are never gonna
see him again.

1086
01:21:09,428 --> 01:21:11,731
I'm never gonna see him again.

1087
01:21:16,803 --> 01:21:18,470
I never hugged him!

1088
01:21:19,939 --> 01:21:21,038
I never hugged him!

1089
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,143
He's my best friend and
I never fucking hugged him!

1090
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:29,147
Oh, God!

1091
01:21:32,384 --> 01:21:34,087
I'm losing everyone.

1092
01:21:34,787 --> 01:21:36,321
You're not losing me.

1093
01:21:37,289 --> 01:21:38,658
What are you doing?

1094
01:21:39,892 --> 01:21:41,224
Get out!

1095
01:21:41,226 --> 01:21:42,860
Get out!

1096
01:21:42,862 --> 01:21:44,396
Just get out!

1097
01:24:47,412 --> 01:24:49,015
I wanna go see the lights.

1098
01:24:49,816 --> 01:24:52,718
It's gotta be, like,
two miles away.

1099
01:24:53,853 --> 01:24:56,354
Hey, come on, let's go inside.

1100
01:24:57,123 --> 01:24:58,591
Come with me.

1101
01:24:59,492 --> 01:25:01,725
Stella, now's not the time
to be rebellious.

1102
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:03,060
Is this about Poe?

1103
01:25:03,062 --> 01:25:04,396
It is about Poe.

1104
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:06,764
It's about Abby,
it's about you and me

1105
01:25:06,766 --> 01:25:09,101
and all the things that we'll
never get to do together.

1106
01:25:09,869 --> 01:25:13,403
This whole time, I've been
living for my treatments

1107
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:16,108
instead of doing my treatments
so that I can live.

1108
01:25:17,844 --> 01:25:19,344
I wanna live.

1109
01:25:23,549 --> 01:25:25,149
It's just life, Will.

1110
01:25:25,151 --> 01:25:26,986
It'll be over
before we know it.

1111
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:33,860
All right.

1112
01:25:36,062 --> 01:25:38,030
Can we catch a cab at least?

1113
01:25:39,665 --> 01:25:41,901
I wanna walk
and enjoy the night.

1114
01:25:45,538 --> 01:25:47,139
Glove.
We're good.

1115
01:26:03,489 --> 01:26:05,589
How are you always
getting me to exercise?

1116
01:26:21,941 --> 01:26:23,910
Sure looks better
from up here.

1117
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:53,105
What's that?

1118
01:26:57,076 --> 01:26:59,178
Yeah, you're gonna have
to explain that one.

1119
01:27:02,682 --> 01:27:03,881
Abby got it for me

1120
01:27:03,883 --> 01:27:05,849
the first time I came
to the hospital.

1121
01:27:05,851 --> 01:27:07,920
I've had it with me
every time since.

1122
01:27:10,523 --> 01:27:11,889
That's a relief, honestly,

1123
01:27:11,891 --> 01:27:12,823
'cause I didn't have
the heart to tell you

1124
01:27:12,825 --> 01:27:15,194
that a third boob might be
a deal breaker.

1125
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:48,027
Hey, Stella.

1126
01:27:49,295 --> 01:27:50,262
Hmm?

1127
01:27:50,963 --> 01:27:53,099
It's cold.

1128
01:28:02,742 --> 01:28:03,776
Come on.

1129
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:05,778
Let's go see your lights.

1130
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:19,558
Let's take a breather.

1131
01:28:30,369 --> 01:28:32,770
Stella?
Hey, don't do that.

1132
01:28:32,772 --> 01:28:33,937
Stella.

1133
01:28:33,939 --> 01:28:35,274
It's frozen solid.

1134
01:28:46,318 --> 01:28:47,384
Hey, ladies.

1135
01:28:47,386 --> 01:28:49,820
I just got a call from
St. Luke's in Kansas City.

1136
01:28:49,822 --> 01:28:50,888
Car accident with fatalities.

1137
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:54,324
One female, AB neg, 5'2",
thoracic cage size...

1138
01:28:54,326 --> 01:28:55,659
Stella's getting lungs.

1139
01:28:55,661 --> 01:28:57,696
ETA three hours.
Get her prepped.

1140
01:29:02,168 --> 01:29:03,636
Oh, my God.

1141
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:10,174
No, no, no, no, no.

1142
01:29:10,176 --> 01:29:12,810
No, no, no, no, no. No!

1143
01:29:23,355 --> 01:29:24,356
Whew!

1144
01:29:48,848 --> 01:29:49,849
Hey.

1145
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:53,219
Everything all right?

1146
01:30:04,130 --> 01:30:05,164
Yeah.

1147
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:10,870
Yeah, I'm good.

1148
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,075
Oh!

1149
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,049
I love you, Stella.

1150
01:30:46,772 --> 01:30:47,940
I love you, too.

1151
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:24,877
We can't.

1152
01:31:30,249 --> 01:31:31,350
I know.

1153
01:31:33,285 --> 01:31:34,320
Stella.

1154
01:31:51,136 --> 01:31:52,402
Oh...

1155
01:31:52,404 --> 01:31:53,538
Shit!

1156
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:54,907
Come on, come on!

1157
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,206
Come on.

1158
01:31:57,409 --> 01:31:59,445
Come on.

1159
01:31:59,945 --> 01:32:02,279
Barb. Barb? Barb.

1160
01:32:02,281 --> 01:32:03,213
She's not answering,

1161
01:32:03,215 --> 01:32:04,314
and now it's going
straight to voicemail.

1162
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:06,817
Stella would never run off.
She wouldn't do that.

1163
01:32:06,819 --> 01:32:07,985
Have you been able
to reach him?

1164
01:32:07,987 --> 01:32:09,920
No.

1165
01:32:09,922 --> 01:32:12,055
How long have they been gone?

1166
01:32:12,057 --> 01:32:13,591
If your son causes Stella
to lose these lungs...

1167
01:32:13,593 --> 01:32:15,359
My son is just
as sick as your daughter is.

1168
01:32:15,361 --> 01:32:16,893
Stella would never do
anything like this.

1169
01:32:16,895 --> 01:32:17,961
She's never done anything.

1170
01:32:17,963 --> 01:32:19,096
Stella did this, Erin.

1171
01:32:19,098 --> 01:32:21,999
Not Will. He doesn't know
anything about the lungs.

1172
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:23,200
Lungs?

1173
01:32:23,202 --> 01:32:25,035
Is there a transplant?

1174
01:32:25,037 --> 01:32:27,039
Yeah, for Stella.
They're on the way.

1175
01:32:27,373 --> 01:32:29,139
Well, tell me
at least you're a cat person.

1176
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:30,207
Do you like cats?

1177
01:32:30,209 --> 01:32:31,542
I owned a ferret.

1178
01:32:31,544 --> 01:32:33,443
I was a ferret kid.

1179
01:32:33,445 --> 01:32:35,480
Oh, no.
You would be a ferret kid.

1180
01:32:37,449 --> 01:32:39,349
Don't answer it.

1181
01:32:39,351 --> 01:32:40,618
Really. What do they need
right now?

1182
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,052
It's my mom.

1183
01:32:42,054 --> 01:32:44,123
Let me just tell her
that I'm okay.

1184
01:32:48,595 --> 01:32:50,429
Stella, they have
new lungs for you.

1185
01:32:52,231 --> 01:32:54,064
Hey, they have
new lungs for you.

1186
01:32:54,066 --> 01:32:55,299
Let's go to the hospital.
Come on!

1187
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:57,069
I haven't seen the lights yet.

1188
01:32:57,903 --> 01:32:58,904
The lights?

1189
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:01,972
Did you know about this?
What are we doing out here?

1190
01:33:01,974 --> 01:33:03,040
Let's go to the hospital.

1191
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:04,207
Come on.

1192
01:33:04,209 --> 01:33:05,175
Five years?

1193
01:33:05,177 --> 01:33:06,443
Five years is a lifetime
for people like us.

1194
01:33:06,445 --> 01:33:07,411
It's not!
Because what happens

1195
01:33:07,413 --> 01:33:08,546
when they fail
and I'm back to square one?

1196
01:33:08,548 --> 01:33:10,247
Let's not be stupid. Can we go
the hospital, please?

1197
01:33:10,249 --> 01:33:11,381
Come on, let's go.

1198
01:33:13,252 --> 01:33:14,386
Stella!

1199
01:33:26,031 --> 01:33:27,230
Stella.

1200
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:28,400
Come on.

1201
01:33:28,635 --> 01:33:30,770
Please? It's cold.

1202
01:33:34,641 --> 01:33:35,841
Stella!

1203
01:33:43,349 --> 01:33:44,484
Stella!

1204
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,101
Stella.

1205
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,641
Help!

1206
01:34:54,186 --> 01:34:55,555
Come on, Stella.

1207
01:35:14,473 --> 01:35:15,675
Come on!

1208
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:17,209
Come on!

1209
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:23,313
Come on, Stella.

1210
01:36:55,642 --> 01:36:56,807
We have a 17-year-old...

1211
01:36:56,809 --> 01:36:57,909
What have we got?

1212
01:36:57,911 --> 01:37:00,811
A 17-year-old
female with cystic fibrosis.

1213
01:37:00,813 --> 01:37:02,212
We already have lungs for her.

1214
01:37:02,214 --> 01:37:03,346
Can someone get
the other mask off?

1215
01:37:03,348 --> 01:37:04,882
Oh, my God. Honey.

1216
01:37:04,884 --> 01:37:07,284
It's okay.

1217
01:37:07,286 --> 01:37:09,654
My son.
My son was out there, too.

1218
01:37:09,656 --> 01:37:10,855
I'm sorry.
Step back, please.

1219
01:37:10,857 --> 01:37:12,322
You're okay.
You're okay.

1220
01:37:12,324 --> 01:37:14,124
Where's Will?

1221
01:37:14,126 --> 01:37:15,258
Where's Will?

1222
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:16,594
Honey.

1223
01:37:16,596 --> 01:37:17,830
Coming through!

1224
01:37:18,698 --> 01:37:20,598
Is he okay?

1225
01:37:21,801 --> 01:37:24,134
Get a mask on her
as soon as possible, please.

1226
01:37:24,136 --> 01:37:25,570
O2 is at 45.

1227
01:37:25,572 --> 01:37:26,571
Possible hypothermia.

1228
01:37:26,573 --> 01:37:28,405
We're gonna need
more blankets over here.

1229
01:37:28,407 --> 01:37:30,442
Just breathe.
Stella?

1230
01:37:30,677 --> 01:37:32,409
I've got you, honey.

1231
01:37:32,411 --> 01:37:34,377
Stella?

1232
01:37:34,379 --> 01:37:35,546
You need to calm down.

1233
01:37:35,548 --> 01:37:36,881
We have your new lungs.

1234
01:37:36,883 --> 01:37:38,348
Yes, Stella.

1235
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:39,850
I don't want them.

1236
01:37:39,852 --> 01:37:41,786
Stella, we've been waiting
for these lungs for years.

1237
01:37:41,788 --> 01:37:43,521
What are you talking about?

1238
01:37:43,523 --> 01:37:45,422
If you don't use the lungs,
they're wasted, sweetie.

1239
01:37:45,424 --> 01:37:46,591
I love him. The new lungs

1240
01:37:46,593 --> 01:37:47,758
won't mean anything
without him.

1241
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,660
Lay down!

1242
01:37:49,662 --> 01:37:51,396
Stop! Stop!

1243
01:37:51,598 --> 01:37:53,600
Please! Stop.

1244
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,267
Will!

1245
01:37:56,268 --> 01:37:57,469
Please.

1246
01:37:59,539 --> 01:38:00,873
Take the lungs.

1247
01:38:02,374 --> 01:38:03,576
For me.

1248
01:38:06,378 --> 01:38:07,243
Okay.

1249
01:38:07,245 --> 01:38:08,512
Come on, put the mask on.

1250
01:38:08,514 --> 01:38:09,580
I'm ready.

1251
01:38:09,582 --> 01:38:11,247
Okay, all right,
let's go, everyone.

1252
01:38:11,249 --> 01:38:12,215
Okay, okay.

1253
01:38:12,217 --> 01:38:13,017
Okay, here we go.
We're moving.

1254
01:38:13,019 --> 01:38:14,485
I'll be right here,
honey.

1255
01:38:14,487 --> 01:38:16,186
Let's go.

1256
01:38:16,188 --> 01:38:17,824
Okay, I love you so much.

1257
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:20,390
I love you, Dad.

1258
01:38:21,694 --> 01:38:23,128
Okay, here we go.

1259
01:38:23,696 --> 01:38:25,197
Dr. Hamid.

1260
01:38:25,598 --> 01:38:27,466
I gave her mouth-to-mouth.

1261
01:38:28,968 --> 01:38:30,901
I'm sorry. I didn't have
any other choice.

1262
01:38:30,903 --> 01:38:32,003
You saved her life, Will.

1263
01:38:32,005 --> 01:38:34,874
<i>If she has B. cepacia,
we'll deal with it, okay?</i>

1264
01:40:30,823 --> 01:40:32,759
Bacterial cultures came back.

1265
01:40:33,893 --> 01:40:36,996
I don't know how,
but she's clean.

1266
01:40:37,563 --> 01:40:38,965
She didn't get it.

1267
01:40:42,568 --> 01:40:44,537
But that doesn't mean
she won't.

1268
01:40:48,674 --> 01:40:50,275
What about Will?

1269
01:40:51,677 --> 01:40:53,513
Is the treatment working?

1270
01:40:58,050 --> 01:40:59,051
No.

1271
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:03,055
No, it's not.

1272
01:41:11,664 --> 01:41:12,765
I'm sorry.

1273
01:41:15,034 --> 01:41:16,600
For all of this.

1274
01:41:16,602 --> 01:41:18,771
No, no, no, no, sweetie.

1275
01:41:20,139 --> 01:41:21,707
It's not your fault.

1276
01:42:25,071 --> 01:42:27,171
Mom. Hey.

1277
01:42:27,173 --> 01:42:28,973
Hey, Mom.

1278
01:42:28,975 --> 01:42:31,443
What? What is it?
What is it, honey?

1279
01:42:31,811 --> 01:42:33,779
Could you help me
with something?

1280
01:42:38,084 --> 01:42:39,583
Are you guys in?

1281
01:42:39,585 --> 01:42:41,087
Absolutely.

1282
01:42:42,054 --> 01:42:43,055
Barb?

1283
01:42:45,091 --> 01:42:46,757
Hell, yeah, I'm in.

1284
01:42:47,693 --> 01:42:50,029
She's sedated.
We have a few more hours.

1285
01:42:50,663 --> 01:42:51,797
We have time.

1286
01:42:52,031 --> 01:42:53,097
It's done.

1287
01:42:53,099 --> 01:42:54,567
They said yes.

1288
01:42:56,135 --> 01:42:57,136
Okay.

1289
01:42:57,770 --> 01:42:59,538
Let's do this.

1290
01:43:10,683 --> 01:43:14,452
I've done all I'm doing
with this, Will. I'm done.

1291
01:43:17,523 --> 01:43:19,125
Thank you.

1292
01:43:20,559 --> 01:43:21,894
She's waking up.

1293
01:43:26,632 --> 01:43:27,733
Hey, honey.

1294
01:43:33,239 --> 01:43:34,505
Hey, sweetie, you did great!

1295
01:43:34,507 --> 01:43:35,673
You really did.

1296
01:43:35,675 --> 01:43:36,876
You did great.

1297
01:43:40,913 --> 01:43:43,514
You did wonderful, baby.

1298
01:43:43,516 --> 01:43:44,717
You did good.

1299
01:43:45,885 --> 01:43:47,086
It's okay.

1300
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,228
We have something for you.

1301
01:44:01,901 --> 01:44:04,537
<i>My beautiful,
bossy Stella.</i>

1302
01:44:05,304 --> 01:44:08,074
<i>I guess it's true,
what that book of yours says.</i>

1303
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:11,177
<i>That the soul knows no time.</i>

1304
01:44:12,678 --> 01:44:14,647
<i>My drug trial's not working.</i>

1305
01:44:15,848 --> 01:44:18,916
<i>I want you to know
that this past month</i>

1306
01:44:18,918 --> 01:44:20,720
<i>will last forever for me.</i>

1307
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:22,953
<i>My only regret is that</i>

1308
01:44:22,955 --> 01:44:24,623
<i>you didn't get to see
your lights.</i>

1309
01:45:19,712 --> 01:45:22,081
<i>I finally got you speechless.</i>

1310
01:45:26,152 --> 01:45:28,318
<i>You know, people are always
saying if you love something,</i>

1311
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,289
<i>you have to learn
to let it go.</i>

1312
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:33,793
<i>I thought
that was such bullshit.</i>

1313
01:45:35,828 --> 01:45:38,130
<i>Till I watched you almost die.</i>

1314
01:45:38,864 --> 01:45:40,766
In that moment, Stella,

1315
01:45:43,636 --> 01:45:45,304
nothing mattered to me.

1316
01:45:46,939 --> 01:45:48,107
<i>Except you.</i>

1317
01:45:52,945 --> 01:45:54,146
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1318
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:59,952
<i>I don't wanna go.</i>

1319
01:46:02,922 --> 01:46:05,257
<i>All I want is to be with you.</i>

1320
01:46:09,061 --> 01:46:10,262
<i>I can't.</i>

1321
01:46:12,331 --> 01:46:14,366
<i>I need you to be safe.</i>

1322
01:46:15,234 --> 01:46:16,702
From me.

1323
01:46:20,206 --> 01:46:22,341
I don't know what comes next,

1324
01:46:23,042 --> 01:46:26,078
<i>but I don't regret
any of this.</i>

1325
01:46:30,282 --> 01:46:32,118
Could you close your eyes?

1326
01:46:33,419 --> 01:46:35,152
<i>I just don't know
if I can walk away</i>

1327
01:46:35,154 --> 01:46:36,789
<i>if you're still looking at me.</i>

1328
01:46:44,463 --> 01:46:45,764
<i>Please.</i>

1329
01:47:03,082 --> 01:47:04,383
<i>I love you</i>

1330
01:47:05,417 --> 01:47:07,153
<i>so much.</i>

1331
01:47:35,981 --> 01:47:38,017
He left this for you.

1332
01:49:09,208 --> 01:49:10,510
<i>Human touch.</i>

1333
01:49:12,077 --> 01:49:14,481
Our first form
of communication.

1334
01:49:15,114 --> 01:49:18,017
<i>Safety, security, comfort,</i>

1335
01:49:18,585 --> 01:49:21,453
<i>all in the gentle caress
of a finger.</i>

1336
01:49:22,454 --> 01:49:25,322
<i>Or at the brush of lips
on a soft cheek.</i>

1337
01:49:25,324 --> 01:49:27,026
Hey, Stella.
You can't record that. No.

1338
01:49:27,326 --> 01:49:29,259
It connects us
when we're happy...

1339
01:49:31,297 --> 01:49:33,130
Abby, no.

1340
01:49:33,132 --> 01:49:34,632
<i>...bolsters us
in times of fear...</i>

1341
01:49:36,035 --> 01:49:37,570
Can you turn that off?

1342
01:49:38,003 --> 01:49:40,839
...excites us
in times of passion...

1343
01:49:41,373 --> 01:49:44,477
Ah. No. Stella, no.
Stop!

1344
01:49:44,877 --> 01:49:46,845
...and love.

1345
01:49:49,915 --> 01:49:51,616
We need that touch
from the one we love

1346
01:49:51,618 --> 01:49:53,986
almost as much
as we need air to breathe.

1347
01:49:55,622 --> 01:49:57,956
<i>But I never understood
the importance of touch.</i>

1348
01:50:00,059 --> 01:50:01,561
<i>His touch.</i>

1349
01:50:03,896 --> 01:50:05,532
<i>Until I couldn't have it.</i>

1350
01:50:09,669 --> 01:50:12,371
So, if you're watching this

1351
01:50:13,072 --> 01:50:14,473
and you're able,

1352
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:18,977
<i>touch him.</i>

1353
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,380
<i>Touch her.</i>

1354
01:50:23,415 --> 01:50:25,918
<i>Life's too short
to waste a second.</i>

1355
