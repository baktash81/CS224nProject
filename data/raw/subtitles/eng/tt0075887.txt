1
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:09,526
Well, we're almost there now.

2
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,787
What is this?

3
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:52,929
Some Arab stole it for me.

4
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,143
Said it's pretty old.

5
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:57,240
You know something about it?

6
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,533
No, uh, my husband might, though.

7
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,521
He collects this sort of thing.

8
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,509
How much do you want for it?

9
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:04,342
35.

10
00:07:05,778 --> 00:07:07,445
Could you take 20?

11
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:10,456
22.

12
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:15,010
Okay. Would you put it in something?

13
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,145
Thanks.

14
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:52,517
Kim, watch out!

15
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:30,472
You take longer and longer to come back

16
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:31,919
every time you go away.

17
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:35,209
But of course, you have nothing
to come back to, have you?

18
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,370
I've been home for some time.

19
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,532
I just didn't want to bother you.

20
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:40,920
Where have you been?

21
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,455
The swap meet, I bought you something.

22
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:45,847
It looked so interesting I thought

23
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,040
you might like it for your collection.

24
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,347
Is that the only interesting
thing you saw there?

25
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:54,655
You're never going to let
me forget, are you, Mark?

26
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:55,896
Well, I have this chair to remind me.

27
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,932
It seems only fair that some
things should remind you.

28
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,429
I wish it had been me instead of you.

29
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:04,256
I don't think I would have
blamed you and hated you.

30
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:07,083
Mark, there's a world out
there that's passing us by.

31
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:08,795
And now you
want to go back to it?

32
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,507
Well, I want us to go back to it.

33
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:12,202
You and I together.

34
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:15,077
Don't you see we're
alive, we're a part of it?

35
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:18,043
What part, a crippled man
sitting on the sidelines

36
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,460
supporting his wife's antics?

37
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,424
You and me together, yes, but right here,

38
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:27,513
I don't want you ever to
leave this house again.

39
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,463
I won't be a prisoner.

40
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:32,589
Here's your change.

41
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:33,966
Where you heading to, Jed?

42
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,794
I'm going down to the farmhouse
to kick dem damn kids out.

43
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:39,883
Them bastards ain't paid
the rent for four months.

44
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,259
I've had it, you know?

45
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,531
Take it easy now.

46
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:43,803
That's okay.

47
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:01,793
Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?

48
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:03,043
I'll catch him!

49
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:10,697
Pull over!

50
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:13,733
You freak, who's in there?

51
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,673
Shit!

52
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:11,075
Ah yes, of course, the sauna.

53
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,875
The one place I can count on finding you

54
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:15,118
when you are at home.

55
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:16,853
What was it they said in Helsinki?

56
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:21,174
Sauna is a religion, it purifies the soul.

57
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:23,052
So what is it this time?

58
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:25,558
Sweating me out or is it guilt?

59
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,235
No, here, don't forget
this, it's your present.

60
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:34,561
Pack it along with the rest of your stuff.

61
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:36,210
Let me by please, Mark.

62
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,577
I have no intention of stopping you.

63
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:21,518
The lacerations were very
bad, especially about the neck.

64
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:22,884
But there'll be no scars.

65
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,335
You can reassure her
of that in my absence.

66
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:27,587
What do you think
caused them, Dr. Cross?

67
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:30,730
Some of them could have been
made by a pointed instrument.

68
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,028
But not a knife.

69
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:35,496
The others were definitely
the bites of a vicious animal.

70
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:37,163
I'd say a large dog.

71
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,055
You can remove some of the
bandages after eight days,

72
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,673
but not before.

73
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,262
I'll look at her neck
myself when I get back

74
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:47,947
from the convention.

75
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:49,534
Hopefully by then, you'll have learned us

76
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:51,617
something more about her.

77
00:18:56,654 --> 00:18:59,065
Why won't she let go of the ring?

78
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:01,476
A symptom of catatonic shock.

79
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:03,099
We'll know how serious the situation is

80
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,682
when she regains consciousness.

81
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:23,069
You did it, didn't you?

82
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:24,152
Yes, you did.

83
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:30,689
Good boy.

84
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,458
Killed her, didn't you, boy?

85
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:43,061
Yes you did, didn't you?

86
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:46,908
Good boy.

87
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:16,357
San Cecilia to all units.

88
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:19,186
Be on the alert for a felony hit and run.

89
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,015
Car appears to be a black convertible.

90
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:24,578
Make and license unknown.

91
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:25,495
One four.

92
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:45,832
Who are you?

93
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:47,449
What's your name?

94
00:21:50,749 --> 00:21:52,653
See, Lieutenant, absolutely no response.

95
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,173
Well, we scoured the area
where she was picked up.

96
00:21:55,373 --> 00:21:57,911
We found nothing bigger and
more vicious than a poodle.

97
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:00,126
And nobody's reported a missing woman.

98
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:02,649
How long do you figure
she'll stay like this?

99
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:04,547
Well, that's impossible to say.

100
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:06,633
Something could trigger her any moment.

101
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,151
Or she may remain like
this for quite some time.

102
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:12,549
She said absolutely nothing?

103
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:13,382
Nothing.

104
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:18,699
Except she does keep muttering a word.

105
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,302
Kaja, hakasa, something like that.

106
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:26,669
And she still won't let
go of the key ring, right?

107
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:33,048
Okay, okay, probably some
sort of good luck charm.

108
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:36,331
Hell of a lot of luck
it's brought her, though.

109
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:38,003
Kathy, this is Lieutenant Taylor.

110
00:22:38,203 --> 00:22:38,874
Kathy Logan.

111
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:39,545
Hello.

112
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:40,705
How do you do, Lieutenant?

113
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:41,866
Keys don't mean a thing.

114
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,449
But we're checking.

115
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:53,628
Do you think someone tried to kill her?

116
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:56,928
Maybe, she could have been
dropped from a passing car.

117
00:22:57,128 --> 00:23:00,322
Presuming you're right,
who's ever responsible

118
00:23:00,522 --> 00:23:03,716
hoped she would be dead
by the time she was found.

119
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,570
To me, it seems more likely

120
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,275
she had a breakdown, she
went looking for help,

121
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,640
then she found a car door.

122
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,005
So we're looking for a car.

123
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:16,580
I'll put out an APB.

124
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,444
Someone may have lost it.

125
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:20,672
Call me if she comes up with anything.

126
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:21,922
I'll do that.

127
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:39,499
No further
details are available

128
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:42,403
on the blonde woman found along Route 61

129
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:44,282
in the early hours of the morning.

130
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:46,162
She is in the county general hospital

131
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:47,569
suffering from memory loss

132
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:50,574
and severe facial and body lacerations.

133
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:52,247
Local authorities are making

134
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:54,022
a widespread search of the area.

135
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:55,598
The victim is in her early thirties,

136
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,074
five feet two inches
tall, weighing 110 pounds.

137
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:02,350
Anyone with information
regarding this matter,

138
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,437
please contact the San
Cecilia sheriff's department.

139
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:08,354
Route 61.

140
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:12,763
That's quite a ways from here.

141
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:16,002
You didn't kill her, did you, boy?

142
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:20,704
Never mind, with no memory,
she's as good as dead.

143
00:24:20,904 --> 00:24:23,204
But what if she does remember?

144
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:28,905
What if she remembers it was you?

145
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:32,522
We don't want that to happen, do we, boy?

146
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:43,293
I got a copy.

147
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:46,909
All right, you guys should
be in position by now.

148
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:50,525
I'm just off of 61, after
18 miles from San Cecilia.

149
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:51,829
I'm standing by.

150
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:05,096
Here he comes, I'll run after him.

151
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:25,888
Okay, Car 81, the Lieutenant

152
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:27,622
and I have the rear covered.

153
00:29:27,822 --> 00:29:29,357
Prepare to hit the center.

154
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:35,287
I have it
in sight, I'm moving in.

155
00:29:39,096 --> 00:29:41,929
Let's slow him down.

156
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:48,281
Watch out!

157
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,169
Jesus Christ!

158
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,537
Why don't you go home?

159
00:30:57,737 --> 00:30:58,788
You've had a rough night.

160
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:02,988
Yeah, if she died, I
would have blamed myself.

161
00:31:03,981 --> 00:31:08,078
How were you to know that
someone was trying to kill her?

162
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:10,023
You really think it was someone?

163
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:11,856
Yes, I think it was.

164
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:14,393
Did you tell the Lieutenant?

165
00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:16,000
No, I don't want the police here.

166
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,946
Not 'til we've got her
out of danger and moved.

167
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:20,823
I don't want her left alone one minute

168
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:22,700
until we find out more about this, okay?

169
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,367
Okay. I'll arrange it.

170
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,799
Another 15 minutes,
she would've been dead.

171
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:32,965
Where is she now?

172
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:34,777
She's in an intensive care unit.

173
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,705
The nurse and an orderly on full time.

174
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:39,945
Okay, now you do what
you think is best, doc.

175
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:42,435
We'll keep this from the
press for the moment.

176
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,926
In the meantime, I'll
send a couple of guys

177
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:46,670
down to take a look at the ward.

178
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,414
You didn't touch anything, I hope?

179
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:49,516
Only the patient.

180
00:31:49,716 --> 00:31:51,831
Everything's just as it was.

181
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:53,540
Keep on eye on her, Dr. Martin.

182
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,373
Okay.

183
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,641
Jen, would you get me the department

184
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:06,924
of social anthropology at
the university, please?

185
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:23,310
You say the stone that
forms most of the head

186
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,773
is of a pinkish origin?

187
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:26,991
Yes, but I can't tell
if it's a precious gem

188
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:28,658
or a piece of glass.

189
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:34,665
It's difficult to say exactly

190
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:38,042
without seeing the piece
itself, Dr. Martin.

191
00:32:38,242 --> 00:32:40,215
Drawing's pretty good.

192
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:43,915
I can definitely say it depicts a Kashkuh.

193
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:47,878
Something wrong, Dr. Martin?

194
00:32:48,078 --> 00:32:49,965
No, I've just heard that word before.

195
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:51,523
What's it mean?

196
00:32:51,723 --> 00:32:54,339
Oh, a Kashkuh is of Hittite origin.

197
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,843
It's a deity closely associated
with Mars, the red planet.

198
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,673
I suppose there's more trim than that.

199
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:02,847
All I can tell you is he's
an unpleasant character

200
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,484
dedicated to vengeance,
hatred, and violence.

201
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,234
Not my field, really.

202
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,294
I guess that sort of emotion rebounds

203
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:13,294
on the party seeking it.

204
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:17,179
At worst, it involves the innocent.

205
00:33:18,693 --> 00:33:21,008
It's really an occult method, Dr. Martin.

206
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,907
But you should let me keep
the sketch and I'll see

207
00:33:24,107 --> 00:33:26,806
if I can track down some
authority on the subject.

208
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:27,952
I would appreciate that.

209
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:29,352
- Thanks.
- I'll call you

210
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:30,530
as soon as I can.

211
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,446
Thank you.

212
00:33:31,646 --> 00:33:32,363
All right.

213
00:34:57,201 --> 00:34:59,345
The ward was a complete shambles.

214
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:02,848
But none of the staff
saw anybody go in or out.

215
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:05,161
Could she have done that in her sleep?

216
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:06,556
Maybe, how is she?

217
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:07,639
She's fine.

218
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:10,728
In fact, she seems to have
made quite a recovery.

219
00:35:10,928 --> 00:35:12,200
She said she's hungry.

220
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,097
Have you told anybody else about this?

221
00:35:14,297 --> 00:35:15,514
Nobody but you.

222
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:25,886
Good morning.

223
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,568
My name is Dr. Martin,
this is Nurse Kathy Logan.

224
00:35:31,768 --> 00:35:33,744
I don't want you to worry.

225
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:35,711
A lot has happened.

226
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:37,770
I just want you to be patient

227
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,829
while I explain it to you, okay?

228
00:35:41,564 --> 00:35:44,717
Five days ago, you were found
wandering on Highway 61.

229
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:46,050
Do you remember?

230
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:48,222
I think, no.

231
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,440
You had facial and body lacerations.

232
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:56,931
Am I gonna be disfigured?

233
00:35:57,131 --> 00:35:59,448
No, Dr. Cross is one of the best

234
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:01,014
plastic surgeons there is.

235
00:36:01,214 --> 00:36:03,023
You'll have light scars for a while,

236
00:36:03,223 --> 00:36:04,755
discoloration from the sutures,

237
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,287
but he's asked me to assure you

238
00:36:06,487 --> 00:36:08,002
that in a month or so you're gonna be

239
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:10,502
as beautiful as you ever were.

240
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:13,414
Doctor, who am I?

241
00:36:57,445 --> 00:36:58,278
Fire!

242
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:50,355
You don't ever let go of
that little token, do you?

243
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,522
Um, old habit I suppose.

244
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:56,606
Maybe because it's part of my past.

245
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,118
Do you know where you got it?

246
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,294
If you could remember, it might help us

247
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:03,720
find out who you are.

248
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,553
No.

249
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:09,395
Has Lieutenant Pegler been
able to trace those keys?

250
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:11,536
Not yet, but he will.

251
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,855
You don't seem to be worried
about your past anymore.

252
00:38:15,055 --> 00:38:17,023
I'm just grateful to be alive.

253
00:38:17,223 --> 00:38:18,991
The present seems more important.

254
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:22,550
Calling Dr.
Henry, calling Dr. Henry please.

255
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,023
She seems to look all right.

256
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:27,447
Oh, she's made an
unusually fast recovery.

257
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:30,105
Now all she has to do is remember.

258
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:33,359
They almost tore her to
pieces and tried to kill her.

259
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:36,270
I'm beginning to wonder if it
was such a hell of a good idea

260
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,295
to let her go stay with you.

261
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:41,729
Oh come on, Lieutenant, she's
been looking forward to it.

262
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:44,130
Besides, Dr. Martin thinks she'll get her

263
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,816
memory back more quickly if she does

264
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,577
a few little things around the house.

265
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:49,338
Well, as long whoever tried to kill her

266
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,235
doesn't know where she is.

267
00:38:51,435 --> 00:38:53,872
Well, I'll be there the whole time.

268
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:56,510
We've arranged that with the hospital.

269
00:38:59,363 --> 00:39:00,425
Well, it's all decided.

270
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:03,188
The lieutenant says you
can come and stay with me.

271
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:04,771
Oh, that's great.

272
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:11,042
Come on, let's go before
he changes his mind.

273
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:11,875
Thanks.

274
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:23,279
I hope to hell we're doing
the right thing, Martin.

275
00:39:29,712 --> 00:39:31,282
Morning, Jen.

276
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:32,853
Morning, Doc.

277
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:36,357
Oh, Dr. Martin, Doctor,
Dr. Welsey Edwards called.

278
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,617
He said you would know why.

279
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:39,617
Thank you.

280
00:39:43,106 --> 00:39:45,155
I think I've found
a man who can help you

281
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:47,204
with that evil little idol, Dr. Martin.

282
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:49,830
But it might be better if
you could bring the statuette

283
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,627
with you, if that's possible.

284
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:53,835
I'm very grateful to you, Dr. Edwards.

285
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:55,584
I'll certainly do as you suggest.

286
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:58,027
Look, now let me give
you his name and address

287
00:39:58,227 --> 00:39:59,216
and telephone number just in case

288
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:03,583
you want to call him first
and make an appointment.

289
00:40:04,512 --> 00:40:07,512
Uh huh. Yeah. Thank you very much.

290
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,119
I'll let you know what happens.

291
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,986
Thank you, I'm glad
to be at your service.

292
00:40:18,138 --> 00:40:20,550
How much longer do you
think before I can go?

293
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,875
You can go as soon as Gregg sees you.

294
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:23,508
Okay.

295
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,402
Better get your things together now.

296
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:27,855
Hi.

297
00:40:28,055 --> 00:40:29,725
Well, you're looking great.

298
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:33,296
I do feel a little less
like the man in the iron mask,

299
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:36,668
but I don't see how you
can say I'm looking great.

300
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:40,655
I've had an idea that may
help us find out who you are.

301
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,993
Oh, I'm not so sure I
want to know who I am.

302
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:45,534
Well, you might feel that way now,

303
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,205
but the day will come when you wanna know.

304
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,506
And besides, we can't even
release you until we do know.

305
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:53,227
It's a police matter.

306
00:40:53,427 --> 00:40:54,948
Okay, I'll try.

307
00:40:56,096 --> 00:40:57,145
Good.

308
00:40:57,345 --> 00:41:00,678
Do you have any idea where you got that?

309
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:07,852
I don't know, seems like
I've had it for a long time.

310
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:12,241
What's the matter?

311
00:41:12,441 --> 00:41:14,995
Gregg, I just feel terribly scared.

312
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:16,310
I don't know why.

313
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,427
That's what I intend to find out.

314
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:22,376
I'm gonna need this for a day or so.

315
00:41:22,576 --> 00:41:24,479
There's a man who may be
able to fill us in on it.

316
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,382
And then perhaps we'll
find out where you got it.

317
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:30,017
I'll get it back to you and
Kathy just as soon as I can.

318
00:41:30,217 --> 00:41:32,599
Okay, be careful Gregg.

319
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:35,005
Don't worry, I've got
your good luck charm.

320
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:41,658
Are you sure you know the way?

321
00:41:41,858 --> 00:41:45,237
I'm sure, Rose, now let's
help me find this street.

322
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:46,080
What was it, La-what?

323
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,615
Lanervo, you can't remember anything.

324
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:50,065
The man said Lanervo.

325
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:51,316
I know, I'll remember.

326
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:53,033
What was the name of the street?

327
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:54,046
Lanervo.

328
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:55,996
Very good, Charles.

329
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:00,160
You know we're gonna be
four hours late, don't you?

330
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,398
They're always late when
they come to our house.

331
00:43:02,598 --> 00:43:05,050
So why can't we be late
when we go to theirs?

332
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,503
Because it's not polite,
don't you understand?

333
00:43:07,703 --> 00:43:09,787
Well, we'll never get there
unless we find, what is it?

334
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,370
Lanervo, Lanervo!

335
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:17,214
I'm after him in a back road.

336
00:43:17,414 --> 00:43:19,047
I'm gonna cut him off.

337
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:26,813
It's all right, Rose,
I just have this feeling

338
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:29,482
that we're gonna be out
of here in a minute.

339
00:43:29,682 --> 00:43:32,151
Yeah, sure, I've heard that one before.

340
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:37,287
Oh my! What just happened?

341
00:43:37,487 --> 00:43:38,795
Are you all right, Rose?

342
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:39,910
Oh, I don't know!

343
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,216
Did you see that car?
There was nobody driving it?

344
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:45,795
Now don't worry, I'm driving this car,

345
00:43:45,995 --> 00:43:47,174
I'm getting us to the police station,

346
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,952
report that car and then
we're gonna find Lanervo.

347
00:43:50,152 --> 00:43:51,597
Now don't worry.

348
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:52,430
I won't.

349
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:03,033
Must be
the battery! Damn kids!

350
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:04,659
Oh, hurry, hurry, hurry!

351
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,086
Don't tell me to hurry!

352
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:09,091
Now, I'm taking over and getting
us to the police station.

353
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:12,008
It'll be fine, you'll be all right.

354
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:25,069
You're right, Dr.
Martin, it's early Hittite,

355
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:27,069
rare, and very valuable.

356
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:30,125
A most interesting piece.

357
00:44:34,786 --> 00:44:36,553
Did I see that thing move?

358
00:44:36,753 --> 00:44:38,813
It moved and it would do even more

359
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:41,073
if we removed the ceramic shell.

360
00:44:41,273 --> 00:44:42,252
Ceramic shell?

361
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:44,689
Yes, as you can see, the pieces are

362
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:47,127
rather skillfully concealed, may I?

363
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:47,760
Well.

364
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,794
Removing the ceramic
shell will not only enhance

365
00:44:50,994 --> 00:44:53,828
its value, it'll also
reveal its other qualities.

366
00:44:55,702 --> 00:44:57,728
The Hittites were master workers in iron,

367
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,803
their high priests endowed
certain sacred regalia

368
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:02,864
with extraordinary powers.

369
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:04,725
What about that stone?

370
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:06,487
Well, the stone itself
is of no great value,

371
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,461
it's probably a garnet,
but the color is important.

372
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:12,014
See, this piece is
actually an ideal marriage.

373
00:45:12,214 --> 00:45:14,570
Iron, the strongest
metal then known to man,

374
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,890
and the color red, the
color of the planet Mars,

375
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,210
the planet of vitality,
passion and sexual vigor.

376
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:23,216
How's that?

377
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:30,269
That's incredible.

378
00:45:31,936 --> 00:45:35,439
Tell me, Dr. Martin, are you
trying to sell me this piece

379
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:38,640
or is there some other
reason why you're here?

380
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,051
No, it's not mine to sell.

381
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:42,654
I was hoping you might
be able to identify it

382
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:44,750
and perhaps tell me who it belonged to.

383
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,646
Why should I know
whom the owner might be?

384
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:49,477
You're an authority on the subject.

385
00:45:49,677 --> 00:45:52,860
I assume you know the collectors
who may have owned it.

386
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,731
And why should I give
you this information?

387
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:58,324
I scarcely know you or why you're here.

388
00:45:58,524 --> 00:45:59,197
A little over a week ago,

389
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:01,214
a patient was admitted to the hospital.

390
00:46:01,414 --> 00:46:03,950
She was badly mauled
by some sort of animal.

391
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,080
It caused amnesia.

392
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,571
The next day someone
attempted to kill her.

393
00:46:09,771 --> 00:46:13,211
This little token and the
keys are the only clue

394
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:14,767
we have to her identity.

395
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:16,377
Well, surely if a woman is murdered,

396
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:18,548
that's a matter for the police.

397
00:46:18,748 --> 00:46:21,331
Fortunately, the attempt on
her life was not successful.

398
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:23,454
And I'm happy to report
she's fully recovered,

399
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:25,063
except for her memory.

400
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:27,145
Well, I may be able to help you,

401
00:46:27,345 --> 00:46:29,500
but I'll have to keep
this piece for a few days,

402
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,083
do my own checking.

403
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,794
Something wrong?

404
00:46:33,994 --> 00:46:36,888
Yes, I promised I wouldn't
let it out of my sight.

405
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:39,017
Well, why don't we call her

406
00:46:39,217 --> 00:46:41,146
and see how she feels about it?

407
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,813
Hello?

408
00:47:03,648 --> 00:47:05,871
Hello, Kathy, this
is Gregg, is she there?

409
00:47:06,071 --> 00:47:07,329
Yes, she is, just a minute.

410
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:08,412
It's for you!

411
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:10,780
It's Gregg.

412
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,025
Thank you.

413
00:47:12,225 --> 00:47:13,070
Hello, Doctor.

414
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,836
I'm with a Mr. Denne.

415
00:47:15,036 --> 00:47:15,669
Yes?

416
00:47:16,678 --> 00:47:18,583
I think he might be
of some help but he says

417
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,781
he has to have that statue
and the keys for a few days.

418
00:47:21,981 --> 00:47:22,922
Is that all right?

419
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:25,205
Yes, of course you can.

420
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,453
Okay.

421
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:29,958
Goodbye.

422
00:47:32,774 --> 00:47:35,348
She's agreed to it, Mr. Denne.

423
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:37,808
I hope this isn't gonna be
too much trouble for you.

424
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:40,268
I had no idea you were
confined to a wheelchair.

425
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:41,821
No, it's quite all right.

426
00:47:42,021 --> 00:47:44,938
It'll be something to fill my time.

427
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:53,484
And I can expect to hear
from you in a day or two?

428
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:55,567
As soon as I have news.

429
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:01,850
Thank you, I appreciate it.

430
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,843
Don't worry, I'll take
very good care of it.

431
00:50:45,558 --> 00:50:47,225
Gregg, it's Kathy.

432
00:50:48,787 --> 00:50:49,920
Can you come over here right away?

433
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,170
Something awful's happened.

434
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:17,512
It was incredible, Gregg, and horrible.

435
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:20,066
Her eyes were like living fire.

436
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:23,603
She wasn't at all the person we know.

437
00:51:23,803 --> 00:51:25,866
What's worse, she kept
repeating this word.

438
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:26,558
What word?

439
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:29,075
I'm not sure, I was so frightened.

440
00:51:29,275 --> 00:51:31,593
Sounded like bakta, or something.

441
00:51:31,793 --> 00:51:33,883
Kashkuh? Was it kashkuh?

442
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:35,974
Yes, how did you know?

443
00:51:36,174 --> 00:51:40,341
That's the name of the charm
she's been hanging on to.

444
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:45,130
What do you think is
really wrong with her, Gregg?

445
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,422
I'm not sure, but I think
we're about to find out.

446
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:37,241
It was you, wasn't it?

447
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:39,116
You did it.

448
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:18,654
Do you think Mr. Denne will
be able to help me, Gregg?

449
00:54:18,854 --> 00:54:20,397
Well, he didn't promise
anything definite.

450
00:54:20,597 --> 00:54:23,893
But that little figure is
evidently priceless and very rare

451
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:25,001
and he seemed to think he might be able

452
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:26,144
to locate the person who owns it.

453
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:28,999
Well, if it's priceless and so rare,

454
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,655
why would I have used it on a keychain?

455
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:33,157
Because someone went to
a great deal of trouble

456
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:37,754
to disguise its real value
by encasing it in ceramic.

457
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:39,221
What is it, exactly?

458
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:42,127
It's sort of a religious
face, according to Denne.

459
00:54:42,327 --> 00:54:45,654
Supposed to have strange, magnetic powers.

460
00:54:45,854 --> 00:54:47,987
It also has a name: Kashkuh.

461
00:54:50,173 --> 00:54:52,071
It's still my good luck charm.

462
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:53,920
I'll be glad to have it back.

463
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,570
Can I go with you this time?

464
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,192
No, Denne is sort of a
recluse and he wouldn't like it.

465
00:54:59,392 --> 00:55:00,364
Besides, this is a big day.

466
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:03,231
Kathy's taking you to Dr. Cross.

467
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,325
Oh, don't worry.

468
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:08,596
The discoloration
disappears after a while,

469
00:55:08,796 --> 00:55:10,513
and Cross is fantastic.

470
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,947
I'm gonna go change.

471
00:55:21,523 --> 00:55:23,365
I can't help hoping that Mr. Denne

472
00:55:23,565 --> 00:55:25,675
won't be able to do anything.

473
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:28,077
I'm not accustomed to
having no name and no face

474
00:55:28,277 --> 00:55:29,577
and I feel secure.

475
00:55:30,558 --> 00:55:32,257
Does that sound crazy?

476
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:33,820
No, it's nature's way of protecting you

477
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,012
while you're healing
and trying to remember.

478
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:39,179
I do remember something.

479
00:55:42,082 --> 00:55:44,707
I had a dream last night about a dog.

480
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:46,373
A huge, terrifying dog.

481
00:55:46,573 --> 00:55:47,623
It attacked me.

482
00:55:49,107 --> 00:55:51,419
What were you doing in the dream?

483
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:54,786
I killed it, I battered it to death.

484
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,861
She remembers something
about a dog attacking her.

485
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:02,199
She's gone with Kathy to see Dr. Cross.

486
00:56:02,399 --> 00:56:04,299
Well, we still haven't found any dog.

487
00:56:04,499 --> 00:56:06,399
But we have found a car about 15 miles

488
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:07,956
from where she was picked up.

489
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,313
Has a lot of blood around.

490
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:11,441
I'm having it towed in as soon as I can.

491
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:13,370
I'll need the keys, have you got 'em?

492
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,296
Yeah, but I have an
appointment in half an hour.

493
00:56:16,496 --> 00:56:19,222
Okay, there's no rush,
call me when you get back.

494
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:21,889
Better yet, bring the keys over.

495
00:56:26,797 --> 00:56:29,014
I'm afraid I haven't
had any luck, Dr. Martin.

496
00:56:29,214 --> 00:56:32,264
This item was probably stolen long ago,

497
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:35,844
disguised under the ceramic,

498
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:37,920
and then thrown out by accident.

499
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,348
Your patient probably
found it in a yard sale.

500
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:43,356
I'd like to purchase this piece

501
00:56:43,556 --> 00:56:45,164
if the owner were inclined to sell.

502
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:48,917
I don't think my
patient would agree to it.

503
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:51,568
She considers it her good luck charm.

504
00:56:51,768 --> 00:56:53,467
Forgive me, Doctor,
but aren't you taking

505
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:57,717
something more than just a
professional interest in her?

506
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:01,968
Maybe, but if you met her,
Mr. Denne, you'd understand.

507
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,307
I'm sure.

508
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:04,497
Well, I'm afraid I have to be going.

509
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:06,902
I have an appointment at
the police department.

510
00:57:07,102 --> 00:57:10,654
Mr. Denne, I sure appreciate
all the time you've given me.

511
00:57:10,854 --> 00:57:14,821
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't
do more for both of you.

512
00:57:15,983 --> 00:57:16,983
Thank you.

513
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,047
I have to pick up some
things at the market.

514
00:57:55,247 --> 00:57:57,845
I'll be gone about 15, 20 minutes, okay?

515
00:57:58,045 --> 00:57:59,265
Okay, Kathy.

516
00:57:59,465 --> 00:58:02,905
Don't get any water in those stitches.

517
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:27,806
Will you sign this, please?

518
00:59:55,795 --> 00:59:56,962
Who are you?

519
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,467
Who are you, anyway?

520
01:00:05,343 --> 01:00:06,671
Hello?

521
01:00:06,871 --> 01:00:09,930
Uh, this is Mark Denne, I'd
like to speak to Dr. Martin.

522
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:12,048
Oh, Dr. Martin isn't in, Mr. Denne.

523
01:00:12,248 --> 01:00:13,767
Oh, that's too bad.

524
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:17,384
He's probably on his way to me right now.

525
01:00:18,339 --> 01:00:19,777
I have some important information for him

526
01:00:19,977 --> 01:00:21,459
about a patient of his.

527
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,159
I was delayed in town.

528
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:24,660
I'm the patient.

529
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:28,134
Oh, well then, it's good
that I'm talking to you.

530
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:31,608
I've come across something
that I think might help,

531
01:00:31,808 --> 01:00:33,941
but why don't I pick you up?

532
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:36,880
We can go out to my place.

533
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,917
I'll call my housekeeper and tell her

534
01:00:39,117 --> 01:00:40,954
to keep Dr. Martin until we arrive.

535
01:00:41,154 --> 01:00:43,204
Or, aren't you well enough?

536
01:00:44,362 --> 01:00:46,742
Oh, I'm fine, I'd love that.

537
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:49,777
Good, I'll pick you up
in about half an hour.

538
01:00:49,977 --> 01:00:51,208
Would you mind waiting for me outside?

539
01:00:51,408 --> 01:00:53,116
I'm something of a cripple.

540
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,899
Yes, Gregg mentioned it.

541
01:00:55,099 --> 01:00:56,483
I'm very grateful to you.

542
01:00:56,683 --> 01:01:00,341
Not at all, I'm looking
forward to meeting you.

543
01:02:13,849 --> 01:02:15,250
Lieutenant, has that car arrived yet?

544
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,252
Yeah, yeah, it's on its way.

545
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:19,054
Where the hell have you been?

546
01:02:19,254 --> 01:02:21,245
Well, it's a long
drive from Denne's house.

547
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:22,508
Have you got the keys and the charm?

548
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:23,926
Yeah.

549
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:25,543
Let me have it.

550
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,794
What did you find out about this?

551
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:38,516
So you've never visited this
part of California before?

552
01:02:38,716 --> 01:02:42,033
Not unless it's part of
everything else I've forgotten.

553
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:44,365
Have you ever considered
that a loss of memory

554
01:02:44,565 --> 01:02:46,817
could sometimes be a distinct advantage?

555
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:50,962
I did until Gregg, uh,
Dr. Martin, pointed out that

556
01:02:51,162 --> 01:02:52,975
there might be someone who needed me.

557
01:02:53,175 --> 01:02:55,847
Especially since I was
wearing a wedding ring.

558
01:02:56,047 --> 01:02:58,051
You don't have it on now, I see.

559
01:02:58,251 --> 01:02:59,590
They had to cut it off.

560
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,529
My hand was infected and
swollen from the bites.

561
01:03:02,729 --> 01:03:03,362
Bites?

562
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:06,124
Dr. Cross says that
I was probably attacked

563
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:09,207
by some large animal, probably a dog.

564
01:03:40,243 --> 01:03:42,704
Oh, it looks as though
we got here before him.

565
01:03:42,904 --> 01:03:47,071
Never mind, we'll go inside
and wait until he arrives.

566
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:56,882
Don't feel sorry for me, Kim.

567
01:03:57,082 --> 01:03:59,489
Kim? You just called me Kim, why?

568
01:03:59,689 --> 01:04:03,856
I don't know, I suppose
you remind me of someone.

569
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,858
Lovely house, Mr. Denne.

570
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:13,146
Thank you.

571
01:04:13,346 --> 01:04:17,513
My wife hated it and
everything in it, including me.

572
01:04:29,684 --> 01:04:31,637
Now, here's something that I think

573
01:04:31,837 --> 01:04:33,950
you will find interesting.

574
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,200
Right this way.

575
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,209
As you can see, she had everything

576
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:40,488
that a woman could possibly want.

577
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:43,265
Even a sauna.

578
01:04:46,932 --> 01:04:48,645
It always seemed the
height of luxury to me

579
01:04:48,845 --> 01:04:49,978
to have a sauna.

580
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:54,408
And you always dreamed of
someday having one of your own?

581
01:04:54,608 --> 01:04:56,444
Doesn't seem to matter anymore.

582
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:59,943
If I had one, then now
it's no longer important.

583
01:05:00,143 --> 01:05:03,180
And what is important to you now?

584
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,417
That you should regain your memory?

585
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:08,108
I'm not sure.

586
01:05:08,308 --> 01:05:10,851
I know I should, and
Gregg says it's important,

587
01:05:11,051 --> 01:05:13,347
but somehow I feel happier now.

588
01:05:13,547 --> 01:05:15,843
I feel happier than I've ever been.

589
01:05:16,043 --> 01:05:17,901
I want to stay that way.

590
01:05:18,101 --> 01:05:19,959
A new life with what I have.

591
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:21,459
With Dr. Martin.

592
01:05:22,944 --> 01:05:24,841
You love him, don't you?

593
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:26,975
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

594
01:05:27,175 --> 01:05:31,218
You're my wife, I'm
your husband, you hear me?

595
01:05:31,418 --> 01:05:35,462
It was my dog, my dog
that bit you in the face.

596
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:39,052
Let me out! Let me out!

597
01:06:22,305 --> 01:06:23,638
That's got it.

598
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:36,830
What's the matter?

599
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:39,451
Nothing, it's a strange feeling,

600
01:06:39,651 --> 01:06:42,073
like it's ready to jump out at you.

601
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:45,282
If it does, I'll have
it booked and locked up.

602
01:06:45,482 --> 01:06:47,115
I promise you, Doctor.

603
01:06:58,388 --> 01:07:00,221
It's a car, all right.

604
01:07:04,223 --> 01:07:06,403
Here's a rundown on
the plates, Lieutenant.

605
01:07:06,603 --> 01:07:07,854
Who's the owner?

606
01:07:08,054 --> 01:07:10,554
A Mrs. Kim Denne, D-E-N-N-E.

607
01:07:13,943 --> 01:07:16,776
Hey! Where the hell are you going?

608
01:08:26,371 --> 01:08:30,538
Get out of the way! Get the
cars out of here right away!

609
01:08:40,972 --> 01:08:43,923
Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?

610
01:08:44,123 --> 01:08:45,173
I'll catch him.

611
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,650
Pull over, you freak!

612
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:55,909
Who's in there?

613
01:08:57,018 --> 01:08:57,851
Shit!

614
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:30,038
Watch out!

615
01:11:35,411 --> 01:11:37,661
Jesus Christ!

616
01:12:20,993 --> 01:12:21,826
Fire!

617
01:13:11,079 --> 01:13:12,140
Hurry, John, hurry!

618
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,670
Don't tell me to hurry!

619
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:15,772
Now I'm taking over and
getting us to the...

620
01:15:26,346 --> 01:15:27,371
Is she here?

621
01:15:27,571 --> 01:15:28,204
No.

622
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:33,014
Oh Gregg, I couldn't have
been more than 20 minutes.

623
01:15:33,214 --> 01:15:36,280
It's okay. I want you
to call Lieutenant Pigler.

624
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,891
Give him this address and directions.

625
01:15:38,091 --> 01:15:39,108
I'm on my way there now.

626
01:15:39,308 --> 01:15:42,308
Kathy, everything will be all right.

627
01:17:58,144 --> 01:18:00,811
Where in the hell has it gone?

628
01:18:07,786 --> 01:18:09,177
Lieutenant Pigler?

629
01:18:09,377 --> 01:18:10,569
Come in, Lieutenant.

630
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,462
Lieutenant Pigler, come in.

631
01:18:12,662 --> 01:18:14,983
We've just received a
call from a Nurse Logan.

632
01:18:15,183 --> 01:18:17,910
Dr. Martin is on his
way to 8160 Roma Road,

633
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,353
four miles west of San
Cecilia, code 20,001.

634
01:18:21,553 --> 01:18:24,796
Okay. Get a couple of
back-up cars out there.

635
01:18:24,996 --> 01:18:26,663
I'm on my way.

636
01:18:26,863 --> 01:18:27,496
Ten-four.

637
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:52,097
Foolproof, the alibi
is absolutely foolproof.

638
01:18:52,297 --> 01:18:56,958
Yes, she was my wife, and
yes, she did go for a drive,

639
01:18:57,158 --> 01:18:58,532
taking the dog with her.

640
01:18:58,732 --> 01:19:00,484
I didn't think anything of it

641
01:19:00,684 --> 01:19:03,940
because she'd gone off by
herself on several occasions,

642
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,396
for two or three days at a
time, so I made no inquiries.

643
01:19:07,596 --> 01:19:09,780
Then, eventually, I heard
from her, calling from

644
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:13,416
Miss Logan's apartment, asked
me to come and pick her up.

645
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:16,289
When I did, I found out
about the automobile crash.

646
01:19:16,489 --> 01:19:20,421
It was then that I learned
that the dog had savaged her,

647
01:19:20,621 --> 01:19:23,270
a panic, and wounded, crashed,

648
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:25,919
eventually died from those wounds.

649
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:29,127
Well, we got back home and
she wanted to take a sauna,

650
01:19:29,327 --> 01:19:31,030
her favorite form of relaxation.

651
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:34,415
I naturally advised against
it in her weakened condition,

652
01:19:34,615 --> 01:19:35,716
but she wouldn't pay any attention to me,

653
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:37,299
so she had her way.

654
01:19:39,603 --> 01:19:42,392
I woke up this morning
and I discovered her,

655
01:19:42,592 --> 01:19:44,142
tragically, too late.

656
01:19:47,703 --> 01:19:50,370
Absolutely foolproof, foolproof.

657
01:22:19,529 --> 01:22:20,362
Kim!

658
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:26,872
Kim!

659
01:22:30,974 --> 01:22:31,807
Kim!

660
01:22:36,976 --> 01:22:37,809
Kim!

661
01:22:41,532 --> 01:22:42,365
Kim!

662
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:05,916
Kim!

663
01:23:46,052 --> 01:23:47,635
Holy mother of God.

664
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:15,289
Kim?

665
01:24:15,489 --> 01:24:16,822
Do you need out?
