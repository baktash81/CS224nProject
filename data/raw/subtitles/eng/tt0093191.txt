1
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:27,340
When the child was a child,
it walked with its arms swinging.

2
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:32,054
It wanted the stream to be a river,
the river a torrent...

3
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:36,182
and this puddle to be the sea.

4
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:40,655
When the child was a child,
it didn't know it was a child.

5
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:46,022
Everything was full of life,
and all life was one.

6
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:50,813
When the child was a child,
it had no opinion about anything.

7
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:52,336
It had no habits.

8
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:56,291
It often sat cross-legged,
took off running...

9
00:00:56,463 --> 00:01:01,298
had a cowlick in its hair,
and didn't pull a face...

10
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:03,215
when photographed.

11
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,696
Look.

12
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:16,822
The consolation of lifting one's head
out here in the open...

13
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:20,817
of seeing the colours
enlightened by the sun...

14
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:23,941
in all men's eyes.

15
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:27,773
At last mad, no longer alone.

16
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:32,573
At last mad, at last redeemed.
At last mad, at last at peace.

17
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:34,973
At last an internal light.

18
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:40,137
We're approaching Berlin Tegel, the
no-smoking sign has been turned on.

19
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,535
Please stop smoking
until you're inside the airport.

20
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:04,899
There's a little house
with two floors and a terrace.

21
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:08,419
And every day we go bathing.

22
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,620
The man who lives there
is called Peter...

23
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:32,816
Pretty picture.

24
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,134
Nothing good to see on TV.

25
00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:12,141
You stumble over your colours,
and are never punctual.

26
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:28,933
Still the same smell. But dustier.
She collected everything.

27
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:31,663
Stamps, postcards.

28
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:37,580
Even U-Bahn tickets.
She never threw anything away.

29
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:42,214
Mother. My mother.
She never was.

30
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:45,819
My father...
My father was my father.

31
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:51,535
She is dead.
No tears, no grief. Maybe later.

32
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:57,141
Dependant on everybody.
My sister. I have to get out of here.

33
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:24,979
She's never loved me.
And you also just pretend.

34
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,703
Be glad that they forgot about you.

35
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:31,902
Want to die immediately,
don't want to go on living.

36
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:42,252
My God, what will become of the boy?
He's only got music on his mind.

37
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:49,132
What does he want now?

38
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:54,536
I already bought him a guitar.
Does he wants drums now?

39
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:03,340
I'm slowly getting fed up with it.
Won't he ever grow up?

40
00:08:04,663 --> 00:08:10,454
No really, I'm getting fed up.
I don't want to go on with this.

41
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:17,335
No really, this has to stop some time.
I can't help him any more.

42
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:22,742
No wonder, he only learnt rock 'n' roll.

43
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:27,738
Maybe he'll get a grip on himself
one day.

44
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:44,058
When the child was a child,
it was the time of these questions:

45
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:48,774
Why am I me, and why not you?

46
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:53,494
Why am I here, and why not there?

47
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:58,691
When did time begin,
and where does space end?

48
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:02,936
Isn't life under the sun
just a dream?

49
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:11,936
Isn't what I see, hear and smell just a
mirage of the world before the world?

50
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:17,496
Does evil actually exist,
and people who are really evil?

51
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:26,976
How can it be that I, the one I am,
wasn't there before I was there...

52
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:34,538
and that some time I, the one I am,
no longer will be the one I am?

53
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:43,058
The child needs oxygen.
Breathe deep down.

54
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:46,340
If I could only suffer in her place.
- It hurts.

55
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:51,577
It'll be over soon.
- It's almost over.

56
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:58,091
Poor little mite, I'm anxious to see you.
I wonder what you look like.

57
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:04,133
You bastard. You bastard.
- Women will fuck up your life.

58
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:09,935
Blackie, I think I got lost.
We wanted to go to the cemetery...

59
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:40,856
Well?

60
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:53,414
Sunrise at 7.22 am, sunset at 4.28 pm.
Moonrise at 7.04 pm, moonset...

61
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,051
Level of the Havel and the Spree...

62
00:10:56,223 --> 00:11:01,820
20 years ago today, a Soviet jet fighter
crashed into the lakes at Spandau.

63
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:05,942
50 years ago, there were...
- The Olympic Games.

64
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:11,818
200 years ago,
the first balloon flew over the city.

65
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:16,142
Like the fugitives the other day.
- And today...

66
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:19,659
Lilienthaler Chaussee:
A man slows down...

67
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:23,338
and looks over his shoulder
into space.

68
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:27,696
Someone who wants
to put an end to it...

69
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:30,741
put first-issue stamps
on his farewell letters.

70
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,256
A different one on each.

71
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:37,099
Then he spoke English
with an American soldier...

72
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:41,336
for the first time since his schooldays,
fluently.

73
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:48,618
Just before dashing his head against
the wall, a prisoner said: "Now."

74
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:52,219
Instead of the station's name,
the guard...

75
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:56,012
suddenly shouted: "Tierra del Fuego."
- Nice.

76
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,380
An old man was reading
the Odyssey to a child...

77
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:04,378
and the young listener
stopped blinking his eyes.

78
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:06,977
And what do you have to tell?

79
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:15,934
A passer-by who, in the rain,
folded her umbrella and was drenched.

80
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:23,140
A schoolboy who described
to his teacher a fern growing...

81
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,737
and the astounded teacher.

82
00:12:27,303 --> 00:12:32,331
A blind woman, who groped her watch,
feeling my presence.

83
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:37,813
It's great to live by the spirit,
to testify for eternity...

84
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:41,532
only what is spiritual
in people's minds.

85
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:46,732
But sometimes I'm fed up
with my spiritual existence...

86
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:48,814
of forever hovering above.

87
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:51,338
I'd like to feel a weight in me...

88
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:55,018
to end the infinity,
and to tie me to earth.

89
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:59,062
I'd like at each step,
each gust of wind...

90
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:02,818
to be able to say:
"Now, now and now."

91
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,622
No longer:
"Forever" and "For eternity".

92
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:10,459
Sit at the empty place at a card table,
be greeted...

93
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,739
even by a nod.

94
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:17,931
Every time we participated,
it was a pretence.

95
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:23,499
Wrestling, allowing a hip to be put out,
in pretence...

96
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:25,938
catching a fish in pretence.

97
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:31,416
In pretence, sitting at tables
drinking and eating in pretence.

98
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:36,611
Having lambs roasted and wine served
in the tents in the desert...

99
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,614
only in pretence.

100
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:43,299
I don't have to beget a child
or plant a tree...

101
00:13:43,463 --> 00:13:47,854
but it would be nice,
coming home after a long day...

102
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:51,811
to feed the cat like Philip Marlowe...

103
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:56,340
to have a fever,
blackened fingers from the newspaper.

104
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:02,176
To be excited not only by the mind,
but by a meal.

105
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:07,136
By the line of a neck,
by an ear.

106
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,221
To lie.

107
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,613
Through one's teeth.

108
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:17,458
As you're walking,
to feel your bones moving along.

109
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,820
At last to guess
instead of always knowing.

110
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:25,977
To be able to say:
"Ah" and "Oh" and "Hey"...

111
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:29,692
instead of: "Yes and amen."
- Yes.

112
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:32,935
To be able to enthuse for evil...

113
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:36,857
to draw all the demons
from the passers-by...

114
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,935
and to chase them out into the world.

115
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:42,333
To be a savage.

116
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:48,818
Or to feel how it is to take off
your shoes under the table...

117
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:53,738
and to wriggle your toes, barefoot,
like that...

118
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:59,214
Stay alone.

119
00:14:59,383 --> 00:15:02,932
Let things happen. Keep serious.

120
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:07,813
We can only be savages
in as much as we keep serious.

121
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:12,932
Do no more than look.
Assemble, testify, preserve.

122
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:19,534
Remain spirit.
Keep your distance. Keep your word.

123
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:24,140
Look, a convertible.
You don't buy that, you steal it.

124
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,612
Or it's stolen from you.
- Imagine...

125
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:30,935
Open the roof, leave the smog behind.
- In a pimpmobile.

126
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:11,338
Tell me, muse, the storyteller...

127
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:15,462
he who has been thrust
to the edge of the world...

128
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:22,540
both an infant and an ancient,
and through him reveal Everyman.

129
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:36,576
With time, those who listened to me
became my readers.

130
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:40,372
They no longer sit in a circle,
but apart...

131
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:44,331
and one doesn't know anything
about the other.

132
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:54,456
I'm an old man,
with a broken voice...

133
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:59,538
but the story
still rises from the depths...

134
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:02,422
and the slowly opened mouth...

135
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,815
repeats it as clearly
as it does powerfully.

136
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:12,501
A liturgy for which no one
needs to be initiated...

137
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:16,941
to the meaning
of the words and sentences.

138
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:30,539
Maybe she doesn't have the money
to see another doctor.

139
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:35,739
4 years since I saw her,
she's been sick for 2.

140
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:40,613
When will you pray with your
own words, and not for eternal life?

141
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:46,141
And then these young girls
make eyes at men...

142
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:50,262
So why am I living? Why am I living?

143
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:59,814
How will I pay?
With my small pension.

144
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:14,701
You're lost,
it can go on for a long time.

145
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:17,536
Abandoned by parents,
betrayed by wife.

146
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:21,821
Friend in another town,
your children only recall your stutter.

147
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:26,215
You could hit yourself
as you look in the mirror.

148
00:22:26,383 --> 00:22:30,979
What's that?
What's going on?

149
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:35,534
I'm still there.
If I want it, if I only want it.

150
00:22:36,863 --> 00:22:40,412
I must want it,
then I can get out of it again.

151
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,814
I let myself go,
I can drag myself out again.

152
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:46,543
Of course, mother was right.

153
00:22:57,383 --> 00:23:00,500
Hey, two Marks.
- No, it's a beer top.

154
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:02,733
Nonsense, let's pull it up.

155
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:08,696
Only 10 Pfennigs.

156
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:15,741
"You bet?" was great last night.
- It wasn't on last night.

157
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:18,781
A few days ago, or a month...

158
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:26,378
I'm all alone,
just mad on my own...

159
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:30,934
three at play,
that'll be the day.

160
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:44,937
5 years ago.
- And they lived happily ever after.

161
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:08,053
Marion, not like that. Mon dieu.

162
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:13,695
What is this?
With a swing, not with force.

163
00:24:13,863 --> 00:24:17,697
What are you doing?
Don't dangle, fly.

164
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:21,936
You are an angel.
- For heaven's sake.

165
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:25,816
And for my sake, too.

166
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:30,135
I can't fly with these things.
- Yes, you can.

167
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:36,094
It's easier with wings than without.
- Not with these chicken feathers.

168
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,931
What did she say?
- These wings bother her.

169
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:51,177
Marion, just imagine you're a dove.
- You bunch of sparrows.

170
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:56,421
What are you playing at?
Sounds like a firemen's ball.

171
00:24:56,583 --> 00:25:01,259
That's enough.
Concentrate, Marion.

172
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:04,415
She works hard
with those chicken feathers.

173
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:08,974
Marion, make an effort.
- Make an effort.

174
00:25:09,143 --> 00:25:13,739
Of course, I make an effort.
What do you think I'm doing?

175
00:25:15,303 --> 00:25:20,536
I'd have fallen on your heads long ago,
if I didn't make an effort.

176
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:28,416
One moment, please.

177
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:34,532
Hold everything. We can't pay the rent
and the electricity.

178
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:36,056
We're broke.

179
00:25:37,423 --> 00:25:43,692
So tomorrow we'll take things down,
pull the caravans to winter quarters.

180
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:49,540
The bailiff's been.
This is it for the circus this year.

181
00:25:49,703 --> 00:25:51,375
I'm sorry.

182
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:54,740
It's over. Not even a season.

183
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:58,976
Once again,
no time to bring something to an end.

184
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:03,739
Tonight the last night
of my good old number.

185
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:05,621
And it's a full moon.

186
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:10,698
And the trapeze artist
comes tumbling down...

187
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,013
Tais-toi. Be quiet.

188
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:19,213
I never imagined it like that,
the farewell to the circus.

189
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:25,535
The last evening, no one shows up,
you play like fools...

190
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:29,935
and I fly around the ring
like a poor chicken.

191
00:26:31,263 --> 00:26:37,941
And then I'm a waitress again.
Merde.

192
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:43,617
Moments like that,
like right now...

193
00:26:43,783 --> 00:26:47,412
a beautiful memory
in 10 years time.

194
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:53,818
Time will heal everything,
but what if time was the illness?

195
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:58,181
As if sometimes one had to lean over
to go on living.

196
00:26:58,343 --> 00:27:02,939
To live... A look is enough.

197
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:05,776
The circus... I'll miss it.

198
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:10,255
It's funny.
It's the end, and I don't feel a thing.

199
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:12,095
An angel passes by.

200
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,938
I must stop
having a bad conscience.

201
00:27:21,463 --> 00:27:24,535
As if pain had no past.

202
00:27:24,703 --> 00:27:27,775
It always stops
when it's only just starting...

203
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:31,015
to be too good to be true.

204
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,697
At last outside, in the city.

205
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:38,618
Find out who I am,
who I have become.

206
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:43,413
Most of the time,
I'm too aware to be sad.

207
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:49,419
I waited an eternity
to hear a loving word.

208
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,733
Then I went abroad.

209
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:56,931
Someone who'd say:
"I love you so much today."

210
00:27:57,983 --> 00:28:01,737
That would be wonderful.

211
00:28:01,903 --> 00:28:07,660
I look up and the world
appears before my eyes...

212
00:28:07,823 --> 00:28:10,542
and fills my heart.

213
00:28:13,503 --> 00:28:18,531
As a child,
I wanted to live on an island.

214
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:24,534
A woman alone, gloriously alone.

215
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,538
Yes, that's it.

216
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:44,739
Everything so empty, incompatible.

217
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:48,737
Emptiness, fear.

218
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:52,418
La peur, la peur, la peur...

219
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,936
Fear.

220
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:02,742
Like a small animal,
lost in the woods.

221
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:05,701
Who are you?
I don't know any more.

222
00:29:05,863 --> 00:29:11,256
But I do know:
I will no longer be a trapeze artist.

223
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:22,539
Must not cry. That's how it is.

224
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:27,413
It happens,
not always as you'd like it.

225
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:31,735
Emptiness, such emptiness...

226
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:20,134
What shall I do?

227
00:30:23,183 --> 00:30:27,540
Not think any more.
Just be there.

228
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:33,811
Berlin... Here I'm a stranger,
and yet it's all so familiar.

229
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:38,818
You can't get lost,
you always end up at the Wall.

230
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:45,218
I'm waiting for my photo at a machine,
and it comes out with another face.

231
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:48,932
That could be the beginning of a story.

232
00:30:49,103 --> 00:30:53,415
The faces... I'd like to see faces.

233
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:56,734
Maybe I'll find a job as a waitress.

234
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:10,936
This evening scares me.

235
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:14,539
It's silly, fear makes me sick.

236
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:19,936
Only part of me worries,
the other part doesn't believe in it.

237
00:31:23,663 --> 00:31:29,135
How should I live?
Maybe that's not the question.

238
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,942
How should I think?

239
00:31:37,303 --> 00:31:43,333
I know so little. Maybe
because I'm always just curious.

240
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:45,733
Sometimes I think so wrongly...

241
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:50,931
because I'm thinking
as if I was talking to someone else.

242
00:31:55,383 --> 00:32:00,582
Inside closed eyes,
close the eyes again.

243
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:04,421
Then even the stones come alive.

244
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:44,737
To be with the colours.

245
00:32:44,903 --> 00:32:48,134
Les couleurs. The colours.

246
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:56,938
Neon lights in the evening sky,
the red and yellow S-Bahn.

247
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:06,293
Longing... longing.

248
00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:09,739
I only need to be ready.

249
00:33:10,983 --> 00:33:15,738
Longing for a wave of love
that would stir in me.

250
00:33:18,783 --> 00:33:24,938
That's what makes me clumsy,
the absence of desire.

251
00:33:31,223 --> 00:33:33,942
Desire to love.

252
00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:44,936
Desire to love.

253
00:34:29,463 --> 00:34:33,422
Don't stare.
Have you never seen anyone die?

254
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:38,737
I stink of gasoline.
I can't just... It was all so clear.

255
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:42,532
The way they're standing there,
staring at me.

256
00:34:42,703 --> 00:34:46,935
I should have told her yesterday
that I'm sorry...

257
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:52,814
I can't simply...
I've still got so much to do...

258
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:57,738
As I came up the mountain
out of the misty valley into the sun...

259
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:05,417
The fire on the cattle range,
the potatoes in the ashes...

260
00:35:06,663 --> 00:35:10,099
the boathouse floating on the lake.

261
00:35:10,263 --> 00:35:15,417
The Southern Cross. The Far East.

262
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:22,136
The Great North. The Wild West.

263
00:35:22,303 --> 00:35:29,937
The Great Bear Lake.
The Tristan de Cunha Island.

264
00:35:31,183 --> 00:35:37,736
The Mississippi Delta. Stromboli.

265
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:45,942
The old houses of Charlottenburg.
Albert Camus.

266
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:54,536
The morning light.
The eyes of the child.

267
00:35:56,183 --> 00:35:59,539
Swimming near the waterfall.

268
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:07,411
The spots of the first drops of rain.
The sun.

269
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:13,533
The bread and wine. Hopping.

270
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:19,414
Easter. The veins of the leaves.

271
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:25,818
The blowing grass.
The colours of the stones.

272
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:30,534
The pebbles on the stream's bed.

273
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:34,252
The white tablecloth outdoors.

274
00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:38,257
The dream of the house in the house.

275
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:42,462
The dear one asleep
in the next room.

276
00:36:42,623 --> 00:36:48,334
The peaceful Sunday.
The horizon.

277
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:52,542
The light from the room
in the garden.

278
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:58,733
The night flight.
Riding a bicycle with no hands.

279
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,811
The beautiful stranger.

280
00:37:04,143 --> 00:37:05,496
My father.

281
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:08,936
My mother.

282
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,416
My wife.

283
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:15,976
My child.

284
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:36,933
The world seems to be sinking
into dust, but I recount...

285
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:38,855
as in the beginning...

286
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,538
in my sing-song voice,
which sustains me...

287
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:46,935
saved by the tale
from present troubles...

288
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:50,937
and protected for the future.

289
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:10,053
Finished with the sweeping
over the centuries as in the past.

290
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:14,819
Now I can think only day by day.

291
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:20,660
My heroes are no longer
the warriors and kings...

292
00:38:20,823 --> 00:38:27,535
but the things of peace,
one equal to the other.

293
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:34,859
The drying onions equal
to the tree trunk crossing the marsh.

294
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:42,976
But no one has so far succeeded
in singing an epic of peace.

295
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:48,934
What is wrong with peace
that its inspiration doesn't endure...

296
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:55,178
and that its story is hardly told?

297
00:38:59,383 --> 00:39:02,420
Must I give up now?

298
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:07,611
If I do give up,
then mankind will lose its storyteller.

299
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:11,822
And once mankind
loses its storyteller...

300
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:15,737
it will also lose its childhood.

301
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:30,302
I cannot find the Potsdamer Platz.

302
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:38,578
Here? This can't be it.

303
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:44,340
Potsdamer Platz,
that's where Cafe Josti used to be.

304
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:51,215
In the afternoons, I went there
to chat and to drink a coffee...

305
00:39:51,383 --> 00:39:53,260
and to watch the crowd.

306
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:57,211
Before that I smoked my cigar
at Loese and Wolf...

307
00:39:57,383 --> 00:40:00,739
a renowned tobacconist.

308
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:02,859
Just across from here.

309
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:10,536
This can't be the Potsdamer Platz.

310
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:17,414
And no one whom you can ask.

311
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:26,856
It was a lively place.
Tramways, horse-drawn carriages...

312
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:33,656
and two cars:
Mine and that of the chocolate shop.

313
00:40:34,983 --> 00:40:39,374
The Wertheim store was here, too.

314
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:46,142
And then suddenly,
the flags appeared.

315
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:48,055
Here...

316
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:54,138
The whole Platz
was covered with them.

317
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:59,741
And the people
weren't friendly anymore...

318
00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:03,896
and the police wasn't either.

319
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:07,851
I will not give up...

320
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:13,017
as long as I haven't found
the Potsdamer Platz.

321
00:41:17,863 --> 00:41:22,379
Where are my heroes?
Where are you, my children?

322
00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:27,412
Where are my own, the dull-witted...

323
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,539
the original ones?

324
00:41:38,703 --> 00:41:43,413
Name me, muse,
the immortal singer...

325
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:48,099
who,
abandoned by his mortal audience...

326
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:49,742
Iost his voice.

327
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:52,815
He who,
from angel of poetry that he was...

328
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:58,376
became the organ grinder
ignored or mocked...

329
00:41:58,543 --> 00:42:02,695
outside,
on the threshold of no man's land.

330
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:32,135
20 Marks, 40 Marks, 80 Marks.
In a week I could have 500.

331
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:34,453
Off to the south.

332
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,093
What a crazy idea to stand here.
Too much traffic.

333
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:41,141
Idiot,
three times he's been this way.

334
00:42:41,303 --> 00:42:43,976
I want to get out of here.

335
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:48,933
If anyone recognises me, I'll be
thrown out of secondary school.

336
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:52,732
I need Klaus,
he'd take good care of me.

337
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:57,818
He was so good, too good.
And now he's dead.

338
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:10,132
Are there still borders?
More than ever.

339
00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:15,696
Each street has its own border line.

340
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:19,253
Between each plot
there's a no man's land strip...

341
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,052
hidden by a hedge or by a ditch.

342
00:43:23,223 --> 00:43:26,693
Who dares,
will fall on booby traps...

343
00:43:26,863 --> 00:43:29,696
or be hit by laser beams.

344
00:43:29,863 --> 00:43:34,414
The trout in the water
are really torpedoes.

345
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:38,542
Every proprietor, or even tenant...

346
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:41,376
sticks up his nameplate
like a coat of arms...

347
00:43:41,543 --> 00:43:44,501
and studies the paper
like a world leader.

348
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:49,418
The German people are divided into as
many states as there are individuals.

349
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:53,098
And these small states are mobile.

350
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,379
Each one takes his own with him...

351
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:59,252
and demands a toll
when another wants to enter.

352
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:05,862
In the form of a fly in amber
or a leather bottle.

353
00:44:06,023 --> 00:44:07,741
So much for the border.

354
00:44:07,903 --> 00:44:13,773
But one can only enter each state
with the right passwords.

355
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:36,935
Today's German soul can only
be conquered and governed...

356
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:41,460
by he who arrives at each small state
with the password.

357
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:44,979
Fortunately,
no one is now able to do so.

358
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:51,662
So everyone migrates and
raises his own flag all over the world.

359
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:54,291
Even their children
shake their rattles...

360
00:44:54,463 --> 00:44:57,739
and trail their filth around
in circles.

361
00:49:07,103 --> 00:49:09,059
The medals reflect the best.

362
00:49:09,223 --> 00:49:12,135
They were elegant,
those brothers.

363
00:49:12,303 --> 00:49:14,942
Could I have light?
- But no flame.

364
00:49:15,103 --> 00:49:17,333
You're welcome.
- Thank you.

365
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:22,898
The only thing I shall miss
from the outside...

366
00:49:23,063 --> 00:49:27,181
from the realm of light,
will be sparrows.

367
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:30,016
Money buys happiness.
How to live?

368
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:32,902
The Man in the Golden Helmet
is a swindle.

369
00:49:33,063 --> 00:49:37,341
You're not natives,
you're all refugees.

370
00:49:37,503 --> 00:49:39,937
You're wet from swimming.

371
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:43,618
I've been sitting here
since this morning...

372
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:45,614
I'm so cold and bored.

373
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:49,856
Wind in the face,
the first snow in the air.

374
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:52,099
Water in the gutter.

375
00:49:52,263 --> 00:49:55,255
The balcony
with the beautiful stranger.

376
00:49:55,423 --> 00:50:00,099
Real ones. They look like it.
They could be real ones.

377
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,414
Some stole food from the dogs
in the camps.

378
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:09,135
That would take the grin off your face.
Don't be too sure yet.

379
00:50:09,303 --> 00:50:13,455
The Frenchman.
I met him in the streets.

380
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:18,219
"Berlin won't be there any more,"
Constant said.

381
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:24,777
The house was half gone.
Some of it still stood. For how long?

382
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:27,298
Yes, I can still see this woman...

383
00:50:27,463 --> 00:50:34,619
who was standing up there
in the ruins shaking the duvet.

384
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:39,698
When was that?
May... June 1945.

385
00:51:02,383 --> 00:51:07,138
Is he good at what he's doing?
It seems so.

386
00:51:23,943 --> 00:51:28,334
I'd like to see it.
Maybe he'll give it to me.

387
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:28,376
Come, I'll show you something else.

388
00:54:59,623 --> 00:55:05,255
When the child was a child
it choked on spinach, peas...

389
00:55:05,423 --> 00:55:08,733
rice pudding
and steamed cauliflower...

390
00:55:08,903 --> 00:55:13,419
and now eats all of that,
and not just because it has to.

391
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:18,452
When the child was a child,
it woke up once in a strange bed...

392
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:20,818
but now time and time again.

393
00:55:20,983 --> 00:55:26,376
Many people seemed beautiful then,
nowadays it's only the odd one.

394
00:55:26,543 --> 00:55:32,982
It had a precise picture of Paradise,
and now can only guess at it.

395
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:38,740
It couldn't imagine nothingness,
and today shudders at the idea.

396
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:43,454
When the child was a child,
it played with enthusiasm...

397
00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:50,699
and now it can only muster it
when it concerns its work.

398
00:58:42,023 --> 00:58:44,617
Do you recall our first visit here?

399
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:48,298
History had not yet begun.

400
00:58:48,463 --> 00:58:52,456
We let mornings and evenings go by,
and waited.

401
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:59,062
It took a long time for the river to find
its bed and the stagnant water to flow.

402
00:58:59,223 --> 00:59:05,059
Valley of the primeval river.
One day, I still remember...

403
00:59:05,223 --> 00:59:09,660
the glacier melted
and the icebergs drifted to the north.

404
00:59:09,823 --> 00:59:14,943
A tree passed by, still green,
with an empty bird's nest.

405
00:59:15,103 --> 00:59:19,062
Only the fish had leapt
over a myriad of years.

406
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:22,613
Then came the moment
when the bees drowned.

407
00:59:22,783 --> 00:59:27,299
Some time later,
the two stags fought on the bank.

408
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:33,379
Then the flies and the antlers,
like branches, flowing down the river.

409
00:59:33,543 --> 00:59:35,818
All that ever grew again was grass...

410
00:59:35,983 --> 00:59:40,374
growing over the bodies of wild cats,
wild boar and buffaloes.

411
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:46,061
One morning, out of the savannah,
its forehead smeared with grass...

412
00:59:46,223 --> 00:59:50,341
appeared the biped,
our image, so long awaited.

413
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,733
And its first word was a shout.

414
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:59,581
Was it "ah" or "oh",
or was it merely a groan?

415
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:04,692
We were at last able to laugh,
for the first time.

416
01:00:04,863 --> 01:00:10,176
Through this man's shout and that
of his followers, we learnt to speak.

417
01:00:10,343 --> 01:00:12,493
A long story.

418
01:00:12,663 --> 01:00:14,733
Sun, lightning, thunder in the sky...

419
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:18,418
and below on earth,
the firesides, the leaps...

420
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:21,939
the round dances,
the signs, the writing.

421
01:00:23,943 --> 01:00:28,300
Then one broke through the cycle
and ran straight ahead.

422
01:00:28,463 --> 01:00:35,062
As long as he ran straight ahead,
swerving sometimes perhaps from joy...

423
01:00:35,223 --> 01:00:38,852
he seemed free,
and again we could laugh with him.

424
01:00:39,023 --> 01:00:44,541
But then, suddenly, he ran zigzag,
and stones flew.

425
01:00:47,383 --> 01:00:53,015
With his flight began
the history of wars. It is still going on.

426
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:58,337
But the story of the grass, the sun,
the leaps and the shouts...

427
01:00:58,503 --> 01:01:00,937
is still going on, too.

428
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:10,901
Do you know how one day
the road was built here...

429
01:01:11,063 --> 01:01:15,261
which the next day
saw the Napoleon retreat...

430
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:19,496
and was paved later on?

431
01:01:19,663 --> 01:01:25,659
Today it is covered with grass
and sunk in like a Roman road...

432
01:01:25,823 --> 01:01:27,939
with the tank tracks.

433
01:01:29,383 --> 01:01:34,332
But we weren't even spectators.
We've always been too few.

434
01:01:39,903 --> 01:01:46,092
You really want...
- To conquer a history for myself.

435
01:01:46,263 --> 01:01:49,380
What my timeless downward look
has taught me...

436
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:53,013
I want to transmute,
to sustain a glance...

437
01:01:53,183 --> 01:01:57,381
a short shout, a sour smell.

438
01:01:58,383 --> 01:02:03,059
I've been outside long enough.
Absent long enough.

439
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:07,580
Long enough out of the world.
Let me enter the history of the world.

440
01:02:07,743 --> 01:02:10,416
Or just hold an apple in my hand.

441
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:15,737
Look, those feathers,
there on the water, already vanished.

442
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:22,934
Look, the tyre marks on the asphalt,
and now the cigarette butt rolling.

443
01:02:23,103 --> 01:02:29,053
The primeval river has dried up,
and only today's raindrops still quiver.

444
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:32,772
Down with the world behind the world.

445
01:03:52,943 --> 01:03:56,015
Only the Roman roads
still lead somewhere...

446
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:59,937
only the oldest traces
lead anywhere.

447
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:02,492
Where is the top of the pass here?

448
01:04:02,663 --> 01:04:08,579
Even the plains, even Berlin,
has its hidden passes.

449
01:04:08,743 --> 01:04:15,342
And it's only there that my country,
the country of the tale, begins.

450
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:19,496
Why doesn't everyone see
from childhood on...

451
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:23,941
the passes, doors and crevices...

452
01:04:24,103 --> 01:04:28,096
on the ground
and above in the sky.

453
01:04:28,263 --> 01:04:35,419
If everyone saw them, there would be
history without murder or war.

454
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:39,815
This time I'm doing it.
Funny I'm so calm.

455
01:04:39,983 --> 01:04:43,976
Why red socks with black shoes?
Stupid.

456
01:04:44,143 --> 01:04:47,692
Foggy, cold.
Put on a pullover, afraid to be cold.

457
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:52,254
Very good jacket. A bargain.
Just the pocket's torn.

458
01:04:52,423 --> 01:04:54,095
She gave it to me.

459
01:04:54,263 --> 01:04:59,417
Pebbles on the roof. Why?
So it doesn't fly away? Nonsense.

460
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,860
Once I'd like to fly.

461
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:06,539
The plane circles over Berlin,
one day it'll crash.

462
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:10,901
It's cold. My hands were
always warm. A good sign.

463
01:05:11,063 --> 01:05:13,736
It crackles underfoot.
What time is it?

464
01:05:13,903 --> 01:05:19,261
The sun's setting. Logical, the west.
Now I know where the west is.

465
01:05:19,423 --> 01:05:22,574
I always took the U-Bahn to the east
to go home...

466
01:05:22,743 --> 01:05:25,132
bought 10 tickets, saved a Mark.

467
01:05:25,303 --> 01:05:28,340
The sun in my back,
on the left the star.

468
01:05:28,503 --> 01:05:32,098
That's good: Sun and a star.
Her little feet.

469
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:35,778
Hopping from one foot to the other.
She danced so sweetly.

470
01:05:35,943 --> 01:05:37,296
We were all alone.

471
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:41,058
Has she got my letter?
I don't want her to read it.

472
01:05:41,223 --> 01:05:45,375
Berlin means nothing to me...
Havel? Is that a lake?

473
01:05:45,543 --> 01:05:50,333
Over there Wedding, or what?
The East is everywhere really.

474
01:05:50,503 --> 01:05:54,496
Strange people, they're shouting.
I don't care.

475
01:05:54,663 --> 01:06:00,135
All these thoughts.
I'd really rather not think any more.

476
01:06:00,303 --> 01:06:02,259
I'm going, why?

477
01:07:28,263 --> 01:07:34,816
Leave me alone, you swine.
- Mother. Mother.

478
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:12,135
I'll never make it tonight.
No trapeze on full-moon nights.

479
01:08:12,303 --> 01:08:16,296
Not the last time, the very last time.

480
01:08:16,463 --> 01:08:19,057
I should wake up from this dream.

481
01:08:19,223 --> 01:08:23,774
The end of the circus. Fini.

482
01:08:23,943 --> 01:08:29,097
And once again I feel
as if night were falling inside of me.

483
01:08:29,263 --> 01:08:33,381
Fear... Fear of death.

484
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:37,013
Why not death?

485
01:08:37,183 --> 01:08:39,413
The essential at times...

486
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:45,499
just being beautiful, and nothing more.

487
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:51,021
To look at oneself in the mirror
is to see oneself think.

488
01:08:51,183 --> 01:08:54,175
So what do you think?

489
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:59,701
I think I still have the right to be afraid,
but not to talk about it.

490
01:08:59,863 --> 01:09:04,653
You're not yet blind,
the heart is still beating.

491
01:09:04,823 --> 01:09:07,815
And now you're crying after all.

492
01:09:07,983 --> 01:09:12,420
You'd like to cry
like a very sad little girl.

493
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:15,814
Do you know why you're crying?
For whom?

494
01:09:15,983 --> 01:09:20,101
Not for me.
I don't know for whom.

495
01:09:20,263 --> 01:09:25,053
I'd like to know. I know nothing.

496
01:09:25,223 --> 01:09:31,901
I'm a little bit afraid.
It's gone, gone away. It'll come back.

497
01:09:32,063 --> 01:09:33,894
It doesn't matter.

498
01:15:53,823 --> 01:16:00,012
Just to be able to say,
like right now, I'm happy.

499
01:16:00,183 --> 01:16:06,053
I have a story,
and I'll go on having one.

500
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:57,249
There it is again,
this feeling of well-being...

501
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:03,256
as if inside my body
a hand was softly tightening.

502
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:56,370
When the child was a child,
it was the time of these questions:

503
01:21:56,540 --> 01:22:00,818
Why am I me, and why not you?

504
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:05,531
Why am I here, and why not there?

505
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:09,978
When did time begin,
and where does space end?

506
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:16,010
Isn't life under the sun just a dream?

507
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,212
Isn't that Columbo?
- Don't think so.

508
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:38,170
Not with that moth-eaten coat.
- He wouldn't be out here.

509
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:17,330
Well?
- I'm going to enter the river.

510
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:21,493
An old human expression
that I only understand today.

511
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:23,491
Now or never, moment of the ford.

512
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:27,448
But there is no other bank,
there is only the river.

513
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:30,657
Into the ford of time,
the ford of death.

514
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:33,778
We're not yet born,
so let's descend.

515
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:37,296
To look is not to look from on high,
but at eye-level.

516
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:40,611
First, I'll take a bath.

517
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:44,819
Then I'll be shaved
by a Turkish barber...

518
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:48,529
who will also massage me
down to the fingertips.

519
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:54,730
Then I'll buy a newspaper and read it
from the headlines to the horoscope.

520
01:26:54,900 --> 01:27:00,577
On the first day, I'll only be served.
For requests, ask the neighbour.

521
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:04,528
If someone stumbles over my legs,
he'll apologise.

522
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,816
If pushed, I'll push back.

523
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:10,017
The bartender will find me
an empty table.

524
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:14,093
A car will stop,
and the mayor will give me a lift.

525
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:17,013
I'll be familiar to everyone,
suspect to no one.

526
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:20,252
I won't say a word,
will understand every language.

527
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:25,540
This will be my first day.
- But none of it will be true.

528
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:01,211
I'll take her in my arms,
and she'll take me in her arms.

529
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,459
I think he's drunk.
- Yes.

530
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,373
Let's go.

531
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,413
It's got a taste.

532
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:49,173
Now I begin to understand.

533
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:58,334
Is that red?
- Yes.

534
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,570
Did you hurt yourself?

535
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:03,129
Is today a good day?
- It's okay.

536
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,492
And the pipes?
- They're yellow.

537
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:10,618
Yellow. What about him?
- He's grey-blue.

538
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,738
Grey-blue. This one?
- Purple.

539
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,652
This one?
- Orange. Ochre.

540
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:18,493
Ochre or orange?
- Ochre.

541
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,857
Yellow, red... this one?
- It's green.

542
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:26,172
And what's that over the eye?
- That's blue.

543
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,693
Blue.

544
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,257
Is it very cold?
- It'll soon be over.

545
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:34,297
I'd love to have a coffee.

546
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:38,169
Do you have money?
- Yes... no.

547
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:45,373
I'm glad everything is fine today.

548
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:56,813
Beautiful.

549
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:25,418
Coffee.
- With milk and sugar?

550
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,013
Black.

551
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:15,533
When the child was a child, it lived
on apples and bread, that was enough.

552
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,895
And it is still that way.

553
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:27,780
When the child was a child, berries fell
only like berries into its hand.

554
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:30,693
And they still do now.

555
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:38,490
Fresh walnuts made its tongue raw,
and they still do now.

556
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:45,179
Atop each mountain
it was longing for a higher mountain.

557
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:51,336
And in each city
it was longing for a bigger city.

558
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,890
And it still does.

559
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:01,416
Reached in the treetop
for the cherries...

560
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:05,812
as excitedly as it still does today.

561
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:13,772
Was shy in front of strangers,
and it still is.

562
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:22,899
Waited for the first snow,
and still waits that way.

563
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:37,413
When the child was a child, it threw
a stick like a lance into a tree.

564
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:41,459
And it's still quivering there today.

565
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:25,170
How do I get to Akazienstrasse?
- Go up Potsdamer to Kleistpark.

566
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:30,733
Right at Grunewald past Gleditsch,
no right turn at Goltzstrasse.

567
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:33,209
Turn left, and there you are.

568
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:09,895
This entrance is for the crew.
Extras, the other way, please.

569
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,492
Extra.
- That's just what you look like.

570
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:23,332
They all want autographs.

571
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:25,733
Lousy cop.

572
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:57,328
Come on, Marion. Don't worry.
It'll be alright.

573
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:01,015
I'll send you a postcard
of the Eiffel Tower.

574
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:05,856
See you next season.
Don't forget the Alekan Circus.

575
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:10,571
Bye Archie, see you next year.
- Au revoir.

576
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:12,173
A thousand kisses.

577
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:17,368
I'll send you a parcel.
With some Camembert cheese?

578
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:20,733
I couldn't say who I am.
I don't have the slightest idea.

579
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:26,577
I am someone
with no roots, no story, no country...

580
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:29,254
and I like it that way.

581
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:35,859
I am here, I am free. I can imagine
anything. It's all possible.

582
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:41,697
I only have to raise my eyes,
and once again I become the world.

583
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:45,614
Now, in this very place...

584
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:51,776
a feeling of happiness
that I could always have.

585
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:49,893
What are you doing?
- I'm sitting.

586
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:52,449
Are you sad?
- No.

587
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:56,169
Are you sick?
- Yes.

588
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:58,854
What's the matter?
- A need.

589
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,534
Oh, that's it.

590
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:05,375
A double knot is the only way
to make it hold.

591
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:13,858
A need. A need of food perhaps.
- Or a need of drink.

592
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:20,414
She isn't gone, Cassiel. I know it.

593
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:22,855
I'll find her.

594
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:27,411
Something will happen,
something important, tonight.

595
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:33,018
She'll teach me everything.

596
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:38,611
There are other suns then the one
up in the sky, Cassiel.

597
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:43,251
In the deep of the night,
spring will begin today.

598
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:46,651
Other wings will grow
in place of the old ones.

599
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:50,574
Wings that will at last astound me.

600
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:41,012
It must finally become serious.

601
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:49,535
I've often been alone,
but I've never lived alone.

602
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:57,049
When I was with someone
I was often happy...

603
01:51:57,220 --> 01:52:00,496
but at the same time
it all seemed a coincidence.

604
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:06,337
These people were my parents,
but it could have been others.

605
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:09,776
Why was the brown-eyed one
my brother...

606
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:14,616
and not the green-eyed boy
on the opposite platform?

607
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:19,450
The taxi driver's daughter
was my friend...

608
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:26,571
but I might as well have put
my arm around a horse's neck.

609
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:31,450
I was with a man, I was in love...

610
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:34,612
and I might as well
have left him there...

611
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:40,730
and gone off with the stranger
we met in the street.

612
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:47,018
Look at me, or don't.

613
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:50,172
Give me your hand, or don't.

614
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:56,779
No, don't give me your hand,
and look away.

615
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:05,218
I think tonight is the new moon.

616
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:08,890
No night more peaceful.

617
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:15,610
No bloodshed in all the city.

618
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:18,419
I've never played with anyone
and yet...

619
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:23,700
I never opened my eyes and thought:
Now it's serious.

620
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:29,897
At last it's becoming serious.

621
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:35,579
So I've grown older.

622
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:41,336
Was I the only one
who wasn't serious?

623
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:45,811
Is it our times that are not serious?

624
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:52,538
I've never been lonely,
neither alone, nor with someone else.

625
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:55,692
But I would have liked to be lonely.

626
01:53:55,860 --> 01:54:00,695
Loneliness means: I am whole at last.

627
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:06,651
Now I can say it,
as tonight I'm lonely at last.

628
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:10,733
I must put an end to coincidence.

629
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:17,771
The new moon of decision.

630
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:22,730
I don't know if there is a destiny,
but there is a decision.

631
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:25,414
Decide.

632
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:29,414
Now we are the times.

633
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:35,655
Not only the whole town, the whole
world is taking part in our decision.

634
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:41,531
Now we are more than the two of us.
We incarnate something.

635
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:44,817
We are sitting
on the People's Square...

636
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:50,657
and the whole place is full of people
whose dream is the same as ours.

637
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:54,893
We are deciding everybody's game.

638
01:54:55,060 --> 01:55:02,250
I am ready.
Now it's your turn.

639
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:05,492
You hold the game in your hand.

640
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:09,016
Now or never.

641
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:20,258
You need me.
You will need me.

642
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:27,496
There is no greater story than ours,
that of man and woman.

643
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:31,619
It will be a story of giants.

644
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:36,649
Invisible, transposable.

645
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:40,608
A story of new ancestors.

646
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:45,657
Look, my eyes.

647
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:51,892
They are the image of necessity...

648
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:56,099
of the future of everyone in the place.

649
01:55:59,140 --> 01:56:03,975
Last night I dreamt of a stranger.

650
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,730
Of my man.

651
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:13,051
Only with him could I be lonely...

652
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:15,290
open up to him...

653
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:19,897
wholly open, wholly for him...

654
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:23,689
welcome him wholly into me...

655
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:31,653
surround him with the labyrinth
of shared happiness.

656
01:56:31,820 --> 01:56:34,937
I know...

657
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:37,568
it's you.

658
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:05,816
Something happened.

659
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:14,013
It is still going on. It binds me.

660
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:21,131
It was true at night, and it's true
in the day, even more so now.

661
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:27,330
Who was who?
I was in her and she was around me.

662
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:33,975
Who in the world can claim that he
was ever together with another being?

663
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:37,177
I am together.

664
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:44,257
No mortal child was begot,
only an immortal common image.

665
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:48,333
I learned astonishment that night.

666
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:53,574
She came to take me home,
and I found home.

667
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:59,290
It happened once.

668
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:06,018
Once, and therefore forever.

669
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:13,090
The image that we created
will be with me when I die.

670
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:17,857
I will have lived within it.

671
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:26,292
The amazement about the two of us,
amazement about man and woman...

672
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:29,213
has turned me into a human being.

673
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:39,656
I know now...

674
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:41,572
what...

675
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:48,088
no angel knows.

676
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:58,780
Name the men, women and children
who will look for me...

677
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:03,695
me, their storyteller,
their cantor, their spokesman...

678
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:11,972
because they need me
more than anything in the world.

679
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:16,574
We have embarked.
