2
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:42,095
Stop.

3
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:43,863
I'll stop if you just
explain it to me,

4
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:45,432
- because I don't...
- Would you please just drop it?

5
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:46,899
All right, all right,
fine, fine, fine, fine.

6
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,035
Consider it dropped.
It's dropped.

7
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:50,170
- It's on the ground.
- Good.

8
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:53,040
But, I mean, come on,
everybody loves birthdays.

9
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:54,907
You got decorations.

10
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,909
You got balloons.
You got parties and cake.

11
00:00:57,044 --> 00:00:58,545
Look, I don't need presents,

12
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:01,681
I don't want decorations,
and I'm-I'm not a cake guy.

13
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:03,650
Seriously, though,
you don't like cake?

14
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:05,652
Name one food better than cake.

15
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:06,919
Guinea pig.

16
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:08,788
Oh, again with the guinea pig.

17
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:10,857
I bet if I blindfolded you,

18
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,692
you wouldn't be able
to tell the difference

19
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:14,661
between a skunk
and a guinea pig.

20
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:17,464
Wrong. Snakes have
impeccable taste buds.

21
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:19,599
- I can taste air.
- Air?

22
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:21,234
Yes. Air.

23
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:24,204
Mm. Nice.

24
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:26,506
I don't know.
They're a little, uh...

25
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,175
a little cute for my taste.

26
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:30,510
That's what makes them
so delicious.

27
00:01:30,643 --> 00:01:32,412
You're not just eating food.

28
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,281
You're eating pure goodness.

29
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:35,848
It's not about the pig.

30
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:39,352
It's about what it symbolizes
on a deeper level.

31
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:42,055
So, you can...
you can taste air?

32
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,456
What else you got?

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,757
- Forget about it.
- W-W-Wait.

34
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,459
Can you also hear color?

35
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:48,461
- Can you see sound?
- All right, all right. Okay.

36
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:50,663
'Cause we should really be
capitalizing on these skills.

37
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:52,532
Okay, all right, fine.
Get it all out.

38
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:53,866
- Get it all out now.
- Okay, okay.

39
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:57,170
Look at that. 4:00 p.m.

40
00:01:57,304 --> 00:01:59,539
Now I know the exact moment
our friendship died.

41
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:03,376
- Let's bounce.
- Yep.

42
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:07,947
Tastes like, um, you're gonna
stick me with the bill... again.

43
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,849
Well, it is my birthday.

44
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:11,651
So now you play
the birthday card?

45
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:13,486
That's interesting.

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,923
Can we get a check, please,
when you get a chance?

47
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:19,959
Hello? Checkity-check-check.

48
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:21,594
You know what?

49
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:25,031
We're just gonna leave
the money right here, okay?

50
00:02:25,165 --> 00:02:26,899
You know the one good thing
about this place?

51
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:28,801
- What?
- We never have to wait for a table.

52
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:30,237
Well, isn't that every place?

53
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,938
Hey, man. How you been?
I haven't seen you in...

54
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,073
Snake attack!

55
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:35,775
Oh. Mints.

56
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:37,644
Sorry, folks.
I'm switching him to decaf.

57
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,380
All right.

58
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:42,149
Let's do this.

59
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:56,529
Guinea pig, huh?

60
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:58,531
It's the Rolls-Royce of rodents.

61
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:00,300
Yeah, but it's still a rodent.

62
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,269
You know what I mean?

63
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:04,437
Don't mind us, just robbing this place.

64
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:19,586
Whoo! Yeah!

65
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,421
- Go bad...
- Or go home.

66
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:29,929
Hey, you. Get over here.

67
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,532
Little bit closer.

68
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:34,967
Oh, I know what it is.

69
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:38,771
You're afraid because
I'm the... the Big Bad Wolf.

70
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:40,573
Well, I'm not surprised.

71
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:42,475
I am the villain in every story.

72
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:43,710
Isn't that right, Mr. Snake?

73
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:45,111
Yep.

74
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:48,215
Say hello to Mr. Snake.

75
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:50,149
Serpentine,
safe-cracking machine.

76
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:52,385
Imagine Houdini
but with no arms.

77
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,521
Kind of guy who'd tell you
the glass is half empty,

78
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:55,922
then steal it from you.

79
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:57,424
He's also my best bud.

80
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,892
And today's his birthday!

81
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:02,094
- Not relevant.
- He's a sweetheart.

82
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,896
You're a sweetheart.

83
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,098
Well, look who's here.

84
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:08,868
Took 'em long enough.

85
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,741
Watch this.

86
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,476
Three.

87
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,511
Two. One.

88
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:21,714
And over here is Ms. Tarantula,

89
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:24,183
our in-house hacker,
our pocket search engine,

90
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:25,785
our traveling tech wizard.

91
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:27,620
We call her Webs.

92
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,861
Very slick, Webs.

93
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:36,229
I also took over
the police dispatch,

94
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:37,830
blurred their satellite
imaging system,

95
00:04:37,964 --> 00:04:39,232
grounded their chopper.

96
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,000
And one more thing.

97
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,168
You didn't.

98
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:43,870
I got a special delivery for...

99
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:45,171
Ah! Ooh! Don't eat me!

100
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:47,274
Please! Don't eat me!

101
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,942
Happy birthday,
Mr. Grumpy Pants.

102
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,778
I think I hate you.

103
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:06,959
Guys, it's me.

104
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,728
I was the construction worker.

105
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,797
And this is Mr. Shark,

106
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,432
master of disguise,

107
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:15,468
apex predator
of a thousand faces.

108
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:18,237
His greatest trick:
stealing the Mona Lisa

109
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:21,207
disguised as the Mona Lisa.

110
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,409
Dig that.

111
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,843
Watch it, big tuna.

112
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:25,077
I'm trying to work here.

113
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:26,679
Keep it cool, baby.

114
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:28,481
Birthdays should be chill.

115
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:31,384
And rounding out the crew...

116
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,787
Surprise!

117
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:37,724
...is Mr. Piranha.

118
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,993
He's a loose cannon
with a short fuse,

119
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:43,029
willing to scrap
with anyone or anything.

120
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:44,831
He's brave.

121
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:47,166
He's fearless.

122
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,235
Uh, who am I kidding?
He's crazy.

123
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:52,071
Santo cielo,
that's a lot of po-po.

124
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:55,775
Uh, Piranha,
did we forget something?

125
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,577
- What?
- The present.

126
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,346
- You know.
- Oh, um...

127
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,648
Of-of course I didn't forget.

128
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:04,116
You know you fart when you lie, right?

129
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,885
What? No, I fart
when I'm nervous.

130
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:07,320
Yeah. Nervous about lying.

131
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,121
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:10,790
Piranha!

133
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:12,291
Don't breathe it in.

134
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:13,660
I breathed it in!

135
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:15,395
Yeah, they're a bit eccentric,

136
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:17,229
but when you're born us,
you don't exactly win

137
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:18,998
many popularity contests.

138
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,434
- Shark!
- Shark!

139
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:24,036
Do I wish people
didn't see us as monsters?

140
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,538
Eight legs,
eight times the cardio.

141
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:26,673
Monster!

142
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:28,475
- Sure, I do.
- What's up, papa?

143
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:29,742
But these are
the cards we've been dealt,

144
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:31,310
so we might as well play 'em.

145
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:32,712
Jackpot!

146
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:34,213
Yes!

147
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:46,025
Um...

148
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:47,727
- What the thorax?
- Are you crazy?

149
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,497
What? I just wanted
a longer car chase.

150
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,164
It's the best part.

151
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:56,403
Chief! It's...

00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,004

153
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:00,940

00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:05,612

At least make a toast.

194
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,476
- Toast! Come on!
- Come on.

195
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,978
- Okay, okay. All right. A toast.
- Whoo!

196
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:53,580
Fine.

197
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:56,783
I've made a lot of enemies
in my time... I mean, a lot...

198
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,919
but out of all the people
in the world,

199
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,554
I hate you guys the least.

200
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,222
- Aw.
- That was actually kind of beautiful.

201
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:04,757
You're a poet, man.

202
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:08,661
To Mr. Snake and his strange
dislike of birthdays.

203
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:11,163
Yay!

204
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,766
Everyone say, "Robbery."

205
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,301
Robbery.

206
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:16,736
Oh.

207
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:18,705
Look at those dimples.

208
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:20,573
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Okay.

209
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,508
- Now, dig in, fellas.
- Yes!

210
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:24,577
Piranha!

211
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,078
Don't do that.

212
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,346
That was so gross.

213
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,948
That was my lunch!

214
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,950
You snooze, you lose.

215
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,485
You like that.

216
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,287
Nice.

217
00:10:36,122 --> 00:10:38,024
Ooh, wow.

218
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:39,626
I forgot we had those Push Pops.

219
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,361
Man, my tummy is rumbling
like a kraken right now.

220
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:44,196
Yeah. Want it?

221
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,365
You know he's not
gonna give it to you.

222
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,367
No, I believe that deep down

223
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,804
Snake is a kind
and generous soul.

224
00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:53,172
Why?

225
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:55,141
Here. Take it.

226
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:56,676
Oh, yeah!

227
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:57,977
Pop me, please.

228
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,879
- Ah...
- Ha!

229
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:01,748
Sucker.

230
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:05,184
Come on, man. Now you gonna
make me get all aggressive.

231
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:07,186
Animals.

232
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:09,288
Spit it out! Spit it out!

233
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:10,757
Never!

234
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,524
Let's see what they're saying
about us today.

235
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,326
What up? It's Tiffany Fluffit,
Channel 6 Action News.

236
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,262
The Bad Guys
have struck again...

237
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:19,365
Guys, guys, stop it.
We're on TV.

238
00:11:19,498 --> 00:11:20,933
- Ooh, ooh!
- ...proving once more that they

239
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,502
are the most diabolical
criminals of our time.

240
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:26,472
Ooh, "diabolical." That's new.

241
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,140
Know what it sounds like?
A cologne.

242
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,508
Diabolical.

243
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,410
To address
this heinous crime spree

244
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:34,513
is the newly elected governor,
Diane Foxington.

245
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:35,915
- Governor?
- Okay. Yeah.

246
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:37,817
I hear you. I hear you.

247
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,520
Listen, listen. We all know
how dastardly the Bad Guys are.

248
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:44,590
- You bet we are.
- But more than anything...

249
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:47,193
I feel sorry for them.

250
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:48,961
What?

251
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:50,697
These so-called Bad Guys

252
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,465
are really just
second-rate has-beens.

253
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,501
Behind their amateurish antics

254
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,770
and, frankly,
unoriginal capers...

255
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:59,706
I mean, really, another bank?...

256
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,141
is nothing but
a deep well of anger...

257
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:03,542
I ain't angry! You're angry!

258
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,311
- ...denial...
- Not true.

259
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:06,578
...and self-loathing.

260
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:08,715
The only one I self-loathe
is you.

261
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:11,183
And those are holes
that no amount of cash

262
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:14,420
or priceless art can ever fill.

263
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:18,490
What's on the Food Network?

264
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:20,159
So, can we just forget about...

265
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,761
Who-who is she to judge us?

266
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,730
...and focus on more positive things?

267
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:25,397
And what could be more positive

268
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:27,533
than the Annual
Good Samaritan Awards,

269
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,636
where tomorrow night I will
present the Golden Dolphin

270
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,106
to this year's goodest citizen?

271
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,474
I can't believe I voted for her.

272
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:36,876
You voted for her?

273
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,545
What?
She's good on climate change.

274
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,313
Wait. What's going on?

275
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,950
You've got that twinkle
in your eye.

276
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:48,955
Guys, who's up for another job?

277
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:50,356
A big one.

278
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,593
The Golden Dolphin.

279
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:56,228
- Seriously?
- Oh.

280
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:57,864
I thought I was the crazy one.

281
00:12:57,997 --> 00:13:00,366
That job has broken
every criminal who's tried it.

282
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,035
The Bucharest Bandits,
Lucky Jim.

283
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,837
The Crimson Paw.

284
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:06,672
Actually, the Crimson Paw
was never arrested.

285
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:09,141
Yeah, but he never stole
anything again.

286
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:10,877
Snake, what better way

287
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,379
to wipe that smirk
off the governor's fuzzy face

288
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,814
than stealing the Golden Dolphin

289
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:16,816
from right under her whiskers?

290
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,551
This is the Holy Grail
of thievery.

291
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:21,754
If we pull this off,
we'll cement our legacy

292
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,156
as the greatest criminals
of all time.

293
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,792
Whoa, whoa, buddy.

294
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:28,427
I thought we weren't supposed
to make things personal.

295
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,462
Besides, we've got
a good thing going here.

296
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:34,533
Friends, freedom,
and just look at this loot.

297
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:36,635
All right, you're right.
Forget it.

298
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,938
- The Dolphin job is off.
- Good.

299
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,373
I guess the pig
will get his trophy after all.

300
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:43,675
Yeah, I guess he would...

301
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,411
What do you mean, "pig"?

302
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:47,013
Oh, yes, did I not mention that?

303
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,615
That's weird. I thought
I mentioned that it was, uh...

304
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:52,151
The Good Samaritan is...

305
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:53,452
A guinea pig?

306
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:56,522
What do you say, Snakey?

307
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:57,890
Better than cake.

308
00:13:58,024 --> 00:13:59,491
Right.

309
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,294
Okay. Fine.

310
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:03,996
But he better be delicious.

311
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,198
Are we all in this together?

312
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:09,902
So here's the plan.

313
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:12,271
Like every year,
the ceremony will be held

314
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:14,073
at the Museum of Fine Arts,

315
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:16,642
where the Golden Dolphin
will be positioned

316
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:19,245
just beyond
the backstage curtain.

317
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:20,579
Sounds easy.

318
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:22,748
Sounds easy, hermano,
but to get there,

319
00:14:22,882 --> 00:14:25,117
we'll need to bypass
three levels of security.

320
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:27,686
So, step one:
We'll need to blend in.

321
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:32,058
♪ Baby, I'm howlin' for you ♪

322
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,995
♪ Da-da da-da da,
da-da da-da da... ♪

323
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:37,763
Professor Marmalade,

324
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:40,032
this year's recipient
of the Golden Dolphin,

325
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,568
the most annoying good creature
on the planet.

326
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:45,171
Professor, in the past year,
you've stopped wars,

327
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:47,706
fed the hungry
and saved countless pandas.

328
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,441
Some have described
your goodness

329
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:51,510
as second only to Mother Teresa.

330
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:54,080
Oh, Tiffany,
it's not a competition.

331
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:56,648
And if it were, it would
really be more of a tie.

332
00:14:56,782 --> 00:14:59,852
But we can all agree that
there is a flower of goodness

333
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:02,922
inside all of us,
just waiting to blossom.

334
00:15:03,055 --> 00:15:05,858
Once inside,
there are two armored doors.

335
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,194
The first can only be opened by

336
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:09,962
a special key card
that is carried

337
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:11,864
by our dear friend,
the chief of police.

338
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,866
The second is outfitted
with a retinal scanner

339
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,668
and guarded by
an elite special ops unit

340
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:19,305
trained to strike first
and ask questions later.

341
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:23,275
Governor Foxington
is the only one

342
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:25,244
who has clearance
to open the second door.

343
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:27,646
So, step two:
She and I will need to get

344
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,448
up close and personal.

345
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:31,250
Enjoy your evening,
Mr. Ambassador.

346
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:32,418
Thank you, ma'am.

347
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:33,953
Interesting piece.

348
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:37,489
Trashy, pointless
and pretentious.

349
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:39,992
Hmm. They say that art reveals

350
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:41,793
more about the viewer
than the artist.

351
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:43,362
Mister...

352
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:45,531
Poodleton. Oliver Poodleton.

353
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:46,632
Uh... okay.

354
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:48,667
It's about time someone stood up

355
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,037
to those diabolical Bad Guys.

356
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,173
Though, I've got to say,
no one's succeeded yet.

357
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:56,909
Eh. I don't think
it'll be that hard.

358
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:59,045
I have a feeling it'll be
harder than you think.

359
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,180
I'd say they're
one epic job away

360
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:03,015
from cementing their legacy.

361
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,486
Mr. Poodleton,
you're-you're funny.

362
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:09,055
I am?

363
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,457
The only legacy they're
cementing is life in prison.

364
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,292
Did you see their last job?

365
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:14,893
Ugh. Unsecured exits,

366
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:17,296
crude disguises,
compulsive showboating.

367
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:18,797
I mean, it was a mess.

368
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:21,600
All the classic signs
of a crew in decline.

369
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,670
Next, they're gonna
make it personal.

370
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:27,306
That's when you know
they're toast.

371
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:30,576
Uh, well, that's your opinion.

372
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:33,245
It is, and I'm the governor.

373
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:38,350
As for the sculpture,
I think it's about perspective.

374
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,186
If you look closely enough,

375
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,856
even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful.

376
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:47,026
How about that?

377
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,497
I guess some things
aren't always as they appear.

378
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,831
That reminds me.

379
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:54,633
May I? I can't miss a photo op

380
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:56,268
with the governor
and a pile of garbage.

381
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:59,838
Oh, Mr. Poodleton,
you're too hard on yourself.

382
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:01,507
Hey...

383
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:05,611
Okay, friends.

384
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:07,546
It's showtime.

385
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:11,350
Once we're in,
it's on to step three:

386
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:14,053
We split up
and we take our positions.

387
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:17,756
Officers, if the Bad Guys
crash this event,

388
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:19,858
I am definitely
going to lose my job,

389
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:23,195
and I will not hesitate
to take you down with me.

390
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,064
- Now, move out.
- Yes, ma'am!

391
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:26,732
Hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut,

392
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:28,567
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut...

393
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:45,451
Mic's on.
Everyone on comms, do you copy?

394
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:46,685
- Copy.
- Copy. - Copy.

395
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:48,387
Copy.

396
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,774
A drink for the pretty lady?

397
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:11,543
No, thank you. My life is
too complicated right now.

398
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:13,379
Uh, uh...

399
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:42,508
Boys, it's Dolphin season.

400
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:48,114
Copy that. I'm on the move.

401
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,083
Unit two, is the backstage
area still secure?

402
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,451
Unit two. All clear.

403
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,886
This is where
all the training pays off.

404
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,622
Oh, pardon me.

405
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:58,590
- Terribly sorry.
- Not a problem, sir.

406
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:00,626
Keep your eyes open, boys.

407
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:04,730
They could be anywhere,
just waiting to humiliate us.

408
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:08,967
Wolf is in position.

409
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:11,437
Piranha, you all
penguin-suited and booted?

410
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,006
Affirmative. I'm a clean, mean,
Dolphin-stealing machine.

411
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:17,042
What's going on, guys?

412
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,421
- Here, let me help you.
- Ooh.

413
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:03,789
Are you okay, ma'am?

414
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:06,958
Oh, my gracious, yes.

415
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:10,629
I may be dizzy, but I'm alive,
thanks to you.

416
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:12,331
- What are you...
- Oh.

417
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:13,699
Mm.

418
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:18,003
Thank you, dear.

419
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:21,840
You're such a good boy.

420
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:42,261
All good, brother?

421
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:45,664
Yeah, all... a-all good.
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:20:45,797 --> 00:20:47,233
Um...

423
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,835
Webs, what do you say about
moving on to step four?

424
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:52,604
Copy that. Shark, you're up.

425
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:54,906
- Do your thing.
- Do I get to improvise?

426
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,942
Yes, fine. Improvise.

427
00:20:57,075 --> 00:20:58,710
But please be subtle.

428
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:00,579
Mm-hmm.

429
00:21:02,113 --> 00:21:04,350
I'm having a baby!

430
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:05,817
Is there a doctor?

431
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,886
Or perhaps
several security guards

432
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:09,821
that could leave their post
and help me?

433
00:21:29,941 --> 00:21:31,543
"Fish surprise"?

434
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,413
Surprise!

435
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:43,255
Hey, Webs,
can you enhance this...

436
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,957
Done. Eight steps
ahead of you, Wolfie.

437
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:54,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

438
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:57,669
your emcee for
the Good Samaritan Awards...

439
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:01,106
All right, Shark, we're in.

440
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:03,309
Oops,
I forgot, I'm not pregnant.

441
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:05,477
...president of the committee,

442
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:07,913
Governor Diane Foxington.

443
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:10,649
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

444
00:22:10,782 --> 00:22:12,951
Thank you.

445
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:15,987
Last year,
we faced our biggest test

446
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:19,591
when a meteorite crashed
into our dear city.

447
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:22,694
That meteorite didn't just make
a hole in our city.

448
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:24,696
It made a hole in our hearts.

449
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,632
Aw.

450
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:29,034
But even in tragedy,
Professor Marmalade,

451
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:30,869
he did what he does so well.

452
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:33,372
He made us look
at things differently.

453
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:35,206
And thanks to you, Marmalade,

454
00:22:35,341 --> 00:22:38,944
the Love Crater Meteorite
will forever serve as a symbol

455
00:22:39,077 --> 00:22:42,714
of how there is good
even in the worst places.

456
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,717
Whoo!

457
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:57,195
Hurry up.

458
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:00,999
...and successfully reversed
climate change

459
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:03,402
for the well-being of all of us.

460
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:07,138
This is going
surprisingly smoothly.

461
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:17,115
What the molt is that?

462
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,650
The Wolf Piranha
Snake Shark Tarantula

463
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,652
- Protection System.
- The WPSST?

464
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:23,154
- This was not supposed to happen.
- What?

465
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:25,190
Guys, calm down. I'm on it.

466
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:28,694
Initiating WPSST override
protocol.

467
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:29,995
Get it, queen!

468
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,765
- Did it work?
- Just give me five minutes.

469
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,235
And now, please join me
in welcoming to the stage...

470
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,004
We don't have five minutes.

471
00:23:39,137 --> 00:23:41,239
...Professor Marmalade.

472
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:42,307
Aw.

473
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:44,676
We love you,
Professor Marmalade!

474
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,011
The pig is on the move.

475
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:48,279
I repeat, the pig
is on the move.

476
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:50,782
Webs, Webs, the curtain's
going up any minute.

477
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:51,983
It's not letting me in.

478
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:53,284
Check your system preferences.

479
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:54,720
You probably need
to download a driver.

480
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:55,821
Try rebooting.

481
00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:57,322
Oh, my gosh, you fixed it.

482
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:58,557
- SNAKE and WOLF: Really?
- No!

483
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,459
Hey, Larry.

484
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:01,560
Come on, open up.

485
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:03,361
What did we say
about locking doors?

486
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,831
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Shark, I got a situation here.

487
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:07,165
Copy that. I'm on my way.

488
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,436
Hurry up, guys.

489
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:13,071
Time to turn this baby
on beast mode.

490
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,509
Eat it, WPSST!

491
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,515
Please, not now.

492
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:25,316
- Wolf.
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no, Piranha!

493
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:28,186
This award is for...

494
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,989
As I was saying...

495
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:34,493
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

496
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:41,366
- Piranha! Are you kidding me?
- Sorry!

497
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,602
And that's why
my Gala for Goodness

498
00:24:43,735 --> 00:24:46,505
will raise all the money needed
for those less fortunate.

499
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:47,873
Come on!

500
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:52,210
I'm starting
to get mad here, Larry.

501
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:54,746
Webs! Webs!

502
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,517
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

503
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:02,621
Whoa!

504
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:14,032
Excuse me.

505
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:15,667
Is this the ladies' room?

506
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:17,836
Oh, uh, y-you need
to take a right

507
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:19,838
at the end of the hall, ma'am.

508
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,412
Yes. Whoop-bam!

509
00:25:28,714 --> 00:25:29,781
Oh, come on!

510
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:34,185
And now it is my honor
to award Professor Marmalade

511
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,389
with the Golden Dolphin!

512
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:41,392
- No.
- No.

513
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:42,661
Yes!

514
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:45,030
I mean, yes!

515
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:46,832
What?

516
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,172
Everyone, everyone, uh,
please don't panic.

517
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:55,607
Just stay calm.

518
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:58,043
I'm-I'm sure there's
an explanation for this.

519
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:02,914
I repeat, uh,
please do not panic.

520
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:06,184
Nice work, everybody.

521
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:09,320
Now, let's make like a wolf
and get the pack out of here.

522
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:11,322
Ah, wordplay.

523
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:12,624
I don't get it.

524
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:14,626
Diane, Diane, if I may...

525
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,828
You have to understand,

526
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:20,098
I didn't bring hope back
to the city for an award.

527
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:24,135
I did these good things because
of how they made me feel.

528
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:25,771
That tingly feeling I get.

529
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:27,205
That shiver up my spine.

530
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:31,109
The wag in my tiny tail.

531
00:26:31,242 --> 00:26:33,078
Because, you see,

532
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:37,448
being good just feels so good.

533
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:41,587
And when you're good,
you're loved.

534
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:44,690
Wolf?

535
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:46,224
- Wolf?
- What are you doing?

536
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:48,326
SNAKE, SHARK and PIRANHA:
Go!

537
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:50,261
It's the Bad Guys!

538
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:51,563
Arrest them!

539
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:52,463
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

540
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:53,832
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

541
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:55,801
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut.

542
00:26:57,168 --> 00:26:58,469
They stole the Golden Dolphin!

543
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:01,439
Come on, you can't prove that.

544
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:05,243
My baby!

545
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:06,912
On your knees, Bad Guys.

546
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:08,146
With your hands up.

547
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,315
Never! We're out of here.

548
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:15,286
So long, suckers.

549
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:24,129
Well, this just got
a little weird.

550
00:27:26,264 --> 00:27:27,933
The Bad Guys go bust.

551
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:31,069
The nefarious fivesome
has finally been captured.

552
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:33,839
And I, Tiffany Fluffit,
am first on the scene.

553
00:27:33,972 --> 00:27:36,642
Wow. You know, I-I just
realized that I have devoted

554
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:39,244
my entire adult life
to putting you in jail.

555
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:40,979
You are my purpose.

556
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:42,881
Without you, who am I?

557
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:44,315
Ah, I'm just kidding.

558
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:46,117
This is the best moment
of my life!

559
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:50,088
It's the end of the Bad Guys.

560
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:51,522
No!

561
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:53,558
Get your hands off of me!

562
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:56,061
Ooh, you're begging
for a biting right now.

563
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:57,595
Wolf!

564
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:02,634
Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

565
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:04,502
Ooh, Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

566
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:06,738
- Madam Governor!
- One at a time. One at a time.

567
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:10,541
- Hey. Hey!
- Excuse me.

568
00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:12,510
Sorry to interrupt.

569
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:15,346
I just wanted to congratulate
the governor here.

570
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,949
I got to say,
you really got us pegged.

571
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:22,320
We're just a deep well
of anger and self-loathing.

572
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:24,289
- Denial.
- Sure. That, too.

573
00:28:24,422 --> 00:28:25,490
- Narcissism.
- Yeah. Yeah.

574
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:26,792
Emotional emptiness.

575
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:28,326
- So we're on the same page.
- Hmm.

576
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:30,428
What is he doing?

577
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:33,598
Sadly, we were never
given a chance

578
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:37,202
to be anything more
than second-rate criminals.

579
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:39,805
If only there was someone
who could help

580
00:28:39,938 --> 00:28:43,474
the flower of goodness
inside us blossom.

581
00:28:43,608 --> 00:28:45,877
Some icon of love
and forgiveness,

582
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:49,314
like, uh, I don't know,
Mother Teresa.

583
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:52,383
Best thing is to just
throw us in jail

584
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:55,020
for the rest
of our hopeless lives.

585
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:56,822
Yeah, that's the plan.

586
00:28:56,955 --> 00:28:58,589
Wait, wait, wait, no, no.

587
00:28:58,724 --> 00:29:00,291
- Get in there.
- Ow!

588
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:02,360
Wait.

589
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:04,395
Uh, beg... beg pardon?

590
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:06,431
Mr. Wolf may be a savage beast.

591
00:29:06,564 --> 00:29:08,099
Basically walking garbage.

592
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,567
Sorry, I'm making a point.

593
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:11,302
Do what you need to do, pal.

594
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:13,471
But how can we say
they're hopeless

595
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:15,807
if they've never
been given a chance?

596
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:18,910
What if... what if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

597
00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:21,546
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness,

598
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,383
the "hashtag charity event
of the year," is coming up.

599
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,252
If I can prove
to everyone at that gala

600
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:28,787
that the Bad Guys have changed,

601
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,422
will you set them free
and give them a clean start?

602
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:35,060
- What? Professor Marmalade!
- Ow!

603
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:37,428
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't you see what he's doing?

604
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:39,064
He's playing you.

605
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:40,265
But it was my idea.

606
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:41,532
It was his idea.

607
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,534
But only because
you made him have it.

608
00:29:43,668 --> 00:29:45,871
Madam Governor,
you can't just let them go.

609
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:48,273
Professor, I'm not about to put
the safety of the city

610
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:50,341
on the line for an experiment.

611
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:51,977
Excuse me, Madam Governor.

612
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,713
I seem to remember that
a wise person once said,

613
00:29:55,847 --> 00:30:00,051
"Even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful."

614
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:04,990
Okay. I'm game.

615
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:07,658
But only because it's you,
Professor.

616
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:08,894
No!

617
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:11,096
We'll hold on to the Dolphin
until the gala.

618
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:14,499
Just to remove
any unnecessary temptation.

619
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:16,667
Of course. Good thinking.

620
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:18,736
That's why you're governor.

621
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,139
Now that everyone's happy...

622
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:22,607
Not happy.

623
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,243
...I, Rupert Marmalade
the Fourth,

624
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:27,312
will turn the Bad Guys into...

625
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:29,180
the Good Guys!

626
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:36,054
I think these belong to you.

627
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:37,588
Hey.

628
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:41,326
Not everyone gets
a second chance.

629
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:45,530
Make the most of it,
Mr. Poodleton.

630
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:56,241
Wolf?

631
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:57,542
What are you doing?

632
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,110
- What?
- Yeah.

633
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:01,179
Oh, that.

634
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:04,015
I-I-I'm sorry.
I thought it was, uh, obvious.

635
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:06,184
We're gonna go good.

636
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:09,087
Uh, you totally lost me.

637
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,322
I told him to stop drinking
out of the toilet.

638
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:13,391
Hey, did you get hit
on the head?

639
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:14,759
What? No, I didn't
get hit on the head.

640
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:16,461
My cousin got hit on
the head with an anchor,

641
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:18,229
and after that,
he only swam in a circle.

642
00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:20,431
No, no, g-guys, guys,
you're not following me.

643
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:23,468
We're gonna pretend to go good.

644
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:25,136
Just a few days with Marmalade.

645
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,274
And then we roll into the gala
as Good Guys

646
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:32,610
and roll out scot-free with...

647
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:35,546
The Golden Dolphin.

648
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,814
You got it.

649
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:39,084
Since when do we not
finish a job?

650
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:42,487
The Bad Guys become
the Good Guys

651
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,756
so we can stay the Bad Guys.

652
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:48,326
You know what I'm saying?

653
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,861
Bad Guys acting good?

654
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,696
It's the ultimate Bad Guy thing.

655
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:53,131
It's fantastic.

656
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:54,565
Wolf, you're a genius.

657
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:58,603
It's gonna be, like,
the most relaxing con ever,

658
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:00,205
like a vacation.

659
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:02,573
Oh, oh. A con-cation.

660
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:08,146
Ooh! My parents met
on a con-cation.

661
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:23,394
Oh, goody.

662
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:24,963
Wow.

663
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:26,564
Big and fancy.

664
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,866
Rodent's got taste. Okay.

665
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,769
Huh. Almost makes me
want to be cute.

666
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:35,273
They say experience
is the best teacher.

667
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:37,108
And they are wrong.

668
00:32:37,242 --> 00:32:38,476
I am.

669
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:40,811
Good morning,
students of goodness.

670
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:46,084
And welcome to the first day
of the rest of your best life.

671
00:32:46,217 --> 00:32:47,418
A giant butt.

672
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:48,753
Huh?

673
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,388
Uh, it's-it's not a butt.

674
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:53,024
It's a lamp in the shape of

675
00:32:53,158 --> 00:32:55,293
the Love Crater Meteorite,
my greatest...

676
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:57,362
- I wonder whose butt it is.
- Uh...

677
00:32:58,163 --> 00:33:00,165
Once again, it's not a butt.
Thank you.

678
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:02,167
It's a heart.
Now, as I was saying...

679
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,569
- Then why does it have cheeks?
- Shut it!

680
00:33:04,702 --> 00:33:06,437
What? I've never seen
a heart with cheeks.

681
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:08,039
It's not a...

682
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:10,541
- Booty!
- It's not a butt! Not a butt!

683
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:13,111
Does he know what a butt is?

684
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:14,980
As I was saying,

685
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:17,949
on the outside,
the five of you are villains,

686
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,051
predators,
remorseless sociopaths.

687
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:22,253
Oh, stop.
You're making me blush.

688
00:33:22,387 --> 00:33:24,122
But inside, there's a flower...

689
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:27,092
the flower of goodness...
and when it blooms

690
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:29,627
and you feel that tingle
of positivity

691
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,262
radiating through your body,

692
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:34,465
you're going to want to feel it
all the time.

693
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,267
So we're going for a tingle?

694
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:37,602
Not any tingle.

695
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:39,837
The tingle of goodness,
which you'll feel

696
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:43,208
in my state-of-the-art
Sharing Laboratory.

697
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:47,245
Okay, Mr. Snake, I'm going
to give you a Push Pop.

698
00:33:47,378 --> 00:33:49,814
Great! Push Pop just for me!

699
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,550
- No, to share.
- Why?

700
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:54,552
Well, on a fundamental level,

701
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,654
it's about putting
someone else's needs

702
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,124
ahead of your own.

703
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:00,992
Oh, no. No way.

704
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,860
Snake.

705
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:05,596
All right, all right.

706
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,598
This is going to taste
extra sweet,

707
00:34:07,732 --> 00:34:10,235
'cause I know how bad
you want it.

708
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:14,639
Pop me, please. Ah...

709
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:20,378
Nope. Sucker.

710
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:21,612
That's it!

711
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:23,514
I'll teach you to share!

712
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,951
Mm, I like sharing.
It's yummy. Mm.

713
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:28,786
Totally worth it.

714
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,022
Well, that's terrifying.

715
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,091
Let's try something simpler.

716
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:35,626
A good person always
pays attention

717
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,095
to the needs of others.

718
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:39,764
Now, here's a kindly,
frail grandma.

719
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:45,236
Mr. Piranha, help grandma
across the street.

720
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,139
Sure, sure, sure.
I do this all the time.

721
00:34:48,939 --> 00:34:51,742
Here you go, ma'am.

722
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:53,711
Oh, he is totally gonna blow it.

723
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:55,246
What was that? What did you say

724
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,847
You think I can't do this?

725
00:34:56,981 --> 00:34:59,284
No, no, no, Piranha!

726
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:04,222
Maybe simpler?

727
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:09,194
Hey, look.
It's a cat stuck in a tree.

728
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:11,329
It doesn't get much simpler
than that.

729
00:35:11,462 --> 00:35:13,364
Now, what in this scenario

730
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:15,400
would give you that good tingle?

731
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:17,001
Eating it?

732
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,270
This is why I always carry
two pieces of bread with me.

733
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:20,438
No.

734
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:23,308
I want you to s...

735
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,575
- Smack it.
- Skin it?

736
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:26,344
- Stab it.
- Sauté it. - Sing to it?

737
00:35:26,477 --> 00:35:28,246
Save it. I want you to sa...

738
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,515
That's obv... It's so obvi...
I want you to save it.

739
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:31,916
Oh!

740
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,818
- Right, right.
- Right, right, right. Sure.

741
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:37,388
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

742
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:40,458
Whoa, that cat is
obviously defective.

743
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:41,759
What is wrong with you?

744
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,428
You're gonna give it
a heart attack.

745
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,230
I'll handle this.

746
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:48,333
What's up, papa!

747
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:52,270
Get him off my face!
He's on my face!

748
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:54,572
No, no, no, no, no, listen!
Wh-What are you doing?

749
00:35:59,377 --> 00:36:02,913
Okay. What, may I ask,
are you good at?

750
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:04,549
Stealing stuff.

751
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:05,750
Oh, yeah, we're great at that.

752
00:36:05,883 --> 00:36:06,851
- Robbery.
- Larceny.

753
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:08,052
- Wire fraud.
- Extortion.

754
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:09,554
- Tax evasion.
- Heists.

755
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:11,422
- Mail fraud.
- Wait. Heists, you say?

756
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:13,891
Well, that's... yeah,
that's kind of our specialty.

757
00:36:14,024 --> 00:36:16,494
I might just have an idea.

758
00:36:16,627 --> 00:36:19,864
Free the pigs! Free the pigs!

759
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:22,700
That is an animal testing lab.

760
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:25,270
Within, 200,000 helpless
guinea pigs,

761
00:36:25,403 --> 00:36:29,407
all being poked and prodded
by sadistic scientists.

762
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,808
Guinea pigs, you say?

763
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,410
Snake.

764
00:36:32,543 --> 00:36:33,811
I want you to rescue them.

765
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:35,946
But this is a heist for good,

766
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,450
so I brought something
more friendly for you to wear.

767
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:41,752
Bye.

768
00:36:41,886 --> 00:36:43,654
Well, there goes
our street cred.

769
00:36:43,788 --> 00:36:45,456
At least it's comfy.

770
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:49,927
All right, we need
to distract that scientist.

771
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,029
- Shark, you're up.
- Copy that.

772
00:36:52,163 --> 00:36:54,265
Okay. We're gonna need
a rope and a hook.

773
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,966
- I got this one.
- What?

774
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,235
You're volunteering?

775
00:36:57,368 --> 00:36:58,936
You've never volunteered
for anything.

776
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:00,738
Sure, I did. Right now.

777
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:03,007
- Uh...
- Throw me up there. Giddyap!

778
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,509
- Really?
- Yep.

779
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:06,177
I'm 99% sure you can make it.

780
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,078
- Okay.
- Let's do it!

781
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:10,481
Hey there, son.

782
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:11,682
Dad?

783
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:13,384
I know you've got
an important job,

784
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:15,920
but I hope you still have time
for a catch with your old man.

785
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:19,190
- Hey, kiddo. - Huh?
- 96% sure.

786
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:20,991
You'll always be my special boy.

787
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,527
Aw.

788
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,094
Maybe 90%.

789
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:26,564
I've been waiting
my entire life for this moment.

790
00:37:26,697 --> 00:37:28,866
- I don't know.
- Okay. Now, go long.

791
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,568
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

792
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:33,704
Thank you, Daddy!

793
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:36,241
50... What day is it?

794
00:37:36,374 --> 00:37:37,508
Who am I?

795
00:37:37,642 --> 00:37:39,244
Right.
The guinea pigs are locked

796
00:37:39,377 --> 00:37:41,246
behind a three-foot-thick
steel door.

797
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,448
The only way in
is through the vents.

798
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:45,149
I got it.

799
00:37:45,283 --> 00:37:47,151
Upsy-daisy. ♪ Over the filters
and through the vents ♪

800
00:37:47,285 --> 00:37:48,986
I have never seen him
so chipper.

801
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,821
Has he been meditating?

802
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:53,424
♪ To Guinea Pig Land we... ♪

803
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:00,898
Oh.

804
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:03,401
Snake attack.

805
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,070
Oh. Hey, look,
it's Professor Marmalade.

806
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:08,506
Yes, that's right. It's me.

807
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,974
Help has arrived.

808
00:38:10,107 --> 00:38:12,310
Just keep your eyes glued
to that door.

809
00:38:12,443 --> 00:38:15,413
Snake. Come on, Snake. Open up.

810
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:16,747
Relax.

811
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:19,016
These doors are complicated.

812
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:20,918
Are you kidding me?

813
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,320
What do you think you're doing?

814
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:24,154
We're supposed to save them,
not eat them.

815
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:26,791
Well, I'd say they've gone
to a better place.

816
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:29,260
All right, that's it.

817
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:30,895
- Spit them out.
- Hey.

818
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:32,597
Hey!

819
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,265
We gonna save you
whether you like it or not.

820
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,933
We're saving you,
you stupid hair balls.

821
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:38,303
Not that door. The other door.

822
00:38:39,169 --> 00:38:40,271
Hey, hey.

823
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:41,272
Whoa!

824
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:42,540
Any second.

825
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:54,752
It-it's not what it looks like.

826
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:04,595
Trespassing, burglary, mayhem,

827
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:06,864
assault with a deadly reptile?

828
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:08,499
As if those poor rodents

829
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:10,501
haven't been through
enough already.

830
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:11,769
No, Diane, please.

831
00:39:11,902 --> 00:39:13,471
Okay.

832
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:16,441
I'm sorry, Professor,
but I'm calling the chief.

833
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:17,408
Please. Come on.

834
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:18,809
This experiment is over.

835
00:39:18,943 --> 00:39:19,844
Experiments take time.

836
00:39:19,977 --> 00:39:21,178
You couldn't help yourself?

837
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:22,613
So I had a moment of weakness.
Sue me.

838
00:39:22,747 --> 00:39:24,449
That's gonna be difficult to do
from prison.

839
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:26,717
Guys, what do we do now?

840
00:39:28,419 --> 00:39:32,022
Hmm. Time to launch
a charm offensive.

841
00:39:32,156 --> 00:39:35,660
Oh, yeah. The full Clooney.

842
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:37,595
Madam Governor.

843
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,696
Diane.

844
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:40,331
Do not Clooney me, Wolf.

845
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:42,667
Oh, I see what's going on.
You think I'm still a Bad Guy,

846
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,035
trying to bamboozle
my way to freedom.

847
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:46,671
But we've changed.

848
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:49,139
That flower of goodness is
blossoming all over the place.

849
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:51,976
Don't you ever
get tired of lying?

850
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:53,644
No.

851
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:55,012
I mean... Fudge.

852
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,647
That was... that was
a trick question, right?

853
00:39:56,781 --> 00:39:59,684
I gave you an opportunity...

854
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,218
a chance to show the world

855
00:40:01,352 --> 00:40:03,521
that you're more than just
a scary stereotype...

856
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,456
but you're too proud

857
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,058
or too gutless
to take advantage of it.

858
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,960
Gutless? I'm gutless?

859
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:11,195
Oh.

860
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:12,730
I'm sorry, have we met?

861
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:14,198
I'm the villain of every story.

862
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:15,566
Guilty until proven innocent.

863
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,803
Even if by some miracle
we did change,

864
00:40:18,936 --> 00:40:20,638
who's gonna believe us, huh?

865
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:22,573
Of course you wouldn't know
anything about that,

866
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:26,577
with your Little Miss Perfect
power suits.

867
00:40:27,578 --> 00:40:28,779
Is that so?

868
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:30,381
Wait a second.

869
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:32,182
What did... How did you...

870
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:36,554
A wolf and a fox
are not so different.

871
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:39,690
Maybe they will believe you,
maybe they won't,

872
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:41,191
but it doesn't matter.

873
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:43,628
Don't do it for them.
Do it for you.

874
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:46,263
This is a chance
to write your own story.

875
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:49,366
To find a better life for you
and your friends.

876
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,936
Come on,
what have you got to lose?

877
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:54,038
I don't know. My dignity?

878
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:58,609
Yeah, well,
that ship has already sailed.

879
00:41:04,582 --> 00:41:07,384
Believe it or not,
I'm rooting for you, Wolf.

880
00:41:08,185 --> 00:41:10,354
So you're not gonna
call the chief?

881
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:14,058
I'll see you at the gala.

882
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:51,195
I think we got off
to a bad start.

883
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:53,330
The name's Wolf.

884
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,702
Yep.

885
00:41:57,835 --> 00:41:59,169
I get that a lot.

886
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:01,539
First impressions and all.

887
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:06,811
No, no, no, no.

888
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:14,952
Uh, it's okay. It's okay.

889
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:17,021
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I know you're scared.

890
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:19,256
I would be, too, if I were you.

891
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,759
Just give me a chance.

892
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,130
Truth is we actually have
a lot in common.

893
00:42:26,263 --> 00:42:28,132
Don't tell anyone,

894
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:31,001
but I love a little scratch

895
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:33,303
on the spot behind my ears.

896
00:42:33,437 --> 00:42:35,139
You know, right there.

897
00:42:35,272 --> 00:42:37,341
The best.

898
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:44,715
Come on, kitty.

899
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,935
Yeah. Who's a good kitty?

900
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:06,971
- Who's a good kitty?
- Uh, Wolf?

901
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:09,907
Um, you saved him?

902
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,308
Yes!

903
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:14,378
Yes. It's working.

904
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:15,746
You-you filmed that?

905
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,315
Yes, and they're starting
to like you.

906
00:43:18,448 --> 00:43:19,483
Yeah!

907
00:43:19,617 --> 00:43:21,351
All right!

908
00:43:21,485 --> 00:43:22,620
This might just be enough

909
00:43:22,753 --> 00:43:24,088
to win over the guests
at the gala.

910
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:26,190
- Now we're talking!
- Yes! - All right!

911
00:43:26,323 --> 00:43:28,926
Yeah, we did it! All right!

912
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:30,695
Uh, Wolf?

913
00:43:30,828 --> 00:43:33,230
I must say,
you've really turned a corner.

914
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:35,232
- You're really getting it.
- Really?

915
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:36,934
Oh, uh, thanks.

916
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:38,102
Now, I mean it.

917
00:43:38,235 --> 00:43:40,170
And I can see it
from tip to tail.

918
00:43:40,938 --> 00:43:44,474
It's just a shame that you
have to carry all that baggage.

919
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:47,845
What are you talk...
You mean the guys?

920
00:43:47,978 --> 00:43:49,246
What do you mean?

921
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,748
You have great potential, Wolf,

922
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:52,349
but at some point,
you're going to have to choose

923
00:43:52,482 --> 00:43:55,620
between your friends
or the good life.

924
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:06,664
Hey. You still awake?

925
00:44:08,465 --> 00:44:10,034
You-you brought the cat in?

926
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,869
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

927
00:44:12,002 --> 00:44:13,938
I'm just...
I'm just saving it up for later.

928
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:15,472
Why? What's up?

929
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:17,942
I was just getting
a little worried,

930
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:19,744
since you've kind of become a...

931
00:44:19,877 --> 00:44:21,846
Become a what?

932
00:44:21,979 --> 00:44:24,014
You know, teacher's pet.

933
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:26,350
Getting all cozy with Marmalade.

934
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:28,452
Your tail wagging
and everything.

935
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,554
Well, yeah, because
it has to be believable.

936
00:44:30,688 --> 00:44:33,423
Uh-huh. Yeah, I guess so.

937
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:36,160
As long as it's all
part of the plan.

938
00:44:37,027 --> 00:44:39,596
It is all part of the plan,
isn't it?

939
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,867
Snake, buddy,
who made the plan to begin with?

940
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,401
You did.

941
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:48,005
So I'm the one who sticks
to the plan the most, right?

942
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,208
Yeah, ri... Uh, yeah, ok...

943
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:53,577
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

944
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:56,113
But if the plan
were ever to change,

945
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:58,949
you'd-you'd tell me, right?

946
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,587
You have my word.

947
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:05,756
Go bad...

948
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:08,458
Or go home.

949
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,468
- Hey, Snake.
- Yeah?

950
00:45:18,602 --> 00:45:20,805
You ever wonder
what it'd be like?

951
00:45:20,938 --> 00:45:23,607
The world loving us
instead of being scared of us?

952
00:45:23,741 --> 00:45:25,642
You ever...
you ever think about that?

953
00:45:25,776 --> 00:45:26,911
Loving us?

954
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:28,445
Yeah, right.

955
00:45:28,578 --> 00:45:30,514
I don't waste time
thinking about stuff

956
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,182
that's never gonna happen.

957
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:36,721
I can't wait for things
to get back to normal.

958
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:46,363
Yeah. Back to normal,
back to normal.

959
00:45:54,872 --> 00:45:57,374
What up?
We are just moments away

960
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,409
from Professor Marmalade's
Gala for Goodness,

961
00:45:59,543 --> 00:46:01,578
where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite

962
00:46:01,712 --> 00:46:04,715
will be on display
for the first time ever.

963
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,484
But what everyone
is really buzzing about

964
00:46:07,617 --> 00:46:10,955
is the Bad Guys, whose
heart-melting rescue video

965
00:46:11,088 --> 00:46:14,925
has made them an overnight
viral sensation.

966
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,395
All right, guys,
this is the big one.

967
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:20,130
The Golden Dolphin

968
00:46:20,264 --> 00:46:21,732
is inside a titanium case

969
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:23,700
controlled by a randomly
generated five-digit code,

970
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,369
a code kept safe and secure

971
00:46:25,502 --> 00:46:28,405
inside a briefcase handcuffed
to the chief of police.

972
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:30,407
She's not messing around.

973
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,109
The code is only
accessible with

974
00:46:32,242 --> 00:46:33,844
- her authorized fingerprints.
- Leave that to me.

975
00:46:33,978 --> 00:46:35,913
While Snake gets the code,

976
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:37,414
Shark will secure
the fake Dolphin.

977
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:39,149
I like the sound of that.

978
00:46:39,283 --> 00:46:41,018
Meanwhile, the rest of us
plant circuit jammers.

979
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,120
Allowing me
to hack into the power grid.

980
00:46:43,253 --> 00:46:44,822
At the end of the night,
we toast the professor,

981
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:46,857
"Blah-blah-blah, yada yada,"

982
00:46:46,991 --> 00:46:49,393
and when I say "Marmalade,"
lights go out,

983
00:46:49,526 --> 00:46:52,329
and we'll have exactly
four seconds to make our move.

984
00:46:52,462 --> 00:46:54,364
The old switcheroo.

985
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:57,167
Chief hands Marmalade
the fake Dolphin,

986
00:46:57,301 --> 00:47:00,270
we get our pardon, applause,
applause, exit stage right,

987
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:02,873
and by the time they realize
what happened...

988
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:04,574
So long, suckers!

989
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,343
...we'll be driving off
into the sunset,

990
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:07,644
legacy cemented.

991
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:09,113
Nice.

992
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,514
Got to hand it to you, buddy.

993
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:12,582
You're a real artist.

994
00:47:15,185 --> 00:47:17,121
Well, Good Guys, this is it.

995
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:18,655
Good luck out there.

996
00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:22,626
Remember, all eyes will be
on you tonight, not me.

997
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:26,630
Friends, meet the Good Guys!

998
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:34,338
Uh, this is different.

999
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:36,440
- Is this a prank?
- What's that sound?

1000
00:47:36,573 --> 00:47:38,642
Like screaming
but not terrified.

1001
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:41,611
All right, guys,
let's, uh... let's mingle.

00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:43,914

Yeah, with criminals like this,

1025

you got to be crafty,
subtle, invisible.

As you know,
the money raised tonight

1114
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:57,194
will be delivered tomorrow
to schools, hospitals

1115
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:59,363
and other worthy causes
across the city.

1116
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,899
Uh...

1117
00:53:03,032 --> 00:53:06,069
I just want to take
a moment to recognize

1118
00:53:06,203 --> 00:53:08,338
the one responsible
for our new outlook.

1119
00:53:08,472 --> 00:53:10,974
Our brilliant mentor,

1120
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:12,709
- a paragon of enlightenment...
- Do it. - Come on.

1121
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:15,845
...the one and only
Professor...

1122
00:53:18,482 --> 00:53:20,650
- Wolf, do it.
- ...uh, Professor...

1123
00:53:22,186 --> 00:53:24,388
...um...

1124
00:53:26,223 --> 00:53:28,358
...Professor Marmalade!

1125
00:53:31,027 --> 00:53:33,297
Chief, may I do the honors?

1126
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:37,601
That's not the plan.

1127
00:53:37,734 --> 00:53:38,768
What is happening?

1128
00:53:38,902 --> 00:53:40,304
He's gone rogue.

1129
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:43,607
A deal's a deal.

1130
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:47,477
By the power vested in me,
it is a pleasure

1131
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:50,113
to grant the Bad Guys
a full par...

1132
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,720
- That was weird.
- The meteorite is gone!

1133
00:53:56,853 --> 00:53:58,222
Somebody stole it!

1134
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,192
Chief.

1135
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,194
- Wolf.
- Come on.

1136
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:05,962
You can't possibly think
that we did this.

1137
00:54:06,095 --> 00:54:08,298
So long, suckers!

1138
00:54:09,399 --> 00:54:10,800
Run!

1139
00:54:10,934 --> 00:54:12,269
Get them!

1140
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:22,011
Uh...

1141
00:54:25,715 --> 00:54:27,384
Here. Here.

1142
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:30,086
- What are you doing?
- I'm giving it all back.

1143
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,321
Huh?

1144
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:33,523
Excuse me.

1145
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,062
- What happened back there?
- I couldn't do it.

1146
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:40,930
What do you mean,
you couldn't do it?

1147
00:54:41,064 --> 00:54:42,332
- I-I-I just... I...
- No!

1148
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:44,768
- I do not run.
- Hut, hut, hut...

1149
00:54:44,901 --> 00:54:46,570
That is not how I roll.

1150
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:48,505
Piranha,
don't do anything crazy.

1151
00:54:50,106 --> 00:54:53,410
Crazy is what I bring
to the party, chico.

1152
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:02,652
Hey, you're making a mistake.

1153
00:55:02,786 --> 00:55:03,753
We didn't do it.

1154
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,021
I know we always say that,

1155
00:55:05,154 --> 00:55:06,222
but this time
it's actually true.

1156
00:55:06,356 --> 00:55:08,224
A-la-la-la-la. Can't hear you.

1157
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:10,460
- Guilty, guilty, guilty.
- Talk to Marmalade.

1158
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:12,396
We're really good now.
He'll tell you.

1159
00:55:12,529 --> 00:55:13,630
Professor!

1160
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:16,032
Tonight's headline:
Change is impossible.

1161
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:18,034
You should always judge
a book by its cover,

1162
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:20,404
and all stereotypes
have been affirmed.

1163
00:55:20,537 --> 00:55:22,138
Stop, for goodness' sake!

1164
00:55:22,272 --> 00:55:23,573
Let me speak to them.

1165
00:55:23,707 --> 00:55:26,242
I'm-I'm sure there's been
some misunderstanding.

1166
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:29,178
Ah, Professor Marmalade.

1167
00:55:29,313 --> 00:55:30,680
You've got five minutes.

1168
00:55:30,814 --> 00:55:32,816
No deals this time.

1169
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:33,983
Y-You have to help us.

1170
00:55:34,117 --> 00:55:35,652
Tell 'em.
Tell 'em we didn't do it.

1171
00:55:35,785 --> 00:55:37,654
There, there.
Of course you didn't do it.

1172
00:55:37,787 --> 00:55:38,922
How could you?

1173
00:55:39,055 --> 00:55:42,426
After all,
you're such a good boy.

1174
00:55:43,226 --> 00:55:46,596
You're such a good boy.

1175
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,432
That shiver up my spine.

1176
00:55:48,565 --> 00:55:50,800
The wag in my tiny tail.

1177
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:52,168
Arrest them!

1178
00:55:52,302 --> 00:55:54,070
What if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

1179
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:56,506
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness...

1180
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,875
Where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite

1181
00:55:59,008 --> 00:56:01,545
will be on display
for the first time ever.

1182
00:56:01,678 --> 00:56:04,981
All eyes will be
on you tonight, not me.

1183
00:56:05,815 --> 00:56:07,050
You're such a...

1184
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:09,486
Good boy.

1185
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:11,888
You.

1186
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:13,590
It was all you.

1187
00:56:13,723 --> 00:56:15,124
What are you talking about,
Wolf?

1188
00:56:15,258 --> 00:56:16,526
The old lady,
the Golden Dolphin,

1189
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,395
good training...
it was all to get us here,

1190
00:56:18,528 --> 00:56:20,764
so he could steal the meteorite
and let us take the fall.

1191
00:56:20,897 --> 00:56:22,566
Whoa. Whoa, what old lady?

1192
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:25,201
And-and why would a guinea pig
want a meteorite anyway?

1193
00:56:28,237 --> 00:56:31,040
Uh, guys, he's creeping me out.

1194
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:32,776
Wait, what? What's going on?

1195
00:56:32,909 --> 00:56:34,177
Someone turn me around.

1196
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,945
Well, well.

1197
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,981
So, you finally get it.

1198
00:56:38,114 --> 00:56:39,516
- Wait.
- What?

1199
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:41,117
You stole the meteorite?

1200
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,219
Oh, it's not just a meteorite.

1201
00:56:43,353 --> 00:56:44,788
I told you guys it's a butt.

1202
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:46,122
It's not a butt!

1203
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:50,059
It's the ultimate power source.

1204
00:56:50,193 --> 00:56:53,062
You see, when it struck,
scientists found that

1205
00:56:53,196 --> 00:56:54,931
it emitted
an electromagnetic frequency

1206
00:56:55,064 --> 00:56:57,000
unlike anything else on Earth.

1207
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,802
I'm going to harness its power

1208
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:02,138
to pull off the greatest heist
the world has ever seen.

1209
00:57:02,939 --> 00:57:04,874
You should've eaten him
when you had the chance.

1210
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:06,476
- Yep.
- But why us?

1211
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,845
Because you're
the perfect patsies.

1212
00:57:08,978 --> 00:57:12,449
Come on, when people look up
"bad" in the dictionary,

1213
00:57:12,582 --> 00:57:15,051
do they see a sweet,
adorable guinea pig?

1214
00:57:15,184 --> 00:57:17,053
No. They see you.

1215
00:57:17,186 --> 00:57:19,423
And they always will.

1216
00:57:19,556 --> 00:57:20,824
Okay, fine.

1217
00:57:20,957 --> 00:57:22,225
But you set us up.

1218
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:23,627
Oh, pish-pish.

1219
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,596
Let's be honest...
evolution set you up.

1220
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,932
But Wolfie here
really clinched it.

1221
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:31,868
You fell for every one
of my traps,

1222
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:35,805
starting with saving
a helpless little old lady.

1223
00:57:35,939 --> 00:57:39,108
Wolf, what's he talking about?

1224
00:57:41,377 --> 00:57:42,912
Whoops.

1225
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:45,782
Did I say too much?

1226
00:57:45,915 --> 00:57:48,251
Anyhoo, looks like, yet again,

1227
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:52,021
the Big Bad Wolf got outsmarted
by a little piggy.

1228
00:57:52,155 --> 00:57:54,991
You little pouchy-cheeked rat!

1229
00:57:55,124 --> 00:57:56,526
I'll kill you! You hear me?

1230
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,795
- You're dead! You're de...
- Help! Help! Help!

1231
00:57:58,928 --> 00:58:00,564
The Big Bad Wolf
is attacking me.

1232
00:58:00,697 --> 00:58:03,232
Oh, now you are done
forever, Wolf!

1233
00:58:12,476 --> 00:58:14,310
Professor, Professor,

1234
00:58:14,444 --> 00:58:16,379
any thoughts
on how the Bad Guys managed

1235
00:58:16,513 --> 00:58:18,915
to steal the meteorite
in plain sight?

1236
00:58:19,048 --> 00:58:20,283
Well, off the top of my head,

1237
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:22,151
perhaps they accessed the site
previously

1238
00:58:22,285 --> 00:58:23,553
and set up an intricate system

1239
00:58:23,687 --> 00:58:25,221
- of tunnels and trapdoors...
- Uh-huh.

1240
00:58:25,354 --> 00:58:26,690
...that could be
remotely triggered

1241
00:58:26,823 --> 00:58:28,291
to suck the meteorite down
into a holding area,

1242
00:58:28,424 --> 00:58:29,993
- but how should I know?
- Totally.

1243
00:58:30,126 --> 00:58:32,862
I mean, they're the
deranged masterminds, not me.

1244
00:58:55,084 --> 00:58:57,554
I'm giving it all back.

1245
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:23,146
I can't believe
we got double-crossed

1246
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:24,581
by a tiny rodent.

1247
00:59:24,714 --> 00:59:27,050
Oh, we got double-crossed
by a rodent all right,

1248
00:59:27,183 --> 00:59:29,886
- but, uh, not a tiny one.
- What?

1249
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:32,522
This was supposed to be
us conning Marmalade.

1250
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:35,825
It turns out
it was Wolf conning us.

1251
00:59:37,627 --> 00:59:39,495
Does that sound familiar
to you, Wolf?

1252
00:59:39,629 --> 00:59:41,297
Why-why would you think that?

1253
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:44,033
Oh, I don't know, maybe because
you just sabotaged

1254
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:46,269
the biggest heist of our lives.

1255
00:59:46,402 --> 00:59:49,505
I think you owe us
an explanation, buddy.

1256
00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:52,175
Okay. You're right.

1257
00:59:52,308 --> 00:59:53,843
This is what happened.

1258
00:59:53,977 --> 00:59:56,512
Back in the museum, I just tried
to steal an old lady's purse.

1259
00:59:56,646 --> 00:59:58,481
Classic snatch and grab.

1260
00:59:58,615 --> 01:00:00,817
Tried to? Since when do you try

1261
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,819
to steal something
and not just steal it?

1262
01:00:02,952 --> 01:00:06,189
I was trying to steal the purse
when the old lady fell and...

1263
01:00:06,322 --> 01:00:08,291
I kind of helped her.

1264
01:00:08,424 --> 01:00:09,325
What?

1265
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:11,427
I kind of helped her.

1266
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:13,429
But then you stole her purse.

1267
01:00:13,563 --> 01:00:14,864
No, I didn't.

1268
01:00:14,998 --> 01:00:17,366
I saved the old lady,
and she hugged me,

1269
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,003
and my tail wagged,
and I didn't know what it was,

1270
01:00:20,136 --> 01:00:23,506
but it felt, uh,
you know... good.

1271
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:26,275
Ah.

1272
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:28,211
But then you stole the purse.

1273
01:00:28,344 --> 01:00:29,779
No!

1274
01:00:29,913 --> 01:00:32,148
You know, I heard
what the pig said to you

1275
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:33,850
about cutting us loose.

1276
01:00:33,983 --> 01:00:35,652
Wait. Like, "us" us?

1277
01:00:35,785 --> 01:00:37,754
But I never thought
you'd actually do it, man.

1278
01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:39,322
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1279
01:00:39,455 --> 01:00:41,858
I-I would never...
I was trying to...

1280
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:44,060
I was trying to find us
a better life.

1281
01:00:44,193 --> 01:00:47,664
Our life was perfect
until you decided to ruin it.

1282
01:00:47,797 --> 01:00:48,998
I didn't.

1283
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:50,566
You guys felt it at the gala.

1284
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,535
The clapping, the cheering.

1285
01:00:52,669 --> 01:00:54,938
We were more than...
than just scary villains.

1286
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:56,172
They loved us.

1287
01:00:56,305 --> 01:00:58,742
Oh, yeah?
If they loved us so much,

1288
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:02,478
how come we're in prison
for a crime we didn't commit?

1289
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:04,748
You know what?
I'll give Marmalade this.

1290
01:01:04,881 --> 01:01:06,916
At least he sees the world
for what it is:

1291
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,185
a place where
some people are scary

1292
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:11,220
and some people are scared.

1293
01:01:11,354 --> 01:01:12,588
Oh, yeah?

1294
01:01:12,722 --> 01:01:14,290
Well, I'm tired of being scary.

1295
01:01:14,423 --> 01:01:15,992
I'm-I'm tired of
being an outcast.

1296
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,727
Maybe I don't want to be a...

1297
01:01:17,861 --> 01:01:19,195
What? A Bad Guy?

1298
01:01:19,328 --> 01:01:21,364
Don't want to be
a Bad Guy anymore, huh?

1299
01:01:21,497 --> 01:01:23,599
Say it, Wolf.

1300
01:01:25,669 --> 01:01:27,136
Yeah, I thought so.

1301
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,272
And us, your lifelong friends?

1302
01:01:29,405 --> 01:01:30,874
We're just holding you back?

1303
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,809
Yeah, maybe you are!

1304
01:01:35,178 --> 01:01:36,780
Take it back!

1305
01:01:36,913 --> 01:01:39,382
Take it back! Apologize!

1306
01:01:39,515 --> 01:01:41,250
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1307
01:01:41,384 --> 01:01:42,886
Prison is no place for fighting.

1308
01:01:44,487 --> 01:01:46,289
Tell that to him.

1309
01:01:46,422 --> 01:01:47,757
Huh?

1310
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:54,463
What?

1311
01:02:11,147 --> 01:02:12,716
Shh.

1312
01:02:28,664 --> 01:02:30,867
Run!

1313
01:02:37,306 --> 01:02:38,875
- Oh!
- W-W-Wait, wait. Ho-Hold on.

1314
01:02:41,277 --> 01:02:42,211
Diane?

1315
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:43,479
But how do you know how to do

1316
01:02:43,612 --> 01:02:44,781
all of that
kick-kick-punch-punch?

1317
01:02:44,914 --> 01:02:47,150
Wait a sec,
you're the Crimson Paw?

1318
01:02:49,685 --> 01:02:51,154
The queen of cons,

1319
01:02:51,287 --> 01:02:52,555
acrobatic Swiss Army knife.

1320
01:02:52,688 --> 01:02:54,023
Stole the Zumpango diamond
twice.

1321
01:02:54,157 --> 01:02:56,525
Once for profit,
second time just for fun.

1322
01:02:56,659 --> 01:02:59,062
Never identified, never caught.

1323
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:02,031
Guess I'm still
the best bad guy

1324
01:03:02,165 --> 01:03:04,033
the world has ever seen.

1325
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:06,602
Ugh, at least I used to be.

1326
01:03:06,736 --> 01:03:08,071
Huh?

1327
01:03:17,413 --> 01:03:19,115
Nope, I'm still the best.

1328
01:03:19,248 --> 01:03:21,650
Just like riding
a stolen bicycle.

1329
01:03:21,785 --> 01:03:24,320
Oh, uh, you got a little...
Ouch.

1330
01:03:24,453 --> 01:03:26,522
Hey, wh-why did you
save us anyway?

1331
01:03:26,655 --> 01:03:28,758
After the gala,
I knew something wasn't right,

1332
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,894
so I did some investigating,
and that meteor...

1333
01:03:31,027 --> 01:03:34,297
I know. Some kind of cosmic
mega-super-antennae thing.

1334
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:37,133
Right. If conducted through
an array of ionized crystals,

1335
01:03:37,266 --> 01:03:39,135
it will generate a massive
psychokinetic field

1336
01:03:39,268 --> 01:03:40,469
the size of a city.

1337
01:03:40,603 --> 01:03:41,938
Oh, my gosh.
Did I interrupt you?

1338
01:03:42,071 --> 01:03:43,172
Were you gonna say that?

1339
01:03:43,306 --> 01:03:45,875
Uh, I-I-I was gonna be
a little more technical,

1340
01:03:46,009 --> 01:03:48,912
but you got the gist of it.

1341
01:03:49,979 --> 01:03:53,116
Marmalade needs to be stopped,
but I can't do it alone.

1342
01:03:53,249 --> 01:03:55,351
You know his compound
better than anyone.

1343
01:03:55,484 --> 01:03:57,120
You can count on us.

1344
01:03:57,253 --> 01:03:58,421
Right, guys?

1345
01:03:58,554 --> 01:04:00,456
There is no "us."

1346
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:02,125
We're through, Wolf.

1347
01:04:02,258 --> 01:04:03,659
Done. Finito.

1348
01:04:03,793 --> 01:04:06,129
Because of that little tiff
back there?

1349
01:04:06,262 --> 01:04:08,464
Come on, man, that's what we do.

1350
01:04:08,597 --> 01:04:10,166
You serve, I volley.

1351
01:04:10,299 --> 01:04:12,268
That's our little dance.

1352
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:14,470
Not this time.

1353
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:20,643
Piranha?

1354
01:04:24,013 --> 01:04:25,214
Webs?

1355
01:04:25,348 --> 01:04:26,950
Sorry, Wolfie.

1356
01:04:28,717 --> 01:04:30,019
Shark.

1357
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:31,520
Hmm.

1358
01:04:31,654 --> 01:04:33,322
Hey.

1359
01:04:33,456 --> 01:04:35,024
Guys?

1360
01:04:35,992 --> 01:04:37,293
Guys?

1361
01:04:38,094 --> 01:04:41,630
You want to know why
I hate birthdays, Wolf? Do you?

1362
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:46,735
When you grow up a snake,
nobody shows up to your party.

1363
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:49,839
Birthdays are a constant
reminder that out there

1364
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:54,978
I'm just a scary,
good-for-nothing monster.

1365
01:04:56,412 --> 01:04:58,081
Yeah.

1366
01:04:58,214 --> 01:05:01,017
But nothing compares
to having the one guy...

1367
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,420
the one guy I thought
I could trust

1368
01:05:04,553 --> 01:05:06,655
stab me in the back.

1369
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:12,828
Come on, guys.
Let's get out of here.

1370
01:05:59,909 --> 01:06:03,947
Now, this is what
a true bad guy looks like.

1371
01:06:09,986 --> 01:06:12,821
What do you say
we have some fun?

1372
01:06:51,727 --> 01:06:54,463
Hey. You okay?

1373
01:06:54,597 --> 01:06:56,232
No, I'm not okay.

1374
01:06:56,365 --> 01:06:59,068
I'm very, very un-okay.

1375
01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:02,238
Just left the only friends
I have ever had,

1376
01:07:02,371 --> 01:07:05,708
so what am I...
what am I doing?

1377
01:07:08,511 --> 01:07:11,314
I know this isn't easy,

1378
01:07:11,447 --> 01:07:13,582
leaving everything behind.

1379
01:07:13,716 --> 01:07:15,051
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1380
01:07:15,184 --> 01:07:17,520
I was the best thief
in the world.

1381
01:07:17,653 --> 01:07:21,524
Fast, fearless, inventive.

1382
01:07:21,657 --> 01:07:24,493
I just had one thing
left to steal.

1383
01:07:24,627 --> 01:07:26,262
The Golden Dolphin.

1384
01:07:26,395 --> 01:07:28,264
So you went after it.

1385
01:07:28,397 --> 01:07:30,266
I didn't just go after it.

1386
01:07:31,434 --> 01:07:33,336
I had it.

1387
01:07:33,469 --> 01:07:35,704
And a clear escape route.

1388
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:40,243
But...

1389
01:07:40,376 --> 01:07:42,878
all I saw in the end
was the tricky fox

1390
01:07:43,012 --> 01:07:45,781
that they always told me I was.

1391
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,018
It changed everything.

1392
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:51,620
So, now,
instead of hurting people,

1393
01:07:51,754 --> 01:07:53,322
I'm helping them.

1394
01:07:53,456 --> 01:07:55,024
I'm still me.

1395
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:58,261
I'm just me on the right side.

1396
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:01,197
You're doing the right thing.

1397
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,800
And someday your friends,
if they're real friends,

1398
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:07,136
I think they'll understand.

1399
01:08:08,003 --> 01:08:10,073
Now, come on, let's get inside.

1400
01:08:10,206 --> 01:08:13,042
You look like you just busted out of a prison.

1401
01:08:16,579 --> 01:08:17,913
Guinea pigs?

1402
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,382
Marmalade.

1403
01:08:19,515 --> 01:08:20,516
Let's bounce.

1404
01:08:22,418 --> 01:08:25,054
So this is the hideout
of the great Crimson Paw.

1405
01:08:26,589 --> 01:08:27,723
Snack break?

1406
01:08:27,856 --> 01:08:29,592
Okay, oddly timed,
but you do you.

1407
01:08:30,926 --> 01:08:31,960
Identity verified.

1408
01:08:32,095 --> 01:08:34,330
- What?
- Welcome, Diane.

1409
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:43,139
Whoa! Holy moly!

1410
01:08:43,272 --> 01:08:45,574
It's so good to be home.

1411
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:46,809
Are you kidding me?

1412
01:08:46,942 --> 01:08:48,577
Laser-sighted zip line?

1413
01:08:48,711 --> 01:08:51,280
The XM-2400 radar jammer?
No way.

1414
01:08:51,414 --> 01:08:53,549
I actually prefer
the earlier model.

1415
01:08:53,682 --> 01:08:55,451
Agree to disagree.

1416
01:08:55,584 --> 01:08:57,186
Uh, this stuff is nice, too.

1417
01:08:58,487 --> 01:08:59,822
Yeah, that's a blowtorch.

1418
01:08:59,955 --> 01:09:01,957
Also, not really your color.

1419
01:09:03,392 --> 01:09:05,060
All righty, Marmalade.

1420
01:09:05,194 --> 01:09:08,731
What are you up to,
you fuzzy little weirdo?

1421
01:09:08,864 --> 01:09:10,399
We need eyes on the city.

1422
01:09:10,533 --> 01:09:11,867
Let's see if we can't hack

1423
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,269
into the government's
surveillance satellite.

1424
01:09:13,402 --> 01:09:15,138
But you're the governor.
Couldn't you just ask?

1425
01:09:15,271 --> 01:09:17,440
Yeah, but...
the paperwork.

1426
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:26,081
I am definitely picking up
on suspicious activity here.

1427
01:09:26,215 --> 01:09:28,384
Those are guinea pig
heat signatures.

1428
01:09:28,517 --> 01:09:30,786
Marmalade seems to be
controlling them.

1429
01:09:30,919 --> 01:09:32,921
But to do what?

1430
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,490
There are no obvious targets.

1431
01:09:36,492 --> 01:09:38,894
That's because
they're moving targets.

1432
01:09:39,027 --> 01:09:41,997
His charity fundraiser.

1433
01:09:42,131 --> 01:09:44,400
He's gonna steal the money
raised in his own name?

1434
01:09:44,533 --> 01:09:47,069
It's the greatest heist
the world's ever seen.

1435
01:09:47,203 --> 01:09:49,238
$1 billion inside trucks,

1436
01:09:49,372 --> 01:09:51,374
on their way to charities
all over the city.

1437
01:09:51,507 --> 01:09:52,908
We need to cut off
Marmalade's communication

1438
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:54,076
with his guinea pig army.

1439
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:55,744
If there's no signal...

1440
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:57,079
There's no heist.

1441
01:09:57,213 --> 01:09:59,315
We have to steal the meteorite.

1442
01:09:59,448 --> 01:10:00,549
That was very cute,

1443
01:10:00,683 --> 01:10:02,117
- that thing we just did there.
- All right.

1444
01:10:02,251 --> 01:10:04,620
Put on your big-girl pants.
We're gearing up.

1445
01:10:10,626 --> 01:10:11,927
I wouldn't take that.

1446
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,596
Those things rip your pants
right off.

1447
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:15,431
Huh. Try wearing
clean underwear.

1448
01:10:15,564 --> 01:10:17,366
Just in case.

1449
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:19,468
Wha...

1450
01:10:20,803 --> 01:10:23,071
You stole my car?

1451
01:10:23,206 --> 01:10:24,473
Respect.

1452
01:10:24,607 --> 01:10:27,243
Let's do this.

1453
01:10:38,687 --> 01:10:39,688
- No!
- What?

1454
01:10:39,822 --> 01:10:41,190
All our stuff?

1455
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,492
- Where is everything?
- No, no, no, no, no.

1456
01:10:43,626 --> 01:10:45,294
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- All our stuff.

1457
01:10:45,428 --> 01:10:47,196
- It's all gone.
- My disguise closet!

1458
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,565
Where's my things?

1459
01:10:50,666 --> 01:10:52,935
Wolf gave away all our loot.

1460
01:10:53,068 --> 01:10:55,371
We stole it fair and square.

1461
01:10:55,504 --> 01:10:57,506
Now I understand
what it feels like

1462
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,276
to have things stolen from you.

1463
01:11:00,409 --> 01:11:02,110
I don't like it!

1464
01:11:02,245 --> 01:11:04,947
I really don't like it!

1465
01:11:10,453 --> 01:11:12,955
We got no food.
We got no money.

1466
01:11:13,088 --> 01:11:14,490
We got no money
we could use to buy food.

1467
01:11:14,623 --> 01:11:16,592
No food we can sell for money.

1468
01:11:16,725 --> 01:11:18,794
We...

1469
01:11:18,927 --> 01:11:20,996
All right, okay, okay.

1470
01:11:21,129 --> 01:11:23,399
Here, here. Take it.

1471
01:11:23,532 --> 01:11:25,568
Now, stop crying, buddy.

1472
01:11:28,271 --> 01:11:32,908
Um, Snake, what did you just do?

1473
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:34,710
What? My friend was sad.

1474
01:11:34,843 --> 01:11:36,279
I was just cheering him up.

1475
01:11:36,412 --> 01:11:38,781
You... you did a good thing.

1476
01:11:38,914 --> 01:11:40,783
- For me.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1477
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:43,118
I just put your needs
before my own.

1478
01:11:43,252 --> 01:11:45,621
- Yeah. You're being good.
- I'm not.

1479
01:11:45,754 --> 01:11:48,657
I was simply making a sacrifice
so Shark could be happy.

1480
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:51,794
That is the actual definition
of being good.

1481
01:11:51,927 --> 01:11:53,829
Snake, you,

1482
01:11:53,962 --> 01:11:56,064
the worst one of us,
the most selfish.

1483
01:11:56,198 --> 01:11:57,666
- Spiteful.
- Terrible.

1484
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,901
- Sneaky.
- Dishonest.

1485
01:11:59,034 --> 01:12:00,068
- Insensitive.
- Manipulative.

1486
01:12:00,202 --> 01:12:01,570
- Snakelike.
- Stanky.

1487
01:12:01,704 --> 01:12:03,606
And your point is?

1488
01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:05,508
I think Wolf was right.

1489
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:08,644
Maybe we could be more
than just scary villains.

1490
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,115
Wh...?

1491
01:12:13,248 --> 01:12:14,950
Oh, wow.

1492
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:17,586
Is this... is this wagging?

1493
01:12:18,587 --> 01:12:20,255
We're-we're wagging.

1494
01:12:22,057 --> 01:12:24,760
No, no, no!

1495
01:12:24,893 --> 01:12:28,997
We'll always be Bad Guys!

1496
01:12:54,923 --> 01:12:57,360
Faster, faster, my little pigs.

1497
01:13:41,169 --> 01:13:42,938
Once we steal the meteorite,

1498
01:13:43,071 --> 01:13:44,807
we take it straight
to the police.

1499
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,542
And all will be forgiven.

1500
01:13:46,675 --> 01:13:50,112
I don't know about "all,"
but it's a start.

1501
01:14:09,364 --> 01:14:10,833
That's strange.

1502
01:14:10,966 --> 01:14:14,069
Why would Marmalade leave
the Golden Dolphin unprotected?

1503
01:14:14,202 --> 01:14:17,072
- Because maybe it's a trap.
- Or maybe...

1504
01:14:17,205 --> 01:14:19,341
Wait, wait, wait!

1505
01:14:20,108 --> 01:14:21,243
Yeah, it was a trap.

1506
01:14:21,376 --> 01:14:22,811
Well, well, well.

1507
01:14:22,945 --> 01:14:25,414
If it isn't my prized pupil.

1508
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:27,616
And you've brought along
the governor.

1509
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,084
Or should I say...

1510
01:14:29,217 --> 01:14:30,686
the Crimson Paw?

1511
01:14:30,819 --> 01:14:35,624
Mm, what an ingenious way
to disguise a Zumpango diamond,

1512
01:14:35,758 --> 01:14:37,960
hiding it in plain sight.

1513
01:14:38,093 --> 01:14:40,062
You got to be kidding me.

1514
01:14:40,195 --> 01:14:41,930
What? I'm sentimental.

1515
01:14:42,064 --> 01:14:43,566
You always did have panache.

1516
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:46,602
And yet, you still fell
right into my trap.

1517
01:14:46,735 --> 01:14:48,971
But how did you know
we'd even be here?

1518
01:14:49,104 --> 01:14:52,140
Oh, I got a little tip
from a friend.

1519
01:14:53,776 --> 01:14:55,077
Hey, buddy.

1520
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,512
How's it hanging?

1521
01:14:56,645 --> 01:14:59,147
Snake.

1522
01:14:59,281 --> 01:15:01,016
What can I say? We just clicked.

1523
01:15:01,149 --> 01:15:04,820
Oh, yeah? How's it feel to be
working for your favorite food?

1524
01:15:04,953 --> 01:15:06,855
Ah, you're just jealous

1525
01:15:06,989 --> 01:15:09,257
to be missing out
on the heist of the century.

1526
01:15:09,391 --> 01:15:11,059
It's got everything:

1527
01:15:11,193 --> 01:15:14,096
betrayal, a meteor,
mind control.

1528
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:15,631
Can I try it on?

1529
01:15:15,764 --> 01:15:17,432
Of course, partner.

1530
01:15:17,566 --> 01:15:21,504
Nice. All the crime
with none of the exercise.

1531
01:15:22,938 --> 01:15:24,740
What about all that
"flower of goodness" talk?

1532
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:26,041
Was it all just a lie?

1533
01:15:26,174 --> 01:15:27,843
Uh, pretty much, yeah.

1534
01:15:27,976 --> 01:15:30,178
You see, I never cared
about what's "good."

1535
01:15:30,312 --> 01:15:32,280
Only what's good for me.

1536
01:15:32,414 --> 01:15:34,883
Like, say, a billion dollars.

1537
01:15:35,017 --> 01:15:37,786
Ooh, I just got a tingle.

1538
01:15:39,254 --> 01:15:40,756
Go bad...

1539
01:15:40,889 --> 01:15:42,958
Or go home.

1540
01:15:43,091 --> 01:15:45,594
Cuddles, finish them.

1541
01:15:54,302 --> 01:15:55,771
Poison gas.

1542
01:15:55,904 --> 01:15:57,172
Don't breathe it in.

1543
01:15:57,305 --> 01:15:59,174
Wait a second.

1544
01:15:59,307 --> 01:16:01,043
That's not poison gas.

1545
01:16:02,945 --> 01:16:03,846
Sorry!

1546
01:16:05,147 --> 01:16:06,248
Surprise!

1547
01:16:06,381 --> 01:16:09,184
What? Ah, guys.

1548
01:16:09,317 --> 01:16:10,753
I can't believe it's you.

1549
01:16:10,886 --> 01:16:13,321
- You were right, Wolfie.
- We felt the wag, man.

1550
01:16:13,455 --> 01:16:15,023
- And the tingle.
- It's good, right?

1551
01:16:15,157 --> 01:16:16,458
This is super moving,

1552
01:16:16,592 --> 01:16:18,193
but can we do this later?

1553
01:16:18,326 --> 01:16:20,629
Feels like I got
a rhythm section in my fin.

1554
01:16:22,264 --> 01:16:24,132
- Ah, ah!
- Ugh. Come on.

1555
01:16:24,266 --> 01:16:25,167
Spinning blades!

1556
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,535
Oh, yeah. Right.

1557
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:27,870
Sorry. I got it.

1558
01:16:30,172 --> 01:16:31,707
Guys...

1559
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,342
Am I happy to see you.

1560
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:38,647
Now it's time to huff and puff

1561
01:16:38,781 --> 01:16:40,749
and blow this little piggy's
heist down.

1562
01:16:40,883 --> 01:16:42,484
Game over, guinea pig.

1563
01:16:42,618 --> 01:16:45,921
With this meteorite,
we will be able to commit crimes

1564
01:16:46,054 --> 01:16:47,990
people have only dreamed about.

1565
01:16:48,123 --> 01:16:50,058
Not bad for a butt rock.

1566
01:16:50,192 --> 01:16:53,028
Once again, it's not a...

1567
01:16:53,161 --> 01:16:54,697
Don't mind us.

1568
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:56,599
Just robbing this place.

1569
01:16:59,034 --> 01:17:00,502
No, no, no!

1570
01:17:06,441 --> 01:17:08,043
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

1571
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,595
- All right!
- We did it!

1572
01:17:26,729 --> 01:17:29,431
Now to get this thing to
the chief and clear your names.

1573
01:17:29,564 --> 01:17:31,667
Weird. Usually, we drive
away from the police.

1574
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,302
Hey, chico, are you sure
we stopped the heist?

1575
01:17:34,436 --> 01:17:36,038
- Yeah.
- Relax.

1576
01:17:36,171 --> 01:17:38,440
Marmalade can't control them if
he doesn't have the meteorite.

1577
01:17:38,573 --> 01:17:40,809
So, who's driving those trucks?

1578
01:17:44,212 --> 01:17:46,081
The meteorite.

1579
01:17:46,214 --> 01:17:47,515
- It's still transmitting.
- Uh-oh.

1580
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:49,885
The charity money.
Change of plan, guys.

1581
01:17:50,018 --> 01:17:51,519
Webs, is there some way
to override

1582
01:17:51,654 --> 01:17:52,955
the truck's navigation system?

1583
01:17:53,088 --> 01:17:54,256

interceptor.

Oh, no.

1590
01:18:20,148 --> 01:18:21,283
We got to split up.

1591
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:23,151

the meteorite?

they'll throw us a party?

1653
01:20:45,093 --> 01:20:48,630
Yeah. With fireworks,
piñatas and cake.

1654
01:21:05,013 --> 01:21:07,115
We can't do this without him.

1655
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,784
He might be
a Mr. Grumpy Pants...

1656
01:21:09,918 --> 01:21:12,420
But he's our Mr. Grumpy Pants.

1657
01:21:12,554 --> 01:21:15,157
Yeah.

1658
01:21:16,491 --> 01:21:17,860
Wolf!

1659
01:21:17,993 --> 01:21:20,896
I'm starting to see
why your friends dumped you.

1660
01:21:21,029 --> 01:21:23,198
I don't have any friends!

1661
01:21:23,331 --> 01:21:25,901
Snake! Snake!

1662
01:21:26,034 --> 01:21:27,302
Wolf?

1663
01:21:27,435 --> 01:21:28,670
Snake, come back!

1664
01:21:28,803 --> 01:21:30,305
We need you, baby!

1665
01:21:30,438 --> 01:21:31,874
And you need us!

1666
01:21:32,007 --> 01:21:35,978
Oh, there you go again,
making it personal.

1667
01:21:36,111 --> 01:21:38,914
I'll give you one last chance
to give me the meteorite.

1668
01:21:39,047 --> 01:21:41,984
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do, Whiskers?

1669
01:21:42,851 --> 01:21:44,319
This.

1670
01:21:45,587 --> 01:21:47,222
What the...?

1671
01:21:53,361 --> 01:21:54,462
We've got adorable company.

1672
01:21:54,596 --> 01:21:56,631
Floor it!

1673
01:22:01,069 --> 01:22:02,604
Whoa!

1674
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:07,242
Maybe I shouldn't have
called him Whiskers.

1675
01:22:14,649 --> 01:22:15,918
When I woke up this morning,

1676
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:18,386
this is not where
I saw the day going.

1677
01:22:21,823 --> 01:22:23,025
Come on.

1678
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:25,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1679
01:22:25,793 --> 01:22:27,662
Hey, hey, let's dial this down
a notch, huh?

1680
01:22:27,795 --> 01:22:29,464
Besides, you'll never get him.

1681
01:22:29,597 --> 01:22:31,499
He's too good a driver.

1682
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:33,101
Hmm. You're right.

1683
01:22:33,235 --> 01:22:35,670
But now that I think of it,
maybe it would be better

1684
01:22:35,803 --> 01:22:37,439
to exploit
his greatest weakness.

1685
01:22:37,572 --> 01:22:39,374
Exactly.

1686
01:22:39,507 --> 01:22:41,843
Wait.

1687
01:22:44,846 --> 01:22:46,814
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hold on.

1688
01:22:46,949 --> 01:22:48,550
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1689
01:22:48,683 --> 01:22:50,385
Okay, okay. You win.

1690
01:22:50,518 --> 01:22:52,220
You can have the space rock.

1691
01:22:52,354 --> 01:22:53,721
Good boy, Wolf.

1692
01:23:03,898 --> 01:23:05,400
Take the wheel.

1693
01:23:05,533 --> 01:23:06,701
Not so fast.

1694
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:10,138
Pull him up first,
or I'll use this.

1695
01:23:10,272 --> 01:23:12,074
Oh, come now.

1696
01:23:16,144 --> 01:23:18,846
Do it, or you'll lose the rock.

1697
01:23:19,881 --> 01:23:21,316
If you insist.

1698
01:23:21,449 --> 01:23:22,817
Cuddles!

1699
01:23:29,757 --> 01:23:32,194
You want him? He's yours.

1700
01:23:36,398 --> 01:23:38,500
Snake! No, no, no!

1701
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:40,502
- Snake!
- Oh, no!

1702
01:23:53,748 --> 01:23:56,384
Guys, I know it's crazy,
but we're gonna jump it.

1703
01:23:56,518 --> 01:23:59,387
Crazy? You're finally speaking
my language, chico.

1704
01:24:09,697 --> 01:24:12,967
We're gonna make it!

1705
01:24:13,868 --> 01:24:15,137
No!

1706
01:24:20,442 --> 01:24:22,144
You came back.

1707
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,148
Snake.

1708
01:24:26,281 --> 01:24:27,649
I should've been honest
with you.

1709
01:24:27,782 --> 01:24:28,983
I was afraid that if you knew

1710
01:24:29,117 --> 01:24:30,752
I-I wanted to be good
that you'd...

1711
01:24:30,885 --> 01:24:33,788
Act like a jerk
and never talk to you again?

1712
01:24:33,921 --> 01:24:35,590
Yeah.

1713
01:24:35,723 --> 01:24:37,692
Point is I... I-I-I, you know...

1714
01:24:37,825 --> 01:24:40,395
Yeah. I love you, too, buddy.

1715
01:24:44,632 --> 01:24:46,301
This-this is so beautiful.

1716
01:24:46,434 --> 01:24:48,836
Do you know how beautiful
this is, you guys?

1717
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:50,072
Now...

1718
01:24:50,205 --> 01:24:51,906
Now you're gonna make me cry.

1719
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,541
I know!

1720
01:24:53,675 --> 01:24:55,143
So pathetic, right?

1721
01:24:55,277 --> 01:24:57,212
Come on, guys.

1722
01:24:57,345 --> 01:24:59,013
Who said it was the end?

1723
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,829
No, no, no, don't...
No, no. Cuddles!

1724
01:25:14,962 --> 01:25:16,598
We're losing altitude!

1725
01:25:16,731 --> 01:25:18,933
We're losing altitude!
We're going down!

1726
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,142
What happened? Did we blow up?

1727
01:25:27,275 --> 01:25:29,211
Is this heaven?

1728
01:25:38,052 --> 01:25:39,921
That is it.

1729
01:25:40,054 --> 01:25:41,556
Hey!

1730
01:25:41,689 --> 01:25:44,726
There is absolutely no way
you're getting away this time.

1731
01:25:44,859 --> 01:25:46,761
- Wait, Chief.
- Governor Foxington?

1732
01:25:46,894 --> 01:25:48,096
- Don't do this.
- Ow!

1733
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:49,531
They didn't steal the meteorite.

1734
01:25:49,664 --> 01:25:50,832
They were bringing it back.

1735
01:25:50,965 --> 01:25:52,967
Ha! How could you know that?

1736
01:25:53,101 --> 01:25:56,003
Unless...
unless you were conspiring

1737
01:25:56,138 --> 01:25:58,740
with a bunch of known criminals.

1738
01:25:59,674 --> 01:26:01,609
Well...

1739
01:26:01,743 --> 01:26:04,112
as a matter of fact,

1740
01:26:04,246 --> 01:26:06,481
it's time I came clean
about something.

1741
01:26:07,282 --> 01:26:10,585
The truth is I'm really...
r-really...

1742
01:26:10,718 --> 01:26:13,188
Really a big fan
of redemption arcs.

1743
01:26:13,321 --> 01:26:15,056
Yeah, we know.

1744
01:26:20,495 --> 01:26:21,729
We're done running away.

1745
01:26:21,863 --> 01:26:22,830
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1746
01:26:22,964 --> 01:26:24,666
- Yeah.
- Yep.

1747
01:26:24,799 --> 01:26:26,668
Chief, do what you need to do.

1748
01:26:26,801 --> 01:26:27,902
What?

1749
01:26:28,035 --> 01:26:30,805
Y-You're turning yourself in?

1750
01:26:30,938 --> 01:26:32,740
We might not have stolen
the meteorite,

1751
01:26:32,874 --> 01:26:35,210
but we did steal
a lot of other things.

1752
01:26:35,343 --> 01:26:37,745
It's time we took
some responsibility.

1753
01:26:37,879 --> 01:26:40,047
Start a clean state.

1754
01:26:40,848 --> 01:26:42,784
Take us in, Chief.

1755
01:26:43,585 --> 01:26:45,019
Wow, really?

1756
01:26:45,153 --> 01:26:46,454
You finally did it.

1757
01:26:46,588 --> 01:26:47,789
This is your moment, Chief.

1758
01:26:47,922 --> 01:26:49,157
Drink it in.

1759
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:50,425
Wow.

1760
01:26:50,558 --> 01:26:51,893
You know, I should...
I should give a speech.

1761
01:26:52,026 --> 01:26:53,161
I... Well, I-I should,
shouldn't I?

1762
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:54,996
Uh...

1763
01:26:55,129 --> 01:26:56,431
When I was six years old,

1764
01:26:56,564 --> 01:26:58,200
I decided that I wanted
to play the piccolo,

1765
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:00,168
only to find that
my fingers were just

1766
01:27:00,302 --> 01:27:03,004
too powerful for that
fragile little instrument.

1767
01:27:03,137 --> 01:27:05,607
And that's when I discovered
law enforcement.

1768
01:27:07,275 --> 01:27:08,943
I'm proud of you, Wolf.

1769
01:27:09,076 --> 01:27:12,280
You know, a fox and a wolf
are not that different.

1770
01:27:12,414 --> 01:27:14,349
You got a good thing
going here, Governor.

1771
01:27:14,482 --> 01:27:16,618
So, it turns out the saga
of the Bad Guys

1772
01:27:16,751 --> 01:27:20,255
has come to a simple and
totally satisfying conclusion.

1773
01:27:20,388 --> 01:27:23,090
Though I wonder,
what happened to the meteorite?

1774
01:27:23,225 --> 01:27:25,026
Cuddles! Faster, faster!

1775
01:27:25,159 --> 01:27:26,728
It's Professor Marmalade!

1776
01:27:26,861 --> 01:27:28,963
He's bringing
the meteorite back.

1777
01:27:29,096 --> 01:27:31,599
Huh? Uh, yes, yes.

1778
01:27:31,733 --> 01:27:33,601
Bringing... bringing it back.

1779
01:27:33,735 --> 01:27:35,470
That's precisely
what I am doing.

1780
01:27:38,873 --> 01:27:40,808
Look no further.

1781
01:27:40,942 --> 01:27:43,110
Your hero has arrived.

1782
01:27:43,245 --> 01:27:44,679
Professor, care to comment?

1783
01:27:44,812 --> 01:27:46,448
I tried to help them, Tiffany,

1784
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:49,251
but in the end,
it's the same old story.

1785
01:27:49,384 --> 01:27:52,287
Bad guys bad, good guys good.

1786
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,921
So true. So wise.

1787
01:27:54,055 --> 01:27:55,490
Furthermore,
for the good of the city,

1788
01:27:55,623 --> 01:27:58,125
I have generously decided
to take the meteorite

1789
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:00,962
back to my compound
for safekeeping.

1790
01:28:02,497 --> 01:28:04,098
Is he seriously gonna
get away with this?

1791
01:28:04,232 --> 01:28:06,768
Thank you. Gosh, you're kind.

1792
01:28:06,901 --> 01:28:08,703
Give it up for me!

1793
01:28:08,836 --> 01:28:10,171
Wait a second.

1794
01:28:10,305 --> 01:28:11,973
This isn't the meteorite.

1795
01:28:12,106 --> 01:28:13,675
It's a lamp.

1796
01:28:13,808 --> 01:28:14,942
Huh?

1797
01:28:15,076 --> 01:28:16,544
What?

1798
01:28:16,678 --> 01:28:18,846
Snake, what did you just do?

1799
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,682
What? My friend was sad,

1800
01:28:20,815 --> 01:28:21,949
and I was just cheering him up.

1801
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,585
I think Wolf was right.

1802
01:28:23,718 --> 01:28:26,854
Maybe we could be more
than just scary villains.

1803
01:28:30,024 --> 01:28:31,593
I'm bad. You're bad.

1804
01:28:31,726 --> 01:28:33,060
Let's be bad together.

1805
01:28:33,194 --> 01:28:35,430
You've got yourself a deal.

1806
01:28:36,931 --> 01:28:39,801
- Can I try it on?
- Of course, partner.

1807
01:28:54,449 --> 01:28:56,150
Don't mind us.

1808
01:28:56,284 --> 01:28:57,652
Just robbing this place.

1809
01:29:01,956 --> 01:29:03,958
No, no, no!

1810
01:29:07,662 --> 01:29:09,431
But if that's a lamp,
where is the...

1811
01:29:10,698 --> 01:29:11,933
The old switcheroo.

1812
01:29:41,663 --> 01:29:43,431
It's a butt.

1813
01:29:50,204 --> 01:29:51,406
Hold on.

1814
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:53,808
This is the Zumpango diamond.

1815
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:55,743
But this was stolen by the...

1816
01:29:57,379 --> 01:29:59,781
By the Crimson Paw.

1817
01:29:59,914 --> 01:30:01,315
Me? Oh, oh, no, no, no.

1818
01:30:01,449 --> 01:30:03,217
- OMG.
- No, no, no. No, you've got it wrong.

1819
01:30:03,351 --> 01:30:05,186
- And a shocking twist.
- You're making a huge mistake!

1820
01:30:05,319 --> 01:30:08,590
The notorious bandit
known as the Crimson Paw

1821
01:30:08,723 --> 01:30:10,324
- has been revealed to be...
- No! No!

1822
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:11,993
...none other
than Professor Marmalade.

1823
01:30:12,126 --> 01:30:13,361
I'm not the Crimson Paw.

1824
01:30:13,495 --> 01:30:15,129
Sh-She's the Crimson Paw.

1825
01:30:15,262 --> 01:30:16,831
Sh-She's the Paw!

1826
01:30:16,964 --> 01:30:18,966
I'm a flower of goodness. No!

1827
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,168
Ooh! That's my reptile
right there.

1828
01:30:21,302 --> 01:30:23,037
- That's what I'm talking about! All right!
- Yeah!

1829
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:25,306
Come on, somebody had to
destroy that meteorite.

1830
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,274
That thing was dangerous.

1831
01:30:27,409 --> 01:30:29,276
That was pretty good there,
Snakey.

1832
01:30:29,411 --> 01:30:31,646
Good? It was genius.

1833
01:30:31,779 --> 01:30:33,481
Not only did I foil the pig,

1834
01:30:33,615 --> 01:30:36,150
I got you to admit
how much you care about me.

1835
01:30:36,283 --> 01:30:37,552
Sure, yeah.

1836
01:30:37,685 --> 01:30:39,286
I just wonder about
one little thing.

1837
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:40,822
Oh, yeah? What's that, Wolf?

1838
01:30:40,955 --> 01:30:45,159
Who do you think put that
one Push Pop in the fridge?

1839
01:30:46,594 --> 01:30:47,895
Wait.

1840
01:30:48,029 --> 01:30:49,564
You... No.

1841
01:30:49,697 --> 01:30:51,032
I knew you were good.

1842
01:30:51,165 --> 01:30:53,435
No.

1843
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:56,370

It is my birthday.

1862
01:31:44,852 --> 01:31:46,387
Yeah, I know.
So, but we're walking along

1863
01:31:46,521 --> 01:31:47,889
and you meet a genie.

1864
01:31:48,022 --> 01:31:49,356
Okay. What's his name?

1865
01:31:49,491 --> 01:31:50,725
What's the genie's name?

1866
01:31:50,858 --> 01:31:52,359
Yeah, I want to know
who I'm talking to.

1867
01:31:52,494 --> 01:31:53,895
I don't know,
Genie or Gene for short.

1868
01:31:54,028 --> 01:31:55,563
So he offers you three wishes.

1869
01:31:55,697 --> 01:31:56,731
Why three?

1870
01:31:56,864 --> 01:31:57,999
You know, industry standard.

1871
01:31:58,132 --> 01:31:59,400
Now, what do you wish for?

1872
01:31:59,534 --> 01:32:01,168
- Uh...
- Good luck out there, guys.

1873
01:32:01,302 --> 01:32:02,670
I'm gonna go with nothing.

1874
01:32:02,804 --> 01:32:03,971
Nothing?

1875
01:32:04,105 --> 01:32:05,540
Come on, it's your birthday.

1876
01:32:05,673 --> 01:32:07,675
All right,
but what do I need wishes for?

1877
01:32:07,809 --> 01:32:09,243
I got my freedom.

1878
01:32:09,376 --> 01:32:10,311
- Hey.
- Guys!

1879
01:32:10,444 --> 01:32:11,679
Looking good, hermanos.

1880
01:32:11,813 --> 01:32:13,581
- I got my friends.
- Aw.

1881
01:32:13,715 --> 01:32:15,583
I got the skin of a reptile
half my age.

1882
01:32:15,717 --> 01:32:18,019
I don't know about half
your age, but you do look good.

1883
01:32:18,152 --> 01:32:19,487
Well, that's because
you just molted.

1884
01:32:19,621 --> 01:32:21,723
- Yes, I did.
- You smell good, too.

1885
01:32:21,856 --> 01:32:25,292
I'm shiny. I'm gorgeous.

1886
01:32:31,098 --> 01:32:34,068
Uh, so what do we do now?

1887
01:32:34,201 --> 01:32:35,970
- Steal a car?
- Piranha!

1888
01:32:36,103 --> 01:32:37,772
I was joking.

1889
01:32:37,905 --> 01:32:39,240
It was a joke.

1890
01:32:39,373 --> 01:32:40,975
You know,
on second thought, Wolf,

1891
01:32:41,108 --> 01:32:43,144
maybe I'd, uh, wish for a ride.

1892
01:32:43,277 --> 01:32:45,346
Oh, yeah? Alakazam.

1893
01:32:47,615 --> 01:32:48,916
Nice.

1894
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:51,886
Hey, guys. Ready to get to work?

1895
01:32:52,019 --> 01:32:53,187
Hey. Whoa.

1896
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,189
Aw.

1897
01:32:58,025 --> 01:32:59,226
Hey, you.

1898
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,728
That's right. Come here.

1899
01:33:00,862 --> 01:33:01,996
Little closer.

1900
01:33:02,129 --> 01:33:03,698
I said closer.

1901
01:33:03,831 --> 01:33:07,034
Now that we've had some time
to get acquainted, uh,

1902
01:33:07,168 --> 01:33:09,671
not so scary now, are we?

1903
01:33:09,804 --> 01:33:11,172
