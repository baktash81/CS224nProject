00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:34,825
Oh my dear, I'm so lonely

3
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:41,168
Hurry back, hurry back

00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:46,675
Oh my love, hurry back, I'm yours

Hurry home, hurry home

00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:09,777
Won't you please hurry home
to my heart?

9
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,031
My darlin'

10
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,876
lfl hurt you I'm sorry

11
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:28,137
Forgive me

12

Return to me

14

Please come back, bella mia

Hurry back, hurry home

16
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:56,162
To my arms, to my lips, to my heart

17
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,069
Shame we've got to put roofs on 'em.

18
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:29,612
All right, Bill, I'm goin' home.
See you, buddy.

19
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:42,711
Solo tu, solo tu,
solo tu, solo tu, mio cuor

20
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:49,005
- See you, Big Mike.
- Hey, Bob. Have fun tonight.

21
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:51,550
As always!

22
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,953
So this is what I'm gonna say -
I'm gonna get up on the podium

23
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:28,246
and I'm gonna say,
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."

24
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:31,716
"Tonight I'm speaking on behalf
of my friend Sydney..."

25
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:35,842
And, um... Sydney, I'm really nervous.

26
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:38,429
- But do you care?
- Liz?

27
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,641
I knew I'd find you here.

28
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,523
Sydney, how you doin', brother?

29
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:47,480
I need your signature here
so I can change the polar bear's diet.

30
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:51,816
It's already five. I'll check the calf.
Just go home and get ready, OK?

31
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:56,444
Thanks. Bob's picking up my dress, I have
stockings, I have to take Mel for a run.

32
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:59,151
My hair, make-up... God, I'm so nervous!

33
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:05,042
You'll be fine. At the worst you forget your
speech and we don't get any donations.

34
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:08,420
- Don't even say that.
- Just kiddin'.

35
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:13,340
Oh, look at him, Charlie.
We'd go nuts in a place this small.

36
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:16,470
I know. But we're workin' on it.

37
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,555
Wish me luck, Sydney.

38
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,844
He only does that with you.

39
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,518
- Who are you bringing tonight?
- Haven't decided. Still got two hours.

40
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:50,291
Don't shake.

41
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,332
No, no, no, don't!

42
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:55,670
Oh, wet dog.
Come on, let's do it. Wet doggie!

43
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,224
Good boy! You hungry? Let's eat.

44
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,939
Let's go, Mel. She'll be home any minute.

45
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:13,729
Come on. Come on and eat. Let's eat.

46
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:16,611
Ooh, this looks good!

47
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:23,367
Go get some dinner. Come on, come on!

48
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:26,908
Dinner! Come on!

49
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,831
All right, she'll be home in a minute.

50
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:38,219
- Hi, my baby!
- Hey, babe.

51
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:41,383
Hey, honey! It's pouring out.

52
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:46,052
- Did you get my dress?
- Yeah, picked it up from the cleaners.

53
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,269
We're on schedule.

54
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:50,770
Mel, I'm so nervous.

55
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,145
I took Mel out.

56
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,729
In your tux?
Honey, your pants are soaked.

57
00:05:56,864 --> 00:06:00,031
- Tell Mel to eat.
- Mel, eat!

58
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:08,907
You are cute!

59
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:14,455
Spend all day with an ape,
what do you expect?

60
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,840
Under our care at Lincoln Park Zoo

61
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:30,183
Sydney has regained his strength
and maintained excellent health.

62
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:38,694
Over the years Sydney has become
a part ofthe family.

63
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,649
Here he is with my husband.

64
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,941
My husband's the one on the right.

65
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:49,195
With the generous donations
we've received tonight,

66
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:53,877
along with continued
fund-raising, hint hint,

67
00:06:54,004 --> 00:07:00,374
I hope - we hope - to expand
the gorilla habitat to triple its size.

68
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:07,473
Thank you all for your tremendous
support, and enjoy the evening.

69
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,853
Elizabeth Rueland.
Thank you, Dr Rueland.

70
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:16,308
Let's hear it for the doctor.

71
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:21,568
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mr Joey Gian!

72
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,406
Good evening.

73
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:28,161
Speaking ofanimals, the band and I
have worked up something special.

74
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:30,328
So let's get this party started.

75
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:48,344
ln the village, the peaceful village,
the lion sleeps tonight

76
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:54,643
ln the village, the quiet village,
the lion sleeps tonight

77
00:07:55,565 --> 00:08:00,607
Wimoweh, wimoweh,
wimoweh, wimoweh

78
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,904
"What do you expect most
from a relationship?"

79
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:12,864
"A) Companionship,
B) Sex or C) Respect?"

80
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:17,460
I'd go with B, but let's put C so we get
a higher score. What do you think?

81
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:19,414
I think...

82
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:24,627
What do you need? ls it your neck?
I'll move the pillow.

83
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:28,014
Your back? I can raise you up.

84
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:31,175
Rosebud.

85
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:37,636
Very funny. You almost gave me
a heart attack - excuse the expression.

86
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,725
Meg, you can go home.

87
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,696
To what? My cable's out.

88
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:46,609
Joe and the kids.

89
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:48,284
They're OK.

90
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,158
It's good for him to be with them when
they're comin' down from the sugar.

91
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:56,156
He usually fuels them up
and then they detox on my shift.

92
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:58,866
Well, you've seen it!

93
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,500
Promise me
you'll take care of my grandpa.

94
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:04,708
What's got you talkin' like that?

95
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:09,962
I may never get a heart. You know?

96
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:14,050
I know you'll get one. I know.

97
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,395
You'll be able to do things you were
never able to. Concentrate on that.

98
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:22,359
Think about it, Grace.
Picture ridin' a bike.

99
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:24,478
Yeah, ridin' a bike.

100
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:28,985
That's what you need to think about.
Travelling, painting in Europe

101
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:33,245
and dating handsome men!
It's got to happen to one of us.

102
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,944
I'm getting a new heart, not a new ass.

103
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:44,462
Bob!

104
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:47,129
Bob... excuse me... Bob Rueland!

105
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:52,294
Mr Bennington. I didn't see you
or I would have stopped and said hello.

106
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:55,717
- Elizabeth's speech was wonderful.
- I'll go tell her that.

107
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:59,980
I suppose she told you about
our sizeable donation?

108
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,724
- My... Mrs...
- Mrs Bennington?

109
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,815
My wife gave, you know...
strictly anonymously.

110
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,823
Of course. Very generous.
I'll let Elizabeth know.

111
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:15,987
We also gave a chunk to the rainforest.
And before I knew it, I was on a safari!

112
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:19,746
Can you imagine me on safari, Bob?

113
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:21,579
No, I cannot.

114
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:25,329
I was. Me and the missus,
hackin' through the bush.

115
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:30,376
- Charlie?
- Hey, Bob! Mr Bennington!

116
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:34,888
Charlie, did you hear about
my sizeable donation?

117
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:37,933
The anonymous one. Yes, I have.

118
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:44,726
- She loves this song.
- Apparently.

119
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:48,810
- We don't want keep you, so...
- Stay, I'm going to put on more lipstick.

120
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:50,690
Is that possible?

121
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:55,238
- I'll go with you.
- To the ladies' room?

122
00:10:55,369 --> 00:11:00,446
You got big news for Mr B, don't you?
Mr B, Charlie's got big news for you.

123
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,741
- What news?
- What are you...?

124
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:07,040
Because of that donation, they'll hang
a picture of you in the monkey house.

125
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,007
- I'm touched.
- It's an honour.

126
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:15,963
It's not official - I have to run it by
a couple of guys. I can do that right now.

127
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:19,467
You two have a lot to discuss.
So why don't you just stay and...?

128
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:23,469
Listen, Charlie,
would you ever consider

129
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:26,607
- a mural, maybe?
- A mural.

130
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:36,107
We love it there. My mother's family
is from Tuscany so it's like going home.

131
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:38,529
That's so sweet.

132
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:43,324
You must come out some time. Our place
is at the edge of a magnificent vineyard.

133
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,958
Everything's at the edge of a vineyard.
It's Tuscany.

134
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:50,625
- Mrs Rueland.
- Hey, stranger.

135
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:53,712
Honey, you remember Celia and Tony.

136
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:56,798
We were telling Elizabeth
about our place in ltaly.

137
00:11:56,931 --> 00:12:01,925
- We meant to go on our honeymoon.
- Sydney wouldn't have stood the flight.

138
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:04,896
I promise you we'll go to ltaly - eventually.

139
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:07,893
That's big.
If that's a promise, I'll take that.

140
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:12,236
- Where are you vacationing this year?
- We're going to a water theme park.

141
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,690
That'll be nice.

142
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:18,025
It's a joke, Celia.

143
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:24,122
I promised my wife that we'd dance
tonight, Tony, so if you'll excuse us...

144
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:26,823
- Certainly.
- It was wonderful to see you both.

145
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:28,289
Good night.

146
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:33,417
It's a little crowded out here right now.
Let's wait for the next song.

147
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,923
So really... how was l?

148
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:41,137
You were perfect. With the backlighting
you could see right through your dress.

149
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:46,016
No, you were wonderful. Really.
I'm so proud of you.

150
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:51,733
Don't be too proud. Poor Sydney's
still stuck in that small space.

151
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,273
Tell you what. If you promise you'll take
time off for a trip to ltaly with me

152
00:12:56,407 --> 00:13:01,531
I promise to build Sydney a new home,
with or without the rest of the funding.

153
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,497
Deal.

154
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:19,045
Come on. You can stand on my feet.

155
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:22,631
Return to me

156
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,892
Oh my dear, I'm so lonely

157
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:34,856
Hurry home, hurry home

158
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:40,740
Won't you please hurry
home to my heart

159
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:47,161
My darling

160
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:52,371
lfl hurt you I'm sorry

161
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:58,049
Forgive me

162
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:03,594
And please say you're mine

163
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:07,602
Return to me

164
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,724
We got a female, 34, car accident.
Hit on the right side.

165
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:14,941
Head trauma, unconscious
at the scene, never regained.

166
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:21,780
Get Westfall into scrub.

167
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:23,568
- Name?
- Any allergies?

168
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:25,244
Sir? Her name.

169
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:28,495
- Sir?
- Eli-Elizabeth Rueland.

170
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:31,245
Sorry, sir. You can't go in.

171
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:33,369
You're going to have to wait here.

172
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:35,626
We're going to try to help her.

173
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,917
Return to me

174
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:48,594
Cara mia, ti amo

175
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:57,066
Solo tu, solo tu, solo tu, solo tu

176
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:03,315
Mi' amor

177
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:09,073
- Andiamo. Get that while it's hot.
- I got it, Marty.

178
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:14,247
- Aah, sure I'll get it myself.
- Suit yourself, baby.

179
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:17,832
Where's Sophie?

180
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:22,425
She got a perm today. Her scalp is
still burning. She went home early.

181
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:26,253
Oh, of course she did. Why did I ask?

182
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:31,596
Will you go find yourself a gondola?

183
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:41,438
Pick up.

184
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:44,812
Now then, Nancy darlin'...

185
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:48,368
It looks massive but you'll get through it.

186
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:49,693
Thank you.

187
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,118
Marty, how is Gracie doing?

188
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:56,957
Oh, fine, you know.
We... we're all waiting.

189
00:15:57,086 --> 00:16:00,538
- Are you still keeping up the rosary?
- Every night.

190
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:04,541
- Give her our love.
- Oh, I will, of course. Of course I will.

191
00:16:07,597 --> 00:16:10,800
I can do that.
Where are the three chicken Vesuvios?

192
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:15,595
- Already served them, Marty.
- Thank you very much. Grazie.

193
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:30,451
Oh, you've got it, haven't you?

194
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:34,243
You have? Thanks be to God
and all the saints in heaven!

195
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,366
Let me talk to her.

196
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:39,205
I'll be right over. Here's Angelo now.

197
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,828
Call everybody up now!

198
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:43,874
You got a heart, huh?

199
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,898
What, like an hour into it?

200
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:08,986
Someone will come out
and tell you intermittently. Excuse me.

201
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,527
He's here.

202
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,329
- You're here.
- Isn't she beautiful?

203
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:18,036
Grandpa, thank you for
always taking care of me.

204
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:22,211
And if I don't come out...

205
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,581
I love you so much.

206
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:30,549
You've got to come out.
If those tulips you planted come up

207
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,057
and see only me standin' there,
they'll go back into the ground again.

208
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:38,804
Thanks. Give me a kiss.

209
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:43,690
OK, folks.

210
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,570
- Here we go.
- Pray, Grandpa.

211
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:50,607
We'll take good care of her.

212
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:53,279
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

213
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:12,967
I got to walk Mel.

214
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,681
I left the hospital a few hours ago.
I came by and took him to the park.

215
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,472
OK.

216
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:23,349
Thanks.

217
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:38,902
- I'm gonna stay.
- No.

218
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:47,962
I'll pick your parents up
from the airport in the morning.

219
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:52,629
Thanks.

220
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:55,301
OK.

221
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:09,102
If you need anything, you call me.
I'll be here in two minutes.

222
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:13,858
Thank you, Charlie.

223
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,188
She's not coming home, Mel.

224
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,633
Blessed Michael the Archangel,
who protects in battle,

225
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:04,215
and this is the greatest
battle of our lives...

226
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,772
My wife never thought much of you
but you were always my favourite saint.

227
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:12,649
Cos you're a battler,
you're a fighter. Well,

228
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:15,527
fight for us now, Michael. Fight for us.

229
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:18,857
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.

230
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,944
Adam Martin Dayton, what is that?

231
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:23,452
Cherry pop.

232
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:26,151
- Sophie, did you give him wine?
- Angelo...

233
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:28,578
Angelo, what are you doin' to me?

234
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,914
- It's... tranquilliser.
- Great(!)

235
00:21:31,044 --> 00:21:33,535
So sue me.
Now they're drunk and disorderly.

236
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:37,335
Is that funny, Dad?

237
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:40,503
Stop it right now, both of you. Joe!

238
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:43,848
- Joe...
- What?

239
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:47,888
Help me out. Take the kids
to your mom's. It's one in the morning.

240
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,886
- Here, Emmett. Nourish yourself.
- Thank you.

241
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:53,434
Could I have milk?

242
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:56,982
Tyler, I want all your brothers up here.

243
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:01,273
I'll only buy more.

244
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:04,194
- Let's go.
- I wanna stay and see the new heart.

245
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:06,865
You'll see it when it comes home.
Come on.

246
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:11,532
No stopping anywhere.
You come straight back here.

247
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,040
- I'll stop at a lap-dancing bar.
- That's funny(!)

248
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,125
- Where's Marty?
- Dad, where's Marty?

249
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,130
In the chapel, honey.

250
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,246
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

251
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:40,138
Want me to shuffle for you?

252
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:44,725
- Want to ante a quarter?
- Yes. I do.

253
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:50,991
This guy you're talkin' about,
he can't sing at all.

254
00:24:51,118 --> 00:24:55,661
- How come he's got such a big band?
- To drown him out.

255
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:57,948
Wally, stay out of this.

256
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,752
How many famous
Polish singers are there?

257
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:02,917
I got two words for you: Bobby Vinton.

258
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:06,296
Bobby Vinton?!
Bobby Vinton, Bobby Vinton!

259
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:09,750
Well, what have you got?
The lrish Rovers?

260
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,468
I got three words for you.

261
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:15,303
Mr Bing Crosby.

262
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:17,557
He made a lovely priest.

263
00:25:17,686 --> 00:25:19,725
But he beat the hell out of his kids.

264
00:25:19,855 --> 00:25:23,438
Doesn't mean he couldn't sing.
Sinatra beat up everybody.

265
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:26,484
Frank did not.
His people did, he did not.

266
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,154
Look at Dean Martin.

267
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,069
The guy never hit anybody.

268
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:34,280
What about Jerry?
But he was askin' for it.

269
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:38,574
The point is: we got Frank,
we got Dean, we got Perry Como,

270
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:40,746
Vic Damone, Bobby Darin,

271
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:43,788
Mario Lanza, Luciano Pavarotti,

272
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,336
we got Beniamino Gigli,
we got the composers!

273
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:50,082
Verdi, Leoncavallo!

274
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:53,385
- Millions.
- That's right. A dynasty.

275
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:57,760
- I'm not bragging, but...
- You're not?

276
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:01,931
You're not bragging?

277
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:07,059
Christ, he goes on for a half hour.

278
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:11,607
Oh, come on.

279
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,152
- I'll take you to the doctor in my Caddy.
- No thanks, I'll take my bike.

280
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:19,370
- Let him take you. Suppose it rains?
- Then I'll get wet.

281
00:26:19,497 --> 00:26:21,122
Then you'll be sick.

282
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:24,286
Gracie, settle this:
best male singer, dead?

283
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:25,415
Dean Martin.

284
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:27,123
- Frank!
- Bing.

285
00:26:27,255 --> 00:26:29,295
Bobby Vinton!

286
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:36,430
Now, go straight to your appointment,
then you go to meet Megan.

287
00:26:36,556 --> 00:26:39,391
If your plans change, telephone me.

288
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:43,218
I may stop off at the Pussycat Club.
One of their strippers quit.

289
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:47,103
Don't say strippers.
God's listening to you.

290
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:49,641
It's been over a year.
You can hardly see it.

291
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:53,692
Nice try, Angelo.
I just don't like all the questions.

292
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:56,943
Tell everybody you're
the luckiest girl in the world.

293
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:58,322
I know, Grandpa.

294
00:26:59,037 --> 00:27:03,746
You're beautiful - and no one's
going to notice your chest.

295
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,251
Thanks a lot(!)

296
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:11,079
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, Grace!

297
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:13,255
Ride on the sidewalk, now.

298
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:14,962
Leave her alone.

299
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:17,217
Stop in at the church as you go by.

300
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:20,348
She's thanked God enough already.

301
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:23,301
You're going to be
a long while in purgatory.

302
00:27:23,436 --> 00:27:25,595
Really? Well, I'll be with friends.

303
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:30,516
God's listening to that.

304
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:03,558
All right, guys...

305
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,060
Now, out of respect we gotta give
honourable mention to Sammy Davis Jr.

306
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:14,359
He only had one eye, so...
what else can I tell ya?

307
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:18,401
- He was lrish, you know.
- Are you blind? He was Jewish.

308
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:21,071
Whatever. Somethin' didn't fit.

309
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:24,821
This is hard for him.

310
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:28,823
Everyone he's ever loved has died.
I'm all he has, he's all I have.

311
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:31,662
- Morning, Grace.
- Hey, Alice.

312
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:35,710
Everything's looking very good.
How are you feeling?

313
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:39,791
- Good. Happy. Of course I'm happy.
- Good.

314
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:45,264
- What else am I gonna be?
- Well, we all have our days.

315
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,096
Add those to your morning meds.

316
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:52,140
98.6.

317
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:57,270
I don't feel like I should have "days".

318
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:01,482
I should be happy
just to be alive - and I am.

319
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:06,449
I'm alive cos someone else is dead.

320
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:11,580
I should just shut up and be happy, right?

321
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,040
Mm-hm.

322
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,998
You can get dressed. See you next month.
Say hi to your grandfather.

323
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:21,418
He's a great listener(!)

324
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:24,515
- What, honey?
- Nothing.

325
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,598
Tom, what the hell is goin' on?

326
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,183
- It's not my department.
- Whose is it?

327
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:34,647
- My guys worked 18 hours.
- At time and a half. I'm cryin' for ya(!)

328
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:37,562
- You got the best guys here.
- I don't give a shit.

329
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,619
I got to take a break.

330
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:57,663
You're on Wabash at 3 o'clock -
new beams goin' in.

331
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:02,465
Keep up.

332
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:10,512
- Mail it, Grace. You'll feel better.
- I know. I want to.

333
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:13,811
Every time I go to do it, l... I can't.

334
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:17,106
I don't know why not. It's anonymous.

335
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:22,821
It says you're grateful. I'd want to get
it if I lost someone I loved. Wouldn't you?

336
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:26,198
Yeah, but... it just seems so strange.

337
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:31,116
Sending a thank-you note for a heart.

338
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,701
It seems so...

339
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,250
..not enough.

340
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:43,039
- Won't you feel worse not sending it?
- Yeah. I mean, I always have it.

341
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:47,885
And it's been a year, so drop it in
and move on. I'm sure they have.

342
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,433
Yeah.

343
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:08,314
Let it go.

344
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:18,623
Everybody clap for Auntie Grace.
She just mailed a very important letter.

345
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:31,922
- Mom, look at the cool truck!
- Yeah. Oh, look at that.

346
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,719
- Look at their arms.
- Yeah. Wow!

347
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:39,013
OK, come on - gorillas.

348
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,255
Karson, your pants are falling down.

349
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,885
These are Adam's. He has your pants on.

350
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:13,256
That's all right. Come on, Laura.

351
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:18,680
Laura, stay in front of Mommy
all the time while we're here.

352
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,737
Aunt Grace, are you OK?

353
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:35,488
Yeah. Whatever it was, it didn't hurt.

354
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:41,450
Let's try it.
See if we can get him to come over.

355
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,167
- "H"...
- Here he comes!

356
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,505
Look, Mom, he likes us.

357
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:50,465
- Doesn't he remind you of Daddy?
- He looks bigger than Daddy.

358
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,382
- Do you see?
- That's kinda sweet.

359
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:05,979
Bob, don't go in there.
I just talked to 'em!

360
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,604
OK, guys, here's the deal.

361
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:13,819
My wife wanted this building up
years ago, so we're way behind schedule.

362
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:18,115
First of all, you:
artificial trees are not planted.

363
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:22,032
I'm asking for an additional 50 feet
to build aroundthe existing oaks.

364
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:26,118
And I will leave plenty of room
for your godforsaken souvenir shop.

365
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:31,297
If you don't approve, I'm taking my men
and it's over. I don't need the work

366
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:36,255
and I'm certainly not here for the money.
I'm here because of my wife.

367
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,182
Have you got it?

368
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,476
Good.

369
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,902
Thanks for yellin' and screamin'.
Now I gotta go in and clean everything up.

370
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:56,029
You want to get a drink?
Somethin' to shake this off?

371
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,078
- Come on! Let's go get a beer.
- Thanks, Charlie. No.

372
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:03,452
Well, if not tonight, Friday night.
Because I got somebody for you.

373
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,960
Charlie, no.

374
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:09,214
She's got a great body:
attorney, great body, intelligent...

375
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,049
You gotta start goin' out! She loves
animals - her cat was a patient of mine.

376
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,135
I'm a dog person.

377
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,590
I'm just trying to help you.

378
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:36,533
- Dan, you got 'em!
- It's the first time I'm wearing 'em.

379
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,901
- You look good.
- Feelin' good.

380
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:41,574
- Need some help?
- I think I'll be OK.

381
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:43,330
Look at you!

382
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,542
- Where are you goin'?
- I don't know.

383
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:51,122
Thanks. I took Mel out.

384
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,712
Put the mail next to the phone.
On the pile.

385
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:56,713
Thanks, buddy. See you later.

386
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,475
Come on, Mel.

387
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:07,018
Any calls?

388
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,683
You have no messages.

389
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,396
Wanna eat?

390
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,174
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr Rueland.

391
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,763
Hey, Mel!

392
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,846
- There you go.
- Thanks. See you tomorrow night.

393
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,885
- Yeah.
- Bye. Bye, Mel!

394
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,857
Come on. In the kitchen.

395
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,774
I got you some rice.

396
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,535
Here we go.

397
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,662
You're gonna eat in here today.

398
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,374
Good.

399
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,576
Come on. Come on.

400
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:18,756
I'm not doin' this any more.
We're goin' back to eatin' in the kitchen.

401
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:23,464
Goddammit, Mel, come on back here and
eat in the kitchen like a normal person!

402
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,147
Good boy, good boy. Come on, let's go.

403
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:43,865
To the kitchen. Let's go.
That's it. Follow me.

404
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,790
There's a good boy.

405
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:58,540
Good boy. You made it halfway.

406
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,254
You gotta snap out of it, buddy.

407
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,406
Charlie, it's Bob.

408
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,861
I'm gonna go out with you
on Friday, all right?

409
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,237
Yeah, you heard me.

410
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,581
Where?

411
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,075
O'Reilly's?

412
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,161
O'Reilly's ltalian restaurant?

413
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,549
OK.

414
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,210
Where is that?

415
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,481
Ah, Marie

416
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:03,986
Ah, Marie!

417
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,950
Big finish, Grandpa!

418
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,656
I'm still trying to get them
to play "Danny Boy".

419
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:25,007
All right, I got a chicken Vesuvio and
a corned beef and cabbage - no butter.

420
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,928
All right, darlin'.

421
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,297
Now... don't eat that.

422
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,977
Oh, my God!

423
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,151
Save it for the ltalians.
I know you love me.

424
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,484
Can we afford it?

425
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,696
Angelo says a true artist
must paint in the Pissa Navona.

426
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,702
Piazza Navona!

427
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:59,579
- You know, l... I could go over with you.
- Sure, yeah.

428
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:04,500
- Marty, let her go alone.
- Or... you wouldn't have to go at all...

429
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,215
- She'll be fine.
- I'm gonna go.

430
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,177
She's never before been on an aeroplane
and Rome is far away.

431
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:15,768
- She'll be fine. You paid for the ticket.
- We'll discuss it later on.

432
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:20,225
- Ange. Two more, hon.
- Sophie, he gave her the ticket!

433
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,730
You couldn't wait till I was here?

434
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,479
She had the same look on her face then
as she has now. Show her.

435
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,823
I miss everything!

436
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,320
Well, the customers out there
are missing you, so...

437
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,280
Can I at least look at it?

438
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,074
Here, look.

439
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,499
Don't touch it!

440
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,494
- Look how much it cost.
- It's so beautiful!

441
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,628
- You deserve it, sweetie.
- She does indeed.

442
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,342
- Oh, well. All right, let's go.
- Thank you.

443
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,263
All right, back to work.

444
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,389
Thank you, Grandpa.

445
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,678
Angelo, thank you!

446
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,935
How did you talk him into it?

447
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,982
My goodness! I'm so proud of him.

448
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,525
He loves you so much,
he's like an ltalian mamma!

449
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,988
I can't wait to tell Megan.
She's gonna flip out.

450
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,903
I got another surprise for you.

451
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,695
- He is here.
- Who's he?

452
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:19,082
The guy I was telling you about.
He's at the bar, waitin' to meet you.

453
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:23,704
- Oh, Angelo...
- Don't worry. I told him everything.

454
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,503
- I told him you had your chest worked on.
- What?!

455
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,171
- Angelo, he's gonna think I had a...
- What?

456
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,548
Whatever.

457
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:37,053
It doesn't matter. He's a terrific guy.
In fact, he had a transplant too.

458
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,473
Coraggio - go on.

459
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,519
My doctors -
they say it's a solid transplant.

460
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,069
Look how natural it looks.
Go ahead, give it a tug.

461
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,533
- No, that's OK.
- Oh, come on, give her a tug!

462
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,880
Good evening, sir.

463
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:13,046
- Are you staying or leaving or what?
- I'm staying.

464
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,802
Thank you very much.

465
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,645
Bob!

466
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,870
My man, Bobby!

467
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,664
This is Marsha.

468
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,502
- Come on!
- I have bacon fat on my hands.

469
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:57,008
It's OK. I can wash it, shower in it, swim.
Come on, give it a good pull!

470
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,677
- I don't want to hurt you.
- It's OK! I'm fine.

471
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,848
- OK.
- Ow, ow!

472
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,227
- You picked a soft spot.
- Sorry.

473
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,610
Gracie, mind the four-top
over there, will you?

474
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,101
Yeah, I will.

475
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:15,397
OK, well, it was really nice to meet you.

476
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:18,367
- Good luck... with your hair.
- Thank you.

477
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,580
Hey, Patrick. Wanna grab on
with two hands and run for the door?

478
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:30,003
- No, Ralph. I don't touch men.
- It's women's hair.

479
00:42:31,256 --> 00:42:34,756
And then I said, "It's Squeaker, my kitty!"

480
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:43,549
Everyone was laughing! Ah-ha-ha! Oh!

481
00:42:43,685 --> 00:42:46,520
That's when I met Charlie.
He was the only vet open.

482
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,229
- Funny story.
- Where are the menus? What's going on?

483
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,766
Squeaker won't let
another vet touch him.

484
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,770
Yeah, well, I better not hear about
anybody else touching your squeaker.

485
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,202
I didn't mean to say that.

486
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:09,661
- I really like this place. It's nice.
- Oh, well, if you like this kind of place.

487
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,630
Everything here is good.
That's the beauty of it.

488
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:17,881
Oh my gosh, look at us, matchy green.
"Matchy matchy green squared!"

489
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,088
I'll take care of that.

490
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,381
Thank you very much.

491
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,345
Could you hang this up behind you?

492
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,555
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

493
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:33,390
So, Rob, Charlie tells me
you work at the zoo.

494
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:37,987
Wait a minute - he doesn't work there.
Bob is there building. Bob's a builder.

495
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,688
The new building on State Street? Bob's.

496
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:43,776
- You own it?
- No. No, I designed it.

497
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,537
Oh.

498
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,622
Good evening.

499
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,499
No, no, no. Do you have bottled water?

500
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,373
Sure. Anyone else?

501
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,127
- May I have a wine list?
- Sure.

502
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,666
Do we know each other?

503
00:44:01,346 --> 00:44:04,098
I think so. Have you been in here before?

504
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:08,637
- I'd remember an lrish-ltalian restaurant.
- Yeah, you would.

505
00:44:09,312 --> 00:44:13,310
Oh, my God - blah, blah, blah. My water?

506
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:17,356
I don't want Swiss water.
I got sick on that once, remember?

507
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:20,654
Ach, that was awful. That was so bad.

508
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:24,614
As long as it's not Swiss or tap water.
Preferably French, no bubbles.

509
00:44:24,744 --> 00:44:28,362
I want it cold - no ice, no glass,
just the bottle and a straw.

510
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:32,202
Do you want to write it down?
I don't want Swiss water...

511
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:35,873
I'm pretty sure I got it.

512
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:38,332
I'm sorry. Can I get a coffee?

513
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:41,124
- Sure.
- No straw.

514
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,632
- I hate when they don't write it down.
- It will be wrong.

515
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:48,474
Maybe she'll get it right.

516
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:51,139
It's not gonna happen.

517
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,098
Nope, not me.

518
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:54,690
- Not me.
- No.

519
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:57,516
I think your ass is ringing.

520
00:45:00,446 --> 00:45:02,273
I usually don't bring it.

521
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:04,031
Rueland.

522
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,026
Mike! Excuse me, I gotta take this.

523
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:09,657
What do you think?

524
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:12,458
Patrick, can you gimme an Aquafina?

525
00:45:19,674 --> 00:45:25,214
That's good, Mike. The welder can work
four days for us and one day at the zoo.

526
00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:28,513
Either way they get paid
under the original contract.

527
00:45:28,641 --> 00:45:30,219
Who else is on the clock?

528
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:39,235
Um... no, no, that sounds good.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

529
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,567
Hold on! Can you call me back in three
minutes and whatever I say, disregard it?

530
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:45,778
Thanks.

531
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:49,075
So the old man goes,
"How many times I gotta tell you,

532
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:51,659
I don't want no brown bananas?"

533
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,039
- Wine lists.
- That's a good one.

534
00:45:57,962 --> 00:46:01,331
- I bet that's refreshing.
- Such a difference!

535
00:46:01,466 --> 00:46:03,043
- Yes.
- There you go.

536
00:46:03,176 --> 00:46:04,753
It's about time.

537
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:08,634
I'm doing a new food combination,
so I don't need something...

538
00:46:08,764 --> 00:46:12,180
- Our specials are chicken Vesuvio...
- Please!

539
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,887
I'm around them all day.

540
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:19,307
I didn't mean to...

541
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:21,684
I'm a vet. You know?

542
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:27,276
And a corned beef and cabbage soufflé
and a spinach ravioli, my favourite.

543
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:30,243
- I'll have that.
- That sounds so fattening.

544
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:34,201
- Well, just order something else.
- Is every dish here cooked in oil?

545
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:37,202
No. Some we boil in Swiss water.

546
00:46:40,504 --> 00:46:43,256
- We're gonna need another minute.
- OK.

547
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:47,875
- We should get that smartass fired.
- She's fine.

548
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:51,345
No, that is not fine. That was uncalled-for.

549
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:57,309
- Get out of the way, Patrick.
- We're getting compliments on the pasta.

550
00:46:57,438 --> 00:47:01,056
Why wouldn't we?
Angelo's the best ltalian chef in Chicago.

551
00:47:01,192 --> 00:47:04,525
Angelo! Three more shepherd's pies,
if you please.

552
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:07,275
Oh, that's me. That's mine.

553
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:09,946
Rueland. Hey, Mike.

554
00:47:10,242 --> 00:47:12,282
I'm just havin' dinner.

555
00:47:12,411 --> 00:47:15,578
No. No, that's not a problem.

556
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:19,122
If I have to be there I have to be there.
See you in five minutes.

557
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,452
- Where?
- The Wabash building.

558
00:47:21,587 --> 00:47:24,790
- They're working on a Friday night?
- Can you believe that?

559
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:27,379
- No.
- It's an emergency. I gotta be there.

560
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,380
- It was nice to meet you, Marla.
- Marsha.

561
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:32,386
- And Shari?
- Yeah, that's it.

562
00:47:32,515 --> 00:47:36,678
I apologise, and... have fun.

563
00:47:37,436 --> 00:47:39,144
Bye.

564
00:47:45,444 --> 00:47:50,023
- Is everything OK?
- Oh, yeah. Fine. I just got called to work.

565
00:47:50,157 --> 00:47:53,324
Oh, OK. Are your girlfriend
and friends staying?

566
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:58,577
God, that's not my girlfriend. It's not
even a friend. Not an acquaintance either.

567
00:47:58,707 --> 00:48:01,578
Yes. They will be staying.

568
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:05,205
Oh. Hang on a second.

569
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:09,835
- Soph, what is that?
- Ravioli and a side cabbage for pickup.

570
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:13,883
Here you go, Mr... Atsuki.

571
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:18,095
It's... on the house.

572
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:20,137
Come back again.

573
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,139
Thank you.

574
00:48:31,156 --> 00:48:33,232
Ticket, sir? Thank you, sir.

575
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:39,278
Buona sera, signorina, buona sera

576
00:48:39,414 --> 00:48:43,364
It is time to say good night to Napoli

577
00:48:43,502 --> 00:48:47,202
Though it's hard for me
to whisper buona sera

578
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:50,375
With that old moon above
and the Mediterranean sea

579
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:53,545
- What are you doin'?
- I got a call. I gotta go.

580
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:56,798
- You're already out. It's Friday night.
- I know.

581
00:48:56,932 --> 00:49:00,135
Drink some wine. Enjoy the evening.

582
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:02,475
I can't. I gotta go to work. I'm sorry.

583
00:49:02,604 --> 00:49:05,273
- Thank you.
- I know you're goin' home.

584
00:49:05,399 --> 00:49:08,186
I'm not goin' home. I gotta go to work.

585
00:49:09,569 --> 00:49:11,609
Yeah, yeah, right(!)

586
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,476
- Grace? Umbrella.
- Oh. Thanks.

587
00:51:09,564 --> 00:51:11,806
Another set of keys. Oh...

588
00:51:11,941 --> 00:51:16,603
I found this phone on the bar earlier.
Nice, huh?

589
00:51:19,073 --> 00:51:22,774
Buona sera, signorina

590
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:27,537
Kiss me good night

591
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:33,076
Bob.

592
00:51:33,212 --> 00:51:37,293
According to these plans...
are we only enclosing the one oak tree?

593
00:51:37,425 --> 00:51:41,754
No, I got a newer set of plans in my office.
We'll work Saturdays.

594
00:51:41,888 --> 00:51:45,672
- We are working Saturdays!
- I'll get the new set of plans.

595
00:51:45,808 --> 00:51:50,387
I'll take this home. My kids love
colouring between the lines on these.

596
00:51:54,442 --> 00:51:58,938
- Hey, Bob, could I see the new plans?
- Yeah. Sure. Right here.

597
00:52:01,783 --> 00:52:04,452
- These'll be the last set, right?
- Yes.

598
00:52:04,577 --> 00:52:05,952
Oh, yeah.

599
00:52:06,078 --> 00:52:08,451
Did anybody call back about my phone?

600
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:10,823
Oh, yeah, the restaurant. They have it.

601
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:12,998
- Who called?
- The restaurant.

602
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:16,461
- No, l... who from the restaurant?
- I don't know. Some woman.

603
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:19,341
- Young or old?
- I don't know!

604
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:23,085
- I'll send one of the guys to go get it.
- No, I'll swing by there later.

605
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:28,301
That's cute.

606
00:52:28,434 --> 00:52:31,352
Will you stop with the piano?

607
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:33,270
I'll go in the fall.

608
00:52:33,439 --> 00:52:35,895
- Here's the baby pig pen.
- OK.

609
00:52:36,025 --> 00:52:41,861
The mommy has ten baby bottles
coming out of her tummy.

610
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:43,863
That's cute.

611
00:52:43,991 --> 00:52:45,651
Stop with the piano!

612
00:52:46,077 --> 00:52:47,275
Megan!

613
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:50,911
- What? I'm not playing it.
- But you...

614
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,032
What else did you see at the zoo?

615
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:57,461
Then we went to see the gorillas
and mommy said it was you.

616
00:52:57,588 --> 00:52:59,497
Oh, I did not! I did not!

617
00:53:00,299 --> 00:53:03,549
- Did she take you to see the elephants?
- Watch it, Joe!

618
00:53:03,677 --> 00:53:06,548
- Did you change him?
- Yeah, I'm gonna.

619
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,136
Get up and change him.
What have you been doing?

620
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:12,552
- I've been saving lives all day, honey.
- Very funny.

621
00:53:12,686 --> 00:53:15,604
- I'll change him.
- No, Grace, I got it.

622
00:53:15,731 --> 00:53:19,811
- Joe, get up and do it right now.
- I got it, Grace. I'll do it.

623
00:53:24,406 --> 00:53:26,280
- Megan...
- What?!

624
00:53:26,408 --> 00:53:29,362
I invited Rudy over. To meet Grace.

625
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:32,580
Father Rudy?

626
00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:34,616
He's not a priest any more.

627
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:37,995
To me he always will be.
Joe, she'll meet someone on her own.

628
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:40,798
Where? She's here
on every one of her nights off.

629
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:44,796
- He's a nice guy.
- It doesn't matter!

630
00:53:44,927 --> 00:53:47,762
It's not easy to dance
when no one's leading.

631
00:53:47,888 --> 00:53:50,723
Now help me clean up the puzzle!

632
00:53:50,849 --> 00:53:53,423
- Here's the barn. Barn's gone!
- What's goin' on?

633
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,187
Nothing. Joe invited somebody over -
Iike a blind date for you.

634
00:53:58,315 --> 00:53:59,809
- What?!
- It's not a date.

635
00:53:59,942 --> 00:54:03,108
He's comin' over for dinner, that's it.

636
00:54:03,237 --> 00:54:05,313
- I gotta find my scarf.
- Better hurry!

637
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:08,021
- I already told him you've had work done.
- What?!

638
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:09,652
She's not a Buick.

639
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:13,652
He understands, he's OK with it.
He's a priest!

640
00:54:14,123 --> 00:54:15,665
- A priest?
- Yup.

641
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:20,660
An ex-priest. What's the big deal?
He's never dated, you've never dated.

642
00:54:20,796 --> 00:54:23,880
- Grace has dated.
- Who? Chooch Patucci?

643
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:26,296
- I never dated Chooch!
- That's a date?

644
00:54:26,426 --> 00:54:29,214
You dated Chooch Patucci?!

645
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:31,386
Don't say that name in this house.

646
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:34,848
- It's all right, Megan.
- Do you hate priests, Aunt Grace?

647
00:54:34,977 --> 00:54:38,725
- No, honey.
- Cos if you do you'll go straight to hell.

648
00:54:38,856 --> 00:54:40,136
Your mouth!

649
00:54:40,274 --> 00:54:44,982
- That's great, Joe. You taught him "hell".
- I did not. You picked it up from Mom.

650
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:48,481
- I never said "hell", you son of a bitch.
- Just back off.

651
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:51,868
Oh, shit! Father Rudy's here.

652
00:54:52,953 --> 00:54:56,737
- Don't say "shit" in front of the priest.
- Shit! Shit!

653
00:54:56,873 --> 00:55:01,167
Would everyone just calm down,
for the love of God and all that is holy?

654
00:55:01,295 --> 00:55:03,204
Calm the hell down!

655
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,878
Stop playing that.

656
00:55:12,305 --> 00:55:14,879
- Shut that thing off.
- No, no... Dad...!

657
00:55:15,267 --> 00:55:16,975
Good night, Nurse!

658
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:20,015
For Christ's sake, he's just a man!

659
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:27,068
I'm not used to being without it yet, Joe.

660
00:55:29,948 --> 00:55:31,407
Come on in.

661
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:34,859
- There she is.
- Oh, boy!

662
00:55:34,995 --> 00:55:36,370
Dinner, I mean.

663
00:55:36,496 --> 00:55:37,777
Hallelujah!

664
00:55:47,299 --> 00:55:49,920
I'll call my friend and see where he's at.

665
00:56:00,854 --> 00:56:01,968
Bobby!

666
00:56:02,647 --> 00:56:04,106
Where you at?

667
00:56:07,235 --> 00:56:11,280
You ran away last night,
you don't show up tonight...

668
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:14,857
I'm sorry, Charlie,
I'm just not feelin' up to it.

669
00:56:15,535 --> 00:56:18,406
I don't know, maybe somethin' I ate.

670
00:56:18,538 --> 00:56:23,615
I'm just going to... I'm gonna kick back,
take it easy, maybe go to bed early.

671
00:56:23,752 --> 00:56:26,871
- What you doin'?
- Now? Watching the Cubs game.

672
00:56:27,005 --> 00:56:30,041
- What's the score?
- The score? Oh, it's, uh...

673
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:33,961
Uh...

674
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:37,298
It's... the Cubs are losin'.

675
00:56:42,145 --> 00:56:43,425
Mr Rueland?

676
00:56:44,063 --> 00:56:45,143
Dan the man!

677
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:47,598
Bob the slob - just kidding.

678
00:56:47,734 --> 00:56:50,521
Maybe you could clean up the place.

679
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:53,444
I don't think you could afford me.

680
00:56:55,325 --> 00:56:57,033
How do I look?

681
00:56:57,452 --> 00:56:58,566
Tall.

682
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:00,407
Tall.

683
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:02,407
Tall, yeah.

684
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:07,042
Thanks.

685
00:57:10,924 --> 00:57:15,799
Oh, Megan, it was fine.
You know... He was a nice guy.

686
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:19,755
- Well, at least we had a few laughs.
- Yeah, we did.

687
00:57:19,891 --> 00:57:24,600
Did you notice how he was afraid
to even let me lift a plate of potatoes?

688
00:57:24,729 --> 00:57:27,398
No, I think he was just being polite.

689
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:30,942
Mm-hm.

690
00:57:35,531 --> 00:57:39,529
No, but it's like as soon as they know,
they think of me as broken.

691
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:44,239
I think they see you as a kind, loving
woman that's beaten unbeatable odds.

692
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:46,995
- That's the way I see you.
- Urrgghh!

693
00:57:47,752 --> 00:57:49,709
OK, Tyler, come on!

694
00:57:50,755 --> 00:57:54,883
The right guy will know. Trust me.

695
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:59,054
Can't have Joe helping. The way he
describes your surgery'd scare anyone!

696
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,219
Tonight. They're asleep. We can do it!

697
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:02,547
What did he say?

698
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:06,432
He's saying he's sorry about tonight,
so please forgive him.

699
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:09,018
Left. Step up. Good boy.

700
00:58:10,316 --> 00:58:11,596
Daddy!

701
00:58:11,734 --> 00:58:13,774
- Goddammit!
- Oh, dear.

702
00:58:13,903 --> 00:58:16,310
- Goddammit!
- Megan!

703
00:58:17,365 --> 00:58:19,903
I'm right here. Take it easy.

704
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:22,276
- Dad, I want some water.
- You can't have water.

705
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:25,496
- He can have water.
- He'll wet the bed and who'll change it?

706
00:58:25,623 --> 00:58:29,241
- I do, damn it.
- OK, potty mouth's gonna change it.

707
00:58:29,377 --> 00:58:32,746
Come on, honey, get up there.
You're going to sleep - for ever!

708
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,589
- Stop, it'll be in their heads all night.
- I'll put something in their heads!

709
00:58:39,345 --> 00:58:42,714
- Dad, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to put Mom to bed too.

710
00:58:45,768 --> 00:58:50,513
- Grandpa, you need some help?
- No darlin', not at all.

711
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:53,021
I'm blessed with work.

712
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:57,401
- Sweet dreams, Gracie Alana.
- Good night, Grandpa.

713
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:18,666
Best female singer.

714
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,929
- Dead or alive?
- Either.

715
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,135
- Ella Fitzgerald, easy.
- Now I can agree with that.

716
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:28,224
I agree.

717
00:59:28,352 --> 00:59:31,187
- I still take Banks over Cobb.
- Don't be ridiculous.

718
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:34,231
You can't mix your dream team
from different eras.

719
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:38,142
- Is this a new rule?
- You can't mix living and dead players.

720
00:59:42,908 --> 00:59:46,028
Ty Cobb was the greatest ball player ever.

721
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:50,788
- A great player, but an animal.
- I'd still take Ernie Banks over Ty Cobb.

722
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:53,703
Know how many came to his funeral?

723
00:59:53,836 --> 00:59:57,002
Joe DiMaggio was
the classiest of them all.

724
00:59:58,382 --> 01:00:03,507
Apples and oranges - come on, guys.
Compare short stop to short stop.

725
01:00:06,056 --> 01:00:10,385
You are either very late
or very early. What's your view of it?

726
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:14,386
I left my cellphone here.
Somebody called back. A young lady?

727
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:18,223
- I'll look for it. Come in and have a beer.
- No, thanks.

728
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,776
- Have to get home to the wife, do you?
- No.

729
01:00:22,906 --> 01:00:27,485
- You're... you're not married, then?
- Mmm... No. Not really.

730
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:29,826
I hope she didn't walk out on you.

731
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:32,327
No. No, no, she passed away.

732
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:36,289
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, that's very sad.

733
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,827
Oh, I hate to hear that. But anyway...

734
01:00:38,964 --> 01:00:42,796
Come on in, we'll have a pint on that.
Meet the lads back here.

735
01:00:44,344 --> 01:00:46,966
Now, this is my friend, uh...

736
01:00:47,889 --> 01:00:51,638
- Bob.
- Bob. His wife is dead.

737
01:00:51,768 --> 01:00:54,306
Hey, Robert! How are ya?

738
01:00:55,147 --> 01:00:59,856
That's Wally over there, and this is
Emmett. This is my brother-in-law Angelo.

739
01:00:59,985 --> 01:01:04,647
And I'm Marty. So deal him in.
Sit down and I'll get you a beer.

740
01:01:04,781 --> 01:01:06,904
Give him a chair, come on!

741
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:13,073
- Sophie, bring another pitcher of beer.
- I'm not real good at cards, but...

742
01:01:13,206 --> 01:01:14,404
- You got cash?
- Yeah.

743
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:18,705
- You're in.
- Pay a nickel, take your chances.

744
01:01:18,837 --> 01:01:21,209
Well, I'm on my way home.

745
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,710
- Ah. Hi there.
- Oh. Hi.

746
01:01:25,427 --> 01:01:27,633
- How'd you end up in their net?
- Sophie...

747
01:01:27,762 --> 01:01:29,755
His wife is dead.

748
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,929
Ah. Welcome.

749
01:01:32,517 --> 01:01:34,177
Who's walkin' me?

750
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:38,011
You're two doors down.
What's gonna happen? Will you get lost?

751
01:01:38,148 --> 01:01:40,603
I hope I do so you have to
live with the guilt.

752
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:45,312
- Oh, yap, yap, yap...
- Oh, Sophie, I'll walk you myself!

753
01:01:45,447 --> 01:01:47,570
Don't pay any attention to them.

754
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:50,613
- Wally, Wally.
- You got a lot of class(!)

755
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:53,698
You should have walked her home.
She's sweet on you.

756
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:55,324
Sweet on me?!

757
01:01:55,457 --> 01:01:59,371
- You should have taken her home.
- What?! I've known her 20 years.

758
01:01:59,502 --> 01:02:02,076
- Wally Casanova.
- You think she really likes me?

759
01:02:02,213 --> 01:02:03,838
Casanovinsky.

760
01:02:03,965 --> 01:02:06,005
I think she likes you.

761
01:02:06,134 --> 01:02:08,376
- You do?
- She was makin' a move.

762
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:12,841
- You got that impression?
- I got that vibe.

763
01:02:12,974 --> 01:02:17,019
- Why do you think she wants you to...
- Now here's a guy with a little taste.

764
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:20,016
I can't depend on you two... hobos.

765
01:02:20,148 --> 01:02:22,769
So everybody's gone for the night?

766
01:02:22,901 --> 01:02:27,313
The bartender, bus boys, waiters,
waitresses? You're closed up?

767
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:29,523
Yeah.

768
01:03:15,703 --> 01:03:19,368
I'm not much of a player but...
Willie Mays.

769
01:03:19,499 --> 01:03:23,117
And I believe all these picture cards
are a good thing.

770
01:03:23,252 --> 01:03:26,040
- Oh, Jesus!
- Gimme a break!

771
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,963
This is your lucky night tonight.

772
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:39,800
- I gotta go cover my plants.
- Wait, wait, wait, Gracie.

773
01:03:41,229 --> 01:03:44,064
Robert, my granddaughter Gracie.
Isn't she lovely?

774
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:48,852
Yes, she is. We spoke last night.
I was here with

775
01:03:50,404 --> 01:03:53,192
- the water lady.
- Mm-hm, yes. Yes.

776
01:03:53,324 --> 01:03:56,610
- Nice to see you again, Robert.
- Bob. Bob's fine.

777
01:04:01,415 --> 01:04:05,413
I'm here because I left my phone
and you called back, and...

778
01:04:05,545 --> 01:04:10,206
Oh, yes! I have your pyjamas...
phone behind the bar.

779
01:04:10,341 --> 01:04:13,959
I'll get it. Go ahead, cover the plants.
Roberto, give her a hand.

780
01:04:14,095 --> 01:04:16,087
- You need a hand?
- No.

781
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:17,420
Yeah!

782
01:04:17,556 --> 01:04:19,596
Should I go?

783
01:04:21,185 --> 01:04:23,012
Yes, yes, go with her.

784
01:04:23,145 --> 01:04:25,387
Yeah, that's very nice.

785
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:27,476
There they go.

786
01:04:27,608 --> 01:04:29,186
All right!

787
01:04:29,318 --> 01:04:32,818
- I'm gonna play from the hot corner!
- Always looking for the edge.

788
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:35,817
- Marty, what do you wanna play?
- Texas Hold'em.

789
01:04:42,415 --> 01:04:44,288
These are really fragile.

790
01:04:46,293 --> 01:04:48,535
- What?
- Nothin'.

791
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:53,334
- I know I look ridiculous.
- Oh, no, no. It's a lovely... hat.

792
01:04:53,717 --> 01:04:57,169
I'd take it off,
but then I'd have a shower cap head.

793
01:04:57,304 --> 01:05:00,389
You saw my hair last night.
Not that you were lookin', but I mean...

794
01:05:00,516 --> 01:05:04,893
We did speak, so maybe you noticed
my head. My hair. My head of hair.

795
01:05:07,982 --> 01:05:09,227
Thank you.

796
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:11,766
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

797
01:05:11,944 --> 01:05:14,861
You bought me dinner last night.
Very good, by the way.

798
01:05:15,197 --> 01:05:16,941
Good.

799
01:05:20,244 --> 01:05:22,533
Did you plant all this?

800
01:05:22,663 --> 01:05:26,874
Yeah. There's no rhyme or reason to it.
You just let it grow.

801
01:05:27,001 --> 01:05:31,995
It's amazing. I've never seen anything
like it right in the middle of the city.

802
01:05:32,131 --> 01:05:33,791
It's like a garden.

803
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:42,264
- I might have bent that one.
- Oh. That's OK.

804
01:05:43,308 --> 01:05:46,475
- I gotta get some more shelves.
- Oh, you smell great.

805
01:05:47,146 --> 01:05:49,019
It's the flowers.

806
01:05:49,148 --> 01:05:53,311
Not this particular flower, cos this is
a tomato plant - it's all the flowers.

807
01:05:54,111 --> 01:05:56,317
You can just put that down there.

808
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:11,409
- Did you paint that?
- Uh, yeah.

809
01:06:12,504 --> 01:06:14,497
Where is this? Europe?

810
01:06:14,673 --> 01:06:16,879
- Could be.
- How many times have you been?

811
01:06:17,259 --> 01:06:19,964
Oh God, none.
I've never been anywhere but here.

812
01:06:20,596 --> 01:06:22,754
It's beautiful, wherever it is.

813
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:25,430
I should take it inside.

814
01:06:27,811 --> 01:06:30,136
I guess I paint places from my dreams.

815
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,896
I bet you can't wait to go to sleep!

816
01:06:38,739 --> 01:06:41,027
Would you go out with me?

817
01:06:41,158 --> 01:06:42,486
Yes?

818
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,445
- Is that a question?
- No, it's a yes. Yes!

819
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,948
- Tomorrow night?
- Yes.

820
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:51,541
- Eight o'clock?
- Yes.

821
01:06:52,252 --> 01:06:54,292
- Pick you up here?
- Yes.

822
01:06:55,172 --> 01:06:57,211
My, you're a very difficult woman!

823
01:07:00,052 --> 01:07:02,673
You take that inside. I'll finish up here.

824
01:07:02,804 --> 01:07:04,464
I'll find your phone.

825
01:07:11,271 --> 01:07:13,844
They're coming back.
Come on, let's get lost.

826
01:07:13,982 --> 01:07:17,932
What? This is the best hand I ever had!

827
01:07:18,069 --> 01:07:22,566
- Don't argue about it.
- New shuffle if we relocate.

828
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:25,818
Emmett, come on.

829
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:34,371
Get in there, come on.
I can't close the doors.

830
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:43,670
Grandpa?

831
01:07:43,803 --> 01:07:45,713
We're not here!

832
01:07:51,561 --> 01:07:53,969
- Who is it?
- It's me.

833
01:07:54,898 --> 01:07:56,772
- Who?
- It's Grace.

834
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,779
I met someone. I just wanted to tell you.

835
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,861
I gotta go, cos Grandpa
doesn't know I snuck out. OK.

836
01:08:11,623 --> 01:08:15,206
- Do you want me to drive you?
- No. I have my bike.

837
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:20,625
She's not the first woman I've noticed
as a guy, but as a man...

838
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:28,090
You know what I mean.

839
01:08:38,191 --> 01:08:40,397
I'm buildin' you a great place.

840
01:08:49,661 --> 01:08:54,406
I don't know what to wear.
Do you think black is too za-za-zing?

841
01:08:54,874 --> 01:08:58,492
I'd wear somethin' light.
Whatever you wear, just be comfortable.

842
01:08:58,628 --> 01:09:00,704
I have a ten-inch scar down my chest.

843
01:09:01,089 --> 01:09:03,959
If I was gonna be comfortable
I'd wear my sweats.

844
01:09:04,092 --> 01:09:07,674
Not a good idea. But whatever you do,
don't shave your legs.

845
01:09:08,304 --> 01:09:12,053
- Why?
- Then you definitely won't let it go too far.

846
01:09:12,183 --> 01:09:14,721
Megan, it's a first date.

847
01:09:14,936 --> 01:09:18,139
I married a first date, missy.
You know how it is.

848
01:09:18,272 --> 01:09:23,184
You're with a guy, you find him attractive,
everything they say sounds brilliant.

849
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:25,276
Hairy legs are your link to reality.

850
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,439
Needlepoint that on a pillow.

851
01:09:27,573 --> 01:09:32,116
I just might.
It kept me a virgin until - you know...

852
01:09:32,245 --> 01:09:34,284
- Whenever.
- Bye.

853
01:09:37,959 --> 01:09:41,209
I fly to Florida a couple of times a year
to visit the folks.

854
01:09:41,337 --> 01:09:44,671
- I can't wait to go on a plane.
- You've never been on a plane?

855
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,838
- Well, no, I couldn't.
- How come?

856
01:09:46,968 --> 01:09:48,925
Since I was 14 I've...

857
01:09:50,137 --> 01:09:52,344
My grandpa was sick.

858
01:09:52,473 --> 01:09:56,518
I always had to stay close to home
so I could take care of him.

859
01:09:56,644 --> 01:09:58,518
God, he seems so healthy now.

860
01:09:58,646 --> 01:10:03,272
Well, he is. Now he's fine.
He doesn't even like to talk about it.

861
01:10:03,401 --> 01:10:05,144
Ever.

862
01:10:05,278 --> 01:10:08,860
I'll remember that.
What about your parents?

863
01:10:09,448 --> 01:10:11,737
My mom died when I was five.

864
01:10:11,867 --> 01:10:14,109
I'm sorry. How?

865
01:10:14,245 --> 01:10:15,704
Heart disease.

866
01:10:17,748 --> 01:10:21,248
My dad took off as soon as her illness
interfered with his plans.

867
01:10:22,628 --> 01:10:24,668
It was all right. You know...

868
01:10:25,798 --> 01:10:29,843
Grandpa was always the one
that'd take care of us anyway.

869
01:10:35,641 --> 01:10:36,970
What'll you have?

870
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,683
- Can I get two scoops?
- No.

871
01:10:39,812 --> 01:10:41,306
Of course you can!

872
01:10:50,197 --> 01:10:51,526
Watch your head.

873
01:11:01,959 --> 01:11:04,876
This is the first job
I supervised on my own.

874
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:07,330
I love this building.

875
01:11:09,091 --> 01:11:10,372
Wow!

876
01:11:11,886 --> 01:11:13,510
That's incredible.

877
01:11:14,013 --> 01:11:17,631
We see all this cos we're
standing on something you built.

878
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,970
I had help.

879
01:11:23,564 --> 01:11:25,141
Thanks.

880
01:11:30,529 --> 01:11:33,980
Elizabeth and I were married
by the time we were 20.

881
01:11:34,116 --> 01:11:42,076
We'd been dating since we were 1 5,
so this may sound a bit juvenile... but...

882
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:45,163
Can I hold your hand?

883
01:11:45,711 --> 01:11:47,086
Yes.

884
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:13,605
- Sometimes it feels like another life.
- I know what you mean.

885
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:18,906
Thanks for... coming out.
I had a really nice time tonight.

886
01:12:19,036 --> 01:12:21,491
Yeah. So did l.

887
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:24,449
- I should give you this.
- No.

888
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:28,742
Keep it. I'll get it back from you
next time we go out.

889
01:12:29,171 --> 01:12:31,626
- OK.
- It looks good with your blouse anyway.

890
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:33,917
Oh, God!

891
01:12:35,886 --> 01:12:37,925
I'm so sorry.

892
01:12:38,889 --> 01:12:42,554
- My God, did you see anything?
- I wasn't looking.

893
01:12:42,684 --> 01:12:45,555
No, I know. It's because I had a heart...

894
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,727
I had a heart...
a heart-warming dream about you.

895
01:12:50,859 --> 01:12:54,310
- Must have been a nightmare.
- No, you were very...

896
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:56,814
- Scary?
- Sexy.

897
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,695
- You had a sex dream about me?
- No, I didn't...

898
01:12:59,826 --> 01:13:03,776
I didn't have a sex dream about you.
I don't even know you.

899
01:13:03,955 --> 01:13:05,498
I'm really sorry.

900
01:13:09,044 --> 01:13:10,455
Good night.

901
01:13:19,721 --> 01:13:21,761
Good night.

902
01:13:25,936 --> 01:13:27,845
Morning, Dennis. Boys.

903
01:13:27,979 --> 01:13:30,766
Good mornin' life, good mornin' sun...

904
01:13:30,899 --> 01:13:32,559
Tommy!

905
01:13:32,692 --> 01:13:36,357
Gee, it's great to be alive and in love

906
01:13:38,073 --> 01:13:40,445
Good mornin' life

907
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:44,451
Good mornin' birds,
sing out, you're happy too

908
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:47,153
Feel so good, cos I'll be seein' her soon

909
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:48,950
Boys, you comin'?

910
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:53,416
Last night she said she loved me

911
01:13:53,546 --> 01:13:55,420
What a pity to part

912
01:13:59,719 --> 01:14:01,712
Hey, it's the new hip!

913
01:14:02,055 --> 01:14:04,628
I wish I could move like that, Wally.

914
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:11,102
Gee, Wally, which ball is yours?

915
01:14:11,272 --> 01:14:14,558
- Oh, you shutta your trap!
- I didn't say anythin'.

916
01:14:14,734 --> 01:14:16,774
Here goes, boys!

917
01:14:21,699 --> 01:14:23,443
He strikes! Yes!

918
01:14:27,288 --> 01:14:28,699
Megan, it's you.

919
01:14:31,417 --> 01:14:33,457
Hey, get up there, Megan.

920
01:14:34,754 --> 01:14:36,877
Megan, how do I look?

921
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:40,790
- Great. I've never seen you so happy.
- I am so hot!

922
01:14:40,927 --> 01:14:43,465
What do you expect in a wool sweater?

923
01:14:43,596 --> 01:14:45,256
- It's cotton.
- Go in your lane.

924
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:47,963
- It's up to here! Just tell him.
- I'm gonna.

925
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:49,513
Where's your ball?

926
01:14:49,686 --> 01:14:50,931
Here we go.

927
01:14:56,734 --> 01:14:59,439
All right! Very good!

928
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:03,773
I got you some hot chocolate.
I thought you might be cold.

929
01:15:04,325 --> 01:15:05,523
Thanks.

930
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:11,369
All at once I knew what livin' can be

931
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:15,625
Do you suppose we could
get back to the game?

932
01:15:16,379 --> 01:15:19,664
- I'll hold on to it. I'll be right here.
- All right.

933
01:15:19,799 --> 01:15:21,708
I'll just... bowl.

934
01:15:21,843 --> 01:15:25,212
Good mornin' life

935
01:15:27,598 --> 01:15:30,172
Can I get a Miller? Bottle, no glass.

936
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,064
Oh, my God!

937
01:15:45,158 --> 01:15:46,700
I'll be a minute.

938
01:15:47,618 --> 01:15:49,527
Angelo!

939
01:15:49,662 --> 01:15:54,490
- All right, make way!
- Come on, killer!

940
01:15:56,168 --> 01:15:58,410
Charlie! You made it.

941
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,463
Thanks for comin'.

942
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:04,504
- I, uh... thought we were meeting at a bar.
- There's a bar here.

943
01:16:04,635 --> 01:16:08,680
- What's with the senior citizens?
- We're bowlin'. It's good.

944
01:16:08,806 --> 01:16:11,558
- Everybody, this is Charlie.
- Hi, Charlie.

945
01:16:11,684 --> 01:16:14,353
Joe, Charlie.
This is a good friend of mine.

946
01:16:14,478 --> 01:16:16,270
Emmett, my good friend Charlie.

947
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:19,433
- Charlie, you in?
- Yeah, he's in. Ten spot.

948
01:16:21,527 --> 01:16:24,279
- You for or against?
- Uh... for.

949
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:27,489
For? For? For? Of course.

950
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,404
- What did I just bet on?
- Whether Angelo gets a strike or not.

951
01:16:35,374 --> 01:16:37,616
All right!

952
01:16:37,752 --> 01:16:41,998
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
You're right here!

953
01:16:42,173 --> 01:16:43,418
All right!

954
01:16:43,549 --> 01:16:45,043
- Did I win?
- Yeah.

955
01:16:45,176 --> 01:16:46,884
- Great!
- Everybody won.

956
01:16:47,011 --> 01:16:51,091
- Here we go.
- You're lookin' at your highest score ever.

957
01:16:51,223 --> 01:16:54,224
Which is 67 up to now, Emmett.

958
01:16:54,393 --> 01:16:57,596
- I didn't even know Bob bowled.
- He doesn't.

959
01:16:58,397 --> 01:17:00,970
I would like to dedicate
this next shot to Grace,

960
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:05,527
who brought me back to the game
after a 25-year absence.

961
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:08,691
Before I was
your beer-runner and milkman,

962
01:17:08,866 --> 01:17:10,989
the last time I bowled was

963
01:17:11,118 --> 01:17:14,783
Andy Jankovsky's 1 3th birthday party.

964
01:17:14,955 --> 01:17:16,153
So Grace,

965
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:19,323
this shot's for you.

966
01:17:22,087 --> 01:17:26,085
68! 68!

967
01:17:28,636 --> 01:17:30,509
Aaw! It's still

968
01:17:30,637 --> 01:17:33,045
- 66! 66!
- Hey, Bob!

969
01:17:33,223 --> 01:17:36,260
- Try the other arm.
- I got one more.

970
01:17:36,477 --> 01:17:38,765
- So what do you do?
- I'm a vet.

971
01:17:38,896 --> 01:17:41,054
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't go to 'Nam.

972
01:17:52,743 --> 01:17:55,150
That's for you, baby.

973
01:17:56,497 --> 01:18:00,245
I think Sammy Davis Jr is
the greatest performer of that group.

974
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:03,045
- And I like Bill Cosby too.
- Well, l...

975
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:05,328
Oh, oh, oh. And Flip Wilson.

976
01:18:05,464 --> 01:18:07,124
Oh, yeah!

977
01:18:07,257 --> 01:18:08,538
What a wacko.

978
01:18:08,675 --> 01:18:12,009
- This'll be good for about a week.
- Thank you so much.

979
01:18:12,804 --> 01:18:15,011
I really appreciate it.
See you guys later.

980
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:18,343
- Bye, Emmett. Bye, guys!
- Bye-bye, Charlie!

981
01:18:18,477 --> 01:18:20,019
Poker tonight?

982
01:18:20,145 --> 01:18:24,095
No, Grace and I are going to enjoy
a glass of wine, maybe take a walk...

983
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:26,521
So I'll let you boys
hold on to your money.

984
01:18:26,652 --> 01:18:30,270
Don't walk too far now.
It's getting very dark out there.

985
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:33,940
How would you like to take a spin
in my Cadillac? I just had it waxed.

986
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:37,492
I can't handle that machine.
It's too much for me. But thank you.

987
01:18:37,621 --> 01:18:39,578
- You need a sweater?
- Yes, she does.

988
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,953
I don't need a sweater, OK?

989
01:18:43,126 --> 01:18:46,293
You don't need to go far
beyond the yard anyway.

990
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:51,416
I'm going to have to put the special
candle out there that repels all the bugs.

991
01:18:51,551 --> 01:18:53,627
Every species but one!

992
01:18:56,139 --> 01:18:58,096
Marty, what species is that?

993
01:18:58,225 --> 01:19:00,894
It's the sabre-tooth fly.

994
01:19:07,526 --> 01:19:09,565
- The famous candle.
- Yup.

995
01:19:10,737 --> 01:19:13,655
Marty, will you get away
from the window!

996
01:19:13,865 --> 01:19:17,614
All serene.
I think she's going to tell him tonight.

997
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:20,656
The longer she waits,
the harder it's gonna be.

998
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:24,875
I don't see what the big deal is.
I mean, she had a heart transplant.

999
01:19:25,377 --> 01:19:29,624
I went with a girl that had a club foot.
She had the big shoe and everything.

1000
01:19:29,756 --> 01:19:33,291
- You'll be remembered in heaven for that.
- You're a saint.

1001
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:37,218
Bet she had a hell of a personality
to put up with you.

1002
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:40,557
He better not hurt her,
that's all I've got to say.

1003
01:19:40,684 --> 01:19:41,964
What's this?

1004
01:19:42,102 --> 01:19:44,225
Everybody's picking on me now!

1005
01:19:50,235 --> 01:19:53,853
- Come on, simmer down.
- How many cards you want?

1006
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:57,820
Hold it. Let's play some Pavarotti -
give 'em a little inspiration.

1007
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:01,735
They don't need any music out there,
Angelo.

1008
01:20:01,871 --> 01:20:05,572
Wait a minute, how about some Bing?

1009
01:20:05,709 --> 01:20:09,160
Bing, no! We need Bobby.

1010
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:13,125
At least play something bearable.

1011
01:20:13,758 --> 01:20:16,759
Sorry, excuse me. Look...

1012
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:19,503
They'll make their own music.

1013
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,675
Come on. Let me handle this.

1014
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:27,939
- I had a good time tonight.
- So did l.

1015
01:20:28,731 --> 01:20:30,356
I had a great time.

1016
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,152
She likes Dean or Frank.

1017
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,692
We need somethin' modern.
Don't you have any new albums?

1018
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:42,942
These are all new - the latest thing.

1019
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:45,321
Angelo, you pick out one.

1020
01:20:45,456 --> 01:20:49,584
If I pick out one it's Sinatra.
Who the hell else is there?

1021
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:53,166
In the beginning... was Sinatra.

1022
01:20:53,298 --> 01:20:56,501
And ever shall be
Frankie Sinatra, the one and only.

1023
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:59,208
Back in style, though dead.

1024
01:20:59,345 --> 01:21:01,302
Frankie! Sing it, baby.

1025
01:21:01,764 --> 01:21:04,006
What is this? A baseball game?

1026
01:21:04,183 --> 01:21:08,181
- Oh, God, it's a live concert.
- That'll work.

1027
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:16,066
- I'll make 'em turn it off.
- No. No.

1028
01:21:16,946 --> 01:21:18,986
It's nice.

1029
01:21:19,949 --> 01:21:21,989
What's goin' on over there?

1030
01:21:22,118 --> 01:21:24,407
Let it work its magic.

1031
01:21:24,537 --> 01:21:26,576
Or merely the mock?

1032
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:31,324
Oh, no. I'm really not a very good dancer.

1033
01:21:31,961 --> 01:21:34,369
You'll be fine.

1034
01:21:35,465 --> 01:21:41,337
Or is what I feel the real McCoy?

1035
01:21:43,306 --> 01:21:45,512
ls it for all time

1036
01:21:45,641 --> 01:21:48,179
Or simply a lark?

1037
01:21:49,729 --> 01:21:52,516
ls it Granada I see

1038
01:21:52,648 --> 01:21:55,222
Or only Asbury Park?

1039
01:21:56,694 --> 01:22:02,364
ls it a fancy not worth thinking of?

1040
01:22:03,284 --> 01:22:05,323
Or is it at long

1041
01:22:06,787 --> 01:22:09,705
Long last love?

1042
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:12,831
ls it an earthquake

1043
01:22:13,502 --> 01:22:15,542
Or simply a shock?

1044
01:22:17,381 --> 01:22:19,421
ls it that good turtle soup

1045
01:22:19,717 --> 01:22:21,756
Or merely the mock?

1046
01:22:22,428 --> 01:22:25,298
-  ls it the cocktail
-  ls it the cocktail

1047
01:22:25,431 --> 01:22:28,764
-  This feeling of joy?
-  This feeling ofjoy?

1048
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:36,191
Or is what I feel the real McCoy?

1049
01:22:37,943 --> 01:22:40,399
ls it for all time

1050
01:22:40,529 --> 01:22:42,569
Or simply a lark?

1051
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,405
ls it Granada I see

1052
01:22:47,536 --> 01:22:50,621
Or onlyAsbury Park?

1053
01:22:51,582 --> 01:22:53,621
ls it a fancy

1054
01:22:54,919 --> 01:22:58,003
Not worth thinking of?.

1055
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:01,001
Or is it at long

1056
01:23:01,592 --> 01:23:03,917
ls this at long

1057
01:23:05,054 --> 01:23:11,388
At long last love?

1058
01:23:15,064 --> 01:23:18,183
- Hey, Tommy, did you get that...?
- It's all done.

1059
01:23:18,317 --> 01:23:22,397
- You don't know what I'm gonna ask you.
- We got it done. Trust me.

1060
01:23:22,529 --> 01:23:25,780
- Charlie.
- Bennington called.

1061
01:23:25,908 --> 01:23:29,158
I told him the dedication
is gonna be in a couple of weeks.

1062
01:23:29,286 --> 01:23:34,031
He's postponing his vacation
cos he insists on doing your intro.

1063
01:23:36,085 --> 01:23:38,042
Elizabeth would love that, huh?

1064
01:23:40,297 --> 01:23:42,088
She would love this.

1065
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,251
- You did it.
- Took me long enough.

1066
01:23:46,386 --> 01:23:49,304
Bob, I'm going to order one more
double-glass panel.

1067
01:23:49,431 --> 01:23:51,139
No, Jeff. Hold up.

1068
01:23:54,019 --> 01:23:56,688
Want to get a beer? Or is tonight bingo(?)

1069
01:23:56,814 --> 01:24:00,763
- Take some time off.
- Grace wants to talk after dinner tonight.

1070
01:24:00,901 --> 01:24:05,527
She wants to talk, she's making dinner
and she never stays over. Don't you see?

1071
01:24:05,656 --> 01:24:10,068
She probably read that book with the
laws, the rules, whatever they call it.

1072
01:24:10,202 --> 01:24:14,413
This is a game that all women play
just to reel us in.

1073
01:24:14,539 --> 01:24:17,659
- Well, it's workin'.
- You are so sad.

1074
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,038
Hey, kids!

1075
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:23,005
Sammy Sosa! Right here!

1076
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:25,879
- It's him!
- Everybody!

1077
01:24:32,975 --> 01:24:35,430
So... I'm going to tell him tonight.

1078
01:24:35,852 --> 01:24:38,640
- Please. I've heard that before.
- No, I am.

1079
01:24:38,772 --> 01:24:41,310
Well, you should. Because he's perfect.

1080
01:24:41,441 --> 01:24:42,639
Yeah.

1081
01:24:43,777 --> 01:24:45,437
Yeah. For me he is.

1082
01:24:45,612 --> 01:24:47,688
Don't get me wrong - he's no Joe.

1083
01:24:47,823 --> 01:24:49,447
- Honey?
- Yes?

1084
01:24:49,616 --> 01:24:52,072
Austin got sick all over my shirt.

1085
01:24:52,202 --> 01:24:55,618
I gave him a baby Tylenol
and put him in his PJs.

1086
01:24:55,831 --> 01:24:59,034
He's going to sleep in our bed. Again!

1087
01:25:02,129 --> 01:25:04,620
Kid keeps gettin' sick.

1088
01:25:06,133 --> 01:25:09,169
I shouldn't have given him
that pepperoni pizza.

1089
01:25:09,302 --> 01:25:10,547
What?

1090
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:15,091
You should put on a shirt or Grace
will never be satisfied by another man.

1091
01:25:17,227 --> 01:25:19,266
You like that, baby?

1092
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:23,435
- I'm a bad cat!
- He's all muscle.

1093
01:25:24,818 --> 01:25:27,902
Come on, you can dance with me.

1094
01:25:28,029 --> 01:25:32,241
- Gracie, you wanna dance with me?
- Our rhythm gets us in trouble.

1095
01:25:47,173 --> 01:25:51,634
- Sure you don't want any help?
- Amazingly, I can microwave popcorn(!)

1096
01:25:55,432 --> 01:26:01,386
Did you see the write-up in the Trib
about the dedication comin' up?

1097
01:26:01,521 --> 01:26:03,763
No. I have to read that.

1098
01:26:03,898 --> 01:26:05,772
Yeah.

1099
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,605
Everyone wants to be there.
Grandpa and the guys.

1100
01:26:08,903 --> 01:26:12,438
- Oh. As long as you're there.
- Course I'll be there.

1101
01:26:12,991 --> 01:26:14,449
Hey, Mel.

1102
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,401
Good boy.

1103
01:26:20,165 --> 01:26:21,707
Oh, that's enough.

1104
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:25,617
Sydney is going to love
his new place - I hope.

1105
01:26:25,753 --> 01:26:27,876
I'm thinking about movin' in myself.

1106
01:26:28,006 --> 01:26:30,627
It's... it's... it's perfect for him.

1107
01:26:31,134 --> 01:26:33,210
- I bet you can't wait.
- Yeah.

1108
01:26:34,387 --> 01:26:35,881
Finally.

1109
01:26:36,014 --> 01:26:38,718
You've been workin' so hard.

1110
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:40,926
But it's been worth it.

1111
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:44,724
To make Elizabeth's dream come true.

1112
01:26:46,691 --> 01:26:48,980
At least I could do that for her.

1113
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:53,437
I'm sure she's very proud of you.

1114
01:26:57,744 --> 01:26:59,783
Thank you, Grace.

1115
01:27:17,138 --> 01:27:20,305
- There's something you want to tell me?
- Yeah.

1116
01:27:24,604 --> 01:27:26,976
And now would be a good time.

1117
01:27:29,775 --> 01:27:31,483
Popcorn's done!

1118
01:27:33,529 --> 01:27:35,154
OK.

1119
01:27:35,865 --> 01:27:37,145
Sorry.

1120
01:27:37,283 --> 01:27:39,192
- Would you save my place?
- Sure.

1121
01:27:43,581 --> 01:27:47,626
Oh, I got a new CD.
You wanna put on some music?

1122
01:27:48,794 --> 01:27:50,834
Yes, good.

1123
01:27:50,963 --> 01:27:52,790
OK...

1124
01:27:52,924 --> 01:27:55,130
Where's the music?

1125
01:27:55,259 --> 01:27:58,260
It's in my jacket pocket. In the den.

1126
01:27:58,387 --> 01:28:00,427
Oh, OK.

1127
01:28:51,398 --> 01:28:55,313
"Dr Elizabeth Rueland died
in a car accident on April 1 2th."

1128
01:28:56,987 --> 01:28:59,027
April 1 2th...

1129
01:29:41,115 --> 01:29:42,775
Grace?

1130
01:29:43,951 --> 01:29:45,409
Gracie?

1131
01:29:45,869 --> 01:29:49,404
Jeez, the microwave. There's not
gonna be any popcorn tonight.

1132
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,082
- I'm sorry.
- What?

1133
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:52,619
I have to go.

1134
01:29:52,751 --> 01:29:54,080
- Now?
- Yeah.

1135
01:29:54,211 --> 01:29:55,290
Why?

1136
01:29:55,671 --> 01:29:59,289
I completely forgot - I promised Megan
I was gonna babysit for her.

1137
01:29:59,424 --> 01:30:00,835
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1138
01:30:01,009 --> 01:30:03,381
- I'll go with you.
- No! No!

1139
01:30:03,512 --> 01:30:05,220
I'll drive us.

1140
01:30:05,347 --> 01:30:08,348
It's OK, cos I got my bike.
I got to take my bicycle.

1141
01:30:10,143 --> 01:30:12,302
- Damn bike is so old!
- You OK?

1142
01:30:12,437 --> 01:30:16,684
Yeah, I'm fine, I just... it's late
and she's gonna be worried about me.

1143
01:30:16,817 --> 01:30:18,856
Slow down a bit.

1144
01:30:19,444 --> 01:30:21,852
Gimme that, you're gonna hurt yourself.

1145
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:24,906
- I'm late.
- OK. I'll just throw this in the truck.

1146
01:30:25,033 --> 01:30:28,533
No, no, no. I'm here, I'm here.
Just let me go.

1147
01:30:28,662 --> 01:30:32,410
All right. I'll call Megan
and tell her that you're on your way.

1148
01:30:32,541 --> 01:30:35,874
- No, because the baby might be napping.
- All right.

1149
01:30:36,002 --> 01:30:39,454
- She's gonna be worried. Don't call her!
- Relax. OK!

1150
01:30:39,589 --> 01:30:43,919
- What was it you wanted to tell me?
- Nothing! It doesn't matter.

1151
01:30:48,765 --> 01:30:50,176
Mel, stay!

1152
01:31:05,407 --> 01:31:07,446
Come on.

1153
01:31:11,037 --> 01:31:12,829
- Oh, my God!
- Honey...

1154
01:31:12,956 --> 01:31:15,364
What was God thinking?

1155
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,667
- I'll take you over there and you tell him.
- No, I can't go!

1156
01:31:18,795 --> 01:31:19,993
Yes, you can.

1157
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:23,546
- I can't say anything to him.
- Yes you can, you'll just tell him.

1158
01:31:23,717 --> 01:31:24,997
How?

1159
01:31:25,176 --> 01:31:27,549
Just: "Bob... You know, l..."

1160
01:31:28,471 --> 01:31:31,425
"Bob..." You know, you say it. "Bob..."

1161
01:31:31,641 --> 01:31:33,515
You can't even say it.

1162
01:31:33,643 --> 01:31:39,183
Not off the top of my head - I need time
to think - but we'll find the perfect words.

1163
01:31:39,316 --> 01:31:42,649
I'll help you and I'll bring you there. OK?

1164
01:31:42,777 --> 01:31:45,399
- I'll go with you.
- I don't want to go.

1165
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:48,864
I'll wait in the car, of course,
but you go in and... say it.

1166
01:31:48,992 --> 01:31:51,447
But there's nothing we can say.

1167
01:31:52,579 --> 01:31:54,156
Oh Christ! Who died?

1168
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:57,082
- No one.
- Bob's wife.

1169
01:31:58,001 --> 01:32:01,121
- He's married?!
- Oh, God.

1170
01:32:01,296 --> 01:32:02,327
That rat bastard!

1171
01:32:02,464 --> 01:32:04,006
That rat bastard!

1172
01:32:04,132 --> 01:32:07,216
You want me to go over
and handle that sonofabitch?

1173
01:32:07,343 --> 01:32:11,637
I knew it - that hairline,
the creative type - it's a given.

1174
01:32:11,764 --> 01:32:14,884
- You don't understand!
- I swear, I will kick his ass!

1175
01:32:15,018 --> 01:32:17,094
I will kick the shit out of him!

1176
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:18,468
Quit pushin' me!

1177
01:32:18,646 --> 01:32:20,686
Grace, you want me to handle it?

1178
01:32:20,857 --> 01:32:24,190
I'll kick the shit out of him for you, Grace.
Son of a bitch!

1179
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:27,818
Joe, please!
Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart.

1180
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:34,035
He's not married?

1181
01:32:36,497 --> 01:32:37,778
Oh.

1182
01:32:38,916 --> 01:32:40,459
OK.

1183
01:32:40,585 --> 01:32:42,459
- You want some ice cream?
- Yeah.

1184
01:32:42,587 --> 01:32:44,912
You want somethin', hon? Grace?

1185
01:32:50,553 --> 01:32:53,471
I called over to Fabrizio.

1186
01:32:54,057 --> 01:32:57,141
- He'll pick you up in Rome.
- OK.

1187
01:32:58,561 --> 01:33:01,977
I can't go over there myself
until the fall.

1188
01:33:02,815 --> 01:33:08,735
Because Angelo and Sophie need my help
in the busy summer season.

1189
01:33:08,863 --> 01:33:10,772
I know, Grandpa.

1190
01:33:13,117 --> 01:33:16,985
I guess... you could go without me.

1191
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:21,833
Grandpa...

1192
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:24,667
I think it's for the best.

1193
01:33:25,129 --> 01:33:27,834
It'll be easier for Bob if I'm gone.

1194
01:33:28,382 --> 01:33:30,790
It's only you I'm concerned about.

1195
01:33:36,098 --> 01:33:40,725
Once I tell him...
I'm gonna want to go away.

1196
01:33:45,858 --> 01:33:48,017
- Hey, Marty!
- Hello, Robert!

1197
01:33:48,778 --> 01:33:50,153
Hey, Gracie.

1198
01:33:50,321 --> 01:33:53,772
Close your eyes and don't open 'em
until I tell you, OK?

1199
01:33:53,908 --> 01:33:55,568
Now, listen...

1200
01:33:55,701 --> 01:34:00,577
It's the character that's the strongest
that God gives the most challenges to.

1201
01:34:00,706 --> 01:34:03,458
Now, you can take that as a compliment!

1202
01:34:03,584 --> 01:34:05,660
Your eyes closed?

1203
01:34:05,795 --> 01:34:07,871
- Yup.
- Keep 'em closed now.

1204
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:12,046
No peekin'.

1205
01:34:12,176 --> 01:34:16,387
Come on, put your hand over your eyes.
I can't tell.

1206
01:34:18,307 --> 01:34:20,513
Hold on. Keep 'em closed.

1207
01:34:23,437 --> 01:34:25,430
Open. Ta-da!

1208
01:34:29,652 --> 01:34:31,229
A bike.

1209
01:34:31,362 --> 01:34:35,312
- You haven't even opened it yet!
- You bought me a bike.

1210
01:34:36,408 --> 01:34:38,235
- With a basket.
- Yeah.

1211
01:34:38,369 --> 01:34:42,153
I got it at Rudy's down on Addison.
He restores vintage bikes.

1212
01:34:42,289 --> 01:34:44,745
This one had your name all over it.

1213
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:50,210
I think she likes it!

1214
01:34:51,382 --> 01:34:52,924
Are you OK?

1215
01:34:53,092 --> 01:34:55,927
I was worried about you last night.

1216
01:34:57,930 --> 01:34:59,721
I'm goin' away.

1217
01:35:00,766 --> 01:35:01,929
What?

1218
01:35:03,477 --> 01:35:06,846
- I'm goin' away.
- Why?

1219
01:35:08,315 --> 01:35:11,067
I should have told you... somethin' l...

1220
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:14,778
I didn't have the courage to tell you.

1221
01:35:17,908 --> 01:35:20,695
A little over a year ago I had surgery.

1222
01:35:22,579 --> 01:35:24,406
I had a heart transplant.

1223
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:28,834
Oh, my God! I thought you were
going to say you were a man.

1224
01:35:28,961 --> 01:35:30,953
- Am I hurting you?
- No.

1225
01:35:31,088 --> 01:35:34,042
You're OK now. You're fine.
You're healed.

1226
01:35:34,174 --> 01:35:36,131
You could have told me that.

1227
01:35:37,261 --> 01:35:42,088
I should have told you.
I'm really sorry I didn't. But l...

1228
01:35:45,185 --> 01:35:47,225
When l, uh...

1229
01:35:47,688 --> 01:35:51,436
I found this in your house.

1230
01:35:57,948 --> 01:35:59,987
That's me.

1231
01:36:01,368 --> 01:36:06,955
I'm goin' away tonight, um...
so you won't be reminded.

1232
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:10,999
I... I didn't know. I didn't know that...

1233
01:36:11,128 --> 01:36:13,120
I swear to God I didn't know.

1234
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:18,625
I'm so sorry. I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1235
01:36:19,845 --> 01:36:21,672
I... I gotta go.

1236
01:36:21,972 --> 01:36:24,973
- I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- OK.

1237
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,511
I gotta...

1238
01:36:28,145 --> 01:36:30,600
- walk.
- OK.

1239
01:36:55,839 --> 01:36:59,172
You're not going to
try to check that on to the aeroplane?

1240
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:00,711
I wanna take it.

1241
01:37:00,886 --> 01:37:05,382
- Marty, come on. Let her take it.
- But I can bring it over when I go over.

1242
01:37:05,515 --> 01:37:09,050
Sweetie, I did check the machine again.
Still no call from him.

1243
01:37:09,185 --> 01:37:11,059
Oh well, now you better stay.

1244
01:37:11,187 --> 01:37:15,232
Sometimes you gotta run away
to see if somebody's gonna follow.

1245
01:37:15,358 --> 01:37:19,438
I've told her I'm going to follow her
but I can't get over until the fall.

1246
01:37:19,571 --> 01:37:20,733
Jesus!

1247
01:37:20,905 --> 01:37:25,982
- Are you sure he knows you're leaving?
- Yeah. I told him I was going away.

1248
01:37:28,788 --> 01:37:32,833
Here's a little snack, honey.
I love you so much.

1249
01:37:32,959 --> 01:37:34,501
Sweetheart.

1250
01:37:34,627 --> 01:37:37,961
Pray in Rome. God'll hear you better.

1251
01:37:39,132 --> 01:37:41,801
Oh, I hate to say goodbye to you.

1252
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,680
Oh, well...

1253
01:37:50,602 --> 01:37:52,429
Away you go.

1254
01:37:56,191 --> 01:37:57,649
Yeah.

1255
01:37:59,819 --> 01:38:01,611
OK.

1256
01:38:03,364 --> 01:38:06,318
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, darlin'.

1257
01:38:07,494 --> 01:38:09,071
Bye.

1258
01:40:23,003 --> 01:40:25,126
Hey, Charlie, it's me.

1259
01:40:25,256 --> 01:40:27,165
I need to talk to someone.

1260
01:40:28,384 --> 01:40:31,053
No... not over the phone.

1261
01:40:32,263 --> 01:40:33,721
Can you meet me?

1262
01:40:35,182 --> 01:40:37,389
Yes, 1 2.30 is fine.

1263
01:40:37,518 --> 01:40:39,557
Thanks. Thank you.

1264
01:40:43,857 --> 01:40:46,562
The inspector's here. Drink up.

1265
01:40:52,366 --> 01:40:54,275
Scusa. You like?

1266
01:40:54,410 --> 01:40:56,367
Oh. No, thank you.

1267
01:40:57,413 --> 01:41:00,283
Maybe... it help you paint?

1268
01:41:00,416 --> 01:41:01,744
Oh, it...

1269
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:06,169
No, I was going to
go home now, to... a casa.

1270
01:41:07,089 --> 01:41:09,128
Thank you, though. Thanks.

1271
01:41:10,175 --> 01:41:11,800
He is married?

1272
01:41:15,889 --> 01:41:17,432
It's a long story.

1273
01:41:26,316 --> 01:41:29,401
I take my break now.

1274
01:41:37,578 --> 01:41:38,823
Wow!

1275
01:41:40,372 --> 01:41:41,535
Yeah.

1276
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:45,246
Wow!

1277
01:41:46,545 --> 01:41:47,873
Yeah.

1278
01:41:48,839 --> 01:41:51,246
Mamma mia.

1279
01:41:51,383 --> 01:41:52,877
Si.

1280
01:42:04,605 --> 01:42:06,893
- Who's takin' me?
- All right.

1281
01:42:08,066 --> 01:42:10,106
No, no, Marty. I'll get it.

1282
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:13,193
All right. Night, boys.

1283
01:42:13,655 --> 01:42:16,941
Good night, Sophie, dear.
See you tomorrow.

1284
01:42:17,075 --> 01:42:19,115
Take care, Wally.

1285
01:42:20,537 --> 01:42:23,573
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

1286
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,086
- What?
- The door.

1287
01:42:32,215 --> 01:42:34,255
Oh. Sure.

1288
01:42:35,218 --> 01:42:37,341
What a guy!

1289
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:44,175
Wally! It's Bob!

1290
01:42:55,697 --> 01:42:58,817
What's this?
I thought you took her home.

1291
01:42:58,950 --> 01:43:01,109
- Short ride.
- I'm in.

1292
01:43:01,661 --> 01:43:05,576
- But we're not even playin'.
- Shhh!

1293
01:43:12,255 --> 01:43:15,292
- She's not here.
- How you been?

1294
01:43:15,884 --> 01:43:19,964
- Hungry? I'll make you a plate of pasta.
- No, thanks, Angelo.

1295
01:43:20,096 --> 01:43:23,465
- She left?
- Oh, aye, it's two days now.

1296
01:43:28,063 --> 01:43:30,186
I've been thinkin'...

1297
01:43:32,359 --> 01:43:35,395
- The dedication's next week.
- Yes.

1298
01:43:36,154 --> 01:43:39,605
And, uh... it means so much to me.

1299
01:43:41,076 --> 01:43:42,486
And to Elizabeth.

1300
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:45,365
- Sure.
- Well, you've been workin' like a dog!

1301
01:43:45,497 --> 01:43:48,035
I miss Elizabeth.

1302
01:43:49,918 --> 01:43:51,744
I'll always miss her.

1303
01:43:53,213 --> 01:43:54,837
But l, uh...

1304
01:43:58,802 --> 01:44:01,672
I ache for Grace.

1305
01:44:03,056 --> 01:44:05,048
And I don't know if I can...

1306
01:44:06,684 --> 01:44:08,760
- I don't know if she...
- She can!

1307
01:44:08,895 --> 01:44:10,852
Shh!

1308
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:17,599
Here, Bob.

1309
01:44:18,529 --> 01:44:20,771
Come along with me a moment.

1310
01:44:30,917 --> 01:44:32,459
They'll be fine.

1311
01:44:35,546 --> 01:44:37,539
Angelo, siddown.

1312
01:44:37,674 --> 01:44:39,583
Stay loose, baby.

1313
01:44:43,137 --> 01:44:48,558
Only Gracie can tell you the name
of every flower in this garden.

1314
01:44:50,561 --> 01:44:53,681
I know no more than
one or two of them myself.

1315
01:44:54,607 --> 01:44:56,267
What's happening?

1316
01:44:57,068 --> 01:45:00,651
- He's got him in a choke hold. Holy shit!
- Oh, my God!

1317
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:05,193
- Marty, don't do it!
- What are you talking about?

1318
01:45:05,535 --> 01:45:10,695
Now, Robert...
This is none of my business.

1319
01:45:11,916 --> 01:45:16,708
I know that what's happened
has been... overwhelming.

1320
01:45:19,048 --> 01:45:22,583
And I know it's going to take you
a good while to sort it all out.

1321
01:45:23,886 --> 01:45:28,513
But while you're sorting, I want you
to remember that in all the times

1322
01:45:28,641 --> 01:45:33,267
I prayed that Gracie would have
a second chance at life,

1323
01:45:34,897 --> 01:45:38,598
I always knew that if God blessed us

1324
01:45:40,069 --> 01:45:43,153
the heart she got
would have to be from

1325
01:45:44,699 --> 01:45:47,699
a very special person

1326
01:45:49,328 --> 01:45:53,907
if it were going to be at home in Grace.

1327
01:45:56,877 --> 01:45:58,621
When she met you

1328
01:45:59,171 --> 01:46:02,457
her heart beat truly for the first time.

1329
01:46:03,926 --> 01:46:08,006
Perhaps it was meant
to be with you always.

1330
01:46:18,482 --> 01:46:21,567
O! Che bella bicicletta!

1331
01:46:23,445 --> 01:46:24,904
É sua?

1332
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:27,070
- It's mine, yes.
- Bella!

1333
01:46:27,783 --> 01:46:33,026
Ah! Ogni volta che si suona il campanello
agli angeli spuntano le ali!

1334
01:46:33,163 --> 01:46:35,121
Would you like to ride it?

1335
01:46:35,291 --> 01:46:37,616
- Si, si, prova.
- No, no.

1336
01:46:37,751 --> 01:46:39,791
Yes. Here.

1337
01:46:40,921 --> 01:46:43,377
- O no, no.
- Si, si.

1338
01:46:45,301 --> 01:46:47,340
Prova.

1339
01:46:47,803 --> 01:46:49,843
Uno soltanto.

1340
01:47:16,665 --> 01:47:20,116
Ma torna. Stai tranquilla, torna.

1341
01:47:20,252 --> 01:47:25,708
Si! Le piaceva tanto la bicicletta.
Era un amore...

1342
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:40,229
Tuo amor?

1343
01:47:42,357 --> 01:47:43,935
Si.

1344
01:47:51,783 --> 01:47:53,741
You came all the way to ltaly?

1345
01:47:54,411 --> 01:47:56,071
Yeah, I did.

1346
01:48:01,293 --> 01:48:03,001
I came all the way to ltaly.

1347
01:48:21,229 --> 01:48:23,436
I love you, Grace.

1348
01:49:06,983 --> 01:49:10,851
A lot ofyou have come up to me today

1349
01:49:10,987 --> 01:49:15,448
because you recognise me
from my photo in the monkey house.

1350
01:49:19,287 --> 01:49:24,079
But my sizeable donations
down through the years

1351
01:49:24,876 --> 01:49:27,996
is not what we're here to talk about.

1352
01:49:28,421 --> 01:49:33,167
Ladies and gentlemen - Bob Rueland!

1353
01:49:40,016 --> 01:49:44,678
Thank you for that introduction
and for your generous contribution.

1354
01:49:44,813 --> 01:49:48,312
I would like to thank everyone
who contributed time and energy.

1355
01:49:48,483 --> 01:49:52,397
My incredibly dedicated crew,
sitting right there.

1356
01:49:52,529 --> 01:49:57,570
And supervising veterinarian - my good,
my dear friend Dr Charles Johnson.

1357
01:49:57,784 --> 01:49:59,575
Hey, Charlie!

1358
01:50:00,829 --> 01:50:05,621
He apparently will be signing autographs
after the ceremony.

1359
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:09,415
The dedication ofthis new home
for Sydney and his family

1360
01:50:09,546 --> 01:50:12,083
holds great personal meaning for me.

1361
01:50:12,715 --> 01:50:17,377
My late wife Elizabeth
spent many years with Sydney.

1362
01:50:17,512 --> 01:50:21,510
She taught him... so many things.
She envisioned this for him.

1363
01:50:21,641 --> 01:50:26,137
She taught him sign language.
She introduced him to his wife.

1364
01:50:27,397 --> 01:50:29,852
But more importantly,

1365
01:50:29,983 --> 01:50:36,863
it was her uncompromising passion
that brings us here together today.

1366
01:50:38,241 --> 01:50:41,692
So it is with great honour

1367
01:50:43,579 --> 01:50:46,284
that I dedicate this new habitat

1368
01:50:46,416 --> 01:50:50,247
in loving memory ofElizabeth Rueland.

1369
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:18,272
Will everybody clear the dance floor

1370
01:51:18,406 --> 01:51:21,407
so that the bride and groom
may have the first dance.

1371
01:51:21,993 --> 01:51:24,780
Oh, what ifl loved you

1372
01:51:25,746 --> 01:51:28,451

01:51:32,837 --> 01:51:35,672

1375
01:51:37,008 --> 01:51:40,174

1376
01:51:40,636 --> 01:51:43,803

01:51:46,892 --> 01:51:49,562
Would you always be mine?

01:51:50,938 --> 01:51:53,061
What ifl kissed you

1380
01:51:53,733 --> 01:51:56,687
The way you like to be kissed?

1381
01:51:57,862 --> 01:52:02,987
What ifl held you in my arms
so close like this?

1382
01:52:04,827 --> 01:52:08,196
What ifl touched you tonight

1383
01:52:08,706 --> 01:52:11,493
And I filled your body with delight?

1384
01:52:11,959 --> 01:52:14,117
What ifl loved you?

1385
01:52:14,712 --> 01:52:17,417
Would you always be mine?

1386
01:52:45,117 --> 01:52:48,153
Oh, what ifl sang you

1387
01:52:48,954 --> 01:52:51,528
A sweet lullaby?

1388
01:52:52,666 --> 01:52:58,171
What ifl gave you a dozen stars
that I pulled from the sky?

1389
01:52:59,590 --> 01:53:02,626
What ifl told you tonight

1390
01:53:03,135 --> 01:53:06,089
I wanna love you
for the rest ofyour life?

1391
01:53:06,221 --> 01:53:08,428
What ifl loved you?

1392
01:53:09,016 --> 01:53:11,768
Would you always be mine?

1393
01:53:12,978 --> 01:53:15,551
What ifl loved you?

1394
01:53:15,689 --> 01:53:23,151
Would you always be mine?

1395
01:53:39,046 --> 01:53:41,038
Standin' at the corner

1396
01:53:42,007 --> 01:53:44,628
Waitin' for a ride

1397
01:53:45,886 --> 01:53:48,341
To carry me away

1398
01:53:50,974 --> 01:53:53,014
Thinkin' 'bout tomorrow

1399
01:53:54,269 --> 01:53:57,270
At the end ofthe day

1400
01:54:02,861 --> 01:54:05,186
I've walked through every fire

1401
01:54:05,864 --> 01:54:08,569
And measured every mile

1402
01:54:09,576 --> 01:54:12,696
To see how far I've gone

1403
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:16,866
And all that really matters

1404
01:54:18,085 --> 01:54:21,085
ls I carry on

1405
01:54:24,466 --> 01:54:26,791
And here I am

1406
01:54:28,595 --> 01:54:33,008
Like a soldier in the night, here I am

1407
01:54:34,935 --> 01:54:37,058
Ready for the fight

1408
01:54:38,063 --> 01:54:41,847
Oh, must be the master plan

1409
01:54:42,776 --> 01:54:45,693
Cos here I am

1410
01:54:50,367 --> 01:54:52,739
And do you ever wonder

1411
01:54:53,245 --> 01:54:56,448
Where the wind blows?

1412
01:54:57,415 --> 01:55:00,085
Where it all will end?

1413
01:55:01,378 --> 01:55:04,213
Some day I'll find the answers

1414
01:55:04,339 --> 01:55:09,713
And I won't be back again

1415
01:55:12,138 --> 01:55:15,009
And here I am

1416
01:55:15,934 --> 01:55:22,601
