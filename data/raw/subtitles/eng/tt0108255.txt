1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:50,091
A long, long time ago,
the earth was ruled by dinosaurs.

2
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:54,095
They were big, so not a lot of people
went around hassling 'em.

3
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,682
Actually, no people
went around hassling 'em
because there weren't any people yet.

4
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:02,145
Just the first tiny mammals.

5
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,439
Basically life was good.

6
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:09,361
- You know, it just don't get
no better 'n this.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:21,164
Then somethin' happened.
A giant meteorite struck the earth.

8
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,335
Good-bye, dinosaurs.

9
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,171
But what if the dinosaurs
weren't all destroyed?

10
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,800
What if the impact of that meteorite
created a parallel dimension...

11
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,345
where the dinosaurs continue to thrive
and evolve into intelligent...

12
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,848
vicious, aggressive beings, just like us?

13
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,394
And, hey!
What if they found a way back?

14
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,716
Hey, lady, what are you doing!

15
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,934
Koopa!

16
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,314
Welcome to Miraculous World...

17
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,901
where each week
we ask unanswered questions.

18
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,904
Today on our Miraculous World,
another dimension...

19
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,615
the universe next door.

20
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,243
An alternate world separated
by time and space...

21
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,871
and yet somehow joined
and contiguous with our own.

22
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,874
Mario Brothers Plumbing,
no leak too small.

23
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,586
Uh-huh. Uh-hu... no, no, no.
Don't touch it. No, no...

24
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,047
It's not a big problem.
Just leave it to the professionals.

25
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,341
When I looked around,
I was somewhere else.

26
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,469
- Another dimension, you mean?
- Sure.

27
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,139
- Another dimension,
the universe next door.
- Okay, we'll be right there.

28
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,141
Luigi!

29
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,853
We got a broken dishwasher
at the Riverfront CafÃ©.
You know what that means?

30
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,314
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We got work!

31
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,193
Oh, Mario, Mario,
right now on "Miraculous World,"
this guy just found out...

32
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,653
that he was in another dimension.

33
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,823
The only thing miraculous I know
is that we're still eatin'...

34
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:28,828
- while we're goin' broke.
- We ain't "goin'" broke, Mario.
We're already there.

35
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,581
Yeah?

36
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,709
Are you spendin' money
on this stuff? Look at this!

37
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,462
Yeah, but that's got the article about
the missing Brooklyn girls in it.

38
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,507
Oh, yeah? It's also got
one on the scientist...

39
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,010
- who turns brains into cheese.
- Yeah, well, you don't know.
It could happen.

40
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,430
How could that possibly happen?

41
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,433
Anything's possible, Mario.
You just gotta believe.

42
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,062
I do believe. I believe
the rent is three months overdue.

43
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,856
That's what I believe.

44
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,402
- Hey, turn left here.
- Fine, fine.

45
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,446
Left! I said left!

46
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,532
- What are you doin'?
- I don't know, Mario.

47
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,576
Just trust me, I got a good feeling
about this alleyway. I don't know.

48
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,747
- What?
- My instincts tell me
this would be faster...

49
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,625
Breathe in, big brother,
we'll get there.

50
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,627
Luigi!

51
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:22,257
You know, I read that sea turtles
navigate thousands of miles on instinct.

52
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,634
Not in New York traffic
they don't.

53
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,096
What're you complainin' about?
Come on, we're here, aren't we?

54
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,765
- You're getting worse.
- I'm gettin' worse?

55
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,269
How did we get into sea turtles?

56
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,024
- Faster. What'd I tell ya, huh?
- It's a miracle we made it alive.

57
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,943
I thought you didn't believe
in miracles, Mr. Tough Guy, huh?

58
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,783
Scapelli! They beat us to it again.
Another lost job!

59
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,870
One of Brooklyn's
largest construction projects...

60
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,748
has been ordered shut down
as university students...

61
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,668
continue their search
for dinosaur bones.

62
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,670
Head contractor Anthony Scapelli
is now arriving...

63
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,839
hoping to settle the dispute.

64
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,141
Hey, Mr. Scapelli!

65
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,649
- Who's in charge of this hole?
- It's him again.

66
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:30,116
- I'm the boss here.
- I'm Anthony Scapelli.
I'm the boss elsewhere.

67
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,496
My boys need to get back to work here.
How long are you gonna be diggin' up
these bones?

68
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,832
As long as our court order lasts,
Mr. Scapelli.

69
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,169
The university has explained to you
how important this site is.

70
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,839
But we'd be done here a lot sooner
if your goons would stop harassing us.

71
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:49,969
You look like a smart girl.
I bet you'll be done by tonight.

72
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,848
I know a lot of girls who've been
going missing in Brooklyn lately.

73
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,351
I'd be careful.

74
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,313
James, I'm gonna find a phone
and call the university.

75
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,232
All right.

76
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,026
Keep everyone digging
'til I get back.

77
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,714
They say it's dog.

78
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,841
Don't blow it this time.

79
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,388
There she is.

80
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,934
- Yeah, you sure?
- Two arms, one head, two legs.

81
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,937
Koopa's gonna kill us
if we blow it again. Let's get her!

82
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,733
Luigi, I told you to check the radiator.
Take it easy, will ya?

83
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,068
Relax, it's been makin' that sound all week.

84
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,405
Oh, come on, Luigi,
 you didn't tell me...

85
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,408
Oh, man!

86
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,081
Be careful, it's hot. Be careful. Whoo!

87
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,919
- Here we go.
- I'll do this.

88
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,088
- Go check the messages.
See if we got any work.
- All right. All right.

89
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,653
- I missed.
- Nice job!

90
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,781
Where're you goin'?

91
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,783
To get some water.

92
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,752
Hello, this is Al Bronsky...

93
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,921
from Al Bronsky's
Department Stores.

94
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,925
- I have a big flood over here. So get
all your plumbers. Get extra plumbers.
- Thanks.

95
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,593
Bring every plumber you...

96
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,930
Everybody's got tap water!

97
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,265
Three bucks!

98
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,394
- Any jobs?
- No.

99
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,358
Thank you.

100
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,615
Hi, it's Daisy.

101
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,536
Listen, we're gonna need
more security down here.

102
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,373
I don't care about the money. Scapelli's
down here making threats, and I...

103
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,792
She's beautiful, huh?

104
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,169
- Who?
- Her.

105
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,505
Her?

106
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,884
- She's nice. Go talk to her. Go on!
- No. I can't. I can't.

107
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,012
- Come on, go talk to her.
What's the matter with you?
- I don't know what to say.

108
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,305
Fine.

109
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,308
Bye.

110
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,946
- Here she comes. Here she comes.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

111
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,282
- For letting me use the phone.
- Oh, sure.

112
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,869
- And for the quarter.
- Are you okay?

113
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,164
I've got a few problems, but...

114
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,374
Well, you know, we got a van.

115
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,086
It's nice.

116
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,839
Yeah, well... No, no, I'm asking you
if you want a ride.

117
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,886
Oh, but, uh, it's broken.

118
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:23,558
- Well...
- Your name's Daisy, isn't it?

119
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,978
I overheard your name was Daisy.
You know, I haven't heard
that name around here.

120
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:30,231
It's really nice too. It's... No, I have
heard it, 'cause it's like the flower...

121
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,233
and everything, but...

122
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,362
Not that I hang around the flower shops
or nothin' like that.

123
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,865
What my brother is trying to say
is he doesn't know what to say.

124
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,368
Doesn't even know
how to begin, but...

125
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,246
he has offered you a ride, and
if it would help you out, please...

126
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,083
step into the van.

127
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,213
That might not be a bad idea.

128
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,425
Okay. Thanks.

129
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,095
- I thought it was broken.
- I fixed it.

130
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,696
Oh, here.
This is as far as we can go.

131
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,573
- I'll have to walk the rest of the way.
- Wait. W-W-Wait.

132
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,535
- Ma'am.
- Oh! Why, thank you, sir.

133
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,289
- Well, thank you for the ride.
- It's a pleasure to meet me.

134
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,333
I mean, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

135
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,170
- Dinner.
- Do you eat?

136
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,172
Yeah.

137
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,591
- Dinner?
- Sure.

138
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,469
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

139
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,556
Okay.

140
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,517
- At 6:00, all right?
- Be here.

141
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,103
Great.

142
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,105
Bye.

143
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,274
Bye.

144
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,027
What would you do without
 your big brother, huh?

145
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,029
Like to give it a shot
and find out.

146
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,197
- Ah, come on!
- I'm just about to ask her that.

147
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,701
You weren't about to ask her nothin'.
You was gonna let her go.

148
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,787
- Now she's gonna think
I'm a complete idiot.
- You're gonna see her tonight.

149
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,831
You'll impress her
with your manners.

150
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,876
Yeah, but why did you tell her
that I suck my thumb, huh?

151
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,632
So, now, let me get this
perfectly clear here.

152
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,344
What we're discussing is bones.

153
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,472
- Not exactly.
- Okay, so Scapelli blasted...

154
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,850
- Hey!
- through the bone and rock
and found what?

155
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,977
- Iridium.
- Oh.

156
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,021
Well, that's, that's unbelievable.

157
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:37,984
Well, it means that a meteorite hit here
a long time ago, and...

158
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:42,697
well, we think it could be what
destroyed all the dinosaurs.

159
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,533
Wow, there were
dinosaurs in Brooklyn?

160
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,912
Relax, Luigi.
There used to be Dodgers here too.

161
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,914
Hey, I got an idea.

162
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,916
Why don't you come on down
to the tanning salon...

163
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,126
and I can hook you up
with some free tans.

164
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,713
Bring a nice bathing suit.
Something strapless so you
don't get a tan line.

165
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,007
- And you want to take off that rock.
- Well, actually, you know...

166
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,427
I, I never take it off.

167
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,013
Well, I know it sounds weird,
but, I mean...

168
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,057
it's the only thing I have
from when I was found.

169
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,268
- Found?
- Oh, I was abandoned.

170
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:16,189
I grew up at St. Theresa's
on Fulton street.

171
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,442
You mean, you don't know who
 your mother and your father are neither?

172
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,195
No.
What do you mean "neither"?

173
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,199
'Cause Mario here brought me up.

174
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,536
- He's been my mother my whole life.
- Hey!

175
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,748
My father, my father! He's been my
father, my uncle, my brother, everybody.

176
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,135
Well, what are you two kids
gonna do tonight?

177
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,931
Well, we could take
the van back ourselves.

178
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,727
Um, if you're not doing
anything later tonight...

179
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,563
I would like to walk you home.

180
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,150
Okay.

181
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,786
- Spike! Spike!
- Iggy.

182
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,752
- Where're you going?
That's not the girl.
- I'm goin' to get the girl.

183
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,796
Yes, it is. She's wearing a disguise.
I can spot her a mile away.

184
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,342
Of course she's wearing a disguise.
She thinks she can fool us.

185
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,261
- I'm gonna go get her.
- I'm gonna go get her.

186
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,847
Wait a minute. We'll follow her,
and then we'll both go get her.

187
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,683
- Good idea. I bag her, you grab her.
- No, I grab her, you bag her.

188
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,685
- That's what I said.
- Exactly.

189
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,730
- This is the one.
- That's what you said
about the last four girls.

190
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,273
- I did?
- You did.

191
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,942
Outta my way!

192
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,154
You know, I just wanna say
one thing first.

193
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:50,116
I want to apologize right now, in case...
when I start to get talkin'...

194
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,952
and I start to say things
that sound really weird...

195
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,832
Uh, weird? Weird... Look, weird
is working in a bone pit all day.

196
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,878
And then spending your nights reading
about things that have been dead
for 65 million years.

197
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,381
- I mean, that is weird.
- Well, I... I find that fascinating.

198
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,509
And I mean... You know what,
if you just wanna end this right now...

199
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,679
- I would understand.
- You know, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

200
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,848
If, if you wanna end this right now
and you feel bad about that...

201
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,435
but you wanna talk to somebody
about it, you could call me.

202
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,023
You really think what I do
is interesting?

203
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,150
I think it's incredible.

204
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,364
Well, you know...
if you want...

205
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,408
I could show you.

206
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,411
I'd love you to show me.
Show me.

207
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,414
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Good night, okay?

208
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,583
Drive carefully.

209
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:59,102
Mario!

210
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,855
You don't stand a chance.

211
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,940
I won.

212
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,278
That's what you think.

213
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,240
Oh, that was sneaky.

214
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,409
We don't even have
any security here.

215
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,453
That's what I was calling
about on the phone today.

216
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,913
You see, I can't get the university
to give me any extra money.

217
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,915
- Is that why you were
talking about Scapelli?
- Yeah, well...

218
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,377
Scapelli was down here with his crew
blasting at the site...

219
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,796
and that's when
they found the fossils.

220
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,425
- Are you sure you know
where you're goin'?
- It's just ahead.

221
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,470
Is this your office or somethin'?
Doesn't it give you the creeps?

222
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:37,724
Well, it's more like a home.
I feel comfortable down here.

223
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,726
Comfortable? Okay.

224
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,064
- Well, this is it. Have a look.
- Wow!

225
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:48,109
Awesome!
Oh, check this out!

226
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,363
These are all strange new species.

227
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,491
Look at this one.
The way the bones fit here...

228
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,743
and the opposable thumb.

229
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,747
It's almost as if... he was a monster
trying to be a human being.

230
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,295
It's beautiful.

231
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,469
You're beautiful.

232
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,981
- Oh, my... Hey! Hey!
- Hey, you guys!

233
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,526
- It's the ScapellisÂ!
- Oh, no!

234
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,528
Well, what did they, they do?
What've you got down there?

235
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,322
They're destroying everything.
Is it the sump pump?

236
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,366
Thank God you're here! I mean...

237
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,868
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you're a plumber, right?

238
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,621
Oh, yeah.

239
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,124
Well, I don't know exactly what to do.

240
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,711
- Mario, Scapelli's floodin' the site!
- We need your help.

241
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,840
- Scapelli?
- Yeah.

242
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,301
Strap your belt on, kid.
We're goin' in.

243
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:59,806
Scapelli's been trying to force us out
ever since we got here. It's sabotage.

244
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,393
Down here! Hurry!

245
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,396
- This way!
- Allow me. I'm a professional.

246
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,399
- Looks like the bottom one, right?
- Yeah.

247
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,493
- One and 1/16, open-ended.
- One and 1/16, open-ended.

248
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,758
Wrong again. How many times
have we got this wrong?

249
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,303
- You've gotten it wrong five times.
- "O" for five, "O" for five.

250
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:42,557
- What percent is that?
- I don't know. Let me think.

251
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,271
I don't know,
but it's not good.

252
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,066
If we get it wrong one more time,
he's gonna kill us.

253
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,735
He's not gonna kill us.
He's not that nice.

254
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:57,238
Up ahead. It's her.

255
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,574
I sense her.

256
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,910
I definitely know it's her.

257
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,248
Basin wrench.

258
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,876
- Basin wrench.
- Great.

259
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,632
- Here. Hand.
- Hand.

260
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,469
Now, does this guy know his stuff,
or does this guy know his stuff, huh?

261
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,931
- Okay, you ready?
- Saywhen.

262
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,434
Let's go... now.

263
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:29,270
Scapelli's just an amateur.

264
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,161
Daisy? Daisy, where are you?

265
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:48,790
Daisy! Answer me! Daisy, where are you?
Come on, let's go this way.

266
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:53,003
- No, no. No, it's this way.
- Come on, let's go this way.

267
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,005
- That's the echo.
- How do you know?

268
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,174
- I've been listening to pipes
all my life. Come on.
- Okay, come on.

269
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,386
Daisy!

270
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,848
Luigi, this is a mistake. It's a dead end.
Come on, let's turn back.

271
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,267
- Okay, then you go back.
- Luigi, please.

272
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,562
- Give me the light.
Come on, give me the light.
- Luigi!

273
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,023
Daisy?

274
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,275
Luigi, you see how deep that is?
Get back.

275
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,777
- Lean back!
- The light!

276
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,113
Let it go!

277
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,657
Oh, God!

278
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,118
Hold on to me.

279
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,079
Daisy?

280
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,623
Daisy?

281
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:34,002
- Watch it.
- Luigi!

282
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,131
You see that?

283
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,009
Help me!

284
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,221
Daisy! Is that you?

285
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,518
Luigi!

286
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,729
- No!
- Luigi!

287
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,315
- Daisy?
- Get off of me!

288
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,485
No!

289
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,873
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, did you?

290
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,753
That's solid rock!

291
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,633
- I got a feelin'.
- No, Luigi, forget it.

292
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,260
- I gotta go with it.
- Forget it, it's rock.

293
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,971
Look down there. Luigi!

294
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,015
Luigi!

295
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,685
I don't believe this.

296
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:12,100
- Mario!
- I disintegrated. Am I still here?

297
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,436
- What is this place?

298
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,980
There she is, come on!
Come on, let's go, run!

299
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,233
- Where are you taking me?
- Back to where you belong.

300
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,318
- No, you're hurting me!
- I'm gonna kill'em!

301
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,155
No, you're not gonna kill'em.
Not if I get there first.

302
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:29,034
I'm gonna break every bone in their body,
and then I'm gonna kill'em.

303
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,036
I'm really gonna kill 'em.

304
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,751
- Help me!
- Daisy, I'm coming!

305
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:40,170
- Get off of me!
- Excuse me.

306
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,589
- You better not hurt her!
- Help!

307
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:48,303
Grade-A Express
to Koopa Canyon!

308
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,347
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

309
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,349
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

310
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,476
Gentlemen,
the Koopa Union is cancelled.

311
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,812
- Passengers transfer at Koopa Square.
- Get out of my way!

312
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:22,504
Where the hell are we?
This is crazy!

313
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:26,925
We went under the river, but this can't
be Manhattan. Where is this place?

314
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,344
I don't know, I ain't been
to Manhattan in a couple of weeks.

315
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:32,389
Must've been
a bad couple ofweeks.

316
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,392
- No!
- There she is!

317
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,977
- Daisy!
- Luigi?

318
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,522
- Daisy!
- Luigi!

319
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,732
- Mario!
- We're coming!

320
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:46,403
- You better not hurt her!
Somebody, do something!
- Hey!

321
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,406
- No stalling up traffic. Move along!
- Somebody stop her! Daisy!

322
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,409
- Are you a cop, or what?
- Come on, get off me, man!

323
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,336
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, yeah.

324
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,673
- You're the one without the patent.
- Yeah, well, you're the old one.

325
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:13,722
- Oh, my God! Look at that!
- Get outta here! Watch out!

326
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:17,392
- Excuse me.

327
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,396
- This stuff's sticky.
- Yuck!

328
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,115
- Hey.
- Get away from my baby!
Get away from my baby!

329
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:36,453
- What is this place? This is crazy!
- I don't know.

330
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:39,372
- Where are we?
- I don't know. Maybe we
got knocked unconscious...

331
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,208
for a hundred years, and we woke up in
the Manhattan of the future.

332
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,336
Maybe the Bronx of today.

333
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:48,048
- No wonder they tell you
never to come up here.
- Mario, I got a feelin'.

334
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:52,052
- I got a feelin' we're
not in Brooklyn no more.
- Where're you goin'? Hey!

335
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,811
Look at this place.
Pathetic. It gets worse every day.

336
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,397
- It's disgusting.
- The humans on the other side...

337
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:08,443
have a world full of resources
ready for the taking.

338
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:12,655
- Imagine an endless supply of food...
- I know.

339
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:16,409
Clean air, water...
and what are we stuck with?

340
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,913
This... pit hole...

341
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:23,792
germs everywhere, fungus.

342
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:27,754
Sixty-five million years...
we've been exiled here...

343
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,632
after the meteorite struck...

344
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,595
while mammals roam free
in the other dimension.

345
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,473
Well... not for long.

346
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,435
When you get your rock.

347
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,354
When I get the princess.

348
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,315
- Princess?
- I need the rock...

349
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:50,360
and the Princess Daisy.

350
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:54,989
I'll finally be able to merge ourworld
with theirs and get rid of the mammals!

351
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:58,618
Yes, it's everything you've hoped for,
everything you've worked for.

352
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,206
- Excuse me, cousin.
- Hello, morons.

353
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,208
- Hello.
- Hello.

354
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,837
I captured the princess.
She's being de-fungused. 

355
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,506
- But I took her through the gateway.
- I recognized her.

356
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,592
He couldn't tell
one mammal from another.

357
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:18,680
Good. Now... where's the rock?

358
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,727
- Rock, sir?
- Rock, sir?

359
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,688
The meteorite piece that
she wears around her neck...

360
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,690
and I told you not to forget it!

361
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,860
- That rock.
- I told you not to forget it!

362
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,863
And I told you to remind him!

363
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,991
Without that piece
the meteorite lays dormant.

364
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,535
I'll not be able
to merge the dimensions.

365
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,954
Where is it?

366
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:48,335
- The plumbers took it.
- Plumbers?

367
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,837
Plumber alert.

368
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,840
- Plumber alert.

369
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,842
That's right.

370
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:58,428
The Koopa man is looking
for a couple of plumbers.

371
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:02,432
And there's a big coin reward,
2,000 gold Koopa coins.

372
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,435
Guess he must have
a serious plumbing problem.

373
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:10,899
Fried tweeter, only 20 Koopas.
Enjoy your spiny burger here.

374
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:16,488
Hey, fried tweeter, only 20 Koopas.
You like little wigglers?

375
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:19,991
Hey, listen. If we're gonna eat
in this place, we're gonna have
to be very, very hungry.

376
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,160
Excuse me, excuse me, Miss Lady,
can you tell me where I am?

377
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,287
Yeah, you're in my way,
egg suckers.

378
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,081
Who are these people?

379
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:30,543
- Are you boys new here in town?
- Lady, we're lookin' for somebody...

380
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,379
- and we're from Brooklyn.
- Yeah.

381
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,256
You know, boys, it's very dangerous
here in this neighborhood.

382
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,134
- You shouldn't wander
around without a weapon.
- Yeah.

383
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:41,429
- You got one?
- No.

384
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:44,766
All right.
Get'em up, suckers!

385
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:47,227
Koopa coins! I need Koopa coins!

386
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,483
- Well, this oughta do...
- D-D-Don't touch that!

387
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,611
- just fine!
- That's not even ours!

388
00:28:56,695 --> 00:29:00,240
- Hey!
- Let me go!

389
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,617
What are you d... Put me down!

390
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,672
Bats!

391
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:27,142
Um, you wanna give us
the rock back, lady?

392
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:31,521
Come and get it, big boy.

393
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:02,260
Hey! Hey, guys! Cheer up!

394
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,512
Things could get worse.

395
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:08,558
# Ain't got no water anywhere #

396
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,561
# Food's bad, so's the air #

397
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:15,607
# Got no resources
in a great big stupor #

398
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,819
# All because of
the evil King Koopa #

399
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,948
You know the law, Toad.

400
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,868
Hey, wait a minute. You can't
arrest a guy for just singin' a song.

401
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,454
For anti-Koopa songs, we can.

402
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:32,582
Plumbers!

403
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,835
- He is. I'm just apprenticing.
But I didn't do anything!
- Get in the car!

404
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,714
Are you tellin' us that you can
arrest a guy for bein' a plumber?
Get outta here!

405
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:43,176
- Get in there, plumber! Now!
- Hey, what is this?

406
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:46,096
- What did we do?
- I'm gettin' arrested
for bein' a plumber!

407
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:49,307
Write his number down!

408
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,938
- Stop pushing me!
- Is that Daisy?

409
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:59,734
- Daisy. Daisy! You too! Daisy!
- Daniella? Daniella!

410
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,570
- Are you okay?
- What's going on?

411
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:05,740
I don't really know.
There's this guy, his name is Koopa.

412
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:09,202
And he's lookin' for this princess.
I guess none of us here fit the bill.

413
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:12,247
You boys ain't
from around here, areya?

414
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,290
- Brooklyn.
- Brooklyn.

415
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,770
Hey, what're you doin'?

416
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,319
- Name?
- Mario.

417
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:46,322
- Last name?
- Mario.

418
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,825
- Okay, what's your name?
- Luigi.

419
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,245
- Luigi Luigi?
- No, Luigi Mario.

420
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,749
Okay, look! How many Marios are there
between the two of you?

421
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:59,336
There's three.
There's Mario Mario and Luigi Mario.

422
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:03,298
Mike! Mike!
Help these Marios around the side.

423
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,676
Stop pushin' me around.

424
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,678
Prepare to be de-fungused.

425
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:11,139
I'm not goin' in there!

426
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,767
Hold still.

427
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,811
It's cold!

428
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:19,522
What is this?

429
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,782
Let's go, move it!
Come on! That way, let's go!

430
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,784
What was that?

431
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,703
The fungus unit.
The fungus is choking the city.

432
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,789
- Come on, move! Move!
- Oh, come on!

433
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:38,166
- Give me a break, man.
- Okay, through the gate!

434
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,877
Through the gate!
Move it! Go! Go!

435
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:44,297
Let's go! Go! Come on!

436
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,510
Hey, Mario, look.
I grew an inch.

437
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:55,016
Hey, what's that?

438
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,560
What's that red... Oh, my God!

439
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:00,397
Oh, no!

440
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,736
Oh, no!

441
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,410
Are we dead?

442
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:17,580
# How, how, how #

443
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:21,710
# Sitting here
in a cramped detention#

444
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:25,046
# With brothers
from another dimension #

445
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:29,050
# Thinkin' about my sur... ##

446
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,219
Say, what's another word
that rhymes with "dimension"?

447
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:34,389
- Yeah, "tension."
And I'm full of it, so shut up.
- Wait a minute!

448
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:37,350
What did you mean "another dimension"?
Did you mean like...

449
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:40,854
- our worlds have crossed over
or somethin' like that?
- Sure, kid.

450
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:44,232
You know, according to history,
a long time ago a big meteorite came...

451
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:47,902
- and blasted our universes
into parallel dimensions.
- Yeah.

452
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:51,072
You know what else I think?
All that fungus out there.

453
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:55,994
That's our old king. It's true.
But he's been de-evolved.

454
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,621
That's right. He's been
de-evolved into fungus, and now...

455
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:01,958
- he's wreaking his revenge on the city.
- Mario Brothers!

456
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:06,338
Yeah, that's us! You better get a lawyer
and get us outta this chicken coop.

457
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,132
- Yeah, me too!
- You got one.

458
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,470
- Let's go. Come on.
- Just let me do the talking.

459
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:16,056
Shut up!

460
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:22,354
Boys, boys... sit down.

461
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,898
How's prison?

462
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:32,822
You look like hell. I'm, uh...

463
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:36,701
Larry Lazard, of Lazard, Lazard...

464
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:40,163
Conda, Dactyl, and Cohen.

465
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:43,750
Who sent you?
Are you from the city?

466
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:46,795
No, I'm from that,
uh, little part of all of us...

467
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:50,006
that can't stand to see
someone else in need or pain.

468
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,677
Yeah, I'll bet.
Wh-Who's this Koopa clown?

469
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,680
We gotta talk
to that goofball now.

470
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,182
I don't think
 you wanna do that.

471
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:02,018
- Why?
- Why not?

472
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:06,439
- That Koopa clown...
- Yeah?

473
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:10,985
is one evil,
egg-sucking son of a snake.

474
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:14,739
Now...

475
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:18,159
where is that meteorite piece?

476
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,789
The what?

477
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:36,344
- You know what I'm talking about!
- Hey, hey, hey!

478
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:39,764
No one touches President Koopa.

479
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,519
You're Koopa?
Well, you just said you were one...

480
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:47,897
One evil, egg-sucking
son of a snake.

481
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:50,734
Did I lie?

482
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:54,487
Take these two plumbers...

483
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,740
to the devo chamber.

484
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:59,075
- I'm all right.
- Come on.

485
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:05,623
What a lousy chamber...

486
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:08,001
ever since Koopa took over.

487
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:12,922
And you, Koopa!
You're a lousy leader!

488
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:17,010
One thing I cannot stand
is naysaying.

489
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:20,889
Simon, de-evolve him now.

490
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:23,725
De-evolve.

491
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,686
- Cretaceous.
- Our old king!

492
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,898
You tried to get rid of him,
but the king is everywhere.

493
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:33,401
- You can't get rid of him.
- See you later, alligator.

494
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,445
Ever!

495
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:43,370
You may think of evolution
as an upward process.

496
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,956
Things evolve from primeval slime...

497
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,834
up to single-cell organisms...

498
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:53,463
up to... intelligent life.

499
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:57,717
De-evolution, of course,
works the opposite way.

500
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:01,471
Back to simpler forms. For instance...

501
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:04,140
even our musical friend, Toad...

502
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:09,062
can become... a loyal child
of the royal family.

503
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:13,900
Goombas, ah!

504
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,447
- Why'd you do that to him?
- Hey, no, no!

505
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:22,283
Not now, not now.

506
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:27,288
What single-cell organism
did you evolve from?

507
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:31,876
Tyrannosaurus Rex, the lizard king,
thank you very much.

508
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,046
Goomba.

509
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,176
Whereas my evolution was wonderful
and sweet, your de-evolution...

510
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,762
will be a living nightmare
if you don't tell me...

511
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,806
where that meteorite piece is.

512
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,976
That's Toad?

513
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:51,062
Yes. Loyal...

514
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:54,899
lethal...

515
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,193
and stupid.

516
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:03,033
Goomba, walk tall.

517
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:06,953
Be proud. Go, Goomba!

518
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:10,623
Join the Goombas.

519
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,971
Guards, guards,
arrest these plumbers!

520
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:29,351
- De-evolve.
- You're goin'back...

521
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:33,271
- where you belong, lizard.
- Help me! Help me!

522
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:35,315
- Keep going. Got it?
- Got it.

523
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:40,028
Yeah! Let's get outta here!

524
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:47,410
I'll kill that plumber!

525
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:55,877
We're back in
the police station!

526
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:03,468
Hey, Mario, look at this. These little
mushroom things on the fungus.

527
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,721
Great! A building
with athlete's foot!

528
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,061
Hey, look at that.
What is that?

529
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:15,647
Goombas!
Come on, let's go!

530
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,400
Well, look! It was trying
to give us that thing.

531
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,861
- Swing. Keep swinging.
- Okay.

532
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:25,073
- I'm swinging, I'm swinging.
- Just keep hanging. Close your eyes.

533
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,992
Hey, hey, hey, look what he's doing!

534
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,537
Hang on.

535
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,874
Hey, man, this is fun!

536
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,549
- Get ready. Get ready.
- What was that?

537
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:44,926
I'm ready, I'm ready! 

538
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:55,103
Now!

539
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,272
All right, which door?

540
00:39:57,313 --> 00:40:00,316
- Okay, my instinct tells me this one.
- Come on, come on.

541
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,778
Let's go in this one. 

542
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,905
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

543
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,659
- Let's get outta here!
- Here we... Okay.

544
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:13,455
- They got us! What're we gonna do?
- Number one.

545
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:16,624
- We steal this car.
Number two. I'm driving.
- All right.

546
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,793
- Help me, man!
- Come on!

547
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:24,841
Hey, wait for me!
Don't take off!.

548
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:27,427
- Okay.
- Let's see what I got over here.

549
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,263
Now where's the starter
on this thing?

550
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,098
I got a feeling about this,
Mario-rooni.

551
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:33,725
I can't believe
 you can do that.

552
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:36,936
Comes from sittin' on my butt all day
playing video games.

553
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,481
Got it!

554
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:43,318
- Let's get outta here.
- Let's hit the bricks.

555
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:11,638
Security alert.
Stand by for special bulletin.

556
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:13,640
Mario, look!

557
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:17,894
- You look terrible!
- You don't look so good yourself.

558
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:20,855
Alien species escaping from police detention.

559
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:24,984
- Aliens? We gotta deal with aliens too?
- Luigi, we're the aliens.

560
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,821
We are? Whoa, cool!

561
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,878
- Hey, Mario, you're
going the wrong way!
- How would you know?

562
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:46,798
- Trust me.
- Huh!

563
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:50,510
- You're driving like a maniac!
Would you watch it?
- You wanna drive?

564
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,392
- I'm not riding with you anymore.
- Okay, you drive.

565
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:59,561
No, what are you doing?

566
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:06,276
- How're you steering this?
- I'm not.

567
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:17,412
I hope the guy downstairs
knows where we're going.

568
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:25,962
Yeah, hey!
This is drivin'!

569
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,798
Cool, Mario.

570
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,602
Brace yourself! Now!

571
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:49,444
All right!

572
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:05,460
Which way?

573
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:07,504
- Take the parkway.
- Right.

574
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:14,094
Perfect. Perfect.

575
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:17,305
- You said the parkway.
- I know, but I wanted the tunnel...

576
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:21,142
so I said parkway 'cause I knew
 you'd go the opposite way I suggested.

577
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,615
Hey, watch it!
What're you doing?

578
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:38,827
Warning.
Leaving power grid. Powering down.

579
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:41,287
I can't stop this thing.
I can't see where I'm going!

580
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:43,289
Look out, Mario!

581
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,875
- Hit the brakes! Do something!
- There are no brakes!

582
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:50,005
- This fungus is gonna kill us!
- We're gonna hit the end
of the tunnel! Look out!

583
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,655
Hey, was that superior
drivin' skills or what?

584
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:18,533
Let's get outta here before
this fungus stuff eats us alive!

585
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,910
Hey, the fungus just saved us.

586
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:24,247
What're you talkin' about?
It was my drivin' that saved us.

587
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,750
It wasn't your driving.
That tunnel just sneezed us out.

588
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,711
And then this giant booger caught us
in the air. That's what saved us.

589
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:33,089
Ah, come on!
Let's get outta here.

590
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,928
- You there! Excuse me, sir.
- Sorry.

591
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:44,017
Sir! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to disturb you.

592
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,479
But the plumbers, they're in the tunnel.
They're on their way to the desert.

593
00:44:47,562 --> 00:44:52,233
What are you doing here instead of
being in the desert heading them off?

594
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:55,695
That's exactly what I told him, sir.
Exactly what I told him.

595
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:59,657
Between you and me, Spike hasn't got
a thought in his brain, sir.

596
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:01,826
He's a liar, sir.

597
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:05,121
Between us, Iggy doesn't have
a brain in his head.

598
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,916
- I agree.
- They're your relatives.

599
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:10,919
- Wait outside!
- We'll wait outside.

600
00:45:11,002 --> 00:45:13,755
- You blew it.
- You, Lena, bring me the princess.

601
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:16,883
And have her cleaned up.

602
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:20,428
Do you know
what I love about mud?

603
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:24,808
It's clean and it's dirty
at the same time.

604
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,729
The princess.

605
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:51,501
- Are you here to help us?
- Hardly.

606
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,966
Now let me guess
which one of you...

607
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:01,136
is Daisy.

608
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:07,642
Princess Daisy.

609
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:11,980
- Princess?
- What?

610
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,693
- Princess Daisy?
- This is gettin' weird.

611
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:21,948
You have your mother's eyes.

612
00:46:26,786 --> 00:46:29,205
Come with me.

613
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:41,301
Good-bye, Spike.
I'm gonna miss ya.

614
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,389
Have a nice trip.
See ya next fall.

615
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:50,727
Evolve. Advanced.

616
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:57,359
Good choice, cousin. I always thought
he'd make a great Goomba.

617
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:04,199
Bye, Spike.

618
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:22,008
Ah, our not-so-benevolent
dictator, as it were.

619
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:29,599
- Ignatius, do you know what
the square root of 26,481 is?
- What are you talking about?

620
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:32,519
- One-hundred ninety-one.
- What?

621
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:34,771
What are you doing? Not me.
No, no, not me, cousin!

622
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:37,691
Not me! Spike!
Help me, Spike!

623
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:40,735
Perhaps ifl could just
make you idiots smarter...

624
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:44,572
- you won't screw up this time.
- Please, not me. Not me, cuz. No.

625
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:47,575
No-o-o!

626
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,913
Oh, my.

627
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,918
How peculiar.

628
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,963
That's quite an agreeable
transmogrification.

629
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:03,967
- More like a... transfiguration.
- Ah! A super-metamorphosis.

630
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,052
- Huh?
- Enough!

631
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:08,596
- Both of you go to the desert!
- Excuse me, excuse me.

632
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,932
That hardly seems logical,
does it?

633
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,476
Perhaps we should stay
and formulate our own strategy.

634
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:16,438
Tete-a-tete, inner circle,
that sort of thing.

635
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:19,983
Here's what's logical to me.

636
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:24,237
If you do not return
with the plumbers and the rock...

637
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:29,576
I shall personally kill you.

638
00:48:31,536 --> 00:48:33,329
- We're going.
- After you, Ignatius.

639
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:48,511
- It was your mother's.
- What do you know about my mother?

640
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:53,099
She was quite an inspiration...
to some.

641
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:58,146
When Koopa took over, she stole the rock
and smuggled you to the other side.

642
00:48:58,229 --> 00:49:00,148
Then she died.

643
00:49:02,233 --> 00:49:04,652
What about my father, is he alive?

644
00:49:04,694 --> 00:49:07,322
It depends on what
 you mean by living.

645
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:10,200
- What are you talking about?
- Listen to me.

646
00:49:10,283 --> 00:49:14,662
I don't care
whose daughter you are.

647
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:19,167
Koopa thinks you're the only one
who can merge the dimensions.

648
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:23,838
I've waited too long
to let all this slip away.

649
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:35,392
- Well, you said the tunnel.
- I did not!

650
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:38,103
- I said parkway!
- But you meant the tunnel.

651
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,105
Go on, pick a direction.

652
00:49:40,188 --> 00:49:42,482
Any direction you like.

653
00:49:42,565 --> 00:49:46,903
Hey, that looks good. Over there, huh?
That's it. Let's die there.

654
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:50,699
Are the Goombas training with
the hand-held de-evolution gun?

655
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,743
- As we speak, sir.
- Excellent.

656
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:58,832
After the merge it will be nice to see
the humans de-evolve, won't it?

657
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,252
What is it that they come from?
I keep forgetting.

658
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:06,131
- It's mice or something.
- Apes, sir. Monkeys.

659
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:09,592
Disgusting mammals.

660
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:13,763
Your princess is here.

661
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:19,102
Well, my, my. Looks like you got up on
the wrong side of the nest this morning.

662
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:13,490
- You're a...
- Go ahead and say it.

663
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:17,035
Dinosaur.

664
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:20,538
Yoshi is a pet of the royal family.

665
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:23,792
You may pet him.
Just, uh...

666
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:29,047
don't move your hands around
like a small wounded animal.

667
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:32,676
You must be the Great Koopa.

668
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:35,553
That I am.

669
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:38,348
Ruler of all that you see.

670
00:51:38,431 --> 00:51:42,143
A few...
miserable streets and...

671
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:44,354
endless desert.

672
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:49,150
You've done a lovely job.

673
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:51,861
Well...

674
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,823
thank you.

675
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,575
Where's my father?

676
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:09,337
He's around.

677
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:12,382
You are so fresh.

678
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:15,885
And so clean.

679
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,556
Don't fight it.

680
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:23,768
You know you've always been
uncomfortable in the human world.

681
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:28,523
And you've at least suspected
that you were...

682
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:30,567
different.

683
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,361
I've suspected a lot of things.
But not that I...

684
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:37,866
That you descended
from the dinosaurs.

685
00:52:37,907 --> 00:52:40,452
And you know what they say...

686
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:42,579
about little girls, don't you?

687
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:45,707
No.

688
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,543
They say they never forget...

689
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:52,088
the first time they're
kissed by a lizard.

690
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:59,387
Take her away.

691
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:03,266
I'll need to... use her later.

692
00:53:07,562 --> 00:53:09,773
Throw back.

693
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:21,951
Plumbers. Affirmative!

694
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:24,329
Come, come, come, quickly!

695
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,957
- Quickly, after them, cousin!
- I'm with you, cousin.

696
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:32,295
Go forward!

697
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:34,297
That way, cuz!

698
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:39,052
Go right! Go right!

699
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,561
In the name of King Koopa.

700
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:50,939
- We arrest you!
- Surrender immediately!

701
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,693
If you two don't start talkin'...

702
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:57,487
we gonna leave ya
to these guys... for lunch.

703
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,572
- Now, where's Daisy?
- No, no, no.

704
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:03,284
- Where's the rock, scalawag?
- Where's Daisy, butt breath?

705
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:05,328
Where's the rock,
overweening rogue?

706
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,997
- Not until you give us
Daisy, biscuit head!
- Where is the rock?

707
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:10,208
Shut up!

708
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:15,213
Now, what's with this rock?

709
00:54:15,296 --> 00:54:17,215
The rock is a piece
of a special meteorite...

710
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:20,677
which was chipped off
upon impact 65 million years ago.

711
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,805
Once this rock is reinserted
into the meteorite...

712
00:54:23,888 --> 00:54:26,474
our two dimensions will reunite
and we will become one.

713
00:54:26,516 --> 00:54:29,310
And our cousin, Koopa, shall become
ruler of both our worlds.

714
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:31,354
I don't get it.

715
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:34,649
- Why didn't he come through before
like you clowns?
- You fools!

716
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:38,361
It's been sealed off for years
until someone on your side
blasted it open again.

717
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:42,115
Scapelli.

718
00:54:42,198 --> 00:54:44,868
What if we get you the rock?
Will you get us Daisy?

719
00:54:46,536 --> 00:54:49,330
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yes...

720
00:54:49,372 --> 00:54:51,875
I think that proposal would
mutually benefit both our parties.

721
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:55,420
- Okay, now, hand over the rock.
- Someone took it.

722
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:58,840
By the bar. That lady with
the red spikes who mugged us...

723
00:54:58,882 --> 00:55:02,510
- Was she corpulent? Very corpulent?
- No, she's just really round.

724
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:07,724
Ah-ha! Big Bertha,
the bouncer at the Boom Boom Bar!

725
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:32,624
Hey. Don't do that.
You'll hurt yourself.

726
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:50,975
I guess we're both
prisoners here, huh?

727
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:57,649
Look!
We'll hijack a sludge gulper...

728
00:55:57,732 --> 00:55:59,693
- and drive into the city!
- Then what?

729
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:02,570
First we get the rock, then
we'll take ya to Daisy in the tower.

730
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,494
Get your wrench.

731
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:11,746
Oh, man,
I lost all my tools!

732
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,582
Come on, let's go.

733
00:56:30,306 --> 00:56:33,226
Come on! What are you waitin' for?

734
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:03,214
It's clear.

735
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:06,259
- We did it! We did it!
- Yeah!

736
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:10,805
- I'm brilliant!
- For mammals, you guys
are quite acceptable.

737
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:22,984
- Isn't this a little bit feminine?
- It was my ex-wife's.

738
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:25,028
But you wear this stuff?

739
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:28,156
- Yes, on occasion we have a date.
- Who do ya date, a canary?

740
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:34,829
#'Tain't no big thing#

741
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:39,709
# To wait for the bell to ring#

742
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:43,046
#'Tain't no big thing#

743
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:46,549
# The toll of the bell#

744
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,760
Here, bring the tags back.
Thank you.

745
00:57:48,843 --> 00:57:52,514
# Aggravated, I stare for days #

746
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:56,685
# I stroll downtown
to the red light place #

747
00:57:56,726 --> 00:58:00,939
#Jump up, bubble up
what's in store #

748
00:58:01,022 --> 00:58:04,859
- # Love is the drug
and I need to score #
- Look for the red spi kes.

749
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:09,030
# Show him out, show him out
hit and run #

750
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:13,118
# Boy meets girl
where the beat goes on #

751
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:17,539
Hi. You're looking for those plumbers?

752
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,042
Well, I think I spotted 'em.

753
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:23,420
My friends...

754
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:26,214
- to the downfall of Koopa.
- The sooner, the better!

755
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:31,386
- There she is.
- Where?

756
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:33,638
Up there.

757
00:58:35,223 --> 00:58:37,475
Leave this to me.

758
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,478
No woman can resist
the charm of a Mario.

759
00:58:44,649 --> 00:58:47,569
Hey! The name's Mario!

760
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:52,115
I'm your main man. Your "ram-a-dame,"
 your can of "spaim."

761
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:56,786
You all right? You okay?

762
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:03,585
Maybe she's a little shy.

763
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:10,592
Excuse me.
Will you hit me again?

764
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:13,803
I've never seen such fluidity.

765
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:17,766
The way your knuckles crunch...
as you smack them into my face.

766
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:23,772
Dance with me.
I'll hit you all you like.

767
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:27,609
- All right.
- That's it, Mario. Go, Mario.

768
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:39,621
# Do do do do do do #

769
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:46,961
# I wouldstop the world
for you, babe #

770
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:51,633
- # Stop #
- # I would stop the things I do #

771
00:59:51,716 --> 00:59:58,473
# Ifl knew you loved me too #

772
00:59:58,556 --> 01:00:02,018
# I would change
my whole world over #

773
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:06,815
- # Stop #
- # I would fade my history #

774
01:00:06,898 --> 01:00:13,822
# If I could see
 your future with me now #

775
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:18,493
# White lies should
open the dark room baby #

776
01:00:18,576 --> 01:00:23,498
# Blue skies don't last forever #

777
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,919
# Sunshine's so
hard to believe in baby #

778
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,463
# I would stop
the world for you #

779
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:34,843
# If I knew you loved me too #

780
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:40,515
- # Stop #
- # Sure love you baby ##

781
01:00:43,935 --> 01:00:46,354
You did it!

782
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,743
What are we gonna do?

783
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:04,372
- Here it is. Buttonhook, scramble
and right fake, okay?
- Yeah.

784
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:07,042
Get them.

785
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:10,962
Seven, 24, hut!

786
01:01:12,922 --> 01:01:16,509
# I walked the dinosaur#

787
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:21,473
# I walked the dinosaur #

788
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:23,725
# Open the door
get on the floor #

789
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,602
# Everybody walk the dinosaur #

790
01:01:25,685 --> 01:01:27,687
# Open the door,
get on the floor #

791
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,731
# Everybody walk the dinosaur #

792
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:33,234
- # Open the door get on the floor #
- Liberate! It's not too late!

793
01:01:33,276 --> 01:01:35,487
- She's got the rock!
- We'l I get it later!

794
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:38,031
# Everybody walk the dinosaur #

795
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:44,245
# Goom-goom
lock-a lock-a lock-a goom #

796
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:45,747
# Goom-goom lock-a lock-a
goom-goom #

797
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:50,460
# I met you in a cave
 you were paintin' the walls #

798
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:02,347
- How we gonna get outta here?
- Use the stom pers.

799
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:06,184
- Here?
- Put in a cartridge.
Click your heels together.

800
01:02:06,267 --> 01:02:08,728
These?

801
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:11,147
Overhere, pudgybuns.

802
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:15,443
- There's no time for that now! Come on!
- Thanks.

803
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:39,217
Look, look! Look, another one!

804
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:44,472
Wait, wait, Mario, I think
it wants me to take it.

805
01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:47,517
Stop fiddlin' with the fungus
and let's get outta here.

806
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:53,481
- There they are!
- Get'em!

807
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:57,360
- Cops! Daisy!
- Goombas! The rock!

808
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:01,906
The tower!

809
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:05,326
- A sludge-gulper! Jump!
- Okay!

810
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:10,498
What a way to go
to Koopa's tower.

811
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:14,669
- You wanna wait for a bus?
- How we gonna get in there?

812
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:17,630
I got two words for you:
"im," "possible."

813
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,632
Nothing's impossible, Mario.

814
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:22,844
Improbable, unlikely,
but never impossible.

815
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:25,180
I hope you're right.

816
01:03:42,405 --> 01:03:44,366
My, my.

817
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:48,244
You have let yourself go!

818
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:53,124
You see?
I'm not such a bad guy.

819
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,585
You always wanted
to be everywhere.

820
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:59,089
Well, now you are.

821
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:02,550
I wanna tell you something.

822
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:07,305
You can go ahead and choke this
little mushroom kingdom all you want.

823
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:11,184
'Cause I'm outta here!
I'm out into the bigger world.

824
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:15,647
I got a couple of plumbers bringin' me
the rest of the meteorite.

825
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:18,733
Soon to be dead plumbers.
And by the way...

826
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:23,571
you really oughta try to pull yourself
back together again.

827
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:27,617
Slime bucket.

828
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:46,136
Oh, my God.

829
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:48,513
Daisy's in there
somewhere. I know it.

830
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:51,266
But where do we start?

831
01:04:51,307 --> 01:04:54,477
Python Pizza here. May I help you?

832
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:57,105
- King Koopa here.
- Ah, yes, sir.

833
01:04:57,188 --> 01:05:00,191
- I'd like the Koopa Special.
- Pterodactyl tail on that?

834
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:05,864
Yes. Dino, lizard, hold the mammal,
no worms... and, uh, spicy.

835
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:16,124
Walk in.

836
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:32,807
Look at this.
It's a plumber's nightmare.

837
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:35,435
These pipes haven't
been serviced for years.

838
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:37,979
Must've been a nonunion job.

839
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:47,322
Luigi, lock off all these valves.

840
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:49,824
- What?
- It's the heating system.

841
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:56,581
Treat your tools like a friend:
keep'em by ya...

842
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:59,459
never let'em down
and they're always at your side.

843
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:02,379
Hey, Mario, how come it is
that for every situation...

844
01:06:02,462 --> 01:06:04,381
ya always got a saying
about tools, huh?

845
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:08,385
- I got'em from Papa.
- He got'em from Grandpapa.

846
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:12,097
We'll freeze'em.
Keep'em busy while we make our way up.

847
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,099
How can we do that?
We can't just take an elevator.

848
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:16,226
We gotta do something.
We tripped the alarm.

849
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:20,355
- What do you think I am, stupid?
- Yes. How we gonna get up, huh?

850
01:06:20,438 --> 01:06:23,400
Like Marios.

851
01:06:28,738 --> 01:06:31,908
Ingeniously! Come on.

852
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:43,753
Look out.

853
01:06:51,594 --> 01:06:55,932
- You're ingenious, Mario, ingenious.
- Shut up.

854
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:09,070
Iggy and Spike have been preaching
 your overthrow at the Boom Boom Bar.

855
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:12,490
Really? I am very disappointed
in you, cousins.

856
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:15,201
- Fascist!
- Oppressor of the proletariat!

857
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:17,954
- Guy in charge.
- Egg sucker.

858
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:20,498
- Kill them.
- We need to talk.

859
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:24,002
- I want you.
- This is hardly the time
and place for that, Lena.

860
01:07:24,085 --> 01:07:26,463
I didn't mean that. What I mean is
I think we can do this together.

861
01:07:26,546 --> 01:07:29,215
- I think I can help you.
- I have just found out...

862
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:32,344
that I have saboteurs
in the tower.

863
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:36,097
I still do not have the meteorite piece.
I'm about to lose everything.

864
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:40,101
We can talk about this later
if later even occurs!

865
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:44,481
- What you care about is her.
- What I care about...

866
01:07:44,564 --> 01:07:48,818
is the future of our species!

867
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:52,614
Very well then.

868
01:07:52,655 --> 01:07:58,286
If not with you,
then on my own.

869
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:15,011
- Now what are we gonna do?
- I don't know. What?

870
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:22,602
- Listen.
- # Out of the long ago #

871
01:08:22,686 --> 01:08:25,355
- What?
- # Warm as #

872
01:08:25,438 --> 01:08:27,357
- # The wind#
- Trust me.

873
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,818
# Soft as the kiss #

874
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:32,487
- # Of sun #
- What are ya...

875
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:36,574
#'Til then my sweet#

876
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:40,829
# Think of me now and then #

877
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:45,166
# Godspeed my love #

878
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:48,044
#'Til you are mine again #

879
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:51,256
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

880
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:16,698
Eat it.

881
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:23,538
For me?

882
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:26,249
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Oh?

883
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:28,793
I don't eat anything with a face.

884
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:34,090
I am kinda hungry, though.

885
01:09:34,174 --> 01:09:37,385
- Any chance of a plate
of steamed vegetables?
- Oh, yeah!

886
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:40,555
Am I interrupting?

887
01:09:43,767 --> 01:09:47,228
Out.

888
01:09:48,813 --> 01:09:51,232
Bye.

889
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:55,362
Lena, look, I know
 you don't want me here.

890
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:57,989
So maybe...

891
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,452
I like this room, don't you?

892
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:06,790
It used to be my office until I...
got promoted.

893
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:09,918
Koopa needed me close by,
 you see.

894
01:10:11,252 --> 01:10:14,172
Lena, will you help me
get out of here?

895
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:18,426
Well, I think yes.

896
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,262
I'd love to get you out of here!

897
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:23,431
- Why are you doing this?
- Because everyone...

898
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:26,101
deserves what they've earned.

899
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:29,938
And I've earned this.

900
01:11:19,237 --> 01:11:21,531
Ten-hut!

901
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:26,036
Forward, march!

902
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:38,673
Vegetables.

903
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,973
- You!
- Yes, it's us!

904
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:48,975
Your Most Royal Highness, please!

905
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:51,353
- Is it possible you could
assist us in escaping?
- Help!

906
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:53,396
- Help!
- We're on your side! Please, princess!

907
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:59,194
Help!

908
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:03,198
Spikeasaurous, follow me!

909
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:08,161
- Where are you going?
- I have to help him.

910
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:13,708
Stand still.

911
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:17,879
- You stay, I'll go.
- Okay, I'll stay, you go.

912
01:12:17,962 --> 01:12:19,881
- You stay, and I'll go.
- Okay, I'll go.

913
01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:23,093
- Allow me.
- I hope he's all right.

914
01:12:23,176 --> 01:12:26,346
Princess Daisy, we've always been
 your "loyalest" supporters.

915
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:28,932
- We've been with your father
since his demise.
- My father?

916
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:32,060
- What do you know about my father?
- Come with us!

917
01:12:38,274 --> 01:12:40,235
- You tell her.
- No, I think you should tell her.

918
01:12:40,276 --> 01:12:42,237
All right, we'll both tell her.

919
01:12:42,278 --> 01:12:45,198
Daisy, I think this may come
as something of a shock.

920
01:12:45,281 --> 01:12:49,994
Daisy, may I present to you...
 your father.

921
01:12:52,205 --> 01:12:56,084
- The fungus.
- Koopa's first victim of...

922
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:58,086
de-evolution.

923
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:00,130
This is my father?

924
01:13:00,213 --> 01:13:03,091
Yes.

925
01:13:03,174 --> 01:13:08,304
- Perhaps at this moment of delicacy...
- A delicate moment.

926
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:10,849
- A retreat is in order.
- An ordered retreat.

927
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:15,687
- Those that fight and run away...
- Live to fight...

928
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:18,815
another day.

929
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:24,529
How did you know
they'd do that?

930
01:13:24,612 --> 01:13:26,781
'Cause everybody
loves to dance, that's why.

931
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:30,493
A dancin' lizard's like
dancin' crocodiles... Oh!

932
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:33,997
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, man.

933
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,292
Oh. Oh, I hate heights.

934
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,294
How we gonna get across?

935
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:42,297
- I can make it. I got a good feelin'.
- You're not gonna jump?

936
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:45,216
Come on, somebody's gotta do it.
We don't got no other choice, right?

937
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,969
- Luigi, this is curtains for us.
This is not Miraculous World!
- I-I gotta go for it!

938
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:49,971
Luigi!

939
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:58,146
I'm flyin', Mario, I'm flyin'!

940
01:13:58,188 --> 01:14:02,108
Come on, come on, I told you.
All you had to do was trust. Come on.

941
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:04,319
Just do it, come on.
Just have faith. J ump.

942
01:14:04,402 --> 01:14:05,862
You're flyin'.

943
01:14:05,945 --> 01:14:08,448
Come on, Mario, come on.
Just trust. J ump! Come on.

944
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:11,701
- Okay, okay, I ju...just... yeah, okay.
- Come on, come on.

945
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:16,498
No, no, wait, Mario.
Don't jump, no! It's not...

946
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:19,000
I'm not flyin'! It's just a... hook. 

947
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:23,004
Mario!

948
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:26,549
- Luig...
- Oops. Sorry.

949
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:29,511
- Mario, I gotcha!
- Luigi!

950
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:31,930
Ah! Luigi, I'm alive!

951
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:35,016
Good catch, huh, Mario?
I should try out for the Yankees!

952
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,354
I'd high-five ya,
but then you'd be an only child.

953
01:14:39,437 --> 01:14:41,272
Come on,
let's go get Daisy.

954
01:14:41,356 --> 01:14:45,110
- Let's swing it over there. Yeah. Okay.
- Pull with me.

955
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:53,743
My father?

956
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:57,706
What have they done to you?

957
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:01,543
Can you even hear me?

958
01:15:11,928 --> 01:15:14,472
Yoshi!

959
01:15:16,057 --> 01:15:18,226
Oh, look what she did to you.

960
01:15:57,474 --> 01:15:59,434
- Mario?
- Daisy?

961
01:15:59,476 --> 01:16:02,771
Luigi? Mario?

962
01:16:02,854 --> 01:16:05,398
It's Daisy!
Daisy, we're comin'!

963
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:11,488
Let's get ya outta this.

964
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:13,948
Luigi? Mario?
Can you hear me?

965
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:19,120
- Daisy, where are you?
- I'm in Devo Four.

966
01:16:19,162 --> 01:16:21,956
Daisy.

967
01:16:26,002 --> 01:16:29,172
- Oh, man, it's cold.
- It's workin'. It's freezin' up.

968
01:16:29,255 --> 01:16:31,508
- Great.
- Boy.

969
01:16:33,093 --> 01:16:35,762
- Hey, M-Mario, did you see that?
- What?

970
01:16:35,845 --> 01:16:40,475
It's tryin' to communicate.

971
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:44,729
Luigi, it's a mushroom.
Come on.

972
01:16:57,992 --> 01:17:01,037
Luigi! Here! Come back!

973
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:04,749
- There she is.
- In here! This way!

974
01:17:07,585 --> 01:17:10,839
Good news, sir. The troops are in place,
ready to de-evolve the mammals.

975
01:17:10,922 --> 01:17:15,385
In place ready to what? Now?
Who ordered their deployment?

976
01:17:15,468 --> 01:17:19,723
You did, sir. Lena relayed the command.
We carried it out immediately.

977
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:23,101
Lena.

978
01:17:23,184 --> 01:17:27,188
She has the rock.
Arrest her!

979
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:29,190
- Daisy!
- Luigi, oh!

980
01:17:29,274 --> 01:17:31,317
Later, let's get outta here.
This place is crawling alive...

981
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:33,737
- with giant lizards, come on!
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Listen.

982
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:36,906
I know this is gonna sound
a little strange, but...

983
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:40,577
I want you to meet...

984
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:43,371
my father.

985
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:48,835
Come on. Dad!

986
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:56,593
- Oh, man.
- Well, at least he was my father.

987
01:17:56,676 --> 01:17:59,763
He used to be the leader here
until Koopa turned him into...

988
01:17:59,846 --> 01:18:02,766
all this... fungus.

989
01:18:02,849 --> 01:18:06,061
- Oh, man.
- It's an honor to meet you, sir...

990
01:18:06,102 --> 01:18:10,815
and a pleasure, and I just, just wanna
thank you for all your help.

991
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:14,402
Come on, Luigi, you be talkin'
to the mildew in the shower next.

992
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:17,030
But, Mario, don't you see, it's been
tryin' to help us all along.

993
01:18:17,113 --> 01:18:19,783
Giving us the little things
when we were hanging.

994
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:21,993
Come on, he wants
to clobber Koopa too.

995
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:26,039
- Oh, how's Daniella? Is she all right?
- Daniella?

996
01:18:26,122 --> 01:18:28,208
I promised to take her
to Wrestlemania.

997
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:31,127
You mean, you don't know?

998
01:18:32,128 --> 01:18:34,130
What?

999
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:38,134
She's in the Goomba barracks
on the 51st floor.

1000
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:47,894
- Come on, Daisy, come on!
- Hi-de-ho, mammals!

1001
01:18:47,977 --> 01:18:49,938
Goomba!

1002
01:18:49,979 --> 01:18:52,315
If you touch her I'll kill you!

1003
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,110
I'll meet you in the playground
after school.

1004
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:57,362
You murderer!

1005
01:18:57,445 --> 01:19:01,950
Now, your father's still...
hanging around, isn't he?

1006
01:19:02,033 --> 01:19:04,577
Prepare for the invasion!

1007
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:09,040
And ready the troops.
We're going down.

1008
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:14,295
Station closing.
Military personnel only.

1009
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:18,633
Station closing.
Military personnel only.

1010
01:19:18,675 --> 01:19:24,222
Hey, you. Open up!

1011
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:27,726
Restricted area.
No unauthorized personnel.

1012
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:29,728
Restricted area.

1013
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:33,064
No unauthorized personnel.

1014
01:19:41,865 --> 01:19:44,117
Hello, Lena!

1015
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:47,162
Greetings from Koopa!

1016
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:49,205
Ah, the rock.

1017
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:52,542
Yeah, we get some blankets.
- Yeah, we're freezin' our, our...

1018
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:55,253
Look, the point is
we're freezin' here.

1019
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:57,255
They are not gonna believe
this at work.

1020
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:59,382
This is a violation
of our civil liberties.

1021
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:03,011
Can't you get somebody
to fix the heating?

1022
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,654
How can they let us suffer like this?

1023
01:20:21,738 --> 01:20:25,325
- What are they,
completely cold-blooded?
- Yes, moron. They're reptiles.

1024
01:20:25,408 --> 01:20:28,495
Well, just because they're
reptiles, doesn't mean...

1025
01:20:28,578 --> 01:20:30,538
they can't show some
basic human decency.

1026
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:43,551
- Angelica, come here.
- What?

1027
01:20:43,593 --> 01:20:47,639
Okay, don't say anything, but
my boyfriend, Mario, is right up there.

1028
01:20:47,722 --> 01:20:50,058
What?

1029
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,435
Hi, Mario!

1030
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:54,604
He'll get us outta here!

1031
01:20:58,108 --> 01:21:01,403
He-e-e-e-e-y, ya!

1032
01:21:01,444 --> 01:21:04,489
- Oh, Mario, I knew you'd come for me!
- You betcha.

1033
01:21:04,572 --> 01:21:06,491
- Yes! You did it!
- Honey, listen.

1034
01:21:06,574 --> 01:21:09,077
Get that mattress, the Goomba mattress.
Take it over there.

1035
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,414
Come on, girls, get the Goomba mattress.
Pick it up, get that side.

1036
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:17,210
Move it, move it! Hey! Hey!

1037
01:21:17,293 --> 01:21:19,254
- It's heavy.
- Come on, bring it over here.

1038
01:21:19,295 --> 01:21:21,381
Very good!

1039
01:21:21,464 --> 01:21:25,552
- Hurry!
- Hey, you must be the girls,
the missing girls from Brooklyn!

1040
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:27,637
Yeah, except for Angelica.
She's from Queens but she's all right.

1041
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:31,516
I'm freezin' my butt off here. There's
cold air comin' from that airvent.

1042
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:34,769
Yeah, we froze the pipes.
We're goin' for a little ride.

1043
01:21:34,811 --> 01:21:36,855
Hail Koopa.

1044
01:21:43,153 --> 01:21:46,698
Sir, I believe
 you were looking for this.

1045
01:21:53,705 --> 01:21:56,624
Excellent. Release Lena.

1046
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:59,961
Princess! Ready to help me
destroy humankind?

1047
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:02,464
Muster the Goombas!

1048
01:22:02,547 --> 01:22:07,385
Handout the de-evolution
guns. Prepare for destiny!

1049
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,639
Where's my pizza?

1050
01:22:51,596 --> 01:22:54,015
- Goombas!
- Goombas!

1051
01:22:58,186 --> 01:23:02,148
Down! Duck! Now!

1052
01:23:24,212 --> 01:23:27,215
Gotcha!

1053
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:40,645
Devo guns ready?

1054
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:09,132
Are you all right?

1055
01:24:09,215 --> 01:24:11,426
- Are they all right?
- Right.

1056
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:15,889
- Mario-roni!
- Daniella!

1057
01:24:15,972 --> 01:24:18,767
Too late, humans!

1058
01:24:18,808 --> 01:24:22,062
- Sir, your pizza's here.
- Not now.

1059
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:24,606
Looks like I win.

1060
01:24:24,647 --> 01:24:27,776
Soon you and everyone
in your world...

1061
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:31,154
- will all be de-evolved into...
- Sir? Sir?

1062
01:24:31,237 --> 01:24:34,240
- What is it now?
- The Goombas are dancing again.

1063
01:24:34,324 --> 01:24:37,327
Deal with it!

1064
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:40,955
Will be de-evolved into...
monkeys. Ha!

1065
01:24:48,004 --> 01:24:50,924
Gimme that.

1066
01:25:01,685 --> 01:25:03,895
Die, plumbers!

1067
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:06,940
Work, work, work, work!

1068
01:25:07,023 --> 01:25:09,651
- Take my tools
and get outta those handcuffs.
- Here, hold this.

1069
01:25:09,734 --> 01:25:12,987
- Mario! Take my belt.
- What?

1070
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:18,576
Trust the fungus.

1071
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:22,747
Look out!

1072
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:28,128
All right!
Yeah, heh-heh!

1073
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:35,844
Where are you?
Where are you?

1074
01:25:56,072 --> 01:25:59,242
Yes!

1075
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:05,040
You wanna rock,
I'll giveya a rock.

1076
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:18,136
Where's the rock?

1077
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:20,680
You lookin' for this?

1078
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:24,225
Give it to me.

1079
01:26:24,309 --> 01:26:27,729
Gimme that rock, you monkey.
That's mine!

1080
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,106
Give it to me!

1081
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:34,235
- I'll show him...
- We've gotta stop her.

1082
01:26:34,277 --> 01:26:36,863
- Come on, girls, let's go.
- Who are you?

1083
01:26:36,946 --> 01:26:39,824
Luigi Mario.
What, you got a problem with that?

1084
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:41,493
- I don't got a problem.
- No.

1085
01:26:41,576 --> 01:26:45,497
Okay, come on, let's go.

1086
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:51,252
My time is come!
The universe is mine!

1087
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:55,423
Die, die, you mammal!
You give me that rock!

1088
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:20,448
My time has come!

1089
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:23,618
And the rock will merge
our two dimensions. Lena, don't!

1090
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,954
You're too late.

1091
01:27:26,037 --> 01:27:31,126
You see, I do have the power
to merge the worlds, Princess.

1092
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:33,753
- It's not too late.
We've gotta stop her.
- All right.

1093
01:27:33,837 --> 01:27:35,797
Come on, girls,
come on, let's go!

1094
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,967
- Where are we going?
- Back from where you came.
Come on, move it, this way!

1095
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:45,974
Come and get it, lizard breath!

1096
01:27:50,228 --> 01:27:53,732
- It's a B-bomb!
- He's got a B-bomb!

1097
01:27:55,358 --> 01:27:59,154
B-bomb?

1098
01:28:23,094 --> 01:28:26,014
Messed up again, mammal.

1099
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:38,360
All right. Come on.
Come and get it.

1100
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:42,697
Come on. Come on, ruffle head,
let's see what you're made of.

1101
01:28:51,247 --> 01:28:53,208
- Don't look down. Don't look down.
- Get outta my way!

1102
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:55,377
- Go on. You've gotta get
through and tell everybody!
- Go!

1103
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:59,047
Go back to Brooklyn. Tell'em about
the invasion and the Goombas!

1104
01:29:00,674 --> 01:29:03,218
Good luck, Luigi!

1105
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:06,388
It's incredible!

1106
01:29:15,897 --> 01:29:17,899
Yikes.

1107
01:29:17,982 --> 01:29:20,527
Man, she sure makes
an impression.

1108
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:25,615
That's what Koopa meant.

1109
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:27,909
Only I can withstand the force.

1110
01:29:27,992 --> 01:29:31,246
- Come on.
- No!

1111
01:29:31,329 --> 01:29:34,624
I-It's jammed in.
I can't get it.

1112
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:38,920
Luigi, we've gotta stop it.
We've gotta get it out.

1113
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:42,507
Grab on to me!

1114
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:47,762
Come and get it.

1115
01:29:56,354 --> 01:29:58,982
It's melting.

1116
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:05,363
We're merging.
You don't have the rock!

1117
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:09,617
You filthy mammal.

1118
01:30:14,205 --> 01:30:19,753
We're merging!

1119
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:25,675
I'm gonna drill it out!

1120
01:30:25,759 --> 01:30:28,136
- Gimme the wheel puller.
It looks like a corkscrew.
- This?

1121
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:34,059
Hold on to me, all right?

1122
01:30:39,272 --> 01:30:42,734
Look!
It's Koopa's tower!

1123
01:30:42,817 --> 01:30:44,778
Those guys'll do
anything for publicity.

1124
01:30:50,533 --> 01:30:52,494
Mario?

1125
01:30:55,288 --> 01:30:58,416
It's Brooklyn! My world!

1126
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:02,003
Gimme that devo gun.

1127
01:31:06,508 --> 01:31:10,053
- He's trying again?
- What is this?

1128
01:31:13,515 --> 01:31:15,558
Monkey!

1129
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:19,020
Scapelli?

1130
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:33,702
Boss! What'd they do to you?

1131
01:31:33,785 --> 01:31:37,789
And now,
I'm gonna make a monkey...

1132
01:31:37,872 --> 01:31:39,833
- outta you, plumber.
- Trust the fungus.

1133
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:51,886
What? No!

1134
01:32:14,075 --> 01:32:16,453
B-bomb!

1135
01:32:23,877 --> 01:32:26,212
Take a gun. Go.

1136
01:32:26,254 --> 01:32:28,882
- What are you doin'?
- It's okay.

1137
01:32:28,923 --> 01:32:32,218
- He's a friend.
- Here. Go!

1138
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:44,814
Mario!

1139
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:50,111
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1140
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:06,670
Stupid!

1141
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:14,010
Plumbers!

1142
01:33:20,642 --> 01:33:22,727
You plumbers!

1143
01:33:23,978 --> 01:33:27,440
Duck!

1144
01:34:21,953 --> 01:34:25,040
See ya later, alligator!

1145
01:35:07,749 --> 01:35:09,918
- Need a lift?
- What?

1146
01:35:10,001 --> 01:35:13,672
- Come on, get on my feet.
- Oh, right.

1147
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:37,278
Oh, Luigi, Mario.

1148
01:36:03,888 --> 01:36:07,183
Oh, I'm back.

1149
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:10,061
Love those plumbers.

1150
01:36:26,244 --> 01:36:28,204
It's solid.

1151
01:36:36,463 --> 01:36:39,716
All right.
Come on, let's go.

1152
01:36:39,799 --> 01:36:43,720
I can't.

1153
01:36:43,803 --> 01:36:46,306
You mean, you wanna stay?

1154
01:36:46,348 --> 01:36:48,725
Until we can get things
settled here and...

1155
01:36:48,808 --> 01:36:51,144
I can get to know my father.

1156
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:55,023
Come on, Daisy, you know
how I feel about you, right?

1157
01:36:55,106 --> 01:36:57,650
I wanna be with you.

1158
01:36:57,734 --> 01:37:02,364
I do too, but... I can't.

1159
01:37:02,447 --> 01:37:06,701
She's tryin' to tell ya she can't leave
here until she knows where she belongs.

1160
01:37:06,743 --> 01:37:10,038
And if you loved her,
 you'd understand that.

1161
01:37:12,665 --> 01:37:15,877
And ifl had any sense,
I'd mind my own business.

Bye.

1166

Are these the sounds
of a music that comes to us...

1167
01:38:19,357 --> 01:38:21,609

Courageously crossed
the dimensional bridge...

1176

the missing Brooklyn girls...

1177
01:38:44,174 --> 01:38:46,509

You gotta come with me.
I need your help.

1184
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:09,407
- Why? Wh-Wh-What's wrong?
- You're never gonna believe this.

1185
01:39:09,491 --> 01:39:12,035
- I believe it.
