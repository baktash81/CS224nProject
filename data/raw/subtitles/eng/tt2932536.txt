1
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:04,769
- Shark got you.
- Are you serious? Look what you did.

2
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:05,979
I'll get you a new one.

3
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,106
Can we please do something?
I'm so bored.

4
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,732
I could just lie in the sun all day.

5
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:12,819
No, I'm gonna go back to the room.
I told Stuart I'd give him a call.

6
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,698
Bring me a drink back.
Thank you.

7
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,117
- Yeah, you wish.
- Nice ass.

8
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:49,105
I want to make a toast.
Come on!

9
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,567
Thank you so much
for bringing me on vacation.

10
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,694
It's gonna be
the best time ever.

11
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,070
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

12
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:59,032
- Thanks for coming.
- Stuart is missing out.

13
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,452
- I'm way more fun anyway.
- You are.

14
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,370
Yeah.

15
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,271
Lisa?

16
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,363
Lisa?

17
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,336
Sis?

18
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:01,094
Hey.
What are you doing?

19
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,101
What's wrong?

20
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:12,772
I lied.

21
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,274
What are you talking about?

22
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:18,695
I lied about
why Stuart isn't on this trip.

23
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:21,030
- What?
- He's not working.

24
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,907
What do you mean?

25
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:29,122
He left me, Kate.
He broke up with me.

26
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,332
Oh, my God.

27
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,920
- Why didn't you tell me?
- 'Cause I was embarrassed.

28
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:39,048
Do Mom and Dad know?

29
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:47,765
The one good thing in my life,
I managed to fuck up.

30
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,603
What happened?

31
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,315
It's my fault. He got bored.

32
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,945
- He actually said that?
- Yeah. Kind of, more or less.

33
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:04,490
And then I thought if I came on
this trip and I came away with you,

34
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:07,368
and I had fun and I showed
that I could be fun,

35
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:08,995
somehow he would come back, but...

36
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,049
Come on.

37
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,509
- What?
- Come on, we have to get dressed.

38
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:26,304
- For what?
- You and I are going out.

39
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,891
Going out where?
It's 1:0Ø in the morning.

40
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,601
Lisa, it's Mexico.

41
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:33,770
You and I are the only ones
who aren't out. Come on.

42
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,646
I've been dying
to do this all week.

43
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,777
This is the best night ever.
Oh, I could be here all night!

44
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:04,527
<i>That is crazy. You guys are insane.</i>

45
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,987
<i>Seriously, you have to try.</i>

46
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,156
We do it almost every weekend.
It's amazing.

47
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:11,033
Yeah, yeah. Look, 25-foot
great white sharks.

48
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,451
They come right up
to your cage.

49
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,429
- Twenty-five foot?
- You have never seen anything like it.

50
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,705
How much does it cost?

51
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:17,999
What?

52
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,753
<i>Bueno.</i> It's like $100 each.

53
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,481
We-we know Taylor.
He's like a friend of ours.

54
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,800
- Great.
- Uh, mmm... I don't know.

55
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,361
What are you gonna do,
sit by the pool all day long?

56
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,097
- Seriously?
- I-I don't even know how to dive.

57
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:35,016
I will teach you everything
you need to know.

58
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,561
But I need one of those,
like, diving card certification.

59
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,939
- You took that whole class!
- Okay, okay, look, look.

60
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:45,318
This is Mexico okay?
It's not even diving.

61
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:47,820
You're gonna be in a cage.
You're only down five minutes.

62
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,488
- It's totally safe.
- Exactly.

63
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,550
It's like you're going to the zoo,
except you're in the cage.

64
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,534
- Yeah, and... and underwater.
<i>- Sí.</i>

65
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,703
Come on, it sounds amazing. Please?

66
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:58,080
I don't know.

67
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,707
You could just think of the photos.

68
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,544
I mean, they won't be the type of photos
that a boring person would take.

69
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,421
Just saying.

70
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,774
She's got a good point.

71
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,118
- Think of the photos.
- Think of the photos.

72
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,177
Okay.

73
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,598
- All right.
- Okay.

74
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:16,891
- Cheers.
<i>- Salud.</i>

75
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,434
<i>Salud.</i>

76
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,400
Well, good, I am pleased.

77
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,261
Yeah, I just wanted to say I had
a really good night tonight.

78
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,531
Me, too.

79
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:33,824
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

80
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,374
Sorry.

81
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,292
Not... ready.

82
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,502
Thank you.

83
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,230
- No, it's okay. It's fine.
- See you tomorrow.

84
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,880
- Tomorrow for sure.
- Come on.

85
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,799
Oh.

86
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,042
- Good night!
<i>- Buenas noches.</i>

87
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,760
<i>Adios.</i>

88
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:08,025
- I'll see you tomorrow.
<i>- Sí.</i>

89
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,944
<i>Adios. Buenas noches.</i>

90
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:12,446
They are so cute.

91
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,158
Oh, cute. Hey<i>. Hola.</i>

92
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:20,830
I am so looking forward to this.
It's gonna be amazing.

93
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,915
I can't believe
you talked me into this.

94
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,769
I did not talk you into this. Okay,
you just wanted to see the guys again.

95
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,044
I did not.

96
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,504
Do not lie to me.

97
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,464
Okay, he's kind of cute.

98
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:31,674
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

99
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,846
- Kate, I don't know about this.
- It'll be fun. I promise.

100
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:39,473
It... they're probably
not going to show anyway, so...

101
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,392
<i>- Hola, chicas!</i>
- Hey!

102
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,893
- Hey, <i>hola!</i>
- How's it going?

103
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:43,978
<i>- Hola.</i>
- Hi.

104
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,063
<i>- Hola.</i>
- Hey, how are you?

105
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:49,775
I'm so glad you came.
I wasn't sure you were going to.

106
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:51,944
Yep, here we are.

107
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:53,863
Okay, should we do it?

108
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,426
- Yeah, let's go see the boat.
- Okay.

109
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,575
- Go ahead...
- Oh, you lead the way.

110
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,701
Okay.

111
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:02,288
- So, uh, how did you sleep?
- Uh, I slept all right.

112
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,091
- I had a really good time last night.
- Me, too. You guys are funny.

113
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,518
- How is your head?
- Uh, it hurts.

114
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,045
Okay.

115
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,814
All right, we're gonna go talk to
the captain. Be back in a second.

116
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:11,839
Okay.

117
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:15,259
I... really, I feel
super uneasy about this.

118
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:18,929
- Come on, it'll be fine.
- I mean, is this even safe?

119
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,365
We don't know anything
about these people.

120
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,766
Remember what the concierge said?

121
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,452
That we should book
all activities and tours...

122
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:26,228
Yeah, he works for the hotel.
He has to say that.

123
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:30,274
I've just heard horror stories about
tourists going on these shady trips.

124
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:32,985
- And Stuart even told me that...
- Stuart is a prick, Lisa.

125
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,239
It'll be fun. Come on.

126
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:38,508
Hey, come on over. Don't be shy.

127
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,533
- Come on.
- Okay.

128
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,160
This is, uh, Taylor, the captain.

129
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,704
<i>- Hola. Hola.</i>
<i>- Hola.</i>

130
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,331
<i>Buenos días.
¿Cómo están?</i>

131
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,041
<i>- Bien.
- Bien.</i>

132
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,628
You both know how
to scuba dive, right?

133
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,254
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

134
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,714
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:59,011
All right, well, welcome aboard.

136
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,805
Okay.

137
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:06,352
<i>Ah, gracias.</i>

138
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,648
I know you're clumsy,
so don't fall in, okay?

139
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,288
There she is.

140
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,167
<i>Oye, Javi.</i>

141
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,594
Watch your step.

142
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:41,929
Here we are.

143
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,412
<i>Gracias.</i>

144
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,683
Okay.

145
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,773
Oh, no.

146
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,152
- Here...
- Kate, have you seen the cage?

147
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,879
Put those tanks in the back,
keep them out of the sun.

148
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:01,031
Relax. You're gonna have
the time of your life, I promise.

149
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,908
It'll be fun!

150
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,786
I'm scared.

151
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,142
This looks like the spot.

152
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,694
- All right.
- This is it?

153
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,696
- Yeah.
- This is totally it.

154
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,948
Really?

155
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:29,262
This is going to be amazing.

156
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,082
It's feeding time.

157
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,209
- You hungry? Huh?
- Ugh, it's disgusting.

158
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,378
- No.
- Hmm? No?

159
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,214
- You hungry? Huh?
- Oh.

160
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,800
Oh, my God, gross.

161
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,302
- Ah.
- There we go, feeding time.

162
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,060
That's so gross.

163
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,271
That reeks, huh?

164
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:01,151
I thought it was illegal
to chum the water.

165
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,295
- Uh...
- You think I should

166
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,573
call the shark instead?
Mr. Shark!

167
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,658
Hello!

168
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,456
I don't think they hear
so good underwater.

169
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,464
Yeah, they just put that down...

170
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,800
- What-what did he say?
- ...so the sharks will smell it.

171
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,523
- No, nothing.
- They should be here soon.

172
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,471
- We should get this party started.
- Okay.

173
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:38,230
Here, fishy, fishy,
fishy, fishy.

174
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,774
That works? Okay.

175
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,617
There! Look!

176
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,452
- Where?
- There, there...

177
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,708
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God!

178
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,918
- Got to check this out. Javier.
- Javi.

179
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,295
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

180
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:04,715
- See, right over there.
- Lisa?

181
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,472
- Should we get ready?
- Javi!

182
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,060
Lisa, you in there?
Come on.

183
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,503
There's a shark right by the boat.

184
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,938
The boys are in first,
but we got to get ready in a minute.

185
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:23,150
No. I don't think I can do it.
I'm sorry.

186
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,461
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- What? No.

187
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,629
- No, no, please.
- Don't be mad at me.

188
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,756
- I can't, I ca-I can't.
- Come on, it'll be incredible.

189
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,574
Please, please, please, please.

190
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:33,243
You know, you're not gonna make
Stuart jealous

191
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:35,287
with photos inside the boat's bathroom.

192
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,331
- Really?
- Well, I had to say it.

193
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,751
I did. Come on. Please.

194
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,466
- Ah, yes. Yes, I love you.
- Okay, okay, okay.

195
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,027
- Okay, come on.
- Oh, God, you owe me.

196
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,594
Yes, I will make you
breakfast in bed.

197
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,721
- Yeah, you owe me big time.
- Scrambled eggs...

198
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:54,390
I will, I promise.

199
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,810
That's it. Okay.

200
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,357
- Bye.
- Bye.

201
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,775
Let's lower the cage.

202
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,444
Be careful.

203
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,132
Oh, my God, that looks so scary.

204
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,367
- Okay. Bye.
- Don't leave me hanging.

205
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:15,869
<i>Bueno, Javi.</i>

206
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,540
See, look, it's safe. It's fine.

207
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,375
Have fun, boys.

208
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,877
Whoa, don't slip.

209
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,346
Bye.

210
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,786
Okay.

211
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,485
Come here.

212
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,572
There.

213
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,785
- Oh, my God.
- It's huge.

214
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:40,746
Oh, my God, Kate.

215
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,167
It's about 20 feet.
I've seen them get as big as 28.

216
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,002
- We're really gonna do that?
- Yes!

217
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,213
Yeah, let's get you
suited up now.

218
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,465
I'm really nervous.

219
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,800
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,051
I'm shitting bricks.

221
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,135
- Really?
- Yes.

222
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,303
- You are?
- Yes.

223
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,847
Hey, help me.

224
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,891
Does my butt at least
look cute in this?

225
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,269
<i>Oye.</i>

226
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,113
You ladies ready?

227
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,824
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

228
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,201
- Yeah?
- Yup. Okay.

229
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,786
Oh, God.

230
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,462
Relax.

231
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:31,964
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay? All right.

232
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,298
- Calm down.
- Okay.

233
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:36,260
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Good.

234
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,096
- That's it.
- Okay.

235
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,807
Here, hold on to that.

236
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,768
There you go.

237
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,478
- Now...
- Put these down?

238
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:50,774
Uh-huh. Check your air.
You should both have 20Ø bar.

239
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,112
Yeah, 200.

240
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,031
- That's your air.
- Okay.

241
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,827
When it gets to 100,
you need to let me know.

242
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,496
When it gets to 50,
I'm gonna bring you back up.

243
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,956
Fifty is the orange.

244
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,375
- Yes.
- Yeah, okay. Yeah, I know that, yeah.

245
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,502
- That's it.
- Right, okay.

246
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,505
All right, you're only gonna be
going down about five meters.

247
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:16,216
It's unlikely at that depth,
but...

248
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,220
If you get any pain in your ears,
you just need to equalize.

249
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,514
Tilt you head back and swallow.

250
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,016
- Equalize.
- Okay.

251
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,809
- Head back, swallow.
- Okay.

252
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:26,977
Yeah.

253
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,606
All right, now just remember,
the faster you breathe,

254
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,482
the faster you use up your air.

255
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:37,779
- Relax<i>. Tranquilo,</i> okay?
- Okay.

256
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,216
Trust me, once you're down there,
you're not gonna want to come back up.

257
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,326
- Right.
- Great.

258
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,702
- Good?
- Okay.

259
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,038
- Awesome, all right.
- Yeah, I can do this.

260
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,248
Okay. Okay.

261
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,489
It's great.
You're gonna love it down there.

262
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,432
Gracias. Gracias, Javi.

263
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,060
Next?

264
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,603
- That's it.
- I'm so scared.

265
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:10,687
Be careful.

266
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,451
Shark don't hear so good up here,
you know?

267
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,567
Underwater? You're in his world.

268
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,612
Can hear your heartbeat
for up to five miles away.

269
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,698
Can sense if
you're frightened or weak.

270
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,867
Track you down.

271
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,244
Good to go!

272
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,705
Don't pay any attention
to that <i>pendejo.</i>

273
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,666
You're going to have a great time.

274
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,751
Can I borrow your camera?

275
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,129
Yeah, but...

276
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:39,216
...if you drop it,
you got to go down and get it.

277
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,551
What are we doing, Kate?

278
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,803
Smile.

279
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,222
<i>- Adios, muchachas!
- Okay.</i>

280
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:58,068
- I'm really scared.
- I'm going to go first, okay?

281
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,617
Oh, I'm so excited. Okay.

282
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,375
All right. You're next.

283
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,045
- That's it.
- Uh-huh.

284
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:18,547
Right.

285
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,013
Oh, Kate. You can see for miles.
Kate, look at the fish.

286
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,973
Do you see all the fish?

287
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,976
It's so much better
than sitting in a hotel room, right?

288
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,811
Oh, wow.

289
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:20,650
This is awesome.
I had no idea.

290
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,749
<i>Can you girls hear me?</i>

291
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,780
- Yeah.
- Yes.

292
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:28,241
<i>- Lisa, how you doing?</i>
- I'm good, actually.

293
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,161
<i>- Kate, how about you?</i>
- Yeah, I'm good.

294
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,556
- I can't see any sharks, though.
<i>- All right, well, just be patient.</i>

295
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,791
<i>We're gonna add a little bit
more chum to the water now.</i>

296
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,042
Okay.

297
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:41,546
Oh, wow.

298
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,840
It kind of takes your breath away.

299
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,426
How deep do you think it goes?

300
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,976
I have no idea.

301
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,817
Wave to the camera.

302
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,237
Cheese! Hi! Hi.

303
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,115
Oh, wow.

304
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,283
Can you take a picture of me?

305
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,743
- Yeah.
- Wait.

306
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:16,081
Oh! Oh, shit. Sorry. Sorry.

307
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,004
Oh, my God, the guys
are going to be so pissed.

308
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,241
You've got to go and get that.

309
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,796
Oh, my God!

310
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,185
That is, like, the biggest shark!

311
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,773
This is amazing.

312
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,489
There's another one.

313
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:52,009
- Oh, my God, he's huge.
- Oh, my God, look at those teeth.

314
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,162
I can't believe how close they are.

315
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,415
- I dare you to touch him.
- Are you crazy?

316
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,053
Well, he definitely likes
to look at you.

317
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,515
Did you feel that?
The cage just moved.

318
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,851
I thought we were
gonna drop for a second.

319
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,477
<i>Are you girls okay?</i>

320
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,063
No, I think the cage
just dropped a little bit.

321
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,107
<i>No, no, it's the winch mechanism.</i>

322
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,651
<i>It's-it's fine.
It just slipped a little bit.</i>

323
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,237
Uh, no, I think we would like
to come back up now.

324
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:31,239
No, no, no, no. We don't.
I'm sure it's nothing.

325
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,158
- We're fine, okay?
- Are you crazy?

326
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,785
No, we would like
to come back up now, please.

327
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,370
<i>All right, listen. Standby.</i>

328
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,247
<i>We're going to bring
you girls back up.</i>

329
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,208
- Come on!
<i>- Javi,</i> ¿estás seguras?

330
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,501
- Sorry.
- Lisa, come on.

331
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,299
I just don't feel
safe in this cage.

332
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:54,012
- At least we got to see some sharks.
- I mean, I guess so.

333
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:57,933
It's just so cool.
I could stay down here forever.

334
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,019
Hey, Taylor, once Lisa's out,
can I go back down again?

335
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,822
What...? Taylor, we're sinking!

336
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,699
We're sinking!

337
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:18,578
- Help us, guys!
- Taylor, help!

338
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,623
I have to get out of here!

339
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:28,755
Taylor, help us!

340
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,555
Taylor!

341
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,062
Lisa. Oh, my God. Wake up. Wake up.

342
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:56,236
Lisa, please wake up. Please.

343
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,510
Wake up, wake up.

344
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,246
Lisa, please, wake up. Lis.

345
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,629
- No, no, no, no!
- No, no.

346
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,923
Taylor! Taylor, help us!

347
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,884
- We're stuck here at the bottom!
- Lisa, you need to calm down.

348
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:21,445
- We need to get out of here!
- If you do not calm down,

349
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:22,470
we will die here!

350
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:23,972
Look at me now!

351
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:27,183
- Stop! Stop!
- Kate, I can't breathe.

352
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,786
- Oh, I can't breathe.
- Slow your breathing.

353
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,954
- I can't breathe.
- Please, please, please.

354
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:33,523
Slow your breathing. In. Out.

355
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:37,277
In. Out. Come on.

356
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,874
Good, good.

357
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:54,169
The more you panic,
the faster you use up your air, okay?

358
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,921
I need you to slow down
your breathing.

359
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,468
Okay, good.

360
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,140
How deep are we?

361
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,102
Forty-seven meters.

362
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,897
We must've ripped the crane
right off the boat.

363
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,565
What are we gonna do?

364
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,859
Listen!

365
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,694
Can you hear that?

366
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,572
Taylor?

367
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:23,907
Taylor?

368
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,410
Help us! Hello!

369
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,536
Taylor?

370
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,956
- Taylor! Taylor!
- Wait, wait, wait. Stop.

371
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,713
We must be just out of range to...

372
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:42,050
We've gotta try and get
back in contact with them.

373
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,343
How?

374
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:48,473
We can almost hear them, right?
So-so maybe we're just a bit too deep.

375
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:52,310
Maybe... maybe if I swim up
a tiny bit,

376
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,562
then-then we'll be back in range, okay?

377
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:57,333
I could tell them that we're alive,
and they need to come and get us.

378
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:01,528
Yeah, but what about the sharks?
They can sense us down here, right?

379
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,782
I'll swim as close to the cage as I can.
I'll be okay.

380
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,785
No, no, no, please, Kate.
Promise me you won't leave me down here.

381
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,663
I won't leave you, I promise.

382
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,374
I promise.

383
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,381
Oh, shit.

384
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,933
- It's stuck.
- No, it's not.

385
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,476
We can get it.

386
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,107
We can do it!

387
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,735
Push!

388
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,256
We're not gonna get out
through this side.

389
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,198
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

390
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:51,035
I can get it.
Just give me a second. Okay.

391
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,707
I think I can get out
through these bars.

392
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,460
I need to take my tank off, though.

393
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:02,630
Wait, what?! Is that even safe?

394
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:05,394
It's going to be okay. You can
pass it to me when I'm through.

395
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,487
That gap looks really small.
Do you think you could even make it?

396
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,263
Take my BCD, okay?

397
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,515
Okay.

398
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:17,562
- I need you to watch out for me.
- Please, be careful.

399
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:22,650
Okay.
I got this. Okay.

400
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,531
Okay. I'm okay.

401
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,335
Kate, come on, you can get this.

402
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,010
Come on, push!
Push, Kate.

403
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,511
You got it.

404
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:00,980
What are we going to do, Kate?
What are we going to do?

405
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,815
I'm gonna have to
take my mask off, okay?

406
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:04,609
- No. No, no, no. No, no, no.
- It's fine.

407
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,420
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate,
there has to be some other way.

408
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,404
No, just stop,
just stop and think for a second.

409
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,864
- You have to calm down.
- No, no.

410
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,175
Kate, you can't take off your mask.

411
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,825
- Lisa, calm down! Stop.
- No, I can't.

412
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,411
- I can't.
- Please.

413
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:19,540
I'm gonna take some deep breaths,
I'm gonna take it off,

414
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,905
and go through and you're gonna
pass it right to me, okay?

415
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,212
What if you can't
get it back on again? You'll drown.

416
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,422
It's okay.

417
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,762
All right, you ready?

418
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,237
Here, take the mask!

419
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:11,259
Here, put this on, quick.
Come on, put it on quick. Hurry up.

420
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,811
Hurry. Hurry, hurry, hurry, please.

421
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,366
Before I make contact,
I'm gonna move the crane.

422
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,580
Just in case you need to get out
and I'm not here, okay?

423
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,416
Please don't say that, Kate.
We're going to get out of this together.

424
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:47,044
Just keep a look out, okay?

425
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:13,029
It's not moving.

426
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:16,073
I'm going to go see
if it's stuck at the base.

427
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:19,452
Kate, I'm scared.
What if the sharks come?

428
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:28,085
It's caught against the rocks.
I think that I can move it.

429
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,421
Okay, but hurry, please.

430
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,801
Come on, Kate.

431
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:49,148
I think I have it free.

432
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,741
- Oh, come on. Come on.
- Come on, Kate.

433
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,285
Push.

434
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,246
You got it, you got it.

435
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,540
It's moving.

436
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,293
Keep going.

437
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:10,837
Yes!

438
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:15,758
We did it!

439
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,348
I'm gonna see
if I can reach Taylor.

440
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:24,141
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

441
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,143
Hurry, please.

442
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,572
Taylor, can you hear me?

443
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,914
Is anybody there?

444
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:58,467
Somebody please answer me!

445
00:36:58,551 --> 00:36:59,969
<i>Hello! Kate!</i>

446
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,738
- I can hear you!
<i>- I said, can you hear me? Say something.</i>

447
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,282
I can hear you, Taylor,
it's Kate, it's Kate!

448
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:04,599
- Hello?
<i>- I hear you.</i>

449
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:09,145
<i>- I read you loud and clear, Kate.</i>
- Oh, thank God. Oh, you have to help us.

450
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,689
<i>- Are you both okay?</i>
- Yes.

451
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:12,857
<i>- Good.</i>
- Yes.

452
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,612
<i>- How much air do you have in your tank?</i>
- Um... I'm at 55 bar.

453
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:22,116
<i>- What does your depth gauge say?</i>
- Um, the gauge is at 47 meters.

454
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,911
I had to come up to hear you,
I'm at 40 meters.

455
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,830
I'm am so freaking scared.
What do I do?

456
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,206
<i>All right, listen, Kate.</i>

457
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,500
<i>I need you to get
back in the cage immediately.</i>

458
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,711
<i>It's the only safe place
from the sharks.</i>

459
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:36,547
<i>Do you understand?
Javier's coming down to you now.</i>

460
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,842
<i>He's going to hook up the cage
to our spare winch and pull you up.</i>

461
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,802
- Okay.
<i>- And remember, Kate,</i>

462
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:45,431
<i>whatever you and Lisa do,
don't try to race to the surface.</i>

463
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:48,684
<i>- You'll get the bends.</i>
- I'm going back down now.

464
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,019
Promise me you'll come.

465
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,897
<i>Just stay in the cage
and reserve your air.</i>

466
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,482
Okay.

467
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,061
Just keep calm.

468
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:34,814
Just keep breathing.

469
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:39,652
I made contact with them, Lisa.
I made contact.

470
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,405
Yeah? Yeah? What did they say?

471
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:46,742
Javier is coming down.
He's gonna connect the cage

472
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:48,703
- to a backup winch.
- He is?

473
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:51,622
Oh! Thank God, thank God, thank God.

474
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:54,208
Oh, okay. Oh, thank God.

475
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,628
- We need to conserve our air.
- Okay. Okay.

476
00:38:57,712 --> 00:38:59,922
Oh, it's almost over.

477
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:05,177
I was so frightened, Kate,
waiting for you.

478
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,388
I thought that you were
never coming back.

479
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:23,863
I'm so sorry I got us into this.

480
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,215
The other night at the hotel,

481
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:45,419
what did you mean when you said
that your relationship

482
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:47,261
was the only thing
you were good at?

483
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,480
You're always doing
such fun stuff, Kate.

484
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,775
Traveling around the world
doing crazy things,

485
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:03,152
guys always chasing after you.

486
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:06,447
I could never compete with that.

487
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,659
I was always just
your boring older sister, but...

488
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:13,287
...my relationship with Stuart

489
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,999
was the one thing that I had
that you didn't.

490
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,463
We were never in competition.

491
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,385
Maybe you weren't.

492
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:39,105
What do you think Stuart would
say if he could see you now?

493
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:52,993
- What?
- He would lose his mind.

494
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:54,995
Yeah.

495
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,665
Listen.

496
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,591
What is that?

497
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,350
Oh, my God,
that's the boat's engine.

498
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:24,567
- Oh, my God, they've left us!
- They-they wouldn't have left us, okay?

499
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,836
- Oh, God.
- Maybe it's something else.

500
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,655
- Maybe it was a different boat.
- We would've heard it arrive.

501
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,133
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

502
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:33,576
I've got to go and try
and get them on the radio again.

503
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,203
Kate, what are we gonna do
if they're not there?

504
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:38,205
They will not have left us, okay?

505
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,047
Taylor, can you hear me?

506
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:55,723
Hello, are you there?

507
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,894
Please answer me, someone!

508
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:07,735
Taylor, it's Kate. Can you hear me?

509
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:14,200
Hello, is anyone there?
Please, someone answer me!

510
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:23,125
Lisa, open the hatch!

511
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:24,919
Open the hatch!
It was a shark!

512
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:35,971
I can't open it!
It's caught on the chain!

513
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:39,892
It's coming, it's coming! Oh, my God!
Hurry, hurry!

514
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:46,732
Oh, my God.

515
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:49,652
I thought it was...
I thought it was gonna get me.

516
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:52,112
I thought it... I was dead.

517
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:03,666
The cage is gonna break!
It's gonna get through!

518
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:08,671
Be quiet!
Quiet, be quiet.

519
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:23,644
It almost broke through the cage.
We're not safe here anymore.

520
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:27,147
Did you make contact with Taylor?

521
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:30,609
They weren't there.

522
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:32,569
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

523
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:34,655
They're not just gonna
leave us here.

524
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,824
They said they were
sending someone down.

525
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:39,410
But we heard them leave, didn't we?

526
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:41,721
They also said they were gonna
come down here and attach, like,

527
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:43,872
a spare winch to the top of the cage,

528
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:46,375
but did you even see one on the boat?
I didn't...

529
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,460
They are not gonna
leave us to die down here, okay?

530
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:50,480
- You need to calm down.
- So we have to get back up to the top.

531
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:52,148
No, Lisa, listen to me,
we cannot just swim up.

532
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:53,632
- We can swim fast.
- No, we can't.

533
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:54,818
- We can!
- We will get the bends.

534
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:56,468
Do you know what the bends is?

535
00:43:57,553 --> 00:44:00,139
It's nitrogen bubbles in the brain.

536
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:03,017
The only way to go up
is to ascend slowly

537
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,436
with a decompression stop
for five minutes.

538
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,105
Unprotected, in open water.

539
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:16,113
I'm so scared
we're gonna die down here.

540
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:17,424
- We are not gonna die.
- I don't want to die down here, Kate.

541
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:18,591
We're not gonna die down here.

542
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,451
It's okay, they're gonna
come and get us.

543
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:23,120
Read me your air.

544
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:28,500
Um... um... it says 80 bar.
I don't know what that means.

545
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:32,838
At this depth, that means we have about
20 minutes, tops, before you run out.

546
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,674
What about you?

547
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,389
Kate.

548
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,851
Thirty bar.

549
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,563
Oh, my God.

550
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:52,358
I'm gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

551
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:55,152
You're gonna run out of air.

552
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:00,783
Listen.

553
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:04,411
Javier?

554
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:07,998
What is that?
Is that Javier?

555
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:19,927
There! There!
There, there, there! Hey! Hey!

556
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:23,222
Can you hear us?
We can see your flashlight.

557
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:25,974
Javier!

558
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:29,144
Hey!

559
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:34,274
Why isn't he coming towards us?

560
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,494
May-Maybe he's out of range.

561
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:49,790
Hey! Javier!

562
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:51,793
We need to make sure
he knows where we are.

563
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,061
What's he doing?

564
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:16,733
I don't know.

565
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:20,737
Well, if he heard us,
why didn't he just signal?

566
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,491
We need to get that winch cable.

567
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:31,665
Seventeen bar.
You're almost out of air.

568
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,043
Okay...

569
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:45,846
Okay, I'm... I'm gonna go
out there and find him.

570
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,098
You just need to tell me
exactly what I need to do.

571
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:51,268
Are you sure?

572
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,563
Yeah.

573
00:46:57,399 --> 00:46:58,775
Okay.

574
00:46:59,276 --> 00:47:02,112
Keep as close to
the ocean floor as you can.

575
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:05,324
Sharks attack from below, so if you
keep to the floor, you should be fine.

576
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:10,287
This button inflates your BCD.
Use it to go up.

577
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,331
This button deflates it.

578
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:14,333
Listen to me,
this is so important.

579
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,668
No matter what happens,
no matter how panicked you get,

580
00:47:16,919 --> 00:47:19,171
do not go straight up.

581
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:21,089
You will die.
Do you understand?

582
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,509
I'll be right back.

583
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:48,325
Get down on the floor
as quick as you can, okay?

584
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:54,665
That's good.
You're doing so good. Okay.

585
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:58,627
Keep your breathing slow.
Just focus on the flashlight.

586
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,218
Lisa, I can see the shark!
It's coming towards you!

587
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:11,139
Hide! Hide!

588
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:25,862
Lisa? Lisa,
can you hear me? Are you safe?

589
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,032
- Lisa?
- I'm okay.

590
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:33,120
I'm okay. I'm in a cave.
The shark almost got me.

591
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:41,545
Where is it now?

592
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:49,553
I think it's gone.

593
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:06,069
Lisa? What's going on?

594
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:09,114
Lisa, are you okay?

595
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:18,498
Lisa? Answer me, please.

596
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,711
I'm okay.

597
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:42,731
I'm getting low on air.

598
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,746
I can see the flashlight.

599
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,498
I can see the beam.
It's getting closer...

600
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:02,751
Oh! Oh, my God. Oh.

601
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:06,588
Lisa, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

602
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:11,051
I'm at the edge
of some sort of cliff.

603
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:13,387
I can't see the ocean floor.

604
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:17,808
We're running out of time.

605
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:24,398
Okay, I can do this.
I can do this.

606
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:33,490
Are you doing okay, Lisa?

607
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:37,327
I am so scared, Kate. I can't
even see what's below me.

608
00:51:08,525 --> 00:51:11,445
I see it! I see it!

609
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:13,739
I see it!

610
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,367
I found the flashlight.

611
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:20,495
Javier?!

612
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:26,710
He's not here, Kate.
Javier?!

613
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:30,756
I'm gonna come back, okay?

614
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,012
Which way did I come from?

615
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:44,102
Kate? Uh-oh.

616
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:47,606
Um...
Kate, can you hear me? Hello?

617
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:51,109
Kate? Kate, please answer me.

618
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:54,112
I'm really lost,
and I'm freaking out right now.

619
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:57,908
Oh, my God.

620
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:04,080
Stay calm.
Stay calm and make a decision.

621
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:05,916
Kate!

622
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:24,851
Kate, I'm so lost.

623
00:52:31,525 --> 00:52:33,777
Kate, can you hear me?

624
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:52,546
Get back into the cage!

625
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:26,454
Kate? Kate, I can hear you!
Can you hear me?

626
00:53:26,538 --> 00:53:28,707
You're breaking up!

627
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:39,926
Kate?

628
00:53:41,303 --> 00:53:45,015
I need you to bang a rock or something
when you see the flashlight,

629
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:47,142
so I know which way to go.

630
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,479
I can hear you, Kate!

631
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,078
He's got no air. Damn.

632
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:10,040
Okay, I have to...
I have to get the winch.

633
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:12,876
I have to get the winch.

634
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:18,256
Oh. Spear gun.

635
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,550
Oh, God.

636
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:34,189
I can see the flashlight.
You're getting closer.

637
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:41,988
Oh. Okay. I can see the
lights on the cage. I'm coming.

638
00:54:42,072 --> 00:54:43,615
I'm coming, Kate.

639
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:48,995
Lisa, I thought you were dead.
Where's Javier?

640
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:51,414
The shark ripped him to pieces.

641
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:53,083
I have the winch cable.

642
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:56,127
Oh, I was so lost I thought
I would never see you again.

643
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,256
Thread it through...

644
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,385
Hey, the cable looks really thin.
Do you think it will hold?

645
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:06,888
It has to.
Give me the flashlight.

646
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:09,265
I'm gonna swim back up,
and tell them

647
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:11,518
- that we have to come up now.
- Be careful!

648
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,395
I'll be right back.

649
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:27,492
Taylor?
Taylor, can you hear me?

650
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:33,373
Taylor, hello!

651
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:34,791
<i>- Kate?</i>
- It's Lisa.

652
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:37,377
We managed to attach the cable
to the top of the cage.

653
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,670
We need to come up right now!

654
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:40,296
<i>- Is Javier with you?</i>
- No!

655
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:44,718
- Javier is dead.
<i>- What? Oh... Jesus.</i>

656
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:47,721
<i>Get back in the cage!
Get back in the cage, now!</i>

657
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:49,514
<i>I'm bringing you back up!</i>

658
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,119
They're bringing us up now.

659
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:13,788
- They are?
- Yeah. Yeah.

660
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:16,458
Oh. Thank God.

661
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:25,550
Kate, do you hear that?

662
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:34,684
Do you hear that?

663
00:56:34,768 --> 00:56:36,686
Oh. Oh.

664
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:43,568
- Oh, oh. See?
- Yeah.

665
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:45,570
Look. We're starting to move.

666
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:52,118
We're gonna go home!

667
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:56,915
Oh, thank God it's almost over!
Oh, we're gonna go home!

668
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:03,588
It's working. Look.
We're getting higher.

669
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,673
You did it, Lisa. You saved us.

670
00:57:05,757 --> 00:57:10,261
The gauge is starting to move.
Look, Kate. Kate, it's at 46 meters.

671
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:14,057
Forty-five

672
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:16,017
Forty-four.

673
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:22,524
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Yeah.

674
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:27,779
<i>Kate, Lisa, can you hear me?</i>

675
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:31,491
Taylor, we can hear you.
We're at 36 meters.

676
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,701
Thirty-five!

677
00:57:34,911 --> 00:57:36,496
Thirty-four!

678
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:41,084
Thirty-three.

679
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:44,629
Thirty-two!

680
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:47,882
Thirty-one!

681
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:50,677
<i>Good. Good. We're almost there.</i>

682
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,761
Thirty!

683
00:57:51,845 --> 00:57:53,221
<i>Nice and slowly.</i>

684
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:55,515
Twenty-nine!

685
00:57:56,933 --> 00:57:58,268
Twenty-eight...

686
00:57:59,394 --> 00:58:01,146
- Taylor!
- Taylor, the cable's breaking!

687
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:03,022
<i>- What?</i>
- Taylor, help us!

688
00:58:03,106 --> 00:58:05,483
<i>All right, listen, stay calm.</i>

689
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:08,319
<i>Don't move! I'm gonna slow it down.</i>

690
00:58:08,403 --> 00:58:09,529
Taylor, help.

691
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:12,323
Taylor? Taylor?

692
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:36,514
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

693
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:39,893
- Get it off, Kate!
- Oh, my God! Okay.

694
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,980
It's stuck,
I can't move it!

695
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:52,488
We're running out of time!

696
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:55,825
I've got to get a hold of Taylor.

697
00:58:55,909 --> 00:58:58,703
Don't leave me, Kate.
I don't want to suffocate.

698
00:58:59,412 --> 00:59:02,707
No, it's going to be fine.
I'm going to come back.

699
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:07,754
Taylor, it's Kate.

700
00:59:07,837 --> 00:59:09,964
<i>- Are you hurt?</i>
- Lisa's trapped.

701
00:59:10,048 --> 00:59:12,175
Her leg is stuck and we have no air!

702
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:15,136
My gauge is on five bar.
It's gonna run out any minute.

703
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,847
<i>I'm going to send down
extra air tanks.</i>

704
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:21,100
<i>But, Kate, there's a reason
that I didn't do this before.</i>

705
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:24,479
<i>Moving onto a second tank is going to
increase your chance</i>

706
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:26,940
<i>of nitrogen narcosis, dramatically.</i>

707
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:30,610
<i>You're going to need to watch
each other closely to make sure</i>

708
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:34,447
<i>that neither of you is behaving
strangely or hallucinating.</i>

709
00:59:35,198 --> 00:59:37,158
<i>I've notified the Coast Guard.</i>

710
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:40,703
<i>They're sending a team that's
fully equipped for deep sea rescue.</i>

711
00:59:40,787 --> 00:59:43,206
<i>They'll be here in less than an hour.</i>

712
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:46,501
I'm so scared.

713
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:50,296
It's gonna be fine.

714
01:00:31,087 --> 01:00:33,423
Look.

715
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:37,010
Over there.
It's the oxygen tanks.

716
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,936
Please, be careful.

717
01:00:47,395 --> 01:00:49,188
I'll be right back.

718
01:00:55,153 --> 01:00:57,572
Shit. I'm almost out of air.

719
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:20,219
Kate, did you find it?

720
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,229
- Kate, are you okay?
- Yeah.

721
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:32,315
I'm okay.

722
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,652
They sent down some flares.

723
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,782
All we have to do is wait for
the Coast Guard to arrive.

724
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:53,753
- I've got the spare tank.
- Kate, get down!

725
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:59,509
Stay down.

726
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:02,095
Where is it, Lisa?

727
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:07,475
It's right above you, don't move.

728
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:44,595
Oh, God, I can't see it!

729
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,728
I'm going to make a break
for the cage.

730
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:56,190
No, Kate, no, no, no, don't move.
Stay down, please, stay down.

731
01:02:56,274 --> 01:02:57,650
Open the hatch.

732
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,910
Kate!

733
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:16,836
No, Kate, no, Kate.

734
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,424
I am not going to die down here.

735
01:04:41,128 --> 01:04:43,714
I'm going to run out of air.

736
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,804
Come on, come on. God.

737
01:05:35,725 --> 01:05:37,977
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

738
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:44,557
<i>Lisa?</i>

739
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,643
- Kate?
<i>- Lisa, are you there?</i>

740
01:09:47,726 --> 01:09:51,438
Oh, Kate, oh, Kate,
I thought that you were dead.

741
01:09:51,522 --> 01:09:53,607
- Oh, God.
<i>- I managed to escape.</i>

742
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:56,360
<i>Sharks, are circling me.</i>

743
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:58,779
<i>I'm hurt.</i>

744
01:09:59,405 --> 01:10:03,659
- How bad, how bad?
<i>- Bad. I'm bleeding a lot.</i>

745
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:07,162
<i>It's... it's attracting more sharks.</i>

746
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:09,540
How much air do you have left?

747
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:11,333
<i>Thirty bar.</i>

748
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:15,713
<i>The shark punctured my BCD.</i>

749
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:19,341
<i>My oxygen's escaping.</i>

750
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:23,095
- <i>I'm scared, Lisa.</i>
- I know, I know.

751
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:26,557
Okay, I need you to listen to me.
You need to remain calm.

752
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,517
They are going to come down and get us.

753
01:10:28,601 --> 01:10:30,644
I need you to concentrate
on your breathing, okay?

754
01:10:30,728 --> 01:10:32,980
Breathe in and out,
like you told me, okay?

755
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:35,649
In and out.

756
01:10:35,733 --> 01:10:37,526
In and out.

757
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,819
<i>So cold.</i>

758
01:10:38,903 --> 01:10:41,947
Right, I'm gonna come and get you.
I'm gonna come and find you right now.

759
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:45,326
<i>Tired...</i>

760
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:48,579
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

761
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:50,664
Stay with me, Kate.

762
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:53,208
Stay with me, okay?
Just keep talking to me.

763
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,877
<i>I'm not going to make it.</i>

764
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:05,930
Kate?

765
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,265
Kate, are you still there?

766
01:11:09,642 --> 01:11:11,101
Kate?

767
01:11:11,769 --> 01:11:13,145
Kate?

768
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:14,813
<i>I'm so cold.</i>

769
01:11:14,897 --> 01:11:17,149
Kate, keep talking to me, please.

770
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:21,654
My BCD.

771
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:25,366
Oh, I'm gonna get us out of here.

772
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:53,102
Please work. Please, please.

773
01:12:28,012 --> 01:12:29,555
Oh, God.

774
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:36,395
- I'm gonna come and find you.
<i>- I...</i>

775
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:38,078
I'm gonna come and find you, Kate, okay?

776
01:12:38,147 --> 01:12:42,026
<i>- ...can't... breathe.</i>
- I'm coming, Kate.

777
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:47,072
Okay.

778
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:53,787
Kate?

779
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:57,124
Kate, can you see the beam
from my flashlight?

780
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:01,962
<i>Lisa... Lisa... I'm so cold.</i>

781
01:13:02,046 --> 01:13:06,842
Kate, keep talking to me, please.
Can you see the beam from my flashlight?

782
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:08,677
<i>I see you, I see the flashlight.</i>

783
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:11,305
Yes! Yes, I can hear you!
Okay, I'm coming to find you.

784
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:12,765
Stay right where you are.

785
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:25,402
Kate?

786
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:28,489
Kate, can you see my flashlight?

787
01:13:45,047 --> 01:13:46,840
<i>Over here.</i>

788
01:13:47,216 --> 01:13:48,801
Kate!

789
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:52,888
Oh, God.

790
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:58,811
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

791
01:14:06,902 --> 01:14:09,988
Kate, you're bleeding to death.
Kate, we have to go up now.

792
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:13,033
I'm not gonna let you die.
Come on, we can do it.

793
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:17,496
Come on.

794
01:14:19,123 --> 01:14:22,376
Use the flare, Kate.
It'll help ward off the sharks.

795
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:35,681
Taylor?

796
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:38,559
Taylor, can you hear me?

797
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:42,312
Taylor!

798
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:48,694
Taylor, can you hear us?

799
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:52,865
Taylor!

800
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:54,825
<i>Hello?</i>

801
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:57,327
<i>- Can you hear me? Lisa?</i>
- Taylor, can you hear us?

802
01:14:57,411 --> 01:14:58,787
<i>Lisa, I can hear you.</i>

803
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:01,123
Oh! Okay, um...
we are heading up now.

804
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:04,751
<i>No, it's not safe.
You need to stay in the cage.</i>

805
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:07,296
We don't have a choice.
Kate has been badly hurt.

806
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:09,131
We are coming up now.

807
01:15:11,258 --> 01:15:13,844
<i>All right,
but you need to go very slowly.</i>

808
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:15,053
<i>Do you understand?</i>

809
01:15:15,137 --> 01:15:17,931
<i>If you ascend too quickly,
you're going to get the bends.</i>

810
01:15:18,015 --> 01:15:19,099
Okay.

811
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:32,696
<i>Look at your gauge.
Tell me what your depth is.</i>

812
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:35,032
Um, we're at 30 meters.

813
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:37,117
<i>You need to slow down.</i>

814
01:15:37,201 --> 01:15:41,496
<i>If you get nitrogen bubbles in your
brain, you are dead, do you understand?</i>

815
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,750
Yes, I understand!
We are coming.

816
01:15:51,798 --> 01:15:54,635
We're getting there, Kate.
We're getting there.

817
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:56,487
Come on, you just need
to hang on a little bit longer.

818
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:04,603
- We're at 20 meters.
<i>- Okay, good.</i>

819
01:16:04,686 --> 01:16:06,396
Now you need to stay there
for five minutes

820
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,106
and do a decompression stop.

821
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:12,110
Okay. Okay.

822
01:16:12,194 --> 01:16:15,489
<i>You need to let the nitrogen
leave your bloodstream.</i>

823
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:23,288
<i>Four and a half minutes.</i>

824
01:16:23,372 --> 01:16:25,332
We need to light
another one, hurry!

825
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:27,834
Okay. I have two more.

826
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:31,713
I dropped it.

827
01:16:32,881 --> 01:16:34,383
Here, take the flashlight.

828
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,468
Where is it?
Where is it?

829
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:38,470
I can't find it, Kate.

830
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:43,517
- Oh, got it! Got it!
<i>- Just three more minutes.</i>

831
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:54,611
Taylor, there are sharks everywhere!
And we're on our last flare.

832
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:05,247
We're gonna make it, Kate.

833
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:07,416
We're gonna make it,
just stay with me, okay?

834
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:18,427
We're out of flares!

835
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:21,305
- What do we do?
<i>- Break for the surface, now!</i>

836
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:23,974
<i>Drop your BCD and swim!</i>

837
01:17:27,019 --> 01:17:28,437
<i>Swim!</i>

838
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:56,631
Help.

839
01:17:57,257 --> 01:17:58,884
Help!

840
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:03,138
Help us!

841
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:05,057
- Help.
- Kate!

842
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:06,725
- Lisa!
- Help us!

843
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:09,019
- Swim!
- Help!

844
01:18:09,102 --> 01:18:10,102
Swim!

845
01:18:12,981 --> 01:18:14,524
Grab it!

846
01:18:17,277 --> 01:18:19,488
Grab the lifesaver,
we'll pull you in.

847
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:57,943
Lisa! <i>Vamos!</i>

848
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:04,241
Pull us faster!

849
01:19:04,324 --> 01:19:06,618
Grab her!

850
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:08,179
- I can't reach your hand.
- Get them in the boat, now!

851
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:09,246
Pull us up!

852
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:30,600
Grab my hand!

853
01:19:33,186 --> 01:19:34,813
Take my hand.

854
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:56,293
Keep pressure on the wound.

855
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,477
How strange.

856
01:20:15,312 --> 01:20:16,354
<i>Lisa...</i>

857
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:20,025
Your voice sounds funny.

858
01:20:27,491 --> 01:20:28,931
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

859
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:43,757

You're hallu... nating.

867
01:21:14,246 --> 01:21:19,292
We made it, Kate! We made it!

<i>We're going to get you home.</i>

875
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:02,836
Hey! Hey!

876
01:22:04,129 --> 01:22:05,755
