1
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,867
In sixteen hundred seven

2
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,600
We sailed the open sea

3
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:24,067
For glory, God and gold
and the Virginia Company

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,800
For the New World
is like heaven

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,533
And we'll all be rich and free

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,400
Or so we have been told
by the Virginia Company

7
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:40,867
So we have been told
by the Virginia Company

8
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:57,600
For glory, God and gold
and the Virginia Company

9
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,933
- Ready to hoist the cannon?
- Right!
- Hey, look. Is that Smith?

10
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,267
That's him, all right.
The old sea dog.

11
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,600
Captain John Smith.
I've heard some amazing
stories about him.

12
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:10,267
- Are you coming
on this voyage too?
- Of course he is, you half-wit.

13
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:13,067
You can't fight Indians
without John Smith.

14
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:17,067
That's right. I'm not about to
let you boys have all the fun.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,733
On the beaches of Virginny

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,333
There's diamonds like debris

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,000
There silver rivers flow
and gold you pick
right off a tree

18
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,067
With a nugget for my Winnie

19
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,933
And another one for me

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,400
And all the rest will go
to the Virginia Company

21
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:42,133
To glory, God and gold

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,733
And the Virginia Company

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,800
Haul on the brace!

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,467
- Come on, come on!
- Do your best!

25
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,800
Watch out!

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,067
Faster!
She's taking on more water!

27
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:13,133
Look out!

28
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,000
John! Get down here!

29
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,933
The cannons are breaking loose!

30
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,800
- Reef the topsails!
- Yes, sir!
- Steady on your course.

31
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:31,867
It's all right, Thomas.
We'll get her tied off.

32
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:34,267
Say your prayers, men!

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,533
Thomas, watch it!

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,733
Help!

35
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:53,933
- Man overboard!
- Help!

36
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:57,133
- Stay your course! He's lost!
- Help!

37
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,067
- Pull the pins!
- Aye, sir!

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,333
Smith! Smith!

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Are you crazy?

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,933
Hang on, Thomas!
I've got you!

41
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,067
Quick! The rope!

42
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,133
Heave!

43
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,200
Come on, lads! Pull!

44
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,000
- Pull! Pull!
- Pull! Pull!

45
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:36,800
- Put your back into it!
- Pull!

46
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,067
- Pull!
- Hang on!

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,133
There, my lucky lads.

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,800
Well, that was refreshing.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,933
Well done, Smith.

50
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:54,667
Of course, you'd all
do the same for me.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,067
- Oh, sure, sure.
Of course we would.
- Sure, yes. Yeah, we would.

52
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:59,067
Absolutely!

53
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:04,067
- Trouble on deck?
- Governor Ratcliffe.

54
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:07,867
- Thomas fell overboard, sir.
- Thank heavens he's been successfully retrieved.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
- Well done, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.

56
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,467
Don't lose heart, men.
It won't be long before we reach the New World.

57
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:18,000
And remember
what awaits us there.

58
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:21,067
Freedom, prosperity...

59
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,400
the adventure of our lives.

60
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:26,867
You're the finest crew
England has to offer, and nothing--

61
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,333
not wind nor rain nor a thousand
bloodthirsty savages--

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,333
shall stand in our way.

63
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,400
Carry on, men!

64
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,800
A stirring oration, sir.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm sure the men
were most exhilarated.

66
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:46,533
Let us hope so.
I'll need those witless peasants
to dig up my gold, won't I?

67
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,533
This New World's
gonna be great,John.

68
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:54,467
I'm gonna get a pile of gold,
build me a big house...

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,800
and if any Indian tries
to stop me, I'll blast him.

70
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,467
You just worry about
that fortune of yours, Thomas.

71
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,800
- Leave the savages to me.
- You think they'll give us much trouble?

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,933
Not as much trouble
as Smith'll give them.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,267
We'll kill ourselves an lnjun

74
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,200
Or maybe two or three

75
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:17,333
We're stalwart men and bold
of the Virginia Company

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,667
What do you suppose
the New World will look like?

77
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,000
Like all the others, I suppose.

78
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,267
I've seen hundreds
of new worlds, Thomas.

79
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,067
What could possibly
be different about this one?

80
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:36,400
lt's glory, God and gold
And the Virginia Company

81
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,000
Steady as the beating drum
Singing to the cedar flute

82
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,333
Seasons go and seasons come

83
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,533
Bring the corn and bear the fruit

84
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:32,133
By the waters sweet and clean
Where the mighty sturgeon lives

85
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,667
Plant the squash and reapa the bean

86
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,733
All the Earth our mother gives

87
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:43,467
Oh, great spirit, hear our song
Helpa us keepa the ancient ways

88
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:46,333
Keepa the sacred fire strong

89
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Walk in balance all our days

90
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:54,733
Seasons go and seasons come
steady as the beating drum

91
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:59,000
Plum to seed to bud to palum

92
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,333
Steady as the beating drum

93
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,467
It's good to be home.

94
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,000
The Massawomecks are defeated!

95
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:31,467
With the help of our brothers,
our villages are safe again.

96
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,133
Your return has brought much joy to the village.

97
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:40,333
Look at all the smiling faces.

98
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:44,067
Yes, but there's one smiling face I don't see.

99
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,467
- Where is my daughter?
- You know Pocahontas.

100
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,600
She has her mother's spirit.

101
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:52,200
She goes wherever the wind takes her.

102
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:14,000
Pocahontas!

103
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:18,267
Your father's back!
Come down here!

104
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,467
He's back, Flit.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,933
Come on, Meeko!

106
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,733
No! Not that way.

107
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,867
Show-off.

108
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
Uh-oh!

109
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,467
Pocahontas?

110
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,933
Pocahontas! Are you all right?

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,867
Well, you better be all right
because I'm not coming in after you!

112
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,667
Don't you think we're getting a--
a little old for these games?

113
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,867
Help me turn this thing over.

114
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:46,133
- What were you doing up there?
- Thinking.

115
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:50,600
- Meeko!
- About the dream again? Have you figured it out yet?

116
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:53,400
I know it means something.
I just don't know what.

117
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,467
You should ask your father about it.

118
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,267
Maybe I should.
Come on, Flit.

119
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,267
Quit playing around.
We have to get back.

120
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:08,267
...faced a determined enemy.

121
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:13,267
The battle lasted from the rising of the sun
until the evening shadows fell.

122
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:18,267
Our warriors fought with courage, but none
as bravely as Kocoum...

123
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,333
for he attacked with the fierce strength of the bear.

124
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,800
- He has proven himself to be the greatest of warriors...
- Oh, he is so handsome.

125
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,000
- and the finest among us...
- Hmph. I especially love his smile.

126
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:29,133
destroying every enemy in his path.

127
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,800
Tonight we will feast in his honour.

128
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,400
- My daughter.
- Wing-gapa-o, Father.

129
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:41,067
Seeing you gives me great joy.

130
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
I'm so glad you've come home safely.

131
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:46,800
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.

132
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:49,400
I want to hear everything you've been doing.

133
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:58,133
Father, for many nights now
I've been having a very strange dream.

134
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:01,800
I think it's telling me something's about to happen.
Something exciting.

135
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:06,067
Yes, something exciting is about to happen.

136
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,333
- Really? What is it?
- Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.

137
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:14,200
Marry Kocoum?

138
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,200
I told him it would make my heart soar.

139
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,400
But he's so serious.

140
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:28,467
My daughter, Kocoum will make a fine husband.

141
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:33,000
He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house
with sturdy walls.

142
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,000
With him, you will be safe from harm.

143
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:38,000
Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path.

144
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,733
-This is the right path for you.
-But why can't I choose--

145
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:54,467
Pocahontas, come with me.
You are the daughter of the chief.

146
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:57,067
It is time to take your place among our people.

147
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,467
Even the wild mountain stream...

148
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,867
must someday join the big river.

149
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:06,333
As the river cuts his paath

150
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,933
Though the river's paroud and strong

151
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,733
He will choose the smoothest course

152
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:19,267
That's why rivers live so long.

153
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,067
They're steady

154
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:26,200
As the steady beating drum

155
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:29,333
Your mother wore this for our wedding.

156
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:32,200
It was her dream to see you
wear it at your own.

157
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:37,067
It suits you.

158
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:45,733
He wants me to be steady
like the river.

159
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,933
But it's not steady at all.

160
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,867
What I love most about rivers
is you can't stepa in the same river twice

161
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The water's always changing
always flowing

162
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:06,733
But people, I guess can't live like that
We all must pay a price

163
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,400
To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing

164
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:13,867
What's around the river bend

165
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:17,600
Waiting just around the river bend

166
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,800
I look once more just around the river bend

167
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,133
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free

168
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,333
Don't know what for

169
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,667
What I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend

170
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:36,000
For me

171
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:40,533
Coming for me

172
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:45,400
I feel it there beyond those trees or right
behind these waterfalls

173
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:48,867
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,933
For a handsome sturdy husband who builds
handsome, sturdy walls

175
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:56,867
And never dreams that something might be coming

176
00:13:56,933 --> 00:14:00,533
Just around the river bend

177
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,333
Just around the river bend

178
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:08,067
I look once more just around the river bend

179
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:11,800
Beyond the shore
Somewhere past the sea

180
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:15,800
Don't know what for
Why do all my dreams extend

181
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:19,733
Just around the river bend

182
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,000
Just around the river bend

183
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:29,000
Should I choose the smoothest course

184
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:32,400
Steady as the beating drum

185
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:37,800
Should I marry Kocoum

186
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:41,800
Is all my dreaming at an end

187
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,733
Or do you still

188
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,200
Wait for me

189
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,400
Dream giver

190
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:59,133
Just around the river

191
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:06,867
Bend

192
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:34,267
Is that my Pocahontas?

193
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,067
Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you.

194
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,667
Good morning, child.

195
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,267
I was hoping you'd visit today.

196
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:47,533
Oh! Why, your mother's necklace!

197
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,333
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

198
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,467
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.

199
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,067
Kocoum? But he's so serious.

200
00:15:56,133 --> 00:16:00,067
I know. My father thinks it's the right path for me.

201
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:03,067
But lately, I've been having
this dream and I think it's--

202
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:07,533
Oh, a dream!
Let's hear all about it.

203
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,933
Quiet!

204
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,533
Quiet!

205
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,467
Now, child, you were saying.

206
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,267
Well, I'm running through the woods...

207
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,933
and then, right there in front of me, is an arrow.

208
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,467
As I look at it, it starts to spin.

209
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,267
A spinning arrow.
How unusual.

210
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:38,667
Yes. It spins faster and faster and faster
until suddenly it stops.

211
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,333
Hmm. Well, it seems to me...

212
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,933
this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path.

213
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:51,267
But, Grandmother Willow, what is my path?

214
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,200
How am I ever going to find it?

215
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,800
Your mother asked me the very same question.

216
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,267
She did? What did you tell her?

217
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,333
I told her to listen.

218
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:06,333
All around you are spirits, child.

219
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,533
They live in the earth, the water, the sky.

220
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,333
If you listen, they will guide you.

221
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,067
- I hear the wind.
- Yes.

222
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:23,533
What is it telling you?

223
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,800
I don't understand.

224
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:32,800
You will understand

225
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,667
Listen with your heart

226
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:40,467
You will understand

227
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,533
Let it break upon you

228
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,733
Like a wave upon the sand

229
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,400
It's saying something's coming.
Strange clouds?

230
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:53,667
Listen with your heart

231
00:17:53,867 --> 00:18:00,533
- You will understand
- You will understand

232
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,867
What do you see?

233
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:10,733
Clouds. Strange clouds.

234
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,600
Look at it, Wiggins.
An entire new world chock full of gold...

235
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,733
just waiting for me.

236
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,133
And scores of adventures waiting for us.
Right, Percy?

237
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:29,133
- Do you think we'll meet some savages?
- If we do, we shall be sure...

238
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,000
- to give them a proper English greeting.
- Ooh, gift baskets.

239
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:37,333
Oh, no. And he came so highly recommended.

240
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:43,067
It's perfect, Governor. The water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore.

241
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,267
Hey there, Percy.

242
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:48,867
- Very well, then. Give the order.
- Already done, sir.

243
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,933
I've got a crew assembled
and they're ready to go.

244
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,933
About the natives, I'm counting on you...

245
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:57,133
to make sure those filthy heathens
don't disrupt our mission.

246
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,533
Well, if they're anything like the savages
I've fought before, it's nothing I can't handle.

247
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,733
Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.

248
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,133
See you, Percy.

249
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,267
The men like Smith, don't they?

250
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,667
- I've never been a popular man.
- I like you.

251
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:21,667
And don't think I don't know what those
back stabbers at court say about me.

252
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:25,333
Oh, yes, all that talk about being a pathetic
social climber who's failed at everything...

253
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,667
- He's tried.
- I'm very well aware that this is my last chance for glory.

254
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,400
But mark my words, Wiggins. When King James
sees the gold these peasants unearth...

255
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:37,600
success will be mine at last.

256
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,600
- Wake up! Shake a leg!
- Top off the yardarm!

257
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:46,467
- It's incredible!
- And it's all ours. I've never seen anything like it.

258
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,800
It could look like Ratcliffe's
knickers, for all I care...

259
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,733
just as long as I get off  this stinkin' boat.

260
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,200
Come on, men. We didn't come
all this way just to look at it.

261
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:51,933
Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut.

262
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:56,200
- Steady! Steady!
- Hold up! That's far enough.

263
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,733
All right, now. Tie her off.

264
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,067
Here,John, tie off this end.
John? John?

265
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:08,067
- What are you doing up there?
- Getting a better look.

266
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Hey!

267
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:43,267
Well. You're a
strange-looking fellow.

268
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,867
Are you hungry?
Here you go.

269
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,067
Ah, it's a biscuit.
It's food. Well, sort of.

270
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:56,933
You like it, eh?
Well, try eating it for four months straight.

271
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,667
You got a friend back there?

272
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,867
Hey! Wh-- What? Watch out.

273
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,667
What? Get-- No, get--
Uh, look out.

274
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,733
John, you better get down here.
The governor's coming ashore.

275
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:26,467
All right. All right.
I'm leaving.

276
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:45,200
Did you see their skin?

277
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:47,333
They have hair on their faces like dogs.

278
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,067
My brothers, we must know more
about these visitors.

279
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,133
Kekata, what do you see?

280
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,733
These are not men like us...

281
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:18,867
but strange beasts with bodies
that shine like the sun...

282
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,467
and weapons that spout fire and thunder.

283
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:30,800
They prowl the Earth
like ravenous wolves...

284
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,267
consuming everything in their path.

285
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,667
Great Powhatan, I will lead our
warriors to the river and attack.

286
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,733
We will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

287
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,200
Kocoum, in that battle
we knew how to fight our enemy.

288
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,800
But these pale visitors
are strange to us.

289
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,400
Take some men to the river
to observe them.

290
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,133
Let us hope they do not intend to stay.

291
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:03,067
I hereby claim this land
and all its riches...

292
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,533
in the name of His Majesty
King James the First...

293
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
and do so name this settlement Jamestown.

294
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:14,133
Bravo! Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir.

295
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,067
Hurry now, Percy. We must be all
squeaky clean for the New World.

296
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,533
Captain Smith, it appears I've selected the
perfect location, eh? Not a savage in sight.

297
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:10,000
Just because we don't see them
doesn't mean they're not out there, sir.

298
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,667
Well, then perhaps you should venture forth
and determine their whereabouts, hmm?

299
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:18,333
If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them.

300
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,867
-Now, gentlemen, to work. You men, get the ship unloaded.
-Right, sir.

301
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,867
You men, build the fort.
The rest of you, break out the shovels.

302
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,933
- It's time to start digging.
- Digging?
- Digging?

303
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,333
Why, of course. Let's not forget what the Spanish
found when they came to the New World.

304
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Gold! Mountains of it.

305
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:44,200
Why, for years they've been
ravaging the New World...

306
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:46,400
of its most precious resources...

307
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,400
but now...

308
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,867
it's our turn.

309
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:57,133
The gold of Cortez
The jewels of Pizarro

310
00:25:57,133 --> 00:26:00,867
Will seem like mere trinkets
by this time tomorrow

311
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:04,667
The gold we find here will dwarf them by far

312
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:07,800
Oh, with all you got in ya, boys

313
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:11,800
Dig up Virginia, boys

314
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:15,067
Mine, boys
Mine every mountain

315
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:18,333
And dig, boys
Dig 'til you drop

316
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:22,000
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys

317
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:28,000
Shove in a shovel
Uncover those loverly pebbles that sparkle and shine

318
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:32,133
lt's gold and it's mine

319
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,400
Mine, mine

320
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,333
Dig and dig and diggety dig

321
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,933
And dig and dig and diggety dig

322
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:43,067
- Hei, nonny, nonny. Hei, nonny, nonny
- Ooh, how I love it.

323
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:46,200
- Hei, nonny, nonny. Hei, nonny, nonny
- Riches for cheap.

324
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,267
- Hei, nonny, nonny. Ho, nonny, nonny
- There'll be heaps of it.

325
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:54,267
- And I'll be on top of the heap
- Diggety, diggety, dig

326
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:57,533
My rivals back home
It's not that I'm bitter

327
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,200
But think how they'll squirm
when they see how I glitter

328
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,867
The ladies at court will be all a-twitter

329
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:10,133
The king will reward me
He'll knight me
No, lord me

330
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,933
lt's mine, mine
Mine for the taking

331
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,133
lt's mine, boys
Mine me that gold

332
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:20,000
With those nuggets dug

333
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:22,067
lt's glory they'll gimme

334
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,733
My dear friend King Jimmy
will parobably build me a shrine

335
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,333
- When all of the gold
- When all of the gold

336
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,333
- Is mined
- Dig and dig and diggety dig

337
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,533
And dig and dig and diggety dig

338
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,733
All of my life I have searched
for a land like this one

339
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:50,467
A wilder, more challenging
country I couldn't design

340
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:57,000
Hundreds of dangers await
and I don't palan to miss one

341
00:27:57,067 --> 00:28:00,267
In a land I can claim
A land I can tame

342
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,933
- The greatest adventure is mine
- Keep on working, lads

343
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,867
- Mine
- Don't be shirking, lads

344
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,867
- Mine, boys, mine
- Find a mother lode. Then mine another load

345
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:14,200
- Mine me that gold
- Dig, dig and diggety

346
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,000
- Beautiful gold
- Dig, dig for that gold

347
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:21,000
Make this island my land

348
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:24,200
- Make the mounds big, boys. I'd help you to dig, boys
- Dig, dig

349
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,467
But I've got this crick in my spine

350
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,000
- This land we behold
- This beauty untold

351
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:33,600
- A man can be bold
- It all can be sold

352
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,200
- So go for the gold
- The gold

353
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:38,800
- Is
- All the riches here
- Mine

354
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:41,133
- From this minute this land
- Mine
- And what's in it

355
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:44,667
- Is mine
- And dig and dig and diggety dig

356
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:47,000
Hey, nonny, nonny
It's mine

357
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,467
No! Wait. Please.

358
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,267
Please!

359
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,467
Don't run off.

360
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,467
It's all right.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

361
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,933
Here. Let me help you out of there.

362
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:05,267
You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you?

363
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,533
It's all right.

364
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:31,800
Listen with your heart

365
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,333
You will understand

366
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:45,467
Let it break upon you

367
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:51,067
Like a wave upon the sand

368
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:56,333
- Who are you?
- Listen with your heart

369
00:32:56,467 --> 00:33:01,467
You will understand

370
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,933
Pocahontas.

371
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,400
What? What did you say?

372
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,067
My name is Pocahontas.

373
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm John Smith.

374
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,133
That's it.
Keep at it, men.

375
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,933
Keep digging. It's got to be here somewhere.

376
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:31,600
-There's 30 more of them down by the ridge.
-That makes more than a hundred.

377
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,267
- Anything yet?
- Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.

378
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:39,267
- Um, how long are we going to
keep digging like this, sir?
- Aye.

379
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,867
We're slaving away, busting our backs
day and night...

380
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,333
- for--
- For king and country. I know, I know.

381
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,067
And I share your fatigue.
Mmm. Wiggins?

382
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:51,800
- Wiggins?
- Coming!

383
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,733
Dispose of this.

384
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:59,933
Who's a good doggy, hmm?
Who's a good doggy?

385
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,267
Fetch, boy!

386
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,667
- Savages! It's an ambush! Arm yourselves!
- Run!

387
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,733
Arm yourselves!

388
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,200
Make sure every manhas a musket.

389
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,400
Shoot!

390
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,533
Them, you idiot!

391
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:37,267
Where's that blasted Smith when I need him?

392
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,067
Namontack!

393
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,333
Back to the village.

394
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,200
Shut up. Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back.

395
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,533
Everyone, back to camp. Get the rest of
the cannons ashore and finish building the fort!

396
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Aye, Governor.

397
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:15,200
And you.

398
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:17,533
Learn to use that thing properly.

399
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:21,200
A man's not a man unless he knows how to shoot.

400
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,800
These beasts invade our shores, and now this.

401
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,200
This wound is strange to me.

402
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:46,067
We will fight this enemy, but we cannot
do it alone.

403
00:35:46,267 --> 00:35:49,933
Kocoum, send messengers
to every village in our nation.

404
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,400
We will call on our brothers to help us fight.

405
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:55,267
These white men are dangerous.

406
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,800
No one is to go near them.

407
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:04,733
- It's called a helmet.
- Helmet.

408
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,600
- So, uh, what river is this?
- Qui-yough-co-hannock.

409
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:14,600
You have the most unusual names here.

410
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,600
Pocahontas.

411
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:24,867
You have the most unusual name too.

412
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,733
John Smith.

413
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:30,333
Hey!

414
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Is this bottomless pit a friend of yours?

415
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,333
Meeko!

416
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:36,733
Well, how do you do, Meeko?

417
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:43,333
It's all right. It's just a handshake.
Here, let me show you.

418
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:50,400
- Nothing's happening.
- Uh, no, no. I need your hand first.

419
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:58,333
It's how we say hello.

420
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,600
This is how we say hello.

421
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:13,400
And how we say goodbye.

422
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,267
I like hello better.

423
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah, I remember you.

424
00:37:26,267 --> 00:37:28,333
Flit just doesn't like strangers.

425
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,333
Well, I'm not a stranger any more.

426
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:32,933
Hmm. Stubborn little fellow, isn't he?

427
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:35,067
Very stubborn.

428
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,067
Hey!

429
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:40,000
Meeko, come back here.

430
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:43,400
Don't worry. He can't hurt it.
Hey! What are you doing? Get--

431
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:46,200
- Meeko, bring that back!
- N-No, it's all right.

432
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,267
He can keep it. Call it a gift.

433
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,733
- What was that?
- My compass.

434
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,733
- Compass?
- It tells you how to find
your way when you get lost.

435
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:59,000
But it's all right.
I'll get another one in London.

436
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:01,600
- London. Is that your village?
- Yes.

437
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:04,067
- It's a very big village.
- What's it like?

438
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:08,733
Well, it's got streets filled with carriages,
bridges over the rivers...

439
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,467
and buildings as tall as trees.

440
00:38:11,533 --> 00:38:13,533
- I'd like to see those things.
- You will.

441
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:15,400
-How?
-We're going to build them here.

442
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,867
We'll show your people how to use this
land properly, how to make the most of it.

443
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:22,000
- Make the most of it?
- Yes.

444
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,400
- We'll build roads and decent houses and--
- Our houses are fine.

445
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:29,533
You think that only because
you don't know any better.

446
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,867
W-Wait a minute.
Don't take it tha-- Hey. Hey!

447
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:37,867
Wait! Wa-Wait!

448
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:40,000
There's so much we can teach you.

449
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,200
- We've improved the lives of savages
all over the world.
- Savages?

450
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,400
Uh, not that you're a savage.

451
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:50,133
-Just my people.
- No. Listen. That's not what
I meant. Let me explain, uh--

452
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,267
- Let go!
- No, I'm not letting you leave.

453
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,933
Look, don't do this.

454
00:38:57,067 --> 00:39:00,600
Savage is just a word, uh, you know.

455
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:05,467
- A term for people who are uncivilized.
- Like me.

456
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:09,933
Well, when I say uncivilized, what I mean is, is--

457
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:23,200
What you mean is, not like you.

458
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,133
You think I'm an ignorant savage

459
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:31,067
And you've been so many palaces
I guess it must be so

460
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:33,800
But still I cannot see

461
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:37,267
If the savage one is me

462
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:43,000
How can there be so much that you don't know

463
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:48,133
You don't know

464
00:39:56,133 --> 00:40:01,000
You think you own whatever land you land on

465
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:05,600
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim

466
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:10,067
But I know every rock and tree and creature

467
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:12,533
Has a life, has a spirit

468
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:14,867
Has a name

469
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:19,333
You think the only people who are people

470
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:23,600
Are the people who look
and think like you

471
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:27,867
But if you walk the footstepas
of a stranger

472
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:32,733
You'll learn things
you never knew you never knew

473
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:37,600
Have you ever heard the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon

474
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:41,933
Or asked the grinning bobcat
why he grinned

475
00:40:41,933 --> 00:40:46,600
Can you sing with all the voices
of the mountain

476
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,600
Can you paint
with all the colours of the wind

477
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:55,133
Can you paint
with all the colours

478
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,800
Of the wind

479
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,733
Come run the hidden paine trails
of the forest

480
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,000
Come taste the sun sweet berries
of the Earth

481
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:17,867
Come roll in all the riches
all around you

482
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,600
And for once never wonder
what they're worth

483
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,667
The rainstorm and the river
are my brothers

484
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,400
The heron and the otter
are my friends

485
00:41:31,467 --> 00:41:35,533
And we are all connected
to each other

486
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,533
In a circle
In a hoop that never ends

487
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:44,867
How high does the sycamore grow

488
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:50,800
If you cut it down then you'll never know

489
00:41:50,867 --> 00:41:56,667
And you'll never hear the wolf
cry to the blue corn moon

490
00:41:56,733 --> 00:42:01,200
For whether we are white or copapaer-skinned

491
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:06,000
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain

492
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:11,000
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind

493
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:13,933
You can own the Earth and still

494
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:17,400
All you'll own is earth until

495
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:20,333
You can paint

496
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,533
With all the colours

497
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:33,200
Of the wind

498
00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:49,867
What is it?

499
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:51,733
The drums.

500
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:55,800
They mean trouble. I shouldn't be here.

501
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:58,000
- I want to see you again.
- I can't.

502
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,267
- Please, don't leave.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:05,200
I have to go.

504
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:18,067
All right!
This one's ready to hoist!

505
00:43:18,267 --> 00:43:20,800
- Two on each side.
- Ready now. Push!

506
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:25,667
- Watch it. It's slippery.
- Come on, lads. It's only a little picket fence.

507
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,000
- Steady. Steady.
- There you go.

508
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:30,800
That'll keep everything out, eh,John?

509
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:35,067
- Something wrong,John?
- What?

510
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:37,267
You've been awfully quiet the last few days.

511
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:39,933
Oh, he's just mad that he missed all the action.

512
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,067
Ah, don't worry,John. You'll get your chance
to deal with the Indians.

513
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:46,933
Yeah, we'll take care of them like we did
last time, eh, mates?

514
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,267
We shot ourselves an Injun or maybe two or three

515
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,867
All right, you howling nutter, get to work!

516
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,400
Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.

517
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,467
Oh, sure, we're having loads of fun, right?

518
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,533
Look at us. No gold, no food.

519
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,133
While Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day,
happy as a clam.

520
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:08,533
I am doomed!

521
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,267
I should be wallowing in riches by now and I haven't
found as much as a speck!

522
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:15,733
Think. Think!

523
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:20,467
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Where could it be?

524
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,533
I've mined the forests and the hills and the swamps.

525
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,533
And nothing!

526
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,667
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?

527
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,600
I-- I--

528
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:39,600
I made it myself.

529
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,933
Take that silly--

530
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,200
Of course! The Indians.

531
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:47,733
Wiggins, why do you think those
insolent heathens attacked us?

532
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:51,133
Because we invaded their land and cut down
their trees and dug up their earth?

533
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,467
It's the gold! They have it and they don't
want us to take it from them.

534
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,667
Well, I'll just have to take it
by force, then, won't I?

535
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:04,467
You there!
Where's Captain Smith?

536
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:06,733
Well, he's gone.

537
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,067
Aye. Your singing must have scared them off.

538
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:12,733
- Well, then go get him, for heaven's sake!
- What if we run into the Indians?

539
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,533
That's what guns are for.

540
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,933
Now arm yourselves and get moving!

541
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,133
Pocahontas.

542
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:48,267
You should be inside the village.

543
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:53,000
- We'll be all right.
- We're gathering food for when the warriors arrive.

544
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,733
- Don't go far. Now is not the time to be running off.
- Yes, Father.

545
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,667
When I see you wear that necklace...

546
00:46:01,733 --> 00:46:04,200
you look just like your mother.

547
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:08,400
- I miss her.
- But she is still with us.

548
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:12,467
Whenever the wind moves through the trees,
I feel her presence.

549
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:15,600
Our people looked to her for wisdom and strength.

550
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:18,400
Someday, they will look to you as well.

551
00:46:18,467 --> 00:46:21,267
I would be honoured by that.

552
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:24,200
You shouldn't be out here alone.
I'll send for Kocoum.

553
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:27,467
- All right. What is it?
- What?

554
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:30,200
- You're hiding something.
- I'm not hiding anything.

555
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:33,467
Pocahontas, you can tell me.
I promise I won't tell anyone.

556
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:36,533
Pocahontas, look!

557
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,667
- It's one of them! I'm going to get--
- What are you doing here?

558
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,733
- I had to see you again.
- Huh?

559
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:48,800
Pocahontas. Pocahontas?

560
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:52,867
- Please, don't say anything. Quick, this way.
- But--

561
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:55,733
- Nakoma.
- Huh?
- Where is Pocahontas?

562
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:59,600
I-- I haven't seen her.

563
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:03,600
Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.

564
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:07,067
Tell her that. She listens to you.

565
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:11,200
Huh. Sure she does.

566
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,400
This place is incredible.

567
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:32,533
And to think we came all this
way just to dig it up for gold.

568
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,667
- Gold?
- Hey, Meeko.

569
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,667
- What's gold?
- You know, it's, uh-- it's, it's yellow.

570
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,600
It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.

571
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,000
Oh! Here, we have lots of it.
Gold.

572
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,800
No. Gold is this.

573
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:51,533
Hmm. There's nothing like that around here.

574
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,467
- No gold.
- Not that I've seen.

575
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:59,867
All this way for nothing.
Well, those boys are in for a big surprise.

576
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:02,200
- Will they leave?
- Some of them might.

577
00:48:04,733 --> 00:48:09,333
- Will you go home?
- Well, it's not like I have much of a home to go back to.

578
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,867
I've never really belonged anywhere.

579
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:14,600
You could belong here.

580
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:26,133
- What was that?
- Did you see something?

581
00:48:26,267 --> 00:48:29,133
No. No. I just, uh-- I--

582
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,333
I didn't see anything, did I?

583
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:35,133
Look again.

584
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:37,933
Let it break upon you

585
00:48:38,133 --> 00:48:43,667
Like a wave upon the sand

586
00:48:43,733 --> 00:48:46,667
Hello, John Smith.

587
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,600
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

588
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:51,933
Then you should talk back.

589
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,800
Don't be frightened, young man.
My bark is worse than my bite.

590
00:48:58,267 --> 00:49:01,733
- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?

591
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,533
Anything you want.

592
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:11,533
- So, uh--
- Come closer,John Smith.

593
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,000
He has a good soul. And he's handsome too.

594
00:49:17,067 --> 00:49:20,467
- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would.

595
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,933
Smith! Smith!
Where are you, mate?

596
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,600
- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.

597
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:30,467
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.

598
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,533
Aye. Well, if you spot one, don't ask questions.

599
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:36,733
Just shoot.

600
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:40,600
- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me. It was the tree.

601
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:44,133
Oh, of course! The tree
just felt like lifting its roots and--

602
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:50,133
Let's get out of here.

603
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,133
- Ow!
- Ow! Run!

604
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,400
- But what about Smith?
- He's a big lad. He can take care of himself.

605
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,933
- I'm glad you're on our side.
- There's still some snap in these old vines.

606
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,667
I'd better get back before
they send the whole camp out after me.

607
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,800
- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight. Right here.

608
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,600
Well, I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.

609
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:22,800
What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing him again.
I mean, I want to see him again.

610
00:50:22,867 --> 00:50:25,933
Who wouldn't?
I want to see him again.

611
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But still, something inside is telling me
it's the right thing.

612
00:50:30,067 --> 00:50:33,333
- Perhaps it's your dream.
- My dream?

613
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:36,800
Do you think he's the one the
spinning arrow was pointing to?

614
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,067
Hmm.

615
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,800
The warriors are here!

616
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:02,067
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?

617
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:04,733
- There you are.
- Kocoum.
- Look at them.

618
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,933
Now we have enough warriors
to destroy those white demons.

619
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,200
Now that we are joined by our brothers...

620
00:51:12,267 --> 00:51:15,600
we will defeat this enemy.

621
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,933
- Father, I need to speak with you.
- Not now, my daughter.

622
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,600
- The council is gathering.
- We don't have to fight them!
There must be a better way.

623
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:32,533
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

624
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,800
- But maybe we should try talking to them.
- They do not want to talk.

625
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,667
But if one of them did want to talk, you would
listen to him, wouldn't you?

626
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:43,200
- Pocahontas.
- Wouldn't you?

627
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,933
Of course I would. But it is not that simple.

628
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:50,133
Nothing is simple any more.

629
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:35,867
Easy, Thomas. It's me.

630
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,533
Oh,John. I could've killed you.

631
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:43,200
Not aiming like that, you couldn't.
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.

632
00:52:43,467 --> 00:52:45,733
You'll see twice as well.

633
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:49,667
- Smith, there you are!
- We were looking all over for you.

634
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:52,733
Smith! Where have you been?

635
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:55,533
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.

636
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:58,067
Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.

637
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,867
- We'll need that information for the battle.
- What battle?

638
00:53:00,933 --> 00:53:03,800
We will eliminate these savages once and for all.

639
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,200
No! You can't do that.

640
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,267
Oh, can't I?

641
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:10,800
Look, we don't have to fight them.

642
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:13,133
- John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them.

643
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,667
- You what?
- A savage?

644
00:53:15,867 --> 00:53:18,067
They're not savages.
They can help us.

645
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,867
They know the land.
They know how to navigate the rivers.

646
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,133
- And look. It's food.
- What is it?

647
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:28,467
- It's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure.
- I like gruel.

648
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:31,000
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!

649
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:33,733
They want to kill us, all of us!

650
00:53:33,733 --> 00:53:36,800
They've got our gold, and they'll do anything
to keep it!

651
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,133
- But there is no gold.
- No gold?

652
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,733
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?

653
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:48,667
- Yes.
- Lies! Lies! All of it!

654
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,067
Murderous thieves!
There's no room for their kind in civilized society.

655
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:57,000
- But this is their land!
- This is my land! I make the laws here.

656
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:01,133
And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian...

657
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:04,533
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason...

658
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:07,000
and hanged!

659
00:54:11,733 --> 00:54:13,800
- Pocahontas!
- Nakoma!

660
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:16,467
Don't go out there.
I lied for you once.

661
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,867
- Don't ask me to do it again.
- I have to do this.

662
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:22,200
- He's one of them.
- You don't know him.

663
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,200
If you go out there, you'll be turning your back
on your own people.

664
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,733
I'm trying to help my people.

665
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,333
Pocahontas, please.
You're my best friend.

666
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,667
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I won't.

667
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:36,600
- I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no !

668
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,067
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world for nothin'.

669
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,667
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?

670
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,000
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been lying to us
since we left London.

671
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:55,000
Listen to you, ya bunch of idiots.

672
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,200
Those savages didn't attack us for nothin'.
They're hidin' somethin'.

673
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:02,667
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight 'em.

674
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:05,400
- Not me.
- Either too hot or too cool.

675
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:07,800
I haven't been comfortable since we got here.

676
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:12,600
Oh, I know.
I've been itching a lot.

677
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:21,267
- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.

678
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:24,267
- I want to know where he's sneaking off to.
- Yes, sir.

679
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:29,400
And if you happen to see any Indians, shoot them.

680
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:38,467
Oh, and Thomas, you've been a slipshod sailor and
a poor excuse for a soldier.

681
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,733
Don't disappoint me again.

682
00:55:50,867 --> 00:55:53,800
- Kocoum.
- What is it?

683
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,667
- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?

684
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:02,800
I think she's in trouble.

685
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:09,333
The Earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?

686
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,600
- The warriors are here!
- Pocahontas!

687
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:13,933
John.

688
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:17,933
Listen to me. My men are
planning to attack your people.

689
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,533
- You've got to warn them.
- Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

690
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,667
You have to come with me
and talk to my father.

691
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:26,333
Pocahontas, talking isn't
going to do any good.

692
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,467
I already tried talking to my men, but
everything about this land has them spooked.

693
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,467
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen.

694
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,533
Percy.

695
00:56:45,867 --> 00:56:48,267
- Easy, Percy. Come here!
- Meeko, come back!

696
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:51,133
You see what I mean?
Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them.

697
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:54,467
- Come-- Come here, both of you!
- It's all right! It's all right! He's a friend!

698
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,733
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

699
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,733
- What are you doing? Meeko!
- Percy, get back here!

700
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,867
- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough!

701
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:14,267
It's enough to make your sap boil.

702
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:20,267
Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look.

703
00:57:24,267 --> 00:57:27,467
- The ripples.
- What about them?

704
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:32,000
So small at first, then look how they grow.

705
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,667
But someone has to start them.

706
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,333
They're not going to listen to us.

707
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,600
Young man, sometimes the right
path is not the easiest one.

708
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,600
Don't you see?

709
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:49,800
Only when the fighting stops can you be together.

710
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:55,733
All right. Let's go talk to your father.

711
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:30,467
No!

712
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:34,067
Kocoum! No!

713
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:42,333
Kocoum!

714
00:58:45,467 --> 00:58:47,400
Leave him alone!

715
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:05,200
Kocoum! Stop!

716
00:59:07,467 --> 00:59:09,733
Both eyes open.

717
00:59:18,067 --> 00:59:19,867
Thomas!

718
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:22,600
- Is he--
- You killed him.

719
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,600
- I thought that--
- Get away from him!

720
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:28,000
- Pocahontas, it won't help! He was only--
- He killed him!

721
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,800
Thomas, get out of here!

722
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,733
Get out of here!

723
01:00:38,867 --> 01:00:42,467
- Who did this?
- Pocahontas was out in the woods.

724
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:45,333
Kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked him.

725
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:52,200
Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger is stronger.

726
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:56,333
- At sunrise he will be the first to die.
- But, Father--

727
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:59,467
I told you to stay in the village.

728
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:03,400
You disobeyed me. You have shamed your father!

729
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:05,200
I was only trying to help.

730
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:09,200
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!

731
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,600
Take him away!

732
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:28,067
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.

733
01:01:28,133 --> 01:01:32,000
Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you.

734
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:36,067
I was worried about you.

735
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:38,467
I-I thought I was doing the right thing.

736
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:41,800
All this happened because of me.

737
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,733
And now I'll never see John Smith again.

738
01:01:46,933 --> 01:01:48,867
Come with me.

739
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:57,067
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes
of the man who killed Kocoum.

740
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,867
Be quick.

741
01:02:19,867 --> 01:02:21,600
Pocahontas.

742
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,400
- I'm so sorry.
- For what, this?

743
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,800
I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this.
Can't think of any right now, but--

744
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,800
It would've been better if we'd never met.
None of this would've happened.

745
01:02:35,867 --> 01:02:38,733
Pocahontas, look at me.

746
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:41,400
I'd rather die tomorrow...

747
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:44,800
than live a hundred years without knowing you.

748
01:02:44,867 --> 01:02:46,600
Pocahontas.

749
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:49,600
- I can't leave you.
- You never will.

750
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:54,400
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.

751
01:03:07,467 --> 01:03:10,867
Help! Somebody help!
Help! Help!

752
01:03:10,933 --> 01:03:14,067
- Easy, lad. What is it?
- It's Smith! They got him!

753
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,867
- Who got him?
- The savages!

754
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:18,533
- Savages?
- They captured him, dragged him off!

755
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,333
- Where'd they take him?
- They headed north.

756
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,400
- How many were there?
- I don't know. At least a dozen.

757
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,867
- Filthy beasts!
- Ratcliffe was right!

758
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:28,667
It's perfect, Wiggins.
I couldn't have planned this better myself.

759
01:03:28,733 --> 01:03:31,800
The gold is as good as mine.

760
01:03:31,867 --> 01:03:34,667
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us!

761
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,067
- Thomas is right! We've got to do somethin'!
- And so we shall.

762
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:41,933
- I told you those savages couldn't be trusted.
- That's right!

763
01:03:42,133 --> 01:03:45,267
Smith tried to befriend them,
and look what they've done to him!

764
01:03:45,267 --> 01:03:49,400
- Yeah, that's right.
- But now I say it's time to rescue our courageous comrade.

765
01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:53,067
At daybreak, we attack!

766
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:56,467
What can you expect from filthy little heathens

767
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:59,667
- Here's what you get when races are diverse
- That's right.

768
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,267
Their skins are hellish red
They're only good when dead

769
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:06,200
They're vermin, as I said and worse

770
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,333
- They're savages, savages
- Barely even human

771
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,733
- Savages, savages
- Drive them from our shore

772
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,067
They're not like you and me
which means they must be evil

773
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,067
We must sound the drums of war

774
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:23,933
They're savages, savages
Dirty shrieking devils

775
01:04:24,133 --> 01:04:27,733
Now we sound the drums of war

776
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:36,000
This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon

777
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:39,200
The only thing they feel at all is greed

778
01:04:39,267 --> 01:04:42,733
Beneath that milky hide there's empatiness inside

779
01:04:42,933 --> 01:04:45,533
I wonder if they even bleed

780
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,667
- They're savages, savages
- Barely even human

781
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:52,800
- Savages, savages
- Killers at the core

782
01:04:52,867 --> 01:04:56,600
They're different from us
which means they can't be trusted

783
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:59,667
We must sound the drums of war

784
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:03,467
- They're savages, savages
- First we deal with this one

785
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:06,667
- Then we sound the drums of war
- Savages, savages

786
01:05:06,867 --> 01:05:08,467
Let's go get a few, men!

787
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,000
- Savages, savages
- Now it's up to you, men

788
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:13,867
- Savages
- Savages

789
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:15,600
Barely even human

790
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:19,133
Now we sound the drums

791
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,667
Of

792
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:27,533
War

793
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:35,467
- They're going to kill him at sunrise, Grandmother Willow.
- You have to stop them.

794
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:39,067
- I can't.
- Child, remember your dream.

795
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,000
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.
I followed the wrong path.

796
01:05:43,133 --> 01:05:45,467
I feel so lost.

797
01:06:02,733 --> 01:06:05,000
The compass?

798
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:14,733
Spinning arrow.

799
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:16,933
It's the arrow from your dream.

800
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:20,400
I was right!
It was pointing to him.

801
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:29,533
- Sunrise.
- It's not too late, child.

802
01:06:29,733 --> 01:06:33,667
Let the spirits of the Earth guide you.

803
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,267
You know your path, child.

804
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:39,467
Now follow it!

805
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:44,600
This will be the day

806
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,533
Let's go, men!

807
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:50,400
This will be the morning

808
01:06:50,533 --> 01:06:53,000
Bring out the prisoner!

809
01:06:53,067 --> 01:06:54,800
We will see them dying in the dust

810
01:06:54,867 --> 01:06:58,000
I don't know what I can do
Still, I know I've got to try

811
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,400
- Now we make 'em paay
- Eagle, helpa my feet to fly

812
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:04,933
- Now, without a warning
- Mountain, help my heart be great

813
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:06,533
Now we leave 'em blood and bone and rust

814
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,267
- Spirits of the Earth and sky
- lt's them or us

815
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,933
- Please don't let it be too late
- They're just a bunch of

816
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:16,267
- Filthy, stinking savages
- Savages

817
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,000
- Demon
- Devil
- Kill them!

818
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,933
- Savages, savages
- What are we waiting for

819
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,600
Destroy their evil race
until there's not a trace left

820
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:27,200
- How loud
- We will sound the drums of war

821
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,267
- Are the drums of war
- Now we sound the drums of war

822
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:34,667
- Now we see what comes of trying to be chums
- Now we sound the drums

823
01:07:34,733 --> 01:07:39,667
- Is the death of all I love carried in the drumming of
- Of

824
01:07:39,867 --> 01:07:41,533
- War
- No!

825
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,733
If you kill him, you'll have to kill me too.

826
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,133
Daughter, stand back.

827
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:55,267
I won't! I love him, Father.

828
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,067
What?

829
01:08:01,133 --> 01:08:06,467
Look around you.
This is where the path of hatred has brought us.

830
01:08:09,133 --> 01:08:13,000
This is the path I choose,
Father. What will yours be?

831
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:51,867
My daughter speaks with
a wisdom beyond her years.

832
01:08:51,933 --> 01:08:55,067
We have all come here with anger in our hearts...

833
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:59,200
but she comes with courage and understanding.

834
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:03,400
From this day forward,
if there is to be more killing...

835
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,733
it will not start with me.

836
01:09:09,133 --> 01:09:11,333
Release him.

837
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,467
Now's our chance! Fire!

838
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,400
- No!
- What?

839
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:35,133
- They let him go.
- They don't want to fight.

840
01:09:35,267 --> 01:09:38,333
It's a trick! Don't you see?
Fire!

841
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:46,400
Fine. I'll settle this myself.

842
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:50,000
No!

843
01:09:50,133 --> 01:09:51,333
John!

844
01:09:57,267 --> 01:10:02,067
- You shot him!
- He stepped right-- right into it. It's his own fault.

845
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:04,600
- Smith was right all along.
- We never should've listened to you.

846
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:07,067
- Get the gun!
- Traitors!

847
01:10:07,133 --> 01:10:09,067
Unhand me, I say!
How dare you!

848
01:10:09,267 --> 01:10:13,600
- Put him in chains!
- I'll see you all hanged for this!

849
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,600
And gag him as well!

850
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,267
- Is he gonna make it, Thomas?
- The sooner he gets back to England, the better.

851
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,267
- Well, let's hope the wind is with him.
- Is the ship ready yet?

852
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,267
Any minute now.Just loadin'
the last bit of cargo.

853
01:10:40,933 --> 01:10:43,600
How dare you!
Untie me at once!

854
01:10:43,733 --> 01:10:46,533
I'll have your heads for this!

855
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,267
And he came so highly recommended.

856
01:10:58,333 --> 01:11:02,733
The ship's almost ready.
We'd better get you on board.
We'll lose the tide.

857
01:11:02,933 --> 01:11:04,600
No, not yet.

858
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:07,867
- She said she'd be here.
- Look.

859
01:11:34,933 --> 01:11:39,200
Going back is his only chance.
He'll die if he stays here.

860
01:11:48,133 --> 01:11:52,533
Here. It's from Grandmother Willow's bark.

861
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,600
It'll help with the pain.

862
01:11:54,667 --> 01:11:57,667
What pain? I've had worse pain than this.

863
01:11:59,067 --> 01:12:01,933
Can't think of any right now, but--

864
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:10,667
You are always welcome among our people.

865
01:12:10,733 --> 01:12:13,200
Thank you, my brother.

866
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:18,467
I thought you didn't like strangers.

867
01:12:27,467 --> 01:12:29,467
My mother's necklace.

868
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,333
See ya, Percy.

869
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:53,533
Come with me?

870
01:12:58,067 --> 01:13:00,467
You must choose your own path.

871
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,067
I'm needed here.

872
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:21,600
Then I'll stay with you.

873
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:25,200
No. You have to go back.

874
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:28,733
- But I can't leave you.
- You never will.

875
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:33,333
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you.

876
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,467
Forever.

877
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:04,400
- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed,John.

878
01:14:10,933 --> 01:14:13,067
- The crew a-ready?
- Aye, sir!

879
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,133
Set the mainsails!

880
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,133
Weigh anchor!

881
01:14:21,267 --> 01:14:24,800
- Let go of the topgallants!
- Aye, sir!

882
01:15:44,467 --> 01:15:48,733
lf I never knew you

883
01:15:48,867 --> 01:15:53,200
lf I never felt this love

884
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,400
I would have no inkling of

885
01:15:57,467 --> 01:16:02,333
How precious life can be

886
01:16:02,467 --> 01:16:06,667
And I'm so grateful to you

887
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:10,867
I'd have lived my whole life through

888
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:13,467
Lost forever

889
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:19,867
lf I never knew you

890
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,600
lf I never knew you

891
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:31,067
I'd be safe but half as real

892
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:35,133
Never knowing I could feel

893
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:40,000
A love so strong and true

894
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:46,533
- Oh, if I never knew you
- There's no moment I'd regret

895
01:16:46,533 --> 01:16:51,467
- lf I never knew your love
- Since the moment that we met

896
01:16:51,533 --> 01:16:54,933
- I would have no inkling of
- lf our time has gone too fast

897
01:16:55,133 --> 01:17:01,400
- How precious life can be
- I've lived at last

898
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,467
Yeah, yeah

899
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,467
I thought our love would be so beautiful

900
01:17:09,533 --> 01:17:10,733
So beautiful

901
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:15,467
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright

902
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:19,933
I thought our love would be so beautiful

903
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,867
We'd turn the darkness into light

904
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:29,067
And still my heart is saying we were right

905
01:17:29,133 --> 01:17:30,800
We were right

906
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,467
- And if I never knew you
- lf I never knew you

907
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,067
I'd have lived my whole life through

908
01:17:41,267 --> 01:17:45,467
Empty as the sky

909
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:51,467
Never knowing why

910
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,467
Lost forever

911
01:17:54,533 --> 01:17:59,533
If I never knew

912
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,667
You

913
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:09,267
Yeah

914
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:31,067
You think you own whatever land you land on

915
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:36,800
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim

916
01:18:36,867 --> 01:18:41,933
But I know every rock and tree and creature

917
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,267
Has a life, has a spirit

918
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,400
Has a name

919
01:18:48,467 --> 01:18:54,000
You think the only people
who are people

920
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,600
Are the people who look
and think like you

921
01:18:59,733 --> 01:19:05,133
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger

922
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:10,733
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

923
01:19:10,867 --> 01:19:13,933
Have you ever heard the wolf cry

924
01:19:13,933 --> 01:19:16,800
To the blue corn moon

925
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:22,133
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been

926
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:28,267
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain

927
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:33,867
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

928
01:19:33,933 --> 01:19:40,133
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

929
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:45,400
How high does the sycamore grow

930
01:19:45,467 --> 01:19:48,067
lf you cut it down

931
01:19:48,133 --> 01:19:53,733
Then you'll never know

932
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:57,133
And you'll never hear the wolf cry

933
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,000
To the blue corn moon

934
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,933
For whether we are white or copapaer-skinned

935
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:11,200
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain

936
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:17,200
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind

937
01:20:17,267 --> 01:20:19,800
You can own the Earth and still

938
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,200
All you'll own is earth until

939
01:20:24,267 --> 01:20:28,800
You can paint with all the colours

940
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:30,800
Of

941
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:35,933
The wind

942
