8

You purchase an unrated DVD to view
with your friends. Only with your friends...

9
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,535
Only to find that you got the same
old movie with a few extra curse words,

10
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,912
and maybe an additional tit or two.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,040
-What a jip.
-And how...

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,458
Not this time.

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,712
That's right, John.
On this unrated DVD we promise you,

15
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:53,135

-Plus, we promise more tits.

That's good cock, John.

21
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,739
That's right, John, and that's not all,
we promise lots of additional scenes,

22
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:18,160

that will make the movie way too long.

23
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,996

of filmmaking for you,

29
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:39,014

02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:12,824
Again?

1810
02:02:14,076 --> 02:02:15,535
Damn, yes.

1811
02:02:18,205 --> 02:02:20,248
-Felicia, you want to do this?
-Yes.

1812
02:02:26,797 --> 02:02:28,214
(LAUGHlNG)

1813
02:02:29,091 --> 02:02:30,884
Oh, that was awesome!

1814
02:03:11,133 --> 02:03:15,053
-Hey, boys. You get some rest?
-Thanks, man. Thanks for fixing the bus.

1815
02:03:15,137 --> 02:03:16,888
-A pleasure.
-Yeah, thanks for fixing our bus.

1816
02:03:16,972 --> 02:03:19,349
-Appreciate it.
-Thanks for playing that show for us, too.

1817
02:03:19,433 --> 02:03:22,727
-Yeah, no worries.
-lt was a nice five-song set.

1818
02:03:22,812 --> 02:03:25,230
Yeah, what do you guys typically...

1819
02:03:25,314 --> 02:03:27,732
l assume you get compensated
very well for that.

1820
02:03:27,817 --> 02:03:30,693
-Must be a good living.
-Yeah, we do. l mean...

1821
02:03:30,778 --> 02:03:33,655
Yeah, you know, l...
Gosh, if l was really to calculate

1822
02:03:33,739 --> 02:03:36,866
what you'd lose if this bus
couldn't have gotten back on the road,

1823
02:03:36,951 --> 02:03:38,118
if you couldn't have gotten to your shows,

1824
02:03:38,202 --> 02:03:43,081
l imagine all those weeping teenage girls
outside, "l need to dance."

1825
02:03:43,165 --> 02:03:46,084
Could we send you some pictures?
We don't really have cash or anything.

1826
02:03:46,168 --> 02:03:49,129
-Some autographed photos?
-Or we could give you CDs.

1827
02:03:49,213 --> 02:03:51,423
Yeah, we've got a lot of use
for that around here.

1828
02:03:51,507 --> 02:03:53,591
There is a lot of work
that needs to be done around here.

1829
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:57,971
-You guys are some strapping young lads.
-l don't know if we're really built for that.

1830
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:01,933
-Yeah.
-l can hear you.

1831
02:04:02,017 --> 02:04:04,394
l'm just saying,
you guys put in a 20-minute show,

1832
02:04:04,478 --> 02:04:06,104
-we spent all night on the bus...
-Yeah.

1833
02:04:06,188 --> 02:04:07,355
l mean, that was a lot of work.

1834
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:09,607
We could maybe try
to write a check later on,

1835
02:04:09,692 --> 02:04:12,152
or like l said,
we could send you guys some CDs.

1836
02:04:12,236 --> 02:04:14,446
City folk are always trying to solve things
with money.

1837
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:16,573
lt's the spirit of the community
around here.

1838
02:04:16,657 --> 02:04:19,159
Lord, please bless this Fall Out Boy.

1839
02:04:19,243 --> 02:04:21,995
Keep him safe on the road.

1840
02:04:22,079 --> 02:04:25,165
Help him to aspire
to the heights of Jon Bon Jovi.

1841
02:04:25,249 --> 02:04:26,458
-Help him to...
-Thanks.

1842
02:04:26,542 --> 02:04:28,460
-Okay, thanks, man.
-Thanks, man. We gotta roll.

1843
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:30,462
-Amen.
-We gotta roll, man. Thank you very much.

1844
02:04:30,546 --> 02:04:32,088
All right, boys.
lt was a pleasure meeting you.

1845
02:04:32,173 --> 02:04:35,133
l loved your penis on the lnternet,
by the way.

1846
02:04:35,217 --> 02:04:37,260
-Fucking asshole!
-You're a dick!

1847
02:04:38,012 --> 02:04:39,888
(I DON'T CARE PLAYlNG)

1848
02:04:53,694 --> 02:04:57,614
Say my name and his in the same breath

1849
02:04:57,698 --> 02:05:01,159
I dare you to say they taste the same

1850
02:05:01,243 --> 02:05:04,746
Let the leaves fall off in the summer

1851
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:07,916
And let December glow feel flames

1852
02:05:08,459 --> 02:05:11,544
Brace myself and let go

1853
02:05:11,629 --> 02:05:15,173
Start it over again in Mexico

1854
02:05:15,257 --> 02:05:19,052
These friends, they don't love you

1855
02:05:19,136 --> 02:05:22,805
They just love the hotel suites, now

1856
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:25,934
I don't care what you think

1857
02:05:26,018 --> 02:05:29,687
As long as it's about me

1858
02:05:29,813 --> 02:05:32,982
The best of us can find happiness

1859
02:05:33,108 --> 02:05:36,277
In misery

1860
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:40,198

In misery

1864
02:05:55,297 --> 02:05:58,883
Oh, take a chance,
let your body get a tolerance

1865
02:05:58,968 --> 02:06:01,844
I'm not a chance,
but a heat wave in your pants

1866
02:06:01,929 --> 02:06:04,472
Pull a breath like another cigarette

1867
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:07,058
Palms up, I'm trading 'em

1868
02:06:07,851 --> 02:06:09,686
Trading 'em

1869
02:06:09,770 --> 02:06:12,897
I'm the oracle in my chest

1870
02:06:13,274 --> 02:06:16,150
Let the guitar scream like a fascist

1871
02:06:16,235 --> 02:06:17,902
Sweat it out, shut your mouth

1872
02:06:17,987 --> 02:06:19,779
Free love on the streets

1873
02:06:19,863 --> 02:06:23,908
But in the alley and I ain't that cheap, now

1874
02:06:23,993 --> 02:06:26,953
I don't care what you think

1875

No, I don't

1888
02:07:32,102 --> 02:07:35,480
I don't care, I don't care

1889

1898
02:09:02,609 --> 02:09:06,112
Hi. l'm Amanda Crew, professional actor.

1899
02:09:06,196 --> 02:09:08,531
You know in all the teen unrated DVDs,

1900
02:09:08,615 --> 02:09:12,160
you never really get to see
the star's naughty parts.

1901
02:09:12,661 --> 02:09:16,080
Well, that is gonna change today.

1902
02:09:16,165 --> 02:09:18,040
That's right. Take a seat,

1903
02:09:18,125 --> 02:09:20,918
maybe close the door
so mom doesn't come in.

1904
02:09:21,003 --> 02:09:23,921
Get all ready. Looks good.

1905
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:26,674
Here we go.

1906
02:09:30,387 --> 02:09:31,888
Suckers!

1907
02:09:33,515 --> 02:09:34,849
This is serious matter.

1908
02:09:35,934 --> 02:09:37,101
Run for your life.

1909
02:09:37,186 --> 02:09:39,771
MAN 1 : Oh, shit! You know what?
We see the fake balls on the table there.

1910
02:09:39,855 --> 02:09:40,855
