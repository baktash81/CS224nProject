1
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,514
Choo-choo
Choo-choo-doo-doo.

2
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,922
Choo-choo.

3
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,895
Choo-choo-doo-doo

4
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,735
Huh?
- Morning!

5
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,637
Little Engine!
Up early again?

6
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,668
Just getting a jump on the day.

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,370
You wake up
and you just can't wait.

8
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,145
To see how far you'll get today.

9
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,240
You're ready
and you're steady, yeah.

10
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,182
As strong as you can be.

11
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,678
You'll get the part
You'll set the pace.

12
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,780
You'll be the star
You'll win the race.

13
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,656
'Cause life is just a thousand
shining possibilities

14
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,154
And every day
you'll start to see

15
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,465
EW! EW! EW!

16
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:37,164
Little me, big dreams

17
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,577
I can be whoever I believe.

18
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,841
It's not the place
that you start.

19
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,406
But where you reach
with your heart.

20
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,612
That changes everything.

21
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:53,321
Little me, big dreams.

22
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,259
Little me, big dreams.

23
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,728
Where's the caboose?

24
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,622
All right,
all right, all right.

25
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,362
We've got a schedule to keep.

26
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,836
No lagging,
dragging or sagging.

27
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,668
And smile!

28
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:12,073
We are delivering dreams,
not nightmares, people.

29
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,442
Every day's another page

30
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,479
You write the story
your own way.

31
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,039
You take a chance and try

32
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,246
You might not have
the biggest part.

33
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,881
But it's a job and it's a start.

34
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:31,224
And there's no stopping
when you open up your mind.

35
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,631
Engine 35, you are now
cleared for departure.

36
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,689
But I don't have my caboose.

37
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,494
Lime Engine?

38
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,367
I'm on it, boss!

39
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,682
Hey,
you coming with us?

40
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,151
To the Real World?

41
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,189
Oh, I'd give anything to see
a child get their wish.

42
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,053
Maybe someday.

43
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,390
Little Engine!

44
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,450
Uh, I gotta go.

45
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,087
Take it easy, kid.

46
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,563
Have a good trip!

47
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,069
Big Locomotive, you're next.

48
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,973
You'll be delivering wishes
and dreams on track 19.

49
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,911
Well, sure. As soon
as I get my boxcars.

50
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,910
We need that hunter!

51
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,742
You never
win by thinking small.

52
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:34,189
Today's the day
you might just have it all.

53
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,888
Little me, big dreams

54
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,626
I can be whoever I believe

55
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,862
It's not the place
that you start.

56
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,336
But where you reach
with your heart.

57
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,566
That changes everything.

58
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,375
Little me, big dreams.

59
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:58,507
Little me, big dreams

60
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:04,086
Little Engine, how
many times do I have to tell you?

61
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,482
You're only supposed
to pull one at a time.

62
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,855
You're little.

63
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,385
You can't pull what
a Dream Hauler can pull!

64
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,093
Uh, I'll take it from here,
Little Engine.

65
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:19,660
Sorry. Let's just pretend
this never happened.

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,468
And that's why they
call it a Choo-Choo!

67
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,877
Oh, Rusty, you're too funny.

68
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,183
Hey, Little Engine.
Perfect timing.

69
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,879
Say, can you move Freight
Train's cars over here?

70
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,943
Happy to.

71
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,786
I've just had
back-to-back runs.

72
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,486
Rusty has offered
to deliver my load.

73
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,290
These kids and their
dreams have me beat.

74
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,294
Thanks again, Rusty!

75
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,702
So, uh, kid, I saw you earlier.

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,435
You almost got Big Locomotive's
whole load to the depot.

77
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,042
Don't remind me.

78
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,306
It's the last time
I try something like that.

79
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,510
Hey, hey!

80
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,710
You'll never be a Dream Hauler
with an attitude like that!

81
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,749
Come on.

82
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,153
Everybody knows
I'm just a hunter.

83
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,488
I move boxcars around the yard.

84
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,892
Shunters don't haul dreams.

85
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,896
Says who?

86
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,559
Now tell me you don't think about
pulling a load yourself someday.

87
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,298
Okay, maybe I do.
A little.

88
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,400
But that doesn't change anything.
I'm just too small.

89
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,972
Girl, listen to me now.
If you think you can,

90
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,577
you will.

91
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,116
If you think you can't,
you won't.

92
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,416
Either way, you're right.

93
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,614
You really believe that?

94
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,419
I know it.
See you, kid!

95
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,132
Watch your torque
on those turns!

96
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,631
Next stop,
the Real World.

97
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,107
The Real World.
The Real World.

98
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,351
See? It runs now.

99
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,690
My dad couldn't
believe I fixed it.

100
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,623
Wow, Richard.
Is it real silver?

101
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,962
Yeah. My grandpa worked for
the railroad his whole life.

102
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,795
Well, you've got your
presentation nailed.

103
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,838
I got stuck bringing
my grandpa's dentures.

104
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,533
EW, Marcus,
that's gross.

105
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,939
I know.

106
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,001
And if I don't get them home
by noon, it's soup for lunch.

107
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,377
Danger!
Two o'clock! Let's go!

108
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,581
Whoa!

109
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,795
Hey, Stretch, check it out.
Richie-Boy just gave me this.

110
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,195
I did not!

111
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,301
Sure you did. See?

112
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,770
Give me that!
It's not...

113
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,140
You can't take it!
That's my grandpa's watch!

114
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,504
You... You better...

115
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,748
Give me... Give you what?
A punch?

116
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,316
No! I...

117
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,547
You run home and tell
your daddy about this,

118
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:28,683
your face meets my fist every day after
school for the rest of your life.

119
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:42,831
Man, Marcus. When my dad finds out I lost
the watch, he is not gonna be happy.

120
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,842
But you didn't lose
the watch. Scott has it.

121
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,174
Yeah, like I'm ever
getting it back.

122
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,406
Well, you gotta try.

123
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,340
I mean, the watch is
important to you.

124
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,273
Maybe it's time
you stand up to him.

125
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,511
Are you crazy?

126
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,914
He's big, he's strong,
and he likes to inflict pain.

127
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,384
Hmm. You could
sneak into his locker!

128
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,355
Or... Ooh!
Take karate!

129
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,626
Forget it, Marcus.
I don't need any of your dumb suggestions.

130
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,532
Fine! Well, then,
you figure it out.

131
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,689
Richard,
is that you?

132
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,681
What am I gonna do?

133
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,146
What?

134
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,085
Train tracks?

135
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,993
That's weird.

136
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,324
There is no train in the park.

137
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,434
Okay.
There is a train in the park.

138
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,832
Huh?

139
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,133
Oh, boy, taking a nap on the job.
What was I thinking?

140
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,803
Maybe I shouldn't
have taken that extra load.

141
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,844
Hey! Hey!

142
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,725
Whoa! Oh!

143
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,427
Where are we going?

144
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,905
Stop this thing!

145
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,223
Huh? What's going on?

146
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:17,718
Oh, no.
I better tell the Tower!

147
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,398
Repair team to the station.

148
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,738
Shunters, where are you?
Clear the tracks!

149
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:42,905
Emergency crews, report in.
Dream Land is going crazy!

150
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,612
Apologies, peanut roaster.
Is your buggy sore?

151
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,716
Uh, just a tap.
What's going on?

152
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,882
Besides the general pandemonium
and ominous state of affairs?

153
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:54,947
Not a clue.

154
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,393
The tunnel! It's gone!
Caved in! Collapsed!

155
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,328
What?

156
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,387
Not possible.

157
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,565
The sun comes up,
the sun goes down,

158
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,101
and the tunnel's always open.

159
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,268
Well, it's a pile
of rubble now!

160
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,303
But how could
that happen, Rusty?

161
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,807
I mean, just like that?
Out of the blue?

162
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,208
All right, everybody!
Just settle down.

163
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,440
First thing we gotta do is figure
out why the tunnel collapsed.

164
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,573
Whoa!

165
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,049
Rusty, did you see anything
or hear anything unusual?

166
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:25,920
No. I was just going through
and it started collapsing!

167
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,889
That
doesn't make any sense.

168
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,255
There's got to be
an explanation!

169
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,092
I don't know!

170
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,323
Hello

171
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,434
What the heck?

172
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,337
Oh, it's just a boy.

173
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,604
A boy?

174
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,180
You're
a talking train?

175
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,483
Um, yeah.

176
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,854
What's... What's...
Where... What's...

177
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,748
Whoa!

178
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,929
What is this place?

179
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:10,056
A real boy?
In Dream Land?

180
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,531
Here's the problem!

181
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,198
You've caused bedlam
around here.

182
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,105
You're from the Real World.

183
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:22,544
You ripped a hole in the
dream-reality continuum!

184
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,014
What, me? But I just... I was...

185
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,974
There was all this
snow and wind,

186
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,381
and then this train.
I just climbed in and...

187
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,889
Huh? Train? What train?

188
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,552
It's my fault.

189
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,619
Rusty?

190
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,763
Rusty! You?

191
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,793
Well, see, I...
I guess...

192
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,895
I must have closed my eyes
for a second or two.

193
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,467
How could you let this happen?

194
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,474
What were you thinking?
A real boy in our world?

195
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,305
What a train wreck!

196
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,782
Excuse me.
Where exactly am...

197
00:13:58,971 --> 00:13:59,972
Wow!

198
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,813
I've never seen
a real boy before.

199
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,145
Shine your light on him,
Freight Train.

200
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,589
EW! He's all soft
and fleshy.

201
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,152
Yeah, kind of
creepy-looking.

202
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,391
All right, enough!
We all know what this means.

203
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,029
Dream Land won't recover
unless the boy goes back.

204
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,596
Yes! The boy
must go back!

205
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,742
We're going to have
to dig out the tunnel!

206
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,813
But that could take
months! Or years!

207
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,971
Well, we need to get
to work on it now!

208
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:36,110
Freight Train, Big Locomotive, Shiny
Passenger Train, you're the first shift. Go.

209
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,620
It's always the pretty ones
that get picked.

210
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,677
And you...

211
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,486
Suddenly not so fun
to be popular, is it?

212
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,118
Oh, Tower, you know what?
I think I have something here.

213
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,159
Back when there wasn't
any tunnel,

214
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,995
Dream Haulers went over the
mountain to the Real World.

215
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,831
Whoa!
Over the mountain?

216
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,333
That's just
an old smoke story.

217
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,804
But it's true! And what if the
old tracks are still there?

218
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,205
We don't have time
for a wild goose chase.

219
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,213
We got a big job ahead of us.

220
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,573
Not you, Rusty.

221
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,743
What do you mean?

222
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,051
Listen, you fell asleep
on the job.

223
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,249
I don't
have any other choice.

224
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,814
I gotta demote you.

225
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,757
You're a track cleaner now.

226
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,925
Somebody bring him a broom.

227
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,394
Track cleaner? But Rusty's
a Dream Hauler!

228
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,198
No, she's right, kid.
I messed up.

229
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,865
This is the price
I have to pay.

230
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,666
So sorry, Rusty.

231
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,217
You can't do this to Rusty!

232
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,916
You have to give him
another chance!

233
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,787
He made one little mistake!

234
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,855
Look around.

235
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,829
I'd say it was more
than a little mistake.

236
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,166
Um, ma'am?

237
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,398
If he's not taking me back,

238
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,498
then what's going
to happen to me?

239
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,240
Hang on. We're working
on getting you back home.

240
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,291
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

241
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,443
Hey, Rusty!

242
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,213
What were you saying
about those old tracks?

243
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,616
Well,
nobody remembers now,

244
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,451
but long ago, in the beginning,

245
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:56,057
the trains went over the
mountain, not through it.

246
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,790
It was grueling and dangerous.

247
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,061
Sad to say, some trains
never made it back.

248
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,226
It was clear, the trains
needed a safer way

249
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,569
to deliver wishes and
dreams to the Real World.

250
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,576
So, they decided to try
and go through the mountain.

251
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,940
It wasn't easy,

252
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,811
but after years of hard work,

253
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,612
the trains finally
dug out the tunnel.

254
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,854
But before the tunnel,
there was another way?

255
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,825
Yep. And I'm guessing those
old tracks still exist.

256
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,020
They used to say the turnoff's

257
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,529
just a little north
of the tunnel.

258
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,764
So somebody could take the real
boy back over the mountain!

259
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,567
That's what I was trying
to tell the Tower.

260
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,698
Don't worry, Rusty.

261
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,901
I'll make the Tower understand.

262
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,270
All right, listen up now.
We're on a new schedule.

263
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,904
Every Dream Hauler will
take one shift a day,

264
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,716
and then I will...

265
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,876
Um... Pardon me.

266
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,512
What? Not now.

267
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,053
But Rusty says
that someone can...

268
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,488
Can't you see I'm busy?

269
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,787
The first shift is on
their way to the tunnel.

270
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,862
We'll start the second
shift exactly at sunset.

271
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,022
We need to have...

272
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,588
But, ma'am!
Please, I'm trying...

273
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,932
Enough!
Dream Land is a mess!

274
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,767
I do not have time for you!

275
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,172
Now, where was I? Second shift, get
ready to head out as soon as...

276
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,868
What if I can fix Dream Land?

277
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,208
Then can Rusty
have his job back?

278
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,371
Sure!

279
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,144
You fix Dream Land, and not only
will I give Rusty his job back,

280
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,216
I will throw him a ticker
tape parade as well.

281
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,581
Now, if I could just finish
without any more interruptions...

282
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,529
Come on, Real Boy.
I know how to get you home.

283
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,298
Wow! Really? Awesome!

284
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,308
Are you sure that Tower
said this was okay?

285
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,406
Absolutely. She gave me
the green light.

286
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,565
So, what's the plan?

287
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,507
Those Dream Haulers won't be
happy digging out the tunnel.

288
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,171
So, we'll just zip over there and
tell them about the old tracks.

289
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,807
You watch. They'll jump at the chance
to haul you over Dream Mountain.

290
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,615
Wait a minute.

291
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:41,249
Dream Mountain. Dream Haulers.
Now I get it!

292
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:42,953
Get what?

293
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,688
This is a dream!

294
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,287
I'm at home in my bed,
sleeping!

295
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,021
Badly.

296
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,593
No, you're not.
You're here.

297
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,963
And look!

298
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:03,213
Everything Rusty said
is true! It's so... So...

299
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,476
Girly! Rainbows
and flowers and...

300
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,487
Where are the superheroes
and monsters?

301
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,854
This isn't a dream.
It's a nightmare!

302
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,596
You're not dreaming.
I told you, this is Dream Land.

303
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,930
Where do you think
dreams come from?

304
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:28,770
Well, if this isn't a dream,
then how could I do this?

305
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,508
Uh, you really
shouldn't be doing that.

306
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,706
Awesome!

307
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,940
Oh, this must be a chase dream!

308
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,005
A what?

309
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,546
Yeah! Look!

310
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,044
The
Evening Express?

311
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,716
He's way off schedule!

312
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,223
Coming through!

313
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,622
All right!
This is when we fly!

314
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,158
I can't fly!

315
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,827
Well, maybe you can't.
But I can!

316
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,465
No! Don't!

317
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,199
I'am flying!

318
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,105
Ah! I'm falling.

319
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,704
Aren't you kind of far
from home, Real Boy?

320
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,884
Ouch!

321
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,917
That actually hurt.

322
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,920
If I'm feeling pain,
then that means

323
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,028
I'm not dreaming!

324
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:32,061
Okay. No pressure,
but you might wanna go faster.

325
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,262
I'm trying!

326
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,501
Oh, and I've
got some bad news.

327
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,370
You are not going
to outrun him.

328
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,804
I think I can!

329
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,844
I think you can't!

330
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,611
Hang on, Little Engine!
I can't stop!

331
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,779
Sorry!

332
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,131
Uh, remember how
you wanted to fly?

333
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,160
Well, buckle up, Real Boy!

334
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,809
Wow! Wasn't that exciting?

335
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,812
No, that was insane!

336
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,755
But I flew off the tracks!

337
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,715
Yeah. I know.
I was there.

338
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,995
I was the one screaming,
remember?

339
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,464
So, I'm not dreaming.

340
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,025
That's right.

341
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,670
And I'm in some
sort of Dream Land.

342
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,008
That's also right.

343
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,738
I wish Rusty
could've seen me.

344
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,672
You gotta admit,

345
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,717
I'm doing pretty well for my first
time out of the train yard.

346
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,077
Your first time?

347
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,678
Great! I'm never
gonna make it!

348
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,022
Don't be silly.

349
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,491
It's a straight shot
to Dream Mountain.

350
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,788
Nothing will go wrong.

351
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,230
What's wrong?
Nothing.

352
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,734
Just a little loose
here or there.

353
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,231
Whoops!

354
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,931
A little?

355
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,635
We'd better deal with this
or we aren't going anywhere.

356
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,444
Almost got it.

357
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,710
That feels tight, Real Boy.

358
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,352
There!
And by the way, my name is Richard.

359
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:38,020
Richard, huh? Funny.
You don't look like a Richard.

360
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,862
Then what do I look like?

361
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:41,887
A real boy.

362
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,063
Better?

363
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:51,199
Much better. Thank you.
Where'd you learn that?

364
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:55,138
I'm into building models.
You know, airplanes, cars.

365
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,843
And somehow, there's always
one of these left over.

366
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,845
Keep it. Now, let's roll.

367
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,133
Whoa!

368
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,676
This must be Mushroom Forest.

369
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,177
It's just like Rusty described.

370
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,580
What are you doing?

371
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,342
Getting a better look.

372
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,441
Careful!

373
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:42,747
Whoa!

374
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,826
Hey, look at that one.

375
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,235
Ooh!

376
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,069
Stop, stop!
I wanna get a closer look.

377
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,106
Awesome!

378
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,181
They'll never believe
this back home.

379
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,326
Yoo-hoo!
Hello! Hello! Stop!

380
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,536
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

381
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,477
Sorry.
Is everyone all right?

382
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,778
Well, let's hope so!

383
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,716
Okay, okay, nobody panic!

384
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,947
Follow the sound of my nose.

385
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,752
Major reporting, Sir!

386
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,188
At ease, Major.

387
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,699
And for the record,
I'm not a sir. I'm a ma'am.

388
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,697
Yes, of course, Sir...
Ma'am... Sir!

389
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,399
Ace! There you are.
You okay?

390
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,645
Oh!
Jillian, is that you?

391
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,949
Pardon me.
My caboose is showing.

392
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,850
Lou? Bud?

393
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:24,325
Whoa, Bud! Check it out!
The world's tipped over!

394
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,557
Everything's sideways!

395
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,629
Hey, thanks, bro.

396
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,036
Head bump!

397
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,233
Where's Hudson?
Has anyone seen Hudson?

398
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,909
Hudson! Hudson!

399
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,949
You don't have to shout,
Beverly. I'm right here.

400
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,540
Oh, Hudson!

401
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,579
Okay. Trains
and toys talk?

402
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,916
In Dream Land they do.

403
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,554
Hey!

404
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,824
You're the real boy!

405
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,224
We heard about you

406
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,787
from a couple of trains on their
way to dig out the tunnel.

407
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,260
No doubt he's the reason
for our sudden derailment.

408
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,264
Derailment? Your train
came off the tracks?

409
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,871
I'm afraid so. The switcher started going
crazy and he ran off into the ditch.

410
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,838
Maybe we can help.

411
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,574
Oh, no! Oh, no!

412
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,641
Oh, no!

413
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,813
Can you cut it out already?
You're rattling my windows!

414
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:29,884
I can't help it.
I'm ticklish.

415
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,656
Sorry. I can't fix it.

416
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,859
This can't be happening.

417
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,464
Stranded miles from
the Real World! Oh!

418
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,605
Mission unaccomplished, Sir.

419
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,865
Well, we'll have to
think of something.

420
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,501
If we don't make it
to the Real World soon...

421
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,570
I can take you to Dream Mountain,
where the big engines are.

422
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,638
Really? That would be great!

423
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,680
Oh, sure! Go ahead!
Leave me behind!

424
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,913
Everybody else does.

425
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,824
You can come, too.

426
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,918
Have you popped your rivets?
You're too little.

427
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:08,021
She won't last five minutes out
there with a load to haul.

428
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:12,000
Hold on. We're on the brink of disaster.
Not really in the position to quibble!

429
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,199
Are you nuts?
You barely made it this far.

430
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,001
And now you wanna
haul all this?

431
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,167
What if another
express comes by?

432
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,402
Not likely.

433
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:24,003
Abra-ka-dizzle and shizza-ti-sham.
Don't look around...

434
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,106
But we don't even
know these toys!

435
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,447
I mean, what about that clown?

436
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,076
What is she hiding
behind her back?

437
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,879
Ta-da!

438
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,219
Now you're being silly again.

439
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,923
Well, it just seems
kind of risky.

440
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,691
Some things are worth the risk.

441
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,236
Hey, Richard!
How do I look?

442
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,138
Uh, you look like a train?

443
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,904
But I feel different.
I'm hauling toys!

444
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,879
Hey, go see
if they need anything.

445
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,721
I say there, Richard,

446
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,019
could I have a moment
of your time?

447
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,061
Sure. I'm not
going anywhere.

448
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,592
Am I fun?

449
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:20,836
Entertaining? Lovable?
What will my child think of me?

450
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,665
Come on, Hudson.
Don't ask me.

451
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,902
But you're a child,
so you must know,

452
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,206
and I want to know so badly.

453
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,641
Really, I mean, what do you think?
Really? Really?

454
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,245
Well, honestly,

455
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,215
I think you're
kind of annoying.

456
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,320
What? Oh, no,
no, no, no! No!

457
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:44,885
What's going on?

458
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,724
Hudson asked me
what I thought of him.

459
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,500
And I'm annoying, apparently.

460
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,897
Kid's got a point, dude.

461
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,531
Look, you're a stuffed animal.

462
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,007
I'm sure your kid
will like you.

463
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,738
Well, how can you be so sure?
I mean, I am annoying!

464
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,544
Because I had one.

465
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,877
Until my dog
ripped his head off.

466
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,551
Huh! Gnarly.

467
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,247
It's okay, though.
My mom sewed his head back on.

468
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,318
All hail the great Mum!

469
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:19,089
The Real World
sounds kind of scary.

470
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,962
It is.

471
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,059
There are bullies who take your
stuff and don't give it back.

472
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,661
Then you can't go home because
you're afraid to tell your dad.

473
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,138
And then you end up
in Dream Land.

474
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,670
You mean we're stranded because
you couldn't face some bullies?

475
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,781
I'd better go see
what's going on.

476
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,286
You okay?

477
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,725
Look! We're almost there!

478
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,995
All right. Back in.
Let's roll.

479
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,001
Are we there yet?

480
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,004
Guys?

481
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,606
Anyone?

482
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,141
Hello!

483
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,541
Way to haul, kiddo.

484
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,102
Yeah. Nice work,
Little Engine.

485
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,203
Thank you!

486
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,781
I said, "Honk, honk!"
And then...

487
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:47,976
Now, you guys stay here.

488
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,509
I'll be right back with a big engine
who will haul you over the mountain.

489
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,389
And there
she was, right in front of me.

490
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,289
Sol rolled up to her
and said, "Honk!"

491
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,253
And then she said,
"Honk, honk!"

492
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,024
And then I said,
"Honk, honk!"

493
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,962
And then she said,
"Honk, honk."

494
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,363
And then I went,
"Oh, no, you honk, honk!"

495
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:13,133
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

496
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,735
Excuse me.

497
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,481
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing here?

498
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,148
You look a little lost, peanut roaster.
Train yard's that way.

499
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,149
Oh, I'm not lost.

500
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,519
I brought the real boy so you
can take him over the mountain.

501
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,922
Then you won't have to dig anymore
because Dream Land will be fixed

502
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,052
and Rusty can be
a Dream Hauler again!

503
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,756
I am so confused.

504
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,226
Rusty told me
about the old tracks.

505
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,901
The old tracks?

506
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,595
Yeah, you know, the ones
that go over the mountain.

507
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,368
Huh? Hmm? Hmm?

508
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,109
Did she say over the...

509
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,184
They're laughing.
You think that's a good thing?

510
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,454
Hmm. I'm a clown.
Laughing always sounds good to me.

511
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,188
Look, those old tracks are a myth.
They don't exist.

512
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,652
But Rusty said...

513
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,628
Oh, please.
He's totally desperate.

514
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,892
He'll try anything
to get his job back.

515
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,402
Now, you better take the real
boy back to the train yard.

516
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,134
Where
he's supposed to be.

517
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,100
We got work to do here.

518
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,079
But, what about those trains?

519
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,741
Don't even think
about asking them.

520
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,842
They've got to dig, and we've
gotta rest for the next shift.

521
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,445
So, go on now.
Move your caboose.

522
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,158
Well?

523
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,199
They don't believe
the tracks exist.

524
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,162
So, they're not going to
take us over the mountain?

525
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:57,073
It's okay. We'll just wait here until
we find a big engine who believes us.

526
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,540
You'll get to your kids.
It'll just take a little time.

527
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,013
You don't understand.

528
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,682
The children have already wished
for us, and now we're late.

529
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:11,789
And that's one step away
from being forgotten.

530
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:17,125
You see, for us, once we're
forgotten, we disappear.

531
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,196
Well, what about you, Little Engine?
Could you take us?

532
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,442
Oh. I don't know.

533
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:35,245
But don't worry.
You'll find someone bigger, stronger.

534
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,616
A real Dream Hauler.

535
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,986
We don't have time, Little Engine.
There's nobody else.

536
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:52,030
Listen, I was wrong about you.
Look how far you've come.

537
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,503
You can handle
that old mountain!

538
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,278
I...

539
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,616
I think I can.

540
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,917
Now, let's go find
those old tracks.

541
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:24,622
888, 889, 890, 891...

542
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,262
Nine, eight, seven, six...
...892, 893,

543
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:32,331
894, 895...
...five, four, three, two...

544
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,405
Oh, uh, sorry.

545
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,848
899, 900.

546
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,085
Rusty said there should be some old switch
rails here so we can change tracks.

547
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,418
I say! I think
I see something!

548
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,929
Where? I don't
see anything.

549
00:35:55,386 --> 00:36:00,233
Epic news!
We see something, straight ahead.

550
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,833
It's a beautiful kind of day.

551
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,434
When you're suddenly
on your way.

552
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:14,848
Somewhere that you
only dreamed was true.

553
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,879
It's a magical kind of sight.

554
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:24,325
When the thing you want most
is right before your eyes.

555
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:28,922
And it's yours to find.

556
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,456
So pick up your feet
and let's get going.

557
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:38,474
You've got the steam
to just keep rolling on.

558
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,169
And on.

559
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,645
Here we go, in that glow.

560
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,945
Feel that feeling taking over.

561
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:54,320
When you know it's your
time and it's your chance.

562
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,552
And you're finally on your way.

563
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,960
Watching the whole world
start to change.

564
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:05,433
In that moment when you say

565
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:08,834
I think I can.

566
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,945
There's a smile
that's on your face.

567
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,348
When you finally find that
place you're meant to be.

568
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,012
Where your heart's so free.

569
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:29,158
And you know that
you won't slow down.

570
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:34,561
When there's so many
sweet surprises to be found.

571
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,863
Makes you laugh out loud.

572
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,702
So pull up the brake
and let's keep riding.

573
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,574
Pick up the pace
and just keep climbing on.

574
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,273
And on.

575
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:54,748
Here we go, in that glow.

576
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:58,116
Feel that feeling taking over.

577
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:04,387
When you know it's your
time and it's your chance.

578
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,725
And you're finally on your way.

579
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,891
Watching the whole world
start to change.

580
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:15,301
In that moment when you say

581
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,000
I think I can

582
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,067
I think I can

583
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,770
I think I can

584
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:45,533
Uh, it looks sturdy enough.
Don't you think?

585
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,895
Sure, if by "sturdy" you mean
"rickety, old and falling apart."

586
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,031
Well, we really don't
have much choice.

587
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,405
There's no other way across.

588
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,736
I'll be careful.

589
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,414
Yeah, very careful.

590
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:11,723
I got a bad
feeling about this.

591
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,800
You're doing great.
Just keep it up.

592
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,716
That can't be good!

593
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,754
Whoa:

594
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,763
Richard! Hang on!

595
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,429
Hold tight, kiddo!

596
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,627
Dude, don't look down!

597
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,168
I said "don't"!
Don't look down!

598
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,943
Hold on, Richard!
I'll pull you up.

599
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,364
Whoa, that was close!

600
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,324
Thanks.

601
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,799
Please don't do that again.

602
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,338
It's a deal.

603
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,105
So, now what?

604
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:40,147
I mean, we can't get across.

605
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,345
Well, um...

606
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,047
There's the answer!

607
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,494
What? That
broken-down pole?

608
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:57,830
It's a yardarm for cargo.
Somebody could tiptoe across the track,

609
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,927
yank out the yardarm from its base,
lay it across the broken track,

610
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,165
and we'll use it
as a makeshift rail!

611
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,766
Who's crazy
enough to do that?

612
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,320
No clowning around
out there, Bev!

613
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,590
Kind of goes with the outfit.

614
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,555
Be careful!

615
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,960
Ooh, I can't look.

616
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:35,569
Uh, Sir?
The mission, Sir?

617
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,261
Om Right.

618
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,134
Look at me go!
Look at me go! Aha!

619
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:44,940
Ta-da!

620
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,887
Hey, we're in luck!
It's loose!

621
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,363
I'll just... Whoo!

622
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,394
Whoa!

623
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:11,800
Help!

624
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,500
Oh, no, Bev!
Help!

625
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,075
Someone's got to help her!

626
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,246
Well, maybe I should go. Whoa!

627
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,342
Yes! Yes! Good idea!

628
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,473
Really?

629
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,608
Help!

630
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:22,912
Yeah! You can do it!

631
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,916
BEV; om

632
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,080
I'm a little
in trouble!

633
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,157
Don't be nervous.
One step at a time.

634
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:41,426
Rusty says, "if
you think you can, you will."

635
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,302
That's it!

636
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,277
There you go.
You're doing it!

637
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,049
Come on, Richard.
You're almost there.

638
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,530
You made it!

639
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,297
Whoa! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Gotcha!

640
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,506
Way to go, Richard!
I knew you could do it!

641
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,214
My hero.

642
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:42,889
Mission accomplished!

643
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,828
Do you think it will hold?

644
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,697
We're about to find out.

645
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,213
Please, please, please,
please, please, please...

646
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,194
Way to haul, Little Engine!

647
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,701
One catastrophe down.
Hopefully no more to go.

648
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,796
Yeah, well...

649
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,736
Let's go.

650
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,988
Oh, dude. This place is making
my neck hairs stand up.

651
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,290
A soldier fears nothing, Sir.

652
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:28,159
But if he did,
this might be it, Sir.

653
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,127
You doing all right?

654
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,901
L just...

655
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,734
I'm kind of...

656
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,039
That can't be good.

657
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,977
Lost power.
Hit the emergency brake.

658
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,146
How about the lever?

659
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,421
It looks brake-y.

660
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,119
Not the brake-y one.

661
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,063
Try the knob.
The knob!

662
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,090
The other knob!

663
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,440
This is all wrong.
I like the view better from behind!

664
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,102
Au right!

665
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,574
The big red one!

666
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,049
Oh! The red one!
Why didn't you just say so?

667
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,949
Brakes, brakes,
brakes, brakes! More brakes!

668
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,829
Who
turned out the lights?

669
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,636
Times like this make me
want a lifetime warranty.

670
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,499
Tell me about it.

671
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,911
Bad news.

672
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,783
There's a hole
in your water tank.

673
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:30,747
Oh, no!

674
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,691
No wonder I overheated.

675
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,395
With a leak,
I'm not going anywhere.

676
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,729
Lost?

677
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,601
Where'd you come from?

678
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,267
Just what I was
going to ask you.

679
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:52,373
Isn't that a real boy?

680
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,910
Yes. And I have to get him
over the mountain.

681
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:59,413
But I'm stuck.

682
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,788
Why didn't you just
use the tunnel?

683
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,955
It kind of collapsed.

684
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,557
'Cause of me.

685
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,232
I see.

686
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,458
Of course it did.

687
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,993
What a shame.

688
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,699
But over the mountain?

689
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,763
It's difficult for me!

690
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,901
No wonder you didn't make it.

691
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,209
I... I thought I could.

692
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,475
And look where it got you.

693
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,113
Broken down.

694
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,113
Stranded.

695
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,049
Helpless.

696
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,260
But, not to worry.
Allow me to take them.

697
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,962
I'm about to take a run
over the mountain anyway.

698
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,195
To the Real World?

699
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,528
I do it all the time.
It's no trouble.

700
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,336
Besides, I don't see
any other options. Do you?

701
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,778
I... I guess not.

702
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,877
Listen, everybody!
We're in luck!

703
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,749
You've got a new ride
over the mountain!

704
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,951
We can't just leave you.

705
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,788
Don't worry about me.
You need to get home, and...

706
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,753
And you need
to get to your kids.

707
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,401
All aboard!

708
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,838
But, how will you get back?

709
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,470
Once they realize I'm gone,

710
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,237
I'm sure they'll send
someone for me.

711
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:29,766
Go!

712
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,610
Well, but...

713
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,411
it's okay. Go!

714
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:22,919
Who are you?

715
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,664
I want my friends back!

716
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,433
But that's not going
to happen, is it?

717
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,778
I'm keeping them here with me.

718
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:40,813
As long as the real boy is in
Dream Land there's no tunnel,

719
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,375
and I'm the only train
who can deliver dreams.

720
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,450
My kind of dreams.

721
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,849
Scary, creepy dreams.

722
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,959
You're the Nightmare Train?

723
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:55,253
Aren't you the little genius.

724
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:56,893
Please let my friends go!

725
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:02,002
Not gonna happen!

726
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,937
Now these are wishes that
will never be delivered!

727
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:26,792
Sweet dreams!

728
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,304
Trapped?
Somebody do something!

729
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,802
The important thing
is not to panic.

730
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,567
Good. That's
a good plan.

731
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,467
And to think of a way out.

732
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,108
Right. Hmm...

733
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,648
Hmm.

734
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:52,246
Sir? We are
not alone, Sir.

735
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,915
Hey, Richie-Boy.

736
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,684
How come you're...

737
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,591
What are you doing here?

738
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,761
I'm here to introduce
your face to my fist!

739
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,930
I beg your pardon!
Is there a problem here?

740
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,795
You bet there's a problem,

741
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:10,927
chimp!

742
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,333
Chimp?
Oh, that's funny.

743
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,635
See, technically I am a monkey.

744
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,940
Sock monkey, to be precise.
Actually...

745
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,275
Put a sock in it.

746
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,115
Yes, sir.
Uh, not a problem.

747
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,448
Uh, luckily I'm nicely
equipped for such a request.

748
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:25,714
See?

749
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:30,356
Um... Uh...

750
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:31,619
Pie in the face.

751
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,388
Nothing in the world
that can't be solved

752
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,019
with a good pie in the face.

753
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,964
Bev, this is serious!
I'm in trouble here.

754
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,628
We're your worst nightmare.

755
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,501
Ace! Dude!

756
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,750
Oh! This is not good.
We're on the Nightmare Train,

757
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,615
stuck in the middle
of a nightmare.

758
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:02,213
It's a nightmare within a nightmare,
which in itself is a nightmare!

759
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,753
Nightmares.

760
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:06,923
You're not real!

761
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,758
You're nothing!
You're bogus!

762
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,960
Pretend! Fake!

763
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,463
You don't exist!

764
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,299
In fact...

765
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:17,627
Bev?

766
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:19,966
Ta-da!

767
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,699
Huh?

768
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,316
A commanding show
of bravery, Sir.

769
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,055
You're right. Pies do
make everything better.

771
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,482
I was such a fool to trust him.

772
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:16,753
Well, I don't know
about being a fool.

773
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,390
Naive, maybe.

774
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:20,830
Gullible, certainly.

775
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:22,598
Did I mention naive?

776
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,764
I'm just
a scrawny little hunter.

777
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,306
What made me think
I could go over the mountain?

778
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,711
I've ruined everything.

779
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,008
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

780
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,644
Whatever happened to Little Miss
"l think I can, I think I can,"

781
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,143
et cetera?

782
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:42,890
I guess she knows now.

783
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,921
She can't.

784
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,426
Ace?

785
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:55,526
How'd you get away?

786
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:56,997
Where's everybody else?

787
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,652
I can't make it.

788
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:28,734
You heard her. It's over.
We're done. Finished. Kaput.

789
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,105
I'm sorry. I can't.

790
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,682
If you think you can,

791
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,256
you will.

792
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,828
If you think you can't,
you won't.

793
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,518
Rusty?

794
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,129
Either way, you're right.

795
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,102
Maybe I can still do something!

796
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,269
Oh, but I'm out of water.

797
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,609
Uh, would a water tower help?

798
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,575
What? Where?

799
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:17,308
Water tower.
Right here.

800
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,816
Too bad it's out of reach.

801
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,690
You have an idea, Ace?

802
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,468
There you go. That's my girl.
Back it up!

803
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,851
Okay. We got tracks.
We got tracks!

804
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,116
We ain't got tracks.

805
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,990
How do you feel about flying?

806
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,698
Uh, why do you ask?

807
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,863
Whoo-hoo!

808
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,106
Way more fun the second time.

809
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,939
Second time?

810
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,513
Lead the way, Ace.

811
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,826
Whoa! Dude!

812
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:14,795
Whoa!
Look at that, Bud!

813
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:17,566
It worked!
The little guy was right!

814
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,598
We just needed
to use our heads.

815
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:38,591
This is it. He's slowing down.
I think I can unhook us.

816
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,959
Almost got if...

817
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:14,817
Oh!

818
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,363
Hey!

819
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,144
Uh, you know we only have two
chances of finding them.

820
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,781
Slim and none.

821
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:42,985
Richard!

822
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,719
Little Engine!
Thank goodness!

823
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,385
Oh, look at me.
Instantly wrong.

824
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,189
You got away!
Where are the toys?

825
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,061
They're still on
the Nightmare Train.

826
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,997
We can catch up
to them if we hurry.

827
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:16,950
There he is!

828
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,515
He's too far away.

829
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,003
A shortcut! I can
catch up to him!

830
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,131
Um, are you looking
at the same track I am?

831
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,903
Switch the track!
Hurry!

832
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,447
Hold tight!

833
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,522
Uh, we're not gonna
fly again, are we?

834
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,600
Little Engine?

835
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,938
Have you thought about what we're gonna
do when we catch the Nightmare Train?

836
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,739
Nope.
No idea.

837
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,208
Whoa!

838
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:23,880
Hang in there, Little E.

839
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,128
Almost there!

840
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:44,903
Uh, guys?
Hello! Anyone!

841
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,679
Where is he?
Can you see him?

842
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,382
No!

843
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,293
He must be up ahead!

844
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,830
Ace, fly ahead and see if you
can spot the Nightmare Train.

845
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,796
Hang on!

846
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:24,807
Ace?

847
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,446
Looking for me?

848
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,582
Did you really
think...

849
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,853
Is that the real boy?

850
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,893
But...
How did you...

851
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:40,027
I want the boy back!

852
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:44,498
Well, you can't have him.

853
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,464
Oh, grow up!

854
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:48,501
Wait, you can't.

855
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,508
Because you'll
always be little!

856
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:57,343
You're just a dinky
little engine who's failed!

857
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,548
I may belittle,

858
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,348
but I haven't failed.

859
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:04,823
And I have news for you.

860
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:08,590
I'm taking my friends
over this mountain,

861
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:13,361
and I'm not letting some creepy
old train stand in my way!

862
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:17,562
Done?

863
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:23,608
I say! That's
Little Engine!

864
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,344
She's coming for us!

865
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:27,972
We gotta bust out of here!

866
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:32,648
Let me lay it out for you.

867
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:37,214
I'm not letting the boy
anywhere near the Real World!

868
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,023
Catch my drift?

869
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,696
Huh?

870
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:50,470
Perhaps I could climb
through this hole.

871
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,040
I think I can
reach the latch!

872
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,576
You haven't the sense
to give up when you should!

873
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:04,143
So here's a lesson
for the future!

874
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:10,747
Oh, that's right.
You won't have one!

875
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,220
Richard! See the switcher?

876
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,155
Get ready.
Got you.

877
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,929
Where do you
think you're going?

878
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,169
Away from you, creepy!

879
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:30,137
What?

880
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,174
We're going the wrong way!

881
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,677
Richard!
Switch it now!

882
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,647
It's stuck!

883
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:51,324
No!

884
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,868
Let's never do that again!

885
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,004
Great job, Little E.

886
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,705
Not so bad yourself, Richard.

887
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,014
We're losing water fast.

888
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,859
Oh, no!

889
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,559
We've gotta fix this leak.

890
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,764
Oh, we must have something
that will fill that hole!

891
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,595
Oh, maybe we could
fold you up and...

892
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,266
That is not an option!

893
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,276
This should work, Sir.

894
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,103
Are you sure?

895
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:42,374
We must complete the mission.

896
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:47,482
Thank you, Major.

897
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:54,520
I think you look
better without it.

898
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,864
Oh, thank you, Ma'am.

899
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:03,028
Oh, please.
Call me Jillian.

900
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:07,731
Yes, of course, Jillian, ma'am.

901
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:09,198
There.

902
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:12,212
That feels better already!

903
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,280
All right, everyone.
All aboard!

904
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,315
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!

905
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,265
The patch is holding.
You're gonna be okay.

906
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,153
Come on, Little Engine.
Just remember what Rusty said.

907
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,714
If you think you can, you will.

908
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,025
I think I can.

909
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:03,161
I think I can.

910
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,897
What?

911
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:11,538
Little Engine, you're
starting to heat up.

912
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:14,499
I'm okay. I'm okay.

913
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,111
I think I can.

914
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,539
I think I can.

915
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,318
I think I can.

916
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:28,617
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
Hailstorm!

917
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,618
I think I can.
I think...

918
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,362
I think I can.

919
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,364
I...

920
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,300
You're overheating.

921
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,470
I have to keep going.

922
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:46,230
But your boiler could blow.

923
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:49,374
Dream Haulers never give up.

924
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:56,573
I...

925
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,730
Come on, Little Engine.
I believe in you.

926
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,306
I know I can.

927
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,408
I know I can.

928
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,076
I know I can.

929
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,350
I know I can.

930
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,447
I know I can.

931
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,380
I know I can.

932
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,986
I know I can.

933
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,057
I know I can.

934
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,458
I know I can.

935
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,023
I know I can.

936
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,695
I know I can.

937
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:45,464
I know I can.

938
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,463
I know I can!

939
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:50,660
I know...

940
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,640
I knew I could!

941
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:05,314
Way to go, Little E!
You're a real Dream Hauler.

942
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,084
I always said you could do it!

943
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,379
No, you didn't!

944
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,823
Oh, sure I did.
Just now.

945
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,789
Uh, Sir? What's that?

946
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:17,822
Ooh!

947
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,798
That must be
the way to the Real World!

948
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:20,856
Oh!

949
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,928
Wow!

950
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,667
Isn't it amazing, Hudson?

951
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,633
Uh, Hudson?

952
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,039
Uh, has anyone seen Hudson?

953
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,372
Hey, Hudson.

954
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,221
Dude! What's wrong?
We're gonna make it, buddy.

955
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,157
I'm still nervous.

956
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,215
After all, I am the annoying,

957
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,489
borderline irritating
sock monkey!

958
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:50,356
Oh, man.

959
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:54,393
Hudson.

960
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,002
You are neither annoying
nor irritating.

961
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:02,534
You are a unique sock monkey
dreamed up by a wonderful child,

962
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,339
who will love and cherish
you for years to come.

963
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,884
Did you hear that, everyone?
I'm not annoying!

964
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,422
I am unique!

965
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:17,985
You certainly
are, Hudson.

966
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:22,427
All right, everybody!
Next stop, the Real World!

967
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,964
I knew I could.
I knew I could.

968
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,977
I knew I could.
I knew I could...

969
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,204
I knew I could!

970
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,719
Did you see how happy those kids
were when we delivered their toys?

971
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:57,960
Yeah. Pretty cool.
I'm gonna miss them.

972
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:00,797
Hey. What about me?

973
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:02,860
You too.

974
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,576
It's like I never left.

975
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,139
It's exactly like
you never left.

976
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,847
Dream Time doesn't work
like Real Time.

977
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,684
You sure you don't want
me to take you home?

978
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,447
No. I've got something
to finish here.

979
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,090
Bye, Little Engine.

980
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:30,927
Dream of me sometime, Real Boy.

981
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:33,289
Count on it.

982
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,031
See you, kid.

983
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,152
Hungry?

984
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,663
I knew you guys
would still be here.

985
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,868
I came for my watch.

986
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:16,068
You think you can take it
from me, Richie-Boy?

987
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,852
Yeah, I think I can.

988
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,751
Not only that, I can stop
letting you push me around,

989
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,926
and I can tell my dad
you're a thief!

990
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,262
Now, give me back my watch!

991
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,528
Ow. Ow! Ow, ow!

992
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,502
Help! Ow! Ow!

993
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,972
Stretch!
Help... Help!

994
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,267
Ow! Stretch!
Help me out!

995
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:52,602
Ow! Ow!
Make it stop! Make it stop!

996
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:53,942
What button is it?
Help me out! Stretch!

997
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:55,207
Hey, how do I... Ow!

998
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,145
Stretch,
make it stop!

999
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,616
Oh!
Here you are!

1000
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,684
You two are supposed
to be in detention!

1001
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,014
Inside, right now.

1002
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,883
You're looking at trouble.
Big trouble.

1003
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,129
Richard!
Marcus?

1004
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:16,029
What are you doing here?

1005
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:18,296
I forgot my math book.

1006
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,407
Hey, you got your
watch back! How?

1007
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:23,576
It's kind of like you said.

1008
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,879
I thought I could, and I did.

1009
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:27,537
That's it?

1010
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,344
Anything else will make me
seem like a crazy person.

1011
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:33,712
We still friends?

1012
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,814
Come on! Of course!

1013
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:40,122
Great. Last one home's
a rotten egg!

1014
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,511
What's happening?

1015
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,915
Whoo-hoo!

1016
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:04,409
Is that...

1017
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:05,543
The squirt?

1018
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,850
Little
Engine, come back here!

1019
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,446
I'll see you at the station!

1020
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,615
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1021
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,062
Little Engine?
Where did you come from?

1022
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,200
I just got back
from the Real World!

1023
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:27,396
What?

1024
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:28,872
The tracks do exist!

1025
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,136
They sure do, Rusty.

1026
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,407
I just took the boy
back to the Real World

1027
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,471
on the old tracks
Rusty told me about!

1028
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:36,805
Huh?
Huh?

1029
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:39,244
It was no picnic,
let me tell you.

1030
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:42,322
Wait a minute!
You're saying

1031
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,286
you went over Dream Mountain?

1032
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,824
Nobody can do that.

1033
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,191
Not even me!

1034
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:55,095
Apparently, our
newest Dream Hauler just did.

1035
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,061
Not bad for a little squirt.

1036
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,172
Mighty impressive,
peanut roaster.

1037
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:00,364
Oh, you should've seen her!

1038
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,804
Wow!
Incredible!

1039
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:02,934
That's amazing!

1040
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,140
Rusty gets his job back, right?

1041
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,712
You promised!

1042
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,572
Well... Um...

1043
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:18,051
Yeah! It seems I owe Rusty
a ticker tape parade, too.

1044
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,260
Looks like you were right
all along, Rusty.

1045
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,255
And an apology
for not believing him.

1046
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:31,570
But I'm still puzzled.
You're just a little engine.

1047
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,197
And that's one tough mountain.

1048
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:36,240
How did you pull this off?

1049
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:38,376
It's simple, really.

1050
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,877
I thought I could.

1051
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:46,278
Well, well, well.
I guess that makes you.

1052
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:49,720
The Little Engine that Could!

1053
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,895
Way to go,
Little Engine!

1054
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:06,265
Way to go!

1055
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,103
Good job, guys!
Good job!

1056
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:18,328
