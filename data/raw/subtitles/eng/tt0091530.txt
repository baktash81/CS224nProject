1
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:09,957
Your Holiness, the little matter
that brought me here is now settled.

2
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:16,636
The lndians are once more free to be enslaved
by the Spanish and Portuguese settlers.

3
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:22,643
I don't think that's hitting
the right note. Begin again.

4
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:27,085
Your Holiness, l write to you
in this year of our Lord 1 758. . .

5
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:32,879
. . .from the southern continent of the
Americas, from the town of Asuncion. . .

6
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:37,086
. . .two weeks' march from
the great mission of San Miguel.

7
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:42,680
These missions have protected the lndians
from the depredations of the settlers...

8
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:45,884
...and have earned much resentment
because of it.

9
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:49,517
The noble souls of these lndians
incline towards music.

10
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:53,157
Indeed, many a violin played
in the academies of Rome...

11
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:57,002
...have been made
by their nimble and gifted hands.

12
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:05,244
It was from these missions the Jesuit
fathers carried the word of God...

13
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:08,683
... to those lndians still
existing in their natural state...

14
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:13,238
...and received in return...martyrdom.

15
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:43,286
The death of this priest
was to form the first link...

16
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:46,678
...in the chain of which
l now find myself a part.

17
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:50,635
Continue.
As Your Holiness undoubtedly knows. . .

18
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:54,959
. . .Iittle in this world
unfolds as we predict.

19
00:04:56,367 --> 00:05:01,157
How could the lndians have supposed
that the death of that unsung priest. . .

20
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:07,516
... would bring among them a man whose life
was to become intertwined with their own?

21
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,558
Thank you, Father.

22
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:26,566
It was our territory.
Julien's and mine.

23
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:32,279
I sent him, Father.
I have to go up there myself.

24
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,557
Can you see him?

25
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:52,605
No.

26
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:06,283
With an orchestra, the Jesuits could
have subdued the whole continent.

27
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:10,201
So it was that the Guarani
were brought finally to account...

28
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:13,439
... to the everlasting mercy of God...

29
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:16,440
...and to the short-lived
mercy of man.

30
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:26,601
Who are you?

31
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:37,041
So you're hunting above the falls now,
Captain Mendoza?

32
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:49,318
We're building a mission here.

33
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:53,560
-We'll make Christians of these people.
-If you have the time.

34
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:06,355
It's your brother.

35
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,600
-Alonzo, are they healthy?
-Excellent.

36
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,441
Good.

37
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,804
-Are there many above the falls?
-Yes.

38
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,083
-Dangerous?
-Yes.

39
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:42,444
-Not against powder and shot.
-No.

40
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,923
I've seen Jesuits there.

41
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:48,759
-Above the falls?
-Yes.

42
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,156
Damn them.

43
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:53,717
The mission is
to be called San Carlos.

44
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:04,602
-Don Cabeza.
-Mendoza.

45
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:12,683
Take them away.
Quickly. Quickly now.

46
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:33,402
-You should find yourself a good woman.
-I have.

47
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,876
If you had,
you wouldn't look so gloomy.

48
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:38,845
-Maybe you're right.
-About women, l'm always right.

49
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:41,726
-How could l forget?
-You forget everything.

50
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,321
-I do, do l?
-You do.

51
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,039
Good.

52
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:26,837
Hello.

53
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:30,319
-Good. Now take them off.
-Excellent.

54
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,997
You distract too easily.

55
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,637
On the day the senorita
can't distract my attention. . .

56
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,367
-. . .I'll become a monk.
-On that day, Felipe. . .

57
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:42,485
. . .half the ladies in this town
will become nuns.

58
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,123
Pure gossip.
Rodrigo is the lady's man.

59
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:49,400
Rodrigo here is this lady's man.

60
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:14,004
Felipe?

61
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,965
I love him, Rodrigo.

62
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,360
Since when have you loved Felipe?

63
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,360
Six months.

64
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,761
-Six--?
-I've been trying to tell you.

65
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:32,077
I have.

66
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:39,363
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
You have been trying to tell me.

67
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,886
So me you do not love?

68
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:54,196
Not as l love Felipe.

69
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:58,201
-Rodrigo, that's the love that l need.
-I see.

70
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:02,279
And so l have no need?

71
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:06,526
You need so much.

72
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:10,480
You deserve so much.

73
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:22,437
Rodrigo, you won't hurt him, will you?

74
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:33,521
No, l won't hurt him.

75
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:14,276
Rodrigo, please.

76
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,240
-You laughed.
-I did not laugh.

77
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,363
Most certainly you laughed.

78
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:33,246
-At whom are you laughing?
-Don't do this.

79
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:36,156
Quarrel with me!

80
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:08,042
Oh, no!

81
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:09,796
So how goes it at your mission
above the falls?

82
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:14,157
-Insects and twigs, Father.
-No converts?

83
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:15,806
A few.

84
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:21,246
-And many near to it, thank the Lord.
-Thank the Lord, indeed.

85
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:25,442
-Do you know Rodrigo Mendoza?
-Yes, l know him.

86
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,882
Come with me.

87
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:32,682
I have a task, and you are
the only one who can do it.

88
00:27:32,847 --> 00:27:36,283
He's been here for six months,
but he won't see anybody.

89
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:39,445
I think he wants to die.

90
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:18,402
So. . .

91
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:22,355
. . .you killed your brother.

92
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:28,443
And it was a duel.
And the law can't touch you.

93
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,717
Is this remorse?

94
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,406
Leave. . .

95
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,606
. . .priest.

96
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:45,637
Maybe you wish l was your executioner.
Perhaps that would be easier.

97
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,321
Leave me alone.

98
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:53,082
-You know what l am.
-Yes.

99
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:58,880
You're a mercenary,
you're a slave trader. . .

100
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:02,756
. . .and you killed your brother.
I know.

101
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:05,566
And you loved him.

102
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:11,841
Although you chose
a strange way to show it.

103
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:24,923
Are you laughing at me?
Are you laughing at me?

104
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:27,647
I'm laughing at you. . .

105
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,685
. . .because all l see is laughable.

106
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:36,126
I see a man running away, a man
hiding from the world. I see a coward.

107
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:39,323
Go on.

108
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:43,443
Go on.

109
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:56,999
So is that it?
ls this how you mean to go on?

110
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,676
-There is nothing else.
-There is life.

111
00:30:02,847 --> 00:30:06,476
-There is no life.
-There is a way out, Mendoza.

112
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:09,876
For me, there is no redemption.

113
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:13,722
God gave us the burden of freedom.
You chose your crime.

114
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:18,403
Do you have the courage to choose
your penance? Do you dare do that?

115
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,116
There is no penance
hard enough for me.

116
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:30,076
-But do you dare try it?
-Do l dare?

117
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:33,241
Do you dare to see it fail?

118
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:04,042
-Father?
-Aye?

119
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:07,324
How long must he carry
that stupid thing?

120
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:09,955
God knows, Father John.

121
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:27,485
-Ralph, here.
-Thank you.

122
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:35,798
Father?

123
00:34:36,687 --> 00:34:42,398
He's done this penance long enough, and,
well, the other brothers think the same.

124
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:45,602
But he doesn't think so, John.

125
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:49,246
Until he does, neither do l.

126
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:56,321
We're not the members of a democracy,
Father. We're members of an order.

127
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:00,686
No.

128
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,485
No.

129
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:04,843
Thank you.

130
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:13,958
Thank you, Lord, for our food
and all your other blessings. Amen.

131
00:45:19,847 --> 00:45:22,042
Oh, good Lord.

132
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:26,999
-Did you cook this?
-Yes.

133
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:30,163
Did you put in all the chilies?

134
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:34,997
I'm afraid l did.

135
00:45:36,327 --> 00:45:40,240
I'm sorry. I was trained
as a mercenary, not as a cook.

136
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,238
-This is true.
-It's dreadful.

137
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:45,961
-But the bread is good.
-It's not bad.

138
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:49,961
Father, l want to thank you
for having me here.

139
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:55,202
You should thank the Guarani.

140
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,598
How?

141
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:09,717
Read this.

142
00:46:15,367 --> 00:46:19,121
"Though l have all faith
so that l could remove mountains...

143
00:46:19,287 --> 00:46:22,245
...and have not love, l am nothing.

144
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:25,638
And though l bestow all my goods
to feed the poor...

145
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:28,799
...and though l give my body
to be burned...

146
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:33,279
...and have not love,
it profiteth me nothing.

147
00:46:33,447 --> 00:46:37,520
Love suffereth long and is kind.

148
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:39,644
Love envieth not.

149
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:44,039
Love vaunteth not itself,
is not puffed up.

150
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,281
When l was a child,
l spake as a child...

151
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:57,723
...l understood as a child,
l thought as a child.

152
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:03,007
But when l became a man,
l put away childish things.

153
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:09,356
But now abideth faith, hope, love....
These three.

154
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:13,281
But the greatest of these is love. "

155
00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:21,122
They've agreed.

156
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:26,636
If you're going to become a Jesuit,
you must accept my orders. . .

157
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:30,516
. . .as if they were the orders
of a commander. Can you do that?

158
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:33,247
Yes, Father.

159
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:01,082
Let us pray for our brother Rodrigo.

160
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:06,996
Christ, you led Father lgnatius to
renounce the snares of this world. . .

161
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:11,922
. . .and to put on the livery
of labor and humiliation.

162
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:19,276
Now we ask your blessing on Rodrigo
as we welcome him into our community.

163
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:24,005
Teach him to be generous,
to labor and not to count the cost. . .

164
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:28,957
. . .to serve with no reward,
save the doing of your will.

165
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:31,319
Amen.

166
00:48:38,447 --> 00:48:40,881
Welcome home, brother.

167
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:10,076
This seeking to create
a paradise on earth...

168
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:13,080
...how easily it offends.

169
00:49:13,247 --> 00:49:15,044
Your Holiness is offended...

170
00:49:15,207 --> 00:49:19,325
...because it may distract from
that paradise which comes hereafter.

171
00:49:19,487 --> 00:49:22,445
The Spanish and Portuguese kings
are offended...

172
00:49:22,607 --> 00:49:26,759
...because a paradise of the poor
is seldom pleasing to those who rule.

173
00:49:26,927 --> 00:49:30,840
And the settlers here are offended
for the same reason.

174
00:49:31,007 --> 00:49:34,283
So it was this burden l carried
to South America:

175
00:49:34,447 --> 00:49:37,962
To satisfy the Portuguese wish
to enlarge their empire...

176
00:49:38,127 --> 00:49:42,040
... to satisfy the Spanish desire that
this would do them no harm...

177
00:49:42,207 --> 00:49:43,959
... to satisfy Your Holiness...

178
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:48,405
... that these monarchs would threaten
no more the power of the church...

179
00:49:48,567 --> 00:49:51,479
...and to ensure for you all...

180
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:57,483
... that the Jesuits here could no longer
deny you these satisfactions.

181
00:49:57,647 --> 00:50:00,923
I've spent half my life
waiting for Rome.

182
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,681
Stop playing with that.

183
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:07,961
-What time is it?
-Calm down.

184
00:50:08,127 --> 00:50:10,004
Ten to.

185
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:13,925
Let me see how the children are doing.

186
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:16,245
Good.

187
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:39,757
Twenty-four.

188
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:43,518
Thirty-nine.

189
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:10,404
Over there, please.

190
00:51:20,927 --> 00:51:24,283
-Those are Guarani?
-Yes, Your Eminence.

191
00:51:24,447 --> 00:51:27,166
-Extraordinary.
-What?

192
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:30,444
Very difficult to tell
what they're thinking.

193
00:51:30,607 --> 00:51:33,246
-Have you found this, Senor Hontar?
-I have.

194
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:36,285
I had that reaction when l first came,
Your Eminence.

195
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:41,403
Pretty creature.
She'll fetch a lot of money in Lisbon.

196
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:45,082
Yes. Well, perhaps
she doesn't want to go to Lisbon.

197
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:47,477
Perhaps not.

198
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:52,196
Well, Your Eminence,
as to the missions. . . .

199
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:56,997
We expect no political difference between
the Papacy and Spain and Portugal?

200
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:58,759
Why should there be?

201
00:51:58,927 --> 00:52:03,284
Between ourselves, Your Eminence,
the Jesuits are too powerful here.

202
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:05,805
Indeed?

203
00:52:07,927 --> 00:52:12,239
-Well, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen. . . .
-Your Eminence.

204
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:15,002
By the way, gentlemen. . .

205
00:52:15,847 --> 00:52:18,520
. . .I myself was a Jesuit once.

206
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:34,759
So l had arrived in South America, my
head replete with the matters of Europe.

207
00:52:34,927 --> 00:52:39,364
But l soon began to understand,
for the first time...

208
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:43,918
... what a strange world
l had been sent to judge.

209
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:30,325
Don Cabeza, how can you possibly
refer to this child as an animal?

210
00:53:30,487 --> 00:53:33,399
A parrot can be taught to sing,
Your Eminence.

211
00:53:33,687 --> 00:53:37,965
Yes, but how does one teach it
to sing as melodiously as this?

212
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:42,524
Your Eminence.

213
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:47,796
This is a child of the jungle,
an animal with a human voice.

214
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:50,606
If it were human,
an animal would cringe at its vices.

215
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:53,725
These creatures
are lethal and lecherous.

216
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:57,602
They have to be subdued by the sword
and brought to labor by the whip.

217
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:00,725
What they say is sheer nonsense.

218
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:08,803
Father Gabriel, of the mission of
San Carlos, from which the boy comes.

219
00:54:09,087 --> 00:54:10,884
And that is where?

220
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:19,524
That is here.
Above the falls, in Spanish territory.

221
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:24,397
No, that is territory which used
to be Spanish. Now it's Portuguese.

222
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:29,357
-That is for His Eminence to decide.
-No, that is a state matter.

223
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:35,204
It was decided by the Treaty of Madrid
and concluded by Spain and Portugal.

224
00:54:35,367 --> 00:54:38,996
But surely the missions will remain
under church protection?

225
00:54:39,407 --> 00:54:43,719
That is what His Eminence
is here to decide, Father Gabriel.

226
00:54:50,127 --> 00:54:52,595
Continue, Father.

227
00:54:56,207 --> 00:55:00,598
Your Eminence, below the falls,
the jungle, if it has to be divided. . .

228
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:03,804
. . .may be divided between
the Spanish and Portuguese.

229
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:08,085
But above the falls, it still
belongs to God and the Guarani.

230
00:55:08,247 --> 00:55:12,445
There's no one else there.
And they are not naturally animals.

231
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:15,405
-They're naturally spiritual.
-Spiritual?

232
00:55:15,807 --> 00:55:20,801
-They kill their own young.
-That is true. May l answer that?

233
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:26,485
Every man and woman is allowed
one child. If a third is born, it is killed.

234
00:55:26,647 --> 00:55:30,640
But this is not some animal rite.
It's a necessity for survival.

235
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:34,121
They can only run
with one child apiece.

236
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:38,121
And what do they run from?
They run from us.

237
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:41,006
-That is, they run from slavery.
-Rubbish.

238
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,886
-It is well-known--
-Rubbish. Your Eminence?

239
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:46,006
Your Eminence?

240
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:48,442
Rubbish. Rubbish.

241
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:50,720
Silence.

242
00:55:53,207 --> 00:55:56,597
In the territories covered by Spain,
there is no slavery.

243
00:55:57,567 --> 00:56:01,321
That institution is permitted
in the territories of our neighbors. . .

244
00:56:01,487 --> 00:56:05,196
. . .the Portuguese, and is, to my mind,
much misunderstood.

245
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:07,927
But here, in Spanish territory. . .

246
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:12,160
. . .we run our plantation in accordance
with the laws of Spain. . .

247
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:15,364
. . .and the precepts of the church.

248
00:56:17,847 --> 00:56:18,836
That is a lie.

249
00:56:22,807 --> 00:56:24,240
That is a lie!

250
00:56:27,007 --> 00:56:30,204
I cannot and will not
accept a challenge from a monk.

251
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:34,876
-His cloth protects him.
-My cloth protects you.

252
00:56:35,047 --> 00:56:38,596
In the name of the king,
l demand an apology!

253
00:56:38,767 --> 00:56:42,396
I want an apology now!
Damn you, l won't stand for this!

254
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:54,685
Your Eminence, we've just seen
a good example of Jesuit contempt. . .

255
00:56:54,847 --> 00:56:57,839
. . .for the authority of the state.

256
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,599
Member of your community,
Father Gabriel?

257
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:13,120
Yes.

258
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:18,282
Come.

259
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:22,676
-That was perfect.
-What?

260
00:57:22,847 --> 00:57:26,601
A flash of Jesuit temper was just
what we needed him to see.

261
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:30,760
-What do you mean?
-Be patient, will you?

262
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:34,886
All we need is a little patience.
He knows what to do.

263
00:57:47,927 --> 00:57:51,715
-You will apologize to Don Cabeza.
-What he said was a lie.

264
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:56,039
Silence. You will apologize. Go now.

265
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:09,682
-What was he before he joined you?
-A mercenary and a slave trader.

266
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:18,640
-Will he apologize?
-Yes, he will.

267
00:58:31,525 --> 00:58:34,961
You should know that the Spanish
do have slaves here.

268
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:38,401
They buy them from the Portuguese,
amongst others.

269
00:58:39,325 --> 00:58:44,160
-And Don Cabeza connives at this?
-Yes.

270
00:58:44,765 --> 00:58:47,154
Profits by it too.

271
00:58:47,325 --> 00:58:52,160
Don Cabeza wants the mission territories
to be taken over by the Portuguese. Why?

272
00:58:52,325 --> 00:58:56,284
Because the missions are the
only sanctuary left for the Guarani.

273
00:58:56,445 --> 00:58:59,403
Without the shelter we provide
under Spanish law. . .

274
00:58:59,565 --> 00:59:02,033
. . .the lndians have no protection
against slavery.

275
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,554
They come to us of their own free will.

276
00:59:06,605 --> 00:59:10,234
-Truly?
-Ask them. Ask the Guarani.

277
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:16,476
Nine-tenths of what they earn goes back
into the community, into their lives.

278
00:59:16,645 --> 00:59:19,318
Father Gabriel, what do you think
is at issue here?

279
00:59:22,245 --> 00:59:25,874
-The work of God is at issue.
-No, what is at issue. . .

280
00:59:26,045 --> 00:59:30,755
. . .is the very existence of the
Jesuit order, both here and in Europe.

281
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:36,675
And l assure you that
the courts of Europe are a jungle. . .

282
00:59:36,845 --> 00:59:39,962
. . .in comparison with which
your jungle here is a tidy garden.

283
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:42,434
But is that to stand in our way?

284
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:56,082
Thank you.

285
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:08,961
-But why must l apologize? Why?
-Because l order it.

286
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:11,434
-It was a lie.
-Nevertheless, l order it.

287
01:00:11,605 --> 01:00:16,042
Don Cabeza hates Jesuits and lndians.
He and the Portuguese are ruthless.

288
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:18,436
-Can't you see that?
-Of course.

289
01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:21,722
-Then why must l apologize?
-What better excuse can we give them. . .

290
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:27,278
. . .but that one of our order, albeit a
novice, publicly insults one of them?

291
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:31,599
Now, you will apologize.

292
01:00:36,645 --> 01:00:39,364
Or are you no longer a Jesuit?

293
01:01:37,205 --> 01:01:40,436
By order of holy obedience,
without reservation. . .

294
01:01:40,605 --> 01:01:45,998
. . .I ask Don Cabeza to pardon
my presumption and my insolence.

295
01:01:50,285 --> 01:01:53,721
Well, l accept.

296
01:01:54,165 --> 01:01:56,042
Why not?

297
01:01:56,205 --> 01:02:00,881
But as l said before, l cannot accept
a challenge from a priest.

298
01:02:01,045 --> 01:02:04,515
True, which makes my insolence
all the more insolent. . .

299
01:02:04,685 --> 01:02:06,721
. . .and your pardon twice as gracious.

300
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,883
Your Eminence, l ask your pardon too.

301
01:02:12,085 --> 01:02:18,035
I ask the pardon of this assembly.
I ask for the pardon of my brothers.

302
01:02:18,205 --> 01:02:20,002
And l ask for your pardon. . .

303
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:25,515
-. . .for insulting His Excellency.
-Thank you, that will do.

304
01:02:32,845 --> 01:02:36,315
Well, that was most gratifying,
Your Eminence.

305
01:02:37,525 --> 01:02:43,600
Do you think you could tell us about
your attitude to the transference. . .

306
01:02:43,925 --> 01:02:45,881
-. . .of the missions' territories?
-Precisely.

307
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:51,802
I have kept these matters in the front
of my mind ever since l came here.

308
01:02:51,965 --> 01:02:55,196
But l do not think
l should make a final decision. . .

309
01:02:55,365 --> 01:02:59,756
. . .until l have seen these mission
territories with my own eyes.

310
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:03,042
There are numerous missions
that l should inspect.

311
01:03:03,205 --> 01:03:07,164
But l have decided that
l shall begin with the oldest...

312
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:11,238
... the great mission of San Miguel.

313
01:03:21,365 --> 01:03:25,074
Your Holiness, a surgeon,
to save the body...

314
01:03:25,245 --> 01:03:28,521
...must often hack off a limb.

315
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:34,362
But, in truth, nothing had prepared me
for the beauty and the power...

316
01:03:34,525 --> 01:03:38,757
...of the limb that l
had come here to sever.

317
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:19,799
-Very impressive.
-Perhaps l'm missing something.

318
01:05:19,965 --> 01:05:23,878
I can't see any difference
between this plantation and my own.

319
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,764
That is the difference.
This plantation is theirs.

320
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:38,722
This is another difference.

321
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:46,680
A runaway slave. Bought by
a Spanish settler from a slave trader.

322
01:05:47,285 --> 01:05:50,641
I see. Is that lawful?

323
01:05:50,805 --> 01:05:53,080
Supply and demand is the law of trade.

324
01:05:53,245 --> 01:05:56,282
-And the law of souls?
-What's a few cuts on the back. . .

325
01:05:56,445 --> 01:06:00,961
. . .compared with what you offer them?
Torments of hell? lmprisoned souls?

326
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,958
Think of that, Your Eminence.

327
01:06:10,485 --> 01:06:13,875
Father lbaye, shall we continue?

328
01:06:52,565 --> 01:06:54,920
What was your income last year?

329
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:59,158
Last year, 1 20,000 escudos.

330
01:06:59,325 --> 01:07:01,839
And how was it distributed?

331
01:07:02,205 --> 01:07:05,959
It is shared among them equally.
This is a community.

332
01:07:07,005 --> 01:07:10,884
Yes, there is a French radical group
that teaches that doctrine.

333
01:07:11,045 --> 01:07:16,358
Your Eminence, it was the doctrine
of the early Christians.

334
01:07:16,525 --> 01:07:20,438
Well, l am inexpressibly impressed
by your achievement, Father.

335
01:07:20,605 --> 01:07:25,235
-And will that save us?
-I hope it may, Father.

336
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:32,157
The court of Portugal is atheistic,
but you and l are Christian Catholics.

337
01:07:32,325 --> 01:07:36,796
-And you serve a Christian king.
-Come, l also serve a Catholic king.

338
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:40,799
You serve the Marquis of Pombal,
who is hostile the church. . .

339
01:07:40,965 --> 01:07:43,001
. . .and rules your king.

340
01:07:43,165 --> 01:07:48,797
I suggest we advise your king to postpone
the transfer of the mission territories. . .

341
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:51,763
. . .until Portugal guarantees
their survival.

342
01:07:51,925 --> 01:07:55,361
And l suggest we do this
in the hope of heaven. . .

343
01:07:55,525 --> 01:07:59,040
. . .through the intercession
of our merciful Redeemer.

344
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:04,677
In my opinion, the work of the
missions is the work of the devil.

345
01:08:04,845 --> 01:08:09,794
They teach contempt for lawful profit,
and they disobey the king's authority.

346
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:13,241
The paramount vow of a Jesuit
is a vow of obedience.

347
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:17,478
Then let them obey.
Tell them, Your Eminence.

348
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,718
Am l disturbing you?

349
01:08:40,765 --> 01:08:44,758
I fear l have bad tidings
from the Marquis of Pombal.

350
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:57,243
Between ourselves, l should like
to express my personal regret.

351
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:03,520
He is determined to destroy
the power of the church.

352
01:09:06,285 --> 01:09:10,119
And your Christian community
is commercially competitive.

353
01:09:10,285 --> 01:09:14,437
Yes. It's very prosperous.

354
01:09:14,845 --> 01:09:17,882
Isn't that precisely why
you want to take it over?

355
01:09:18,285 --> 01:09:22,801
You should've achieved a noble failure
if you wanted the state's approval.

356
01:09:22,965 --> 01:09:26,355
There's nothing we like better
than a noble failure.

357
01:09:26,525 --> 01:09:30,996
It's deeply reassuring
to a trading nation such as my own.

358
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:37,196
You're not going to read it?

359
01:09:37,365 --> 01:09:41,244
I don't need to read it
to know what it contains.

360
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,713
So, what will you do?

361
01:09:45,885 --> 01:09:48,957
As my conscience dictates.

362
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:51,036
What else?

363
01:10:23,005 --> 01:10:26,122
He's been in there five hours.

364
01:11:24,565 --> 01:11:28,240
Come with me to my mission
in San Carlos.

365
01:11:30,005 --> 01:11:32,439
There are so many distractions here.

366
01:11:33,725 --> 01:11:37,434
It's hard to see anything clearly.

367
01:11:39,605 --> 01:11:44,474
I think that, there, your prayers
might meet with better fortune.

368
01:11:46,565 --> 01:11:51,685
I think, there, God would tell you
what it would be good to do.

369
01:11:53,845 --> 01:11:57,235
And he'd give you the strength
and the grace to do it. . .

370
01:11:59,645 --> 01:12:01,840
. . .whatever it costs you.

371
01:12:59,925 --> 01:13:01,995
The Garden of Eden.

372
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,315
It's a trifle overgrown.

373
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:08,242
Though l knew, in Europe, states were
tearing at the authority of the church...

374
01:18:08,405 --> 01:18:11,397
...and though l knew that to
preserve itself there...

375
01:18:11,565 --> 01:18:15,478
... the church must show
its authority over the Jesuits here...

376
01:18:15,645 --> 01:18:19,797
...l had to wonder whether these
lndians would not have preferred...

377
01:18:19,965 --> 01:18:25,244
... that the sea and wind
had not brought any of us to them.

378
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:39,517
They say they don't understand
what you mean.

379
01:18:42,165 --> 01:18:46,397
They want you to speak more clearly.
What do you want them to do?

380
01:18:46,965 --> 01:18:49,604
They must leave the mission.

381
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:22,083
They say the mission is their home.

382
01:19:22,685 --> 01:19:24,835
They must learn to submit
to the will of God.

383
01:19:28,485 --> 01:19:29,804
Tell them.

384
01:19:49,805 --> 01:19:51,761
They say it was the will of God. . .

385
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:54,393
. . .that they left the jungle
and built the mission.

386
01:19:55,805 --> 01:19:58,763
They don't understand
why God has changed his mind.

387
01:19:58,925 --> 01:20:01,439
I cannot hope
to understand God's reasons.

388
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:10,764
He says, how does he know
you know God's will?

389
01:20:14,925 --> 01:20:18,122
He thinks you speak not for God,
but for Portugal.

390
01:20:18,285 --> 01:20:22,995
I do not personally speak for God,
but l speak for the church. . .

391
01:20:23,165 --> 01:20:25,360
. . .which is God's instrument on earth.

392
01:20:39,005 --> 01:20:43,203
-He says, speak to the king of Portugal.
-I have. He will not listen.

393
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:51,923
He said he is also a king.
He also will not listen.

394
01:21:05,725 --> 01:21:08,922
He says they were wrong
ever to have trusted us.

395
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:14,762
-They're going to fight.
-You must persuade them not to fight.

396
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:21,159
I have failed to persuade you
to fight on their behalf.

397
01:21:21,325 --> 01:21:25,477
If they do fight, it is absolutely
imperative that no one of you. . .

398
01:21:25,645 --> 01:21:29,399
. . .should even seemed
to have encouraged them to do so.

399
01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:34,764
And therefore, all of you will return
with me to Asuncion tomorrow.

400
01:21:35,645 --> 01:21:39,524
If anyone should disobey this,
he will be excommunicated.

401
01:21:39,685 --> 01:21:43,155
Cut off. Cast out.

402
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:48,441
Why must they fight?

403
01:21:48,605 --> 01:21:52,757
-Why can't they return to the jungle?
-Because this is their home.

404
01:21:54,765 --> 01:21:57,962
Did you know this was going
to be your decision?

405
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:02,118
-Yes.
-Then why did you come, Your Eminence?

406
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:07,484
To persuade you not to resist the
transfer of the mission territories.

407
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:13,878
If the Jesuits
resist the Portuguese. . .

408
01:22:14,045 --> 01:22:16,798
. . .the Jesuit order
will be expelled from Portugal.

409
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:22,562
And if Portugal, then Spain,
France, ltaly. . . . Who knows?

410
01:22:22,725 --> 01:22:26,240
If your order is to survive at all. . .

411
01:22:26,405 --> 01:22:30,239
. . .the missions here
must be sacrificed.

412
01:22:37,365 --> 01:22:38,684
What were they saying?

413
01:22:39,805 --> 01:22:42,877
They said the devil
lives in the forest.

414
01:22:43,685 --> 01:22:47,041
-They want to stay here.
-And what did you say?

415
01:22:47,405 --> 01:22:50,363
I said l'd stay with them.

416
01:25:18,965 --> 01:25:22,241
I want to renounce
my vows of obedience.

417
01:25:22,845 --> 01:25:24,642
Get out.

418
01:25:24,805 --> 01:25:27,763
-I want to explain--
-Get out. I won't listen to you.

419
01:25:34,325 --> 01:25:36,634
Just you?

420
01:25:36,805 --> 01:25:39,922
No. It's Ralph and John too.

421
01:25:40,965 --> 01:25:44,321
What do you want, captain,
an honorable death?

422
01:25:44,925 --> 01:25:47,075
They want to live, Father.

423
01:25:47,805 --> 01:25:51,195
They say that God has left them,
he's deserted them.

424
01:25:51,445 --> 01:25:52,673
Has he?

425
01:25:55,765 --> 01:25:59,519
-You shouldn't have become a priest.
-But l am, and they need me.

426
01:25:59,685 --> 01:26:01,835
Then help them as a priest!

427
01:26:03,645 --> 01:26:09,038
If you die with blood on your hands,
you betray everything we've done.

428
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:13,756
You promised your life to God.
And God is love!

429
01:31:21,485 --> 01:31:24,477
Weren't you supposed
to be on guard last night?

430
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,397
Look what happened!

431
01:31:27,325 --> 01:31:29,998
Get back there with the others.

432
01:31:30,165 --> 01:31:33,475
They've taken three guns,
gunpowder, pistols. . .

433
01:31:33,645 --> 01:31:36,239
. . .and l don't know what else.

434
01:33:54,845 --> 01:33:58,201
Father, l've come
to ask you to bless me.

435
01:34:03,325 --> 01:34:04,519
No.

436
01:34:08,965 --> 01:34:11,399
If you're right,
you'll have God's blessing.

437
01:34:13,165 --> 01:34:16,396
If you're wrong,
my blessing won't mean anything.

438
01:34:18,565 --> 01:34:21,716
If might is right. . .

439
01:34:21,885 --> 01:34:25,321
. . .then love has no place
in the world.

440
01:34:26,405 --> 01:34:29,556
It may be so.

441
01:34:31,245 --> 01:34:34,760
But l don't have the strength
to live in a world like that.

442
01:34:42,285 --> 01:34:44,082
I can't bless you.

443
01:37:08,325 --> 01:37:11,715
Down there. Down there.

444
01:37:12,325 --> 01:37:13,804
Bring up both cannons.

445
01:37:18,885 --> 01:37:21,160
Quickly. Quickly.

446
01:37:22,525 --> 01:37:24,117
The other cannon as well.

447
01:40:13,245 --> 01:40:16,635
Indians! Turn around!

448
01:40:17,805 --> 01:40:22,401
Turn around! Face them!

449
01:42:25,885 --> 01:42:27,284
Fire!

450
01:42:59,285 --> 01:43:01,401
We'll have to move the cannon.

451
01:43:01,565 --> 01:43:04,762
Move this cannon. Move it.
And that one.

452
01:43:05,445 --> 01:43:07,481
Over there. Shoot the priest.
Get him!

453
01:44:30,565 --> 01:44:35,161
-None of us wants to do this.
-I'm not interested. Get in position.

454
01:45:26,485 --> 01:45:28,123
Row.

455
01:45:42,845 --> 01:45:44,358
After him! Faster!

456
01:45:52,125 --> 01:45:54,685
Don't let the priest get away!

457
01:45:54,845 --> 01:45:56,483
After him!

458
01:46:05,565 --> 01:46:07,635
Look out! The falls! Halt!

459
01:46:11,845 --> 01:46:14,040
Back! Back! Halt!

460
01:46:24,325 --> 01:46:26,520
Go back!

461
01:53:13,725 --> 01:53:18,719
And you have the effrontery to tell me
that this slaughter was necessary?

462
01:53:20,925 --> 01:53:24,042
I did what l had to do.

463
01:53:24,205 --> 01:53:28,483
Given the legitimate purpose,
which you sanctioned. . .

464
01:53:28,645 --> 01:53:34,641
. . .I would have to say, yes.
In truth, yes.

465
01:53:49,125 --> 01:53:51,878
You had no alternative, Your Eminence.

466
01:53:54,365 --> 01:53:56,481
We must work in the world.

467
01:53:58,165 --> 01:54:00,395
The world is thus.

468
01:54:01,325 --> 01:54:04,362
No, Senor Hontar. . .

469
01:54:04,525 --> 01:54:07,323
. . .thus have we made the world.

470
01:54:11,645 --> 01:54:13,840
Thus have l made it.

471
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:42,197
So, Your Holiness...

472
01:55:42,365 --> 01:55:48,122
...now your priests are dead,
and l am left alive.

473
01:55:48,285 --> 01:55:54,235
But, in truth, it is l who am dead,
and they who live.

474
01:55:54,405 --> 01:55:57,363
For, as always, Your Holiness...

475
01:55:57,525 --> 01:56:01,200
... the spirit of the dead
will survive...

476
01:56:01,365 --> 01:56:05,074
...in the memory of the living.
