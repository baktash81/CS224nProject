00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:53,730
Have you seen Dr. Meade?

3
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,399
Dr. Meade!

4
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,839
Oh, can you help me
find Dr. Meade?

5
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,709
Oh...

6
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:11,246
God, help us.

7
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:17,419
God, save the Confederacy!

8
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,844
Hello, my fellow Americans.

9
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,848
They say we may have
lost the battle

10
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,517
but we didn't lose the war.

11
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,722
Yes, my friends,
we are under attack.

12
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:57,357
You may have read about this
in your local newspapers

13
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,359
or seen it on the evening news.

14
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:00,761
That's right.

15
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:04,664
We are living in an era
marked by the spread

16
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,634
of integration
and miscegenation.

17
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,839
The <i>Brown</i> decision.

18
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,473
Ah-ah-ah!

19
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,575
The <i>Brown</i> decision,

20
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:18,012
forced upon us by
the Jewish-controlled puppets

21
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,815
on the U.S. Supreme Court,

22
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:25,152
compelling white children
to go to school

23
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:28,155
with an inferior race,

24
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:30,157
is the final nail
in a coffin...

25
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:34,494
Is the final nail
in a black coffin

26
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:38,565
towards America
becoming a mongrel nation.

27
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,768
We had a great way of life.
We had...

28
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,736
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma!

29
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,005
We had a great way of life.

30
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:47,640
We had a great
way of life.

31
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,910
We had a great way of life

32
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:52,780
until the Martin Luther Coons
of this world

33
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,782
and their army of Commies

34
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:56,649
started their
civil rights assault

35
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:01,454
against our holy white
Protestant values.

36
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:04,091
Do you really want
your precious white child

37
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:06,526
going to school with Negroes?

38
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:09,096
They're lying, dirty monkeys,

39
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:12,565
stopping at nothing to gain
their equality with white men.

40
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,435
- Oh, my God.
- Rapists, murderers,

41
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:17,570
craving the virgin white...

42
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,206
- Is it "virgin pure"?
- Yes.

43
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,109
Rapists, murderers,

44
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:24,979
craving the virgin pure flesh
of white women.

45
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:28,514
They are super predators!

46
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:30,885
And the Negro's insidious
tactics, under the tutelage

47
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:34,454
of high-ranking,
blood-sucking Jews,

48
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:37,590
using an army of outside
northern black beast preda...

49
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,193
What is it?
"Black beast agitat..."

50
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,729
- "Agitators."
- God, watch this! God!

51
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:46,133
Using an army of outside
northern black beast agitators

52
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:49,970
determined to overthrow
the God-commanded

53
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:55,009
and biblically inspired rule
of the white race.

54
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:57,412
It's an international
Jewish conspiracy.

55
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:00,983
May God bless us all.

56
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:04,787
God bless you, too, sir.

57
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,853
Why weren't you drafted
into the Vietnam War?

58
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,888
I went to college, sir.

59
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,758
How do you feel about Vietnam?

60
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,227
I have mixed feelings, sir.

61
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,130
Would you call yourself
a womanizer?

62
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:25,199
- No, I would not, sir.
- You frequent nightclubs?

63
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,101
- No, sir.
- Do you drink?

64
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:29,303
Only on special occasions, sir.

65
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:31,271
Ever done any drugs?

66
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:33,741
Only those prescribed
by my doctor, sir.

67
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:35,009
Well, that's kind of rare

68
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:37,244
for a young, hip
soul brother like you.

69
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,346
Uh, yes, sir.

70
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:41,915
But my father
was in the military,

71
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,917
and my parents,
they raised me the right way.

72
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,021
How do you get along
with people, generally?

73
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:48,956
Sir, they treat me right,
I treat them right.

74
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,358
Like I said before, I was
raised up the right way, so...

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,060
I mean, have you ever had
any negative...

76
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,229
What would you do if another
cop called you a nigger?

77
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,199
Or worse.

78
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:01,634
Would that happen, sir?

79
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:04,572
Shit...

80
00:06:07,276 --> 00:06:09,609
There's never been
a black cop in this city.

81
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,813
Now, if we make you an officer,
you will, in effect,

82
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:16,984
be the Jackie Robinson of the
Colorado Springs Police Force.

83
00:06:16,986 --> 00:06:19,219
And if you know anything
about Jackie Robinson,

84
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,389
you know he had to take
a lot of, uh, uh, guff

85
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:24,958
from his fellow teammates,
the fans,

86
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,693
other teams and the press.

87
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:29,396
I know the Jackie Roosevelt
Robinson story, sir.

88
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:32,833
Good. So, knowing that,
if somebody calls you a nigger,

89
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,802
will you be able
to turn the other cheek?

90
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,205
If I had to, sir, yes.

91
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,009
Yes, I would.

92
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:46,914
Son...
the mayor, the chief and I

93
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,983
think you might be the man
to open things up around here.

94
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:53,087
Chief Bridges will be
your Branch Rickey.

95
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,255
I'll have your back.

96
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:57,359
But I can only do so much.

97
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:01,661
The weight of this
is going to be on you...

98
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:03,030
and you alone.

99
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:05,367
Thank you for the opportunity,
gentlemen.

100
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:23,183
- Wow. Cybill Shepherd.
- Yeah.

101
00:07:23,185 --> 00:07:25,052
I loved her
in <i>The Last Picture Show.</i>

102
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:26,420
Never saw it.

103
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,255
I don't like
black-and-white movies.

104
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:29,790
So, what do you think?

105
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:32,126
I think she's
a really good actress.

106
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:33,427
Oh, come on.
You know you want

107
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:34,728
some of that.

108
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,263
Looking for a toad here.

109
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:37,766
You're up.

110
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:41,101
Give me the record
for that toad,

111
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:42,371
Maurice Smalls.

112
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,496
While you're at it,
grab another toad,

113
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:11,167
Tippy Birdsong.

114
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,302
T-I-P-P-Y.

115
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:21,475
Can I help you?

116
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:22,876
May I have a minute, please?

117
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,146
Sit.

118
00:08:33,088 --> 00:08:35,522
Sergeant Trapp, Chief Bridges,

119
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:37,991
I'll get right to it.

120
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:40,194
I'd like to be
an undercover detective.

121
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:42,462
What, like Narcotics?

122
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:44,831
Whichever department
works, sir.

123
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,067
You just joined the force,
rookie.

124
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,535
I think I can do
some real good there.

125
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:51,004
- Is that right?
- I'm young.

126
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,272
There's a real niche for me.

127
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:53,840
Get in where I fit in.

128
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:56,944
You think a lot of yourself,
don't you?

129
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,881
I'll do whatever it takes.

130
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:01,949
And I hate the records room.

131
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:05,953
Well...

132
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:09,391
I think records is a good place
for you to start, rookie.

133
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:13,260
Chief, do you want me
clean-shaven?

134
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,562
I can even chop down
the natural.

135
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:17,931
No, no, no. You keep it.

136
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,334
I like the look.

137
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:22,771
I need a file on a toad.

138
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,913
You deaf?

139
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:35,983
I said I need a file on a toad.

140
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:38,218
- No toads here.
- Excuse me?

141
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,355
I said I don't have any toads.

142
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:43,557
I do have human beings.

143
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,027
You give me their names,
I'll get you the file.

144
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,496
I heard you think
you're hot shit,

145
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:53,367
but you ain't nothing
but a cold fart.

146
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:57,506
The name is Steven Wilson.

147
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:37,277
Was that respectful enough
for you,

148
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,012

Um, worked an all-night shift.

164

I've changed my mind.

165
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,037
You're coming in
a little early today.

166
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,706
I got an assignment for you.

167
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,208
12:00 noon sharp.

168
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,609
Narcotics division.

169
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:44,378
- Yes, sir.
- Wear street clothes.

170
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,612

Jimmy, the rookie's late.

175
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:02,396
You're late, rookie.

176
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:03,731
Sorry. Won't happen again.

177
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:06,400
We have limited time,
so I'll be quick.

178
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:08,736
The black radical,
Stokely Carmichael,

179
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:11,538
is giving a speech tonight
at Bell's Nightingale.

180
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
- Yep.
- Carmichael is a former

181
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,042
high-muckety-muck
with the Black Panthers.

182
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:19,079
And as far as I'm concerned,
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

183
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,716
was dead right when he said
the Black Panthers

184
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:23,483
are the greatest
internal threat

185
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:26,586
to the security
of these United States.

186
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:29,189
This Carmichael joker,

187
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,324
former Panther or not,
well, they say

188
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:33,660
he is a damn good speaker,

189
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:36,430
and so we don't want
this Carmichael

190
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:38,565
getting into the minds
of the good black people

191
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:42,035
here in Colorado Springs
and stirring them up.

192
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:45,172
Ron, your assignment is to go
to this speech tonight,

193
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:47,407
infiltrate this bunch
of subversives

194
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:49,142
and just monitor
the audience reaction

195
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,545
to Carmichael's speech.

196
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:52,646
You ready?

197
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,014
Born ready.

198
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:55,350
I'm not ready.

199
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:00,688
Any chance this thing fucks up?

200
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,589
Oh, fuck yeah.

201
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,024
Then what?

202
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:05,192
Just stick to the game plan.

203
00:13:05,194 --> 00:13:06,193
Which is?

204
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:08,328
Uh... improvise.

205
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,297
- Like jazz.
- Like bebop.

206
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:11,766
This isn't some big bust.

207
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:13,600
We just want some intel.
That's it.

208
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,602
And what if someone offers you
a marijuana cigarette?

209
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,671
- You mean a joint?
- Yeah.

210
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,139
Mary Jane.

211
00:13:23,713 --> 00:13:24,812
Excuse me.

212
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,413
Soul brother,

213
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:28,081
I'm already high on life. Can you dig it?

214
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,083
- It's dug.
- My man.

215
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,485
And if someone
pulls a gun on you?

216
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:32,753
Will that happen?

217
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:34,354
- Barrel of a .45 in your face.
- Shit.

218
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,356
Finger on the trigger.
Now what?

219
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,758
Blood, get that gun
out of my face.

220
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,793
Peace, love and soul.

221
00:13:38,795 --> 00:13:40,227
Gun is still in your face.

222
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:42,629
I de-escalate...
talk calmly, firmly.

223
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:44,732
Find a way out of there ASAP.

224
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,501
Relax.
We'll be outside listening in.

225
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:48,437
- Okay.
- Got it?

226
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,140
I got it.

227
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:56,076
I'm gone.

228
00:13:57,814 --> 00:13:59,279
Here we go.

229
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,300
- We need to take action.
- I can't believe he's here.

230
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:22,770
I just have so many questions
to ask him.

231
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:24,404
- But...
- Um...

232
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,740
How are you, uh...

233
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:27,474
how are you doing
this evening, my sister?

234
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:29,244
Can we help you?

235
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:34,414
I'm doing fine, my brother.

236
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,783
What? We don't know him.

237
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:38,652
What? Hakeem,
why you dragging me?

238
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:41,254
It's going to be
an amazing night.

239
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,356
Indeed, it is.

240
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,893
Have you heard Brother Kwame
speak before?

241
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:47,895
Who?

242
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:50,230
Uh, Kwame Ture.

243
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:53,400
Oh, uh, uh... well,
actually, I haven't, but...

244
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,335
- Okay.
- I didn't realize he changed his name.

245
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:58,438
Uh, yes, after he moved
to Africa.

246
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,840
- Hmm.
- He took the names

247
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:01,408
of Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana

248
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,510
and his mentor,
Sékou Touré of Guinea,

249
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:05,579
to honor the great leaders.

250
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:07,715
- Well, that is heavy.
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:09,583
You know how he got
to Colorado Springs?

252
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:12,218
Yeah, yeah. The, uh, Colorado
College Black Student Union

253
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,254
- invited him.
- Oh, I can dig it.

254
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:15,622
- I can dig it.
- Mm-hmm.

255
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,758
Are you, uh...
are you part of the Union?

256
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,860
I'm the president.

257
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:22,863
Really? I'm talking
to the president right now?

258
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:24,297
Yes, you are.

259
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,700
Right on, sister.

260
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:27,768
- Well, I bought a ticket.
- Mm-hmm.

261
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,370
May I skip the line since
I'm talking to the president?

262
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:32,940
There's no cutting in line.

263
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,641
To the back.

264
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,276
See you inside?

265
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:38,211
I'll see you
inside, my brother.

266
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,180
- Mrs. President.
- Right on.

267
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:42,616
Ungawa, Black Power!

268
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,618
The Black Student Union
of Colorado College

269
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,921
is honored to bring
the vanguard of revolutionaries

270
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:48,321
fighting for the rights

271
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,357
of black people
all over the world.

272
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,760
Let's show some black love

273
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:54,862
to the one and only,
the brother man with a plan

274
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,297
- who is sticking it to the man.
- Right on, right on.

275
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,401
Put your hands together,
my people, for our Kwame Ture.

276
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:15,548
Thank you, Sister Patrice.

277
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,685
- Thank you.
- And the Black Student Union.

278
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,286
I want to thank all of you,

279
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:22,288
my beloved sisters
and brothers,

280
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,657
for coming out tonight.

281
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,225
Okay!

282
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:27,928
But I'm here tonight
to tell you

283
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,497
that it is time

284
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:33,633
for you to stop running away
from being black.

285
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:36,238
Boom-shaka-laka!

286
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,709
It is time for you to stop
running away from being black.

287
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:42,642
You're college students, right?

288
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:43,844
- Right on.
- That's right.

289
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:46,446
You should think.

290
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:49,850
It is time for you
to understand that you,

291
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:53,253
as the growing intellectuals
of this country,

292
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:56,957
that you must define beauty
for black people.

293
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,893
- Okay!
- Now, that's Black Power.

294
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,766
Let me ask you something...
is beauty defined

295
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:07,802
as someone with a narrow nose?

296
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:10,503
- No!
- Thin lips?

297
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,006
No!

298
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:13,373
White skin?

299
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,809
- Uh-uh.
- Hell no!

300
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:16,944
- Hell no.
- Hell no!

301
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:18,511
'Cause you ain't got
none of that.

302
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,447
No. Okay.

303
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,952
Our lips are thick.

304
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:26,553
- Yes.
- Yes, they are!

305
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,388
Our noses broad.

306
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,457
- Our hair is nappy.
- Yes!

307
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,659
We are black,
and we are beautiful!

308
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:35,062
- Yes!
- Boom-shaka-laka!

309
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,333
You see,

310
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,770
we want to be so much like
the white people

311
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,705
who oppress us in this country.

312
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:46,841
- Nope!
- And because they hate us,

313
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:49,977
and because we are ashamed
of our African heritage,

314
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:52,012
we then hate ourselves.

315
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:54,414
Preach.

316
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:57,051
Y'all don't hear me tonight.

317
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:58,886
We hear you.

318
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:00,353
Y'all dig Tarzan?

319
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,590
Tarzan.
I'm gonna be honest.

320
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:08,428
When I was a boy, I used to go
to the Saturday matinees

321
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,964
and watch Tarzan all the time.

322
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:11,699
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

323
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:14,769
And white Tarzan used to
beat up the black natives.

324
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:16,469
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

325
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:20,908
And I would sit there,
yelling, "Kill the beasts!

326
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,343
"Kill the savages.

327
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:24,712
"Kill them.

328
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:27,782
Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them!"

329
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:30,918
But what I was saying was:
"Kill me."

330
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,586
That's right.

331
00:18:33,588 --> 00:18:36,523
It was as if a young Jewish boy
saw Nazis

332
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:38,726
taking Jews off
to concentration camps

333
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:40,593
and cheered them on.

334
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:44,364
Today, I want those chiefs
to beat the hell out of Tarzan

335
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:48,068
and send his lily white ass
on back to the caves of Europe.

336
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,371
- Boom-shaka-laka!
- Right on.

337
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:52,740
Right on.

338
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:55,608
But it takes time.

339
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,779
It takes time to become free
of the lies

340
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:01,614
and their shaming effects
on the black mind.

341
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:03,383
- Okay.
- It takes time to reject

342
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:04,752
the most important lie:

343
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:06,619
that black people
can't do the same things

344
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:09,023
- that white people do...
- That's a lie.

345
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:10,858
...unless a white person
helps them.

346
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,026
Talk about it.

347
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:15,863
Black Power also
means that we must unite.

348
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:17,832
We must unite,
and we must organize

349
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:20,433
to form a base to fight racism.

350
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:22,468
- Okay!
- Yes. Yes.

351
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,673
To fight our oppressors.

352
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:30,878
The vast majority of Negroes
around this country,

353
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,413
they live
in captive communities.

354
00:19:33,415 --> 00:19:35,481
And they must endure
their oppression

355
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:38,052
and their conditions,
because and only because

356
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:41,521
- they are black and powerless.
- Educate. Educate.

357
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,489
And now...

358
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:48,829
now we are being shot down
like dogs in the streets

359
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:51,866
by white racist cops.

360
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:53,433
Speak the truth.

361
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:55,135
I said we are
being shot down

362
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:57,604
in the streets
by white racist cops!

363
00:19:57,606 --> 00:20:00,506
Fuck the police.

364
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:02,710
We can no longer endure

365
00:20:02,712 --> 00:20:05,179
this kind of oppression
without retribution.

366
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,981
Hell no!

367
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:09,049
No more.

368
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:10,885
That war in Vietnam,

369
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:14,955
it is not only illegal;
it is immoral.

370
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:16,724
- That's right.
- Talk about it.

371
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,658
And you know what I tell them?

372
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,029
Hell no... we won't go!

373
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:23,998
Hell no, we won't go!

374
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Hell no,
we won't go!

375
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:28,102
Hell no, we won't go!

376
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,470
Hell no,
we won't go!

377
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:32,239
Hell no, we won't go!

378
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:34,074
Hell no,
we won't go!

379
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:36,143
Hell no, we won't go!

380
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:38,145
Hell no,
we won't go!

381
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:40,881
- Hell no, we won't go!
- We ain't going!

382
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:43,650
I'd rather see a brother

383
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:46,754
kill a white racist cop
than kill a Vietnamese.

384
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:48,989
Me, too.

385
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:51,125
Because at least,

386
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:55,930
if he kills a racist cop,
he is doing it for a reason:

387
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:57,932
because they are shooting
black people...

388
00:20:57,934 --> 00:20:59,800
- That's right.
- ...in the backs,

389
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:02,870
in these streets, right here
in this very country.

390
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:09,109
- They're killing us like dogs!
- Boom-shaka-laka!

391
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:10,545
Right here!

392
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:13,781
Right here!

393
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:17,251
I just want to leave you,
uh, in closing

394
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:19,687
'cause I know it's getting late
and y'all gotta go party.

395
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,188
I'm sorry, study.

396
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,823
- Um...
- We love you!

397
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,591
I just want to leave you,

398
00:21:25,593 --> 00:21:28,230
sisters and brothers,
with these last words.

399
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:33,267
If I am not for myself,

400
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,202
who will be?

401
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:40,908
If I am for myself alone,
who am I?

402
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,608
- Right.
- Hear, hear.

403
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,979
- If not now, when?
- When?

404
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:47,081
And if not you, who?

405
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,983
Who? Who?

406
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:51,952
Who? Who?

407
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:54,755
We need an undying love

408
00:21:54,757 --> 00:21:57,024
for black people,
wherever we may be.

409
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,727
All power to all the people.

410
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:01,962
All power
to all the people!

411
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:04,630
All power to all the people!

412
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:07,001
All power
to all the people!

413
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:09,269
All power to all the people!

414
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:11,772
All power
to all the people!

415
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:13,841
All power to all the people!

416
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:15,575
"All power
to all the people."

417
00:22:15,577 --> 00:22:17,044
Pretty powerful stuff.

418
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,245
Incredible words,
Brother Kwame.

419
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:19,313
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

420
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:20,714
Thank you, brother.
Appreciate it.

421
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,750
Brother...

422
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:24,118
I gotta ask you something.

423
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,953
Do you really think

424
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:27,921
war between the black race
and the white race

425
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:29,023
is inevitable?

426
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:30,057
Let me tell you.

427
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,725
Arm yourself, brother.

428
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,994
Get ready, 'cause
the revolution is coming.

429
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:38,699
Pick up a gun and arm yourself,
because trust me, it's coming.

430
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,666
- Thank you for coming tonight.
- God bless you.

431
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:43,370
You looked great
on that stage tonight.

432
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:46,206
- Thank you, my brother.
- All right.

433
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,075
I don't know what
you have planned now,

434
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:50,144
but maybe I can buy you
a drink?

435
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:52,279
Uh, I, uh...
I gotta make sure Brother Kwame

436
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:54,148
- is all squared away...
- What?!

437
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,252
...and he gets
to his hotel safely.

438
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:58,954
I can dig it.

439
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:03,090
But, you know, um,
if it's not too late,

440
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:05,292
maybe I can meet you
at the Red Lantern?

441
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:06,994
You know where that is?

442
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:09,196
Mm-hmm.

443
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:11,165
So I'll see you then.

444
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:12,632
Damn right. Ye-Yes.

445
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,101
Cool.

446
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:16,638
All power to all the people.

447
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,712
Hey. How you doing?

448
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:26,847
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

449
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:27,915
You won't believe
what happened.

450
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,016
What are you having?

451
00:23:29,018 --> 00:23:30,918
Bro Pope, 7 and 7, please.

452
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,386
Pigs pulled us over.

453
00:23:32,388 --> 00:23:33,821
Say what?

454
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:35,022
I don't want to see nothing

455
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:37,157
but black asses
and black elbows.

456
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,359
Spread 'em!

457
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:43,097
You that so-called big-shot
Panther nigger, aren't you?

458
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:46,166
I heard you was in town,
Stokely.

459
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:47,234
My name is Kwame Ture.

460
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:48,802
I don't give two shits

461
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,806
what your nigger name is!

462
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:55,209
Black bitch,
you get this Black Panther

463
00:23:55,211 --> 00:23:58,779
out of Colorado Springs
before sunrise, you hear me?

464
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:01,982
- Or you'll all go to jail.
- We were born in jail.

465
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:06,120
- Oh...
- Don't touch me!

466
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:07,988
- Don't touch her!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

467
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,223
- Get your hands off of her!
- Get your white hands off!

468
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,057
Keep your hands off of her!

469
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,725
Come on, get your hands
off of her!

470
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:13,827
Get off of me! Get off of me!

471
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,896
- Wait!
- Let her go, man!

472
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:17,133
You see the officers' names?

473
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:21,368
I know I should have, but...

474
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,936
the whole thing
was so frightening,

475
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:24,037
- I didn't.
- Oh.

476
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,205
Come on.

477
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:26,773
- Let's dance. Follow me.
- Mmm...

478
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:28,242
Come on.

Folks were hanging
on every word.

512
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:22,222
Like a Baptist church
on Christmas Sunday morning.

513
00:26:22,224 --> 00:26:24,358
- Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,893
Sounds like he had them
pretty riled up.

515
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:29,129
But I don't think
that means black folks

516
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:31,398
were ready to start
the revolution, Chief.

517
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
What makes you say that?

518
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:35,836
Nobody in there
was talking about that.

519
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:38,105
That wasn't the vibe.
Everybody was cool.

520
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,107
Let me get this straight.

521
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:44,945
He told a room of black folk
to get ready for a race war.

522
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:48,081
That they were going to have to
arm themselves and kill cops.

523
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,019
I mean, what about that?

524
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,586
Yeah, he said that, but, Chief,

525
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:54,888
I think it was just talk,
you know?

526
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,490
Rhetoric.

527
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,091
That's what I thought, too.

528
00:26:58,093 --> 00:27:00,127
- Jimmy?
- Like my partner said.

529
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,862
All right, well, thank goodness

530
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:04,364
Carmichael has left
Colorado Springs.

531
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:06,500
- Kwame Ture.
- What?

532
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:07,934
He changed his name

533
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:09,936
from Stokely Carmichael
to Kwame Ture.

534
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:11,872
I don't care
if he changed his name

535
00:27:11,874 --> 00:27:13,874
to that draft dodger,
Muhammad Ali.

536
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:15,876
All right?
He's still dangerous.

537
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:20,080
Did you hear the story
Patrice told me?

538
00:27:20,082 --> 00:27:21,481
No, I didn't.

539
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:24,151
About how the CSPD
pulled over her and Ture?

540
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:27,020
Patrice... she's the one
from the Black Student Union,

541
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:29,089
the group that brought in Ture?

542
00:27:29,091 --> 00:27:30,557
Kwame Ture. Correct, sir.

543
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,125
Getting pretty chummy
with her, huh?

544
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,661
No, just doing my job, Chief.
Undercover.

545
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:37,097
Let's just make sure it ain't
under the cover of the sheets.

546
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:39,232
I would never jeopardize
a case, sir.

547
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:40,967
He doesn't know what he'd do.

548
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:42,402
You're new.

549
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:43,970
You guys sit tight.

550
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,240
Ron, come with me.

551
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:50,043
Ron, I'm transferring you
to Intelligence.

552
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:52,346
What will I be doing there?

553
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:54,448
Intelligence.

554
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,418
Against my better judgment.

555
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,053
Five, four, three,

556
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,155
two, one.

557
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:03,892
Swish!

558
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:10,931
Police department.

559
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:12,968
He is at lunch.

560
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:16,605
Excuse me? Yes, yes.

561
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:36,390
You have reached

562
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:38,992
the Colorado Springs chapter
of the Ku Klux Klan.

563
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:40,494
Please leave a message.

564
00:28:40,496 --> 00:28:43,130
And God bless white America.

565
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:46,533
Hello.
This is Ron Stallworth calling.

566
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:50,437
I saw your advertisement in
the <i>Colorado Springs Gazette.</i>

567
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,205
I'm interested in receiving

568
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:54,474
some reading materials
from you.

569
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:58,578
My phone number is 103-9994.

570
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,317
I'm very much looking forward
to you returning my call.

571
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:23,036
Yeah, who's this?

572
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:24,604
Ron Stallworth here.

573
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:27,309
This is Walter
returning your call.

574
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,210
From the Organization.

575
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:31,645
The Organization?

576
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,013
That's right.

577
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:34,950
We appreciate your interest.

578
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:37,352
What's your story?

579
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:43,625
Well, since you asked...

580
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,260
Since you asked,
I hate niggers.

581
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:50,030
- I hate Jews.
- Huh?

582
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:52,032
Spics and Micks.

583
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:54,201
Dagos and Chinks.

584
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:55,703
But my mouth to God's ears,

585
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:57,738
I really hate
those nigger rats.

586
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,774
And anyone else, really,
that doesn't have

587
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:01,776
pure white Aryan blood
running through their veins.

588
00:30:01,778 --> 00:30:04,511
My sister, Pamela,

589
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:07,782
she was just recently accosted
by one of those black coons.

590
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:09,149
Is that so?

591
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:10,450
Yeah.

592
00:30:10,452 --> 00:30:12,753
Every time I think
about that black baboon

593
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:14,287
putting his filthy black hands

594
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:16,456
on her pure-as-
white-driven-snow body...

595
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,792
I mean pure, Walter.

596
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:19,392
She's a saint. She's an angel.

597
00:30:19,394 --> 00:30:21,061
It makes me want to puke.

598
00:30:21,063 --> 00:30:25,065
You are just the kind of guy
that we are looking for.

599
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:27,534
Listen, uh, when can you meet?

600
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,302
How about Friday night
after I get off work?

601
00:30:29,304 --> 00:30:30,337
That's a deal, buddy boy.

602
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:32,072
We'll get right back to you
with the details.

603
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:33,073
Take care, now.

604
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:35,577
God bless white America.

605
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:39,548
Did I just hear you use
your real name?

606
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,449
Oh, motherfucker.

607
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:44,651
Yeah,
motherfucker amateur hour.

608
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:46,353
That's your
real name, right? Isn't...

609
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:48,288
Isn't it Ron Stallworth?
Right, isn't that

610
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,257
- his real name?
- Can't believe he just said that.

611
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:52,158
Well, good luck, Ron,
with your new redneck friends.

612
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:55,095
They want you to join the Klan?

613
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:56,764
They want to meet me first.

614
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:59,266
- They want to meet you?
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:02,335
Yeah, well, you probably
shouldn't go to that meeting.

616
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:03,236
Good call, Sarge.

617
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,307
So you're a crazy
son of a bitch, huh?

618
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:08,174
We'd have to go to Narcotics,

619
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:10,477
meaning we'd have to deal
with Chief Bridges.

620
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:12,379
Yeah, I can't spare the men.

621
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:14,114
Well, I've looked
over the logs, Chief,

622
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:15,783
and it seems
you can spare them.

623
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:18,719
Sergeant Trapp, Ron spoke
to the man on the phone.

624
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:21,354
All right, when they hear
the voice of one of my guys,

625
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:23,123
they're gonna know
the difference.

626
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,457
How so, Chief?

627
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:26,159
You want me
to spell it out for you?

628
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:29,162
They're going to know
the difference

629
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:32,800
between how a white man talks
and a Negro.

630
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:34,634
How exactly
does a black man talk?

631
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:36,202
Okay, Ron, what I think

632
00:31:36,204 --> 00:31:37,838
the chief is trying to say...

633
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,573
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak for myself.

634
00:31:39,575 --> 00:31:40,640
- Thank you, Sarge.
- Sure.

635
00:31:40,642 --> 00:31:42,242
You know what
I'm trying to say.

636
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:44,311
Chief, some of us can speak
King's English.

637
00:31:44,313 --> 00:31:45,813
Others speak jive.

638
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:48,749
Ron Stallworth here
happens to be fluent in both.

639
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:54,654
Okay, Ron, how do you propose
to make this investigation?

640
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:57,825
Well, I've established contact
and created some familiarity

641
00:31:57,827 --> 00:31:59,760
with the Klansman
over the phone.

642
00:31:59,762 --> 00:32:02,162
I'll continue in that role,
but I'll need another officer...

643
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:04,397
surprise, surprise,
a white officer...

644
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,433
to play me
when they meet face-to-face.

645
00:32:06,435 --> 00:32:08,468
See, that's my point exactly.

646
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,570
Chief, black Ron Stallworth
over the phone,

647
00:32:10,572 --> 00:32:11,906
white Ron Stallworth
face-to-face,

648
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:15,241
so there becomes
a combined Ron Stallworth.

649
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:17,344
- Can you do that?
- I believe we can.

650
00:32:17,346 --> 00:32:19,281
With the right white man,
we can do anything.

651
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:23,450
Anything happens
to one of my men,

652
00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:25,652
there won't be two
Ron Stallworths.

653
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,187
There'll be none.

654
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,260
You're late.

655
00:32:34,262 --> 00:32:36,196
Sorry.
It'll never happen again.

656
00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:37,898
Seems like I heard
that one before.

657
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,532
Jimmy, when's the last time

658
00:32:39,534 --> 00:32:40,801
they let a rookie lead
an investigation?

659
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:42,402
Oh, that's right... never.

660
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:44,204
Okay, all right, let's move on.

661
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:46,339
Let's, uh...
let's go to our bio.

662
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,808
Okay. Ron Stallworth.

663
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,542
I do wholesale manufacturing.

664
00:32:49,544 --> 00:32:51,311
- Whereabout?
- Pueblo.

665
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:53,380
- What's that commute like?
- Jimmy, I'm glad you asked.

666
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:54,982
It's a straight shot down I-25.

667
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:56,616
- Hour, tops.
- It's a long ride.

668
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:57,952
What do we listen to?

669
00:32:57,954 --> 00:33:00,587
KWYD, Christian talk
in the morning,

670
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:02,990
although the signal starts
to cut out near Pueblo.

671
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:05,926
On the way back,
I like to turn it to 102.7

672
00:33:05,928 --> 00:33:07,695
to get my Allman Brothers fix.

673
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:10,330
Only I have to change it
every time that British fag,

674
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,332
- David Bowie, pipes on.
- Whoa!

675
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:13,466
I love Bowie.

676
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:14,567
I mean, who doesn't, right?

677
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:16,003
Remember, you have to retain

678
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:17,938
all the information
you share with these guys

679
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,940
so I can be
white Ron Stallworth.

680
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:21,976
Jimmy, I always wanted
to be black.

681
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:23,811
All my heroes were black guys.

682
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:25,345
Willie Mays.

683
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:26,781
Basket catch.

684
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:27,614
Wilt the Stilt.

685
00:33:27,616 --> 00:33:29,416
Record hundred points
in one game.

686
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:30,818
But you know
my absolute favorite?

687
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,619
O.J.

688
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:34,254
- Heisman pose!
- Whew!

689
00:33:34,256 --> 00:33:36,891
- The Juice!
- I love fucking O.J.

690
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:39,626
Orenthal James Simpson.

691
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:41,528
- Bet you didn't know that.
- Of course I did.

692
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,831
We as a Negro people
appreciate your love,

693
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,632
but don't share that love
with these guys.

694
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,600
For you, it's the
fucking Osmonds, right?

695
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:49,502
Hey, I love Marie Osmond.

696
00:33:49,504 --> 00:33:52,006
I get to play you,
but you don't get to play me?

697
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:54,374
- Jimmy, does that sound fair?
- Fair? - Not to me.

698
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:55,642
Now, what else?
Wh-Who are you meeting with?

699
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:58,913
Walter... Breachway.

700
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:01,481
Become his friend.
Let's get invited back.

701
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:02,717
Well, look at you.

702
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:05,019
Okay. Anything else, sir?

703
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:07,054
I'm on the phone with the Klan.

704
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:08,789
You meet with them in person.

705
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:09,857
And?

706
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,929
And you need to try
and sound like my voice.

707
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,629
Oh, boy.

708
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:18,500
All right. Here.

709
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:21,367
Me, too?

710
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:22,635
Yeah. You, too, Jimmy.

711
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:24,304
- Godfather.
- That's right.

712
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:26,674
You wanted to be black,
here's your chance.

713
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:28,943
Lookie here.

714
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:31,511
Some people say
we've got a lot of malice.

715
00:34:31,513 --> 00:34:34,314
Some say it's a lot of nerve.

716
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:35,816
Lookie here.

717
00:34:35,818 --> 00:34:38,318
Some people say
we got a lot of malice.

718
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,387
- Some...
- Come on, come on.

719
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,923
This is life and death here.
Come on.

720
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:44,624
- Oh, is it?
- Come on.

721
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,459
Some say it's
a lot of nerve. Nerve!

722
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,628
- You want me to do this now?
- Please, now.

723
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,463
For all our sakes,
do it now, please.

724
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:52,332
Some say it's a lot of nerve.

725
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:53,968
Let-let it flow, though.
Let it flow.

726
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,536
- I'm flowing.
- Okay. I say we won't quit moving

727
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:58,072
till we get what we deserve.

728
00:34:58,074 --> 00:35:00,674
I say we won't quit moving...

729
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:02,743
until we get what we deserve.

730
00:35:02,745 --> 00:35:04,845
We've been buked,
and we've been scorned.

731
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:06,881
- We've been buke...
- "Buked." Say that.

732
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,949
- What does "buked" mean?
- Disrespected.

733
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:10,517
You've been disrespected, Flip.

734
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,452
- You.
- Why doesn't he just say that?

735
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:14,054
We've been buked,
and we've been scorned.

736
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:15,790
This has got to flow,
from the...

737
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:18,391
We've been treated bad,
talked about.

738
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:19,960
We've been buked.
We've been scorned.

739
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:21,929
- All right, get that shit out.
- We've been treated bad,

740
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:22,997
talked about.

741
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,397
Just as sure as you're born,

742
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:25,866
but just as sure as it take.

743
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:27,101
Just as sure as you're born,

744
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:28,903
but just as sure as it take.

745
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:31,105
Two eyes to make a pair. Huh!

746
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,107
Two eyes to make a pair.

747
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:34,043
Huh!

748
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:36,543
Huh!

749
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:37,978
- Huh!
- Huh!

750
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,412
- Huh! Huh!
- Huh!

751
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:42,116
Brother, we can't quit
till we get our share.

752
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:44,551
Brother, we can't
quit till we get our share.

753
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:45,953
Doesn't make grammatical sense,
but okay.

754
00:35:45,955 --> 00:35:47,154
Say it loud.

755
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:48,655
I'm black, and I'm proud.

756
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:50,390
Say it for O.J., Jimmy.
You, too.

757
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:52,793
Say it loud.
I'm black, and I'm proud.

758
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:53,928
Say it loud.

759
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,863
I'm black, and I'm proud.

760
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:57,430
- That's right. There it is.
- Huh!

761
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:59,166
I believed you.

762
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:01,802
Lose that Jewish necklace
around your neck.

763
00:36:01,804 --> 00:36:03,103
Jimmy, it's not
a Jewish necklace.

764
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:04,571
It's a Star of David.

765
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:06,472
Okay.

766
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:08,474
Flip, you're Jewish?

767
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:10,079
I don't know. Am I?

768
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:47,715
Ron Stallworth?

769
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:50,617
That's me.

770
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:52,820
- You must be Walter.
- Name's Felix.

771
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:54,788
Well, I was told I'd be meeting
a Walter Breachway.

772
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,025
Change of plans, Mac.

773
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,796
I'm gonna need you
to hop in the truck.

774
00:37:02,798 --> 00:37:05,032
- Okay, well, how about I just follow you in my...
- No can do.

775
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:07,034
You come with me.

776
00:37:07,036 --> 00:37:08,802
Security.

777
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:10,873
I'll drive you back.

778
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:19,715
Come on, let's roll.

779
00:37:22,852 --> 00:37:24,818
♪ Boarded the Greyhound ♪

780
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,189
♪ Alabama bound ♪

781
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,795
♪ I don't stop... ♪

782
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:39,632
You for the white race, Ron?

783
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:41,035
Oh, hell yeah.

784
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:44,004
Been having trouble lately
with these local niggers.

785
00:37:44,006 --> 00:37:45,638
Ah, since the Civil War,

786
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,840
it's always trouble
with niggers.

787
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:50,711
Walter said something
about your sister.

788
00:37:50,713 --> 00:37:51,946
Makes me sick.

789
00:37:51,948 --> 00:37:53,247
What are they saying?
They-they saying

790
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:54,582
where they're going?

791
00:37:56,218 --> 00:37:59,753
But it's also,
you know, camaraderie

792
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:01,554
I'm looking for with the Klan.

793
00:38:01,556 --> 00:38:03,023
What the fuck did you say?

794
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:05,695
- Camaraderie?
- No, the other word.

795
00:38:06,796 --> 00:38:07,895
The Klan?

796
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:09,830
Not "the Klan."

797
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:12,032
It's "the Organization."

798
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:13,934
The Invisible Empire
has managed

799
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:16,636
to stay invisible for a reason.

800
00:38:16,638 --> 00:38:19,807
Do not ever use that word.

801
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:21,541
You understand?

802
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:23,043
Hey, I over-stand.

803
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:24,211
Right. You got it.

804
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:25,647
The Organization.

805
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:33,954
Check this shit out.

806
00:38:33,956 --> 00:38:35,155
You're never
gonna believe this.

807
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:36,323
What?

808
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:38,761
A fucking jig on our bumper.

809
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,965
- Ron, he sees us. Back off.
- Damn!

810
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:48,836
Let's get ready.

811
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:50,037
Look under your seat.

812
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:51,772
- Yeah.
- What?

813
00:38:51,774 --> 00:38:53,743
Pull it out.

814
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,579
Load 'er up.

815
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:02,118
Put two in the chamber.

816
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:05,021
Come on, load it up.

817
00:39:06,122 --> 00:39:08,057
Come on, load it.

818
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:11,859
Don't be messing with us.

819
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:14,228
The Organization.

820
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,730
Not so fast, buddy boy.

821
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:18,065
Hold your horses.

822
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:20,635
♪ Freedom ride. ♪

823
00:39:23,638 --> 00:39:28,342
♪ We are... ♪

824
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:30,044
Mmm.

825
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:31,644
Ron, glad you could make it.

826
00:39:31,646 --> 00:39:33,113
Walter Breachway,
chapter president.

827
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:34,915
Ron Stallworth. I appreciate
you inviting me out.

828
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,216
Absolutely.
I've been impressed

829
00:39:36,218 --> 00:39:38,318
with our conversations
over the phone.

830
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,920
I think you have a lot
of fine ideas

831
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:41,055
that could really help
the cause.

832
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:42,189
Well, I meant
every word I said.

833
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:44,758
You know, I've had my own share
of run-ins with niggers.

834
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,995
Matter of fact, it's what
led me to the Organization.

835
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:50,264
- Is that right?
- Oh, it's become my salvation.

836
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:52,032
See, I was, uh...

837
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:54,634
shot and wounded
by a couple niggers.

838
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:57,670
Then my wife was savagely raped
by a whole pack of 'em.

839
00:39:57,672 --> 00:39:59,672
- God.
- That's right, and not a one of them went to jail.

840
00:39:59,674 --> 00:40:00,674
Huh.

841
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:02,743
Tell you what.

842
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:04,711
They're taking over.

843
00:40:04,713 --> 00:40:07,014
Hell, it's all you see
on TV anymore.

844
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:08,182
Niggers selling soap.

845
00:40:08,184 --> 00:40:09,316
Niggers selling toothpaste.

846
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:10,717
Niggers selling automobiles.

847
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,718
Everywhere you look,

848
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,187
it's niggers, niggers, niggers.

849
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:14,421
Yeah, wasn't long ago

850
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:16,690
them sumbitches
wasn't on no TV.

851
00:40:16,692 --> 00:40:19,126
You're forgetting about
Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima.

852
00:40:19,128 --> 00:40:20,727
Oh, dang.

853
00:40:20,729 --> 00:40:23,063
I kind of like them niggers.

854
00:40:23,065 --> 00:40:26,033
Rice and pancakes.

855
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:28,202
Hey, uh, my name's Ivanhoe,
by the way.

856
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:29,303
Hey. Ron.

857
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:32,372
Hey, all you get now
is how we gotta cater to them.

858
00:40:32,374 --> 00:40:34,174
Now, watch your mouth. Yeah.

859
00:40:34,176 --> 00:40:36,343
Don't say this. Don't say that.

860
00:40:36,345 --> 00:40:37,845
Be nice.

861
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:39,279
Hell, they ain't even
colored no more.

862
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:40,981
Negroes. Blacks.

863
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:43,183
- Afro-Americans now.
- Yeah, fuck it.

864
00:40:43,185 --> 00:40:45,953
Just call them fucking niggers.
Make it fucking simple.

865
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:47,821
- Niggers.
- Niggers.

866
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:48,689
That's the right idea.

867
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:50,324
I've been saying
this stuff for years.

868
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:51,258
Well, you ain't the only one.

869
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,127
It's good to know
someone else gets it.

870
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:55,829
So, what kind of stuff
you guys do?

871
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,431
What kind of stuff we do?

872
00:40:57,433 --> 00:41:00,767
We, uh... uh, cross burnings

873
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:04,371
and marches and stuff
so people don't fuck with us.

874
00:41:04,373 --> 00:41:06,974
I'm tired of niggers
fucking with me.

875
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:08,709
Well, then you come
to the right place.

876
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:10,210
Nobody fucks with us.

877
00:41:10,212 --> 00:41:12,982
Now, how much you know
about the history?

878
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:15,816
Some. I could know more.

879
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:17,151
We will teach you.

880
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:19,987
Yeah, this is fixing
to be a big year for us.

881
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:21,790
How so?

882
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:28,762
- Boom!
- All right.

883
00:41:28,764 --> 00:41:29,897
We're gonna make fireworks,
aren't we?

884
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:31,832
All right, all right, Ivanhoe,
shut your dumb mouth.

885
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,767
Ivan, shut the fuck up.

886
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:35,269
- Burnt ends.
- All right, all right.

887
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:37,204
That's enough.
Shut your dumb mouth.

888
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:38,939
Sorry about him.
He drinks too much.

889
00:41:38,941 --> 00:41:40,774
Doesn't know what he's saying.

890
00:41:40,776 --> 00:41:42,843
Just to be clear, the, uh...

891
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:44,945
the Organization
is strictly nonviolent.

892
00:41:44,947 --> 00:41:47,414
Oh, nonviolent
like that nigger,

893
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,449
that dead nigger,
Martin Luther Coon.

894
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:50,817
Yeah, gotcha.

895
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:53,153
Ron? You mind coming with me?

896
00:41:53,155 --> 00:41:54,421
Yeah, where to?

897
00:41:54,423 --> 00:41:56,125
You undercover or something?

898
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,762
- You ask too many questions.
- All right.

899
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:02,296
Be friendly, now.

900
00:42:02,298 --> 00:42:05,032
This is family. All right?

901
00:42:05,034 --> 00:42:06,900
Let's go.

902
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:09,870
Congrats.
You passed the mustard.

903
00:42:09,872 --> 00:42:12,773
How about we go and get that
membership process started?

904
00:42:12,775 --> 00:42:14,875
- That's it?
- That's it.

905
00:42:14,877 --> 00:42:16,276
Uh, have a seat.

906
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:18,912
Go ahead and, uh,
fill these out.

907
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:20,280
Send 'em to the national
headquarters.

908
00:42:20,282 --> 00:42:22,783
Now, once they send you
your membership card,

909
00:42:22,785 --> 00:42:26,253
you'll be able to participate
in all our programs.

910
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:27,554
Alcoa can't wait.

911
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:30,123
I love those commercials.

912
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,892
Imperial tax
to become a member:

913
00:42:31,894 --> 00:42:34,061
ten dollars for the year,
$15 chapter fee.

914
00:42:34,063 --> 00:42:35,562
Robes and hoods
are not included.

915
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:36,863
That's extra.

916
00:42:36,865 --> 00:42:38,165
Fucking inflation.

917
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:39,566
I can't thank
you brothers enough.

918
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:41,235
This means a lot to me.

919
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:42,569
Pleasure's all ours.

920
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:45,205
You're not a Jew, right?
Jews killed Christ.

921
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:47,307
Are you trying to offend me?

922
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:48,477
Protocol.

923
00:42:53,182 --> 00:42:55,115
Course I'm no stinkin' kike.

924
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:57,384
All right, look,
we gotta ask it, is all.

925
00:42:57,386 --> 00:43:00,254
But he's not a Jew, all right?
Satisfied?

926
00:43:00,256 --> 00:43:02,256
S-Smells kosher to me.

927
00:43:02,258 --> 00:43:03,290
Stop fucking around.

928
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:04,558
I fuck straight.

929
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,126
- Who you fucking?
- Double D!

930
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:08,161
All right, both of you,
give the man some space.

931
00:43:08,163 --> 00:43:09,596
Jesus Christ.
Let him breathe a little.

932
00:43:09,598 --> 00:43:10,964
Ron, let me buy you a beer.

933
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:11,965
- Okay.
- Come on.

934
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:14,034
Sorry about these guys.
They're a little, uh,

935
00:43:14,036 --> 00:43:16,036
too friendly sometimes.

936
00:43:16,038 --> 00:43:17,471
They just get excited.

937
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:20,073
Yeah.

938
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:21,341
What kind of beer you like?

939
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:22,509
Coors, if you got it.

940
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:25,879
That was interesting.

941
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:29,383
Not exactly
the Beverly Hillbillies.

942
00:43:29,385 --> 00:43:30,917
They liked you.

943
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:33,220
Except for that Felix guy.

944
00:43:33,222 --> 00:43:35,355
Do not ride his bumper
like that.

945
00:43:35,357 --> 00:43:36,857
Two car lengths.

946
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:38,592
You think he got
a good look at my face?

947
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:40,227
Probably.

948
00:43:40,229 --> 00:43:42,298
You get the papers?

949
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:45,432
They want you to join.

950
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:47,067
Uh, technically,
they want you to join.

951
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:48,635
Yeah.

952
00:43:48,637 --> 00:43:51,238
Yeah, they want a black man
to join the Ku Klux Klan.

953
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,606
I'd say that's
mission impossible.

954
00:43:52,608 --> 00:43:54,341
Double success.

955
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:55,509
We're in!

956
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:57,878
Slow down, brother.
Slow down.

957
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,448
And exactly how much should we
be worried about them?

958
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,283
Enough that we'd like
to dig deeper.

959
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:06,053
One of the men discussed plans
for a possible attack, so...

960
00:44:06,055 --> 00:44:08,522
I wouldn't give him
that much credit.

961
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,090
These guys like to boast.

962
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:11,091
What kind of attack?

963
00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:12,893
Uh, Ivan...

964
00:44:12,895 --> 00:44:15,462
Ivanhoe said "boom," mentioned
something about fireworks.

965
00:44:15,464 --> 00:44:16,897
But personally,
I didn't buy it.

966
00:44:16,899 --> 00:44:18,598
I-I doubt they're even capable.

967
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,201
Either way, at this point,
we're looking for full support

968
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:22,602
from the department
on this, Sarge.

969
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:24,404
Let's move on
with the investigation.

970
00:44:24,406 --> 00:44:26,940
Let's try to find out if
they are capable of anything.

971
00:44:26,942 --> 00:44:28,575
Okay.

972
00:44:28,577 --> 00:44:29,711
- Thank you, Sarge.
- You got it.

973
00:44:32,247 --> 00:44:35,683
When we dropped Brother Kwame
off at the airport,

974
00:44:35,685 --> 00:44:38,618
he told me
that the Black Power movement

975
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,121
needed strong sisters like me
to lead the fight

976
00:44:41,123 --> 00:44:42,923
against capitalist oppression

977
00:44:42,925 --> 00:44:45,359
and the politicians and pigs
who perpetuate it.

978
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:48,495
His words almost made that
whole pig nightmare worthwhile.

979
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:53,100
♪ And there's a girl
in this harbor town ♪

980
00:44:53,102 --> 00:44:56,269
♪ And she works
layin' whiskey down... ♪

981
00:44:56,271 --> 00:44:58,305
What's wrong?

982
00:44:58,307 --> 00:44:59,639
What do you mean?

983
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:01,910
What's wrong?

984
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:06,279
I don't really use that word.

985
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:08,348
What word?

986
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,616
"Pigs."

987
00:45:09,618 --> 00:45:11,284
Well, what else
would you call them?

988
00:45:11,286 --> 00:45:13,086
Cops.

989
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,988
Police.

990
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,356
Officers.

991
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:18,125
A bunch of racist cops
on a power trip.

992
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:20,127
So, you think all cops
are racist?

993
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:21,661
It only takes one
to pull a trigger

994
00:45:21,663 --> 00:45:23,363
on an innocent sister
or brother.

995
00:45:23,365 --> 00:45:25,300
Hmm.

996
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:30,504
Why were you
at Brother Kwame's speech?

997
00:45:30,506 --> 00:45:32,406
- He's got some good ideas.
- Mm-hmm.

998
00:45:32,408 --> 00:45:35,075
I don't agree with all of them,
but he's a smart brother,

999
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:36,410
definitely worth hearing.

1000
00:45:36,412 --> 00:45:39,146
Are you down for the liberation
of black people?

1001
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:40,981
Do we always have
to talk politics?

1002
00:45:40,983 --> 00:45:43,250
What's more important?

1003
00:45:43,252 --> 00:45:45,185
Do you ever take time off?

1004
00:45:45,187 --> 00:45:48,555
No. It's a lifetime job.

1005
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:51,158
Sister Angela Davis,
most righteous sister,

1006
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,627
can we please spend
some quality time together?

1007
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:56,196
And what did you say
your J-O-B is?

1008
00:45:56,198 --> 00:45:57,765
Sister Kathleen Cleaver,
I didn't.

1009
00:45:57,767 --> 00:45:58,701
Are you a pig?

1010
00:46:00,002 --> 00:46:01,168
Excuse me?

1011
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,669
Are you a pig?

1012
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:04,504
You mean a cop?

1013
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:05,672
Are you a cop?

1014
00:46:05,674 --> 00:46:06,774
No.

1015
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:08,308
I'm in construction.

1016
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,578
But more importantly,
I'm a black man

1017
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,181
who wants to get to know
a strong,

1018
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:17,184
intelligent, beautiful sister.

1019
00:46:17,186 --> 00:46:20,721
The very one
I'm looking at right now.

1020
00:46:20,723 --> 00:46:24,591
♪ But he had always
told the truth ♪

1021
00:46:24,593 --> 00:46:27,728
♪ Lord, he was
an honest man... ♪

1022
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,396
You dig?

1023
00:46:29,398 --> 00:46:31,431
Sure enough.

1024
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:33,099
That's what I'm talking about.
Power to the people.

1025
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:34,702
All power to all the people.

1026
00:46:34,704 --> 00:46:37,070
- That's right, sister.
- Right on, right on.

1027
00:46:39,441 --> 00:46:41,376
- This is Walter.
- Ron here.

1028
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,511
This is Ron?

1029
00:46:44,513 --> 00:46:47,715
Sorry, your voice sounds
different over the phone.

1030
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:49,316
Uh...

1031
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:51,651
My allergies...
allergies acting up again.

1032
00:46:51,653 --> 00:46:53,487
I get those all the time.

1033
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:55,188
Listen, wanted to tell you

1034
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,123
that it was a real pleasure
to have you swing by.

1035
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,059
I think the brothers
really took a liking to you.

1036
00:46:59,061 --> 00:47:01,094
I'm honored.

1037
00:47:01,096 --> 00:47:03,129
If you're free Saturday,
why don't you swing by Felix's.

1038
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:05,198
You can meet the rest
of the brotherhood, hmm?

1039
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,603
- Sounds good to me.
- Well, I will see you then.

1040
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:12,305
I've got a friend.

1041
00:47:12,307 --> 00:47:15,509
He, uh, keeps up
with these groups.

1042
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:17,277
He says they're moving away

1043
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:20,180
from the old violent,
racist style.

1044
00:47:20,182 --> 00:47:22,382
So, that's what Duke
is peddling now.

1045
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,819
It's, uh, becoming mainstream.

1046
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:27,087
- Duke?
- David Duke.

1047
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:29,422
Current Grand Wizard
of the Klan.

1048
00:47:29,424 --> 00:47:31,224
But he's always in
a three-piece suit,

1049
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:34,160
never seen in a hood
or robe in public,

1050
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:36,162
and he now goes by
"national director."

1051
00:47:36,164 --> 00:47:39,702
So he's clearly got his sights
on higher office.

1052
00:47:41,103 --> 00:47:42,569
- Politics? How so?
- Yeah.

1053
00:47:42,571 --> 00:47:45,572
Think it's another way
to sell hate.

1054
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:47,775
- Keep going.
- Think about it.

1055
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:49,710
Affirmative action,
immigration,

1056
00:47:49,712 --> 00:47:52,245
- crime, tax reform.
- Hmm.

1057
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:55,148
He says no one wants
to be called a bigot anymore.

1058
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,417
I guess Archie Bunker
made that too uncool.

1059
00:47:57,419 --> 00:48:00,554
So the idea is,
under all these issues,

1060
00:48:00,556 --> 00:48:03,557
everyday Americans
can accept it,

1061
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,360
support it,
until eventually, one day,

1062
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:11,498
he gets somebody in the
White House that embodies it.

1063
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,836
Sarge...

1064
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,737
Come on.

1065
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:20,373
America would never elect
somebody like David Duke

1066
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:23,312
president of
the United States of America.

1067
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:28,281
Coming from a black man,
that's pretty naive.

1068
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,385
Why don't you wake up?

1069
00:49:01,684 --> 00:49:03,450
Ron, hi.

1070
00:49:03,452 --> 00:49:04,618
I'm Connie, Felix's wife.

1071
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,252
It's so nice to meet you.

1072
00:49:06,254 --> 00:49:07,322
Oh!

1073
00:49:08,557 --> 00:49:09,724
- Want to come right in?
- Sure.

1074
00:49:09,726 --> 00:49:12,425
- Do you mind if I, uh, smoke in there?
- Oh, not at all.

1075
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:13,928
I'm telling you,
a war's a-comin'.

1076
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,830
That'll be the end
of the purified white race

1077
00:49:15,832 --> 00:49:17,430
- as we know it.
- They're right inside.

1078
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:18,699
Just make yourself
right at home.

1079
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:20,968
It's time we go
on the offensive.

1080
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,369
We gotta make sure
that everybody...

1081
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:23,704
Hey, man.

1082
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:25,740
- Hello. Hey, fellas.
- Welcome. Welcome.

1083
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:27,307
This is Ron, everybody.

1084
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:28,375
- Mr. Stallworth.
- All right.

1085
00:49:28,377 --> 00:49:29,810
- That's, uh, Mike.
- Hey, Mike. How are you? Ron.

1086
00:49:29,812 --> 00:49:30,978
- Scott in the back.
- Ron. How are you.

1087
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,979
- Jesup.
- Hey. How are you?

1088
00:49:31,981 --> 00:49:33,446
Ron, why don't you have a seat.

1089
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:34,447
Sorry to interrupt,

1090
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:36,249
but I brought some cheese dip
and crackers.

1091
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:37,417
Would you like some?

1092
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:38,886
- Thanks, honey.
- Thank you.

1093
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:40,955
- Walter?
- Make 'em remember

1094
00:49:40,957 --> 00:49:43,991
who we are
and what we stand for.

1095
00:49:43,993 --> 00:49:46,559
We are the Organization.

1096
00:49:46,561 --> 00:49:48,796
- We have to...
- Oh, oh, oh! I read something in <i>The Gazette</i>

1097
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:50,898
that this nigger
named Carmichael held a rally

1098
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,700
and that some college
nigger girl

1099
00:49:52,702 --> 00:49:56,403
from the Baboon Student Union
was attacking our police.

1100
00:49:56,405 --> 00:49:57,938
I mean, this girl is dangerous.

1101
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,606
She's like that Commie,
Angela Davis.

1102
00:49:59,608 --> 00:50:02,609
And I just... I think we should
shut her mouth.

1103
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:04,745
Here.

1104
00:50:04,747 --> 00:50:05,980
I cut the article.

1105
00:50:05,982 --> 00:50:07,382
That'll be all.

1106
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,455
Love you, sweetie.

1107
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:19,392
Someday,

1108
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:21,561
you're going to need me
to do something for you.

1109
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:22,697
Just wait and see.

1110
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:26,299
And I will be right in here.

1111
00:50:26,301 --> 00:50:27,500
Why don't we, uh...

1112
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:28,869
...get back to our bread
and butter.

1113
00:50:28,871 --> 00:50:30,537
Let's talk about
the next cross burning,

1114
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:32,707
which, Ron, you'll be
lucky enough to attend

1115
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:33,874
if your membership
comes in time.

1116
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:34,875
It'll be a tremendous honor.

1117
00:50:34,877 --> 00:50:36,543
- The highest hills get the most eyes.
- Yeah.

1118
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:38,344
Prove you can read.

1119
00:50:38,346 --> 00:50:39,914
"Friday night last week,

1120
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:42,282
the Colorado College
Black Student Union..."

1121
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:43,818
Hey, Ron.

1122
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,618
I gotta show you something.

1123
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,588
"...hosted a controversial talk
featuring Stokely Carmichael

1124
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,624
at Bell's Nightingale
nightclub."

1125
00:50:51,626 --> 00:50:53,593
"Black Student Union."

1126
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:55,830
"Black Student..."
That go together to you?

1127
00:50:55,832 --> 00:50:57,530
That sounds
fucking weird to me.

1128
00:50:59,702 --> 00:51:01,434
Lookie here.

1129
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:02,803
Wow.

1130
00:51:02,805 --> 00:51:05,706
This is really something.

1131
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:08,441
Here's my favorite.

1132
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:10,312
12-gauge.

1133
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:12,980
I call this the Jew Killer.

1134
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:14,915
I call it
a Remington Model 1900.

1135
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:16,018
Indeed, it is.

1136
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:18,518
Okay.

1137
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,754
We about done here?

1138
00:51:19,756 --> 00:51:21,654
We got a few more items
on the, uh...

1139
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:23,456
Not just yet.

1140
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:24,992
Gotta make sure
there's no Jew in him.

1141
00:51:24,994 --> 00:51:26,559
All right, now you're just
being offensive.

1142
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:28,394
Okay?
We're talking about someone

1143
00:51:28,396 --> 00:51:30,097
who's gonna be our brother
in a few months.

1144
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:31,999
You see a Star of David
around his neck?

1145
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,934
Is there a yarmulke
on Ron's head? Hmm?

1146
00:51:33,936 --> 00:51:35,936
Just protocol.

1147
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:38,939
My house, my rules.

1148
00:51:38,941 --> 00:51:40,875
This way.

1149
00:51:40,877 --> 00:51:42,779
Where we going now?

1150
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:46,615
I gotta show you something.

1151
00:51:47,784 --> 00:51:49,016
Tough titty.

1152
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:50,517
It's not necessary, Felix.

1153
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:52,420
This is how we lose recruits.

1154
00:51:54,957 --> 00:51:57,760
You are going to take
this lie detector test.

1155
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:00,895
- Take a seat.
- What is this?

1156
00:52:00,897 --> 00:52:02,495
Is this your Jew den?

1157
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:04,364
Is this where you make
your candles,

1158
00:52:04,366 --> 00:52:06,133
you know, and your lampshades?

1159
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:08,668
Nah, you're gonna take
this lie detector test.

1160
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,037
Open the damn door.

1161
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:11,839
This is some lame bullshit.

1162
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:13,707
Lame or not, you're taking

1163
00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:15,709
this Jew lie detector test.

1164
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:17,812
- Sit down.
- Okay, Felix.

1165
00:52:17,814 --> 00:52:19,646
Out of respect
for this Organization,

1166
00:52:19,648 --> 00:52:21,548
I'll play along with your
little <i>Get Smart</i> bullshit,

1167
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,917
but I'm no fucking Jew.

1168
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:23,920
Sit down.

1169
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:30,758
Ask anybody.

1170
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,761
They'll say
I'm a real friendly guy.

1171
00:52:33,763 --> 00:52:37,497
Thing is, I'm only friendly
to my friends.

1172
00:52:37,499 --> 00:52:39,601
Not Jew friendly.

1173
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:43,037
Damn sure not nigger friendly.

1174
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:45,005
- Me, neither.
- Know what I think?

1175
00:52:45,007 --> 00:52:47,440
- You think?
- Oh, yeah, I think.

1176
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:48,541
What do you think about?

1177
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:51,045
This Holocaust stuff...

1178
00:52:51,047 --> 00:52:52,547
never happened.

1179
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:56,884
That's the biggest
Jewish conspiracy ever.

1180
00:52:56,886 --> 00:52:59,552
Eight million Jews killed?

1181
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:01,155
Concentration camps?

1182
00:53:01,157 --> 00:53:03,757
Never happened.

1183
00:53:03,759 --> 00:53:05,059
Where's the proof?

1184
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:06,526
Are you high?

1185
00:53:06,528 --> 00:53:07,962
I don't get high.

1186
00:53:07,964 --> 00:53:09,730
I drink.

1187
00:53:09,732 --> 00:53:11,464
'Cause I'd say
the Holocaust is one of

1188
00:53:11,466 --> 00:53:13,533
the most beautiful things
I've ever seen.

1189
00:53:13,535 --> 00:53:15,202
It just makes sense to me.

1190
00:53:15,204 --> 00:53:18,571
You have a whole race
of leeches

1191
00:53:18,573 --> 00:53:20,506
that you have to get rid of.

1192
00:53:20,508 --> 00:53:22,209
So, what do you do?
You starve 'em,

1193
00:53:22,211 --> 00:53:23,978
you burn 'em,
you get rid of 'em.

1194
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,146
It's like weeding out roots
for the better people.

1195
00:53:26,148 --> 00:53:27,513
Haven't you seen the footage?

1196
00:53:27,515 --> 00:53:28,782
That's fake.

1197
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:30,885
Jews run Hollywood.

1198
00:53:30,887 --> 00:53:31,919
Fucking hell.

1199
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:33,586
Let me see your dick.

1200
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:34,722
You gonna shoot me?

1201
00:53:34,724 --> 00:53:37,024
- Put that gun away.
- Sh...

1202
00:53:37,026 --> 00:53:39,793
I hear you Jews do something
funny with your dicks.

1203
00:53:39,795 --> 00:53:41,896
Some weird Jew shit.

1204
00:53:41,898 --> 00:53:43,998
Is your dick circumstanced?

1205
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,232
Oh, is that what this is about?

1206
00:53:45,234 --> 00:53:46,967
You're trying to see
my big Jew dick,

1207
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:47,968
you fucking faggot.

1208
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,008
Who you calling
a fucking faggot, Jew faggot?

1209
00:53:58,247 --> 00:54:01,581
Now, put that fucking strap
on your arm.

1210
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,753
Put it on your arm!

1211
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,125
- Felix!
- Connie, what's wrong?

1212
00:54:11,127 --> 00:54:13,559
Felix! Felix!

1213
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:15,963
- Connie! Connie, what's wrong?
- Felix! Felix!

1214
00:54:15,965 --> 00:54:19,099
- Connie!
- There's a black lawn jockey on our green lawn!

1215
00:54:19,101 --> 00:54:20,566
Felix!

1216
00:54:20,568 --> 00:54:22,036
I'm coming to you, honey!

1217
00:54:22,038 --> 00:54:23,871
- Shit, shit.
- Felix!

1218
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,843
Kill that son of a bitch!

1219
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:34,682
Yeah, keep driving,
you black spear chucker,

1220
00:54:34,684 --> 00:54:36,684
- piece of shit nigger!
- That son of a bitch!

1221
00:54:36,686 --> 00:54:38,719
Fucked up the window, man.

1222
00:54:38,721 --> 00:54:40,854
Still want me to take
your Jew detector test?

1223
00:54:40,856 --> 00:54:42,856
Everybody back in the house!

1224
00:54:42,858 --> 00:54:44,725
Back in the house now!

1225
00:54:44,727 --> 00:54:46,927
- Shit.
- Connie, you okay?

1226
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:48,628
You okay? Back in the house.

1227
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:49,964
That's why
we gotta get stronger.

1228
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:51,265
That's some bullshit!

1229
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:53,100
Back in the house, honey.

1230
00:54:53,102 --> 00:54:55,135
That's what I've been
telling all you boys.

1231
00:54:57,006 --> 00:54:58,238
We need more guns!

1232
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,773
<i>Lie detector?</i>

1233
00:54:59,775 --> 00:55:01,041
Shots fired?

1234
00:55:01,043 --> 00:55:03,944
You fucking kidding me?

1235
00:55:03,946 --> 00:55:05,948
It's a goddamn clusterfuck.

1236
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:10,616
You dickheads
are fucking with me.

1237
00:55:10,618 --> 00:55:12,753
You're jerking my chain.
You're jerking my chain.

1238
00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:14,154
I'm getting a reach-around
from the chief.

1239
00:55:14,156 --> 00:55:16,290
It's a big fucking circle jerk!

1240
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:17,858
- That's funny?
- No, sir.

1241
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,659
'Cause if Bridges hears
about this,

1242
00:55:19,661 --> 00:55:21,195
this whole fucking operation's
going to be closed down.

1243
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:22,730
Yeah, that's funny.

1244
00:55:22,732 --> 00:55:25,032
And I'm going to be
a fucking school crossing guard

1245
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:27,735
in fucking the ghetto
of Five Points!

1246
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:29,671
I mean, is he gonna hear
about it, Sarge?

1247
00:55:33,175 --> 00:55:34,977
Cocksuckers.

1248
00:55:38,948 --> 00:55:40,247
Hear about what?

1249
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:41,915
Hey, guys.

1250
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:43,717
Charles, can you
give us five, please?

1251
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:44,720
Sure.

1252
00:55:49,925 --> 00:55:51,859
I didn't want to say it
with Trapp,

1253
00:55:51,861 --> 00:55:53,994
but that peckerwood
had a gun in my face,

1254
00:55:53,996 --> 00:55:56,964
and he was an ass hair away
from pulling the trigger.

1255
00:55:56,966 --> 00:55:58,866
- And he didn't.
- But he could have.

1256
00:55:58,868 --> 00:56:00,768
And then I would have
been dead.

1257
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,668
For what?

1258
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,172
Stopping some jerk-offs
from playing dress-up?

1259
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:07,074
- Flip, it's intel.
- Well, I'm not risking my life

1260
00:56:07,076 --> 00:56:08,308
to prevent some rednecks

1261
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,943
from lighting
a couple sticks on fire.

1262
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:12,146
This is the job.
What's your problem?

1263
00:56:12,148 --> 00:56:13,280
That's my problem.

1264
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:14,782
For you, it's a crusade.

1265
00:56:14,784 --> 00:56:16,350
For me, it's a job.

1266
00:56:16,352 --> 00:56:18,118
It's not personal,
nor should it be.

1267
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,319
Why haven't you bought
into this?

1268
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:20,687
Why should I?

1269
00:56:20,689 --> 00:56:22,156
Because you're Jewish, brother.

1270
00:56:22,158 --> 00:56:24,624
The so-called chosen people.

1271
00:56:24,626 --> 00:56:26,760
You've been passing for a WASP.

1272
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:30,132
White Anglo-Saxon Protestant,
cherry pie, hot dog, white boy.

1273
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:34,334
Mmm. It's what some
light-skinned black folks do.

1274
00:56:34,336 --> 00:56:36,236
They pass for white.

1275
00:56:36,238 --> 00:56:38,138
Doesn't that hatred you've been
hearing the Klan say...

1276
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,639
doesn't that piss you off?

1277
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:41,675
- Course it does.
- Then why you acting like

1278
00:56:41,677 --> 00:56:43,377
you ain't got skin
in the game, brother?

1279
00:56:43,379 --> 00:56:45,580
Rookie,
that's my fucking business.

1280
00:56:46,682 --> 00:56:48,215
It's our business.

1281
00:56:48,217 --> 00:56:50,350
Now, I'm going to get you
your membership card

1282
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:52,319
so you can go
to the cross burning

1283
00:56:52,321 --> 00:56:54,890
- and get in deeper with these guys.
- Okay.

1284
00:57:01,297 --> 00:57:03,997
Right, partner?

1285
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,733
Wake up, white man.
The Negro wants your

1286
00:57:06,735 --> 00:57:08,335
- white woman and your job.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. Let me...

1287
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:10,237
The Jew wants your money, and this you...

1288
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:11,805
Sorry, who am I talking to?

1289
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,207
This is Ron Stallworth calling

1290
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:14,675
from Colorado Springs,
Colorado.

1291
00:57:14,677 --> 00:57:16,076
How are you today, sir?

1292
00:57:16,078 --> 00:57:18,879
I'm quite well. Thank you.
Uh, what can I do you for?

1293
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:20,414
I-I desperately want
to participate

1294
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:22,216
in my chapter's
honorary events,

1295
00:57:22,218 --> 00:57:24,351
but I can't until I receive
my membership card.

1296
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:26,286
Of course that's something
I can help you with.

1297
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:28,455
Great.
Um, who am I speaking with?

1298
00:57:28,457 --> 00:57:29,391
This is David Duke.

1299
00:57:31,327 --> 00:57:34,027
Did you just say your name
was David Duke?

1300
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:35,362
Last time I checked.

1301
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:37,097
Grand Wizard
of the Ku Klux Klan?

1302
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:38,866
That-that David Duke?

1303
00:57:38,868 --> 00:57:41,669
Yes, that Grand Wizard
and national director, yeah.

1304
00:57:42,805 --> 00:57:44,872
National director, too, huh?

1305
00:57:44,874 --> 00:57:47,007
Yes, you're darn tootin'.

1306
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,475
That's amazing.

1307
00:57:48,477 --> 00:57:50,978
I'm honored to be speaking
with you, sir.

1308
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,180
I'm not afraid to say it.

1309
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:57,184
I consider you
a true white American hero.

1310
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:59,119
Is there any other kind?

1311
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:01,054
No, sir.

1312
00:58:01,056 --> 00:58:04,224
I'm just happy to be talking
to a true white American.

1313
00:58:04,226 --> 00:58:05,993
Amen.

1314
00:58:05,995 --> 00:58:07,895
It seems like there's less
and less of us

1315
00:58:07,897 --> 00:58:09,062
out there these days.

1316
00:58:09,064 --> 00:58:10,464
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1317
00:58:10,466 --> 00:58:12,966
Now, about that
membership card...

1318
00:58:12,968 --> 00:58:15,302
Yeah, Ron, I understand
the situation.

1319
00:58:15,304 --> 00:58:17,938
Uh, we've had some
administrative problems here.

1320
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,340
It's caused a little bit
of a backlog.

1321
00:58:20,342 --> 00:58:22,943
Tell you what,
I'm gonna see to it personally

1322
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:24,945
that your membership card
is processed,

1323
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:26,413
approved and sent out today.

1324
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:27,748
How's that sound?

1325
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,049
Thank you, sir.

1326
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:31,351
I can't express to you
how much this means to me.

1327
00:58:31,353 --> 00:58:33,420
Ron, please.
Pleasure's all mine.

1328
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:36,456
Uh, I look forward
to hopefully meeting you

1329
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,458
in person one day, and, uh...

1330
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,294
well, God bless white America.

1331
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:42,164
- God bless white America, sir.
- Okay, take care.

1332
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,109
Excuse me.

1333
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:57,911
Watch where you're going.

1334
00:58:57,913 --> 00:59:00,847
You could get hurt like that,
hot shot.

1335
00:59:06,956 --> 00:59:09,823
The cop that pulled
Kwame Ture over that night...

1336
00:59:09,825 --> 00:59:11,393
was it Landers?

1337
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:15,128
How'd you know?

1338
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:17,097
I can smell 'em
a mile away now.

1339
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:18,832
What, do you got
Smell-O-Vision?

1340
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:20,968
He's been
a bad cop for a long time.

1341
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,303
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1342
00:59:23,305 --> 00:59:25,872
Few years ago,
he shot and killed a black kid.

1343
00:59:25,874 --> 00:59:28,809
- Jesus.
- He said he had a gun, but...

1344
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:30,911
he wasn't that type.

1345
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:32,379
Why do you guys tolerate this?

1346
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:34,414
You want to be the guy
that rats him out?

1347
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:37,050
You want to go
to Landers' office now?

1348
00:59:37,052 --> 00:59:38,885
'Cause we're a family.

1349
00:59:38,887 --> 00:59:41,989
And right or wrong,
we stick together.

1350
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:44,258
That reminds me
of another group.

1351
00:59:57,172 --> 00:59:59,606
- That's a bull's-eye, Ron.
- Ooh.

1352
00:59:59,608 --> 01:00:03,076
You guys heard about
this Hide N Seek room?

1353
01:00:03,078 --> 01:00:05,145
Here, you got a decent bar

1354
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:07,247
turned into a filthy fag bar
overnight.

1355
01:00:07,249 --> 01:00:10,884
Fucking fags everywhere
these days.

1356
01:00:10,886 --> 01:00:12,886
They're trying to colonize.

1357
01:00:12,888 --> 01:00:15,188
You know, first they get
their own bars,

1358
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,259
then they want equal treatment.

1359
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,796
Forget those fags.

1360
01:00:22,564 --> 01:00:23,997
Those guys Army-trained?

1361
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:25,198
A lot of us are, yeah.

1362
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,967
Fort Carson myself.

1363
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:28,502
God, I wish I had a scope
on this thing.

1364
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:29,970
Never seen those Macs before.

1365
01:00:29,972 --> 01:00:31,104
Steve and Jerry?

1366
01:00:31,106 --> 01:00:32,174
Yeah, who are they?

1367
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:36,243
That's classified information.

1368
01:00:36,245 --> 01:00:38,578
Hey, Ron.
I want to see what you can do

1369
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,048
- with my .45.
- All right.

1370
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,949
Yeah, maybe you'll get
that nigger next time.

1371
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:45,087
Ooh.

1372
01:00:46,355 --> 01:00:48,221
50 bucks?

1373
01:00:48,223 --> 01:00:49,589
- You got it.
- I'll take that bet.

1374
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:52,292
Fuck, how about ten?

1375
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:55,395
Oh! Son of a bitch!

1376
01:00:55,397 --> 01:00:56,563
All right, where's my money?

1377
01:00:56,565 --> 01:00:58,165
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

1378
01:00:58,167 --> 01:00:59,299
Not bad. Hot damn.

1379
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:00,534
Well, my old man bought me

1380
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:02,636
a toy cap gun
when I was a kid, and...

1381
01:01:02,638 --> 01:01:04,037
been shooting ever since.

1382
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:05,472
That's a hell of a cap gun.

1383
01:01:05,474 --> 01:01:07,541
- He can shoot.
- All right, let's go. - Damn.

1384
01:01:07,543 --> 01:01:09,109
Pack it up.

1385
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:10,977
Ron Stallworth, motherfucker.

1386
01:01:10,979 --> 01:01:12,346
Hey, Walter.

1387
01:01:12,348 --> 01:01:14,214
Hey, I'm better
than I used to be, right?

1388
01:01:14,216 --> 01:01:16,116
- I'm gooder than I was.
- You're definitely doing

1389
01:01:16,118 --> 01:01:18,518
a little bit better, but I
don't think "gooder" is a word,

1390
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,986
but you're doing real good.

1391
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:53,647
<i>And Bernie Casey.</i>

1392
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:55,048
<i>Ooh, Bernie Casey.</i>

1393
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:56,516
<i>Brother's strong.</i>

1394
01:02:56,518 --> 01:02:58,686
<i>But</i> Cleopatra Jones <i>is the one.</i>

1395
01:02:58,688 --> 01:03:00,253
<i>It's about time
we started seeing</i>

1396
01:03:00,255 --> 01:03:01,789
- <i>a strong sister like that.</i>
- <i>Mmm.</i>

1397
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:05,091
Well, Tamara Dobson
did play a cop, right?

1398
01:03:05,093 --> 01:03:06,593
It's a black exploitation film,

1399
01:03:06,595 --> 01:03:08,128
which is a fantasy.

1400
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,563
Real life's not like that.

1401
01:03:09,565 --> 01:03:12,365
Real life is no
<i>Cleopatra Jones</i> or <i>Coffy.</i>

1402
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:14,067
<i>What, you don't
dig Pam Grier?</i>

1403
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:16,069
<i>She's fine as red wine
and twice as mellow.</i>

1404
01:03:16,071 --> 01:03:17,705
<i>Pam Grier is doing her thing,</i>

1405
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:21,776
but in real life, it's just
pigs killing black folks.

1406
01:03:21,778 --> 01:03:24,110
What if there was a cop
trying to change that?

1407
01:03:24,112 --> 01:03:25,680
From inside?

1408
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:27,147
Yes, from inside.

1409
01:03:27,149 --> 01:03:28,648
You can't change things
from the inside.

1410
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,383
It's a racist system.

1411
01:03:30,385 --> 01:03:32,118
You just give up like that?

1412
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,588
No. We fight for what
black people really need...

1413
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,423
- black liberation.
- Right, right.

1414
01:03:36,425 --> 01:03:38,158
So, can't you do that
from the inside?

1415
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,427
No, you can't.
The white man won't give up

1416
01:03:40,429 --> 01:03:43,163
his position in power
without a struggle.

1417
01:03:43,165 --> 01:03:46,199
What did Du Bois say
about double consciousness?

1418
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:49,503
Twoness?
Being an American and a Negro?

1419
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:52,674
Two warring ideals
inside one dark body.

1420
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,844
That's heavy, Patrice.

1421
01:03:56,846 --> 01:03:59,346
I feel that...

1422
01:03:59,348 --> 01:04:01,481
like I'm two people
all the time.

1423
01:04:01,483 --> 01:04:04,251
But you shouldn't have to be.

1424
01:04:04,253 --> 01:04:06,620
We shouldn't have a war
going on inside ourselves.

1425
01:04:06,622 --> 01:04:09,289
We should just be black.

1426
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:11,291
We're not there yet, though.

1427
01:04:11,293 --> 01:04:13,161
Well, I'm tired of waiting.

1428
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:15,696
I got a serious question
for you.

1429
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:17,430
- Oh, yeah? What?
- Very serious.

1430
01:04:17,432 --> 01:04:18,598
Uh-huh.

1431
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,233
<i>Shaft</i> or <i>Super Fly?</i>

1432
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:22,569
- What?
- Pick one.

1433
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:26,206
A private detective over a pimp
any day and twice on Sundays.

1434
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:28,275
All right.

1435
01:04:28,277 --> 01:04:31,846
Ron O'Neal
or Richard Roundtree?

1436
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:33,714
Richard Roundtree.
Pimps ain't heroes.

1437
01:04:33,716 --> 01:04:35,248
Well, Ron O'Neal isn't a pimp,

1438
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,817
although he played the hell
out of one.

1439
01:04:36,819 --> 01:04:39,452
That image
does damage to our people.

1440
01:04:39,454 --> 01:04:41,621
Geez, it's a movie.
Give it a rest.

1441
01:04:41,623 --> 01:04:43,258
I can't let it rest.

1442
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:45,659
You jive turkey.

1443
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:47,227
Who you calling
jive turkey, jive turkey?

1444
01:04:47,229 --> 01:04:48,428
I'm calling you a jive turkey.

1445
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:49,797
I got a Tamara roundhouse
coming.

1446
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,531
- Jive turkey.
- It's coming...

1447
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:53,433
- It's coming around....
- Get out of here with that!

1448
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:56,471
Jive turkey.

Sorry, had to work late.

01:05:29,404 --> 01:05:31,204
How are you guys doing?

1462
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:33,841
Got a beer for you,
Mr. Stallworth.

1463
01:05:33,843 --> 01:05:35,644
- Thanks.
- You got a twin.

1464
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,546
What?

1465
01:05:39,548 --> 01:05:40,748
You got a twin.

1466
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:41,684
Twin what?

1467
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:44,919
A twin twin.

1468
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:46,622
And your twin is a nigger.

1469
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:49,522
Looked in the phone book.

1470
01:05:49,524 --> 01:05:53,226
Went over to what I thought
was his place.

1471
01:05:53,228 --> 01:05:54,862
I found a nig there.

1472
01:05:54,864 --> 01:05:56,363
Well, my number's unlisted.

1473
01:05:56,365 --> 01:05:58,398
What address did you go to?

1474
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,701
Over on Bluestem Lane.

1475
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:02,803
Bluestem Lane?
No, I live on 21st Street.

1476
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:05,507
What'd I tell you, hmm?
Nothing to worry about.

1477
01:06:07,476 --> 01:06:09,509
So, you don't know that nigger?

1478
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:12,345
Oh, that's that nigger
I keep in the woodpile.

1479
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:14,381
You're right.

1480
01:06:14,383 --> 01:06:15,750
I thought you were talking
about somebody else.

1481
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:17,651
No, I don't.

1482
01:06:17,653 --> 01:06:19,219
1813 South 21st Street.

1483
01:06:19,221 --> 01:06:20,721
Come by sometime.
We'll have a beer.

1484
01:06:20,723 --> 01:06:22,622
And you know what?

1485
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:24,892
That loudmouth
Black Student Union bitch

1486
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:28,561
that's been in the papers
complaining about the police...

1487
01:06:28,563 --> 01:06:29,930
she was there.

1488
01:06:29,932 --> 01:06:30,898
That fucking cunt?

1489
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,801
Like to close those monkey lips
permanently.

1490
01:06:33,803 --> 01:06:34,837
Hey, don't say that.

1491
01:06:42,577 --> 01:06:44,845
Not until I get her lips
around the head of my dick.

1492
01:06:44,847 --> 01:06:47,514
Can we play some goddamn poker now?

1493
01:06:47,516 --> 01:06:48,849
Are you done?

1494
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:52,552
Ron Stallworth, you enter...
you entertain me.

1495
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:54,287
Entertain me a lot more

1496
01:06:54,289 --> 01:06:57,390
than that one-eyed nigger,
Sammy Davis Jr.

1497
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:59,426
I'll say that, though.

1498
01:06:59,428 --> 01:07:01,829
They can dance. They can dance.

1499
01:07:01,831 --> 01:07:03,731
I'll give 'em that.

1500
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:05,766
About all I'll
fucking give 'em.

1501
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:35,595
We've got active-duty soldiers
from Fort Carson.

1502
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:37,666
Going to C.I.D. with that.

1503
01:07:39,035 --> 01:07:40,533
Two mystery boys,
Steve and Jerry.

1504
01:07:40,535 --> 01:07:41,902
Those are those
fishy Army guys

1505
01:07:41,904 --> 01:07:43,070
I was telling you about.

1506
01:07:43,072 --> 01:07:44,571
Old Klan crew.

1507
01:07:44,573 --> 01:07:45,940
Felix's old Klan crew.

1508
01:07:45,942 --> 01:07:47,307
Your buddy.

1509
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:48,608
New Klan Walter.

1510
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,643
Walter's a general
without an army.

1511
01:07:50,645 --> 01:07:52,479
Felix's crew
is stronger than his.

1512
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:55,315
Oh. Of course,
Felix's wife, Connie.

1513
01:07:55,317 --> 01:07:57,852
It's crazy you've been
talking to David Duke.

1514
01:07:57,854 --> 01:08:00,921
My ace boon coon
running partner.

1515
01:08:00,923 --> 01:08:03,323
Oh, now that we got this,
though,

1516
01:08:03,325 --> 01:08:05,625
Ronny boy, I'm telling you,
we're on a roll, baby.

1517
01:08:05,627 --> 01:08:06,829
This is it.

1518
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:09,930
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

1519
01:08:09,932 --> 01:08:14,101
"Ron Stallworth, member
in good standing for the year.

1520
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:15,668
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan."

1521
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:18,005
That's us.
Stallworth Brothers.

1522
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:20,741
Yeah, well, you don't have
that little psychopath, Felix,

1523
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:22,977
staring at you,
asking where you live.

1524
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:26,015
I'm Jewish, yes,
but I wasn't raised to be.

1525
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:28,883
It wasn't part of my life.

1526
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:30,483
I never...

1527
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:31,919
thought much
about being Jewish.

1528
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:33,687
Nobody around me was Jewish.

1529
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:35,923
You know, I wasn't going
to a bunch of Bar Mitzvahs.

1530
01:08:35,925 --> 01:08:37,691
I didn't have a Bar Mitzvah.

1531
01:08:37,693 --> 01:08:39,693
I was just another white kid.

1532
01:08:39,695 --> 01:08:42,797
And now I'm in some basement
denying it out loud.

1533
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:49,402
I never thought much about it.

1534
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:51,640
Now I'm thinking about it
all the time.

1535
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:57,377
About...

1536
01:08:57,379 --> 01:09:01,650
rituals and heritage.

1537
01:09:02,752 --> 01:09:04,617
Is that passing?

1538
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:09,025
Well, then I...
well, then I have been passing.

1539
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,361
I don't want that.

1540
01:09:22,437 --> 01:09:24,571
- It sounds like they're watching us.
- I don't know.

1541
01:09:24,573 --> 01:09:25,739
I was asleep. I don't know.

1542
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:27,743
I don't know what
we're supposed to do.

1543
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:30,911
Look at this bullshit.

1544
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:32,046
Where'd you find these?

1545
01:09:32,048 --> 01:09:33,747
Plastered all over
my windshield,

1546
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:35,448
but they're all over
the neighborhood, too.

1547
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:37,051
Is this real?

1548
01:09:37,053 --> 01:09:38,986
Real as can be.

1549
01:09:38,988 --> 01:09:40,754
Intimidation?

1550
01:09:40,756 --> 01:09:44,457
Clearly, this is about the
Black Student Union and you.

1551
01:09:44,459 --> 01:09:45,625
- Me?
- Well, you've been outspoken

1552
01:09:45,627 --> 01:09:46,861
about the incident
with the police

1553
01:09:46,863 --> 01:09:48,528
when Brother Kwame was here.

1554
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:50,663
So, next, they'll have
a burning cross out front?

1555
01:09:50,665 --> 01:09:52,599
All right, they're just
trying to get to you.

1556
01:09:52,601 --> 01:09:54,567
Intimidate, like you said.
Fear tactics.

1557
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:56,804
If you don't let 'em scare you,
they got nothing.

1558
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:58,906
But keep your eyes open.
Be cool, okay?

1559
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:00,841
That's the damn problem.

1560
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:02,810
We always too cool.

1561
01:10:02,812 --> 01:10:04,111
Way too cool.

1562
01:10:04,113 --> 01:10:06,046
Well, maybe we should
call the police.

1563
01:10:06,048 --> 01:10:08,215
How we know this ain't
some of the KKK's

1564
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:10,450
honky-pig partners
passing out this shit?

1565
01:10:10,452 --> 01:10:11,484
Let me ask you... Excuse us.

1566
01:10:11,486 --> 01:10:13,020
- Let me ask you something.
- Excuse us for what?

1567
01:10:13,022 --> 01:10:15,055
"Cool." Want me to be cool?
I'll be cool.

1568
01:10:22,798 --> 01:10:26,166
And it also safeguards
against the CSPD,

1569
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:27,801
which is nice.

1570
01:10:27,803 --> 01:10:29,469
Yeah.

1571
01:10:29,471 --> 01:10:34,540
Yeah, you soak the wood
in kerosene and...

1572
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:36,810
light a cig
on a pack of matches.

1573
01:10:36,812 --> 01:10:40,047
It kind of buys you some time
to get the fuck out

1574
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:41,849
before the cross catches fire.

1575
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:43,717
Yeah.

1576
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:45,252
Must be quite a sight.

1577
01:10:45,254 --> 01:10:47,187
Oh, yeah, it is.

1578
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:48,655
It's great.

1579
01:10:48,657 --> 01:10:50,991
It's a real bonfire.

1580
01:10:50,993 --> 01:10:54,128
You can see it from miles away,
you know?

1581
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:57,932
Good visibility, as Walter
would say.

1582
01:10:57,934 --> 01:11:00,968
Freaks out the Jew media,
and it...

1583
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:04,537
well, it keeps niggers
on their nigger toes.

1584
01:11:06,943 --> 01:11:10,244
Oh, look at that.
Damn, there's another one.

1585
01:11:10,246 --> 01:11:14,181
The pigs are...
pigs are out tonight, yeah.

1586
01:11:14,183 --> 01:11:16,684
Good job.
Send another one.

1587
01:11:16,686 --> 01:11:18,686
Lot of these guys in the Army?

1588
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:20,154
Uh, we got a couple.

1589
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:23,857
We got... got a few
on active duty, yeah.

1590
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:27,194
I just finished
my second tour in 'Nam.

1591
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:30,164
- No shit.
- Yeah.

1592
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:32,532
My guy.

1593
01:11:32,534 --> 01:11:35,535
Hey, Ron, do you happen
to know anything about C-4?

1594
01:11:35,537 --> 01:11:37,306
You being in the military
and all?

1595
01:11:41,177 --> 01:11:43,010
Enough to make shit blow up.

1596
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:46,046
<i>...program dares
to love white people,</i>

1597
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:48,716
<i>white heritage
and white freedom.</i>

1598
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:50,317
<i>This program also dares
to expose</i>

1599
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:51,885
- <i>the Jewish supremacism...</i>
- Here come my boys.

1600
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:54,188
Here come the cavalry.

1601
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:56,256
<i>...and the criminal
banking establishment.</i>

1602
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:58,892
<i>These criminal bankers,
the criminal Fed,</i>

1603
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:01,128
<i>the establishment is...</i>

1604
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:04,630
<i>They're ethnically
cleansing our people,</i>

1605
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:06,867
<i>not only in the United States.</i>

1606
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:09,635
<i>Not only in
the United States.</i>

1607
01:12:09,637 --> 01:12:11,105
<i>The only... the only thing</i>

1608
01:12:11,107 --> 01:12:13,007
<i>that we hear today
from politicians...</i>

1609
01:12:13,009 --> 01:12:14,308
Y'all, cross burning is off.

1610
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,010
Too many cops, goddamn it.

1611
01:12:16,012 --> 01:12:17,311
<i>"Right,
thank you, black people.</i>

1612
01:12:17,313 --> 01:12:19,313
<i>I love black people."</i>

1613
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:20,781
<i>And, of course,</i>

1614
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:22,850
every politician...
every politician

1615
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:24,918
has to talk and genuflect

1616
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,755
to the real rulers
of our society and say,

1617
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:30,257
"I want to thank
the Jewish people.

1618
01:12:30,259 --> 01:12:32,259
I love the Jewish people."

1619
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:35,295
And: "The Jewish people
are always our friends

1620
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:37,630
"no matter what they do,

1621
01:12:37,632 --> 01:12:39,967
"no matter how much
they destroy our country.

1622
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,201
"It's just wonderful.

1623
01:12:41,203 --> 01:12:43,370
You know, we just love
the Jews."

1624
01:12:43,372 --> 01:12:45,939
And no senator or congressman

1625
01:12:45,941 --> 01:12:49,810
would dare get up and say,
"I love white people.

1626
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:51,245
"I love white heritage.

1627
01:12:51,247 --> 01:12:54,114
"I love my people,
and I love the culture

1628
01:12:54,116 --> 01:12:56,350
"that was created in Europe.

1629
01:12:56,352 --> 01:12:58,819
"And this great Western,
Christian civilization.

1630
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:00,954
"I want to see that persevere.

1631
01:13:00,956 --> 01:13:03,656
You know, I want to see that
be enriched."

1632
01:13:03,658 --> 01:13:08,162
A lot of people think
I hate Negroes, but I don't.

1633
01:13:08,164 --> 01:13:11,231
And the Organization doesn't,
either.

1634
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:13,400
They just need to be
with their own.

1635
01:13:13,402 --> 01:13:15,169
That's what Pinky would say.

1636
01:13:15,171 --> 01:13:16,804
Pinky didn't mind
segregation one bit.

1637
01:13:16,806 --> 01:13:18,739
She just wanted to be
with her own kind.

1638
01:13:18,741 --> 01:13:21,375
Sounds like she was
a Mammy to you.

1639
01:13:21,377 --> 01:13:23,077
You ever seen
<i>Gone with the Wind?</i>

1640
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:24,845
Pinky was my Hattie McDaniel.

1641
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:26,213
She won the Oscar
for that role.

1642
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:27,881
You know,
Best Supporting Actress, so...

1643
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:29,283
You were Scarlett,
and she was Mammy.

1644
01:13:29,285 --> 01:13:30,751
That's right.

1645
01:13:30,753 --> 01:13:32,019
- Right.
- That's funny.

1646
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:33,789
When she passed, it was like...

1647
01:13:35,858 --> 01:13:38,658
Well, it was like we lost
a member of the family.

1648
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:41,028
A good nigger
is funny like that.

1649
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:43,663
In that sense,
they're like a good dog.

1650
01:13:43,665 --> 01:13:46,900
They get real close to you,
and as soon as you lose 'em,

1651
01:13:46,902 --> 01:13:48,769
it just breaks your heart.

1652
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:50,204
That's well said, Ron.

1653
01:13:50,206 --> 01:13:52,940
- I knew a coon once.
- Did you?

1654
01:13:52,942 --> 01:13:55,275
Yeah, that Negro lived
across the street from us.

1655
01:13:55,277 --> 01:13:57,177
I must have been...

1656
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:59,248
six or seven.

1657
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:02,783
His nickname
was Butter Biscuit.

1658
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:06,820
How'd he get that nickname?

1659
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:09,256
He loved his mama's
butter biscuits.

1660
01:14:10,426 --> 01:14:12,793
Yum, yum.

1661
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:16,130
Me and Butter Biscuit
played together every day.

1662
01:14:16,132 --> 01:14:20,734
One day, my father
came home early from work.

1663
01:14:20,736 --> 01:14:23,403
He told me I couldn't play
with that little spook anymore

1664
01:14:23,405 --> 01:14:25,806
because I was white

1665
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:28,008
and Butter Biscuit
was a nigger.

1666
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:31,044
That's so rich.

1667
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:34,882
Well, your father sounds
like a terrific man.

1668
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:37,017
He was a true American.

1669
01:14:37,019 --> 01:14:38,986
Taught me what was right.

1670
01:14:38,988 --> 01:14:41,955
This is why we need
more people like you and me

1671
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:45,192
in public office...
get this country back on track.

1672
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:46,927
Amen.

1673
01:14:46,929 --> 01:14:49,163
For America to achieve its...

1674
01:14:49,165 --> 01:14:52,099
uh, its greatness again.

1675
01:14:52,101 --> 01:14:54,201
Absolutely.

1676
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:57,905
Boy, I sure wish we had
a chance to chat face-to-face.

1677
01:14:57,907 --> 01:14:59,840
In due time, my friend.

1678
01:14:59,842 --> 01:15:03,010
In due time,
I will be in Colorado Springs

1679
01:15:03,012 --> 01:15:04,845
for your initiation.

1680
01:15:04,847 --> 01:15:06,914
You're coming
to Colorado Springs, sir?

1681
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:08,916
You bet your
Mayflower Society ass I am.

1682
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:11,818
You're darn tootin'.

1683
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,127
All right, I pulled the
materials that you asked for.

1684
01:15:20,129 --> 01:15:22,129
- Okay.
- So you just move it around

1685
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:23,997
like this to see the images.

1686
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:26,366
Once you try it, I think
you'll get the hang of it.

1687
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:28,101
- Okay? Got it?
- Thank you.

1688
01:15:28,103 --> 01:15:29,803
Okay, I'll be at the desk
if you need anything.

1689
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:31,106
Okay. Thank you.

1690
01:15:41,817 --> 01:15:44,418
<i>Thanks for getting back to me.</i>

1691
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,419
<i>Listen, I think</i>

1692
01:15:45,421 --> 01:15:47,089
we need a new leader.

1693
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:50,457
Someone everyone
can unite behind.

1694
01:15:50,459 --> 01:15:53,860
I just don't think
I'm gonna carry the votes.

1695
01:15:53,862 --> 01:15:56,863
Felix would love
to be the one, but...

1696
01:15:56,865 --> 01:15:58,198
I can't let that happen.

1697
01:15:59,335 --> 01:16:02,302
He's a crazy son of a bitch.

1698
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:05,138
Goddamn... loose cannon.

1699
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:09,943
No, we need someone articulate,
someone...

1700
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:13,347
someone who displays
real leadership qualities.

1701
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:17,451
I think it should be you.

1702
01:16:17,453 --> 01:16:19,353
I gotta think about this.

1703
01:16:19,355 --> 01:16:21,822
My father, he's sick,
and he lives in El Paso.

1704
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:23,557
I don't know
if I can handle both.

1705
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:25,559
Sorry to hear that.

1706
01:16:25,561 --> 01:16:27,828
Think about it.

1707
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:30,364
You're a smart
and diligent man,

1708
01:16:30,366 --> 01:16:33,433
and I've got no doubt
that you could handle it.

1709
01:16:38,941 --> 01:16:41,341
I think it's time
we get some new blood in here.

1710
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,044
- Yeah?
- New ideas.

1711
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:46,847
For that reason,
I'm planning to step down

1712
01:16:46,849 --> 01:16:49,049
as your president.

1713
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:52,219
But I would like to make
a nomination.

1714
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:55,956
Mr. Ron Stallworth
for chapter president.

1715
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:57,124
We just met this guy.

1716
01:16:57,126 --> 01:16:59,895
He just walked in
off the street.

1717
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:03,263
Let me ask a question.

1718
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:05,098
Is there anybody here
who's willing

1719
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,000
to put their neck
on the line for Ron?

1720
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:08,368
I'll vouch for Ron.

1721
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,570
You know who else
vouches for Ron?

1722
01:17:10,572 --> 01:17:11,571
Mr. Duke.

1723
01:17:11,573 --> 01:17:14,908
Look, it's a big honor,
but I-I can't accept.

1724
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,443
The trouble is,
what you good men need

1725
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:19,012
is a president
who will be constant.

1726
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,480
On call day in, day out.

1727
01:17:20,482 --> 01:17:22,416
My old man is sick.
I just found out.

1728
01:17:22,418 --> 01:17:25,018
So I'm going to be back and
forth between here and Dallas.

1729
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,953
El Paso, Flip, El Paso!

1730
01:17:26,955 --> 01:17:27,956
Thought it was El Paso.

1731
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:30,390
It is. What did I say?

1732
01:17:30,392 --> 01:17:32,292
- Dallas.
- Which one is it, Ron?

1733
01:17:32,294 --> 01:17:34,294
Make up your mind.

1734
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:35,495
Dallas is where the layover is.

1735
01:17:35,497 --> 01:17:37,464
El Paso is where my father is.

1736
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:39,132
Dallas, that's, uh...
that's where they killed

1737
01:17:39,134 --> 01:17:41,034
that nigger lover, Kennedy.

1738
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:42,402
Where you learned that?

1739
01:17:42,404 --> 01:17:44,438
I-I can read. I can.

1740
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,506
Well, we'll pray
for your pop's health.

1741
01:17:46,508 --> 01:17:48,208
It's him.

1742
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:50,110
Hey, Ron, I don't share this

1743
01:17:50,112 --> 01:17:52,680
- with a lot of people, but...
- Yeah.

1744
01:17:52,682 --> 01:17:54,682
Well, I'm anxious to meet you.

1745
01:17:54,684 --> 01:17:56,149
Excited to meet you, too, Ron.

1746
01:17:56,151 --> 01:17:57,517
Aren't you ever concerned

1747
01:17:57,519 --> 01:17:59,920
of some smart-aleck nigger
calling you,

1748
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:01,555
pretending to be white?

1749
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:05,359
No. I can always tell
when I'm talking to a Negro.

1750
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:06,360
How so?

1751
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:08,097
Take you, for example, Ron.

1752
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,199
Me?

1753
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:13,168
Yeah.

1754
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:20,307
I mean, I can tell
that you're a...

1755
01:18:20,309 --> 01:18:22,943
pure Aryan white man

1756
01:18:22,945 --> 01:18:24,978
from the way you pronounce
certain words.

1757
01:18:29,618 --> 01:18:31,952
Can you give me any examples?

1758
01:18:31,954 --> 01:18:33,387
Yeah, take the word...

1759
01:18:33,389 --> 01:18:35,255
uh, "are."

1760
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:37,157
Pure Aryan like you or I

1761
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:38,992
would pronounce it correctly.
"Are."

1762
01:18:38,994 --> 01:18:42,262
Negro pronounces it "are-uh."

1763
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:43,630
Did you ever notice that?

1764
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:46,066
It's like, "Are-uh...

1765
01:18:46,068 --> 01:18:49,236
"you gonna fry up that...

1766
01:18:49,238 --> 01:18:51,605
crispy fried chicken,
soul brother?"

1767
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:54,309
You know?

1768
01:18:56,311 --> 01:18:58,078
Sorry.

1769
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,479
Wow.

1770
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:01,081
You are so white.

1771
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,482
Thank you for teaching me
this lesson.

1772
01:19:02,484 --> 01:19:04,384
If you had not brought it
to my attention,

1773
01:19:04,386 --> 01:19:05,753
I wouldn't have noticed
the difference

1774
01:19:05,755 --> 01:19:07,654
between how we talk
and how Negroes talk.

1775
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:09,222
Good, good.

1776
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:11,391
Yeah.

1777
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:13,360
I'd love to continue
this conversation

1778
01:19:13,362 --> 01:19:15,328
in Colorado Springs.

1779
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:17,063
It's beautiful here, sir.

1780
01:19:17,065 --> 01:19:18,198
God's country.

1781
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,567
Well, that's what I hear, Ron.

1782
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:25,105
I look forward to meeting you,
and, uh...

1783
01:19:25,107 --> 01:19:26,606
we'll be talking real soon.

1784
01:19:26,608 --> 01:19:29,042
God bless White America.

1785
01:19:29,044 --> 01:19:30,377
Come back.

1786
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:32,279
- Oh, my God.
- Who are you giving the finger?

1787
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:33,280
Hello?

1788
01:19:33,282 --> 01:19:34,383
It's Felix.

1789
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:39,052
<i>Catch you at a bad time?</i>

1790
01:19:39,054 --> 01:19:40,487
<i>No, not at all.</i>

1791
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:41,756
<i>I'm just finishing a meal.</i>

1792
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:47,060
Meeting... my house now.

1793
01:19:47,062 --> 01:19:48,997
<i>Ron, get your ass in gear.</i>

1794
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:52,434
And don't tell
mealymouth Walter.

1795
01:19:53,736 --> 01:19:55,604
Welcome to the promised land.

1796
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:04,779
In about a week's time,

1797
01:20:04,781 --> 01:20:07,247
we'll be welcoming
Mr. David Duke to our city.

1798
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:08,648
- Oh, oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1799
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:11,151
Who's packing tonight?

1800
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:12,753
I'm packing.

1801
01:20:12,755 --> 01:20:14,287
Amen.

1802
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:15,823
Where's your piece, Ron?

1803
01:20:15,825 --> 01:20:19,426
Well, you know, I don't
carry it on me all the time.

1804
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:24,164
"Don't carry."

1805
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:25,833
No, that...

1806
01:20:25,835 --> 01:20:28,370
I got you covered.

1807
01:20:30,405 --> 01:20:32,606
Won't happen again.

1808
01:20:32,608 --> 01:20:36,309
We're gonna need your good shot
come next Sunday.

1809
01:20:36,311 --> 01:20:38,345
Why? What's next Sunday?

1810
01:20:38,347 --> 01:20:40,614
The war is gonna come to us.

1811
01:20:40,616 --> 01:20:42,449
Well, fuck yeah.

1812
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:44,384
Looks like we got ourselves
another soldier.

1813
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:46,620
Just make sure that when
you're at the steakhouse,

1814
01:20:46,622 --> 01:20:48,255
you got your new friend
with you.

1815
01:20:48,257 --> 01:20:49,623
And, Ron,

1816
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:51,625
you're gonna want
to name your piece.

1817
01:20:51,627 --> 01:20:53,193
This is Betsey.

1818
01:20:53,195 --> 01:20:55,328
- Don't point that at me. Jesus Christ.
- I'm sorry.

1819
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:57,397
Don't fucking point the gun
at anybody ever.

1820
01:20:57,399 --> 01:20:59,867
I know what I'm doing.
I know how to use this thing.

1821
01:21:04,506 --> 01:21:05,873
- Honey.
- Mm-hmm?

1822
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:08,475
Do you ever have
second thoughts?

1823
01:21:08,477 --> 01:21:10,210
About what?

1824
01:21:10,212 --> 01:21:11,812
Killing 'em.

1825
01:21:11,814 --> 01:21:13,580
Never think twice
about killing niggers.

1826
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:15,482
You won't be able
to take it back, though.

1827
01:21:15,484 --> 01:21:17,384
They're the first
of many niggers

1828
01:21:17,386 --> 01:21:20,554
- that must die, honey bun.
- I know. It's just...

1829
01:21:20,556 --> 01:21:22,155
becoming so real.

1830
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:24,257
I always thought
it would be like a dream.

1831
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:25,425
I know.

1832
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:27,627
It's just so beautiful.

1833
01:21:27,629 --> 01:21:29,529
We're cleansing this country

1834
01:21:29,531 --> 01:21:32,800
of a backwards race
of chimpanzees.

1835
01:21:32,802 --> 01:21:35,635
First the spooks.

1836
01:21:35,637 --> 01:21:37,673
Then the kikes.

1837
01:21:39,508 --> 01:21:42,242
Free at last, free at last.

1838
01:21:42,244 --> 01:21:44,377
Thank God Almighty,

1839
01:21:44,379 --> 01:21:48,381
free of them niggers at last.

1840
01:21:48,383 --> 01:21:51,451
I love it
when you do that, honey.

1841
01:21:53,555 --> 01:21:55,322
We've talked about
killing niggers

1842
01:21:55,324 --> 01:21:59,159
for so many years,
and now it's really happening.

1843
01:21:59,161 --> 01:22:00,393
Hmm.

1844
01:22:00,395 --> 01:22:02,395
My old man always told me

1845
01:22:02,397 --> 01:22:04,297
good things come
to those who wait.

1846
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:05,735
Mmm!

1847
01:22:07,937 --> 01:22:10,771
Thank you for bringing me
into your life.

1848
01:22:10,773 --> 01:22:13,674
For loving me like you do.

1849
01:22:13,676 --> 01:22:17,310
For giving me a purpose,
direction.

1850
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:19,780
This could be
the new Boston Tea Party.

1851
01:22:19,782 --> 01:22:21,481
Oh...

1852
01:22:58,553 --> 01:22:59,820
Mr. Stallworth.

1853
01:22:59,822 --> 01:23:01,858
Pleased to meet you.

1854
01:23:02,959 --> 01:23:04,727
Names of chapter members?

1855
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,399
What is this about?

1856
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:16,670
Two names on your list
work at NORAD.

1857
01:23:16,672 --> 01:23:18,873
The two mystery men,
Steve and Jerry?

1858
01:23:18,875 --> 01:23:22,943
Real names are Harry Dricks
and Kevin Nelson.

1859
01:23:22,945 --> 01:23:26,479
Two clowns with top
security clearances.

1860
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:31,420
These Klansmen are in charge
of monitoring our safety.

1861
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:37,557
You've done a service
to your country.

1862
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:40,027
We've been following
your investigation.

1863
01:23:40,029 --> 01:23:41,630
Impressive.

1864
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:44,999
Last night,
Fort Carson reported

1865
01:23:45,001 --> 01:23:48,736
several C-4 explosives
missing from their armory.

1866
01:23:48,738 --> 01:23:50,905
- No suspects.
- Klan?

1867
01:23:50,907 --> 01:23:55,542
Wait, the KKK
and the United States Army?

1868
01:23:55,544 --> 01:23:58,411
You won't see this on the news
for obvious reasons, but...

1869
01:23:58,413 --> 01:24:00,649
thought it might be
of interest to you.

1870
01:24:03,052 --> 01:24:04,651
If you know
about a possible attack,

1871
01:24:04,653 --> 01:24:06,653
I need to know when.

1872
01:24:06,655 --> 01:24:08,889
You're the one with
the impressive investigation.

1873
01:24:08,891 --> 01:24:11,591
But can't you
or the FBI chip in?

1874
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:13,560
Sir?

1875
01:24:13,562 --> 01:24:15,062
FBI?

1876
01:24:15,064 --> 01:24:17,700
Federal Bureau
of Investigation?

1877
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:21,470
We never had this conversation.

1878
01:24:25,507 --> 01:24:26,974
You can hate me all you want,
all right?

1879
01:24:26,976 --> 01:24:28,776
Just promise me you won't go
to that protest.

1880
01:24:28,778 --> 01:24:30,010
I'm going. We're going.

1881
01:24:30,012 --> 01:24:31,746
Wh-What are you talking about?

1882
01:24:31,748 --> 01:24:33,379
I can't get into specifics,

1883
01:24:33,381 --> 01:24:35,381
but today the Klan
is planning an attack.

1884
01:24:35,383 --> 01:24:36,817
Then we have to tell
the people.

1885
01:24:36,819 --> 01:24:38,318
It's not an option.

1886
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,887
Ungawa, Black Power!

1887
01:24:39,889 --> 01:24:42,589
What's wrong with you?

1888
01:24:42,591 --> 01:24:45,960
No one else can know while it's
an active investigation.

1889
01:24:45,962 --> 01:24:47,427
Active investigation?

1890
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:48,963
And pray tell,
how do you know that?

1891
01:24:48,965 --> 01:24:51,331
Are you a pig?

1892
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:52,532
No.

1893
01:24:52,534 --> 01:24:53,834
Wh-What are you, then?

1894
01:24:53,836 --> 01:24:55,703
Ungawa, Black Power!

1895
01:24:55,705 --> 01:24:58,638
Ungawa, Black Power!
Ungawa, Black Power!

1896
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,340
Want to sit?

1897
01:25:00,342 --> 01:25:02,342
No. I'll stand.

1898
01:25:02,344 --> 01:25:05,478
Ungawa, Black Power!
Ungawa, Black Power!

1899
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,447
I'm an undercover detective.

1900
01:25:07,449 --> 01:25:09,582
I'm investigating the Klan.

1901
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:10,951
Fucking KKK?

1902
01:25:10,953 --> 01:25:12,519
Ron Stallworth, you lied to me.

1903
01:25:12,521 --> 01:25:13,921
Is that even your real name?

1904
01:25:13,923 --> 01:25:16,356
Ron Stallworth
is my first and last name.

1905
01:25:16,358 --> 01:25:17,825
Look, today is not the day,
Patrice.

1906
01:25:17,827 --> 01:25:19,359
I take my duties
as the president

1907
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:20,460
of the Black Student Union
seriously.

1908
01:25:20,462 --> 01:25:21,896
Well, how much good did it do?

1909
01:25:21,898 --> 01:25:23,831
You could sit in the middle
of Nevada Avenue,

1910
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:26,466
light yourself on fire,
the KKK will still be here.

1911
01:25:26,468 --> 01:25:29,003
Well, at least I would be
doing something, unlike you.

1912
01:25:29,005 --> 01:25:30,905
- Unlike me?
- Yeah.

1913
01:25:30,907 --> 01:25:32,973
Don't think, just because
I don't wear a black beret

1914
01:25:32,975 --> 01:25:34,708
or a black leather jacket,
black Ray-Bans,

1915
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:35,943
screaming, "Kill Whitey,"

1916
01:25:35,945 --> 01:25:38,813
that I don't care
about my people.

1917
01:25:38,815 --> 01:25:40,815
The night we saw
Brother Kwame speak,

1918
01:25:40,817 --> 01:25:42,850
were you undercover then, too?

1919
01:25:42,852 --> 01:25:44,885
That's not fair.

1920
01:25:44,887 --> 01:25:46,452
- You have to understand...
- Answer the question.

1921
01:25:46,454 --> 01:25:47,955
Were you undercover
the night we met?

1922
01:25:47,957 --> 01:25:49,890
Yes or no?

1923
01:25:49,892 --> 01:25:51,759
Ron Stallworth,
are you for the revolution

1924
01:25:51,761 --> 01:25:53,896
and the liberation
of black people?

1925
01:25:55,932 --> 01:26:00,067
I'm an undercover detective for
the Colorado Springs Police.

1926
01:26:00,069 --> 01:26:02,002
It's my J-O-B.
That's the truth.

1927
01:26:02,004 --> 01:26:05,172
House niggers said they had
a J-O-B, too.

1928
01:26:05,174 --> 01:26:07,141
You disgust me.

1929
01:26:07,143 --> 01:26:09,609
My brother,
you need to wake up.

1930
01:26:09,611 --> 01:26:13,479
Ungawa, Black Power!
Ungawa, Black Power!

1931
01:26:13,481 --> 01:26:15,015
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

1932
01:26:15,017 --> 01:26:17,084
You don't cross those lines.

1933
01:26:17,086 --> 01:26:20,486
This is about an investigation,
not a relationship.

1934
01:26:20,488 --> 01:26:22,756
Hate to break that blue wall
of silence.

1935
01:26:22,758 --> 01:26:23,991
Nice one.

1936
01:26:23,993 --> 01:26:26,593
- Is Patrice really in danger?
- Maybe.

1937
01:26:26,595 --> 01:26:28,028
Ungawa, Black Power!

1938
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:29,697
Ungawa,
Black Power!

1939
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:31,198
Ungawa, Black Power!

1940
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,766
Ungawa,
Black Power!

1941
01:26:32,768 --> 01:26:34,634
Ungawa, Black Power!

1942
01:26:34,636 --> 01:26:36,571
It's off.

1943
01:26:39,674 --> 01:26:41,409
Yep.

1944
01:26:46,682 --> 01:26:48,851
You'll know soon enough.

1945
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,520
What?

1946
01:26:54,156 --> 01:26:56,456
Felix just said the march
has been canceled.

1947
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:57,457
Why?

1948
01:26:57,459 --> 01:26:58,959
Could be all the death threats.

1949
01:26:58,961 --> 01:27:00,828
No, they're used to that.

1950
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:03,230
And there's been nothing more
about the explosives?

1951
01:27:03,232 --> 01:27:04,564
No.

1952
01:27:04,566 --> 01:27:06,000
Fuck it.

1953
01:27:06,002 --> 01:27:07,001
We get 'em on weapons charges

1954
01:27:07,003 --> 01:27:08,769
and stop them
from doing anything that way.

1955
01:27:08,771 --> 01:27:10,470
Then what?
You know, misdemeanor at best.

1956
01:27:10,472 --> 01:27:12,505
- Then they walk.
- I have a special assignment for Ron.

1957
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:13,841
Ron already has an assignment.

1958
01:27:13,843 --> 01:27:15,042
Yeah, what could be
more important

1959
01:27:15,044 --> 01:27:16,143
than preventing an attack, sir?

1960
01:27:16,145 --> 01:27:17,745
We have
very credible threats

1961
01:27:17,747 --> 01:27:19,079
against David Duke's life.

1962
01:27:19,081 --> 01:27:22,016
So, Ron, I am assigning you
security detail

1963
01:27:22,018 --> 01:27:23,616
- for David Duke.
- What?

1964
01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:25,652
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think

1965
01:27:25,654 --> 01:27:27,688
this is a wise decision,
given the situation.

1966
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:28,923
Who cares what you think?

1967
01:27:28,925 --> 01:27:30,157
Duke needs protection.

1968
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:31,992
There's no one else available.

1969
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:33,626
Nut-cracking time.

1970
01:27:33,628 --> 01:27:35,528
Put aside
your personal politics.

1971
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:37,597
Chief, it's not about that,
and you know it.

1972
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:39,266
David Duke and Ron
have been talking

1973
01:27:39,268 --> 01:27:40,701
on the phone several times.

1974
01:27:40,703 --> 01:27:42,169
If he recognizes his voice...

1975
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:44,604
If-if... if-if any
of the Klansmen do,

1976
01:27:44,606 --> 01:27:46,674
it'll compromise
our entire investigation.

1977
01:27:46,676 --> 01:27:48,608
- It's too dangerous.
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

1978
01:27:48,610 --> 01:27:50,878
but didn't you boast to me
that you were fluent

1979
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,716
in both English and jive?

1980
01:27:55,084 --> 01:27:56,549
Do you remember that?

1981
01:27:56,551 --> 01:27:57,650
Answer the chief.

1982
01:27:57,652 --> 01:27:58,886
Oh, shut the fuck up, Landers.

1983
01:27:58,888 --> 01:28:01,121
You know, you've been trying
to sabotage me since day one.

1984
01:28:01,123 --> 01:28:03,023
Why are you getting
so worked up, boy?

1985
01:28:03,025 --> 01:28:04,624
- Hey, Ron!
- Hey, Ron, come on.

1986
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:06,093
- Ron, Ron, no! Ron!
- It's not worth it.

1987
01:28:06,095 --> 01:28:07,127
- Okay, okay, all right.
- Just...

1988
01:28:07,129 --> 01:28:08,628
- Go, go, go.
- Stay put.

1989
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:10,297
- Ron, whoa, whoa!
- What the fuck is that?

1990
01:28:10,299 --> 01:28:12,632
Gotta bring something
to get something, Landers.

1991
01:28:12,634 --> 01:28:15,568
Eat a white dick!

1992
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:18,638
You let him
get to you that easy?

1993
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:21,043
You don't have a shot
with David Duke.

1994
01:28:25,748 --> 01:28:27,580
First, the primary target.

1995
01:28:27,582 --> 01:28:29,216
Felix says you're doing it.

1996
01:28:29,218 --> 01:28:30,985
So all you have to do

1997
01:28:30,987 --> 01:28:33,187
is set the pocketbook
on the front porch,

1998
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:34,788
the back porch, a sidewalk.

1999
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:36,090
Doesn't matter.

2000
01:28:36,092 --> 01:28:37,557
As long as it's against
the building,

2001
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:39,159
you can plant it anywhere.

2002
01:28:39,161 --> 01:28:43,097
I got enough C-4 here
to take out the whole thing.

2003
01:28:43,099 --> 01:28:45,631
Be careful.

2004
01:28:45,633 --> 01:28:48,135
- You understand?
- I understand.

2005
01:28:48,137 --> 01:28:50,570
All you have to do when you
placed it... Hey, sweetie.

2006
01:28:50,572 --> 01:28:51,939
You listening?
All you have to do

2007
01:28:51,941 --> 01:28:55,042
when you placed it
is flip the switch.

2008
01:28:55,044 --> 01:28:56,176
Flip the switch.

2009
01:28:56,178 --> 01:28:57,344
That's it.

2010
01:28:57,346 --> 01:28:58,714
You got it?

2011
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:03,616
Miss Black Student Union Bitch

2012
01:29:03,618 --> 01:29:06,053
is bringing in
some old coon to speak.

2013
01:29:06,055 --> 01:29:07,988
Place should be packed.

2014
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:10,991
So, Brother Walker,
nothing but rubble.

2015
01:29:10,993 --> 01:29:12,259
And barbecued niggers.

2016
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,965
And what happens
if that don't work?

2017
01:29:17,967 --> 01:29:19,099
Plan B.

2018
01:29:19,101 --> 01:29:20,136
Can you handle it, honey?

2019
01:29:21,237 --> 01:29:23,303
You can count on me.

2020
01:29:23,305 --> 01:29:25,708
I've been waiting
to do my part.

2021
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:30,377
Oh, sweet as candy.

2022
01:29:30,379 --> 01:29:32,980
Ah, look at the lovebirds.

2023
01:29:32,982 --> 01:29:34,982
Can I feel the C-4?

2024
01:29:34,984 --> 01:29:36,750
No C-4 for you.

2025
01:29:36,752 --> 01:29:39,153
You'll blow us all the fuck
up to kingdom come.

2026
01:29:48,964 --> 01:29:51,098
- What is this black...?
- Out here with

2027
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,300
- the great David Duke.
- Look at this fucking guy.

2028
01:29:53,302 --> 01:29:54,968
How's he getting away
with that?

2029
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:56,636
Mr. Duke's security detail.

2030
01:29:56,638 --> 01:29:58,739
- What?
- Fuck this guy.

2031
01:29:58,741 --> 01:30:01,041
Mr. Duke. I'm a detective

2032
01:30:01,043 --> 01:30:03,710
from the Colorado Springs
Police Department.

2033
01:30:03,712 --> 01:30:05,212
I'm here
to keep you safe today.

2034
01:30:05,214 --> 01:30:07,681
I'm sorry, have...
have we met before?

2035
01:30:07,683 --> 01:30:09,416
Mm-mm.
You may know that there's

2036
01:30:09,418 --> 01:30:11,418
several credible threats
against your life.

2037
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:12,853
How's it going out here?

2038
01:30:12,855 --> 01:30:14,388
There have been threats
on my life,

2039
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:16,156
and this is the detective

2040
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:18,158
they've assigned
as my bodyguard.

2041
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,328
Mr. Duke, I don't agree
with your philosophies.

2042
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:24,231
However, I'm a professional,

2043
01:30:24,233 --> 01:30:26,800
so I will do everything
within my means and beyond

2044
01:30:26,802 --> 01:30:28,335
to make sure you're safe.

2045
01:30:28,337 --> 01:30:30,906
Okay, I appreciate
your professionalism.

2046
01:30:37,146 --> 01:30:38,745
Allow me, sir.

2047
01:30:38,747 --> 01:30:39,715
Thank you.

2048
01:31:23,959 --> 01:31:25,828
- Right this way, sir.
- Walt.

2049
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:29,429
- Bro.
- Sir.

2050
01:31:29,431 --> 01:31:30,366
How are you?

2051
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:39,306
Sorry for all the extra
security today.

2052
01:31:39,308 --> 01:31:41,308
Can't be too careful.

2053
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:44,378
Yeah, I know.
We have a strong, strong...

2054
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:45,779
Hey, fellas.

2055
01:31:45,781 --> 01:31:47,014
Yeah, like you were saying,

2056
01:31:47,016 --> 01:31:48,782
uh, last week
on the phone, uh...

2057
01:31:48,784 --> 01:31:50,117
Well, Mr. Duke.

2058
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:52,019
I would like you to meet
our newest recruit,

2059
01:31:52,021 --> 01:31:53,320
Ron Stallworth.

2060
01:31:53,322 --> 01:31:56,156
Ron Stallworth,
it is a pleasure

2061
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:57,424
to finally meet you in person.

2062
01:31:57,426 --> 01:31:58,992
Same. Same. You as well.

2063
01:31:58,994 --> 01:32:00,260
This is our brother, Jesse.

2064
01:32:00,262 --> 01:32:01,895
- I'm Jesse.
- Hey, Jesse.

2065
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:03,330
- Ron.
- Uh, Ron, yeah.

2066
01:32:03,332 --> 01:32:05,799
- I've heard so much about you.
- Oh, okay.

2067
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:07,868
I didn't realize
how nervous I was gonna be.

2068
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:09,336
Oh!

2069
01:32:09,338 --> 01:32:10,971
Oh, that's all right.

2070
01:32:10,973 --> 01:32:12,806
What's that doing here?

2071
01:32:12,808 --> 01:32:17,244
Uh, that's the fucking cop
they got to guard Mr. Duke.

2072
01:32:17,246 --> 01:32:19,413
Isn't that the living shit?

2073
01:32:19,415 --> 01:32:20,814
Gentlemen...

2074
01:32:20,816 --> 01:32:22,216
it's time.

2075
01:32:22,218 --> 01:32:24,086
- Ron, why don't you follow me?
- Okay.

2076
01:32:25,187 --> 01:32:26,220
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

2077
01:32:26,222 --> 01:32:28,021
Let's go. Let's go.

2078
01:32:45,808 --> 01:32:47,908
You stay right here.

2079
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:49,378
You hear?

2080
01:33:02,391 --> 01:33:05,361
Ah...

2081
01:33:07,429 --> 01:33:10,897
God, America's going to hell
in a handbasket.

2082
01:33:19,108 --> 01:33:22,876
<i>That started out
as a nice spring day</i>

2083
01:33:22,878 --> 01:33:25,479
<i>back there in Waco, Texas.</i>

2084
01:33:25,481 --> 01:33:29,082
<i>May 15, 1916.</i>

2085
01:33:29,084 --> 01:33:30,519
Jesse Washington...

2086
01:33:32,588 --> 01:33:34,456
...was a friend of mine.

2087
01:33:36,558 --> 01:33:38,558
He was 17.

2088
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,227
I was 18.

2089
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:44,431
We kind of looked at Jesse
and called him slow.

2090
01:33:46,135 --> 01:33:48,302
Today...

2091
01:33:48,304 --> 01:33:51,972
you'd call him
mentally retarded.

2092
01:33:51,974 --> 01:33:55,208
They claimed Jesse...

2093
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:58,011
raped and murdered
a white woman

2094
01:33:58,013 --> 01:34:02,184
by the name of Lucy Fryer.

2095
01:34:04,353 --> 01:34:07,621
They put Jesse on trial,

2096
01:34:07,623 --> 01:34:10,324
and he was convicted
by an all-white jury

2097
01:34:10,326 --> 01:34:14,194
after they deliberated
for only four minutes.

2098
01:34:16,365 --> 01:34:20,200
My brothers in Christ,

2099
01:34:20,202 --> 01:34:23,203
Nobel Prize recipient,

2100
01:34:23,205 --> 01:34:25,005
co-creator of the transistor

2101
01:34:25,007 --> 01:34:27,040
and a dear,
dear friend of mine,

2102
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:28,676
Dr. William Shockley,

2103
01:34:28,678 --> 01:34:31,578
whose groundbreaking
scientific work

2104
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:33,380
ushered in the computer age,

2105
01:34:33,382 --> 01:34:37,217
has proven, through his research
with eugenics,

2106
01:34:37,219 --> 01:34:40,954
that each of us here
has flowing through our veins

2107
01:34:40,956 --> 01:34:42,589
the genes of a superior race.

2108
01:34:42,591 --> 01:34:44,358
It's a fact.

2109
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:47,361
It's a fact.
It can't be disputed.

2110
01:34:47,363 --> 01:34:51,131
Today, we celebrate that truth.

2111
01:34:51,133 --> 01:34:53,969
Masks off, hoods on.

2112
01:34:55,671 --> 01:35:00,040
I was working across the street
at the shoeshine parlor.

2113
01:35:00,042 --> 01:35:04,177
<i>And after the verdict,</i>

2114
01:35:04,179 --> 01:35:06,179
<i>a mob grabbed Jesse,</i>

2115
01:35:06,181 --> 01:35:07,614
put a chain
around his neck and...

2116
01:35:09,084 --> 01:35:10,384
...dragged him out
of the courthouse.

2117
01:35:10,386 --> 01:35:12,052
Oh, my God.

2118
01:35:12,054 --> 01:35:14,121
I knew I had to hide.

2119
01:35:14,123 --> 01:35:15,222
That way.

2120
01:35:15,224 --> 01:35:17,126
Be careful, brother.

2121
01:35:20,596 --> 01:35:22,562
Well, all right.

2122
01:35:22,564 --> 01:35:25,499
<i>Where I was, the shoe parlor</i>

2123
01:35:25,501 --> 01:35:29,035
had a window up in the attic.

2124
01:35:29,037 --> 01:35:31,538
And I could see the crowd.

2125
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:36,076
They marched Jesse
through the streets.

2126
01:35:36,078 --> 01:35:40,347
They stabbed him and beat him.

2127
01:35:40,349 --> 01:35:44,317
<i>And finally, in a bloody heap,</i>

2128
01:35:44,319 --> 01:35:47,189
they held him down
in the street...

2129
01:35:50,025 --> 01:35:51,726
...and cut off his testicles.

2130
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,735
God...

2131
01:36:00,737 --> 01:36:05,974
give us true white men.

2132
01:36:08,277 --> 01:36:12,512
The Invisible Empire
demands strong minds,

2133
01:36:12,514 --> 01:36:16,049
great hearts, true faith,

2134
01:36:16,051 --> 01:36:19,386
clean and ready hands.

2135
01:36:19,388 --> 01:36:22,389
Men who have honor.

2136
01:36:22,391 --> 01:36:24,124
Men who will not lie.

2137
01:36:24,126 --> 01:36:26,626
Men who can stand
before a demagogue

2138
01:36:26,628 --> 01:36:29,730
and damn his treacherous
flatteries without blinking.

2139
01:36:29,732 --> 01:36:32,165
God, give us real men.

2140
01:36:32,167 --> 01:36:35,068
Courageous men
who flinch not at duty.

2141
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:38,071
Men of dependable character,
men of sterling worth.

2142
01:36:38,073 --> 01:36:42,309
Then wrongs will be redressed,
and right shall rule the Earth.

2143
01:36:42,311 --> 01:36:45,314
God, give us true white men.

2144
01:36:47,684 --> 01:36:48,685
Ron Stallworth.

2145
01:36:50,052 --> 01:36:51,719
Rise.

2146
01:36:51,721 --> 01:36:53,320
Step forward.

2147
01:36:53,322 --> 01:36:56,223
The police
and the city officials

2148
01:36:56,225 --> 01:37:00,293
were out there watching him.

2149
01:37:00,295 --> 01:37:02,797
They cut off his fingers.

2150
01:37:02,799 --> 01:37:06,466
And threw coal oil
all over his body.

2151
01:37:06,468 --> 01:37:09,069
They lit a bonfire

2152
01:37:09,071 --> 01:37:12,305
and raised him and lowered him

2153
01:37:12,307 --> 01:37:15,075
over these flames

2154
01:37:15,077 --> 01:37:19,279
over and over and over again.

2155
01:37:19,281 --> 01:37:21,214
Ron Stallworth,

2156
01:37:21,216 --> 01:37:24,384
are you a white,
non-Jewish American citizen?

2157
01:37:24,386 --> 01:37:25,786
Yes.

2158
01:37:25,788 --> 01:37:28,557
Yes... what?

2159
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:33,527
Yes, I am a white,

2160
01:37:33,529 --> 01:37:37,163
non-Jewish American citizen.

2161
01:37:37,165 --> 01:37:38,866
Are you in favor
of a white man's government

2162
01:37:38,868 --> 01:37:40,701
- in this country?
- Yes.

2163
01:37:40,703 --> 01:37:44,571
Ron Stallworth, are you willing
to dedicate your life

2164
01:37:44,573 --> 01:37:47,407
to the protection,
the preservation

2165
01:37:47,409 --> 01:37:50,377
and the advancement
of the white race

2166
01:37:50,379 --> 01:37:53,580
in mind, in body

2167
01:37:53,582 --> 01:37:55,783
- and in spirit?
- Yes.

2168
01:37:55,785 --> 01:37:59,386
Be seated.

2169
01:37:59,388 --> 01:38:04,825
The mayor had a photographer
by the name of Gildersleeve.

2170
01:38:04,827 --> 01:38:08,562
He came and took pictures
of the whole thing.

2171
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:14,267
Those pictures were later sold
as postcards.

2172
01:38:23,445 --> 01:38:25,445
Remove your hood.

2173
01:38:25,447 --> 01:38:29,482
<i>They put Jesse's
charred body into a bag.</i>

2174
01:38:29,484 --> 01:38:30,751
Remove your hood.

2175
01:38:30,753 --> 01:38:32,722
<i>Dragged him through town.</i>

2176
01:38:34,791 --> 01:38:37,290
Remove your hood.

2177
01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:40,327
<i>They sold the remains.</i>

2178
01:38:40,329 --> 01:38:41,729
Remove your hood.

2179
01:38:41,731 --> 01:38:44,533
<i>As souvenirs.</i>

2180
01:38:45,667 --> 01:38:47,369
Remove your hood.

2181
01:38:49,237 --> 01:38:52,405
<i>Lot of good white folks
just stood there</i>

2182
01:38:52,407 --> 01:38:54,842
<i>like it was
a Fourth of July parade.</i>

2183
01:38:56,378 --> 01:38:59,179
They even let the children
out of school

2184
01:38:59,181 --> 01:39:00,815
on lunch hour.

2185
01:39:00,817 --> 01:39:02,850
Remove your hood.

2186
01:39:02,852 --> 01:39:05,820
<i>And all I could do was to...</i>

2187
01:39:05,822 --> 01:39:09,356
watch and hope

2188
01:39:09,358 --> 01:39:11,658
they wouldn't find me.

2189
01:39:32,381 --> 01:39:33,748
Come.

2190
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,883
Welcome your brethren

2191
01:39:35,885 --> 01:39:37,985
who have been baptized
by the light.

2192
01:39:37,987 --> 01:39:40,688
- Please.
- Oh, my God!

2193
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:43,423
Let's give them some applause!

2194
01:39:43,425 --> 01:39:45,492
One of the reasons
they had done that to Jesse

2195
01:39:45,494 --> 01:39:47,928
was a movie

2196
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:51,331
called <i>Birth of a Nation.</i>

2197
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:53,934
It had come out
the year before,

2198
01:39:53,936 --> 01:39:57,570
and it was so powerful

2199
01:39:57,572 --> 01:40:01,876
that it gave the Ku Klux Klan
a rebirth.

2200
01:40:01,878 --> 01:40:04,679
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

2201
01:40:04,681 --> 01:40:06,814
Oh, my God. No!

2202
01:40:06,816 --> 01:40:08,481
No!

2203
01:40:10,318 --> 01:40:11,719
Oh, look at that one!

2204
01:40:11,721 --> 01:40:14,487
Oh, he's disgusting. Oh!

2205
01:40:14,489 --> 01:40:16,726
Oh, those poor women.

2206
01:40:18,293 --> 01:40:20,293
Don't you do it! Oh!

2207
01:40:20,295 --> 01:40:21,561
- Why?
- No.

2208
01:40:21,563 --> 01:40:23,663
No. Oh!

2209
01:40:23,665 --> 01:40:27,001
The ingenuity of white women!

2210
01:40:30,539 --> 01:40:32,605
Oh!

2211
01:40:32,607 --> 01:40:35,542
<i>Today, they would call
that kind of movie</i>

2212
01:40:35,544 --> 01:40:37,310
<i>a blockbuster.</i>

2213
01:40:37,312 --> 01:40:39,479
<i>Everybody saw it.</i>

2214
01:40:39,481 --> 01:40:41,381
That's disgusting.

2215
01:40:41,383 --> 01:40:44,617
Even the president
of the United States,

2216
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:48,923
Woodrow Wilson,
showed it at the White House.

2217
01:40:50,492 --> 01:40:52,927
And he said that it was

2218
01:40:52,929 --> 01:40:56,329
"history written
with lightning."

2219
01:40:56,331 --> 01:40:59,934
What... what is really...

2220
01:40:59,936 --> 01:41:03,470
"Dem free-niggers
f'um de N'of am sho' crazy."

2221
01:41:03,472 --> 01:41:04,972
Oh, look at that
little pickaninny.

2222
01:41:07,542 --> 01:41:09,409
Watch, watch. They're gonna
scare the pickaninnies.

2223
01:41:09,411 --> 01:41:10,410
Get out of there!

2224
01:41:10,412 --> 01:41:12,612
- Move. Move.
- Get out of there!

2225
01:41:18,587 --> 01:41:21,588
The inspiration!

2226
01:41:32,434 --> 01:41:34,769
Get 'em out of there!

2227
01:41:34,771 --> 01:41:36,402
- Go get 'em!
- Go!

2228
01:41:36,404 --> 01:41:38,438
Go get 'em!

2229
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:42,609
- "The trial."
- Hey!

2230
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:44,410
- Send him to hell!
- String him up!

2231
01:41:44,412 --> 01:41:45,480
String him up!

2232
01:41:45,948 --> 01:41:46,981
Guilty!

2233
01:41:46,983 --> 01:41:48,448
Get him on that horse.

2234
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:50,617
Get him up! String him up!

2235
01:41:58,493 --> 01:42:00,493
Yeah!

2236
01:42:08,503 --> 01:42:11,604
White power!
White power! White power!

2237
01:42:11,606 --> 01:42:15,075
White power! White power!
White power!

2238
01:42:15,077 --> 01:42:19,646
That's why we're here today.

2239
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:23,650
In the name of Black Power.

2240
01:42:23,652 --> 01:42:26,020
- Yes.
- Black Power. Black Power.

2241
01:42:26,022 --> 01:42:28,923
Black Power! Black Power!

2242
01:42:28,925 --> 01:42:32,625
Black Power! Black Power!
Black Power!

2243
01:42:32,627 --> 01:42:33,626
Black Power!

2244
01:42:33,628 --> 01:42:34,762
<i>Black Power!</i>

2245
01:42:34,764 --> 01:42:36,030
<i>Black Power...</i>

2246
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,699
I'd like you to do me
a favor and...

2247
01:42:38,701 --> 01:42:41,035
just look around.

2248
01:42:41,037 --> 01:42:43,005
That's right.
Everyone just look around.

2249
01:42:44,807 --> 01:42:47,640
Today, we are privileged...

2250
01:42:47,642 --> 01:42:49,910
to be among white men.

2251
01:42:49,912 --> 01:42:51,578
And white women.

2252
01:42:53,082 --> 01:42:54,581
Such as yourselves.

2253
01:42:54,583 --> 01:42:55,683
Real warriors.

2254
01:42:55,685 --> 01:42:57,417
For the real America.

2255
01:42:57,419 --> 01:43:00,087
The America that our ancestors
fought and died for.

2256
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:03,958
The true white American race.

2257
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:07,660
The backbone from whence came
our great Southern heritage.

2258
01:43:09,031 --> 01:43:10,831
And I want to thank you.

2259
01:43:10,833 --> 01:43:12,700
Jesus Christ.

2260
01:43:12,702 --> 01:43:15,535
I want to thank you so much

2261
01:43:15,537 --> 01:43:17,838
for never putting
your country second.

2262
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,606
That's right.

2263
01:43:19,608 --> 01:43:21,976
- America first.
- America first.

2264
01:43:21,978 --> 01:43:23,811
America first.

2265
01:43:23,813 --> 01:43:26,847
America first! America first!

2266
01:43:26,849 --> 01:43:31,584
America first! America first!
America first!

2267
01:43:31,586 --> 01:43:36,223
America first!
America first! America first!

2268
01:43:36,225 --> 01:43:38,192
America first!

2269
01:43:38,194 --> 01:43:41,628
America first! America first!

2270
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:43,898
America first!

2271
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,833
Ain't this a bitch.

2272
01:43:45,835 --> 01:43:48,235
If I would have known
this was a Klan meeting,

2273
01:43:48,237 --> 01:43:51,471
I wouldn't have taken
this motherfucking gig.

2274
01:43:51,473 --> 01:43:53,841
Goddamn.

2275
01:43:53,843 --> 01:43:55,910
Right on, right on.

2276
01:43:55,912 --> 01:43:57,778
All right, now, when are
you boys gonna invite me

2277
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:59,579
down to Louisiana? Hmm?

2278
01:43:59,581 --> 01:44:01,749
- We'd certainly love to have you.
- Mmm.

2279
01:44:01,751 --> 01:44:03,583
Still a lot of work to be done.
I mean, you've done

2280
01:44:03,585 --> 01:44:05,052
a great job whipping up
this chapter, but...

2281
01:44:05,054 --> 01:44:06,854
Well, I could do a great job
on a national level.

2282
01:44:06,856 --> 01:44:07,888
Excuse me.

2283
01:44:07,890 --> 01:44:09,056
Walter, may I?

2284
01:44:09,058 --> 01:44:10,758
Behave yourself.

2285
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,260
Mr. Duke,
I just want to say how...

2286
01:44:13,262 --> 01:44:15,863
honored my wife, Connie,
and I are

2287
01:44:15,865 --> 01:44:17,965
for being in your presence.

2288
01:44:17,967 --> 01:44:19,133
What's your name, friend?

2289
01:44:19,135 --> 01:44:20,500
Felix.

2290
01:44:20,502 --> 01:44:23,203
Felix, the pleasure's all mine.

2291
01:44:23,205 --> 01:44:25,806
We'd love to have you out at
the house for dinner sometime.

2292
01:44:25,808 --> 01:44:27,174
We Coloradans can cook
just as good

2293
01:44:27,176 --> 01:44:28,943
as those Cajun ladies
you got down there.

2294
01:44:28,945 --> 01:44:31,278
All right, now, Connie.

2295
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,080
We're on a very tight
schedule here,

2296
01:44:33,082 --> 01:44:35,215
but you made a mistake.
Next time I'm in town,

2297
01:44:35,217 --> 01:44:38,719
- I'm gonna hold you to that, okay?
- Oh.

2298
01:44:38,721 --> 01:44:40,120
Oh, I see Susie.

2299
01:44:40,122 --> 01:44:42,690
I'll be back in just a second.

2300
01:44:42,692 --> 01:44:44,158
Hey.

2301
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,926
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

2302
01:44:45,928 --> 01:44:46,760
- Is this your wife?
- Yep.

2303
01:44:46,762 --> 01:44:48,095
- Hey. Ron. How are you?
- Hi.

2304
01:44:48,097 --> 01:44:49,263
Nice to meet you.

2305
01:44:49,265 --> 01:44:51,198
Never seen you
dressed up before.

2306
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,766
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Felix.

2307
01:44:52,768 --> 01:44:54,569
- You have a fantastic night.
- Oh, thank you.

2308
01:44:56,806 --> 01:44:59,075
Amer... America first.

2309
01:45:00,608 --> 01:45:01,875
Hey, Ron, how you doing?

2310
01:45:01,877 --> 01:45:03,110
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Good.

2311
01:45:03,112 --> 01:45:05,611
- He's a cop.
- Who?

2312
01:45:05,613 --> 01:45:07,114
- That guy.
- Ron?

2313
01:45:07,116 --> 01:45:09,817
- No, the other guy.
- Ron's a cop?

2314
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:12,820
His name is Phillip,
but his nickname is Flip.

2315
01:45:12,822 --> 01:45:15,122
- Who's Phillip?
- Who's Ron? That's Phillip.

2316
01:45:15,124 --> 01:45:16,824
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- That guy.

2317
01:45:16,826 --> 01:45:19,193
That's the cop that sent me
to the fucking big house

2318
01:45:19,195 --> 01:45:20,961
for armed fucking robbery.

2319
01:45:20,963 --> 01:45:23,297
His fucking name is Phillip.
Phillip Zimmerman.

2320
01:45:23,299 --> 01:45:24,965
- What's his name?
- Phillip Zimmerman.

2321
01:45:24,967 --> 01:45:27,034
How many times
I gotta fucking tell you?

2322
01:45:27,036 --> 01:45:29,336
Isn't that a fucking Jew name?

2323
01:45:29,338 --> 01:45:30,503
You can't go by that.

2324
01:45:30,505 --> 01:45:32,840
Jews change their name
all the time to non-Jew names.

2325
01:45:32,842 --> 01:45:34,877
I mean,
they killed Jesus, right?

2326
01:45:36,212 --> 01:45:40,014
Ron Stallworth
is a fucking Jew.

2327
01:45:40,016 --> 01:45:41,581
Could've been worse.

2328
01:45:41,583 --> 01:45:43,217
How so?

2329
01:45:43,219 --> 01:45:44,752
Could've been a nigger.

2330
01:45:44,754 --> 01:45:45,919
Yeah.

2331
01:45:45,921 --> 01:45:47,921
They built this stuff out of...

2332
01:45:47,923 --> 01:45:49,223
Uh, it starts to dissolve.

2333
01:45:49,225 --> 01:45:51,025
It wasn't water, you know.

2334
01:45:51,027 --> 01:45:52,660
The beads take the...

2335
01:45:53,863 --> 01:45:55,095
He is a nigger.

2336
01:45:55,097 --> 01:45:56,629
Who?

2337
01:45:56,631 --> 01:45:59,301
That cop guarding Duke.

2338
01:46:01,037 --> 01:46:02,668
Zimmerman's using his name.

2339
01:46:02,670 --> 01:46:04,071
I guess I could use mops.

2340
01:46:04,073 --> 01:46:05,339
Shall we tell the Grand Wizard?

2341
01:46:05,341 --> 01:46:07,341
No, no, no. Not yet.

2342
01:46:07,343 --> 01:46:09,311
I'll find the moment.

2343
01:46:10,612 --> 01:46:12,046
Okay.

2344
01:46:12,048 --> 01:46:13,849
Fucking Jew.

2345
01:46:15,885 --> 01:46:18,118
Yeah, I know. We have
a strong future in America.

2346
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:20,020
I'm so glad I made this trip.

2347
01:46:20,022 --> 01:46:21,755
- With all these chapters...
- Well, that's what we

2348
01:46:21,757 --> 01:46:23,290
- have to work on.
- Uh, excuse me, gentlemen.

2349
01:46:23,292 --> 01:46:25,359
Hi.

2350
01:46:25,361 --> 01:46:27,728
Uh, Mr. Duke...

2351
01:46:27,730 --> 01:46:29,163
favor to ask.

2352
01:46:29,165 --> 01:46:30,998
Nobody's gonna believe me
when I tell them

2353
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,634
that I was your personal
bodyguard today.

2354
01:46:34,636 --> 01:46:37,137
Care to take a Polaroid
with me?

2355
01:46:37,139 --> 01:46:40,707
I don't know.
Do those cool shades come off?

2356
01:46:40,709 --> 01:46:42,076
Oh, yes, sir, they do.

2357
01:46:42,078 --> 01:46:43,710
- Okay.
- There we go.

2358
01:46:43,712 --> 01:46:45,279
Hey, Jesse. Let's do this.
It'll be right.

2359
01:46:45,281 --> 01:46:46,747
- Oh.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2360
01:46:46,749 --> 01:46:48,749
- Who should, uh...
- Oh, what...

2361
01:46:48,751 --> 01:46:51,085
- Uh, what's his name?
- Uh, Ron.

2362
01:46:51,087 --> 01:46:53,387
- Uh, Stallworth.
- Ron. Ron, sir.

2363
01:46:53,389 --> 01:46:55,291
Can you take this picture
of us, please?

2364
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:02,131
All right, don't touch me.

2365
01:47:03,933 --> 01:47:05,365
Great.

2366
01:47:05,367 --> 01:47:06,900
- All right.
- All right.

2367
01:47:06,902 --> 01:47:08,869
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

2368
01:47:08,871 --> 01:47:10,139
Here we go. One.

2369
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,674
Two. Three.

2370
01:47:13,676 --> 01:47:16,343
Jesus H. Christ!

2371
01:47:20,015 --> 01:47:22,716
What did you just do, boy?

2372
01:47:22,718 --> 01:47:24,220
I mean...

2373
01:47:25,688 --> 01:47:27,688
What the hell did you just do?

2374
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:30,090
Sir, if you lay a finger on me,
I'll arrest your ass

2375
01:47:30,092 --> 01:47:31,458
for assaulting
a police officer.

2376
01:47:33,462 --> 01:47:36,098
That's worth about five years
in prison.

2377
01:47:37,299 --> 01:47:39,867
Try me.
See if I'm playing.

2378
01:47:39,869 --> 01:47:42,936
Why don't you come down
to Louisiana sometime?

2379
01:47:42,938 --> 01:47:44,940
See how we play.

2380
01:47:46,842 --> 01:47:49,977
Boy, you better get your
nigger ass out of here now.

2381
01:47:49,979 --> 01:47:52,212
Mm-hmm.

2382
01:47:52,214 --> 01:47:55,117
America first.

2383
01:47:56,452 --> 01:47:57,951
Excuse me.

2384
01:47:57,953 --> 01:47:59,321
May I? Thanks.

2385
01:48:01,857 --> 01:48:03,190
- You ready?
- What, now?

2386
01:48:03,192 --> 01:48:04,894
Don't be nervous.

2387
01:48:06,262 --> 01:48:09,062
- Okay.
- I'm leaving.

2388
01:48:09,064 --> 01:48:10,797
- Remember what we talked about.
- Okay.

2389
01:48:10,799 --> 01:48:13,167
Come here.

2390
01:48:13,169 --> 01:48:15,269
Now you may do your job.

2391
01:48:15,271 --> 01:48:17,106
- Okay.
- Nice and easy does it.

2392
01:48:21,243 --> 01:48:23,112
Excuse me.

2393
01:48:24,413 --> 01:48:26,081
Excuse me.

2394
01:48:36,825 --> 01:48:38,091
Attention, all units.

2395
01:48:38,093 --> 01:48:40,394
Be on the lookout
for a brown truck

2396
01:48:40,396 --> 01:48:41,995
with a "white pride"
bumper sticker.

2397
01:48:41,997 --> 01:48:45,332
License plate: KE4108.

2398
01:48:53,142 --> 01:48:55,342
Kills this big rat
in the back of our backyard.

2399
01:48:55,344 --> 01:48:56,843
And I actually start to like

2400
01:48:56,845 --> 01:48:58,111
the fucking thing
for the first time.

2401
01:48:58,113 --> 01:48:59,479
I shit you not,
three days later,

2402
01:48:59,481 --> 01:49:01,181
this little Girl Scout
comes to our door...

2403
01:49:01,183 --> 01:49:03,016
Ron, hmm?

2404
01:49:03,018 --> 01:49:05,252
I believe you know my friend.

2405
01:49:05,254 --> 01:49:06,722
Who's your friend?

2406
01:49:08,357 --> 01:49:10,524
Hey.

2407
01:49:10,526 --> 01:49:12,226
No, sorry, I don't think
we've met before.

2408
01:49:12,228 --> 01:49:13,060
Ron Stallworth.

2409
01:49:13,062 --> 01:49:15,464
Yeah? It's been
a few years, right?

2410
01:49:16,899 --> 01:49:18,934
- Been a few years?
- Yeah.

2411
01:49:20,569 --> 01:49:22,970
No, I'm sorry.
I don't think I can place you.

2412
01:49:22,972 --> 01:49:24,204
Did you two go to school
together?

2413
01:49:24,206 --> 01:49:26,173
No. I went to private school.

2414
01:49:26,175 --> 01:49:27,841
Leavenworth, Kansas.

2415
01:49:27,843 --> 01:49:30,210
Isn't that where
the federal penitentiary is?

2416
01:49:30,212 --> 01:49:31,812
Matter a fact, it is.

2417
01:49:31,814 --> 01:49:33,380
You know something about that.

2418
01:49:33,382 --> 01:49:35,449
- Don't you, Flip?
- Flip?

2419
01:49:35,451 --> 01:49:36,850
Excuse me, gentlemen.

2420
01:49:36,852 --> 01:49:38,285
There is an emergency
phone call

2421
01:49:38,287 --> 01:49:40,789
in the hallway
for a Felix Kendrickson.

2422
01:49:42,191 --> 01:49:44,793
I'll be right back, Flip.

2423
01:49:58,941 --> 01:50:00,607
Hello?

2424
01:50:00,609 --> 01:50:02,075
Felix.

2425
01:50:02,077 --> 01:50:03,176
Jesus, they've got cops
everywhere.

2426
01:50:03,178 --> 01:50:04,878
Somebody tipped them off.

2427
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:07,114
Oh, God, there's another one!

2428
01:50:07,116 --> 01:50:08,315
Calm down, baby.

2429
01:50:08,317 --> 01:50:10,150
We planned for this, all right?

2430
01:50:10,152 --> 01:50:12,486
We'll go to plan B, okay?

2431
01:50:12,488 --> 01:50:14,021
Okay, okay, okay.

2432
01:50:14,023 --> 01:50:16,156
Okay, okay, okay, plan B.

2433
01:50:16,158 --> 01:50:17,257
All right, baby?

2434
01:50:17,259 --> 01:50:18,358
You can do it.

2435
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,060
I'll be right there.

2436
01:50:20,062 --> 01:50:21,295
All right.

2437
01:50:21,297 --> 01:50:22,596
Remember when you said,

2438
01:50:22,598 --> 01:50:24,965
one day,
I'm gonna need your help?

2439
01:50:24,967 --> 01:50:26,867
This is it, baby.

2440
01:50:26,869 --> 01:50:29,002
I love you, honey bun.

2441
01:50:29,004 --> 01:50:30,406
I-I love you.

2442
01:50:36,478 --> 01:50:38,814
I can make America great again.

2443
01:50:40,182 --> 01:50:42,215
- Oh, yeah.
- We need lawyers,

2444
01:50:42,217 --> 01:50:43,650
we need doctors, and we need...

2445
01:50:49,892 --> 01:50:52,092
Excuse me, Mr. Duke.

2446
01:50:54,129 --> 01:50:55,464
Let's go.

2447
01:51:02,004 --> 01:51:04,037
Good talker.
He's a good talker.

2448
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:10,610
You'll have to excuse him,
Mr. Duke. I apologize.

2449
01:51:10,612 --> 01:51:11,880
What was that all about?

2450
01:51:13,349 --> 01:51:15,282
Why'd he keep calling you Flip?

2451
01:51:15,284 --> 01:51:17,184
We were in prison together.

2452
01:51:17,186 --> 01:51:18,686
Years ago.

2453
01:51:18,688 --> 01:51:20,253
Uh, it's an inside joke.

2454
01:51:22,224 --> 01:51:24,391
Well, I certainly hope
everything's okay.

2455
01:51:24,393 --> 01:51:27,695
Yeah, but I think he may have
violated his parole.

2456
01:51:27,697 --> 01:51:30,530
I just need to use
the restroom real quick.

2457
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,213
Hey, where's Patrice?

2458
01:51:46,215 --> 01:51:48,949
Patrice and Odetta took
Mr. Turner back to his hotel.

2459
01:51:48,951 --> 01:51:50,550
Back up. Back up.

2460
01:51:54,556 --> 01:51:56,623
<i>Freedom. It dares to expose</i>

2461
01:51:56,625 --> 01:51:59,159
<i>the fact that not only
is this a country...</i>

2462
01:51:59,161 --> 01:52:00,494
<i>Not a white racist country.</i>

2463
01:52:00,496 --> 01:52:02,162
<i>It is a racist country.</i>

2464
01:52:02,164 --> 01:52:03,563
Indeed, it is a racist country.

2465
01:52:03,565 --> 01:52:06,902
It's an anti-white
racist country.

2466
01:52:55,484 --> 01:52:56,618
Fuck.

2467
01:53:12,234 --> 01:53:13,801
But it's so important.

2468
01:53:13,803 --> 01:53:16,336
Next time, we should work
on getting a sister in here.

2469
01:53:16,338 --> 01:53:18,071
We need to be
hearing their stories.

2470
01:53:18,073 --> 01:53:19,707
- Yep.
- We need to start doing this every week.

2471
01:53:19,709 --> 01:53:21,541
I'll reach out and see
who I can get.

2472
01:53:21,543 --> 01:53:22,978
Yeah.

2473
01:53:46,703 --> 01:53:47,802
Colorado State Police.
Don't move.

2474
01:53:47,804 --> 01:53:50,070
I said stop, damn it!

2475
01:53:50,072 --> 01:53:51,471
No! Help me!

2476
01:53:51,473 --> 01:53:52,773
Help me!

2477
01:53:52,775 --> 01:53:54,407
Help me! Help me, please!

2478
01:53:54,409 --> 01:53:55,609
Stop. Stop.

2479
01:54:01,784 --> 01:54:02,850
- Where'd you put the bomb?
- No!

2480
01:54:02,852 --> 01:54:04,651
You're hurting me!

2481
01:54:04,653 --> 01:54:06,553
Where's the bomb?
Where'd you put it?

2482
01:54:06,555 --> 01:54:08,188
- Get off me. Get off.
- Where is it?

2483
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:10,590
- Get off of me!
- Hold still. Stay still.

2484
01:54:10,592 --> 01:54:12,259
- Stay still.
- I don't know what you're talking about!

2485
01:54:12,261 --> 01:54:14,194
- Where's the bomb?
- Freeze!

2486
01:54:14,196 --> 01:54:16,563
Get off her,
or I'll fucking shoot you.

2487
01:54:16,565 --> 01:54:17,564
- Whoa.
- Get off her.

2488
01:54:17,566 --> 01:54:18,632
Okay. All right.

2489
01:54:18,634 --> 01:54:20,300
- Easy.
- I'm undercover.

2490
01:54:20,302 --> 01:54:21,568
- He's got a gun!
- I'm a cop!

2491
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:22,636
- He touched me.
- She's a terrorist.

2492
01:54:22,638 --> 01:54:23,838
That nigger attacked me.

2493
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,106
He tried to rape me.
Arrest him.

2494
01:54:26,108 --> 01:54:27,708
- I'm an undercover cop!
- Show us your badge.

2495
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:29,442
- It's in my pocket, okay?
- What are you waiting for?

2496
01:54:29,444 --> 01:54:31,211
- Show us your badge.
- It's in my pocket. Relax.

2497
01:54:31,213 --> 01:54:32,747
That nigger attacked me.
He tried to rape me.

2498
01:54:32,749 --> 01:54:34,648
- Arrest him. Arrest him!
- I'm-I'm... I'm a... I'm a cop.

2499
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:36,249
- What are you doing?
- Get on the ground now!

2500
01:54:36,251 --> 01:54:37,617
Yeah! Hit him!

2501
01:54:37,619 --> 01:54:39,519
<i>When you think about the fact</i>

2502
01:54:39,521 --> 01:54:42,656
<i>that America is still
well over 85% white,</i>

2503
01:54:42,658 --> 01:54:47,494
<i>that America was founded
exclusively by white people</i>

2504
01:54:47,496 --> 01:54:49,629

of Independence

2505
01:54:49,631 --> 01:54:52,733

that means
that the Christian Church

01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,874
that grew up in the world

2510
01:54:59,876 --> 01:55:01,174
was overwhelmingly

2511
01:55:01,176 --> 01:55:03,911
<i>a white, European phenomenon.</i>

2512
01:55:03,913 --> 01:55:06,379
<i>The magnificent beauty</i>

2513
01:55:06,381 --> 01:55:08,783

You looked good that night,

Do what?

2555
01:57:11,273 --> 01:57:14,574
Pull us over for nothing.
Harass us.

2556
01:57:14,576 --> 01:57:17,310
Put your hands all over a woman

Just like I told you, right,
he's just taking advantage.

2560

In the end,
talking loud, saying nothing.

2561
01:57:26,856 --> 01:57:28,723
Let me tell you both something.

2562
01:57:28,725 --> 01:57:31,826
I've been keeping you people
in line in this city for years.

2563

What I did to your girl
that night,

2564
01:57:33,395 --> 01:57:35,428
I could do to any of you
any time, any place.

2565
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:37,464
That's my prerogative.

2566
01:57:37,466 --> 01:57:40,034
I could even bust a cap
in your black ass

2567
01:57:40,036 --> 01:57:42,803
if I feel like it, and nothing
will be done about it.

01:57:54,249 --> 01:57:56,784
- Oh, yeah, I got it.

01:57:56,786 --> 01:57:58,853

- Oh, I really, really get it.

- Get him out of here.

01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:18,933
Yeah, well, the chief wants to
see us in his office right now.

2614
01:59:18,935 --> 01:59:20,734
- Let's go. Here, after you.
- Let's go. No, after you.

2615
01:59:20,736 --> 01:59:22,535
- Come on.
- You're the man of the hour.

2616
01:59:22,537 --> 01:59:26,406
I cannot commend you enough
for what you have achieved.

2617
01:59:26,408 --> 01:59:28,541
Do you realize there was
not one cross burning

2618
01:59:28,543 --> 01:59:30,077
the entire time
you guys were involved?

2619
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:31,611
We're very aware, Chief.

2620
01:59:31,613 --> 01:59:34,581
But all good things
have to come to an end.

2621
01:59:34,583 --> 01:59:35,783
What does that mean?

2622
01:59:35,785 --> 01:59:38,618
- Budget cuts.
- Budget cuts?

2623
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:40,688
And when did this happen?
Last night?

2624
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:42,957
I wish I had a choice,
but my hands are tied

2625
01:59:42,959 --> 01:59:44,591
with this inflation.

2626
01:59:44,593 --> 01:59:45,993
Besides,
there no longer appears

2627
01:59:45,995 --> 01:59:47,429
to be any credible threats.

2628
01:59:48,764 --> 01:59:50,731
Sounds like we did
too good a job.

2629
01:59:50,733 --> 01:59:53,102
Well, that's not
a bad legacy to leave.

2630
01:59:54,871 --> 01:59:57,104
And now...

2631
01:59:57,106 --> 02:00:00,506
I need you, Ron Stallworth,

2632
02:00:00,508 --> 02:00:03,576
to destroy all evidence
of this investigation.

2633
02:00:03,578 --> 02:00:04,577
What?

2634
02:00:04,579 --> 02:00:07,915
We prefer that the public

2635
02:00:07,917 --> 02:00:10,017
never knew about
this investigation.

2636
02:00:10,019 --> 02:00:11,685
Uh-huh.

2637
02:00:11,687 --> 02:00:15,089
Cease all further contact
with the Ku Klux Klan,

2638
02:00:15,091 --> 02:00:17,024
effective immediately.

2639
02:00:17,026 --> 02:00:19,492
That goes for you, too, Flip.

2640
02:00:19,494 --> 02:00:21,596
This is total horseshit.

2641
02:00:22,865 --> 02:00:24,664
Fucking shenanigans.

2642
02:00:24,666 --> 02:00:26,066
Aye, aye, Chief.

2643
02:00:26,068 --> 02:00:27,935
Subterfuge.

2644
02:00:27,937 --> 02:00:30,237
- Skulduggery.
- Hey, Ron.

2645
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:31,939
Take a week off.

2646
02:00:31,941 --> 02:00:34,808
Take your girlfriend,
Patrice, on a vacation.

2647
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:36,911
Live it up a little.
You worked hard.

2648
02:00:36,913 --> 02:00:38,913
When you come back,
we can discuss

2649
02:00:38,915 --> 02:00:40,415
maybe a new assignment, Ron.

2650
02:00:41,549 --> 02:00:43,152
How about Narcotics?

2651
02:02:00,229 --> 02:02:02,296
Mr. Duke,
I'm so sorry we didn't get

2652
02:02:02,298 --> 02:02:04,331
to spend more
one-on-one time together.

2653
02:02:04,333 --> 02:02:06,033
Well, that was a...

2654
02:02:07,169 --> 02:02:08,668
...just a tragedy.

2655
02:02:08,670 --> 02:02:10,738
I had just met

2656
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:14,074
those heroic brothers
in the cause.

2657
02:02:16,712 --> 02:02:19,046
"Heroic."

2658
02:02:19,048 --> 02:02:21,115
Yeah.

2659
02:02:21,117 --> 02:02:24,084
And the chapter
is just shaken at the core.

2660
02:02:24,086 --> 02:02:25,819
- Oh.
- Yeah.

2661
02:02:25,821 --> 02:02:27,254
And poor Connie, right?

2662
02:02:27,256 --> 02:02:29,957
I mean, not only does she
lose her husband, but...

2663
02:02:29,959 --> 02:02:31,258
Poor Connie.

2664
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:33,027
She's looking
at serious prison time.

2665
02:02:33,029 --> 02:02:35,062
- Connie's going away.
- We feel bad for Connie.

2666
02:02:35,064 --> 02:02:37,231
My God.

2667
02:02:37,233 --> 02:02:40,234
And then there was
that nigger detective.

2668
02:02:40,236 --> 02:02:42,002
Basically...

2669
02:02:42,004 --> 02:02:45,305
Shut the fuck up. Shut the
fuck up. Shut up, shut up.

2670
02:02:45,307 --> 02:02:47,374
Those goddamn coloreds.

2671
02:02:47,376 --> 02:02:50,144
They sure know how to spoil a celebration.

2672
02:02:50,146 --> 02:02:51,678
Hey, you're getting me
in trouble.

2673
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:53,280
Christ, you can say that again.

2674
02:02:53,282 --> 02:02:56,183
Those goddamn... coloreds

2675
02:02:56,185 --> 02:02:58,252
sure know how to spoil
a celebration.

2676
02:02:58,254 --> 02:03:00,821
Can I ask you a question, sir?

2677
02:03:00,823 --> 02:03:02,056
Shoot.

2678
02:03:02,058 --> 02:03:05,159
That nigger detective,
did you ever...

2679
02:03:05,161 --> 02:03:06,794
did you ever get his name?

2680
02:03:06,796 --> 02:03:08,829
No. I don't think I...

2681
02:03:08,831 --> 02:03:11,331
Are-uh you sure
you don't know who he is?

2682
02:03:16,138 --> 02:03:20,107
Are-uh you absolutely sure?

2683
02:03:20,109 --> 02:03:23,343
'Cause that nigga, coon,
gator bait,

2684
02:03:23,345 --> 02:03:27,347
spade, spook, Sambo,
spear-chucking jungle bunny,

2685
02:03:27,349 --> 02:03:29,416
Mississippi wind chime...

2686
02:03:29,418 --> 02:03:31,285
- Wind chime?
- ...detective...

2687
02:03:31,287 --> 02:03:34,288
is Ron Stallworth,
you racist, peckerwood,

2688
02:03:34,290 --> 02:03:38,692
redneck, inch worm,
needle-dick motherfucker!

2689
02:03:40,763 --> 02:03:42,930
Oh! Oh!

2690
02:03:42,932 --> 02:03:45,132
I'll be here all week.

2691
02:03:58,447 --> 02:04:00,714
Ron Stallworth,

2692
02:04:00,716 --> 02:04:02,650
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

2693
02:04:16,065 --> 02:04:17,965
What are you doing?

2694
02:04:17,967 --> 02:04:19,199
Nothing.

2695
02:04:19,201 --> 02:04:21,802
Finishing up.

2696
02:04:21,804 --> 02:04:24,938
Have you handed in
your resignation from the KKK?

2697
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:26,373
Affirmative.

2698
02:04:26,375 --> 02:04:28,208
Have you handed in
your resignation

2699
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:30,279
from the Colorado Springs
Police Department?

2700
02:04:32,414 --> 02:04:34,448
Negative.

2701
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:38,919
Truth be told, Patrice,
I always wanted to be a cop,

2702
02:04:38,921 --> 02:04:43,757
and I'm still for
the liberation of my people.

2703
02:04:43,759 --> 02:04:45,926
My conscience won't let me
sleep with the enemy.

2704
02:04:45,928 --> 02:04:47,394
Enemy?

2705
02:04:47,396 --> 02:04:49,463
No, I'm the black man
that saved your life.

2706
02:04:49,465 --> 02:04:51,131
- You're absolutely right.
- Right.

2707
02:04:51,133 --> 02:04:53,467
And I thank you for it, but...

2708
02:04:53,469 --> 02:04:55,304
I can't do this.

2709
02:04:57,239 --> 02:04:59,273
I think we should...
we should talk.

2710
02:05:03,345 --> 02:05:04,947
It's okay. It's okay.

2711
02:05:07,349 --> 02:05:09,251
I said it's o...

2712
02:06:14,416 --> 02:06:18,852
<i>Blood and soil! Blood and soil!</i>

2713
02:06:18,854 --> 02:06:20,320
<i>Blood and soil!</i>

2714
02:06:20,322 --> 02:06:24,491
Blood and soil! Blood and soil!

2715
02:06:24,493 --> 02:06:26,560
Blood and soil!

2716
02:06:26,562 --> 02:06:28,962
Jews will not replace us!

2717
02:06:28,964 --> 02:06:32,299
Jews will not
replace us!

2718
02:06:32,301 --> 02:06:35,002
Jews will not replace us!

2719
02:06:35,004 --> 02:06:38,438
Jews will not
replace us!

2720
02:06:40,276 --> 02:06:43,110
White lives matter!
White lives matter!

2721
02:06:43,112 --> 02:06:44,344
White lives matter!

2722
02:06:44,346 --> 02:06:46,880
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

2723
02:06:46,882 --> 02:06:48,150
Black lives matter!

2724
02:07:07,303 --> 02:07:09,403
What the fuck, man?

2725
02:07:09,405 --> 02:07:11,438
You had a group
on one side that was bad,

2726
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,340
and you had a group
on the other side

2727
02:07:13,342 --> 02:07:15,542
that was also very violent.

2728
02:07:15,544 --> 02:07:17,044
Nazis, go home!

2729
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:18,612
Not all of those people

2730
02:07:18,614 --> 02:07:20,614
were neo-Nazis, believe me.

2731
02:07:20,616 --> 02:07:23,250
Not all of those people
were white supremacists.

2732
02:07:23,252 --> 02:07:27,888
You also had people
that were very fine people.

2733
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:31,358
Because I believe that today
in Charlottesville,

2734
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:36,430
this is a first step
toward making a realization

2735
02:07:36,432 --> 02:07:38,165
of something that Trump
alluded to

2736
02:07:38,167 --> 02:07:41,201
earlier in the campaign,
which is...

2737
02:07:41,203 --> 02:07:45,372
This is the first step
toward taking America back.

2738
02:07:47,009 --> 02:07:48,508
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

2739
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:49,643
Whose streets?

2740
02:07:49,645 --> 02:07:50,944
Our streets!

2741
02:07:50,946 --> 02:07:53,080
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

2742
02:07:56,585 --> 02:07:59,988
Holy shit! Holy shit!

2743
02:08:15,371 --> 02:08:17,104
I had to jump out of the way.

2744
02:08:17,106 --> 02:08:19,406
I almost got hit by the car
my fucking self.

2745
02:08:22,111 --> 02:08:24,611
There are people... bodies
laying on the ground right now.

2746
02:08:24,613 --> 02:08:27,080
Oh, my God!
We got hit by a car!

2747
02:08:27,082 --> 02:08:29,684
And there was a woman, uh,
laying there, hardly breathing,

2748
02:08:29,686 --> 02:08:33,053
and, uh, we ended up
rolling her over, and she died.

2749
02:08:33,055 --> 02:08:36,258
This is my town! We did not
want them motherfuckers here!
