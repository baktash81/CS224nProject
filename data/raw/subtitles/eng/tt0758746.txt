1
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:45,151
Come here. Come here now.

2
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:49,463
You're the last one.

3
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,195
I've killed all the others.

4
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:55,736
It'll be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

5
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,468
Why are you doing this?

6
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,132
You need to be punished
for what you did to him.

7
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:04,296
- I didn't do anything.
- You let him drown.

8
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:09,277
- Jason was my son.
- I didn't do anything.

9
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,960
No. No. No. Please.

10
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,856
You should have been watching him.

11
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,854
Every minute.

12
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,100
Jason.

13
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,940
My special, special boy.

14
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,743
They must be punished, Jason,
for what they did to you.

15
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,035
For what they did to me.

16
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,350
Kill for Mother.

17
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,555
I'm serious.

18
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,642
You gotta watch out for
mountain lions. They're all over.

19
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,478
- Mountain lions?
- We'll be fine. They're afraid of fire.

20
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,730
Dude, shut the fuck up.
I'm calling bullshit.

21
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,232
Richie's gonna call bullshit.

22
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,359
- Bullshit!
- Richie's calling bullshit.

23
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,110
- I'm not bullshitting.
- Bullshit.

24
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,321
You'll see when a mountain
lion comes out...

25
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,323
- Dude, there's one right there!
- Nice try.

26
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,410
I am more afraid to be
eaten by mosquitoes.

27
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,247
Hey, you wanna slap that ass
one more time for Daddy?

28
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,400
- Did Daddy like that?
- Yeah, Daddy does like it. A lot.

29
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,003
Whitney? Where are you right now?

30
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,713
- I'm here.
- Are you?

31
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,950
I'm here. Right in the
middle of nowhere.

32
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,429
- Hey, are you reading that right?
- I'm reading it right.

33
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,932
- Come on, Pizarro, let's go.
- Where are we going?

34
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,710
- These are heavy and it's hot.
- Where are we?

35
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,943
Dude, we are way the fuck off.

36
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,444
- No, we're not, act...
- Yes.

37
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,781
No, we're not. Not everything
shows up on GPS, Richie.

38
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,534
A sign said there was a mine
here. Did that come up?

39
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,577
No. We're close, I think.

40
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,330
You think? Dude, you don't
know how to use this thing.

41
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,499
It's almost dark. Do
you know where it is?

42
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,294
Look, I didn't plant
this shit, Richie, okay?

43
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,380
I got this tip from a secondhand
source. We should be close.

44
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,507
Look, we're gonna stop here.

45
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:03,261
Tomorrow morning, you and me, we get
up at dawn. We go, we find the crop.

46
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,347
We cut down as much as we can.
We ditch it in the truck.

47
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,516
- Back here before breakfast, okay?
- Hey.

48
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,977
- Guys. Guys.
- Nobody knows a thing.

49
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,855
There's a perfect spot here.
It's already been cleared.

50
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,858
Perfect. We'll camp here.

51
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:20,570
Hey. Do you know how much money
we're gonna make selling this weed?

52
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:24,574
- A lot of fucking money.
- Yeah, okay? So listen to me. Relax.

53
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,326
- I am. You wanna know why?
- Why?

54
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,286
- You know what rich people do?
- What?

55
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,872
They relax. You need
to fucking relax.

56
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,984
- I need to relax?
- You need to relax.

57
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,287
Hey, guys. Guys.

58
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:50,516
I just found some broken-down cabins
over there. It's gotta be the old camp.

59
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,435
Who wants to go check it out?

60
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,729
Is this all we brought
to drink? No Heineken?

61
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,105
Fuck that Euro shit.

62
00:05:56,106 --> 00:06:00,109
This is Pabst Blue American
Ribbon, my friend.

63
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,847
You do realize this camp was
closed down, like, 20 years ago?

64
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,449
Some woman, she went fucking nuts.

65
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,201
Killed all these counselors.

66
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,787
Blamed them for her son's
drowning. He was like...

67
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,498
deformed or retarded or something.

68
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,525
Really?

69
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,153
Mom got hers.

70
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,755
Apparently there was one survivor.

71
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,632
This girl...

72
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,968
she cut that lady's head
off with a machete.

73
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,553
It gets weirder.

74
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,472
I'm sure it does.

75
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:33,543
Her son, Jason...

76
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,047
he came back.

77
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,384
He was actually there.

78
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,388
He watched his mom being beheaded.

79
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,991
A friend of mine, he went
to camp around here...

80
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,035
- Oh, jeez.
- He went to camp around here.

81
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,288
He said the cops came. They were
looking for that Jason guy.

82
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,233
All right, you know what?

83
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,085
- Don't believe me.
- Nobody does.

84
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,337
But I'm pretty sure, the
way the story goes...

85
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,840
the place was called
Camp Crystal Lake.

86
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,884
Do you know how many lakes are
probably called Crystal Lake?

87
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,179
It's like Crystal Geyser, Crystal
Water. Go to a supermarket.

88
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,807
Every single bottle of water
is "Crystal" something.

89
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,142
- Aquafina.
- The...

90
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,601
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

91
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,856
The story could have happened anywhere.
It's how they get kids to shit themselves.

92
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,650
- How's that beer, beer-snob?
- Better than my own piss.

93
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,487
You can drink that, by the way. Yours,
hers, mine. I swear, piss is sterile.

94
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,282
- You will never drink my piss.
- That's what you think.

95
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,351
What about me?

96
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,981
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Mm-hm.

97
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,208
I got marshmallow on my knee.

98
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,085
- Where you guys going?
- Go make out.

99
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,545
Oh, yeah?

100
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,088
- Hey, Mikey?
- Sweet.

101
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,574
Wear a condom.

102
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,119
An extra small one.

103
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,472
I get it, dude. You do what
you gotta do to survive.

104
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:57,226
If we were all out here starving
to death and you were dead...

105
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,644
I'd eat your leg.

106
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,063
- That's really sweet. Yeah.
- Thank you.

107
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:05,468
Why would you eat my leg, man? I can
teach you how to fish. Just go fishing.

108
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,320
I don't eat fish.

109
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,113
That's not what you told me.

110
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,191
Listen...

111
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,211
I don't think I'm gonna
stay the whole time.

112
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,379
Did Wade's story scare you?

113
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,424
Please.

114
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,410
I just...

115
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,205
I don't feel right being here...

116
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,390
so far away from my mom.

117
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:40,311
Your mom was the one that told me to
get you out of town for a few days.

118
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,214
- Really?
- Yeah.

119
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,677
And she's in good hands. She's
got her nurse right there.

120
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,155
Come on.

121
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:56,186
Have sex with your boyfriend
in a cramped little tent.

122
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,957
We can get hammered, blow
some chunks in the woods.

123
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,777
Then we can go back Monday
and deal with whatever.

124
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,825
Hey.

125
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,681
I'm a fucking idiot.

126
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,458
Richie?

127
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:23,396
- The ephemeris data just didn't sync up.
- Oh, dude, that sucks.

128
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,715
Fucking right.

129
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,402
- Do you know what this means?
- I wanna...

130
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,096
What?

131
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,323
We're, like... We're,
like, a half mile away.

132
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,894
- Less.
- Shut up.

133
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:42,816
You know what makes me happy,
Richie? Global positioning systems.

134
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,734
GPS to the layperson.

135
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,044
NASA technology...

136
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,964
in the palm of your hand. Know
what this little fucker does?

137
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,841
This guy sends a signal
up into outer space.

138
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,052
Signal.

139
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,971
Satellite gets it, turns it around.

140
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,417
It's like, "Oh, thank you, GPS.
I'm gonna send a signal to you."

141
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,102
Back to the palm of your hand.
Technology, man.

142
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,605
It is un-fucking-believable.

143
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:09,843
Wade, you gotta bounce, dude.
Tell your dumb shit to somebody else.

144
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,096
Why, because I'm fucking
teaching you something?

145
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,244
Say, Richie, old buddy,
I'm gonna bounce.

146
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,705
- You do that, brother. Okay.
- I'm spent.

147
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,734
May the Force be
with your Schwartz.

148
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,504
You're in so much trouble.

149
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,956
Oh.

150
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,089
Fuck, yes.

151
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,645
I love you.

152
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,940
And you. And you.

153
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,999
I even love you.

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,862
Oh, my God. Look at this shit.

155
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,966
What the fuck? What the fuck?!

156
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,468
What's this? No, no! No! No!

157
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,543
That must be the camp that
Wade was talking about.

158
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,315
- Let's check it out.
- No, I wanna go this way.

159
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,443
Come on.

160
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,637
Come on.

161
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,486
Wow, look at that.

162
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,343
Mike, where are you going?

163
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,928
- Let's go inside.
- No.

164
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,347
- Where's your sense of adventure?
- Oh, come on.

165
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,308
Come on. What are you scared of?

166
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,377
No.

167
00:12:56,902 --> 00:13:00,972
I am willing to bet there's
some pretty cool shit in here.

168
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,954
Mike, don't go in there. What if
some homeless person lives here?

169
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,107
No homeless person lives here.

170
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,446
You hungry?

171
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,835
Wow.

172
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,132
Look at how old this shit is.

173
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,804
It's like it was dragged
here from another century.

174
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,489
Check this out.

175
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,598
Hey. It looks like you.

176
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,495
- No, it doesn't.
- Yeah, it does.

177
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,399
It's cool, you should keep it.

178
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,961
It's a little kid's room.

179
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,057
Wasn't Jason the name
from Wade's story?

180
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,575
- I wanna go.
- What?

181
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,577
- Like, right now.
- Oh, come on.

182
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,912
Please?

183
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:16,165
- You like that?
- Yeah. Wait for me. Wait for me.

184
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,459
- No, I think I'm gonna...
- Oh, no. Don't do that again.

185
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,086
- We'll do it at the same time.
- Hang on.

186
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,672
- I'm almost there.
- Shit. I heard something.

187
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,368
Stop it. Wait, I'm serious.

188
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,246
- What?
- I think Wade's watching us.

189
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,306
What?

190
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,751
Well, fuck it, let the perv watch.

191
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,920
Right?

192
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,631
Shit.

193
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,900
Wade.

194
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:47,096
Dude, if you're out there whacking
off, man, that is not cool.

195
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,807
Come on, dude.

196
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:53,994
I think we're good.

197
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,371
- Don't come yet.
- No, no.

198
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,122
- Tell me when you want to.
- Wait.

199
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,792
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.

200
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,781
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

201
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,285
Okay.

202
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,501
Wade!

203
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,295
I'm gonna kill you.

204
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,069
Okay?

205
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,612
- Okay?
- Okay.

206
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,140
No, go get him. Tell
him to leave us alone.

207
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,454
I'm not gonna go out
there with a boner.

208
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,400
Well, you're not getting
any until you do.

209
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,946
- Go.
- Do not move, okay?

210
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,307
Richie?

211
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,361
Richie, stop fucking around.

212
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,415
Wade.

213
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:42,170
Dude, you jump out from a tree, I'm gonna
punch you in your face, I shit you not.

214
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:48,176
Come on, man. I gotta get
back to the fucking tent.

215
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,430
Holy shit.

216
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,993
You fucking jerk,
you found the weed.

217
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,578
Wade. Wade!

218
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,759
Wade. Wade.

219
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,561
Amanda!

220
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,949
Amanda! Goddamn!

221
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,117
Richie!

222
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,079
Fuck!

223
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,629
Richie!

224
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,758
Oh, God!

225
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,435
Cool.

226
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,096
Whitney, you've gotta see this.

227
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,599
Mike. Come on.

228
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,920
No, I'm serious. You've gotta
see this. Somebody's been here.

229
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,032
What is that?

230
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,976
There's something in there.

231
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:06,564
- Looks like some kind of a doll.
- Are you crazy?

232
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,796
- Oh, my God! Ah!
- Ah!

233
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,413
There's something out there.

234
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,419
- Stay here.
- No.

235
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,666
Ah! Oh, my God!

236
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,070
Get away, get back!

237
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,072
Get off the floor!

238
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,006
Holy fuck!

239
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,326
- Ah!
- Mike!

240
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:06,374
- Mike. Mike, get up. Come on.
- Go!

241
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,731
Help me!

242
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,902
- Mike! Mike!
- Run.

243
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,280
Run! Run, Whitney!

244
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,055
Oh, my God.

245
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,558
Oh, God.

246
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:24,452
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

247
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:32,184
Whitney! Whitney, help.
Whitney, please. Help!

248
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,753
Whitney! Whitney.

249
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,172
Whitney!

250
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,013
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

251
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,433
Shit.

252
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,105
Come on. Shit.

253
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,487
Oh, God. No. Come on.

254
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:45,533
Oh, my God. Babies have
more space in the uterus.

255
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:51,455
Hey, Lawrence, how
about a little help?

256
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:57,002
Dude, you're gonna ask the one black
guy to pump the gas for you? Shit.

257
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,521
Okay. Nolan.

258
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,715
How about I pay, you pump?

259
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,734
Sure, man. Hey, I give
a wicked blow job too.

260
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:08,430
Okay, well, um, we'll
try that out later.

261
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:16,605
Whoa. Hey, bro, that's... I have a
heart murmur. What are you doing?

262
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,502
- Thank you.
- Where'd you get a knapsack like that?

263
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,881
It was a present, actually.
But I'm looking for my sister.

264
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,617
She's gone missing, about
a month and a half ago.

265
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:33,221
My parent's cabin is stocked. You
think you're actually gonna get laid?

266
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,724
Your parents do not
have Combos or Funyuns.

267
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:38,393
They definitely don't
have Fritos. And this is...

268
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,728
not for sex.

269
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:43,299
- What are you gonna use them for?
- It's an experiment.

270
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:47,068
Okay. So just get behind me. I'm
not gonna pay for that shit.

271
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,530
Would you mind if I maybe just put a
flyer in the window or something?

272
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,601
Oh, I heard about that. That's sad.

273
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:57,329
If it was up to me, you could wallpaper
the whole place with them...

274
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,498
but the owner makes the rules.

275
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,082
And he's a real:

276
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:05,712
Um...

277
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:10,091
Well, is he here? Maybe I could talk to him.
Maybe if he understands the situation...

278
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,593
Are you gonna buy something?

279
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:15,748
I mean, you've been up here for
quite a while yapping, So...

280
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,683
Sure. Yeah.

281
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:22,338
Thanks. So we have two
waters and some gas.

282
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,606
Two waters and some gas.

283
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,759
Guess I'm an asshole.

284
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,696
You okay, bro? Is everything good?

285
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,615
Yeah, everything's fine. Thanks.

286
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,684
But I'm not your bro.

287
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,620
So you don't wanna be friends?
You don't wanna hang out?

288
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:41,690
- Let it go, Trent.
- It's not me. This guy's being a dick.

289
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,818
Yeah, it's me. Obviously,
I'm the one being a dick.

290
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,128
Sir, thank you very much anyways.

291
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,240
- Yep.
- I'm sorry.

292
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,035
Thank you.

293
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,128
Seat belts.

294
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,089
Welcome back, Clay.

295
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,191
You mean that, Officer Bracke?

296
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,694
Son, I know you think
we're not on your side...

297
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:56,432
that we're just a bunch of
dumb country hicks out here.

298
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,577
I put two 10-year
veterans on that case.

299
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:05,081
We did three dozen interviews and ran
a county-wide search for your sister.

300
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:08,168
You know how many thousands of
people disappear every year...

301
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,696
even in this state alone?

302
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,090
But there's no evidence that
anything happened to Whitney...

303
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:19,538
or any of those other kids at Crystal
Lake. There's no car, no witnesses.

304
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,082
Nothing.

305
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,962
One of those kids was
her boyfriend, right?

306
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,964
Right.

307
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,924
Well...

308
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,178
they probably just
took off together.

309
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,781
Our mother just died of cancer.
Did I tell you that?

310
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:40,934
- No, sir.
- Well, she did.

311
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,162
She was sick for a long time...

312
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:48,400
and Whitney took care of
her every single day.

313
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,321
And then my sister didn't
show up for the funeral.

314
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:58,118
See, you just don't know my
sister. That's not possible.

315
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,745
Well...

316
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:02,164
she's not here, son.

317
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:07,419
Might wanna try looking someplace else.
That's what the other families are doing.

318
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,703
- Can you say that with a...?
- Wow.

319
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,871
Can you say that with
a little more hatred?

320
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,191
- Nice.
- Shit.

321
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,630
Sir Lancelot, thank you.

322
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,799
- Oh, man down.
- Take it easy, guys.

323
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,135
Is anyone getting a
signal out here?

324
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:43,430
Are you fucking with me? I got
business I gotta do this weekend.

325
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:44,848
What business?

326
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:46,975
Music. I'm trying to start a label.

327
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,545
Oh, yeah? Like what kind? Like rap?

328
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,006
Why you gotta go racial?

329
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,650
Look, don't put me
in a box, all right?

330
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,653
What, because I'm black I
can't listen to Green Day?

331
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,489
You're right, that was dumb.
So, what kind of music?

332
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,891
Rap.

333
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,692
Here it is.

334
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,543
- Oh, my God.
- Yep.

335
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:16,838
All right, we have two bedrooms
upstairs. We've got one down.

336
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,174
Someone can take the couch.
It's comfy as hell.

337
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,676
- Wow.
- Nice, huh?

338
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,012
- Damn.
- That is a fierce pussy.

339
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,181
It's a bobcat. It's
my dad's first kill.

340
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,434
I didn't think this long-ass car
ride was gonna be worth it...

341
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,352
but it's kind of worth it.

342
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,021
This is bigger than the dorm.

343
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:36,300
What can I say? Hey, take your
feet off the table, please.

344
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,237
So make yourselves at home.

345
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,785
- What do you wanna do first?
- What do you wanna do?

346
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,021
Oh, well...

347
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:53,859
I brought Sweet Lucille. I think
you all need to meet her.

348
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,674
Lucille? Baby, is that you?

349
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,718
- Lawrence, you've been cheating.
- No.

350
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,221
- I saw you with a bowl the other night.
- No, you...

351
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,040
A bowl.

352
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,977
Hello?

353
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,147
Hello?

354
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,488
Hello?

355
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,866
Hello?

356
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,050
Christ.

357
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,772
- I just wanted to ask you a question.
- Hush.

358
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:18,610
I wanted to ask you if maybe
you've seen somebody.

359
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,988
My sister.

360
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,465
She came camping up around
here with some friends...

361
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,868
and she's gone missing.

362
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,956
She ain't missing. She's dead.

363
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,851
- What?
- People go missing around here...

364
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,878
they're gone for good.

365
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,564
Outsiders come, they don't
know where to walk.

366
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,149
They bring trouble.

367
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,984
We just wanna be left alone.

368
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,178
And so does he.

369
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,180
So does who?

370
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,228
Ma'am, please. So does who?

371
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:06,199
- You, baby. It's all you.
- Stop peer-pressuring me.

372
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,350
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit.

373
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:18,186
- Yes!
- My fucking eye!

374
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:22,982
Guys, watch the floor, all right,
please? That's stained oak.

375
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:27,220
- This is an outside game. Come on.
- Wait, I got foam in my contact.

376
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,562
Hey. This is a great spot.

377
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,456
Do you wanna go for a hike?
Get some exercise?

378
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:42,903
That'd be nice, but, well, I can't
exactly leave them here alone.

379
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:44,905
What are you talking about?

380
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,534
Have you seen what
they're doing inside?

381
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,970
Crazy. Some drunken hoodlums.

382
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,305
- Hoodlums?
- Hoodlums.

383
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,641
What do you think they're gonna do?

384
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,936
- I mean, steal the deer head?
- You're right.

385
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:03,606
How are they gonna pull off the getaway?
We're leaving in the same car.

386
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,525
Come on. Do you want some exercise?

387
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:08,778
Because I have this really great
move that I've been practicing...

388
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,280
and I need someone
to practice it with.

389
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,409
Very charming. Very charming.

390
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,478
Oh, come on.

391
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,455
- You wanna go on a hike?
- You like hikes now?

392
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,541
- I love hikes.
- I knew it.

393
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,777
Will you get me a beer?

394
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,436
Excuse me.

395
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,609
Sir?

396
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,779
- Hey!
- Oh, shit. Jesus.

397
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,326
Sorry.

398
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,122
Jesus Christ.

399
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,973
You're fucking lucky
there, stretch.

400
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:23,336
Came that close to hitting the start
button on the whoop-ass machine, boy.

401
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,149
Look, I didn't mean to startle you.
I was trying to get your attention.

402
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,568
This is Mr. Garikes' property.

403
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:34,572
You're lucky that old mummy fart
didn't put buckshots in your ass.

404
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,809
Somebody's been stealing
his fucking kerosene too.

405
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,661
Look, I just came in here
to ask you something, okay?

406
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,247
I'm looking for this girl.
Have you seen her?

407
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,525
She's been missing
for about a month.

408
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,528
I wish I had, man.

409
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,547
- I ain't seen her, though.
- Thanks.

410
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,408
- Take care.
- You too.

411
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,385
Shit. Hey, hey, hey.

412
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,472
I forgot, did you
wanna buy some weed?

413
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:03,851
Seriously, I found a fucking shit ton of
it growing out there. A little bushel.

414
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,354
- Sell you some.
- No. Thanks.

415
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:09,023
- You sure? I got a whole bunch of it.
- I'm good.

416
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,274
You sure?

417
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,527
It's your fucking loss, dude.

418
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:15,446
It'll fuck your shit up, boy.

419
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,906
Good times...

420
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,324
fucker.

421
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,536
Just relax, okay? These
guys are your guests.

422
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,647
If you're...

423
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:28,318
If you're not comfortable having them
here, then why did you invite them?

424
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,087
So they could admire your place?

425
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:34,616
No. I just wanted to have
a good weekend. You know?

426
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:38,745
Hey, guys. Wanna check out the
other side of the lake with us?

427
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:43,683
Um... You know what?
It's getting, you know...

428
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:47,895
No. That's okay. It's... It's okay.
It's getting kind of late.

429
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,105
- Yeah.
- Okay.

430
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,632
Take my truck.

431
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,234
- Nice.
- I trust you.

432
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,279
Can you do me a favor? Will you
take the gas cans to the boat?

433
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,866
It's on the south end of the lake.
Just take a right onto Town Road.

434
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,576
- Take a right.
- Okay, and then?

435
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,995
Why don't you just type
"boat" into the nav?

436
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,580
- Technology, right?
- See you.

437
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,900
- Have fun.
- Later.

438
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,753
Don't drive my boat.

439
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,298
I'm the only one that
drives the boat, okay?

440
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,966
Aye, aye, captain.

441
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,618
Damn straight.

442
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,474
What does that say about me
that the second Trent said...

443
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:28,561
"Don't take my boat out," it
was guaranteed that I would.

444
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,438
It means you're a sociopath.

445
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,967
Now, what does it say about
me that I find that hot?

446
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:43,184
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, but
I'm looking for my sister and...

447
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,062
Hey.

448
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:51,026
- No luck?
- No. No, not yet.

449
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,086
- May I?
- Yeah.

450
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,922
- Thank you.
- Sure.

451
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,866
She's pretty.

452
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,037
Thanks.

453
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,222
Do you wanna come in for
a second, grab a drink?

454
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,166
Uh...

455
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,769
I don't think your boyfriend
would like that too much.

456
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,687
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

457
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:16,051
And here we have the stoned
American male, foraging for food.

458
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,845
Thanks.

459
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,560
This should be interesting.

460
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,565
Hey, Trent, you remember...

461
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,942
Clay.

462
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,004
Yeah. Of course I remember Clay.

463
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,657
Why is he in my house?

464
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,634
Hey, new guy. Beer?

465
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:46,514
No, no. He's gotta get going.
You got flyers to pass out, right?

466
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,416
Yeah.

467
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:49,892
Right.

468
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,687
- Look, if you're hungry, we...
- Okay.

469
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:57,066
Look, Clay, obviously she's
just trying to be nice.

470
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:00,569
But you can't stay here. No offense,
but this is a private party.

471
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,989
- I don't know you.
- No, you don't know me.

472
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,199
That's so funny, I just said that.

473
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,618
Like two seconds ago,
that I don't know you.

474
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,289
I would probably leave soon before
I get pissed off and, you know...

475
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

476
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,042
What happens then?

477
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:18,947
Hey, look. Take it easy, Trent, all right?
I'll just... I'll walk you out.

478
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,715
Yeah.

479
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,702
Jenna. Jenna, come on.
Where you going?

480
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,102
Sorry about that.

481
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:36,105
That's all right. It's
his house, you know?

482
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,523
Where's your car?

483
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,192
I do not have a car,
but I do have her.

484
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,445
- Nice.
- Thanks.

485
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:46,324
- This thing runs?
- Yeah. Yeah, it runs.

486
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,576
So where you off to next?

487
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:52,788
I haven't been to the other side of the
lake, so I was gonna go check that out.

488
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,151
- Do you want some company?
- I'd love some company.

489
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:31,352
It's a big motherfucker, huh?

490
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,534
Fuck, yeah.

491
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,455
You hot bitch.

492
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,045
Let Daddy have a little lick.

493
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:04,844
You like that, bitch?
You know you do.

494
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,351
What the fuck was that?

495
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,901
Somebody better not be stealing
the kerosene up there.

496
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,761
Shit.

497
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,382
Gina.

498
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:27,176
It's just you, baby.

499
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,905
It's been a long time, Gina.

500
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,699
You remember that
special night we had?

501
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,076
You remember when you
took my virginity?

502
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,478
You're sexy.

503
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:42,150
You're still tight as ever. I'm
gonna fucking pound you so hard.

504
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:44,444
What the fuck?

505
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,096
What the...?

506
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,167
That shit ain't fucking right,
dude. What the fuck?

507
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:50,067
You think we should take the
boat out? He's gonna find out.

508
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,819
- I knew it.
- What?

509
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,156
You're inhibited. You talk a big game, but
inside you're just a scared little girl.

510
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:59,201
Oh, really? Oh, okay, fine.

511
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:02,329
You wanna find out who's
really scared? Let's do it.

512
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,441
All right. Let's go.

513
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,697
So you and your sister
must be pretty close.

514
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:14,133
We were pretty close when we
were younger. We kind of drifted.

515
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:17,662
I mean, I bailed when I was 17,
and she stayed with my mom.

516
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,707
She kind of had to, I guess.

517
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,335
I don't know, she's always
been the responsible one.

518
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,589
So when's the last time
you talked to her?

519
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,527
About six months ago. We
got in a fight, actually.

520
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:37,698
She called and said she wanted to see
me, said she was counting on me...

521
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,450
and I never showed.

522
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,519
Excuse me.

523
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,831
What is that?

524
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,026
It's a GPS.

525
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,752
- All right, you ready?
- Ready. Let's do it.

526
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,092
Yeah. Oh, shit.

527
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,324
Yeah.

528
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,648
Yeah.

529
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:34,004
Pick it, pick it.

530
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:36,215
Oh, you like the balls
in your hand, huh?

531
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:38,425
Which one? Which one is it?
Is that the one?

532
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,928
- Those feel good, don't they?
- That's the one.

533
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,663
Shoot.

534
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,059
Fuck.

535
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,796
One of you has gotta
shoot the boot.

536
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,188
That's you, babe.

537
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,606
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

538
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,359
You missed. I've been
carrying you the entire game.

539
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,695
- Come on, baby.
- Drink up, drink up, drink up.

540
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:02,282
<i>Shoot the boot, shoot the
boot, shoot the boot.</i>

541
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,993
Shoot the boot.

542
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:08,247
Fuck that. I'm not drinking out
of your sweaty-ass sneaker.

543
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,124
You lost 10 in a row. Shoot.

544
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,668
My house, my rules.
I'm not drinking that shit.

545
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,670
- Fine.
- Oh, no.

546
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,631
- To all the felching...
- No. No.

547
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,216
- ...welching...
- Yes.

548
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,869
pussies of the world.

549
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,873
That's disgusting.

550
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,640
Oh!

551
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,071
Yeah.

552
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,747
What are you doing, Nolan?!

553
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,550
Nolan!

554
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:24,223
Nolan. Oh, my God.

555
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,188
Nolan.

556
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,206
Oh, God. Oh, God.

557
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:34,233
Nolan?

558
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,030
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

559
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,556
What do you want from me?

560
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,308
Oh, my God.

561
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:17,628
Let's just check out this last
cabin, then we'll head back.

562
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,476
Come on.

563
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,126
You really should call the police.

564
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,171
I've already called. They're
not looking for her anymore.

565
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,366
No one is, except for me.

566
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,217
Then they should look
harder because...

567
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:31,885
Oh! Ow.

568
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,554
- You all right?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

569
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,582
- You sure?
- Yeah.

570
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,588
Let's get out of here.

571
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,717
Watch your step.

572
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,481
Give me a sec, I gotta
change out my batteries.

573
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,613
- Someone's coming.
- Oh, shit. Let's go.

574
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,251
Oh, my God.

575
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,839
Where's he going?

576
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:58,365
- Oh, my God. We gotta go.
- Shh.

577
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:00,534
- I gotta follow him.
- He had a dead body.

578
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:03,771
- We gotta go. We gotta warn my friends.
- Okay, okay.

579
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,323
- You okay?
- Yeah.

580
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,309
What is that?

581
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,481
Help!

582
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,209
Come on, let's go.

583
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,752
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

584
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,947
Help me!

585
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,937
Help me!

586
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,340
Help!

587
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:19,054
Help me!

588
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,214
Clay.

589
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,061
Shit.

590
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,627
Come on.

591
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,644
Shit.

592
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,914
Please don't hurt me.

593
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,007
It's okay.

594
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,569
Jason.

595
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,847
It's okay.

596
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,445
- This way.
- Okay.

597
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,523
In my next life...

598
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,083
I wanna come back...

599
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:03,987
as one of the buttons on the
ass pocket of her jean shorts.

600
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:09,175
- Just go over there and fucking talk to her.
- Are you kidding me?

601
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:12,746
I have a better shot at fucking
a penguin than that girl.

602
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,506
- Let's light this bad boy.
- Great.

603
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,636
Here we go.

604
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,113
Yes.

605
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,865
Hey.

606
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:35,577
Here's to Daddy's shoes
and fucking douche bags.

607
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:39,414
- Let's just all be one big happy cliché.
- Yes.

608
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:43,694
Dude, what the fuck? Please,
try not to burn down my house.

609
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,907
Did you forget how to drink that?

610
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,620
Just bring it to your lips...

611
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,748
blow...

612
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,960
and suck.

613
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:03,839
- You're really good at that.
- Mm-hm.

614
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,238
Fuck, dude! You just broke
my dad's fucking chair.

615
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,490
My fucking lip, man.

616
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:16,993
I don't care about your fucking lip.
This is a family heirloom.

617
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:20,079
- Oh, shit. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- Fuck!

618
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,166
I just... No, I can fix this.
I just need some tools.

619
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:26,252
- He can fix it.
- You better pull some MacGyver shit.

620
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,947
All right, go to the toolshed.
It's down the path.

621
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,841
Yeah, okay. I'm just...
Trent, I'm sorry, man.

622
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,426
You won't be disappointed.

623
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,095
They don't call me "wood
wizard" because I masturbate.

624
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,832
Grab a flashlight,
you fucking idiot.

625
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:40,667
Thanks.

626
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:45,230
Forget about it. He'll fix it.

627
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:47,507
Let's go finish this.

628
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:56,725
That's a ugly fucking chair anyway.

629
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:59,494
My name is Trent. My daddy
bent me over this chair...

630
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:02,731
and beat me when I was little,
so you need to fix it.

631
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,367
Hey, now.

632
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,745
Yes.

633
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,880
You people are rich.

634
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,440
Holy crap.

635
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:33,762
Poor people call this
a house. Jesus Christ.

636
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:43,079
You have never used this shit.

637
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,692
Fucking douche bag.
Skis. What the fuck?

638
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:53,907
Ha! Ha!

639
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:57,953
"Lagavulin, product of Scotland."

640
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,179
Oh.

641
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,916
That just smells like money.

642
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,689
I knew there was a reason
to be your friend, Trent.

643
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:14,302
More? Oh, absolutely. No... All right,
you don't have to force it on me.

644
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,113
Fuck.

645
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:19,433
You can grease wheels
with this shit.

646
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,852
That's payment for
being a douche bag.

647
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,234
Okay.

648
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,628
Oh, yeah.

649
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:34,865
Oh, wow. Your tits are stupendous.

650
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:37,717
Wow, you really know how to
make a girl feel special, huh?

651
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:40,120
That's what I do.

652
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:57,345
Oh, man.

653
01:00:57,363 --> 01:01:00,640
All right. Let's see
what you've got.

654
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:05,995
All right, give me something, baby.
What you got for me? Give me something.

655
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,873
Goddamn. Not even a swimsuit? Shit.

656
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:11,584
Goddamn winter catalog.

657
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,236
Oh, okay.

658
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:18,241
Gonna have to do.

659
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:25,499
Lady, I'm about to
ruin your perfect day.

660
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:36,343
All right.

661
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,445
Shit. You scared the
piss out of me.

662
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:43,074
Where is everybody? There's a guy
out there carrying a dead body.

663
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:44,575
Jenna, where's the phone?

664
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,411
I don't know. Over there?

665
01:01:46,412 --> 01:01:50,540
You fucking with me because I'm high?
That's not cool. I just finished smoking.

666
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,692
Where's the phone?

667
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,296
Hi, I want to report a homicide.

668
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,715
Clay Miller.

669
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:01,426
Yeah, I'm at a house by
Crystal Lake. It's...

670
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:03,370
Yeah, that's it. Hurry.

671
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,264
They said they're sending someone.

672
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:07,974
- Police?
- Yeah.

673
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:11,310
- Where is everybody else?
- I don't know. I've been here all day.

674
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,980
Chelsea and Nolan left, like,
hours ago to the lake.

675
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,691
- Well, what about Trent? Bree?
- They're in the bedroom.

676
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,323
- Your tits are fucking just...
- I know.

677
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,017
so juicy, dude.

678
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,564
You got perfect nipple
placement, baby.

679
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,585
This better not go on
the fucking Internet.

680
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,702
Trent, Bree. You guys in there?

681
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:49,307
Trent! Bree!

682
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:51,209
Shut the fuck up!

683
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,478
Get out here!

684
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:55,922
They're just fucking with us.

685
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,594
- Ignore her.
- Come on, guys.

686
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:03,362
Get out here. There's
a guy out there.

687
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:06,433
- We're busy in here, baby.
- Trent.

688
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,957
Yeah.

689
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:18,377
Okay. All right, Trent.
Let me educate you.

690
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:22,882
You ever seen a crossover before,
huh? I'm gonna show you right now.

691
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:25,718
I'll bet you never... Whoa. Ow.

692
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,996
Jesus.

693
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,921
Hey.

694
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,632
Now, this is a man's sport.

695
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:43,220
You're even curved to the
left, like my penis.

696
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:47,474
Okay, it's overtime. Line change.

697
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,825
Chewie's on the ice.

698
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:53,230
Send the puck around the back of the net.
Here we go. Pass back to the middle. Oh!

699
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:58,459
Oh, my...

700
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,987
No, no, no.

701
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,825
Shit.

702
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,455
Shit.

703
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:23,176
Oh, God. You scared the
shit out of me, bro.

704
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,071
Are you looking for this?

705
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:31,434
Because it completes your outfit.

706
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,356
Oh, fuck.

707
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,919
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus.

708
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,500
No.

709
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:50,347
- I'm close, baby. I'm close.
- I'm close too.

710
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,874
Oh, baby.

711
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,710
That was...

712
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,946
Stupendous?

713
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:12,202
To say the least, yeah.

714
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:21,544
- Who's messing with the lights?
- Oh, shit. Chewie's still out there.

715
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,314
- Phone's dead. Do you have a cell?
- Nothing has a signal.

716
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,732
What are you doing here?

717
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:28,484
- Trent...
- Get the fuck out, buddy.

718
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,929
- Easy.
- He's just trying to help us.

719
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:35,574
You leave with this guy for eight
hours, fucking all over the woods?

720
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,619
You know what? Why don't both
of you just get the fuck out?

721
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,746
- There's a bigger problem...
- Shut up.

722
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:43,290
Are you serious? There
is a killer out there.

723
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,001
He's the one who cut the lights.

724
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:48,713
Trent, don't you get it? Chelsea
and Nolan never came back.

725
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:50,297
Lawrence, what are you doing?

726
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:53,410
My boy's still out there.
I'm gonna go get him.

727
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:55,344
No, man. Don't go
out there. Please.

728
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,581
Look, I told, all right? You
can't get a handle on me.

729
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:01,000
I'll surprise you every time.

730
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:30,655
Chewie?

731
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:39,289
Hey, Chewie?

732
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:49,048
Chew, you in there?

733
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:18,703
Chewie?

734
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:22,707
Chewie, you in here?

735
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,770
Oh, fuck.

736
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,239
Get the fuck off me.

737
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:45,081
Take that, motherfucker.

738
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:13,484
Guys, this is bullshit. The power
goes out here all the time.

739
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,739
Help me!

740
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:22,092
Help! Help me!

741
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,345
Please, help me.

742
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:26,722
- Lawrence.
- No, no, no. You can't go out there.

743
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,807
- We have to help him.
- No, we can't.

744
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:31,810
He's using your friend as bait.
He wants us to go out.

745
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,562
Well, you don't know that.

746
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,397
Jesus, where are the police?

747
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,342
I can't move.

748
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,636
- Help me!
- We have to help him.

749
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:41,304
I can't die like this.

750
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,724
Help me, please. Trent.

751
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:47,143
Somebody, help.

752
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,978
Oh, my God, please.

753
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,356
I can't fucking...

754
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:53,691
Somebody's gotta do something!

755
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,737
Please.

756
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,970
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

757
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:27,183
Everyone's gonna be okay, all right?
The cops are on their way.

758
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,105
What are you doing?

759
01:11:47,012 --> 01:11:49,080
Trent.

760
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,507
Jenna?

761
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:31,550
Police.

762
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,704
- Oh, thank God.
- Go, go.

763
01:14:36,014 --> 01:14:38,165
Police, open up.

764
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:45,590
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Go, go, go.
- Oh, my God.

765
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:54,031
Get the door.

766
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:55,824
Okay. Shit.

767
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:59,312
- What are you doing? Is he inside?
- He killed the cop.

768
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:03,232
What the fuck, you got
a gun? Let's go now.

769
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,904
Jesus! What are you doing?

770
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,506
Give me the gun.

771
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:12,450
Someone's in there.

772
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:16,621
Check it out.

773
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:34,722
Bree's dead. He killed Bree.

774
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,148
Come on.

775
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,777
Come on.

776
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:51,197
There's no gun, no keys,
nothing. Let's go.

777
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,372
Where are the keys?

778
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:06,562
- Help! We got officers down.
- My keys are gone. Where are my keys?

779
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:09,507
Hey, Jenna, fuck this guy.
Let's get out of here.

780
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:18,057
Go. Go. Go, go, go! Jesus.

781
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:47,086
Shit. Where the fuck are you, gun?

782
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,255
Fuck.

783
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:57,430
Fuck it.

784
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:27,186
He was headed this way.

785
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,522
- Come on.
- Okay.

786
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,581
Help!

787
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,182
Shh.

788
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:31,975
- What was that?
- Let me out!

789
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:35,004
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck?

790
01:19:36,856 --> 01:19:39,149
Help me!

791
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,093
Help me.

792
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:51,163
This way.

793
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:12,784
- Clay?
- Whitney. Whitney.

794
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:15,161
- Oh, God, Clay.
- Thank God.

795
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,539
Are you okay? You okay? Thank God.

796
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,984
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

797
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:23,153
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay. You're okay?

798
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,947
Oh, God.

799
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:27,299
- Okay.
- Just get me out of here.

800
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,884
Fuck.

801
01:21:28,885 --> 01:21:31,553
- Come on, you guys, let's go.
- Can you break it?

802
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:33,956
- No, just break it, just break it.
- Okay.

803
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:37,309
Yeah, just go. Go.
Just fucking do it.

804
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,978
- Hold still. Hold your hands.
- Hurry up, hurry.

805
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:41,964
Do it. Fucking do it.

806
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:47,402
- We gotta get out of here.
- I don't wanna hit you.

807
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,654
- Just fucking do it.
- Okay, okay.

808
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,098
Hurry.

809
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:55,352
Oh, God.

810
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:02,000
Holy shit.

811
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,028
Okay, okay, okay.

812
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,504
You guys, I can see
him. He's coming.

813
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:08,089
- What?
- We gotta go.

814
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,842
- Grab onto me. Grab onto me.
- Let's go. Come on, hurry.

815
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,494
GO, go!

816
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,998
Go. Come on.

817
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:37,853
Go. Go.

818
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:47,045
It's a dead end.

819
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:48,588
What are we gonna do?

820
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,741
Clay?

821
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:52,993
Hurry.

822
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:54,953
Here. Here.

823
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,460
Come on, we can get through here.

824
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,755
Follow me.

825
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,315
- Go, go, go.
- It's safe, guys.

826
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:10,026
Give me your hand, Jenna.
Come on, hurry.

827
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:12,763
Give me your hand. Okay. I got you.

828
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:18,894
Oh, my... Fuck. Jesus, God, no.

829
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,231
- Oh, God. Clay. Clay.
- No. No.

830
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:26,693
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Oh, God. Clay.

831
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,987
Come on, we gotta go.

832
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:41,834
Look. I think this
might be a way out.

833
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:55,722
All right. Let's go.
Come on. Hurry.

834
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,893
Let's go. Watch out.

835
01:24:02,288 --> 01:24:03,580
Come on.

836
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:05,165
- Hurry.
- Damn it. It's stuck.

837
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:06,374
Come on, come on.

838
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,861
- Come on.
- Hurry.

839
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:21,765
Give me your hand. Give me your
hand. Give me your hand. Okay.

840
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:24,710
On three. One... Come on.

841
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:30,048
- Run. Whitney, get...
- Clay! Clay! Clay!

842
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,800
Stop it!

843
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,069
No!

844
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,472
Clay! Clay!

845
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:41,143
Shit. Shit.

846
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:26,522
Fuck you.

847
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,546
No, no, no!

848
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:45,598
Whitney!

849
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:48,852
- Whitney.
- Clay. Clay!

850
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:50,796
Come on.

851
01:25:53,858 --> 01:25:55,759
Hurry.

852
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,220
Come on.

853
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:15,946
Hide.

854
01:27:21,946 --> 01:27:24,014
Shit, fuck.

855
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:17,109
Jason.

856
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:31,748
It's okay.

857
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:35,127
You can stop now.

858
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:37,963
It's okay.

859
01:29:50,803 --> 01:29:52,537
Jason.

860
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,499
Say hi to Mommy...

861
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:59,336
in hell.
