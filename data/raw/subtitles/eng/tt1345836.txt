1
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,572
<i>I knew Harvey Dent.</i>

2
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,907
<i>I was his friend.</i>

3
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:14,243
And it will be a very long time before
someone inspires us the way he did.

4
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,587
I believed in Harvey Dent.

5
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,442
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

6
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,648
He wasn't alone.

7
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,860
- Uh, you don't get to bring friends.
- They are not my friends.

8
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,025
Don't worry, no charge for them.

9
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,996
- CIA OP: And why would I want them?
- They were trying to grab your prize.

10
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,830
They work for the mercenary.

11
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,866
The masked man.

12
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,911
- Bane?
- Aye.

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,668
Get them on board. I'll call it in.

14
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,599
CIA OP: The flight plan I
just filed with the agency...

15
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,979
...lists me, my men,
Dr. Pavel here...

16
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,356
...but only one of you!

17
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,655
First one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft!

18
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,245
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

19
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,381
He didn't fly so good!

20
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,541
Who wants to try next?

21
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,128
Tell me about Bane!

22
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,796
Why does he wear the mask?

23
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,968
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

24
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,809
Well, perhaps he's wondering why
someone would shoot a man...

25
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,100
...before throwing
him out of a plane.

26
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,780
At least you can talk.

27
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,065
Who are you?

28
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,701
It doesn't matter who we are.

29
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,324
What matters is our plan.

30
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,085
No one cared who I was
till I put on the mask.

31
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,667
If I pull that off, will you die?

32
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,007
It would be extremely painful.

33
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,341
You're a big guy.

34
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,721
For you.

35
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,887
Was getting caught
part of your plan?

36
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,555
Of course.

37
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:50,022
Dr. Pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours.

38
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,692
- We had to find out what he told you--
- Nothing. I said nothing.

39
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,630
Well, congratulations,
you got yourself caught!

40
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,217
- Sir?
- Now what's the next step of your master plan?

41
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,806
Crashing this plane...

42
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,639
...with no survivors.

43
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,042
Mayday, Mayday!

44
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,466
Aah! What you doing to me?
Let me out!

45
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,804
No!

46
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,102
No, no, no! No!

47
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,575
No! They expect one of us
in the wreckage, brother.

48
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,203
Have we started the fire?

49
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,949
Yes, the fire rises.

50
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,470
Calm down, doctor.
Now is not the time for fear.

51
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,843
That comes later.

52
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,245
<i>OR: Harvey Dent Day may not be
our oldest public holiday.</i>

53
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,460
<i>...but we're here tonight because
it's one of the most important.</i>

54
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,753
<i>Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime.-.</i>

55
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,049
...had made Gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death, eight years ago.

56
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,388
This city has seen a
historic turnaround.

57
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:11,895
No city is without crime, but
this city is without organized
crime because the Dent Act...

58
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,277
...gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob.

59
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,110
Now people are talking about
repealing the Dent Act...

60
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,276
...and to them I say,
"Not on my watch."

61
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,530
I want to thank the Wayne
Foundation for hosting this event.

62
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,826
I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight.
I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

63
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,745
And now I'm gonna give way
to an important voice...

64
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,381
You ever lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these things?

65
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,257
No one has. Not in years.

66
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,296
--people put their faith in a
murderous thug in a mask and a cape.

67
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,012
A thug who showed
his true nature...

68
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,643
...when he betrayed the
trust of this great man...

69
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,312
...and murdered him in cold blood.

70
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,391
Sweetheart,
not so fast with the chow.

71
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,559
- Shrimp balls?
- Thank you.

72
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,196
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about
Harvey Dent. I'll let him tell you himself.

73
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,823
Commissioner Gordon.

74
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,625
The truth?

75
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,840
I have...

76
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,752
...written a speech...

77
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,760
...telling the truth
about Harvey Dent.

78
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,892
Maybe the time isn't right.

79
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,277
Maybe right now...

80
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,064
...all you need to know is that there are...

81
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:47,032
...1000 inmates in Blackgate Prison
as a direct result of the Dent Act.

82
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,120
These are violent criminals, essential
cogs in the organized-crime machine.

83
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:57,204
Maybe, for now, all I should say about
the death of Harvey Dent is this:

84
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,716
It has not been for nothing.

85
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,714
<i>MAID 1: You see the guy who owns the house?
MAID 2: No. I heard...</i>

86
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,851
-...he never leaves the east wing.
- I heard he had an accident.

87
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,764
- Yeah, that he's disfigured. He has to wear a--
- Mr. Till?

88
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,650
Why are your people using
the main staircase?

89
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,148
And where's Mrs. Bolton?

90
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,022
Uh, she's at the bar, sir.
Can I help?

91
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,406
The east drawing room.

92
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,571
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.

93
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,994
<i>ED: I'm sorry, Miss Tate I tried,
but he won't see you.</i>

94
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,166
And you mustn't take it personally.

95
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,342
Everyone knows that Wayne's holed
up in there with 8-inch nails...

96
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,173
...peeing into Mason jars.

97
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,713
It's very good of you to
let me on the grounds.

98
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,403
Why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man...

99
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:08,283
...who threw away your investment on
some save-the-world vanity project?

100
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,694
He can't get your
money back. I can.

101
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,866
I could try explaining that a
save-the-world project, vain or not...

102
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,455
...is worth investing in,
Mr. Daggett.

103
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,792
But you understand only money and
the power you think it buys...

104
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,920
...so why waste my time indeed?

105
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,960
<i>ON: Second shift reports in?</i>

106
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,221
You should spend more time with the mayor.

107
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,256
Well, that's your department.

108
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,055
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

109
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,517
He goes by his gut and it bothers him,
no matter what the numbers.

110
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,559
- Must be popular with his wife.
- Not really. She took the kids to Cleveland.

111
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,945
He'll have plenty of time for visits.
The mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.

112
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,651
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

113
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,694
- But he's a hero.
- A war hero. This is peacetime.

114
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,227
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

115
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,360
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

116
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:37,205
Although you don't have the long nails or,
heh, the facial scars, sir.

117
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,200
Is that what they say about me?

118
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,454
It's just that no
one ever sees you.

119
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,833
That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds
me of one that belonged to my mother.

120
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,094
It can't be the same one...

121
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,760
...because her pearls
are in this safe...

122
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,098
...the manufacturer
clearly explained...

123
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,606
...is uncrackable.

124
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,613
Oops.

125
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,991
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

126
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,161
I'm afraid I can't
let you take those.

127
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,283
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman any
more than I would beat up a cripple.

128
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,170
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

129
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,507
Good night, Mr. Wayne.

130
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,062
Can I have a ride?

131
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,733
You read my mind.

132
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,069
Let's go.

133
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,864
Miss Tate was asking
to see you again.

134
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,653
She's very persistent.

135
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,164
And quite lovely,
in case you were wondering.

136
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,495
- I wasn't.
- What are you doing?

137
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,958
Examining print dust. We've been robbed.

138
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,090
And this is your idea of, uh,
sounding the alarm, is it?

139
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,421
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.

140
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,880
- She?
- One of the maids.

141
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,671
Perhaps you should stop letting
them in this side of the house.

142
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,307
Perhaps you should start
learning to make your own bed.

143
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,394
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't.

144
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,730
She was.

145
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,066
Sir. Congressman Gilly's
wife has been calling in.

146
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,108
The congressman never made it home
after the Wayne Foundation event.

147
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,447
That's a job for the police?

148
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,453
When you and Dent cleaned the streets,
you cleaned them good.

149
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,412
Pretty soon we'll be chasing down,
uh, overdue library books.

150
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,336
And yet here you are,
like we're still at war.

151
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,544
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

152
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,508
You have something
you want to ask me?

153
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,101
It's about that night. This night,
eight years ago. The night Dent died.

154
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,227
The last confirmed
sighting of the Batman.

155
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,477
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams...

156
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,394
...breaks Dent's neck
and then just vanishes?

157
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,196
I'm not hearing a question, son.

158
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,323
Don't you want to know who he was?

159
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,614
I know exactly who he was.

160
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,577
He was the Batman.

161
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,536
Let's go see about the
congressman's wife.

162
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,846
Master Wayne?

163
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,599
Master Wayne?

164
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,833
You haven't been down
here in a long time.

165
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,549
Trying to find out more about
ourjewel thief. I ran her prints.

166
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,513
Unless she's lost
a lot of weight...

167
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,142
...she was wearing someone
else's fingerprints.

168
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,426
She's good.

169
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,143
She may be, but we have
a trace on the necklace.

170
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,933
We do. I cross-referenced the
address she went back to...

171
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,695
...with police data on
high-end B-and-E's, and, um...

172
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,939
Selina Kyle.

173
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,953
The databases are full of close-calls,
tips from fences.

174
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,116
She's good, but the ground is
shrinking beneath her feet.

175
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,035
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

176
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,420
She won't. She likes them too much.

177
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,377
And they weren't
what she was after.

178
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,633
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

179
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,795
It was printer toner mixed
with graphite on the safe.

180
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,555
It gives a good pull
and it's untraceable.

181
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,558
Fascinating. You two should
exchange notes over coffee.

182
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,015
You're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

183
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:14,649
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee,
if it brought you back to the world.

184
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,060
There's nothing out there for me.

185
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,812
And that's the problem.

186
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,527
You hung up your cape and your
cowl but you didn't move on.

187
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,987
You never went to find a life.
To find someone.

188
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,527
Alfred...

189
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,325
...I did find someone.

190
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,910
I know, and you lost them.

191
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,040
But that's all part of living, sir.

192
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,330
But you're not living, you're just waiting,
hoping for things to go bad again.

193
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,005
Remember when you left Gotham?

194
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,168
Before all this, before Batman?

195
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,965
YOU were gone seven years.

196
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,724
Seven years I waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

197
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,512
Every year, I took a holiday.
I went to Florence.

198
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,930
<i>There's this caf?© on the banks of the Arno.</i>

199
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,350
Every fine evening I'd sit there
and order a Fernet Branca.

200
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,403
I had this fantasy...

201
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,195
...that I would look
across the tables...

202
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,327
<i>...and I'd see you there,
with a wife.</i>

203
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,326
<i>Maybe a couple of kids.</i>

204
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,286
You wouldn't say anything to me,
nor me to you.

205
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,299
But we'd both know
that you'd made it.

206
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,801
That you were happy.

207
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,392
I never wanted you to
come back to Gotham.

208
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,057
I always knew there was nothing here
for you, except pain and tragedy.

209
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,101
And I wanted something
more for you than that.

210
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,448
I still do.

211
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,538
<i>DWP MAN: They wash up here a
couple of times a month.</i>

212
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,165
<i>More when it gets colder.</i>

213
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,291
Homeless, sheltering
in the tunnels.

214
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,082
We pulled him from the basin,
but other than that we didn't touch him.

215
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,085
- What?
- Name's Jimmy.

216
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,674
He's from St. Swithin's.

217
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,221
It's the boys' home where I coach some ball.

218
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,729
<i>LY: Jimmy hadn't been around for months.</i>

219
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,390
- No? Why?
- Blake, you know why.

220
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,403
He aged out. We don't have the
resources to keep boys on after 16.

221
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,655
I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for that.

222
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,907
Not for the past couple of years.

223
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,911
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

224
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,073
I'd like to, if that's all right.

225
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,292
You know what he was doing in the tunnels?

226
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,297
Lot of guys been going down
the tunnels when they age out.

227
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,676
Say you can live down there.

228
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,882
Say there's work down there.

229
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,547
Work?

230
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,512
What kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers?

231
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,302
More than you can
find up here, I guess.

232
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,430
So you know about him?

233
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,848
Of course.

234
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,355
Do you think he's coming back?

235
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,858
I don't know.

236
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,249
You brought a date?

237
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,631
I like having someone
around to open doors for me.

238
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,760
Right hand. No partials.

239
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,142
- Very nice.
- Mm-hm.

240
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,015
Not so fast, handsome.

241
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,555
You got something for me?

242
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,641
Ah, yes.

243
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,321
I don't know what you're planning
to do with Mr. Wayne's prints...

244
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,286
...but I'm guessing
you'll need his thumb.

245
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,168
You don't count so good, huh?

246
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,578
I count fine.

247
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,168
In fact, I'm counting
to 10 right now.

248
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,672
Okay.

249
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,471
My friend's outside.
Just hit "send."

250
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,571
This place is a little dead.

251
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,984
It'll liven up in a minute.
Trust me.

252
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,694
Is everything okay?

253
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,863
Great. Catch you later.

254
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,877
Hmm.

255
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,880
It would have been a lot easier...

256
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,253
...to just give me what we agreed.

257
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,836
We can't have loose ends.

258
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,840
And even in that dress,
no one's gonna miss you.

259
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,508
No.

260
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,551
But my friend over there?

261
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,892
Every cop in the
city's missing him.

262
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,397
That's cute.

263
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,275
But they're not gonna be
looking in a place like this.

264
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,354
I don't know. You did
just use his cell phone.

265
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,949
SWAT 1: Go! SWAT 2: Go!

266
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,929
Police! Get down now!

267
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,346
Help me! Help me!

268
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,561
Help me, please! Please help me!

269
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,369
Keep some pressure on that,
sweetheart.

270
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,073
Call me?

271
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,329
- You okay, miss?
- He's bleeding. You gotta help him.

272
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,717
I got the congressman.

273
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,952
Clear!

274
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,048
Manhole! Get this up! Get the DWP down here!

275
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,546
You three, down with me.

276
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,134
You two, you go down, cover the next exit!

277
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,155
What, they went down there?

278
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,769
- We're gonna go down there, right?
- That was a gas explosion, kid.

279
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,186
- Wasn't gas. It's a sewer.
- No one goes in till we know what's there.

280
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,195
We know, sir.
The police commissioner.

281
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,197
Someone get this
hothead out of here?

282
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,859
And where's that DWP guy?

283
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,452
Why are you here?

284
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,785
Answer him.

285
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,372
I was asking you.

286
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,290
It's the police commissioner.

287
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,551
And you brought him down here?

288
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,804
- MERCENARY 1: We didn't know what to do.
- You panicked.

289
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,308
And your weakness has cost
the lives of three others.

290
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,592
No, he's alone.

291
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,018
Search him.

292
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,728
Then I will kill you.

293
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,178
- He's dead.
- So show me his body.

294
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,765
The water runs to any one of the outflows.
We'd never find him.

295
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,981
Follow him! MERCENARY 2: Follow him?

296
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,541
You okay? You okay?

297
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,626
Hey, hey, you awake?

298
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,880
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

299
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,516
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't
take unscheduled calls.

300
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,472
Even from a police officer.

301
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,310
And if I go get a warrant for the
investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?

302
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,691
That still count as unscheduled?

303
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,901
What can I do for you, officer?

304
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,325
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

305
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,700
He chased a gunman down into the sewers.

306
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,207
When I pulled him out, he was
babbling about an underground army.

307
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,209
A masked man called Bane.

308
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,379
Shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers?

309
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,633
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.

310
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,801
He needs you.

311
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,675
He needs the Batman.

312
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,222
- If Commissioner Gordon thinks--
- Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are.

313
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,978
But we've met before.

314
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:24,227
It was a long time ago.
I was a kid. Uh, St. Swithin's.

315
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,614
It used to be funded by the Wayne
Foundation. It's an orphanage.

316
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,695
My mom died when I was small. It was a
car accident, I don't really remember it.

317
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,496
But my dad got shot a couple years
later over a gambling debt...

318
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,995
...and I remember
that one just fine.

319
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,253
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?

320
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
To be angry...

321
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,970
...in your bones.

322
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,679
I mean, they understand.

323
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,681
Foster parents.

324
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,846
Everybody understands...

325
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,640
...for a while.

326
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,111
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.

327
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,778
Move on.

328
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,322
So after a while, they stop understanding.

329
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,358
They send the angry
kid to a boys' home.

330
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,534
I figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.

331
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,582
Practice smiling in a mirror.

332
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,911
It's like putting on a mask.

333
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,712
So you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.

334
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,717
Pretty girl on your arm.

335
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,591
We were so excited.

336
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,473
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

337
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,679
I mean, we used to make up
stories about you, man. Legends.

338
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,644
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but...

339
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,519
Right when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

340
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,777
I'd seen that look
on your face before.

341
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,943
It's the same one I taught myself.

342
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,782
I don't know why you took the
fall for Dent's murder...

343
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,705
...but I'm still a
believer in the Batman...

344
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,207
...even if you're not.

345
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,841
Why did you say that your boys' home used
to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

346
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,754
Because the money stopped.

347
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:20,142
Might be time to get some fresh air.
Start paying attention to the details.

348
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,387
Some of those details might need your help.

349
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,523
You check that name? Bane?

350
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,356
He's a mercenary. No other known names.

351
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,987
Him and his men were behind
a coup in West Africa...

352
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,651
...that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.

353
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,158
- Now Daggett's brought them here.
- Or so it seems.

354
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,367
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

355
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:51,799
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?

356
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:57,054
The foundation is funded by the
profits of Wayne Enterprises.

357
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,926
There have to be some.

358
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,434
- Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
- I'll get him on the phone.

359
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,597
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

360
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,640
Yes. One or two.

361
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,809
I need an appointment at
the hospital for my leg.

362
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,729
- Which hospital?
- Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

363
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,907
- I have seen worse cartilage in knees.
- That's good.

364
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,572
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.

365
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,084
And not much of any use in
your elbows or your shoulders.

366
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,620
Between that and the scar
tissue on your kidneys...

367
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,460
...the residual concussive
damage to your brain tissue...

368
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,296
...and the general scarred-over
quality of your body...

369
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,383
-...I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing.
- Right.

370
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,355
We were in this together...

371
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,029
...then you were gone.

372
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,320
The Batman wasn't needed anymore.

373
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,615
- We won.
- Based on a lie.

374
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:13,127
And now there's evil rising
from where we tried to bury it.

375
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,801
The Batman has to come back.

376
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,428
What if he doesn't exist anymore?

377
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,057
He must.

378
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,614
You took my goddamn wallet,
didn't you?

379
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,652
- You f-- You took my wallet!
- No, I--

380
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,579
- Get out.
- She took my-- Ah!

381
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,331
- Now.
- Creep!

382
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,414
I don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.

383
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,328
Probably the watch.

384
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,640
Who's that?

385
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,931
A stiff can barely climb
out of his sports car.

386
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,225
- No, that's Bruce Wayne!
- Mr. Wayne, over here!

387
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,649
- I'm not sure if my assistant--
- Right through here.

388
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,317
Thank you so much.

389
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,372
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.

390
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,287
Miss Tate, isn't it?

391
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,337
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

392
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,170
The proceeds go to the big fat spread.
It's not about charity.

393
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,682
It's about feeding the ego of
whichever society hag laid this on.

394
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,598
Actually, this is my party,
Mr. Wayne.

395
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,433
Oh.

396
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,935
And the proceeds will go where
they should, because I paid
for the big fat spread myself.

397
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,728
That's very generous of you.

398
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,824
You have to invest if you want
to restore balance to the world.

399
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,734
Take our clean-energy project.

400
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,904
Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off.

401
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,371
- I'm sorry.
- You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

402
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,664
But a man who doesn't care about the world
doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.

403
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,668
And isn't so wounded
when it fails...

404
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,711
...that he goes into hiding.

405
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,265
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

406
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,975
Mind if I cut in?

407
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,898
Thank you.

408
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,942
- You don't seem happy to see me.
- You were supposed to be a shut-in.

409
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,981
I felt like some fresh air.

410
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,902
Why didn't you call the police?

411
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,909
I have a powerful friend who
deals with things like this.

412
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:55,372
That's a brazen costume
for a cat burglar.

413
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,503
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

414
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,381
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

415
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,459
- Who's your date?
- His wife's in Ibiza.

416
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,426
She left her diamonds behind, though.
Worried they might get stolen.

417
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,636
It's pronounced "Ibiza

418
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,891
You wouldn't want these folks realizing
you're a crook, not a social climber.

419
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,182
You think I care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?

420
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,193
I doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.

421
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:26,073
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know a thing about me.

422
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,911
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
here from your walk-up in Old Town.

423
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,912
A modest place for a
master jewel thief.

424
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,371
Which means that either you're
saving for retirement...

425
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,086
...or you're in deep
with the wrong people.

426
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:44,383
You don't get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.

427
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,887
- Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
- I started out doing what I had to.

428
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,425
Once you've done what you had to,
they never let you do what you want to.

429
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,844
Start fresh.

430
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,230
Ugh. There's no fresh
start in today's world.

431
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,437
Any 12-year-old with a cell phone
could find out what you did.

432
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,400
Everything we do is collated and
quantified. Everything sticks.

433
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,981
Is that how you justify stealing?

434
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,742
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

435
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,198
I don't stand on the shoulders
of people with less.

436
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,408
Robin Hood?

437
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,701
I think I'd do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room. Than you.

438
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,753
You think maybe you're
assuming a little too much?

439
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,961
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's
really in your pants other than your wallet.

440
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,171
Ouch.

441
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,764
You think all this can last?
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

442
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,602
You and your friends better batten down
the hatches, because when it hits...

443
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:41,641
...you're all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large...

444
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,901
...and leave so little
for the rest of us.

445
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,691
You sound like you're looking forward to it.

446
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,701
I'm adaptable.

447
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,114
Those pearls do look better on
you than they did in my safe.

448
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,083
But I still can't
let you keep them.

449
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,922
You-- You scared her off!

450
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,384
Not likely.

451
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,885
Must have lost my ticket.

452
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,804
- Your wife said you were taking a cab home.
- My wife?

453
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,275
Just you, sir?

454
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,360
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

455
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,160
Takes a little time to get
back in the swing of things.

456
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,578
Bruce Wayne, as I live and breathe.

457
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,749
What brings you out of
cryo-sleep, Mr. Wayne?

458
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,667
You haven't lost
your sense of humor.

459
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,337
Even if you have lost
most of my money.

460
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,005
Actually, you did that.

461
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,890
If you funnel your
entire R and D budget...

462
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,973
...into a fusion project
that you then mothball...

463
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,480
...your company is
unlikely to thrive.

464
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,685
What are my options?

465
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,226
Well, if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine...

466
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,944
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

467
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,067
Well, then sit tight.

468
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,948
Your majority keeps
Daggett at bay...

469
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:18,112
...while we figure out a future for
the energy program with Miranda Tate.

470
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,906
She has supported the project all the way.

471
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,496
She's smart. And quite lovely.

472
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,542
We all just want what's
best for you, Bruce.

473
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,041
Show her the machine.

474
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,255
I'll think it over.

475
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,761
Anything else?

476
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,172
Nope. WW?

477
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,388
These conversations used to
end with an unusual request.

478
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,557
I retired.

479
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,941
Mm-hm. Well, let me show
you some stuff anyway.

480
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,563
Just for old times' sake.

481
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,074
I figured you'd have shut this place down.

482
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,910
Oh, it was always shut down,
officially.

483
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,164
All this new stuff.

484
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:08,955
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

485
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,794
For years, I've been
shuttering and consolidating...

486
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,334
...all the different
prototypes under one roof.

487
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,219
- My roof.
- Why?

488
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,177
Keep them from falling into the wrong hands.

489
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,431
Oh, now you're just showing off.

490
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:30,226
Defense Department projects for
tight geometry urban pacification.

491
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,322
Rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation.

492
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,274
What's it called?

493
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:42,120
Oh, it has a long, uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation.

494
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,657
I just took to calling it the Bat.

495
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,202
And, yes, Mr. Wayne,
it does come in black.

496
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,965
Works fine,
except for the autopilot.

497
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,338
Takes a better mind
than mine to fix it.

498
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,878
Better mind?

499
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,427
Well, I was trying to be modest.

500
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,721
A less busy mind.

501
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,430
Yours.

502
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,446
- Is it really painful?
- You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.

503
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,322
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

504
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,864
Not bad.

505
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,329
Not bad at all.

506
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,916
If you're seriously considering
going back out there...

507
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,210
...you should hear the
rumors surrounding Bane.

508
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,423
I'm all ears.

509
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,428
There is a prison in a more
ancient part of the world.

510
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:49,805
A pit where men are
thrown to suffer and die.

511
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,734
But sometimes a man rises from the darkness.

512
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:58,105
Sometimes the pit
sends something back.

513
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,399
- Bane.
- Bane.

514
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,739
Born and raised in hell on earth.

515
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,827
- Born in a prison?
- No one knows why, or how he escaped.

516
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,583
But they do know
that once he did...

517
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,918
...he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.

518
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,081
Bane was a member of the League of Shadows?

519
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,421
And then he was excommunicated.

520
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:25,599
And any man who is too extreme for
Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

521
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,011
I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

522
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,933
That was then.

523
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,186
And you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on...

524
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,943
...but that doesn't make you what you were.

525
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,732
If this man is everything that you
say he is, then the city needs me.

526
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,868
The city needs Bruce Wayne.

527
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,157
Your resources. Your knowledge.

528
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,415
It doesn't need your body,
or your life.

529
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,371
That time's past.

530
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,912
You're afraid that if I go
back out there, I'll fail.

531
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,331
No.

532
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,801
I'm afraid that you want to.

533
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,481
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

534
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:23,486
Wayne coming back is change.
Change is either good or bad. I vote bad.

535
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,945
On what basis?

536
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,655
I flipped a coin.

537
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,705
It says rye-- I said no rye, man.

538
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,085
Hey, rookie, lose the helmet.
We need faces for camera.

539
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,052
Come on. Let's go scalping.

540
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,526
Come on.

541
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,466
Everybody down, now!

542
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,495
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

543
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,032
Really? Then why are
you people here?

544
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,260
SECURITY CHIEF: Everybody,
stay back! Go down to the end of the block!

545
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,394
We have an emergency situation!

546
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,274
You gotta get in there!

547
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,026
This is a hostage situation.

548
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,610
No, this is a robbery. They have direct
access to the online trading desk.

549
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,570
I'm not risking my
men for your money.

550
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,164
We have to ask you to move.
We have a situation.

551
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,370
It's not our money,
it's everybody's.

552
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,627
Really? Mine's in my mattress.

553
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:45,291
You don't put these guys down,
that stuffing in your mattress
might be worth a whole lot less.

554
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,709
Cut the fiber cable and
take out that cell tower.

555
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,378
- SECURITY CHIEF: Thank you.
- That'll slow them down.

556
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,092
Move back!

557
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,929
All the way! Go! Sir,
get back, please!

558
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,018
They cut the fiber.

559
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,270
Cell's working.

560
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,772
For now.

561
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,111
Get all these barriers up. All
of them up. No one gets in or
out of any of these streets.

562
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,901
Where am I supposed to move it?

563
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,364
Back it up.

564
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,167
All right, just stay
in your vehicle, okay?

565
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,130
How much longer does the program need?

566
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,883
Eight minutes.

567
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,715
Time to go mobile.

568
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,225
Everybody, up!

569
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,847
You two, move!

570
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,980
Thank you.

571
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,403
Steady.

572
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,489
Steady.

573
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,460
I've got something.

574
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,085
Hold your fire,
they've got hostages.

575
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,503
Hold your fire!

576
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,973
Go. go!

577
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,363
Please! Just let me go!

578
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,320
Hey, please! Hey!

579
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,745
Shoot the tires.

580
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,376
There's no shot.

581
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,915
Now back off. Back off,
they've got hostages.

582
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,834
<i>MAN --P.D. are pursuing the four
suspects through downtown...</i>

583
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,048
<i>...in response to a
hostage situation.</i>

584
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,223
What's going on with the lights?

585
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,610
It can't be.

586
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,153
What the hell was that?

587
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,156
Oh, boy, you are in for a show tonight, son.

588
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,656
Please! Help, help, help!

589
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,554
Sorry

590
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,475
Put that thing away before
you hurt yourself. Get in!

591
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,766
Let's go. You, get in the car.
They've spotted the Batman.

592
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,197
Call everyone in. Every car patrol,
beat cop, off-duty too.

593
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,082
Pull them in now. I'm gonna do
what Jim Gordon never could.

594
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,461
- What's that?
- I'm gonna take down the Batman.

595
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,668
<i>MAN 1 --are confirming four suspects
are carrying two hostages...</i>

596
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,879
<i>...kidnapped from the Gotham Stock Exchange.</i>

597
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:19,342
<i>Reports from the eyewitnesses-- MAN 2:
Scott, dead center of your screen.</i>

598
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,926
<i>MAN 1: What do you see? MAN 2: I see Batman.</i>

599
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,763
<i>MAN 1: Hard to believe, but the
suspects are now being pursued...</i>

600
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,893
<i>...by what appears to
be the Batman.</i>

601
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,145
Well, what do you know?

602
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,277
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

603
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,658
Please! Just let me go! Please!

604
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:53,796
<i>SPOTTER One bike's pulled off.
No hostage. Should we pursue?</i>

605
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,881
Negative. Stay on the Batman.

606
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,595
- He's getting away.
- Who do you wanna catch?

607
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,306
Some robber, or the son of a
bitch who killed Harvey Dent?

608
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,017
<i->MAN 1 --the entire upper west hill...</i>

609
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,231
<i>Central Heights and East Park Side areas.</i>

610
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,318
Eight years,
and he has to pick tonight.

611
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,741
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

612
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,542
Please! Just let me go!

613
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,082
Please!

614
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,741
COP We lost him.

615
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,664
How could you lose him?

616
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,419
<i>OP: He's got a lot of firepower.</i>

617
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,670
What, and you don't?

618
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,211
<i>OP: He's heading back downtown.</i>

619
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,425
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.

620
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,640
Close it off, gentlemen.

621
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,459
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen.

622
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,759
You might have the wrong animal there, sir.

623
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,317
You sure it was him?

624
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,577
<i>ER: Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.</i>

625
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,366
What about the men they arrested?

626
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:21,629
He said, and I quote,
â?oThey would die before talking."

627
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,128
Where does he find these guys?

628
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,461
Open the champagne.

629
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,007
And can we get some girls in here?

630
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,595
Careful what you wish for.

631
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,946
Cat got your tongue?

632
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,321
You dumb bitch.

633
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,574
Nobody ever accused me of being dumb.

634
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,657
You're dumb for
coming here tonight.

635
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,743
I want what you owe me.

636
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,497
Want doesn't get.

637
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:05,043
Nice outfit. Those heels
make it tough to walk?

638
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,422
- I don't know.
- Aah!

639
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,418
Do they?

640
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,345
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

641
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,889
The program. The "clean slate."

642
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,351
The ultimate tool for a
master thief with a record.

643
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,640
Hold it right there!

644
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,197
Where is it?

645
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,328
The clean slate?

646
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,115
Where you type in someone's name,
date of birth...

647
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:43,457
...in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth?

648
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,793
- Sound a little too good to be true?
- You're lying!

649
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,549
Rykin Data took it
to prototype stage.

650
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,676
That's why I bought them.

651
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,463
But they had nothing.

652
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,598
It was a gangland myth.

653
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,107
Stay back!

654
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,108
I'm not bluffing!

655
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,402
They know.

656
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,241
They just don't care.

657
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,884
You've gotta be kidding me.

658
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,596
- No guns. No killing.
- Where's the fun in that?

659
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,535
My mother warned me about getting
into cars with strange men.

660
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:02,744
This isn't a car.

661
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,466
See you around.

662
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,585
You're welcome.

663
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,337
I had it under control.

664
00:54:58,504 --> 00:54:59,847
Those weren't street thugs.

665
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,099
They were trained killers.

666
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,930
I saved your life.

667
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:08,890
In return, I need to know what you
did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

668
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,605
Wayne wasn't kidding
about a powerful friend.

669
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,645
I sold his prints to Daggett...

670
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,074
...for something that
doesn't even exist.

671
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,079
- I doubt many people get the better of you.
- Hey, when a girl's desperate...

672
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,581
- What's he gonna do with them?
- I don't know...

673
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,118
...but Daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market.

674
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,841
Miss Kyle?

675
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,971
So that's what that feels like.

676
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:04,825
I see from the television coverage that you
got your taste for wanton destruction back.

677
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,955
I retrieved this.

678
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,583
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating, then?

679
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,166
- They don't have the tools to analyze it.
- They would if you gave them to them.

680
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,831
One man's tool is
another man's weapon.

681
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:19,343
In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't
many things you can't turn into a weapon.

682
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,629
Alfred, enough. The police
weren't getting it done.

683
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,174
Perhaps they might have if you
hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.

684
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,140
- You thought I didn't have it in me.
- You led a bloated police force on a chase...

685
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,897
...with a load of fancy
new toys from Fox.

686
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,899
What about when you come
up against him? What then?

687
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,859
- I'll fight harder. I always have.
- Look. His speed, his ferocity, his training.

688
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,696
I see the power of belief.

689
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,782
I see the League of
Shadows resurgent.

690
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,412
You said he was excommunicated.

691
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,448
By Ra's AI Ghul.

692
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,582
Who leads them now?

693
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,336
Ra's Al Ghul was the League
of Shadows and I beat him.

694
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,247
Bane is a mercenary.
We need to find out what he's up to.

695
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:01,006
Trades of some kind. Coded.

696
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,634
And my fingerprint,
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

697
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,888
Get this to Fox.

698
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:10,394
He can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing.

699
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:17,731
I'll get this to Mr. Fox,
but no more.

700
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,944
I've sewn you up, I've set your bones,
but I won't bury you.

701
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,486
I've buried enough members
of the Wayne family.

702
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:32,625
- You'll leave me?
- You see only one end to your journey.

703
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,672
Leaving is all I have
to make you understand.

704
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:41,459
You're not Batman anymore.
You have to find another way.

705
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:45,596
You used to talk about finishing,
about a life beyond that awful cave.

706
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:49,475
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together.

707
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:53,513
That was my life beyond the cave.
I can't just move on.

708
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,815
She-- She didn't. She couldn't.

709
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,018
What if she had?

710
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,652
She-- I can't change that.

711
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,815
What if before she died
she wrote a letter...

712
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:07,451
...saying she chose Harvey Dent over you?

713
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,165
And what if...

714
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,084
...to spare you pain...

715
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,788
...I burnt that letter?

716
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:24,843
How dare you use Rachel
to try to stop me?

717
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,468
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

718
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:34,012
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to
outsmart the truth and let it have its day.

719
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,765
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

720
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,650
You expect to destroy my world...

721
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,398
...and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

722
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,237
No, no, no.

723
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,577
I know what this means.

724
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,828
What does it mean?

725
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,410
It means your hatred.

726
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,335
And it also means losing someone
that I have cared for...

727
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:02,919
...since I first heard
his cries echo...

728
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,676
...through this house.

729
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:10,256
But it might also
mean saving your life.

730
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,971
And that is more important.

731
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,228
Goodbye, Alfred.

732
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,210
Alfred?

733
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,010
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

734
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,717
Page three.

735
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:56,260
Seems you made a series of large put
options on the futures exchange...

736
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,723
...verified by thumbprint.

737
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,560
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

738
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:05,774
Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud.
But for now, you're completely broke...

739
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,361
...and Wayne Enterprises is about to
fall into the hands of John Daggett.

740
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:13,369
The weapons. We can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences.

741
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,497
Applied Sciences is all
locked up and off the books.

742
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,875
The energy project, however,
is a different story.

743
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,535
Miranda Tate.

744
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,836
Let's convince the board to get behind her.
Let's show her the reactor.

745
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,501
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes,
so you better get dressed.

746
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:33,385
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

747
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,556
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

748
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,731
Please keep hands and feet
inside the car at all times.

749
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,109
This is it, isn't it?

750
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,283
The reactor is beneath the river...

751
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:57,572
...so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach.

752
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,204
Is Bruce Wayne
really that paranoid?

753
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,664
I'm gonna plead the
fifth on that one.

754
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,466
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.

755
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,301
No fossil fuels.

756
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,057
Free clean energy
for an entire city.

757
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,766
<i>DA: Three years ago, a Russian
scientist published a paper...</i>

758
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,226
<i>...on weaponized fusion reactions.</i>

759
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:29,316
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

760
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,189
I think this machine works.

761
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:38,988
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

762
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:42,249
Would it make you feel better to
know that the Russian scientist...

763
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,206
...died in a plane
crash six months ago?

764
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,872
Someone will work out
what Dr. Pavel did.

765
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:55,217
Someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon.

766
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,926
I need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises...

767
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,636
...and this reactor.

768
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,179
To do what with it?

769
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:05,848
Nothing.

770
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,559
Until we can guarantee its safety.

771
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,942
And if we can't?

772
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,774
Decommission it. Flood it.

773
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:15,737
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

774
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,526
If the world's not ready, yes.

775
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:21,993
Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.

776
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,741
I'm trusting you.

777
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,875
Doesn't count. You have no choice.

778
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,962
I could have flooded
this chamber at any time.

779
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,168
I'm choosing to trust you.

780
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,257
Please.

781
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:44,603
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
This meeting will now come to order.

782
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,935
I'd like to point out that we
have a non-board member here...

783
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,443
...which is highly irregular,
even if his family name is above the door.

784
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,854
Bruce Wayne's family
built this company.

785
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,772
And he himself has run it.

786
01:02:55,939 --> 01:03:00,695
Into the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree?
Check the share price this morning.

787
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,115
Crazy gambling on futures has not
only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...

788
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,580
...it's cost us all a lot of money.

789
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,585
And he has to go.

790
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,455
I'm afraid he has a point,
Mr. Wayne.

791
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,553
Now, back to business.

792
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,478
MAN 1: Mr. Wayne, over here! MAN 2:
How's it feel to be one of the people?

793
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:30,686
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car! I
didn't know what to do, they had paperwork.

794
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:34,152
Looks like you need a ride, huh?

795
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,530
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!

796
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:40,989
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne board?

797
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,324
She been meeting with him?
Sleeping with him?

798
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,456
- Not that we know of.
- You don't know much of anything, do you?

799
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,537
- Where's Bane?
- We told him it was urgent.

800
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,328
- Where is that masked--?
- Speak of the devil...

801
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,747
...and he shall appear.

802
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,382
What the hell is going on?

803
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,379
- The plan is proceeding as expected.
- Oh, really?

804
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,344
Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

805
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:08,182
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work, my friend.

806
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:13,476
And now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

807
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:18,568
How exactly is that supposed to
help my company absorb Wayne's?

808
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:23,527
- Leave us.
- No. You stay here.

809
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,286
I'm in charge.

810
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,449
Do you feel in charge?

811
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:35,247
I've paid you a small fortune.

812
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,383
And this gives you power over me?

813
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,380
What is this?

814
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:45,515
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...

815
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,008
...till now.

816
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,635
What are you?

817
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,645
I'm Gotham's reckoning.

818
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,683
Here to end the borrowed time
you've all been living on.

819
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,854
You're pure evil.

820
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,318
I'm necessary evil.

821
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,404
No. No, no, no!

822
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,456
When you started, why the mask?

823
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,289
- To protect the people closest to me.
- But you were a loner, right?

824
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,580
- You didn't have any family?
- There are always people you care about.

825
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,671
You just don't realize how
much until they're gone.

826
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,963
The idea was to be a symbol.

827
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,258
Batman could be anybody.

828
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,346
That was the point.

829
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,937
- Well, it was damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

830
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:37,359
- They'll figure that out in the end.
- You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

831
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,112
Yeah. I got 500 pages of tunnel
records and a flashlight.

832
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,365
I could use some help, actually.

833
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,234
You know what? Drop me in Old Town.

834
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,456
Hey, hey, hey. I don't think so!

835
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,787
- That's the way this works!
- I don't think so!

836
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,203
- That is the way--
- He's not a mark.

837
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,043
And he doesn't have a
cent to his name, anyway.

838
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:03,840
Yeah, it's not much. But it's
more than you've got right now.

839
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,425
Actually, they're letting
me keep the house.

840
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,182
The rich don't even go broke the
same as the rest of us, huh?

841
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,311
My powerful friend might hope to
change your mind about leaving.

842
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,098
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

843
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:18,938
- It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

844
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,360
He wants to meet tonight.

845
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,566
Why?

846
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,653
He needs to find Bane. Says you'd know how.

847
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,204
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay.

848
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,239
I like your place.

849
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,825
MT. Wayne?

850
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,706
I'm sorry they took all your money.

851
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,086
No, you're not.

852
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:47,008
- Can we help you, officer?
- Uh, yeah.

853
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,720
John Daggett's body was just found
in a Dumpster about an hour ago.

854
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,850
- Thought you might want to know.
- Why?

855
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:57,139
His name's all over these permits I just
pulled to, uh, map the tunnels under Gotham.

856
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:01,185
That's MTA maintenance, uh,
sewer construction, couple of other things.

857
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,355
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?

858
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,400
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out.

859
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,738
We've had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

860
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,246
Well, get more men.
Work a grid. I want him found.

861
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,748
Yeah, the, uh, masked man.
We're on it.

862
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,660
Lose the uniform, you're working for me now.

863
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,249
We could use some hotter heads around here.

864
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:25,542
- Sir, that could also be a coincidence.
- You're a detective now, son.

865
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,837
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence anymore.

866
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,561
Nobody's answering.

867
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,105
No.

868
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,941
I'm on my own now.

869
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,192
Do you have keys?

870
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,570
Never needed them.

871
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,991
Hope you didn't like
me for my money.

872
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,335
Suffering builds character.

873
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,924
I'll take care of your
parents' legacy, Bruce.

874
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,431
Who's this?

875
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,607
Where's Alfred?

876
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,769
He left...

877
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,405
...taking everything.

878
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,756
What's that?

879
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,846
My power's been shut off.

880
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,816
You're good at that.

881
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,857
When I was a child, we had almost nothing.

882
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:13,818
But on the nights when we had a fire,
we felt very rich indeed.

883
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,622
I assumed your family was wealthy.

884
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,907
Not always.

885
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,455
Not when I was young.

886
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,961
An old mistake.

887
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,957
I've made a few myself.

888
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,835
More than a few.

889
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,589
We could leave.

890
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,136
Tonight.

891
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:42,057
Take my plane,
go anywhere we wanted.

892
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,644
Someday, perhaps.

893
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,067
Not tonight.

894
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,097
Don't be shy.

895
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,681
Wayne says you can get me the clean slate.

896
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,763
- That depends.
- On what?

897
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,557
On what you want it for.

898
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,648
I acquired it to keep it
out of the wrong hands.

899
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,188
Still don't trust me, huh?

900
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,361
How can we change that?

901
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,322
Start by taking me to Bane.

902
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,955
You asked.

903
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,289
From here, Bane's men patrol the tunnels.

904
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,087
And they're not your
average brawlers.

905
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,082
Neither am I.

906
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:00,973
- He's behind you.
- Who?

907
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,179
Me.

908
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,314
What do you think you're--?

909
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,663
Just a little further.

910
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,419
I had to find a way to stop
them trying to kill me.

911
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:36,004
You made a serious mistake.

912
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:41,511
Not as serious as yours, I fear.

913
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,223
Bane.

914
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,480
Let's not stand on ceremony here...

915
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,067
...Mr. Wayne.

916
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,451
Peace has cost you your strength.

917
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,457
Victory has defeated you.

918
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:15,851
Theatricality and deception,
powerful agents to the uninitiated.

919
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:18,816
But we are initiated,
aren't we, Bruce?

920
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,573
Members of the League of Shadows.

921
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,945
And you betrayed us.

922
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,702
"Us"? You were excommunicated...

923
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,414
by a gang of psychopaths.

924
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,796
I am the League of Shadows.

925
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,087
And I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

926
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,736
You fight like a younger man.

927
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:02,192
Nothing held back.

928
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:05,575
Admirable, but mistaken.

929
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:13,583
Oh, you think
darkness is your ally?

930
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,460
But you merely adopted the dark.

931
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,167
I was born in it.

932
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,875
Molded by it.

933
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,137
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

934
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,549
By then, it was nothing to me but blinding!

935
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:36,522
The shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

936
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,114
I will show you where I have made my home...

937
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,617
...whilst preparing
to bring justice.

938
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,039
Then I will break you.

939
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,666
Your precious armory.

940
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,678
Gratefully accepted.
We will need it.

941
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:20,187
Ah, yes. I was wondering
what would break first.

942
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,735
Your spirit...

943
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,870
...or your body.

944
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,993
Get me Commissioner Gordon. I got a
line on the congressman's kidnapping.

945
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,261
- Excuse me, miss.
- Uh, yes?

946
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,597
I'm gonna need to see your ticket
and identification, please.

947
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,808
Oh. Do you mind?

948
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,737
I showed your picture to the
congressman. Guess what.

949
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,577
Don't tell me. Still in love?

950
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,288
Oh, head over heels.
Pressing charges, though.

951
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,205
You've made some mistakes,
Ms. Kyle.

952
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,337
- Girl's gotta eat.
- And you have an appetite.

953
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,920
Why would you run? You can't
hide with a record like this.

954
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,134
Maybe it's not you
I'm running from.

955
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,173
Who then? Bane?

956
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,808
What do you know about him?

957
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:22,313
That you should be as afraid of him as I am.

958
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,348
We can offer you protection.

959
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,690
Okay.

960
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:36,861
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.

961
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,240
Did they kill him?

962
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,619
I'm not sure.

963
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,057
Why didn't you just...

964
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,230
<i>...kill me?</i>

965
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,863
You don't fear death,
you welcome it.

966
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:16,150
Your punishment
must be more severe.

967
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,494
Torture?

968
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,911
Yes.

969
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,740
But not of your body.

970
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,878
Of your soul.

971
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,456
Where am I?

972
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:32,045
Home.

973
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,924
Where I learned the
truth about despair.

974
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,264
As will you.

975
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:42,476
There is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth:

976
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,637
Hope.

977
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,932
Every man who has rotted
here over the centuries...

978
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:51,523
...has looked up to the light and
imagined climbing to freedom.

979
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:53,946
So easy.

980
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,107
So simple.

981
01:18:57,066 --> 01:19:02,664
And like shipwrecked men turning to
seawater from uncontrollable thirst...

982
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,708
...many have died trying.

983
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:11,297
I learned here there can be
no true despair without hope.

984
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,839
So as I terrorize Gotham...

985
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:19,972
...I will feed its people
hope to poison their souls.

986
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,930
I will let them believe
that they can survive...

987
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:29,065
...so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun.

988
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,021
You can watch me
torture an entire city.

989
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:39,318
And then when you have truly
understood the depth of your failure...

990
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,578
...we will fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

991
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,163
We will destroy Gotham.

992
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,920
And then, when it is done...

993
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:53,998
...and Gotham is...

994
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,210
...ashes...

995
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,634
...then you have my
permission to die.

996
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,442
You're locking her up in here?

997
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:25,454
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need.

998
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,707
First time she broke out of
women's correctional, she was 16.

999
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,038
Little closer, baby.

1000
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,294
Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?

1001
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,380
She's gonna be fine.

1002
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,422
I still don't see the need of a board
meeting for the energy project.

1003
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,178
Bruce got a lot of things right.

1004
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,840
Keeping the board in the
dark was not one of them.

1005
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,893
How good of you to join us.

1006
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,222
Chair. President.

1007
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:55,063
All I need now is one more
ordinary board member.

1008
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,650
Mr. Fox, would you
like to nominate?

1009
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,064
No.

1010
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,732
I will volunteer.

1011
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,822
Where are you taking us?

1012
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:17,297
You were right, commissioner.
Will you excuse us, please?

1013
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,670
What happened?

1014
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,960
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.

1015
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,050
He let most of them go,
but he took three into the sewers.

1016
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,557
No more patrols.
No more hide and seek.

1017
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,434
Get every available cop down
there and smoke him out!

1018
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,140
The mayor won't want panic.

1019
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,476
So it's a training exercise.

1020
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,314
I'm sorry I didn't
take you seriously.

1021
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,150
Not you.

1022
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,690
You're telling me
the Batman's gone...

1023
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:47,578
...so you chase up the Daggett
leads any way you can.

1024
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,950
Yes, sir.

1025
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:04,846
He asks how much you would
pay us to let you die.

1026
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,005
I told him. I told
him you have nothing.

1027
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,008
Do it for the pleasure.

1028
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,478
They pay me more than
that to keep you alive.

1029
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,112
He will try the climb.

1030
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,046
Has anyone ever made it?

1031
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,423
Of course not.

1032
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,303
He says there is one who did.

1033
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,813
A child.

1034
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,104
<i>A child born in this hell</i>

1035
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,611
Bane.

1036
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,906
An old legend. Nothing more.

1037
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:10,865
Don't.

1038
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:15,408
Whatever it is they want you to see,
it's happening soon.

1039
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,810
Fire in the hole!

1040
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,049
Turn it on.

1041
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,607
I only need one other board member.
There are eight others waiting.

1042
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,233
I won't do it.

1043
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,772
All right, stop.

1044
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,235
Lucius, you'll kill this man,
and yourself...

1045
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,196
...and you'll barely
slow them down.

1046
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:00,020
Go on, then. Do your work.

1047
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,143
Take them up to the surface.

1048
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,186
People of their status...

1049
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:12,609
...deserve to experience the
next era of western civilization.

1050
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:20,742
<i>KE: I've been to half of Daggett's
cement plants and locations
they poured underground.</i>

1051
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:23,285
<i>GORDON Anything strange about the pourings?</i>

1052
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:27,252
Honestly, commissioner, I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1053
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,338
But you know about patterns. Keep looking.

1054
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:36,882
<i>L: It's done</i>

1055
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:41,395
This is now a 4-megaton
nuclear bomb.

1056
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,391
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1057
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,810
No, you cannot.

1058
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,819
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1059
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,077
If you move it, the core will
decay in a matter of months.

1060
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,408
Five, by my calculations.

1061
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,244
And then it will go off!

1062
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:07,004
And for the sake of your children,
Dr. Pavel...

1063
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,415
...indeed I hope it does.

1064
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:12,756
Hey. Hey!

1065
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:17,840
That was you in front of the
stock exchange, wasn't it?

1066
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:20,138
- When?
- When?

1067
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,601
When cops were trying to pull onto Castle
Street and your truck was shutting them out.

1068
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:28,313
- Oh, yeah. You're the cop.
- Detective now.

1069
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:32,480
And, uh, as a detective, we're not
allowed to believe in coincidence.

1070
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:45,243
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1071
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,296
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1072
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:59,010
I got two dead witnesses and a lot
of questions. Call me whenev--

1073
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:02,768
Wait a minute. I'm looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene.

1074
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,806
That looks like motor
oil right next to it.

1075
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:10,192
Jesus, they're not making cement.
They're making explosives.

1076
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,652
<i- >- - Patch me in to Foley.
Foley's overseeing the operation.</i>

1077
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:22,162
They're heading into a trap!

1078
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:26,033
<i>ER: We're seeing thousands of police
heading into the sewers.</i>

1079
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,669
- Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands.
- It's a training exercise, that's all.

1080
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:33,878
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
to watch our boys thrash Rapid City.

1081
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,794
<i- >- - Foley. - It's a trap!
Pull everyone out!</i>

1082
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,508
Bane has been pouring concrete...

1083
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,639
-...laced with explosives!
- Where?

1084
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:51,393
<i>Oh, say, can you see By the
dawn's early light</i>

1085
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,945
<i>What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's...</i>

1086
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:02,028
<i>KE: There's a ring around the
tunnels! They'll blow it and
trap the cops underground!</i>

1087
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,955
Pull them out. Pull them out now!

1088
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:10,210
<i>ER: Through the perilous fight</i>

1089
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:14,502
<i>O'er the ramparts we watched</i>

1090
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,090
<i>Were so gallantly streaming</i>

1091
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:23,299
<i>And the rockets' red glare</i>

1092
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,720
<i>The bombs bursting in air</i>

1093
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,979
<i>Gave proof through--</i>

1094
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,353
That's a lovely, lovely voice.

1095
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:36,646
<i>--That our ï¬,ag was still there</i>

1096
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:46,289
<i>Oh, say does that star-spangled
banner Yet wave</i>

1097
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:52,708
<i>O'er the land of the free</i>

1098
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:59,718
<i>And the home of the brave</i>

1099
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,937
Let the games begin.

1100
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,307
Everybody okay?

1101
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,980
COP 2: Let's move! Move,
move! COP 3: Go, go!

1102
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,488
Gotham...

1103
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,454
...take control.

1104
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,626
Take control of your city.

1105
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:06,711
- Foley.
- Jesus, Blake.

1106
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,801
Every cop in the city's
in those tunnels.

1107
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,258
Not every cop.

1108
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,408
Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer.
I need your car right now.

1109
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,536
Clear the corners, rookie.

1110
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:23,914
Get my coat, son.

1111
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,832
This...

1112
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,795
This is the instrument
of your liberation.

1113
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,308
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1114
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,432
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1115
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:46,145
Identify yourself to the world.

1116
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:51,905
Dr. Leonid Pavel,
nuclear physicist.

1117
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,619
Pavel was confirmed dead.

1118
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:58,328
Plane crash on an agency pull
out of Uzbekistan, but...

1119
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:00,450
It looks like it's him.

1120
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:03,996
And what...? What is this?

1121
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:08,042
It's a fully primed neutron bomb...

1122
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:10,586
...with a blast
radius of six miles.

1123
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,798
And who is capable of
disarming such a device?

1124
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,180
Only me.

1125
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:20,554
Only you.

1126
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,852
Thank you, good doctor!

1127
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,734
Now, this bomb is armed!

1128
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,490
And this bomb is mobile!

1129
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:37,200
And the identity of the
triggerman is a mystery.

1130
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:42,584
For one of you holds the detonator!
