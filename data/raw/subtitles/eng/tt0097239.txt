1
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,125
I'm gone to the market, Idella.

2
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:10,633
Pepsodent's new improved formula
cleans teeth whiter than ever.

3
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,968
Are you all right, Miss Daisy?

4
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,395
That's good!

5
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,856
You two get back to work.

6
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,058
- Mama!
- No!

7
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:00,063
It's a miracle you're not laying at
Emory Hospital or the funeral parlor.

8
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,302
Cucumbers are pretty this summer.

9
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,910
You didn't even break your glasses.

10
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:08,979
It was the car's fault!

11
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,413
- You had the car in the wrong gear.
- I did not!

12
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,651
Idella, want a pickle with lunch?

13
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,082
Not me.

14
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:19,416
I'm putting up a jar for
you to take home to William.

15
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,822
You backed the car into
the Pollack's yard.

16
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:28,262
You should have let me keep my Lasalle.
It wouldn't have behaved this way.

17
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,935
Mama, cars don't behave.
They are behaved upon.

18
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,605
You demolished that
Chrysler by yourself.

19
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,833
Think what you want.
I know the truth.

20
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:40,611
The truth is you just cost
the insurance company $2,700.

21
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,609
You are a terrible risk.

22
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,841
Nobody will issue you a policy now.

23
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,351
You're just saying that to be hateful.

24
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:51,447
Okay. Yes, I am!
I am making it all up.

25
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,618
Look out on the driveway!

26
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,957
Every insurance company in
America is out there...

27
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,689
...waving their pens
to get you to sign up.

28
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:04,631
If you're going to stand in my pantry
and lie like a rug, go somewhere else.

29
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,466
I better get back to the office.

30
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,710
Florine will have a fit if I don't
get home on time tonight.

31
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,812
You all must have plans tonight.

32
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,711
The Ansleys' dinner party.

33
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,317
This is her idea of heaven on earth.

34
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,552
What?

35
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,313
Socializing with Episcopalians.

36
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,390
You are a doodle, Mama!

37
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,559
I'll stop by tomorrow evening.

38
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,233
How do you know I'll be here?

39
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,334
I'm not dependent on you for company.

40
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,662
Fine, I'll call first.

41
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:43,407
But you know, we have got some
real serious talking to do.

42
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,666
No!

43
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,717
I need you now. I have to be at
the beauty shop in half an hour.

44
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:33,457
No, I most certainly did not know you
had to call a minimum of 2 hours ahead.

45
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:38,288
Why call yourself a taxicab company
if you can't provide taxicabs?

46
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,460
Why don't you call your son?
He'd send someone to carry you.

47
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,397
That won't be necessary.

48
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,730
I'll cancel the appointment
and fix my own hair.

49
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:52,409
Sometimes I think you ain't
got the sense God gave a lemon.

50
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,147
Two dots. I want that!

51
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,476
And a five bamboo.

52
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,746
Well, this is not my day for mah-jongg.

53
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:04,980
Nine bam!

54
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:09,823
Thank you all for coming here again.
I am a real pariah without my car.

55
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,587
Oh, nonsense!

56
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,656
When do you get the new one?

57
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,997
I don't know! Boolie's
being real pokey about it.

58
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,671
I'll come after you for temple tomorrow.

59
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,931
That's sweet of you, honey.

60
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,010
Mama, you there?

61
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,112
It's just us!

62
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,773
Why didn't you call?

63
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,110
We can't stay.

64
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:33,684
So I gather.

65
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,785
The Millers are giving a hay ride.

66
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,289
I had these made.
Doesn't your baby look cute?

67
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,359
Well, it's not exactly
the word I'd pick.

68
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,797
New Graham Greene?
I been wanting to read that.

69
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,297
Sorry, but it's due back
at the library tomorrow.

70
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,698
- Want me to return it for you?
- No, thank you.

71
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,635
I'll go to the library on the streetcar.

72
00:07:56,377 --> 00:08:00,871
Damn it, Mama! Quit being so stubborn.
You know perfectly well...

73
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,216
Go on! Don't keep the horses waiting.

74
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,145
Bye!

75
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,658
Is that door making contact?

76
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,730
Oscar?

77
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:29,898
I'm here.

78
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,739
- Are you all right?
- No, sir, I'm stuck.

79
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,174
I know. Fiddle with the lever.

80
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,909
It fiddled out. I done all I know how.

81
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,683
Call Bell Elevator.

82
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:45,255
I already did. They're
backed up until around 1:00.

83
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,253
Did you tell them it's an emergency!

84
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,928
You don't have to holler, Mr. Werthan.

85
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,427
I did not break the elevator.

86
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,191
Got that stuff for Davis & Paxon?

87
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:57,097
Wrapped and ready to go!

88
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,933
I promised it for today.
Call Bell again.

89
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,611
I hear you.

90
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:12,876
Look up where the gate is supposed
to close. See a do-hickey?

91
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,384
Wait a minute.

92
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:16,778
Right here!

93
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:20,222
Reach up and mash it
up until it catches.

94
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,127
I done it. Now what?

95
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,055
Operate the lever.

96
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,643
Do you work here?

97
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,474
No, sir. This here Hoke.

98
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,080
Hoke Colburn, sir.

99
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,748
How'd you know about the elevator?

100
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,250
I used to drive for a dairy, sir.

101
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,316
Their elevator was
worse than this one.

102
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,651
Hoke the one I told you about.

103
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,984
Of course.

104
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,437
Excuse me, sir.

105
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,766
Y'all people's Jewish, ain't you?

106
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,342
Yeah, we are. Why?

107
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,773
I'd rather work for Jews.

108
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,844
I know folks say they stingy and cheap.

109
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,347
But don't say none of that around me!

110
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,281
Good to know you feel that way.

111
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,077
What was your last job?

112
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:49,477
I worked for Judge Harold
Stone, a Jewish gentleman.

113
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,149
You worked for Judge Stone?

114
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:55,411
Seven years. I'd still be
there if he didn't up and die.

115
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:58,589
Mrs. Stone asked me to move
to Savannah with her.

116
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,260
Of course, my wife was dead by then.

117
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,656
But I said, "No, thank you, ma'am."

118
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,593
I didn't want to be too
far from my grandbabies.

119
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,428
Judge Stone was my father's friend.

120
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,000
You don't say?

121
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,100
Sit.

122
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,996
Later, Miss McClatchey.

123
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,340
Oscar said you needed somebody
to drive for your family.

124
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,174
Will I be taking your
children to school...

125
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,441
...and your wife to the beauty parlor?

126
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,448
I don't have any children.
What I need...

127
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,114
You're still a young man.
Don't worry too much.

128
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,621
Thank you. I won't.

129
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,120
Hoke, I need somebody
to drive my mother around.

130
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,300
Yes. Well, if you don't
mind my asking, sir...

131
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,128
...why ain't she hiring for herself?

132
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,633
It's a difficult situation.

133
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,969
She done gone around the bend a little.

134
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,375
That will happen as they get on.

135
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,140
No, she's all there!

136
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,483
Too much there is the problem!

137
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,718
I want you to understand something.

138
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,060
My mother is a little high strung.

139
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,656
The fact is, you would
be working for me.

140
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,233
She can say anything she likes...

141
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,495
...but she can't fire you. Understand?

142
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,838
Yes, sir.

143
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,004
Yes, sir, I sure do.

144
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,008
Don't worry, Mr. Werthan.

145
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,076
I'll hold on no matter
which way she run me.

146
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,514
I was a little boy back on the farm
above Macon where I come from.

147
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,688
I wrestled hogs to the
ground during killing time.

148
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:41,517
Well, sir, there ain't a
hog got away from me yet!

149
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,304
How are you, Idella?

150
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,738
Living.

151
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,243
- Where's the new vacuum cleaner?
- In the closet.

152
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,643
She won't touch it.

153
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,580
It gives me a shock
every time I'm near it.

154
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,085
It works for me.

155
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:46,248
Good! Then you clean and I'll
go down and run your office.

156
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,325
Where's Mama?

157
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:49,926
Up yonder.

158
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,094
I guess you know who this is.

159
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,926
I'll be right back.

160
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,331
I wouldn't be in your shoes...

161
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:06,505
...if the sweet Lord Jesus came
down and asked me Himself.

162
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,283
Good morning, Mama.

163
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,697
Just come down and say hello.

164
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,460
You listen here.

165
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,539
Unless they rewrote the Constitution
and didn't tell me, I still have rights!

166
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:36,798
Of course.

167
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:41,640
What I do not want, and absolutely
will not have, is...

168
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:46,214
...some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen,
gobbling my food, using my phone.

169
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,147
I hate that in my house.

170
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,480
You have Idella.

171
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,716
Idella's different!
She's been coming to me for years.

172
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,223
We stay out of each other's way.

173
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,828
Even so, there are chips
in my wedding china.

174
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,399
You think Idella has a vendetta
against your wedding china?

175
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't be sassy.

176
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,396
When we couldn't afford them,
we did for ourselves.

177
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,235
That's still the best way.

178
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,673
"Them?" "Afford them?"
You sound like Governor Talmadge.

179
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,906
What a thing to say!
I'm not prejudiced!

180
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,911
Aren't you ashamed?!

181
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,250
You might as well make the best of it.

182
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,476
I knew a Miss Idella once.
Back down in Macon.

183
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,244
You don't say?

184
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:30,912
She sang!

185
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,419
What are you talking about?

186
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,992
I'm talking about this
woman had some lungs!

187
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:39,255
She'd be a whole church
choir by herself!

188
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,659
I declare!

189
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,263
Fat, too!

190
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,266
She was as big as that stove!

191
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,370
Don't talk to Idella!
She has work to do.

192
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,951
What are you doing?

193
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,624
Dusting the bulbs, Miss Daisy.

194
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,285
That's the silliest thing I ever saw.

195
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,691
Who cares if lamp bulbs are dusty?

196
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,356
Get down from there!

197
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,030
Put that ladder away
before somebody trips.

198
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,476
I'm gone, Miss Daisy.

199
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,043
All right, Idella. See you tomorrow.

200
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,977
- I'm going too, Miss Daisy.
- Good.

201
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,163
Good morning, Miss Daisy.
Thought I'd see after your zinnias.

202
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,668
Leave me flower bed alone.

203
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:59,672
You got a nice piece of ground behind
the garage that ain't doing nothing.

204
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,437
I could put in tomatoes...

205
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,912
If I want a vegetable garden,
I'll plant it myself.

206
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,779
What are you doing?

207
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,881
I just love a house with
pictures, Miss Daisy.

208
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,616
It do make a home.

209
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:51,057
I don't want you nosing
through my things.

210
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,236
Good morning, Miss Daisy.

211
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,977
It was right cold in the night.

212
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,580
I wouldn't know. I was asleep.

213
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,214
Idella says we're
running short on coffee...

214
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,757
...and Dutch cleanser.

215
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,415
We are?

216
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,649
Yes, ma'am.

217
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,160
We're low on silver polish, too.

218
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,822
I know.

219
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:31,093
I'm fixing to go to the
Piggly Wiggly on the trolley.

220
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:35,101
On the trolley!
Why don't you let me carry you?

221
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,502
No, thank you.

222
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,871
Ain't that why Mr. Werthan hired me?

223
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,706
That's his problem.

224
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:45,115
All right. But I'm going to
find something to do here.

225
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,116
You leave my things alone!

226
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,620
I'm gone to the market, Idella.

227
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,953
Miss Daisy, it's a shame.

228
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,957
You have this fine Hudson
automobile out there in the garage.

229
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:02,191
It hasn't moved an inch from
when Mr. Werthan drove it here.

230
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:06,196
That insurance company gave you
a brand new car for nothing.

231
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:07,735
That's your opinion.

232
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:13,476
My other opinion is that a fine rich,
Jewish lady like yourself...

233
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:18,548
...has no business dragging herself
onto a trolley carrying grocery bags.

234
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,713
I'll carry them for you.

235
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,318
I don't need you!

236
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,749
I don't want you!
And don't say I'm rich!

237
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,858
- I won't say it no more.
- Is that what you and Idella talk about?

238
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,056
I hate being discussed behind
my back in my own house!

239
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,562
I was born on Forsyth Street.

240
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,997
Believe me. I know
the value of a penny!

241
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,671
My brother brought
home a white cat once.

242
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,002
We couldn't keep it because
we couldn't afford to feed it!

243
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,004
My sister saved up money...

244
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,413
...so I could become a teacher!
We had nothing!

245
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:53,850
But you're doing all right now!

246
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,566
What are you doing?!

247
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,336
I'm trying to drive you to the store!

248
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,751
Where are you off to this
morning, Miss Werthan?

249
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,685
Just a little shopping.

250
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,193
Go away! I've ridden the trolley
with the groceries plenty of times!

251
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,265
But I can't keep taking
Mr. Werthan's money for doing nothing.

252
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,263
How much he pay you?

253
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:47,366
Miss Daisy, that's between him and me.

254
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:51,941
Anything over $7 a week
is highway robbery!

255
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:54,271
You sure are right about that!

256
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,481
Especially since I don't do nothing...

257
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,676
...but sit on a stool all day.

258
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:01,947
All right!

259
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,554
Piggly Wiggly.

260
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,786
Then home. Nowhere else.

261
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:26,406
Oh, I just love the smell of a new car.

262
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,477
Don't you, Miss Daisy?

263
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,142
I am nobody's fool, Hoke.

264
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,751
I know!

265
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:38,423
My husband taught me to run a car.

266
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,591
I remember everything he said.

267
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,490
So don't think even for a second you...

268
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,664
Wait. You're speeding.

269
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,164
I can see it!

270
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,992
We only going 19 miles an hour.

271
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:53,603
I like to go under the speed limit.

272
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,098
But the speed limit is 35 here.

273
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,004
The slower you go the more gas you save.

274
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,440
My husband taught me that!

275
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:06,179
Ain't hardly moving.
Might as well walk...

276
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,009
...to Piggly Wiggly.

277
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,248
Is this your car?

278
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:12,784
No.

279
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:14,618
Do you pay for the gas?

280
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,630
- No.
- All right, then!

281
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,297
My son thinks I'm losing my abilities...

282
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,867
...but I am still in control
of what goes on in my car!

283
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:29,964
Where are you going?

284
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,968
To the store, like you said.

285
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,203
Why didn't you turn on Highland?

286
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,472
Piggly Wiggly ain't on Highland.

287
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,983
I know where it is!
Now take Highland Avenue.

288
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:44,055
- That's 3 blocks out of the way.
- Go back this minute!

289
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:47,122
- I can't turn now.
- I've been driving to Piggly Wiggly...

290
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:50,990
...since it opened for business.
This isn't the way!

291
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,887
Go back this minute!

292
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,558
Miss Daisy, look. Yonder
is the Piggly Wiggly. See?

293
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,899
Get ready to turn.

294
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,245
Careful. There's a little girl.

295
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,143
Yes, I see her.

296
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,908
Pull in here.

297
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:23,922
Wait.

298
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,863
Give me the keys.

299
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,099
Stay right here by the car.

300
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,102
And don't tell everyone my business.

301
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,065
Mr. Werthan?

302
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:08,067
Yes, sir, it's me! Guess where I'm at.

303
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:11,399
I just drove your mama to the store!

304
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:16,913
You know, she flapped around some,
but she's all right. She's in the store.

305
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:22,246
Oh, Lord, she just looked
out the window and seen me.

306
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,980
She'll probably throw a fit right
there at the check-out counter.

307
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:31,327
Yes, sir. You are right about that.
It only took me 6 days.

308
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:34,589
Same time it took the
Lord to make the world.

309
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,433
Yes, sir. All right. 'Bye.

310
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:51,947
Hey Oscar, Junior. How you
old boys doing today?

311
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,116
How the lady been treating you?

312
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:58,117
I'll tell you one thing;
she knows how to throw a fit.

313
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:00,619
What's so funny?

314
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,797
Nothing, Miss Daisy.
We just carrying on.

315
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:10,196
Oscar and Junior been doing cleaning
here for 15 years. Never carried on before!

316
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:12,535
Leave them alone.

317
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:14,963
Put your coat on.
We're late.

318
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,141
Idella, I'm gone now.

319
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:22,137
I'm right behind her.

320
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:34,319
Hear, oh Israel, the Lord
our God, the Lord is one.

321
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:23,198
Such a nice man. And such a good,
short sermon, wasn't it?

322
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,278
I can get it myself!

323
00:27:33,553 --> 00:27:35,043
Hurry out of here!

324
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,235
Is something wrong, Miss Daisy?

325
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,231
Something I done?

326
00:28:00,313 --> 00:28:01,473
Yes.

327
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,738
I haven't done anything.

328
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:08,818
You parked the car right in front of the
temple, like I was the Queen of Romania.

329
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,749
Everybody saw you!

330
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:12,988
I said to wait for me in back.

331
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,251
Yes, Ma'am, but I was just trying to...

332
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:19,087
There were two chauffeurs
right behind me.

333
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:22,492
You made me look like a fool.
A g.d. fool!

334
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:26,932
Oh, Miss Daisy, Lord
knows you ain't no fool!

335
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,671
Slow down!

336
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,944
Miriam and Beulah, I could see what
they were thinking when we came out.

337
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:36,512
What's that?

338
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,444
That I was pretending to be rich!

339
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:42,017
- You is rich.
- No, I'm not!

340
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,449
Nobody can say I put on airs.

341
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,285
On Forsyth Street we made many
meals of grits and gravy.

342
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,688
I have done without plenty of times.

343
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:54,956
Miss Daisy, if I was to ever
get my hands on what you got...

344
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:59,461
...shoot, I'd shake it around
for everyone in the world to see.

345
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:02,367
That's vulgar! Don't talk to me!

346
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,205
Never understand some white folks.

347
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,377
What was that?! I heard that!

348
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:13,207
Now, Miss Daisy...
you needs a chauffeur...

349
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:15,717
...and Lord knows I need a job.

350
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,980
So why don't we just leave it at that?

351
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,271
Good morning, Mama.
What's the matter?

352
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:22,384
No, I don't always think
something's wrong when you call.

353
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,953
Just when you call so early.

354
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:27,518
What?!

355
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:33,221
All right. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

356
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,731
I better get on over there.

357
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,232
'Bye.

358
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,063
Come on.

359
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:46,236
It's not healthy to rush like this.

360
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,740
I eat too much, anyway.

361
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,250
Besides, it sounds like she needs me.

362
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:55,750
When doesn't it?
Give Mother Werthan my love.

363
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,655
Coffee, Katie Bell!

364
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,902
I didn't expect to
find you in one piece.

365
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,772
I wanted you to be here
when he comes.

366
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,404
I wanted you to hear it
for yourself.

367
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,242
What is going on?

368
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,644
He's stealing from me.

369
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,150
Hoke? Are you sure?

370
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:32,414
I don't make empty accusations.
I have proof!

371
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:37,819
This! I found it hidden in the
garbage under some coffee grounds.

372
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:41,832
- He stole a can of salmon?
- Here it is!

373
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,592
I knew there was something funny.

374
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:48,432
They all take things, you know.
So I counted.

375
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,002
The silverware first.

376
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:54,678
Then the linen napkins.
And then I went into the pantry.

377
00:31:55,948 --> 00:32:00,112
And the first thing that
caught my eye was a hole...

378
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,013
...behind the lima beans.

379
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,447
And I knew right away.

380
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,193
There are only 8 cans of salmon.
I had 9!

381
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,851
3 for $1 on sale.

382
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,791
Very clever, Mama.

383
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,794
I missed my breakfast and
I'm late to a meeting...

384
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,299
...for a 33c can of salmon?

385
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,628
You want 33c? Here's $1!

386
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:23,798
Here's $10! Buy yourself
a pantry full of salmon!

387
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,637
Why, Boolie, the idea!

388
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,972
Waving money at me like that!

389
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,648
I don't want money.
I want my things!

390
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:34,316
- One can of salmon?
- Well, it was mine!

391
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:37,816
I leave him plenty of food every day.

392
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,648
I tell him exactly what it is.

393
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:44,488
Like children. If they want
something, they just take it!

394
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,388
He'll never admit this.

395
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,728
"No," he'll say, "I don't
know nothing about that!"

396
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:53,836
I don't like it! I don't
like living with no privacy.

397
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:59,511
Go ahead, defend him.
You always do!

398
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:04,246
I give up! You want to drive again,
arrange your own insurance.

399
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:05,677
Take the trolley.

400
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:08,851
Buy yourself a taxicab!
Anything you want!

401
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,349
Just leave me out of it!

402
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,251
Why, Boolie!

403
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:21,856
What's he doing here
this time of morning?

404
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,863
Can't be good, I promise you that!

405
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:41,552
I think it's fixing to
clear up out there!

406
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,050
Excuse me, Mr. Werthan.
Y'all busy?

407
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:48,284
We have to have a little talk, Hoke.

408
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:53,559
All right, just let me
get out of my coat.

409
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:04,799
Yesterday, while you were out,
I ate a can of your salmon.

410
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:09,411
Now I know you said to eat
the leftover pork chops.

411
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,980
Well, they were kind of stiff.

412
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:15,810
So, I stopped by the Piggly
Wiggly and got you another can.

413
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,147
Do you want me to put it on the shelf?

414
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,086
Yes, thank you, Hoke.

415
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:24,256
Be right with you, Mr. Werthan.

416
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,928
Well, I got to get dressed now.

417
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,430
Good-bye, son.

418
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,934
You know, Miss Daisy,
I was just thinking.

419
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:20,108
We been out to this cemetery
3 times this month already.

420
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,871
It ain't even the 20th yet.

421
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,775
It's good to come in nice weather.

422
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:27,541
Yes, ma'am. You sure
right about that. Sure is.

423
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:33,121
Mr. Sig's grave is mighty well tended.

424
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,051
I think you're the best widow
in the State of Georgia.

425
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:41,389
Boolie's always pestering me to have
the staff here tend to this plot.

426
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:44,066
"Perpetual care," they call it.

427
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,461
Well, don't you do it!

428
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,468
It's right to have member of
the family looking after you.

429
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:55,407
I'll never have that! Boolie will have
me in perpetual care before I'm cold.

430
00:36:56,915 --> 00:37:00,407
Miss Daisy, you ought to
go on away from here!

431
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:05,588
Put that azalea on Leo Bauer's grave.

432
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:10,251
Leo Bauer. Is that Miss
Rose Bauer's husband?

433
00:37:10,763 --> 00:37:13,254
She asked me to bring it out here.

434
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,595
Where is his grave at, Miss Daisy?

435
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,834
I'm not exactly sure. I know
it's two rows over that way.

436
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:26,007
You'll see the headstone, "Bauer."

437
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,110
What's wrong?

438
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:34,446
Nothing wrong.
Nothing the matter at all.

439
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,291
Now, you say...

440
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:47,796
I told you it's two rows over that way.
It says "Bauer" on the headstone.

441
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:51,663
What that look like?

442
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,536
What are you talking about?

443
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,871
I'm talking about I can't read, ma'am.

444
00:37:59,144 --> 00:37:59,906
What?!

445
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,110
I can't read, Miss Daisy.

446
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:04,711
You look at the paper all the time.

447
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:08,646
Well, that's just it. I just be looking!

448
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,319
I try to dope out what's going on...

449
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:12,888
...from the pictures.

450
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,648
You know your letters?

451
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:18,488
Yes, ma'am. I know my ABC's.
I just can't read.

452
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:21,024
Stop saying that!
You're making me mad!

453
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,491
If you know letters, then you can read.

454
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,734
You just don't know you can read.

455
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:31,336
I taught some of the stupidest
children God ever put on this earth.

456
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:34,740
And they all could read enough
to find a name on a tombstone.

457
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,674
The name is "Bauer."

458
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,083
"Bauer!" What does that "buh"
letter sound like?

459
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,186
- B?
- Of course!

460
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,855
"Er." That is the last part. "Bauer!"

461
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,761
What letter sounds like "er"?

462
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,193
R!

463
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,567
- So the first letter is...
- B!

464
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,072
And the last letter?

465
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,298
R!

466
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:07,542
B-R. Brr.

467
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,441
It even sounds like Bauer, doesn't it?

468
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:14,944
It sure do, Miss Daisy! It sure do!

469
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,781
- That it?
- That's it.

470
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,552
- What about the middle?
- Not right now.

471
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:28,732
This will be enough for you to find it.

472
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:53,755
B at the beginning.

473
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,421
R at the end.

474
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,763
B... R.

475
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:08,270
That's it.

476
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:11,102
That's all right!

477
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,017
I sure do appreciate this!

478
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,459
Don't be ridiculous!

479
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:37,632
Let's get all this back in the car.
I'm burning up.

480
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,524
Of course I told you!

481
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,220
Of course I told you!

482
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:11,225
How can I be expected to buy it
if you don't write it down?!

483
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,334
I'm sorry, Miss Florine.

484
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,334
I need you.

485
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,342
I'll be right there.

486
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:26,415
Do you have any idea what it takes
to give a Christmas reception?

487
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:28,743
It takes an eye for detail.

488
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:33,347
I told you a million times,
Katie Bell, write it down!

489
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:35,683
More I cannot do!

490
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,022
We are out of coconut.

491
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,094
I'm sure we can manage.

492
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:43,359
- I told her.
- You didn't write it down!

493
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:47,603
I don't need to stand and
listen to excuses on Christmas.

494
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,704
You figure out how to serve ambrosia to
50 people without coconut. I give up!

495
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:01,552
Don't worry, Katie Bell.
It's not quite the end of the world.

496
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:16,899
Everybody's giving the Georgia
Power Company a merry Christmas.

497
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:21,972
Bet Miss Florine beat them all,
especially with the new house.

498
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,229
Absurd!

499
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:28,310
If I had a nose like Florine, I wouldn't
say, "Merry Christmas" to anybody.

500
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,084
I enjoy Christmas at their house.

501
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,254
No wonder. You're the
only Christian in the place.

502
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:41,322
They got that new cook.

503
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:46,257
Florine never could keep help.
Of course, it's none of my affair.

504
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:50,496
Too much running around.
The Garden Club this...

505
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:54,002
...the Junior League that.
As if they'd give her the time of day.

506
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:58,936
She'd die before she'd fix a glass of
iced tea for the Temple Sisterhood.

507
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:04,846
I hope she doesn't take it into
her head to sing this year.

508
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:13,180
Lord have mercy!
Look what Miss Florine done.

509
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:17,121
If her grandfather, old man
Frietag, could see this.

510
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:18,952
What is it you say?

511
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:23,531
I bet he'd jump out of his
grave and snatch her baldheaded.

512
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:35,473
Jump up and snatch her baldheaded.

513
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:40,381
Oh, Miss Daisy, you
go on away from here.

514
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:50,725
Wait a minute.

515
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,220
This isn't a Christmas present.

516
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:56,823
You know I don't give
Christmas presents.

517
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,730
I happened to run
across it this morning.

518
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:02,503
Well, go on, open it.

519
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:11,679
Look at that.

520
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:15,080
Ain't nobody never gave
me no book before.

521
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:19,513
"Zaner Method Writing."

522
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:22,918
I always taught out of these.
I saved a few.

523
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:26,427
It's faded, but it works.

524
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:29,097
If you practice, you'll write nicely.

525
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,925
But you have to practice.

526
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,703
I taught Mayor Hartsfield
out of the same book.

527
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,499
I sure do thank you.

528
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,370
It's not a Christmas present.

529
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:42,603
Jews have no business
giving Christmas presents.

530
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:46,384
You don't have to go yapping
about this to Boolie or Florine.

531
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:48,449
This is between you and me.

532
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,886
Merry Christmas, Mother Werthan.

533
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:54,385
I hope I don't spit up.

534
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:56,717
Merry Christmas, Mama. Hoke.

535
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:43,104
She fought me on this one.

536
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:45,940
But it is time for a trade.

537
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,506
I'll bet you'll miss the old one.

538
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:52,773
No, sir, I don't expect
I'll miss it that much.

539
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:56,781
Come on, you're the only one
who's driven it all this time.

540
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,022
Won't you be a little
sorry to see it go?

541
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,182
It ain't going nowhere.
I done bought it.

542
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:03,516
You didn't.

543
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:07,128
I sure did. Already made the
deal with Mr. Red Mitchell.

544
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:08,796
How much?

545
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,796
That is for him and me to know.

546
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:13,297
Hey, Boolie!

547
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,200
Got a gem here.

548
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:16,697
Got that paper, Hoke?

549
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,036
I got it right here.

550
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:20,438
Be right there.

551
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:24,309
Why didn't you buy it from Mama?
Would have saved money.

552
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:27,985
No, sir. Your mama is in my
business enough as it is.

553
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,211
I ain't studying about making
monthly payments to her.

554
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:33,882
She is mine the regular way.

555
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,154
The Hudson's a good car.

556
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,325
Nobody knows that better than you.

557
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,891
Best that ever come off the line.

558
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:45,500
And this here new one, if Miss
Daisy don't take to it...

559
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:48,338
...l'll let her ride in this one.

560
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,071
Mighty nice of you.

561
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,007
We do what we can.

562
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,306
It is three after seven.

563
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:03,307
Yes, Ma'am. You said we were
leaving at fifteen to eight.

564
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,572
At the latest, I said.

565
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:11,746
What business you got dragging this
mess out of the house by yourself?

566
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,651
Who was here to help me?

567
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:15,751
Lord have mercy!

568
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:19,157
It don't take more than 5
minutes to load this car.

569
00:48:19,431 --> 00:48:23,925
You're fixing to break your arms and
your legs before we even leave the manor.

570
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:25,761
You're taking on too much.

571
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:27,598
I hate doing things at the last minute.

572
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:31,500
What you talking about?
Been ready to go for a week and a half.

573
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,438
- Give me that package.
- No, don't touch that.

574
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:37,775
It sure is pretty.
Is that Mr. Walter's present?

575
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:40,951
Yes. It's fragile.
I'll put it on the seat.

576
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:44,448
You nearly missed us.

577
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,179
You were leaving at quarter of.

578
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:48,858
- She's taking on.
- Be still!

579
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:52,022
Florine bought this for Uncle Walter.

580
00:48:52,464 --> 00:48:54,295
Mama, it's not a snake!

581
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,124
I think it's notepaper.

582
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:59,530
How appropriate.
Uncle Walter can't see.

583
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,032
Maybe it's soap.

584
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:05,199
How nice that you take an interest
in your uncle's 90th birthday.

585
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:07,641
Don't start up with me, mama...

586
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,610
...I can't go
to Mobile with you.

587
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:11,146
I have to go to New York
for a convention.

588
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:13,213
The convention starts Monday.

589
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:15,476
And I know what else I know.

590
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,486
Leave Florine out of this.
She ordered those tickets 8 months ago.

591
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:22,990
I'm sure "My Fair Lady" is more
important than your relatives.

592
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:26,157
Those Christians will be impressed.

593
00:49:26,498 --> 00:49:28,728
I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

594
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:34,133
- We're expected in Mobile for supper.
- You'll be there.

595
00:49:35,507 --> 00:49:39,671
- How will you stand her all day?
- They'll fix crab. All that trouble.

596
00:49:40,879 --> 00:49:42,369
She's just worked up.

597
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,038
Here's $50 in case you have trouble.

598
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,111
Don't show it to Mama!

599
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:51,050
- Have you got a map?
- She's got it in the back seat.

600
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,121
It's 7:16!

601
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:57,894
You should have a job on the
radio announcing the time.

602
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:00,222
- I want to miss rush hour.
- You will.

603
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:03,959
Congratulate Uncle Walter for me
and kiss everybody in Mobile.

604
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:06,634
The air conditioning...

605
00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:09,066
...did you check it, like I said?

606
00:50:09,641 --> 00:50:11,632
I got the air conditioning checked.

607
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:15,139
I don't know why.
You never let me turn it on!

608
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,473
Hush up!

609
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:23,476
Good luck!

610
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:25,912
Good God!

611
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,841
Turn left.

612
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:50,344
No, right! Turn right!

613
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,324
Did I ever tell you about the
first time I left Georgia?

614
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:37,892
When was that?

615
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:40,062
A few minutes back!

616
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:41,662
Go on!

617
00:51:42,734 --> 00:51:43,894
My daughter...

618
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,659
...is married to a Pullman porter.

619
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:49,332
She is always on the go.

620
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:53,575
New York, Detroit, St. Lois.

621
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:58,080
I say, "That's all well
and good, Tommie Lee...

622
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,907
...but I don't feel the need for it."

623
00:52:01,753 --> 00:52:03,414
So here it is.

624
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,411
The first time.

625
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:08,415
And I might tell you, Miss Daisy...

626
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:12,191
...Alabama is not
looking like much so far!

627
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:47,791
Idella sure does stuff eggs good!

628
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:50,227
You stuff yourself good.

629
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:03,911
I was thinking about the
first time I went to Mobile.

630
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:08,143
It was Walter's wedding: 1888.

631
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:12,752
1888! You were nothing
but a little bitty thing.

632
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,651
I was 12.

633
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:17,250
We went on the train.

634
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:19,756
Oh, I was so excited.

635
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:23,329
I'd never been in a wedding party.

636
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:25,829
I had never seen the ocean.

637
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:32,674
Papa said it was the Gulf of Mexico, not
the ocean, but it was all the same to me.

638
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:40,348
I asked Papa if it was all right
for me to dip my hand in the water.

639
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:44,849
And he laughed because I was so timid.

640
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:51,688
And then I tasted the
salt water on my fingers.

641
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:59,200
Isn't that a silly thing to remember?

642
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:02,232
No sillier than most of
what folks remember.

643
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:04,968
Boy!

644
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,873
What are you doing with this car?

645
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,142
This is my car, officer.

646
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:17,313
Can I see your registration,
please, and your license, boy.

647
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,165
What's this name? Wertheran?

648
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:32,662
Werthan.

649
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,736
Never heard that one.
What is it?

650
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:37,998
It is of German derivation.

651
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,571
German derivation.

652
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,022
Thank you, ma'am.

653
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:38,465
An old nigger and an old Jew woman
riding down the road together.

654
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,064
Now that is one sorry sight.

655
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:53,143
Oh, my God!

656
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:55,975
The sign says Phenix City 30 miles.

657
00:55:56,254 --> 00:55:59,746
We're not supposed to go to
Phenix City! Oh, my God!

658
00:55:59,991 --> 00:56:01,322
Maybe you read it wrong.

659
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:05,493
I didn't. Stop the car. Stop the car!

660
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,661
Lord have mercy.

661
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:21,611
Here. You took the
wrong turn at Opelika.

662
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:25,509
You took it with me, Miss Daisy.
And you got the map.

663
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,842
I was getting the lunch!
Go on back. My God!

664
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,283
It aint' more than 30
minutes since we turned.

665
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:16,059
They fixed crab for me.

666
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:19,900
Minnie always fixes crab.
They go to so much trouble.

667
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:22,002
It's all ruined by now.

668
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:26,733
We going to have to pull over.

669
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,536
What's wrong with the car?

670
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,904
There ain't nothing wrong with the car.

671
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:33,173
I got to be excused.

672
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:37,086
I got to go make water.

673
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:40,752
You should have thought of
that at the service station.

674
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:45,689
You know colored can't use the toilet
at any service station, Miss Daisy.

675
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:49,764
There's no time to stop.
We'll be in Mobile soon. You can wait.

676
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:56,862
No, ma'am.

677
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:02,873
- I told you to wait!
- I heard what you said.

678
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:09,542
How do you think I feel having to
ask you can I go make water...

679
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,381
...like I am some child.

680
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:13,387
I'd be ashamed.

681
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:15,785
I ain't no child, Miss Daisy.

682
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:21,060
And I ain't just a back of the neck you
look at while you go where you got to go.

683
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:25,902
I am a man. I'm near 70 years old.
And I know when my bladder's full.

684
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,630
Now I'm going to get out of this car...

685
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:32,640
...and go over there
and do what I got to do.

686
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:37,404
And I'm taking the key with me, too.
Now that's all there is to it!

687
00:59:04,442 --> 00:59:05,602
Hoke!

688
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:15,951
Hoke!

689
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:22,781
Hoke?

690
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,870
You all right, Miss Daisy?

691
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:41,367
Of course I am.

692
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:49,776
Is that you, Slick? It's Boolie.
How you doing?

693
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,614
Congratulations on your dad's big day.

694
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:55,992
Thank you, Boolie. Thank you.
Aunt Daisy!

695
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,623
It's Boolie on the phone.

696
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:07,793
Hey, son!

697
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,865
Uncle Walter appreciates your call.

698
01:00:11,142 --> 01:00:13,542
I don't think he can come to the phone.

699
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:15,472
Fine. How's Hoke?

700
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,637
What do you mean?
How should he be?

701
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:20,547
Happy birthday, Uncle Walter.

702
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:22,649
I got to hang up now, Boolie.

703
01:00:23,154 --> 01:00:24,644
Yeah, I'll tell him.

704
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:29,724
For he's a jolly good fellow.

705
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:33,052
Which nobody can deny!

706
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:11,765
Morning, Miss McClatchey.

707
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:15,428
Well, good morning to you.

708
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:18,432
Can I see him?

709
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:21,267
It's Mr. Sinclair Harris, sir.

710
01:01:21,612 --> 01:01:23,204
My cousin Sinclair?

711
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:27,110
His wife... The one that talk funny.

712
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:29,442
She's from Canton, Ohio.

713
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:32,278
She's trying to hire me.

714
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:36,549
- What?!
- Yes, sir. She said:

715
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:38,955
"How they treating you
down there, Hoke?"

716
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:42,063
You know how she sound,
like her nose stuffed up.

717
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,632
So I said, "Fine, Mrs. Harris,
just fine, thank you."

718
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:49,896
She said, "Well, you looking for
a change, you know who to call."

719
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,968
I'll be damned!

720
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,641
I thought you ought to know about it.

721
01:01:55,246 --> 01:01:56,907
I'll be goddamned.

722
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:58,808
Ain't she a mess?

723
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,082
Said, "Name your own salary."

724
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:08,155
I see. And did you?

725
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:10,983
Did I what?

726
01:02:11,262 --> 01:02:15,096
- Name your own salary?
- Go away. What you think I am?

727
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:19,496
I ain't studying working for
no trashy something like her.

728
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:23,500
But she got you thinking, didn't she?

729
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:26,436
Well, sir, you might say that.

730
01:02:28,946 --> 01:02:30,607
Name your salary.

731
01:02:31,282 --> 01:02:33,113
That's exactly what she said.

732
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,611
Well, how does $65 a week sound?

733
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:41,955
Sounds pretty good, sir.

734
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:46,185
Course, $75 sounds better.

735
01:02:47,698 --> 01:02:49,290
It sure does!

736
01:02:52,536 --> 01:02:54,026
Beginning this week.

737
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:59,032
That's mighty nice of you.

738
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,471
I sure appreciate this. Thank you.

739
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:07,874
You ever have folks fighting over you?

740
01:03:09,153 --> 01:03:10,313
No.

741
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:13,551
It sure feels good.

742
01:03:21,732 --> 01:03:23,063
One dot.

743
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:29,736
Nine dot.

744
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:33,732
Two dot.

745
01:03:34,345 --> 01:03:35,403
Mah jongg.

746
01:03:35,746 --> 01:03:38,237
You are the luckiest thing, Beulah!

747
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:41,673
Excuse me.

748
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,690
I don't know how you can look at that.

749
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,532
See it a few times, you get in it.

750
01:04:03,374 --> 01:04:06,207
Both your brains are
fixing to evaporate.

751
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,435
You can bring the cake now, Hoke.

752
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:12,375
Don't make a mess with those peas.

753
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:14,277
Do I ever?

754
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:18,777
Lord have mercy, look at that.
Ain't she got a lot of hair?

755
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:20,886
How she get it so shiny?

756
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:22,888
Washes it in mayonnaise.

757
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:26,560
- Go on away from here, Idella!
- Yes, she did.

758
01:04:26,797 --> 01:04:28,788
I read it in Life magazine.

759
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:32,298
Don't seem human, does it?

760
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:35,633
He will tear you to shreds!

761
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:39,636
I am not going into that court.
And I'm not giving in!

762
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,401
You are at the end of your rope.

763
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:45,137
You murdered Carlson.
You have to pay!

764
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:50,251
Either choose the easy way out,
or you go into the courtroom...

765
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,320
...and let them carve you
into pathetic little bits.

766
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:56,490
You have a minute to make up your mind.

767
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,322
What happened? She up to
something, ain't she?

768
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:47,267
- You fixing to ruin it.
- What are you talking about?

769
01:06:47,538 --> 01:06:51,372
You got the chicken too close
together and the fire is too high.

770
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:53,100
Mind your business.

771
01:06:53,944 --> 01:06:56,276
It's your chicken.

772
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:19,566
Thank you, Hoke.

773
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,961
Now you enjoy it.

774
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:42,589
Amen.

775
01:09:18,422 --> 01:09:19,582
Who is it?

776
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:21,687
Morning, Miss Daisy.

777
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:26,188
What in the world...?

778
01:09:28,432 --> 01:09:32,926
I learned how to drive on ice when
I delivered milk for the dairy.

779
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:35,198
Ain't nothing to it.

780
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:40,036
Other folks are banging into each
other like they're in the funny papers.

781
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:46,212
I figured your stove was out, so
I stopped by the Krispy Kreme.

782
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:49,249
I know you got to have
coffee in the morning.

783
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,844
How sweet of you, Hoke.

784
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:58,520
We ain't had any good coffee
around here since Idella passed.

785
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:01,253
I can fix her biscuits.

786
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:04,089
We both can make her fried chicken.

787
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,263
But nobody can make Idella's coffee.

788
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,601
Ain't that the truth?

789
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:16,275
Idella was lucky.

790
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:24,116
I expect she was.

791
01:10:39,136 --> 01:10:40,626
Where are you going?

792
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,971
I'm just going to take these things off.

793
01:10:44,474 --> 01:10:47,966
I don't know what you can do here
today, except keep me company.

794
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:52,645
Then I'll see if I can make us a fire.

795
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,242
Eat anything you want
out of the ice box.

796
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,915
It will all spoil, anyway.

797
01:11:01,158 --> 01:11:04,992
And wipe up what you
tracked onto my floor.

798
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:07,924
What do you think I am, a mess?

799
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:12,991
Mama, I'll be right out...

800
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:15,604
...when I can get down my own driveway.

801
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:18,501
Stay home, Boolie.
Hoke is here with me.

802
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,265
How'd he manage that?

803
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:24,674
He's very handy. I'm fine.
I don't need a thing in the world.

804
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:29,009
Hello? I have the wrong number.
Mama's saying loving things about Hoke.

805
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:33,116
I didn't say I love him.
I said he was handy.

806
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:38,625
Honestly! Are you trying to irritate
me in the middle of an ice storm?

807
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:45,691
Thank you, Wellborn.

808
01:11:46,369 --> 01:11:47,700
Thank you all.

809
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:52,631
I am deeply grateful to be
chosen 1966 Man of the Year...

810
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:55,037
...by the Atlanta Business Council.

811
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:58,211
An honor I've seen bestowed
on mighty fine fellows.

812
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:01,144
And one I never expected
would come to me.

813
01:12:02,052 --> 01:12:05,044
I'm afraid that my loss up here...

814
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:07,549
...and my gain down here...

815
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:11,057
...have given me an air of
competence that I don't possess.

816
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:16,159
I will tell you that I wish my father
and grandfather could see this.

817
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,733
About 72 years ago, they leased
an old mill up on Decatur Road...

818
01:12:21,071 --> 01:12:23,733
...with I believe 25 looms in operation.

819
01:12:24,074 --> 01:12:26,235
They managed to grow with Atlanta.

820
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:31,174
And Werthan Industries believes that
what we want is what Atlanta wants.

821
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:35,574
And this award proves
that we were right.

822
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,183
I thank you.

823
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:08,944
Well?

824
01:13:10,287 --> 01:13:12,949
What is it? What took you so long?

825
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:17,624
I couldn't help it.
There's a big mess up yonder.

826
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:22,228
What's the matter? I might as
well not go to temple at all!

827
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:26,959
No, ma'am, you ain't going to get to
the temple this morning, Miss Daisy.

828
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:29,932
Why not? What's the matter with you?

829
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:34,239
Somebody has bombed the temple.

830
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:37,803
What? Bombed the temple?

831
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:41,314
That's how come
we stuck here so long.

832
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,246
I don't believe it!

833
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:45,817
That's what the policeman just said.

834
01:13:49,326 --> 01:13:53,319
Oh, my God. Was anybody there?
Were people hurt?

835
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:55,997
I don't know. He didn't say.

836
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:58,494
Who would do such a thing?

837
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:04,337
You know good as me, Miss Daisy.
It always be the same ones.

838
01:14:26,196 --> 01:14:29,188
I remember one time back
down there in Macon.

839
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:33,866
Lord, I couldn't've been more than
10 or 11 years old, I reckon.

840
01:14:34,371 --> 01:14:36,703
I had this friend named Porter.

841
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:40,970
One day there his daddy
was hanging from a tree.

842
01:14:41,211 --> 01:14:45,648
Now just the day before, we'd
all been pitching horseshoes.

843
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:50,476
Laughing and carrying on and
talking about how me and Porter...

844
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,053
...was going to have strong
right arms, just like him.

845
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:59,161
Lord, there he was.
Hanging up yonder in the tree.

846
01:14:59,396 --> 01:15:03,890
Had his hand tied behind him.
Flies was all over him.

847
01:15:04,401 --> 01:15:07,564
I tell you, I threw up
where I was standing.

848
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,331
You go on and cry.

849
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:14,734
I'm not crying.

850
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,004
Why did you tell me that story?

851
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:22,248
Lord, I don't know, Miss Daisy.

852
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:25,918
That mess back there
put me in mind of it.

853
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,249
Ridiculous! The temple
has nothing to do with it!

854
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:31,016
Yes, ma'am, if you say so.

855
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:35,220
We don't know. Maybe that
policeman wasn't telling the truth.

856
01:15:35,432 --> 01:15:38,765
Why would he go and lie
about a thing like that?

857
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:41,033
You never get things right!

858
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:44,867
Miss Daisy, somebody done bombed
that temple and you know it!

859
01:15:45,075 --> 01:15:47,475
I don't want to hear anymore about it!

860
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:52,771
- You the boss.
- Don't talk to me!

861
01:16:14,304 --> 01:16:16,966
- Where are you?
- Up here!

862
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:28,811
Hello, Mama. How are you feeling?

863
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:32,644
Not a good question to
ask somebody nearly 90!

864
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:34,817
Well, you look fine.

865
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,321
It's my ageless appeal!

866
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:41,088
Miss McClatchey gave me your message.

867
01:16:41,331 --> 01:16:43,322
Florine is invited, too.

868
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:44,655
Thank you.

869
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:48,267
I guess Hoke should drive us.
There'll be a crowd.

870
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,168
Mama, we have to talk about this.

871
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:52,931
About what?

872
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:55,337
About the feasibility of all this.

873
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:59,605
I believe Martin Luther King has
done some mighty fine things.

874
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:03,441
If you don't want to go,
why don't you just say so?

875
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,783
I want to go! You know
how I feel about him.

876
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,617
Of course, but Florine...

877
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:12,851
Florine has nothing to do with it.
I still have to do business here.

878
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:17,964
I see. Werthan Bag will go out of
business if you attend the King dinner.

879
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:23,138
Not exactly. But a lot of men I do
business with would not like it!

880
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,871
They might...

881
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:27,536
...snicker a little.

882
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:31,808
Call me Martin Luther
Werthan behind my back.

883
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:38,484
Maybe I wouldn't hear
about meetings at the Club.

884
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:43,719
Old Jack Raphael at Ideal Mills, he's a
New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew.

885
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,323
All the really smart ones come
from New York, don't they?

886
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:52,664
Some might throw their business to Jack
instead of old Martin Luther Werthan.

887
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:57,404
I don't know.
Maybe it wouldn't happen.

888
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,669
And sometimes that's
the way things work.

889
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:05,674
Anyway, if we don't use those
seats, somebody else will.

890
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:09,848
If we do not use those seats?
I'm not supposed to go, either?

891
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,847
You can do whatever you want.

892
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:14,079
Thanks for your permission.

893
01:18:14,924 --> 01:18:16,516
Can I ask you something?

894
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:21,695
When did you get so fired up about
Martin Luther King?

895
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,191
Why, Boolie!

896
01:18:23,433 --> 01:18:26,925
I've never been prejudiced
in my life and you know it.

897
01:18:28,438 --> 01:18:30,599
Then ask Hoke to go with you.

898
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:33,602
Don't be ridiculous. He wouldn't go.

899
01:18:35,278 --> 01:18:36,870
Ask him and see.

900
01:18:52,629 --> 01:18:53,960
All right!

901
01:19:36,072 --> 01:19:39,064
Boolie said the silliest
thing the other day.

902
01:19:42,145 --> 01:19:43,510
What did he say?

903
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:46,641
He was talking about Martin Luther Ling.

904
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,309
I guess you know him, don't you?

905
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:51,817
King? No, ma'am.
I don't know him.

906
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:54,020
I was sure you did.

907
01:19:54,324 --> 01:19:56,019
But you've heard him preach?

908
01:19:56,259 --> 01:20:00,753
Yes, Ma'am, same way you have.
On the TV.

909
01:20:01,331 --> 01:20:03,322
I think he's wonderful.

910
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:11,538
- What you getting at?
- It's so silly.

911
01:20:11,774 --> 01:20:16,336
Boolie says you wanted to go with me
to this dinner. Did you tell him that?

912
01:20:17,113 --> 01:20:18,102
No, I didn't.

913
01:20:18,281 --> 01:20:23,048
I didn't think so. What'd be the point?
You can hear him whenever you want.

914
01:20:24,554 --> 01:20:27,853
I think it's wonderful the
way things are changing.

915
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:51,140
Now what you think
I am, Miss Daisy?

916
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:52,440
What do you mean?

917
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:54,479
The invitation to this dinner...

918
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:56,313
...came in the mail a month ago.

919
01:20:56,652 --> 01:21:00,486
Now, if did be you wanted
me to go with you...

920
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:04,816
...how come you wait 'till we in the
car on the way before you asked me?

921
01:21:04,994 --> 01:21:08,987
What? All I said was Boolie
said you wanted to go.

922
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:13,725
Next time you want me to go
somewhere ask me regular.

923
01:21:14,003 --> 01:21:15,994
You don't have to carry on so much.

924
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,503
Let's just leave it alone.

925
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:20,001
Honestly!

926
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:28,240
Talk about things changing.
They ain't changed all that much.

927
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:36,922
I'll help you.

928
01:21:37,193 --> 01:21:40,185
Thank you, Hoke, I can help myself.

929
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:52,772
...can see that the South
has marvelous possibilities.

930
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:56,377
Yet in spite of these assets...

931
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:59,203
...segregation has placed the South...

932
01:21:59,449 --> 01:22:04,284
...socially, educationally, and
economically behind the rest of the nation.

933
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:09,653
Yet there are in the white South
millions of people of good will...

934
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,957
...whose voices are yet unheard...

935
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:16,291
...whose course is yet unclear...

936
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:19,958
...and whose courageous
acts are yet unseen.

937
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,468
These millions are called upon...

938
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:27,236
...to gird their courage,
to speak out...

939
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:30,743
...to offer leadership that is needed.

940
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:32,974
History will have to record...

941
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:36,741
...that the greatest tragedy of
this period of social transition...

942
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:41,921
...was not the vitriolic words and the
violent actions of the bad people...

943
01:22:42,492 --> 01:22:46,986
...but the appalling silence and
indifference of the good people.

944
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:49,696
And our generation
will have to repent...

945
01:22:49,932 --> 01:22:53,424
...not only for the words and acts
of the children of darkness...

946
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:58,604
...but also for the fears and
apathy of the children of light.

947
01:23:26,736 --> 01:23:28,533
Morning, Miss Daisy.

948
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:00,024
Miss Daisy?

949
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:07,335
Hoke, is that Hoke?

950
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:09,904
It's me. You all right?

951
01:24:10,913 --> 01:24:14,007
Hoke, what did I do with my papers?

952
01:24:14,584 --> 01:24:18,076
My papers! I had them all
corrected last night...

953
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:21,854
...and I put them where I wouldn't
forget them on my way to school.

954
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:23,285
What did you do with them?

955
01:24:23,426 --> 01:24:25,087
What are you talking about?

956
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:29,195
The children will be disappointed if
I don't give them their homework.

957
01:24:29,432 --> 01:24:32,424
I always give it back the next day.

958
01:24:32,802 --> 01:24:34,429
That's why they like me.

959
01:24:34,604 --> 01:24:36,094
You talking out your head.

960
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:38,102
Why aren't you helping me?

961
01:24:38,608 --> 01:24:40,200
What'll I do?

962
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:42,809
Find those papers. I told you.

963
01:24:44,213 --> 01:24:47,376
It's all right if you moved them.
I won't be mad.

964
01:24:47,617 --> 01:24:50,814
But I've got to get to school.
I'll be late.

965
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:55,819
Who will take care of my class?
They'll be all alone. Oh, God!

966
01:24:56,058 --> 01:24:57,719
I do everything wrong!

967
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,623
Now set down in here. You're
going to fall and hurt yourself.

968
01:25:02,732 --> 01:25:07,226
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.
I didn't do right.

969
01:25:08,638 --> 01:25:10,128
It's so awful!

970
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:13,569
Ain't nothing awful except
the way you carrying on.

971
01:25:13,743 --> 01:25:15,404
It's all my fault.

972
01:25:15,645 --> 01:25:18,341
I can't find the papers.
The children are waiting.

973
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:21,914
There ain't nobody waiting on you.
You ain't a teacher.

974
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:24,142
It doesn't make any difference.

975
01:25:24,487 --> 01:25:27,422
Now listen, there ain't
nothing wrong with you!

976
01:25:27,657 --> 01:25:28,851
You don't know.

977
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:46,972
This Hoke here.

978
01:25:47,977 --> 01:25:48,807
What can I do for you?

979
01:25:48,878 --> 01:25:50,175
It's your mama.

980
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:51,437
What's wrong?

981
01:25:51,681 --> 01:25:53,512
She's taking on something awful.

982
01:25:54,116 --> 01:25:56,380
Why's today different
from any other day?

983
01:25:57,019 --> 01:25:58,884
No, sir. It's not the same.

984
01:26:00,589 --> 01:26:02,079
I'll be right there.

985
01:26:06,028 --> 01:26:10,021
Miss Daisy, now there ain't
nothing wrong with you!

986
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:12,890
Your mind done took a turn this morning.

987
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:15,535
You'll snap back if you let yourself.

988
01:26:15,805 --> 01:26:17,966
I can't! I can't!

989
01:26:18,808 --> 01:26:20,708
You're a lucky old woman.

990
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:25,404
No! It's all a mess now, and
I can't do anything about it.

991
01:26:25,715 --> 01:26:29,708
Now look at you. You rich,
you well for your time.

992
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:32,985
You got folks who care
what happens to you.

993
01:26:33,222 --> 01:26:36,714
I am being trouble. I don't
want to be trouble to anybody.

994
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:40,325
You want something to cry about,
I'll run you to the state home...

995
01:26:40,563 --> 01:26:42,929
...let you see what's laying out there.

996
01:26:43,232 --> 01:26:46,998
I bet there ain't one of them
carrying on the way you doing.

997
01:26:47,236 --> 01:26:50,433
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Those poor children.

998
01:26:51,006 --> 01:26:55,568
You keep this up and Mr. Werthan's
going to call that doctor on you.

999
01:26:55,678 --> 01:27:00,581
Just as sure as you born, that doctor is
going to have you out in that asylum.

1000
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:04,075
Now is that the way you want it to be?

1001
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:13,859
Do you still have that Hudson?

1002
01:27:15,865 --> 01:27:18,766
You talking about from
when I first come here?

1003
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:21,600
No, Miss Daisy.

1004
01:27:21,871 --> 01:27:26,535
That thing been in the junkyard now...
more than 15 years.

1005
01:27:27,209 --> 01:27:31,043
I'm driving your next to last car now.

1006
01:27:31,547 --> 01:27:33,879
1965 Cadillac.

1007
01:27:34,216 --> 01:27:36,707
It's running fine as wine, too.

1008
01:27:38,888 --> 01:27:42,881
You ought not to be driving
anything the way you see.

1009
01:27:43,192 --> 01:27:48,027
Now, how you know how I can see
'less'n you can look out my eyes.

1010
01:27:57,139 --> 01:27:58,800
You're my best friend.

1011
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:01,499
- Go on now, Miss Daisy.
- No, really.

1012
01:28:02,244 --> 01:28:03,575
You are.

1013
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:10,082
You are.

1014
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:02,790
Well, Hoke, good to see you!

1015
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:08,134
- You didn't drive yourself here?
- No, sir. I don't drive now.

1016
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:10,304
My granddaughter drove me.

1017
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:13,030
My Lord, is she old enough to drive?

1018
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:16,310
Michelle is nigh on 37 years old now.

1019
01:30:16,812 --> 01:30:20,976
She's teaching biology at
yonder Spelman College.

1020
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,547
I never knew that.

1021
01:30:28,324 --> 01:30:32,658
Seems mighty funny to sell the
house while Mama's still alive.

1022
01:30:33,162 --> 01:30:35,653
Yes, sir, I imagine it do.

1023
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:39,990
But she hasn't been inside
the door for two years.

1024
01:30:40,402 --> 01:30:41,767
I know.

1025
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:45,162
I suppose you don't see her very much.

1026
01:30:45,407 --> 01:30:47,398
No, sir, I don't.

1027
01:30:48,077 --> 01:30:51,410
It's hard, not driving, Mr. Werthan.

1028
01:30:51,847 --> 01:30:54,577
There's no bus that goes out yonder.

1029
01:30:54,917 --> 01:30:59,286
Course, I take a taxicab
as often as I can.

1030
01:30:59,855 --> 01:31:01,516
I' m sure she appreciates it.

1031
01:31:04,026 --> 01:31:07,359
Some days she's better than others.

1032
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:11,359
But then, who ain't?

1033
01:31:56,912 --> 01:31:58,573
Happy Thanksgiving, Mama!

1034
01:31:59,915 --> 01:32:01,576
Look who I brought!

1035
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:04,482
Morning, Miss Daisy.

1036
01:32:06,422 --> 01:32:08,913
You been keeping yourself busy?

1037
01:32:10,592 --> 01:32:13,925
She certainly has.
She goes to jewelry making...

1038
01:32:14,163 --> 01:32:15,858
How many times a week?

1039
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:19,361
She makes all kinds of things.
Pins, bracelets...

1040
01:32:20,269 --> 01:32:21,759
She's a regular Tiffany's.

1041
01:32:22,004 --> 01:32:23,869
Isn't that something!

1042
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:30,772
Are you all right, Mama?

1043
01:32:35,784 --> 01:32:38,617
Hoke, I thought of you the other day.

1044
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:42,518
- I saw an Avondale milk truck.
- Is that right?

1045
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:46,192
A big monster of a thing.
Must've had 16 wheels.

1046
01:32:46,462 --> 01:32:47,952
Go on away from here.

1047
01:32:48,197 --> 01:32:51,394
I wondered how you'd have
liked driving that around.

1048
01:32:52,634 --> 01:32:55,467
Hoke came to see me, not you.

1049
01:32:58,006 --> 01:33:00,167
This is one of her good days.

1050
01:33:01,543 --> 01:33:06,480
Mama, Florine said to wish you a happy
Thanksgiving. She's in Washington.

1051
01:33:07,816 --> 01:33:10,808
She's a Republican National
Committeewoman now.

1052
01:33:11,153 --> 01:33:12,552
Good God!

1053
01:33:19,495 --> 01:33:21,827
Go charm the nurses!

1054
01:33:25,167 --> 01:33:27,328
She wants you all to herself.

1055
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:30,429
You are a doodle, Mama.

1056
01:33:50,526 --> 01:33:52,517
Boolie paying you still?

1057
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:55,193
Every week.

1058
01:33:55,364 --> 01:33:56,695
How much?

1059
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:59,763
Now that's between him and me.

1060
01:34:00,369 --> 01:34:02,360
Highway robbery!

1061
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:06,868
It sure is.

1062
01:34:10,112 --> 01:34:11,773
It sure is.

1063
01:34:15,884 --> 01:34:17,374
How are you?

1064
01:34:20,389 --> 01:34:22,550
I'm doing the best I can.

1065
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:26,290
Me, too.

1066
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:32,797
Well, that's about all
there is to it then.

1067
01:34:42,244 --> 01:34:43,575
Look it here.

1068
01:34:44,413 --> 01:34:47,405
You didn't eat your Thanksgiving pie.

1069
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:52,150
Go on now.

1070
01:34:55,424 --> 01:34:57,585
Here, let me help you.

1071
01:35:13,775 --> 01:35:14,935
Is it good?

1072
01:35:20,616 --> 01:35:22,277
Here comes some more.
