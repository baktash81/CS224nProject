1
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:30,280
Be very very quiet.
I’m hunting rabbits.

2
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,313
I am a duck bent on
self- preservationum.

3
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:46,353
Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.

4
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:49,360
- Duck season.
- Rabbit season!

5
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:54,903
Duck season! Fire!

6
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:09,010
Hold everything.

7
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:12,555
''Daffy gets blasted.''
Page 7: ''Daffy gets blasted.''

8
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:15,821
Page 8: ''Daffy gets blasted again! ''

9
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:20,059
What's the matter with you people?
We can't do this kind of stuff anymore.

10
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,531
Brothers Warner...

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,229
show biz legends like me
shouldn't have to play stooge...

12
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:28,204
to that long- eared,
carrot- chomping, overbite- challenged- -

13
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:30,238
What's up, doc?

14
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:34,239
Bobby, how's the wife?

15
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:37,110
Great nose job, Chuck. Thanks, girls.

16
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:39,844
Good rug, Mel. Never would have guessed.

17
00:01:40,452 --> 00:01:42,716
- Pardon me.
- The pleasure is mine.

18
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:46,383
Fellas, I think Daff's right.
Maybe I'll take a vacation.

19
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,926
Go visit my 542 nieces and nephews.

20
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:50,928
Mr. Duck, excuse me, I’m sorry.

21
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,057
I don't see how we can have a
Bugs Bunny movie without Bugs Bunny.

22
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:56,727
Oh, my heavens, no.

23
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:59,363
You couldn't have a movie
without Bugs Bunny.

24
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,637
If you don't mind me asking, whose
glorified personal assistant are you?

25
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:06,610
Kate Houghton, Vice President, Comedy.

26
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:08,307
Right.

27
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,242
<i>Kate did Lethal Weapon Babies.</i>

28
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:13,980
<i>Finally, a Lethal Weapon
that I can take my grandchildren to.</i>

29
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:15,978
Gentlemen, check your phones.

30
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:19,616
Our latest research shows
that Bugs Bunny is a core asset...

31
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:23,992
that appeals to male and female,
young and old throughout the universe...

32
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:27,260
while your fan base
is limited to angry fat guys in basements.

33
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:32,271
Yeah, but.... Come on, fellas,
I’m thrice the entertainer the rabbit is!

34
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:37,299
Fine, it's hilarious...

35
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:40,607
but moviegoers these days
demand action heroes, like me!

36
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,748
Top that, rabbit.

37
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:57,257
So, it has come to this, has it?

38
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,765
I’m afraid
the Brothers Warner must choose...

39
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:01,631
between a handsome matinee idol...

40
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:05,364
or this miscreant perpetrator
of low burlesque.

41
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,172
Whichever one's not the duck.

42
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:13,174
That's the stuff from my office.

43
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:15,681
- You don't have an office.
- Not anymore.

44
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:17,546
Symbolically, this is bad.

45
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,286
Please, brother. Other brother?

46
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:23,221
Icy she- wolf? Help me, please.

47
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,189
I’m too moist and tender to retire.

48
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:28,553
- Let me escort you out.
- Wait!

49
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:31,360
I haven't tried toadying, kowtowing,
or butt- kissing yet.

50
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,457
I’m still begging here!

51
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:37,500
Freeze!

52
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:53,712
Can I try that again?

53
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:56,552
No, thank you. We'll call you.

54
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:04,689
Hey, D.J. How did your tryout go?

55
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:08,600
Well, let's see.
I can say I made an impression.

56
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:11,904
Your father can get you a job
anytime he wants to.

57
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:15,238
I know, but I don't want that.
I'd really rather earn it, sir.

58
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:19,178
- Mr. Warner mentioned you this morning.
- He did? What did he say?

59
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:21,842
He said don't forget the TurtleWax.

60
00:04:23,585 --> 00:04:25,850
What about animation?
I could do cartoons.

61
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:27,116
Dead duck walking.

62
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,883
- Morning, Mr. Bunny.
- Very hot now.

63
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:30,220
And I do voices. Listen.

64
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,726
- Excuse me.
- ''Fetch the stick, boy.''

65
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,922
''What a maroon.''
''You can't handle the truth.''

66
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,889
Some grip, lady.

67
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,192
I need you to eject this duck.

68
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:42,932
- Lady, this is Daffy Duck.
- Exactly.

69
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,802
- Not anymore. We own the name.
- Yeah?

70
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:47,535
You can't stop me from calling myself....

71
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:50,372
- What do you know?
- You fired Daffy Duck?

72
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:52,812
No, I didn't. I did. They did.

73
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:55,382
You just were following orders.

74
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:58,954
You know what? You don't know me.

75
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:03,290
You're Kate Houghton,
you're the VP of Comedy. Go figure.

76
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:07,626
You drive a red 1988 Alfa Romeo.
Good engine. Little under- driven.

77
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:11,289
I know this
because you nearly ran me over last week.

78
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:15,394
Anyway, about that duck,
you want me to get rid of him still?

79
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:20,432
- Duck, yes. Eject the duck, please.
- I can't do that.

80
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,274
- Why not?
- He's gone.

81
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,253
What are you waiting for, backup?

82
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:39,826
Shabby job so far, constable.

83
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:42,023
Quick! After me!

84
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,431
Now you're gonna pay for that one.
Come here!

85
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:47,630
- Dress Inspector!
- Look out!

86
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:49,673
One side, Spartacuses.

87
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,969
- Come on.
- Daffy, stop!

88
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:57,437
Cut him off at the pass, boys.

89
00:05:57,881 --> 00:06:00,783
All units in pursuit of little black duck.

90
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,122
Well, that's just cheating.

91
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,664
Don't follow me.

92
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:31,342
That's not right. Cut!

93
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,916
<i>That's lunch, everybody!</i>

94
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,717
- That airbag cost a lot of money.
- I’m okay.

95
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,554
Good morning. Batman, you good?

96
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:47,927
All right.

97
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,430
My chariot awaits.

98
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:51,930
Yes!

99
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,333
Bat- lights. Bat- conditioning.
Bat- stereo.

100
00:06:56,242 --> 00:06:57,607
To the Duck Cave.

101
00:06:58,277 --> 00:06:59,767
Now what are you doing?

102
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:02,345
Stay away from that Batmobile!

103
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,044
- I’m allowed to steal. I’m a celebrity.
- Tell it to the judge!

104
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:09,856
- Feeling pretty good about yourself?
- I am.

105
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,360
- You bested that dastardly duck?
- I did.

106
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:19,290
You're gonna offer your catch
to the pretty executive?

107
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,422
Indeed.

108
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:24,135
Miss Houghton!

109
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:33,908
Get out of the way!

110
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:40,877
Look out!

111
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,596
What do you know? I found Nemo.

112
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:02,272
I think she likes you.

113
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:14,250
Your father would be so ashamed of you.

114
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:33,831
But I was.... lt was....

115
00:08:38,512 --> 00:08:42,813
At first, they told me to lose the stutter.
Now they tell me I’m not funny.

116
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:45,818
It's a pain in the butt
being politically correct.

117
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:47,615
You're telling me.

118
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,214
What kind of performance
do you call that?

119
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:53,351
You made me sound
like a total space cadet, man.

120
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:57,488
I’m sorry you feel that way.
I was trying to be real to your character.

121
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:01,468
If you, like, goof on me in the sequel,
I’m coming after you.

122
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:04,027
And I'll give you a Scooby Snack!

123
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:07,708
There are some areas of the script
I think we need to address.

124
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:11,039
There's no heart, no cooperation,
nobody learns anything.

125
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,740
Daffy learns not to stick his head
in a jet engine.

126
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:16,647
- He's gone.
- No, Daffy always comes back.

127
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:18,583
I just tell him how much I need him.

128
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:21,656
We hug, we cry,
I drop something heavy on him, I laugh.

129
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:24,590
The duck is history, okay?
So the question is...

130
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:28,754
how can I help you
reposition your brand identity?

131
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:33,433
Answer: We team you up
with a hot female co- star.

132
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:34,900
Usually...

133
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:37,535
I play the female love interest.

134
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:44,368
About the cross- dressing thing?
ln the past, funny. Today, disturbing.

135
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,845
Lady, if you don't find a rabbit
with lipstick amusing...

136
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,941
you and I have
nothing to say to each other.

137
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:52,681
Look, I’m trying to be nice...

138
00:09:52,788 --> 00:09:55,417
but I was brought in
to leverage your synergy...

139
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:58,357
and I am not going to let you
or some wacky duck- -

140
00:09:58,428 --> 00:09:59,520
Daffy.

141
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:03,224
Wacky, daffy, nutty, fruitcake,
crispy over rice, it doesn't matter.

142
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,061
Well, these matter.

143
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:06,967
And this.

144
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,031
And they say we get Daffy back.
Right, boys?

145
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:13,200
- We want Daffy!
- Bring him back!

146
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:14,573
We love Daffy!

147
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,040
Little Damian.

148
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,152
Hey, Granny.

149
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:26,047
Hi, Tweety.

150
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:27,613
How was work today?

151
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,255
Eventful.

152
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:32,620
What a nice young man.

153
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,312
Guess who? So did you miss me?

154
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:58,346
I’m glad I was fired.

155
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:01,322
ln a few days,
they'll be kissing my befeathered rump...

156
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:03,290
begging me to come back. But I won't.

157
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,522
Did I miss the part where I invited you in?

158
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:08,427
I'll be too busy accepting numerous,
multiple offers.

159
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,263
Every studio in town....

160
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:16,371
Who am I kidding? My career is over.

161
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:19,369
Perhaps I was being too polite. Get out!

162
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:22,207
I'll starve. I'll have
to eat envelope glue.

163
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:23,712
Wait, a sushi bar.

164
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:26,813
No!

165
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,814
- Daffy.
- Yes.

166
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,957
Leave my father's house. Now.

167
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,866
You live with Daddy?

168
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:47,563
Yeah, so?
Just, you know, kind of temporarily.

169
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,663
I've hit rock bottom.

170
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:53,336
I’m hanging out with a security guard
who lives with his father.

171
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:59,650
My grease and gravy!
Your dad is Damian Drake.

172
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:04,147
- The super spy.
- He's an actor who plays a spy.

173
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:08,558
- And that? That was his I Spy Award.
- Ingenious.

174
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:13,788
An actor playing a super spy as a cover
for being a super spy playing an actor.

175
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:16,699
ln fact, I'll bet this whole dump
is a super spy lair.

176
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,498
Nothing is as it seems.

177
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:23,332
You're probably protected by
an invisible force field right this minute.

178
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,374
The force field- penetrating apple.

179
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,745
Just feel free to continue
your delusional ranting...

180
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,914
while I answer my....

181
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,216
Remote?

182
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,584
Hello?

183
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,303
<i>- Son?
- Dad?</i>

184
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,308
What are you doing in the painting?

185
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:00,572
<i>I wanted to keep you out of this,
but there's no one else I can trust.</i>

186
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,610
<i>Can you hold on a second?</i>

187
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,278
Are you shooting a movie or something?

188
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,580
A new Damian Drake movie? Cool.

189
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,448
<i>Come to Las Vegas.</i>

190
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,923
<i>Ask Dusty Tails for the Blue Monkey.</i>

191
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,219
The Blue Monkey? What's a Blue Monkey?

192
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,822
<i>A diamond. A very special diamond.</i>

193
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,992
<i>Find Dusty Tails.</i>

194
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:27,164
Dad, you need me
to call the police or something?

195
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:31,845
<i>- No police.
- Dad, are you all right?</i>

196
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:35,177
<i>I’m sorry I never told you this before,
but I....</i>

197
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,750
- Dad?
- Diamond? I’m rich!

198
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:48,456
- I've joined the leisure class.
- I gotta go save my dad.

199
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:52,488
Your dad, yeah.
So count me in. A spy caper.

200
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,627
Double agents, exploding bikinis,
tigers hanging from helicopters!

201
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,771
I'm through with show biz!

202
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,001
From now on,
I’m gonna live the adventure.

203
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:04,135
- Next stop, Las Vegas.
- I'll take my dad's old car.

204
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:08,004
- A super spy car. Let's ride.
- This isn't a spy car.

205
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,949
<i>Your dad is a spy. Ipso ergo, a spy car.</i>

206
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:14,385
I used to deliver pizzas in this car.

207
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:17,316
Secret pizzas?

208
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,288
A spy pie, maybe?

209
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:23,630
Fine, be that way.
But it's definitely a spy car!

210
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,188
A little help here?

211
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:28,028
Ducks.

212
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:38,837
You know how I know it's a spy car?

213
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:42,247
Because it looks
absolutely nothing like a spy car.

214
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:02,569
<i>I don't think this routine
is gonna work without Daffy, but....</i>

215
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:03,695
<i>Action.</i>

216
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:06,741
<i>Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.</i>

217
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:09,072
<i>- Duck season.
- Rabbit season.</i>

218
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:14,077
<i>- Rabbit season.
- Wait a minute.</i>

219
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,515
<i>See, I told you
this wasn't gonna work without- - </i>

220
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:22,119
Pain. Agony!

221
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:25,224
You're fired.

222
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:27,255
What?

223
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:30,630
- But you- -
- You got rid of our best duck.

224
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:35,299
You can't fire me.

225
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:38,533
My films have made $950 million!

226
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,637
- That's not a billion.
- Nope. Not a billion.

227
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:43,269
Okay.

228
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:46,913
All right.

229
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,118
I think we can all agree that the decision
to get rid of Daffy was a poor one.

230
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:52,654
But it's time to move on.

231
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:56,624
And by move on, I mean reversing course
and getting Daffy back.

232
00:15:56,994 --> 00:15:58,325
By Monday.

233
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,321
I will have Daffy back on Monday.

234
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:05,824
That went well.

235
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:10,504
Listen, doll face, if I know Daffy,
he's already hit the road by now.

236
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:18,979
It's good to stretch.

237
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:21,381
I’m getting tired
of throwing you out of the car.

238
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:23,511
That's my plan in a nutshell.

239
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:27,547
Now, listen, if we run into anything
that requires super spy skills...

240
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:31,116
like cracking wise, smooching dames,
you better leave that to me.

241
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:34,461
However, if we have
any security guarding needs....

242
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:37,566
Very funny, duck. I’m not a security guard.

243
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:41,070
For your information, it's just a job.
It's what I do for money.

244
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,163
What I really do is....

245
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:45,506
I’m a stuntman.

246
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:48,045
- You? A stuntman? Please.
- I am !

247
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:52,474
Did you see those Mummy movies?
I’m in them more than Brendan Fraser is.

248
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:55,146
No, he couldn't stand that.

249
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,180
One day he decides that, ''No! The Bren-
master does all his own stunts! ''

250
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:03,523
Listen, muscles, if this heap ever makes it
to Vegas, I'll do all the stunts.

251
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:04,721
Duck here.

252
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,322
- Daffy, old chum, how the heck- -
- Cram it down your rabbit hole.

253
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,426
I think I can get you your old job back
with less of a pay cut than usual.

254
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:14,027
So not interested.

255
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:17,233
I’m off to Las Vegas
with my new sidekick D.J...

256
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:19,742
to match wits with spies and showgirls.

257
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:21,745
It's a little adventure I call:

258
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:24,610
''Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey.''

259
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:26,685
And you're not in it.

260
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,176
Blue Monkey?

261
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:44,631
<i>Blue Monkey?</i>

262
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,769
<i>It's a little adventure I call.</i>

263
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:51,866
<i>'Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey. '</i>

264
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:07,287
This is unacceptable!

265
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,924
We cannot have 9- year- olds working
in sweatshops making Acme sneakers...

266
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:18,094
not when 3- year- olds
work for so much less.

267
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:22,301
But, sir, they require naps.

268
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:26,145
Put double espresso in their sippy cups.

269
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,674
What's next on the agenda?

270
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:34,151
Where's my people? What's coming up?
What's the next thing?

271
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:39,450
Thank you, Bob.

272
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,789
Grave news, my friends.

273
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,862
Direct your attention to the video screen.

274
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:51,628
Cable, input, VCR, satellite.

275
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:58,372
Input, satellite, tape, menu, rewind...

276
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:00,036
power, on.

277
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,109
lt seems that Damian Drake's son
knows about the Blue Monkey...

278
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,722
and he is on his way to Las Vegas.

279
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,959
He must not find the location
of the diamond before we do.

280
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:17,022
How is the interrogation going?

281
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,663
<i>He's about ready to crack, boss!</i>

282
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:34,475
Cable, input, VCR and satellite, off.

283
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,582
We cannot let the good guys
win this time, people.

284
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:39,711
We must capture this son of a spy...

285
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,345
and we must locate the diamond...

286
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:44,256
and use its powers
for our own diabolical ends!

287
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,891
- Copy that to all departments.
- I didn't quite get that.

288
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,364
Didn't quite....

289
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,995
Something about
capturing the son of a spy...

290
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,664
and using the diamond's power
for our diabolical ends.

291
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,572
Be sure and use the laugh.
I like the laugh. Don't you?

292
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,610
- And what is your name?
- Mary.

293
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,201
Well, Mary...

294
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,576
how'd you like to do a
little kissing later?

295
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:12,710
That's what they all say at first.

296
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:17,757
Soon the ACME Corporation
will tower over all of creation!

297
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,293
All of creation!

298
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:31,471
Wait a minute.

299
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,872
- Yes?
- What about the duck?

300
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:44,546
Extra crispy.

301
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:56,996
Hello?

302
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:16,612
D.J., I’m not here to fire you again.

303
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:20,646
I just want to know
if that duck told you where he was going.

304
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:14,907
- Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
- Why are you torturing me?

305
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:17,745
What have I ever done that....

306
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:22,547
Great.

307
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:26,055
I just fired the son of our biggest star.

308
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:32,095
This has been a career- making day, Kate.

309
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,688
First you get rid of the duck
that everybody hates...

310
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:37,564
but then, of course,
they all want him back.

311
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:42,373
And worst of all,
you get into a big fight with Bugs Bunny...

312
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:46,900
who you revere and who you've tried
to model your life after.

313
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:51,074
I hate to see a grown man cry.

314
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:53,678
Especially when it's a girl.

315
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,414
Listen, toots,
would it stop the waterworks...

316
00:22:56,522 --> 00:23:00,424
if I told you Daffy was going to Las Vegas
with that guy D.J.?

317
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:04,127
lt might.

318
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:08,459
Well, then,
how's about we travel in style in this?

319
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:14,565
Las Vegas, Jeeves.

320
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,372
<i>Taking you to Las Vegas.</i>

321
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:04,289
You've got no music in your soul, sister.

322
00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:06,291
I am aware of that, yes.

323
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:10,595
He sure went for all the extras.
What a maroon.

324
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:13,327
Don't touch anything.
This is Damian Drake's car- -

325
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,162
- Let's see.
- No!

326
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,475
What does this one do?

327
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:28,706
<i>Shaken, not stirred, sir.</i>

328
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:31,784
It's 5:00 somewhere.

329
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:36,186
- If you touch one more thing- -
- I’m about to defy you.

330
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:40,854
<i>- Now you done it.
- Arms at your side, please.</i>

331
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,570
<i>Formalwear activated.</i>

332
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,031
You clean up nice, kid.

333
00:24:55,843 --> 00:24:56,902
No!

334
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,021
Las Vegas!

335
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,671
Smell that, D.J.?

336
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:32,213
That's the sweet aroma
of money, glamour...

337
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,114
and busload upon busload
of senior citizens.

338
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,014
Cool it, duck. This could be dangerous.

339
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:40,680
Right, we find Dusty Tails,
save your dad, get the diamond...

340
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,248
apply kung fu liberally as needed.

341
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,220
<i>Under no circumstances are you to allow...</i>

342
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,757
<i>the young Mr. Drake and his duck cohort
out of the casino in one piece.</i>

343
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:54,700
<i>- ls that clear?
- Okay.</i>

344
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:57,534
You want the varmints
and what they come for.

345
00:25:57,606 --> 00:26:01,474
I got you. But what's in it for old Sam?

346
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,116
I got you.

347
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:20,793
Did you know that Dusty Tails sang the
theme song to six Damian Drake movies?

348
00:26:20,897 --> 00:26:22,126
I know. He's my father.

349
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:24,097
- Your dad is Damian Drake?
- Yes!

350
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,261
I’m kidding, relax. We did that.

351
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,267
<i>I say, listen up, y'all.</i>

352
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,672
<i>Please put your greasy,
buffet- shoveling hands together...</i>

353
00:26:32,776 --> 00:26:34,243
<i>for our next act.</i>

354
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:37,474
<i>If you've heard her before,
you're not here now.</i>

355
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,480
<i>So, I say, let me introduce you...</i>

356
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,677
<i>to Miss Dusty Tails.</i>

357
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:19,350
Dusty!

358
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:22,159
Can I talk to you?

359
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:32,729
What the....

360
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:43,041
What?

361
00:27:43,815 --> 00:27:45,976
Dusty, I gotta talk to you.

362
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:49,381
- I’m Damian Drake's son, D.J.
- What?

363
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,014
How do I know it's you?

364
00:27:55,193 --> 00:27:56,751
You are Damian's son.

365
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:58,853
ls there someplace we can talk?

366
00:28:00,332 --> 00:28:04,393
- Excuse me, I have to change.
- Okay, toots, hand over the diamond.

367
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:07,028
- He brought a goose?
- It's duck, thank you.

368
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,831
- Hi.
- You again.

369
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:12,066
Listen up, you darn imbeciles!

370
00:28:12,178 --> 00:28:14,544
We gotta get them varmints
and what they come for!

371
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:17,912
- And then we blast them?
- Then we blast them.

372
00:28:18,184 --> 00:28:21,085
Now if I were a giant diamond,
where would I be?

373
00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:22,779
Well, not there.

374
00:28:23,756 --> 00:28:25,724
- My dad's in trouble...
- Not here.

375
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:29,488
...and he said that
I should ask you about the Blue Monkey.

376
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:32,623
- So then you know?
- Definitely. Yes.

377
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:35,723
I figured something must have happened
when he didn't show up.

378
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:38,235
I’m sorry,
but that's what comes with being a spy.

379
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:42,604
So, you're a spy, too?

380
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:46,412
The pop diva thing?
That's just one side of me.

381
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,539
I also work for the Agency.
Professional assassin.

382
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:52,084
It's really hard
trying to juggle the two sometimes.

383
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:54,278
I don't know what I'll do when I have kids.

384
00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:58,983
Do you know how hard it is to find a nanny
with advance weapons training?

385
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,117
How many galoshes died
to make that little number?

386
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:04,423
What about this Blue Monkey?

387
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:07,990
Your father was assigned to track it down
before the chairman could.

388
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:10,501
The diamond has supernatural powers.

389
00:29:10,604 --> 00:29:13,767
lt would be a disaster
if it fell into the wrong hands.

390
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,274
I was supposed to give him this.

391
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:20,504
This is not a king- sized diamond.
This is a queen of diamonds.

392
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:22,981
What kind of sick joke is this?

393
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,980
- Can I have that?
- Very funny.

394
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:26,780
That is so sweet.

395
00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:29,285
You trying to take over for your father.

396
00:29:29,356 --> 00:29:31,620
These evil forces? They're bad people.

397
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:34,854
Relax, sister. I don't know
the meaning of the word ''fear.''

398
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:36,452
Say your prayers, duck!

399
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:38,794
Fear: noun. A state of terror.

400
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:40,497
Incoming!

401
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:53,480
This mission
needs years of experience and training.

402
00:29:53,548 --> 00:29:56,881
Maybe. I ain't got time for that right now.
I gotta go save my dad.

403
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,952
Don't lose that card. It's important.

404
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,781
After him, boys!

405
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:19,469
Easy on the feathers.

406
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:23,032
Come back here, you card- carrying coyote!

407
00:30:24,846 --> 00:30:27,405
Dadburn slapstick cliché!

408
00:30:27,915 --> 00:30:31,579
Faster! Climb like my life depended on it.

409
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:36,081
You run, I'll steer.

410
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:38,989
Right! I mean, left. Your other left.

411
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:46,364
That's what I’m talking about!

412
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:49,967
ls that all you got?

413
00:30:51,006 --> 00:30:53,133
That's gonna leave a mark.

414
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:58,011
That's not boxing. Bite his ear!

415
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:04,312
Left and a right and a
left and a right- left!

416
00:31:07,255 --> 00:31:09,348
I’m gonna come up on you.

417
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,231
I'll take that playing card.

418
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:30,038
- After it, stunt boy.
- Man.

419
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:31,273
Jump!

420
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,891
All right, when I say,
place your bets, gentlemen.

421
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:56,531
Money plays, loser stays.
Everyone's a.... Not everyone.

422
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:58,972
Here's my money. Now play.

423
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:01,139
- Card, sir?
- Hit me.

424
00:32:01,245 --> 00:32:04,304
Don't you want to
look at your cards first, son?

425
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:07,213
Boy's about as sharp as a bowling ball.

426
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,612
- Hit me.
- No, hit me first!

427
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,914
I said await your turn, sir.

428
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:13,251
Hit me.

429
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,293
No, hit me, fragnabbit!

430
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:27,565
- He's the boss.
- You son of a- -

431
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:29,003
Card, sir?

432
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,902
Hit me.

433
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,940
Twenty- one, a winner!

434
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,342
Let's go!

435
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:39,646
''And then they made
their heroic escape! ''

436
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,855
I say we do Cirque du Soleil
and call it a night.

437
00:32:50,295 --> 00:32:52,559
How about the Liberace Museum?

438
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:58,900
All right, let's see what this baby
can really do.

439
00:33:05,577 --> 00:33:07,568
Now, that's an interesting feature.

440
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:10,409
Come back, you absconders!

441
00:33:10,682 --> 00:33:12,616
Watch yourself, ma'am.

442
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:15,476
I love this rug.

443
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:19,255
- Come back here, you varmints!
- Run. Move. Go.

444
00:33:24,095 --> 00:33:25,427
Nice car.

445
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:27,154
Don't hit me.

446
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,257
It's a modified Chevrolet
with a big 24 on the side.

447
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:40,210
Out of the way, fancy boy.
I’m a- commandeering this here clown car.

448
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:42,041
After them, boys!

449
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,445
Shotgun!

450
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:47,985
Rag- flagging ragtag sidekicks!

451
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:52,853
Slow down, will you? I’m waddling here.

452
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:55,722
Come back, you darn idiot galoots!

453
00:34:00,566 --> 00:34:04,969
There's gotta be 314 hotels
and 142 casinos in Las Vegas.

454
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:07,199
We are never going to find that duck.

455
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:13,870
Daff never misses a cue.

456
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:23,411
- What's up, duck?
- Don't you start with me.

457
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:25,422
Excuse me.

458
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:27,720
You!

459
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:28,886
- You.
- Him.

460
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:30,223
- Her.
- Them !

461
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,728
Out of my way!

462
00:34:35,902 --> 00:34:37,494
Dagnabbit!

463
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:41,233
- You are in big trouble, mister.
- Agreed!

464
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:47,570
Out!

465
00:34:47,682 --> 00:34:50,377
What are you doing, kidnapping me?
Stop the car.

466
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,384
This is my adventure, bub.

467
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:00,589
Coming through.

468
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:08,433
What brings you to Las Vegas?
You ran out of people to fire in L.A.?

469
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:10,163
You stole my duck.

470
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:13,866
- Your duck? I belong to the world.
- You know what? You can have him.

471
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:26,418
Dynamite? Who has dynamite?

472
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:28,186
Welcome to my world.

473
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:31,215
Hang on.

474
00:35:43,738 --> 00:35:45,969
Throw it out the window. Throw it out!

475
00:35:46,073 --> 00:35:49,305
- But innocent people could be hurt.
- Throw it out the window!

476
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,073
lt will send the wrong message
to children.

477
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:10,227
Didn't he used to be behind us?

478
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:26,976
We're having duck tonight, boys.

479
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:31,450
Just a suggestion, but all those in favor
of not hitting that wall say ''aye.''

480
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,284
- Aye!
- Mother.

481
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:34,988
<i>Taking you to Mother.</i>

482
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:03,651
Look, a shooting star.
Quick, everybody make a wish.

483
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:08,990
You know, I’m beginning to think
that this one is the spy car.

484
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:09,786
What?

485
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,657
<i>ETA to Mother, 10 minutes.</i>

486
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:30,840
<i>Please return your seatbacks
to their full and upright position.</i>

487
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,111
So, what are your plans now, if I may ask?

488
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:36,618
Daffy will save us. He's the hero.

489
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,780
All right, bucktooth. Stick a carrot in it.

490
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:42,190
Everybody calm down, all right?
I can handle this.

491
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,963
Sell my Warner Brothers stock.

492
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,032
I got an inside tip
that Bugs Bunny is about to die.

493
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,048
Out of gas.

494
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:10,350
What? lt doesn't work like that.

495
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,756
Thanks, toots.

496
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,602
- Carrot?
- No, thanks.

497
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,776
You really think that playing card
is going to help you rescue your father?

498
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,283
Yeah, I do.

499
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:43,885
You know this all sounds insane, right?

500
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,855
I remember the first time
I saw your dad in the movies.

501
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,695
So breathtaking.

502
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,108
Your hair smells nice.

503
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:09,714
- You say something?
- No, just saying good night.

504
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,083
I’m telling you, Daffy...

505
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:16,212
I heard the Warner Brothers say
you were their best duck.

506
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:19,281
Flattered though I may be,
flattened I will not...

507
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,222
in order for you to get the laughs.

508
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:23,727
It's all.... And then....

509
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:28,223
- And your tail is on fire.
- Exactly my point.

510
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:30,791
No, really, your tail's on fire.

511
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,132
Daff, you're accident- prone.

512
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,107
What am I talking to you for?

513
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:43,739
All you have to do is munch on a carrot,
and people love you.

514
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:55,259
I need you to move my 12:00 appointment
up to 2:00 and then back to 1 1 :00.

515
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:59,093
Then just cancel it.
And I need you to get a helicopter and....

516
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,257
No, don't put me on hold.

517
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,259
Oh, God.

518
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,106
I can't die out here.

519
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,104
This wasn't the plan.

520
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:13,005
After this comedy...

521
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,010
I promised myself
I would only do real movies...

522
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,779
about the human condition
crammed with social relevance.

523
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:25,790
There's nothing but a big rock
for 10 miles in that, that...

524
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,016
that, and that direction.

525
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,358
I say we go that way.

526
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:36,265
Say, who are you kidding here?
We're goners!

527
00:40:36,335 --> 00:40:38,495
Water! I can't die now.

528
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:42,801
Think of the millions of children
who want me to have the diamond.

529
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,638
The poor children!

530
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:46,336
Look at that.

531
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:52,483
ls it a mirage? Or just product placement?

532
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:56,019
Who cares? With shopping convenience
at such low prices.

533
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:59,523
Water, Fresca, Mountain Dew.
Your product name here.

534
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,523
ls this your idea?

535
00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:06,058
The audience expects it.

536
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:09,464
They don't even notice
this kind of thing anymore.

537
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:14,799
Nice of Wal- Mart
to provide these Wal- Mart beverages...

538
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,969
in return for us saying ''Wal- Mart''
so many times.

539
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:24,681
Where's Yosemite Sam?

540
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:27,777
- What is your report?
- Boss, it wasn't me.

541
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:31,449
That razzan- frazzan duck
and that crazy son D.J...

542
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:33,891
and a humina- humina Dusty Tails.

543
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:37,823
You know, that makes a lot of sense.

544
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:39,297
Thank you.

545
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:47,296
Mr. Drake, are you going to save us
the bother of eliminating your son?

546
00:41:47,374 --> 00:41:50,172
My son is going to kick your evil butt.

547
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:53,371
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes, Dad.

548
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:56,312
- Desert operative.
- No.

549
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,881
Not a bad idea, Dad.

550
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:02,350
Our desert operative is due for a win.

551
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:19,831
I told you we should have
made that left turn at Albuquerque.

552
00:42:19,907 --> 00:42:21,898
Don't start that again.

553
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:55,436
All right. Here's the plan.

554
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:59,480
We wait here for the next truck or car
or camel or whatever...

555
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:01,810
and take Bugs and Daffy...

556
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:04,215
get back to Hollywood
and finish making the movie.

557
00:43:04,286 --> 00:43:05,913
What are you going to do?

558
00:43:05,988 --> 00:43:09,754
- I’m just gonna keep walking that way.
- That's your plan?

559
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:14,719
Yep. That's the direction
the car was going.

560
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:26,265
You're not leaving me here
while you make off with my diamond.

561
00:43:40,223 --> 00:43:42,623
I don't wanna get too wrapped up
in your caper...

562
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:46,491
but let's assume that you're right
and Damian Drake is a spy?

563
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:47,927
Super spy.

564
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:52,724
What's the point of just meandering
through the desert if....

565
00:43:57,574 --> 00:43:58,666
Here.

566
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:01,304
Be safe.

567
00:44:01,412 --> 00:44:04,108
- Attaboy. Trust your instincts.
- Yeah.

568
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:08,345
Except for the water tower, the Batmobile,
the rubble known as Las Vegas.

569
00:44:09,085 --> 00:44:13,317
There's nobody as rich, famous,
and powerful as my father...

570
00:44:13,424 --> 00:44:16,085
who just disappears into thin air.

571
00:44:21,332 --> 00:44:24,824
Suddenly I feel like
I'm in Aunt Marge's Jell- O mold.

572
00:44:25,302 --> 00:44:28,294
Guys, it's air- conditioned in here.
Come on in.

573
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:32,602
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

574
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:54,191
Easy.

575
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:02,631
Earth freak.

576
00:45:08,078 --> 00:45:11,913
Okay, buster.  Where's Damian
Drake and that big diamond?

577
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:17,151
Cleanup on aisle three.

578
00:45:17,656 --> 00:45:19,487
Can I be of service?

579
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:23,050
I am monitored to respond
to the name Robbie.

580
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:24,355
Hi, D.J.

581
00:45:25,664 --> 00:45:28,098
At ease. I’m Mother.

582
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:32,161
Yeah, like the car said
that we would be meeting you.

583
00:45:32,237 --> 00:45:33,727
How do you know my name?

584
00:45:33,906 --> 00:45:36,840
D.J., I've known you
since you were this big.

585
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:41,036
That's not really possible, is it?

586
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,045
Must have been a photo.

587
00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:46,209
Let me just take care
of this, and we'll....

588
00:45:47,887 --> 00:45:50,650
Give it to me straight. How bad is it?

589
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:52,418
So, shall we?

590
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:55,317
So little to do, so much time.

591
00:45:55,393 --> 00:45:59,387
You're going to put him back, right?
I can't go back to L.A. with duck soup.

592
00:45:59,498 --> 00:46:03,867
We do have the facilities
to reconstitute the body.

593
00:46:03,936 --> 00:46:06,871
The mind though,
will remain a gooey mess.

594
00:46:07,573 --> 00:46:09,404
So, about my father?

595
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:13,208
All in due time. Lovely. Yes. Blow.

596
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:17,773
All right, break it up, fellas. Nice coats.
White is the new black, you know.

597
00:46:17,883 --> 00:46:18,941
Yes.

598
00:46:19,886 --> 00:46:20,943
Look.

599
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:23,579
- So this is Area 51, right?
- No.

600
00:46:23,689 --> 00:46:26,716
The secret military base
where they keep the aliens?

601
00:46:26,793 --> 00:46:31,058
No, Area 51 is actually
a paranoid fantasy we concocted...

602
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,066
to hide the true identity of this facility.

603
00:46:34,134 --> 00:46:36,727
- Which is?
- Area 52.

604
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:39,104
But don't quote me on that.

605
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:41,400
Oh, right. Area 52.

606
00:46:44,478 --> 00:46:47,311
- So, Mother- -
- Call me ''Mom.''

607
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:51,247
Mom, what is it
that you do here exactly, anyway?

608
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:55,880
Creation, transubstantiation, destruction.
It's stressful. All kinds of things.

609
00:46:55,956 --> 00:46:58,891
They're already here. You're next.

610
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:01,723
My God...

611
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:03,094
what am I going to do with you?

612
00:47:03,164 --> 00:47:04,653
You've done nothing but screw up!

613
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:07,723
You've walked off mesas.
You've been smashed by boulders.

614
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:09,565
You've been run over by diesel trucks.

615
00:47:09,637 --> 00:47:12,970
Don't blame the equipment. It's good.
It's ACME equipment.

616
00:47:13,073 --> 00:47:15,565
You're a coyote. Be wily.

617
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:20,069
All right, now.
Buck up and let's see a little smile.

618
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:23,240
Little bigger.

619
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:28,354
That's nice.

620
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:33,250
Now, just go take a shower,
and don't come back till you smell better!

621
00:47:33,494 --> 00:47:38,363
Be careful. There're men moving a safe
out there, and I don't want you to....

622
00:47:39,033 --> 00:47:42,332
And be careful
of the box of fireworks because....

623
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:48,098
I suppose I should mention
the plate- glass window....

624
00:47:51,779 --> 00:47:53,906
It's tough being the boss.

625
00:47:58,453 --> 00:48:00,115
A communication.

626
00:48:00,189 --> 00:48:01,747
<i>Memo to Marvin the Martian.</i>

627
00:48:04,992 --> 00:48:07,655
<i>Obtain the playing card,
and destroy the duck.</i>

628
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:12,598
<i>And when I say destroy the duck,
I mean kill him viciously and painfully.</i>

629
00:48:13,035 --> 00:48:16,869
A mission? I’m all a- tingle.

630
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:21,207
So, here we are
in the I- can't- tell- you- what room.

631
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:23,061
Robert, can you take
care of that, please?

632
00:48:23,074 --> 00:48:24,836
Yes, madam.

633
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,115
When you bring Daffy back,
could you make him 20% funnier?

634
00:48:28,183 --> 00:48:31,050
- I heard that.
- What were we discussing?

635
00:48:31,153 --> 00:48:33,451
This isn't about the giant ants, is it?

636
00:48:33,522 --> 00:48:38,221
- Giant ants?
- Because they're not really ants anymore.

637
00:48:39,027 --> 00:48:41,359
Tell me about the Blue Monkey.

638
00:48:42,298 --> 00:48:46,701
How do you know about that thing
that I've never heard of in my entire life?

639
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,662
My dad told me.

640
00:48:50,006 --> 00:48:54,032
What is the point
of making them pinky swear?

641
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:57,075
All right.

642
00:48:58,147 --> 00:49:00,138
Now this tape will explain everything.

643
00:49:00,216 --> 00:49:03,208
lt was prepared especially for your father.

644
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:08,517
<i>Greetings, Damian Drake.</i>

645
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:13,153
<i>If you are watching this, you are aware
that the world is in grave danger.</i>

646
00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:17,530
<i>The ACME Corporation is in hot pursuit
of the Blue Monkey diamond...</i>

647
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,060
<i>a supernatural gem with the ability
to turn people into monkeys...</i>

648
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:23,434
<i>and then back again.</i>

649
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,703
<i>lt is the ACME chairman's goal
to turn the population...</i>

650
00:49:26,776 --> 00:49:31,009
<i>into monkey slaves
to manufacture shoddy ACME goods...</i>

651
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:33,777
<i>and then change them back to people
to buy the stuff.</i>

652
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:36,352
Unbelievable.

653
00:49:36,419 --> 00:49:38,114
<i>Unbelievable, you may say.</i>

654
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:42,715
<i>Your mission is this.
Find it, destroy it, save humanity.</i>

655
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:46,961
<i>And remember,
no one wants to be turned into a monkey.</i>

656
00:49:51,735 --> 00:49:53,292
So that's why.

657
00:49:53,971 --> 00:49:58,567
Those guys came after my dad
because he was going to save the world.

658
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:02,907
So that means if I go after the diamond,
then the bad guys come after me.

659
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:06,040
Hang on.
You're not seriously thinking about- -

660
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:08,880
Taking over your father's mission?

661
00:50:10,387 --> 00:50:12,617
- I guess that would be all right.
- What?

662
00:50:12,724 --> 00:50:17,217
Listen, if you're going to be a spy,
you'll need spy stuff.

663
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:21,627
So, is this where you keep
all the high- tech spy gadgets?

664
00:50:24,202 --> 00:50:25,293
Yes.

665
00:50:28,907 --> 00:50:31,205
That's cool. So I get
to use all this stuff?

666
00:50:31,276 --> 00:50:34,404
No, your stuff is over here.

667
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:38,040
But I really like the....

668
00:50:38,116 --> 00:50:41,813
All right. Looks like
an ordinary cell phone.

669
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:46,250
Three- way calling, voice dialing,
downloadable ringtones.

670
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:50,492
- My phone does all that.
- Superconducting electromagnet.

671
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:53,424
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

672
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:56,160
GPS with mapping software...

673
00:50:56,268 --> 00:50:58,964
tip calculator, Gameboy.

674
00:50:59,071 --> 00:51:00,298
Gameboy?

675
00:51:01,674 --> 00:51:03,436
High- powered laser.

676
00:51:03,508 --> 00:51:07,969
Polycarbonate rappelling line
with jet- propelled micro grappling hook.

677
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,976
Nose hair trimmer.
You always want to look your best.

678
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:14,814
Get over here, you idiot.
No, cold. Cold. Warm, warmer.

679
00:51:19,024 --> 00:51:20,686
<i>Permit me, madam.</i>

680
00:51:20,825 --> 00:51:23,590
Robert, darling. Excellent choice.

681
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,096
Swank pants.

682
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:27,162
And comfortable, too.

683
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:31,669
Plus, liquid hydrogen rocket pockets,
here and here.

684
00:51:31,772 --> 00:51:34,831
And stitching,
nuclear- powered crotch pad....

685
00:51:36,475 --> 00:51:38,136
He'll be down in a moment.

686
00:51:41,815 --> 00:51:43,475
Wakey, wakey, friends.

687
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:46,518
Time to wreak mayhem
in the cause of evil.

688
00:51:48,854 --> 00:51:52,882
Mother, just one last question.
What's the deal with this card?

689
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,323
That is the window
into what lies behind her smile.

690
00:51:57,396 --> 00:51:58,557
What?

691
00:51:58,665 --> 00:52:02,692
I’m sorry, our intelligence people
feel a need to code everything in a riddle.

692
00:52:02,803 --> 00:52:07,502
They get some kind of perverse pleasure
out of it. I think it's corporate.

693
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,474
All humans.

694
00:52:10,177 --> 00:52:12,270
Looks like we got company.

695
00:52:16,683 --> 00:52:18,275
Illegal aliens.

696
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:21,652
Exterminate them.

697
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:25,283
Darn. I knew this day would come.

698
00:52:26,461 --> 00:52:29,157
Let us exterminate them.

699
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:38,132
<i>Emergency shutdown activated.
Force- barrier seal in 30 seconds.</i>

700
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:39,672
Exterminate.

701
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:44,469
The playing card, please.

702
00:52:44,544 --> 00:52:47,878
I'll take that. Out of my way.
Hero coming through.

703
00:52:48,983 --> 00:52:50,712
There is no escape.

704
00:52:55,823 --> 00:52:57,586
You pesky fowl!

705
00:53:09,704 --> 00:53:14,266
Isn't it about time to enjoy a frosty,
cold soda at the concession stand?

706
00:53:15,044 --> 00:53:16,671
Exterminate!

707
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:19,740
Get the lead out.
Bus is leaving.

708
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:23,510
Halt or be fricasseed.

709
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,926
That was fun.

710
00:53:33,027 --> 00:53:34,689
Looking for this?

711
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,964
Now, what did she mean by a window?

712
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:43,970
The window into what lies
behind her smile.

713
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,141
That's the Mona Lisa.

714
00:53:47,242 --> 00:53:50,234
- Which is in the Louvre.
- Which is in Paris.

715
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,473
Just how are we supposed to get to Paris?

716
00:53:53,649 --> 00:53:54,911
Like this.

717
00:54:25,115 --> 00:54:27,583
lt doesn't look like
much of a window to me.

718
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,584
Maybe the diamond is in the painting.

719
00:54:29,652 --> 00:54:32,815
- All we have to do is steal the Mona Lisa.
- Way ahead of you.

720
00:54:34,257 --> 00:54:37,283
- No, you look, you don't touch, right?
- Yeah.

721
00:54:37,427 --> 00:54:39,224
But I’m already in costume.

722
00:54:39,295 --> 00:54:41,661
- That's a good look for you.
- Do you think so?

723
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:43,289
Wait a minute.

724
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,468
lt is a window.

725
00:54:57,915 --> 00:54:59,405
It's an X- ray.

726
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:01,645
Sorry.

727
00:55:04,421 --> 00:55:07,356
It's a map of Africa.
Maybe that's where the diamond is.

728
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:09,255
Hold it up. I'll take a picture.

729
00:55:09,426 --> 00:55:11,257
Can I take a picture? Please?

730
00:55:11,328 --> 00:55:14,320
Come on, give me your phone.
I want to take a picture, too.

731
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,194
Cheese it, the cops.

732
00:55:19,335 --> 00:55:20,428
He's gone.

733
00:55:20,504 --> 00:55:23,803
So let me take a picture, will you?
I want to take a picture, too.

734
00:55:23,874 --> 00:55:27,002
Come on, please? Can I hold the window?
Let me see the window.

735
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:28,669
I'll take that!

736
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:33,483
What gives, doc?
We made 35 pictures together.

737
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:36,642
As it turns out, I’m secretly evil.

738
00:55:37,022 --> 00:55:38,546
That's show biz for you.

739
00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:42,388
Now make with the card,
so I can please my dark masters.

740
00:55:42,494 --> 00:55:44,620
Yes, sir. Queen of diamonds is your card.

741
00:55:44,695 --> 00:55:48,290
Just put it back in the deck,
anywhere is fine. And oopsie- daisy!

742
00:55:48,365 --> 00:55:51,301
- ls this your card?
- No.

743
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:54,338
- This?
- No.

744
00:55:55,373 --> 00:55:58,308
- Run. This?
- No.

745
00:55:58,376 --> 00:56:00,844
I said it's the queen of diamonds,
I tell you.

746
00:56:00,912 --> 00:56:02,504
You mean, like this one?

747
00:56:06,418 --> 00:56:08,386
Think we should go back and help him?

748
00:56:08,486 --> 00:56:11,387
Elmer never gets Bugs.
It's a formula, but it works.

749
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:14,584
The great thing about movies,
you always know what will happen.

750
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:16,388
For instance, if this was a movie...

751
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:19,088
you and I’d probably wind up together.

752
00:56:23,703 --> 00:56:25,694
If you don't let go of me, I'll scream...

753
00:56:25,771 --> 00:56:27,965
but I’m not gonna stop screaming!

754
00:56:46,058 --> 00:56:48,253
Well, this is surreal.

755
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:52,897
Stop or I'll fire.

756
00:57:28,702 --> 00:57:29,896
Hello.

757
00:57:31,805 --> 00:57:33,066
Oh, my.

758
00:57:34,408 --> 00:57:35,932
Ladies, please.

759
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:52,652
Gendarme!

760
00:57:54,595 --> 00:57:57,495
<i>- Oui, monsieur?
- There's a man there. He's got a woman.</i>

761
00:57:57,597 --> 00:58:01,124
She's tied up in a burlap sack.
He's taking her to the Eiffel Tower.

762
00:58:01,235 --> 00:58:03,567
lt is spring, is it not?

763
00:58:21,989 --> 00:58:23,787
I’m gonna blast you.

764
00:58:33,668 --> 00:58:35,000
Shucks.

765
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:53,517
''Pointillism: A technique
of using individual dots of pigment...

766
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:56,590
''which, taken together, make an image.''

767
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,490
Oh, crud.

768
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:04,093
I think when you go to the movies,
you should learn something.

769
00:59:19,716 --> 00:59:22,708
<i>Pardonnez- moi. Excusez- moi.</i>

770
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:46,569
Look at that clown here.

771
00:59:46,675 --> 00:59:49,406
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

772
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,572
You.

773
00:59:52,849 --> 00:59:54,009
Come here.

774
00:59:54,084 --> 00:59:55,210
Wait a minute.

775
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:57,411
- I don't want any trouble.
- What are you doing?

776
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,750
I just want your pants!

777
01:00:04,427 --> 01:00:07,886
That's right. I’m a vicious bird of prey.

778
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:14,762
<i>Merci.</i>

779
01:00:45,336 --> 01:00:47,396
He's got the camera !

780
01:01:00,251 --> 01:01:01,878
Give the girl back!

781
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:53,097
- What kept you?
- You okay?

782
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:54,905
That was great.

783
01:02:01,948 --> 01:02:05,577
I’d say it's a perfect day.
Except for the fact that we lost the map.

784
01:02:05,651 --> 01:02:08,745
- We?
- All right, I’m the jerk who lost the map.

785
01:02:08,821 --> 01:02:11,984
And I’m the bunny
who saved the card. Voilà.

786
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:14,820
Nice going, Bugs.

787
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:18,356
Africa.

788
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:21,360
Chair people, I reveal to you...

789
01:02:21,467 --> 01:02:24,198
the whereabouts of the Blue Monkey.

790
01:02:29,276 --> 01:02:30,435
All right.

791
01:02:33,513 --> 01:02:37,210
There's a duck in the middle of the map.
Remove the duck.

792
01:02:37,483 --> 01:02:40,976
Remove the duck! The duck is in the....

793
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:42,347
Duck!

794
01:02:50,631 --> 01:02:55,034
We cannot let a boy, girl, duck, and rabbit
thwart our plans for global domination.

795
01:02:55,135 --> 01:02:57,535
- Wanna bet?
- A wager?

796
01:02:57,804 --> 01:03:02,468
$5 says my son will scuttle
your diabolical plans and save the world.

797
01:03:02,676 --> 01:03:05,543
You're awfully spunky
for a man in your position.

798
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:09,716
How do you like that,
Mr. Slap Yourself in Your Own Face?

799
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:11,876
Give him a good zets
every once in a while.

800
01:03:11,985 --> 01:03:13,475
My pleasure.

801
01:03:13,554 --> 01:03:16,249
Now, I think I'm going to hedge my bet.

802
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:19,257
I’m going to unleash
our most vicious operative.

803
01:03:28,703 --> 01:03:33,504
<i>Mr. Chairman, while we agree that the
Tasmanian Devil is quite vicious...</i>

804
01:03:33,707 --> 01:03:37,439
<i>if memory serves, he is also really stupid.</i>

805
01:03:37,712 --> 01:03:40,180
Really? So are you.

806
01:03:48,256 --> 01:03:49,689
That's a good boy.

807
01:03:55,296 --> 01:03:57,355
I withdraw my objection.

808
01:04:13,114 --> 01:04:15,640
This would have been
a lot easier underground.

809
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:20,154
Come on, it's only another 6,000 cubits
in this here thick direction.

810
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:29,258
Look, Granny,
it's that nice boy from next door.

811
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:31,493
Little Damian.

812
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,325
How funny seeing you here, dear.

813
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:35,797
Hi, Granny.

814
01:04:35,904 --> 01:04:38,839
Would you and your little friends
like a lift?

815
01:04:39,608 --> 01:04:41,269
Giddy-up, Dumbo.

816
01:04:42,244 --> 01:04:45,737
Sure was a lucky coincidence
you showing up just now.

817
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,007
Yes, wasn't it?

818
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:08,600
I've discovered my roots.

819
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,764
I've discovered my lunch.

820
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,273
Cry freedom !

821
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,327
What a fantastic view.

822
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:33,962
Unless you're in the audience...

823
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,058
in which case you've been staring
at an elephant's behind for 30 seconds.

824
01:05:40,538 --> 01:05:42,402
My destiny awaits.

825
01:05:48,379 --> 01:05:49,744
I guess this is our stop.

826
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:52,838
Enjoy the rest of your adventure, children.

827
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:23,372
This is the Blue Monkey?
This dime- store bauble?

828
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:27,849
- I've been rooked. Shafted by the gods.
- Nice going, Daffy.

829
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:31,081
I demand recompense.
I want my diamond.

830
01:06:31,289 --> 01:06:33,882
Where is my humongous rock?

831
01:06:37,395 --> 01:06:38,692
Pressed duck.

832
01:06:49,307 --> 01:06:52,071
- This looks like a puzzle piece.
- What?

833
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:54,642
Wait a minute.

834
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,462
Are we rich yet?

835
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,002
Any time now.

836
01:07:55,642 --> 01:07:58,873
I’m rich. I’m affluent.
My liquidity is assured.

837
01:08:01,147 --> 01:08:03,878
Daffy, get back here. Don't touch that!

838
01:08:04,217 --> 01:08:05,878
Let go! Don't you dare!

839
01:08:05,985 --> 01:08:08,613
- The rock is mine. So close.
- You mind?

840
01:08:08,688 --> 01:08:11,988
Yes, I mind. I'm the hero.
I should get the treasure.

841
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:14,721
The girl, too, but we'll
discuss that later.

842
01:08:17,531 --> 01:08:21,490
Careful with my diamond. Easy, now.

843
01:08:29,577 --> 01:08:32,477
Dad, this is for you.

844
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:43,055
Why, D.J., why you? Why wasn't it me?

845
01:08:43,523 --> 01:08:46,151
Just academic curiosity, you understand.

846
01:08:46,226 --> 01:08:48,422
Gotta go. Bank closes at 5:00.

847
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:52,089
- Come on, Daffy, change him back.
- All right.

848
01:08:52,834 --> 01:08:54,392
Buddy pictures.

849
01:08:57,537 --> 01:08:59,938
- D.J., pal, you're okay.
- Yeah.

850
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:03,273
Give me that.

851
01:09:03,378 --> 01:09:06,211
- I liked you better as a monkey.
- Thanks.

852
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:09,413
That is so sweet.

853
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:13,020
Now if you could just
hand over the diamond.

854
01:09:17,225 --> 01:09:18,693
Immediately!

855
01:09:19,962 --> 01:09:21,258
My turn.

856
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:30,135
Pardon.

857
01:09:30,973 --> 01:09:32,758
All right, now, I've
come for the diamond.

858
01:09:32,771 --> 01:09:34,567
I knew it
was you.

859
01:09:34,777 --> 01:09:38,234
You knew it was me, did you?
You're wrong. Because I’m not me.

860
01:09:38,312 --> 01:09:39,939
I’m actually....

861
01:09:41,116 --> 01:09:43,380
I can't. I can't reach over the hat.

862
01:09:43,452 --> 01:09:46,444
I’d rehearse back at ACME,
but I never wore the hat.

863
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:49,456
And now the hat is throwing me off.
Would you....

864
01:09:49,591 --> 01:09:52,560
Thank you very much. Now, I’m actually....

865
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:56,661
Your father.

866
01:09:57,466 --> 01:09:59,434
- Dad.
- Saw that one coming.

867
01:09:59,501 --> 01:10:01,401
Look into your heart, D.J.

868
01:10:01,837 --> 01:10:05,170
- You know it's true.
- No, it can't be true.

869
01:10:05,507 --> 01:10:07,338
You're right, it isn't.

870
01:10:09,645 --> 01:10:11,341
Let's do some drills.

871
01:10:12,181 --> 01:10:14,342
This doesn't make a lick of sense.

872
01:10:16,252 --> 01:10:18,310
Well, who's laughing now?

873
01:10:20,023 --> 01:10:23,083
Apparently, no one.
Anyway, give me the Monkey!

874
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:25,320
No, forget that, man. You're evil.

875
01:10:26,695 --> 01:10:28,527
Thank you, but....

876
01:10:28,764 --> 01:10:33,167
Anyway, Mr. Smith,
let's show this muscle- bound beefcake...

877
01:10:33,269 --> 01:10:35,760
who I have sometimes been mistaken for...

878
01:10:35,839 --> 01:10:38,501
what it's like to live in the real world.

879
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:46,447
Have you ever been disintegrated in one
place and then reassembled in another?

880
01:10:46,516 --> 01:10:47,813
Fire away.

881
01:10:53,656 --> 01:10:55,556
No, you don't!

882
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,420
I thought they fixed that glitch.

883
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:31,654
Mr. Smith is fired!

884
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:34,197
I have to do everything myself
around here.

885
01:11:37,702 --> 01:11:39,999
- Good.
- You....

886
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:48,341
Henchmen.

887
01:11:48,412 --> 01:11:49,538
Dad.

888
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:52,042
So this is the remote that works.

889
01:11:52,951 --> 01:11:56,078
This, my friend,
is the ACME Train of Death...

890
01:11:56,388 --> 01:11:58,913
which is not good news for your father.

891
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:00,455
<i>Don't worry about me, son.</i>

892
01:12:00,559 --> 01:12:02,925
<i>I've gotten out of worse scrapes
than this one.</i>

893
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:05,861
You see, if the Train of Death
doesn't kill him...

894
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:08,092
then those crates of TNT will.

895
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,033
Not to mention
the 2- ton anvil hanging over his head.

896
01:12:11,102 --> 01:12:14,071
And look. There's the Pendulum of Doom.

897
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:17,302
What's the Pendulum of Doom
doing there? I did not order it.

898
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,877
It's overkill. Get rid of it.

899
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,407
Now, if you want to
keep your family ''together''...

900
01:12:26,118 --> 01:12:28,814
I would hand over the Blue Monkey now.

901
01:12:29,622 --> 01:12:31,886
<i>Don't worry, son. I’m fine.</i>

902
01:12:38,163 --> 01:12:41,599
- You're a sick man, you know that?
- Get used to it.

903
01:12:42,235 --> 01:12:44,566
Excuse me? What about my father?

904
01:12:46,071 --> 01:12:49,007
- He's waiting for a train.
- What? You....

905
01:12:49,775 --> 01:12:51,675
Where's Marvin the Martian?

906
01:12:51,978 --> 01:12:56,005
All right, here is the Blue Monkey.
Go put it on the satellite. Go!

907
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,676
No, you don't, eight ball.

908
01:13:15,635 --> 01:13:18,537
You'd never catch that rabbit
being this heroic.

909
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:21,870
- What's up, doc?
- You're despicable.

910
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,297
Vandals.

911
01:13:54,141 --> 01:13:57,042
Your friends' efforts
will prove to be futile.

912
01:13:57,144 --> 01:14:01,080
You see, here is the Blue Monkey,
here is the ACME satellite.

913
01:14:01,181 --> 01:14:04,913
When the Blue Monkey
is finally docked in the satellite...

914
01:14:06,353 --> 01:14:08,584
I will transmit a beam around the world...

915
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:12,182
which will transform
everyone but me into monkeys.

916
01:14:12,694 --> 01:14:14,719
Now take them away!

917
01:14:15,262 --> 01:14:17,026
Don't you think that'll get lonely...

918
01:14:17,098 --> 01:14:21,262
Mr. All My Friends Swing from Trees
and Pick Fleas Out of Their Furry Butts?

919
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:25,567
Lonely? I suppose I could use
a little human companionship.

920
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,430
Thanks a lot.

921
01:14:27,942 --> 01:14:30,001
I've seen you notice me.

922
01:14:30,545 --> 01:14:32,103
I know I'm hot.

923
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:36,445
But I prefer someone
with a little more oomph.

924
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:39,385
I prefer Mary!

925
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:44,925
Hello, Mary.

926
01:14:45,059 --> 01:14:46,959
We're a cute couple, don't you think?

927
01:14:47,061 --> 01:14:50,862
Take those future simians away
and lower the Monkey shield.

928
01:15:06,815 --> 01:15:09,909
Earthlings have
the worst sense of direction.

929
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:16,115
What do you know, he fell for it.
I guess I owe you $5.

930
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:35,601
Did you order satellite?

931
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:37,742
I don't even have cable.

932
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:50,619
You know, when I fired that duck...

933
01:15:50,994 --> 01:15:53,019
I never would have seen this coming.

934
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:54,619
Gotta be a way out of this.

935
01:15:54,697 --> 01:15:58,463
<i>You can get out of this, son.
You've just got to set your mind to it.</i>

936
01:15:58,535 --> 01:16:01,527
Besides, I’m hearing my dad's voice
in my head.

937
01:16:01,704 --> 01:16:04,502
Actually, I’m down here, son.

938
01:16:11,314 --> 01:16:13,714
Hold on, Dad, I'll be right down!

939
01:16:18,822 --> 01:16:20,222
That was too easy.

940
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:32,363
What was that noise, son?

941
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:38,174
- You know how I always wanted a dog?
- Yeah?

942
01:16:38,876 --> 01:16:40,138
I just got one.

943
01:16:53,757 --> 01:16:56,352
Wait. Maybe he wants to play fetch.

944
01:16:57,027 --> 01:17:01,088
- Nice mechanical doggy.
- Good dog. Want to play?

945
01:17:01,565 --> 01:17:04,557
Good boy. Fetch!

946
01:17:15,614 --> 01:17:18,583
lt looks to be
a deadly mission requiring strength...

947
01:17:18,683 --> 01:17:20,707
cunning and nerves of steel.

948
01:17:20,784 --> 01:17:23,776
So good luck, Bugsy,
I'll keep the engine running.

949
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:26,912
You tricked me!

950
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:28,589
What's up, Darth?

951
01:17:28,693 --> 01:17:32,287
Now I must incapacitate you
with my bubble gun.

952
01:17:32,797 --> 01:17:34,196
Ain't that cute?

953
01:17:35,867 --> 01:17:39,269
Of course you realize this means war.

954
01:17:51,783 --> 01:17:54,617
You go that way. I’m gonna go this way.

955
01:18:09,135 --> 01:18:11,228
Bad dog! Sit!

956
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:14,064
I don't want to put you
under any added pressure...

957
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:17,632
but judging by the vibrations
of these train tracks, I've got about...

958
01:18:17,743 --> 01:18:20,075
one minute and forty- two seconds left.

959
01:18:20,146 --> 01:18:21,636
Down! Put him down.

960
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:34,282
What am I gonna do?
What would Damian Drake do?

961
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,192
What would Duck Dodgers do?

962
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:38,763
Wait a minute. I am Duck Dodgers!

963
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:41,627
Yes, I’m going to be the hero
of this picture!

964
01:18:41,701 --> 01:18:44,000
Duck Dodgers to the rescue!

965
01:18:54,815 --> 01:18:55,941
Duck....

966
01:18:58,986 --> 01:19:02,945
It's you- know- who to the rescue!
lt helps if you don't say the name.

967
01:19:09,029 --> 01:19:10,155
Bad dog!

968
01:20:05,953 --> 01:20:09,856
Disgusting Earth rodent.
Now to neutralize that duck.

969
01:20:17,132 --> 01:20:18,621
This can't be good.

970
01:20:22,971 --> 01:20:27,635
Now the diamond will bathe the Earth
in a monkey- transforming glow.

971
01:20:27,943 --> 01:20:31,572
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven...</i>

972
01:20:32,146 --> 01:20:34,980
<i>six, five, four...</i>

973
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:37,942
<i>three, two, one.</i>

974
01:20:39,788 --> 01:20:42,313
Thwarting evil makes me so angry.

975
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,789
That takes care of that.

976
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,971
Thanks, Daff.

977
01:21:08,284 --> 01:21:10,513
Darn dark side!

978
01:21:12,622 --> 01:21:14,111
Are you all monkeys yet?

979
01:21:30,473 --> 01:21:33,932
Checkmate, Mr. Chairman.
You're going down.

980
01:21:37,013 --> 01:21:39,312
Come on, say it.
Just a little ''You're my hero''?

981
01:21:39,383 --> 01:21:41,612
- Nope, sorry.
- Bugs, say it, come on.

982
01:21:41,684 --> 01:21:44,347
- Not interested.
- No one will ever know.

983
01:21:47,957 --> 01:21:50,221
I’m really proud of you, D.J.

984
01:21:50,661 --> 01:21:52,788
I knew I could count on you.

985
01:21:53,731 --> 01:21:54,857
Yes.

986
01:21:57,134 --> 01:21:59,363
Dad, I think we should move.

987
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:04,567
- What was wrong with Beverly Hills?
- I meant from this spot.

988
01:22:22,761 --> 01:22:26,356
- I think we scratched it.
- Don't worry, it's a rental.

989
01:22:26,431 --> 01:22:28,660
You guys, you pulled it off!

990
01:22:28,732 --> 01:22:31,395
- You pulled it off, all right.
- Give me that.

991
01:22:31,502 --> 01:22:32,902
Way to go, Daffy.

992
01:22:33,004 --> 01:22:35,437
You didn't do so bad yourself, stunt boy.

993
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:36,904
To set the record straight...

994
01:22:37,008 --> 01:22:40,739
all credit for saving the human race
goes to Daffy.

995
01:22:40,845 --> 01:22:42,107
Exactly.

996
01:22:42,214 --> 01:22:44,944
Oh, no, you don't, buster. You're the hero.

997
01:22:46,952 --> 01:22:51,286
Wait a minute. Pronoun trouble.
I’m the hero.

998
01:22:51,389 --> 01:22:52,879
I’m the hero, all right.

999
01:22:53,425 --> 01:22:55,289
Are you gonna introduce us, D.J.?

1000
01:22:55,393 --> 01:22:58,556
- Dad, this is Kate. Kate, this is- -
- Damian Drake.

1001
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:02,465
I’m a really big fan...of your son.

1002
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:07,236
Daff, you achieved your goal
of being a hero.

1003
01:23:07,306 --> 01:23:09,796
Yep, but you didn't achieve your goal...

1004
01:23:09,909 --> 01:23:12,434
of getting me back in your stupid movie.

1005
01:23:13,545 --> 01:23:16,480
- Cut. Great, that's a wrap.
- That's it, guys.

1006
01:23:16,581 --> 01:23:19,141
Remind me to get a new agent, will you?

1007
01:23:19,318 --> 01:23:20,580
Thanks.

1008
01:23:21,253 --> 01:23:23,814
Wait a minute. Maybe we are a team.

1009
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:27,585
Bugs and Daffy. No, Daffy and Bugs.
What do you think?

1010
01:23:32,564 --> 01:23:34,465
Excuse me, do you remember me?

1011
01:23:34,567 --> 01:23:37,764
I threatened your manliness,
and you got me fired?

1012
01:23:37,936 --> 01:23:39,404
I know you.

1013
01:23:40,072 --> 01:23:41,596
Do I know him?

1014
01:23:41,973 --> 01:23:46,001
You must be someone that I got fired.
See, I get a lot of people fired.

1015
01:23:47,413 --> 01:23:49,938
- You be good now.
- So like I said....

1016
01:23:52,752 --> 01:23:55,744
Not again. He's down again. Are you okay?

1017
01:23:55,955 --> 01:23:58,151
- Come on.
- He said he can do stunts.

1018
01:23:58,257 --> 01:23:59,747
Bugs is here. Gotta go.

1019
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:01,259
Daffy, you're right.

1020
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:03,523
- The usual place, Mr. Bunny?
- Very good.

1021
01:24:03,629 --> 01:24:07,532
From now on, you and I are going to be
equal partners in this thing.

1022
01:24:07,634 --> 01:24:09,760
No more second banana for you.

1023
01:24:10,202 --> 01:24:13,138
Thanks, pal. I really appreciate this.

At last my star is rising.

All my hopes and aspirations....

My luck is changing already.

Go home, folks.
