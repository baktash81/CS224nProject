3
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,400
You.
We surrounded you.

4
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,350
I'm English. Do not shoot.

5
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,330
Go there, take the weapon.

6
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,460
Do not be here.

7
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,300
Where is the air force?

8
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,510
The Navy asked for this.

9
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,460
We'll be back in 1 hour.

10
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,390
That was before.

11
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
Do not make a mess of that stuff over there.

12
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,500
It's only for the English.

13
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,250
- Can not.
- We can not do this!

14
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,480
You have your own ship, back!

15
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,250
Back, you got your ship
Myself, this is a english ship.

16
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,250
Bring them here, quick! Move out! Move out!

17
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,290
Quick, fast, fast!

18
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,330
He will die!

19
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,400
Step aside, step aside, watch everything!

20
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,280
Get ready!

21
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,490
All in one! Give more space!

22
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,480
Move out!

23
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,480
It's medical, give them a way.

24
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,350
- Lower the rope.
- Yes, Sir!

25
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,440
Their fullness, no
Can you transport them?

26
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,340
I have something to say.

27
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,470
I thought you were cornered.

28
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,410
[VOICE RADIO]

29
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,300
Give the room!

30
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,290
Go ahead.

31
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,490
Get ready up front.

32
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,290
Do not we wait for the navy.

33
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,360
We're just waiting for orders, I'm not the captain.

34
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,360
OK.

35
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,230
Thank you George.

36
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,340
Heydrick, do you know where we are?

37
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,380
- France.
- No need to wait.

38
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,350
How is it there?

39
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,280
He's behind me.

40
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,380
I'll take care of him.

41
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,230
Go to the line.

42
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,290
You two go.

43
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,360
- Go away!
- We should check the damage.

44
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,470
You see..

45
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,340
Whose party is it?

46
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,450
Our plane, George.

47
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,230
3, 2, 1 now!

48
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,280
Did he fall?

49
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,460
Yes, he was destroyed.

50
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,190
Our fortress defeated him.

51
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,400
Fortress do you hear me?

52
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:49,270
Force 2 I have
See the plane, replace it.

53
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,220
Understanding Force 1.

54
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,450
Hello, lieutenant.

55
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,260
- We have to do that, sir.
- Well do that.

56
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,350
Go.

57
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,330
General, you have to decide how many
Many more have to carry the wounded.

58
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,270
No, tell them to
Line up here. Excuse me.

59
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,290
- Let me help you.
- Commander.

60
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,220
- What about our territory?
- Minimizes every day.

61
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,320
I have ordered troops
France to hold its ranks.

62
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,300
And his tanks were trapped.

63
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,300
Why get stuck?

64
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,360
They think the tank is too
Worth to leave the island.

65
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,460
How long do you think they can
Hold it before we get back?

66
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,280
Back? Nothing stops here,
We must bring back his troops.

67
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,370
- the next UK and other countries.
- Of course.

68
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,280
We will trust the troops
Bodyguards start from here.

69
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,420
- What?
- Home..

70
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,390
What about France?

71
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,420
We are asked to meet
At the meeting place.

72
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,430
Prepare the troops
We go together.

73
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,260
- And his new troop?
- We're leaving all.

74
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,460
How many troops
Who's he talking about, sir?

75
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,410
That's only one, 20,000
And we can give 45.

76
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,400
There are 400,000 troops on this beach, sir.

77
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,440
We just have to do our best.

78
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,380
We can not stay here.

79
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,440
We have troops of distance
Far to the western part.

80
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,480
If there is anything else,
Bodyguards are here.

81
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,460
They will always be able
Prevent this place.

82
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,390
But it is not possible. Too low.

83
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:48,390
If there is anything to be able to accommodate
They though a small boat, will not
Can make them a destroyer.

84
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,230
We will have to reduce that, gentlemen.

85
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,370
Hey!

86
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,420
Hey!

87
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,440
Hey! Can you swim?

88
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,420
I can not reach it!

89
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,430
Hold on.

90
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,300
What is your name?

91
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,390
- There's a ship falling down below.
- Did you see anyone?

92
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,300
No .. We'd better leave it alone.

93
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,290
- You think he's okay?
- Maybe he should be all right.

94
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,500
Recording position

95
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,440
- 1071285.
- 10000?

96
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,310
Let's say 12 to 100 feet.

97
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,290
- Force 2, how much is your fuel?
- 50 gallons, replace.

98
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,350
50 gallons?

99
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,230
All right, keep telling me.
Because mine is broken.

100
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,360
- Do you think your fuel is enough?
- I do not know .. I can not see it.

101
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,270
- It will be destroyed!
- Thomas!

102
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,430
Go!

103
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,460
- It will be destroyed!
- Thomas!

104
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,380
What about the injured?

105
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,320
Hurry up! They will
Sink his ship!

106
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,470
Do you want to go inside?
It was much warmer.

107
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,480
A lot of wind here.

108
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,370
Leave him alone, George.
He feels safer here.

109
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,320
He wants to tell us
If we will be in bomb.

110
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,510
Human..

111
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,450
I'm still human.

112
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,260
Come and help me, George.

113
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,340
OK. We're out for 15 minutes
So it will climb to 2000, replace.

114
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,410
We need more fuel.

115
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:53,410
No, I do not want to be pursued again.
We'll go up and land there, change.

116
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:00,390
Understand. Angle 2, replace.

117
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,300
All right, up the stairs .. Let's go
Find you another ship.

118
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:37,490
Welcome.
Keep going down. Down.

119
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,390
Warm and comfortable down there.

120
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,330
Go downstairs.
Grab the blanket.

121
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,240
Make a space. Take a break.

122
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,270
Keep going down there.

123
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,280
So where's your friend?

124
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,270
Maybe we should
Find a way out.

125
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,370
This place will be ruined.

126
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,350
Where are our goals?

127
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,370
Dunkirk.

128
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,220
No, they will
Waiting for us there.

129
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,390
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

130
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,260
I will not go back there.

131
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,360
I will not be back ...

132
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:01,370
Look, if we go there.
We will die.

133
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,470
I understand, let's change the direction of the ship.

134
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,440
I'm talking to you, hello?
You hear me?

135
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,460
- We have to change the direction of this ship.
- Yes.

136
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,370
This.

137
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,280
Your place over there.

138
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,310
Take a break.
It's safe here.

139
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,400
He seemed terrified.

140
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,430
He's in shock, he is
not like usual.

141
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:15,270
Maybe he will not
Back as before again.

142
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:25,220
This.

143
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,430
I have to lower my height.

144
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,410
40,000 feet.

145
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,510
Moves towards 9 o'clock.
Do not let them get mine.

146
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,410
- OK.
- You have to take the right side.

147
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,460
Let's go up first.

148
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,300
Now...!

149
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,330
Oh, my God!

150
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,320
I will fall.

151
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,320
Get out of there.

152
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,420
I'll try to land it.

153
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,290
Yes!

154
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,260
Please!

155
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,300
- Help us!
- Please!

156
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,410
- Help us!
- Please, someone!

157
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:43,480
Please..!

158
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,450
Please!

159
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,350
Torpedo...!

160
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,460
No!

161
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,300
What happened?

162
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:22,450
- Everything goes to the deck.
- Climb to the deck!

163
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,340
There!

164
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,330
Please!

165
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,540
Please!

166
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:15,430
Hurry up, George.
We do not have time.

167
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,300
- Did you see that?
- Like a Rolls Royce engine.

168
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,310
The sound is normal here.

169
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,510
Hello?

170
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,250
Open the door?
Hello, can you hear me?

171
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,280
Open the door!

172
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,260
You hear me?

173
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,260
- What is wrong?
- You're the one who locked him up.

174
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,290
Let him out.
I'll talk to him.

175
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,440
Let me out!

176
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:57,340
When I was your age, I went to war.

177
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:02,210
I'm still alive today
To see the children beperang.

178
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,220
There is something strange.
I will continue to follow him.

179
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,420
It decreases to a height of 15,000 feet.

180
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,430
Okay, I understand.

181
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,300
I've recorded it.

182
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,470
Gomez, you accept?

183
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,240
Hey, come on.

184
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,350
Come up.

185
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,250
Up!

186
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,310
- We'll help you.
- Please!

187
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,380
- They will attack again.
- No!

188
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:53,450
- Come here!
- They've drowned the ship.

189
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,460
You have to stay calm,
There are many ships here.

190
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,400
You have to help them all!

191
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,430
- You got a buoy?
- Correct.

192
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:07,410
The water is not too cold,
Just swim to the beach.

193
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:14,340
- There's still a place!
- Just go back to the beach and wait for another boat.

194
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:19,340
Or just wait here,
We will be back for you guys.

195
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,410
All ready?

196
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,360
Paddle!

197
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,230
Paddle!

198
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,300
Paddle!

199
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:35,270
Paddle!

200
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,370
Paddle!

201
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,240
Paddle!

202
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,310
You can not hide, son.

203
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,320
What do you want to do
there? Seriously.

204
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,380
You're not just an employee there.
Everything is drowning.

205
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,320
Not just you are stranded.

206
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,230
- We have guns.
- Yes, from the exchange of goods.

207
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,290
You can help us
On a rescue boat.

208
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,270
You fools.

209
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,200
I will not go back there.

210
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,200
- Playback.
- I will not spin.

211
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,400
Playback!

212
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,480
Playback!

213
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,280
You're gonna kill us all!

214
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,290
- It is okay...
- Come on, turn back!

215
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,410
George?

216
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,390
George...

217
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,260
She fainted.

218
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,320
Okay, I'll take the medicine.

219
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,270
You'll be all right.

220
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,330
Hold on. Okay...

221
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,240
Okay, I'll keep him here.

222
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,470
This will stop the bleeding.

223
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,270
Yes, so ...

224
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,370
Are you all right, George?

225
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,250
Push...!

226
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,410
It's okay, this is it
Part of his war.

227
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,410
You know, that's what I said.

228
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,480
How do you know?

229
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,330
His body was back.

230
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,490
Hey.

231
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,330
Hey, how's it going?

232
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,280
- Hey, how's it going?
- Do not worry.

233
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,420
Come on! It's tied up.
There's no way it can escape.

234
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,410
Do not be afraid.

235
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,510
Hey, young master Dawson.

236
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,290
You never
Heard about them.

237
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,420
Are you ok.
Are you alright.

238
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,310
I let him go.

239
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:28,430
I let him go.

240
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,470
That's the only thing
I've done it for him.

241
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,280
It is okay. Drink.

242
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,250
I said I got him.

243
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,340
I did what I was taught.

244
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,310
I know one day
I will do it.

245
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,390
You know, we can come back.

246
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,520
Maybe they'll see it.

247
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,230
Okay, take a break.

248
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:55,330
I want you back to
Deck as soon as possible.

249
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:59,400
- Uh ..
- What?

250
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,250
I can not say that.

251
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,410
Sir?

252
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,280
The French army already
Beaten back in the west.

253
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,310
- That's a good development.
- For now.

254
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:23,380
I want you out of the way. Get out of the way!

255
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:36,470
- Where are they?
- They're coming.

256
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,200
No.

257
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,310
No.

258
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,300
What? What?

259
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:46,250
I think we lost a ship.

260
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,270
The help is here. For
Do they save him?

261
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,310
The next troops,
Who helped England.

262
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,480
They sent her to the same place.

263
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,480
But it's there.

264
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:01,280
They can do it.

265
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,460
Silence alone will not
Helps us to return.

266
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,430
They have to send
More ships.

267
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:09,230
If we are silent,
His enemy will draw near.

268
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,260
Back to the base,
Collect his soldiers.

269
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:16,330
- What for?
- At least that's what we can do.

270
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:22,280
Civilians? They
Will destroy it.

271
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,250
The more troops,
We can win.

272
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,310
But not in this condition.

273
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:29,290
I prefer like
It is rather than dead.

274
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,280
They're here, they are
Will come here.

275
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,360
They come from the north.

276
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:42,270
At least we can get ready
To face them.

277
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,300
We're leaving in 6 hours.

278
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,240
I think in three hours.

279
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,340
That's good for your troops, right?

280
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,350
Yes. Of course.

281
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,360
- Where's the crew?
- Maybe apart after being stranded.

282
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:16,500
Let's check the beach.

283
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,340
- Why?
- Just do my commands.

284
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:22,210
Anything can be there.

285
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,440
Okay, we check the part
That part. On the other side.

286
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,410
How long?

287
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,470
Maybe 3 hours.

288
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,280
Put pressure on it.
Clean out the blood.

289
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,250
What?

290
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:08,250
Conditions are bad.

291
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,450
We have to go back.

292
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,460
We've gone this far.

293
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,470
What is our ship?

294
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,270
Right, we're going there.

295
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,280
No, we have to get ready,
There may be survivors.

296
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,340
If we do that, we must
Save ourselves.

297
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,410
I'm going up, looking
Whether they have come.

298
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:46,260
Am I talking too much?

299
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,250
They almost arrived.

300
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:15,450
Calm down. We'll be back, right?

301
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:18,360
Yes, but how long?

302
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:28,460
That's them!

303
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,230
Spitfire plane!

304
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,310
No, no..

305
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,230
- See what they do!
- Yes.

306
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,330
They show us direction.

307
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,370
Yes.

308
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,350
No, no..

309
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,370
They're heading to the Spitfire!

310
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,350
Get ready!

311
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,230
Hey..

312
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,470
- No, no, no.
- Who is that?

313
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:20,500
- Are you German?
- No, Netherlands!

314
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,250
I'm Dutch.

315
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,380
- I'm here to help you guys.
- How can we be sure?

316
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,320
I know the Germans are coming.

317
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,380
They waited on their shores,
Waiting for the tidal wave.

318
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:35,260
We will back.

319
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:40,290
They will come. We must
Sailing in a few hours.

320
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,460
A few hours? Why are you back?

321
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,540
I do not have anything, because
That's me not so go.

322
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,350
Seriously!

323
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,260
How's it going, Collins?

324
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:36,450
His plane crashed.

325
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:17,350
No.

326
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,270
It's because of the engine, the engine is dead.

327
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:23,430
No ships.

328
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,470
Dad, come on, no boats!

329
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:32,240
- Maybe he's dead.
- Be quiet! I heard you!

330
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,220
Do not be noisy, shut up!

331
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,310
Maybe we can help him.

332
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,500
Do not! They do not know
We are in here.

333
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:37,240
Why are they shooting at us?

334
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,440
We must hide.

335
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:45,320
Tommy, you can do this.

336
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,350
Where are you?

337
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:50,310
They're coming ..

338
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,250
Come on, come on, come on.

339
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,270
We have to close it.

340
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:14,240
How to?

341
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,230
Come on. Hurry up.

342
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:45,340
How do we get out of here?

343
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,500
We have to open this place.

344
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,510
Wait! We have to wait.

345
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,480
- Wait. Wait.
- Yes.

346
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,410
Someone ... Somebody has to get out.

347
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,410
Who wants to volunteer?

348
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,390
I do not need volunteers.

349
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:02,250
I need someone who is brave.

350
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,350
You're the one who goes up.

351
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,490
He's a German spy. Let him alone.

352
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:14,260
He's a spy and we're not
Telling him who he is.

353
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,500
Do you agree?

354
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:19,260
You do not speak English.

355
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:22,370
If he survived to
Germany, we will be finished.

356
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,440
Certain. Tell him.

357
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,280
Yes.

358
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:30,480
Tell me.

359
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,510
Tell me, Gibson.

360
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,450
Tell me!

361
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:12,220
For God's sake, just let me know.

362
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:19,200
Austin, he's with Austin.

363
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,230
Shit.

364
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,370
Shit.

365
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,340
Damn coward.

366
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,500
It belongs to Gibson, is not it?

367
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:32,380
It belongs to British soldiers
Who is brave, not yours.

368
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:35,370
It is not worthy of your use.

369
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,350
He's my friend.

370
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:37,340
Maybe he killed him.

371
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:38,410
He ... he did not kill him.

372
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,350
How do we know?

373
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:42,320
How difficult is it to find a corpse
British soldiers on the beach?

374
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,420
He did not kill anyone.
He's just like all of us.

375
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,330
I think he gave
Code to them.

376
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:55,360
Try all sorts,
And I'll shoot.

377
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:56,460
This ship is still drowning.

378
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,230
Correct.

379
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,230
We must trust each other.

380
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:03,470
When we get out of here
I will interrogate you.

381
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:04,480
Hurry up.

382
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,480
Come up.

383
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:08,280
When your head comes out
We will know it.

384
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,440
Are you guys,
Or a real soldier

385
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,250
That is not fair.

386
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,280
Something to hold on
Life is never fair.

387
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,480
That's bullshit.

388
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,410
Hurry up.

389
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,480
I will not hesitate.

390
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:20,220
It represents thousands of people.

391
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,350
Shit.

392
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,490
He sent something to Lars.

393
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,230
I knew it.

394
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,460
Somebody has to get out
So we can all live.

395
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,260
Do you know what that means?

396
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:36,300
No. I do not know.

397
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,370
This is the price of lies.

398
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:46,380
I'll go with
he. This is wrong.

399
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:48,250
Hurry up.

400
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:51,360
With or without me
Will make a lot of difference.

401
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,490
Of course, if you continue to defend him
I also do not hesitate to shoot you.

402
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,260
Hurry up.

403
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,270
You are stupid.

404
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:16,440
Turn off the engine.

405
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,250
thanks.

406
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,330
Sorry, I do not understand.

407
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,340
Maybe you're not proven guilty.

408
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,410
You've done your best.

409
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,290
Stop wasting time.

410
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:12,490
I understand your frustration, colonel.

411
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:14,360
Johnny.

412
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:20,300
The ship was attacked.

413
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,430
Looks like they're gonna head over here.

414
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:27,440
Here it is.

415
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,220
What do you see?

416
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,330
Hope.

417
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,460
Is she all right?

418
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:43,310
Son?

419
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,270
No.

420
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:47,510
No. She's not all right.

421
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:00,450
Exit!

422
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:33,480
There are people at sea!

423
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:19,500
Oil.

424
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:23,510
Oil. You are all exposed to oil.

425
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,380
They keep coming.

426
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:02,470
Do not hesitate.

427
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:09,460
All right, crack your hand.

428
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,320
Leave the boat!

429
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:49,300
Leave the boat!

430
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,440
Catch him!

431
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:12,350
Do not leave him!

432
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,460
Under the deck.

433
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:05,490
Sergeant, we have to save people
As much as possible before the oil
Reach us and make us burn.

434
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:09,460
Keep up.

435
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:14,270
Be careful down there.

436
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:16,370
Be careful down there.

437
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,240
He's dead, man.

438
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,380
Then be more careful.

439
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,470
Are you okay?

440
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,470
Son?

441
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:00,440
Nice.

442
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:22,320
The plane returned.

443
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,440
The plane is back!

444
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:31,500
Come on, their opponent, come on.

445
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:48,390
The ship!

446
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:03,430
- He'll turn around and fight them.
- Come on ..

447
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,390
No!

448
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:57,290
Let's go.

449
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:03,330
Street! Street! Come on! Hurry up!

450
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:43,370
Come on.

451
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,310
Thank you very much.

452
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:47,260
Where are you from

453
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:49,500
North Dover.

454
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,310
Make a deal.

455
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:54,370
Yes, sir.

456
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:57,440
Enter the ship into the port.

457
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,310
And thanks!

458
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:49,300
- That's an enemy plane. - Yes. And that's in
South, take me there.

459
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:54,240
This is an instruction from me. Sailing to the South.

460
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,350
Now!

461
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:43,260
The plane was gone.

462
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:44,480
Yes there is a bigger fish to be fried.

463
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,290
How can you know that?

464
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:51,420
My son is often here. Me
Knew he had done it.

465
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,370
You ever come here?

466
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:59,500
No. Not me, my brother.

467
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:04,370
Hailed by the storm, died before going to war.

468
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:46,210
Please, stay below.

469
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,380
I just want to see it.

470
01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:56,260
Beautiful.

471
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,490
Beautiful.

472
01:27:58,230 --> 01:27:59,320
Is that Dover?

473
01:27:59,370 --> 01:28:02,390
No, that's Dorset.

474
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,370
It's home.

475
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:08,400
We're going to your town, huh?

476
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,210
Oh God.

477
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,310
How can you get there?

478
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,390
Where are we?

479
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:19,370
Where are we?

480
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:28,480
They know where you are.

481
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,320
Just wait.

482
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,330
Wait for friends.

483
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:09,320
Just wait.

484
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:11,320
Wait a second, guys.

485
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,330
Just wait.

486
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:17,230
All we do is survive.

487
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,530
That's enough.

488
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,340
Just wait.

489
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:30,250
Just wait.

490
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:48,230
The beggar does not even want to see our eyes.

491
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:12,480
Is there an officer here?

492
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:16,330
Any news from the enemy?

493
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:19,300
This is not the time to be special.

494
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:22,470
Just wait.

495
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:24,440
We lost 30 people.

496
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:26,440
And some others.

497
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,400
Nearly 300ribu.

498
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,400
So far.

499
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,350
So far?

500
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:39,320
I stay here.
