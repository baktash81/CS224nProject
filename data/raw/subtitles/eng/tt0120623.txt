1
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,234
No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

2
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,874
I'm lost! Where's the line?

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,036
It just went away.
What do I do? What do I do?

4
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,832
- Help!
- We'll be stuck here forever!

5
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,520
Do not panic. Do not panic!

6
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,950
We are trained professionals.
Now, stay calm.

7
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,116
We are going around the leaf.

8
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,913
A-Around the leaf?
l-l don't think we can do that.

9
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,669
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing
compared to the twig of '93.

10
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,792
That's it. That's it. Good!

11
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,993
You're doing great!
There you go. There you go!

12
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,190
Watch my eyes.
Don't look away.

13
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,074
- And here's the line again.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr Soil.

14
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,998
Good job, everybody!

15
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,395
Oh, my. There's quite a gap, Mr Soil.

16
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,671
- Shouldn't we tell the queen?
- I don't think we need
to involve the queen in this.

17
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,315
She's got enough on her plate already,
training her daughter.

18
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,115
Oh, yes. Princess Atta,
the poor dear.

19
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,710
Oh, wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.

20
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,515
- Just be confident, dear.
You'll be fine.
- There's a gap.

21
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,915
There's a gap in the line.
What are we gonna do?

22
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,828
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.
We just lost a few inches, that's all.

23
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,793
Oh. Right.

24
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,673
Your Highness, I can't count
when you hover like that.

25
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,597
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

26
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,154
Guys, go shade
someone else for a while.

27
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,271
Okay, Atta. Now what do we do?

28
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,439
Uh-- Oh! Don't tell me.
I know it. I know it. What is it?

29
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,835
- We relax.
- Right.

30
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,191
Oh, it'll be fine.
It's the same, year after year.

31
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,357
They come, they eat, they leave.
That's our lot in life.

32
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,189
It's not a lot,
but it's our life.

33
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,278
Isn't that right, Aphie?
Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.

34
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,037
- Ditch Dot!
- Yeah, yeah!

35
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,276
Hey, come back here!

36
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,037
- Dot!
- Yes, Mother.

37
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,515
What did I tell you
about trying to fly?

38
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,790
Not until my wings grow in.

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,717
- Right.
- But, Mom--

40
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,434
Dot, you're a young queen ant,
and your wings are too little to be--

41
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,916
I was talking to Mother.
You're not the queen yet, Atta.

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,395
Now, Dot,
be nice to your sister.

43
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,636
It's not my fault
she's so stressed out.

44
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,716
I know, I know.

45
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,991
- I'm always acting
like the sky is falling.
- Look out!

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,509
- Atta!
- Princess Atta! Princess Atta!
- Princess Atta!

47
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,199
- Oh!
- Hey!

48
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,675
- Stop that!
- What do you think you're doing?

49
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,872
- You could have killed
somebody over here.
- I'm sorry!

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,719
- I'm sorry!
- Oh, it's Flik.
- Oh--

51
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,831
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

52
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,030
Please forgive me.
I'm sorry!

53
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,469
- Princess Atta!
- Flik, what are you doing?

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,717
Oh! Oh, this! This is my new idea
for harvesting grain.

55
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,150
No more picking individual kernels.
You can just cut down the entire stalk!

56
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,558
- Flik, we don't have time for this.
- Exactly! We never have time
to collect food for ourselves.

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,636
Because we spend all summer
harvesting for the offering.

58
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,355
- But my invention
will speed up production.
- Oh, another invention?

59
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,198
- Yeah, and I've got
something for you too.
- Flik!

60
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
Since you're gonna be queen, you could
use this to oversee production.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,276
- Dr Flora, if I may.
- This is all very nice, but--
- What?

62
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,551
- Just an ordinary blade of grass
and a bead of dew, right?
- Flik, please.

63
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,389
Wrong! It is, in fact, a telescope.

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,513
- It's very clever, Flik, but--
- Hello, Princess! My, aren't
you looking lovely this morning!

65
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,279
Not, of course, that you would
need a telescope to see that.

66
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,039
All right, listen! The princess
doesn't have time for this!

67
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,072
You wanna help us fill this thing?
Then get rid of that machine...

68
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,397
get back in line
and pick grain like everybody else!

69
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,432
- Like everybody else!
- Please, Flik. Just go.

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,551
I'm sorry, l-l was--
I was really just trying--

71
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,437
trying to help.

72
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,793
Harvester. Why, we harvested
the same way ever since I was a pupa.

73
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,229
Where were we?

74
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,351
- The food pile, Your Highness.
- Oh, yes, yes.

75
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,994
Hey, Flik! Flik! Wait up!

76
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,432
- Oh. Hello, Princess.
- You can call me Dot.
Here, you forgot this.

77
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,120
Thanks. You can keep it.
I can make another one.

78
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,358
- I like your inventions.
- Really? Well, you're the first.

79
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,392
- I'm beginning to think
nothing I do works.
- This works.

80
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,114
Great. One success.

81
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,913
- I'm never gonna make a difference.
- Me, neither.

82
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,555
I'm a royal ant, and
I can't even fly yet. I'm too little.

83
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,433
- Oh, being little's
not such a bad thing.
- Yes, it is.

84
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,959
- No, it's not.
- Is too!

85
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,832
- Is not.
- Is too.
- Is not.
- Is too.

86
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,110
- Is not. Is not. Is not. Oh!
- Is too. Is too. Is too.

87
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,834
A seed. I need--
I need a seed. Ahh--

88
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,677
Ohh!

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,234
Ah, here, here.

90
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,510
Pretend-- pretend
that that's a seed.

91
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,631
- It's a rock.
- Oh, I know it's a rock. I know.

92
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,309
But let's just pretend for
a minute that it's a seed, all right?
We'll just use our imaginations.

93
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,237
Now-- Now, do you see our tree?

94
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,352
Everything that made
that giant tree...

95
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,597
is already contained
inside this tiny little seed.

96
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,632
All it needs is some time, a little bit
of sunshine and rain, and...

97
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,591
voila!

98
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,950
This rock will be a tree?

99
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,435
Seed to tree. You've gotta
work with me, all right? Okay.

100
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,551
You might not feel
like you can do much now...

101
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,114
but that's just because,
well, you're not a tree yet.

102
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,994
You just have to give yourself
some time. You're still a seed.

103
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,157
- But it's a rock.
- I know it's a rock!

104
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,159
Don't ya think I know
a rock when I see a rock?
I've spent a lot of time around rocks!

105
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,840
You're weird, but I like you.

106
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,633
They're here.

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,192
They're here!

108
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,278
Mom! Where are you?

109
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,918
- They're coming!
- Run!

110
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,589
- Dot! Dot!
- Mom!
- Single file!

111
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,756
- Mom!
- Thank heavens!

112
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,237
- Food to the offering stone.
- Okay, everyone, single file.

113
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,716
Food to the offering stone
and into the anthill. Now let's go!

114
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,957
Go, go, go, go!

115
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,877
Come on. Keep movin',
keep movin'! Good.

116
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,318
Okay. That's everyone.

117
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,117
Hey! Hey, wait for me!

118
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,198
Get the food to the offering stone,
then into the anthill.

119
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,511
No! No, no, no, no, no! Oh, oh!

120
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,150
Oh, no.

121
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,077
Princess Atta! Princess Atta!

122
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,429
Princess Atta!

123
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,714
They come, they eat, they leave.
They come, they eat, they leave.

124
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,149
Excuse me, pardon me.
Pardon me, excuse me.
Coming through. Excuse me. Excuse me.

125
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,669
Sorry, sorry. Coming through.
Princess Atta, there's something
I need to tell you.

126
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,588
- Not now, Flik.
- But, Your Highness,
it's about the offering!

127
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,948
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Yeah, where's the food?

128
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,113
- What did you do?
- It was an accident?

129
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,433
Boo!

130
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,553
Where's the food? Huh?

131
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,356
Hopper.

132
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,240
So, where is it?

133
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,635
Where's my food?

134
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,233
- I-l-lsn't it up there?
- What?

135
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,794
-The food was in a leaf sitting on top--
-Excuse me.

136
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,911
Are you sure it's not up there?

137
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,031
- Are you saying I'm stupid?
- No.

138
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,993
Do I look stupid to you?

139
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,317
Let's just think
about the logic, shall we?
Let's just think about it for a second.

140
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,398
If it was up there,
would I be coming down here...

141
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,273
to your level, looking for it?

142
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,675
- Uh, l--
- Why am I even talking to you?

143
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,360
You're not the queen.
You don't smell like the queen.

144
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,233
Sh-She's learning
to take over for me, Hopper.

145
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,229
Oh, I see. Under new management.
So it's your fault.

146
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,749
No, it wasn't me. It was--

147
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,749
Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership:
Everything is your fault.

148
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,429
- But-But l--
- It's a bug-eat-bug world
out there, Princess...

149
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,632
one of those circle-of-life
kind of things.

150
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,957
Now, let me tell you
how things are supposed to work.

151
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,914
The sun grows the food.
The ants pick the food.

152
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,555
- The grasshoppers eat the food--
- And the birds eat the grasshoppers.

153
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,796
Hey, like the one that nearly
ate you, you remember? You remember?

154
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,239
- Oh, you should've seen it.
- Molt.

155
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,557
This blue jay-- He has him halfway
down his throat, okay? And Hopper--
Hopper's kickin' and screamin', okay?

156
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,477
And I'm scared, okay?
I'm not goin' anywhere near, okay?

157
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,116
Aw, come on. It's a great story.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

158
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,869
I swear, if I hadn't promised
Mother on her deathbed...

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,468
that I wouldn't kill you,
I would kill you.

160
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,034
- And believe me, no one
appreciates that more than I do.
- Shut up!

161
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,628
I don't want to hear another word
out of you while we're on this island.

162
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,149
Do you understand me?

163
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,636
- I said, do you understand me?
- Well, how can I answer?
You said I couldn't say another word.

164
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,955
Remember Ma!

165
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,395
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.

166
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,988
There's still a few months
till the rains come...

167
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,317
so you can all just try again.

168
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,000
But, Hopper, since
it's almost the rainy season...

169
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,236
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves.

170
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,876
Listen, if you don't
keep your end of the bargain,
then I can't guarantee your safety.

171
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,629
And there are insects out there
that will take advantage of you.

172
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,797
Someone could get hurt.

173
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,317
What's the matter?
You scared of grasshoppers?

174
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,117
- Dot!
- You don't like Thumper?

175
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,669
Leave her alone!

176
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,875
You want her? Go ahead. Take her.

177
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,870
No? Then get back in line.

178
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,914
It seems to me that you ants
are forgetting your place.

179
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,951
So let's double
the order of food.

180
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,832
- Huh?
- No! But-But-But--

181
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,191
We'll be back
at the end of the season...

182
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,676
when the last leaf falls.

183
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,630
You ants have a nice summer.
Let's ride!

184
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,319
Flik, what do you have
to say for yourself?

185
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,034
Sorry. I-- I'm sorry
for the way I am.

186
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,310
I didn't mean for things
to go so wrong.

187
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,273
I especially didn't want
to make you look bad, Princess.

188
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,472
- Well, Flik, ya did.
- I was just trying to help.

189
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,955
Then help us-- don't help us.

190
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,789
- Help? Help? Help?
- Flik, you are sentenced
to one month digging in the tunnels.

191
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,515
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Need I remind you of Flik's
tunnel-within-a-tunnel project?

192
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,949
- Helpers to help us. That could--
That's it! That's-- We could--
- It took the whole
engineering department...

193
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,513
two days to dig him out.

194
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,108
- Send him to Health and Ant Services.
- Heavens, no!

195
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,312
We could leave the island.
The river bed's dry right now. We'd
just walk right across the river bed.

196
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,989
We could go get helpers.
We could! We could leave. Sure.
We could go find helpers to help us.

197
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,829
- It's perfect!
- Perfect? What's so perfect?

198
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,157
Your Highness, don't you see?
We could send someone to get help!

199
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,157
Leave the island?

200
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,829
Now, why didn't I think of that?
Oh! Because it's suicide!

201
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,235
-She's right! We never leave the island.
-Never leave!

202
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,590
There's snakes and birds
and bigger bugs out there!

203
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,790
Exactly! Bigger bugs!

204
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,275
We could find bigger bugs
to come here and fight...

205
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,834
and forever rid us
of Hopper and his gang!

206
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,872
- Ludicrous!
- Who would do a crazy thing like that?

207
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,594
I'll volunteer.
I'd be very happy to volunteer.

208
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,190
You got a lot of spunk, kid,
but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.

209
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,393
At least we could try. Oh, l-l could--
I could travel to the city!
I could search there!

210
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,795
If you went, you'd be
on that silly search for weeks.

211
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,757
- Royal huddle.
- Great idea, Princess. It's perfect.

212
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,233
- Exactly.
- Wait a minute.

213
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,555
- What did we just decide here?
- To let Flik leave.

214
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,353
While we keep harvesting
to meet Hopper's demands.

215
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,632
- You see, with Flik gone, he can't--
- He can't mess anything up!

216
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,350
Flik, after much deliberation, we have
decided to grant you your request.

217
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,471
- Really?
- Really?
- Uh, really.

218
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,433
Oh, thank you, Princess.
Thank you so much for this chance.

219
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,438
- I-l-l won't let you down,
I promise, I promise, I promise.
- Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.
No, forget it. Forget it.

220
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,439
- Oh, but I should probably help repair
the damage before I go, don't you think?
- No! No, no! Just go.

221
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,551
- Just go.
- Just leave!

222
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,431
Hey.

223
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,838
Don't worry!
The colony is in good hands!

224
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,076
Bye, now.

225
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,271
All right.

226
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,914
Hey, fellas.
Beautiful mornin', huh?

227
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,868
- My dad says he gives you 1 hour before
you come back to the island crying.
- Does he, now?

228
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,831
- My dad doesn't think that.
- He doesn't, huh?

229
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,838
- Naw, he's bettin' you're gonna die.
- Oh.

230
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,431
- Yeah, he says if the heat
doesn't get ya, the birds will.
- Well, I think he's gonna make it.

231
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,791
-Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
-Yeah, Dot. What do you know?

232
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,195
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up, all right? Come on.

233
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,515
She's entitled
to her opinion too.

234
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,357
Ohh.

235
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,040
So go, already.

236
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,798
- Hey!
- The city's that way.

237
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,198
- I know.
- You're supposed to look
for bugs, not dandelions.

238
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,629
You leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.

239
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,671
That's right.

240
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,715
Here I go. For the colony,
and for oppressed ants everywhere!

241
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,597
Whoa-oh.

242
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,275
- Wow!
- Hey!

243
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,437
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Bye, Flik!

244
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,391
Wow!

245
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,080
Wow. Ohh!

246
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,837
Whoa!

247
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,315
Good luck, Flik!

248
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,273
Bye! Whoa-oh!

249
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,436
Flik!

250
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,552
I'm okay!

251
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,511
- Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
- You just watch.

252
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,189
He's gonna get the bestest,
roughest bugs you've ever seen!

253
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,553
Get back! Get back!
Get back, you horrible beast!

254
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,035
I have no fear!

255
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,594
- Ooh!
- Oh, my goodness.

256
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,714
Oh, no!

257
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,274
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie?
- Owie! Owie, owie.

258
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,834
Please show Rosie the owie.
All right, Dim. It's okay.

259
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,232
I have been in outhouses
that didn't stink that bad.

260
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,920
This is ridiculous.
What a disappointment!

261
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,271
- Oh, no!
- You! Come here! I want my money back!

262
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,039
Uh, no refunds
after the first two minutes.

263
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,752
Popcorn! Stale popcorn!

264
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,678
We're losin' the audience!
You clowns get out there now!

265
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,792
- I hate performing on an empty stomach!
- Do your act, Heimlich.

266
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,911
- Then you can eat.
- P.T., what's the point?

267
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,591
- Not now, Slim.
- What's the point of going out there?
They'll only laugh at me.

268
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,599
- That's because you're a clown!
- No, it's because I'm a prop!

269
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,191
You always cast me as the broom,
the pole, the stick, a splinter.

270
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,470
You're a walking stick.
It's funny!

271
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,716
- Now go!
- You parasite.

272
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,033
Spring's in the air.

273
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,073
And I'm a flower with
nothing interesting to say. A bee!

274
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,317
I am a cute little bumblebee!

275
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,238
Here I come!

276
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,920
Slow down, you flowers!

277
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,431
Candy corn! Here. Here.
Let me help you to finish it.

278
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,473
Hey, cutie!
Wanna pollinate with a real bug?

279
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,993
Ooh, come to Papa, yeah!

280
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,557
So, bein' a ladybug automatically makes
me a girl, is that it, fly boy? Huh?

281
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,114
- She's a guy!
- Francis, leave them alone.

282
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,629
- They are poo-poo heads!
- Not again.

283
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,957
Judging by your breath, you must have
been buzzin' around a dung heap all day.

284
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,231
Come on, Francis.
You're making the maggots cry.

285
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,915
All right, we're dyin' out there.
Gypsy, quick! You and Manny--

286
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,031
He's in a trance.

287
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,472
- Well, get him out of it!
You and your husband are up now.
- Manny, we're on.

288
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,230
Oh? Yet again it is up to me
to rescue the performance.

289
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,157
Gypsy, come.

290
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,919
- The stage is the other way, dear.
- Yes, of course.

291
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,191
Anytime, pal! I'm gonna pick
the hairs out of your head one by one!

292
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,639
- Take your best shot!
- You name the place!

293
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,320
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, 'cause when
you get there, you are dead!

294
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,638
- Francis, let me handle this.
That's no way to speak to a lady.
- I heard that, you twig.

295
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,230
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me
to present Manto the Magnificent...

296
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,115
and his lovely assistant, Gypsy!

297
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,633
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia...

298
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,070
I give you the Chinese Cabinet...

299
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,909
of Metamorphosis!

300
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,190
Rosie, whole troupe.
On stage! Finale! Now!

301
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,151
- O-Okay, I just need a little time to--
- Now!

302
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,113
Coming. Coming. Tuck, Roll,
let's get moving, guys. We're up next.

303
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,755
Don't you understand?
We are up!

304
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,235
"Up-a."

305
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,396
- Hey!
- Hey! They don't understand me.

306
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,556
I summon the voice of Confucius--

307
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,069
Get off the stage, you old hack!

308
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,158
I demand to know who said that!

309
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,477
How dare you!

310
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,198
Ingrates!

311
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,193
Manny? Manny!

312
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,279
I only got 24 hours to live,
and I ain't gonna waste it here.

313
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,197
Come on.

314
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,756
I've just about had it
with these losers!

315
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,871
Flaming death!

316
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,995
I hold in my hand the match--

317
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,238
the match that decides whether
two bugs live or die this very evening.

318
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,989
In a moment, I will light
this trail of matches...

319
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,511
Ieading to a sheet of flypaper
dowsed in lighter fluid!

320
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,997
Aimed directly at the flypaper
are Tuck and Roll...

321
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,429
the pill bug cannonballs!

322
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,599
The cannon will be triggered
by Dim, trained to jump
at the sound of this bell...

323
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,757
set to go off in 15 seconds.

324
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,395
Our pill bugs' only hope
of survival is...

325
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,273
our mistress of the high wire, Rosie!

326
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,755
Secured to a web line
of exact length...

327
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,792
Rosie will plummet down
to these two posts...

328
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,230
spinning a web of safety
in less than 15 seconds!

329
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,036
Not good enough, you say?
Well, what if they were all...

330
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,957
blindfolded!

331
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,230
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I suggest that those of you...

332
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,238
with weak constitutions
leave the arena...

333
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,954
for this act is so dangerous...

334
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,355
that if the slightest thing
should go wrong--

335
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,517
- No!
- Go? Okay, through the tunnel--

336
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,674
Whoa!

337
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,918
- Okay, that's done!
- Whoa!

338
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,433
- P.T.!
- Oh, no!

339
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,028
Rosie!

340
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,430
- We need some water!
- Water, water, water, water, water!

341
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,993
Get me outta here!

342
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,274
Wow!

343
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,549
- It's the web. I'm sorry. It's--
- You're all fired.

344
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,797
- We got the water!
- Here we come, P.T.!
- We'll save you.

345
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,753
Whoa! Burn 'im again!

346
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,795
No, Harry, no!
Don't look at the light!

347
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,515
I can't help it!
It's so beautiful!

348
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,276
Try not to look like a country bug.

349
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,039
Blend-- blend in.

350
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,878
Hey, buggy!

351
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,195
What do you expect?
The guy's a tick.

352
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,953
Wow! The city!

353
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,437
Wow!

354
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,555
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa!

355
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,434
Making all stops to the septic tank,
including standing water...

356
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,074
empty bean can and dead rat.

357
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,237
- Watch your stingers. All aboard!
- Whoa!
- Hey, watch it.

358
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,316
- Hey!
- Get out of the way!
- Oh, sorry.

359
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,874
- Watch where you're goin'!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't mean--

360
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,434
Oh, sorry!

361
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,028
Oh. I'm really, really sorry.

362
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,469
That was an-an-an ac-ac-accident.

363
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,000
- Hey, let go of me!
- I'll show ya who's tough!

364
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,033
- And stay out!
- Tough bugs!

365
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,639
- I knew an old lady
who swallowed a fly--
- Wow!

366
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,557
- Move it!
- Whoa!

367
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,514
Hey, waiter! I'm in my soup!

368
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,915
I've been workin' out.
Feel my wing.

369
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,429
Yo! Two Black Flags over here!

370
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,230
- All right.
- Hair of the dog you bit.

371
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,715
Hey, who ordered
the poo-poo platter?

372
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,236
Here ya go, slick. Enjoy.

373
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,192
Hey, I said no salt!

374
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,914
- Buzz off!
- Oh, pardon me, sir. I-l was wondering
if I could talk to you for a moment.

375
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,712
I represent a colony of-of ants,

376
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,513
and I'm looking-- I'm looking
for tough bugs, you know,
mean bugs, the sort of bugs--

377
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,473
Fired by a flea--
how humiliating!

378
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,397
Let's face it: We stink.

379
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,317
- You fired!
- You fired!
- You fired!

380
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,876
- Oh, will you shut up?
- Hey!
- You fired!

381
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,833
Someday I will be
a beautiful butterfly...

382
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,155
and then everything will be better.

383
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,159
I can't believe the troupe is
breaking up. We've always been together.

384
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,193
- Farewell, my friends.
- To the audience we'll never have.

385
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,992
Francis! Your boyfriends
from the circus are here!

386
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,228
There she is.

387
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,431
- Hello there, girlie bug.
- Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.

388
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,472
Say, why don't you
tell our pal, Thud...

389
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,716
- what you said to us at the circus.
- Yeah.

390
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,230
Somethin' about buzzin'
around a dung heap?

391
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,272
Uh, excuse me. Hi. I represent
an ant colony, and we're--

392
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,756
Hey, bartender!
Bloody Mary, O-positive.

393
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,677
Aha!

394
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,877
Sir?

395
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,834
Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home

396
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,155
Not so tough now, are you?

397
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,236
All right, clown.
Get up and fight like a girl.

398
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,670
- Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
- I want to be Little John!

399
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,270
- What part can I play?
- You see, I'm looking
for tough, warrior bugs.

400
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,518
Stand back, ye flies! We are
the greatest warriors in all bugdom!

401
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,313
- Warrior bugs!
- My sword!

402
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,237
Swish, swish. Clang, clang.

403
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,157
- Little John?
- What ho, Robin?

404
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,714
Justice is my sword
and truth shall be my quiver!

405
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,832
Wait, wait! No, no!
I want to watch this!

406
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,075
Thrust, parry, lunge!

407
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,350
Me thinketh it's not working!

408
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,710
Back to Sherwood Forest!

409
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,638
What's going on in there?

410
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,708
Help! Help! Get me out!

411
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,918
Wow.

412
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,271
- Oh, ow-ow-ow-ow.
- You're perfect!

413
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,394
Oh, great ones! I have been scouting
for bugs with your exact talents!

414
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,273
- A talent scout.
- My colony's in trouble.

415
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,075
Grasshoppers are coming! We've been
forced to prepare all this food.

416
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,156
- Dinner theatre!
- Food?

417
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,192
Please! Will you help us?

418
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,517
Where are they?

419
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,394
- We'll take the job!
- Really?
- Yes, yes, yes!

420
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,795
You can explain
the details on the way.

421
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,229
Hey!

422
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,670
- Okay, come on, everyone. Break a leg!
- Whoa, you're vicious!

423
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,597
Hold on, Mr Ant.

424
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,589
Amazing! This is too good to be true!

425
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,873
So, you see, it was my fault
that Hopper's coming back.

426
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,037
But then, Princess Atta--
boy, is she one in a million--

427
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,957
she let me go out and find you.

428
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,752
And after seeing you
fight off those flies--

429
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,475
Boy, are those grasshoppers in
for a big surprise!

430
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,918
- Dr Flora!
- Oh, dear. Not another one.

431
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,871
- This is insane.
- Insane.

432
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,230
There's just not enough food
left on the island!

433
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,794
No way we can make double quota
before Hopper comes.

434
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,708
Well, we have to try, Thorny.
We don't have any choice.

435
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,637
Yeah, I know.

436
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,109
Hey, look who's playing
lookout again-- Iittle Speck!

437
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,358
-The name is Dot.
-Well, Spot, you still lookin' for Flik?

438
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,517
Forget it, Dot.
That loser's never coming back.

439
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,831
Flik! He did it! He did it!

440
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,633
What? Quit shoving!

441
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,315
This is it!
This is Ant lsland!

442
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,069
Flik! Over here! Flik! Flik!

443
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,351
- Hey!
- He did it! He did it! He did it! Yea!

444
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,711
- He did it!
- Cool!

445
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,116
At the rate these leaves are dropping,
we're gonna need a miracle.

446
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,310
That's right!
We need a miracle!

447
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,830
Run for your lives!

448
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,750
Ta-da!

449
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,239
Once again,
our reputation precedes us.

450
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,715
Hey, everybody! Hey! I'm back!

451
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,153
Hey, guys! Hey-ey!
Look-look-look who's here with me!

452
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,035
Flik! Flik! Flik!
You're back! I knew you could do it!

453
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,674
- Flik?
- It's Flik!
- What?

454
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,314
- Yeah.
- No, it's not Flik.

455
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,596
- Flik has returned!
- He's back?

456
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,790
And he's accompanied
by savage insects!

457
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,313
What? How? He wasn't supposed
to actually find someone!

458
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,715
Oh, look at this. Look at this.
This is great. Look.

459
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,115
- Oh, my ticker!
- So, what are you supposed to be?

460
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,595
He's a stick, stupid.
You hit bugs with him.

461
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,439
- Well, that's an oversimplification.
- That's right, kids. Like this!

462
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,357
No! Put me down! Ow!

463
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,517
- Hey!
- My, you just pop
right open there, don't ya?

464
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,757
- Ooh! Wow!
- Uh-oh. Kids, he's kinda ticklish.

465
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,314
Let's come on out. Careful.

466
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,155
Well, my boy, you came through.

467
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,113
Aphie and I are very impressed.

468
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,995
Princess Atta! Hey!
Hey, guys, this is Princess Atta!
She's the one that sent me to find you!

469
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,113
- Atta, Atta! Did you see
that really big bug over there?
- He looks absolutely ferocious!

470
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,710
- They're our ticket out of this mess!
- They came just in time!
- That's right!

471
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,877
So, Princess Atta, what--
what do you think?

472
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,798
No-no-no-no, wait!
This was not supposed to happen.

473
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,191
Mayday, Mayday.
We're losin' the job.

474
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,117
We don't fight grasshoppers.

475
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,913
- We don't, but they will.
- Bingo!

476
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,474
We gotta sweeten the deal.

477
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,598
Your Majesty,
ladies and gentlemen...

478
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,280
boys and girls of all ages...

479
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,915
our troupe here guarantees
a performance like no other!

480
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,838
Why, when your grasshopper friends
get here, we are gonna...

481
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,599
knock them dead!

482
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,920
Boy, these folks are sure
hard up for entertainment.

483
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,557
Come on, come on. Hurry!

484
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,313
Wow!

485
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,509
Honey, relax.
You should be proud of yourself.

486
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,315
Your instincts on that boy
were right on the money.

487
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,236
And to make our official
welcome complete-- Mr Soil?

488
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,193
- Yes, Your Highness?
- He's our resident thespian.

489
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,869
Last year he played the lead in Picnic.

490
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,788
The children-- and myself--
have quickly put together...

491
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,754
a little presentation
in honour of our guests.

492
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,519
Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub?

493
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,756
Oh, aren't they adorable!
Ooh, they're cute!

494
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,398
The South Tunnel Elementary
School second grade class...

495
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,911
would like to present you with this,
a mural we have drawn...

496
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,715
of you bugs helping us fight
the grasshoppers away.

497
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,958
Oh, look at the beautiful
colours of the blood.

498
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,436
We drew one of you dying because our
teacher said it would be more dramatic.

499
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,076
I tell you a tale of heroes so bold...

500
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,954
who vanquished
our grasshopper enemies of old.

501
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,235
Look, the last leaf has fallen.

502
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,432
We are the grasshoppers!
Where's our food?

503
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,472
Who will come to save us poor ants?

504
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,433
We are the warriors,
here to defend you!

505
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,599
I die! Die! Die!

506
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,792
Hail, the bugs!

507
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,992
Thank you, thank you!
Oh, thank you!

508
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,714
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I say we go.

509
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,479
- Okay, honey. You're up.
- Oh. Um--

510
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,876
- Oh, oh, l-l--
- We're all very,
very grateful to have...

511
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,798
- Here, here.
- the warriors--

512
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,478
Thanks.

513
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,878
First of all, I'd like to thank the
warriors for helping us in our fight...

514
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,150
against the grasshoppers.

515
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,909
Secondly, I would like
to thank Flik...

516
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,474
- for his forthright thinking--
- Thank you, Your Highness.

517
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,593
Oh, sure, I'd like
to take credit for all of this,
but, well, that wouldn't be right.

518
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,393
Because it was you, Princess Atta.
You believed in me,

519
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,954
- and you sent me on my quest.
- You tell that ant that we need
to talk to him right now.

520
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,548
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Now, I know that
I've made mistakes in the past.
- Go!

521
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,318
- And l-- And I hope
that this will make up--
- Flik!

522
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,351
Not right now, Rosie.
I-l'm making a speech.

523
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,519
Now, I truly believe that these bugs
are the answer to our--

524
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,792
No, there's no circus
around here. So, l--

525
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,959
Your Highness, the warriors
have called for a secret meeting
to plan for a circus--

526
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,834
uh, circumventing the oncoming hordes so
they can trapeze-- trap them with ease!

527
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,235
- Shouldn't I come too?
- No!

528
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,639
Sorry, no, no, you see, it's classified
in the D.M.Z. Gotta go A.S.A.P.
You know, strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye!

529
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,149
Sorry. Sorry I have to take
the warriors away so early...

530
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,353
but you know, uh, they have a--
they have a lot to get done,
with the battle looming and all.

531
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,710
So, uh, please,
everyone enjoy the party.

532
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,354
"B.Y.O.B."?

533
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,789
Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.

534
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,195
Okay, just-- just--
just get in there. Go!

535
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,709
Go, go, go!

536
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,749
Circus bugs?
How can you be circus bugs?

537
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,154
- What?
- Oh--
- Hey, hey, hey.

538
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,431
You said nothin' about killin'
grasshoppers, pal. You lied to us!

539
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,437
Are you kidding?
Do you know what this is?

540
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,835
This, my friends,
is false advertising.

541
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,875
How dare you! You, sir,
are the charlatan in this scenario--

542
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,116
touting your wares
as a talent scout...

543
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,834
preying upon the hungry souls
of hapless artistes.

544
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,757
Good day to you, sir.

545
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,999
Wait! No, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! You can't go.

546
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,635
You have got to help me. Give me
some time. I'll come up with a plan.

547
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,958
- Just go tell them the truth!
- They can't-- They can't know
the truth. The truth, you see, is bad.

548
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,834
I will be branded with this mistake
for the rest of my life. My children's
children will walk down the street...

549
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,750
and people will point
and say, "Look! There goes
the spawn of Flik, the loser!"

550
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,429
Oh-- oh, oh, you know, all right, fine.
Yeah, okay. Just go.

551
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,994
But if you could just do me
a little favour before you leave.

552
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,715
Um, if you could squish me,
that would be great, because, uh...

553
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,637
when they find out,
I'm as good as dead.

554
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,671
Flik!

555
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,839
I really do think I should
be part of this meeting. Flik!

556
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,713
Princess Atta!
What a nice surprise.

557
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,719
Just what exactly is going on?
I would like to speak
with the so-called "warriors."

558
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,434
You can't! I mean,
they are in the middle of
a top secret meeting right now...

559
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,357
and they really should not
be disturbed now.

560
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,436
Right, guys?

561
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,030
Could you ex-- pl-- Could you excuse--
Uh, could you excuse me, please?

562
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,948
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Please, don't go!
- I'm not going anywhere.

563
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,992
What is going on? Flik?

564
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,829
Flik! Ooh, I knew it!

565
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,794
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Please! Don't go!

566
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,954
- No!
- Quick, he's losin' it!
- No, no, no, no!

567
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,629
- You can't go! I'm desperate!
- Really? I couldn't tell.

568
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,832
Hmm. Come on, wings.

569
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,228
Help!

570
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,352
Mother, Flik is up to something.

571
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,119
- No! No!
- Okay, Flik, time to put ya down now.

572
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,117
- Get him off me! He's cutting off
the circulation to my foot.
- No, no!

573
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,958
- No, no, no, no!
- Let go!

574
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,073
- Oh, please! Please! Don't go!
- Put the stick down.
Flik, I mean it, now.

575
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,795
- Drop the stick. Drop it.
- Run!

576
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,231
Boy, he runs fast for a little guy.

577
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,799
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!

578
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,599
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!
Tweet-tweet!

579
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,069
This way.

580
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,239
There they are.

581
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,477
- A bird!
- Flik!

582
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,589
- Look!
- Dot!

583
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,791
Flik!

584
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,354
- Dot!
- My baby!

585
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,512
Huh? I gotcha! I gotcha!

586
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,518
I gotcha, I gotcha!

587
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,872
- I can't see!
- Somebody do something!

588
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,309
- Are they all right?
- Can anyone see? Are they alive?

589
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,998
- I can't see!
- What is happening?

590
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,599
- Dot?
- Good heavens, they're in trouble!

591
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,792
- Francis, Francis, Francis,
Francis, Francis, Francis--
- Oh, you guys, I've got an idea!

592
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,672
Here! I've got it!

593
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,949
Please, ma'am, wake up! Wake up!

594
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,879
- Help! Help!
- Yoo-hoo!

595
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,994
Mr Early Bird! How about
a nice, tasty worm on a stick?

596
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,680
I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.

597
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,792
Nice and juicy, succulent--

598
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,990
Let's go!

599
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,070
- There they are!
- Flik! Help!

600
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,078
Okay.

601
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,509
- Flik!
- It's going to be okay, Dot.

602
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,279
Bye-bye, birdie!

603
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,554
Help! I'm stuck!
Pull me down!

604
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,113
- The caterpillar's
using himself as live bait!
- How brave!

605
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,072
Suck it in, man!

606
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,478
Ow. My leg!

607
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,551
The bird! The bird!
Look out for the bird!

608
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,159
Flik!

609
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,637
Up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a!

610
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,678
What is that?

611
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,794
That, my friends,
is the sound of applause!

612
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,034
Applause-- I'm in heaven!

613
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,554
Our Blueberry troop salutes
you bugs for rescuing our
smallest member, Princess Dot.

614
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,070
And as a tribute to Miss Francis,
we've changed our bandannas!

615
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,556
We voted you
our honorary den mother!

616
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,838
What? Great.

617
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,555
All right, girls. Let's move
your little keisters outta here now.

618
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,194
The patient needs her rest,
you know. Come on.

619
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,914
Oh, excuse me, Flik.
Can I talk to you just for a second?

620
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,917
- Huh? Oh, sure.
- Oww!

621
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,919
Again, uh, thank you all,
very, very much.

622
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,871
- Oh, stop it.
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.

623
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,270
- You don't think I've offended
the warriors, do you?
- You? No.

624
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,516
Oh, good. Because, you see...

625
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,598
when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.

626
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,836
Ya did?

627
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,988
Don't tell 'em I said that.
Boy, that's all I'd need,
another royal blunder like that.

628
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,430
- Princess, you're doin' a great job.
- Thanks. You're sweet.

629
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,994
You're wrong but sweet.

630
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,588
- I know what everyone really thinks.
- I don't follow you.

631
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,919
Everyone-- the whole colony. Nobody
really believes I can do this job.

632
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,554
It's like they're all watching me...

633
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,719
- just, just--
- Waiting for you to screw up.

634
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,992
- Flik, I owe you an apology.
- For what?

635
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,829
Well, I haven't been
that nice to you, and I'm sorry.

636
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,758
If there's any way I can
make it up to you-- Hey! I know!

637
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,759
How would you like to be the queen's
official aide to the warrior bugs?

638
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,111
- Me?
- Oh, sure. You've got
a great rapport going with them...

639
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,437
especially after that rescue--
it was very brave.

640
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,757
- Really? Naw, naw--
- Well, not every bug would face a bird.

641
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,316
- I mean, even Hopper's afraid of 'em.
- Yeah, well, I guess maybe I have--

642
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,989
- Say that again?
- I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.

643
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,077
Thank you.

644
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,195
- Hopper's afraid of birds!
- And I don't blame 'im!

645
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,958
Oh, oh, oh,
this is perfect.

646
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,674
We can get rid of Hopper,
and no one has to know that I messed up.

647
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,438
You just keep pretending
you're warriors.

648
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,394
Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not
about to fight grasshoppers, okay?

649
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,830
You'll be gone before
the grasshoppers ever arrive.
It'll be easy. Here's what we do.

650
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,398
Not another word.
I don't know what you're concocting
in that little ant brain of yours...

651
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,317
but we'll have no part of it.

652
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,273
Excuse me? Could we get
the warriors' autographs?

653
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,197
Autographs?

654
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,596
- Oh, wow! Great!
- So, you fellas catch the action today?

655
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,631
Oh! The bird went--
and it just missed you!

656
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,435
- Oh, aren't you sweet?
- And the way you pretended
to be stuck in that huge crack!

657
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,233
- Oh, that's just all part of the plan.
- Yeah, yeah.

658
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,351
And then you dive-bombed
into the bush!

659
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,677
- There you go, my boy.
- Wow! Thanks!

660
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,631
"M-M-Maa-jor--"

661
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,751
That's Major Manny, young cadet.

662
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,111
-I outrank everyone here. Remember that.
-Yes, sir!

663
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,151
- Dismissed!
- Wow!

664
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,352
- When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a praying mantis!
- I'm gonna be a stick bug!

665
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,550
Oh, they're all so cool,
I can't pick!

666
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,629
Delightful lads.
You were saying, Flik?

667
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,718
All right.
We are going to build a bird--

668
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,276
a bird that we can operate
from the inside, which would then
be hoisted above our anthill--

669
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,632
Hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree.

670
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,558
Then, right when Hopper
and his gang are below...

671
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,389
we'll launch the bird and
scare off the grasshoppers.

672
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,873
Now it's going to take--

673
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,515
Everyone's involvement
to make this plan a reality.

674
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,552
I know it's not our tradition
to do things differently...

675
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,990
but if our ancestors were able
to build this anthill...

676
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,352
we can certainly rally together
to build this bird!

677
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,396
- Perfect!
- Okay, hit your marks!

678
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,554
- Whoa!
- Whee-hee!

679
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,869
- Hi, Flik.
- Oh.

680
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,630
- Do you mind passing the sugar crumbs?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

681
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,751
- I love what you did with your antenna.
- Oh, thank you.

682
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,678
Oh, look.
She's a natural mother.

683
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,872
All right, that's it!
Out! Out! Everybody out!

684
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,159
Okay, now you're gonna cry, right?
You're gonna cry. See if I care.
Go ahead and cry. Go ahead.

685
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,353
Please, don't cry. Please. Huh?

686
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,348
- Ta-da!
- Yea, Francis! Yea!

687
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,278
Okay, lower, lower--

688
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,198
- You got it. And that's it!
- Whoa!

689
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,154
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

690
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,635
Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the
barn, two by two by, there's the yarn.

691
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,513
- Done!
- Ruben Kincaid!

692
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,916
- Hey!
- Good job, guys! Nice work!

693
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,598
Up, down. Up, down. Up, down.

694
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,990
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

695
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,073
- Read 'em and weep.
- Huh?

696
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,437
Whoo-whee! Ya-hoo!

697
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,471
- Flik, watch out!
- Whoa!

698
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,672
Look! I'm a beautiful butterfly!

699
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,879
There ya go. Good job, fellas.
Keep up the good work.

700
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,596
Huh?

701
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,630
Okay!

702
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,952
You're fired!

703
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,077
Yes!

704
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,711
Whoo-hoo! Look at me!
I'm barefootin'! Whoo-hoo!

705
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,274
Yo, bugito, dos granitos, pronto!

706
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,311
You gotta try this, man!

707
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,478
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

708
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,234
We have more than enough food.

709
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,797
We go all the way back there
and it starts to rain, we might
as well be suckin' bug spray.

710
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,275
Ooh, don't even say that!
You know somethin'?

711
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,709
You're makin' a lot of sense.
I mean, why take the risk?

712
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,673
- You should tell Hopper.
- Good idea.

713
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,268
But, you know,
it's really not our place.

714
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,472
I mean, you're his brother.
That makes you, like, uh...

715
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,591
the vice president of the gang.

716
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,280
Wow! It kinda does, doesn't it?

717
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,472
Okay, I'll tell 'im. Boy,
I should talk to you guys more often.

718
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,275
- What if Hopper doesn't like it?
- Then at least the genius
will get smacked and not us.

719
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,994
Vice President Molt.

720
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,078
Ooh, yeah, that's good.
Oh, that's good.

721
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,954
-Ooh, a little lower. Ahh, lower, lower.
-Hey ya, Hop.

722
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,719
- Go away.
- That's fine.
Then I won't tell ya my idea.

723
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,831
- Good!
- Okay, okay. I'll tell ya anyway.

724
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,838
You see, I've been thinkin', okay,
which is somethin' that I do, you know,
bein' vice president and all.

725
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,557
And this is a thought. And it was mine.
Why go back to Ant lsland at all?
I mean, you don't even like grain.

726
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,069
- What?
- You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

727
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,668
Actually, it wasn't even my idea.
It was Axle and Loco's!

728
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,268
They talked fancy to me.
I got confused!

729
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,030
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

730
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,270
Guys, order another round...

731
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,834
because we're stayin' here!

732
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,951
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

733
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,278
What was I thinking?
Going back to Ant lsland.

734
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,393
I mean, we just got here, and
we have more than enough food
to get us through the winter.

735
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,397
Right?
Why go back?

736
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,558
But there was that ant
that stood up to me.

737
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,196
- Yeah, but we can forget about him!
- Yeah, it was just one ant.

738
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,311
One ant!

739
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,319
Yeah, you're right!
It's just one ant!

740
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,035
- Yeah, boss. They're puny!
- Hmm, puny.

741
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,393
Say, let's pretend this grain
is a puny little ant.

742
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,397
- Did that hurt?
- Nope.

743
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,751
- Well, how 'bout this one?
- Are you kiddin'?

744
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,950
Well, how 'bout this?

745
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,429
You let one ant stand up to us...

746
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,393
then they all might stand up.

747
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,275
Those puny little ants
outnumber us 100 to one.

748
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,076
And if they ever figure that out,
there goes our way of life!

749
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,433
It's not about food.
It's about keeping those ants in line.

750
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,313
That's why we're going back!

751
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,476
Does anybody else wanna stay?

752
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,633
He's quite the motivational
speaker, isn't he?

753
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,355
Let's ride!

754
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,390
- To the bird!
- The bird!

755
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,357
Hey!

756
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,277
- Hey!
- Whoo-hoo!

757
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,197
Hey!

758
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,470
- Hey!
- Whoo!

759
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,477
Get down, roly boys!

760
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,512
- How low can you go? Sing it now.
- How low can you go

761
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,676
Do it, Princess.
How low can you go

762
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,030
And that's how
my 12th husband died.

763
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,628
So, now I'm a widow. I mean,
I've always been a black widow...

764
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,070
but now I'm
a black widow widow.

765
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,638
- Thorny! Any sign of those fiends?
- Let me check.

766
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,354
No, not yet.
But we'll be ready for 'em.

767
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,119
Blueberries, dismissed!

768
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,038
And, uh, quit beatin' the boys up.

769
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,349
Those little raisins
do grow on ya.

770
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,436
Hey, how you guys doin'?
Some party, huh?

771
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,358
Is that grain dip fresh
or what? Okay.

772
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,550
I've told everyone you'll be
stationed deep in the command bunker.

773
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,956
Party quiets down,
I sneak you out the back way
and then you're outta here forever.

774
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,832
Dim don't wanna go.

775
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,430
Well, if Dim stays he's gonna
need me here. He's not fully trained.

776
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,437
I mean, house-trained.

777
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,599
I, uh, I kinda promised
the Blueberries I'd teach 'em canasta.

778
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,395
It seems we've been booked
for an extended engagement.

779
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,399
Will you look at this colony?
Will you just look at this colony?

780
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,829
I don't even recognize it.

781
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,837
I feel 70 again!

782
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,953
Work that ab, baby!

783
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,390
And I have you bugs to thank for it.
So-- thank you!

784
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,432
And, uh, thank you
for findin' 'em, Flik.

785
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,551
- Me?
- Oops.
- Oh, ooh-- uh, uh, I'll get it.

786
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,557
I mean, if you don't mind,
I'll just, I'll just--

787
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,477
It's all tangled up.

788
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,636
- There.
- Ow!

789
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,830
I think I'll go
check on the bird.

790
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,674
- Bird's this way.
- Yeah, the bird's that way.

791
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,711
She-- What?

792
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,754
Jiminy H. Cricket!

793
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,315
They're back!
Get ready, everybody!

794
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,749
Get to your posts!

795
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,599
Battle stations, everyone.
This is not a drill!

796
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,236
Come on, everyone. You know your jobs!
Let's go, go, go, go!

797
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,673
Look out!

798
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,189
Whoa, whoa, whoa there.
Steady, girls. That's it.

799
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,550
- It's P.T.
- P.T.?

800
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,992
Greetings and salutations!
Ooh-boppa-doo and how do you do?

801
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,238
I am the great P.T. Flea!

802
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,397
I'm in need of your assis--
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.

803
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,671
Look, I've been goin'
from anthill to anthill.

804
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,157
I'm lookin' for a bunch of
circus performers. Have you seen 'em?

805
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,674
- Wait a second.
Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim?
- Nope! No, no, no.

806
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,394
- I'm sorry, no, but, uh, no one has
seen anyone like that around here.
- Be quiet!

807
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,636
- No one has ever seen anyone
like that around here.
- Hey!

808
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,637
So, you'll probably--
you'll probably want to get goin'.

809
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,548
I guess you got a lot of other
anthills to check into, so, bye!

810
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:41,276
Ah, guys, I've been lookin'
all over for ya!
Flaming Death is a huge hit!

811
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,630
- P.T.! Sh--
- I'm serious! Word of mouth got around.
- P.T.! No!

812
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,228
The next day, there was a line of
flies outside the tent went on forever!

813
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,271
- It must have been a foot long!
- P.T., no!

814
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,359
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me
twice a night, I take a day off to heal.

815
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,357
And then we do it
all over again!

816
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,438
We'll be the top circus act
in the business!

817
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,358
- You mean, you're not warriors?
- Are you kiddin'?

818
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,268
These guys are the lousiest
circus bugs you've ever seen.

819
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,675
And they're gonna make me rich!

820
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,678
You mean to tell me that
our entire defensive strategy...

821
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,030
was concocted by clowns?

822
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,196
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought
Flik's idea was gonna work.

823
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,712
- Oops.
- Tell me this isn't true.

824
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,559
- No, you don't-- You don't--
- This couldn't have happened
at a more inopportune time!

825
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,557
The last leaf is about to fall!

826
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,796
We haven't collected any food
for the grasshoppers!

827
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,036
If Hopper finds out
what we almost did--

828
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,072
Hopper is not going to find out.

829
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,476
We're going to hide all this
and pretend it never happened.

830
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,275
You bugs were never here.
So I suggest you all leave.

831
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,834
But the bird!
The-The-The bird will work.

832
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,953
I never thought I'd see the day
when an ant would put himself...

833
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,958
- before the rest of his colony.
- What?

834
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,436
- The point is, Flik, you lied to us.
- No, no, no! l-l just--

835
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,154
You lied, Flik.
You lied to her.

836
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,670
You lied to the colony!
You lied to me!

837
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,870
And like an idiot,
I believed you.

838
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,468
But l-l was just afraid that...

839
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:09,549
if you knew
I'd gotten circus bugs--

840
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,629
- I just wanted to make a difference.
- I want you to leave, Flik.

841
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,228
And this time,
don't come back.

842
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,478
Tough crowd. Yee-haw!

843
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,797
Flik!

844
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,399
That's it? But there's got to be
more food on the island!

845
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,397
If we give up any more,
we'll starve.

846
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,829
Hopper won't accept this!

847
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,710
Mother, it's not enough.
What do we do?

848
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,717
I-l don't know.

849
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,076
You little termites!

850
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,829
I give you a second chance,
and this is all I get?

851
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,910
But, Hopper, we ran out of time!

852
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,589
Have you been playing all summer?
You think this is a game?

853
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,917
- No, no, please!
- Well, guess what!

854
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,917
You just lost.

855
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,710
Not one ant sleeps until we get
every scrap of food...

856
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,070
on this island!

857
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,998
Just do what he says. You don't want
to make him mad. Believe me!

858
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,349
No, no, no.
You're staying with me, Your Highness.

859
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,993
Where do you think you're going?
Get over there!

860
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,118
Quick! To the clubhouse.

861
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,517
Hurry!

862
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,633
- Shut up a minute, will ya?
- I think I heard something over here.

863
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,876
- Have you checked over there?
- No, not yet.

864
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,878
Well then, get over there
and check it out!

865
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,956
Wait a minute.

866
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,152
Hey, I think I found something.

867
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,196
- Cool. Hey, how do I look?
- Like an idiot.

868
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,356
I don't know, maybe it'll
keep me dry in the rain.

869
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,278
You moron, we'll be out of here
before it rains.

870
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,153
Didn't you hear Hopper?
After the ants pick all the food...

871
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,430
he's gonna squish the queen
to remind 'em who's boss.

872
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,189
Then she's dead. They cry-- boo-hoo.
We go home. End of story.

873
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,949
Oh! Cool.
I love our job.

874
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,230
Stay here.
I'm gonna get help.

875
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,715
Come on, wings, fly. Fly!

876
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,110
Yeah! Whoa-oh!

877
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,471
I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich
I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich

878
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,070
I'm gonna be
the richest flea in the land

879
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,875
The streets'll be paved
with golden retrievers

880
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,150
I'm rich, rich, rich
That's who I am

881
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,432
- Poor fellow.
- Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit.

882
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,752
Don't worry, Flik.
The circus life isn't so bad.

883
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,553
- Yes, you can be part of our act.
- Here! Like this.

884
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,790
Slapstick! Get it?

885
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,471
I-l'm a walking stick.
Oh, never mind.

886
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,875
- Flik!
- Dot?

887
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,877
Flik, wait! Wait!

888
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,958
Dot, you're flying!
What are you doing here?

889
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,275
You have to go back.

890
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,995
Hopper moved into the anthill,
and his gang's eating everything!

891
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,997
- Oh!
- Oh, no!
- Good heavens!

892
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,315
And I heard a grasshopper say
that when they're finished...

893
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,396
Hopper's gonna squish my mom!

894
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,353
- Oh, not the queen!
- We gotta do something!
- How?

895
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,119
- Come on, you guys, think!
- I know. The bird.

896
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,151
- Yes, of course.
- The bird! That's brilliant.

897
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,999
The bird won't work.

898
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,953
- What are you talking about?
It was your idea.
- But you said that everything--

899
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,390
Forget everything I ever told you.
All right, Dot?

900
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,671
Let's face it. The colony is right.
I just make things worse.

901
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,954
That bird is a guaranteed failure.
Just like me.

902
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,834
You listen to me, my boy. I've made
a living out of being a failure.

903
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,520
And you, sir,
are not a failure!

904
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,438
- Oh, but Flik, you've done
so many good things.
- Oh, yeah?

905
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,437
Okay, show me one thing
I've done right.

906
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,869
Umm--

907
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,036
- Us.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

908
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,232
Dim is right, my boy.
You have rekindled...

909
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,477
the long-dormant embers
of purpose in our lives.

910
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,354
And if it wasn't for you,
Francis would have never gotten
in touch with his feminine side.

911
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,314
Oh yeah? Well-- Hmm.
You know what? He's right.

912
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,874
Lieutenant Gypsy
reporting for duty.

913
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,278
- Kid, say the word and we'll
follow you into battle.
- We believe in you, my boy.

914
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,709
Flik, please?

915
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,396
Pretend it's a seed, okay?

916
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,794
Thanks, Dot.

917
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,355
- Hey, what's with the rock?
- Must be an ant thing.

918
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,075
- All right, let's do it.
- That's the Flik we know and love.

919
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,077
- We're on!
- So, what do we do first?

920
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,473
Bugs will pay big bucks to see

921
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,751
A bonfire that is starring me

922
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,270
- P.T., look. Money!
- Where? Where?

923
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:14,749
All right. Get movin'! Get goin'.
Move your abdomens, now!

924
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,757
They're rounding everyone up.

925
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:23,435
- Hey! Turn your butt off.
- Hey, guys! Get me
out of this thing, will ya?

926
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,437
I promise to start thinkin'
about payin' ya.

927
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,120
Hey! Wait, wait!
Okay, I'll pay ya! I'll pay ya!

928
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,473
Oh, no! They've finished collecting the
food. We've got to get the queen now.

929
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,068
Once she's safe,
we move on Gypsy's signal.

930
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,272
Someone's coming!

931
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,597
Hello, kids!
Ready to make some grasshoppers cry?

932
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,156
It's payback time,
Blueberry-style.

933
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,078
- Blueberries rock!
- Yea!
- All right!

934
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,876
Ladies and gentlebugs!
Larvae of all stages!

935
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,152
Rub your legs together for
the world's greatest bug circus!

936
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,597
Wait a minute!

937
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,792
- I think I'm going to wet myself.
- Steady.

938
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,673
- What's going on here?
- Well, uh--

939
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,597
Uh, yes.

940
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,188
We were invited
by Princess Atta...

941
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,676
as a surprise for your arrival.

942
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,518
Squish 'em.

943
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,917
Hey!

944
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,431
- Now that's funny.
- That is funny.

945
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,959
I guess we could use
a little entertainment.

946
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,799
Looks like you did
something right for once, Princess.

947
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,669
- On with the show!
- Hi-ya!

948
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,758
The circus, the circus
I love the circus

949
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,549
Ba-ba all gone!
Baby wants pie!

950
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,355
Pie? He asked for it.
Should I give it to him?

951
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,359
Yeah! Give 'im pie!
Give 'im pie!

952
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,756
- Yeah!
- Thank you, gentlemen.
Always an intellectual treat.

953
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,314
Say, how many roaches does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

954
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,715
Can't tell. As soon as the light
goes on, they scatter!

955
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,355
- Almost there.
- From the most mysterious regions
of uncharted Asia...

956
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,948
- I give you the Chinese Cabinet...
- Come on, girls. Quick. Quick.

957
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,038
of Metamorphosis!

958
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,549
Utilizing psychic vibrations...

959
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,116
- I shall select the perfect volunteer.
- Pick me!

960
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,755
Ooh, no! Come on.
I'm askin' ya with my brain.

961
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,952
- Aha! Why, Your Majesty!
- Me?

962
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,230
No, no. Thumper, down.
Let her go.

963
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,237
Maybe he'll saw her in half.

964
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,830
As you ascend the dung beetle
to the unknown...

965
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,476
put your trust in the mysteries that
are beyond mere mortal comprehension.

966
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,591
Ooh, this is gonna be good!

967
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,595
- Blueberries ready?
- Ready.

968
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,756
Ready!

969
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,475
I call upon the ancient
Szechwan spirits...

970
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,114
to inhabit the body
of our volunteer!

971
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,196
No, no. Just stay in there,
Your Majesty.

972
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,390
Transformation.

973
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,875
Transformation!

974
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,956
Transformation!

975
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,116
Wow. Manny's gettin' good.

976
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:05,472
- Not now.
- If it rains,
that bird'll get ripped to shreds!

977
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,518
And now, insectus...

978
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,757
transformitus!

979
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,757
Ooh, pretty!

980
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,277
Thank you, thank you.

981
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,119
- Thank you.
- That's the signal. That's the signal!

982
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,756
This is it, girls.
Get ready to roll.

983
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,714
- Huh? It's stuck!
- That was amazing!

984
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,549
I have no-- How did they do that?
I have no idea where she went.

985
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,035
- Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
- More! More! More!

986
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,833
- More! More! More!
- Wait!

987
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,633
- Where is she?
- Well, now, uh, actually--

988
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,435
I am sorry.
A magician never reveals his secrets.

989
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,393
That's very true, Hoppy.
I mean, where would the mystery be
if we all knew how it was--

990
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,750
- Shutting up.
- You can do it!

991
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,952
- You've got to make it work!
- Hey!

992
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,388
I said, where is she?

993
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,517
Hold on!

994
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,795
Bird! It's a bird!

995
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,430
Yes!

996
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,151
Let's get out of here! Go!

997
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:59,598
Don't-Don't let it get me!
Don't let it get me!

998
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:03,235
Help me!

999
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,830
Up, down, up, down.
And turn!

1000
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,192
My eye! Help me!

1001
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,956
Mmm, boysenberry.

1002
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,869
Huh?
Aah, no, no, no, no, no!

1003
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,239
Oh, the pain!

1004
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,590
There goes my magic act!

1005
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,553
- Flaming Death!
- No! P.T.!

1006
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,996
A direct hit!

1007
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,472
Flik! Flik! Help us!

1008
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,076
Dot!

1009
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,515
Okay! Everyone out!
Hurry!

1010
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,951
Where's Dot?
Has anyone seen Dot?

1011
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,709
Whose idea was this? Huh?

1012
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,714
Was it yours, Princess?

1013
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,831
Just get behind me, girls.
It'll be okay.

1014
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,554
Leave her alone, Hopper.

1015
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,717
The bird was my idea.
I'm the one you want.

1016
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,439
Where do you get the gall
to do this to me?

1017
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,120
You were-- You were
gonna squish the queen.

1018
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,353
- It's true.
- I hate it when someone
gives away the ending.

1019
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,597
You piece of dirt!
No, I'm wrong.

1020
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,554
You're lower than dirt.
You're an ant!

1021
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,990
Let this be a lesson
to all you ants.

1022
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:33,112
Ideas are very dangerous things.

1023
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,516
You are mindless,
soil-shoving losers...

1024
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,394
put on this earth
to serve us!

1025
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,193
You're wrong, Hopper.

1026
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,992
Ants are not meant
to serve grasshoppers!

1027
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,752
I've seen these ants
do great things.

1028
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,155
And year after year,
they somehow manage...

1029
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,670
to pick food
for themselves and you.

1030
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,635
So-So who is the weaker species?

1031
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,799
Ants don't serve grasshoppers.

1032
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,797
It's you who need us.

1033
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,190
We're a lot stronger
than you say we are.

1034
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,357
And you know it, don't you?

1035
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,076
Well, Princess!

1036
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,794
Um, Hopper?
Um, l-l hate to interrupt, but, um--

1037
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,993
You ants stay back!

1038
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,592
- Oh, this was such a bad idea!
- You see, Hopper...

1039
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,280
nature has a certain order.

1040
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,234
The ants pick the food,
the ants keep the food...

1041
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,430
and the grasshoppers leave!

1042
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,837
- I'm so proud of you, Flik!
- Charge-a!

1043
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,951
Where are you going?
They're just ants!

1044
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,989
No! Bad grasshopper!
Bad grasshopper! Go home!

1045
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,556
- Yeah!
- Come back here, you cowards!

1046
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,672
- Don't leave!
- To the cannon!
- To the cannon!

1047
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,268
No!

1048
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,472
Happy landings, Hopper!

1049
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,558
Huh?

1050
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,113
Rain!

1051
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,870
- Flik!
- Quick! After them!

1052
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,795
- Slim!
- Francis! Francis! Francis, I'm stuck!
- Where are ya?

1053
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,797
- I'm over here!
- Where?
- Here!

1054
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,629
I'm the only stick
with eyeballs!

1055
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,594
- Help! Help! Help!
- Get him!

1056
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,593
No!

1057
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,752
- Go that way!
- But the anthill's over--
- I've got an idea!

1058
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,837
- Flik!
- Come on!

1059
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,191
There!

1060
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,839
Come on!
We've gotta hide!

1061
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,076
No matter what happens,
stay down!

1062
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,077
Flik, no!
What are you doing?

1063
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,437
- Hopper!
- You think it's over?

1064
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,437
No, no, no.
No, l-l can explain.

1065
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,711
- All your little stunt did
was buy them time!
- No, please!

1066
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:09,118
- Please, Hopper!
- I'll get more grasshoppers
and be back next season...

1067
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,310
but you won't!

1068
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,189
Well, what's this? Another one
of your little bird tricks?

1069
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,551
- Yup.
- Are there a bunch of little girls
in this one, too?

1070
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,989
Hello, girls!

1071
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,671
No! No!
No, no, no, no!

1072
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,873
No! No!

1073
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,753
Oh, no!

1074
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,998
Oh, no! No, no, no!

1075
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,270
Come on, boys!

1076
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,675
Hey, Princess Dot!
Wait up!

1077
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:07,359
I finally get a second to relax,
and I gotta get out of my chair.

1078
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:11,598
- Come on! You can rub lotion
on me later, shade boy.
- Yeah, hubba-hubba.

1079
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,190
- Oh, thank you!
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're too kind.

1080
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,550
- It was the least we could do.
- All in a day's work.
- Any time.

1081
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,148
Dim!

1082
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,158
I'm so sorry, kids.
I wish you could come along, too.

1083
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,589
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna cry.

1084
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,875
Hey, let's go. We got a schedule
to keep. Come on. Let's go.

1085
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,116
- Hey!
- Hey, Tiny!
Let's get this show packed up!

1086
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,117
We got paying customers hatching!

1087
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,276
Yes, Mr Flea. Yes, sir.
Of course, sir. Right away, sir.

1088
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,277
And, um, I just wanted
to thank you for giving me a chance...

1089
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,073
because it's an honour to work
with creative giants such as yourself.

1090
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,112
- Shutting up.
- You sure you can't
come on tour with us?

1091
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,312
Sorry.
My place is here.

1092
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,718
- Good answer.
- Oh, well. Your loss.
One minute, insects!

1093
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,794
I wanna thank all of you
for giving us back...

1094
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,629
our hope,
our dignity and our lives.

1095
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:12,719
And to you, Princess Atta.
You have given us so much.

1096
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,798
Please accept this gift
from us bugs...

1097
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,480
to you ants.

1098
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:23,355
- For you!
- Oh! It's a rock.

1099
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,717
- What's with the rock?
- Must be a circus thing.

1100
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,195
Well, Flik,
you really goofed up.

1101
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,029
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you too.

1102
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,112
All right. Now it's gettin' mushy.
We're outta here! Hy-aah!

1103
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,395
- Whoa!
- See ya next season!

1104
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,909
- See ya, Flik!
- Bye! We miss you already!

1105
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,191
- You fired!
- You fired!
- We forgot Heimlich!

1106
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:41,350
I'm finished! Finally,
I'm a beautiful butterfly!

1107
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,678
Mein wings!
Oh, they're beautiful!

1108
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,872
Heimlich! The wagon's taking off!
You better start flying!

1109
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,279
But I am flying! And from way up here,
you all look like little ants!

1110
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,834
Auf Wiedersehen!

1111
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,632
Bye!

1112
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,150
Present stalks!

1113
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,158
Harvester, salute!

1114
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,718
Was a bug, little bug

1115
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,831
Hardly there

1116
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,316
How he felt, what he dreamed

1117
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,317
Who would care

1118
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,395
- Without any evidence
- His flaws were many, ooh

1119
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,990
- He was full of confidence
- Some people haven't any

1120
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,749
- Didn't have much common sense
- It's highly overrated

1121
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,997
He just knew that he'd come through

1122
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,998
It's the time of your life

1123
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,315
So live it well

1124
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,318
It's the time of your life

1125
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,317
So live it well

1126
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:45,271
We may only go round one time

1127
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,153
As far as I can tell

1128
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,317
It's the time of your life

1129
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,749
So live it well

1130
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:58,431
We may only go round this one time

1131
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,597
- As far as I can tell
- He could be wrong about that

1132
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,917
- It's the time of your life
- Time, life

1133
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,555
- It's the time of your life
- Time, life

1134
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,672
It's the time of your life

1135
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:15,076
So live it well

1136
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,397
- Speed!
- Marker.
- And-- action!

1137
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,397
Are you saying I'm stupid?

1138
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,080
- No.
- Do I look stupid to you?

1139
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,111
I'm sorry.

1140
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:31,073
Are you saying I'm stupid? Oh!

1141
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,595
I'm sorry. I got it. No, no, no.
Just do it again. I'm fine.

1142
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:40,917
- Are you saying I'm stupid?
- Yes!

1143
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,837
This is the fifteenth take.

1144
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,837
I cannot work like this.

1145
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,635
- I will be in my trailer.
- I need a break.

1146
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,399
- Marker.
- Whoa, Flik, honey.

1147
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,035
We are not about to--
Is someone hammering?

1148
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,037
Can we hold the work, please?
People!

1149
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,196
Am-- Am I in this shot?
You can-- You can see me, right?

1150
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,754
And-- action.

1151
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,348
To infinity and beyond!

1152
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,470
I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.

1153
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,397
Really, can y--
can you blame me?

1154
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:14,149
- Okay. Okay, let's go for real now.
- Okay, cut!
- Sorry.

1155
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,350
Why go back to Ant lsland at all?

1156
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,357
- I mean, you don't even like grain.
- What?

1157
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,516
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

1158
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,995
- Actually, it wasn't even my idea.
- Watch it!

1159
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,031
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Is the camera broke?

1160
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,232
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Did I ruin the take?

1161
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,794
And, uh, thank you
for findin' 'em, Flik.

1162
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:35,038
- Me? Oh, uh, uh--
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Oh, no.

1163
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,869
- This really hurts. Can we cut?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ow!

1164
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,877
So, is there a Mrs Ant...

1165
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,036
you have to tunnel home to?

1166
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:47,438
Ooh, I'm sorry.
I thought he was real.

1167
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,835
Oh, dear.
Put that thing in my car.

1168
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,475
- Marker.
- Flik, after much deliberation--

1169
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,477
Whoa!

1170
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,433
Ohh, I g--
Oh, my eye!

1171
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,028
Oh, no, seriously,
I got berry juice in my eye!

1172
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,037
It stings!
Stop acting!

1173
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,151
I'm serious!
Oh, stop the camera!

1174
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,719
Uh-oh. Towel!
I need a towel over here!

1175
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,960
Cut!

1176
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,833
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
C-Can we cut?

1177
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,190
It's just that l-l don't think
I'm comin' across.

1178
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:26,471
Hmm. Oh, I know, I know.
I could lather up a bunch of spit.

1179
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,433
Ooh, ooh. That's good. I got it, J.L.
All right. One more for me.

1180
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,357
- Speed.
- Marker.

1181
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,516
- Action!
- Spinning a web of safety...

1182
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,392
in less than 50--

1183
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,398
It's the time of your life

1184
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,397
So live it well

1185
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,678
It's the time of your life

1186
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,677
So live it well

1187
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,671
We may only go round one time

1188
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,473
As far as I can tell

1189
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,592
It's the time of your life

1190
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,597
So live it well

1191
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,831
Like us all he started small

1192
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,837
Then he grew

1193
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,032
When the time came he knew

1194
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,037
What to do

1195
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,075
- He knew in order to succeed
- They'd have to work together

1196
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,715
- He turned a rock into a seed
- And they were changed forever

1197
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,229
Then they had the strength they'd need

1198
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:34,592
- To get through stormy weather
- Do or die, you gotta try

1199
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:37,757
It's the time of your life

1200
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,757
So live it well

1201
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,993
It's the time of your life

1202
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,997
So live it well

1203
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:53,997
You may only go round one time

1204
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,237
- As far as I can tell
- He may be wrong about that

1205
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,079
It's the time of your life

1206
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,953
So live it well

1207
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,709
Isn't it a bit surprising

1208
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,435
How our fortunes ebb and flow

1209
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,155
And only to the enterprising

1210
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,353
Does the magic fortune cookie go

1211
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,359
Believe me
It's the time of your life

1212
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,357
So live it well

1213
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,592
It's the time of your life

1214
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:31,756
So live it well

1215
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:38,671
We may only go round one time

1216
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,439
As far as I can tell

1217
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:45,075
It's the time of your life

1218
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,715
It's the time of your life

1219
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:52,037
It's the time of your life

1220
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,390
So live it well
