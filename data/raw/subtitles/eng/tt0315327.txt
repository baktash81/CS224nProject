1
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:45,496
- Ally, can we get a recap?
- Remember the Kowolskis?

2
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:49,904
They want to set a record by
making Buffalo's largest cookie.

3
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:52,049
- You have to wear this.
- A hairnet?

4
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:56,129
Health Department. If you're around
the cookie, you have to have it on.

5
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:57,707
I just did the hair.

6
00:00:57,847 --> 00:00:59,166
The hairis perfect.

7
00:00:59,307 --> 00:01:01,423
All right, give it to me.

8
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:06,958
God... why do you hate me?

9
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,828
We're rolling. And speed.

10
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:12,696
For three decades,
the Kowolski Bakery

11
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,698
has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo,

12
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:19,452
known for their sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski pierogies

13
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:23,486
and the occasional
sugar-induced coma that follows.

14
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,462
Today, in honour of their 30th anniversary,

15
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:30,417
they've invited us to ride along
as they go for the record

16
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,522
on Buffalo's biggest cookie.

17
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:40,050
Vol. Do you need
a tissue or something?

18
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,860
Can we get Vol a tissue? Or a spoon?

19
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:44,849
Good thing we're wearing these.

20
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:48,243
I wouldn't want any stray hairs
to fall into the booger.

21
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:51,146
- We doing this again?
- No. We can cut to B roll.

22
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:52,579
Moving on!

23
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:56,926
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

24
00:01:57,608 --> 00:02:04,286
Well, man from Health Department
say he find rat pellet in our pastry.

25
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:08,887
But I say no, is big chocolate sprinkle.

26
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:11,796
But he shut store down.

27
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:14,431
So we clean up,

28
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:18,694
make big cookie
for to bring customers back.

29
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,164
Well, I admire your candour.

30
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:24,134
Let's try that again, shall we?

31
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:28,176
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

32
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:33,412
So the children of the neighbourhood
will be happy.

33
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:37,228
It must be wonderful seeing
the smiles on their little faces.

34
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:41,031
I work in back. I see no smiles.

35
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:48,474
The previous record was 8 feet
7 inches, baked by Gladys Pelsnick.

36
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:51,612
If this cookie beats that, it will prove

37
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,972
the Kowolskis
have much more free time.

38
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:57,786
And the cookie is... 10 feet, 4 inches!

39
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:00,595
We have a new record!

40
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:04,002
Cue the cheesy inspirational music!

41
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:24,197
But what are we really looking at here?

42
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,187
Is it just a big cookie?

43
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,387
Or does this cookie represent
the pride of Buffalo?

44
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:32,834
Its hard-working citizens
the key ingredient -

45
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:35,056
with a few nuts thrown in.

46
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,183
And finally,
the love of our families,

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,999
which provides the warm centre,

48
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:45,475
making our beloved Buffalo
the sweetest place to live.

49
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,495
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

50
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:51,616
I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News.

51
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,741
And cut.

52
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:57,504
So what do you think?

53
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,069
It's really good.

54
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:01,773
It sucks. It's a story about a cookie.

55
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:05,160
The Pillsbury Doughboy
would be riveted.

56
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:09,615
It made me laugh. Nothing wrong
with making people laugh.

57
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:13,436
I'll never be an anchorman.
The job's there, but I can't reach it.

58
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:18,472
Every time they make me do
this kind of stuff I have to act like a goof.

59
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:22,081
I have no credibility. Not good.

60
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,591
- Now you just sound silly.
- Forget it.

61
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:28,291
It's not important.
Let's watch it one more time.

62
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,482
- No.
- Once more? Please?

63
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:34,046
No! You promised to help me
with this photo album.

64
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,442
Now get your gooy butt over here.

65
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,157
Looking.

66
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:45,867
OK.

67
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:49,963
Just go through this stack
and pick your favourites.

68
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:56,808
Come on. This is fun, right?

69
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:58,962
Isn't this fun? This is nice.

70
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:01,967
Evan's going to get that anchor job.

71
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,733
- Bruce!
- He's the favourite.

72
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:07,521
You know what? Just forget it.
This is just our life.

73
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:10,729
We can always just
have some kid do it for us.

74
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,402
Hold the phone.

75
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:16,037
I like this one.
Our weekend at the lake.

76
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:19,149
That's supposed to be in our private stash.

77
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:22,596
- You look perky. Must have been cold.
- Give it to me.

78
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:25,182
I think I'll put this on my computer.

79
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,326
- Give it to me. Come on.
- No!

80
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,567
Fine. Do with it what you will.

81
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:31,421
I don't care.

82
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,973
- I will do with it what I will.
- Jesus.

83
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:38,444
I might even send this in to Playboy.

84
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:42,386
- Their layouts can be quite tasteful.
- Give that to me right now!

85
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:45,545
- Rough stuff.
- I'm going to hurt you.

86
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,510
Sweetie? Time to get up.

87
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:58,137
Good dream. No.

88
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:12,419
The Buffalo Sabres lost again last
night to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

89
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:15,058
Of course they did. They're my team.

90
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:17,489
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

91
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,544
There might be something
to this cookie line.

92
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:26,145
The greatest anchors have a signature
sign-off. Like Walter Cronkite.

93
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:30,537
And that's the way it was.

94
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:33,915
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

95
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:38,495
That's the way I like it

96
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:41,206
Oh, no.

97
00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:43,868
- Grace, the dog!
- I'm in the shower!

98
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,616
No, Sam. Bad dog.

99
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,007
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

100
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,192
You're done now. Great.

101
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:06,044
B- E-A-utiful.

102
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,598
Come on.
Let's go back in and have a shit.

103
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:19,133
- What is the dillio?
- We are having a blood drive.

104
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:22,617
- Needles. Yuck.
- They need my blood.

105
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:26,082
I have a very rare blood type.
I'm AB positive.

106
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,379
Really? I'm IB positive.

107
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:32,474
I B positive they ain't touching me
with no needle. It's just so...

108
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:35,450
- Helpful and life-saving?
- No. It's blood.

109
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:39,122
Blood is supposed to stay
inside the body, where it's meant to be.

110
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:43,196
Besides, they stockpile this stuff
in a warehouse, it's all on ice,

111
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,201
and they say there's a shortage.

112
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,279
Where did you hear that?

113
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:49,329
From a friend of a friend

114
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:52,965
of a girl whose sister is going out with
someone in the government.

115
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,481
For your protection,
I cannot discuss it.

116
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,976
Now get out,
before they see us together.

117
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,843
Here. You need these more than I do.

118
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,450
What is "these"?

119
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:08,744
Prayer beads.
The kids made them for me.

120
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,718
- They will keep you safe.
- I hope they're powerful.

121
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:16,365
I'm going to need a friggin' miracle
to get to work on time.

122
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:30,707
This isn't happening.
Not now. Not during sweeps week.

123
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,917
Oh, God.

124
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:40,306
Yup, meeting started without me.

125
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,014
This is my luck.

126
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,996
Come on.

127
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,751
Jesus.

128
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,962
Get out of there!

129
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:07,144
"Are you blind?" No, but I'm late.

130
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:12,279
Is yourchild in direjeopardy?

131
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:14,475
Find out tonight after the game.

132
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,325
Promos are approved.

133
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:19,560
Jack? Shouldn't we be focusing
on Pete's retirement?

134
00:09:19,783 --> 00:09:23,139
- This is his last week.
- Any word on the anchor position?

135
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:26,247
Evan, when I know something,
you'll know something.

136
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:28,798
Sorry I'm late.

137
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,233
Traffic was...

138
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,171
Did you already play the spots?

139
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,976
Nice story,
but we're going with Evan's piece.

140
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:39,404
The sex scandal
in the mayor's office for sweeps.

141
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,644
Yeah. Sweeps.

142
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:46,616
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

143
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,464
I'm just messing with you, Bruce.

144
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:56,637
See, you just gotta remember that
the newsroom is like a big cookie.

145
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:02,367
Do you like jazz, Evan?
Let me play something for you.

146
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:12,290
- I can hold that note all day.
- Knock it off, guys.

147
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:15,070
We'll keep your story in reserve.

148
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:19,240
Can we get back to the board so we'll
have something to put on the air today?

149
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:23,210
Great choice, Jack.
The Cadillac of bolognas.

150
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:25,260
Jack, can I talk to you?

151
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,984
- Sure. What do you need?
- Sweeps.

152
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:31,886
Jack, hear me out.
I'm starting to get desperate.

153
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,375
I'm pushing 40
and what have I got to show?

154
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:38,869
I've hit a kind of ceiling. There's an
anti-Bruce barrier I can't get past.

155
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:42,339
And Evan is loving it.

156
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:46,350
He gets the stories, he gets on sweeps...
I should be more like Evan.

157
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,723
Don't be like Evan. Evan's an asshole.

158
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,619
- I can be an asshole.
- No, Bruce. You can't.

159
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:59,297
- You going to pick that up?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

160
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:03,123
This anchor thing opening up
has got me nuts.

161
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:05,364
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Jack.

162
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,902
You're a good reporter.
You make people laugh.

163
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,472
All right. I'll tell you what.

164
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,783
Today is the 156th anniversary
of the Maid Of The Mist.

165
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,242
- I want you in Niagara Falls in an hour.
- The Maid Of The Mist is always live.

166
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,214
- Evan always does the live feeds.
- Now you and Evan get the live feeds.

167
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,628
I'm going live? During sweeps?

168
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:33,123
Watch your step.
I've seen your outtakes.

169
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:35,193
Jack, you will not regret this.

170
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:38,835
And I won't forget you
when I go national.

171
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:40,620
Can you...?

172
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:43,729
Thanks, pal.

173
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:47,581
Can I have your wish now?
I'll put it in the wish jar.

174
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:49,179
Put your wish in.

175
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,320
- Me, too.
- Put your wish in.

176
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:53,791
That looks like a big wish.

177
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,836
No, Martin, don't eat that.

178
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:59,956
Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey.

179
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:05,336
- That must have tasted awful.
- Mommy!

180
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,753
Did you have a good time
with Aunt Gracie today?

181
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:15,251
- See how nice this is? Baby on the hip.
- It's amazing. You've become Mom.

182
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,748
The transformation is complete.

183
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,255
I'll get it.

184
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,196
- Small Wonders Day Care.
- Grace?

185
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:25,351
It's Debbie, the sister
whose life you're notwasting.

186
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,686
- OK.
- Bye, Debbie!

187
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:29,855
Hi. Sorry.

188
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,910
Debbie forgot to take her meds today.
Where are you?

189
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:35,550
A little place
called the winner's circle.

190
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,860
I'm at the falls, doing a live report.

191
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,948
Live? That's great!

192
00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:43,080
Yeah! It's happening, hon.
I got sweeps and I'm live.

193
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:45,487
They're seeing if I can think on my feet.

194
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,423
Like I might have to do
in a live anchor situation.

195
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,222
Oh, my gosh.

196
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:54,057
Yeah! Jack practically came out
and told me.

197
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:55,530
Practically?

198
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:58,476
He didn't spell it out. Legally, he can't.

199
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,992
This is what happened to Susan Ortega
before they bumped her up to the desk.

200
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:05,384
It's good.

201
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:09,555
Well, honey, I just don't want you
to get too ahead of yourself.

202
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:11,407
- Bruce.
- I got to go!

203
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:14,684
- They're calling me in.
- OK, honey. Good luck. I love you.

204
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:18,628
Let's do it.

205
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,659
- They want you close to the falls.
- I'm going to get soaked.

206
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:25,380
That's the point.
They want you to put this on.

207
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,538
Part of the condition
of us getting the exclusive.

208
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:32,661
You know what?
Nothing can bother me today. Nothing.

209
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:36,433
Now remember,
it's their 156th-year anniversary.

210
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:40,550
149 capacity. They cater
to tourists, honeymooners...

211
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,553
And people who are insanely thirsty.
I get it.

212
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:46,275
You're going to interview
Irene Dansfield.

213
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:50,466
Irene, a pleasure to meet you.
You look beautiful.

214
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:53,001
Irene's mother rode on the maiden voyage.

215
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:55,017
- Rub that in my face!
- 90 seconds!

216
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:56,621
Holy hell.

217
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:00,981
Because of the fast response,

218
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:05,031
the chemicals were cleaned up
without incident. Susan?

219
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,430
Bruce Nolan is at Niagara Falls.

220
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:10,813
But before we go live to Bruce,
we have an announcement.

221
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:13,470
As everyone knows, after 33 years,

222
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:16,895
our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.

223
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:21,597
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible
to fill, but the show must go on.

224
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:27,158
And we could think ofno one better
than our very own Evan Baxter.

225
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:30,877
Oh, boy!

226
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:33,938
- Congratulations.
- I'm thrilled and honoured.

227
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:38,529
As you said, no one can replace
Pete, but I will do my best.

228
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:43,280
I am so proud to be a part
of our local community of Buffalo.

229
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:48,479
I think, in a lot of ways, a great
city is like a great recipe, really.

230
00:14:48,777 --> 00:14:52,167
You take hard-working citizens,
add some care-givers,

231
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,157
maybe a few nuts!

232
00:14:57,534 --> 00:15:01,129
All sprinkled with the love
and support of our good families.

233
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:05,284
Ultimately, that makes
one sweet place to live.

234
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:08,946
- That was amazing.
- I wish I'd written something.

235
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,685
And now let's go live to that wacky
Bruce Nolan at Niagara Falls.

236
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:14,596
Hey, wacky Bruce!

237
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:22,205
- Talk, Bruce. Hello.
- Talk, honey.

238
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,227
- What's going on?
- A Walt Disney.

239
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,745
- It's frozen solid.
- Check the feed.

240
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:29,050
We may be having technical difficulty.

241
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:31,104
- The feed's good, Jack.
- Come on.

242
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,899
- Talk, Bruce, damn it.
- Get ready to pull the plug.

243
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:37,538
Come on, baby. Say something!

244
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:39,746
Bruce, talk.

245
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:44,461
- Hi, Susan.
- Thank you, God.

246
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:45,936
Bruce Nolan here,

247
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:49,512
aboard the Maid Of The Mist
in fabulous Niagara Falls, New York.

248
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,323
First, let me just add another
congratulations to Evan Backstabber.

249
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:56,734
Pardon me, Bastard... Baxter.

250
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,717
It is good to see what
someone with real talent can do

251
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:03,073
when great opportunities
are given to them instead of me.

252
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:07,589
Anyway, I'm here
with Katharine Hepburn's mom.

253
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:12,356
Why did you throw the Heart of the Ocean
jewel over the railing of the Titanic?

254
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:15,581
Did you feel bad
letting Leo DiCaprio drown

255
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,079
while you were safe
floating on the door?

256
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:19,785
Could you have taken turns?

257
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,294
Or were you too afraid
to freeze your big fat ass off?

258
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,281
I guess that's how life is.

259
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,801
Some people are drenched, freezing
on a stupid boat with a stupid hat,

260
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,270
while others are in a news studio,
sucking up the glory.

261
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,485
Oh, well. No big deal.

262
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:41,344
The owner of the Maid Of The Mist.
Let's have a talk with him.

263
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,461
Come on in here, Bill.
No, let's have a talk.

264
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,580
What are you doing?

265
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:49,826
You've been running
the Maid Of The Mistfor 23 years.

266
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:52,085
Why do you think
I didn't get anchor?

267
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,693
- I don't want any problems.
- Is it my hair?

268
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:58,003
Are my teeth not white enough?
Or, like the great falls,

269
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:03,172
is the bedrock of my life
eroding beneath me?

270
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:08,628
Eroding!

271
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,919
- Cut the feed. Go to black.
- I'm on it.

272
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:18,450
I'm Bruce Nolan, for Eyewitness News.
Back to you, fuckers!

273
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:21,874
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, my God.

274
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,585
That is perfect.

275
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,546
That is the motivation that I needed!

276
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,822
Right there! Thank you!

277
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,497
Thank you, WKBW.

278
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:42,026
Wimpy... Kitty Baby Whiners!

279
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,251
That's what that stands for!

280
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:48,247
I'll see you on Channel 5.

281
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:50,468
Where they do the real news!

282
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:53,843
Do I look blind to you?

283
00:17:57,232 --> 00:17:59,188
Let's go, man. Come on.

284
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:01,824
What are you doing?

285
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:04,103
Come on. Leave the poor guy alone!

286
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:07,307
You OK, man?

287
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,571
Yeah, you better keep walking.

288
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:14,032
- What'd you say, ese?
- Run, man!

289
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:16,237
Run!

290
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:19,368
Oh, God!

291
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,621
OK, I didn't mean it!

292
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:27,133
- I was just kidding!
- Hey, you forgot your things.

293
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:33,962
Say something now!

294
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,357
B- E-A...

295
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:43,913
.. utiful.

296
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:49,953
That's what I get...

297
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:53,065
That's what I get
for trying to help someone.

298
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,556
Don't look at me, Walter.

299
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,735
Oh, no!

300
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,032
That's my payment, I guess.

301
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,519
That is my reward.

302
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:16,907
Just? Just get a clue!

303
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:19,935
Thank God you're all right.

304
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:22,210
God, yeah. Let's thank God.

305
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:25,027
For his blessings
are raining down upon me.

306
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:28,137
- Wait! That's not rain!
- Bruce, please don't do that.

307
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:30,866
Everything happens for a reason.

308
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:34,136
That I don't need. That is a cliché.
That is not helpful.

309
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,827
"A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush. "

310
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:39,939
I have no bird! No bush!
God has taken my bird and my bush.

311
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:43,191
I see. So God is picking on you?

312
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:45,717
No! He's ignoring me completely.

313
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:49,303
He's busy giving Evan
everything he wants.

314
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,576
Great, Sam. But you missed
your target. I'm over here!

315
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,067
Don't get mad at the dog.
It's not his fault.

316
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:59,371
It's God's fault.
He gave him the wrong co-ordinates.

317
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:02,023
Enough!
Will you stop being such a martyr?

318
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,651
I am not being a martyr! I'm a victim!

319
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:08,598
God is a mean kid with
a magniying glass, and I'm the ant.

320
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:10,961
He could fix my life if he wanted,

321
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:14,336
but he'd rather burn off my feelers
and watch me squirm.

322
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,834
Sweetheart, I know you're mad.

323
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:20,409
What Evan did was slimy and wrong.

324
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:23,958
This day could have been so
much worse. I'm just glad you're OK.

325
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:27,549
OK? News flash! I'm not OK.

326
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,136
I'm not OK with a mediocre job!
Or a mediocre apartment!

327
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:33,926
I'm not OK with a mediocre life!

328
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,534
Is that what you think we have?
A mediocre life?

329
00:20:45,754 --> 00:20:47,665
Don't make this about you.

330
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,275
About me?
How could I make this about me?

331
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,627
It's about you. It's always about you.

332
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:57,076
Perfect.

333
00:20:57,265 --> 00:21:01,543
I'll have the worst day of my life
with a side order of guilt, please!

334
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:10,828
OK, God. You want me to talk to you?

335
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:14,239
Then talk back.
Tell me what's going on.

336
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:17,242
What should I do? Give me a signal.

337
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:23,654
I need your guidance, Lord.
Please, send me a sign.

338
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,907
Oh, what's this joker doing now?

339
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:38,509
OK. All right. I'll try it your way.

340
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:44,135
All right. Lord... I need a miracle.

341
00:21:45,724 --> 00:21:47,396
I'm desperate.

342
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,231
I need your help, Lord.

343
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:51,623
Please, reach into my life...

344
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,032
What the...? Where are you?

345
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,224
Got you!

346
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:43,800
Fine!

347
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,817
The gloves are off, pal!

348
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:48,339
Come on! Let me see a little wrath!

349
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:52,203
Smite me, O mighty smiter!

350
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,549
You're the one who should be fired!

351
00:22:55,742 --> 00:23:00,054
The only one around here
not doing his job is you!

352
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:03,278
Answer me!

353
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:20,377
Sorry. Don't know you.

354
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:23,463
Wouldn't call you if I did.

355
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,351
Oh, God!

356
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:47,427
Hello, 5550123.

357
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:15,891
Oh, no! Sam, this has got to stop!

358
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:22,162
Get it straight. That's the house.
This is the bathroom.

359
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:26,360
House, bathroom. Bathroom, house.

360
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:30,832
What's the point?

361
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,066
5550123.

362
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:03,564
Denied thatpromotion?
Is life unfair?

363
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,886
Is someone less talented than you
reaping the benefits?

364
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,663
Is yourname Bruce?

365
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:10,885
Then do we have thejob foryou!

366
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:14,298
We're located at 7725623rd Street.

367
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:17,839
So come on down -
or we'lljust keep beeping you.

368
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,489
"Omni Presents. "

369
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:41,118
Oh, yeah. The glass is half-full.

370
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,802
Come on! Look! What is that?

371
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:54,911
Thank you again.

372
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:04,854
What the...?

373
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,028
You're looking for room 7.

374
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,620
- Yeah, I figured.
- Want me to even those up for you?

375
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:27,543
- How do I get to room 7?
- That'd be on the 7th floor.

376
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,229
- Stairs are over there.
- I'll take the elevator.

377
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:34,987
- Out of order.
- The stairs were my second choice.

378
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:37,818
Do you mind giving me a hand
with this floor?

379
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:41,773
What? That's good.

380
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:43,456
Are you serious?

381
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:48,417
I'm kind of busy. Rain check.

382
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,571
I'll hold you to it.

383
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,873
I'm free on the 7th at 7.00.

384
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,276
The 7th at 7.00 it is.

385
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,690
This looks promising.

386
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,958
Hello?

387
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,522
Another hugantic,
ginormic waste of my life.

388
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,877
Hello?

389
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm looking for whoever runs this joint!

390
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,776
Be right with you. I'm fixing a light.

391
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,047
Tell me if it's working.

392
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,299
Yeah. Seems to be.

393
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,270
- Kind of bright, though.
- Yeah. It is for most people.

394
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:38,679
Spend their lives in the dark,
trying to hide from me.

395
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,600
The elevator's broken, huh?

396
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:45,694
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.

397
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:50,793
- You installed a clapper?
- No, but catchy jingle, isn't it?

398
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:53,336
Clap on, clap off

399
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:56,548
The clapper

400
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,979
Just can't get it out of my head.

401
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:02,448
Well, good luck with that.

402
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:04,385
- I'm going to go now.
- OK.

403
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:06,746
But the boss will be right out.

404
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:18,970
You must be Bruce.
I've been expecting you.

405
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:23,193
This is hilarious.

406
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:26,000
You're the boss,
electrician and janitor.

407
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:28,107
Must be a killer Christmas party.

408
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:31,591
Don't get drunk, though.
One of you might need a ride home.

409
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,350
You always were funny, Bruce.
Just like your father.

410
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:40,044
He didn't mind
rolling up his sleeves either.

411
00:28:40,248 --> 00:28:44,924
People underestimate the benefit of
manual labour. There's freedom in it.

412
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:49,250
Some of the happiest people smell to
high heaven at the end of the day.

413
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:52,501
All right, what is this?

414
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:55,597
How do you know my father
and how did you get my number?

415
00:28:55,804 --> 00:28:57,522
I know a lot about you, Bruce.

416
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:01,408
Just about everything there is to know.

417
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:07,107
Everything you've ever said or done
or thought about doing.

418
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:10,910
Right there in that file cabinet.

419
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:15,170
- Wow! A whole drawer, just for me.
- Yeah.

420
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:17,793
Mind if I take a look?

421
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:20,425
It's your life.

422
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:22,610
This oughta be good.

423
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:39,281
This last entry was a little disturbing.

424
00:29:51,645 --> 00:29:53,601
"The gloves are off, God. "

425
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:56,240
"God has taken my bird and my bush. "

426
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,716
"God is a mean kid
with a magniying glass. "

427
00:29:59,943 --> 00:30:03,094
"Smite me, O mighty smiter. "

428
00:30:03,322 --> 00:30:07,235
I'm not much for blaspheming,
but that last one made me laugh.

429
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:09,483
Are you spying on me?

430
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:15,506
Who are you?

431
00:30:15,707 --> 00:30:17,698
I am the One.

432
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:20,994
Creator of the heavens and the earth.
Alpha and Omega.

433
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:24,823
I see where this is going.

434
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:27,681
Bruce... I am God.

435
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:29,841
Bingo! Yahtzee!

436
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:33,971
Is that your final answer?
Our survey says, "God!"

437
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:37,600
It was nice to meet you, God.

438
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:41,237
Thanks for the Grand Canyon.
Good luck with the Apocalypse.

439
00:30:41,478 --> 00:30:44,788
And by the way, you suck!

440
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,980
It would have been more impressive

441
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:50,109
if you hadn't used
the cheesy file cabinet illusion.

442
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:52,994
Anybody with a brain stem
can tell that drawer

443
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:55,792
is being fed through the wall
from the other side.

444
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:58,905
All you have to do
is find the crease right around here.

445
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,396
There is a seam here, or a hollow spot.

446
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:09,166
Where?

447
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:11,328
Through the dry wall and concrete?

448
00:31:14,468 --> 00:31:17,346
OK, that is a good one.

449
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,457
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Thou shalt not tempt the Lord.

450
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:24,555
- If you can't do it...
- Three.

451
00:31:24,726 --> 00:31:26,717
Two... four... nine.

452
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:28,647
Six... eight... one.

453
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,629
OK.

454
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:35,279
How many now?

455
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:36,716
Seven.

456
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,453
- How?
- You've been complaining about me.

457
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:48,660
- I'm tired of it.
- Don't come near me. Seriously.

458
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:51,909
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will out of instinct.

459
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:55,833
You haven't won a fight since
grade 5, and that was against a girl.

460
00:31:57,629 --> 00:32:00,302
But she was huge.
She'd been held back.

461
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,577
And the sun was in your eyes.

462
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,636
Ah, the ego.

463
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:07,362
Anyway, I brought you here
to offer you a job.

464
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:10,068
- A job? What job?
- My job.

465
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:13,464
You think you can do it better,
so here's your chance.

466
00:32:13,685 --> 00:32:17,644
When you leave this building,
you will be endowed with all my powers.

467
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:20,651
Sure. Whatever you say, pal.

468
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:27,611
OK. That did not happen.
No one needs to hear about it.

469
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,854
I'm deleting the program.

470
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,337
No.

471
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:35,289
I'm having a breakdown.

472
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:38,922
Everyday psychotic episode,
caused by a tumour, a brain lesion.

473
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,911
Come on. Start!

474
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,036
That was lucky.

475
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:52,635
Come on. Calm down.

476
00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:55,600
You did not meet God.
You do not have his powers.

477
00:32:56,472 --> 00:32:58,747
If that was God, I'm Clint Eastwood.

478
00:32:58,932 --> 00:33:00,923
Holy hell!

479
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:09,643
Be careful what you wish for, punk.

480
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:11,672
Nope!

481
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:16,749
I am a reasonable,
sane human being.

482
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:18,743
With a. 44 Magnum.

483
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,218
The most powerful handgun in the...

484
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:26,114
I'm not Clint Eastwood.
I'm Bruce Nolan.

485
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,362
I'm Bruce Nolan!

486
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:44,628
That was not real.

487
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:49,405
- Coffee?
- Coffee, yeah.

488
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:51,512
We have a special on soup today.

489
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:55,679
- No, thank you.
- It's tomato. I made it myself.

490
00:33:57,316 --> 00:33:58,908
OK.

491
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:35,088
Excuse me, I need a spoo-...

492
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:44,388
It's OK. I found one.

493
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:53,582
Here's your soup.

494
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,298
Oh, soup, right.

495
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,441
Yeah, right.

496
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:49,027
Having fun?

497
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,224
Thy, thou...

498
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,014
Come. Take a closer walk with me.

499
00:35:57,797 --> 00:35:59,947
- Let me explain the rules.
- Rules?

500
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:03,762
You left in such a rush,
I didn't get a chance to explain.

501
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:08,296
The two extra fingers
freaked me out a little.

502
00:36:08,515 --> 00:36:10,870
I figured I'd get your attention.

503
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:14,130
I did the same to Gandhi.
He didn't eat for three weeks.

504
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:17,146
Anyway, here's the deal.

505
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:20,270
You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.

506
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:23,553
There are two rules.
You can't tell anybody you're God.

507
00:36:23,776 --> 00:36:28,133
Believe me, you don't want the attention.
And you can't mess with free will.

508
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:35,098
- Can I ask why?
- Yes! You can!

509
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,320
That's the beauty of it.

510
00:36:44,796 --> 00:36:48,630
- This is amazing.
- Speaking of amazing, excuse me.

511
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:55,040
Holy sh-... Cow.

512
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,433
Since you're through with these,
I'll keep them.

513
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:01,576
Might come in handy some day.

514
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,310
See you around, kid.

515
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:08,287
- Where are you going?
- I'm... taking a vacation.

516
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:10,241
God doesn't take vacations.

517
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,356
Does he? Do... ye?

518
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:15,215
Did you ever hear of the Dark Ages?

519
00:37:15,404 --> 00:37:19,477
I'm covered. You can clear everything up
in five minutes if you want.

520
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:21,334
Right?

521
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:09,808
And he saw that it was good.

522
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:38,285
B- E-A-utiful!

523
00:38:43,773 --> 00:38:45,764
Check it out.

524
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:49,366
Look, it's the hero.

525
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:52,327
- Whassup, homie?
- Yo, brethren, what up with thee?

526
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,215
- Blessings on your alley.
- Want another can of whup ass?

527
00:38:57,453 --> 00:39:00,604
- You didn't get enough?
- He wants some more!

528
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:04,790
Surely, I say unto you dudes,
I do not wish to fight.

529
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:09,034
So as soon as you apologise and make
a reckoning of your transgressions,

530
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:12,809
I shall absolve you and continue
along the path of righteousness.

531
00:39:13,507 --> 00:39:15,498
What are you talking about?

532
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,952
You talk kind of funny. I don't know
if you lost it up here or what.

533
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:25,296
You want me and the homies
to apologise? Cool.

534
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:30,069
We'll apologise the day a monkey
comes out of my butt. How about that?

535
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,892
What a coincidence!
Because that's today.

536
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:57,437
Did that monkey
just come out your crack?

537
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:05,781
This is some voodoo shit!

538
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:08,419
You guys leaving?

539
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:11,796
Don't forget your parting gifts!

540
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,600
Hey, little anal-dwelling butt monkey.

541
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:44,467
Time for you to go home.

542
00:40:57,806 --> 00:41:00,115
I am Bruce Almighty.

543
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:03,061
My will be done!

544
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:16,403
What if God was one of us

545
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:19,838
Just a slob like one of us

546
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:23,420
Just a stranger on a bus

547
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:25,612
Trying to make his way

548
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:29,897
Home

549
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:32,082
- My God.
- Call me Bruce.

550
00:41:32,253 --> 00:41:34,369
What happened to you? You seem so...

551
00:41:39,385 --> 00:41:40,738
happy.

552
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:43,447
Why shouldn't I be? On a night like this.

553
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:46,392
Those are amazing. What are these?

554
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,036
A new breed. A cross-pollination
between tulips and daisies.

555
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,830
I call them todayzees.

556
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:56,596
OK.

557
00:42:02,612 --> 00:42:04,921
Honey, these flowers are beautiful.

558
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:08,535
- But last night...
- Last night, I was only human.

559
00:42:13,915 --> 00:42:15,906
Barry, help me out.

560
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:16,125
Honey? Hi.

561
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,359
- I've never seen the moon that big.
- Yeah.

562
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,214
We really shouldn't waste it.

563
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,855
Bedroom?

564
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:38,020
Five minutes.

565
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,110
Let there be light.

566
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:54,490
I'll be out in a minute!

567
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:57,007
Don't rush.

568
00:43:57,169 --> 00:44:00,081
Sometimes anticipation
can heighten the...

569
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:01,368
pleasure!

570
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:03,499
Oh, God.

571
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:08,234
It's a funny thing about pleasure.

572
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,769
It can be quite... pleasurable!

573
00:44:16,897 --> 00:44:18,888
Oh, my God.

574
00:44:19,649 --> 00:44:21,640
Pleasuring, pleasurable.

575
00:44:24,987 --> 00:44:26,340
Oh, good God!

576
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:37,995
In international news:

577
00:44:38,165 --> 00:44:42,204
Japanese reliefworkers are staging an
effort to rescue hundreds ofpeople

578
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,816
stranded by a freak tidal wave
that hit Kitamoto City.

579
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:48,684
Scientists say the tsunami
may have been caused

580
00:44:48,882 --> 00:44:52,875
by what they are describing
as unusual lunaractivity.

581
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:55,126
More on this as it develops.

582
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:03,688
Please bless my mommy, my daddy,
and especially my little sister.

583
00:45:05,856 --> 00:45:09,212
Please help me, Lord.
Please get me through this one.

584
00:45:16,323 --> 00:45:19,315
Thank you foreverything else
in my life. Amen.

585
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:47,414
Good boy.

586
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:51,175
Forget something?

587
00:45:54,523 --> 00:45:57,276
Good boy! There are girls in the house.

588
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:03,770
- Morning.
- Good morning.

589
00:46:03,948 --> 00:46:06,940
- I made you grilled cheese.
- My favi.

590
00:46:07,993 --> 00:46:11,269
- Honey, last night was...
- Heavenly. I know.

591
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:15,887
I mean, I woke up and I felt like
my boobs were bigger.

592
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:19,158
- Do they look bigger to you?
- What?

593
00:46:19,378 --> 00:46:21,414
No.

594
00:46:21,588 --> 00:46:24,056
- Bigger?
- Oh, come on!

595
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:25,977
Look at them.

596
00:46:26,135 --> 00:46:28,285
Please. They are definitely bigger.

597
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,030
I mean, look. They feel huge to me.

598
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:33,053
I have to go.

599
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:35,499
But this has been the breast bek...

600
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:39,038
Thank you.

601
00:46:39,185 --> 00:46:42,621
- Where are you going?
- To get my job back.

602
00:46:44,065 --> 00:46:48,343
Yeah, yeah, I am great

603
00:46:52,073 --> 00:46:54,746
Good grief! Is that what I'm driving?

604
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:07,677
Nice car, man.

605
00:47:07,837 --> 00:47:10,226
Yeah, it gets me from A to B.

606
00:47:23,518 --> 00:47:26,715
Darn. All this horsepower
and no room to gallop!

607
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,432
Hi-yo, Silver. Away!

608
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:43,534
I wouldn't want to be a fugitive

609
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,579
with Hank, Buffalo's number one
police dog, on the job.

610
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:52,300
Phil Sidleman at the police canine
training centre, Channel 5 News.

611
00:47:52,584 --> 00:47:54,575
And cut it.

612
00:48:00,258 --> 00:48:01,771
Look what the cat coughed up!

613
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:04,803
Channel 7, right?
You're the guy that went crazy.

614
00:48:05,011 --> 00:48:08,162
- I had a bad moment.
- What are you doing here?

615
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:10,505
- Looking for a story.
- No story here.

616
00:48:10,683 --> 00:48:15,040
This pond is all fished out.
Pretty standard stuff, anyway.

617
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:18,510
My instinct tells me
there's something more.

618
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:21,725
Well, go with that.
It served you well in the past, right?

619
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,947
Hank found something!

620
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,777
We got a body!

621
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:38,862
Shit. Get the camera! Now!

622
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:43,298
- It's locked! The keys are inside!
- I guess every dog has his day.

623
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,195
- Kid, you want to make $10?
- Sure.

624
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,769
- Know how to use one of these?
- Duh.

625
00:48:50,842 --> 00:48:53,231
Seems to be in tune. Let's do this.

626
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,421
The body of Jimmy Hoffa
was uncovered in a field today

627
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,676
outside a canine training centre
in Buffalo, New York.

628
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:03,362
- Bruce Nolan was first on the scene.
- Thank you, Jane.

629
00:49:03,604 --> 00:49:06,676
As you can see,
the body is being carefully exhumed

630
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:11,256
for transportation to a facility
where DNA can confirm the identity.

631
00:49:11,527 --> 00:49:14,405
That, however,
merely a formality at this point,

632
00:49:14,615 --> 00:49:20,087
as the body was found with a birth
certificate and dental records.

633
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:23,085
I'd call that a red-letter day
for any canine unit.

634
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:25,883
But was that enough for Hank?
No, siree.

635
00:49:26,082 --> 00:49:29,313
Moments later, he busted
a local news camera crew

636
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:32,739
with 220 pounds of marijuana.

637
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:35,317
I never saw it before! I swear!

638
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:40,715
I'm Bruce Nolan...

639
00:49:40,886 --> 00:49:43,719
and that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

640
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:50,426
Did you like that?

641
00:49:52,938 --> 00:49:54,769
Thank you, thank you.

642
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,851
- Hi, Bruce.
- Hi, Susan.

643
00:49:57,025 --> 00:49:59,459
Good work. I'm impressed.

644
00:50:03,698 --> 00:50:06,531
- Did you need me for something?
- Bruce!

645
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,698
Just the man I want to see.

646
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,943
- Hoffa? What are the odds of that?
- What are the odds of that?

647
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:15,278
- Bruce, why don't you sit down?
- OK.

648
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:19,088
I'm going to be straight with you.
We want you back, Bruce.

649
00:50:19,338 --> 00:50:22,728
But I want you to understand
it was not my decision to let you go.

650
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:26,501
- When the big guy gives the order...
- No harm, no foul.

651
00:50:26,716 --> 00:50:30,231
I needed to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self.

652
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,507
- You did that in a day?
- Imagine what I could do with seven.

653
00:50:34,808 --> 00:50:37,606
It is not in my power
to give you anchor.

654
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:41,121
As far as field reporting goes,
if you're looking for a bump...

655
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:44,393
Let's cut the crap
and get down to brass tacks.

656
00:50:49,488 --> 00:50:51,206
I had you going.

657
00:50:51,364 --> 00:50:53,480
Don't worry about it,
my old friend.

658
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:57,207
Just give me a camera.
I'll give you the news.

659
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:11,536
My secret is that I let the jalapenos
marinate in a spicy sauce

660
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:15,914
for at least 24 hours
before I stir it into the chilli.

661
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:18,898
Then I let it all come to a simmer.

662
00:51:23,892 --> 00:51:29,091
Hold that thought. It seems as if
an asteroid or meteorite

663
00:51:29,396 --> 00:51:33,071
has just hit ground right outside
the Mark Twain Chilli Cook-Off!

664
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:36,499
This should certainly
spice things up a bit!

665
00:51:37,237 --> 00:51:38,955
His stories are all over town.

666
00:51:39,114 --> 00:51:40,388
From unearthing Hoffa

667
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:42,523
.. to a meteor crashing,

668
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,897
.. Bruce Nolan is rapidly
becoming known as...

669
00:52:00,757 --> 00:52:04,227
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles!

670
00:52:09,016 --> 00:52:11,371
This was Bruce's idea?

671
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,872
He wanted me to have a day of beauty
and luxurious serenity.

672
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:20,968
I got to tell you,
he is impressing me lately.

673
00:52:21,191 --> 00:52:23,261
Know where he's taking me to dinner?

674
00:52:24,736 --> 00:52:26,488
Where?

675
00:52:28,365 --> 00:52:29,923
The Blue Palm?

676
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:34,822
- My gosh, I got chills.
- I know.

677
00:52:35,038 --> 00:52:38,747
He told me to prepare for the most
memorable night of our lives.

678
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:41,638
Oh, my gosh. He's going to propose.

679
00:52:41,835 --> 00:52:43,791
Oh, stop it. No. He's...

680
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:46,636
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

681
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,832
Do the math.
He sends you all day to a beauty spa,

682
00:52:50,051 --> 00:52:53,930
he's taking you to a restaurant
where you had your first date. Hello!

683
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,819
I never thought I'd say this,
but Bruce is right.

684
00:52:57,015 --> 00:52:59,210
This is your night.
Relax and enjoy it.

685
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:01,429
Oh, God.

686
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:09,047
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six,
with Susan Ortega,

687
00:53:09,276 --> 00:53:10,629
Evan Baxter,

688
00:53:10,778 --> 00:53:13,451
Fred Donohue, sports,
Dallas Coleman, weather.

689
00:53:13,654 --> 00:53:15,929
And now,
Buffalo's numberone news team.

690
00:53:16,114 --> 00:53:18,070
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six.

691
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:20,232
- I'm Susan Ortega.
- I'm Evan Baxter.

692
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:22,365
Here's what's making news.

693
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:25,767
A potential scandal
with the Buffalo PD surfaced today,

694
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:28,114
when the mayor demanded that...

695
00:53:29,252 --> 00:53:31,561
When the mayor
demanded the chief of...

696
00:53:34,547 --> 00:53:36,538
Issued a response to...

697
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,579
I seem to have something stuck in my...

698
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:41,638
Get him some water.

699
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:44,318
Looks like my new co-anchor
may need water.

700
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:51,308
There we go. Sorry.

701
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:56,234
In other news, the prime minister of
Sweden visited Washington today,

702
00:53:56,527 --> 00:53:59,564
and my tiny little nipples
went to France.

703
00:54:00,572 --> 00:54:02,688
What did he say? Check the prompter.

704
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:09,046
- The prompter's fine.
- Evan, read the copy.

705
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,963
The copy's good. Just read it.

706
00:54:11,745 --> 00:54:15,340
The White House committee
greeted the prime rib roast minister,

707
00:54:15,582 --> 00:54:18,733
and I do the cha-cha like a sissy girl.

708
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:23,393
I lika do...

709
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:25,580
da cha-cha.

710
00:54:29,846 --> 00:54:33,475
I'm sorry. We seem to be
having technical difficulties.

711
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:35,813
In other news...

712
00:54:38,853 --> 00:54:40,844
My apologies.

713
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:35,931
If I ruled the world

714
00:55:37,488 --> 00:55:41,527
Every day would be
the first day of spring

715
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:47,722
Every heart would have
a new song to sing

716
00:55:49,206 --> 00:55:54,803
And we'd sing of the joy
every morning would bring

717
00:55:56,672 --> 00:55:58,981
If I ruled the world

718
00:56:01,384 --> 00:56:04,774
Every man would be
as free as a bird

719
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:07,002
- May I?
- Certainly.

720
00:56:12,517 --> 00:56:15,350
It's perfect. She'll love it.

721
00:56:15,562 --> 00:56:19,350
We would treasure
each day that occurs

722
00:56:20,192 --> 00:56:25,869
You know, I was going to wait
until after the meal,

723
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:30,413
but it'll burst out of me
like an alien if I don't do it now.

724
00:56:31,994 --> 00:56:34,030
Oh, my God. OK.

725
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:35,922
This is it, isn't it?

726
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,833
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

727
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:43,752
I mean, I'm ready. I just didn't
know if I would... I'm sorry, go on.

728
00:56:44,046 --> 00:56:47,356
- I didn't know it was so important to you.
- Me neither.

729
00:56:51,553 --> 00:56:53,544
- Grace?
- Yes?

730
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,509
I got anchor.

731
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:05,752
No.

732
00:57:07,398 --> 00:57:11,437
Yes. Apparently it wasn't
working out with Evan,

733
00:57:11,693 --> 00:57:15,971
so he's going to finish out the week
and I go live on Monday.

734
00:57:18,116 --> 00:57:21,870
- That's great, honey.
- I know, I know.

735
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:23,713
Well...

736
00:57:26,124 --> 00:57:28,877
- So that's what this is all about.
- Well, yeah.

737
00:57:30,503 --> 00:57:31,936
We got anchor.

738
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:35,603
Jack's throwing me a party at
the Vanderbilt estate to celebrate.

739
00:57:35,841 --> 00:57:37,718
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

740
00:57:38,385 --> 00:57:41,536
Now I lay me down to sleep...

741
00:57:41,763 --> 00:57:43,640
I feel stupid.

742
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:46,526
- It is loud in here, isn't it?
- No, it's not loud.

743
00:57:46,726 --> 00:57:49,923
Jeez! Can you keep it down
to a dull roar?

744
00:57:50,146 --> 00:57:52,660
- Thank you!
- Is that supposed to be funny?

745
00:57:52,856 --> 00:57:55,529
Cos that is not funny.

746
00:57:55,734 --> 00:57:59,090
- What did you say?
- What is wrong with you? Stop yelling.

747
00:58:01,529 --> 00:58:04,521
If you'll excuse me,
I'll take a little trip to the...

748
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:06,650
Ourfather, which art in heaven...

749
00:58:06,825 --> 00:58:09,498
The wine is going right through me.

750
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:12,820
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

751
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,156
- Keep going, Tony!
- Oh, God.

752
00:58:17,752 --> 00:58:19,583
What is going on here?

753
00:58:19,754 --> 00:58:21,631
What is this?

754
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:23,788
Give me a break!

755
00:58:28,887 --> 00:58:30,878
Really something, isn't it?

756
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:35,438
Is this heaven?

757
00:58:35,601 --> 00:58:38,069
No, this is Mount Everest.

758
00:58:38,269 --> 00:58:41,227
Flip on the Discovery Channel
from time to time.

759
00:58:41,774 --> 00:58:45,210
But I guess you can't now,
being dead and all.

760
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,448
- I'm dead?
- I'm just messing with you.

761
00:58:50,031 --> 00:58:52,545
That's not funny, man!

762
00:58:54,742 --> 00:58:58,371
What about the voices in my head?
Is that part of the hilarity?

763
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:02,818
No, those are prayers. You keep ignoring
them, they're going to build up.

764
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:05,755
But it's just noise.
I can't understand them.

765
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,224
You're not listening, son.

766
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:11,697
Let's see.

767
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:15,762
You had my powers for a little over a week.
How many people have you helped?

768
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,138
I took care of a few things.

769
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:25,425
I righted a few wrongs
in my own life first. OK?

770
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,715
I was going to help the others.

771
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,889
- I think I could help the world.
- The world?

772
00:59:31,608 --> 00:59:36,159
That wasn't the world. That was just
Buffalo, between 57th and Commonwealth.

773
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:42,889
I didn't want to start you off with
more than you could handle.

774
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,395
You took the job, Bruce,
so I suggest you get to it.

775
00:59:48,165 --> 00:59:50,998
Seeing him smile
would make me so happy.

776
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:53,199
Prayers, prayers, OK.

777
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:56,704
This creepy whisper thing has to end.

778
00:59:56,879 --> 00:59:58,949
Organisation. That's what I need.

779
00:59:59,131 --> 01:00:03,044
I need a system.
Something concrete. Concentrate.

780
01:00:04,385 --> 01:00:08,617
Files. Let all prayers
be organised into files.

781
01:00:13,603 --> 01:00:18,233
That takes care of the voices.
Not exactly a space-saver, though.

782
01:00:18,524 --> 01:00:20,833
Grace might notice.

783
01:00:21,026 --> 01:00:23,335
I know. Prayer Post-its!

784
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:42,657
OK, I need something with a lock.
Security. Combination. A password.

785
01:00:44,256 --> 01:00:45,655
A password.

786
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:55,336
Welcome to the revelation
superhighway.

787
01:00:55,555 --> 01:00:58,467
We bless, no mess. Downloading now.

788
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:04,470
It's good.

789
01:01:06,565 --> 01:01:08,681
This is going to take a while.

790
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:19,210
1,527,503 prayer requests?

791
01:01:21,704 --> 01:01:23,695
I better manifest some coffee.

792
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:47,720
Now that's fresh, mountain-grown
coffee from the hills of Colombia.

793
01:02:10,163 --> 01:02:12,279
Good.

794
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:19,930
OK, I had to have made
some kind of a dent by now.

795
01:02:22,632 --> 01:02:24,623
Oh, come on!

796
01:02:26,135 --> 01:02:29,764
What a bunch of whiners.
This is going to suck up my whole life.

797
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,590
You know what?

798
01:02:35,811 --> 01:02:37,802
Yes. To all.

799
01:02:38,896 --> 01:02:42,889
Yeah. There you go.
Now everybody's happy.

800
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:55,368
I'll drink to that. My tech stocks
tripled in five days.

801
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:57,735
Know something, Joe?
You seem taller.

802
01:02:57,912 --> 01:03:00,472
- I am.
- My daughter pitched a no-hitter.

803
01:03:00,664 --> 01:03:03,656
I lost 47 pounds
on the Krispy Kreme diet.

804
01:03:03,876 --> 01:03:05,389
There he is!

805
01:03:05,544 --> 01:03:07,182
The man of the hour!

806
01:03:07,337 --> 01:03:10,932
Bless you! Bless all of you!

807
01:03:11,174 --> 01:03:15,008
Be fruitful and...
do long division or something!

808
01:03:16,178 --> 01:03:18,567
Try that. It's an excellent year.

809
01:03:18,764 --> 01:03:21,232
Bruce!
Who do you like in the game tonight?

810
01:03:21,433 --> 01:03:24,630
I like the Sabres. Coach prays a lot.

811
01:03:46,204 --> 01:03:49,002
This is Bruce, Grace and Sam.
Leave a message.

812
01:03:49,206 --> 01:03:50,878
Grace? Are you there?

813
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:52,360
Hello? It's me.

814
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:57,787
Come on, Grace. Come to the party.

815
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:00,834
I'll call you later, OK?

816
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:05,168
Come on, Sam.

817
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:10,089
Help me out here.

818
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:14,433
Sam, don't. Come on.

819
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:17,118
- Tell me.
- Ifl do, it might not come true.

820
01:04:17,315 --> 01:04:21,706
What is ityou want, Mary?
You want the moon?

821
01:04:21,986 --> 01:04:25,296
Say the word and I'll throw a lasso
around it andpull it down.

822
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:29,240
H.ey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

823
01:04:29,493 --> 01:04:31,404
I'll take it.

824
01:04:31,578 --> 01:04:34,251
- Then what?
- Then you could swallow it.

825
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:36,571
And it'd all dissolve.

826
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:39,625
Moonbeams would shoot out
ofyourfingers and toes

827
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:42,188
and the ends ofyourhair.

828
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:55,837
This is Bruce, Grace and Sam.

829
01:04:57,766 --> 01:04:59,757
Hi, Bruce.

830
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,011
What are you doing in here all alone?

831
01:05:04,188 --> 01:05:05,906
Oh, I was just going to...

832
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:08,056
I mean...

833
01:05:10,611 --> 01:05:13,205
I was going to give Grace a call.

834
01:05:13,655 --> 01:05:17,250
Yeah, I didn't see her.
So how are you and Grace doing?

835
01:05:18,452 --> 01:05:21,046
Well, actually, we had a bit of a fight.

836
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:24,545
Kind of. I'm not sure if she's...

837
01:05:24,749 --> 01:05:26,819
You're on fire, Bruce.

838
01:05:27,418 --> 01:05:29,010
Some women can't handle fire.

839
01:05:30,421 --> 01:05:32,457
Some can.

840
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:37,145
That's interesting, cos I never
thought we would ever talk...

841
01:05:57,902 --> 01:06:00,621
You might want to stop
touching me now.

842
01:06:04,992 --> 01:06:07,028
Grace, come here!

843
01:06:08,161 --> 01:06:10,152
This is weird. I was just calling you.

844
01:06:10,329 --> 01:06:12,718
And you thought Susan's mouth
was the phone?

845
01:06:13,749 --> 01:06:16,217
She kissed me. I'm the kissee.

846
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:18,375
You were putting up a big fight.

847
01:06:18,545 --> 01:06:21,013
I tried to stop her,
but she's really strong.

848
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:23,775
OK, I screwed up.
Can I make it up to you?

849
01:06:23,967 --> 01:06:26,640
Yeah. Why don't you get me a boat?

850
01:06:26,845 --> 01:06:28,517
- What?
- A big boat.

851
01:06:28,678 --> 01:06:30,555
And maybe two big bags of cash.

852
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:32,598
Then, then, I'll be happy.

853
01:06:32,765 --> 01:06:34,676
Lots of money and lots of stuff!

854
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:39,446
People want crap like getting married
or having babies with the man they love.

855
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:42,118
But not me, Bruce.
Just give me the boat.

856
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:45,508
No wonder you stayed single!

857
01:06:45,693 --> 01:06:49,686
- Don't do this.
- I'm not doing this. I'm undoing it.

858
01:06:49,948 --> 01:06:53,543
I'll be at Debbie's. Take care of Sam
until I make arrangements.

859
01:06:55,493 --> 01:06:57,484
You can't leave me.

860
01:06:59,205 --> 01:07:01,241
I'm the Alpha, lady!

861
01:07:01,415 --> 01:07:04,213
I'm the Omega, baby!

862
01:07:04,877 --> 01:07:07,311
Fine! I don't need you!

863
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:17,663
What's the matter, Bruce?
She can't handle a little competition?

864
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:21,248
Game's been called
on account of rain.

865
01:07:37,196 --> 01:07:41,155
An unusually high numberoflottery
winners has officials concerned.

866
01:07:41,409 --> 01:07:44,082
So far, 1, 100 winning tickets
have been turned in,

867
01:07:44,286 --> 01:07:47,119
all, strangely, from the Buffalo area.

868
01:07:48,289 --> 01:07:50,405
More on this story as it develops.

869
01:07:51,626 --> 01:07:53,423
Enjoying your party?

870
01:07:53,586 --> 01:07:56,817
Nothing like spending quality time
with great friends.

871
01:07:58,716 --> 01:08:02,311
- Grace left me.
- Yeah, I know.

872
01:08:02,928 --> 01:08:04,919
She'll take me back.

873
01:08:07,891 --> 01:08:10,849
- She'll take me back, right?
- Would you take you back?

874
01:08:17,441 --> 01:08:21,559
How do you make somebody love you
without affecting free will?

875
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:23,810
Welcome to my world, son.

876
01:08:23,987 --> 01:08:26,820
You come up with an answer
to that one, you let me know.

877
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,098
Rise and shine, Buffalo.

878
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,242
It's 70 and sunny and the perfect day
to forgive Bruce.

879
01:08:43,212 --> 01:08:45,203
I don't know much

880
01:08:46,465 --> 01:08:50,094
But I know I love you

881
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:55,295
- Bye.
- Have fun.

882
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:24,221
- Hi. Can I get a small coffee to go?
- Sure, hon. Just a sec.

883
01:09:24,455 --> 01:09:29,131
K- Tel Records brings you the 100
greatest love songs ofall time.

884
01:09:29,418 --> 01:09:32,728

885
01:09:32,963 --> 01:09:36,319

You Love, Then Love Bruce",

886
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:38,940
"Do That To Bruce One More Time".

887
01:09:39,178 --> 01:09:40,770
Who can forget that classic,

888
01:09:40,929 --> 01:09:44,001
"Bruce So H.orny

889
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:46,976
Order today and we'll throw in
at no extra charge

890
01:09:47,185 --> 01:09:49,301
the video "Sweatin' To Bruce".

891
01:09:49,478 --> 01:09:52,231
Just dial 1-900-FORGIVE H.IM.

892
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:55,954
That's 1-900-FORGIVE H.IM. Do it now.

893
01:10:24,299 --> 01:10:27,371
No, no! Please don't put that
in your mouth.

894
01:10:27,594 --> 01:10:28,913
That's not food.

895
01:10:29,053 --> 01:10:33,126
Go to the bathroom. Wash out your mouth.
Wash off your hands.

896
01:10:33,725 --> 01:10:36,080
That kid is gonna poop an ornament.

897
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:39,227
One more time,
you're going to be in a lot of trouble.

898
01:10:40,814 --> 01:10:42,805
All right, that's it!

899
01:10:46,027 --> 01:10:48,382
I surrender!

900
01:10:53,826 --> 01:10:55,817
Hi.

901
01:10:59,665 --> 01:11:02,657
I'm... doing my first anchor tonight.

902
01:11:02,877 --> 01:11:05,675
Oh, wow. That's great!

903
01:11:05,879 --> 01:11:09,633
- How have you been doing?
- Good.

904
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,777
- Debbie won the lottery.
- Oh, yeah? You're kidding.

905
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:21,119
But so did 400,000 other people,
so she only won like $17 or something.

906
01:11:23,434 --> 01:11:25,425
I miss you.

907
01:11:30,525 --> 01:11:32,197
I took a first step.

908
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,351
Jumped out on a ledge.

909
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:39,036
- Feeling vulnerable.
- What do you want me to say?

910
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,356
Say you want me back.

911
01:11:41,534 --> 01:11:43,764
What about all the signs?

912
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:48,120
How did you know about that?
Did you talk to Debbie?

913
01:11:48,373 --> 01:11:51,331
Would it help if I just said
I was a complete ass?

914
01:11:51,543 --> 01:11:54,979
- You said ass!
- It's OK if I'm talking about a donkey.

915
01:11:55,213 --> 01:11:57,602
I didn't say "hole". If I said ass...

916
01:11:57,799 --> 01:12:00,518
No, wait. OK, honey, let's go inside.

917
01:12:00,718 --> 01:12:03,630
All right, everybody inside.
Time to go inside.

918
01:12:06,098 --> 01:12:08,851
Please. None of this
seems right without you.

919
01:12:13,103 --> 01:12:15,173
I gotta go.

920
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:17,367
Wait!

921
01:12:23,779 --> 01:12:26,213
How do you feel now?

922
01:12:28,574 --> 01:12:31,293
Have you completely lost your mind?

923
01:12:31,786 --> 01:12:35,096
- Are you drunk?
- Yeah. Drunk with power.

924
01:12:40,418 --> 01:12:42,056
Love me.

925
01:12:49,468 --> 01:12:51,459
I did.

926
01:13:03,564 --> 01:13:05,555
Yeah, I know. Free will.

927
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:11,294
More poweroutages reported today
caused by last week's meteorite strike.

928
01:13:11,569 --> 01:13:17,519
Officials are trying to repair transformers
damaged by the ensuing electrical surge.

929
01:13:17,867 --> 01:13:19,698
The scene nearly turned violent

930
01:13:19,869 --> 01:13:24,624
when Buffalo residents protested
last week's lottery results.

931
01:13:24,915 --> 01:13:28,544
Doomsayers are pointing to
last week's strange celestial events

932
01:13:28,794 --> 01:13:33,914
as signs thatprophecy is being fulfilled
and the world may be coming to an end.

933
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,153
The world's gone mad.

934
01:13:37,302 --> 01:13:39,179
- 30 seconds to air.
- OK.

935
01:13:39,345 --> 01:13:42,143
There you are. It's your debut.
How are you feeling?

936
01:13:42,347 --> 01:13:45,384
You know what? I'm fine. Never better.

937
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,091
The show must go on right?

938
01:13:51,273 --> 01:13:54,470
- The Sabres just won the Stanley Cup.
- You're kidding me!

939
01:13:55,235 --> 01:13:57,829
Was that tonight? That's great.

940
01:13:58,028 --> 01:14:02,340
It's crazy out there. We're going to
kick live to Fred at the stadium, OK?

941
01:14:02,615 --> 01:14:05,004
- Five seconds to the open.
- This is it.

942
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,111
- You ready?
- Born that way.

943
01:14:07,285 --> 01:14:12,564
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six,
with Susan Ortega, Bruce Nolan,

944
01:14:12,873 --> 01:14:15,512
Fred Donohue, sports,
Dallas Coleman, weather.

945
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:17,619
Now Buffalo's numberone news team.

946
01:14:17,795 --> 01:14:19,786
- I'm Susan Ortega.
- I'm Bruce Nolan.

947
01:14:19,963 --> 01:14:21,954
And here's what's making news.

948
01:14:23,341 --> 01:14:25,809
- What happened?
- We lost power.

949
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:28,001
- Transformer's down again.
- Jeez.

950
01:14:28,178 --> 01:14:30,612
Ever since that damn meteorite hit.

951
01:14:32,308 --> 01:14:35,061
- We're back.
- We apologise for the interruption.

952
01:14:35,268 --> 01:14:37,384
- Back to the news. Bruce?
- Thank you.

953
01:14:37,562 --> 01:14:40,520
I'm sorry. We're going live
to HSBC Arena,

954
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:43,723
where the Buffalo Sabres
have won the Stanley Cup.

955
01:14:43,943 --> 01:14:45,262
- Great.
- Fred?

956
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:47,963
We're about to uncork
some champagne because

957
01:14:48,156 --> 01:14:52,707
the Sabres have won
their first championship in 22 years!

958
01:14:55,411 --> 01:14:56,764
What in blazes...

959
01:14:56,913 --> 01:15:01,429
We'll be back with the Sabres'
victory in just a hot second.

960
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:03,459
In other news...

961
01:15:03,626 --> 01:15:06,094
- Bloody hell!
- What is it now?

962
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:08,285
- The whole booth is down.
- It's not!

963
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:14,196
In other news, fighting erupted
in the Gaza Strip today,

964
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,547
as Israelis and Palestinians...

965
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,074
- Bruce.
- What?

966
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:21,419
We've got a situation here.
They're rioting right outside.

967
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,361
- You're kidding.
- The whole town has gone crazy.

968
01:15:29,524 --> 01:15:31,401
Go on, Bruce. Say something.

969
01:15:32,651 --> 01:15:35,848
Ladies and gentlemen, this just in.

970
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:41,972
Possibly the biggest breaking news
story this town has ever seen.

971
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:51,408
And I gotta go.

972
01:15:52,336 --> 01:15:54,327
Sorry, Jack.

973
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:57,277
Susan, it's all yours.

974
01:16:00,717 --> 01:16:02,787
Sabres!

975
01:16:02,969 --> 01:16:05,119
Sabres rule!

976
01:16:05,304 --> 01:16:07,613
Down with the lottery!

977
01:16:07,806 --> 01:16:09,956
Repent! The end is near!

978
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,111
The lottery sucks!

979
01:16:26,573 --> 01:16:28,484
I only won 17 bucks!

980
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:32,860
Channel 7 lies!

981
01:16:34,747 --> 01:16:36,624
Oh, no!

982
01:16:48,593 --> 01:16:51,107
God!

983
01:16:53,388 --> 01:16:55,379
God?

984
01:16:56,265 --> 01:16:58,256
Are you here?

985
01:17:01,061 --> 01:17:03,575
Hello? I need your help!

986
01:17:04,188 --> 01:17:06,941
Clap on!

987
01:17:14,949 --> 01:17:16,940
Figures!

988
01:17:20,161 --> 01:17:22,629
Well, hello there, Bruce Almighty.

989
01:17:25,916 --> 01:17:29,670
Not as easy as it looks, is it, son?
This God business.

990
01:17:30,838 --> 01:17:33,306
They're all out of control.

991
01:17:33,506 --> 01:17:35,576
It's me. I don't know what to do.

992
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:38,687
Well, you're right on time.
Seven o'clock.

993
01:17:42,182 --> 01:17:44,173
The 7th at 7.00.

994
01:17:58,861 --> 01:18:00,852
All righty, then.

995
01:18:03,323 --> 01:18:06,156
- There we are.
- It's good.

996
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:10,137
It's a wonderful thing.

997
01:18:10,289 --> 01:18:15,079
No matter how filthy something gets,
you can always clean it right up.

998
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:19,520
There were so many.
I just gave them all what they wanted.

999
01:18:19,755 --> 01:18:21,347
Yeah.

1000
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:25,317
But since when does anyone
have a clue about what they want?

1001
01:18:28,429 --> 01:18:30,818
So what do I do?

1002
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,678
Parting your soup is not a miracle.
It's a magic trick.

1003
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,115
A single mom who's working two jobs

1004
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:45,196
and still finds time to take her kid
to soccer practice, that's a miracle.

1005
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:49,089
A teenager who says no to drugs
and yes to an education,

1006
01:18:50,113 --> 01:18:52,104
that's a miracle.

1007
01:18:52,991 --> 01:18:55,266
People want me to do everything for them.

1008
01:18:55,452 --> 01:18:58,410
What they don't realise
is they have the power.

1009
01:18:59,872 --> 01:19:02,466
You want to see a miracle, son?

1010
01:19:02,668 --> 01:19:04,659
Be the miracle.

1011
01:19:08,088 --> 01:19:10,079
Wait. Are you leaving?

1012
01:19:10,841 --> 01:19:13,514
Yeah. I figure you can handle things now.

1013
01:19:13,718 --> 01:19:16,391
But what if I need you?
What if I have questions?

1014
01:19:16,596 --> 01:19:18,905
That's your problem, Bruce.

1015
01:19:19,098 --> 01:19:21,054
That's everybody's problem.

1016
01:19:21,225 --> 01:19:23,216
You keep looking up.

1017
01:19:27,147 --> 01:19:31,186
Orderhas been restored
after this evening's downtown riot.

1018
01:19:31,443 --> 01:19:34,116
State officials
have suspended all lottery sales

1019
01:19:34,321 --> 01:19:36,277
pending furtherinvestigation.

1020
01:19:36,448 --> 01:19:40,919
No injuries were reported in the melee,
however there were dozens ofarrests.

1021
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:30,711
OK.

1022
01:20:32,121 --> 01:20:34,032
- Thanks a million.
- Not a problem.

1023
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:36,197
God bless.

1024
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,995
Bruce giveth and Bruce... taketh away.

1025
01:20:45,255 --> 01:20:47,815
If you don't like it... mega-bite me.

1026
01:20:56,433 --> 01:20:58,583
- Evan?
- Bruce.

1027
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:06,639
I suppose you're here to gloat about
the anchor position. Go ahead.

1028
01:21:06,942 --> 01:21:08,933
Well, actually, I...

1029
01:21:10,278 --> 01:21:13,475
I just came to tell you
that I've been a royal prick.

1030
01:21:13,698 --> 01:21:16,417
The anchor position is yours.
I turned down the job.

1031
01:21:17,409 --> 01:21:19,718
And I never really congratulated you.

1032
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,571
Congratulations.

1033
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,518
Thanks, Bruce.

1034
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:30,548
In the financial world,
things are back to normal

1035
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:33,827
in what analysts are calling
a fluke market fluctuation.

1036
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:36,610
- You made the right move.
- What about you?

1037
01:21:36,802 --> 01:21:38,918
You ready to go back out there?

1038
01:21:40,053 --> 01:21:42,772
Do the cutesy stuff?
The lighter side of the news?

1039
01:21:42,973 --> 01:21:46,648
Lower and debase myself
for the amusement of strangers?

1040
01:21:46,893 --> 01:21:49,168
Yeah, I could do that.
Sounds like fun.

1041
01:21:49,353 --> 01:21:50,911
Good.

1042
01:21:51,689 --> 01:21:54,920
OK, Sammy, let's do it right.
Like all the other dogs.

1043
01:21:55,151 --> 01:21:58,666
I don't want to make you feel bad,
but they're laughing at you, pal.

1044
01:21:58,904 --> 01:22:01,020
Come on. Concentrate.

1045
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:03,348
Pump it out, if you have to.

1046
01:22:03,533 --> 01:22:05,922
What am I going to do with you?

1047
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:11,126
I know this seems kind of crazy,

1048
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:15,290
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

1049
01:22:17,795 --> 01:22:20,389
OK, Sammy. Do your thing.

1050
01:22:21,383 --> 01:22:24,341
That's it. Good boy!

1051
01:22:26,762 --> 01:22:28,480
Training my dog.

1052
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:51,310
Yes! We did it!

1053
01:22:54,077 --> 01:22:57,308
We're doing it doggy style

1054
01:22:58,831 --> 01:23:01,026
I'll alert Penthouse Forum.

1055
01:23:01,207 --> 01:23:03,198
Hi, Deb. How are you?

1056
01:23:04,127 --> 01:23:05,446
How's Grace?

1057
01:23:05,587 --> 01:23:08,306
I didn't come to chat.
I came for Grace's stuff.

1058
01:23:14,844 --> 01:23:17,563
- You need a...?
- That's OK. I've got it.

1059
01:23:24,855 --> 01:23:26,686
I don't know if she...

1060
01:23:26,857 --> 01:23:29,246
I don't know
if she wants that or not.

1061
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,352
This is full. You did all this?

1062
01:23:47,331 --> 01:23:49,640
You know what I do before I go to bed?

1063
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:53,508
I tuck my kids in, maybe have
some ice cream and watch Conan.

1064
01:23:55,505 --> 01:23:57,496
Know what Grace does?

1065
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,791
She prays.

1066
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:03,805
Most of the time for you.

1067
01:24:25,866 --> 01:24:29,097
Find Grace Connelly.

1068
01:24:32,078 --> 01:24:34,069
The woman does pray a lot.

1069
01:24:36,206 --> 01:24:38,800
Find... Grace and Bruce.

1070
01:24:40,084 --> 01:24:42,393
"Dear God,
please help Bruce find himself,

1071
01:24:42,587 --> 01:24:44,543
find contentment, find you. "

1072
01:24:44,714 --> 01:24:48,150
"Dear God, please help Bruce.
He seems to be struggling. "

1073
01:24:48,384 --> 01:24:50,340
"Dear God, give Bruce strength. "

1074
01:24:50,511 --> 01:24:52,229
"Dear God, bless Bruce. "

1075
01:24:57,184 --> 01:24:59,015
It's her.

1076
01:24:59,686 --> 01:25:02,837
Sammy, she's logging on.
She's praying right now.

1077
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:11,997
Please, God.

1078
01:25:13,699 --> 01:25:15,018
Please.

1079
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:17,115
I still love him.

1080
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:22,499
But I don't want to love him any more.

1081
01:25:22,707 --> 01:25:25,096
I don't want to hurt any more. Please.

1082
01:25:25,832 --> 01:25:27,823
Help me forget.

1083
01:25:28,669 --> 01:25:30,660
Please help me to let it go.

1084
01:25:31,921 --> 01:25:34,151
Please help me let him go.

1085
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:57,350
You win!

1086
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,950
I'm done!

1087
01:26:00,114 --> 01:26:03,789
Please! I don't want to do this any more!

1088
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:06,900
I don't want to be God.

1089
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:10,977
I want you to decide
what's right for me!

1090
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:13,926
I surrender to your will!

1091
01:26:44,318 --> 01:26:45,637
Am I...?

1092
01:26:45,778 --> 01:26:49,612
You can't kneel down in the middle
of a highway and live to talk about it.

1093
01:26:49,865 --> 01:26:51,856
But why?

1094
01:26:53,201 --> 01:26:54,793
Why now?

1095
01:26:54,953 --> 01:26:56,545
Bruce...

1096
01:26:57,538 --> 01:27:00,257
you have the divine spark.

1097
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:04,246
You have the gift for bringing joy
and laughter to the world.

1098
01:27:05,546 --> 01:27:07,537
I know. I created you.

1099
01:27:09,049 --> 01:27:11,324
- Quit bragging.
- See?

1100
01:27:11,509 --> 01:27:13,704
That's what I'm talking about.

1101
01:27:13,887 --> 01:27:15,878
That's the spark.

1102
01:27:20,807 --> 01:27:22,923
What do you want me to do?

1103
01:27:24,019 --> 01:27:25,850
I want you to pray, son.

1104
01:27:26,437 --> 01:27:29,554
Go ahead. Use them.

1105
01:27:35,488 --> 01:27:38,525
Lord, feed the hungry.

1106
01:27:38,741 --> 01:27:42,017
And bring peace to...

1107
01:27:43,662 --> 01:27:45,653
all of mankind.

1108
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:49,985
- How's that?
- Great.

1109
01:27:50,167 --> 01:27:52,840
If you want to be Miss America.

1110
01:27:53,044 --> 01:27:56,480
Now, come on.
What do you really care about?

1111
01:28:01,137 --> 01:28:03,412
Grace.

1112
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:08,381
You want her back?

1113
01:28:12,897 --> 01:28:14,888
No.

1114
01:28:16,105 --> 01:28:18,096
I want her to be happy.

1115
01:28:20,526 --> 01:28:22,881
No matter what that means.

1116
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,265
I want her to find someone

1117
01:28:25,447 --> 01:28:27,438
who'll treat her

1118
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:33,046
with all the love she deserved from me.

1119
01:28:35,873 --> 01:28:37,864
I want her to meet someone

1120
01:28:43,255 --> 01:28:45,246
who'll see her always

1121
01:28:46,508 --> 01:28:48,499
as I do now.

1122
01:28:53,222 --> 01:28:55,338
Through your eyes.

1123
01:28:56,058 --> 01:28:58,731
- Now that's a prayer.
- Yeah?

1124
01:28:59,938 --> 01:29:03,248
Yeah. It's good.

1125
01:29:08,611 --> 01:29:10,727
I'm going to get right on it.

1126
01:29:11,654 --> 01:29:13,531
Clear!

1127
01:29:13,698 --> 01:29:16,053
That didn't feel very good.

1128
01:29:17,116 --> 01:29:19,869
- Got a rhythm.
- I got a pulse.

1129
01:29:20,078 --> 01:29:23,036
- Let's get him up.
- Get the backboard and brace.

1130
01:29:33,799 --> 01:29:35,755
Welcome back.

1131
01:29:35,926 --> 01:29:38,042
You're lucky to be alive, son.

1132
01:29:38,219 --> 01:29:40,210
Someone up there must like you.

1133
01:29:55,611 --> 01:29:59,729
I hear all that stuff winds up
in a warehouse somewhere.

1134
01:30:05,703 --> 01:30:07,694
Hi, baby.

1135
01:30:09,621 --> 01:30:13,170
Oh, my God, look at you.

1136
01:30:13,749 --> 01:30:16,707
- I was such an idiot.
- It's OK.

1137
01:30:24,177 --> 01:30:26,930
I don't know what I would have done.

1138
01:30:27,888 --> 01:30:32,279
Oh, God. I swear I wanted
to be mad at you forever.

1139
01:30:44,402 --> 01:30:46,393
Now you're just showing off.

1140
01:30:57,998 --> 01:31:01,877
This is Bruce Nolan here at Buffalo's
first "Be the Miracle" blood drive.

1141
01:31:02,127 --> 01:31:04,925
It's a B-E-A-utiful day.

1142
01:31:05,128 --> 01:31:08,404
So come on down,
because the life you save could be mine.

1143
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:13,720
Let's go over here. The Kowolskis have
baked a cookie just for this occasion.

1144
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:17,002
Sure it's a creepy and a shameless plug,
but we love 'em.

1145
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:19,337
Thank you, Mama. Vol - finger, nose.

1146
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,706
I will have given blood
twice this week.

1147
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:26,090
For those of you who haven't heard,

1148
01:31:26,271 --> 01:31:29,741
I'd like to introduce you
to the future Mrs Exclusive.

1149
01:31:29,983 --> 01:31:33,020
Grace Connelly. There she is.

1150
01:31:33,236 --> 01:31:36,546
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?

1151
01:31:37,865 --> 01:31:41,778
She just gave blood and she still
has enough left to fill up her face.

1152
01:31:42,035 --> 01:31:45,789
Yes, behind every great man,
there's a woman rolling her eyes, folks.

1153
01:31:46,038 --> 01:31:50,429
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News
reminding you to...

1154
01:31:50,711 --> 01:31:53,544
Be the miracle!

1155
01:31:54,589 --> 01:31:56,022
You heard 'em.

1156
01:31:56,174 --> 01:31:59,325
- OK, cut it. Thank you, Bruce.
- Thanks, Ally.

1157
01:32:02,802 --> 01:32:06,112
- How was that?
- Great. That was really great.

1158
01:32:06,347 --> 01:32:08,656
Now go over there.
The nurse is waiting.

1159
01:32:08,849 --> 01:32:11,044
- Do I have to?
- Oh, it's not going to hurt.

1160
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:13,615
In fact, I think you'll find it pleasurable.

1161
01:32:14,104 --> 01:32:15,822
Baby.

1162
01:33:13,031 --> 01:33:17,946
Who can take a rainbow,
wrap it in a sock

1163
01:33:18,245 --> 01:33:23,399
Soak it in the sun
and make a groovy lemon pie?

1164
01:33:29,587 --> 01:33:31,623
Oh, Jesus.

1165
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:34,122
I'm sorry.

1166
01:33:34,258 --> 01:33:38,137
I'm a very rare blood type. I'm AB positive.

1167
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,211
Sounds delicious.

1168
01:33:44,143 --> 01:33:46,896
Well, there are storehouses
all over the world

1169
01:33:47,103 --> 01:33:50,493
with tons of stuff on ice, and...

1170
01:33:51,524 --> 01:33:54,163
- Sorry.
- You were like this. Sorry, go on.

1171
01:33:56,109 --> 01:33:58,304
Positive, IB positive... Sorry.

1172
01:33:58,486 --> 01:34:00,477
I have a rary...

1173
01:34:02,198 --> 01:34:04,189
She has a rary!

1174
01:34:04,366 --> 01:34:06,721
I have a very rare blood type.

1175
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:08,468
I'm AB negative.

1176
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:10,611
- I'm IB positive.
- Am I AB negative?

1177
01:34:10,789 --> 01:34:12,825
I don't know what you are any more.

1178
01:34:13,376 --> 01:34:17,085
I'm going to need a frickin' miracle
to get to work on time.

1179
01:34:39,941 --> 01:34:41,738
That'll work.

1180
01:34:41,901 --> 01:34:45,735
Other stories in the...

1181
01:34:49,741 --> 01:34:53,051
The prime minister of Sweden
visited Washington today,

1182
01:34:53,284 --> 01:34:56,594
and in other...

1183
01:34:58,372 --> 01:35:00,408
In other...

1184
01:35:01,749 --> 01:35:03,740
In other news...

1185
01:35:07,965 --> 01:35:10,354
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness No...

1186
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:15,001
Eyewitness Nose.

1187
01:35:15,763 --> 01:35:17,754
And clear!

1188
01:35:18,349 --> 01:35:20,340
Be the miracle!

1189
01:35:20,517 --> 01:35:22,508
That's right!
