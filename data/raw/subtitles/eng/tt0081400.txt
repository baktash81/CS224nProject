2
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:17,155
I don't  like any about
- neither do i.

3
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,293
The president is right, they need to be told.
- we go public on this thing,what did.

4
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:24,911
Nobody is talking about going public.
- It is secret or not secret.

5
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,490
You can trust these people.
- I don't trust any body.

6
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:31,177
This Russian thing its paper whole
project blow sky high.

7
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,489
Let us worry about that
when it happens.

8
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,486
Jesus, i can't believe it happens.

9
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,388
Let me get this straight.

10
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:47,045
You're saying there's an American on the island of Svardlov,
and you can not locate it.

11
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:50,567
And where the hell this Svardlov?
- there's a small island near the Arctic circle.

12
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:53,791
Well every country has done an exploration,
there claim for its own.

13
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:56,966
The Russians even put their troops,
time to time

14
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:01,701
And now you're telling us, you've lost this man
and you may've lost them to some Russians.

15
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:03,938
Telling you we have a diviation
with plan.

16
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,713
A man is four days over due
at the pickup point.

17
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,393
Why don't you let us handle it.
We do that kind of stuff all the time.

18
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:13,174
Man had to be a mining engineer.
- So why're  you telling us now?

19
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:16,855
Because If there is an incident
We'll need all the help we can get.

20
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:21,255
Gentlemen, if you follow me.- How the hell
that we get ourself into a crap like this?

21
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:23,796
I've engineer this thing
and I will take the blame.

22
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:26,312
What is this project, Jim?
- The Sicilian Project.

23
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:29,092
We believe it could be
The ultimate defense system.

24
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:33,368
I know you all familiar with laser technology,
that's what we involved with .

25
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,718
Each one of those lights is a power station.
Each station, when activated ...

26
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,459
will project a beam
from ground to infinity.

27
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,719
These beams finally connect make
an invisible screen, like a wall.

28
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:49,415
No missile can penetrate it.
- Is this theory you talking about, or does it work?

29
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:51,306
Yes It works.
There is only one problem.

30
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:56,121
In order to install the system to make it function
we need a self contain power source a large one.

31
00:06:56,554 --> 00:07:01,252
The success of our project is depends upon our
locating a specific mineral, byzanium.

32
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:04,654
Byzanium?
I never never heard of it.

33
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:09,143
I surprises,very few people have it.
- And you think there may be some one Svardlov is that it?

34
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:11,995
That's all we think.
- so we sent a man in.

35
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:15,586
Hope you get him out,
because if you don't, if the Russians pick him up...

36
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,954
We're  going to be scraping on Kremlin next for five years.

37
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:11,239
Washington Central, this is Unit 23
Requesting toll service at Jefferson Memorial.

38
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:23,305
The Sicilian Project?
- Yes, captain that's what KGB calls it.

39
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,821
Would you read me that report again?
please.

40
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:33,072
Americans interested in rare minerals,
may be related to military operations.

41
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:36,402
Code name, The Sicilian Project.
- What could be so precious...

42
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:39,948
that Americans risk this kind of adventure?

43
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:43,845
Are you a chess player?

44
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:48,432
I played it when i was a student Why?

45
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,788
Do you know Isaac Boleslavsky?

46
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:56,796
Of course I know him.
He was a great chess master.

47
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,017
May be the greatest of them all.

48
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:05,078
Many of the significant variations in the game
were invented by Boleslavsky ...

49
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,550
and one of them
was called the Sicilian Defense.

50
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:15,158
All right , Marganin, lets leave it for now.
we talk again Tomorrow .

51
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:37,600
You know, there wasn't for Dirk Pitt we were be back at square one
and that mining engineer

52
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,910
who streached out dead on a Russian island.
- Who is Dirk Pitt?

53
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:44,706
All of Suddenly he's involved  in The Sicilian Project
not never heard of him.

54
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,541
Used to be a Navy man.

55
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:50,167
After his service he took early retirement
and since then he and i have tackle quiet a few things together.

56
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:54,241
He works for you?
- well Sometimes he does, sometimes not.

57
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:56,513
Depends on the job.

58
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,929
Looks like something that can't be done,
chances are take a crack at it .

59
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,763
Otherwise dump down.

60
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:03,890
You mean he only works when he feels like it.
yes it right.

61
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:07,514
Pardon my expression,at him
but it sounds like pain in the ass.

62
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:20,023
Welcome home.

63
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,217
Good to see you.

64
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:25,304
Bring a stretcher.
Where are you going?

65
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:28,303
See the man you brought in.
- Later.

66
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:31,186
How is he?
- lousy. he got a hole in him that big.

67
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:35,496
We have patched him up before we left Norway, but he
has lost lot of blood and was fainted flat.

68
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,691
He still talk can he?
I have to ask him some questions.

69
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:42,531
May be you didn't understood me.
we've  to get this guy to the hospital as fast as we can.

70
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:44,919
Come on, Gene. We go.

71
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,799
The mine had been empty he said, but he was sure
byzanium there once.

72
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:00,797
They took out five hundred pounds,
maybe half a ton that stuff.

73
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,882
That means Russians got it.

74
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:06,202
No, he said mine was worked by Americans.

75
00:12:06,303 --> 00:12:08,777
He found tools
and equipments that was shipped from Colorado ...

76
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:13,921
and a copy of
Rocky Mountain News with a date of 1911.

77
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:17,774
1911?
- And he found a corpse frozen stiff.

78
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:21,297
Someone had the burned his name into on wood
and left it with the body.

79
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,621
This is Sergeant Jake Hobart,
United States Army ...

80
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:28,939
frozen in a storm,
February 10, 1912.

81
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:33,887
Are you telling me the army sent a guy up there  seventy years ago
to get a half a ton of byzanium?

82
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:36,982
I am not telling you anything, I am just repeating
which Koplin told me.

83
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,629
What happened to you?
gave up only three hours ago.

84
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:54,423
I was stopped. Sorry.

85
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:59,904
The expression on your face like.
it look like somebody has stole your candy.

86
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,918
I wish I could tell you.

87
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:07,592
Just give me the head lines,
you got the names and places.

88
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:09,719
Can i even do that.

89
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:12,195
I thought you were a nice,

90
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:14,604
a scholar and a scientist ...

91
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:17,561
home at six ,pipe and slippers.

92
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,026
Now you suddenly turned into Charlie Chan.

93
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:22,287
This is not funny.

94
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:24,777
Who said it was funny?
I said that it was funny?

95
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:27,272
There is just solid five years of work
they toilet flushed.

96
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:33,559
Have you ever heard
from someone named Dirk Pitt?

97
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,047
Who?
- Dirk Pitt.

98
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,230
Ring a bell?

99
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:40,715
No i don't think so.
Why do you ask?

100
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:43,874
Oh,its just a name.
its not important.

101
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:53,080
Well there is little life
in that old guy after all.

102
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:58,796
You got to put the worm on the hook.

103
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:02,642
No i can't do that part
- What kind of a fisher person are you?

104
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:06,719
I'm a dynamite fisher person.
I just can't put the worm in the hooky.

105
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:19,537
Very Funny.

106
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,498
I have got a bad conscience.

107
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,526
I told a lie.
- What about?

108
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:34,280
About Dirk Pitt.
I do know him.

109
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:38,593
I met him when I first came to Washington.
He was with the Navl intelligence there.

110
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:41,502
Why didn't you tell me  you do not know?
- I do not know.

111
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:47,124
I guess you took me by surprise.
I havn't heard his name for long time.

112
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:51,028
You date with him?
- No, nothing like that.

113
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:55,133
Now, he was too high for me.

114
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:00,531
What does that mean?
- Just that . He takes up all the air in a room.

115
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,071
Dirk Pitt.What kind of a name is that?

116
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:09,660
Sounds like a pirate.

117
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:27,359
Dr Seagram?
Are you Dr Seagram?

118
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:35,104
I must bring you back to Washington,
Admiral Sandecker orders .

119
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,652
I don't believe it.
you got to be kidding.

120
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:42,234
How did he know we were here?
- I told him.

121
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:45,664
Brilliant. we'll bring him with us next time.

122
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:05,621
The Hobart file  mention the name Brewster,
Arthur Brewster ...

123
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,083
A con man and a minning expert.

124
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,502
In 1910 he discovered byzanium on the island of Svardlov
and he took at right to the U.S army.

125
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,370
Even then he saw it might have
military possibilities.

126
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:19,227
So they gave him some money and some army engineers
to help...

127
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:21,131
and he hired a Norwegian whaler.

128
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:25,472
The ship delievers Brewster, Jake Hobart
and rest of the Colorado minners to the island.

129
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:28,741
Makes a date to pick him up after
they have mined the byzanium.

130
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:31,783
What happened?
- The ship picked them up on schadule.

131
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:37,508
The only problem was two days out of sailing
they spot a Russian cruiser tailing them.

132
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,795
But Brewster sticks to his plan
and the whaler drops him off ...

133
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:45,427
on the coast of Scotland , north of Aberdeen
and they started by land.

134
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:49,631
Plan was to get the ore to Southampton
and send it home by commercial ship.

135
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:51,464
Did they make it?

136
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:54,456
They gave them pretty good shots,
but the Russian agents comming on their heels.

137
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:58,075
They fought the running gun battle all the way
from Aberdeen to Southampton.

138
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,759
Some how, Brewster made it
and he have the ore with him .

139
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,684
What happened to the other men?
- All dead, except one ...

140
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,629
a man named Southby.

141
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:10,634
Matter of fact,the final report Brewster
sent home to the U.S army, was only ...

142
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:13,605
thank God for Southby.
- then what?

143
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:17,939
He put the ore in a vault
and he saw how it was loaded into the ship.

144
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:25,159
And on April 10th, 1912 the ship sailed.

145
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,638
Southampton to New York?
Right.

146
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,281
Brewster started home on the Titanic.

147
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:47,692
So that's where we are.

148
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:51,008
Spent five years on research
and development ...

149
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:53,261
we come from bad to worse.

150
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,030
We need 200 ounces of minerals
we can't find ...

151
00:17:58,131 --> 00:17:59,983
and if we do find
where is it?

152
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:03,043
Its at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

153
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:08,941
But atleast we know where it is now,its now just some  place
its in one spot,waiting for us to come and get.

154
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:13,271
You're talking about 12,500 feet under water,
more than two miles down.

155
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:16,243
We can't get divers down that deep.

156
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:19,329
That's right sir, we can't get the divers
down to the Titanic.

157
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,926
Which leaves us with only one choice.
- And what's that?

158
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:26,928
We don't go to the mountain,
the mountain comes to us.

159
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,889
Are you talking about raising the Titanic.?

160
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:38,693
yeah.

161
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:45,754
Can it be done?
The ship that big, down that deep?

162
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,500
Its never done before, no question about that.

163
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,799
But we did raise that nuclear submarine
a couple of year ago.

164
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:57,538
That was not nearly as large
and was third on the depth.

165
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:59,893
Admiral, I am not saying
that's gotta be easy.

166
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:03,962
The chance of success is low and the cost
will be high. But it is not impossible.

167
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,334
If we get full cooperation from the navy.

168
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:12,414
What if you did have navy cooperation
and you get the funding?

169
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:16,528
we would have a chance.
lots of  problems and lots of risks.

170
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:20,618
We have submarsibles that can go down that deep
but we do not know for how long.

171
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:24,379
We've other in developing
they can go even deeper.

172
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:28,427
but they have not been tested
so every trip would be a gamble.

173
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:31,197
But if we're lucky ...

174
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:34,903
We could make nuclear warfare obsolete.

175
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,414
What about a, Jim?
- It would be a stunner.

176
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:45,788
The biggest marine salvage operation
any body's heard of.

177
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:48,520
Dirk says he can handle it

178
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:53,150
I am willing to go to the president
do my best to push him through.

179
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:02,590
Seems we are back to you, captain Pitt.

180
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:06,389
Well like Jim said ...

181
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:10,795
it is the biggest job with the highest stakes
anybody ever dreamed of.

182
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,844
How can you turn it down?

183
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:42,993
Have any time for an old friend?

184
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:46,125
I don't believable this.

185
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:50,197
My God. Where did you from?
- i don't know.

186
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,394
Well as you can see, nothing surprises me. I am ...

187
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:57,335
perfectly calm and under control.

188
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:03,084
Come on, lets go have a cup of coffee.
- I can not, I'm late ...

189
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:05,437
I've dropping somebody of.

190
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:11,569
He is not good enough for you.

191
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:17,446
You never thought anybody was good enough for me,
including for yourself.

192
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:19,498
I was right.

193
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,219
You look treffic.
- Thank you.

194
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:32,086
So to you. I thought you had left Washington
so what do you do?

195
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:35,396
Fooling around.
- don't give me that. You were gotta fix the world.

196
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:41,006
Yes, but it was five years ago.
I discovered that they had me out numbered.

197
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,516
Not you. I don't believe that.
- you can believe it.

198
00:21:45,926 --> 00:21:49,316
Well I got to go.
It's good to see you.

199
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:51,136
Goodbye.
- take care.

200
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:20,376
Funny, you don't look like a scientist.

201
00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:24,893
How a scientist suppose to look like?

202
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:29,195
I don't know, but when I would see you walking on the street,
I think you ...

203
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:31,505
a country club tennis player.

204
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:34,442
I never take you for a scientist.

205
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:37,457
Well That makes us even.
I wouldn't take you for a pirate.

206
00:22:45,306 --> 00:22:48,915
Here he comes
That did not take long.

207
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,595
It never takes long to say no.

208
00:22:57,108 --> 00:23:01,943
Now it does not takes long to say yes either.
- yeah. We'll see.

209
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,391
Good afternoon, Admiral.

210
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:15,801
We're in buisness.

211
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,854
Good to see you again. How are you doin?
- Good.

212
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,684
Don't try to hide behind that beard ...

213
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,534
I know you any place
- It just keeping me warm.

214
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:38,035
They warned me,you're
the boss of this operation ...

215
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:41,565
As he told you what we after this time?
I don't know no idea. Silent sam .

216
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:44,766
That's allright, i like that,
i get us there.

217
00:23:45,397 --> 00:23:48,037
I'll keep the coffee hot
and you two can handle the tricky stuff.

218
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:51,489
What makes you think there gone be some tricky stuff?
- it has to be.

219
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,641
Nobody hires you for your good looks.

220
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,995
Sorry. This is Dr Seagram.
Captain Joe Burke and Chief Walker.

221
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:03,710
Good to meet you.

222
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:06,520
What's operation here.
- Yes, we got some nice toys.

223
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:13,551
I was thinking, I may be able to speed things up by feeding
all navy navigational and meteorological data ...

224
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:17,271
in my computer database.
- I know that sounds very interesting.

225
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:20,436
Good. You can reach me through out
Admiral Sandecker at the office.

226
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:26,079
Fine. now If you'll excuse me,
I have got three days work to do before lunch.

227
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,820
Bye, Dirk.
see you later, take it easy.

228
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:32,444
Let us first set some things right.

229
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:35,225
This is Captain Burke's operation ...

230
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:39,877
He is an extremly competent navy officer
and I don't think he needs your help.

231
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:43,241
As for me, I took this job
on two conditions.

232
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:47,888
One, that I handle a salvage end of it my way,
and two, that you stay out of my way.

233
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,649
Will you remember that?
- If you're trying to make me  so appear, it won't work.

234
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:56,089
This project is too important.
- good, let's keep that in mind

235
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:03,328
The royal mail ship Titanic.

236
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:08,404
Where is she now and how do we
get her up? That is our problem.

237
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:11,764
This was her course, that orange line.

238
00:25:12,454 --> 00:25:15,548
A southwest track from Southampton
to her final radio position .

239
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:23,514
Latitude at 41 degrees 46 minutes north, longitude 50 degrees
15 minutes west.that's where she sank.

240
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,718
Did the two rescue ships
report conflicting positions?

241
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:28,663
That's right.

242
00:25:28,717 --> 00:25:31,032
You can see more clearly,
here in this inlargement.

243
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:35,333
The Titanic thought she was here,
Carpathia had her here and Mount Temple here.

244
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,137
So this will be our starting point right,
in the middle of this triangle.

245
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,178
So one way,or another we are in the nball park.

246
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,668
The trouble is sir,could winned up being a demn
big ball park .

247
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:48,440
We're talking about miles under water,
maybe more.

248
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:51,416
Everything at that depth, is a mystery.

249
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:54,858
That how could a wound up couple of miles
from where she disappeared.

250
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:57,312
Or ten.
- Let's hope not.

251
00:25:58,543 --> 00:26:01,661
Dr. Silverstein group will be handling
, the location problems.

252
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:06,382
Our submarsables will work in concentric
circles around that point, as targeted.

253
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,341
Let me emphasize again the importance
of  security.

254
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:14,621
Only those who need to know
have been briefed of this operation.

255
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:19,619
You will be operating under the direct control of the CNO here,
through Cinclant Fleet.

256
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:23,024
Any further questions? Admiral?

257
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,515
All right, thank you very much,
gentlemen, that's all.

258
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:36,109
We got all the stuff from the White Star Line,
engineering drawings and a complete stuctural design for the Titanic.

259
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,440
Good. how about a crew list,yes we got that too
- and i think may be we lucked out .

260
00:26:40,911 --> 00:26:43,371
One of the survivors is a man named Bigalow.

261
00:26:43,392 --> 00:26:49,441
He was junior third officer in charge of cargo
and he is living in England, some place in Cornwall.

262
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:10,869
Its an odd thing you know. i had a few ships
shot out under me, more than my share.

263
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:16,630
Three in the war of 1914-1918
and two in 1939-1945 ...

264
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:20,877
but all any body ever asked,
me about the Titanic.

265
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,412
And now I am doing the same thing.
- And you're lucky you came to the right man.

266
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,159
As I said, it was cargo hold number nine.

267
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:32,592
D-deck on port side.

268
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:35,441
you sure of that location?
- No question about it.

269
00:27:35,562 --> 00:27:38,156
We all saw that vault, when it was loaded on board.

270
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:42,271
And we saw the passenger who owned it.
not lightly to forget him...

271
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:45,462
a bushy beard and eyes like a fox.

272
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:50,083
Even if he had got a gun at me the
way he did, I would remember him.

273
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:53,664
The gun buisness. You said  that happened
when the Titanic was already goin down?

274
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:57,483
Lifeboats in the water,
only half filled ...

275
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:01,675
people scrambling all over.
it was pitiful.

276
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:05,602
I was on my way up to the boat deck
to give a hand ...

277
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:10,126
When this crazy little fellow
shoved a gun in my face.

278
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:13,606
Wanted to go to cargo hold number nine ...

279
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:18,766
and if i wouldn't take him,
he shoot me in my tracks.

280
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,754
That's what he said.

281
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,526
Well i was a young fellow than...

282
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:26,808
Wanted to live as long as i could,
So I took him.

283
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:34,365
When turned down number nine was the only hold
not already flooded.

284
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:39,690
Once he got in there spoted what he was looking for,
He was happy.

285
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:46,994
When I have nightmares about that lovely ship
going down i always see that crazy old man with the gun.

286
00:28:47,836 --> 00:28:50,315
That was the last time you saw him,
there in the hold?

287
00:28:50,456 --> 00:28:52,573
That's right.he wouldn't leave.

288
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:58,091
He went up to that vault of his, a huge thing ...

289
00:28:58,718 --> 00:29:04,396
8 foot square, and that he did as if he was the dog,
muttering to himself.

290
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:09,401
You remember what he said?
- same thing over and over.

291
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,228
Thanks to God for ...

292
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:15,896
Southby. Thank God for Southby.

293
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:23,406
Its must be a pretty quiet life for a man like you

294
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,836
God help a man who can't live by himself.

295
00:29:27,343 --> 00:29:30,654
We all end up in a single way,
sooner or later.

296
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:43,263
There he is, the owner himself.

297
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:45,749
I had already missed you.

298
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:49,256
What do you want a whiskey or a nice point of bitter?
- just a moment, Sarah.

299
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:55,546
This is Sarah Martin Dale , a women of substance,
a beauty and a worm heart.

300
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:58,912
And this is Captain Pitt,
of the United States navy.

301
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:00,997
Retired, like myself.

302
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,859
Retired might Early , if I may say so.

303
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,100
Keep your hands off him sarah
and give us two large pink gin.

304
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:11,821
Full measure and don't skim.

305
00:30:12,512 --> 00:30:14,351
Sarah talk big ...

306
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:18,633
fact is she is frightened silly of men.

307
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:29,627
Those of us who know her best,
suspect she still a maiden.

308
00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:32,714
My God, the man's got off.

309
00:30:34,356 --> 00:30:36,174
Come along to the rear.

310
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:51,017
This is my Titanic collection.

311
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,819
All its left,
in memories.

312
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:01,432
What a lovely thing she was

313
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:07,797
standing as high in the water.
is one of your skyscrapers.

314
00:31:08,343 --> 00:31:10,452
Longer than two football fields ...

315
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:14,494
And furnishing to mach the finest mentions
in England.

316
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:22,583
She was one of her kind,
no question about it ...

317
00:31:23,746 --> 00:31:26,658
And God himself, they said,
couldn't sink her.

318
00:31:27,906 --> 00:31:30,023
Then in two hours she was gone...

319
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:35,227
and fifteen hundred souls with her.

320
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:56,385
I took the flag of her before she was gone.

321
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,667
If you manage to bring her up again ...

322
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:11,864
May be you put it back,
where it belongs.

323
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:15,117
Control, this is deep Quest at 8000 feet,
searching section 22.

324
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:19,122
Visibility fair, negative contact. Out.

325
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:24,847
This is Turtle, depth 9200 feet.
No contact. Out.

326
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:34,048
This is Starfish at 10000 feet,
conducting sonar search section 24. No contacts.

327
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:59,566
Depth?
- 11420 feet.

328
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:03,485
6000 pound per square inch.

329
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:07,315
One of these days the water gonna squash us
like bug.

330
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:11,359
What are you grumble about, Marker?
- There are plenty of reasons to grumble.

331
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:15,695
Hang Around down here in this chunk canned
Looking for what?

332
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:18,248
We're looking for what ever is down here

333
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,559
Guys, i just spoil your fun,
we're going up. Pitt's comming in.

334
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,696
Oh Good, maybe he found
what he was looking for.

335
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:54,096
Marine Air Base One to Three.

336
00:34:54,866 --> 00:34:56,671
Three Marine.

337
00:34:57,427 --> 00:35:01,022
Wind direction 220 degrees with 18 knots.

338
00:35:02,508 --> 00:35:04,703
Roger. 220 to 18 knots.

339
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:10,237
Helo three you're cleared

340
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,104
Any thing happened down there?
- No, nothing yet.

341
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:22,030
Which brings up a point, I think
the sub crew should be told what they're looking for..

342
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:25,343
Helps moral.
- It sounds like a good idea.

343
00:35:26,112 --> 00:35:31,025
Why don't we hold a briefing this afternoon?
- We have a visitor. did you notice?

344
00:35:31,473 --> 00:35:36,432
Yeah, I spotted a the Russian flag as we comming in.
- looks like a marine research vessel.

345
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:40,078
I means its only may be got a half of dozen gun cruise
men on board.

346
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:41,957
They're just nosing around.

347
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:44,795
They don't know not what we are looking for.
- Not yet, anyway.

348
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:53,716
Deep Quest, this is Star Fish.
have Sonar Contact in section 26 at depth 12700 feet.

349
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,080
Request permission to investigate.

350
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:00,098
This is Deep Quest. Negative.
Maintain present depth.

351
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,714
You are only certified to 12000 feet.
We will checked it out.

352
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:59,769
Here Turtle, 3470 meter depth.
Section 23 searched without contact.

353
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:06,510
Starfish, this is Deep Quest. request you conduct sonar
search section 33 at maximum depth of 12000 feet.

354
00:37:09,012 --> 00:37:12,085
This is Starfish. Roger. Out.

355
00:37:34,697 --> 00:37:39,328
This is Starfish, approaching 12000 feet.
contiinuing sonar search over.

356
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:44,613
This is Control do not exceed 12000 feet depth limit.. Out.

357
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:07,753
Lieutenant.

358
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,233
Control, this is Star Fish.

359
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:19,129
Bridge Control.
- This Bridge.

360
00:38:20,146 --> 00:38:23,536
Star Fish reprts she is flooding.
We're trying to get more information.

361
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:30,183
Release the batteries pass.
- Batteries pass away.

362
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:40,459
Control, this is Star Fish, we fill up,
we try to surface.

363
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:44,531
I repeat, this is Starfish, we flooding,
we try to surface.

364
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:50,040
We are broken.

365
00:38:51,992 --> 00:38:53,796
Starfish, this is control .

366
00:38:55,312 --> 00:38:57,587
We lost contact.
Where is Turtle?

367
00:38:57,773 --> 00:39:00,207
In a water 11000 feet, heading
through the Starfish position.

368
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,767
This is Turtle.
We have Starfish visual contact.

369
00:39:23,558 --> 00:39:25,548
She is going down fast,
they got to lose the weight.

370
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,938
We have taken too much of water.
- Press the panic switch, release the ball.

371
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,790
Release the ball .
- That I try.

372
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:13,243
Control, Star Fish is just imploded.
Request permission to surface.

373
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:16,417
Yes, Klink.

374
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:21,094
Come on up.

375
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:54,874
Doctor Silverstein and I have
Reviewed the data.

376
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:57,435
Oh bullshit. I've heard that story a dozen times.

377
00:40:57,536 --> 00:41:02,495
While you were busy here screwing around with your computers
We been out there for five weeks we had found nothing.

378
00:41:03,017 --> 00:41:05,008
Meanwhile, I just lost three men.

379
00:41:05,177 --> 00:41:07,373
I think they found the answer,now Dirk.

380
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:10,107
Go on.

381
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:16,178
The new projections based on a theory that all the
reported positions were slightly off  and most important

382
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,929
We failed to take into account that smoke stuck

383
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,299
cracked  it off the Titanic went dwn.

384
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:29,131
We built a scale model of the titanic,
Perfectly weighted and balanced in exact propation.

385
00:41:29,802 --> 00:41:34,902
In two hundred experiments ranged road
Down no more than one tenth of a degree ...

386
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:38,176
and it landed exactly
where your submarsbles have been looking.

387
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:43,543
Then we did it without smoke chimney
we hit a completely different position.

388
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:54,826
Four hundred times we repeated this process ...

389
00:41:55,027 --> 00:41:58,407
and every time it landed within inch
same spot .

390
00:41:58,508 --> 00:42:00,310
Every single time.

391
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:17,250
This we read of the titanic
almost 10 miles south east lies.

392
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:21,711
10 miles.
- We got to move the entire salvage operation to this new location.

393
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:26,362
That's  not got be too easy change,
can't leave fog over 10 miles of ocean.

394
00:42:26,382 --> 00:42:30,614
For all we know the Titanic could be dead center
in area we by passing

395
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:33,143
If it is, we'll find it
if we work way back  .

396
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,984
Find it as we are back ...
- We better take the  gamble.

397
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:38,127
We can't do any worse than we're doing.

398
00:42:38,275 --> 00:42:41,870
I know I'm right
about this new position. I'm sure of it.

399
00:42:42,636 --> 00:42:44,445
I hope so.

400
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:49,476
Not a couple of weeks under water and the
submarsble crew will come after you with a hunting spear.

401
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,396
Looks like we passed something metalic.
The metal detector gives a signal.

402
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,575
Ok stay on itl.
Give us a fix.

403
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:18,542
There. just below us.
- Roger, now we hoover here.

404
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:21,462
Stay on the magnetometer.
Report if you see anything.

405
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:28,484
Wait a minute.
- What, have you saw something?

406
00:43:29,045 --> 00:43:32,741
Yes i think so, but its got three o clock.
See that funny shape there?

407
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:36,995
It is clamped between two rocks.
ok stand by , we will use the mechanical arm.

408
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,176
Here we come.

409
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,379
Got it.

410
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:04,101
What it is?

411
00:44:05,372 --> 00:44:07,183
Looks like some kind of horn.

412
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:11,775
May I, Doctor Bird?
- Yes, certainly.

413
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:14,183
Please.

414
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:19,528
Presented the Graham Farley
by the grateful management of the White Star Line.

415
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:24,034
Now the white Star did some checking through
their records and it turns out that Graham Farley ...

416
00:44:24,135 --> 00:44:28,335
Was the  musician for three years on a ship,
called Olympic. Then he was transferred.

417
00:44:29,177 --> 00:44:32,613
Graham Farley was cornet player in the Titanic's
orchestra.

418
00:44:32,777 --> 00:44:36,767
Are you sure?
- No question, its all documented.

419
00:44:36,938 --> 00:44:40,140
That means we're looking in the right place,
Atleast we're getting close.

420
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:42,978
It also means that the Titanic
must be in excellent condition.

421
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:45,199
Wait a minute, don't break
out the champagne yet.

422
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,009
We step in the right direction,
but we're not looking for cornets ...

423
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,809
That's we're looking for a ship 900 feet long
we still can't find it.

424
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,831
Where the hell is she?
she disappear?

425
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:02,066
Very disturbing.

426
00:45:02,183 --> 00:45:05,183
Are all these sources totally reliable?
- Absolutely.

427
00:45:05,384 --> 00:45:07,773
Is such a defense system possible?

428
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:11,256
Put that question to our
military scientists in Moscow.

429
00:45:11,905 --> 00:45:16,457
They say it is feasible,but it would
take very strong power source.

430
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:20,136
And you say that power source
locked in a cargo hold of the Titanic?

431
00:45:20,186 --> 00:45:21,996
All signs points to it.
I believe it.

432
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:32,297
Bridge, radio.
- Bridge i, we hear.

433
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:35,825
Captain, we picking up interference on the VHF.

434
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,381
Roger. you take me on?
yes sir

435
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:42,345
There's not much pattern to it,sounds like
static. It is only on 1 frequency.

436
00:45:42,831 --> 00:45:45,026
Keep on it.
call me back when it stops.

437
00:45:47,072 --> 00:45:50,721
What the hell is all about?
- picking up some kind of a strange inteferance at night.

438
00:45:51,152 --> 00:45:54,331
Carpentar hear it too,
but not as clearly as we do.

439
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,880
They all crazy on Seacliff.
They have found something.

440
00:46:34,881 --> 00:46:37,272
I've no idea, but the
big bounce in sonar

441
00:46:39,722 --> 00:46:41,530
Seacliff, its Pitt. What's up?

442
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:46,721
This is Seacliff. I think we're smelling something.
Running through the metal detector.

443
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:48,686
Good, stay out there.
We are coming over.

444
00:47:07,647 --> 00:47:10,845
Seacliff, this is Deep Quest.
We having in sight at 9 o clock.

445
00:47:11,168 --> 00:47:15,001
This is Seacliff. Roger.you have
sonar contact with the target?

446
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:18,121
Roger. Come in strong and getting stronger.

447
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:25,379
There it is.
Straight ahead.

448
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,902
Bohannon, can you identify?

449
00:47:46,015 --> 00:47:49,405
No idea what it is,
There are about ten layers of marine animals.

450
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:02,167
It is a smoke stack(chimney).
- Cool.

451
00:48:26,722 --> 00:48:28,532
Bulls eye.

452
00:48:28,543 --> 00:48:30,499
Looks like Seagram was right for once.

453
00:48:32,303 --> 00:48:34,374
Control, this is Deep Quest.

454
00:48:35,084 --> 00:48:36,915
We have just spoted a smoke stack
chimney.

455
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:39,393
Mark our position.

456
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:43,576
This is Control. Roger.
Position marked. Out.

457
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:50,975
What do you think?
- I think may be we got a get lucky.

458
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,830
Seacliff, anything over there?
- Negative.

459
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:11,880
Keep your eyes open.

460
00:49:23,673 --> 00:49:25,630
Lets stance this.

461
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:29,154
What gives to the metal detector?
- Nothing ahead.

462
00:49:37,876 --> 00:49:39,992
Wait a minute, what the hell is that?

463
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:49,314
Its a straight drop to nowhere.

464
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,008
Control, this is Deep Quest.

465
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,478
The ocean floor just disappeared.

466
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:06,437
We're going down until we find it again.

467
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:32,518
You gentlemen,think,what i am thinking?

468
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:38,896
She is down in this hole , no wonder
we couldn't find her.

469
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,017
We got something.

470
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,399
Deep Quest, this is Seacliff.
- Look at that.

471
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,288
We getting strong signals on all equipment.
- Roger, so do we.

472
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:58,776
Slowly this way.

473
00:51:17,055 --> 00:51:18,933
The metal detector ripped of its tack.

474
00:51:25,537 --> 00:51:29,325
Deep Quest, this is a Seacliff. I
think we're on something, right ahead.

475
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:32,291
Roger. You sure on.
Hold on.

476
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,703
I think we hit the jackpot.

477
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,828
Holly christ ...

478
00:55:30,304 --> 00:55:32,135
Are you absolutely certain?

479
00:55:33,144 --> 00:55:35,943
No question. A direct report
to our ship standing by there.

480
00:55:37,225 --> 00:55:39,037
All right, here is what we do.

481
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:42,897
See that the press gets the story,
only one paper ...

482
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:46,782
And make sure that Admiral Sandecker's name
is prominent in the list of facts.

483
00:55:47,707 --> 00:55:49,519
Just the story Titanic ?

484
00:55:50,028 --> 00:55:52,488
No, the byzanium too.

485
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:56,383
Let's see what kind of explanation
they come up with.yes sir.

486
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:05,785
This story from today's Washington Star.

487
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:11,185
The Titanic, which sank on her maiden voyage
on April 14, 1912, has been found ...

488
00:56:11,312 --> 00:56:13,985
Over 2 miles down at the
bottom of Atlantic.

489
00:56:14,112 --> 00:56:17,185
No official announcements yet,
but one thing is certain ...

490
00:56:17,313 --> 00:56:20,511
The imaginations of
millions of people will be stimulated.

491
00:56:20,754 --> 00:56:23,113
In world history
there is only one Titanic ...

492
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:25,909
Rumors say that the Navy
plans to raise her.

493
00:56:26,075 --> 00:56:28,270
Why would they doing this
We do not know ...

494
00:56:28,515 --> 00:56:32,475
but we understand that a defense plan,
called The Sicilian Project ...

495
00:56:32,596 --> 00:56:35,394
and a little known mineral,
powerful than uranium ...

496
00:56:35,636 --> 00:56:38,276
with the unusual name byzanium.

497
00:56:38,717 --> 00:56:40,867
This is Sandor Vanocur, in Washington.

498
00:56:41,268 --> 00:56:44,407
Of course I wrote that story.
Why shouldn't i?

499
00:56:44,418 --> 00:56:47,306
The information came in and I wrote it up.
That's my job.

500
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:50,873
What about my job?
It's look like I gave you that information.

501
00:56:51,229 --> 00:56:54,069
Everybody will think that.
- Who cares what anybody thinks?

502
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,429
You know you didn't tell me anything
and so do i.

503
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,036
I didn't even connnected with you.
I still do not know what you up to.

504
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:07,392
You trying to tell me  that the story
just flew inside the window?

505
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:10,302
No, I am not telling you.
that i have lots of sources.

506
00:57:10,403 --> 00:57:15,202
That's what i mean. Who told you?
-  I can't tell, you that.i won't tell you that

507
00:57:15,244 --> 00:57:18,114
You have to. its crictical if there is a leak,
we have to stop.

508
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:21,104
What do you mean by a leak?
I do not even know what you're talking about.

509
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:25,614
The hell you don't. It was a secret.
that's what i am telling you,Nobody know about  it

510
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:27,929
Hardly anybody know about  it.

511
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:33,997
It has to be somebody on a  inside who told you.
Busby? Nicholson?

512
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,176
How about your old friend, Pitt?

513
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:39,698
Did he tell you?

514
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:42,246
So what's its all about.

515
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:51,350
That's what this is really about ,
it about Pitt.

516
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:53,915
Oh christ sake ...
- It isn't you know it.

517
00:57:53,931 --> 00:57:57,611
You have been looking for an excuse to  unkown
ever since you met him.ever since

518
00:57:57,712 --> 00:58:01,182
I don't give a demn about him .- Probably you
don't, you can't get him out from your head.

519
00:58:01,213 --> 00:58:03,647
What-So let us just straight once
and for all.

520
00:58:03,693 --> 00:58:07,289
I lived with him for two years
and i was crazy about him.

521
00:58:07,814 --> 00:58:13,174
That's treffic, its just treffic. If you were so demn
crazy about him,Why didn't you stay with him?

522
00:58:13,935 --> 00:58:15,739
Because I was stupid.

523
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:36,424
I'm Sorry.

524
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,808
I'm Sorry. I didn't mean it.

525
00:58:50,422 --> 00:58:53,495
Sir, after all this time
not the Titanic completely rusted away to nothing?

526
00:58:53,543 --> 00:58:56,773
we don't think so.
At a depth of more than 2 miles ...

527
00:58:57,143 --> 00:58:59,723
There is less oxygen, the water is much colder ...

528
00:58:59,923 --> 00:59:02,392
and there're fewer destructive
marine organisms.

529
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:05,319
She may be surprisingly soundl.

530
00:59:07,885 --> 00:59:11,764
The Titanic she sank because the ice rip the
huge hole in her hull.

531
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,705
Now how she suppose to float
with the hole still there?

532
00:59:14,806 --> 00:59:18,921
Well she can't. so we're going to pack it with
special metal plates...

533
00:59:18,947 --> 00:59:20,756
and maker point...

534
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:25,200
We're goinng to fill her lower compartment
with synthetic foam.

535
00:59:25,768 --> 00:59:31,157
We pump in through hoses
placed it position by our submarsble cruise.

536
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:35,069
As the foam goes in, the water
in the hole is forced out  ...

537
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:38,349
Giving us 22 thousand tons up lift.

538
00:59:39,421 --> 00:59:41,970
Will all that foam bring the Titanic
to the surface?

539
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:45,965
No, we going need additional lift now
this will be supplied by these tanks ...

540
00:59:46,412 --> 00:59:51,282
Filled with Hydrogen gas under high pressure,
an anchored to the Ttitanic's hull.

541
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:58,594
Then explosives charges will be placed on the
sea bottom around the hull and once they're detonated

542
00:59:59,535 --> 01:00:02,572
the hull will be  released  loose
from the bottom suction.

543
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:05,615
and the Titanic will comes to the surface.

544
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:11,347
If and when you raise it, then what?
- Then, we will hold another press conference.

545
01:00:12,617 --> 01:00:14,426
Thank you all very much.

546
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:19,620
Are you sure you can't tell us something
about this mineral, byzanium?

547
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,758
I mean how does it
fit in this whole operation?

548
01:00:21,859 --> 01:00:24,278
No argument i give you all
the informationn i have on that

549
01:00:24,379 --> 01:00:26,599
People says its more powerful than plutonium.
Is that true?

550
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,612
I've no further comment on it.
- What about The Sicilian Project?

551
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,180
Is it really a code name
for a defense system.

552
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:34,450
or super bomb with biggest warhead yet?

553
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,971
No comments.
- Is it true that byzanium could fuel a bomb ...

554
01:00:36,992 --> 01:00:39,571
a thousand times more powerful
than bomb of Hiroshima?

555
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:42,781
That's it, gentlemen.
I've given you everything I can for now.

556
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:19,550
What do you think of it, Vinnie?
- doesn't sound like any code ever heard.

557
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:22,471
You know the tapes remake
at a much higher intensity ...

558
01:02:22,482 --> 01:02:25,156
than the once i've recorded
and connects with the Carpentar.

559
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:29,236
Yes make sure think that the signal,
whatever it is, orignates here on the Denver.

560
01:02:29,443 --> 01:02:31,248
Demn sure it does.

561
01:02:31,964 --> 01:02:34,361
Any word from naval inteligence?

562
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,794
Sandecker says we will have
a report by tomorrow.

563
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:20,187
What's it say about him?
- Marker? He's allright.

564
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:22,737
He has a good record.

565
01:03:23,414 --> 01:03:26,486
He served as a civilian technition in Vietnam.
he got captured.

566
01:03:26,604 --> 01:03:28,724
Spent two years
in a prisoner camp ...

567
01:03:28,735 --> 01:03:31,757
and another one years in Japan to get over that.
Married to a Japanese girl.

568
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:35,730
yes that what he said, only she was not Japanese.
She grew up in Nam Dinh.

569
01:03:36,406 --> 01:03:40,746
Her family still lives in Haiphong and her brother
in the North Vietnamese army intelligence.

570
01:03:40,857 --> 01:03:42,665
How the hell we missed that one?

571
01:03:43,538 --> 01:03:46,873
Its painted over.
We were supposed to miss.

572
01:04:37,068 --> 01:04:39,105
So they finally let you come
down with us.

573
01:04:39,848 --> 01:04:42,358
I thought you'd never make it.
- neither did i.

574
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:46,466
There is no time like the first time.
how do i look to you?

575
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,558
Nothing like i expected.

576
01:05:20,436 --> 01:05:22,746
We got to have a problem with that one.
Let's take a look.

577
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,870
It hangs from a stack.
We gonna need a help.

578
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:44,166
Try Deep Quest.

579
01:05:44,511 --> 01:05:48,290
Deep Quest, this is Turtle. We need some help
with this hydrogen tank, its hangs on a stack.

580
01:05:48,762 --> 01:05:50,696
This is Deep Quest can do,
Be right there.

581
01:05:53,803 --> 01:05:56,327
Well,i let's do it.
Make the mechanical arms ready.

582
01:06:08,085 --> 01:06:12,675
This is Deep Quest, we're hooked up.
- This is Turtle.you pull, we pushl.

583
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,017
Its moving.

584
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:32,406
It feels like it stuck on something.

585
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:43,281
Deep Quest asks for help.

586
01:06:51,594 --> 01:06:53,398
Keep the arm still.

587
01:07:07,977 --> 01:07:10,332
Son of a bitch,
, they are stuck in that window.

588
01:07:13,298 --> 01:07:15,107
Come on, baby.

589
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:17,821
Come on, you pretty little thing.

590
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:19,846
Get some Dady out of there.

591
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,670
Come on ...

592
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,455
Iindicates electrical fire
on the left.

593
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:52,300
Battery acid. Put your mask on.

594
01:07:54,226 --> 01:07:57,784
We are on to state of entangled,
Acid's running out of the batteries.

595
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,057
I was half of power
on the panel.

596
01:08:04,468 --> 01:08:06,270
Can we break out these power lanterns.

597
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,833
Well, knock off the power.

598
01:08:25,632 --> 01:08:27,441
We're going up.

599
01:08:29,153 --> 01:08:31,986
Bohannon, move on over here
and standby Deep Quest.

600
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:34,282
Roger. We are on our way.

601
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:55,048
How's look down there?
- Not good.

602
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:57,473
Seagram picked a lousy day
to go to sight scene.

603
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:01,317
He is a scientist. Who the hell authorise
him for sumersbile duty?

604
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:06,089
How bad is it?
- or they got themselves trapped in to that sky like a cork in the bottle.

605
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,673
We are fighting time.
We lost almost all batteries power ...

606
01:09:10,903 --> 01:09:13,921
and they are going to be running out of air.
They have about six hours left.

607
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:16,318
What're choices?
- No choices.

608
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:19,059
If we can't cut loose that  submarsible ...

609
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:22,633
we have to bring up the Titanic.
- six hours? How we do that?

610
01:09:22,683 --> 01:09:24,624
Target date two weeks away.

611
01:09:24,963 --> 01:09:26,782
Our target date just got changed.

612
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:29,008
Here's all we got to do.

613
01:09:29,844 --> 01:09:32,962
Eighty charges, each one containing
a hundred pounds of explosives ...

614
01:09:33,445 --> 01:09:36,105
At these key points under the hold.
Why're you shaking your head?

615
01:09:36,117 --> 01:09:40,213
Shaking my head, I am shaking all over.
Those charges are double what we planned.

616
01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:44,421
If anything goes wrong we loose four men. But if
we do not bring him up, we lose him anyway.

617
01:09:44,436 --> 01:09:46,741
They got two chances to die
and one to live.

618
01:09:47,668 --> 01:09:50,205
All right now we're going to detonate
 the starboard charge first.

619
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:55,197
Eight seconds later, first one on the port side.
another eight seconds back to starboard.

620
01:09:55,369 --> 01:09:57,839
We alternate the explosions
all the way to holds ...

621
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:01,240
So we setup rocking motion like you do
with a car stuck in the mud.

622
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,820
Would it not be better to put an extra large charge
right on to bow 

623
01:10:04,902 --> 01:10:06,750
Then we shake it loose.
- Too dangerous.

624
01:10:06,762 --> 01:10:09,689
This way we start the right movement
with less risk to the men.

625
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:43,546
Carbon dioxide rising up.

626
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,934
Can we get some more air?
- No,we can not.

627
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:49,370
Moving it down to save energy.

628
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,489
The less we talk, the longer we go.
- Exactly.

629
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:57,558
Everybody just sit down
and relaxed.

630
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,676
ok, arm it.

631
01:12:26,678 --> 01:12:29,478
Control, this is Seacliff. Explosives secured.

632
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:31,406
All clear.
- Roger.

633
01:12:31,599 --> 01:12:34,354
Control, this is Turtle. All charges secured.

634
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,119
Seacliff, Turtle, this is Control.
Get the hell out of there.

635
01:12:38,481 --> 01:12:40,287
moving out.

636
01:12:46,603 --> 01:12:51,959
This is Turtle. Estimated arrival area,
13.05. We're leaving the Titanic.

637
01:13:01,315 --> 01:13:04,254
Start the countdown.
- Start the countdown, I.I sir?

638
01:13:04,566 --> 01:13:06,367
All stations, T minus 50.

639
01:13:06,886 --> 01:13:08,877
Activating Hydrogenium generators.

640
01:13:57,896 --> 01:14:01,526
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine ...

641
01:14:01,697 --> 01:14:04,973
eight, seven six, five ...

642
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:09,815
four, three, two, one.
- Start.

643
01:14:15,499 --> 01:14:18,572
Heavens, what is it?
- trying to blast us loose.

644
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,812
Can they do it?
- They're going to blow hell out of this sub.

645
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,917
It just laying there.
Move, you bastard, move.

646
01:16:30,845 --> 01:16:34,440
What the hell is going on?
- Late hits,last two charges just went off.

647
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,046
Something happening.
 something moving down there.

648
01:20:58,617 --> 01:21:01,529
Isn't that a beauty?
son of a bitch

649
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:03,947
It's incredible.

650
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:11,544
There she is.

651
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,588
But where the hell is Deep Quest?

652
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:24,738
The explosives must have her released.

653
01:21:30,183 --> 01:21:31,988
There she is.

654
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:15,931
We can not did our service.
head covers just as jammed as the others.

655
01:28:15,941 --> 01:28:18,271
I got to need dynamite
to get you out of that mass.

656
01:28:19,462 --> 01:28:21,657
Yes, just forget it.
Keep the pump running.

657
01:28:22,022 --> 01:28:25,557
We got to wait until we go to New York
 to get the right equipment.

658
01:28:47,467 --> 01:28:49,438
What happens?
Where does the Carpentar gone?

659
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:51,458
This ,
freighter have a trouble.

660
01:28:51,468 --> 01:28:53,548
We're in trouble.
We need that ship.

661
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,339
We can not ignore this distress call.
- you wanna talk about distress?

662
01:28:56,379 --> 01:29:00,039
We got Navy weather forecasting a
force 12 storm the Russians are looking down out throats...

663
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:03,699
We are on a ship never learn
how to do but sink. That's distress.

664
01:29:34,957 --> 01:29:39,395
From the Russian ship. They're asking for permission
to send a man over here captain Prevlov.

665
01:29:39,677 --> 01:29:41,487
What's that all about.

666
01:29:42,157 --> 01:29:46,276
Well They're offering give us a hand
in case the weather gets bad.

667
01:29:47,879 --> 01:29:50,597
Permission granted, Captain Prevlov
come aboard.

668
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,271
Admiral, you sure we want to do this?

669
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,520
Why not?
We might listen what he got to say.

670
01:30:43,369 --> 01:30:45,406
Welcome to the Titanic, Captain.

671
01:30:46,811 --> 01:30:49,644
Our time is precious,
so I'll come straight to the point.

672
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:52,604
We're offering you the safety of our ship.

673
01:30:53,651 --> 01:30:56,610
My helicopter can carry ten men at a time.

674
01:30:56,932 --> 01:31:01,524
Very nice of you. What happens
to the Titanic if we accept your offer?

675
01:31:01,813 --> 01:31:06,165
An empty ship on an open seas.
- What is the Russian word for piracy?

676
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:11,324
No, it's not question of piracy.
It is the international law of maraine salvage.

677
01:31:11,535 --> 01:31:13,441
Hell with it.

678
01:31:14,975 --> 01:31:16,977
We know about the byzanium.

679
01:31:19,937 --> 01:31:22,167
Stolen from a mine on Russian territory.

680
01:31:25,928 --> 01:31:31,908
You must trust me, gentlemen, what i tell you that we're 
determined to take back what is morally and legaly ours.

681
01:31:33,419 --> 01:31:35,808
Mikhail Kurkov is a torpido ship.

682
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:39,930
If her captain gets no signal from me
eight minutes from now...

683
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:43,297
he will sink this ship, that we're standing on.

684
01:31:43,542 --> 01:31:45,432
What if do to get byzanium, then what?

685
01:31:45,452 --> 01:31:48,604
It is worthless if you do not ...
- A Sicilian defense system?

686
01:31:48,642 --> 01:31:50,453
No, its not worthless at all.

687
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:54,573
If this byzanium will
produce a superior weapon ...

688
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:57,834
Then Russia must have it to guaranty the security
of our people.

689
01:31:58,264 --> 01:32:00,294
We arm ourselves only ...

690
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:03,234
to protect us.

691
01:32:08,146 --> 01:32:09,976
The clock is keep ticking, gentlemen.

692
01:32:12,586 --> 01:32:14,424
All right, Prevlov, i make it fast.

693
01:32:15,147 --> 01:32:19,300
We knew you're comming aboard here today
we knew your plan would be exactly.

694
01:32:24,589 --> 01:32:26,690
This is Pitt. bring on a surprise package.

695
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:32,799
Well, I will prove it to you.

696
01:33:38,883 --> 01:33:41,556
Like I said,
You do not have much choice, Captain.

697
01:33:42,524 --> 01:33:44,330
I see.

698
01:33:52,286 --> 01:33:54,094
Gentlemen ...

699
01:37:28,807 --> 01:37:30,616
We have him.

700
01:37:33,769 --> 01:37:35,646
No water.
- Sealed tight.

701
01:37:40,369 --> 01:37:42,170
Watch out.

702
01:37:46,251 --> 01:37:50,005
And here is Arthur Brewster,
sank with the Titanic.

703
01:37:51,371 --> 01:37:53,692
All right,Lets get those boxes out of there
and get them open up.

704
01:38:54,464 --> 01:38:57,269
Just like the others,
debris.

705
01:38:58,504 --> 01:39:03,133
Doesn't makes sense.
- A dead man and seven boxes of crap.

706
01:39:03,585 --> 01:39:05,389
Arthur Brewster's papers.

707
01:39:06,506 --> 01:39:08,542
Listen, we know that byzanium existed.

708
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:11,376
We know that Brewster had it.
It must be some place.

709
01:39:16,428 --> 01:39:18,503
We worked sweat come up with nothing.

710
01:39:19,188 --> 01:39:22,898
Three men dead whole The Sicilian Project
in the junk box.

711
01:39:24,109 --> 01:39:25,941
How the hell that we blow this thing?

712
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:32,429
There must be some kind of answer,
but I could not find what it is.

713
01:39:33,471 --> 01:39:35,911
I am just as disappointed as you're, Gene.

714
01:39:36,192 --> 01:39:39,787
I hate to quit on anything ,
but sometimes you have no choice.

715
01:39:48,955 --> 01:39:50,786
If it make you feel any better ...

716
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:55,346
I will tell you something I didn't want
to admit even to myself.

717
01:39:55,835 --> 01:39:59,511
If we had found the byzanium,
I am not sure we could hung on to it.

718
01:40:00,347 --> 01:40:03,586
I don't think we could tagged it,
for defensive only  and made it stick.

719
01:40:03,597 --> 01:40:06,450
We got the president's assuare for that.
- yes, right,but ...

720
01:40:06,999 --> 01:40:10,808
Presidents do not stay on office forever
and even if they did circumstances change.

721
01:40:10,918 --> 01:40:13,714
What is that mean?
- I means that ...

722
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:18,238
if the government falls
in the Middle East or somewhere ...

723
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:21,473
They start bombing Pakistan or some where else...

724
01:40:22,521 --> 01:40:24,325
It effects all of usl.

725
01:40:24,681 --> 01:40:26,951
What this got to do with
The Sicilian Project?

726
01:40:27,482 --> 01:40:29,786
Nothing.
Maybe ...

727
01:40:32,603 --> 01:40:36,603
I am just saying that somewhere in the world
in some think tank right now...

728
01:40:38,434 --> 01:40:42,234
they're figureing out a way to build a
byzaniumbom bomb.

729
01:40:46,434 --> 01:40:48,234
Why, if you knew that...

730
01:40:49,434 --> 01:40:52,234
In God's name why
 did you go along with this whole operation?

731
01:40:52,265 --> 01:40:54,865
Because I believed in what we were trying to do.

732
01:40:56,074 --> 01:40:57,874
And if it did not work defensively ...

733
01:40:58,384 --> 01:41:01,484
if somebody was going to make a byzanium bomb ...

734
01:41:02,294 --> 01:41:04,094
I wanted it to be us.

735
01:41:37,471 --> 01:41:40,770
He thinks just like you do.
I don't understand that kind of thinking.

736
01:41:40,941 --> 01:41:43,942
You are both couple of cynics.
You think its some kind of lousy game.

737
01:41:45,352 --> 01:41:49,152
If I thought the way Sandecker does
I wouldn't started the demn project on a first place.

738
01:41:55,162 --> 01:41:57,332
I'm glad we didn't find the stuff.

739
01:42:00,745 --> 01:42:02,654
ok?

740
01:42:05,752 --> 01:42:08,151
But I am not got to let you wriggle
 off the hooks so easy.

741
01:42:10,161 --> 01:42:11,961
Not now.

742
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:13,879
take a look at this.

743
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:19,879
Its a postcard.
i saw it.

744
01:42:20,579 --> 01:42:23,579
That's right. A british postcard.
We all saw it.

745
01:42:25,089 --> 01:42:28,888
Brewster must bought it,stuck it in his suitcase
never mailed it.

746
01:42:32,098 --> 01:42:36,098
Take a look at the fine print on the back.
Come on, read it.

747
01:42:39,209 --> 01:42:44,009
Typical country church and grave yard in county of Hampshire
Near the village Southby.

748
01:42:50,919 --> 01:42:52,719
Twenty miles from Southampton.

749
01:42:53,728 --> 01:42:55,528
We were wrong.

750
01:42:56,037 --> 01:42:58,838
We thought it was a man,
but it is a place.

751
01:42:59,147 --> 01:43:00,947
Thank God for Southby.

752
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:33,979
And this is the one.
 Jake Hobart.

753
01:43:34,275 --> 01:43:36,075
I will get the shawls.

754
01:43:36,685 --> 01:43:38,485
Excuse me.

755
01:44:06,495 --> 01:44:08,295
Jackpot.

756
01:44:32,004 --> 01:44:34,504
Would you like us to dig him up?
- I do not know.

757
01:44:36,214 --> 01:44:38,314
You will have to ask Doctor Seagram
that question.

758
01:44:42,724 --> 01:44:45,324
It is your decision, Gene.
Whether you like it or not.

759
01:45:07,733 --> 01:45:09,533
Wouldn't you want us to dig him up?

760
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:15,150
No.

761
01:45:39,042 --> 01:45:40,842
What's so funny?

762
01:45:42,652 --> 01:45:45,252
I knew a girl once .
- I bet you did.

763
01:45:46,362 --> 01:45:49,651
Years later I came back to her,
she says, what has happened to you?

764
01:45:49,671 --> 01:45:51,571
I thought you got to change the world.

765
01:45:51,581 --> 01:45:53,681
What do you said?
- I said they have me out numbered.

766
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:56,990
Is that my lesson for the day?

767
01:45:58,199 --> 01:45:59,999
No more lessons.
No more lectures.

768
01:46:00,409 --> 01:46:02,209
You mean the school is over?

769
01:46:02,618 --> 01:46:04,818
Yes, you have just graduated, professor.
