1
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:34,678
Stop.

2
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,423
This is coming down.

3
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,472
What? Why?

4
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:43,308
No, I love the idea of the mirror
on the ceiling, but that's just ugly.

5
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:46,490
But the thing is, you look beautiful in it.

6
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:50,675
Now, see, if we're gonna take it down,
we gotta at least try it out...

7
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:53,029
christen the new house.

8
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,342
And what do you suggest we use
for a bed?

9
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:01,530
We don't need a bed, because we got
this fine carpet right here.

10
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:06,848
So I guess we'll have fine carpet
tattoos all over our asses.

11
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,331
Wait, baby,
don't you have to go to work?

12
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:12,557
I don't want any 30-second nookie.

13
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:17,092
I told them I'd be late. Now what?

14
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,880
- What about the movers?
- The movers?

15
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,625
- Yeah.
- They're gonna be here in an hour.

16
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:24,110
Which is just enough time.

17
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:27,771
Derek. You are so bad.

18
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:30,388
Like that isn't why you married me?

19
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:33,046
What about Kyle?

20
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:38,016
He'll be all right.
That boy will sleep through anything.

21
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,205
Gage Bendix?

22
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,864
Excuse me?

23
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:36,828
I couldn't help but notice
we were both going to 22.

24
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:40,228
Gage Bendix, yeah. I work there.

25
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:43,498
I thought that you might.

26
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,028
You have an appointment with us?

27
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:50,690
Why, do I look like a client?

28
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:51,910
Actually, you do.

29
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:56,444
Well, well, I hate to shatter the illusion,
but I'm a temp.

30
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,407
You're a temp?

31
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,760
Girl's gotta pay the rent.

32
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,726
I would've never guessed a temp.

33
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:13,182
Let me help you out.

34
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:15,538
There you go.

35
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,212
There you go.

36
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:29,530
Thanks. I owe you one.

37
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:39,992
- Good morning.
- Morning.

38
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:45,004
Are you following me?

39
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:48,406
No, I'm taking these files
to Mr. Charles's office.

40
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,064
- Derek Charles?
- Yeah, I guess you probably know him.

41
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:53,462
Yeah, I know who he is
and he's an asshole.

42
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:57,080
Takes himself way too seriously.
But don't tell him I said that, okay?

43
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,651
- I could get you in trouble?
- Oh, yeah. Big trouble.

44
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,570
My lips are sealed.

45
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,185
- Patrick.
- Good morning, Derek.

46
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,928
- Hey.
- How's the new house?

47
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:09,416
Chaos, man, chaos. I got out
just as the movers showed up.

48
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:10,941
Sharon must have loved that.

49
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:13,513
Yeah, if she calls mad,
you tell her I'm in a meeting.

50
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:16,260
Hey. Remember who used to sit
at this desk, huh?

51
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,352
She'll know I'm lying.

52
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,273
Can I help you?

53
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,843
That's Derek Charles?

54
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,587
Yes.

55
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,771
Better watch out, girl, he's married.

56
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:32,128
- The good ones are always married.
- Right. Or straight.

57
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,094
Did you talk to our German friend,
Herr Ganz?

58
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:38,535
Actually, I just got off the phone
with him.

59
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,279
- And?
- He doesn't like the way...

60
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,464
the stock market's gyrating, thinks
the hedge-fund wave is about to crest.

61
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,209
- You think he's right?
- No, no. I don't think he's right.

62
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,649
He's wrong. You know Ganz.

63
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,307
He gets paranoid when
anything goes mainstream.

64
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:52,790
So he makes a lot of noise...

65
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:57,237
but I managed to talk him into
a private-equity portfolio instead.

66
00:07:57,586 --> 00:08:00,070
To the tune of 155 million.

67
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:05,082
I want you to throw Derek
your support on this.

68
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,350
I am just honoured
to exist in Derek's world.

69
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:08,917
Whose legs are those?

70
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:11,839
- Never seen them before.
- I think she's a new temp.

71
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,826
I think you mean temptress.

72
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,615
Always nice to have a girl
around the office, isn't it?

73
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:19,798
Derek married the last eye candy
we had, took her off the market.

74
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,155
Yes, sir. Miss us a little
Sharon around here.

75
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:24,725
I don't think you do.

76
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,606
- Patrick, forward my calls.
- Will do.

77
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:32,527
- Okay. Good night, Marge.
- Bye, Derek.

78
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,192
D, you cutting out early? I grabbed us
a couple tickets to the Lakers tonight.

79
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:38,543
You're killing me. I'm moving.

80
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:40,200
- I gotta get home.
- So?

81
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:42,597
So do I look like a man
who wants to get a divorce?

82
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:45,212
Why don't I call her and say we got
a work emergency? Come on.

83
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:47,348
- No, thanks, I'll stay married.
- Coward.

84
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,310
Yeah.

85
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:52,448
Goodbye, Mr. Charles.

86
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:59,032
- You punked me.
- I'm sorry, but you set me up.

87
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,820
I'll get my revenge.
You might like to know...

88
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:05,351
- that everybody disagrees with you.
- About what?

89
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:07,749
About Derek Charles
being an asshole.

90
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,754
They say he's the nicest guy
in the firm.

91
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,716
Yeah, well, I've got them fooled.

92
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,373
I'm Lisa, by the way.

93
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:16,293
Hey, Lisa By The Way.

94
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,604
Good luck at your next job.

95
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:21,087
Hold the door, please.

96
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:23,224
They're keeping me on
for a few more days...

97
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:26,538
so I might see you on Monday.

98
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,354
Sharon!

99
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:57,529
Your turn.

100
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,666
No, I think it's your turn!

101
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,064
Don't even try it.
It's definitely your turn.

102
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:03,938
Looks like I'm stuck, huh?

103
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:05,724
Huh, Kyle?

104
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:07,862
Come here.

105
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:12,089
Oh, my God.
What is your mom feeding you?

106
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:56,554
What do you think about giving
that magic mirror another test drive?

107
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:59,212
Sharon, you're so bad.

108
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:02,003
Like that's not why you married me.

109
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:10,198
- Morning, Marge.
- Morning, Derek.

110
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:16,039
Hi.

111
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:17,738
Remember me?

112
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,970
Lisa By The Way, right?

113
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:25,847
Very good, I'm impressed.

114
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:30,825
Hey, Marge, where's Patrick?

115
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,166
Out with the flu.

116
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,216
I did some trading
with the other temps...

117
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:36,571
and I wrangled your desk.

118
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:39,141
I hope that's okay.

119
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,984
No, that's fine. Why don't you
grab a pad and a pen, follow me?

120
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:55,837
Here's a memo
for the Christmas party this Friday.

121
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:58,324
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

122
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,713
Sit down.

123
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:11,861
So why don't they invite spouses?

124
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:14,912
What?

125
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:17,310
To the party. It says no spouses.

126
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:21,974
Yeah, it's Joe Gage's rule. Actually,
it's like that at a lot of companies.

127
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,200
I guess they figure you're not gonna
kick back and let loose...

128
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:28,644
if your spouse is there.
The reason of having the party, right?

129
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:32,044
- So does this party get pretty wild?
- Oh, not usually.

130
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,483
Well, that's no fun.

131
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:37,014
I called Patrick. He said that
you like it black with 2 sugars.

132
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,718
If it's cold, I can go nuke it
in the kitchen.

133
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,987
No, actually, it's perfect. Thank you
very much. Let's get started.

134
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:45,906
- Ready when you are.
- It's Monday.

135
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:49,001
- First things first.
- Took care of that.

136
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,528
Took care of what?

137
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:52,880
On Mondays you always
send your wife flowers.

138
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:56,368
This week you sent her a dozen
long-stemmed red roses.

139
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:58,722
I called to confirm
they've been delivered.

140
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:00,684
Thank you.

141
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,348
So how long have you two
been married?

142
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:07,919
3 years in March.

143
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,623
And you still send her flowers
every week. Lucky girl.

144
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,673
Yeah, it's kind of a tradition.

145
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:17,292
Patrick said that you started back
when she was your assistant.

146
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,472
You and Patrick had quite
a conversation.

147
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:21,215
- Let's run some calls.
- Fire away.

148
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,395
Why don't we start
with Phil Trendle?

149
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:25,792
See if you can get a lunch
appointment next week...

150
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:28,495
but push for The Water Grill.
I like the fish.

151
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,892
- The Water Grill's fantastic.
- Terry Mills.

152
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,249
- Am I going too fast?
- I'm just waiting on you.

153
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:37,257
Are you always this efficient?

154
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:38,957
Does that surprise you?

155
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,528
Yeah. Yeah, most of the temps
we get here, they're like--

156
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,537
I think you'll find
I'm not your typical temp.

157
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:48,844
<i>We were at the grocery store,</i>

158
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,644
I look over and Kyle is flirting
with the checkout girl.

159
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:56,523
<i>She's about 16, and he's 2.</i>

160
00:13:56,524 --> 00:14:00,535
<i>He was giving her the same look
you give when you see a pretty girl.</i>

161
00:14:00,536 --> 00:14:04,676
<i>I think you've been teaching my baby
how to flirt. Like father, like son.</i>

162
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:08,294
<i>So, anyway, on the way home,
I stopped by campus today...</i>

163
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:12,653
<i>and I picked up a catalogue
for next semester's curriculum.</i>

164
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:15,399
<i>Let me tell you, I cannot wait.</i>

165
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,491
Do you need me?

166
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:22,374
<i>I'm gonna show it to you tonight.
I need your opinion on my courses.</i>

167
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,293
Are you listening to me?

168
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:34,143
Baby.

169
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:37,544
If I bundle Managerial Economics
and Operations Management...

170
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:40,159
then I won't take Management
Information Systems...

171
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,600
until next semester, right?

172
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:43,778
School?

173
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,826
- Derek.
- It's like an online degree?

174
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:48,922
Come on, baby, not tonight.
You know this is important to me.

175
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,578
Well, it's important to me too...

176
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,762
but I was kind of hoping you liked
being a mom, staying home with Kyle.

177
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:57,683
You know I love being a mom.

178
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:02,303
We got all this room. I make
enough money for you and I to--

179
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:04,352
It's not about the money.

180
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,573
We had an agreement.

181
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:09,322
You said that you'd work hard, I'd have
the baby, you'd get your promotion.

182
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,455
Then I'd get my degree.

183
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,199
- I said that?
- Yes, you did.

184
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,902
You have something to talk about
when you get home.

185
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:16,645
I need some things to talk about.

186
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:19,872
- So Kyle's gonna be an only child?
- Let's get him a puppy.

187
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,773
A female that looks
like your side of the family...

188
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:25,999
- and tell him it's his sister.
- Can we call her Little Sharon?

189
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,525
Hey, Little Sharon. Come here.

190
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,489
You know exactly
who I'm talking about.

191
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,329
You know what, I wanna see you
say that in front of her face.

192
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:41,561
D? Why didn't you
call me back today?

193
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:43,829
- What time did you call?
- Around 4.

194
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,404
- You should leave a message.
- I did leave a message.

195
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,891
Oh, Patrick was sick,
and, you know, the temp--

196
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:52,852
We had a temp and she said...

197
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,555
Shannon called but didn't leave a number.

198
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:59,304
She? I thought we had an agreement,
no female assistants.

199
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:02,137
Baby, I don't control
temp availability.

200
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:03,750
Is she pretty?

201
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:05,929
Pretty plain.

202
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,372
Actually, you know what,
she did a better job than Patrick.

203
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:11,160
Except for messing up
your message.

204
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:13,688
- I want her fired immediately.
-lmmediately.

205
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:16,391
- I'm serious.
- I promise.

206
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,928
Good night, Shannon.

207
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,771
Hope we're not interrupting
anything.

208
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:31,168
No, no, it's a treat to have you here.

209
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:34,351
I'm taking Kyle to The Grove today
to see Santa.

210
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:38,056
You wanna come?
Get your picture taken on Santa's lap?

211
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:39,974
No, I would, but I'm swamped.

212
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:42,153
You need me back in the office,
don't you?

213
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:44,856
Excuse me.
Here's your coffee, freshly nuked.

214
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:47,734
Hey, Lisa.

215
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:52,266
This is my wife, Sharon. Sharon,
this is Lisa. She's temping for Patrick.

216
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:55,100
It is such a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Charles.

217
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:58,152
- Hi.
- Hi. And this must be Kyle.

218
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:01,247
I can already tell
he's gonna be a heartbreaker.

219
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:03,993
Hi, Kyle. I'm Lisa.

220
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:05,344
Say hi, Kyle.

221
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:09,006
Oh, he can say hello. He's usually
not this shy around strangers.

222
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:12,625
What a handsome boy.
He looks just like you.

223
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,368
You think so?

224
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:17,289
Most people think he looks
like the beautiful Sharon.

225
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,032
Talk about the perfect family.

226
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,910
The 3 of you should be
on the cover of a magazine.

227
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:24,612
It's a good thing you won't be here
too long.

228
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:26,965
I know my husband
can be very demanding.

229
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:29,494
Actually, I'm learning a lot
from your husband.

230
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:32,198
I bet you are.

231
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:37,253
Joe Gage needs to see you
when you have a moment.

232
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:38,911
Great.

233
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:41,568
It's nice to meet you, Sharon.

234
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:43,095
You too, Liz.

235
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:45,231
- It's Lisa.
- Excuse me?

236
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,409
It's Lisa. You said Liz.

237
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,897
Sorry. Lisa.

238
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:58,962
- Sharon.
- Wasn't me. Blame Shannon.

239
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:01,229
- What's the deal with her?
- What do you mean?

240
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,147
" Looks just like you, Derek."

241
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:06,024
But he is kind of handsome like me.

242
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:07,506
You said she was plain.

243
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:09,859
That girl may be a lot,
but she ain't plain.

244
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,303
I wouldn't know.
I only have eyes for you.

245
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:15,920
And you really think
that's gonna work?

246
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:17,706
Come on.

247
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:20,147
Take you around the office.
You can see the gang.

248
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:21,891
I know that you must miss it.

249
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,117
- When is Patrick coming back?
- Tomorrow.

250
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,820
You better hope so.

251
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,658
Crudo.

252
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,025
Wow, look at the tree.

253
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:49,380
Christmas already.

254
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:53,651
- Hey, Stan.
- Good morning, Mr. Charles.

255
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,092
- I'm back.
- Patrick.

256
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:58,010
- Feeling better?
- Yeah, thanks.

257
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:01,061
You know it's gonna take a lot more
than some stomach bug...

258
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:03,284
to keep me away from
that Christmas party.

259
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,375
Yeah.

260
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:08,298
Not sure we can say the same
for Marge.

261
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,203
You get around, don't you?

262
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:16,736
Poor girl called in sick
with the stomach bug.

263
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,219
She caught it from Patrick.

264
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,834
That's what she gets
for using my lip gloss.

265
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:25,543
All right, girls.
Behave yourselves out here.

266
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:32,734
So how many times did you get busted
listening in on Derek's calls?

267
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:34,739
As if you don't.

268
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,833
I'm way too smooth
to ever get caught.

269
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:39,404
- I bet you are.
- How long have you been here?

270
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,714
- 10 years in April.
- I bet you know more...

271
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:44,417
about what happens behind
these doors than anybody.

272
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:46,553
Sweetie, you have no idea.

273
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:49,081
My nickname around here is 411.

274
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,700
411. Well, maybe we can grab
a cocktail after work sometime.

275
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,530
You can catch me up with girl talk.

276
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:58,453
If you think you can pump me for
information with a couple of Cosmos...

277
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:00,459
you're right.

278
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:23,040
I'm sorry, I thought everyone
was at lunch.

279
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,439
- I should go.
- No.

280
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:28,488
You stay. Okay?

281
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:33,544
I'm gonna just grab my lunch and...

282
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:36,204
head on back to my office.

283
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,951
Okay?

284
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:50,196
- You okay? You wanna talk about it?
- It's nothing.

285
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:52,202
Nothing?

286
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:58,697
You know, most people I know
don't cry over nothing.

287
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:01,138
You think I'm crying?

288
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:02,968
This is just allergies.

289
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,889
Oh, allergies, okay.
What are you allergic to?

290
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:10,815
Men, apparently.

291
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,951
Can I sit down?

292
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:16,744
Yeah.

293
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:22,933
You having boyfriend troubles
right now?

294
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:27,773
I'm beginning to think
there's something wrong with me.

295
00:22:27,774 --> 00:22:30,781
There's nothing wrong with you.

296
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:33,745
I wish I could believe that.

297
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,027
Maybe you haven't met
the right guy yet.

298
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,078
I'm beginning to think
all the good ones are taken.

299
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,912
I'm no expert, but, you know,
if it didn't work out...

300
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:50,921
then maybe it wasn't meant to be.

301
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,838
Maybe.

302
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,064
And then, you know,
you're gonna meet the right guy...

303
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:57,719
you'll know immediately.

304
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,118
Is that how it was
with you and Sharon?

305
00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:03,169
Yeah. Yeah, it does happen.

306
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,092
- Great. Now I'm jealous.
- Why?

307
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:09,620
She has everything.

308
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,889
Perfect husband, perfect child,
perfect marriage.

309
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,071
No. No, nothing's perfect.

310
00:23:16,072 --> 00:23:18,775
You know, there are problems
in every relationship.

311
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:20,910
The most important thing
is to move forward.

312
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:23,526
You gotta keep moving forward,
you know?

313
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:27,536
Hey, Lisa, look, don't beat yourself up
over this guy.

314
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:31,181
Look at you, you're a bright,
attractive woman.

315
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,275
Any man would be lucky
to have you.

316
00:23:34,276 --> 00:23:35,670
Yeah, right.

317
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:39,202
No. Honestly, if I were single....

318
00:23:39,464 --> 00:23:41,381
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

319
00:23:41,382 --> 00:23:43,168
Is it working?

320
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:46,176
Yes.

321
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,181
Good.

322
00:23:48,182 --> 00:23:50,360
You hang in there, okay?

323
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:54,590
It's gonna be just fine.

324
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:56,594
Thanks, Derek.

325
00:23:56,595 --> 00:24:00,605
Mister--  Mr. Charles.

326
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:07,230
I'm sorry, excuse me.

327
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:10,239
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

328
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:13,857
What was that all about?

329
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:17,169
Oh, man, her boyfriend dumped her
and I was being nice.

330
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,482
I'll take up that slack.
That is one smoking hot piece of ass.

331
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:22,793
- Stop it, Ben.
- Come on. Like you haven't noticed.

332
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,929
No, dude,
I'm not in the game anymore.

333
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,327
I'm retired and coaching, as are you.

334
00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:31,119
I'm still in the game. I'm just
on the bench, waiting to play again.

335
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,123
Careful, D.
It's not like the old days...

336
00:24:33,124 --> 00:24:36,742
where you could get away with
office nookie and not get nailed for it.

337
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:37,962
Careful, D?

338
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:40,054
You went and married yours,
that's all.

339
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:41,841
If you're thinking of that girl--

340
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:43,847
- You saw her first.
- You are a fool.

341
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:48,076
Sadly, I don't think I'm her type.
Now, you, on the other hand....

342
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:51,301
All I'm saying
is that these single gals...

343
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:53,699
see the workplace
as their hunting ground.

344
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,321
And I think this one has got you
in her cross hairs.

345
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:15,214
Sharon. Hey.

346
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,836
I just put him to sleep, baby.

347
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:23,366
Red? Blue?

348
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,980
- Red? Blue?
- The red one.

349
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:34,221
- What you doing tonight?
- The usual. Formula, oatmeal.

350
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:36,966
How do I look?

351
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,320
- You look all right.
- I look all right.

352
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:43,200
Remember the last time you went
to that party and got drunk.

353
00:26:44,578 --> 00:26:46,320
Kyle.

354
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:48,239
Eat something.

355
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,464
I will. I'm gonna grab a burger
at Jake's.

356
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:55,433
- Okay. I love you.
- Okay. I love you too.

357
00:26:56,261 --> 00:27:01,665
4th quarter, Derek Charles
puts it up, 3 seconds to go.

358
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:07,725
- I love you, baby.
- Bye. Eat something, baby.

359
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:40,026
- This seat taken?
- Yeah.

360
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:41,595
No, I'm kidding.

361
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:43,688
Be my guest.

362
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,616
- Look at you.
- It's a Christmas party.

363
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,272
Oh, yeah. You look great.

364
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:54,281
Thank you.
You grabbing a bite before?

365
00:27:54,282 --> 00:27:55,674
Yeah. You too?

366
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,330
Brilliant minds think alike.

367
00:27:57,331 --> 00:28:00,339
Thank you, John.
Still the best burger in town.

368
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,126
Really?

369
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,481
Hey, John? John?

370
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:06,747
John.

371
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:10,496
- Can I have one too?
- Fix her up. The special.

372
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:19,475
- That was delicious.
- I told you.

373
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:24,401
You know, we used to come back here
after a hard day's work and cut loose.

374
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,796
- Work hard, play hard?
- Yeah.

375
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:29,372
Back in the day,
I would throw them back too.

376
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:32,292
Hey, how's your boyfriend trouble?

377
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,518
- Keep moving forward, right?
- Exactly.

378
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,746
- All right.
- So, what's the grand plan, Derek?

379
00:28:39,747 --> 00:28:41,925
Run the company by 35...

380
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:46,459
jet by 40, retire on my private island
and own the Lakers by 50.

381
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,899
- I'm a Sixers fan.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

382
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,691
I'll bring you around to my team,
okay?

383
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,393
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

384
00:28:54,394 --> 00:28:56,964
Can--? Can I please have
a dirty martini?

385
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:58,229
Sure.

386
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,669
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

387
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:04,157
Oh, come on. Big talker.

388
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:05,334
No, thanks.

389
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:09,649
- It's Christmas time. Work's dead.
- John, no.

390
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,138
- Bring one for my friend.
- How dirty do you want it?

391
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,230
Make it filthy.

392
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,115
This is for you.

393
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:30,442
Patrick? Patrick. Patrick.

394
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:34,218
Once again, great job as the head
of the decoration committee.

395
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:39,187
- You're like Santa's Little Helper.
- Well, I wouldn't let your people do it.

396
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:43,676
Hey, don't try this at home, huh?
You'll hurt yourself.

397
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:52,699
What's up?

398
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,750
What's going on?
You look beautiful.

399
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,800
I'll be right back.

400
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:59,850
I'm coming for you, Derek.

401
00:30:01,158 --> 00:30:03,425
- I'm coming for you.
- No. I don't dance.

402
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,343
No, come on, you don't wanna
with me. Okay, okay.

403
00:30:06,344 --> 00:30:08,438
Yeah. All right.

404
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:12,272
- Is this you, Marge?
- That's me.

405
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:15,106
Let me get some of that boogie.

406
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,595
- Didn't know you could move like that.
- Because I'm stuck behind a desk.

407
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:23,999
- Okay, you do have legs under there.
- Oh, yes, I do.

408
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,887
- All right. You are smooth.
- Smooth, baby, real smooth.

409
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:32,674
- Really smooth.
- I'm coming in.

410
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:35,681
All righty, baby. He's all yours.

411
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:40,694
- Hey, Office Asshole.
- That's Mr. Office Asshole to you.

412
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:42,263
Tequila?

413
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:46,492
Beer, 3 martinis, and tequila?
No, I don't think so.

414
00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:48,541
Coward.

415
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,477
Bring it on.

416
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:59,700
You've got the moves.

417
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:02,186
That's Soul Train for you, baby.

418
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:04,190
- What you got?
- Wanna see what I got?

419
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:06,894
- Let's go, let's go.
- Bring it.

420
00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:10,423
You got some moves. Okay, temp.

421
00:31:10,424 --> 00:31:13,519
- Nasty, nasty.
- Hey.

422
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,048
You know,
I wasn't gonna come tonight.

423
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,965
Why not?

424
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:21,758
I haven't been here that long and....

425
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,724
I'm sure everybody here is happy
that you showed up.

426
00:31:27,163 --> 00:31:28,644
Even you?

427
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:32,699
What do you mean, "even me"?
I'm your biggest supporter here.

428
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,812
You wanna put one on the cheek?

429
00:31:45,952 --> 00:31:49,787
If you don't, people will
really think something's going on.

430
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:55,236
Well, we're gonna have
to take that chance then, huh?

431
00:31:58,157 --> 00:31:59,595
Whoa, where you going?

432
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:03,212
This evening's just getting started.
Sally Sloane. We got Sally Sloane.

433
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,262
You remember her?
She gave us lap dances!

434
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:07,049
- Sally.
- Derek has singles!

435
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,969
- He has singles!
- I gotta go home, sober up.

436
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,148
You wanna get out of here and go
find yourself some new trouble?

437
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:15,591
- No, thank you. No, thank you.
- Where is your holiday spirit?

438
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:17,512
With my wife and kid.

439
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:21,217
Gotta take a leak, then I'm sneaking
out of here, all right?

440
00:32:21,218 --> 00:32:24,660
You're no fun, D. No fun at all.

441
00:32:33,816 --> 00:32:35,209
Lisa, Lisa.

442
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,349
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop.

443
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,312
Come on, stop, no.

444
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,328
Fuck.

445
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,831
You need to stop it.

446
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,411
Who's there?

447
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:07,118
Stop. Okay. Okay.

448
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,591
Lisa, Lisa.

449
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:16,125
Oh, God, Lisa, Lisa. Stop. Stop.
Don't do that. Don't....

450
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:21,921
Stop, stop.

451
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:34,127
Lisa, stop.

452
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:37,004
Stop.

453
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,896
Stop.

454
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,902
Stop it.

455
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,610
- What? Derek.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

456
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:56,098
What's wrong? Derek!

457
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:07,386
If you don't feel like you can drive,
I have cab vouchers.

458
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:10,656
Cab vouchers for anybody
who can't drive. Don't want you hurt.

459
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:13,055
Come on, don't be shy.

460
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,947
Freak.

461
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:30,317
Well, well, well.
Living dangerously, aren't we?

462
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,106
Patrick, you silly old queen.

463
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:35,591
Dance with me.

464
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:38,992
Dance with me.

465
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,210
How was it?

466
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:07,220
The usual, baby.

467
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,054
Anything interesting happen?

468
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,326
No.

469
00:36:32,897 --> 00:36:34,509
Good morning.

470
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,513
Hey. Morning.

471
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:39,635
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

472
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:42,119
Man, you should've stayed.

473
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,257
Roger from Acquisitions tossed
his cookies on the Christmas tree.

474
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:47,132
Sorry I missed that.

475
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:58,204
Bad time?

476
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,736
No.

477
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:05,353
Joe wants to know when you'll
be done with the Ganz portfolio.

478
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:10,364
Sure.

479
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:18,254
Joe really likes the ladies, huh?

480
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:22,979
I-I wouldn't know.

481
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:41,417
Hey. All right if I take off?

482
00:37:41,418 --> 00:37:44,468
- Yeah. Go home.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

483
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:46,343
Okay.

484
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,218
Hey, Lisa.

485
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:29,369
Hey.

486
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:34,948
I owe you an apology
for the Christmas party.

487
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:39,480
I think that I sort of took you
by surprise.

488
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:44,450
Yeah, you know,
we both had a few drinks.

489
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:46,499
So let's just forget about it.

490
00:38:47,895 --> 00:38:49,813
What if I can't?

491
00:38:58,488 --> 00:39:00,928
Lisa, nothing happened.

492
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:07,249
All right, have it your way.
Nothing happened.

493
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,957
All right, get out of my car.

494
00:39:12,743 --> 00:39:14,616
Get out of my car right now.

495
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:18,235
Get out of my car.

496
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:19,891
Relax.

497
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:22,767
- Derek, relax.
- Come on. Out of my car.

498
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:25,601
- Get out of here.
- No one's around to see us.

499
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:29,916
God. I almost went insane today.
Having to pretend...

500
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:33,185
like I was concentrating on work,
when all I could think about--

501
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:36,019
Lisa! Get out of my car now!

502
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,723
Derek, what's wrong?

503
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:41,424
- What did I do?
- Hey, hey.

504
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:44,301
I don't know what's wrong,
whether you're dense or what...

505
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:47,658
but let me tell you something.
There's nothing going on between us.

506
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:51,406
Nothing! Okay? I wouldn't jeopardise
my job. For chrissakes, I work here.

507
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:53,804
Stop! Don't touch me. Just get out.

508
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:55,636
Get out.

509
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:57,580
Get out.

510
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,156
- Get out! Come on!
- God!

511
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:06,079
- Maybe you are an asshole.
- Yeah, all right. Get out.

512
00:40:38,862 --> 00:40:41,128
Sharon?

513
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:43,786
Shar?

514
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:48,886
Something I need to tell you.

515
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,253
What's wrong?

516
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:59,610
I spent the last hour and a half
talking my sister off the ledge.

517
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:01,789
- Sheila?
- Can you believe Tim's been having...

518
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,974
an affair with some random woman
at work for a year and a half?

519
00:41:06,193 --> 00:41:09,548
- How did she find out?
- Tim just blurted it out.

520
00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:13,035
He said he was leaving her.
With 3 kids.

521
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:16,523
- Yeah, that's tough.
- It's a disaster. If it were me--

522
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:19,967
No, that would never be you,
because I would never cheat on you.

523
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,016
I know.

524
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:26,288
Tim is an asshole.

525
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:28,555
Tell me about it.

526
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:34,570
So, what were you gonna tell me?

527
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:36,096
What?

528
00:41:36,097 --> 00:41:38,929
You said you had something
to tell me. What is it?

529
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:42,286
No.

530
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:47,255
Just a problem at work.
Nothing I can't handle.

531
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:51,310
Why didn't you tell me?

532
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:53,881
Honestly, there was nothing to tell.

533
00:41:53,882 --> 00:41:57,194
She grabbed your package,
flashed you in your car.

534
00:41:57,195 --> 00:41:59,199
Come on.
I thought we were best friends.

535
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,640
I cannot believe
you didn't tell me sooner.

536
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:04,212
- Ben, you think this is funny?
- Yes, I do.

537
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:07,613
I kind of thought maybe she was
into you a little. I just never figured--

538
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:10,532
I don't get it. You know, I....

539
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:12,494
Honestly, Ben.

540
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:15,546
" Hey, how are you?" I didn't--
I was just being nice.

541
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:17,508
That's all.

542
00:42:17,509 --> 00:42:20,036
You sure you didn't lead her on?
Just a little?

543
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:24,178
- No. Not a goddamn thing. Honestly.
- That girl is hot.

544
00:42:24,614 --> 00:42:28,058
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Report it to Human Resources.

545
00:42:28,188 --> 00:42:30,018
You're gonna get her fired?

546
00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:33,811
- I don't have a choice.
- Let's just be careful about this.

547
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:36,252
What if she says
that you came onto her?

548
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,516
No way.

549
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:40,219
We're talking history
of behaviour here, Derek.

550
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,532
When's the last time you had
a female assistant at your desk, huh?

551
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:45,232
People are gonna wonder.

552
00:42:57,395 --> 00:42:59,137
- Morning, Mr. Charles.
- Hey.

553
00:42:59,138 --> 00:43:00,707
- Hank back there?
- Go right in.

554
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,366
- Hey, Hank.
- Derek, hey.

555
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:06,242
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

556
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:14,830
I have.... I have a personal matter
I gotta talk to you about.

557
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:16,835
You know Lisa Sheridan, the temp?

558
00:43:16,836 --> 00:43:19,626
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She worked your desk for a while.

559
00:43:19,627 --> 00:43:22,808
Yeah, that's right. She did.

560
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:26,688
Hank, this is awkward, okay?

561
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:29,565
If you're here to file a complaint
about her performance...

562
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:31,047
you can save your breath.

563
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:33,662
Her agency called,
said she's not coming back in.

564
00:43:33,663 --> 00:43:35,797
They already sent a replacement.

565
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:39,181
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

566
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,841
They say why?

567
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,894
No.

568
00:43:46,854 --> 00:43:50,121
Why, was there some sort
of problem?

569
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:51,648
Problem?

570
00:43:51,649 --> 00:43:56,182
No. No problem. No problem.

571
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,371
I just thought she was way in
over her head, that's all.

572
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:05,989
- But if she already quit, then....
- She beat you to it.

573
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,646
Yeah.

574
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:13,748
Yeah.

575
00:44:16,408 --> 00:44:19,284
- Was there anything else?
- No. Guess not.

576
00:44:19,285 --> 00:44:21,943
- How's the new house?
- You know, couldn't be better.

577
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:23,687
- Tell Sharon I said hi.
- I will.

578
00:44:23,688 --> 00:44:26,825
Actually, you guys should come by
once we settle down. Come by.

579
00:44:26,826 --> 00:44:28,612
- That sounds great.
- All right.

580
00:44:28,613 --> 00:44:30,967
- See you, Hank.
- Bye-bye.

581
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,854
- So?
- She quit.

582
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:39,293
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

583
00:44:39,294 --> 00:44:41,035
Do you have a horseshoe
up your ass?

584
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:43,303
You are the luckiest bastard I know.

585
00:44:43,304 --> 00:44:44,567
Looks that way.

586
00:44:44,568 --> 00:44:46,704
Not a bad early Christmas present.

587
00:44:46,705 --> 00:44:49,101
All right.

588
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:16,258
Thank you.

589
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:19,222
Thank you. I'm getting
all these gifts. Look at this.

590
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:26,721
Friedrich?

591
00:45:27,113 --> 00:45:29,554
Hey, it's Derek Charles.

592
00:45:29,555 --> 00:45:33,826
Hey. How was your Christmas?

593
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:39,274
No, mine was great.
I had a great time with my family.

594
00:45:39,275 --> 00:45:42,849
No, I'm in the office working
for you right now.

595
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,289
Absolutely. That's what we do.
That's what we do.

596
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:48,473
Hey, you take a look
at that prospectus for me?

597
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,093
I told you.

598
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:55,142
I told you.

599
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,111
<i>Yeah. No, I think we're gonna
have a great New Year.</i>

600
00:46:08,176 --> 00:46:10,355
Baby, it's after 3?

601
00:46:10,356 --> 00:46:14,234
That's the last time I'm celebrating out
on New Years.

602
00:46:14,235 --> 00:46:19,729
Next year, we'll celebrate at home.
Just you, me, and Kyle.

603
00:46:25,178 --> 00:46:27,356
Aren't you gonna get that?

604
00:46:27,357 --> 00:46:29,534
No. It'll wait till the morning.

605
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:31,978
What if it's Ganz with the approval?

606
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:36,056
It's noon in Munich. Go on, lazy.

607
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,087
Ganz?

608
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:49,658
No.

609
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,232
What was that?

610
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:15,115
Nothing. I just gotta get a
new spam blocker.

611
00:48:02,977 --> 00:48:04,284
And then Joe was like:

612
00:48:04,285 --> 00:48:08,558
"Oh, we're not drinking. This is a
retreat. We're gonna stay sober.

613
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,431
Do some bonding."

614
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:13,440
If Joe said that, he must've
been drunk at the time.

615
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:16,709
Right? So I'll call you later
and check on you and Kyle.

616
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:18,278
Okay.

617
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lap dance. Lap
dance. Who brought up lap dance?

618
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:30,266
This is--  This is a business retreat.
This is work.

619
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:33,317
We are clocked in.
Unless it was Joe's idea.

620
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:35,933
Well, it's a brilliant idea,
so it must've been mine.

621
00:48:35,934 --> 00:48:38,939
All righty. Well, then,
let's see a show of hands...

622
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,602
of who wants to see
some hot, oily breasts...

623
00:48:42,603 --> 00:48:45,610
being jammed into their faces?
Derek, are you in?

624
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:47,048
I'm a married man.

625
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,140
- I don't have to pay for it.
- You're paying.

626
00:48:49,141 --> 00:48:51,146
- You just don't know it yet.
- Hear, hear.

627
00:48:51,147 --> 00:48:53,761
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's this?

628
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:55,026
A dirty martini.

629
00:48:55,027 --> 00:48:58,688
- No, I didn't....
- It's from the lady at the bar.

630
00:48:59,298 --> 00:49:02,959
<i>I do have to say I'm kind of a fan
of the waitress staff around here.</i>

631
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:04,252
<i>We should hit one of those clubs.</i>

632
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,383
Derek, are you okay?

633
00:49:06,602 --> 00:49:09,395
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought
I saw somebody I know.

634
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:13,071
Somebody you know,
or somebody you'd like to know?

635
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,539
He can't be tempted.

636
00:49:14,754 --> 00:49:16,417
Can't blame him.
Too scared of Sharon.

637
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:20,726
Speaking of Sharon, I said
I'd call her. I'll be right back.

638
00:49:23,282 --> 00:49:25,958
Hey. Hey, babe.

639
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,461
<i>How's the male bonding?</i>

640
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,970
As you can guess, everybody's wasted.

641
00:49:31,978 --> 00:49:35,402
In about half an hour, I'll be able....

642
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:37,990
<i>Derek, are you there?</i>

643
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:41,084
<i>Wait, I think Kyle wants
to say good night.</i>

644
00:49:41,301 --> 00:49:43,346
<i>Derek, are you still there?</i>

645
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:46,519
- Babe, I gotta call you right back.
- It'll just take a second.

646
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:49,613
- Say good night to Daddy.
- They're calling for me to come back.

647
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,872
- Honey, I'm gonna call you right back.
- Derek?

648
00:49:53,926 --> 00:49:54,959
Derek?

649
00:49:55,181 --> 00:49:56,381
Was that Sharon?

650
00:49:56,601 --> 00:49:59,063
I can always tell from
the pained look on your face...

651
00:49:59,277 --> 00:50:01,239
when you've been talking to her.

652
00:50:02,622 --> 00:50:04,251
How did you know I'd be here?

653
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:06,922
What's wrong? You don't look happy
to see me.

654
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,431
I'm not happy to see you.

655
00:50:09,645 --> 00:50:10,727
What are you doing here?

656
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:13,568
You said that you would
never jeopardise your job.

657
00:50:15,874 --> 00:50:18,038
That's why I quit,
so that we could be together.

658
00:50:18,257 --> 00:50:19,839
You misunderstood me.

659
00:50:20,054 --> 00:50:25,406
I'm married, happily married.
There will never be us...

660
00:50:25,615 --> 00:50:27,862
together, ever.

661
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:31,293
You're worried what Joe and Ben
might think.

662
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,008
I'll tell you what they'll think.

663
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:36,017
They'll think that we arranged it
and we did.

664
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:39,110
What are you talking about?

665
00:50:40,665 --> 00:50:42,377
I see what you're doing.

666
00:50:42,588 --> 00:50:46,429
One of us has to take charge,
and I guess that's gonna be me.

667
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:51,446
So you go back and you say your
good nights to the boys, and...

668
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,407
I'll be waiting in my room, 610.

669
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:54,908
I'm not coming to your room.

670
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,923
- You want me to come to yours?
- You're sick.

671
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:01,275
- You need help.
- I know.

672
00:51:02,614 --> 00:51:03,945
Help me, Derek.

673
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:06,576
You stay away from me.

674
00:51:11,476 --> 00:51:12,760
- Sharon?
- Sharon?

675
00:51:12,981 --> 00:51:15,359
It's Ben.
Dude, you done for the night?

676
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,117
No. I'm coming back.

677
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,683
Hey, come on, D, it's early.

678
00:51:23,893 --> 00:51:26,472
Let's hit my room, plunder the minibar,
charge it to Joe.

679
00:51:26,693 --> 00:51:31,997
No, I, I can't. That last drink
totally kicked my ass, man.

680
00:51:32,212 --> 00:51:35,885
All right, drunky. Don't forget,
9 a.m. tomorrow, Tiffany Room.

681
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,312
Joe's big rah-rah to the troops.

682
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:41,152
Yeah, 9 a.m.

683
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:43,245
Lightweight.

684
00:52:24,678 --> 00:52:25,676
Out.

685
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,519
Baby.

686
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:32,913
No.

687
00:52:39,018 --> 00:52:41,479
Does that feel good?

688
00:52:41,693 --> 00:52:43,357
No.

689
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:55,321
Hush, baby.

690
00:53:09,913 --> 00:53:12,456
No, please, stop.

691
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:22,660
Does that feel good?

692
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,464
Housekeeping.

693
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:42,559
- Sharon?
- Oh, sorry.

694
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:47,904
Oh, God.

695
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,610
Oh, shit.

696
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,994
Of course,
we here at Gage Bendix...

697
00:54:02,212 --> 00:54:04,541
have a couple advantages
over the competition...

698
00:54:04,762 --> 00:54:08,019
not the least of which is the fact
that we are privately held.

699
00:54:08,232 --> 00:54:12,024
We don't worry about the transparency
required of public companies.

700
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:14,920
Thank God, I was thinking
of sending out a search party.

701
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,591
I'm sorry. I overslept.

702
00:54:17,805 --> 00:54:19,219
You overslept.

703
00:54:19,435 --> 00:54:22,015
The second great advantage
is that most of our clients...

704
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:24,531
are high-net-worth individuals
more concerned...

705
00:54:24,745 --> 00:54:29,299
with preservation of capital than in
outsized gains in any single year....

706
00:54:29,511 --> 00:54:31,223
You all know
how to read a bar chart.

707
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,561
What is important here
is putting your clients at ease.

708
00:54:34,778 --> 00:54:37,953
One of the things I suggest
going forward in this difficult time...

709
00:54:38,165 --> 00:54:40,839
the credit crunch,
whatever you want to call it...

710
00:54:41,049 --> 00:54:43,343
is that they understand
that America is on sale.

711
00:54:43,557 --> 00:54:45,685
Excuse me, sir, your wife is here.

712
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,831
- It's Sharon.
- What about her?

713
00:54:52,044 --> 00:54:53,293
She's here.

714
00:54:53,508 --> 00:54:54,541
Excuse me, Joe.

715
00:54:57,311 --> 00:55:01,366
At any rate, I want to make sure that
you can go with confidence and say....

716
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:19,752
Here's your wife, sir.

717
00:55:21,183 --> 00:55:24,060
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you woke up. I went to the spa.

718
00:55:24,276 --> 00:55:25,441
What are you doing?

719
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,446
I thought you'd need an excuse
to get out of there.

720
00:55:27,663 --> 00:55:29,161
- You wanna get some lunch?
- Lunch?

721
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:31,838
Yeah, it's gorgeous outside.
I made a reservation--

722
00:55:32,052 --> 00:55:33,764
Hey.

723
00:55:33,975 --> 00:55:35,853
What do you think this is?

724
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,980
The morning after.

725
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:40,447
We didn't do anything last night.

726
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:43,333
You don't remember?

727
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:46,557
- Last night was perfect.
- Nothing happened!

728
00:55:46,768 --> 00:55:49,561
Baby, not so loud.
It'll cause a scene.

729
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,026
A scene?

730
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:53,572
Right. That's exactly what we need.

731
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:56,122
- What are you doing?
- I wanna give you a scene.

732
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:59,434
I'll take you into Joe and the rest
so you can tell them all that--

733
00:55:59,645 --> 00:56:01,772
- Why ruin this?
- There is no "this."

734
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,567
Don't say that.

735
00:56:03,784 --> 00:56:05,365
Goddamn it, come here.

736
00:56:11,266 --> 00:56:12,729
What's wrong with you?

737
00:56:14,194 --> 00:56:15,857
Why are you acting like a stranger?

738
00:56:16,074 --> 00:56:20,331
That is exactly what I am to you, a
stranger, somebody you do not know.

739
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,630
Now either you go in there...

740
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:26,021
and you tell them your lies,
or you leave me the hell alone.

741
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:30,868
Don't you put this all on me, Derek.

742
00:56:31,082 --> 00:56:34,209
We both knew what we were getting
into from the very beginning.

743
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:35,509
What?

744
00:56:35,723 --> 00:56:37,470
The first time we met in the elevator.

745
00:56:38,691 --> 00:56:39,857
Our dirty martini.

746
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:42,651
The Christmas party.

747
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:46,750
You said that you wished you were
single so that we could be together.

748
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:48,252
No. No, I did not.

749
00:56:48,474 --> 00:56:50,222
- You did! You said it!
- No! I did not!

750
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,357
If I go in that room and tell them,
it'll be the truth.

751
00:56:59,447 --> 00:57:00,779
Is that what you want?

752
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,624
You want me to tell them the truth?

753
00:57:07,893 --> 00:57:10,140
Ready when you are.

754
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:12,607
Hey, hey.

755
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:14,576
Listen to me!

756
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:17,842
What are you doing?

757
00:57:18,052 --> 00:57:21,844
Hit me. You can do
anything you want to me.

758
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,024
You know what?

759
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:30,539
It doesn't matter what you do or what
you say or what goes on in that brain...

760
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,719
because there's never gonna be
anything between us, never.

761
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:36,224
Okay, Lisa?

762
00:57:36,445 --> 00:57:38,109
Derek.

763
00:57:43,553 --> 00:57:45,098
Derek?

764
00:57:47,734 --> 00:57:49,315
Derek?

765
00:58:00,568 --> 00:58:02,066
I realise we went a little long.

766
00:58:02,282 --> 00:58:05,456
I thought some of the questions you
raised were worth going over...

767
00:58:05,668 --> 00:58:07,499
and I apologise for the length of it.

768
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:11,474
Those of you with tee times, and I
have one myself, we will still make....

769
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,484
Everything okay?

770
00:58:25,776 --> 00:58:27,821
- Top you off.
- Thank you.

771
00:58:28,954 --> 00:58:30,750
- D?
- Oh, no, no, thanks.

772
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:32,208
You're not drinking?

773
00:58:32,424 --> 00:58:35,598
No, not this evening, man.
I'm sticking to the iced tea.

774
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:39,613
That's a first.

775
00:58:41,663 --> 00:58:43,577
- You feeling all right?
- Yeah.

776
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:45,383
He's just growing up.

777
00:58:46,345 --> 00:58:48,009
Man.

778
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:09,797
No goddamn way. Come on.
No. Hey. Hey, get up.

779
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:12,548
Hey. Lisa.

780
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,931
Come on, get up, get up.
You can't stay here.

781
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,729
Come on. I'll drag you out of here.
Let's--

782
00:59:21,462 --> 00:59:23,090
No. No, no, no.

783
00:59:28,486 --> 00:59:31,577
I need a paramedic up here at 583.
I have a woman in the room.

784
00:59:31,788 --> 00:59:34,464
I think she's overdosed on some sort
of prescription pills.

785
00:59:34,673 --> 00:59:36,302
Yeah, yeah. Hurry! Now, please!

786
00:59:36,513 --> 00:59:38,058
Okay.

787
00:59:40,317 --> 00:59:42,481
Breathe. Breathe.

788
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,901
Bitch, breathe.

789
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:54,866
- Derek. What's going on?
- I'll call you.

790
01:00:12,884 --> 01:00:13,882
Hello?

791
01:00:14,096 --> 01:00:15,760
Hi, Ben. It's Sharon.

792
01:00:15,977 --> 01:00:17,725
Hi, Sharon, hi.

793
01:00:17,942 --> 01:00:19,606
I'm sorry to disturb you.

794
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,701
I was trying to reach Derek,
and he usually calls me by now.

795
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:24,795
I can't reach him on his cell phone.

796
01:00:25,007 --> 01:00:27,220
I was hoping he might be with you?

797
01:00:31,362 --> 01:00:35,320
Yeah, there-- There was
a kind of incident.

798
01:00:35,542 --> 01:00:37,088
Is he all right?

799
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,139
Ben?

800
01:00:41,354 --> 01:00:44,528
I think he should tell you himself.

801
01:00:45,826 --> 01:00:49,120
Ben, you're scaring me now.
Where is he?

802
01:00:55,025 --> 01:00:56,736
Excuse me. Is she okay?

803
01:00:56,947 --> 01:00:59,526
The doctors are still working on her.

804
01:01:00,584 --> 01:01:05,091
Derek. Oh, my God. I've been worried
out of my mind. Are you okay?

805
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:08,602
What are you doing here? It's okay,
it's okay. I'm good, I'm good.

806
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:10,568
- Where's Kyle?
- Julie is watching him.

807
01:01:10,786 --> 01:01:11,902
- What happened?
- Sharon.

808
01:01:12,123 --> 01:01:13,870
Mr. Charles. How you doing?

809
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:16,799
My name is Monica Reese.
I'm the investigating detective.

810
01:01:17,015 --> 01:01:19,391
- Detective?
- Yeah. This is my wife, Sharon.

811
01:01:19,606 --> 01:01:22,149
- She just got here.
- So you haven't told her?

812
01:01:22,366 --> 01:01:24,494
- What?
- Would you prefer to talk in private?

813
01:01:24,707 --> 01:01:29,178
- In private? What's happening, Derek?
- It's okay. Please, we can talk.

814
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:32,730
I've gone over the initial statement
you gave to the police on the scene.

815
01:01:32,942 --> 01:01:35,272
I just need to clarify a few things,
okay?

816
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:37,038
Let's sit down.

817
01:01:41,093 --> 01:01:46,017
Detective Reese, 0300 hours,
January 15th.

818
01:01:48,118 --> 01:01:51,410
This young woman, Lisa Sheridan,
she works in your office?

819
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,592
Lisa the temp?
What happened to her?

820
01:01:53,804 --> 01:01:55,217
Yeah, she tried to hurt herself.

821
01:01:55,433 --> 01:01:57,265
Why? What? Well, what did she do?

822
01:01:57,482 --> 01:01:59,444
Mrs. Charles, I'm sorry.

823
01:01:59,656 --> 01:02:02,367
I need to get the story
in your husband's own words.

824
01:02:02,582 --> 01:02:03,700
Apparently, so do I.

825
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:07,136
Mr. Charles, this Lisa Sheridan--

826
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,726
Yeah, she worked with us
2 weeks.

827
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,984
What, you've only known her
for 2 weeks?

828
01:02:12,198 --> 01:02:13,280
Approximately 2 weeks.

829
01:02:13,494 --> 01:02:16,835
Long enough for her to fantasize
that you two were having an affair?

830
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:19,723
- What?
- No. No.

831
01:02:19,932 --> 01:02:22,941
She came on to me
at the Christmas party...

832
01:02:23,152 --> 01:02:27,455
and then in the parking garage.

833
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:29,545
And then she showed up
at the retreat...

834
01:02:30,258 --> 01:02:31,970
at my hotel, and I rejected her.

835
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:35,225
And when--  Excuse me.
And when you rejected her...

836
01:02:35,442 --> 01:02:38,985
she tried to commit suicide, naked,
in your bed, in your hotel room.

837
01:02:39,204 --> 01:02:42,962
Wait, wait, wait. She was naked
in your bed, Derek?

838
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,672
- Mrs. Charles.
- She was naked in your hotel room?

839
01:02:45,893 --> 01:02:46,927
Please.

840
01:02:47,148 --> 01:02:49,858
- Would you say this affair was--
- There was no affair.

841
01:02:50,075 --> 01:02:51,572
There was no affair.

842
01:02:51,789 --> 01:02:54,962
You're saying she made the thing up
in her head with no help from you?

843
01:02:55,175 --> 01:02:56,971
That is exactly what I'm saying.

844
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:59,310
Why do you think she'd pick you?

845
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:03,481
I don't know. Maybe I said something
that she took the wrong way.

846
01:03:03,702 --> 01:03:05,415
- Baby, come on.
- Like what? Like what?

847
01:03:05,627 --> 01:03:08,467
What exactly did you say
that she took the wrong way, Derek?

848
01:03:08,677 --> 01:03:12,185
- I'm gonna have to ask you to le--
- No, no, she's not going anywhere.

849
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:15,906
I didn't say anything to her.
I did not lead her on.

850
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:17,915
You had no idea she'd be
at the hotel?

851
01:03:18,126 --> 01:03:19,708
I don't know how she got
in my room.

852
01:03:19,924 --> 01:03:23,716
She told the hotel clerk she was your
wife and she wanted to surprise you.

853
01:03:23,936 --> 01:03:25,934
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Stop, Sharon.

854
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:29,195
- Did you have sex with her?
- No, I did not...

855
01:03:29,413 --> 01:03:30,911
have sex with her.

856
01:03:32,382 --> 01:03:35,426
Sharon, come on. I need for you and I
not to fall apart right now.

857
01:03:35,642 --> 01:03:37,936
- Mr. Charles. Please.
- Hold on.

858
01:03:39,321 --> 01:03:42,615
Just stay here.
Please just stay here.

859
01:03:47,766 --> 01:03:50,227
Look, I don't care if you're doing
this girl or not.

860
01:03:50,442 --> 01:03:53,366
I'm not doing this girl, okay?
Never have.

861
01:03:53,577 --> 01:03:55,492
- Okay.
- Okay.

862
01:03:57,298 --> 01:03:58,331
Detective?

863
01:03:58,551 --> 01:04:00,764
It's the doctor. I'll be right back.

864
01:04:02,064 --> 01:04:03,181
Sharon.

865
01:04:03,402 --> 01:04:06,029
I swear to God
this is just a misunderstanding.

866
01:04:06,244 --> 01:04:07,528
A misunderstanding.

867
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:11,626
A girl tries to kill herself because of
you, it's just a misunderstanding?

868
01:04:11,846 --> 01:04:13,344
You think I'm gonna believe that?

869
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,558
- Do you believe me?
- No, I don't believe you!

870
01:04:15,776 --> 01:04:18,452
- You didn't even call your son back--
- Sharon, listen.

871
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:20,824
Seems they pumped her out in time.

872
01:04:21,043 --> 01:04:23,422
Probably tomorrow they'll take her
out of the lCU...

873
01:04:23,636 --> 01:04:27,178
and take her up to the 5th floor
for psychiatric evaluation.

874
01:04:27,398 --> 01:04:29,775
That's great news. Okay, thank you.

875
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:33,949
She was lucid enough to give a name
to the doctor in case of emergencies.

876
01:04:41,862 --> 01:04:43,777
You still wanna stick to your story?

877
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,640
Sharon. Sharon,
you gonna talk to me?

878
01:05:43,861 --> 01:05:46,572
Thanks, Julie. I'll call you tomorrow.

879
01:05:46,787 --> 01:05:48,035
Sharon, is everything okay?

880
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:50,414
Julie. Hey, thank you.

881
01:05:50,634 --> 01:05:52,180
Sharon.

882
01:05:54,898 --> 01:05:56,277
Sharon.

883
01:05:56,988 --> 01:05:58,784
Hey.

884
01:05:58,995 --> 01:06:00,409
Sharon.

885
01:06:01,587 --> 01:06:02,919
Can we talk?

886
01:06:04,179 --> 01:06:07,104
Sharon, I just-- Now listen,
Sharon, all I wanna do--

887
01:06:07,315 --> 01:06:10,275
What, what, what, Derek? What?
What do you want?

888
01:06:10,492 --> 01:06:12,620
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Now you wanna talk.

889
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:15,793
- Sharon, you know me.
- No, I don't know you.

890
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,804
I don't know you. I know the Derek
that told me everything.

891
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,648
- Oh, come on.
- But you? I have no idea who you are.

892
01:06:21,864 --> 01:06:22,860
Sharon, I was wrong.

893
01:06:23,075 --> 01:06:25,537
If I hadn't gone to the ER,
if I hadn't called Ben...

894
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:27,333
would you have even told me?

895
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:29,510
What are you, crazy?
Of course I would have.

896
01:06:29,722 --> 01:06:31,885
Like you told me about
the Christmas party, huh?

897
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:33,686
Or what about the parking garage?

898
01:06:33,904 --> 01:06:37,362
Yes, you told me about you being
in a parking garage with this woman.

899
01:06:37,582 --> 01:06:39,246
What else haven't you told me,
Derek?

900
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:41,544
All I'm hearing
are things you haven't told me.

901
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:44,259
I was wrong. I should've told you
the truth from the--

902
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,144
You should have! Why didn't you?

903
01:06:46,361 --> 01:06:49,203
Because I didn't think
it was a big deal in the first place...

904
01:06:49,414 --> 01:06:50,745
...and then I was embarrassed.

905
01:06:50,959 --> 01:06:54,919
- How do I say it without looking--?
- Guilty? Guilty?

906
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:59,361
I'm your wife, Derek. You're supposed
to trust me. You let this happen.

907
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,698
You think I encouraged this?

908
01:07:01,913 --> 01:07:06,169
Don't give me that innocent bullshit.
I was there at your desk. I saw you.

909
01:07:06,385 --> 01:07:09,062
I saw how you played games
and you played those girls...

910
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:12,279
but you never did that to me.
Until now.

911
01:07:14,037 --> 01:07:16,533
What is this? Is this about me
wanting to go to school?

912
01:07:16,754 --> 01:07:18,335
God, Sharon, it is not like that.

913
01:07:18,552 --> 01:07:21,048
This woman is sick, okay?
Nothing happened between--

914
01:07:21,269 --> 01:07:24,028
Do I ever ask you for anything?
I don't ask you for anything.

915
01:07:24,238 --> 01:07:25,819
All I asked you was to be honest.

916
01:07:26,036 --> 01:07:27,282
- I told you the truth!
- No.

917
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:28,876
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

918
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:33,427
- I told you the truth.
- No, you didn't. You lied.

919
01:07:33,644 --> 01:07:35,806
We made a vow
on our wedding day...

920
01:07:36,027 --> 01:07:38,570
that we would tell each other
everything.

921
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,413
No matter how ugly
or uncomfortable it might be.

922
01:07:44,973 --> 01:07:48,017
I specifically asked you,
"Did anything happen at that party?"

923
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:49,696
And what did you tell me?

924
01:07:49,906 --> 01:07:51,654
- You said no.
- I know.

925
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:53,952
- I don't know what to believe right now.
- Okay.

926
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,169
Hey, hey, hey.

927
01:07:55,383 --> 01:07:57,962
I think I need to be alone.
I think I need to be alone.

928
01:07:58,183 --> 01:08:00,265
Stop, stop, stop. Okay?

929
01:08:00,483 --> 01:08:02,564
Come on. Sharon. Please?

930
01:08:03,325 --> 01:08:05,657
- Sharon, come on.
- Get out of my house!

931
01:08:05,876 --> 01:08:08,838
This is crazy, Sharon!
Don't you see what's happening?

932
01:08:09,054 --> 01:08:10,681
Get out of my house.

933
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,212
Nothing happened with this....

934
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,395
Okay. You know what?

935
01:08:24,606 --> 01:08:28,232
You just tell me what you want me
to do and that's what I'll do!

936
01:08:28,451 --> 01:08:30,912
Well, first, I suggest you pack
your toothbrush.

937
01:08:31,128 --> 01:08:34,300
Then I want you to get your socks,
your shaving kit, your underwear...

938
01:08:34,513 --> 01:08:36,927
your prophylactics, if
you need them, and get out!

939
01:08:37,147 --> 01:08:39,275
- And go where, Sharon?
- To hell.

940
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:43,290
But until then,
I suggest maybe the Four Seasons.

941
01:08:48,435 --> 01:08:50,016
Sharon!

942
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:06,357
Miss Sheridan?

943
01:09:07,415 --> 01:09:10,624
Hey, I'm Monica Reese.
I'm a detective assigned to your case.

944
01:09:11,093 --> 01:09:12,841
- Come in.
- Thanks.

945
01:09:15,774 --> 01:09:16,976
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

946
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:20,656
They won't let me take a shower
or wash my hair.

947
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:23,633
Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.

948
01:09:25,892 --> 01:09:29,269
So you feel like talking
about the other night?

949
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:31,942
Have you spoken to Derek?

950
01:09:32,163 --> 01:09:33,447
Yeah.

951
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,549
And he's all right?

952
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:38,053
Relatively speaking.

953
01:09:38,267 --> 01:09:39,895
When can I see him?

954
01:09:40,107 --> 01:09:42,818
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

955
01:09:43,033 --> 01:09:45,826
- Why?
- Miss, I don't mean to upset you...

956
01:09:46,043 --> 01:09:49,004
but I don't think Mr. Charles
wants to speak to you...

957
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:52,478
or continue any kind of contact.

958
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,314
Then why did he send me these?

959
01:09:58,919 --> 01:10:00,547
He sent you flowers?

960
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:04,221
Lilies. My favourite.

961
01:10:04,438 --> 01:10:05,436
Beautiful.

962
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:11,920
Yeah.

963
01:10:14,889 --> 01:10:18,480
Miss Sheridan, could you tell me
what happened at the hotel?

964
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:20,737
- Why you were there?
- Didn't Derek tell you?

965
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:24,542
Yeah, but I'd really like
to get your version.

966
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:27,713
Well, there's not much to tell.

967
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:31,819
He asked me to meet him
at the hotel.

968
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,576
And you agreed?

969
01:10:34,037 --> 01:10:35,664
Of course.

970
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:37,290
And then what happened?

971
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,761
I think you can guess what we did.

972
01:10:41,478 --> 01:10:43,521
Yeah. You.... You slept together.

973
01:10:43,735 --> 01:10:45,018
Yes.

974
01:10:46,244 --> 01:10:47,825
Well, Derek denies it, so....

975
01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:52,044
He's just trying to protect me.

976
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:54,217
He's being a gentleman.

977
01:10:54,939 --> 01:10:56,105
Right.

978
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:01,919
The next day, he told me that his wife
wouldn't give him a divorce.

979
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,341
You know the kind of woman
that will never let go?

980
01:11:04,554 --> 01:11:06,267
Yeah.

981
01:11:06,478 --> 01:11:08,772
Then he said
that we couldn't see each other.

982
01:11:09,655 --> 01:11:11,450
I overreacted.

983
01:11:12,163 --> 01:11:15,374
I didn't realise at the time
that he was just being noble.

984
01:11:16,176 --> 01:11:19,137
Noble? What do you mean, "noble"?

985
01:11:19,353 --> 01:11:22,695
He was thinking about his little boy,
Kyle.

986
01:11:22,907 --> 01:11:24,989
What the break-up would do to him.

987
01:11:27,046 --> 01:11:29,625
Lisa. Can I call you Lisa?

988
01:11:30,307 --> 01:11:31,805
Yeah.

989
01:11:32,022 --> 01:11:34,184
How would you, you know...

990
01:11:34,404 --> 01:11:38,031
characterise your relationship
with Derek?

991
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:40,880
- Lovers.
- Yeah, I got that.

992
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:45,397
But I mean, do you really believe
he's in love with you?

993
01:11:45,608 --> 01:11:47,570
I'm not a home wrecker.

994
01:11:49,454 --> 01:11:53,413
Monica, I'm not stealing him away.
Their marriage is over.

995
01:11:56,812 --> 01:12:00,023
I do feel bad about his wife, though.

996
01:12:00,491 --> 01:12:01,904
Well, how so?

997
01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:03,619
Well, it can't be easy...

998
01:12:03,835 --> 01:12:07,462
to find out that your husband's
in love with someone else.

999
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:09,476
Right.

1000
01:12:10,524 --> 01:12:12,985
I just hope that she doesn't do
something stupid.

1001
01:12:15,709 --> 01:12:18,169
I don't have to tell you the impact
this could have.

1002
01:12:18,384 --> 01:12:21,511
- Even a whiff of impropriety.
- Impropriety. There is no impropriety!

1003
01:12:21,728 --> 01:12:24,605
This is just a sick fantasy
from a very disturbed girl.

1004
01:12:24,821 --> 01:12:27,366
Who might retaliate
with a sexual harassment lawsuit.

1005
01:12:27,581 --> 01:12:29,460
I was the one
who was sexually harassed.

1006
01:12:29,672 --> 01:12:32,882
I can't believe this is happening
to me. This is like a nightmare.

1007
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,311
By now you're probably wishing
you had banged her.

1008
01:12:35,524 --> 01:12:37,487
Goddamn it, Joe!

1009
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:42,620
Derek, calm down. I believe you,
and I'll back you all the way on this.

1010
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:44,922
If we find out
there was something going on....

1011
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:47,220
That's not gonna happen.
There's nothing.

1012
01:12:47,438 --> 01:12:50,447
Good. Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

1013
01:12:51,076 --> 01:12:54,833
- I'm putting Ben on the Ganz account.
- No. Ganz is my client--

1014
01:12:55,048 --> 01:12:56,045
- Look--
- No, Joe.

1015
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,841
I'm not losing my client over this.

1016
01:12:58,058 --> 01:13:01,899
Take a little time off, just until
this blows over. Focus on Sharon.

1017
01:13:02,113 --> 01:13:03,445
Oh, Jesus.

1018
01:13:04,788 --> 01:13:06,167
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1019
01:13:06,377 --> 01:13:09,004
Derek, there's a Detective Reese here
to see you.

1020
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:13,013
Come on.
You think I sent her flowers?

1021
01:13:13,233 --> 01:13:17,490
My assistant has all my personal
information in his computer.

1022
01:13:18,082 --> 01:13:21,044
She must have accessed them
when she temped for me.

1023
01:13:23,433 --> 01:13:27,774
This is Lisa's journal.
It's a sort of diary, I guess...

1024
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:29,786
- that she was keeping.
- Okay.

1025
01:13:29,997 --> 01:13:32,410
It's a rather graphic
and detailed account...

1026
01:13:32,632 --> 01:13:36,305
of your various sexual liaisons
together.

1027
01:13:36,519 --> 01:13:39,313
- My what?
- I have to warn you, it's....

1028
01:13:45,006 --> 01:13:46,468
"We...."

1029
01:13:53,785 --> 01:13:55,497
This is bullshit.

1030
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:58,670
None of this happened.
I've never been to her apartment.

1031
01:13:58,885 --> 01:14:00,467
I've never touched her.

1032
01:14:00,683 --> 01:14:04,607
Well, according to these entries,
you are quite the accomplished lover.

1033
01:14:04,821 --> 01:14:08,412
Oh, and apparently,
you made some promises to her.

1034
01:14:08,626 --> 01:14:10,290
Promises to divorce your wife and--

1035
01:14:10,508 --> 01:14:12,838
Okay, detective.

1036
01:14:13,057 --> 01:14:14,805
You seem smart.

1037
01:14:15,566 --> 01:14:17,147
You can't possibly believe that.

1038
01:14:17,364 --> 01:14:20,907
Look, the only thing that matters
is that she believes this.

1039
01:14:21,126 --> 01:14:24,669
So there has to be something I can do
to protect myself, right? My family?

1040
01:14:24,889 --> 01:14:27,301
Sure.
You could file a restraining order.

1041
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:28,639
Let's do that.

1042
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:30,821
- But that might not be necessary.
- Why not?

1043
01:14:31,035 --> 01:14:33,448
Because Lisa's sister flew down
from San Francisco...

1044
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:36,545
and took Lisa back with her
earlier today.

1045
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:43,065
I can't say I'm unhappy to hear that.

1046
01:14:44,286 --> 01:14:46,915
Maybe now she'll get the help
that she needs.

1047
01:16:32,898 --> 01:16:35,657
You ready? Let's go for it.

1048
01:16:36,494 --> 01:16:40,370
- Hey.
- Kyle. Hey, baby.

1049
01:16:58,357 --> 01:17:00,569
It's my birthday next week.

1050
01:17:01,995 --> 01:17:03,541
Happy birthday.

1051
01:17:10,524 --> 01:17:12,568
Have dinner with me?

1052
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:16,995
Come on, Sharon.

1053
01:17:19,595 --> 01:17:21,509
Move your foot, Derek.

1054
01:17:51,953 --> 01:17:53,201
What do you think?

1055
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:55,787
Be honest.

1056
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,737
Derek, your menu. Your menu.

1057
01:18:03,951 --> 01:18:06,531
- Oh, my menu, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1058
01:18:11,936 --> 01:18:13,934
Sharon, this means a lot to me.

1059
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:16,907
I missed you.

1060
01:18:17,121 --> 01:18:20,830
And, I don't know, there's just so much
I wanna tell you.

1061
01:18:21,259 --> 01:18:23,303
It's your party, birthday boy.

1062
01:18:29,035 --> 01:18:30,069
You look beautiful.

1063
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:33,166
I love you.

1064
01:18:34,804 --> 01:18:36,885
Sharon, I just wanna be home.

1065
01:18:37,397 --> 01:18:39,061
Okay, it's been 3 months.

1066
01:18:39,278 --> 01:18:44,533
And I'll do whatever it takes to fix this,
to make us work again...

1067
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:47,846
your studies, you and Kyle,
I mean...

1068
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,553
you name it, I'll do it.

1069
01:18:59,428 --> 01:19:01,009
I got you something.

1070
01:19:03,818 --> 01:19:05,530
- Should I just--?
- No.

1071
01:19:06,912 --> 01:19:09,490
Let's see how
the rest of the evening goes.

1072
01:19:10,548 --> 01:19:13,342
And welcome to "Fact or Fiction. "

1073
01:19:13,559 --> 01:19:16,137
I'm your host, Rod Baker.

1074
01:19:16,442 --> 01:19:21,200
And on today's show, let's welcome
back our champion, Bunny!

1075
01:19:37,388 --> 01:19:39,635
Hi. I'm Sharon's friend, Kate.

1076
01:19:40,523 --> 01:19:41,557
You're...?

1077
01:19:42,154 --> 01:19:45,197
Samantha. Mrs. Charles is at dinner.

1078
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:48,208
Sharon told me to drop by.
I have this present for Kyle.

1079
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:49,839
I'm just gonna run it up to him.

1080
01:19:50,055 --> 01:19:51,518
Oh, you can't, he's sleeping.

1081
01:19:51,728 --> 01:19:52,725
I won't wake him.

1082
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:54,770
Maybe you should come back
another time.

1083
01:19:54,988 --> 01:19:56,653
But I'm here now.

1084
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:58,416
I....

1085
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:02,385
I get it, you're just doing your job.
Good.

1086
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,678
Do you need me to call Sharon?

1087
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:06,354
Yeah.

1088
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:08,399
Okay.

1089
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:18,805
Sharon. Hey, it's Kate.

1090
01:20:19,696 --> 01:20:23,203
Where am I? I'm at your house,
of course. You told me to drop by.

1091
01:20:23,834 --> 01:20:24,868
She forgot.

1092
01:20:26,301 --> 01:20:28,428
No, Samantha just wanted me
to give you a call.

1093
01:20:28,641 --> 01:20:30,139
She was a little bit concerned.

1094
01:20:30,356 --> 01:20:34,494
No. No, no, no.
Don't be upset with her.

1095
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:37,831
No, God, come on,
she was just doing her job.

1096
01:20:38,842 --> 01:20:42,101
Great. All right, have an
amazing dinner. Tell Derek I said hi.

1097
01:20:42,313 --> 01:20:43,726
Oh, Sharon, hold on.

1098
01:20:43,942 --> 01:20:45,405
Do you need to talk to her?

1099
01:20:45,615 --> 01:20:47,197
No, no, I'm fine.

1100
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:51,213
All right, I'll catch up with you
in the morning. Bye, honey.

1101
01:20:52,304 --> 01:20:53,718
I'll be back in a sec.

1102
01:20:54,603 --> 01:20:55,637
Yeah.

1103
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:18,343
Sharon, you know,
I miss you and I love you...

1104
01:21:18,558 --> 01:21:20,721
and I know that you miss me too.

1105
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:26,998
I do miss you, but I don't know
if that's enough.

1106
01:21:34,109 --> 01:21:35,857
We're not talking about divorce,
right?

1107
01:21:36,074 --> 01:21:38,703
I don't come from a family of divorce.

1108
01:21:38,918 --> 01:21:42,211
Mom and Dad'll be celebrating their
30th anniversary in 3 months.

1109
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:45,393
I look at them and I wonder
if that can ever be us.

1110
01:21:45,607 --> 01:21:48,900
It is us. It can be us, will be us.

1111
01:22:01,535 --> 01:22:04,662
I need you to understand
that nothing happened with that girl.

1112
01:22:04,879 --> 01:22:09,516
I know I should've been honest
with you from the beginning...

1113
01:22:09,728 --> 01:22:11,392
and I wasn't.

1114
01:22:12,614 --> 01:22:14,991
And that will never happen again.

1115
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,167
But I love you.

1116
01:22:17,378 --> 01:22:21,517
I mean, I love you with all my heart,
and I love my son too.

1117
01:22:27,956 --> 01:22:29,668
I guess Kyle does miss his daddy.

1118
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,553
Does Sharon...miss Daddy?

1119
01:22:35,063 --> 01:22:37,905
I will do anything, anything.

1120
01:22:38,742 --> 01:22:41,072
- Anything?
- You name it.

1121
01:22:44,302 --> 01:22:47,394
Oh, I guess the evening's
going good.

1122
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:52,828
What about the Benz?

1123
01:22:54,252 --> 01:22:56,380
- The Benz.
- My Benz?

1124
01:22:56,593 --> 01:22:59,969
I just-- Oh, yes.
I got that key right here.

1125
01:23:01,233 --> 01:23:02,862
You know, it's....

1126
01:23:07,462 --> 01:23:08,496
Missed you.

1127
01:23:24,352 --> 01:23:25,636
See you later!

1128
01:23:25,857 --> 01:23:27,189
You too!

1129
01:23:42,497 --> 01:23:43,910
Okay, it works, it works.

1130
01:23:44,126 --> 01:23:46,504
Welcome home, baby.

1131
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,755
You driving my car.

1132
01:23:48,976 --> 01:23:51,769
- You guys got back so fast.
- Hey.

1133
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,068
Any trouble with Kyle?

1134
01:23:53,282 --> 01:23:55,994
No, he was a doll.
But you just missed your friend.

1135
01:23:56,209 --> 01:23:58,371
- What friend?
- You know, your friend Kate?

1136
01:23:58,591 --> 01:23:59,589
I don't know a Kate.

1137
01:23:59,804 --> 01:24:01,635
She was here.
She had something for Kyle.

1138
01:24:01,852 --> 01:24:03,350
Oh, my God! Where's Kyle?

1139
01:24:03,566 --> 01:24:05,444
- His crib.
- Somebody was inside the house?

1140
01:24:05,656 --> 01:24:07,237
- Yeah.
- How long were they here for?

1141
01:24:07,454 --> 01:24:11,211
Just a few minutes. What's wrong?
You said it was okay!

1142
01:24:11,426 --> 01:24:12,673
Kyle?

1143
01:24:14,226 --> 01:24:15,392
She took my baby.

1144
01:24:15,606 --> 01:24:17,734
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1145
01:24:19,244 --> 01:24:20,409
What happened? Tell me.

1146
01:24:20,623 --> 01:24:23,084
She said she had something for Kyle
and then she left.

1147
01:24:23,298 --> 01:24:25,427
She left? Kyle's not in his room!

1148
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,553
Call 911! Now!

1149
01:24:28,565 --> 01:24:30,229
Kyle?

1150
01:24:38,349 --> 01:24:40,430
Kyle?

1151
01:24:40,648 --> 01:24:44,239
Kyle? Son?

1152
01:24:47,881 --> 01:24:49,628
Kyle!

1153
01:24:55,573 --> 01:24:57,986
Oh, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

1154
01:25:02,053 --> 01:25:03,681
Kyle, oh.

1155
01:25:06,275 --> 01:25:09,783
She couldn't have got far.
She couldn't have got far.

1156
01:25:21,994 --> 01:25:24,372
We'll wait for the blood work.
It appears he's fine.

1157
01:25:24,587 --> 01:25:26,916
I don't see any reason
why you can't take him home.

1158
01:25:27,136 --> 01:25:29,134
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

1159
01:25:32,613 --> 01:25:34,111
Hey.

1160
01:25:34,745 --> 01:25:36,243
How's he doing?

1161
01:25:36,459 --> 01:25:37,922
Doctor says he's fine.

1162
01:25:38,132 --> 01:25:42,007
Well, I'm not fine.
She was in our house.

1163
01:25:42,228 --> 01:25:44,225
And now our son
is in a hospital bed.

1164
01:25:44,445 --> 01:25:46,857
You said she was in San Francisco.
Why is she back?

1165
01:25:47,077 --> 01:25:48,873
And how did she even know
we'd be out?

1166
01:25:49,084 --> 01:25:50,748
Obviously she was watching
your house.

1167
01:25:50,965 --> 01:25:52,380
We need you to find her.

1168
01:25:52,596 --> 01:25:54,760
I will do everything in my power
to find her.

1169
01:25:54,979 --> 01:25:57,392
One of you better do something
about this woman.

1170
01:25:58,449 --> 01:25:59,912
Or I will.

1171
01:26:03,633 --> 01:26:05,345
So, what am I supposed to do now?

1172
01:26:05,556 --> 01:26:07,054
- Buy a gun?
- Please.

1173
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:08,898
We'll have our unit tracking her.

1174
01:26:09,109 --> 01:26:11,688
In the meantime, you better beef up
your security system.

1175
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:14,622
She could have hurt my son.
My son.

1176
01:26:36,284 --> 01:26:38,862
Okay. You don't wanna go to sleep?

1177
01:26:39,084 --> 01:26:41,046
- Kyle. It's okay, baby.
- It's okay.

1178
01:26:42,973 --> 01:26:44,553
Oh, no.

1179
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:47,267
Oh, no. God.

1180
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:50,992
Jesus.

1181
01:26:51,918 --> 01:26:53,547
This psycho.

1182
01:26:53,758 --> 01:26:55,005
She never left.

1183
01:27:07,345 --> 01:27:10,972
Yeah, I need to speak
to Detective Reese immediately.

1184
01:27:11,191 --> 01:27:13,070
My name, Derek Charles.

1185
01:27:13,323 --> 01:27:15,035
Yeah, she knows me.

1186
01:27:15,246 --> 01:27:17,290
This is an emergency.
I need to speak to her.

1187
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:22,141
Hi, it's Lisa, sorry you missed me.
Leave me a message after the beep.

1188
01:27:23,357 --> 01:27:27,114
You listen to me.
You know exactly who this is.

1189
01:27:27,788 --> 01:27:31,712
You came into my house,
you touched my child...

1190
01:27:32,679 --> 01:27:34,807
and you think you're crazy?

1191
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,399
I'll show you crazy.

1192
01:27:37,779 --> 01:27:39,111
Just try me, bitch!

1193
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:46,181
You're set. You ready for me
to show you how the system works?

1194
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:48,104
Definitely.

1195
01:27:51,575 --> 01:27:52,609
Simple.

1196
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:56,124
You just punch in your code,
now it's armed.

1197
01:27:56,342 --> 01:27:59,884
Case of an emergency,
this is the panic button.

1198
01:28:00,104 --> 01:28:02,898
You touch this,
the police are knocking at your door.

1199
01:28:03,114 --> 01:28:05,075
There's also one in your master.

1200
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:26,849
Okay, so you packed everything?

1201
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:28,177
What time you taking off?

1202
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:32,452
This afternoon after I pick Kyle up
from my sister's.

1203
01:29:32,662 --> 01:29:34,291
- Okay, well, drive safely.
- Okay.

1204
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:36,416
- I'll be there in the morning.
- All right.

1205
01:29:36,634 --> 01:29:38,547
- Set the alarm.
- You don't have to tell me.

1206
01:29:38,766 --> 01:29:40,430
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1207
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:43,572
Bye.

1208
01:29:51,643 --> 01:29:52,974
Derek Charles's office.

1209
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:54,355
Patrick.

1210
01:29:54,569 --> 01:29:57,696
Lisa? Oh, my God, it's been forever.

1211
01:29:57,914 --> 01:29:59,625
What, like 6 months?

1212
01:29:59,836 --> 01:30:02,761
I know. We've got a lot of gossip
to catch up on.

1213
01:30:02,972 --> 01:30:06,930
Well, I'm not supposed to talk to you.
I could get fired.

1214
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:09,363
Trust me, you're not getting fired.

1215
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:10,659
What do you mean?

1216
01:30:10,873 --> 01:30:12,585
Derek didn't tell you.

1217
01:30:13,758 --> 01:30:15,089
Tell me what?

1218
01:30:15,304 --> 01:30:17,432
He's leaving Sharon.
They're getting a divorce.

1219
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:20,440
- A divorce?
- Like that's a surprise.

1220
01:30:20,656 --> 01:30:23,498
Look, that's not gonna happen, Lisa.

1221
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:26,002
Patrick, come on.
I know what I'm talking about.

1222
01:30:26,216 --> 01:30:30,269
Then why are they driving to San
Diego for her parents' anniversary?

1223
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,026
Derek's not going.

1224
01:30:32,236 --> 01:30:34,448
Yeah, actually, he is.

1225
01:30:34,661 --> 01:30:37,918
Sharon's leaving this afternoon,
Derek's driving down in the morning.

1226
01:30:39,886 --> 01:30:41,931
Lisa? Did you hear me?

1227
01:30:42,144 --> 01:30:43,177
Patrick, I have to go.

1228
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:44,681
No, you just called.

1229
01:31:20,313 --> 01:31:21,310
My purse.

1230
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:31,962
Joe needs these by 5.

1231
01:32:32,176 --> 01:32:34,805
- Yeah. Sharon's on one.
- Okay.

1232
01:32:37,947 --> 01:32:40,573
- Hey.
- Hey, baby, I just left the house.

1233
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:43,417
- Okay, good. You set the alarm?
- The ala--

1234
01:32:43,632 --> 01:32:45,344
Oh, God, I forgot.

1235
01:32:45,555 --> 01:32:47,932
Don't worry. I'm gonna get out soon.
I'll do it.

1236
01:32:48,147 --> 01:32:51,940
No. I'm just down the hill. I'll swing
back around, and I'll call you after.

1237
01:32:52,161 --> 01:32:54,074
Hey. Call me back.

1238
01:34:58,079 --> 01:34:59,744
Did you not get my message?

1239
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:03,753
I'm so sorry. We didn't want you
to find out this way.

1240
01:35:05,353 --> 01:35:06,982
I knew it would come to this.

1241
01:35:07,193 --> 01:35:12,579
I know how hard it must be to have
someone fall out of love with you.

1242
01:35:12,796 --> 01:35:14,341
I know.

1243
01:35:16,976 --> 01:35:19,187
You are completely delusional.

1244
01:35:20,195 --> 01:35:22,953
I'm gonna have the cops
deal with your crazy ass.

1245
01:35:23,164 --> 01:35:25,790
- Wait, it doesn't--
- Don't touch me.

1246
01:35:26,717 --> 01:35:30,141
- We can talk.
- I told you, don't touch me!

1247
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:40,844
Crazy!

1248
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:42,556
Get off of me!

1249
01:36:08,231 --> 01:36:10,311
You have reached
the Charles Residence.

1250
01:36:10,905 --> 01:36:12,403
Sharon.

1251
01:36:12,619 --> 01:36:14,034
Are you there?

1252
01:36:18,347 --> 01:36:19,844
- Derek.
- Lisa?

1253
01:36:20,062 --> 01:36:22,689
What are you doing in my house?

1254
01:36:22,903 --> 01:36:24,401
Sharon.

1255
01:36:25,371 --> 01:36:26,999
Sharon?

1256
01:36:28,255 --> 01:36:30,502
Derek, I'm gonna call you back.

1257
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:41,043
I need to speak to Detective
Reese, right now, please.

1258
01:36:41,257 --> 01:36:43,301
Yeah. No, it's an emergency.

1259
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:45,718
Come here, bitch.

1260
01:36:47,276 --> 01:36:49,905
I'm gonna wipe the floor
with your little skinny ass.

1261
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:53,461
Oh, you want to hold on?
You screaming now, huh?

1262
01:37:01,156 --> 01:37:02,951
Come here!

1263
01:37:03,163 --> 01:37:06,170
Didn't I tell you not
to come to my house?

1264
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:07,963
Nobody touches my child.

1265
01:37:44,635 --> 01:37:46,798
Come on. Come here!

1266
01:40:04,517 --> 01:40:06,230
Come on, this what you want?

1267
01:40:06,441 --> 01:40:08,401
Come on.

1268
01:40:22,326 --> 01:40:23,705
Come a little closer.

1269
01:40:25,754 --> 01:40:27,003
You almost got it, come on.

1270
01:40:27,678 --> 01:40:29,424
Come on.

1271
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:39,873
You want some of me?
You almost got me.

1272
01:40:44,901 --> 01:40:46,185
Come on, bitch.

1273
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:19,139
Take my hand.

1274
01:41:19,349 --> 01:41:21,061
Come on, take my hand.

1275
01:41:23,196 --> 01:41:24,361
I got you.

1276
01:41:31,055 --> 01:41:32,720
Come on, come on.

1277
01:41:36,657 --> 01:41:38,203
Crazy bitch.

1278
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:57,014
Get off of me.

1279
01:42:32,008 --> 01:42:33,554
Oh, God.

1280
01:43:02,108 --> 01:43:03,987
Oh, God.

Sharon? You all right?

1283
01:43:56,457 --> 01:43:57,574
What happened here?

1284
01:43:57,794 --> 01:43:59,922
I think you know what happened.

1285
01:44:01,975 --> 01:44:03,806
Stay here.

1286
01:44:05,069 --> 01:44:07,696
- Oh, baby.
- You okay?

1287
01:44:09,249 --> 01:44:12,008
- It's over.
- It's over.
