00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:22,285
Ten centuries ago,
before the Age of Obedience,

2
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:26,063
free dogs roamed at liberty,
marking their territory.

3
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:28,205
Seeking to extend
its dominion,

4
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:31,341
<i>the cat-loving
Kobayashi Dynasty declared war</i>

5
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:32,717
<i>and descended in force</i>

6
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,989
<i>upon the unwary
four-legged beasts.</i>

7
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:38,158
<i>On the eve
of total canine annihilation,</i>

8
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,560
<i>a child warrior
sympathetic to the plight</i>

9
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,349
<i>of the besieged underdog dogs</i>

10
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:43,981
<i>betrayed his species,</i>

11
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:46,638
<i>beheaded the head of the head
of the Kobayashi clan</i>

12
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:47,887
and pledged his sword

13
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,191
with the following
battle-cry haiku.

14
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,326
I turn my back

15
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:54,892
On man-kind!

16
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:56,686
Frost on window-pane.

17
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:57,999
He would later be known

18
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,389
as the Boy Samurai
of Legend, RIP.

19
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:03,438
At the end
of the bloody dog wars,

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,087
the vanquished mongrels
became powerless house-pets:

21
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:11,149
<i>tamed, mastered, scorned.</i>

22
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:13,808
<i>But they survived
and multiplied.</i>

23
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:18,064
<i>The Kobayashis, however,</i>

24
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,208
<i>never forgave
their conquered foe.</i>

25
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,502
<i>The Japanese archipelago,</i>

26
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,329
<i>20 years in the future.</i>

27
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:09,678
<i>Canine Saturation</i>

28
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,821
<i>has reached
epidemic proportions.</i>

29
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:13,166
<i>An outbreak of Snout-fever</i>

30
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:14,861
<i>rips through
the City of Megasaki.</i>

31
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,966
<i>Blizzards of infected fleas,
worms, ticks and lice</i>

32
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,565
<i>menace the citizenship.</i>

33
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:22,415
<i>Dog-Flu threatens to cross
the species threshold</i>

34
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,141
<i>and enter
the human disease-pool.</i>

35
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,332
<i>In a special midnight-session</i>

36
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,679
<i>at the Municipal Dome,</i>

37
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,309
<i>Mayor Kobayashi
of Uni Prefecture</i>

38
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,815
<i>issues emergency orders</i>

39
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,796
<i>calling for
a hasty quarantine:</i>

40
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,845
<i>the expulsion and containment
of all breeds,</i>

41
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:38,735
<i>both stray and domesticated.</i>

42
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,110
<i>By official decree,</i>

43
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,192
<i>Trash Island
becomes an exile colony.</i>

44
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:43,441
BANISH ALL DOGS.

45
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:46,629
Save Megasaki City of Uni Prefecture!

46
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,376
<i>The Isle of Dogs.</i>

47
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,031
Respect-o.

48
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,711
<i>It's not fair to the dogs.</i>

49
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:21,005
<i>The path favored
by Mayor Kobayashi</i>

50
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,247
<i>is cruel and unscientific.</i>

51
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:24,493
<i>For a thousand years,</i>

52
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:25,997
<i>these resilient animals
have loved,</i>

53
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:27,439
<i>served and protected us.</i>

54
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:29,325
<i>Now, in their time
of greatest need,</i>

55
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:30,830
<i>we forsake them again?</i>

56
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,005
<i>A tidal-wave
of Anti-Dog hysteria</i>

57
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:35,215
<i>has crippled
our moral judgment.</i>

58
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:37,454
<i>Give me six months,
and I will deliver a serum.</i>

59
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:39,181
<i>I'm this close, dammit.</i>

60
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:42,830
<i>Dog-Flu will be eradicated.
Snout-fever will be defeated.</i>

61
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,140
<i>Canine Saturation
will be returned</i>

62
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,389
<i>to sustainable levels</i>

63
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,120
<i>and without mass-neutering!</i>

64
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:57,584
Whatever happened
to man's best friend?

65
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:10,543
No, no, no!

66
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,014
The crowd is calling
for the immediate ratification

67
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:13,933
and approval
of the mayor's proposal.

68
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,751
<i>As a
gesture of public solidarity,</i>

69
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:22,254
<i>Mayor Kobayashi

70
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,983
<i>his Assistant Hatchet-Man,

00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,149

73
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:28,527
<i>Spots Kobayashi,</i>

<i>into the possession

75
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,080
<i>for Canine Desaturation.</i>

76
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,478
<i>Spots will be the first dog</i>

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,400
<i>to be officially deported
from the city.</i>

78
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,953
<i>Six months later.</i>

79
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:40,493
<i>Nomadic packs
of once-domesticated</i>

80
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:41,997
<i>house-pets, sick and hungry,</i>

81
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,173
<i>rove the garbage canyons
and filthy ravines,</i>

82
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:45,934
<i>scrounging for scraps.</i>

83
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:47,790
<i>One hundred per cent
test positive</i>

84
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,517
<i>for the Dog-Flu germ.</i>

85
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,580
<i>Symptoms:
weight-loss, dizziness,</i>

86
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:56,237
<i>narcolepsy, insomnia,</i>

87
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,479
<i>and extreme/aggressive
behavior.</i>

88
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:04,973
<i>Three-quarters display signs
of early-onset Snout-fever:</i>

89
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,598
<i>high-temperature,
low blood-pressure,</i>

90
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,940
<i>acute moodiness</i>

91
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:11,725
<i>and spasmodic
nasal expiration.</i>

92
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:15,728
<i>The exiled dog-population
grows weaker, sadder, angrier.</i>

93
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,399
<i>Desperate.</i>

94
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,764
Hey, wait a second.

95
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,494
Before we attack each other
and tear ourselves to shreds

96
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,125
like a pack of maniacs,

97
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,525
let's just open the sack first
and see what's actually in it.

98
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:07,404
It might not even
be worth the trouble.

99
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,549
What do you say?
I'm not sure.

100
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:10,989
Maybe.

101
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:12,496
Alright.

102
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,613
A rancid apple core;
two worm-eaten banana peels;

103
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:18,958
a moldy rice cake;
a dried-up pickle;

104
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,749
tin of sardine bones;
a pile of broken egg-shells;

105
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:21,804
an old, smushed-up,
rotten gizzard

106
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,149
with maggots all over it...

107
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:24,976
Okay, it's worth it.

108
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,313
Get out of here
and don't come back.

109
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:42,736
Sheesh, Igor. I think
he chewed your ear off.

110
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:45,169
Hmm... Hmm.

111
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:17,229
I don't think I can stomach
any more of this garbage.

112
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:19,374
Same here.
Words out of my mouth.

113
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:21,324
I used to sleep
on a lamb's-wool bean-bag

114
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,606
next to
an electric space-heater.

115
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:25,100
That's my territory.
I'm an indoor dog.

116
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,533
I starred in 22 consecutive
Doggy-Chop commercials.

117
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:29,964
Look at me now.
I couldn't land an audition.

118
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,502
I was the lead mascot

119
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:33,740
for an undefeated high-school
baseball team.

120
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:35,950
I lost all my spirit.
I'm depressing.

121
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:37,805
I only ask
for what I've always had:

122
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:39,757
a balanced diet,
regular grooming,

123
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,316
and a general physical
once a year.

124
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:44,559
I think I might give up.

125
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:48,559
What, right now?
Right now.

126
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,366
There's no future
on Trash Island.

127
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:54,350
You heard the rumor,
right? About Buster.

128
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:55,628
Not sure.
Can you remind me?

129
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,718
Who's Buster?

130
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,030
Uh, my brother
from another litter.

131
00:11:58,032 --> 00:12:00,428
What happened to him?
Suicided.

132
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,054
Hanged himself
by his own leash.

133
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,783
- Hmm.
- Oh, boy.

134
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,205
I want my master.

135
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:11,633
Ah...

136
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:15,151
You make me sick.

137
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:21,518
I've seen cats
with more balls than you dogs.

138
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,505
Stop licking your wounds!

139
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,534
You hungry?
Kill something and eat it.

140
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:29,454
You sick? Take a long nap.

141
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,278
You cold?
Dig a hole in the ground,

142
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,652
crawl into it,
and bury yourself.

143
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,989
But nobody's giving up
around here,

144
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:36,878
and don't you forget it, ever.

145
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,285
You're Rex!

146
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:39,311
You're King!

147
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:40,430
You're Duke!

148
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:41,517
You're Boss!

149
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,118
I'm Chief.

150
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,638
We're a pack of scary,
indestructible Alpha Dogs.

151
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,820
You're talking like a bunch
of house-broken... pets.

152
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:55,632
You don't understand.
Uh, how could you? You're a...

153
00:12:57,648 --> 00:13:01,840
Go ahead, say it.
I'm a stray, yeah.

154
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:32,013
How does she keep
her fur so clean?

155
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:34,700
There's no shampoo
on Trash Island.

156
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:37,485
You heard the rumor, right?
About her and Felix.

157
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:38,701
What'd they say?
Felix? No.

158
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:40,877
What happened to them?
They mated.

159
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,637
Ooh.

160
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,302
Who is Felix again?

161
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:46,700
All the ones I like:
they're never in heat.

162
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:50,062
Hey, now, that puddle-jumper's
flying crooked.

163
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:51,310
- Oh, you're right.
- Ease up.

164
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,199
Pull up.
He's gonna lose a wing.

165
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:09,680
Wow.

166
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:36,816
<i>Part One:
The Little Pilot."</i>

167
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,236
Small guy.
Not much meat on him.

168
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:41,357
Yeah, is he dead?

169
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,764
He looks dead.
I have a question.

170
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,719
Are we eating him,
or is this a rescue?

171
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,933
We don't know yet.

172
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:47,532
Nobody's eating
the little pilot.

173
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:49,292
Not even the dead body of him.
Dogs don't eat masters.

174
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:51,628
You're not our leader.
We all are. Let's take a vote.

175
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,285
All in favor of not eating
the little pilot, say "Aye".

176
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:55,981
- Aye.
- Nay.

177
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:07,821
First-things-first:

178
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,164
let's open his helmet

179
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,286
so he can breathe
some air if he's alive,

180
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:11,469
then see if we can pull that

181
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:12,974
hunk of
broken propeller-clutch

182
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:14,638
out of the side of his head
if it doesn't kill him.

183
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,302
- Does that sound right?
- Yeah, that's right.

184
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:17,584
Mmm-hmm.

185
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:45,231
Spots-u! Spots-u! Spots-u!

186
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,044
We get the idea.

187
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:49,965
You're looking
for your lost dog, Spots.

188
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,335
- Does anybody know him?
- Hmm. No.

189
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:53,392
Uh-uh.

190
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:00,624
Wow.

191
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:33,389
In response to questions

192
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:34,700
regarding the purported
disappearance

193
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,982
of his ward Atari,

194
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:38,158
Mayor Kobayashi offers
no comment

195
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,822
<i>and urges reporters to respect</i>

196
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,485
<i>the privacy of
the mayoral-household.</i>

197
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:44,270
<i>Atari, aged 12, was last seen
early yesterday morning</i>

198
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,541
<i>rolling a small airplane
onto a runway</i>

199
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,588
<i>at Megasaki Executive Airport.</i>

200
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:53,099
<i>24 hours later.</i>

201
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:15,599
I bite.

202
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:18,955
I beg your pardon.
Ignore that dog.

203
00:17:18,957 --> 00:17:20,013
He's got Snout-fever.

204
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:22,128
Just please follow us.

205
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,835
Now, I never met him,
but I asked around.

206
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:31,147
I understand
he made a lot of friends.

207
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,908
He had a very good-natured
temperament, I'm told.

208
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,189
Of course,
you would know best.

209
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,813
It's just a bit further
up here on the left.

210
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:38,381
Anyway, as I say,
he seemed to have been

211
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:39,787
an extremely pleasant animal.

212
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:42,829
Unfortunately, nobody could
figure out

213
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,399
how to open his dog-cage.

214
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:53,069
<i>Three years earlier.</i>

215
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,573
<i>The sole survivor
of last week's</i>

216
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,885
<i>colossal
bullet-train disaster,</i>

217
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:57,548
<i>a young boy named Atari,</i>

218
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,021
<i>awoke from a deep-coma
early this morning</i>

219
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:01,260
<i>to learn
of his parents' tragic deaths</i>

220
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:02,668
<i>and also the intention</i>

221
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,365
<i>of his distant-uncle,
Mayor Kobayashi,</i>

222
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:05,708
<i>to personally adopt him</i>

223
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,109
<i>as ward
to the mayoral-household.</i>

224
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:09,677
<i>Upon his release
from Megasaki General,</i>

225
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,045
<i>Atari who suffered the loss
of his right kidney</i>

226
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,189
<i>and numerous broken bones
in the crash</i>

227
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,597

00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,294
<i>within the confines

229
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,940
<i>where he will be educated
in solitude by private tutors.</i>

230
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:22,667
<i>Atari has also been assigned
a security-detail</i>

231
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,076
<i>for his own protection</i>

232
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:25,964
<i>in the form of a highly
trained bodyguard-dog</i>

233
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:28,877
<i>named Spots Kobayashi.</i>

234
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,646
Um, you're my new master.

235
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:48,014
My name is Spots.
I'm at your service.

236
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:50,220
I'll be protecting
your welfare and safety

237
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:51,693
on an ongoing-basis.

238
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,671
In other words: I'm your dog.

239
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:16,751
Bodyguard-dog! Not pet!

240
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,221
I can hear you,
Master Atari.

241
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:52,685
I can hear you.

242
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:55,024
I can hear you.
I can hear you.

243
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,329
Oh, no.

244
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:12,399
You need a key.

245
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,775
Where'd you get that?
What? I always had this.

246
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:05,357
I stole it
off the dead skeleton.

247
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,567
Oh, no.

248
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,455
Hey! The wrong dog died!

249
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:16,880
The wrong dog died!

250
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:35,536
The wrong...
The wrong dog died.

251
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:39,854
He's not Spots.

252
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:46,288
Who is that?

253
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:58,413
I can't smell him.

254
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,805
This is child abuse.

255
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:03,022
Chief, you fight
the robot-dog.

256
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,396
Wait. What?

257
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:05,645
King, Duke, Boss? You attack
the three dog-catchers.

258
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:06,987
On it.
I'll guard the little pilot.

259
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:08,269
On my command. Ready?

260
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:09,323
Wait a second!

261
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:10,636
I am not gonna fight
this robot!

262
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:12,622
I'm against the little pilot,
remember?

263
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:13,868
I don't even believe
in masters.

264
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,117
You're the best in a scrap.

265
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,587
We all know that.
You like to fight.

266
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:17,644
Well, let's take a vote.

267
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:18,859
All in favor of Chief

268
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:19,884
fighting the robot-dog,
say "Aye".

269
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,132
- Aye.
- Nay.

270
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:22,094
Sic 'em.

271
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:50,604
<i>My ward, Atari,</i>

272
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,044
<i>has been kidnapped
against his will</i>

273
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:55,627
<i>by a pack of disobedient,
contagious, infected animals.</i>

274
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:57,900
<i>He will be rescued promptly,
returned to safety,</i>

275
00:27:57,902 --> 00:28:00,939
<i>and grounded for the duration
of his childhood years.</i>

276
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:02,188
<i>His five dog-abductors</i>

277
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,500
<i>have been identified
through the use</i>

278
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:06,893
<i>of advanced Tooth-and-Tail
Recognition Software:</i>

279
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,651
<i>They will, of course,
be captured</i>

280
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,222
<i>and violently destroyed.</i>

281
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,813
Chief ought to
get a check-up, too.

282
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:30,735
He looks worse than anybody.

283
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,307
I wish somebody
spoke his language.

284
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:53,612
Sit-o!

285
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:55,695
Well, I understood that.
Sit down.

286
00:28:57,808 --> 00:28:59,660
Sit-o!

287
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:01,487
Chief! Sit!

288
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,751
I don't sit.

289
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,854
You're disobedient! Sit!

290
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:10,735
No.

291
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:41,455
I wouldn't drink that,
if I were you.

292
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:45,420
It's full of toxic chemicals.

293
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:47,180
How do you know?

294
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:49,037
Because my sister-in-law
drank it,

295
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,478
and her tongue turned black.

296
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:53,708
Oh.

297
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,982
You're Felix's mate.

298
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:58,667
I beg your pardon?

299
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:00,813
I mean, I think you mated

300
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:02,639
with Felix,
if I heard it right?

301
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:05,965
That's none of your business.

302
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:08,045
No, no, I don't suggest

303
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:09,293
whether it actually
happened or not.

304
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,691
I'm just saying
that I recognize you

305
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:14,062
from when I heard that rumor.

306
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:18,540
I think I'm going
to say good-night.

307
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,012
Wait, wait, wait. No.

308
00:30:20,014 --> 00:30:22,286
Wait. Start over.
Who cares about Felix?

309
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,806
I'm Chief.
That's my name.

310
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:29,196
I see.

311
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:32,334
I'm introducing myself.
Who are you?

312
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:35,532
I thought you knew
all about me.

313
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:37,997
No, I don't know anything.

314
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:39,214
I should've kept
my mouth shut.

315
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:40,075
It's all hearsay.

316
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:43,055
Anyway, you're Nutmeg.

317
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:46,669
So you do know me, after all.

318
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,710
After all? Yes.

319
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,134
You a show-dog, Nutmeg?

320
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:55,372
I was bred as a show-dog.

321
00:30:55,374 --> 00:30:57,068
I was groomed
for that purpose.

322
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,252
It wasn't my choice.

323
00:30:58,254 --> 00:31:00,044
I don't consider it
my identity.

324
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:02,796
Anyway, look around.

325
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,007
What difference
does it make now?

326
00:31:05,648 --> 00:31:07,852
So that's a yes.

327
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:11,503
So that's a:
yes, I used to be.

328
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:14,544
May I join you?

329
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:22,698
You've been attacked.

330
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,579
Hmm. What else is new?
You should see the other dog.

331
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,892
Actually,

332
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:28,203
I think he was made
of stainless-steel.

333
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:29,932
I couldn't get my teeth
into him.

334
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:31,918
Who is the little pilot?

335
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,870
What'd he do?
Why are they after him?

336
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:37,358
Nobody knows.

337
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,940
You're a stray, aren't you?

338
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:47,084
Yes, I'm a stray.

339
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:50,320
But aren't we all?
In the last analysis, I mean?

340
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:54,540
Were you trained?
For competition.

341
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,043
I was a show-dog.

342
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:59,020
You know a few tricks, then.
A few.

343
00:31:59,022 --> 00:32:00,844
Can I see one?

344
00:32:00,846 --> 00:32:03,149
Maybe if I get to
know you better.

345
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:05,995
Fair enough.

346
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:07,629
It's not true, by the way.

347
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:09,582
About me and Felix.
For the record.

348
00:32:10,927 --> 00:32:13,360
I wouldn't bring puppies
into this world.

349
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,781
I don't believe in masters.
I never did.

350
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:18,027
It's against my principles.

351
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:20,747
But this is no place
for a dog like you.

352
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:24,366
You belong somewhere.
You've got papers.

353
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:26,764
Oh, I'm full-grown,
sweetheart.

354
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:28,879
You don't have to worry
about me.

355
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,183
Good-night.

356
00:32:34,127 --> 00:32:35,566
I hope I'll see you again.

357
00:32:39,086 --> 00:32:41,262
- Here's one.
- One what?

358
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,724
I'm supposed to be spinning
a nine-pound bowling-ball

359
00:32:47,726 --> 00:32:48,875
over my head at this point,

360
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:50,958
but you just have to
imagine that part.

361
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,836
Oh.

362
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,460
I can picture it.

363
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:59,501
Will you help him?
The little pilot?

364
00:33:00,494 --> 00:33:01,930
Why should I?

365
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:04,460
Because he's
a 12-year-old boy.

366
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:06,575
Dogs love those.

367
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:11,178
<i>Spots, whoever he is,</i>

368
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,683
<i>might be alive,
and he might be dead,</i>

369
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:14,285
<i>but one thing's for sure:</i>

370
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:15,693
he's nowhere around here.

371
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:17,613
He's not in the dog-community.

372
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:19,852
There's probably another
500 Japanese hectares

373
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:21,130
of unmapped waste-land

374
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,052
on Trash Island at least.

375
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:24,523
Where do we start?

376
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:26,859
Also,
the mental health question:

377
00:33:26,861 --> 00:33:28,267
maybe it's because of that

378
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:29,484
propeller-clutch stuck
in the side of his head

379
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:30,924
I can't say, I'm not a doctor,

380
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,093
but I think the little pilot's
got a screw loose.

381
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:35,660
Those are the cons.

382
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:37,676
You heard the rumor, right?
About the little pilot.

383
00:33:37,678 --> 00:33:39,178
Which rumor?
What is that?

384
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,678
Kobayashi is
his distant uncle.

385
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,085
He's the mayor's ward.

386
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,228
- What?
- Whoa.

387
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,180
Be that as it may,
let's look at the pros.

388
00:33:47,182 --> 00:33:48,397
That boy flew here, all alone,

389
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,834
and crash-landed
onto this island

390
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:51,915
for one reason;
one reason only:

391
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,644
to find his dog.

392
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:55,276
To the best of my knowledge,
no other master,

393
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:56,972
not one single human master,

394
00:33:56,974 --> 00:33:58,860
has made any effort
to do that.

395
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:01,611
They've forgotten
all about us.

396
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:04,779
I propose we start tomorrow,
first-light.

397
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:06,475
<i>We'll cross
the Middle Fingers.</i>

398
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,427
<i>We'll find the tugboat
on the Dune.</i>

399
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,964
<i>We'll go see Jupiter
and Oracle.</i>

400
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:11,406
<i>They'll know what to do.</i>

401
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:14,764
Let's take a vote.
All in favor say "Aye".

402
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:16,204
- Aye.
- Nay.

403
00:34:16,206 --> 00:34:17,132
Who's the nay-sayer?

404
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:19,468
- Him.
- Me.

405
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:24,491
That kid is gonna get us all
put to sleep. Euthanized.

406
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,607
We won't find the dog,

407
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,583
but we will die trying.

408
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:34,254
Not a bad way to go.
You're out-voted, anyway.

Thank you, Editor-Hiroshi.

418
00:35:13,135 --> 00:35:14,797
You all know me.
I speak my mind,

419
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:16,427
and sometimes
that ruffles some feathers.

420
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:18,251
Please, forgive my bluntness.

421
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:20,588
Mayor Kobayashi is a crook,
and I hate him.

422
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,410
Right now,
he faces a divided congress

423
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,588
during a hotly-contested
re-election year.

424
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,468
Dogs are dying
on a miserable island.

425
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,965
Gullible masters
have been brainwashed.

426
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:32,525
The Science-Party Candidate
is being held against his will

427
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:35,691
with no recourse
to legal counsel.

428
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:38,379
Somebody is up to something.

429
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:44,493
You have
a conspiracy theory?

430
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:48,302
I have a hunch.

431
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,562
I don't print hunch.

432
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,086
Huh?

433
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,803
I'll spell it out.

434
00:35:57,806 --> 00:35:59,916
I believe
Municipal Dome propaganda

435
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:02,923
has deliberately stoked
irrational, Anti-Dog fear

436
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:05,644
and suppressed a medically
proven Dog-Flu treatment

437
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:07,626
in order to promote
a secret campaign

438
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:11,499
to turn the country against
its innocent house-pets.

439
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,549
There. I said it.

440
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:18,094
Can you prove it?

441
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:27,723
I don't know.

442
00:36:27,725 --> 00:36:29,839
To tell you the truth:
I don't know.

00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:57,804
Okay, I got a question.
What's your favorite food?

457
00:37:57,805 --> 00:37:59,628
A double-portion
of Doggy-Chop from the can

458
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,356
mixed into a bowl
of broken Puppy-Snaps

459
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:02,762
with a vitamin
crushed up into it.

460
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:04,779
King's the spokes-dog
for that.

461
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,188
He's the Doggy-Chop dog.

462
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,307
Mmm. Used to be.

463
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,747
Was that
your daily meal?

464
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:10,187
Not always. My master
was a school-teacher.

465
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,043
We weren't rich,
you know. You?

466
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:14,187
A center-cut Kobe
rib-eye, seared,

467
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:15,658
on the bone,
with salt and pepper.

468
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,909
Wow.

469
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:18,668
It was my birthday
supper. Every year.

470
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,036
Mine's hot-sausage,
yakitori-style.

471
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:24,043
The snack vendor always
saved me one on game-days.

472
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:26,187
- Hmm. Duke?
- Ah, green-tea ice cream.

473
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:27,532
My master had a sweet-tooth.

474
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:29,099
I probably inherited it
from her.

475
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:32,300
You heard the rumor, right?
About Doggy-Chop.

476
00:38:32,302 --> 00:38:33,963
Remind us again.
What rumor?

477
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:36,716
Oh, they folded.
Oh, no.

478
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,308
Doggy... Doggy-Chop folded?

479
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,572
How about you, Chief?
What was your favorite food?

480
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:44,876
Me? Oh, I don't care.

481
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:47,340
Garbage, trash,
scraps of rubbish.

482
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:49,900
- I'm used to left-overs.
- Hmm.

483
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:50,924
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:53,354
Of course,
I wasn't always a stray.

485
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:55,019
Wait. What'd you say?

486
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:57,196
I said I wasn't always
a stray.

487
00:38:57,198 --> 00:38:59,310
- Really? Since when?
- Tell us about that.

488
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:09,835
I've been hunted by
dog-catchers all my life.

489
00:39:09,837 --> 00:39:11,147
I'm not easy to trap.

490
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,548
I've only got three captures
on my record

491
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,469
where I actually got sent
to the pound, I mean,

492
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,378
and the first two times,
I escaped within 24 hours,

493
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,812
but the third time...

494
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:22,284
I got adopted before I could

495
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:24,555
finish digging
the break-out-tunnel.

496
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:25,772
It was a big family.

497
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:27,949
Five kids.
Two other dogs, already.

498
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,739
They stuck me
in the back of a station-wagon

499
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:32,043
and drove me out
to the middle of the sticks.

500
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:35,660
Grass, trees, swimming pool.
Cartoons on TV.

501
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:38,603
Anyway, one morning
a week later,

502
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:40,429
the youngest boy,
his name was Toshiro,

503
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:44,076
woke me up at 6:15,
bright-eyed, wide-awake,

504
00:39:44,078 --> 00:39:48,300
and he tried to pet me.

505
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:52,140
He didn't mean anything by it.
He was just being friendly.

506
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:59,020
Apparently, I bit him so hard,
I nearly chewed his hand off.

507
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,388
Blood all over
the kitchen floor.

508
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,117
They rushed him
to the emergency room

509
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:04,363
and I got pad-locked out

510
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:06,059
in the tool-shed
with the lights out.

511
00:40:06,061 --> 00:40:08,330
It gave me some time to think.

512
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:11,820
What happened?
Why did I do that?

513
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:14,923
To this day, I have no idea.

514
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:17,326
I guess he scared me.

515
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:21,455
I bite.

516
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,267
That night, an old woman,

517
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:25,804
she must've been
the grandmother

518
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:28,492
brought me out a bowl of some
homemade hibachi-chili.

519
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:29,579
I like to think she cooked it

520
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:31,180
for me,
personally -but who knows?

521
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:33,036
Maybe it was just
more left-overs. But...

522
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,213
You've got a tick.

523
00:40:37,964 --> 00:40:40,972
Anyway, that's my favorite
food I ever ate.

524
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:43,566
The old woman made
a great bowl of chili.

525
00:40:44,558 --> 00:40:46,250
What happened after that?

526
00:40:46,252 --> 00:40:47,628
I dug my way out by morning,

527
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,196
jumped on the back
of a dump-truck,

528
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,307
and hitched back to Megasaki.

529
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:54,218
I was always a street-dog,
let's face it.

530
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:07,214
Somebody's stalking us.

531
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:25,706
<i>As you know, we all hate dogs.</i>

532
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:27,115
<i>Chairman Fujimoto-san,</i>

533
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,684
<i>President of
Kobayashi Pharmaceutical.</i>

534
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,027
<i>You secretly introduced</i>

535
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,499
<i>mega-quantities
of infected fleas</i>

536
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:32,844
<i>and contagious tick-larvae</i>

537
00:41:32,846 --> 00:41:34,475
<i>into a metropolitan
city center,</i>

538
00:41:34,478 --> 00:41:37,547
<i>creating an unprecedented
animal-disease out-break.</i>

539
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:38,603
<i>Thank you.</i>

540
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:40,172
<i>General Yamatachi-san,</i>

541
00:41:40,174 --> 00:41:42,092
<i>Commander of the Megasaki
Municipal Task force.</i>

542
00:41:42,094 --> 00:41:45,867
<i>You oversaw the deportation
of over 750,000 caged-animals</i>

543
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:49,068
<i>to a nearly uninhabitable
off-shore refuse-center.</i>

544
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,189
<i>Good work.</i>

545
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,755
<i>Supervisor Kitano-san,</i>

546
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:53,388
<i>Director
of Kobayashi Robotics.</i>

547
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,339
<i>You developed the most
promising artificial life-form</i>

548
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,165
<i>in the history
of corporate-technology-</i>

549
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:59,437
<i>and a powerful new weapon,
to boot.</i>

550
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:00,652
<i>Well done.</i>

551
00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:01,965
<i>Yakuza Nakamura-san,</i>

552
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:03,531
<i>Head of
the Clenched-Fist Gang.</i>

553
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:05,355
<i>You eliminated
all Pro-Dog opposition</i>

554
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,827
<i>through the use of bribery,</i>

555
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:09,323
<i>extortion, intimidation,
and violent force.</i>

556
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:12,588
<i>My compliments.</i>

557
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,820
<i>Brains have been washed.
Wheels have been greased.</i>

558
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:17,195
<i>Fear has been mongered.</i>

559
00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:18,637
<i>Now we prepare
for the final stage</i>

560
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:20,139
<i>of our conspiracy-theory:</i>

561
00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:21,260
<i>the permanent end</i>

562
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:23,565
<i>to the Canine
Saturation-crisis.</i>

563
00:42:32,749 --> 00:42:35,787
<i>We believe we've
recovered a viable DNA sample</i>

564
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:39,114
<i>from this article
of damaged aviation equipment.</i>

565
00:42:39,116 --> 00:42:40,395
<i>We're going to check it
right now</i>

566
00:42:40,397 --> 00:42:42,191
<i>if you care to observe.</i>

567
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,772
We call upon
dog-lovers everywhere

568
00:43:05,774 --> 00:43:07,979
to harken
to this transmission:

569
00:43:09,774 --> 00:43:11,211
May-day! May-day!

570
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,907
Unscheduled Junior Turbo-Prop

571
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,922
in severe distress
over Sapporo River.

572
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,522
Engine-failure, and-

573
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:18,027
-detachment of left wing.

574
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,971
Will attempt emergency-landing
on Trash Island coast.

575
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,730
Please, make note
of the following:

576
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:24,587
<i>to my security-detail /
bodyguard-dog,</i>

577
00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:26,474
<i>Spots Kobayashi,
if still living,</i>

578
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:29,515
<i>I leave
all my worldly possessions.</i>

579
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:31,914
<i>If Spots has preceded me
into the next life,</i>

580
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,547
<i>I ask that everything,</i>

581
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:35,979
<i>including my own bones
and Spots' carcass,</i>

582
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:38,730
<i>be burned
in a crematory furnace,</i>

583
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:41,130
<i>with our ashes scattered
to the four-winds.</i>

584
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:44,362
<i>It will not amount to much
pollution in this sad land.</i>

585
00:43:44,364 --> 00:43:47,980
<i>If I survive,
ignore this message.</i>

586
00:43:47,982 --> 00:43:50,860
<i>I've gone to find my dog.</i>

587
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:54,221
Young masters
of Megasaki: unite!

588
00:44:04,365 --> 00:44:05,932
Turpentine brandy.

589
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:09,580
It cools the head
and warms the dog-bones.

590
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:13,741
It may snow tonight.

591
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:16,747
Really? Thank you
very much. Wow.

592
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:19,148
To whom it may concern.

593
00:44:19,149 --> 00:44:22,955
- She sees the future.
- No.

594
00:44:22,957 --> 00:44:24,748
She understands T.V.

595
00:44:29,357 --> 00:44:32,525
You seek a dog named Spots.

596
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:39,181
- Dog-Zero.
- Dog-Zero.

597
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,819
As you know, most of
the animals on this island

598
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:45,420
come from human homes

599
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:47,148
with domesticated
back-grounds.

600
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,826
However, a small population
of savage, aboriginal dogs

601
00:44:50,828 --> 00:44:52,075
have been scavenging

602
00:44:52,077 --> 00:44:53,290
the Metropolitan
Dumping-Grounds

603
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:54,732
for nearly a decade.

604
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,451
The graffiti on this wall
depicts the story.

605
00:44:57,454 --> 00:44:59,947
They were born into captivity
on the ends of the fringes

606
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:01,610
of the most distant reaches
of the island.

607
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:04,715
They endured
great suffering and cruelty

608
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:06,986
at the hands
of their former masters.

609
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:10,059
Finally, in the wake of
an Act of God, they escaped-

610
00:45:10,061 --> 00:45:12,747
to a harsh
and desperate freedom.

611
00:45:12,749 --> 00:45:15,467
<i>Some say they died away
over the subsequent years,</i>

612
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:16,972
<i>starving and forgotten.</i>

613
00:45:16,974 --> 00:45:18,699
<i>Some say they swam
to the mainland,</i>

614
00:45:18,701 --> 00:45:22,410
<i>but this seems unlikely.
Too far to dog-paddle.</i>

615
00:45:22,413 --> 00:45:24,236
<i>Some say
they're still with us,</i>

616
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,076
<i>in the Far-away Cuticles,
beyond the Middle Fingers.</i>

617
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,988
We know the animal you seek.

618
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,451
<i>He has appeared
in Oracle's visions.</i>

619
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,933
A prophecy suggests itself:

620
00:45:39,468 --> 00:45:42,284
Spots, if he's alive,
may very well be living,

621
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:44,842
even at this moment,
as a captive prisoner

622
00:45:44,844 --> 00:45:48,591
abducted into the company
of these wild, savage dogs.

623
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,119
Oracle, what do you think?

624
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:55,054
What?

625
00:45:56,717 --> 00:46:00,330
Continue your journey.
Have faith in your cause.

626
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:02,764
Luck and good fortune
be unto you.

627
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:09,259
You heard the rumor, right?
About these aboriginal dogs.

628
00:46:09,261 --> 00:46:11,691
- Remind me again.
- What's the rumor?

629
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:13,514
Uh, they're cannibals.

630
00:46:13,516 --> 00:46:16,907
So you're telling me they're
going to want to eat us?

631
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:19,022
Well, they're cannibals.

632
00:48:51,373 --> 00:48:53,099
We're approaching
the end of Old Trash Island.

633
00:48:53,101 --> 00:48:56,170
To the west: the Sapporo River
and Megasaki City.

634
00:48:56,172 --> 00:48:57,804
To the east: the open-sea.

635
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:59,306
To the north: a long, rickety

636
00:48:59,308 --> 00:49:01,004
cause-way
over a noxious sludge-marsh

637
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:02,764
leading to
a radio-active land-fill

638
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:04,332
polluted by toxic
chemical-garbage.

639
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:05,834
- That's our destination.
- Great.

640
00:49:05,836 --> 00:49:07,211
Got it.
Get ready to jump.

641
00:49:07,212 --> 00:49:08,811
Atari, I'm going to drag you
overboard with my teeth,

642
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:09,995
since you can't understand
the plan.

643
00:49:09,998 --> 00:49:11,562
After that,
we're back on foot.

644
00:49:11,564 --> 00:49:12,875
The next stage...

645
00:49:12,878 --> 00:49:13,834
Where'd they...

646
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:15,210
Where'd they go?

647
00:49:15,212 --> 00:49:16,233
What are they doing
over there?

648
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:17,516
How did this happen?

649
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:19,307
What's going on
with this contraption?

650
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:21,258
If we get separated,
which we are:

651
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,107
rendez-vous at the cause-way!

652
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:26,731
You're not our leader!
What?

653
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:28,842
You're not our leader!
We all are!

654
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:30,538
Let's take a vote!

655
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,898
All in favor of my plan,

656
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,915
which is to rendez-vous
at the cause-way...

657
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:13,198
Let's go.

658
00:50:22,668 --> 00:50:24,650
No, you can't ride
the Pagoda-Slide.

659
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:27,469
You're below the safety-limit,
anyway. Let's go.

660
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,651
We made an emergency plan,

661
00:50:32,653 --> 00:50:34,731
even if we didn't get to vote
and agree to it yet:

662
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:37,130
rendez-vous at the cause-way
to the Far-away Cuticles,

663
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:38,282
and go find your dog.

664
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:40,042
Maybe everybody else
just got crushed,

665
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:41,706
compacted, and incinerated-

666
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,821
but we're going to be there.
Let's go.

667
00:50:50,861 --> 00:50:52,332
Don't.

668
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,053
Repeat:

669
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,508
don't.

670
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:04,042
I am not your pet.
I never liked you.

671
00:51:04,044 --> 00:51:06,634
I don't care about you.
I won't wait for you.

672
00:51:06,636 --> 00:51:08,749
I bite.

673
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,782
Good luck.

674
00:51:53,966 --> 00:51:56,906
Jerks. Come here.
Oh, do this. Do that.

675
00:51:56,908 --> 00:51:59,211
Our Masters. I'll do what I...

676
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:02,573
Hmm...

677
00:52:42,669 --> 00:52:44,362
I suppose
if it was working right,

678
00:52:44,364 --> 00:52:45,773
we'd be dead already.

679
00:53:02,765 --> 00:53:04,941
Don't ask me
to fetch that stick.

680
00:53:09,324 --> 00:53:10,732
Fetch-i!

681
00:53:16,141 --> 00:53:17,578
Fetch-i!

682
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,229
I'm telling you:
I don't fetch.

683
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:29,130
Fetch-i!

684
00:53:29,132 --> 00:53:32,331
I'm not doing this
because you commanded me to.

685
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:35,756
I'm doing it-
because I feel sorry for you.

686
00:53:48,587 --> 00:53:50,509
Good boy.

687
00:54:27,339 --> 00:54:28,649
Where'd you get that dog?

688
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:31,081
He looks like me
with a pink nose.

689
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:35,658
I come from a nine-dog litter,
but they drowned the sisters.

690
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,908
We're not a rare breed:

691
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,572
short-haired-Oceanic-
speckled-ear/

692
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:39,819
sport-hound-mix.

693
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,155
I'm getting confused now.

694
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:44,237
My belly feels funny.

695
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:58,990
Biscuit-o.

696
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:05,227
I can't accept that.
It's for your dog.

697
00:55:09,164 --> 00:55:11,530
I've never been offered
a Puppy-Snap in my life.

698
00:55:11,532 --> 00:55:13,867
I don't even know
what they taste like.

699
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:15,214
Okay, I'll try it.

700
00:55:17,068 --> 00:55:20,585
Crunchy. Salty.

701
00:55:20,587 --> 00:55:22,893
Supposedly, it cleans
your teeth.

702
00:55:24,173 --> 00:55:26,285
This is my new favorite food.

703
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:29,229
Thank you.

704
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,861
Cold up here tonight.

705
00:56:21,387 --> 00:56:22,859
We'll find him.

706
00:56:22,861 --> 00:56:27,850
Wherever he is, if he's alive:
we'll find your dog.

707
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,714
Mayor Kobayashi,

708
00:56:48,716 --> 00:56:50,602
elected leader
of Megasaki City.

709
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:53,258
For 150 years,
you and your ancestors,

710
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,339
known as
the Kobayashi Dynasty,

711
00:56:55,341 --> 00:56:57,161
a procession of
dog-hating thugs,

712
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,530
stooges, felons,
and their criminal underlings,

713
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:01,545
have betrayed and deceived
the citizens

714
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:03,626
of Uni Prefecture.

715
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,060
You make me so mad!

716
00:57:07,244 --> 00:57:08,587
Professor Watanabe,

717
00:57:08,589 --> 00:57:10,827
Science-Party Candidate,
deceased.

718
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:12,746
The wasabi in your blood
showed poison-levels

719
00:57:12,748 --> 00:57:15,306
in excess of ten times
the maximum dosage required

720
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:17,290
to stop the heart of a whale.

721
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:20,938
Why'd you do it?

722
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,939
Atari Kobayashi, adopted ward
to the mayoral-household.

723
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:29,289
You heroically hi-jacked
a Junior Turbo-Prop XJ750

724
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:31,948
and flew it to the island...

725
00:57:48,908 --> 00:57:50,283
Atari.

726
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:51,978
You heroically,
as I was saying,

727
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,851
stole the little airplane,
because of your dog and...

728
00:57:55,853 --> 00:57:58,797
I lost my train of thought.

729
00:57:59,884 --> 00:58:01,995
Dammit!

730
00:58:01,997 --> 00:58:03,917
I've got a crush on you.

731
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:08,333
<i>Part Three:
"The Rendez-Vous."</i>

732
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:36,938
Rex! King! Duke! Boss!
You made it!

733
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,394
What happened to you?
I took a bath.

734
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:43,565
What? He's got soap?
Just a little.

735
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:45,578
You're too fluffy.

736
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,690
- We played fetch.
- With a stick?

737
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,707
With a hunk
of rubber radiator-tubing.

738
00:58:49,709 --> 00:58:51,753
And you brought it back
to him?

739
00:58:51,755 --> 00:58:53,322
Yeah.

740
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:54,605
He's a good boy.

741
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,282
Don't you tell me that!

742
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,914
I'm the one
that tried to make you

743
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:01,387
be loyal to him,
in the first place.

744
00:59:01,389 --> 00:59:03,243
Stop. Stop!
This is the rendezvous.

745
00:59:03,245 --> 00:59:05,131
Where's that trash-tram
taking you?

746
00:59:05,133 --> 00:59:06,987
You think we booked this ride
through a travel agent?

747
00:59:06,989 --> 00:59:08,203
We were fighting for our lives

748
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:09,770
in a high-velocity
trash-processor

749
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:11,146
while you were getting
scrubbed and brushed.

750
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:12,779
- Jump!
- Where?

751
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:14,954
- Here!
- When?

752
00:59:14,956 --> 00:59:16,969
- Now!
- Why?

753
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:19,050
What?
Let's take a vote.

754
00:59:19,052 --> 00:59:21,164
All in favor of jump...

755
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,092
Who's that?

756
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:39,500
I can't smell him.

757
01:00:20,013 --> 01:00:21,514
<i>Come in.</i>

758
01:00:21,516 --> 01:00:22,505
<i>Master Atari...
Can you hear me?</i>

759
01:00:22,507 --> 01:00:23,693
Huh?

760
01:00:45,004 --> 01:00:46,988
That dog's real.

761
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:55,018
What's that thing
in your ear for?

762
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,331
Are you hard of hearing?

763
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,674
You can't be. Um...

764
01:00:57,676 --> 01:00:59,882
Bodyguard-dogs have to have
20/30-Auditory

765
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:01,194
just to be certified.

766
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:02,793
No, the ear-piece
is how I receive

767
01:01:02,795 --> 01:01:04,330
my commands and instructions
and so on.

768
01:01:04,332 --> 01:01:07,049
Obviously, I'm privy to
certain sensitive information

769
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:08,586
due to my position
in the mayoral-household

770
01:01:08,588 --> 01:01:10,121
at Brick Mansion.

771
01:01:10,123 --> 01:01:11,530
Oh, so you mean

772
01:01:11,532 --> 01:01:13,354
somebody could be talking
to you right now?

773
01:01:13,356 --> 01:01:17,258
Well, the range is only about
75 feet or so, I guess, so...

774
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,441
Battery's probably dead,
anyway.

775
01:01:18,443 --> 01:01:19,819
I got a question for you.

776
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:21,899
How much money
do you think the mayor makes?

777
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:23,211
I can't tell you that.

778
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:25,258
That's highly confidential.

779
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,593
Um, anyway, I'm not
the mayor's accountant's dog.

780
01:01:27,595 --> 01:01:28,681
That's Butterscotch,

781
01:01:28,683 --> 01:01:29,961
and she got crushed

782
01:01:29,963 --> 01:01:31,466
in a glass compactor
the day before yesterday.

783
01:01:31,468 --> 01:01:34,570
No, my duties
are, uh, focused entirely

784
01:01:34,572 --> 01:01:36,906
on the protection
of the mayor's ward, Atari.

785
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:38,569
I'm not supposed
to be his friend,

786
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:40,235
but I love him very much,

787
01:01:40,237 --> 01:01:42,219
but that's a private matter.

788
01:01:42,221 --> 01:01:43,722
Um, the only reason
I even said that

789
01:01:43,724 --> 01:01:46,281
was because we're all probably
going to die out here

790
01:01:46,283 --> 01:01:49,610
and I'll never see him again.

791
01:01:53,515 --> 01:01:54,890
That's a tough break.

792
01:01:54,892 --> 01:01:56,714
Well, good luck to you

793
01:01:56,716 --> 01:01:58,700
and watch out
for the cannibal-dogs.

794
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:01,610
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

795
01:02:01,612 --> 01:02:03,754
- What?
- What?

796
01:02:03,756 --> 01:02:06,952
Watch out for the...?
The cannibal-dogs.

797
01:02:06,954 --> 01:02:10,346
They are dogs that eat dogs.
Start over and repeat again.

798
01:02:10,348 --> 01:02:12,587
You know what?
Don't even worry about that.

799
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:13,835
I just heard there might be

800
01:02:13,837 --> 01:02:15,466
some wild, aboriginal,
cannibal-dogs

801
01:02:15,468 --> 01:02:16,553
in the area, you know,

802
01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:17,705
but I wouldn't worry
because you're

803
01:02:17,707 --> 01:02:19,529
in an extra-security
lock cell.

804
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:20,715
Look at it that way.

805
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:22,730
You're probably safer
than I am.

806
01:02:22,732 --> 01:02:24,844
Except from thirst
and starvation.

807
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:01,098
It's got an extra-security
lock on it.

808
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,829
You'll never get it open.

809
01:03:36,492 --> 01:03:38,541
Are you going to eat me now?

810
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:41,385
What did you say?

811
01:03:41,387 --> 01:03:43,114
Are you going to eat me now?

812
01:03:43,116 --> 01:03:44,522
I heard
you were cannibal-dogs.

813
01:03:44,524 --> 01:03:46,922
Be notified: I'll be compelled
to defend myself

814
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,389
with all means at my disposal.

815
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,227
Hmm.

816
01:03:57,229 --> 01:04:00,365
Who told you that dirty lie?

817
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,746
We resorted to cannibalism
on one occasion,

818
01:04:08,748 --> 01:04:09,930
many months ago,

819
01:04:09,932 --> 01:04:11,593
as a desperate
survival instinct.

820
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:14,121
We ate one single dog.

821
01:04:14,123 --> 01:04:15,723
His name was Fuzzball,

822
01:04:15,725 --> 01:04:17,161
and he was the leader
of our pack,

823
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:19,274
and he was already in a coma
from starvation,

824
01:04:19,276 --> 01:04:24,909
- so we put him out of his...
- his...

825
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:30,797
His misery and...

826
01:04:32,557 --> 01:04:34,028
and...

827
01:04:36,044 --> 01:04:38,156
consumed him.

828
01:04:47,531 --> 01:04:49,353
We would have dropped dead
in a week or less

829
01:04:49,355 --> 01:04:50,665
without that nourishment.

830
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:53,612
We were dying.
Do you judge us for that?

831
01:04:54,187 --> 01:04:55,690
Shame on you!

832
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:56,874
We only brought you here

833
01:04:56,876 --> 01:04:58,573
in the first place
to help you.

834
01:05:04,908 --> 01:05:06,794
We've got a Master Pass-Key!

835
01:05:06,796 --> 01:05:08,908
Open his cage.

836
01:05:22,413 --> 01:05:24,588
Fuzzball was his best friend.

837
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,689
Oh, dear.
Uh, I think I offended him.

838
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:39,658
I'm truly sorry.
I had no idea.

839
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,793
What is this place?
How long have you been here?

840
01:05:42,795 --> 01:05:45,482
I can see
you've been mistreated.

841
01:05:49,452 --> 01:05:51,372
Are you okay?

842
01:05:52,972 --> 01:05:56,969
My name is Spots.
Spots Kobayashi.

843
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:59,660
How can I be of service
to you?

844
01:06:01,804 --> 01:06:04,299
Master Atari-san,
can you hear me?

845
01:06:04,301 --> 01:06:05,994
Can you hear me, Master Atari?

846
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,241
Spots-u?

847
01:06:07,243 --> 01:06:08,393
You're not safe here!

848
01:06:08,395 --> 01:06:09,578
You shouldn't have
come for me!

849
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,209
I can't
protect you efficiently

850
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:12,460
under these conditions!

851
01:06:22,763 --> 01:06:24,043
Spots-u!

852
01:06:25,484 --> 01:06:26,957
<i>Here I come.</i>

853
01:06:43,052 --> 01:06:44,013
Sic-'em!

854
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,973
<i>Follow me!</i>

855
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,185
All in favor of kicking
Chief out of the pack

856
01:07:02,187 --> 01:07:04,427
and never speaking
to him again, say "Aye".

857
01:07:04,429 --> 01:07:06,185
Aye!

858
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:11,466
How did you do that?
Secret tooth! Military issue!

859
01:07:11,468 --> 01:07:13,448
Technically, I could do it
37 more times,

860
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,009
but I wouldn't be able
to chew my meat!

861
01:07:16,011 --> 01:07:18,985
I assume you're Spots!
We've been looking for you.

862
01:07:26,763 --> 01:07:28,233
Master Atari-san,

863
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:30,282
I swore an oath when I assumed
the responsibilities

864
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:32,873
of official bodyguard-dog
to the mayoral-household!

865
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,666
I could never be persuaded
to break that vow

866
01:07:34,668 --> 01:07:36,169
for any reason whatsoever!

867
01:07:36,172 --> 01:07:37,417
I'll always be loyal to you

868
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:38,953
as my only
and unconditional master!

869
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:41,449
But circumstances
have radically changed for me

870
01:07:41,451 --> 01:07:43,626
and all the pets
of Megasaki City!

871
01:07:43,628 --> 01:07:45,833
I have new obligations
which I never anticipated!

872
01:07:45,835 --> 01:07:48,042
I've become the leader
of a tribe of outcasts

873
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:49,737
who depend on me
for their survival,

874
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:52,937
and I'm going to be a father!

875
01:07:52,939 --> 01:07:55,115
With deepest sadness
and humility:

876
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:58,154
I must ask you to relieve me
of the duties of my position,

877
01:07:58,155 --> 01:08:00,009
effective immediately.

878
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:02,058
You son of a bitch.

879
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,457
If we don't drown, I'm going
to strangle you myself.

880
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,409
I don't care
how many exploding teeth

881
01:08:06,411 --> 01:08:07,849
you try to spit-out at me.

882
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:09,706
Do you have any idea

883
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:11,178
what that little pilot
just went through

884
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,681
to try to rescue you?

885
01:08:12,683 --> 01:08:13,900
How dare you?

886
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,306
- You're a stray.
- Yeah, so what?

887
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:20,681
What's your name?

888
01:08:20,683 --> 01:08:22,122
Who cares?

889
01:08:22,124 --> 01:08:24,874
You're from central Megasaki.
I can tell by the accent.

890
01:08:24,876 --> 01:08:27,914
You're a short-haired-Oceanic-
speckle-ear/sport-hound-mix.

891
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:29,323
You were born in a storm-sewer

892
01:08:29,325 --> 01:08:32,106
on Bamboo-shoot Holiday
six years ago today.

893
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,417
Do you know me?

894
01:08:33,419 --> 01:08:36,521
I... I don't... I don't know.

895
01:08:36,523 --> 01:08:39,050
I'm your older brother
by five minutes.

896
01:08:39,052 --> 01:08:41,228
It's been a long time, Chief.

897
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:45,644
Was... Was I the runt?

898
01:08:46,796 --> 01:08:48,716
Not anymore.

899
01:08:57,995 --> 01:08:59,338

900
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,873

901
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,208
<i>of the deaths of mayoral-ward
Atari Kobayashi</i>

902
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,417
and his five dog-abductors
this afternoon

903
01:09:05,419 --> 01:09:06,730
in a sluice channel

904
01:09:06,732 --> 01:09:08,778
at the threshold
of the Far-Away Cuticles.

905
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:11,434
A statement from Major-Domo,
live at Brick Mansion:

906
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,329
The life
of a promising young orphan

907
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:18,217
has been cut short
before its prime.

908
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:20,554
This is a distant-uncle's
worst nightmare.

909
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:24,041
Mayor Kobayashi asks for your
prayers, your condolences

910
01:09:24,043 --> 01:09:25,577
and your support
for the diligent men and women

911
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:28,202
of the Municipal Task Force
Dog-Catchers Division:

912
01:09:28,204 --> 01:09:30,954
we salute you for your bravery
and your ongoing commitment

913
01:09:30,956 --> 01:09:34,059
to the continuing punishment
of all bad-dogs.

914
01:09:40,587 --> 01:09:42,473
Originally,
before the volcano erupted

915
01:09:42,475 --> 01:09:43,914
and an earthquake
triggered the tsunami

916
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:45,096
which obliterated
the facility,

917
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,410
there were over 250

918
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:48,137
incarcerated animals
here on the premises

919
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:50,377
being experimented on
against their will.

920
01:09:50,379 --> 01:09:52,234
If you look closely, you may
notice some of these dogs

921
01:09:52,236 --> 01:09:55,692
still bear scars and markings
from the research and abuse.

922
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,401
Actually, it's pretty obvious.

923
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:00,809
This is my mate, Peppermint.

924
01:10:00,811 --> 01:10:02,410
She's pregnant
with our first litter.

925
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:04,106
She was due a week ago.

926
01:10:07,275 --> 01:10:08,618
Anyway,

927
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,057
the survivors of the disaster
learned to cultiv...

928
01:10:10,059 --> 01:10:11,881
What's he got there?
What's he got there?

929
01:10:11,883 --> 01:10:15,529
Biscuit-o. Biscuit-o.
Biscuit-o.

930
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:17,609
Puppy-Snaps.

931
01:10:17,612 --> 01:10:20,298
I heard they don't even
make them anymore.

932
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,642
You heard the rumor, right?

933
01:10:21,644 --> 01:10:22,793
About Kobayashi
Pharmaceutical.

934
01:10:22,795 --> 01:10:24,426
I never heard it.
What rumor?

935
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,345
They invented Dog-Flu.

936
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,874
- No.
- Of course.

937
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:30,121
That makes sense.

938
01:10:30,123 --> 01:10:31,433
Where do you get
all these rumors?

939
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,937
I mean,
who tells them to you?

940
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:34,057
I don't know. Anybody.

941
01:10:34,059 --> 01:10:36,041
Dogs talk, and I listen.
Always have.

942
01:10:36,043 --> 01:10:37,865
I, uh, love gossip.

943
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,084
Spots!

944
01:10:40,492 --> 01:10:43,337
The black owl has a message.

945
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:49,961
He's come from all the way
across the island.

946
01:10:49,963 --> 01:10:51,945
Get him a cup
of sewer-water, Chico.

947
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,834
Mmm-hmm.

948
01:10:53,836 --> 01:10:55,306
Mmm-hmm.

949
01:10:55,308 --> 01:10:56,777
Yes. We understand.

950
01:10:56,779 --> 01:10:58,826
He has news from the
Metropolitan Dumping-Grounds.

951
01:10:58,828 --> 01:11:02,409
Metropolitan...
Shh! Quiet, please.

952
01:11:02,411 --> 01:11:06,091
We're listening, owl.
Tell us your message.

953
01:11:10,572 --> 01:11:12,553
He's going to poison us.

954
01:11:12,555 --> 01:11:13,993
Re-election Night:

955
01:11:13,995 --> 01:11:16,393
at the moment Mayor Kobayashi
is re-inaugurated,

956
01:11:16,395 --> 01:11:17,738
he'll give the order,

957
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,754
and the extermination-process
will begin.

958
01:11:19,756 --> 01:11:22,058
<i>Oracle saw the plan

959

<i>It may be too late, already;</i>

965
01:11:37,132 --> 01:11:38,666

reaches you</i>

966
01:11:38,668 --> 01:11:40,204
<i>with this message in time:</i>

967
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:45,066
Go to Megasaki City.
Find our masters.

01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:48,650
Appeal to the people.
Stop the mayor.

969
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:50,252
Save us.

970
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:57,546
We're crossing
the river tonight.

971
01:11:57,548 --> 01:11:59,596
Begin preparations
immediately.

972
01:12:07,979 --> 01:12:10,152
You'll meet a bitch
named Nutmeg.

973
01:12:10,154 --> 01:12:14,154
Tell her Chief says:
I'll see you in Megasaki.

974
01:13:40,843 --> 01:13:41,929
Hmm.

975
01:13:41,931 --> 01:13:44,488
Beautiful night.

976
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:47,276
Peppermint's in labor.
Oh.

977
01:13:48,459 --> 01:13:50,825
Come sit beside me.

978
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:54,344
It's okay.

979
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:57,256
Master Atari, are you willing
to accept my brother Chief

980
01:13:57,259 --> 01:13:59,688
as new bodyguard-dog
in personal service to you,

981
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:01,932
former ward

982
01:14:21,516 --> 01:14:23,625
Chief, are you willing
to accept

983
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:25,418
Atari as your direct master,

984
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,009
to serve and protect
his safety and welfare

985
01:14:28,011 --> 01:14:30,732
with all courage, loyalty
and friendship?

986
01:14:34,955 --> 01:14:37,067
I can do that.

987
01:14:37,547 --> 01:14:39,019
Good.

988
01:15:41,322 --> 01:15:43,436

Are you Professor Watanabe's

former Assistant-Scientist,
Yoko-ono-san?

992
01:16:09,674 --> 01:16:11,595
Do I have it?

993
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:16,716
Too late.

994
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,953
Do I have it?

995
01:16:22,955 --> 01:16:24,296
Too late.

996

Nobody care.

997
01:16:30,348 --> 01:16:32,297
Do I have it?
Do I have the story?

998
01:16:32,299 --> 01:16:33,929
Yes or no? On the record!

999
01:16:33,931 --> 01:16:35,369
I am sorry for your loss,

1000
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:37,929
but we both know:
that was no suicide!

1001
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:41,674
I need to prove
my conspiracy-theory!

1002
01:16:41,676 --> 01:16:46,184
Ben is dead.
No future on Trash Island.

1003
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:48,107
I am failure.

1004
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:53,164
Pull yourself together
and act like a scientist!

1005
01:16:57,258 --> 01:17:00,300
Professor Watanabe
never gave up.

1006
01:17:11,403 --> 01:17:13,674
Is this... Is this the serum?

1007
01:17:13,676 --> 01:17:16,329
The Dog-Flu cure?
The Snout-fever treatment?

1008
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:19,112
The end of the Canine
Saturation-crisis?

1009
01:17:19,114 --> 01:17:21,227
Last dose.

1010
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:25,419

There will never be a place

1018

There will never be room

01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:49,067
to bring him the red button.

1054
01:20:03,819 --> 01:20:05,547
Nutmeg!

1055
01:20:57,034 --> 01:21:00,200
Holy smokes!
My lungs feel clear.

1056
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:02,441
My equilibrium feels balanced.

1057
01:21:02,443 --> 01:21:06,218
My vision is sharp as a tack
for the first time in months.

1058
01:21:09,385 --> 01:21:12,967
Wow, that's a great serum!

1059
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,826
Master Atari, whose death,
I think we can say,

1060
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,673
appears to have been
inaccurately reported,

1061
01:21:17,674 --> 01:21:19,369
has asked to read a statement
to the General Assembly.

1062
01:21:19,371 --> 01:21:21,064
He will then withdraw
from the debate

1063
01:21:21,066 --> 01:21:23,339
and respond
to no further questions.

1064
01:21:28,075 --> 01:21:29,448
Dear Editor-Hiroshi

1065
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,752
of the Megasaki Senior High
Daily-Manifesto:

1066
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:33,128
in a series
of first-rate articles

1067
01:21:33,131 --> 01:21:37,000
by an attractive cub-reporter
on your staff,

1068
01:21:37,002 --> 01:21:38,185
you shine a spot-light

1069
01:21:38,188 --> 01:21:39,304
on the great injustice
that has occurred

1070
01:21:39,306 --> 01:21:41,384
under the Kobayashi
Administration.

1071
01:21:41,386 --> 01:21:43,305
I have spent much of my time
in recent weeks

1072
01:21:43,307 --> 01:21:45,576
traveling in the company
of the very kind of animals

1073
01:21:45,578 --> 01:21:47,879
our mayor refers to
as "bad-dogs."

1074
01:21:47,882 --> 01:21:48,905
They are the finest
living-beings

1075
01:21:48,907 --> 01:21:50,250
I have ever come to know

1076
01:21:50,252 --> 01:21:51,848
in all my dozen years
on this earth.

1077
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:54,249
To your readers,
the good people of Megasaki,

1078
01:21:54,251 --> 01:21:56,072
I say: the cycle of life

1079
01:21:56,074 --> 01:21:57,929
always hangs
in a delicate balance.

1080
01:21:57,931 --> 01:22:01,001
Who are we,
and who do we want to be?

1081
01:22:01,003 --> 01:22:03,144
Who are we?

1082
01:22:06,732 --> 01:22:09,033
I wrote a haiku
to try to express my feelings

1083
01:22:09,035 --> 01:22:11,176
about the suffering dogs
of Trash Island.

1084
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:13,385
It is also about nature, love,

1085
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:16,170
friendship, eternity,
and a black owl.

1086
01:22:16,172 --> 01:22:18,956
I call it: Atari's Lantern.

1087
01:22:59,115 --> 01:23:01,096
He said a haiku.

1088
01:23:01,098 --> 01:23:04,076
I'll tell you later.

1089
01:23:06,025 --> 01:23:07,176
I dedicate this poem

1090
01:23:07,178 --> 01:23:09,353
to my distant-uncle,
Mayor Kobayashi,

1091
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:12,360
who took me in
when I myself was a stray-dog

1092
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,025
with nowhere else to turn.

1093
01:23:14,027 --> 01:23:15,977
Editor-Hiroshi,
please extend my subscription

1094
01:23:15,979 --> 01:23:17,480
for an additional year.

1095
01:23:17,482 --> 01:23:19,784
I enclose a check in the
amount of one thousand yen.

1096
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:21,992
Signed, Atari Kobayashi,

1097
01:23:21,994 --> 01:23:24,236
former ward
to the mayoral-household.

1098
01:23:26,379 --> 01:23:28,043
Hmm.

1099
01:23:42,186 --> 01:23:43,595
Not-fair-to-the-boy.

1100
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:48,396
Not-fair-to-the-dog.

1101
01:23:50,763 --> 01:23:53,674
He says: "I-have-no-honor."

1102
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:02,284
Hmm?

1103
01:24:11,754 --> 01:24:13,353
Holy Moses!

1104
01:24:13,355 --> 01:24:14,633
The mayor
has just officially

1105
01:24:14,635 --> 01:24:16,744
unstamped
the Trash Island Decree!

1106
01:24:16,745 --> 01:24:18,825
No kidding!

1107
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:27,688
Major-Domo
is accusing the mayor

1108
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:29,223
of breaking
his campaign promise!

1109
01:24:29,225 --> 01:24:30,855
He's steaming mad!

1110
01:24:37,707 --> 01:24:39,436
It's gonna be a fight!

1111
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:47,144
Spit him with a tooth!
I can't get a clean shot.

1112
01:24:47,146 --> 01:24:50,602
Too many innocent protesters.
I'll be right back.

1113
01:25:45,867 --> 01:25:47,784
Escape!

1114
01:25:47,786 --> 01:25:48,936
Escape! Escape!

1115
01:25:48,938 --> 01:25:50,475
Escape!

1116
01:26:21,835 --> 01:26:23,624
Well, the brain surgery
was a complete success.

1117
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:24,808
But his left kidney failed

1118
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,569
due to the stress
of the operation.

1119
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:27,943
But, what about
the right one?

1120
01:26:27,945 --> 01:26:30,344
He lost it in a train-crash
three years ago.

1121
01:26:33,323 --> 01:26:36,489
Take my left kidney...

1122
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:40,075
give it to Atari-kun.

1123
01:27:24,777 --> 01:27:26,600
<i>According
to a long-standing statute</i>

1124
01:27:26,602 --> 01:27:27,880
<i>unique to Uni Prefecture,</i>

1125
01:27:27,882 --> 01:27:29,256
<i>in the event of the death,</i>

1126
01:27:29,259 --> 01:27:30,376
<i>disappearance,
or felony-prosecution</i>

1127
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:31,689
<i>of the chosen candidate</i>

1128
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:33,064
<i>on, while, during,
or concurrent</i>

1129
01:27:33,066 --> 01:27:34,409
<i>with the Re-Election-Night
ceremony,</i>

1130
01:27:34,411 --> 01:27:35,817
<i>all powers and authorities</i>

1131
01:27:35,819 --> 01:27:37,128
<i>vested in his or her
designated office</i>

1132
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:38,665
<i>transfer forthwith
to his or her</i>

1133
01:27:38,666 --> 01:27:40,360
<i>next-of-kin and/or
appointed heir.</i>

1134
01:27:40,362 --> 01:27:41,897
<i>In other words,</i>

1135
01:27:41,898 --> 01:27:45,480
Atari Kobayashi is the new
mayor of Megasaki City!

1136
01:27:45,482 --> 01:27:47,368
<i>You heard me right:
Atari Kobayashi</i>

1137
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:49,832
<i>is the new mayor
of Megasaki City!</i>

1138
01:27:49,834 --> 01:27:51,947
<i>Let's hope
that new kidney works.</i>

1139
01:27:52,808 --> 01:27:55,562
Boy, what a night!

1140
01:27:59,402 --> 01:28:00,808
<i>Life in Uni Prefecture</i>

1141
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:03,081
<i>returned to a comfortable
tranquility.</i>

1142
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:05,896
<i>The Megasaki Dragons
ended their winning streak</i>

1143
01:28:05,897 --> 01:28:08,363
<i>with a staggering loss
to the Honda Goblins.</i>

1144
01:28:09,611 --> 01:28:11,048
<i>Doggy-Chop re-opened</i>

1145
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:13,032
<i>all 11
of its domestic factories-</i>

1146
01:28:13,034 --> 01:28:14,664
<i>and Puppy-Snaps
resumed production</i>

1147
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:16,363
<i>with an improved product.</i>

1148
01:28:20,649 --> 01:28:22,185
<i>Graft and political corruption</i>

1149
01:28:22,187 --> 01:28:25,419
<i>were reduced to sustainable,
acceptable levels.</i>

1150
01:28:27,242 --> 01:28:28,712
<i>The Dog-Flu serum</i>

1151
01:28:28,714 --> 01:28:31,083
<i>cured every breathing-animal
in the region.</i>

1152
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:37,161
<i>Some say
a few lost-dogs</i>

1153
01:28:37,163 --> 01:28:39,177
<i>continue to roam and scavenge</i>

1154
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:40,617
<i>on Trash Island.</i>

1155
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:44,779
<i>However, these
rumors remain unconfirmed.</i>

1156
01:28:51,403 --> 01:28:52,712
<i>Mayor Atari,</i>

1157
01:28:52,714 --> 01:28:54,344
<i>we all agree
it should be a crime</i>

1158
01:28:54,346 --> 01:28:55,849
<i>to abuse, beat, murder</i>

1159
01:28:55,851 --> 01:28:57,992
<i>or yell at any dog
in Megasaki City.</i>

1160
01:28:57,993 --> 01:28:59,655
<i>That is not the question.</i>

1161
01:28:59,657 --> 01:29:01,001
<i>The question is:</i>

1162
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:03,304
<i>what is the appropriate
punishment?</i>

1163
01:29:03,306 --> 01:29:07,210
<i>Exactly. And the answer is:
Death Penalty.</i>

1164
01:29:08,747 --> 01:29:11,271
<i>That seems excessive to us.</i>

1165
01:29:11,274 --> 01:29:13,001
<i>Possibly. Anyway,
we should make it</i>

1166
01:29:13,002 --> 01:29:14,761
<i>at least 30 days
community-service</i>

1167
01:29:14,763 --> 01:29:17,415
<i>and a fine
of no less than 250,000 yen.</i>

1168
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:18,730
<i>Meeting adjourned.</i>

1169
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:33,482
I'm standing-by, Master Atari.

1170
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:38,728
So how does it feel
to be a former stray?

1171
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:41,353
Hmm. I take it
one day at a time.

1172
01:29:41,355 --> 01:29:42,823
Last week, I nearly be-handed

1173
01:29:42,825 --> 01:29:45,032
an industrial lobbyist
from West Suzuki.

1174
01:29:45,033 --> 01:29:46,984
They had to give him
a blood transfusion.

1175
01:29:46,986 --> 01:29:49,544
He probably had it coming.

1176
01:29:49,546 --> 01:29:52,392
Maybe. Learned any new tricks?

1177
01:29:52,394 --> 01:29:54,440
Actually, yes. Just one.

1178
01:29:54,442 --> 01:29:56,202
Can I see it?

1179
01:29:58,729 --> 01:29:59,943
I'm supposed to be juggling

1180
01:29:59,945 --> 01:30:01,160
ten bowling-pins
engulfed in flames

1181
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:02,375
over my tail at this point,

1182
01:30:02,377 --> 01:30:04,712
but you just have to imagine
that part.

1183
01:30:05,995 --> 01:30:08,137
I can picture it.

1184
01:30:08,139 --> 01:30:13,096
You still against bringing
puppies into this world?

1185
01:30:13,098 --> 01:30:15,433
I'll tell you
when I get to know you better.

1186
01:30:15,435 --> 01:30:17,320
Fair enough.

1187
01:30:17,322 --> 01:30:19,944
My friends think
I like to fight,

1188
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,831
but it's just not true.

1189
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,329
Sometimes I lose my temper
and blow off a little steam,

1190
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:26,887
but I've never enjoyed it.

1191
01:30:26,889 --> 01:30:28,810
I'm not a violent dog.

1192
01:30:30,155 --> 01:30:32,234
I don't know why I bite.

1193
01:30:33,579 --> 01:30:36,011
I'm not attracted
to tame animals.

1194
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,906
Thank you.
