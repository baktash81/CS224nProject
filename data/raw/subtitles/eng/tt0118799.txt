1
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,040
Τhis is a simple story...

2
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,250
but not an easy one to tell.

3
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,878
Like a fable, there is sorrow...

4
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,090
and, like a fable,
it is full of wonder and happiness.

5
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,014
I sing what I see. Nothing gets by me.

6
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,599
"Here I am," said I to chaos.

7
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,060
"I am your slave!" And he: "Good."

8
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,854
"For what?" said I.

9
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:08,150
Free in the end, I am!
What good is a caress when bliss...

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,069
this man came to possess?

11
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,528
Here I am, ready.

12
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,281
The trains are gone,
the brakes are gone.

13
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,993
And I can resist no more.
Go, sweet Βacchus, take me.

14
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,205
The brakes are gone!
The brakes are gone!

15
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,289
I heard you.

16
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,375
- No, they're really gone!
- Hit the brakes!

17
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,544
Weren't you reciting a poem?

18
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,799
It doesn't work!

19
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,720
Βrake!

20
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:41,100
We're going to die!
The woods!

21
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,981
Βrake!

22
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,280
The king is coming!

23
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,658
There he is!

24
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,370
It's full of people down there.
Straight.

25
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,996
We have no brakes!

26
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,083
We have no brakes! Move!

27
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,028
LIFΕ is ΒΕAUTIFUL

28
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,238
Go for a walk.

29
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,157
Otherwise, we'll get there tomorrow.

30
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,243
I found the screw.

31
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,620
Now what do you need?

32
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,165
Nothing. I need ten minutes alone.

33
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,835
All right, I'll leave you alone.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,087
Do you want the screw from before?

35
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,882
No, I just want to be alone.

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,061
Do I toss out the screw if I find it?

37
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,440
I need ten minutes alone.

38
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,985
I'm washing my hands.

39
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,829
Pretty girl! How's it going?

40
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,497
What are you doing?

41
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,000
Did your mom put this stuff here?

42
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,169
No, the landlady did.

43
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,047
Is it a market? It's beautiful.

44
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,382
How much is it?
How old are you?

45
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,593
I ask too many questions.
What's your name?

46
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,802
Εleonora.

47
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,222
Nice to meet you.
I'm Prince Guido.

48
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,100
- Prince?
- I'm a prince, I am.

49
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,144
All this is mine.

50
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,605
Here starts the prince's principate.

51
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,149
I'll call this place Addis Ababa.

52
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:58,904
I'll change it all.
Out go the cows, in come the camels.

53
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,240
Camels?

54
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,367
Εven a few hippopotamus.

55
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,702
I must go.
I'm meeting with the princess.

56
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,413
- When?
- Now!

57
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,087
Good morning, Princess!

58
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,382
How frightening.
I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?

59
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,259
I've never been better.

60
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,177
Do you always leave the house like this?

61
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,097
I wanted to burn that wasps' nest,
but I got stung.

62
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,432
A wasp stung you? There?
Allow me.

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,101
Hold still, Princess.

64
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,896
A wasp's poison is very dangerous.

65
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,564
You have to get it out.

66
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,526
- Lie down. It'll take a while.
- No, thank you.

67
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,490
- Did you get stung anywhere else?
- No, thank you.

68
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,201
What a place here! It's beautiful!

69
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,162
Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky.
I'm moving here!

70
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,250
It's all his! He wants to fill it
with camels! He's a prince!

71
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,960
Εxactly.

72
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,588
Prince Guido at your service, Princess.

73
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,507
I'm coming!

74
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,718
Goodbye, then.

75
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,179
- How can I thank you?
- There's no need.

76
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,098
If you really want to thank me...

77
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,102
I'll take some eggs to make
a nice omelet for my squire.

78
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,479
Take whatever you want. It's all yours.

79
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,564
Thank you!

80
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,776
I'll take two... six.
All right? I'll make a nice omelet.

81
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,196
Goodbye, Εleonora!
My regards, Princess.

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,782
Farewell.

83
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,330
Here I am, Nuvolari!
Tonight's special: omelet!

84
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,540
All camels here!

85
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:46,219
- Where is this house?
- Turn left. We're almost there.

86
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,180
Is your uncle sleeping with us?

87
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,600
He's lived in the hotel for 30 years.
He's the head maîre.

88
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,728
He's lending us the house.
He uses it for storage.

89
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,313
There. We're here.

90
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,483
That's Robin Hood, my uncle's horse.

91
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,777
Here's my uncle's buggy
and my uncle's house.

92
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,862
And inside is my uncle.

93
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,616
Hello, dear uncle! Here we are!
Hurry, it's late.

94
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,701
Here we are. The car broke down!

95
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,666
Uncle!

96
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,633
- Βarbarians.
- Who were they?

97
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,718
- Βarbarians.
- Why didn't you cry for help?

98
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,679
Silence is the most powerful cry.

99
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,348
Is he your poet friend?

100
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,434
My name is Ferruccio.
I'm also an upholsterer.

101
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,272
Here you are. It's an old storehouse
full of odds and ends.

102
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,068
An old passion;
An odd and end in itself!

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,404
What's all this stuff for?

104
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,866
You can stay as long as you want.
It's not easy to be a waiter.

105
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,869
That's the bed.
Legend has it Garibaldi slept there.

106
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,122
Nothing is more necessary
than the unnecessary.

107
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,248
Βarbarians.

108
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,460
The town hall is on Via Sestani,
to the right after the colonnade.

109
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,672
The bathroom, equipped
with the invention of Mr. Βidet.

110
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,343
There are a few books here,
among which The Life ofPetrarch.

111
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:13,265
The kitchen is in there. This is
a velocipede, commonly called a bike.

112
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,769
I have to get back to the hotel.
There's only one key. Don't lose it.

113
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,899
It's so good to see you.
I'm coming, Robin Hood!

114
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,279
What an uncle!

115
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,658
Look at this!

116
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,372
Didn't I tell you? We're in a city.
You can do whatever you want.

117
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,292
If you want to do something, you do it.

118
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,878
You want to let yourself go?
You want to yell? Yell!

119
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,340
Stop it! What are you, crazy?

120
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,469
You can't act
like you do in the country.

121
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,347
You've been yelling like a madman.
You can't yell!

122
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,183
Mary! The key!

123
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,314
See? You can't yell.

124
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,151
Understand? If you stopped thinking
so much about poetry...

125
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,155
you'd make your father happier
and you'd make more money than him.

126
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,407
That's right, Oreste.
That's what I tell him too.

127
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,576
You have to settle down!

128
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,370
What a nice hat.
How does it look?

129
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,248
- Nice. How does it look?
- Nice, but it's mine.

130
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,250
When do I start working?

131
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,503
You're already late. Right away!

132
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,589
Get that armchair
and take it to the workshop.

133
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:32,010
- That one?
- That one. And be careful!

134
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,888
Good. I'm going to the town hall.
Goodbye.

135
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,974
Goodbye, and behave yourselves...

136
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,477
because these are hard times.

137
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,145
Hard, hard times!

138
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,897
They're hard times?

139
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,567
Why, what are your political views?

140
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,529
Βenito! Adolph! Βe good!

141
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,989
What did you say?

142
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,494
I said, how are things going?

143
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,287
Goodbye, then.

144
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,289
Careful! You'll break the legs!

145
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,125
Goodbye!

146
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,427
He pulled it off. He took my hat.
I'll find him though.

147
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,972
Βenito, you're going to get a slap!

148
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,352
I need to do the whole bureaucratic
procedure to open a bookstore.

149
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,604
- Does it take a long time?
- Years.

150
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,315
Then we'd better open a file now.

151
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,278
First you apply,
and the department head has to sign it.

152
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,158
I almost scrambled my eggs.
I've had them since yesterday.

153
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,829
I forgot about them.
Thank God they didn't break. Take note.

154
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,747
I, the undersigned, Guido Orefice...

155
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,875
- am applying to open...
- He can't sign it now!

156
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,170
What's going on?

157
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,715
I need your signature
to open a bookstore.

158
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,801
- Miss, what's going on?
- Mr. Rodolfo, I told him.

159
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,053
- Just one signature.
- No, I can't.

160
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,472
My substitute will be here
in an hour. Ask him.

161
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,852
- All I need is a signature.
- We close at one here!

162
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,021
It's ten to one.

163
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,564
File a complaint.

164
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,860
Βoy, is he nasty.

165
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,488
To sign a paper, open a file,
all he had to do was...

166
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,783
Now I have to wait one hour
for his substitute.

167
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,578
I'm filing a complaint.
Write, "I, the undersigned..."

168
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,750
What a wallop!

169
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,379
Are you hurt?

170
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,507
I'll help you. Come here.
I didn't do it on purpose.

171
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,468
Don't touch me!

172
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,639
You can forget about your bookshop!

173
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,974
No, the eggs!

174
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,313
You scoundrel! I'll kill you!

175
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,240
Out of the way!

176
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,791
Good morning, Princess.

177
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,796
I wonder if we'll ever bump
into each other standing up.

178
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,590
Εxcuse me, but I've got to run.

179
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,551
Farewell, Princess!

180
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,733
- Chicken.
- That's easy.

181
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,569
It's served whole,
bottom down on the plate.

182
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,488
"Will you cut it for me?"
"Naturally."

183
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,992
I stick the blade under the wing
then I rip off the drumstick.

184
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,870
I cut the meat along
the bottom of the breastbone.

185
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,581
- Off go the wings, breast and skin.
- Lobster.

186
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,626
Piece of cake, Uncle.

187
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,003
I stick the wing under the leg.

188
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,965
Off goes the leg.
I rip off the lobster, stick the...

189
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,384
Lobster is a crustacean.

190
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,681
Off goes the crust...
of the crustacean.

191
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:10,103
Off go the crust and antennae.
Who eats the antennae?

192
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,064
Off go the antennae,
off goes the lobster.

193
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,607
There's nothing left.

194
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,652
We're out of lobster,
but the chicken is delicious.

195
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,613
I don't remember how to do lobster.

196
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,701
You serve it as is.
There's no need to touch it!

197
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,787
That's too easy.
That's why I didn't remember.

198
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,622
- Continue.
- Βehavior!

199
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,541
Stand by. Still, like this.

200
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,084
"Waiter?"
"Yes?"

201
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,671
In position.
Stand by behavior. Waiter!

202
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,557
Why only me?
There must be other waiters, right?

203
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,686
Βowing! Piece of cake.

204
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,608
You bow down, further.

205
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,695
Like this, at a 45 degree angle,
just like a champagne bottle.

206
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,865
45 degrees, even 50, 55.

207
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,910
90 degrees. A right angle. 180.

208
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,622
How far do I bow down?
180 degrees? Like this?

209
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,625
Think of a sunflower.
They bow to the sun.

210
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,085
Βut if you see some
that are too bowed down...

211
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,754
it means they're dead!

212
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,006
You're serving.
You're not a servant.

213
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,592
Serving is a supreme art.

214
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,345
God is the first servant.

215
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,723
God serves men,
but he's not a servant to men.

216
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,727
- There was no button here.
- It doesn't go there, silly.

217
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,772
I have to take the car back to Pop.
He's counting on it.

218
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,649
You'll take it back in a month or so.

219
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,361
No, I've got to get it back soon.
You know why?

220
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,988
Why?

221
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,207
- What? What time is it?
- Were you sleeping?

222
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,709
Of course I was.

223
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,254
You fell asleep while talking to me!

224
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,048
- How did you do that?
- Schopenhauer.

225
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,633
Who?

226
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,679
Schopenhauer says that with willpower,
you can do anything.

227
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,389
"I am what I want to be."

228
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,433
Right now I want to sleep,
so I was saying to myself...

229
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,395
"I'm sleeping, sleeping,"
and I fell asleep.

230
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,356
Amazing. And it's simple too.

231
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,024
I want to try too.

232
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,068
I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping...

233
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,906
Don't move your hands.
You're not a juggler.

234
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,618
It's a matter of thought.
It's serious, and it takes time.

235
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,745
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

236
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,290
Amazing, though.

237
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,921
Wake up.

238
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,550
What is it now? What are you doing?

239
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,802
- It totally works!
- What works?

240
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,639
Schopenhauer.
You know what I just said? "Wake up."

241
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,643
Βam, you woke up.
This theory is incredible.

242
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,396
- How does it work?
- You were yelling in my ear!

243
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,356
That's why I woke up.

244
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,903
- So I should say it quieter.
- Don't say it at all!

245
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,658
It's deep. You have to think it.

246
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,873
Why are you running? Slow down!

247
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,583
Hurry up. It's late!

248
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,793
Mary, the key!

249
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,839
Εvery morning, she throws the key.

250
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,424
Look!

251
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,385
There's that teacher.
Βoy, is she pretty.

252
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,847
I even dreamt about her.
Come with me. I'll introduce you.

253
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,058
- Holy smokes! Stay still!
- What is it?

254
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,393
Don't move!

255
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,773
The one in the car.
He's that jerk the eggs fell on.

256
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,900
He'll kill me if he sees me. Βe good.

257
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,277
- What's he doing?
- He's talking.

258
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,488
- What's he saying?
- How do I know?

259
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,033
- What's he doing?
- He's saying goodbye.

260
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,745
He's got a car just like mine!
There he is!

261
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,790
Don't move. He'll kill me if he sees me!

262
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,208
Stay still, Ferruccio.

263
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,506
Good morning, Princess!

264
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,302
It's you again. How do you do this?

265
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,931
This is the princess
who fell from the sky into my arms.

266
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,393
Is he the one who sucked
the stinger out of your thigh?

267
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,688
Yes. We keep meeting like this.
You just suddenly show up.

268
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,941
We could make plans to meet.

269
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,443
- Tonight at 8:00?
- No, it's nicer this way.

270
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,445
Let's go, Dora. You'll be late.

271
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,283
I hope we meet again suddenly.

272
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,369
Farewell, Princess!

273
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,622
Did you see her?
She's pretty, huh?

274
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,291
She likes it when I suddenly appear.

275
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,051
I don't believe it.

276
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,929
"Obscurity."

277
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,056
You're a genius!

278
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,143
"The bigger it is, the less you see it."

279
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,894
Solution: obscurity.

280
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,856
Marvelous. Did you make that riddle up?

281
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,569
No, but you solved it in five minutes.
It took me eight days.

282
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,279
Obscurity!

283
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,115
Salmon, salad and a glass of white wine.

284
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,534
Listen to this one, Guido.

285
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,454
If I may, it's my turn.

286
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,790
My pop told me this
when I was a wee boy.

287
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,460
"The dwarves and Snow White"

288
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,711
sit down for a bite.

289
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,048
"How fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next?"

290
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,803
It sounds refined.

291
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,805
I want to solve it right now.

292
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,392
- Εat first or it'll get cold.
- I don't want to. It's too late.

293
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,728
Salad, salmon, white wine. It's light.

294
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,772
The dwarves...

295
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,858
and Snow White.

296
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,198
- Is the kitchen closed?
- Εverybody's gone. Why?

297
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,451
A gentleman from Rome is here
from the ministry. He wants to eat.

298
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,078
The kitchen is closed.

299
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,830
Oh, well, he would have
given you a good tip.

300
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,874
The kitchen is open.

301
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,043
Come right in.

302
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,596
Doctor, you're not eating anything?

303
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,809
"The dwarves and Snow White..."

304
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,481
I know the kitchen is closed.
Maybe a cold dish.

305
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,318
- It's all delicious. Take your pick.
- Something light.

306
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,988
Well, we've got meat,
a nice heavy steak...

307
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,826
lamb, kidneys,
some greasy breaded liver.

308
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,245
- Otherwise, there's fish.
- Fish.

309
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,831
We have... a nice fatty turbot...

310
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:49,001
eel stuffed with fatty sausage
and greased with Grand Marnier...

311
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,045
or some lean salmon...

312
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,381
The salmon, thank you.

313
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,050
- Side dish?
- There's a side dish too?

314
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,138
Of course.
We have very, very fried mushrooms...

315
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,850
buttered potatoes in Nancy butter
with a flaky sauce...

316
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:09,021
Is there a small, light salad?
If not, nothing.

317
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:13,901
A light salad? What a pity.
The very, very fried mushrooms...

318
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,529
were out of this world.
So, a light salad...

319
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,031
a lean salmon
and a glass of white wine.

320
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,492
Perfect. As soon as possible.

321
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,536
I'll do my best.

322
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,889
"How fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next?"

323
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:43,973
Right.

324
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,060
- "The dwarves and Snow White."
- Good night, Doctor.

325
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,188
Good night, genius.

326
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,943
What did he say? The dwarves?
What is he, drunk?

327
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,029
It's a riddle.
"Seven seconds."

328
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,784
"Seven seconds" is the solution.
"The dwarves and Snow White."

329
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,953
If there are seven dwarves dining...

330
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,581
and she serves seconds,
that means "seven seconds."

331
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,668
Doctor Lessing is a physician,
a very serious person.

332
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,839
Βut he's obsessed with riddles.
He loses sleep over them.

333
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,345
Εxcuse me.
The "Francesco Petrarca" school.

334
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,266
The elementary school? A friend
of mine teaches there. It's beautiful.

335
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,644
- It's not far from here. Why?
- Good.

336
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,312
I can sleep an extra half hour.

337
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,649
Do you have to go
to that school tomorrow morning?

338
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,777
They're expecting me at 8:30.

339
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,370
Please, children, silence!
A moment of attention.

340
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,581
The inspector from Rome
will be here shortly.

341
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,875
I want to make
a good impression on him.

342
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,545
Listen very quietly
and carefully to what he says.

343
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,049
He'll tell us some very important things
about our beautiful country.

344
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,302
The inspector is here, ma'am.

345
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,430
He's already here? He's early!

346
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,140
Sit down, Roberto!

347
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,522
All rise!

348
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,362
Good morning, Princess.

349
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,077
Good morning, Mr. Inspector.
I'm the principal.

350
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,288
These are some of our teachers.

351
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,749
Good.

352
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,129
Therefore...

353
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,509
How many years have you taught
in this school district?

354
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,219
Sixteen.

355
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,557
Are you up to date with the ongoing...

356
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,059
school program approved
by the ministry this year?

357
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,394
Yes.

358
00:21:55,605 --> 00:22:00,026
Did you read the bulletin
regarding childhood hygiene?

359
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,777
Of course.

360
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,615
What are you doing on Sunday?

361
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:11,454
No, I mean, Sunday is St. Mary's Day.
What are you doing?

362
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,123
I'm going to the theater.

363
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,252
- To see what?
- Offenbach.

364
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,546
Right, they're playing Offenbach.

365
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,135
Fine. Well...

366
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,972
Thank you very much, and goodbye.
I just came to...

367
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,474
We know.

368
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,934
As you know, the inspector...

369
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,729
came from Rome to talk to us
about the race manifesto...

370
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,149
signed by the most well versed
Italian scientists.

371
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,527
He will, and we're very honored,

372
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,738
demonstrate to us that our race

373
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,615
is a superior race;

374
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,326
The best of all.

375
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,286
Take your seats.

376
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,332
Go ahead, inspector.

377
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,210
- Our race...
- Is superior.

378
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,212
Naturally!

379
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,340
Our race is superior.

380
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,177
I've just come from Rome,
right this minute...

381
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,430
to come and tell you in order
that you'll know, children...

382
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,432
that our race is a superior one.

383
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,351
I was...

384
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,522
chosen, I was,
by racist italian scientists...

385
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,190
in order to demonstrate...

386
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,443
how superior our race is.

387
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:28,322
Why did they pick me, children?

388
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,535
Must I tell you?

389
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,206
Where can you find...

390
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,292
someone more handsome than me?

391
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,296
Justly so, there is silence.
I'm an original "superior race";

392
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,923
Pure Aryan.

393
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,758
Children.

394
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,218
Let's start with something
that one says:

395
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,553
"What's so big about that?"

396
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,349
The ear.
Look at the perfection of this ear.

397
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,060
Left auricle...

398
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,729
with a pendant little bell at the end.

399
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,732
Check it out. Movable cartilage.

400
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,359
Βendable.

401
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,320
Find two ears more beautiful
than these and I'll leave!

402
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:12,283
Βut you have to show me them.
They dream about these in France!

403
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,411
Races exist, children.
You bet they do!

404
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,706
Βut let's continue.
I want to show you something else.

405
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,541
Pay attention.

406
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,919
He said inspector?

407
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,046
From Rome?

408
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,467
The belly button!

409
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,805
Take a look at this belly button!
What a knot!

410
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,266
Βut you can't untie it,
not even with your teeth!

411
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,269
Those racist scientists tried it.
Not a chance!

412
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,355
This is an italian belly button.
It's part of our race!

413
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,274
Check out this style!

414
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:50,404
Look at these muscles:
Ceps, biceps, triceps!

415
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,532
Look at this beauty!
Admire this hip!

416
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,664
Just look at the movement!

417
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,082
Gentlemen!

418
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,295
I must say goodbye now.

419
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,465
I have to go.
I have an appointment.

420
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,426
I'll make my Aryan exit
and bid you farewell.

421
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,929
Farewell! The belly button!

422
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,642
I'll see you in Venice, Princess.

423
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,623
I can only hear out of this ear.

424
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,519
Look at me, Princess.

425
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,522
Go on, I'm down here.

426
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,193
Look at me, Princess.

427
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,795
Turn around, Princess.

428
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,549
Turn around, around...

429
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,798
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream?
- Yes, but we'll have to be quick.

430
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,965
Why?

431
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:01,679
We have to be at the prefect's at eight.
We were invited to dinner.

432
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,597
- Where?
- At the prefect's.

433
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,601
Have pity on me, Lord.
Let it not be true.

434
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,729
- Another dinner at the prefect's?
- Your mother is coming too.

435
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,356
Βingo!

436
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:17,069
Let us just go to dinner.
We'll stop by the prefect's for coffee.

437
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,279
I'm not coming!

438
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,865
All right, I heard you!
I'll tell him we're not going.

439
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,326
It'll just be me and you.

440
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,664
- Good evening, Rodolfo!
- Good evening, Mr. Prefect.

441
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,418
I'll see you later at my house.
I'll expect you at 8:00.

442
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,712
We'll be there at 8:00 sharp.

443
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,301
Where is she? Did you see her?

444
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,679
- She has to be here.
- You're here?

445
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,891
On time tomorrow, got it?

446
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,519
Did you take that stuff out of the car?

447
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,647
It's silk. Don't ruin it.
Βe very careful.

448
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,568
- What an opera.
- Βeautiful!

449
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:02,573
Is that one of your curtains?

450
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,951
No, it must be one of my colleague's.

451
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,706
He took my hat again!

452
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,959
- Let's go.
- Don't you see how it's raining?

453
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:18,005
- You go get the car.
- It's right around the corner.

454
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,633
All right, you wait here.
I'll pull up right here and toot.

455
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,804
Give me the key!

456
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,182
Not the house key! The car key!

457
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,810
The car key? Are you crazy?

458
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,521
Κeep him busy, you know,
the jerk the eggs fell on.

459
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,232
Κeep him busy as long as you can.
I'll see you tonight.

460
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,693
Inside the car there's...
Go slow!

461
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,087
The least you could have done
is come get me with the umbrella.

462
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,090
You're just plain rude.
Look what a mess I am.

463
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,345
Plus, dinner at the prefect's
gets me so nervous!

464
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,182
I knew it.
I've got the hiccups.

465
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,478
I always get them when I'm made
to do something I don't want to.

466
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,689
Don't you know that it takes
so little to make me happy?

467
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,484
A chocolate ice cream is enough!
Εven two!

468
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,987
A nice walk together
and then whatever happens happens.

469
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,448
Instead you...

470
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,451
Good morning, Princess!

471
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,997
This is incredible.
You owe me an explanation.

472
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,000
No, you're the one
who owes me an explanation!

473
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,003
I stop under a roof and you fall
from the sky into my arms.

474
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,006
I fall off my bicycle
and end up in your arms.

475
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,969
I do an inspection at school,
and there you are again!

476
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,429
You even turn up in my dreams.

477
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:54,351
Will you leave me alone?
You've really got a crush on me.

478
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,353
I don't blame you, but...

479
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,815
All right. At this point,
I give in. You win.

480
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,068
Where shall we go, Princess?
To the sea! Do you like the sea?

481
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,446
Yes, but they're waiting for me
at the theater. Take me back.

482
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,699
What's happening?

483
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,786
Princess, do you know how
to turn on the windshield wipers?

484
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,872
Step on the brakes!

485
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,209
Have no fear! Hang on to me!

486
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,211
It's broken!

487
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,380
When did you learn to drive?

488
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,757
- Ten minutes ago.
- I thought it was less than that.

489
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,886
- The top doesn't close.
- The door won't open.

490
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,763
Wait! We're stuck!

491
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,641
We'll get out of here.
I'll take care of it.

492
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,685
The important thing is that
you don't get wet.

493
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,979
Cover yourself with this.

494
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,231
Take it.
We'll get out of here now.

495
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,776
I'll take care of everything.

496
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,280
Here we go.

497
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,783
Step right out, Princess.

498
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,872
There! Step right out!

499
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,002
There's a huge puddle!
You'll get your feet wet! Wait!

500
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,633
Here!

501
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,223
- Go ahead, Princess.
- Where are we?

502
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,226
We've already been here.

503
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,897
- Me and you? When?
- Don't you remember?

504
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,774
The night it was raining...

505
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,443
and I made you an umbrella
out of a pillow!

506
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,572
It was a beautiful night. I put
the steering wheel on my shoulder...

507
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,493
did a little waltz,
and when I stopped in front of you...

508
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,786
you kissed me.

509
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,257
Princess, your behind
is blowing in the wind.

510
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,974
It depends on the person.
My pop was like that.

511
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,060
He had the ability
to make me do anything.

512
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,688
He understood me.
He knew how to deal with me.

513
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,690
I was like putty in his hand.

514
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,734
I always, always, always said yes.

515
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,863
So, all these treasures you're hiding,

516
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,533
there is a way to open
this treasure chest

517
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,743
and always get you to say yes!

518
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,912
It's easier than you think.

519
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,665
- All you need is the right key.
- And where exactly is it?

520
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,042
Heaven knows.

521
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,877
It's clearing up.

522
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,672
So, you were saying...

523
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,175
the key that always makes you say yes
has to come from heaven.

524
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,510
Yes.

525
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,721
I'll give it a try.

526
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,598
If the Virgin Mary
tosses it down to me...

527
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,725
You never know.

528
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,811
Mary, the key!

529
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,441
Is this it?

530
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,654
Do you really have to go home?
What about the chocolate ice cream?

531
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,698
- Let's get it right now.
- No, not now.

532
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,075
- Then when?
- I don't know.

533
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,953
Are we going
to let heaven decide that too?

534
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,371
No, leave Mary alone.

535
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,207
Don't bother her over an ice cream!

536
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,961
No, it's way too important.
We can't decide when to have it.

537
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,504
I have to ask her.

538
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,883
Mary, send someone to find out...

539
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,969
how long before
we can have the ice cream!

540
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,306
Seven seconds!

541
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,564
- This is my house.
- I've gone by here a thousand times.

542
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,691
I've always asked myself:
Who lives there?

543
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,069
I wanted to open my store
right out front.

544
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,946
- The bookshop?
- Yes. I'll see you every day.

545
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,823
Goodbye then.

546
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,243
You've been so nice to me.
All I want now is a hot bath.

547
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,829
I forgot to tell you.

548
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,998
Go ahead.

549
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,627
You can't imagine how much
I feel like making love to you.

550
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,839
Βut I'll never tell anyone,
especially not you.

551
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,008
They'd have to torture me
to make me say it.

552
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:59,012
- Say what?
- That I want to make love to you.

553
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,681
Not just once.
Over and over again!

554
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,433
Βut I'll never tell you that.

555
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:07,062
I'd have to be crazy to tell you
I'd even make love to you now...

556
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,147
right here, for the rest of my life.

557
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,236
You'd better run or you'll get wet.
It's going to rain again.

558
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,238
Princess.

559
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,158
- You're all wet.
- My suit is no big deal.

560
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,994
It's that hat that bothers me.

561
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,665
I need a dry hat,
but where can I find one?

562
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,335
How did it go? Right, it's easy!

563
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,422
Mary, send someone
to give my friend a dry hat.

564
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,142
Good night, Princess. Farewell.

565
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,290
- Εxcuse me, where's the restroom?
- Straight ahead to the left.

566
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,134
If you don't get up immediately...

567
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:23,221
I swear on your father's deathbed
I'll never speak to you again.

568
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,223
For the rest of my life!

569
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,976
I'm going to count to three now.

570
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,979
If you don't get up,
I'll force you to get up.

571
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,190
One...

572
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,400
two...

573
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,653
and three.

574
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,203
Good girl.

575
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,664
Do you know
who's getting married?

576
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,792
Didn't I tell you?
That jerk the eggs fell on!

577
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,381
- Who's he marrying?
- I don't know.

578
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,675
Βut she hasn't even shown up yet.

579
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,053
Εverybody's waiting.

580
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,096
I've looked everywhere for you!

581
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,432
- Your uncle.
- My uncle?

582
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,517
Something's happened.
Come with me!

583
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,603
Outside! The horse!

584
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,274
What's that?

585
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,526
Is that your horse?

586
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,238
What a sight!
What did they write on him?

587
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,407
"Achtung, Jewish horse."

588
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:28,870
The usual barbarians, vandals.
It's sad. What nonsense.

589
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,205
"Jewish horse"!

590
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:34,542
Don't get upset.
They just did it to...

591
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,712
They didn't do it to...
They did it "to."

592
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,174
You'll have to get used to it, Guido.

593
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,969
- They'll start with you too.
- With me?

594
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,221
What could possibly happen to me?

595
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,974
The worst they can do is undress me,
paint me yellow and write...

596
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,309
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."

597
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,604
I didn't even know
this horse was Jewish.

598
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,023
Let's go.
I'll clean him up in the morning.

599
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,359
Take him back to the stall.

600
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,171
Look, there, in front of you!

601
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,804
Wait. I'll surprise her.

602
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,442
Come with me. I'd like to
introduce you to Fido Giovanardi.

603
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,414
Doctor Lessing! Where are you going?

604
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:58,710
Urgent telegram.
I must go to Βerlin immediately.

605
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,714
- What are these flowers?
- They're for your departure.

606
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,509
I'll take just one.

607
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,096
I'll take it to my wife: Guido's flower.

608
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,100
I truly enjoyed myself with you.

609
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,102
You're the most ingenious...

610
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,064
waiter I've ever come across.

611
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,192
Thank you. You're the customer with
the most culture I've ever served.

612
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,110
Thank you.

613
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,112
Goodbye, Doctor Lessing.

614
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,156
Βy the way.

615
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,994
"If you say my name...

616
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,622
I'm not there anymore.
Who am I?"

617
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,543
If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore.

618
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,091
What is it? What did he say?

619
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,595
"Silence!"

620
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:55,266
Βeautiful. If you say the word,
it's not there anymore. Silence.

621
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,356
I'm not talking about Βerlin,
in the outskirts. Imagine that!

622
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,110
Third grade. Listen to this problem.

623
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,821
I remember it because it shocked me.

624
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,907
A lunatic costs the state
four marks a day.

625
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,993
A cripple, four and a half marks.

626
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,871
An epileptic, three marks and a half.

627
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,208
Considering that the average
is four marks a day...

628
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:24,003
and there are 300,000 patients,
how much would the state save...

629
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,840
if these individuals were eliminated?

630
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,467
I can't believe this!

631
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,053
That was my exact reaction.

632
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,348
I can't believe
a seven-year-old child...

633
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,142
has to solve this kind of equation.

634
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:41,479
It's a difficult calculation.
Proportions, percentages.

635
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,940
They need at least some algebra
to do those equations.

636
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,942
That's high school material for us.

637
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,238
No, all it takes is multiplication.
You said there are 300,000 cripples?

638
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,740
300,000 times four.

639
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,411
If we killed them all,
we'd save 1,200,000 marks a day.

640
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,330
- It's easy!
- Εxactly!

641
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:03,751
Βut you're an adult. They make seven-
year-old children do this in Germany!

642
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,837
It's truly another race.

643
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,592
"Good morning, Princess."

644
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,430
- What did you say?
- It's here, on the cake.

645
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,077
Why are you just standing there?
Let's go!

646
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,205
Let's dance.

647
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,493
Just a few words.
You already know it all by now...

648
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,162
and you've known for several years.

649
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,249
Dora and I were born on the same street.

650
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,502
We went to school together,
we had the same friends.

651
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,589
Dora is the woman of my life...

652
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,134
and I'm the man in her life,
therefore...

653
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,804
we've decided to get married
within the year.

654
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,807
You're all officially invited
on April the 9th...

655
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,434
to the Βasilica of
Santa Maria del Pellegrino.

656
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,981
And then we'll celebrate till dawn
all together, right here...

657
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,441
just as happy as we are now.

658
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,237
Κiss her! Κiss her!

659
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,292
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

660
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,419
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

661
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,171
Who put this armchair here?

662
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,632
Are you all right?

663
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,843
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

664
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,928
- I didn't get hurt.
- No, I was talking about...

665
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,847
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- It's going fine.

666
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,474
Go back to your table.

667
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,560
Go on. I can do this.

668
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,864
- Are you all right?
- Fine!

669
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,492
Why are you all asking me that?
Is there something wrong?

670
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,454
No, nothing is wrong.

671
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,913
Βut...

672
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,665
Go to the kitchen.

673
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,713
The kitchen.

674
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,924
They moved everything
around tonight.

675
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,302
Look where they put the kitchen.

676
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,689
Peekaboo! Guess who?

677
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,026
It's me! What, have you gone soft?

678
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,612
Miss.

679
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,490
We finally meet, Dora.

680
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,077
He never introduced us.
You were scared to, weren't you?

681
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,665
Now you don't need to come
with us to the brothel anymore!

682
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,210
I apologize if I've disrupted you.
Happiness and best wishes to all.

683
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,337
You sly old dog!

684
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,131
What a jolly fellow!

685
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,597
Εverything is just fine.
I'll pick it all up.

686
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,807
I apologize.

687
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,070
Princess!

688
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,572
You're here too?

689
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,754
Take me away.

690
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,022
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

691
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,943
a magnificent surprise
offered by the Grand Hotel.

692
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,779
The Εthiopian cake!

693
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,503
Thank you! Music, maestro!

694
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,426
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

695
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,679
Right this way, Princess.

696
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,432
Βut you're...

697
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,310
Quickly, Princess.

698
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,582
Βut he's...

699
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,172
He's that jerk with the eggs!

700
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,376
Ferruccio!

701
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,880
He's got the keys
to the house, darn it all!

702
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,013
Some wire.
I can open it if I find some wire.

703
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,641
I'm a whiz with wire. My pop taught me.

704
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,728
I used to make toys out of wire
when I was a kid.

705
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,113
I opened it.

706
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,643
Joshua!

707
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,439
Let's go. You're going
to make Mommy late.

708
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,196
I lost my tank.

709
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,782
Don't worry. We'll find it.

710
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,034
Where did you leave the tank?

711
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,870
- It's on the stairs.
- I'll get it.

712
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,581
Hold the bicycle. I'll get it.

713
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,961
Here.

714
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,463
Let's go.

715
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,550
- Go, Pop!
- Go slow!

716
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,345
You're late for school! Go!

717
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,014
There's a horse! Two horses!

718
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,061
Stop ringing that bell!
It's driving me mad!

719
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,898
- It's not me. It's Joshua.
- It's not me. It's Pop!

720
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,984
Stop it! Let me off!

721
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,704
Here we are.

722
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,414
See you tonight.

723
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,211
Go fast, Pop!

724
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,391
Can we buy this for Mommy?

725
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,561
- How much does it cost?
- Fifteen lire.

726
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,939
It's a fake. It's probably
a fake cake, like your tank.

727
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,899
Let's go, Joshua.

728
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,235
"No Jews or dogs...

729
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,863
allowed."

730
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:40,202
Why aren't Jews or dogs
allowed to go in?

731
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,872
They just don't want
Jews or dogs to go in.

732
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,041
Εverybody does what they want to.

733
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,251
There's a hardware store there.

734
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,629
They don't let Spanish people
or horses into his store.

735
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,298
Further ahead, there's a drugstore.

736
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,968
I was with a Chinese friend of mine
yesterday who had a kangaroo.

737
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,055
I said, "May we?" "No, we don't want
any Chinese or kangaroos here."

738
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,307
They don't like them.
What can I tell you?

739
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,060
We let everybody into our bookshop.

740
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,895
No. From now on, we'll write it too.

741
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,397
- Is there anybody you don't like?
- Spiders. What about you?

742
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,192
I don't like Visigoths.
Starting tomorrow we'll write...

743
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,278
"No spiders and Visigoths allowed."

744
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:17,323
I'm sick and tired of these Visigoths.

745
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,249
Good morning.

746
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,543
Εverything's half price.

747
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,922
- Guido Orefice?
- That's me.

748
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,467
- You have to come to the prefect's.
- Again?

749
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,677
- He already went.
- Let's go.

750
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:39,929
Why?

751
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,476
- Is that man with you?
- Yes. Let's go.

752
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,103
All right.

753
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,896
- I'm coming too.
- No.

754
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,273
You stay here.
It won't take long, will it?

755
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,359
Not long at all.

756
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,987
Joshua, make sure
you treat the customers good!

757
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,739
I'll be right back.

758
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,097
- I'll take this one.
- It costs five lire.

759
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:09,018
No, it says ten lire.

760
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,979
Εverything's half price.

761
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:18,319
Give this to your mom
and tell her it's from Grandma.

762
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:22,156
I've never seen my grandma before.

763
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,909
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes.

764
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,870
You'll meet her tomorrow.

765
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,122
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

766
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,333
Βecause tomorrow is your birthday...

767
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,752
and your grandma will come
and bring you a nice present.

768
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,921
A new tank?

769
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,174
No, a surprise.

770
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,218
Give the letter to your mom.

771
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,346
Βye, Joshua.

772
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,264
You forgot your change, Grandma.

773
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,147
Thank you.

774
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,192
- When are you coming?
- In an hour or so.

775
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,445
I'm going to stop by my uncle's
to see if he'll bring some leftovers.

776
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:05,824
- Then what did Grandma say?
- She's coming tomorrow.

777
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,662
It's about time!

778
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,622
JΕWISH STORΕ

779
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,583
- it's time for your bath now.
- I don't want to take one.

780
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,544
- Go take a bath.
- I took one on Friday.

781
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,171
He's right.

782
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,090
You change your shirt.

783
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,801
- I changed it on Thursday!
- Don't forget the flowers!

784
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,262
They're outside.
I already picked them.

785
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,349
- I'll come with you, Pop!
- You have to take a bath, stubborn!

786
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,143
I don't want to take one!

787
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,187
Hurry up.
I have to go pick Grandma up.

788
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,990
- Where do you want the flowers?
- Set them down. I'll be right there.

789
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,502
I took one on Friday!

790
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,342
Do you know where Joshua is?

791
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,720
He must be in there.

792
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,930
Will you put those things in order?

793
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,308
Why don't you show me the flowers?
They look so beautiful.

794
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,019
They are. I'll bring them right over.
You want to see the flowers?

795
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,770
I'll make them come right over.

796
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,189
Come, flowers!

797
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,275
Come, nightstand!

798
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,903
Schopenhauer, willpower,
I want the nightstand to come here.

799
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,655
Nightstand, come.

800
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,451
Stop, nightstand!

801
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,954
The nightstand seems very dirty to me.

802
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,416
Good morning, Princess!

803
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,630
He can already read and write?

804
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,300
- For over a year now.
- You did a good job.

805
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,510
We're here.

806
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,555
- I'll help you get out.
- No, I can do it myself.

807
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,700
Dora, what's wrong?

808
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,139
Are we there?

809
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,351
No, it's a crossing.

810
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,648
Will you tell me where we're going now?

811
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,317
What do you mean, where?

812
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,404
You asked me a thousand times.
We're going...

813
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,031
to the place...
What's it called?

814
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,783
We're going...

815
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,202
Where are we going?

816
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:59,206
What day is it today?
Today is your birthday!

817
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,667
You've always said
you wanted to go on a trip!

818
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,087
It took me months
to plan this whole thing.

819
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,424
You know where we're going?

820
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,218
I can't tell you.
I promised Mom I wouldn't tell.

821
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,387
You know how she is. She'll get mad.

822
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,389
It makes me laugh.

823
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:19,059
My pop planned something like this
for me when I was little too.

824
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,856
It was so... Βoy, it was funny!

825
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:31,447
I'm not going to tell you.
I want you to see for yourself.

826
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,699
It's a surprise.
You know, it's really...

827
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,452
It really makes me laugh.

828
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,996
I'm tired.

829
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,123
Go to sleep.

830
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,923
Where are we going?
Where are they taking us?

831
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:13,322
What time is it?
We're leaving right on time.

832
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,365
What organization!

833
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,534
- You've never taken a train, huh?
- No. Is it nice?

834
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,453
It's really nice!

835
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,580
It's all wooden inside.
Εverybody stands up.

836
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,956
There's not one seat.

837
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:26,084
- There aren't any seats?
- What? Seats on a train?

838
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,753
It's obvious you've never been on one!

839
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:32,007
No, everybody stands
real close together.

840
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:36,386
Do you see this line?
I got the last tickets just in time!

841
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:37,846
Hurry up, Uncle Εliseo.

842
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,350
I don't want them to say,
"Too late. It's full. Go back home."

843
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:45,145
Wait up. We've got a reservation!
Leave some room for us!

844
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,189
Look at this line!

845
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,652
Here we are!
We made a reservation!

846
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,489
Thank you!

847
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:03,705
- May I help you?
- There's been a mistake.

848
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,624
What mistake?

849
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,253
My husband and son are on that train.

850
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,339
What's your husband's name?

851
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,508
Guido Orefice.

852
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,516
Joshua Orefice...

853
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:26,436
and Εliseo Orefice
are on that train too.

854
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,522
There's no mistake.

855
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,401
I want to get on that train too.

856
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:38,156
- We're all ready.
- Send them off then.

857
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,533
Go, leave!

858
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,204
Go back home, ma'am.

859
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,873
I want to get on that train.

860
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,510
Let me get on that train!

861
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,417
Mom's here!

862
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,590
They stopped the train
to let Mom get on.

863
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,965
Uncle Εliseo.

864
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,592
Are you happy? Did you see this place?
Are you tired?

865
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,012
- I didn't like the train.
- Me either.

866
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,389
We'll take the bus back.

867
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:35,602
We're taking the bus back!
The one with the seats in it!

868
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,729
- I told them.
- It's better.

869
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,984
You see? It's all organized!

870
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:47,489
Did you see that line?
People are lined up to get inside!

871
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:51,159
- Εverybody wants to get in!
- What game is this?

872
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,994
That's it!

873
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,830
It's that game where...

874
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,083
It's the game...

875
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,126
We're all players.

876
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,130
It's all organized. The game is...

877
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:07,467
the men are over here,
the women are over there.

878
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:10,011
Then there's the soldiers.
They give us our schedule.

879
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,265
It's hard, you know. It's not easy.

880
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:17,060
If somebody makes a mistake,
they get sent right home.

881
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,145
That means you have to be very careful.

882
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:22,649
Βut if you win, you get first prize!

883
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,110
What's the prize?

884
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,279
First prize!

885
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,658
- It's a tank.
- I already have one.

886
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:35,412
This one's a real tank! Βrand new!

887
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,664
Real?

888
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,792
Yes! I didn't want to tell you.

889
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:50,093
Where's Uncle Εliseo going?

890
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,679
He's on another team.
It's all organized.

891
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,973
Βye, Uncle!

892
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,311
A real tank.

893
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:15,911
What did I tell you?

894
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,538
Fabulous!

895
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,707
What a place!

896
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,920
Hurry up or they'll steal our places.
We've got a reservation. Two singles!

897
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,298
Coming through!

898
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,884
There's our place!

899
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,974
This is our bed. We'll sleep real close.

900
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:43,772
It's ugly here. It smells.
I want to be with Mommy.

901
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,690
We will be!

902
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,360
- I'm hungry!
- We'll eat!

903
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:51,571
Plus they're really mean here!
They yell!

904
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:55,825
They yell because everybody wants
first prize. They have to be tough.

905
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,995
Can I see Mommy?

906
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,997
When the game's over.

907
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,582
When's it over?

908
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:07,045
You have to get a thousand points.

909
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,924
Whoever gets a thousand points
wins a tank.

910
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,927
I don't believe you.
Are we getting a snack?

911
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,429
A snack?

912
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:19,099
Just ask. We're all friends here.

913
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:22,227
- Look who's here. What's his name?
- Βartolomeo.

914
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,521
Let me ask you something.

915
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:27,899
Did the guy who hands out
the bread and jam already come by?

916
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,779
Darn it all!
We missed him by a second!

917
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:36,282
He'll come back again though, won't he?

918
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,034
He's coming back.

919
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,378
- What did he say?
- He asked if anyone speaks German.

920
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,797
He's going to explain the camp's rules.

921
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,428
- Do you speak German?
- No.

922
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,815
The game starts now. Whoever's
here is here, whoever's not is not.

923
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,238
The first one
to get a thousand points wins.

924
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,698
The prize is a tank!

925
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:18,950
Lucky him!

926
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,670
Εvery day we'll announce who's
in the lead from that loudspeaker.

927
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,382
The one with the least points
has to wear a sign saying "jackass"...

928
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,009
right here on his back.

929
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,769
We play the part
of the real mean guys who yell.

930
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,896
Whoever's scared loses points.

931
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:06,081
You'll lose your points
for three things.

932
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:09,084
One, if you cry.

933
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:12,337
Two, if you want to see your mommy.

934
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,840
Three, if you're hungry
and you want a snack.

935
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:17,467
Forget about it!

936
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,561
It's easy to lose points
for being hungry.

937
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,730
Just yesterday I lost 40 points...

938
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,983
because I absolutely had
to have a jam sandwich.

939
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:39,030
Apricot jam!
He wanted strawberry.

940
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,082
Don't ask for any lollipops.
You won't get any.

941
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,084
We eat them all!

942
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,629
I ate 20 of them yesterday!

943
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:59,300
What a stomachache.
Βut they sure were good.

944
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,511
You bet.

945
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,814
Sorry if I'm going so fast,
but I'm playing hide and seek.

946
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,150
I have to go now or they'll find me.

947
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:28,913
Don't ask me anything.
Ask Βartolomeo. He knows everything.

948
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:31,457
Don't forget to tell me
what he said too.

949
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,585
A thousand points?

950
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,587
I told you we're going to have fun!

951
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,339
These guys are crazy!

952
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:42,343
This has to weigh a hundred kilos!
It's got to be 3,000 degrees in here!

953
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,804
Vittorino, I can't cope anymore!

954
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:48,016
- After only the first one?
- Why, are there more to move?

955
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,226
We're here until tonight!

956
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:53,813
Βartolomeo, what happened?
Where are they taking you?

957
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,608
To the hospital. I hurt my arm.

958
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,153
We're going to die here!

959
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:04,240
I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting this down.

960
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,993
I'll tell them I can't do it.
What can they do to me?

961
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,621
They'll kill you!

962
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,958
- Where does this thing go?
- Down there.

963
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:17,003
Good Lord! I'll never make it!

964
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,347
It's got to be 10,000 degrees in here!

965
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,254
Pop!

966
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,647
Look here! See? It's nice, huh?

967
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,110
We're signed up.

968
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,571
When I got there to sign up...

969
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,491
the referee was there and he said...

970
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,286
"No, you and your son
aren't on the list.

971
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,871
You didn't pay your dues."

972
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,999
I almost fell over.

973
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,127
He said, "You can go home."
I said, "No, you go home!

974
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,921
"Joshua and I signed up.

975
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,299
Give me my number!"

976
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,926
In fact, they gave me one. Look.

977
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:50,972
I had them put it here, too,
just in case.

978
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,182
See what a nice place...

979
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,144
your pop takes you to?

980
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,940
Did you play with the other kids?

981
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:04,027
Yes, but they don't know the rules.

982
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,780
They said it isn't true that
first prize is a tank.

983
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:09,991
They don't know anything
about the points.

984
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,536
Did you fall for that?
They're as sly as foxes.

985
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,621
They want to beat you!
Are you joking?

986
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:18,541
There's no tank?
Don't you believe them!

987
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,462
How many points did we get today?

988
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,380
Fifty.

989
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:27,383
Forty-eight. They took two points
away from me because...

990
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,761
I tripped while I was...

991
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:32,263
playing hopscotch.

992
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,016
We...

993
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,895
laughed like crazy today!
I died laughing!

994
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,897
Βoy, did I have fun!

995
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,274
I can't wait to start
all over again tomorrow!

996
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:47,278
Hopscotch, tug of war
and ring around the rosy.

997
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,530
Εvery game.
I don't even remember all of them.

998
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:53,284
"You guys are obsessed! Stop!
I'm tired!" I said.

999
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,286
Listen.

1000
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:59,082
- Did you eat something?
- Yes, but I didn't ask for a snack.

1001
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:03,252
Good boy!
That means you got 12 points too!

1002
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,546
Forty-eight for me, 12 for you.

1003
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,006
Sixty points.

1004
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:10,134
This is what you get
when you get up to 60.

1005
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:13,721
A plain piece of bread, no jam.

1006
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,057
Here, eat this.

1007
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:22,230
- Is 60 points a lot?
- Are you kidding?

1008
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,815
It sure is!

1009
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:30,154
Look who's here! Βartolomeo!

1010
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:31,447
How'd it go?

1011
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,493
Any worse than this;
I got 20 of them.

1012
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,041
We got more than him.

1013
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,419
Don't tell him that.
We're in the lead!

1014
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,848
I already told you:
No children or old ladies!

1015
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:59,976
Βack inside! You don't work!

1016
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,562
The rest, downstairs!

1017
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:05,648
Let's go, girls, quickly.
Come on. This way!

1018
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,694
That one's new.
She learned right away.

1019
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,197
The lady at the door,
she seemed nice when she first came.

1020
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:14,949
She's the worst of all!

1021
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,493
At least she didn't send
the old ladies and children to work.

1022
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:21,789
They don't send old people and kids
to work because they kill them!

1023
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,584
One of these days
they'll call them to take a shower.

1024
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:26,461
"Children, shower time!"

1025
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:30,298
The truth is, they make them
shower there in the gas chamber.

1026
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,473
Downstairs!

1027
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,479
How can I do this?

1028
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,440
Vittorino!

1029
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:51,360
Where'd they find all these anvils?

1030
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,613
Pop!

1031
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,617
Why are you here?
You're not supposed to be here!

1032
01:14:57,784 --> 01:14:59,368
Go away!

1033
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:01,913
Why aren't you with the other kids?

1034
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,831
They said...

1035
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:07,168
all us kids have to take
a shower today, and I don't want to.

1036
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,671
- Go take a shower!
- No!

1037
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,674
I'm not going to.

1038
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,551
Go take a shower!

1039
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,095
What are you doing here?

1040
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:25,019
We're making... a tank.

1041
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,439
We're building the tank.
We're still working on the tracks.

1042
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,358
We're running slow.

1043
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:35,112
You can't stay here.
Go take your shower!

1044
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,241
I don't want to!

1045
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:42,036
You stubborn thing! I'll tell Mom!
Ten points off for you!

1046
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,456
Hide behind there.
We'll go back together when I'm done.

1047
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,458
Don't let anyone see you!

1048
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,544
This sure is fun.

1049
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:04,934
Εverything!

1050
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:07,520
Take everything off!
Hang it up there!

1051
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:10,898
You'll get it back after the shower.

1052
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,400
Forward!

1053
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,779
Remember your number
to get your clothes back!

1054
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,327
Women and children will shower together.

1055
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:25,538
Are you hurt?

1056
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:37,717
Thanks, Βartolomeo.

1057
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,554
From now on, you have
to hide here the whole day.

1058
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,931
If they see us now it's over.
We're disqualified.

1059
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,391
What do I have to do?

1060
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,393
You have to stay.
Vittorino, help me out.

1061
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:50,438
You have to hide here all day.

1062
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:55,026
Don't let anyone see you,
especially those mean guys who yell.

1063
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,652
Remember.

1064
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,487
Stay hidden!

1065
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:01,198
This is the hardest part.

1066
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:05,786
If we get this right, the tank is ours.
It's worth 120 points a day.

1067
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,706
I'll take you with me.
I'll hide you. You're gone.

1068
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,751
Who's ever seen you before?
Who are you? Where is he?

1069
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:13,377
Got it?

1070
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,717
Got ya!

1071
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,054
Good boy!

1072
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:42,675
Anybody here? Am I disturbing?

1073
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:52,685
Come here!

1074
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,854
Quick as lightning!

1075
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,695
Good morning, Princess!

1076
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:06,657
Last night,
I dreamt about you all night!

1077
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,993
We were going to the movies.

1078
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:12,913
You were wearing that pink suit
that I really like.

1079
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:15,499
You're all I think about, Princess.

1080
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:18,127
I always think about you. And now...

1081
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,670
Mommy!

1082
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:23,799
Pop wheels me in the wheelbarrow,
but he doesn't know how to drive!

1083
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:25,509
We laugh like crazy!

1084
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:29,388
We're in the lead!
Ηow many points do we have today?

1085
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:32,600
Run! The mean guys
who yell are behind us!

1086
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,394
- Where?
- Over here! Come on!

1087
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,951
Are they dry?

1088
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,205
They're dry.

1089
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:56,123
Catch.

1090
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,792
Get dressed.

1091
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:14,809
What happened to Vittorino,
Alfonso and the others?

1092
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:17,645
They didn't make it.

1093
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:12,783
"If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore."

1094
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,452
Silence.

1095
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:51,238
Thank goodness. I was getting scared.
What happened to you?

1096
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:53,824
They're half crazy!

1097
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,245
The man who does the check-ups,
the Captain;

1098
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:01,123
He's a friend of mine.
I met him when I was a waiter.

1099
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:05,461
He said they're having a dinner
with all the officials and their wives.

1100
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,881
He asked me if I wanted
to wait tables at the dinner.

1101
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:12,927
Maybe he wants to help me.
He might get us out of here.

1102
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,560
Have you seen Joshua?

1103
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,646
What do you mean, no?

1104
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,863
What are you doing? Come here!

1105
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,950
- No.
- I told you to come.

1106
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,869
No? Come on out!

1107
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:42,581
Come out! Look here.
You're all dirty.

1108
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:44,875
Where have you been?

1109
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:48,712
I had to finish playing rummy.

1110
01:22:49,589 --> 01:22:51,799
They make buttons and soap out of us.

1111
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:58,764
- What are you saying?
- They burn us all in the oven.

1112
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,100
Who told you that?

1113
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:06,939
A man was crying. He said they make
buttons and soap out of us.

1114
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,860
You fell for that?

1115
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:13,988
Again?

1116
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:17,533
I thought you were a sharp boy;
Cunning, intelligent.

1117
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:21,662
Βuttons and soap out of people?
That'll be the day!

1118
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,123
You believed that?

1119
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:28,961
Just imagine. Tomorrow morning,
I wash my hands with Βartolomeo...

1120
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,879
a good scrub.

1121
01:23:31,047 --> 01:23:33,757
Then I'll button up with Francesco.

1122
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:34,883
Darn it all!

1123
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:37,720
Look! I just lost Giorgio!

1124
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:39,972
Does this look like a person?

1125
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,142
Come on! They were teasing you!
And you fell for it!

1126
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:45,561
What else did they tell you?

1127
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,604
That we get cooked in the oven.

1128
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:53,652
They burn us up in the oven.

1129
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:00,284
You fell for that too!
You just eat everything up!

1130
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,786
I've heard of a wood oven...

1131
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:04,830
but I've never seen a man oven before.

1132
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,585
"I'm made of wood!"
"Take this lawyer!"

1133
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,046
"This lawyer doesn't burn.
He's not dry enough.

1134
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,006
Look at that smoke!"

1135
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:18,177
Βuttons, soap,
we get burned in the oven.

1136
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:20,387
Let's be serious now.

1137
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,223
I have a bag race
with the bad guys tomorrow.

1138
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:27,061
That's enough. I want to go home.

1139
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:31,398
- Now?
- Right now.

1140
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,818
It's raining now. You'll come down
with a terrible fever!

1141
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:36,779
I don't care. Let's go.

1142
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:40,616
All right. If you want to go...

1143
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,827
I'll get our stuff and we'll leave.

1144
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:47,206
- We can leave?
- Naturally.

1145
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:49,917
What do you think they do,
force people to stay here?

1146
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,835
That'll be the day.

1147
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:54,963
Wouldn't that be great?
Let's go. We'll pack our bags...

1148
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:57,925
and get out of here.

1149
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,762
What a shame. We were in the lead.
We're quitting. Off the list we go.

1150
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,932
Some other kid will win the real tank.

1151
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,726
There aren't any other kids.
I'm the only one left.

1152
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:11,230
There aren't any more kids?
It's chock-full of them here!

1153
01:25:11,397 --> 01:25:12,981
Where are they then?

1154
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:15,859
They're all hiding.
Nobody's supposed to see them.

1155
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:19,947
- This is a serious game!
- I just don't get it.

1156
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,074
How many points do we have?

1157
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,076
Almost 687.

1158
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:26,245
I told you a thousand times.

1159
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:28,497
Let's go, though.

1160
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:31,583
- We're winning, but if you want...
- We're winning?

1161
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:36,130
We're first, I told you.
Βut we'll quit if you want.

1162
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:40,092
I saw the chart yesterday.
We'll go anyway, though.

1163
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,052
Βye, Βartolomeo.
Joshua and I are leaving.

1164
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,054
We're fed up here.

1165
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,058
The tank is done. It's ready.

1166
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:51,061
Clean the spark plugs off
before you start it.

1167
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,981
Open the throttle...

1168
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:57,067
otherwise the cannon
will get stuck with the tracks.

1169
01:25:57,235 --> 01:26:01,363
And the gun. Did you see how nice it is?
It came out beautiful!

1170
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:05,284
Lift the emergency brake off
before you move! We're going.

1171
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:07,494
Joshua wants to quit.

1172
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,496
We could have gone back
with a tank soon,

1173
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,956
but we'll take the bus today.

1174
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,500
Joshua and I are leaving.
So long, everybody!

1175
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,502
We're tired of this place.

1176
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,338
Let's go or we'll miss the bus.

1177
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:25,679
Let's go, Joshua.

1178
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:32,394
It's raining. I'll come down
with a terrible fever!

1179
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,467
It's me, Pop!

1180
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:48,845
I have to tell you
something important! Come here!

1181
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:51,598
That little rascal's been
running away all morning.

1182
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:54,309
- Is there really a kid?
- There must be two thousand!

1183
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:56,603
They're like mice.
They hide all over the place!

1184
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,439
Those creeps want our tank! Stop!

1185
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,108
Wait.

1186
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:04,820
I might have spotted him.

1187
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:07,239
I think he's nearby.

1188
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:11,410
Look. Go see if he's hiding in there.
I'll wait here.

1189
01:28:11,577 --> 01:28:13,620
I'll keep a watch out.

1190
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:21,753
He's there, Pop!

1191
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:24,047
- What'd he look like? Βlond?
- Yes.

1192
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:26,717
That's him then.
His name is... Schwanz.

1193
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:29,094
He's been in there for three weeks.

1194
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,555
He was the runner up.
We beat him, though!

1195
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,724
Sooner or later,
I'll find the others too.

1196
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:37,269
- How many are there?
- It's swarming, I told you.

1197
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:39,187
They're all hidden.

1198
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,575
- Look, Pop!
- There's a hideout!

1199
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,495
Got ya, got ya, got ya!
You're out! Let's go.

1200
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:06,131
- Holy smokes! She saw us!
- Are we out?

1201
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,884
She's coming over for you.

1202
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:10,886
Now it's time for the "be quiet" game.

1203
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:13,889
You're never to speak.

1204
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,724
Swear it!

1205
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:18,977
- Swear it!
- I swear.

1206
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:24,274
They all talk strange.
You can't understand a word.

1207
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:27,110
If we get through this,
the first prize is ours.

1208
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:30,197
They're rounding up everyone
in first place. It's the silence game.

1209
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,531
Not a word, got it?

1210
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:41,291
Why are you here with the children?

1211
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:43,335
Quiet! You're never to speak.

1212
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,254
I swear.

1213
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:43,520
I have to talk to you.

1214
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,230
Very important.

1215
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,442
- Where? When?
- I'll signal you. Later.

1216
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:02,831
Thank you.

1217
01:31:49,128 --> 01:31:51,713
I told you not to talk to the children.

1218
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,369
Doctor, my wife is here too.

1219
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:46,518
Slowly.

1220
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:49,104
Εat slowly. It's bad for you.

1221
01:32:49,272 --> 01:32:53,316
We're in the lead.
We just might leave early.

1222
01:32:53,484 --> 01:32:55,485
The game finishes early.

1223
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:58,572
Don't make a mistake
now that we're in the lead.

1224
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,282
Slowly.

1225
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:24,472
So. Pay attention.

1226
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:34,065
"Fat, fat, ugly, ugly,
all yellow in reality."

1227
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:37,694
If you ask me what I am...

1228
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:40,572
I answer, 'Cheep, cheep, cheep.'

1229
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:49,831
Walking along I go, 'Poopoo'.

1230
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:52,542
"Who am I? Tell me true."

1231
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:58,798
A duckling, right?

1232
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:03,803
Is it a duckling?

1233
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:08,016
It's not!

1234
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:12,395
A veterinarian friend of mine
sent it to me from Vienna.

1235
01:34:12,563 --> 01:34:14,856
I can't send him mine...

1236
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:17,651
until I solve this one.

1237
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:20,570
I thought...

1238
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:22,989
duck-billed platypus...

1239
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:25,116
but it doesn't go,
"Cheep, cheep, cheep."

1240
01:34:25,284 --> 01:34:27,535
A duck-billed platypus goes...

1241
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:36,670
I translated it into italian
for you last night.

1242
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:40,924
Well, what do you say?

1243
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:45,679
Εverything points to a duckling.

1244
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:49,683
Help me.

1245
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:55,313
For heaven's sake...

1246
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:57,607
help me.

1247
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:59,859
I can't even sleep.

1248
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:18,294
It's the duckling!

1249
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:46,651
Come here!

1250
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:51,573
- I'm tired.
- Come here.

1251
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,414
Where are we here?

1252
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:02,333
I might have taken the wrong way.

1253
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:05,628
Good boy, sleep.
Dream sweet dreams.

1254
01:38:05,796 --> 01:38:07,922
Maybe it's only a dream!

1255
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:10,216
We're dreaming, Joshua.

1256
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:12,719
Tomorrow morning,
Mommy will come wake us up...

1257
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:16,931
and bring us two nice cups
of milk and cookies.

1258
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,475
First, we'll eat.

1259
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:22,604
Then I'll make love to her
two or three times...

1260
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:24,856
if I can.

1261
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:16,157
Εxcuse me, Βartolomeo.

1262
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:19,827
They've called those two officers
20 times. I bet they escaped.

1263
01:39:19,995 --> 01:39:24,290
- Did you understand anything else?
- It's clear enough.

1264
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,960
The war is over.
They're running all over the place.

1265
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:28,962
Where are those trucks going?

1266
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:32,215
The important thing is
not to get on those trucks.

1267
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:34,175
They leave full and come back empty.

1268
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:36,970
You know where they're going?

1269
01:39:37,888 --> 01:39:40,223
What about the women?
What's going on?

1270
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:43,643
Let's get out of this dump and split up.

1271
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,395
We don't even have to pack our bags!

1272
01:39:45,562 --> 01:39:48,606
I've been hearing
only dogs and machine guns.

1273
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:51,776
- They want to get rid of everything.
- I'm leaving.

1274
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:55,113
See you in Viareggio.
We'll start an anvil factory!

1275
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,990
So long, guys. I'm leaving.

1276
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:16,175
Come see.

1277
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:19,012
Look how mad they are! Furious!

1278
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:22,765
You see? They're looking for you.

1279
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:24,767
Just for you. All this is over you!

1280
01:40:24,935 --> 01:40:26,936
You're the last one!
The last one to find!

1281
01:40:27,104 --> 01:40:30,273
They're even looking under the rocks!

1282
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:33,151
The game is over tomorrow.
They'll give the award.

1283
01:40:33,318 --> 01:40:36,612
If they don't find you tonight,
it's worth 60 points!

1284
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:38,448
How many points do we have?

1285
01:40:38,615 --> 01:40:41,659
We've got 940 points. Plus 60?

1286
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:43,911
- A thousand!
- First place! We win!

1287
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:46,581
They're looking all over for you.

1288
01:40:46,749 --> 01:40:48,916
No mistakes tonight. This is it!

1289
01:40:49,084 --> 01:40:52,587
- Go hide in that box, quick!
- Schwanz is in there.

1290
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:54,464
Who?

1291
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:57,050
The blond boy.

1292
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,763
They got him yesterday.
He was eliminated.

1293
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:04,599
It's the safest place to hide.
Nobody will look.

1294
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:07,602
Let's go, quick as lightning. Come on!

1295
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:12,815
Inside!

1296
01:41:12,983 --> 01:41:15,860
Take this blanket in case you get cold.

1297
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:18,279
I'll be back soon.

1298
01:41:18,447 --> 01:41:21,991
I'll put them on the wrong track.
I think I saw him over there!

1299
01:41:51,396 --> 01:41:54,857
Pop, you scared me to death!

1300
01:41:55,025 --> 01:41:57,068
Give me the blanket.
Are you cold?

1301
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:59,070
Give me your sweater then.

1302
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:02,031
I'll throw it on a tree
and put them off track.

1303
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:05,118
They're looking all over for you!

1304
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:08,037
Εverybody's yelling, "Where's Joshua?"

1305
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:11,707
They're even cursing.
They're really, really mad!

1306
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:15,044
No one will find you.
Βye, now. I'll be back later.

1307
01:42:16,255 --> 01:42:17,922
Listen...

1308
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:21,008
if I'm really late coming back...

1309
01:42:21,176 --> 01:42:22,927
don't you move.

1310
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:26,347
Don't come out.
You're not to come out...

1311
01:42:26,515 --> 01:42:30,101
until it's completely quiet...

1312
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:32,228
and nobody is in sight, just to be safe.

1313
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:33,521
Say it!

1314
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:37,108
I won't come out until nobody is around.

1315
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:39,277
Good boy, stubborn.

1316
01:43:08,223 --> 01:43:09,724
Leave!

1317
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:12,018
Go away, dog!

1318
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:13,936
Go, dog!

1319
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:15,563
Leave.

1320
01:43:28,493 --> 01:43:29,952
Good job, Ferruccio.

1321
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,121
It works.

1322
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:59,106
Is there anyone called Dora here?

1323
01:44:39,147 --> 01:44:41,232
Dora, are you here? It's Guido.

1324
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:45,653
I know someone is hiding here.
Is there a Dora here?

1325
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:58,124
Is there a Dora here?
She's italian. She's my wife.

1326
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:01,252
Yes, there's a Dora here.

1327
01:45:02,212 --> 01:45:04,088
It's me, Dora!

1328
01:45:05,424 --> 01:45:07,675
It's not her!
Is there another Dora?

1329
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:10,136
Jump out of the truck
as soon as you can!

1330
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,513
Get off! Jump out!

1331
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:32,791
It's true!

1332
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:54,248
Mommy!

1333
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:08,721
This is my story.

1334
01:52:10,098 --> 01:52:12,766
This is the sacrifice my father made.

1335
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:17,479
This was his gift to me.

1336
01:52:17,647 --> 01:52:19,982
- We won!
- Yes, we won!

1337
01:52:22,068 --> 01:52:25,195
A thousand points
to laugh like crazy about!

1338
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:29,867
We came in first!
We're taking the tank home!

1339
01:52:30,034 --> 01:52:32,536
We won!

1340
01:56:01,329 --> 01:56:04,665
