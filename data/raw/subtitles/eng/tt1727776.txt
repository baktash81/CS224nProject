1
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,507
Mind if I do a quick mop?

2
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,009
You're shouting.

3
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,176
What?

4
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,182
- I can come back later.
- No, it's fine.

5
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:21,601
Just don't touch anything.

6
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,397
"Just don't touch anything."

7
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,523
Dickbreath.

8
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:30,360
You want a Tic Tac?

9
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:34,781
All right. I'll take that as a no.

10
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:51,882
Oh. Come on.

11
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,284
Oh...

12
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:23,747
What the hell happened to you, dude?

13
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:35,175
Dod? What the fuck
kind of name is Dod?

14
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:38,095
Oh!

15
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:45,352
Go, go, go, go, go.

16
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,522
Come on!

17
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,529
No! Oh, no, no, no. Reset, reset.

18
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:58,115
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

19
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:00,117
Dod! Come on!

20
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,204
Clear! Accept! Accept the motherfucker!

21
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:06,540
Shit. Okay. All right.

22
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:07,958
Um...

23
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,961
I'll do CPR. Yeah.

24
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:23,181
All right! Some Takis Fuego.

25
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,228
Come on!

26
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,315
Come on, breathe, dude!

27
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,197
Oh, shit! Oh, hell, no.

28
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:42,909
Okay. All right. All right. Come on, Dod.

29
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:44,286
Come on. We got this.

30
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,837
Please, come on, Dod!

31
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:55,505
One, one thousand!

32
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,882
Two, one thousand!

33
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:58,967
Ah!

34
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:21,198
No, no, no!

35
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:23,700
No, no, no!

36
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,871
Come on.

37
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,083
Ah!

38
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,563
You are kidding me.

39
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:06,743
Oh, crap.

40
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:23,593
Why?

41
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,890
<i>You know
what's cooler than cool?</i>

42
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,459
<i>Scouting!</i>

43
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:57,627
Action!

44
00:06:57,794 --> 00:07:00,380
Hi, there, guys.
My name is Scout Leader Rogers.

45
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,551
And I'm here to show you
what scouting is all about. Come...

46
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:07,804
<i>Being a Scout is about
the bonds of friendship.</i>

47
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
<i>Check it out!</i>

48
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:15,186
<i>These Scouts are on their way
to earning a Bow and Arrow Badge!</i>

49
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:19,649
<i>Badges are the Scouts'
highest symbol of achievement.</i>

50
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,486
<i>Scouts can earn all sorts of badges.</i>

51
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:27,490
<i>What's cooler than cool?</i>

52
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,492
<i>Scouting!</i>

53
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:36,333
All right, are you in or are you in?

54
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,180
Hey, listen, there's free
cookies every Friday.

55
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:47,844
We do sing-alongs on Saturdays.

56
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:49,846
It looks great on a college application!

57
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,433
I love this tragic ritual.

58
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,769
Someone's gonna sign up, guys!

59
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,020
We have to keep trying!

60
00:07:57,354 --> 00:07:59,648
Augie, a unicorn's
gonna fly out of your ass

61
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:01,024
before somebody joins.

62
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:02,942
Carter! Language.

63
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:04,402
Yeah, he's right.
Nobody's ever gonna sign up.

64
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:05,779
It's just a waste of time.

65
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:08,406
Ye of little faith.
Where's that Scout spirit?

66
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:10,992
Look, guys, we're not gonna
quit trying just because

67
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,161
we lost a couple hours
sitting around on our butts

68
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,454
with nothing to show for it.

69
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:17,082
I mean, some people
spend their entire lives

70
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,292
and have nothing to show for it.

71
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,296
Well...

72
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,924
I think we all know
it's Augie's special night.

73
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:31,346
After years of hard work and dedication,

74
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,641
he will receive the highest
honor of a Scout,

75
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,059
the Condor Badge,

76
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:38,395
in a ceremony at tonight's campout.

77
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,563
Okay. Let's see.

78
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:42,315
Latrine duty: Carter.

79
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,192
No! No, no, no, no.
I always dig the shitter.

80
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,755
It's called a latrine, not a shitter.

81
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,196
All right, Ben, you're on wiener duty.

82
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:50,407
That's enough.

83
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,326
Carter, nobody eats a hot dog like this.

84
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:58,081
All right. Ben, why don't you
lead us in the Scout Oath?

85
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:00,041
- Come on.
- All right.

86
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,337
This do I swear:

87
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:07,090
To live courageously,

88
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,050
to help others when I can,

89
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:12,846
defend what I must, so help me God.

90
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,431
Scouts forever!

91
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:15,849
Scouts forever!

92
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,600
Scouts forever.

93
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,686
Scouts forever.

94
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:21,354
Forever!

95
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,569
Ben, we have to tell Augie.

96
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,028
- I know. I know.
- We're ditching Scouts.

97
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:30,155
Yeah, we'll tell him.

98
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:31,364
We've been talking
about it for over a year.

99
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:33,199
I know.
We just have to find the right time.

100
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:34,784
Okay, we'll do it tonight, then.

101
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:36,786
No, we can't tell him tonight.
He's getting his Condor Badge.

102
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:39,706
He's been working toward this
ever since he joined Scouts.

103
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:41,458
You know how much it means to him.

104
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,377
Especially since his dad can't be there.

105
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:47,255
It's been two years, Ben.

106
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,800
We can't just stay in Scouts
because we feel sorry for him.

107
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:52,761
Come on, that's not the only
reason we're staying in Scouts.

108
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:53,887
Come on, you've had fun.

109
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,765
Had fun, okay? Past tense. Had.

110
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,642
And now I am ready to move on.
I mean, you realize

111
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:01,561
it's gonna be junior year next year.

112
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,605
I mean, you know
what that means, right?

113
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:05,064
We start thinking about college.

114
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:08,067
We start thinking about pussy, Ben!

115
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,904
Come on. Junior year is when
all the girls become sluts.

116
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:11,988
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

117
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:14,991
And if we're sitting here
in these Scout uniforms,

118
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,327
it's gonna be
the male version of a chastity belt, Ben.

119
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,334
Oh, shit. Shit.

120
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,711
What the fuck was that?

121
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,422
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

122
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:35,762
Oh, shit.

123
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,806
Dude, that scared the shit out of me.

124
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,432
Yeah, me, too.

125
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:41,518
No, like, literally,
a little shit came out.

126
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:42,936
Dude, stop.

127
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:48,358
Jesus Christ. You hood-fucked Bambi.

128
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,276
I didn't mean to!
It wasn't my fault, Carter!

129
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,861
It was just standing there!

130
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,542
Oh, shit.

131
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,377
Oh. Damn it.

132
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:10,129
Great. Just awesome.

133
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:13,633
Is that a spare for your bike or the car?

134
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,553
Shit. My dad's gonna be so pissed.

135
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:18,888
Carter, where are the other lug nuts?

136
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,807
How should I know?
I've been sitting here doing nothing.

137
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,225
Yeah. I noticed.

138
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:26,646
Oh. Dude, that's my sister.

139
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:29,148
Kendall! Kendall!

140
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,484
Hey!

141
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:35,613
Hey.

142
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,157
Can you help us?

143
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:57,385
- Catch!
- Ow!

144
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,845
- Jeff!
- What?

145
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,013
I said, "Catch."

146
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,514
I thought he had it.

147
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:03,850
- Sorry, bro. It's my bad.
- Yeah.

148
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,102
Are you guys okay?
I mean, what happened?

149
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,855
We hit a white-tailed deer. It was huge.

150
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,773
Yeah. We were just driving,
and then it was like, boom!

151
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:13,192
You guys hit a deer? That's awesome.

152
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,612
Nope, not awesome. Are you kidding?

153
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,447
Nothing awesome about it.
Look at my car.

154
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:21,868
What's up, Chloe?

155
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,370
- Hey...
- Hey.

156
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,039
- Carter.
- Carter!

157
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:28,708
Yeah. I sit behind you in Spanish class.

158
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:31,753
Oh, <i>gracias.</i>

159
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,464
So, I'm really down with this

160
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:36,049
whole little Scout uniform
you guys got going.

161
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:37,342
All these little patches and stuff.

162
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:40,094
Actually, Ben and Carter have been

163
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:42,472
Scouts together since, what,
you were like six, right?

164
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,849
- Yeah, yeah. A long time.
- That's awesome, man.

165
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:46,559
Ben's like my little brother.

166
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,478
Yep. That's me. Little brother Ben.

167
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:49,896
Hey, Jeff!

168
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,573
All right, well.
Sorry about that face again.

169
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,320
Hey, are you going to the party tonight?

170
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:58,404
What's up?

171
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:02,325
Yo! Aber-blow-me and Bitch, man.
What's up? Hey.

172
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,493
Always coming up with good ones.

173
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,912
Listen, I was just talking
to Carver here, and...

174
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:07,080
Carter.

175
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,290
- I came up with a great idea.
- Really?

176
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:10,583
Hit me. What do we have?

177
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,335
How'd recruiting go?

178
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:15,588
Oh, the usual. Yeah, no one joined.

179
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:17,090
I think it's just a big joke at this point.

180
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:18,257
It's not a joke.

181
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,927
I think it's really cool
you guys have stuck with Scouts.

182
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,221
One day you're gonna look back on this

183
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,181
and you're gonna be
really happy you did it.

184
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:28,017
Okay. Thanks.

185
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:35,441
Looks like the deer made out
better than your car.

186
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,777
Yeah. Wait, what? What do you mean?

187
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:39,988
Well, where is it?

188
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,739
It's right over there.

189
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,644
Holy shit! Holy shit, man!

190
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:13,229
You dick. What's wrong with you?

191
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,815
Dude. Dude, okay. You're never
gonna believe what happened.

192
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,498
Hey, you sure you guys
don't need a ride?

193
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:19,694
No, we're good.

194
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:20,820
See you boys tonight.

195
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,739
Hey! See you tonight, man!

196
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:24,991
All right? All right?

197
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:29,078
Bye, Chloe! Bye!

198
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:31,686
What are you talking about, tonight?

199
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:33,499
Dude, you are never going
to guess what happened.

200
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,627
We got invited to the secret
senior party, man. Look.

201
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,422
Who cares? Look, the deer is gone.
What about the deer?

202
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,757
Dude, fuck deers, man!

203
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,177
We are going to the secret party, man!
Come on!

204
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,345
I'm gonna fuck Chloe.

205
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,598
I'm gonna fuck Chloe.

206
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,438
Ben, come on.
This is the chance of a lifetime.

207
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,315
Okay. I mean,
quit acting like you don't want to go.

208
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,858
Of course I want to go. I do.

209
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,361
But it's Augie's big night.
He's getting his Condor Badge.

210
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,530
We can't miss the ceremony
or he'd never forgive us.

211
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,699
Okay, look, hear me out.

212
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:08,409
We go to the campout,

213
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,495
and when Augie and Rogers fall asleep,

214
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,288
we will sneak out and go to the party.

215
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,372
Carter...

216
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:14,496
We'll be back before dawn,

217
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,334
it'll be like we never even left.

218
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:19,087
I don't know. It just sounds...

219
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,171
Ben.

220
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,800
This could be the night of our lives.

221
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:26,052
Please.

222
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,473
All right. I mean, I guess we could try.

223
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,018
- Okay.
- I love you.

224
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:36,229
You're amazing. Thank you!

225
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:37,647
Whoa! What the hell?

226
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:39,816
Hi, Mrs. Fielder. Hi.

227
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,904
Your garbage cans were
blocking my driveway again.

228
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,240
Had to move them myself,

229
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:50,576
which is no easy task
with a herniated disk.

230
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,661
Okay, great.

231
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:56,249
You tell your father to keep his trash
on his side of the property.

232
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,627
Okay, we'll do that, Mrs. Fielder.
Thank you.

233
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,589
All right, thanks. Yep.
Can you just move right there?

234
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:05,508
Thank you. Bye!

235
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,343
Jesus Christ.

236
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,679
You old hag! Okay. Thank you.

237
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,097
She is so annoying.

238
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:14,684
Oh, my God.
Can you imagine living next to that?

239
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,895
Oh, my God. Dude,
how many cats does she have?

240
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:20,481
Dude, who knows. She probably rubs
Fancy Feast on her cooch

241
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:21,941
and lets them all go to town.

242
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,025
What?

243
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:26,571
Meet me here at 5:30 and then
we'll go to Camp Womp Womp.

244
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,781
Then we'll go to the party. All right?

245
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:30,449
- All right? All right.
- All right.

246
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:31,617
See you soon, man.

247
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:32,702
All right. See ya.

248
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,046
Oh, litterbugs.

249
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,339
Come on.

250
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:50,469
Biotine?

251
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,223
How'd you get way out here?

252
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,560
Well, Peter Morris, finders keepers.

253
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,734
Hello?

254
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:11,574
Hello?

255
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,600
What's wrong with you?

256
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:39,560
You A-wipe!

257
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,355
C-word! All the other words!

258
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,274
Oh, doodle!

259
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,901
That's my lucky knife!

260
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:06,379
Teach you to mess
with Scout Leader Rogers!

261
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,353
So we're just gonna
walk in there like this.

262
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,355
No I.D.'s, just buy some beer?

263
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,940
Just give me the $20, fool. Come on.

264
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,900
Cough it up.

265
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,944
Any day now. Come on.

266
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,779
Hang on. It's Velcro. It takes a second.

267
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:33,906
Watch a pro.

268
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:40,121
Hi, sir. How are you today?

269
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,372
Hey, baby.

270
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,333
Oh, nice. Great plan, Carter.

271
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:47,253
Just give the money to a drunk bum.
That'll work.

272
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,172
Yeah!

273
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:52,008
Just the cheap stuff.

274
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,808
Did you see Officer Hottie?

275
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,227
No. I was too busy
watching you lose 20 bucks.

276
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,854
Okay, I gave him
very specific instructions.

277
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:06,647
He's gonna buy us a couple of six packs,

278
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,441
and he can keep the change.

279
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,026
Jesus.

280
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:12,278
Whoa.

281
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:15,323
Holy shit, dude. That's her.

282
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,033
What? Who?

283
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:19,035
It's Denise What's-her-face.

284
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:20,244
She went to our high school.

285
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:21,728
She dropped out a couple years ago.

286
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,081
Now she's a stripper.

287
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:25,291
How do you even know that?

288
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,709
She's a legend.

289
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,047
What the fuck is he... Jesus Christ.

290
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,384
Sir!

291
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,889
I'm not paying for these items.

292
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:41,891
Sir?

293
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:46,395
- Shit!
- Oh, uh...

294
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,566
It's okay. I got it. Seriously, I got it.

295
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,488
Fucking ghetto-ass bag.

296
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,739
Here.

297
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,909
What are you doing?

298
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,620
It's a sheet bend knot.

299
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:03,788
It's impossible to break.

300
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,872
You're pretty handy.

301
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,749
Thanks.

302
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:07,833
Get out.

303
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,251
- Nice legs.
- Huh?

304
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:11,837
Costume party?

305
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,422
Oh, no, I'm...

306
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,257
I'm a Scout.

307
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,759
Like an actual Scout?

308
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,322
Yeah, well. We got a campout tonight.

309
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:21,597
So you work across the street?

310
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,016
Yep. Glamorous, huh?

311
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,435
Yeah. I mean, I've never been in,

312
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,270
but I hear it's nice.

313
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,439
It's got a good Yelp review.

314
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:33,025
- What?
- Nothing.

315
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,469
You're just... You're really cute.

316
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:36,612
Thanks.

317
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,697
Come on, Carter.

318
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:41,200
Please tell me
you did not ask that guy to buy you beer.

319
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,284
No, it was his idea.

320
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:43,619
Rookies.

321
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,371
Where are you...

322
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,747
I need my $20 back.

323
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:48,666
It's not all yours.

324
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,128
You're dirty. Look how dirty...

325
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:58,884
Here.

326
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:00,344
Thank you.

327
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,475
Thank you. Here.

328
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:08,310
Oh, my God. Thank you.

329
00:21:08,394 --> 00:21:10,646
You're the most amazing person ever.
Thank you.

330
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:11,981
Yeah. Thanks.

331
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:14,442
It's cool. And thanks for the help, Legs.

332
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,526
Yeah.

333
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,571
Dude, what the fuck was that?

334
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:19,864
Oh, my God.

335
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,825
I would tongue-pound
her salty walrus any day of the week.

336
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,077
Oh, shit.

337
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:26,745
- He's staring at us.
- Go.

338
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,433
Dude, I thought you said
that Kendall broke up with that Jeff guy.

339
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:35,171
Dude, I thought so too.

340
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:36,922
It's like, one moment, they're together

341
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:39,425
and the next moment, they're broken up.

342
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:40,843
So he's a dick.

343
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,601
It's like no doubt...

344
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:49,810
Hey, guys!

345
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:50,936
Hey, what's up?

346
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,355
All right. Campsite is halfway set up.

347
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,440
- Nice.
- Great.

348
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:55,941
- What's up?
- What's up?

349
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,151
What's up?

350
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,028
Oh! Too slow. Too slow, buddy.

351
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,321
Where's Scout Leader Rogers?

352
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,780
He was supposed to be
here to help me set up,

353
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:03,032
but so far he's a no-show.

354
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:06,118
That's weird. He's never late.

355
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:08,287
Yeah. Maybe he quit Scouts.

356
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:11,790
Quit Scouts? Yeah, right.

357
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,375
That's hysterical!

358
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:15,461
Want to know what I think it is?
I think it's a test.

359
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:16,629
A test?

360
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,672
Well, yeah.
I'm getting my Condor Badge today.

361
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:20,633
I have to prove that I'm ready.

362
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,051
Yeah, and check this out.

363
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,894
I'm charting diets for
the Animal Study Badge

364
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,221
and I walked right into that.

365
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,139
- What is this?
- It's deer scat.

366
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,893
Oh, dude! What the fuck, man?

367
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:32,645
Carter! I needed that!

368
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:34,480
You needed that? It's shit, Augie!

369
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,148
No one needs shit!

370
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:37,900
I need it!
I've been looking all week for it.

371
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,944
Oh, God. It's gonna be a long night.

372
00:22:41,946 --> 00:22:43,739
Just feeding it through, in and out.

373
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,241
Oh, yeah.

374
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,076
There you go.

375
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,328
- Good job, bud.
- I did it!

376
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,867
What the fuck, man?
Was that your ass?

377
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,357
Beans? Weenies?

378
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,401
Why do we always
have to eat welfare food?

379
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,278
Because we're camping, Carter.
What do you want?

380
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,405
Something artisan.
Something that doesn't make me

381
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,073
fart every five seconds.

382
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:09,491
Shut up. Quit being such a bitch.

383
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,328
Augie? Augie?

384
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:14,330
Hey, Augie!

385
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:15,414
Use my lighter.

386
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:18,042
I'm not gonna get my Fire Making Badge
using a lighter, Carter.

387
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,251
- Just use it.
- No!

388
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:20,919
- Why?
- 'Cause!

389
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:22,004
Augie.

390
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:26,342
Augie, just use it.
You can get it next time.

391
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:33,098
What the fuck?
Why the hell can't I get service?

392
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,350
Carter, we're in the woods.

393
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,976
I always get service up here.

394
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,269
Maybe Mother Nature wants you

395
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:39,772
to put the phone away, Carter,
and be in the moment.

396
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,441
Oh, is that what Mother Nature wants?

397
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,193
Maybe Mother Nature wants this.

398
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:50,115
Fucking bull's-eye, man!

399
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,950
You're an asshead, Carter.

400
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:54,328
Wait! No, no, no, no! Don't take it off.

401
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,205
Here we go. Wait. Hold still.

402
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,291
Hold still. Ready? Say, "marshmallow."

403
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,710
Carter sucks donkey balls.

404
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,129
Wow.

405
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:05,964
That's a thing of beauty.

406
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,633
You better not post that.

407
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,636
I'm definitely posting that.
It's my masterpiece.

408
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,554
All right. BRB, guys. I got to pee.

409
00:25:17,393 --> 00:25:18,435
Barn owl?

410
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,813
I think it's a spotted owl.

411
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:23,232
Yeah, you're probably right.

412
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:24,858
Hey.

413
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:28,654
Guess what I found
when I was hiking up here?

414
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,614
I found the tree
we carved our initials into.

415
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:31,907
- No way!
- Yeah.

416
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,991
- Really?
- Yeah.

417
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:34,827
Wow. That was like seven years ago.

418
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,162
I know. Crazy, right?

419
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,039
Oh. That was the same day
Carter sat on the cactus

420
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:40,999
when he was taking a shit, right?

421
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,541
And your dad had to pick out
the needles.

422
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,172
Yeah.

423
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,267
Augie, I know we don't talk
about your dad much,

424
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,020
but it's okay if you want to.

425
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,191
I just don't want to be
a downer, you know.

426
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,776
Come on, Augie,
you're not being a downer.

427
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,027
He was your dad.

428
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,113
You can talk about him.

429
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:14,116
Thanks, Ben.

430
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,452
Yeah. Of course.

431
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:19,788
Hey.

432
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:22,499
Scouts forever?

433
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,128
Yeah. Scouts forever.

434
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,394
Ben. Hey.

435
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:43,729
Come on, Ben. Let's go.

436
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,230
Carter, I don't know about this.

437
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:46,690
Will you stop crying about this?

438
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,734
Let's go. Come on, we're doing this.

439
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,069
Let's go. Come on.

440
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:52,196
Come on.

441
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,454
Are we interrupting?

442
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:46,959
You look amazing.

443
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,043
Thank you.

444
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,378
Hey, have you guys seen my brother?

445
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:50,963
He should have been here by now.

446
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,799
No. I haven't seen him anywhere, no.

447
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,176
But look,
I'm sure he'll be here any second. Okay?

448
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,557
Dude. What if Augie wakes up
and we're not there?

449
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,808
He's not gonna wake up.

450
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,060
If Chewbacca was fucking
Bigfoot in our campsite,

451
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,895
he'd still be asleep.

452
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,105
Whoa.

453
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,232
- What is that?
- What?

454
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,735
Look. Look, he was here.

455
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,029
Okay. So, he decided to go back home.

456
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,114
He changed his mind.

457
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:20,075
No, no, no. Scout Leader Rogers
would never leave his lucky knife.

458
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,410
I think something's wrong.

459
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,121
Dude, what's wrong
is us sitting here talking about this.

460
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,455
Give me that.

461
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,666
Dude, look. Look at his prints.

462
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,085
His foot was dragging like
he had a limp or something.

463
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,754
Okay.
Hurray for your mad tracking skills.

464
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:35,007
Can we just... Can we go? Please?

465
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:44,808
What?

466
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,268
I just think something
really bad happened to him.

467
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,604
- Are we still talking about Rogers?
- Yeah.

468
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,939
Dude, he is sitting at home
dressed up like Dolly Parton

469
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,691
singing show tunes. Relax.

470
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:58,447
Oh, shit.

471
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,618
Augie, wait! Augie!

472
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:03,869
Augie!

473
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,027
I thought we were best friends.

474
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,165
We are best friends.

475
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,125
- We were coming back.
- Really?

476
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,668
After your party?

477
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,379
You know about that?

478
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:15,839
Everybody knows about
the senior party, Carter.

479
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:17,215
Even a loser like me.

480
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:18,342
Augie, don't say that.

481
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,718
Why not? It's what you guys think!

482
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,386
We don't think you're a loser.

483
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,221
Ben, just tell him.

484
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,306
Carter, no.

485
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:25,974
Yeah, tell me, Ben.

486
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,226
Come on! Say it!

487
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,790
We're quitting Scouts, Augie.

488
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,525
Look, it was fun when we were kids.

489
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,864
But we have to grow up, man.

490
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:44,743
Augie. We're still gonna be best friends.

491
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,830
Go to your party.

492
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:52,000
Augie.

493
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:53,627
Augie, wait!

494
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,171
Augie, come on!

495
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:01,343
Just leave him, Ben.

496
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,275
What the fuck...
What's wrong with the radio?

497
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,610
Carter, are you seeing this?

498
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:19,778
Seeing what?

499
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:22,197
Look. The town's deserted.

500
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,367
Everyone's probably asleep.

501
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,868
On a Friday night?

502
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,956
I don't know.
Something just feels really weird.

503
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,457
Oh, hey. Pull over right here.

504
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:40,382
I can't wait to get out of
these stupid uniforms.

505
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,384
All right. Let's see here.

506
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:45,971
We're just gonna change right here?

507
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,389
Nobody's around.

508
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:51,643
Let's see. Jeans. T-shirt.

509
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:54,730
Condoms. Good to go. Uh...

510
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:57,816
Forget socks? Yes, I did.

511
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,324
- Holy shitballs!
- What?

512
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,576
Dude, look.

513
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:08,744
What?

514
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:10,203
The bouncer, he's gone!

515
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,330
Carter, someone smashed the door.

516
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:13,665
We should sneak in.

517
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,584
- That's illegal.
- Let's sneak in. Come on. Let's do it.

518
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,827
Carter, we can't go in there!

519
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:17,919
Come on!

520
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,171
We can't go in there.
We're minors.

521
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:20,505
It's the chance
of a lifetime. Who cares?

522
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:21,631
What are you doing?

523
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,175
It's gonna be awesome!

524
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,427
Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.

525
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,848
Okay, it's clear. Come on. Let's do it.

526
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:34,436
Sweet Jesus.

527
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,938
This is it, Ben.

528
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:38,398
We've made it.

529
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,358
We're at the epicenter of pussy.

530
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,695
Oh, shit.
I got to go to the ATM, get some cash.

531
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,447
You find us a spot.

532
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,701
Yeah. That shouldn't be too hard
since there's, like, nobody here.

533
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:24,754
Hey!

534
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,883
My friend brought me here.
He's getting money.

535
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,304
I have a girlfriend, sort of.

536
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:35,557
Don't worry, Mommy, Daddy's here!

537
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:39,811
Dude, this is fucking awesome!

538
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:41,146
Dude, something's wrong with her.

539
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,690
Look at her chest. What's all over her?

540
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,735
No, no. That's makeup, dummy.
It's a jungle theme.

541
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,446
Oh, wow.

542
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:51,323
This is so hot.

543
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,409
Oh, my God.

544
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,161
Oh, my God.

545
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:00,665
Oh, my God!

546
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:07,839
Run! Quick, run!

547
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,259
Door, door, door, door!

548
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,169
Ugh!

549
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,362
Get up! Get up! Get up!

550
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,785
- Carter!
- Ben? Ben.

551
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,371
What the fuck is going on?

552
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:04,622
I don't know! They're trying to kill us!

553
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:06,875
- I just wanted to see some titties!
- I know!

554
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,294
Wait. You're the stripper.

555
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:11,588
Cocktail waitress.

556
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,065
Scout Leader Rogers?

557
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:39,240
Scout Leader Rogers, are you home?

558
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,835
Hello?

559
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:12,857
Holy cow.

560
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,280
Calm the fuck down!

561
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,564
Calm down? Are you crazy?
We almost got killed in there!

562
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:22,867
- Is that your ride?
- Can you please just tell us

563
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,035
what the hell is going on?

564
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,453
I really need to wash up
my face right now!

565
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:26,579
Keys, now!

566
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:27,705
No! Not until you tell us
what's happening.

567
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:28,957
Anybody got a wet nap?

568
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:30,208
What the fuck do you
think is happening?

569
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,376
Everyone's eating each other!

570
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,253
- Wait, like a...
- Yes, like that!

571
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:34,337
That's not possible.

572
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,422
I think it's possible, Ben.

573
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:38,216
A dead stripper just tried to eat my face!

574
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:39,509
Oh, shit!

575
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,553
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

576
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:43,388
Just shoot it! Shoot it!

577
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:52,730
Yep. Zombie.

578
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:59,154
Any more questions?

579
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,498
Drive, dude, go! Come on!

580
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:15,086
Where are you going? What the fuck?

581
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:22,844
Oh, shit!

582
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,015
Carter, get the tire!

583
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,396
I got it.

584
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,982
Guys, hurry up!
They're getting pretty fucking close!

585
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,652
- Come on!
- I'm going as fast as I can.

586
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:40,945
Find the fucking lug nuts.

587
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:44,532
Fuck.

588
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:48,953
Seriously, hurry the fuck up!

589
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,705
I got them! Here. Here.

590
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,540
Put it on!

591
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:54,542
Okay. Good. Put it on! Put it on!

592
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:55,793
Fuck!

593
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,051
I got it!

594
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:08,306
Oh, shit!

595
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,391
You got to be fucking kidding me.

596
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,357
Go! Go! Go!

597
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,204
Scout Leader Rogers!
What happened tonight?

598
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:56,998
We were worried about you.

599
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:02,420
I know. It's bad. I'm so sorry.
I had to use your bathroom.

600
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:04,088
I think it was the beans.

601
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:06,841
And the marshmallows.

602
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:11,012
I tried spraying. It just lingers.

603
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:21,814
Your neck!

604
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:26,027
Scout Leader Rogers! Please!

605
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,559
I think you're having a bad
allergic reaction to something!

606
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:34,827
We need to get you to a doctor!

607
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:13,176
"All evacuation
buses have departed.

608
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:14,594
"Proceed north on Route 1

609
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:17,054
"to the security checkpoint
at mile marker 17."

610
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:19,474
Oh, shit. They evacuated the town.

611
00:43:19,557 --> 00:43:20,558
That's great.

612
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,201
I missed the party, and I missed Chloe,

613
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:24,395
- and now I'm gonna die.
- Guys.

614
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:25,563
Carter, calm down!
We need to figure out

615
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,190
- what we're gonna do.
- Guys!

616
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:34,572
Come on.

617
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:39,327
Go, go, go!

618
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,078
- Carter, lock it!
- I'm trying to fuckin' lock it, man!

619
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:42,163
It's not working.

620
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,918
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

621
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:48,169
Move!

622
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,255
Come on!

623
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:08,606
Carter, get the ax!

624
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:28,644
Go, go, go.

625
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:34,382
They're coming!

626
00:44:49,897 --> 00:44:50,898
This way!

627
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:53,317
Fuck!

628
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:09,250
This is fucking awesome! Now what?

629
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:17,508
I'm really sorry
I set you on fire, Scout Leader Rogers.

630
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:19,312
But hopefully, it's not as bad as it looks.

631
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:23,931
I used a double overhand stopper knot.

632
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:27,101
It's hard to get out of, right?

633
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:28,644
Oh!

634
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:31,188
Okay. All right.

635
00:45:35,443 --> 00:45:38,446
Okay, now. I'll be right back.

636
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:40,531
Just stay there.

637
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:11,228
Dude, what the fuck?

638
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,564
Haven't you had enough to eat? Jesus.

639
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:16,067
Carter, stop agitating them.

640
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,610
What? I need a new profile pic.

641
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:24,033
So, do you think
they evacuated everyone at the party?

642
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:25,534
Yeah, of course. They had to.

643
00:46:26,744 --> 00:46:28,621
At least we know our parents are okay.

644
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:30,373
- Yeah.
- Where are they?

645
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:33,125
They went to some
lame spiritual yoga retreat.

646
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:35,044
Ugh. I think I'd rather be in here.

647
00:46:40,925 --> 00:46:42,468
I hope Augie's okay.

648
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:44,804
- Who's Augie?
- He's our best friend.

649
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:46,555
Well, ex-best friend now.

650
00:46:46,973 --> 00:46:48,015
Why ex?

651
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:49,725
Because we ditched him for a party.

652
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:51,310
Ben, we were gonna go back.

653
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:53,437
Whatever, Carter. We ditched him.
We're bad friends.

654
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:55,690
Why didn't you guys
just take him with you?

655
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:59,235
You don't know Augie.

656
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:01,070
- What?
- He's just different.

657
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,238
Big geek?

658
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:04,407
He collects deer shit
and weaves baskets.

659
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,783
Okay? You do the math.

660
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:07,743
Okay.

661
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:08,953
Word of advice,

662
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:10,997
chasing parties and popularity
in high school?

663
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,289
It's a total dead end.

664
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:13,833
None of that shit will matter later.

665
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,584
Trust me. I know.

666
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:17,753
You're right, but didn't you,
like, drop out of high school?

667
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:19,588
- No, I got my GED.
- Why?

668
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:21,924
'Cause not everybody has
a lily-white life like you do.

669
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:23,801
Okay. God, you're so hostile.

670
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:26,512
No, hostile is three seconds from
now when my foot's up your ass.

671
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,014
Okay, yeah. Try all you want,

672
00:47:28,097 --> 00:47:29,390
but I happen to have
a very tight asshole.

673
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:31,033
I think I could stretch it out for you.

674
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:32,518
Oh, well, then lube me up, baby.

675
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:35,271
Carter! We're gonna play
the quiet game now, okay?

676
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:38,441
All right, you know what? Fine.

677
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:40,776
I'm over both of you.

678
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:51,912
You're pretty good at that.

679
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:54,498
Yeah, I guess
that Whittling Badge finally paid off.

680
00:47:58,627 --> 00:47:59,879
What about you?

681
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:01,172
What about me?

682
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:03,591
How'd you learn
to use a shotgun like that?

683
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:07,845
My ex-boyfriend was really into guns.

684
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,765
He used to drag me to
the firing range once a week.

685
00:48:10,848 --> 00:48:11,849
Oh.

686
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:14,935
So, no boyfriend now?

687
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:16,353
Not if I can help it.

688
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:18,856
Well, why do you say that?

689
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:20,483
I don't know.

690
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:23,110
Let's just say,
I have really shitty taste in guys.

691
00:48:23,444 --> 00:48:25,529
I'm better off alone.

692
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:27,490
Nobody's better off alone.

693
00:48:27,573 --> 00:48:28,949
Yeah, well, I am.

694
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,328
Aww,
what a beautiful moment.

695
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:34,914
Ow! Asshole, that hurt!

696
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:36,874
- Yeah, that was the point!
- Oh, was that the point?

697
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:38,167
Guys! Shh!

698
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:39,752
Do you hear that?

699
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:41,045
Is that <i>Crank That?</i>

700
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:44,548
They're leaving.

701
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,883
I love this song!

702
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,009
You would.

703
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:59,355
Look! Right there.

704
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,439
Fuck. But they're gonna come back.

705
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:01,565
What are we gonna do?

706
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:03,025
- Condoms!
- What?

707
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,694
Carter, give me your condoms! Hurry!

708
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:09,824
Here. Take them
and open them and tie them together.

709
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:10,908
Why are we doing this?

710
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:12,118
- Just do it!
- Okay, okay.

711
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:13,369
Here's one.

712
00:49:13,494 --> 00:49:14,829
Come on, hurry!

713
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,022
Here we go. Fly fishing. It's genius.

714
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,277
Go on, just a little bit.
Get it right up there.

715
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,362
There you go. Come on.

716
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:49,488
It's right up there!

717
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,075
You got it, come on.

718
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:57,538
Good work. Yes! Yes!

719
00:49:58,414 --> 00:49:59,415
No, no, no!

720
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,418
Jesus!

721
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:03,501
You got arrested?

722
00:50:03,544 --> 00:50:04,670
No,
we locked ourselves in.

723
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,005
- How?
- It was an accident!

724
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:07,464
This has to be Augie.

725
00:50:07,548 --> 00:50:08,591
Augie, get the keys.

726
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:10,516
You kicked them
into the drainpipe over there.

727
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:13,137
- I can't reach it!
- Shit!

728
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,346
Shit, they're coming back.

729
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,556
Hold on.

730
00:50:16,682 --> 00:50:18,684
What, is there a
Lockpicking Badge I'm unaware of?

731
00:50:19,393 --> 00:50:20,394
How'd you find us?

732
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:21,799
Followed the stench of betrayal.

733
00:50:21,854 --> 00:50:22,855
Augie...

734
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:25,191
I saw your car. I figured I'd help.

735
00:50:25,274 --> 00:50:26,942
- Augie, look, I'm really...
- Got it!

736
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:37,953
Go, go, go!

737
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,418
Close the gate!

738
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:54,303
Oh...

739
00:50:56,305 --> 00:50:57,973
...my...

740
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:02,478
...God.

741
00:51:02,937 --> 00:51:03,938
Carter, let's go!

742
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:07,942
- Come on!
- Okay!

743
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:11,737
Oh, God. I touched them!
I touched them!

744
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,322
I don't think they were real.

745
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:20,079
Fuck,
my feet are killing me.

746
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:22,581
The security checkpoint's
only a few miles away.

747
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:25,209
Dude, I'm starving.

748
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:28,879
How can you even think of food
when people are being eaten alive?

749
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:31,715
You know, they say that
humans taste like pork.

750
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:33,217
"They"?

751
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,300
Cannibals, I guess.

752
00:51:34,343 --> 00:51:35,761
Dude, I love bacon.

753
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,096
Hey, look.

754
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:38,973
Maybe the keys are inside.

755
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:47,314
Jesus! This guy again?

756
00:51:47,398 --> 00:51:48,941
Someone kill him!

757
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:51,568
Carter, we can't just keep
going around killing people.

758
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:52,736
Why not?

759
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,900
Because he's a human being!

760
00:51:53,946 --> 00:51:55,066
Okay. We'll see how you feel

761
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,075
when he's eating
your nutsack like a street taco.

762
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,703
Um, guys, he's getting pretty close.

763
00:52:00,786 --> 00:52:02,246
Remember our
Wilderness Safety Seminar?

764
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:03,329
What?

765
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:05,582
When encountering a hostile creature,
be sure to assert yourself

766
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:07,251
in order to keep the animal at bay.

767
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:08,627
Well, I...

768
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:12,381
That is a zombie, not a bear, dumbass.

769
00:52:26,353 --> 00:52:27,438
Guys, I think he's mimicking me.

770
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:28,856
Augie, quit messing around.

771
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:34,987
Augie.

772
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:49,543
What?

773
00:52:52,129 --> 00:52:53,422
Augie, what are you doing?

774
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:06,560
What are you doing?

775
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:22,993
Okay. Did I just drop acid,

776
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:25,579
or are they really singing
Britney Spears with a zombie?

777
00:53:44,181 --> 00:53:45,432
Is that all of you?

778
00:53:45,516 --> 00:53:47,017
Yeah. What the hell's happening?

779
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:49,520
Don't know yet.
Some kind of viral outbreak.

780
00:53:49,603 --> 00:53:51,939
CDC ordered a military
containment perimeter.

781
00:53:52,022 --> 00:53:53,148
Is most of the town evacuated?

782
00:53:53,232 --> 00:53:54,525
As many as we could.

783
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:57,277
This thing hit so hard and fast,
we're still trying to contain it.

784
00:53:57,403 --> 00:53:59,523
What about everyone at the party?
Were they evacuated?

785
00:54:00,114 --> 00:54:01,281
What party?

786
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:45,576
Well, where is everybody?

787
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:48,328
Nobody's here. It must be a mistake.

788
00:54:49,163 --> 00:54:51,582
Yeah, 1146 Dunton Avenue. This is it.

789
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:54,751
It's not a mistake, Carter.
Jeff sent you a fake address.

790
00:54:54,835 --> 00:54:56,003
What?

791
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:57,671
Carter, this is a waste plant.

792
00:54:57,754 --> 00:54:59,756
You get it? It's full of shit.

793
00:55:01,258 --> 00:55:03,469
Motherfucker! God damn it!

794
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:06,221
I can't believe he sent us
a fucking fake address!

795
00:55:06,305 --> 00:55:07,389
Why does it surprise you?

796
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:10,234
I mean, did you actually think
he was gonna invite us to a real party?

797
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:12,186
Karma.

798
00:55:12,686 --> 00:55:13,770
What?

799
00:55:13,854 --> 00:55:15,522
- Nothing.
- No, speak up.

800
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:17,232
Well, I just think it's a little ironic

801
00:55:17,316 --> 00:55:20,194
that, you know, you're all upset now
because you got ditched.

802
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,946
Oh, okay.
So you're saying that we deserve it.

803
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,656
We went to your stupid campout, dude.

804
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,283
You lied to me.

805
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:28,286
We've been lying to you
for the past three years!

806
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:29,828
- Carter!
- Going to every Scout meeting,

807
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:31,121
every lame field trip.

808
00:55:31,205 --> 00:55:32,456
Wearing these stupid fucking clothes

809
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:33,624
so everybody can make fun of us.

810
00:55:33,707 --> 00:55:34,708
Carter, that's enough!

811
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:36,513
Ben, you're not hiding
behind me this time.

812
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:37,628
Tell him.

813
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:38,837
Talk about how many times

814
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:40,923
you said you hated Scouts,
how sick of it you were.

815
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:42,799
- I never said that.
- Bullshit!

816
00:55:42,883 --> 00:55:43,967
No, no, no. It's fine.

817
00:55:44,051 --> 00:55:46,011
I guess it's time
for it to all come out, right?

818
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:48,889
He's had a crush on Kendall
since sixth grade.

819
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:50,390
- That is not true!
- Yes, it is.

820
00:55:50,516 --> 00:55:52,559
- Kendall? As in my sister Kendall?
- Mmm-hmm.

821
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:54,102
- No.
- Dude, that's like incest.

822
00:55:54,186 --> 00:55:55,354
No, it's not, I'm not even related to her.

823
00:55:55,437 --> 00:55:56,480
So you do like her, then.

824
00:55:56,563 --> 00:55:58,023
- No, I don't like her!
- Told you.

825
00:55:58,106 --> 00:55:59,233
Shut up!

826
00:55:59,608 --> 00:56:00,609
Stop!

827
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,820
Again with this shit? Jesus.

828
00:56:03,904 --> 00:56:05,405
Can't you just walkie someone?

829
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:08,909
Hey, are you okay?

830
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:12,621
Guys!

831
00:56:12,704 --> 00:56:14,414
Shit!

832
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,668
Get him!

833
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:25,592
I'm so fucking sick of zombies!

834
00:56:27,261 --> 00:56:28,345
Yikes.

835
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:29,429
Wa-wa-wee-wa.

836
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,644
Shit!

837
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:41,483
Hello! Is anybody there?

838
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:42,943
<i>Evac complete.</i>

839
00:56:43,277 --> 00:56:44,403
No, no, no, no. We're still here!

840
00:56:44,486 --> 00:56:45,779
<i>We have Operation Clean Up.</i>

841
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:49,783
<i>Commence aerial bombing
of site at 0300. Repeat, 0300. Over.</i>

842
00:56:49,866 --> 00:56:51,076
What?

843
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:53,412
No, somebody help! Hello! Hello!

844
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:55,706
Somebody help, please! Hello!

845
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:56,873
Fuck!

846
00:56:56,957 --> 00:56:58,709
They're gonna bomb
the town in two hours?

847
00:56:58,792 --> 00:56:59,835
What are we gonna do?

848
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:01,044
We have to find Kendall and the others!

849
00:57:01,128 --> 00:57:02,671
It's a secret party.
They could be anywhere.

850
00:57:02,838 --> 00:57:03,839
Shit.

851
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,757
My sister's diary!

852
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:08,885
She writes every last
boring detail of her life in there.

853
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:11,888
I guarantee she wrote down
where the party is.

854
00:57:11,972 --> 00:57:13,473
We better get fucking going, then.

855
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:40,334
Okay, now.

856
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:15,202
All right, come on.

857
00:58:25,712 --> 00:58:28,298
Whew! It smells like
Pixy Stix and hope in here.

858
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:31,051
You've never been in a girl's
room before, have you?

859
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:33,261
- Yeah, I...
- Mom doesn't count.

860
00:58:33,345 --> 00:58:34,638
- Well...
- Any female relative doesn't count.

861
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,182
Guys! Can we focus? Where's the diary?

862
00:58:37,641 --> 00:58:39,559
She changes the hiding place,
like, every week,

863
00:58:39,685 --> 00:58:41,228
so just spread out and start looking.

864
00:58:58,829 --> 00:59:00,330
- Did you find it?
- Nope.

865
00:59:00,872 --> 00:59:02,582
Nothing over here.

866
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:17,347
Hey.

867
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:18,849
Did you guys hear that?

868
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:19,933
Hear what?

869
00:59:21,393 --> 00:59:23,395
I think I heard
something downstairs.

870
00:59:24,438 --> 00:59:25,772
Augie, go check it out.

871
00:59:25,856 --> 00:59:27,357
I'm not going down there by myself.

872
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:28,900
- Go with him.
- Why me?

873
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:30,902
Call me when your balls drop, dude.

874
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:38,702
Shh! Don't walk so hard.

875
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:40,954
You have squeaky floors.

876
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,791
This is Carter's sister?

877
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,794
Yeah. That's Kendall.

878
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:50,797
Well, she clearly won the genetic lottery.

879
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:53,842
Yeah. She's okay. I guess.

880
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:55,218
Dude, she's more than okay.

881
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:56,970
You don't have to be all cool about it.

882
00:59:58,597 --> 00:59:59,931
Shit.

883
01:00:01,975 --> 01:00:03,643
Fuck. Come on.

884
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:07,397
So, how come
you haven't told her you like her?

885
01:00:07,481 --> 01:00:08,815
What's the point?

886
01:00:08,899 --> 01:00:10,901
She's never gonna go for a guy like me.

887
01:00:10,984 --> 01:00:12,569
And she's got a boyfriend.

888
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:15,405
And Carter would kill me
if I touched his sister.

889
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:17,699
Okay, look. Here's the deal.

890
01:00:17,783 --> 01:00:20,577
And don't take this the wrong way,

891
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,871
but you have to man up.

892
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:24,831
Yeah, but I suck at being that guy.

893
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:26,541
I'm not assertive like that.

894
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:27,626
Kiss me.

895
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:29,085
What?

896
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:30,649
Don't "what" me, just do it. Kiss me.

897
01:00:31,588 --> 01:00:32,672
Are you serious?

898
01:00:32,756 --> 01:00:34,341
Yeah, I'm serious.
I saw you checking out my ass earlier.

899
01:00:34,466 --> 01:00:35,675
I know you want to do it. Just kiss me.

900
01:00:35,801 --> 01:00:36,843
- No, I wasn't.
- Ben!

901
01:00:36,968 --> 01:00:38,762
- Okay, for a second I did.
- Kiss me.

902
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:40,931
Denise, I...

903
01:00:41,014 --> 01:00:42,516
You can do it. Just go for it.

904
01:00:45,352 --> 01:00:46,603
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Oh, fuck! Fuck.

905
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,286
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

906
01:00:48,355 --> 01:00:49,356
See? I told you
we shouldn't have done that.

907
01:00:49,439 --> 01:00:50,440
It was a bad idea.

908
01:00:50,524 --> 01:00:51,858
No, no, no. Let's just try it again.

909
01:00:51,942 --> 01:00:54,110
No, I feel stupid.
We should look for the diary.

910
01:00:54,194 --> 01:00:55,362
Come here.

911
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,501
Not bad.

912
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:11,294
Really?

913
01:01:11,378 --> 01:01:13,797
It wasn't, like, top five or anything.
Don't get excited.

914
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,757
- But, yeah, it was okay.
- Oh.

915
01:01:15,841 --> 01:01:18,552
When you see Kendall,
just walk straight up to her,

916
01:01:18,635 --> 01:01:19,803
lay some of that shit on her,

917
01:01:19,886 --> 01:01:21,388
and you're golden.

918
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,015
Okay. Thanks.

919
01:01:29,396 --> 01:01:30,981
Guess we left it open.

920
01:01:31,982 --> 01:01:32,983
Hey, Augie.

921
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,572
Ben didn't want to leave you tonight.

922
01:01:40,782 --> 01:01:42,576
It was my idea.

923
01:01:43,577 --> 01:01:45,161
What difference does it make?

924
01:01:45,245 --> 01:01:46,580
It's done.

925
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,335
Yeah.

926
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,511
Oh, fuck!

927
01:02:13,023 --> 01:02:14,107
Come on.

928
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:15,950
What the hell
is going on down there?

929
01:02:16,026 --> 01:02:18,278
We're fine! Everything's under control!

930
01:02:41,384 --> 01:02:44,888
No! No, no, no, no. Fucking, no!
Not my ass!

931
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:48,058
Oh, no, no, no, no!

932
01:02:51,144 --> 01:02:53,480
My ass! My ass!

933
01:02:53,563 --> 01:02:55,815
She's gumming my ass!

934
01:02:55,899 --> 01:02:57,317
Oh, my God!

935
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,401
Carter!

936
01:02:58,735 --> 01:03:01,404
Oh, God! Oh, it's disgusting!

937
01:03:07,577 --> 01:03:09,162
Carter!

938
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:12,666
Peace out, bitch!

939
01:03:16,586 --> 01:03:18,171
What the hell happened?

940
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,258
Shit. Back upstairs! Back upstairs!

941
01:03:29,808 --> 01:03:31,101
Come on, come on!

942
01:03:31,184 --> 01:03:32,769
Move it!

943
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:35,230
That's not gonna hold them!

944
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:37,065
- Did you find the journal?
- No! We looked everywhere!

945
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:38,525
Guys, we got to go! Come on!

946
01:03:53,707 --> 01:03:55,458
Oh, my God! They're coming!

947
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,254
Guys, if we jump,
we might be able to clear the fence!

948
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:01,047
- What?
- Fuck it, let's just jump!

949
01:04:01,131 --> 01:04:02,674
The fence is like 10 feet away!

950
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:05,301
- I'll go first!
- Go, go!

951
01:04:11,224 --> 01:04:12,350
Okay. Go, go, go!

952
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:21,067
Augie, you got to go now!

953
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,361
Hurry!

954
01:04:23,445 --> 01:04:24,487
I can't, I'm afraid of heights!

955
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:26,156
Be more afraid of zombies! Go!

956
01:05:07,197 --> 01:05:08,948
Is that his wiener?

957
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:11,576
We got to do something.

958
01:05:12,035 --> 01:05:13,870
Guys, help me! I'm falling!

959
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:15,872
Hang on to that cock, Ben!

960
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:18,208
Guys, hurry! Help me!

961
01:05:19,876 --> 01:05:21,711
What are you doing?

962
01:05:22,712 --> 01:05:25,048
Hey! Assholes! Come and get me.

963
01:05:29,552 --> 01:05:30,887
Hurry!

964
01:05:32,222 --> 01:05:33,223
It's ripping!

965
01:05:36,726 --> 01:05:38,895
His dick's ripping!

966
01:05:57,539 --> 01:05:58,748
- I got it!
- Dude!

967
01:06:01,793 --> 01:06:03,044
- I got it.
- Where was it?

968
01:06:03,128 --> 01:06:04,504
- Underwear drawer.
- Classic.

969
01:06:05,547 --> 01:06:06,714
Run!

970
01:06:11,261 --> 01:06:12,595
Lock it.

971
01:06:12,929 --> 01:06:14,514
Augie, get the lights.

972
01:06:15,598 --> 01:06:17,100
The power's out.

973
01:06:17,684 --> 01:06:19,352
Where the hell are we?

974
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,105
Mrs. Fielder's house.

975
01:06:22,355 --> 01:06:24,115
I can't believe we
just chopped her head off.

976
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:26,609
She tried to eat my ass, Augie.
She deserved it.

977
01:06:26,693 --> 01:06:28,862
Guys, we got to keep moving. Come on.

978
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:44,836
Carter, check the window.

979
01:06:48,882 --> 01:06:50,675
Shit, they're everywhere.

980
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:52,260
Miss Fielder's car is in the garage.

981
01:06:52,343 --> 01:06:54,387
Maybe we can get out that way.
This way.

982
01:07:09,986 --> 01:07:11,112
What was that?

983
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:12,739
I think something's in here.

984
01:07:14,574 --> 01:07:15,575
Fuck, cat.

985
01:07:22,749 --> 01:07:23,750
Augie?

986
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,126
Dude, dude.

987
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,961
- Augie.
- What?

988
01:07:27,045 --> 01:07:28,963
Don't move.

989
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:42,685
- Did you get it?
- I got it! I got it!

990
01:07:48,024 --> 01:07:49,400
Run!

991
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,784
Come on, come on, come on!

992
01:07:58,534 --> 01:07:59,869
Open the garage door!

993
01:07:59,953 --> 01:08:01,204
It won't open!

994
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:02,705
Go! Ben, go!

995
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:03,998
Fuck it!

996
01:08:15,051 --> 01:08:16,891
Oh, my God.
It's Scout Leader Rogers!

997
01:08:18,221 --> 01:08:19,430
He looks like shit!

998
01:08:19,514 --> 01:08:20,723
I set him on fire.

999
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:22,809
- What?
- He tried to eat me!

1000
01:08:27,563 --> 01:08:29,482
- Wait, what are you doing?
- No, don't...

1001
01:08:37,907 --> 01:08:39,325
Sorry, bro!

1002
01:08:56,801 --> 01:08:59,220
All right, the diary said they're at
the old rec center on Dewer Street.

1003
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:00,847
Hopefully, we're not too late.

1004
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:02,850
All right,
I'll try to get help as soon as I can.

1005
01:09:02,932 --> 01:09:04,517
Just be careful.

1006
01:09:12,442 --> 01:09:14,319
- Denise.
- Yeah?

1007
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:17,447
Look, I don't know what's gonna happen,

1008
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:19,824
but I just wanted to let you know that

1009
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:21,707
you're one of
the coolest girls I've ever met.

1010
01:09:25,621 --> 01:09:27,874
And, uh, I hope
you meet someone that deserves you.

1011
01:09:29,459 --> 01:09:30,460
Thanks.

1012
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:01,908
Guys, let's go.
We got to get to the party.

1013
01:10:01,991 --> 01:10:04,369
Ben, this is a suicide mission.

1014
01:10:04,452 --> 01:10:06,162
Guys, they're gonna
bomb this whole town

1015
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:07,330
in less than two hours.

1016
01:10:07,413 --> 01:10:09,332
What if Denise reaches
the military in time?

1017
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:11,209
And what if she doesn't, Carter?
Then what?

1018
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:13,753
Who's gonna save them?
The police? They're gone.

1019
01:10:13,836 --> 01:10:16,839
The military? They're not coming, either.

1020
01:10:17,507 --> 01:10:19,842
Guys, we're the last line of defense.

1021
01:10:21,386 --> 01:10:23,846
And so what? Maybe we look
like dorks in these uniforms.

1022
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:26,891
And maybe we're a big joke
to everyone at school.

1023
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:30,686
But tonight,

1024
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:33,051
we're gonna show them
what being a real Scout's all about.

1025
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:38,069
So, are we just gonna stand here
with our thumbs up our asses?

1026
01:10:38,694 --> 01:10:41,280
Or are we gonna go out there
and save the world?

1027
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:43,866
Fuck, yeah, dude.

1028
01:10:45,201 --> 01:10:46,702
That was a really good speech, Ben.

1029
01:10:47,453 --> 01:10:48,538
Thanks, Augie.

1030
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:49,956
Let's do it.

1031
01:10:52,959 --> 01:10:54,710
The rec center's that way.

1032
01:10:56,379 --> 01:10:58,381
We're making a pit stop first.

1033
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,371
Are you serious?

1034
01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:16,709
None of my text messages
are going through, Travis.

1035
01:12:16,792 --> 01:12:18,294
Don't worry about that, baby.

1036
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:20,129
Where are you taking me?

1037
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:22,882
Um, it's a surprise.

1038
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:25,285
You need a little spanking, don't you?

1039
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:27,720
Ew.

1040
01:12:28,137 --> 01:12:29,805
Travis, what the fuck?

1041
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:31,140
Come on.

1042
01:12:31,557 --> 01:12:33,643
Okay, this place is disgusting.

1043
01:12:34,894 --> 01:12:36,479
I need to examine you.

1044
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:38,064
- Get over here.
- Oh, okay.

1045
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:42,985
God, you're so sexy.

1046
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:44,487
Thank you.

1047
01:12:46,322 --> 01:12:48,491
Okay, we're not about to fuck right now.

1048
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:49,825
Why not?

1049
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:52,912
Because we've only
been dating for, like, two minutes.

1050
01:12:52,995 --> 01:12:53,996
What about a blow job?

1051
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,666
Travis, I spent an hour
trying to find this piece of gum.

1052
01:12:57,667 --> 01:12:59,001
Sucks.

1053
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,589
Okay, fine. You can eat me out.

1054
01:13:03,673 --> 01:13:05,591
- Really?
- Yes. You're welcome.

1055
01:13:14,267 --> 01:13:15,518
<i>When I'm in jail</i>

1056
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,603
<i>the first thing you do
is talk to another chick.</i>

1057
01:13:17,687 --> 01:13:19,021
What the fuck?

1058
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:25,361
Hey, pervert, fuck off!

1059
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:30,700
You serious, bro?

1060
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:39,375
<i>I was in jail!</i>

1061
01:13:41,877 --> 01:13:44,130
Hello? Are you going to do it or what?

1062
01:13:57,768 --> 01:14:01,689
Ooh! Your mouth's kind of cold.

1063
01:14:12,074 --> 01:14:13,075
Stop.

1064
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:16,245
- Stop!
- Come on, babe.

1065
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:18,247
- Stop it!
- What the fuck's your problem?

1066
01:14:18,331 --> 01:14:19,498
I'm worried about my brother.

1067
01:14:19,582 --> 01:14:21,167
He should've been here hours ago.

1068
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,376
He's not coming, babe.

1069
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:23,753
How do you know?

1070
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:26,172
Because I gave him the wrong address.

1071
01:14:26,255 --> 01:14:28,341
- What?
- They're Scouts, Kendall!

1072
01:14:28,424 --> 01:14:30,926
Look, what'd you think,
I was gonna invite them for real?

1073
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:33,512
- Come here.
- You are such a dick!

1074
01:14:33,596 --> 01:14:35,473
- What? You're not leaving.
- Watch me!

1075
01:14:35,556 --> 01:14:36,891
You're not going!

1076
01:14:38,726 --> 01:14:40,353
Fine, go, bitch!

1077
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:45,858
Oh, Jesus, girl.
Get a fucking tampon, would you?

1078
01:14:56,619 --> 01:14:57,953
Someone help!

1079
01:14:59,664 --> 01:15:02,208
Help! Please, someone help!

1080
01:16:11,068 --> 01:16:13,779
All right, Scouts,
let's kick some zombie ass.

1081
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:50,441
Boom.

1082
01:17:06,999 --> 01:17:08,000
Chloe?

1083
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:09,168
Oh, man.

1084
01:17:11,962 --> 01:17:12,963
Nailed it.

1085
01:17:35,986 --> 01:17:37,530
What a dick.

1086
01:17:41,659 --> 01:17:43,035
Ben, they're everywhere!

1087
01:17:43,327 --> 01:17:44,703
Circle up!

1088
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:51,293
You want some of this?

1089
01:17:51,377 --> 01:17:54,004
You assholes! Die!

1090
01:17:54,338 --> 01:17:57,174
Come on! You want a piece of me?

1091
01:17:59,677 --> 01:18:01,637
Ben! Ben!

1092
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,514
Help!

1093
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:09,728
Ben!

1094
01:18:09,854 --> 01:18:11,230
Hang on, Kendall! I'm coming!

1095
01:18:13,524 --> 01:18:14,692
Oh, shit.

1096
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:16,694
Oh, shit. Shit, start! Come on!

1097
01:18:17,027 --> 01:18:18,362
Ben, look out!

1098
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:19,530
Shit.

1099
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,543
Ben, duck!

1100
01:18:38,757 --> 01:18:39,758
Ben!

1101
01:18:40,718 --> 01:18:43,220
Kendall, come down! Climb down, hurry!

1102
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:47,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

1103
01:18:47,725 --> 01:18:49,059
Guys, come on!

1104
01:18:49,143 --> 01:18:50,436
- Come on.
- Come on!

1105
01:18:50,728 --> 01:18:53,439
We got to get everyone out of here!
Let's go!

1106
01:18:53,898 --> 01:18:56,734
Everybody! Get to the stairs! Come on!

1107
01:19:03,574 --> 01:19:04,617
Let's go!

1108
01:19:04,742 --> 01:19:06,243
Come on, everybody, move!

1109
01:19:06,577 --> 01:19:10,247
Hurry up! Come on, come on! Let's go!

1110
01:19:10,456 --> 01:19:11,582
Let's go!

1111
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:13,417
Let's go! Come on!

1112
01:19:13,584 --> 01:19:14,627
Oh, shit!

1113
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,674
What are you doing?

1114
01:19:20,758 --> 01:19:22,509
They'll follow you if we don't
lock the doors! You gotta go!

1115
01:19:22,593 --> 01:19:24,313
- What about you?
- You got to go! Trust me!

1116
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:25,804
I'm not leaving you! No!

1117
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:27,765
Go! Go! Trust me!

1118
01:19:35,814 --> 01:19:37,149
- I'm out!
- Oh, shit!

1119
01:19:37,316 --> 01:19:39,818
There's too many of them!
Come on, let's go! Hurry!

1120
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:41,320
Let's go!

1121
01:19:41,987 --> 01:19:42,988
Oh, fuck!

1122
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:45,199
Let's go!

1123
01:19:45,282 --> 01:19:46,450
Come on!

1124
01:19:51,664 --> 01:19:53,457
Hurry, come on!

1125
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,292
Go, Augie, go!

1126
01:19:56,293 --> 01:19:58,128
Run! Run!

1127
01:20:09,598 --> 01:20:11,350
Where's the door?

1128
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:13,519
There's got to be another exit.

1129
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:15,020
I don't see one!

1130
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,772
- We're trapped.
- Shit.

1131
01:20:17,106 --> 01:20:18,546
- There's no way out of here.
- Fuck.

1132
01:20:20,776 --> 01:20:22,194
- What do we do?
- Give me your backpack.

1133
01:20:22,361 --> 01:20:24,363
What? What are you doing?

1134
01:20:29,702 --> 01:20:31,370
- What is that?
- It's a bomb.

1135
01:20:31,704 --> 01:20:32,746
You made a bomb?

1136
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,039
What are you, the Taliban?

1137
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:37,084
Either we die fast or we're eaten alive
and turn into one of those things!

1138
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:39,670
Your choice.

1139
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:44,049
- Shit.
- Carter, give me your lighter.

1140
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,301
Here.

1141
01:20:50,723 --> 01:20:52,057
Are you guys ready?

1142
01:20:56,353 --> 01:20:58,022
- Wait!
- What?

1143
01:20:58,564 --> 01:20:59,606
I need to say something.

1144
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:00,983
Ben, it's fine.

1145
01:21:01,066 --> 01:21:02,826
- You don't have to do this.
- No, I do.

1146
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:05,365
We should have never
ditched you tonight, Augie.

1147
01:21:05,821 --> 01:21:07,906
What we did was really messed up.

1148
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:10,325
He's right.
We've been complete D-bags.

1149
01:21:10,826 --> 01:21:12,619
It's my fault.
I never should have made you guys think

1150
01:21:12,703 --> 01:21:14,246
you had to be in Scouts for just me.

1151
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:15,914
No, that's just it!

1152
01:21:15,998 --> 01:21:18,292
I thought I wanted out,
but I was just worried

1153
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:21,253
what other people were gonna think.
The truth is,

1154
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:24,506
I love being a Scout.

1155
01:21:25,507 --> 01:21:28,510
And I love it because
it's the reason I met you guys.

1156
01:21:31,597 --> 01:21:34,767
And I know tonight's been
really crazy and fucked up,

1157
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,268
but one good thing has happened.

1158
01:21:36,685 --> 01:21:38,395
And it's this, right now.

1159
01:21:39,646 --> 01:21:40,731
Us.

1160
01:21:40,898 --> 01:21:42,524
Being back together.

1161
01:21:45,194 --> 01:21:46,528
Scouts forever.

1162
01:21:49,448 --> 01:21:51,033
Scouts forever.

1163
01:21:53,202 --> 01:21:54,203
Scouts forever.

1164
01:22:00,793 --> 01:22:03,212
Ben? Is it really lame
if I hold your hand right now?

1165
01:22:03,545 --> 01:22:04,546
No.

1166
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,635
Oh, God damn it. This stupid thing!

1167
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,387
- What are you doing?
- It's out of fluid!

1168
01:22:12,471 --> 01:22:13,722
Here. Give me that.

1169
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,100
Wait, do you have another lighter?

1170
01:22:19,895 --> 01:22:22,064
God damn it, Augie,
we were supposed to die fast!

1171
01:22:24,566 --> 01:22:26,068
This is gonna hurt so bad.

1172
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:27,653
Come on, Augie, you can do it!

1173
01:22:27,736 --> 01:22:29,988
Don't pressure me! I hate that!

1174
01:22:31,698 --> 01:22:34,118
Yo, dipshits!
You just gonna sit there or what?

1175
01:22:35,494 --> 01:22:37,079
Where'd she come from?

1176
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:40,916
Augie, leave it!

1177
01:22:48,382 --> 01:22:49,383
Augie, let's go!

1178
01:23:27,796 --> 01:23:29,214
Are you guys okay?

1179
01:23:29,298 --> 01:23:31,383
I'm alive. I'm alive!

1180
01:23:31,466 --> 01:23:33,218
Oh, my God! Augie!

1181
01:23:33,302 --> 01:23:35,304
- Dude! You're a genius!
- It worked!

1182
01:23:35,387 --> 01:23:36,805
That was fucking awesome!

1183
01:23:36,889 --> 01:23:38,223
- Fuck, yeah, man!
- It worked!

1184
01:23:40,309 --> 01:23:41,602
What the fuck?

1185
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,812
Is that Scout Leader Rogers?

1186
01:23:46,315 --> 01:23:48,442
You got to hand it to him.
The man is a fighter.

1187
01:23:49,735 --> 01:23:52,321
Oh, shit. Does anybody have a weapon?

1188
01:23:52,404 --> 01:23:54,907
There's got to be
something around here.

1189
01:24:09,755 --> 01:24:10,756
Ah!

1190
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:15,302
Every goddamn time! Ugh!

1191
01:24:26,688 --> 01:24:28,106
Now you decide to show up.

1192
01:24:49,461 --> 01:24:51,630
<i>Evacuation fleet
moving to secondary location.</i>

1193
01:24:51,713 --> 01:24:53,131
Dude, you look like shit.

1194
01:24:53,215 --> 01:24:54,455
Yeah, well, what do you expect?

1195
01:24:54,508 --> 01:24:55,634
I've been killing zombies all night.

1196
01:24:55,717 --> 01:24:57,357
Yeah, you were kind of badass last night.

1197
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:00,389
Well, thanks for coming back.

1198
01:25:00,472 --> 01:25:01,807
Somebody's got to keep saving your ass.

1199
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:03,225
Yeah, I guess so.

1200
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:07,229
So, um, are we gonna
hang out after this, or...

1201
01:25:07,646 --> 01:25:09,731
Come on, I feel like
the four of us are a team now.

1202
01:25:09,815 --> 01:25:10,857
Relax, dude.

1203
01:25:10,983 --> 01:25:13,485
You've got some business
to take care of right now.

1204
01:25:17,781 --> 01:25:19,616
Go for it. You got this.

1205
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:22,536
- All right.
- Go.

1206
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:30,127
I am so happy that you're okay.

1207
01:25:33,255 --> 01:25:37,050
Oh, that's so sweet. Up top!

1208
01:25:37,301 --> 01:25:38,885
Dude, I'm not high-fiving that.

1209
01:25:38,969 --> 01:25:40,053
Come on.

1210
01:25:40,137 --> 01:25:42,055
You think I'm high-fiving that?

1211
01:25:42,139 --> 01:25:43,724
Come on!

1212
01:25:44,141 --> 01:25:45,475
Aww, look at them!

1213
01:25:49,688 --> 01:25:51,023
Who are you?

1214
01:25:51,523 --> 01:25:52,858
I'm a Scout.

1215
01:25:57,487 --> 01:25:58,530
All right, well, this just means

1216
01:25:58,655 --> 01:25:59,895
- I'm gonna fuck his mom.
- Hey!

1217
01:25:59,948 --> 01:26:01,116
What?

1218
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:28,013
Come on.

1219
01:28:30,223 --> 01:28:31,516
The end.
