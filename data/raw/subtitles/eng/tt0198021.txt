"A baby born out of holy wedlock...

who put you in this mess?

they move to California.

Sweetie, you are going to need
a place to take this baby.

414
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,553
Maybe you should think about moving
into Sears, or Kmart is really nice.

-When are they letting you out?
-T omorrow.

425
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,918
Well, I'm not in any hurry to move on.

426
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,071

Home, apartment, whatever,
until you get on your feet.

430

I got me a little money.

431
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,869
Oh, I got money. The president
of Wal-Mart sent me $500.

432
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,479
Why?

433
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,951

-No.
-Oh, shit.

435
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,911
No, he just wanted to be nice.

436

and my money together...
