you'll be guilty of murder.

don't get out of it,

certainly did not.

I do not see any cause to. . .

how my children behave

he isn't even nice.

But he can't
steal our lovely car!

will you, Daddy?

Well, now,
that's easier said
than done.

Well, I'll tell you.

1572
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:52,212
All right. You all stay here.
I'm going up to that castle.

1573
01:40:52,296 --> 01:40:53,380
We want to come, too.

1574
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:54,881
We want to help
you find Grandpa.

1575
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:57,718
Don't you think
we ought to
stay together?

1576
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:59,803
Maybe you're right.
All right, come along.

1577
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:01,346
Come on, children.

1578
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:04,891

where we are.

I don't know.

01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:07,936
Come on.

1581
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:15,193
Pardon me, sir.
The castle?

Come on.

What are they staring at?

I don't know.

1588
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:06,620
It seems to be
the children.

1589

What's the matter with them?
Haven't they seen
children before?

1590
01:42:11,793 --> 01:42:15,128
Haven't you noticed?
There aren't any children.

1591
01:42:17,799 --> 01:42:19,174
Not one.

Hey, you. What's happening?
What's going on?

1595

Soldiers! Soldiers!

Hey, you there.

1597
01:42:45,868 --> 01:42:47,702
Get those children in here.

1598
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:49,079
Would you mind telling me
what's happening?

1599
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:50,997
Quickly, before the
soldiers get here.

1600
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:52,332
Soldiers?
Come, Fräulein.

1601
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,458
Quickly, quickly.
Get inside.

1602
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:54,543
Just a minute.
Would somebody

1603
01:42:54,627 --> 01:42:57,087
mind telling me
what's going on?
Please don't talk.

1604
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,631
We must get those
children out of sight.

1606
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,968
If the soldiers find them,
they will take them away.

1607
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:04,094
But why? What for?

1608
01:43:04,178 --> 01:43:05,178
It's the law.

1609
01:43:05,263 --> 01:43:07,597
Nobody's allowed
to have children
in Vulgaria.

1610

Not allowed?
What about these toys?

1611
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:11,476

she hates children.

1612

hate children?

1627
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:17,459

You two men,
break down this door.

Yes, sir!

1630

Get this door open.

All right! I'm coming!
I'm coming!
Open the door!

You have no right
to come into here.
You've no right.

A-ha!

1636
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:44,861
They are here somewhere.
I can feel it in my bones.

1637
01:44:45,488 --> 01:44:48,573
There are children
here somewhere.

1638
01:44:48,658 --> 01:44:52,035
Children?
In the toy shop?
Such a notion.

1639
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:54,245
I mean. . .
What do you think
you're you doing?

1640
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:56,623
That's something special
for the Baron's birthday.

1641
01:44:56,707 --> 01:45:00,210
Let me tell you, toymaker.

1642
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:04,839
This nose of mine
has never failed me,

1643
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:09,844
and if there are
children here, my friend,

1644
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,639
you will die.

Quick! Open it up!
Get down there and
search the cellar!

1649
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:32,993
The Baroness will
have your teeth
for a necklace

1650
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:35,704
and your eyeballs
for earrings.

1651
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:37,831
Nobody down here, sir.

1652
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:40,583
Fool! ldiot!
Out of my way!

1653
01:45:42,253 --> 01:45:45,755
You have to know
where to look.

Like cockroaches,
they get under the floors,

1655
01:45:50,845 --> 01:45:56,224
in the cracks in the walls,
in the woodwork.

1656
01:46:34,764 --> 01:46:38,808
I don't trust
a man who makes toys

1657
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:43,646
in a land where
children are forbidden.

1658

is exclusively for his
Excellency, the Baron.

Chitty, Daddy.

They can't take
Chitty away.

going to do?

1670
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:25,563
Well, I don't know,
but I'm not just
gonna stand here.

Are you mad?

1672
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:29,859
Are you going to take on
the whole Vulgarian Army
single-handed?

01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:42,038
What kind of
a country is this?
No children!

out of their lives.

My friend,
take some good advice.

1676
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:51,756
Take your children
and your good lady
and get out of Vulgaria.

1677
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:53,967
And leave Grandpa
up in the castle?

1678
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:56,553
Oh, no.
We came to get him out,
that's what we're gonna do.

1679

Just tell me
how to get there.

a toymaker.

1681

finish this in time

1682
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:01,933
for the Baron's
birthday tomorrow,

1683
01:48:02,017 --> 01:48:04,352
I shall be
a dead toymaker.

1684
01:48:04,436 --> 01:48:07,480
All right. I'll go myself.
Truly, you stay here
with the children.

you're letting yourself
in for, believe me.

not to move from here
until I come back. . .

don't we, Jemima?

you stay right here.

kids are like.
Yes, I understand.

2090
02:18:32,596 --> 02:18:35,890
I mean, I don't think
they realize how
ridiculous that would be.

2091
02:18:35,975 --> 02:18:37,308
Ridiculous?

2092
02:18:37,393 --> 02:18:39,894
Well, yes.
You live in that big house,

2093
02:18:40,854 --> 02:18:42,522
your father,
the factory and all.

2094
02:18:42,606 --> 02:18:44,482
It's a different world, Truly.

2095
02:18:44,775 --> 02:18:48,653
You know, if I said
something like that,
you'd call me a snob.

2096
02:18:48,737 --> 02:18:50,738
I didn't mean. . .
Goodbye.

2097
02:18:56,829 --> 02:18:59,497
Well, don't you
want to ride up front?

2098
02:19:08,924 --> 02:19:11,634
Well, that was
a fine picnic,
wasn't it?

2099
02:19:15,931 --> 02:19:17,515
Shall we have
another one tomorrow?

2100
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:19,475
With Truly?
Yes.

2101
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:23,521
Well, Miss Scrumptious has
a lot of social engagements,
you know.

2102
02:19:26,150 --> 02:19:29,110
Are we ever going to
see Truly again, Daddy?

2103
02:19:30,988 --> 02:19:33,197
Well, we'll see.

2104
02:19:40,414 --> 02:19:42,999
JEREMY: Look,
that's Lord Scrumptious' car.

2105
02:19:43,083 --> 02:19:44,375
CARACTACUS:
Why, I believe it is.

2106
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:46,169
JEMIMA: I wonder what
it's doing here.

2107
02:19:46,253 --> 02:19:47,920
CARACTACUS:
Well, I don't know.

2108
02:19:48,005 --> 02:19:49,297
Come on.

2109
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:52,133
Excuse me.
Good afternoon.

2110
02:19:52,217 --> 02:19:53,718
Are you. . .
(MEN SHOUTING)

2111
02:19:58,474 --> 02:20:00,600
Boom! Boom! Boom!

2112
02:20:00,684 --> 02:20:02,268
That's wiped out
your dashed cavalry.

2113
02:20:02,352 --> 02:20:03,394
Yes, sir.

2114
02:20:03,479 --> 02:20:06,814
But I have my 2nd
Infantry battalion
attacking here from the rear.

2115
02:20:06,899 --> 02:20:09,650
Attacking from the rear?
That's dashed unethical.

2116
02:20:09,735 --> 02:20:12,403
Artillery,
prepare to open fire.

2117
02:20:12,488 --> 02:20:13,571
Fire!

2118
02:20:13,822 --> 02:20:16,240
GRANDPA: Number one battalion,
prepare to advance!

2119
02:20:16,325 --> 02:20:17,742
What's going on here?

2120
02:20:17,826 --> 02:20:20,536
There you are, young Potts.
Been waiting for you.

2121
02:20:20,621 --> 02:20:23,081
And that wiped
out your artillery!

2122
02:20:23,165 --> 02:20:24,665
You're a cad, Potts.

2123
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:26,417
Would someone mind
telling me what's going on?

2124
02:20:26,502 --> 02:20:28,419
Fancy you being
old Bungie's son.

2125
02:20:28,545 --> 02:20:31,089
Bungie?
Bungie Potts,
best batman I ever had.

2126
02:20:31,173 --> 02:20:32,632
Weren't you, Potts?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

2127
02:20:32,758 --> 02:20:34,467
You mean that
you were. . .
My boy.

2128
02:20:34,551 --> 02:20:37,720
Allow me to introduce
to you my Brigadier.

2129
02:20:37,805 --> 02:20:38,971
Your Brigadier?
Potts. . .

2130
02:20:39,098 --> 02:20:41,933
How about
some more tea?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

2131
02:20:42,017 --> 02:20:45,269
As for you, young man,
there's a very good chance
you may be very rich.

2132
02:20:45,354 --> 02:20:47,063
CARACTACUS: Very rich?
What do you mean?

2133
02:20:47,147 --> 02:20:49,148
Those confounded
sweets of yours.

2134
02:20:49,233 --> 02:20:51,901
Useless for humans,
wonderful for dogs.

2135
02:20:51,985 --> 02:20:53,402
Woof Sweets,
that's what
we'll call them.

2136
02:20:53,487 --> 02:20:54,612
Woof Sweets?

2137
02:20:54,696 --> 02:20:57,657
Canine candies.
Dogs love them.
Make a fortune.

2138
02:20:57,741 --> 02:20:59,450
Daddy, Daddy!
You've done it, Daddy.

2139
02:20:59,535 --> 02:21:00,785
You've done it!
Have l?

2140
02:21:00,869 --> 02:21:03,204
It's the posh life
for us all now, my boy.

2141
02:21:03,288 --> 02:21:05,331
We're all going
to be rich!
Hooray!

2142
02:21:05,415 --> 02:21:07,625
Do you mean to tell me
I invented something
that actually works?

2143
02:21:07,709 --> 02:21:10,336
Of course they do.
Wouldn't be offering you
a contract unless they did.

2144
02:21:10,420 --> 02:21:11,671
Sign here, please.

2145
02:21:13,423 --> 02:21:15,466
Wait. Don't go away.
I'll be right back.

2146
02:21:15,551 --> 02:21:16,884
LORD SCRUMPTlOUS:
What about the contract?

2147
02:21:16,969 --> 02:21:18,719
But, Daddy,
where are you going?

2148
02:21:19,138 --> 02:21:20,388
Daddy!

2149
02:21:25,144 --> 02:21:26,435
What's the matter
with the fellow?

2150
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,272
Well, he's a bit of
an eccentric, sir,

2151
02:21:29,356 --> 02:21:34,235
a genius, of course,
but definitely an eccentric.

2152
02:21:34,903 --> 02:21:37,446
Can't imagine
where he gets it from.

2153
02:21:42,077 --> 02:21:45,371
Truly, you'll never
believe it.

2154
02:21:46,290 --> 02:21:47,415
I just got home. . .
This is beginning to be. . .

2155
02:21:47,499 --> 02:21:48,666
. . .and your father
was at my house.
. . .a hazard.

2156
02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:50,626
I know! I know!
They told me at the house.

2157
02:21:50,711 --> 02:21:52,253
We're rich.
(EXCLAIMS)

2158
02:21:53,046 --> 02:21:55,840
You know, more than that,
I have succeeded.

2159
02:21:55,924 --> 02:21:57,884
I always knew you would.

2160
02:21:58,927 --> 02:22:01,888
You know something else?
The kids were right.

2161
02:22:01,972 --> 02:22:04,640
There's nothing so ridiculous
about the idea of
getting married.

2162
02:22:04,725 --> 02:22:06,934
Well, whoever said
there was?

2163
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,944
Well, Mr. Potts.

2164
02:22:17,029 --> 02:22:18,112
What's the matter?

2165
02:22:18,197 --> 02:22:20,281
Now you'll have to
marry me.

2166
02:22:20,365 --> 02:22:21,699
(BOTH LAUGHING)

2167
02:22:25,621 --> 02:22:27,622
So dreams can come true.

2168
02:22:27,706 --> 02:22:28,956
Yes, they can.

2169
02:22:29,041 --> 02:22:32,001
Yes, they can,
but you have to
be practical, too.

2170
02:22:32,836 --> 02:22:34,962
You have to face the facts.

2171
02:22:35,756 --> 02:22:38,132
Man has to see things
as they really are.

2172
02:22:38,217 --> 02:22:40,384
After all,
a man with responsibilities

2173
02:22:40,469 --> 02:22:43,554
can't walk around
with his head in the clouds
all the time.

2174
02:22:43,639 --> 02:22:46,974
A man should keep his feet
solidly on the ground.

2175
02:22:47,059 --> 02:22:49,727
Oh, a man should have
his dreams

2176
02:22:49,811 --> 02:22:53,606
but a man has to learn
to put those dreams
to some practical use,

2177
02:22:53,690 --> 02:22:57,401
not just sit around
and think about them
all the time.

2178
02:23:05,118 --> 02:23:07,245
BOTH: (SINGING) Oh, you,
pretty Chitty Bang Bang

2179
02:23:07,329 --> 02:23:09,288
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
we love you

2180
02:23:09,373 --> 02:23:11,415
And our pretty
Chitty Bang Bang

2181
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:13,376
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
loves us too

2182
02:23:13,460 --> 02:23:15,294
High, low, anywhere we go

2183
02:23:15,379 --> 02:23:17,630
On Chitty Chitty we depend

2184
02:23:17,714 --> 02:23:19,423
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2185
02:23:19,508 --> 02:23:21,759

Our fine four-fendered friend

2188
02:23:28,558 --> 02:23:30,935
CARACTACUS:
It's uncategorical

2189
02:23:31,019 --> 02:23:32,937
A fuel-burning oracle

2190
02:23:33,021 --> 02:23:36,816
A phantasmagorical machine

2191
02:23:37,234 --> 02:23:39,235
TRULY: It's more
than spectacular

2192
02:23:39,319 --> 02:23:41,279
To use the vernacular

2193
02:23:41,363 --> 02:23:43,406
It's wizard
It's smashing

2194
02:23:43,490 --> 02:23:47,076
BOTH: It's keen

2195
02:23:47,744 --> 02:23:49,829
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang

2196
02:23:49,913 --> 02:23:51,872
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
we love you

2197
02:23:51,957 --> 02:23:54,041
And Chitty, in Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang

2198
02:23:54,126 --> 02:23:56,085
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,

2199
02:23:56,169 --> 02:23:58,004
Near, Chitty, far, Chitty,
in our motorcar

2200
02:23:58,088 --> 02:24:00,131
Oh, what a happy time
we'll spend

2201
02:24:00,215 --> 02:24:02,008
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2202
02:24:02,092 --> 02:24:04,385
Our fine four-fendered friend

02:24:04,469 --> 02:24:06,220
Bang Bang,
